Maybe Our Expectations were too High,"Had gone with a friend for dinner. What we liked was the nice cosy interiors. The staff especially Rose was welcoming and attending to her guests with a smile

What could have been better could have been the food. The presentation needs improvement and the agilo olio seemed too oily and the burrata just average . the bread which accompanied the soup was excellent"
Hidden gem,We found out that Lucca was originally at Robertson Walk and relocated here in the heartlands of Tiong Bahru. Just love the whole vibe in this restaurant and the service is top notch. Their truffle fries is amazing but the portion is quite huge so need to have 3 pax or more to finish it...
Authentic Ambience & Food,"Feels like being in Italy. We had a table for 8, a special 5 course wine dinner. Wines were supplied by Tenuta Fanti. Started with delicious chicken liver pate with crostini and meat-filled tordelli. Two mains were outstanding- pistachio crusted lamb rack and US grain fed ribeye. Last but not least, the chocolate cake. Price per person -S$128++"
Dinner at LucasTrattoria,I ordered whatever Bianca recommendedm Great with my bottle of wine! Service & food was great! Look forward to come with friends again.
"Good Food, GREAT Service!","Good Food, GREAT Service!
‚óè Date of visit: 6 September, 2022
‚óè Meal: Late Lunch, first time visit
‚óè No. of Diners: 2
‚óè Total Bill: SGD 139.50

Food ordered:
‚óã Starters ‚Äî Caprese Con Mozzarella Di Bufala; Parmigiana Melanzane; Bruschetta
‚óã Pasta ‚Äî Polpo Alla Griglia x 2 (but one with an additional side of shrimp)
‚óã Drinks: None.

All the dishes we sampled were well executed. The starters, tho' not particularly extraordinary, were definitely flavorful and made from good quality ingredients ‚Äî just about what one may reasonably expect from any ""good"" Italian restaurant.

But we definitely enjoyed our pasta! The pasta delivered on taste & visual pleasure ‚Äî perfectly al dente spaghetti, beautifully coated with the unctuous richness of a generous amount of squid ink, and perfectly balanced by the uplifting zest of the juice from the charred lemon wedge. Yummmm!

(Tho', for those who prefer more protein in the dish to offset such a delectable carb-overload, you will do well to order an additional side of perfectly done shrimp to compliment the slices of polpo!)

But the true stand out of our entire meal? ‚Äî for us, it was the truly gracious service we received from Bianca that really elevated our dining experience at Lucca's! What a beautiful, warm, open-hearted person she is ‚Äî her infectious smile & affable personality is the sort of ""special ingredient"" that no kitchen can ever cook up, and which can magically enhance one's dining experience with the kind of delight that's also capable of feeding your heart!

Thank you, Bianca ‚Äî besides the fine food, your service is what will ensure us continuing to return to dine at Lucca's Trattoria!

Great Food & Services,First time at Luccas on a Sunday evening thinking of having a light food and some cocktail for refreshment.. food was splendid and surprisingly our cocktails was the best we had throughout the night.. Good work done by the lady mixologist that we had a few glasses of Martini‚Ä¶ planning to come back for more cocktails
Off the beaten Treck,"We went there for dinner 5 days ago. Everything was very good. Starting with the restaurant itself. It is very nicely decorated with an Italian flair - as you would expect. They even took measures to keep the noise level low by placing decorative items on strategic places. As a result you can have a normal conversation even when the place if busy. This is something we appreciate very much.

The food - the most important thing - was very good. Very tasty with just the right amount of spices, cooked to perfection and just the right portion size. Ok, we did not try the entire menu, but I am sure the rest of the dishes are just as good.

Last but not least I have to mention the service: A customer service other places can learn from. Very attentive yet never in your face. Just the perfect balance.

Next time we come to Singapore, Lucca's Trattoria will be on our to-do-list."
Nice Italian restaurant in Tiong Bahru,"Restaurant just moved from
Robertson Quay to Tiong Bahru. It is bigger & looks newer. The house wine Pasqua Sangiovese Puglia IGT 2020 went well with cheese board. The pizzas were not bad too. It is a good deal as we used the Entertainer to enjoy the 1 for 1 offer."
Marvellous dinner with great service!,"Steak was great and cooked to perfection. Overall service was great and professional, all thanks to Rose! Cheers! ü•∞"
Thanks for hosting us Rose,"Place is very convenient. located very near to Fort Canning MRT. I rang up the restaurant to reserve for 10 people. Conversation with the person answering the call was easy. No english language hiccups because I had to explain few things before making a reservation.
I think the person‚Äôs name is Rose. We were taken care and given enough time and space.
We finished our lunch in 2 hours and in good company."
Best in town pizza,Excellent services.very warm and friendly crew.Three thumbs up for Miss Rose and William (crew).you guys made our night very special. Thank you for the excellent job .food and wine was just awesome!üëçüëå‚ù§Ô∏è
Great service and delicious food,"The food was served fast and tasted good. Staff were also quite friendly, would definitely visit again."
Good choice for meal!,"Was a pleasantly surprised choice.. we were going for a show at nearby theatre and accidentally wandered into this restaurant. Friendly and professional waiters Raymond, Rose and George quickly settled and served us.. with their recommendations, the food were served very fast. Ordered bruschetta, calamari, homemade pasta and risotto. Very delicious food, although slightly on the steeper end. The ambience, service and standard of food still made it worthwhile! Will come back again soon."
Great pasta !!,"ended up here just in time after arriving in Singapore. Did not realize early closing times, so got great and quick help at Lucca's.
Bruschetta and Pasta Coniglio (apparently shot locally). Was a great taste with a nice italian wine on the side. Made it back to the hotel just in time."
Tasty Authentic Italian food,Food was delicious and services is great. Location is also good easily accessible by public transport. Kudos to Rose for great service.. We would definitely comeback
Yummy Italian food,"Our first time here - love how hearty, rustic and fresh the food is. Our 5 year-old loves the calamari here. Made us miss Italy."
Amazing experience at Lucca,"My friends celebrated my belated birthday at Lucca. The service was excellent and the margherita pizza is so nice that I even ordered for take away! We were told that the pistachio ice cream was sold out but the next moment the service staff told us that the chef is making a fresh batch and if we can wait, it can be ready soon. We were so touched by their attentiveness and service! Thank u for making this belated birthday celebration unforgettable."
ENJOYABLE DINNER,"Delicious food (though the cappucino and tiramisu were a bit lacking, to be honest). Good and friendly service. Special shout-out to Rose Anne for her very cheerful disposition. Will certainly come back."
Our new favourite for Italian food,"Chanced upon this restaurant & we were surprised by the quality of the food. Everything we ordered was delicious. Margherita was authentic & we loved the crispy crust. Truffle Fries was crispy. Calamari was crispy too & the accompanying mayonnaise spiked with Calabrian instantly became the kids' favourite. Ms Bianca, who has been most friendly & efficient in her service, was very generous to give us a second helping of the mayo. Aglio Olio (we added prawns) was al dente & very tasty. Carbonara (we requested to do it the creamy style to suit the kids' preference) was also praised by the kids. We ended the meal with Tiramisu which was really good with a strong hint of alcohol. I have always loved Pistachio ice cream and theirs is very creamy & one of the best I have had so far. Overall, good quality at reasonable prices. My kids said this is now their favourite Italian restaurant & I have made another reservation with Ms Bianca for my next visit!"
An excellent Italian Restaurant,"We our so excited that 5 pax for dine in is back and we are able to finally hangout again. We choose Luccas Trattoria for our first dinner together and we never regret it. We started with appetizer( truffle fries and calamari) which is very good to start our appetite. After that we ordered Formaggi Pizza (I genuinely think this was one of the best cheese pizzas that we have ever had ) and home made lasagna (we love the cheeziness). Good wine recommendation by Rose Anne that really wrapped up our day to awesomeness not to mentioned the discount that was given to us.

Great pizzas. Great wine. Great service! Great everything!"
"Go eat there, I promise, you will not be disappointed!!","Stumbled across this place on a casual evening out, and we were going to our regular italian restaurant but gave LUCCAS A TRY AND WE DID NOT REGRET IT!! In one week i went back a total of 4 times! It truly is that good of a a place to eat. I went twice with my husband, once with a friend, and then on the Sunday with our 2 adult children who had to eat at a separate table, but they too agreed the restaurant is great. Raymond is front of house and is calm, friendly as are all the staff. The chef even came out to enquire about the food we ate and was humble enough to even ask if there was anything different he could have done to the dishes, which there wasn't as it was all super tasty, great value for money and well presented. I highly recommend the garlic bread, calamari to start and the chicken (Pollo Marsala) and the fish (Merluzzo Al Forno) and the Tiramisu to finish. Go to eat there, YOU WILL NOT be disappointed!"
Good food!,"Me and friend both had burrata,Risotto, Funghi and the crabmeat prawn. The food was bomb! But a bit salty for the crabmeat risotto. Not sure if its supposed to but overall the taste was delicious. Staff were friendly too :)"
Wonderful night out,Went there with my wife to celebrate our anniversary. The staff are friendly and the food are great. Staff recommended to upgrade to Angus for Bistecca Alla Florentina (TBone Steak). Good recommendation!! Took their recommendation and did not regret it. Good variety of wines for different budget and staff is able to find us a good wine within our budget. All in all good experience.
"Wonderful experience, great food and excellent service","We were walking around Robertson Walk, not knowing what to eat when Raymond approached us and patiently go through the menu with us. We ended up ordering Burrata bruschetta for starter and Beef lasagna and Funghi risotto for main. The food tasted superb! Raymond, Bianca and David, the chef were very friendly, helpful and professional. Although this is our first time here but we will definitely dine here again! Great food! Excellent service! Highly recommended! Oh! Desserts were equally impressive:)"
Biance & Raymond,"This restaurant was nothing short of amazing . I had so much of fun and excitement here i couldn‚Äôt contain my laughter , the staff working here was nothing but friendly and accommodating. Honestly I have no knowledge pertaining to Italian food but the recommendations of them enlightened me beyond words.Before reaching here to celebrate with my boyfriend I had no idea what to obtain but Biance and Raymand recommended to us the most appetising in their opinion amongst the choices that left us craving more but elated. If you haven‚Äôt tried this food please come here and enjoy like we did! :)"
Great first time!,"Great homely atmosphere and attentive, friendly wait staff. Tordelli Lucchese was incredible, favourite dish of the night! Would definitely come back again to try the other signatures :)"
Authentic Italian food & great place for family dinning,"Great place for Italian food, very nice service and location, my kids like Pizza and pasta most.. wine was great selection. we will go back again.. must try"
Fantastic restaurant for family.,Nice service and homely feeling.food is nice as well The tiramisu is great and the salad as well! Great ambience at a centralised location with easily accessible parking lots.
We love lucca‚Äôs trattoria!,"Our family patronises this restaurant all the time, they have lovely staff and amazing food! Must try!"
Nice Italian food,Nice food and ambience. With polite and nice service from the restaurant staffs. Will definitely come back again!
Reminds us of Tuscany,"We spend a few days in Florence in Dec 2019 and absolutely love the food from popular Trattorias like Dall‚Äô Oste, Mario & Zaza. We recently found out about this Italian restaurant and decided to try it.

Our thoughts on the dishes we ordered.

Crostini - really reminds us of Florence. The chicken liver p√¢t√© doesn‚Äôt have any or very mild irony taste... full of flavour and creamy.. must try

Caprese - it‚Äôs good version no complaints

Tuscan soup - prefer the ones we had in florence but this is not bad too

Bolognese- Wished they had traditional pasta with Ragu like in Trattoria Mario where it‚Äôs more of a meat sauce without tomatoes overpowering it

Bistecca- Delicious beefy flavour, love gnawing on the bone, the sauce that came with it had a really good beefy umami flavour. It would be slightly better if they charred the beef more for a better crust.... must try

Gelatos- We had pistachio & hazelnut... creamy yummy goodness

Will return again"
simply one of the best italian,simply one of the best italian restaurants in Singapore to me. Their squid ink pasta is incredibly good as it comes with sliced charcoal grilled octopus‚Äîthe depth of flavours is insane.
Dreadful.,Dreadful. Spaghetti looked and tasted like it had been reheated numerous times - dry and strange colour. Pappardelle was either every broken remain from the bottom of a bag or had been chopped to pieces prior to serving - plus watery. Main courses brought out whilst still eating starters. Don‚Äôt bother .
Good cocktails...,"I enjoyed the lasagna. quattro formaggi...umm.. not sure i‚Äôll order it again. Their cocktail selections, it‚Äôs a winner. ordered 4 different types ( sorry, forgot the names), i enjoyed them allüëç That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm rating them 4."
Excellent Italian Meal,"There are a good number of Italian restaurants here but my dinner companion chose this particular one as he was familiar with its offerings. Not knowing any better, I agreed.

Indoor and outdoor tables are available, and we chose to have our meal indoors. From the outside, the restaurant did not look very spacious, but once inside and as I turned a corner, there were more tables. I was very curious about the ceiling though, and you would know what I mean when you see it. Feeling a tad hungry and due to our fondness for sharing dishes, we started with the Garlic Bread, followed by the Salmon and Spinach Pizza and Pan-seared Salmon. All three dishes were well cooked and I could not complain. Dessert was from the selection of gelatos in a counter. If you like, there is a small retail section by the entrance where pasta and sauces are for sale.

Overall, the meal was excellent and the service pleasant. Having said that, I might just pop in again one fine day."
Nice food and good range of wine,Nice food and good range of wine. Great to have an Italian gelato there n pizza was nice. Tried the rabbit stew pasta too as not lot of places do rabbit stew in Singapore. Will definitely go back again to this cozy restaurant with friendly staff.
You get what you pay for!,"We were lured here by the very favourable TripAd reviews. The best thing about our lunch was the outstanding waitress Son - extraordinarily friendly, full of energy, and exceptionally efficient. The other nice thing about Lucca‚Äôs is that it‚Äôs also a mini retail shop, and you can buy their wine at 20% discount for immediate consumption. We only ordered signature dishes. The most important thing in Italian cuisine is quality of the ingredients. Yet, the mussels were not fresh, and that was masked by the mediocre sauce. Pasta is supposed to be cooked al dente, but the squid ink was overcooked (too soft) while the pappardelle was undercooked (too hard)! Sauces were good. All reviewers rave about the calzone. They must not have had calzone before, because this one is quite meh! Ultimately, with Italian food, you get what you pay for. So, either pay up and go to Garibaldi, Basilico, Braci, Art, or Bistecca Tuscan Steakhouse for steaks, or just go to Pizza Express lah! Even with the Entertainer offer and in spite of the charming Son, we won‚Äôt go back anytime soon."
Valued good homemade foods with good service from friendly staff,"An Italian restaurant that I visit every often with friend, family and business.
This is a place which you get homemade bread, pasta, pizza and gelato. The dishes here is all made by a group of local chefs which I thought is Italian at first. An Amazing cooking skill. Keep it up chefs!
The price here is very reasonable for the quality you get which is like some fine dining. And the friendly staff that always come to the table to speak to me and my guest. The friendly manager also offer a good choice for wines all the time. Another restaurant that come with an impressive wine list. Thump up!
I will say this is a place where you can't complaint much for the price you are paying and the good service from their friendly staff."
Good Italian Food But Horrible Service,"Credit where it's due, the food in Lucca's is good and we have come a few times because of that.

However, the service experience was terrible and really far outweighed the good taste of the food.

We had called before coming to the restaurant and also clarified with the waitress before ordering how certain Burpple 1-1 discount vouchers were to be used and how the discounts applied. She informed us that the discounts would be applied to the same dishes if ordered together (i.e. if we ordered two meat dishes, they would be 1-1. if we ordered two more pasta dishes that were cheaper, they would be 1-1 between them too).

However, they changed their minds and informed us only when we were paying that they would only discount the cheaper of the two dishes (i.e. We would pay for both meat dishes and the two pastas would be the 1-1 discount). The manager and the staff that were attending to us were very rude and basically said that it was our problem as this was what they had agreed with burpple.

To avoid any further disagreements and make an already distasteful experience worse, even though we objected to it, we paid the higher sum demanded by the staff and manager and left.

I would recommend this place on the basis of the food, but would not recommend it if you have to deal with the same staff and manager that we dealt with. Would give service 0/5 if i could."
Lunch @ Lucca‚Äôs,"This was my 2nd trip to Lucca‚Äôs but today‚Äôs entire experience today was made incredible by their server , Alisa, who cheerfully welcomed us from the start. She made excellent recommendations - the beef lasagne and spinach ravioli (pasta is made at the restaurant) and intermittently came to check on us and peppered our lunch with her warmth. Alisa would be one of the main reasons we come back to Lucca soon‚úå"
Good Italian Food,Excellent service and recommendations by the staffs. Quite a varied wine option too. I would recommend the Calzone Pizza
Good place to enjoy Italian cuisine,Good place to enjoy home-style Italian cuisine. Excellent service by friendly staff. A must go in Singapore.
More Then Just A Restaurant,"This Italian restaurant serves really authentic dishes whipped up by young local chefs. Their pastas and pizzas are to die for. My personal favourite is their pizzas freshly made and baked on order. You can see the process by the way. In case you need some protein, they do lovely steaks here too. And if you have special requests - just ask, the chefs might be able to cook for you. There‚Äôs also a big alfresco area if you prefer.

Best part of it all - the prices are really affordable!

Also, they have a fine selection of wines from all over selling at retail prices. No extra charge even if you drink there. They also have a retail section selling spices, condiments and pastas straight from Italy. And not forgetting the cigar room - quite a nice selection.

Make sure to try this restaurant when you crave for some Italian food!"
Another decent Parma ham pizza experience,"Another visit to Lucca‚Äôs last month, this time for lunch. I once again chose the Parma ham pizza which was just as good as on the previous visit. My companion chose the squid ink pasta which was also decent. The peroni beer was just right to wash it down. Hope to visit again soon."
Great place to unwind,"Great Restaurant, located in the centre of Robertson walk. Regular customers an I can say the food quality and quantity is consistently good. Best part has to be the staff, warm and friendly always smiling. Sit outside good food, good company, great service watch the day go by."
Alfresco Italian Style,"Located in the beautiful Robertson Walk, dining at Lucca's Trattoria was straight out of Italy. The vibe was right - chill with a lively ambience. The Calzone pizza that we had was amazing, and was meaty and flavourful. The dark chocolate orange gelato is a must have if you are a chocolate lover and fond of rich flavours. Last but not least, the service was great - Alisa was really friendly, helpful and cheerful, and was prompt in providing recommendations and help when needed. Would definitely come again!"
Top quality pizzas,Came here for dinner in late March and opted for the parma ham pizza. This was really very good - thin crust just the way I like it. Efficient service and cold beer. Just annoying that smoking is allowed in the outside area - next time I might choose to sit inside.
Lasagna & pomodoro,"Alisa is a bundle of joy while serving, lovely night out! Order the lasagna this time and it's still very good!"
Top notch Italian restaurant in Singapore,"Always delivers! Fantastic food every time! Must try: Squid Ink Pasta with Pulpo and Prawns, Tiramisu and Gelato."
Great food and excellent service,Sol and Alisia were very helpful and friendly. The aglio olio pasta delicious and one of the best I've had! The calamari and bread were yummy too! Definitely worth a visit.
Terrific food,Wonderful food in this mainly outdoor restaurant. Fantastic pizza as well as other dishes. Perfect for families. Will definitely come back.
One of my favourite Trattorias in Singapore,"One of my favorite Trattorias in Singapore. Me and my wife had a happy time over delicious fare here during Xmas season. We liked the Diavola, the Vongole and most of all their own Tiramusu. Sol did a great job to make it a wonderful experience. Will be back again!"
Excellent food and Service,We had a late dinner in Luccas and the food was lovely and service staff are accommodating. Definitely will come back again.
good foods and friendly staffs!!,"Was having a great time there celebrating my friend's birthday! The lasagna and aglio olio were outstanding! Delicious foods make the price reasonable, worth it!"
Terrible service and staff who raised their voice when an error was pointed out . Would never recommend this place,"We had a great experince with thisplace a day ago so we decided to order soup from them on foodpanda.
My husband's soup came with basically what was a quater of the soup portion in the container. We had takeaway a day ago and it was a regular portion.
He rang Lucca's Trattoria to ask them how this could be . The lady that picked up basically brushed him off and said that was not their problem.

As a restaurant , its their problem when customers have an issue with their product. Especially when its a repeat customer. They should not be raising their voice at customers who call with an issue and say its not their issue.

They have lost us as customers. We eat out a lot because we are too lazy too cook.
And from this point onwards we will tell anyone else how terrible our second experince with them was.

Maybe at some point this restaurant will figure out that being nice to paying customers is also part of what makes a good restaurant."
Authentic & Excellent,"Cosy environment, great service and tasty Italian food. Had the crab risotto and carbonara, both were excellent. Definitely coming back!"
We had a lovely meal. The,We had a lovely meal. The staff were very friendly and accommodating to to special requests. Will be back!
Excellent food and service!,Excellent food and service! We had the prawn and crab risotto as well as the diavola pizza and it was real delicious. Would come back again!
Holiday,Good food. Good drinks. Good service by waitress Alisa. Pizza Prosciutto E Rucola. Coffee Ristretto and Macchiato. Good location near Clarke Quay.
Great authentic Italian food - Absolute pleasure,"There are so many Italian cuisine around Robertson Quay. Lucca‚Äôs one of the most authentic. Pasta are always consistent - al dente. Ordered the carbonara, what a delight! Big thanks to friendly/smiley set of crew, so welcoming. They make such a perfect host especially Alisa. This will be our go to whenever we want to have Italian food."
Dinner,Excellent service and pleasant staff and food is good well presented and reasonable price . Cosy ambiance with alfresco seating.
"Great food, great service, great experience",I brought my family for dinner - eleven of us. Pizzas were great. Highly recommend the four cheese and carne pizzas as well as the signature T-bone steak. Staff were friendly and attentive. Will definitely come again.
Great pasta,Wonderful place to have some simple Italian fare. Nothing over the top but done really well! Kudos to them!
Lovely quaint spot/ good food/friendly staff,"Cacio e pepe!
Looked all over singapore and finally found it here. Very well made. My wife and I had a wonderful meal- it also reminded us of the small trattorias in Rome. And the tiramisu was pretty special too. Not to mention the really friendly service. Book a table indoor if you want it quieter and cozier :)"
Great food and great service!,The restaurant has an authentic Italian ambience and the food is great too. The waitress recommendation of the pasta and wine is also good! Simply enjoyed an Italian meal!
Excellent food,"We visited Lucca's several time during our holiday, food was always excellent. Extremely tasty pasta dishes. A must if you find yourself at Robertson Quay."
Authentic Italian Food,"We have been loyal customers of this restaurant. One of the best Diavola in Singapore! Not to mention their awesome service. If you‚Äôre in Singapore, you must go to this restaurant. üôåüèª"
Average food,The food quality was just average and both carbonara pasta and tiramis√π were not that authentic. For this price I did not feel that it was worth it.
Best Italian in town?,"I love this place. Great location, nice staff, decent priced and the food is great. Traditional Italian food without Asian influences. The cauliflower soup is out of this world and the Penne Arabiata is the best I ever had."
"Good Food, Good Wine and Cigar too!","Really good Italian food can burst your bank account in Singapore, so I was really glad to be introduced to Lucca‚Äôs Trattoria. Do not be fooled by the very simple, basic decor, cause the food is anything but.
Besides the usual fried calamari, cold cuts and cheese, risotto and pasta - all well seasoned and cooked to perfection - I am surprised they serve a very authentic cannellini beans stew. Very simple and clean but packed with flavors.
Must order their pizza too - freshly hand made only when you order.
They have a wide selection of fine wines to go with your meal. You will be pleasantly surprised how affordable these wines are - in comparison to some other restaurants.
To top it all off, this restaurant has a small cigar selection for those who appreciate them.
Hoping to get your pasta or pizza cravings fixed? Check out this restaurant! It won‚Äôt burn a hole in your pocket!"
Nice place,"Good pizza and tasty tiramisu! In the background you will hear best/classic Italian music hits. If you order the large pizza, then you will not need a starter. 12‚Äù and each inch tasty. The tiramisu could have been a bit larger, but the taste is good.
Overall a clear recommendation for dining alone or as a couple or with friends."
Second time at this place.,"We went here for the second time (first time two years ago). The food was as good as last time, nice staff and great environment. It‚Äôs located at a small square near many hotels.
Have been traveling quite a lot and this restaurant holds high standard even compared with very nice Italian restaurants.
A good choice!"
Great food & Service (Angel),Food was great and service from Angel was 5*! Very attentive. Would return and recommend friends to visit!
Good service and food,Nice Angel. We had a lovely dinner at luccas... Superb food and customers service. Would definitely come back again..
Superb Italian restaurant with pet friendly (outdoor),Nice food. Good service. Allow to bring pets (if sit outside). Love their pizza and risotto. Definitely will come again.
Fantastic little Restaurant nice to sit outside,"We visited this little restaurant two times whilst in Singapore this month. Service and staff were very efficient and pleasant. Food perfectly cooked and piping hot. prices very reasonable for Singapore, worth a visit."
Very good,"Considering the fact that is never easy to find an Italian restaurant oversea i‚Äôam surprised about this restaurant in Singapore. Salumi platter can be inproved so much but acceptable, pasta Cacio&Pepe has been a good surprise (please consider to use bigger size of spaghetti in future). 5 stars can be met but need to care deeper in details."
"Great food, great service & awesome staff","Food was good, staff was attentive and helpful (Alisa). Ambience was also great - cozy little place that‚Äôs not too crowded. Will recommend!"
Yummylicious Italian Cuisine,"Tasty Italian food in a quiet, cosy corner unit with outdoor refreshment area. If portion can be larger than will be excellent !"
Excellent service,We receive excellent service regularly from Alisa and Cath. Nice child-friendly restaurant with good food.
Cozy Italian Restaurant,"Nice staffs (Marisol, Cathy, Alisa). Definitely coming back here!!! Superb food and customer service! üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª"
Authentic Italian Restaurant,"Had dinner at Lucca‚Äôs Trattoria with friends. Superb experience from the staff down to the food. Love the Crostini Di Fegitani, Caprese, Liver Bacon & Marsala Pasta and of course the Pizza!!!!

I highly recommend this place and will definitely go back to Lucca‚Äôs Trattoria!"
Amazing Italian Food,"The food here is hearty and satisfying, along with a moderate selection of wine. Service staff is attentive too and attends to the tables regularly."
Authentic Italian restaurant,Authentic Italian food with good services. It also has yearly award as TOP restaurants by wine&dine! Good choice for family as well!
You can't go wrong at Lucca's,"It's definitely my comfortable place to have dinner or lunch when I think of classic italian food. Not only because it's nearby my office and because the food is of great quality but also because I am always welcomed by the crew there, should it be busy or out of the normal serving hours. And as far as I observe, everyone is! And I can easily say that I have been there many many times (I can even tell you the name of the three serving ladies! They are pro and fun altogether which is something rare in itself. Ok you don't care, I still say it : special thanks to Sol, Alisa and Cat). Favorite : Burrata (unfortunately they don't have it every time then the Caprese will do if you add the prosciutto on top), The Simplici liguini and the home made ice creams are a must try.
Plus they give discount to regular customers and you will get the same!!! So don't complain no one told you. And Buon appetito!"
Recommended!,"We chanced upon this place and decided to give it a try. We didn‚Äôt know what to eat and the service crew was very helpful in helping us to decide what to have for dinner. The bolognese and the polpo pasta were tasty and the cocktails were marvellous. Overall, we enjoyed our experience over here and would definitely recommend this restaurant to our friends."
Food and service,Excellent food and service. Recommend the bruschetta and the excellent aglio oglio. Fast service as well!
Good Service and ambience,We were seated at the outdoor area and had a lovely dinner. The pesto risotto was surprisingly really good and worth a try! We also tried the buratta which was great too. There was a table next to us where the kid was jumping around and had her hair on our pizza. They did not hesitate to change it and service throughout the night was superb. Would definitely come back again! Thank you for a great night!
One of the best Italian restaurants in the area,"I have been here many times, for lunch and for dinner. The staff is friendly and they always provide great service. The food is very good, and is a great value for Singapore prices. I am particularly fond of their pizza diavola, and the pasta Bolognese is another favourite of mine. There are a lot of Italian restaurants in this area, but Lucca's is one of the best!"
Never fails to impress!,"Quaint just like the cafes I love to explore in Italy, the food here is phenomenal and staff are both warm and professional! The quality of food is constant and I have a good time every time I am here. As a vegetarian, I‚Äôm spoilt for choice and I highly recommend this restaurant! :)"
You keep coming back!,"A friend brought me to this restaurant almost 2 years ago. Since then, I‚Äôve been coming back almost once every week!

The food is wonderful and the ambience is great! The staff are extremely friendly and they even know my regular orders! :)

For people who wish to have less carbs (pizza and pasta), there‚Äôs also menu options like steak and seafood! It‚Äôs perfect for gatherings or dates.

After dinner, there‚Äôs also great dessert and yummy gelato! *drool*"
Sol is Max,"Lucca's has become a favourite of mine over the last year as I am frequenting Singapore on business. Invairably greta food cold draught beer and the best waitress in town, Miss Sol. So friendly and makes a lonely traveler feel so welcome."
The two MOST GREATEST PEOPLE,"This restaurant is fantastic on it's on, but the staff takes it over the too. They're just AMAZING. Aalisa (left), Sol (right) made me feel right at on and help me make the choice of this being the ONLY place I smoke a cigar, but beer and eat from. They are a delight and their customer service is unmatched throughout the whole of Robertson walk. I suggest ALL that this be your first stop and last stop and every stop in between when visiting Singapore.

My go-to wine place,"Food at trattoria is legit, a proper italian fare. The price maybe a little steep but for its location and the quality of food and sevice, its impeccable. This place feels home to me, never a disappontment and if you're lucy, look for SOL! She is attentive and will also look out for the needs of all the customers. Look no futher if ure in roberton walk!Coffe here is also to die for."
Perfect for small group business meetings,"On two separate occasions, had productive and enjoyable business meetings here (small group). Food was delicious and service was attentive. Rich and tasty liver-based pasta and unique sausage & soft fried egg pizza hit the spot!
Thanks Alisa (on Sunday) and Sol (on Tuesday) for the friendly faces and terrific service!!"
Authentic Italian food,Highly recommend the food. I had delicious and light calamari for starters and probably overstimated my appetite indulging in a 12 inch pizza.
not real italian,"Food not so Italian..chef should not be italian. Taste as any fake italian restaurant, service was ok , but food was really ...flat !! And exoensive for what they are offering and giving... disappointed... no chance i ll be back !"
V-Day Soup and Dessert made our V-Day fun,"My husband and I went to Lucca‚Äôs Trattoria on 14-Frb-2019 and had an awesome Valentine‚Äôs Day special dinner tastefully created by Chef Alfie Lim. Every course is an awesome experience on the palate.

The mushroom cappuccino that‚Äôs eye-catching cutest, not just the wonderful flavors that comes with it. But the fun of the dinner comes from the Chocolate Ball dessert.

Chocolate ball shell filled with fairy floss, ice-cream and mini-marshmallows. Brings out innocent happy childhood memories tagged with those sweets. Creating new beautiful today memories with my husband.

Chef Alfie‚Äô bonded the front of the house together with the kitchen with this dish. Restaurant Manager Jackson Laei and his 2 staff Sol and Cath contributed to making this dinner a fun experience for us..

Sol‚Äôs beautiful hands did the gueridon service to ‚Äúvisual demolition‚Äù the chocolate ball for easier eating after. So good we had to have it twice. So sorry Sol, I forgot to press the button to video it.

Jackson‚Äôs skillful champagne opening with a silent hiss didn‚Äôt stop to amaze me. How did you do that?

Cath‚Äôs attention to detail in spite of the busy dinner service is background service that should never be unnoticed nor taken for granted. Thank you Cath.

I want to thank Chef Alfie and her kitchen team. Restaurant Manager Jackson, Sol and Cath for making Valentine‚Äôs Day a so wonderful for my husband and me."
Very good service and delicious food,Sol was very good and accommodating. We loved the food and the service. The tiramisu was delicious! Thanks Sol!
