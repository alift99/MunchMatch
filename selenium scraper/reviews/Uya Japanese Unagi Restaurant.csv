One of the best Unagi restaurants in Singapore,Have gone there multiple times and the unagi sets are always delicious. The portions are also very generous and the service staff are friendly.
Authentic Japanese vibe and cuisine,"Order salted hitsumabushi and nagayaki (sauce) salted eel served with fresh wasabi, very tasted. Sauce one is very delicious. Highly recommend! we will definitely visit again!"
Birthday celebration @ Uya,The restaurant allocated us in a room because I stated that I was having a birthday celebration. It was really thoughtful of them and the food was delicious too. Our unagi set meals were well prepared and delicious. The staff were also friendly and attentive to us. Had a great time!
First time to Uya,Happened to pass by Uya one evening and was intrigued with the containers of eel. Made a reservation to try their signature eel set. The food was delicious and the service superb.
1st time dining in,This place sells great food. The amount of food is just the right portion. The staffs are friendly. The place is small and cozy.
Nice place,Would think it’s a good place to hangout in small group but very noisy for business lunch. Good food though
2nd time dining in,This place is great& charming!! Atmosphere is chill & cool. The food is awesome!! The amount of food is serve in right portion. The staffs are really friendly & knowledgeable. They know what they are doing & I can tell that making customers happy is their main priority.
Great Food. Great Choice.,Great food. Restaurant is small but cosy. Sashimi is fresh. The 3 ways of eating the unagi are interesting and unique.
One of the best unagi in Singapore,"One of thw best Unagi dinner in Singapore. Especially the Hitsumabushi, very special with condiments and special soup for the chazuke. Tasty unagi with crispy skin but tender and juicy meat."
Best unagi house in Singapore,Walked-in and was a pleasant surprise to find available tables on a busy Saturday dinner hour. The unagi bowls were excellent and freshly prepared. The best unagi rice bowl I ever had in Singapore.
Delicious food!,"My third visit to Uya and the quality of the food served is superb. Love their Hitsumbushi, grilled to the right amount of char, retaining the moisture of the meat."
Probably one of the best unagi in singapore,Good quality food. Delicious and reasonably priced. Prepare to queue if you do not have a reservation.
Dinner,Good ambiance with good food. Arigtou. The unagi is good as usual. Has a beef bowl which was great as well. Will definitely come back again.
Good,"Business lunch. Went well, not too noisy, maybe because lunch crowd not that many. Food came quickly"
Best Unagi ever!,I love that their Unagi is grilled so perfectly that it leaves a light crisp on the surface. This is what makes it special and apart from all the unagis I’ve tried since my first unagi bento on the Japan shinkansen. It’s a place that I’ll bring all my visitors who will be happy to eat grilled eel.
For Unagi Lovers,"I was looking for a restaurant with nice grilled unagi and found Uya on google. Indeed, the unagi is really good. Char grill to the right perfection and the sweetness of sauce is just nice; not overpowering the unagi. However, my husband doesn't like to eat fish and the other selections which included wagyu beef don and tempura are pretty normal. Nonetheless, it is worth a second visit for its unagi."
Superb Hitsumabushi,"Amazing eel, well seasoned and grilled. We given a private room for our lunch, which pleasantly surprised us all and for which we are thankful to the restaurant for."
Nice but service is lousy,"As the title says. Food was ok, quite decent but the service was pretty poor. We were tucked away at the side of the restaurant and appeared to have been overlooked. When our order arrived we had to ask for cutlery which they forgot to bring. Towards the end of our meal we were being rushed to leave even though there were other diners in the restaurant.Can do better guys...."
Beyond Sushi & Sashimi,Top quality and excellent service. Very traditional Japanese unagi cuisine- eel dishes. They have also the Traditional Sushi & Sashimi options. An opportunity to learn more abou Japanese cuisine.
Delicious unagi meap,Delicious unagi meal. Arrived around our reservation time. Table wss ready for us. Service was prompt. Very satisfied with the dinner. Hope to visit again soon
Service is prompt and friendly!,"The Sashimi Rice Bowl was fresh, and the rice was soft and full of flavor! The unagi Rice Bowl didn't not disappoint either. My friend and I really enjoyed our meal. It's great as a pitstop lunch or dinner. Service is prompt, friendly and very informative. Staff were always smiley."
Decent Unagi in SG,The Unagi was flavourful and decent. However found still feel the soft bones when biting into the Unagi..
Serendipity,"The salmon skin salad was exquisite. Crisp and light. We were not fans of unagi but they make it so well here that we’re now converts. Staff are very polite, friendly and attentive. My husband very softly wished me Happy Birthday with the sake we ordered (the sake 4th on the list was good too) and I think the young lady (Chris) who was serving us might have overheard because at the end of the meal she brought us a green tea ice cream with birthday candle on top and accompanied by an audio recording of the birthday song! It made our evening a memorable one."
Totally awesome!!!,You can taste the charcoal 'heat' from the grilled unagi. Totally can't get enough of it. Great place for couples and friends of 4 gathering. It was crowded during lunch so lucky we did our reservation.
Prepare to wait if you don’t make reservations!,"Actually the food was good and enjoyable. However , The front staff needs to be trained what to manage the customer’s expectations. We called on Saturday for lunch and told to walk in. We then went and told to leave our phone numbers. We were told there were 3 more people in front of us at 1247pm. We then came at 120pm and told us there still 3 in front of us and asked why they are many walked in. Then told they have reservations. We were upset that this should have told us earlier and we can decide not to wait. We waited all most 1 hour to have our scrumptious meal! The food was great and I love the unagi rice bowl eat in 3 ways. The grilled liver is so so , the oyster tempura was just ok ! The unagi is not cheap and ordered the medium size just enough . Overall food is good but need to improve the issues I raised earlier."
Smoky and Delicious Unagi,"I ordered a middle set Unagi at $35. It had an awesome smoky taste and smell. The Unagi was fresh and soft. Excellent unagi. There were no small bones. I prefer to eat it as it is - dry version. The staff also taught me to add the dashi stock into the rice and Unagi into a Hitsumabushi which is soup on rice and ingredient. I also enjoyed the salty sour green pickles. The hot sencha tea was nice. The large fried oyster coated in tempura flour and Shiso leaf was the bomb. The oysters tasted so rich and creamy, every bite burst with full creamy umami flavour. It came in a set of 3 and it cost $12. I will definitely order the oyster again. I feel that the Unagi at Uya is better than that at Man Man. Friendly and helpful service. They allowed us to cut our birthday cake and served us with small plates and spoons. They helped us to take nice photos too."
Theresa's Birthday,Excellent food. Very tasty Unagi! Shashimi bowl was fresh. Waitress helpful to bring cake and taking photos!
Good Times at uya,Good food n service excellent ....we like especially the private room for 8 pax. The crispy bone n fish skin salad loved by all of us.
Wonderful lunch,This is my second visit to have lunch. Do booking first as the restaurant is very famous and long queue of course.
Unagi lovers,"Hi! This is our 1st visit to Uya and definitely will be coming back again very soon. If you love Unagi, this is the place that you have to visit."
Customer Service,I made a reservation for 7pm and they forgot about it. I even gave them a call to confirm my reservation 3 days prior to my visit.
Best Unagi i have ever eaten,"Best Unagi i have ever eaten. Pricey but worth it. Remember to book before going. Great food, service was ok only though."
Good Food and Service,"Food was good, so is the service ! Unagi, Chirashi and Fish Skin salad are must try... Will certainly come back again."
Enjoyable evening with friends,The food is excellent and the service staff is friendly. The staff recommended us a few special dishes which we really enjoy.
Highly recommended,My second visit to this place with quality food and excellent customer service. Fell in love with their tangerine peel soup! Very authentic!
Unagi is good,Brought my mum there for lunch & she enjoyed the unagi & high quality Japanese rice ! Location at Orchard is convenient.
Not bad,"Service was good, food portions were big, the sashimi was fresh and the Unagi was tasty. No complaints!"
Uya - unagi,Food was fresh and well cooked. The unagi was tasty and well presented. Staff was efficient and polite. no qualms in getting more seaweed with meal.
Love the choice of eating the Eel in three different ways,"First time patronising the restaurant. My sister in law recommended the Histumabushi, which provides a choice of eating the eel in different ways - as it is, with some garnishing, and with porridge (with or without the garnishing). I have always liked eel. Eating it with porridge was my favourite way. i wouldn't both with the non unagi items. As another tripadvisor, princesspreets, noted, the uni-wagyu beef rice bowl I tried was 'so so'. The uni was fine - but uni usually is fine by itself, but the wagyu beef was disappointing. Tasted like normal roast beef. So you are paying for wagyu but the taste is not different from normal beef."
Yummy!!,Although the variety of food is limited but all were really yummy! The sashimi's portion is generous & fresh too.. Love the salad & unagi is the best!
no unagi on the day we went; non-unagi items are so-so,"unfortunately we went on the day that they had no unagi items due to flight delay, so we could only try the non-unagi items (they did give a 10% discount for the non-unagi items, just for the day). the sashimi box was not bad. tempura was so-so, and they forgot to provide the dipping sauce until we asked. wagyu bowl was not very tasty, and too much rice compared to ingredients. overall, not very impressed with the non-unagi items. we guess it's really the unagi that is supposed to be worth going for"
No BD service,"As eel is my wife’s favorite food I reserved here as BD dinner, however there was no special treatment. And will not expect anymore."
Delicious Unagi rice,The unagi rice bento was delicious. the eel was grilled nice and tender. The taste was superb. Staffs were friendly. Price was pretty high
Very Good Eel- But Pricey,"We have had excellent grilled eel in Japan, grilled basted with more of the sauce, which I prefer.

The eel here is also very good- fresh, tasty, firm, but with much less sauce.

There is a special set which includes a broth that one can pour on the rice to make it soupy- nothing special, does not add any extra flavour, would skip unless you want soupy rice.

Sashimi is also very good, according to others in our party.

For what you get it is quite expensive. But hey, guess it is cheaper than going to Japan.

Well recommended."
Great eel rice and overall food quality,The eel rice was great. Eel was fresh and crispy but not oily. The sashimi moriawase (premium) and assorted vegetable tempura were good too. Fresh and well-prepared. Be careful of the private dining room though as the thin wall separating it from the neighbouring room is inadequate for sound insulation.
"Somewhat overrated Eel bento set, and average service","I was recommended to get the eel set, and I must say it was nice, though for the price, I felt that there was no real wow-factor, to the point in which I was so satisfied and full of praise.
I must say that the service was not that commendable either. Hardly a smile on the faces of the waiters and waitresses. That really was a downer for me, because they all looked so stony and expressionless. Most disappointing, I must say.
Honestly, I would not be back again."
Fresh and Tasty,Unagi is fresh and the sauce is not too heavy . Excellent service from the team. I alway try to visit the store if I am around the area for meal.
Yaya to Uya,"The unagi is delightfully smoky, crunchy and flavourful. I’d eat it every week if it were not so pricey. They use all parts of the eel here. Not all dishes are successful: The crispy bones are delectable; the grilled liver is interesting; the deep fried liver a bit too heavy; the liver ponzu is less good than ankimo. Avoid the fish skin salad; when we were there, the fish skin is so chewy it’s almost disgusting."
Dinner experience,"The Unagi skin was very spongy, a bit tough despite cooking for a longer period. The other food was fine. Manager service was great."
Excellent unagi & sashimi,"The menu options are not many, but the quality of the charcoal grilled unagi, sashimi platter and charashi bowl was excellent quality! Slight pricy but worth it!"
Signature Unagi,"Ordered the signature unagi set which comes with miso soup, broth and condiments (very thinly sliced seaweed , wasabi and spring onion). The unagi is grilled to Super crispy but flavouring wise is quite bland. However, definitely very fresh to the bite. The broth seems rather bland also and doesn’t feel much difference after I mixed with the rice. Should have visited Man Man before I can do a good comparison. Would still rate it good given the freshness of the unagi."
UYa restuarent,"My 5th time back because the ungai was so nice. Broughty sisters there for birthday lunch. However was rather disappointed as the rice came soggy. For the price I paid, it's really disappointing. I was planning to bring my hubby next but now having 2nd thoughts."
Awesome Unagi,"Had the Hitsumabushi, Unagi egg roll and Crispy bone. Perfectly charcoal grilled unagi with strong char flavour. My favourite way was eating the unagi and rice together with the dashi stock!"
Good food but poor service,"I ate at Uya on Saturday with my family. Despite the restaurant being only half full when we ordered, we waited 30 minutes for our food - 3 sashimi dons and 1 Unagi hitsumaboshi.

At the 24th minute, I asked my server where the food was (nothing was served on the table except water). She came back to tell me that the other table hadn’t gotten their food yet so I wouldn’t get my food till after them.

She also said that I should have expected to wait since the Unagi would take 20 minutes to prepare (not stated on their menu / told to us by our servers). I have eaten there before and have had the Unagi served before that.

Despite my communication of the above to the manager, nothing was done as a matter of service recovery.

I like the food but I hesitate to say that I will be back."
Great Unagi Restaurant!,"In my opinion one of the best, if not the best Unagi Restaurant in Singapore.
Price and portion is reasonable, given the ambience and location of the restaurant.

Apart from the main Unagi course, I managed to try the Wagyu Salad and it was a great accompaniment.

I will definitely drop by for another visit in the future!"
Not the best Unagi restaurant,"Service and ambiance was nice. However, we found the unagi to be quite pricey for what was served. It had a lot of bones and was a little too salty for our liking. Texture was also a little too crispy overall. Much preferred Man Man which was clear of little bones, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Still a nice restaurant and wasn't too bad, but couldn't help comparing it with other unagi places that were of similar or less cost while also tasting better."
Haven’t had such lovely unagi in awhile,"Lovely place, quality food at reasonable prices with good ambience and service. Highly recommend the nagoyaki salted set. Will definitely be back for more!"
Awesome Unagi,It’s my 4th visit to this eatery! My fave is their Signature Unagi.. 3 ways of eating it!👍🏻😍 prompt service.. recommended to make your booking to avoid waiting especially on weekends.
Fresh Hitsumabushi. Nice for family.,"I visited for 3 times, as it is in Orchard area and easy to pop in while shopping.
I tried ""hitsumabushi"", ""Una-don/rice-bowl"", and ""Una-jyu/rice-box"". At this place, I prefer ""hitsu-mabushi"".
It seems they cook Unagi with ""Nagoya-style"", which would be better for ""Hitsu-mabushi"".
I always find many families with children, and the members seem to be well prepared."
Great food,"This was my 2nd time at the restaurant. The queue was light and if you have a booking the wait is less than 5 mins. Manager and staff super friendly and helpful. Food - delicious. The eel was grilled to perfection, with the well prepared rice... it’s wonderful. To me it’s a Star ⭐️ Restaurant"
Unagi too thin,"Had a large hitsumabushi. I felt unagi was over cooked, so it was little bit too crispy. What was disappointing was it was so thin that I could not have any feel of unagi meet texture. If you have unagi at better place, such as Chikuyotei, you will feel the texture of a fluffy white fish meet but there was none. With a similar price range, I definitely prefer Man-Man."
Good food!,"Very popular, informal and crowded. We arrived at 6.30 pm and managed to be seated at what appeared to be their second last table. The service was prompt and we appreciated the helpful suggestions regarding our food orders. We thoroughly enjoyed the food and the high energy meal experience. The light Crispy Salmon skin salad with sesame dressing was yummy. The Medium signature unagi was very good - The fish was moist with a crispy char, a little too salty for my taste personally - If you are not high on carbohydrates, order a medium bowl for two persons to share. The Grilled liver was interesting n chewy. The Sashimi moriawase was very fresh and much appreciated. We will be back."
Good Unagi,"This is not your regular sushi restaurant or supermarket unagi. That would be like comparing a fast food burger to a gourmet burger.
Lightly crisped skin with succulent tender flakes of unagi flesh is complemented with good Japanese rice and just the right amount of special sauce."

One Of The Best I Tasted So Far,"Unagi rice bowl is one of the current big thing in Japanese Cuisine here in Singapore. There are many outlets, offering freshly grilled eel, where there’s perpetual long queue but I find the quality just so so.
But this one tucked away slightly off Orchard rd in Wheelock Place is the most delicious I have tried so far. RSVP advised also.
The unagi rice set comes in medium or large size. And both are served with condiments, dashi broth and a clear soup. You are advised to try the eel on its own, then next with the condiments provided. The 3rd way to eat is to mix it with the dashi broth, and lastly with the special house pepper. Personally, the eel is so fresh, well seasoned and cooked, I can just have it own it’s own. It literally melts in your mouth. Best part is the special sauce they use is not too sweet. But do try the other ways of eating it, it does add different dimension to the fish.
Be warned though, the menu is quite limited in choices although there are other rice bowls and salads to choose from. But hey, the eel (unagi) is the highlight! Go for it!"
Perfect bowl of unagi,It’s charcoal grilled on the spot upon ordering. The fish is tender with bits of crispiness. The restaurant recommended 4 ways of eating it. I suggest just eating from the bucket of rice. It’s perfect by itself. No other condiments are required. The service crew is incredible. We were given a private room yet our cups are never left empty. They will always check and make sure that the tea or water are timely refilled. They didn’t chase us out even after their closing time. Instead they let us stay for a while more while they clean the outside area. Thumbs up for the service and food! Will certainly recommend this to everyone.
Sauce taste just right,The sauce on the unagi sweetness is just right . Not overwhelming. It would be perfect if they provide the Japanese powder pepper . The one they have need to grind before I can use .
Value for Money,"First time visiting and the environment was cosy and nice. Though my original table arrangement was not ready but the staff quickly found another option for me and even kindly advised that the area might be a little warm, which was actually ok!

As it was out first visit, we ordered the Signature and the food service was pretty fast. There are 4 different ways and all were equally good and brings out the different flavour and taste of the Unagi.

Worth the price and try and I'll definitely return back! Highly recommended!"
Unagi Hitsumabyshi,Authentic Unagi. Fine and excellent BBQ Unagi. Try their signature Hitsumabushi. You can eat into 3 ways... Including Ochazuke. 👍
Lovely experience,"It was our first time trying this. The food was served quickly and the staff have a good knowledge of the food. They were very polite and prompt in service too. Overall, a wonderful experience!"
Perfectly grilled eel and lovely ambience,"Customer service is good - polite staff.
The ambience was nice, especially if you sit under the (fake) maple tree.
Food was delicious and the unagi was well grilled.
I ordered a small Unagi bown and a cold Yuzu drink - it cost about $35 SGD."
Very fresh eel,"We were very excited to hear that Nagoya eel place is in Singapore. Was told that eel is crispy & better than the another famous EEL place, however was disappointed that it wasn't crispy at all.

Also found that they had a lot of bones, quite unlike the ones we had in Japan.

All in all eel was very fresh but not sure if we'll be back so soon."
Uya Singapore - Japanese Unagi,Unagi is prepared with a bit more charred texture comparing to Man Man. Also seems like more effort is placed in removing the bones. Gets packed really quickly so it’s better to either make a reservation or be there early.
Yummy unagi,"Went to Uya to try their unagi especially the highly raved Hitsumabushi Set. The unagi is soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. The skin is grilled till it is slightly crispy yet not burnt. They added yuzu peel to their seaweed soup which is very refreshing. Their yuzu drink is also nice with a bit of sweetness, I like that it is not overly sweet like many of those I’ve tried at other places."
Worthy Meal,"I'm a Unagi lover! Tasted the signature dish, Hitsumabushi, it was really good! The service was absolutely fantastic! Will definitely visit often!"
Pretty Good,We had both unagi n sashimi. Sashimi was fresh and I enjoyed it. Unagi was quite good but thought there were not enough garnishing and the dashi wasn kind of warm but not hot..pricing wise I thought it was on the higher side..
Best live unagi that you can eat in a wonderful environment! No need for stupid q!,Been to Uya a few times. It’s a bit pricey but it’s good food and I can reserve through Chope seats rather then standing around and waiting. This is very important as it’s shows respect for your customers’ time and support.
Excellent food. OK pricing,Book with Chope and get 10% discount. The food was good . Not too expensive. Had the premium Shashimi - great
Delicious food but waiting time can be pretty long,"The unagi is very fresh, grilled crispy on the base and tender on the inside. Sashimi is very fresh too. Food is on the pricey side though."
Yummy Hitsumabushi,"Made a reservation through chope and managed to use multiple chope vouchers. The unagi is as good as man man’s and the unagi egg roll is better here. Ventilation is much better too. Oh, you can also use shopback go here! (:"
Unagi at Orchard,"The restaurant is famous for the unagi. I ordered the Hitsumabushi which was too salty for me when eating without adding anything. The taste is better when I added the soup in. The price is too expensive comparing to the “thin” unagi size (35sgd for size M, service charge and vat not incleded yet) . The portion is about right though.

Anyway, The restaurant is located in the center of city- the building is connected to mrt Orchard.
The food take some time before it is served, so it is not a choice if you are in rush."
Good but salty,"I loved the crispy fresh eels that's flavorful. However, they were all too salty, which left a bit of bitter aftertaste. The dishes weren't cheap too; $33 for a medium sized bowl with soup and small plate of salad."
Yummy,"Love the place, it's convenient, conducive and fresh :) ! The staff service is super good too, would definitely go back again!"
Eel was overgrilled,"If you have visited Man Man before then Uya probably isn't as good. Ordered their signature bowl and my eel was over grilled. It was dry and it tasted more burnt than the char-grill kind of taste. The eel liver portion was really small as well. About $40 spent per person, I think there are better options."
Unagi Restaurant,Truly enjoyed the Unagi Hitsumabushi. Authentic taste 1 comparable to top Unagi restaurants in Tokyo and Kyoto. 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍
Best Eel In Town,"Second visit in 3 months... the signature Eel with rice is excellent. If need a big lunch , order the Large set and enjoy every bite of it. Excellent service but can't understand 2 mins to 12... still can't let me in ....."
Great dinner place!,The food was great. Enjoy the time and food during at the time. Will go back again with my family for more!
Yummy Unagi,Food was good and service was even better! Advise to make reservation as the queue can be quite long.
Delicious,Their unagi rice set is very delicious! A bit pricey but worth to try! I enjoyed to eat with dashi and their wasabi is very fresh! Staff are friendly and nice! Restaurant atmosphere is cozy!
Excellent food quality and service.,The food quality excellent and the staffs are very attentive. The staffs seems to know what you will need (e.g. replacement chopstick after dropping) and attend to it almost immediately. The overall ambiance is nice and cosy.
Well...,"The food was very good, but the service, in particular the front desk reception, really needs to change. Yes, change, not improvement, because I think the present people manning the reception simply do not understand what service is and are hence beyond improvement. The good was really good, so it’s a shame."
Great service and wonderful food,I have the rare wagyu beef bowl and the as usual the beef was nicely seasoned and the egg was nice and flowing. Second time I'm here and definitely be back.
Great food,"I went with my family on a Sunday night. The hisamitsu set was superb as usual. Unagi was crispy unlike the usual that is found at other restaurant. One thing to know is that this crispy unagi can only be found in this set. Service was good, the waitress out in effort even though they were busy."
Good Unagi around Orchard,"Went on a Saturday night dinner. Booked the place for 7pm and got the private room.
I guess it is better because the place is not that big and our group was rather noisy.
We ordered 2 types of Unagi set, 1 that is served whole (not cut) and the other type that was already cut. The one that is cut is slightly more expensive.
The Unagi was tasty, slightly dry. Personally I would prefer it slightly more moist and more sauce but I guess it's just different ways of cooking. The set comes with pickles and soup. The difference between the 2 sets is that the whole Unagi set served with salad and the other one is served with a broth to make soup after the meal.
Oh we also ordered the Unagi Tamago, which is fluffy and filled with tasty Unagi.

Overall we enjoyed our visit. Service was good too."
Comfortable enjoyable meal,"Ambience great with polite service staff who gave good info on menu
Seating was generous providing a pleasant dinning experience
Unagi was tasty, especially the 4 options to taste the unagi
The sashimi was fresh n the premium dish
is just good for 2 persons.
Sake could have been Warner but the container used does not keep it warm due to the open spout
Overall a pleasant meal n great dinning experience"
Over rated,"My unagi is not too grilled... Waitresses cleared the empty plates so fast once the chopsticks put down... Feel unwelcoming ... like as if"" Faster eat, faster go"""
Pretty good unagi,"I have tried unagi from Man Man and Unagi Ichinoji this year and to complete my review of where’s the nicest unagi in Singapore, the last place I had yet to check out was Uya at Wheelock. Went there on a Sunday evening for dinner and there was no queue when we arrived before 7pm. Inside the restaurant, it was probably 50% filled.

I order the $35 medium set while my friend ordered the $48 large set. I read a few reviews earlier this year where most of the votes went to Man Man. However time and experience taught me never to judge based solely on reviews. One should personally try in order to gauge the standard. Thus I am glad I did for Unagi Ichinoji and Uya.

Uya’s unagi was well grilled to a crispy and wasn’t overly crispy (some may termed it chao-tar). The unagi was flavorful and meaty as well.

Of the 3, Uya is the most conveniently located. Price-wise, it is also the most expensive as compared to Man Man (S$25.80 for medium) and Unagi Ichinoji (S$26.80 for medium).

Would I return here? Probably if I am craving for good unagi and won’t want to waste time queuing at Man Man or travelling to Robertson Quay for Unagi Ichinoji."
Excellent service and food,"The food was excellent, and service crew was very attentive. I would come back again to try other items on the menu."
My favourite Grilled Eel(Osaka style) in Singapore,"I like Grilled Eel done a certain way. I like it grilled dry. Sprinkled with a bit of salt. Not slathered with sauce. This place has done this very well. Dry, crispy on the outside, while the meat of the eel is moist. Just perfect. And the sashimi there is very good quality too. I like sushimi of a certain thickness & texture. This is very well balanced here."
Enjoyable Food Experience,"We found the combination of signature eel, sashimi and tempura made an interesting meal combination. The wasabi was very good too. Unfortunately, it is not a hang out place. Eat and go."
