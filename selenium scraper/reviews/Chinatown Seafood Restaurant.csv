Good quality and good value,I eat here regularly when I am in Singapore. The prices are good and the quality of food and service is also good. Great location especially for people watching
Singapore Cilli Crab,We didn't know what to expect. Bring paper towels or a wet washcloth! It's messy. It's tasty. Order the bred to go with it. Roll up your sleeves. Have some cold beers and dive in.
Big trouble in little China- for the crab at least,Whenever we visit Chinatown we have to visit here - if you want Singapore Chili crab this is the place… the food is freshly prepared example if you order dumplings these are made from scratch
Lovely Music,We came on a rainy night for a dinner to this restaurant and surprise with their choose music. My whole family enjoyed the cold night but with warmth heart.
Very good!,"Nice atmosphere, good music, good service, good food as well. The people were nice and is clean! A little bit expensive, especially drinks , but it seems is all Singapore like that."
"Great Restaurant in Chinatown, highly recommended","Had dinner at Chinatown Seafood Restaurant tonight, whilst in Singapore. As the name suggests it's in Chinatown . Happened upon it whilst strolling & the staff were very friendly. Lots to choose from on the menu, I had the Spicy Prawns & some plain rice. The food came ot very fast & was great and reasonably priced. I'd eat here again"
THERE'S A FLY IN MY MEAL,"Oh dear, what terrible service at this restaurant, which is a shame as the food generally was very good, apart from finding a fly in our bean dish. As compensation we we were offered one drink each, but as I already had 2 beers, all I got free was the fly. We even had to pay for the dish. Do not expect any service here. I have only ever given one 2 star review in my previous 217, and only gave this one 2 because most of the food tasted good, if spicy."
Horrible service and food,Rude service staff. Won’t show menu. Won’t help is seating. Won’t even give the bill and take money. You have to beg for everything. Horrible service. Bad food. Don’t see locals here for same reason I suppose. A place to be avoided
Best Chilli crab in Chinatown,"After a hot day walking through Chinatown this turned out to be a great spot out of the sun to enjoy a delicious Singapore Chilli Crab to complete our trip to Singapore!

Staff were super attentive and food tasted good."
"Average food, awful service.",Especially one waitress who served us was quite rude. We asked for new cutlery (for the new food we have just ordered) and she said we already have on our table. Avoid this place at all costs.
Average on all counts,"The rules during the pandemic change regularly. Unfortunately, at this outlet they change even more often. Each time I've visited I've had to re-learn the rules. I think they just make them up according to who is there at the time. As an added bonus, the staff are quite surly and their service isn't much better.

Like many other reviewers have recommended, there are far better offerings in the area. That's where I'll be going from now on."
Tourist trap,"This is the sort of place that doesn't care if you come back a second time. As long as they get you in the door the first time. Signs on the street claiming happy hour, suddenly no longer apply (why they just don't take away adverts for prices which no longer apply is up to you)."
BREEZY OUTDOOR JOINT WITH EXCELLENT SERVICE. 3rd Visit.,"Food(Lite bites) to pair with their well chilled Premuim Suntory Beer and Wines were really awesome. Every dishes were delicious,well prepared and all reasonably priced. Must try their beef satay, fried enchovies, etc.
We were not just very impressed with the just the food but also service rendered by their staff.
Look out for the gentlemen, Ah yeow, Siow Chen & Jenny. They are accomodative, attentive and forthcoming. Will help you with food and drinks selection. Kudos to them.
This place is outdoor, however, surprisingly breezy and cooling.Thumps up!"
We really enjoyed our repeat lunch experience here.,"For our 40th wedding anniversary my wife and I enjoyed an 18 day Asian tour from 28 December 2019 to 14 January 2020 taking in short stays in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and Laos and concluding with three nights in Singapore.

On one of our free days in Singapore we took the MRT metro to Chinatown, one of our favourite places we always like to visit when we stay here. We were looking for a place to have lunch and remembered that we had really enjoyed lunch at the Chinatown Seafood Restaurant in Pagoda Street five years earlier in January 2015. So, we decided to “chance our luck” and have lunch here again this time round. We were not disappointed.

The Chinatown Seafood Restaurant is a large establishment catering for both locals but especially lots of tourists. Although calling itself a Seafood Restaurant, seafood no doubt being its speciality, the place caters for all tastes and offers one of the biggest range of foods we have ever encountered in an eating place anywhere. They have these colourful laminated menu cards with all the dishes and their prices listed and a photograph of every dish so customers understand what they are ordering. This was certainly appreciated by us and I am sure also by many of our fellow tourists. The prices are also quite reasonable by Singapore standards.

There are crowds of people in Chinatown at any given time throughout any day of the year and the day of our visit was no exception. As such, we were really pleased this time round that the staff gave us a front table right adjacent to the street, because we were able to enjoy our favourite pastime of “people watching” by watching the many tourists and locals walking up Pagoda Street, while we ate our meal. A signature feature of this eating place are the many bright yellow plastic chairs adding a splash of colour to the establishment.

For lunch we chose a plate of Yangzhou Fried Rice and a plate of Sweet and Sour Pork to share. The food was plentiful and very well cooked and tasted great. My wife had a Tiger Beer with her meal and I had a repeat of my experience here in 2015 by really enjoying their version of a Singapore Sling. The service was efficient with the food and my wife’s Beer arriving in a timely manner. The same, however, could not be said for my Singapore Sling which arrived quite late after we had completed our meal. Never mind, it did arrive eventually and the staff did apologise and as we were on holidays anyway, we were happy to simply stay longer here soaking up the atmosphere. I must say the Singapore Sling was worth the wait.

The Chinatown Seafood Restaurant is really geared up for the tourist and the staff members are very good at what they do in making the tourists feel welcome and contented.

The Chinatown Seafood Restaurant is becoming one of our favourite Singapore eating places. We really enjoyed our repeat lunch experience here at this Restaurant and we look forward to calling again when we next stay in Singapore."
Not just Seafood,"This is right across from the Chinatown Heritage Museum and I popped in for lunch afterward on a day when it was pouring rain.

Now firstly, I do not eat seafood, so what was I doing eating at a seafood restaurant and secondly, why am I giving it a 5 star rating?

Well, because there are plenty of non-seafood options on their impressive menu and the food is authentic and delicious. I ordered Chinese Xiaolongbao dumplings and Sichuan beef and rice (just spicy enough/perfectly peppered) which were both amazing. They also did an excellent latte and I was very well attended to by the staff despite it being rather busy.

I highly recommend this place whether you like seafood or not."
Great Lunch Experience,"Walked down to Chinatown and had dim sum at Ba Dao Guan or Chinatown Seafood Restaurant. We were looking for a place to have dim sum for lunch. They were on a corner location and offered several craft beer options by
Archipelago Brewing. We tried the veggies and fried noodles, BBQ pork buns, Satay chicken with peanut sauce and the veggie dumplings. All were very tasty and quite filling. With the outdoor seating you can watch the tourists and shoppers go by while you enjoy your lunch."
Great seafood,We have been to this restaurant every time we come to Singapore lately and you can not go past the food and the cold beer with good prices .the service is not great no smiles very ordinary at the best each time I might add so that’s not new but the cook does something right as we keep coming back so do many others it’s always busy .The food is great large serves good prices and cold beer . Is it so hard to smile your making money
The best meal I had in Singapore this trip,"We had got on the metro to Chinatown. We were last there in 1998, despite visiting Singapore in 2003. We wandered around the streets, enjoying the shops and decided that we would have lunch. We looked at several places but at the Seafood Restaurant we could sit outside in the shade and relax.

Our meal was very simple; pork dumplings and fried rice with egg and a few things. It was served very quickly and was excellent. We had two glasses of wine each and some coffee at the end of the meal. It was not expensive and there was plenty of it."
Great food,This place was extremely friendly and food was beyond tasty. Very clean and helpful to foreigners. Free wifi and reasonable prices
Minor thing made 5 to 4 - food was great!,4 because wine wasn’t what ordered - food and service was excelent - Xia Long Bao was greatest ever. Also Tom Jam with steamed rise - was great based on Tom Jam fans. Our group enjoyed a lot - also Veggies Dumplings worth to try - You should try this place!
The place to go for chilli crab,"Food is great but the service is average. We ordered chilli crab, Singapore char kway teow, szechuan spicy chicken, gong bao chicken, sweet and sour pork, yangzhou fried rice, shrimp dumplings and pork dumplings."
Good food with people watching,"A restaurant with good, tasty, reasonably priced food where you can enjoy watching locals and tourists walking up and down Pagoda Street. Highly recommended."
Must try place to eat crab.,Must try place to eat crab. We tried pepper crab and it’s amazing. Craft beer is expensive but worth for 7.5 SGD(600ml)
Chilli mud crab,I’ve been here a few times now and the food is cooked to perfection. I ordered the chilli mud crab and it’s been perfect every time. The service is great and it’s a great atmosphere.
Mark Blake,"Was recommended to us by a resident friend and didn’t disappoint. It occupies a corner plot and is outside so great for people watching while you are eating. Busy a pretty basic, with no frills, but the food is superb, and very reasonably priced. Take care before ordering the black pepper crab dish - although it was amazing - it doubles the price of our meal ( it was unpriced on the menu as the price varies daily and depends on the season/availability ), but for any crab lover like me, it’s a must. I now realise that I could have gone for a half crab! Do use the bibs provided, as you’ll need the protection....."
"Trust me, there are better food offerings within the area","My colleague and I, both local Singaporeans, were in Chinatown to pickup something. We wanted something quick for lunch so we stopped by here since it was the first food place we came across on our way to the MRT station.

First, service was horrible - maybe it is because we are locals. Nobody looked happy to serve us (well, except the cashier for obvious reasons). We ordered a Singapore Vermicelli to share. It was the worst vermicelli i've ever tasted. The zhi char stall near my HDB flat is so much better. Anyway, was told they charge service fee (to quote a certain Time Person of the Year 2019 - ""How Dare You!"") and GST

Second, i thought of ordering the shrimp dumpling (dim sum) but noticed on the menu that each serving was 8 pieces. So i asked if they offered smaller servings, like 2 pieces. She smirked at me and ask me which place sells dim sum in 2 pieces. I said well the smaller dim sum shops in food courts and coffeeshops do. She said they are not a coffeeshop, they are a restaurant. And she repeated again that they charge service fee and GST. So i said fine, i wont order the shrimp dumpling then.

Anyway, this will be my first and last time ever eating at this place. Yes it is clean, yes it is in the middle of the street, good location for people watching, but there are TONS of other eateries in and around Chinatown. I'm sure you can find something tastier and at better prices within a 2 min walk.

Avoid this tourist trap at all cost!"
Excellent food,"Very tasteful food, simply excellent. Quick service. Wine by glass or bottle. Would definately eat here again."
An experience,"We were only 2 people and were seated at a table up front, perhaps because it was early afternoon and they weren't crowded. It was quite the view to watch all the goings on at Pagoda Street! The service was fast, friendly, helpful. Big menu so it took a while to figure it out. We had pork dumplings, green beans, stir fry chicken and garlic shrimp. The shrimp were just OK because they were cooked in a lot of water and it diluted the flavor but the rest of the food was standard Chinese fare. It is quite the experience to eat here!"
"Good spot for people watching, food not great.","Good spot for people watching. Plastic tables, chairs and plates, didn’t feel very clean and the food came out alarmingly quickly, highly doubt it had been freshly cooked. Our food arrived before our drinks and it was just ok- wouldn’t go back and wouldn’t particularly recommend."
Worlds best fried honey squid!,"The Seafood restaurant in China Town very Crowdy. But it’s definitely worthwhile a visit!

The honey glazed baby squid tasted like heaven!!
And the red roasted pork and dim sums were delicious.

The service was fast and friendly.

They forgot to serve the white rice.
So that’s a little thing to improve."
Only interested in big tables!,"They gave the 3 of us a terrible table, I had a signboard right in front of my face, then when I asked to change tables they moved us to the back in the corner with the crates telling us all other tables are “reserved”. Only to see them seat two males they coaxed in at a table we (a party of 3) asked to move to.

It was my family’s first visit to Singapore and I wanted them to taste the Chilli crab, we were in Chinatown and this place was highly rated.

The food was average and when we asked for more rolls they had to call someone more senior to take the order??

Plenty of other spots in Singapore to order good crab and good food, I won’t be coming back here again."
Unfriendly staff and cold food,We tried to get a table for two but they were only interested in seating large groups. We persevered and got squeezed into a table under fans . We had to attract staff attention to get a menu. Starters arrived at the same time as the main course which was cold noodles. We sent them back and they were like rubber and most likely overheated in a microwave. Not impressed and would not recommend.
Our nth time here in this,"Our nth time here in this restaurant for beer and appetizers. We had crispy honey squid, steamed garlic prawns, pork satay and so much tiger beer which made the experience such fun."
Did not live up to billing,"Visited for late lunch. Not allowed to sit at table with a view as we were only two. Staff very unfriendly and impatient for us to order.
Had satay chicken, was ok. Duck leg however did not at all resemble picture. Rice was, well rice. Should have taken MRT. To Clarke Quay for better choice and service"
Nice lunch,"Place is nice. Staff are friendly and decent. Food is good.
We ordered lobster shrimp and noodles. Noodles was average though they said it's one of their most recommended plates. Shrimp was nice but a bit sweet because it was with cereal. We didn't know it wud be sweet. Lobster was good"
Avoid!! Unfriendly and rude staff!,"We saw the Tripadvisor sign with great reviews outside this restaurant and decided to give it a try. With no one around outside we walked inside only to be ushered out by an elderly lady(whom I think may have been the owner) & told to get the pram out of here! I understand things can be lost in translation and there are cultural differences but this was plain rude. Once we stepped outside a very grumpy looking waitress passed us a couple of times yet no one communicated with us regarding a queue or wait time for a table. We decided to leave and spend our money in a lovely, friendly restaurant along the street."
Chinatown Seafood Restaurant,"Cannot fault this restaurant at all....fast service, the staff were very friendly and the food was amazing"
Nothing special,"We came here for lunch and ordered roast duck, fried rice, kangkong and beef pepper. It was ok but nothing really special about the meals. Bit pricey for what you get. Friendly service."
Very good food and good service,"Surprised to see some of the recent bad reviews of this restaurant. I found this restaurant when I was in Singapore 2 years ago and the food was the best we had in Singapore on that visit.
Therefore, when returning I had to go back and try again and was not let down. First thing I noticed is that the place has expanded and taken over some more premises on the other side of the road but was still very very busy however we got a table quick enough.

The food was still very good although not as good as my previous visit. However, it was still very good and portions were very big (probably too big really as saw quite a few tables with food being left).

It is good value for money compared to a lot places in Singapore.

The service was quick and good. Therefore, I would definitely recommend this restaurant."
Poor food and service,"Not the place to come if you want authentic singaporean food, unless you just want to drink. Coupled with poor service, this’s a place to avoid"
Terrible service!,"We arrived in Singapore yesterday and after a walk around Chinatown last night and seeing how busy this restaurant was, we decided to go for lunch today. The waitress was extremely unfriendly and did not make us feel welcome. We ordered our food, others who's orders were taken after ours received their food quite quickly, both tables next to us ordered a variety of different dishes, we just ordered seafood fried rice, satay chicken and HongKong Noodles. The rice and satay were brought to the table after about 10 minutes, we do not mind waiting for good food, after another 5 minutes the noodles had still not arrived, my husband said excuse me 3 times to the miserable waitress but she ignored him. We wanted to eat our food together but my husband told me to start before my food got cold. We finally spoke to the waitress who said sternly it's coming. I heard a gentleman on the table next to us comment how miserable the waitress was and another lady on another table said i don't know why people come here, the service is terrible! After 30 minutes from ordering the food, and i had almost finished my meal, another waitress brought out the Noodles, my husband asked why did he have to wait so long and the waitress said because they had to be cooked! Tables around us also had Noodles but we had ordered first! The Noodles were not hot, it seemed like they had been sat for a while and not cooked fresh. My husband only ate half of them as i had already finished my meal and the Noodles were not good! I got up to go to the toilet and the miserable waitress practically threw the bill at us! My husband said he was not happy but nobody seemed to be bothered! In the UK if a Customer complains they would usually knock off the price of the substandard meal. We paid the bill and left. I would definitely not recommend this restaurant, the service is appalling!"
Horrible,"I have been served many times and it is rear that I meet staff so bad. Screaming and shouting- replacing customers with rude attitude. Bad cooked dishes to a prices you wont believe. We had get removed a dish because it smelling and tasting so bad we could not stand it. But they required I had to pay anyway. It was horrible- simply horrible.
Absolutely NOT worth to waste time and money on."
You won’t be disappointed,Chinatown lots to choose from but don’t walk past .. delicious food .. reasonable prices .. fast service .. friendly and chatty staff.. we loved it.. nothing was to hard ! Open until midnight .. which helped
Very ordinary gone downhill,"We have been to this restaurant many times and have enjoyed their chilli crab.
On this occasion we were greeted by a very surly waitress who demanded we sit where she wanted us. Not a smile except for her fellow workmates.
The meal was reasonable not hot but the crab was tough. There was no finger bowl to clean your hands and only a box of paper tissues which are hopeless when trying to clean your hands. When we asked for a finger bowl we were told we don’t do that anymore."
Amazing,So on a hot shopping day we called here for a drink then later were recommended to eat here and I have to say it was amazing the staff are lovely the food was perfect if you are in Chinatown you need to eat here
Awful,"Very slow service even if the terrace was empty, we were 5 of us by the time the last one of us got the food the rest w
as finished. One dish had more chilli than chicken, and all the staff was ignoring us, we got the main first then the starters then the soup.
Never recommend never go back !"
Very yummy battered prawns,"We were advised to look in Chinatown and what a treat
It’s very pretty, lively and fabulous choice of food. Our battered prawns and prawn and vegetable vermicelli, 2 beers and a fresh apple juice cost $57) Well worth it
We also visited Buddhist Temple of the tooth ( Remember you need to be respectful... ladies must be covered .., no short sleeves or short skirts ... I bought a long skirt and a scarf from a nearby shop for $14 ...)"
More than just seafood,"Being allergic to seafood I was a little put off by the name of the restaurant, but after inspecting the menu I was pleasantly surprised. The staff were helpful and fast, it started spitting with rain and we were swiftly moved to an undercover table before the downpour hit! The food had great flavours and we were right in the middle of Chinatown."
Very busy,"We've been here on multiple occasions over the years. The chilli crab is one our favourites, as well as Tiger beer in an ice bucket.
BUT................... they now run the place opposite as well, it's very busy and the service has gone to the pack.
What a shame, have to look for somewhere else. When I come to Singapore, go to Chinatown, and get Singapore Crab......... We want it right!"
Must visit despite the bumps.,"We visit Singapore quite regularly.
I pre empt my comments by saying this is a must place to eat despite some bumps.
The location is wonderfull on a corner spot on Pagoda street. This wraps you in the atmosphere of the Chinatown vibe.
The service is friendly bu when busy the kitchen struggles to get all your dishes at once.
In fact more often than not you get them at regular intervals just long enough to render the first one cold if you wait for the second so dig in .If you wonder if noodles or rice are better with the amazing Nonya curry chicken then dont worry as neither will be there at same time anyway. Most anoying is that the food is soooooo good that none of that matters. So do yourself a favour. Go there, sit down. And order (as the sign sais) a large or a small pint of Tiger beer and enjoy one of the best meals you can have in Singapore."
AWFUL SERVICE,we didn’t even get to eat the food as we had a bad encounter with one of the waitresses. We initially went to the restaurant but then decided to walk through china town before eating. Once we returned she was extremely rude and disrespectful and proceeded to shout at my friends and I upon our entry to the restaurant saying that we should look at the menu and decide what we want to eat before we sit down. I then informed her that I had looked at the menu already but she continued to shout and tell us we couldn’t sit down. I wouldn’t recommend due to the shocking service.
Keep Walking. Poor service,"The food is not so great. So I would not recommend it as an authentic experience.
Service was very poor.
They kept insisting we move our chairs and table to make room for them to walk past.
Quite a grumpy and unhappy waitress
Ruined our luck.
Won’t be back."
Awesome Chinese Seafood Cuisine,I tasted seafood there on 6th September. The environment and taste of food were awesome. We enjoyed a lot.
Good price; good taste,"Visited on Sunday lunch. Ordered chili crab, watermelon crush n mango & banana smoothie.
Great and fresh crab; sweet and spicy sauce! Excellent experience!
Authentic vibe. Watermelon crush helped to cool down the spice.
Highly recommended!"
"Excellent prawn fritters , not very welcoming service","We had excellent prawn fritters here, had to order a second portion they were so good. The gung bao chicken was lovely. Chicken satay was nice as was the seafood fried rice."
Very nice,"Food was very tasty, nice place to Eat and have some beers.
I recommend it.
Try the seafood! Not too expensive too"
"Good food, horrible attention!","We stop there for a break and for drinking a beer and eating a small thing, the place had a lot of free tables on the terrace but they didn’t allow you to sit in order to attract tourist let them think the terrace is free.

Additionally we were 3 and order a big bottle of beer they just brought us 2 glasses and we request for a third one and they denied it because big bottles maximum for two people, we stood up from the table and the waitress scolded us because we where leaving, we explained them why we were going and finally they give us the 3 glass.

Service was terrible and food was ok!"
Well worth a visit!,"We were visiting Chinatown and happened upon this restaurant. We had the Chilli
Crab which it is well known for. Not disappointed at all. Thoroughly enjoyed it!! The lovely lady (I think owner) was wonderful, she seated us and recommended well! Try sitting outside as the atmosphere of Chinatown and the restaurant is most enjoyed this way!! Only wish we had time to return to try the other dishes. Next time definetely!!
Thank you!!"
Great food at reasonable price,"Food and drink were reasonably priced. The food was very tasty and there was a great atmosphere, try and get a table on the street side and soak in the atmosphere.
We avoided the seafood here as it was priced similar to a more uptown type of restaurant similar to Jumbo seafood."
Amazing mouth licking food,"I stayed for a whole 4 nights in Singapore, and during those four days I visited this restaurant twice, this is one of the oldest restaurants in Singapore who serves best Singapore Chilli crab."
"Great foods, nice Res.","I like Chinese food, though there are many restaurants in Singapore. With my sense, I quickly find this place. Grill seafood make me happy :)"
Poor Value for Money,"We visited at 11pm as the place seemed pretty lively, but quickly realised one should never judge a book by its cover.

The food took about 40 minutes to come out as they only had one chef and the portions were tiny considering the $16 SGD I paid for the Szechuan pork belly the waitress recommended. The food didn't taste authentic, would try somewhere else to get a late-night Chinese food fix."
Do as you are told!,A fun place to eat as long as you do as you are told! Just queue in the right place! Love it! Great laksa. Easy to find.
Terrible wait,"Ordered a roast duck curry which took over 40 minutes to arrive. The worst bit is they served the rice as soon as it was ready so it was cold and hard by the time the food had arrived. My colleague ordered a different dish and had his meal served the same time as the rice, so he was finished a good 30 minutes before me!"
Seafood @ Singapore Chinatown,Excellent choice! Found by luck! Until I saw the “The Trip Advisor” sign and I look it up! Excellent choice! Went there twice while in Singapore! Good prices! I’m from the Caribbean so I’m very familiar with seafood and the prices! Good portions and fresh! Always full thou... unless you go early in the afternoon before the night market hours begins! You’ll not be disappointed!
Always a favourite,"Been off the plane less than 3 hours before we were back here. Always go when we visit Singapore and never disappoints. Had cold beer, prawns, gung Po chicken and a selection of dumplings . The XLB were brilliant - don’t bother with din tai fung, these were better. Had pork buns , shrimp dumpling and spring rolls as well . All very good dishes and a great spot to sit and watch the world go bay as well ."
Worst experience in Singapore so far,"Came here on our last night in Singapore. Service staff generally rude for a start.
The “fresh” coconut was clearly defrosted and in a plastic wrap which is outrageous for a country like Singapore, especially in the middle of Chinatown. We also ordered the shrimp dumplings which tasted like rubber out of a packet. To top it all off the bottle of water was so warm that it cooled down once on the table. Would not recommend. Not sure what the hype is about."
"Pricey Restaurant, Small Portions","An order of fried rice, chicken, wonton soup, and 3 bottled water cost $49 Singapore dollars. Although the food was good, the portions were small and pricey. Next time we visit Chinatown, we will opt for the hawker center with its wide variety of tasty food at a fraction of the price!"
Nice experience,"I had been to the Singapore Seafood Restaurant in Chinatown several times during work trips and always liked it, but had never brought my family there until our vacation to Singapore in March. My wife, daughter, and I stopped in for lunch one day, and had a very nice experience. We sat at one of the plastic tables outside (but under a roof, so shaded). The service was good and friendly, and we thought the food was also very good. By the way, we consider ourselves to have fairly sophisticated tastes. We ordered several times as we explored the menu, and we were not rushed, so we were able to sit outside right along Pagoda Street, drink Tiger beer and eat Chinese food, and relax. The only negative is that the cost adds up. Our lunch for three people, with two beers, cost around $80.00 US Dollars. But considering you are eating in the heart of Singapore, which the Economist reports is one of the 3 most expensive cities in the world, and in a tourist area, higher prices should be expected. Long story short, we'd love to eat at the Singapore Seafood Restaurant in Chinatown again."
Singapore Chili Crab Deliciousness,"I'm surprised this place doesn't have more reviews, and better reviews. This is a great spot for mid-ranged priced chili crab, but still great quality. After hearing the Jumbo Seafood crab was overpriced, we opted for this option, as it was also highly rated on other sites. So glad we did!!

The restaurants is easy to find, very spacious, great food, friendly & quick service. Since this was just one of many meals we were having in Chinatown today, we opted to share the chili crab dish. So glad we did, as there was a ton of food. We both got beer from Singapore's Best Craft Brewery - Archipelago Brewery. The chili crab came out fairly quickly and looked absolutely beautiful!! We ordered 6 fried buns to help sop up the sauces and should have ordered 6 more! Super messy so make sure you wear the bib :)

Come here. Order the Crab. Wear the bib!"
Ok Chinese in a busy location in the heart of Chinatown,"This was my first attempt at food in Singapore after a lengthy three flights from Europe. Chinatown was nearby and just needed something suitable to get through the evening to then get some sleep.

This place stood out on a main thoroughfare through Chinatown due to all the tourists (like me).

Got seated and as others state it’s great for people watching. Staff are keen to get you in with good English and pushing the sales of higher costing beer. The place is not cheap despite this. However it appeared whilst walking around the area to be regular in comparison.

The cheaper dinners appear to be the hawkers options.

The menu has a lot of choices on it so should satisfy most people.

The food we had was fine. But in comparison to back home it was quite expensive. Be mindful you will be taxed afterwards on GST (7%) and also service charge (10%)."
Interrsting,"Nice ambience in crowded Chinatown Street.
Satay was good, although not as special. Staff is friendly"
Chili Crab,"I had an amazing meal here. Chili crab is a Singapore signature dish. I ate it twice while visiting Singapore and the chili crab served here was by far the best. Simple and unpretentious, open-air, plastic chairs, great food."
Great food in a pretty ordinary setting,After a tiring morning walking around Gardens by the Bay we were hungry and tired. Caught the Metro to Chinatown and walked for a couple minutes down Pagoda St from the station until we saw this place full of people eating plates piled high with food. I love Singaporean noodles and have tried it all over the world. This was up there with the best although it would have been nice to have been offered soy sauce or pepper. The dumplings seemed to be very popular too!
Great for people-watching,"I come here once or twice a year when stopping over between London and Sydney. A little touristy, and a little pricier than some, but great food, great ambience, friendly staff, and I get a table near the corner where I can enjoy the many nationalities exploring Chinatown."
Drinks and seafood lunch,Located in a great spot in chinatown where you can see whats coming or going..customer service was quick and efficent.the menu was average for a seafood resturant tho went for the pepper crab and a singapore sling for a drink.the crab had the right amount of pepper which i enjoyed tho something to.clean the hands like water or wet napkins would of been better then just tissues and the singapore sling could if done with abit more gin it it wasent very alcholic tho was a nice taste to it
2 consecutive nights,Great consistent food over 2 evenings in Singapore. Reasonably priced - great food. Staff though extremely busy were very attentive and engaging. My wife and thought this place was outstanding. Very good value for the money. Great stuff
Tasty and excellent food.,"Very good variety of selection. Loved chilled coconut drink. It was refreshing. Tasty food and service was good. In the midst of suveniour shops and closer to MRT.ideal place to shop and have a meal.
One may consider telling the service staff on how spicy your food should be. If not you would get very spicy.
Enjoyed our meal. Thank you."
Totally not worth it.,"Cons:
This is the worst seafood place I have been to. Ordered a number of dishes and 2 1kg crabs. Let's start with the crab, it was served to us in less than 10 minutes as the first dish, it was dry tough maybe steamed way beforehand for a prolong amount of time.
Secondly, Gong bao frog was really bad, sour as hell, not spicy at all. It's the first time I ate gong bao frog which tasted sour. And I can assure you that it's not the authentic taste.
Thirdly , chilli crab was sour. SOUR?!
What happened to the chef? Had a sour day?
Prawn and vegetable were alright.

Believe there's now enough reason to convince you to avoid this place at all cost, I shall skip the drinks review.

We are all local so we know what taste to expect, do not trust all the other tourist reviews. It might not taste horrible for them but definitely not any bit close to our Singapore dishes authentic taste.

Last but not least, AVOID. (I REPEAT)

PRO:
White rice tasted like rice.

Conclusion:
To be fair, customer service were fine too. This restaurant did not manage to satisfy our cravings. AT ALL."
Yummy,Good food and good service. Had the dim sum and noodles. Great people watching. The beer was cold. Would definitely come back.
Great place,The staff are amazing and the food is amazing. I would recommend this place to everyone. They are so friendly and very reasonably priced
Best meal I had in Singapore,"We had lunch on our last day in Singapore, was the best meal we had. We love Chinese food and the duck and sweet and sour pork with egg fried rice was incredible. Definitely recommend people to experience it including the markets"
Good food,"If you love people watching this is the place for you
Located on a prime corner in Chinatown you can sit and Drink a cold drink and eat some fabulous dumplings while you watch the world go by this is the best location !
Easy access just no air con so it gets HOT"
Rudest staff in Singapore,"The restaurant was half empty but was refused a prime seat on the street. Was shoved to a seat by the kitchen by a series of rude staff. When we requested alternative seats, they stated we take what they give us or we can go.

Don’t go there with a family or if you want a good memory of your visit to China Town.

If I was the owner of this establishment, I would be ashamed.

Rather believe the 1 and 2 star ratings. They are abusing the award of excellence from trip advisor."
Best chinese food,"We stumbled across this restaurant on our visit to China town. We had the best chinese food we've had in a long time. With an awesome Singapore sling we had sweet and sour pork, satay, rice, chicken and seafood. Service was amazing, food delightful and cheap. Locals were eating there too. Can't wait to go back."
Always good,This would be about the 5th time we have had lunch here over the years and it never fails to please. We ordered a veggie rice and beef noodle dish. Food arrived quickly and was very tasty. Well priced for a good lunch.
Great food but very poor service,The food was great but the service was very poor. Had to wait for food for so long and the waitress was so dude.
"Good food, well priced, great craft beer",Worth a visit for a sensibly priced meal with good beers from the Archipelago brewery. Good vegetarian options as well as meat and seafood staples.
It was poor,"We went specifically for the seafood but didn’t think it was anything soeacil.
I had the prawn wanton noodle soup which was pretty tasteless. My husband had the spring rolls which had very little filling and agin were tasteless. We shared crab fried rice which was no more than ok.
Would not go back"
"Great food , Good ambiance",We ordered black pepper crab and some veggies. All of which were yummy and was worth it. The location was perfect given that it is located at the middle of China town. Will come back again to eat at this place.
nice place for a drink if seated near street,"This place has an excellent location in the heart of Chinatown. If you manage to get a table near the end of the seating area (so close to the street), it is a very nice place for people watching while enjoying a cold drink.

The problem is that I did not manage to get a table close to the street. Although there were several empty tables close to the street, I was ordered by rude waitress lady to move to table close to the kitchen. This was not a good spot to enjoy the vibe of Chinatown.

Although I would not recommend this place for food (better, more affordable places and more variety available in the next street: Smith Street also known as Food Street), it is an excellent location for a drink if you get the chance to get table near street.

I gave this place a 2 star rating which is the reflection of 5 star location and low probability of getting the right spot (1 star) and rude attitude of waitresses (1 star).

I would recommend everyone who is in for a cold drink in Chinatown have a seat close to the street and don't be shy to give the waitresses a response in a similar way as they talk to you."
Seafood amazing,"What fantastic service, outside table to do some people watching. Picked off the menu Chilli Crab, lovely and not too spicey but it was the Spicey Prawns that we’re Devine. Service amazing and the cold Beer was great."
Great Food 👌🏽,"The food is delicious especially the seafoods, the staff are also friendly and accomodating. The restaurant loaction is very convenient as well for a tourist. Will definetly be back here."
An Asian food trip for me maybe?,"This must be good, a must try I'll save it on my list when I get to travel food looks Asian goody!!!"
So many food around and souvenirs,"We went to this town at evening just to look around and looking for food. Im totally like i know what to say. When i see the foods so many. Haha. I just love foods so much. There’s the vietnamese food, thai food, japanese and chinese here also have western food. For those who likes to buy souvenirs, so much here worth to buy. Especially the fengsui. Just come n visit here one of the popular place to visit."
Great eatery,"Every time we visit Singapore,about every two years,we eat here. It has to be our favourite place to eat,good food,cheap beer,fast service and a great place to people watch in the process. Highly recommended."
A wonderful experience. Top food,Very friendly service and EXCELLENT food. Restaurant is in front of the chinese heritage centre. We had spiced prawns and ginger clams after the prawn dim sums.
Good quick place to eat in Chinatown,"It is a good place to enjoy Chinese food in Chinatown. The menu offers a large range of choice. The food was served quickly just like we asked.
The service could have been nicer, a smile can do so much !"
"2017 Excellence, how?","The food wasn't good, and the waiter rude, they serve the wrong drink to me and won't change it, said that's what I order."
Snack and a Beer,"Picked here for a snack and a beer when we were visiting Chinatown. We shared spring rolls and chicken satay skewers both of which were tasty. The Tiger beer was served really cold in frozen glasses.
Service was efficient and friendly.
Seats are plastic but were ok.
The food and the beer was reasonably priced."
