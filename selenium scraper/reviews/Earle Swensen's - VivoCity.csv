Welcoming and helpful reception at entrance,"There was a short queue when my friend and I decided to pop in on a weekday night. Fortunately queue moved relatively fast and by the time it reached our turn, I was pleasantly greeted at the reception and quickly shown to a table. Staff who showed us in was helpful with some queries we asked about the menu and salad buffet, and was also frank enough to inform us in a diplomatic and polite manner that food would take some time, but we could help ourselves to the salad buffet first while waiting for our main courses. Would visit again based on the warm and helpful service received today."
