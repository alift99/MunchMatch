"Standards dropped over the years . Quality of food isn‚Äôt as good , better casual Jap dining options around.","Standard has dropped over the years. Quality isn‚Äôt maintained and pricing has been on the steeper side compared to Japanese restaurants of casual dining standards. Severely understaffed the last time I went . Didn‚Äôt have the best experience , likely won‚Äôt be coming back as there are many better options around ."
sarcasm service to new level,"dine in at sun & moon, and because we are troublesome customers which we accidently turn off the portable stove was set to high on one of the soup base dish and request the staff to assist to switch it back on and told him to turn it to the small heat as it was boiling over he made a sarcastic remark that the stove was bulid this way and cannot turn low. and i again was clumsy enough to drop my chopsticks and walk over and ask the same staff for replacement and he offered two pairs of chopsticks to me and mention you take one more pair incase you drop again. customer service sarcasm to the next level. male staff wearing spectacle. food was spoiled by the bad service given."

Overall we loved it for the food. Ambience is nice, but not exceedingly fantastic, and we had a slower customer service compared to the rest of the places we went. Overall still ok, maybe we caught them at a bad timing."
Average,"Third visit, salty main dish, aburi kaisen chirashi km set, assorted tempura was good, Maki not so good.
Fourth visit, salmon belly teriyaki and unagi kamameshi set, the unagi was okay, salmon not that fresh, tempura also not good.
For members, 20% off during birthday month.
Probably can visit once a year ?"
"Nice Tonkatsu, ambient count be improved","Food was not bad.
Will come back for tonkatsu.
Sashimi was fresh in the set meal was fresh.

On arrival hostess could action a little faster. Was left hanging at the entrance for a while
.
Ambient could be improved, it‚Äôs a little too noisy to enjoy the food."
Nice dinning but nosy,"Nice Japanese food. Except too nosy. If only they can make the corner room with more sound absorption items , the dinning experience will be much better. Hopefully they will take note of this comment and make changes"
Still Tasty,"It has been a while since we ate here and dinner was quite a good experience. The staff were very friendly and helpful, even when their ordering app on the Ipad had an issue.

Prices seem to have gone up quite a bit, but the quality is still there. The Australian Wagyu Harami don was pretty tasty, as was the Tori and Unagi Kamameshi set. Love the fact that the taste changes at the second serving with the pouring of the superb broth.

The salmon sashimi was very fresh as well."
Hearty Hokkaido Bento Set,"Visited Sun with Moon in December, after Christmas. We called ahead to make a reservation but no luck so we‚Äôd decided to walk in before the peak dinner hour, to try our luck.

We managed to get a table by the bar counter.

I had a Hokkaido Bento set which was on the promotion menu.

The set was visually stimulating and it came with a full set of salad (deep fried squid and mizuna salad), sashimi (tuna, scallop, shrimp), steamed egg with salmon roe, Hokkai sushi roll, another salad (egg roll with salted cod roe & potato salad), grilled atka mackerel and a mini Hokkaido ramen. And the set ended with a Otaru wine sherbet dessert.

It was a very satisfying dinner.

Staff were friendly and helpful."
"Nice food , good environment","The food is nice , the yuzu lemon is amazing, strongly recommend to try if keen to have non alcoholic drinks during your meal The Unagi sushi is one of the best I‚Äôve tried in Singapore"
Good dinner,"First visit, ordered the aburi kaisen chirashi km set, second visit, ordered the aburi kaisen bara chirashi. Both were equally good. Friendly service staff. You can pay SGD20 to join as a member and you get 10% off for subsequent visit."
Family Japanese Eatery,Family japanese eatery and popular with the locals. Price are mid range. Extensive menu and service is fast. Order from the iPad and the food will come as soon as it can. Special this month is the Aomori promotion. We ordered their Kamameshi special and appetisers and cheese cakes. Tasted good. Need reservations!
"Neither sun nor moon, just very popular","Everything here is average - food, service, pricing . Why is it always full? Hedge funders at Wheelock Place now work from their home swimming pool, so it must be all the nurses and assistants at the cosmetic clinics, while the docs go to Fat Cow at Campbell? For more character, go to Uya at level 2."
Renovated and menu slightly changed,"Seats were re-arranged, slightly renovated to accommodate the safe distancing! Menu was slightly updated but food great as ever. But i may not order their tonkatsu again as it was abit oily. Still love this restaurant!"
Make your reservations...,"Make your reservations because walk ins have limited tables and time to eat. Very popular among locals and japanese because the tastes is both fresh and tasty. Price is mid range, a friendly atmosphere and cozy environment. Extensive menu and a great place to entertain as well as for couples. Beer and sake is available. Convenient location too."
Lunch with good friends,"It was my first time trying the food in this highly recommended Japanese restaurant. As we were unsure of the portion of a set we decided to order just one set to share, green tea all around and 3 different types of desserts. The food is delicious and the desserts were interesting. The place is spacious and surprisingly there‚Äôs no table available for a few customers who did not make a reservation."
Great food and service,"They were full but since I was alone, she asked if I could be done by 1300, I was in a hurry too so I dined from 1200-1230. But they apologised for the rush! So polite and you definitely need to book before going. Food is VERY good!! I did a take away (they don't allow take a way for raw items FYI) but my friend said it was still yummy when it had turned cold. Very good staff and awesome food. Highly recommended!"
"If You Love Japanese Food, You Must Give This Place A Try",Came here for dinner and order the Ebi Tempura and Unagi Negi Toro Don set and the Aburi Kaisen Chirashi Kamaneshi Set. Both the sets were delicious and mouth watering. Service was simply impeccable.
Best Nabe and Kamameshi,"Best quality Japanese Nabe I've had. Both the beef and the seafood ones are perfect. Mix of crab, scallops and squid... heavenly. Top it up with a nice sake or suntory premium malt beer."
One of the first few places,One of the first few places we decided to dine at after circuit breaker. Delicious food and impeccable service. Will definitely come back again to try more dishes
Consistently very good and excellent service,Consistently very good and tasty food and excellent welcoming service. Best to make booking. Enjoyed the seasonal menu as always. Came for birthday month and will come again.
Nice dining experience,"I've always loved eating at Sun with Moon and yesterday was the first time I dined in after a long while. I really enjoyed yesterday's meal, because the food was great, ambience was great and service was great as well.

I ordered Nabe, and it was really good. I will like to commend on your service staff, especially Thomas, who was really friendly in his service. It's obvious that he knows his stuff well. He recommended the right soup base for my meal (it goes really well with it), and look out for all guests under the same area attentively, constantly asking if they need anything. It must be hard, especially when the place is bustling.

Overall, my dining experience was really wonderful!"
Skip home delivery,"Blimey, the quality of their food delivery and dine-in is like night and day.

Pre-covid, we were fans. We loved their sushi, brimming and loaded with flavour, yet oh-so-delicate.

Fast forward, we ordered in home delivery of 3 large portions of sushi. Although well-packed, the quality of the sushi was far from respectable. Chunky, crude and bland. It was quite difficult to swallow. Frankly, it felt like some supermkt-grade sushi takeaway.

Moral of the story, skip their home delivery altogether. It's been 3 months since we last dined in at restaurant itself so I seriously hope their standards have not dropped.

Perhaps when we're brave enough to mingle with the crowds during this pandemic, we'll get to see for ourselves."
Delicious wagyu,The food was delicious but I could not finish it because it was too much üò¢ Otherwise the food was great! It is one of the best beefs I had. That is the only reason I put four out of five. üëçüëçüèªüëçüèºüëçüèΩüëçüèæ
Early dinner!,"Went for early dinner at 1730hours. Was easy to get a table next to the glass facing Ion. An extensive menu, highlighting their Kamameshi. Ordered their 3 ways salmon sashimi, aburi hotate, kaizan Yukke, Hamachi kama, Temari sushi and aburi salmon roll. Taste was good and yummy. Presented well. Ordered their Dassai 45 to enjoy some sake. Environment is modern with an open kitchen. Price is mid to high range."
Always a pleasure,Frequent here almost when I‚Äôm in town. Food standards always never fails me. Wide variety and almost every dish is up to standards.
Nice Restaurant Suitable for Whole Family,One of our favourite Japanese restaurant in town. It has never failed our tastebud with their choices in the menu. Booking is strongly encouraged to avoid disappointment even on weekdays.
Good quality Japanese food,"This is a popular Japanese restaurant and one of our favourites. During our recent visit last Friday evening, we‚Äôd ordered a salad, assorted sashimi, prawn tempura and grilled pork with strawberry sauce.

The food at Sun with Moon were consistently of a high quality. I liked the grilled pork in particular, which tasted very well with the strawberry sauce. The sweetness in the strawberry made the grilled pork quite special.

Staff are friendly and efficient."
Fabulous food!,"This restaurant never fails to entice our tastebud with their fabulous culinary of Japanese food! Lots of choices in their extensive menu. Advance reservation is recommended, it‚Äôs crowded all the time."
Dinner for 3,"Service is prompt and good. Prior reservation is required to ensure you get to dine in there. Variety is wide, and food is fresh and very tasty. very value for money."
Birthday dinner,Made reservation 2 days in advance. First visit for hubby and both teens. We enjoyed the food and ambience. Waiting time for the food were not long. Nite that their dinner reservation has a time span. My booking was from 7.15pm to 8.45pm. Food was great. Will go again but reservation is a must.
Head to Wheelock Tower,Every in Singapore seems to be super busy at lunch times so if you time it right there are plenty of great places to dine. Sun with Moon being one of them and if you can get a window seat great views. The food is Japanese style and you get the usual selections but this time I did try the Kamameshi and it was super tasty. Worth going back for another tasting
Come for the dainty tasty potions & lovely ambiance,"They must be doing something right and I've a feeling it's simply because you're always assured a great, well-executed meal here every visit.

It's impressive how they've actually be in this same locale for a few decades now. Other tenants around them have come and gone but they've stayed & they still maintain the same decor and ambiance to this very day without feeling at all dated. Quite a feat indeed!

They have really great staples, for instance, umami-rich tasting sushi and maki. Plus, they certainly know how to keep things interesting with seasonal promotions.

Only one gripe. It's next to impossible to make last minute reservations cos they're so popular. Good for them!"
"Cozy place, delicious food!","Went there to celebrate my friend's birthday. The food was great!! If you like that 'homely ' style Japanese food, this is the place.
The service staff are great too! Seriously the older gentlemen who was the host at the entrance.

Do make a reservation in advance as this place is ALWAYS packed."
Good variety,"A pretty good Japanese restaurant in town, the selection is quite varied too. We celebrated our young nephew‚Äôs birthday there and the food we had were pretty yummy..however I felt that their service is not v friendly though..I bought a couple of tarts n asked my nephew to try one..the waitress came over n told us that we cannot have outside food. We understood the restaurant‚Äôs policy but we asked if he could juz finished the tart and I guess she wasn‚Äôt happy with the response n the next moment the supervisor came to tell us again lol.."
Good food but basic,"This is a casual place. The sushi‚Äôs were excellent, very tasty and fresh. The salmon was good but very fatty. The chicken was a little dry. Only 1 kind of wine, reasonable quality"
Good Japanese food,The restaurant serves good Japanese food as well as some western dishes like foie gras. They have food promotion from different parts of Japan. Will definitely return.
A delightful place,"I‚Äôve only been here twice so far, but I gotta say: I like this place. It serves generous set meals. The food is delicious. Service is attentive. The atmosphere is lively. (Excuse the poorly taken photo - I was famished - so I know it doesn‚Äôt do the food justice.)

Check it out. The restaurant is at Wheelock Place, smack in the middle of Singapore‚Äôs shopping district, Orchard Road."
Delicious Cuisine but rushed,love the Japanese food and their set in particular. Food was really delicious but unfortunately it is always fully booked and we need to finish our meals within the hour.
Dinner,"As usual, an excellent dinner at Sun with Moon. They were featuring Okinawan specialties. Service was great and food was served promptly."
Tasty light goodness,"Loved the dishes here! Had the foie gras too! Was really tasty and never tasted such great ""claypot"" before, with a Japanese twist! Definitely recommended! Could totally taste the freshness"
Wide selection & good food,"Have been to this restaurant several time. Over so many years, they still maintain the standard. They are very creative in the dishes and has a wide choice on the menu. As well as several promotions such as whiskey & sake promo besides food promotions. The food is good & sashimi is fresh. We find the food a little too salty though. Reservation recommended. When we walk in for dinner without reservation, the restaurant was almost fully book & we were offered a table but told we will have to share table. The staff are very efficient and service is good. It‚Äôs quite noisy with the low ceiling. But overall layout is chic. Will be back to try more dishes!"
Love the foie Gras,We always order the foie Gras. Nice and reasonable price. The food here is fresh and nice. If no reservation the wait can be 40-60 minutes. The service is nice too. Price is slightly above Average.
Great Ambience with Delicious Food,Great value with generous portion for steak set (can be shared between 3 people). Their salmon didnt let me down either. But the unagi was my favourite(Nixon Roll)! We actually ordered twice. Food was served pretty quickly too. Price is a little on the high side (we probably ordered too much too) but worth it for the taste and comfortable experience. Will definitely come again.
"Great food, ambiance, friendly staff","Had a later dinner.. 8+pm, was pleased to miss the usual crowd that I always see at the entryway. I found the food delicious, well presented, a really pleasant elegant environment at a reasonable cost. $30-35 per head for a nice main and shared dessert. Enjoy!"
Delicious unagi (Japanese eel) in one of the less crowded malls on Orchard Road,"Japanese Food is in fashion in Singapore. While that means mostly sushi there is more to it than sushi which has become a sort of fast food. For unagi, the mouth watering Japanese eel, try Sun With Moon. The unagi there was the best I had in Singapore. We were a group of four friends and ordered also some sliced and marinated beef on greenery and other side dishes. Everything was most satisfying."
Excellent Japanese food,"I‚Äôve been here a few times, for lunch and dinner, during the last 5 years and it is always a pleasure to see how good the food and service are.
For me the best deal for quality/price.
The ingredients are always fresh and tasty.
Be careful, the restaurant is full every lunch and dinner (the place is well known and appreciated) so better for you to book in advance."
Very decent food,Very decent japanese food good value for money. Had the seasonal set Hokkaido Morikomi Bento which is relatively large portion with drink and lovely wine sherbet. Definitely have to make a reservation especially on weekends as it gets really crowded.
Mouthwateringly delicious,Dishes are mouthwateringly delicious and portions are perfect for ladies. My friend and I shared a wagyu beef set and ordered 2 small portions of rolls. That left us with space for the dessert! Most yummy indeedüòã
Dinner for 4,"Situated on level 3 at Wheelock Place this is a nice Japanese restaurant with an open kitchen and modern furnishings. Extensive menu, including Kamameshi rice, sashimi, sushi, tempura to beef dishes. Tasted great, fresh seafood including sashimi and cooked ones. Set meals are also available. Specials including seafood from Hokkaido is available this time. Price were reasonable with sets from $31 to $50+."
Nice ambience and good food,"We walked into the restaurant without reservation during lunch on a weekday. It was crowded but since there were only two of us, we were shown to a table for 3. The L-shaped layout sitting arrangement for 3 was interesting. Very comfortable for two of us.
Food was good. Good variety of sets to choose from. Price wise is slightly on the higher side but given the food quality, ambience and location of the restaurant, we enjoyed our lunch."
Sushi,"Slightly better than average place for Japanese. Sushi was quite ok, miso was ok while fried salmon average. Prices are bit too high - comparing to Sushi Bar and quality wise Sushi Bar is better."
Quick and excellent service,"We managed to get a table at 1130 am, and were requested to vacate it by 1230 pm, when the person with the reservation turned up.

One hour was more than enough, as we finished our meal by 1220 pm, as the service was quick and efficient. They are owned by the Suntory group, and also feature a number of the Group's whiskeys in their housepours.

We ordered the Oyako Chirashi and the salmon was fresh and tasty. We also ordered the Unagi Yakiniku set. The unagi was okay, but had a number of bones, but the beef was good. I had the miso soup rather than the teapot soup. The set also came with three sides, which you can choose.

The ingredients were fresh but somehow, tastewise, it did not taste as good as what we had before. I miss the set that had included a piece of foie gras with sliced beef.

The meal for two was $56."
Kamameshi,"I love this restaurant‚Äôs kamameshi. I normally eat either the beef one or unagi with scallop.
The place is nice, and the manager is friendly. I haven‚Äôt ever seen him with grumpy face yet so far.

Though the staff is generally friendly, but sometime it needs a little bit more effort to get their attention. But I think it is forgivesnle as I Guess the restaurant is under staff sometime.

Otherwise, all is fine."
One of the better Japanese restaurants in town,"The food quality and atmosphere at Sun with Moon certainly feels a few notches higher than many other Japanese restaurants, especially those that are part of a chain.

Tried the seasonal Aomori Bento which was interesting but the Kurogoma Pudding, which is a black sesame with beancurd dessert, was what really caught my attention. Have not tried this dessert elsewhere before and it was certainly worth the calories."
Mind boggling range of optiond,"I had a really hard time making my decision. Their specialty is Kamameshi, which is flavoured rice steamed in an iron pot, taking on flavours of ingredients like mushrooms, chestnuts etc... They also had a special Aomori food fare on my visit, which featured Mutsu Bay scallops, Aomori maitake mushrooms and other regional specialties.
The normal menu also includes typical Japanese favourites like tempura, teriyaki, sushi, sashimi, grilled unagi and steak. Something for everyone. You could not go wrong here. I had the lunch bento, which had samplings of steak, sushi, sashimi and tempura and came with choice of hot or iced coffee or tea, and cheesecake for dessert."
Popular dish kamameshi,"It was crowded on a monday night; difficult to get the attention of the service crew.

This is the first time seeing Kamameshi. 2 ways of eating the rice (dry and with soup). Slightly different from Hitsumabushi (unagi don with 3 ways of eating it).

Many of us find it salty. Maybe too much sauce. Ingredients were sufficient."
"Go for lunch, less crowded and more variety","Visited this restaurant twice in the same month, once for lunch and once for dinner. It is surprising that I enjoyed the lunch more. The lunch menu had more options, such as combination sets, and as it was not as crowded, the service was much better. Dinner required a 45min wait, and we were sat in a segregated room in the extended zone, resulting in the waitresses not being able to notice us when we require their service.

The restaurant offers a great view of the busy traffic junction, but only a row of window seats are available. Food can be a little pricey, but thats the current trend of Japanese restaurants."
Fun with Spoon @ Sun with Moon,"Everything here is average-to-slightly-above-average: the food, service and pricing. The food is good, but nothing to scream about, even the ‚Äòfamous‚Äô kamemashi. Uya one level below at Wheelock Place is more unique, while Japan Town at nearby Wisma Atria has more interesting options."
Great Food with nice service,"Have dinner with family on a Sunday night. Good food and nice service. Got the Hokuriku fair promotion, with a new limited menu. Their signature rice is still the best."
Average Food with Poor Services,"The restaurant always gets full due to the popular location and reasonably average food taste, services are very poor, most staff try their best to avoid eye contact with customers. Nobody thanks customers upon departure from the restaurant, which is very rare at Japanese restaurants."
Artistic in Presentation & Every Morsel a Pleasure,"Been a while since we patronised this restaurant
But it is just as delightful
Menu is uniquely different from regular jap restaurants
Tastefully curated, excellent service and ambience is a plus point in the heart of town

Check out the pics and do give the cheesy tofu a try!"
Delicious Food,"My friends gave me a birthday treat on a Saturday evening. It has been almost 15 years since the last time I dined at Sun with Moon Wheelock Place. It was relatively easy to get a carpark space on a Saturday evening at Wheelock Place.

The restaurant was full but they accept reservations. The food quality was top notch. I enjoyed the beef sukiyaki, grilled chicken salad, sashimi. The place was cozy and comfortable. The staff were efficient and the food was served quickly.

They have a membership card with point reward system. I look forward to dine there again with my son. I brought him there when he was young."
Pleasant high tea,"I had a nice high tea session with my friend here. It was highly recommended and I have to agree that yes it us worth the money. We ordered 2 lovely high tea set for the 4 of us and chit chat all the way. It is a combination of cakes and sushi. Great for us as we prefer something not that sweet. As they are celebrating their 13 anniversary, they also give away some vouchers to encourage customers to come back again. This place has a great ambience too, no wonder I coincidently met 2 different group of friends here who happened to bring their dad and mother-in-law to celebrate their birthday respectively. Indeed it is a fabulous place for family dining."
Waiting for an hour is worth the wait,On any given night waiting for an hour to get a table is quite the norm but the food are served relatively quick to ease the hunger pangs. Amazingly the quality is not compromised and any item that you order from the menu - sushi to sashimi and ramen to steak are delicately prepared. The slew of awards speak for itself.
Great place for Japanese food,"Had dinner with my family‚Äôs at last minute arrangement. Called to make reservation but was told it is reservation closed as it is fully booked. Tried as walk-in and we didn‚Äôt get long to get our table.
Service staff was friendly & attentive.
Food quality was good and fresh for sushi and sashimi. Somehow my mom find the mackerel fish was bit fishy, maybe it is meant to be that way as I am not a fan of mackerel as it is a strong ‚Äúsmell‚Äù to me so can‚Äôt comment on that as I didnt try it myself.
Pricing is reasonable for the quality."
Lunch gathering,It was a gathering for us 4 ladies. A treat and my first visit there. Service was good. Place is clean n brightly lit with natural lights from the glass windows. Prices are reasonable and food is good. This place has been reviewed often and it is impressive enough...
Kamameshi Japanese claypot rice,"We tried Kamameshi Japanese claypot rice, it tastes great, with good ambience. Price is above average."
Ok üëå,Reach the standard for the price given. Tried the fried stingray fin with mayo üëç.. It has a great view
Hard to get a table but worth the wait,"The pros : very good selection of Japanese dishes, all well executed. Quick and good service once you are seated. Medium priced.

The cons : hard to get a table, strongly recommend to book a table several days on advance. Walk in are likely to wait 45 min/1 hour"
Great place to have Japanese at a reasonable price,"The title says it all. the sushi and sashimi are very fresh and the rest of the dishes (don, chawanmushi, beef steak) are also of very good quality. The prices are quite reasonable given its Japanese dining and located in Orchard.
The restaurants gets very very busy (an indication of their popularity) during peak hours and weekends, so reservation is definitely recommended. Also, because of the crowd overload it can sometimes be a long wait to get a waiter's attention. It;s not that they are lazy, it's just they they are always running around taking or fulfilling orders. The food comes in quick time though, once the order has been taken. We come here quite often when we are in orchard and feel something Japanese that's not ramen.
Revisit liklihood - Always."
Excellent quality,"The location is easy to find and get to, good choice for me to take my client for lunch. Dishes were served promptly and their salmon belly is very fresh, a bit on the pricey side though. Our main course, the tenderloin steak, was presented well. Service is attentive and friendly, ideal for business lunch."
Nice restaurant but too busy to serve you at door,Such a disappointment when no staff attend to you when standing there like a stupid customers wasted time. Please at least train your staff to attend to customers even though busy or whatever reasons. Totally disappointment
Not worth your time or money,"We used to be loyal fans of Sun With Moon. Not anymore. The menu has remained disappointingly static of late, and the quality of the food - a marked deterioration. We ordered a lamb dish (in hindsight a mistake) - which smelt bad and the meat was tough. When we raised this with the manager, he said we should have saud something earlier!

For the prices they charge, we would do much better at another Japanese Restaurant. Come to think of it, the queues at Sun With Moon have disappeared."
Kamameshi!!!,"We dined here and had yakiniku unagi Kamameshi and a yose nabe to share. Busy place at dinner time. Food quality was above average. Service was good too, efficient, fast and friendly."
Really Good Food,"Visited this beautiful restaurant with the intention to have some simple set lunch. It turned out to be not so simple in view of the wide variety of set lunches offered.
The service & food quality is good. To avoid disappointment, better make reservation before going as the place is popular. I was told by the service staff that the restaurant also offer high tea. The pricing is moderate & meals are value for money. Worth a visit to see for yourselves."
Taste of Tokyo!,"A Singapore favourite! Easy, reliable and ever so good! This trendy hotspot has that feel good atmosphere that appeals to most."
Not able to celebrate birthday in this restaurant - Excuse me?,"Me and my friends ordered a table to celebrate birthday. First time experienced a restaurant does not allow celebrating birthday in. The excuse is ""we sell cakes"" as well. Very bad, impolite and unacceptable experience! Not recommended!"
A delight every time!,"Sun with Moon is one of my favourite Japanese restaurants because they offer great tasting food at very reasonable prices. Service is impeccable and it's a go-to place for creative Japanese cuisine. The seasonal menu is always a delight and patrons are spoilt for choice with their extensive menu.

A place worth going again and again!"
"Tasty Japanese , Packed and Full Restaurant","Sushi served at the right temperature, fresh and authentic. Restaurant completely full, even at later time. Service is pretty good, when you are able to get the staff's attention,. Priced in line with Singapore costs. No WIFI! Pretty goo place if you are in the area,"
Horrible service.,I rang to reserve a table for 5pax for dinner yet they insist that we have to return the table within an hour. They said we could stay longer if we are walk in customers so we reached there 6.30pm for a walk in table yet they insist they will only give us a table if we return them the table at 7.15pm. How could you insist us to finish our dinner within 45mins ??? Singapore has horrible food service because every customer have to pay a 10% service charge in restaurants for dine in. But this is ridiculous giving customers a time limit for their dinner. It is not like they have best Japanese food in Singapore!
Very impressive jap food,Wide space with nice ambience. Impressed by the food. Very rich in taste yet not strong. Worth trying out. Applied for membership too!
good Japanese restaurant next to orchard rd,good Japanese restaurant next to orchard rd. menu has a good offering and taste wise is fresh and flavoursome. not too pricey as well.
Delicious Kamameshi lunch set,"It was a recommendation from a Friend and business associate to eat here as the ambiance is nice and it is less crowded compared to IOn.
We ordered the lunch special set - beef Kamameshi with avacado sushi rolls, sesame puddings and the pickled vegetables.

The rice is so tasty that the texture of the mix of vegetable and beef blend well in your mouth m. The sauce that already mix in the rice broth is delicious and is not salty at all.
Please remember to wait for the hour glass to complete its cycle before you start to tuck into your rice.
The Teapot broth is great ! I drank it alone as well as mixing it with the remainder rice that at the bottom of the pot.

Recommend to those whom love Japanese rice cooked in this traditional way."
Solid four stars,"My Wife and I enjoyed a nice date at the sun with moon cafe. We found the ambience okay, the staff efficient and friendly and the food good. The menu was somewhat limited. The vegetable tempura was average; the salmon belly and teriyaki chicken were both very good. The sushi was generally solid, apart from one trashed prawn that was served (it tasted fine, it had just been aggressively shelled). We would certainly visit again."
Delicious food and nice ambience!,"First time eating at Sun With Moon. Was impressed with the wide variety as Japanese restaurants typically specialise in some specific Japanese cuisine. And everything in the menu looked so yummy. I was really in a dilemma. Finally decided to try the ""Unagi & Yakiniku Kamameshi"". My choice did not disappoint me. The food was delicious. The thought of ordering a second helping even crossed my mind. As for dessert, we tried the ""Hokkaido Strawberry Mille Crepe & Vanilla Ice"". It was great too.

Would eat here again!"
Really good Japanese restaurant!,"In singapore there are not many good Japanese restaurants but I have to say that this one met my expectations!
It is a nice environment and the quality of the food is high! The row fish is fresh and prepared really well. Also cooked meals are really good and I like the concept of lunch set where u get a main course and then you can choose other 3 things (if I remember)"
"Great Service, Atmosphere n Food!","This is one place that I would like to go to whenever I am at Wheelock on Orchard. While you can expect to wait if you do not have a booking, but the wait may be worth it.

The staff here are attentive and very service oriented. Atmosphere is great for gatherings big or small. They have a different lunch n dinner menu, so you might want to check those out on their website. One of the popular dishes on the menu is the Kamameshi. Fresh ingredients and rice are steamed in bonito broth in an iron pot for one. The flavours are infused into every bite. As it continues to cook infront of you, it will char a little making it even more yummy.

Bottomline, try to book and you can enjoy the delicacies that they have on their menu."
Excellent food and customer service,"Excellent food and customer service

Always enjoy my dinner here with great Japanese food. Always leave some space for their yummy dessert.

Every visit is a pleasant one due to the attentiveness of the staff.

Do remember to reserve online for weekends. Cos can be crowded."
"Reliably very good, but need to reserve a table","The food is very good, especially the sushi and the set meals. The location is also very convenient and so it's often very busy - you will need to reserve a table, especially at the weekend. Reasonable prices given the quality."
Delicious and good value dishes,"I had dinner with three friends at about 8pm. The restaurant was packed and quite noisy. We had our order taken quickly. I ordered the tempura and sashimi 3 kind set for less than $30. It came with miso soup, rice and chawanmushi. The serving was generous. The tempura had three prawns and assorted vegetables. Sashimi was fresh. We also had the avocado soft shell crab roll. It was yummy. Desserts were very good. I will definitely order the sesame pudding and cheese cake in my next visit. Service was friendly but staff was a bit frantic due to the crowd. The table was too small for four. Some soup from the hot pot spilled when it was served."
Fresh Japanese Seafood,Food here is always delicious and fresh. Love the Kamameshi & Chirashi here. Their seasonal menu is also on point. Look no further to experience a great Japanese meal without breaking your bank.
Excellent find in Orchard Road area,"Found Sun With Moon today whilst exploring Wheelock place. And excellent authentic Japanese restaurant. Reasonably priced. Highly recommend the daily special set but you must add the soup which is delicious. The food was quick to arrive, which is good for lunch time and service was prompt and efficient. It worked out about $35 per head and was well worth the expense as we had additional items on top of the wet lunch. Highly recommended."
Food,"Fresh, reliable and trendy. This is a spot for good food with good friends. I highly recommend it. One could eat here every day and not get bored with the meals."
Birthday,"Had my birthday celebration in the restaurant! Wide selection from the menu. Had the kamanashi which is a three step dining dish. Comes with a one minute glass hour for counting down. After the one minute, you help yourself with the rice. You can pour the soup into the pot and eat it with the rice or simply on it's own. Overall a good experience! The tofu cheesecake pre ordered for my birthday is outstanding! Thank you!"
Comfort food for singaporeans,"Japanese food is comfort food for us Singaporeans, do call ahead as walk ins may have to wait. Basic, quality freshly prepared japanese can't go wrong , the rice dishes r great. Don't expect great service but staff r knowledgeable, helpful and diligent."
Never disappoints!,"I am a fan of this place since I was a student and it used to be the venue of meetups and gatherings. Many years on, I still crave for the food from the restaurant from time to time despite the many revamps along the way!

My partner and I really loved the deserts and drinks and went back on multiple occasions earlier this year.

Heard from her that the menu has changed yet again and the desserts and drinks were not as value-for-money since her last visit with her colleagues. I intend to drop by soon to verify this soon.

Before that, a thumbs up for one of my favourite Japanese restaurants!"
Second visit this year,Delicious food with nice presentation and great service staff makes Sun with Moon one of my favourite Japanese restaurant. Their sushi were awesomely good! I will definitely visit again.
Quality set lunch,The set lunch menu is considered value for money for the quality of food. The signature kamameshi set was very good. Do not seem to find this in other Japanese family restaurant. The bara chirashi set with salmon belly teriyaki was so good. The portion was big too.
Surprisingly good vegetarian food,I am not a vegetarian but would happily go back for the clever tasty food. Very accommodating at lunch time for a business meeting. Highly recommended.
Amazing Deliveroo standsrds,"I always order my sashimi and Japanese across from where I live , Ordered twice and the quality remains the same even for sashimi which is chilled and has cooling blocks . Premium prices for premium food"
