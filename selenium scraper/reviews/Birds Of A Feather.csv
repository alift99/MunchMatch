Never again,Super place and food. BUT we got kicked out at 11.00pm after spending over 1500SGD with a group of 5 at 11.00pm since the crew wanted to sleep early or party somewhere else. Who knows?
"Disappointing food, wrong information regarding nut allergy given in email from restaurant","One of our party has a severe nut allergy but particularly wanted a ribs dish as his main course. I emailed Birds of a Feather the day before to ask specifically if the 2 rib dishes contained nuts. I received an email response from Gabrielle stating that “the short ribs and O.P. Ribs are totally nut free” Great! So we went ahead with the booking. However on the night we were informed that both dishes contain traces of nuts. So whilst we are grateful that the details were re-checked (avoiding a medical emergency), we would not have come to this restaurant had we been given the correct information in the email response- as it was specifically a ribs dish that the birthday boy had wanted. A verbal apology was given, but it made for a disappointing birthday celebration.
The food was generally, as many other reviewers have commented, too salty. The sprouts were good. The short ribs were not- chewy & tough. Overall, don’t think we’ll go back."
Food and decor are as exotic as the name of the restaurant,"It should have been named Birds of Paradise! Exotic fusion Western cuisines with Sichuan accents. For 2 persons, we shared 3 starters and 2 mains. The Crab & avocado bruschetta and Yu Xiang eggplant were delicious with gentle flavors. The Chicken in Chillies blew our minds & taste-buds! Followed by very interesting grilled prawns and the Oriental Bolognese noodles! Together with a bottle of wine cost us S$256."
Excellent food and ambience,"We really enjoyed dining here. The decor is beautiful. The food was delicious and well presented. The menu is quite elaborate, a bit pricey but worth it. The service was great. Overall a wonderful dining experience. Would love to be back here to try some of the other dishes."
What a disappointment!,What a disappointment. The food was too rich and intense. We knew it was Szechuan style but everything had pepper and chillies.
Food standard dropped,"2nd time to this place. Quality of the food fell quite a bit. Noodle was tad too salty. Service was impeccable, but i'll prefer good food over good service."
Great experience!,"Beautiful restaurant sitting in Amoy street with many other good restaurants around. It has a very quiet setting and wonderful skylight inside. Food is great too. As a local Sichuanese, I feel the taste is quite authentic and names are funny to memorize too. Price is a bit high but definitely recommend to come with family and friends for a weekend day or night to relax."
"Attentive service, food is above average.","Food is little bit too salty for my likings. Especially the dumplings and capellini pasta. But find the chicken in chillies was really well blend flavour. Service was good, attentive. Value was just average."
Birthday Celebration,"Came here as friends have been recommending this place. For the 4 of us, we ordered both sharing menus & we were so surprised at the portions of the food. Portions were HUGE. By the end of dinner, we were so stuffed that we had to doggy-bag a whole Main dish!
Flavours were very Sichuan, so be prepared for the heat!.
Staff were attentive & brought us whatever cutlery we needed or changed our plates whenever we requested.
Desserts however was not to our liking. We felt that the peanuts did not gel with the flavours of the Pear & Jelly dessert. The Glutinous Rice Cake rock was much preferred."
Weekend Brunch,"Had lovely drinks before and came back for more as Ivan was name one of the Top 8 mixologists of the year. He made a bespoke Expresso Martini amongst his usual winsome cocktails. The food was impeccable, special mention to the humble sweet potato appetiser as well as the porridge. Super love!!!"
Restaurant review,"The food and ambience is good. However, the attitude of the manager is very bad. Rude behavior. Other staffs are ok."
"Good Food, Good Vibe, Good Service","Enjoyed my lunch. The fusion food was awesome and new for me. The service staff was friendly and provides a short description of the food when serving it to us. They would even explain how we can eat one of the dishes. Although the restaurant was full and eveyone seemed busy, they would attend to our queries with a smile and brought over the menu to make sure we have our answer.
Will definitely come back to try the other 2 dishes."
Very disappointing - but they waived off food charges,"This was a great disappointment
The food was not so much fusion but jumble
Had the tasting menu and they were brought out initially 3 at at a time and out of the published running order
Japanese Eggplant, Buffalo Mozzarella, Yu Xiang Sauce tasted like breakfast cereal with eggplant - not pleasant
Birds Avocado & Crab Bruschetta - was ok nothing special
Find the Chicken in the Chillies-was ok but very oily and I have had much better at hawker centres
Pork Dumpling- wasn't bad
Barramundi Chazuke- the fish nicely cooked and tasty - the broth sour and an awful taste - the broken or sticky rice was awful

Beef Short Ribs this was truly bad- the meat had been incorrectly cut off the bone and was chewy and gristly
The worst part was that it was excessively oily and too greasy to eat
Pear and Jelly
Osmanthus Poached Pear, Classic Sichuan Ice Jelly, Marinated Kumquat
As I expected it to be
The staff noticed that we ate less and less and in the end I expressed my dissatisfaction . They immediately sent over several staff. I didn't ask but they waived off the food cost"
Social place,"Authentic flavours, nice setting and atmosphere. Good portions. The type of places for friends gathering"
Worth trying,"Had been wanting to try Birds of the Feather for some time and finally made a reservation to try their Sharing Menu for Two. Each dish was quite unique and tasted good, my favourite was the Spicy Good Slime Shine (Chinese Yam Noodles). Will be back to try out their other dishes."
Magical Dishes,"Dish after dish of deliciousness! The staff here are very nice too. Great atmosphere. If you get the set menu, prepare to eat it over several hours."
Great food,"Love the ambience and deco. Food was great too (tho a little overpriced). The service was not too attentive this time round, not sure whether it was because we were seated in the front of the restaurant"
Food is good but not the expected service,"The food and drink is really cial and good,howevr not the service you will expect coming from the overall amount spent."
Decent Chinese & Western Mix,"My 2nd time visiting. The menu was changed quite a bit but luckily all the signatures remained. The appetizer: egg plant and Lazi chicken are must-try, so as the main course Sour Seabass (or cod?) with rice."
Good ambience. But must chose seating where the spotlight doesn’t shine on ur face.,"The food was different and interesting. Very flavourful. But after having a few mouthfuls, everything had too strong a flavour that it was abit overwhelming. It was abit salty as well. The osmanthus jelly was weird and Cocktail was underwhelming. No kick at all and was too sweet."
Excellent Food & Ambience,"We ordered a total of 4 appetizers and 2 main dish, enjoyed every dish and like how they did the sze chuan taste to a fusion mix. Ambience was nice. But Service could have been better as there was no common utensils and considering current covid situation it should have been a norm by now. We had to request for it and it was obvious we were sharing our food since the first dish. Our water was not refill thru out the whole session. Other than that all was good."
Delicious and creative dishes matched with great friendly service,"We had a number of the sharing dishes, and each dish was a standout in its own right! Service was spot on, attentive but still gave space to enjoy the food."
Great Ambience,"Great ambience and good food, value for money and strongly recommended. Perfect for couple and business dinner."
Great experience!,"Food was delicious, restaurant was cosy with great ambience. Excellent service as well. Requested for a nicer table as it was a birthday celebration and the staff delivered. Will be back!"
Delicious unique sichuan dishes,Love the surroundings giving a relax atmosphere. Mapo tofu is delicious and the pork claypot rice is awesome. Will come back again!
Food quality and service declined,"I used to loved the food and atmosphere at the restaurant. I even ordered delivery when dine-in was not possible. However, when I arrived at the restaurant this time, none of the waiters/waitress seemed to notice me. I waited for a while at the entrance, and decided to go in by myself as my friend was already seated at a table inside. When I walked by a waitress at the bar who's talking on the phone, she basically shooed me towards the door without saying a word. I believed she meant for me to do safeentry. I couldn't find the usual safeentry device that are found at other restaurants or malls, I was very baffled. Still nobody seemed to be bothered. Finally I found a QR code on the door, scanned and went inside. It wasn't even half full. I ordered my usual oriental balognaise and was shocked to see some of the angel hair spaghetti sticks together at the tips. It's probably not a big deal if it's a bowl of $4 noodles at a coffee shop. But it's a restaurant, and it's their signature dish. Food still tastes good, atmosphere is still cozy and pleasant. I was really disappointed by the sevice and the quality of food."
Food and Service,The food was sublime and the service great also. Highly recommend a return visit and will tell my friends also.
Elegant restaurant with delicious fusion food,"Great ambience and delicious, hearty food. Dessert was beautifully plated and service was impeccable."
Atas Sichuan western fushion food,The ambience is great for a cozy and comfortable feel in the mid day. Great to chill and laze. Service is great and attentive staff that never fail to top up our water. The food is kinda atas for Sichuan cuisine. But it’s delicious. Especially their burger. It’s worth a trip for experience.
Will revisit.,"Service was friendly and warm. Food was delicious, ambience was cosy and great for couples or with friends. Food was not too spicy either. Will gladly revisit to try other dishes."
Food and service lived up to expectations!,"I would say the overall experience was value for money, and this won't blow a hole in the pocket. Service was good and attentive, but not excellent (If they have been more sensitive about our wedding anniversary that I've left a note, and didn't ask if we would want a sharing table, this would have been a 5-star). Had the BOAF sharing menu, and topped up for the lobster and wagyu. The food was really good, although the taste of the Szechuan mala was almost the same across most dishes, but still delicious. Portion was also just nice, and the dessert was indeed a great finisher. Will definitely return because of the overall experience and price point. Not the best place for quiet privacy and fine dining experience for couples, but the vibes suits an upmarket Manhattan-chinatown fusion restaurant which you'll hear chefs yelling a little, with some conversations held over at the cocktail bar. Great place to commune for friends gathering and business though."
Delicious and Cozy Anniversary Dinner,"Huscand and I visited to celebrate our third anniversary and had a wonderful experience. Food was delicious (especially the Truffle Dumplings, Find the Chicken in the Chilli and Mapo Tofu), service was great and the ambience was perfect."
Kinda disappointed. 😔,"I have been there for few times. It was a “tricky” experience, BOF used to serve plain water (iced/warm). However, the waiter only asked:”would you like to have sparkling water or still water” and didn’t offer option for plain water, but the do still provide.

I wanted to have plain water and would definitely have ordered other drinks, (btw it’s organic chamomile is good).

Other than that, “find chicken in the chilli” was over salty, but the waiter nice enough to change a new one for me.

Other than that over all is above average. Hope the manager can look into the “sparkling water, still water, or plain water” matters, giving customer options so customer wouldn’t fell trapped."
Exquisite!,Culinary artistry. The most delicious meal we've had in a long time. Excellent service. Wonderful ambiance. Highly recommended!
"Great atmosphere, good customer service but food is salty","This place is nice for a date night (most couples there looked like they were on a date, since we are limited to 2 to dine in currently). Food is interesting and unusual. But the food is overly salty, next time I’ll ask them to lower salt content. Then id be able to taste the food better"
First visit,"The food is not bad, except the 辣子鸡. Although a lot of people posted it on social media, the taste is only average. The cocktail is also only average. Next time if I want to eat Chinese Food, I will go to a proper Chinese restaurant."
Great food,Food was really good though prices were a little on the high side for lunch. Service was ok until the end where the waiter poured oily soup on my satin dress when he cleared the plates hastily. Not a big deal except that he was doing this for all the dishes on the table and it nearly poured out a couple of times. Would have expected better service from a restaurant like this.
Good Place for a chill out,"Located at Amoy Street, serves exquisite Western & Szechuan fusion food that is mostly great. Great selection of cocktails and wine. Excellent ambience and good service. Good for dates !"
Interesting food and superb ambience,"Very intetesting fusion food! From the ambience to the service level of staff to the presentation of food and not forgetting the taste and creativity of the dishes is just full of awe. I visited the restaurant twice in a week. You will not get tired of the food.

Aircon can be abit too cold at certain seats though. So be sure to ask for a table not having the aircon directly blowing at you for those who are not a fan of “winter”."
Expensive,"More of a place to chill and hangout. In the past, there were fewer 东北 eateries but there are way more now. So, food wise, u can get better value elsewhere."
"Good food, great service","The food was good, reasonably sized portions, good sharing dishes for various palates. Great service"
Find the chicken in the chillis is good,"The dish find the chicken in the chillis is good, atmosphere not bad. Ice 2 baby is a feast to the eyes, taste fine too. Crispy gyoza with truffle vinaigrette and Oriental Bolognaise are pretty normal and can be overlook."
An interesting restaurant,"The food is really amazing and the service was great. I loved how the food isn't too oily, which is usually the impression of Sichuan food"
Interior decor is different from website,"Had dinner with a friend. Food was pretty good and service was great. But I’m disappointed with the interior. It looks very nice on the website and google pictures. The reality of it was sparse decoration and nothing much to write home about. One of the reasons we chose this place was because of it’s lovely interior and ambience as we wanted to take fabulous photos. Nevertheless, we enjoyed dinner and staff was nice & welcoming. So for that, we thank you."
Reservation Timing suboptimal,With the Chope App I could not get my desired time. When we arrived however the place was half empty. Disappointing
First time Dining Experience at Birds of a Feather,Overall the ambiance of the restaurant was first rate. The staff were attentive and the selection of food was superb. My only concern is being charged for soda water when we ordered a bottle of vodka for our table. in most establishments the mixers are included. i would recommend this venue for small groups or an evening with someone special
Birthday dinner,The Location is very easy to find and I would like to say the sichun western is very nice . Really thumbs up for the food .. love ❤️ the chicken spicy and the order I have made. The waiter are very helpful and recommended me and my friend for the food which I was hesitant that which one should go. I will definitely recommend who love spicy and with the western feel.
Birthday Lunch,"The environment of is good. Good for catch up with friends, the tastes of the food are decent too. Will definately come back!"
overrated,"suited for those who enjoy spicy szechuan cuisine and good ambience. We ordered the chili chicken, bolognese, mapo tofu with rice, sweating mussels and beef burger. Chili chicken was good as an appetiser. The bolognese was really bland and the ingredients didn't seem to pair and compliment each other, making it taste very unappetising. Any cafe could have served better pasta given the price. The sweating mussels dish was very overwhelming due to the massive amount of peppercorns they added. Although the yam noodles in the dish was nice and chewy, I didn't manage to enjoy it due to the overwhelming numbing sensation of the peppercorns. As for the beef burger, the kitchen forgot our order and we had to ask twice before they served us. The burger was really average, apart from the addition of foie gras. We felt that we were paying more for the ambience rather than the food given our experience. This place would be suited better for couples or perhaps drinks. All in all, we didn't have a pleasant experience and we would not return."
Good service,"Love the food quality and presentation, great service, all the staff are very attentive to my needs and made me feel good in front of my client."
Excellent all round,Been a few times always impressive. Waiters know the menu and happy to be creative. Tried the Tofu this time ... wow
Service,Food was good.But we can’t find the address it’s because the unit from website is (01-01)but when was there is (01-03) and Service need to improve.Thanks
Excellent,"It was a nice ambiance and experience - I would come back for sure and will recommend this place , thanks"
Great food good service,"I would like to compliment the service and desserts little creatures have served my girlfriend and I on 11th of January.
We ordered the triple ice cream which was really nice as its of top quality. We enjoyed the nice ambiance and its really relaxing for us. The staff was courteous and professional.
Thank you so much and we will be back soon."
Brunch at Birds of a Feather,"A little bit pricy but food and ambience were nice. Ordered the vege pot and it turned out to be surprisingly nice, combination of Sichuan and western taste."
Fusion food,"Although food was fuison style, the dishes were executed with great flavour. I also had a great time find finding my chicken amongst the pile of chillies. Surprisingly, the coffee was pretty good. Will definitely be back to try other dishes."
"Extremely Average, over-rated and Poor Value for Money","Found the Food, extremely average quality, though it was quite over-booked. We ordered Burger and Snapper and both were very average in taste, through the presentation was quite nice. At the end it was very poor value for the money that we spent."
Fancy Sichuan,Very nice atmosphere. Mala pig trotter and diced chicken were so nice. I'm drooling while writing this review..
Amazing!!,"Loved everything about this restaurant, super posh yet chill and the service was amazing!! If you love Sichuan cuisine I think you would love this place, it has that signature Sichuan pepper with a local twang and everything ordered was worth the price! Would like to give a shoutout to the fried potato and sweet potato in chili!!"
Perfect place to celebrate a special occasion,"My wife and I came for our 10th wedding anniversary. We had a great meal, the staff were attentive & helpful, relaxed atmosphere and just a nice easy going ambience.
Some nice combinations on the menu and staff were knowledgeable to advise what worked well together. Highly recommend."
Nice place to chill,That was nice Recommendations for couples meals during the dinner. Values for money. We will be there again Garden seat 😂😂😂
Business lunch,Pretty localised service. Waited a long time to get staff attention to take our order. Was offered a make-shift table for 2 right in front of a bar counter area. Badly placed table. Probably won't head back again.
Highly recommended fusion food with fantastic ambience and great service!,"My dad, wife, and I absolutely loved our maiden dining experience at Birds of a Feather! The ambience was lovely especially with the indoor plants and flowers The staff were all super friendly and professional; we chatted with the amazing boss Megan and we were served by Ernest who gave us great F&B recommendations. Speaking of food, the Oriental Bolongaise and risotto were scrumptious, the eggplant appetiser was fantastic, and the popular Find the Chicken in the Chillis dish was so unique! The white wine was stellar too Be sure to reserve a table in advance as it will get busy even on weekday nights. Thank you so much! We will certainly be back"
good food amid cosy atmosphere,"i was here with a group of friends and found the level of spiciness was suitable for those not used to spicy ma-la, yet spicy enough for people who like ma-la. Not tongue numbing which means i can still taste my food.
Service was good too."
Great experience,Great experience and amazing food. The bolognese and baked eggplant was out of this world. Will be back for sure.
Great food for a reasonable price,Very good ambience for food and drinks. Price is reasonable and should try the bolognese And the small burger.
Great food and Ambience,"Always love the food here. Very tasty and good quality. Ambience is great. The food is a good mixed between Sichun and western, great fusion creation."
"good ambiance, good food","The place is very cozy and elegant. Good for couples of friends get together. The food are all worth trying. They are delicious and worth the price. Staff are also accommodating and friendly,they also recommend their specialty."
Finally flocked here,"You don’t need a little birdie to tell you this place is good. Everyone raves about this modern Szechuan cosy spot. Let’s start with the ambience – dimly lit with plush seating so romance fully reigns. Throw in the cloud lights and the bold dashes of neon to lend a smoky opium den feel (minus the smoke and the opium, of course). The window seat with slightly sunken seats - should you wish to feel how it’s like to be in the windows of the redlight district of Amsterdam. Then the cocktails of epic and dramatic presentations raise that brow and the ante. One of my cocktails was personally mixed, off-menu, which raises the fun factor. Not into spice? Get out! Or get ready to sweat. Eggplant was soft and well textured. Barramundi Chasuke is favourful soup poured over that handsome hunk of fish – with dramatics, of course. Meat-eaters play hide and seek with the find-the-chicken-in-a-sea-of-chillidish. Birds of a Feather ticked every box and more, making this one of the stand-out spots and a true dining institution of the Singapore scene."
Amazing Place,"Amazing food, great deals on wine during their happy hour! The staff were friendly and helpful. The restaurant was also very nice."
New place,"After almost 6 months of ""eating at home"", we finally got out to have a meal with good friends (in a group of 4). The food is interesting as there is elements if szechuan/chongqing spices in the dishes. These are spicy and hot, a bit numbing. Service was friendly. I thought the internal deco was very comfortable.
We had to give our our table in 1 hour 45 min though for the next seating as it was crowded and popular. A bit unfortunate as we wanted to stay and talk more with our friends."
Ambience and Food,is my 2nd visits to the restaurant. The Ambience is really nice for group gathering. The food taste very good and it usually cost us SGD50-60 per pax (without order alcohol drink)
"Beautiful place, Great food","Great place for dates, and insta-worthy decor and food. Food quality is good, overall a good experience!"
Amazing Food & Service ... can't wait to be back!,"First time here and not our last! Great space, food, service - everything! Authentic Szechuan flavours were presented through a diverse range of dishes, thoughtfully recommended by our servers. Half of our group could not handle the ""la"" part of ""mala"" while the other half are spice fiends ... BUT everyone was super happy with every single dish. Can't wait to come back. We're addicts now."
Will re-visit again!,It's our first time dine-in at Birds Of A Feather and satisfied with the food and ambient. Food was served very fast and the plating was superb! Of course it's yummy too! Overall price a bit on the high side but the 4 of us (with my sister & cousins) were happy and fulfilled. Service was acceptable too.
Great service and awesome food,"The service was great and the food recommended was really delicious.
Before going for dinner, I had arranged for a surprise dessert for my husband. And the staff knowing that it was a special occasion, sat us in the best seat of the house and the dessert (with the exact wordings that I had requested for) came promptly after dinner. It was a lovely evening out. Thank you Birds of a Feather"
Great Food at the Comfort of Your Home,Always loved eating at the restaurant. Had a mini celebration of home; decided to get food from this restaurant. They did not disappoint. Food came hot and it was yummy. Thanks Birds of A Feather.
Quality Food Must Try!,"Order the Bird’s Bundle meal for 2 pax for Mother Day dinner 10 May 2020.
Delivery was prompt too!
My wife loved the food so much and give 5 stars.
Food was amazing good in terms of quality.
One of the best food I have ever tasted!!
Chicken Burger with Sweet Spice is my preference and the rest dishes also good too.
Highly recommended!"
Nice Ambience,"The ambience and the presentation of the food is beautiful. Although the taste isn’t that memorable, some of the dishes look like art on a plate. It's a nice place for a romantic dinner date."
Definitely a Must try!,"A nice and cozy setting with a tad hint of uniqueness. Quite a number of staffs on shift, service is definitely there. The main dishes and small plate taste good, really good, a little on the expensive side but the taste does match up. Only complain is the mala pot dish, for that I think the dish is abit steep given only a few sticks of vegetable inside. The chicken fried in chili is a must try! And just one small thing, when we were at our table, most probably the boss was reprimanding the staffs about something, it would have been better if this was done more privately? Other than that, please do give this place a try! You won’t regret it !"
Perfect for romantic and weekend dinner parties,"Perfect combo of food, drinks, service and ambience! Incredible Asian-fusion gourmet dishes to impress your guests at dinner parties. Love the finish with fancy cocktails, but be prepared to spend $$$"
"Good food, nice ambience","Food was great, ambience was very nice. Love the plant corner and makes the place look very beautiful. Made a reservation and indicated that I was celebrating my friend’s birthday - our salted caramel cake came with a candle! That was a very nice touch, thank you!

Only thing that I didnt really like was that the toilet was a little too dark.

Would come back again!"
2 stars only for the decor,"2 stars only for the decor and ambience

Food - inconsistent service
I came 45 mins later, and got my food same time as most of my other colleagues , 2 had their dishes served later.
I asked if they could hurry and the waiter told me I’m not the chef.

My noodles was very salty and I gave the feedback to another waiter who gave a black face took my dish and left.

Small portions, ok food

Better off somewhere for the price and attitude"
a bit of this a bit of that,"It's a lovely space. Service is a tad uneven though pleasant. The baked Teggplant dish had very little eggplant, mostly a fried dough. Tasty but not what we expected. The burger was fine, nothing special. Oriental quinoa salad is good. On balance the food was pretty disappointing. We probably won't repeat."
"Amazing food, great environment","We came here for a weekday dinner with friends and had a great time - all the food was really tasty, nicely spiced and well-balanced in terms of flavour. Quite unlike Szechuan food I have tried elsewhere for sure! I especially liked the Szechuan chilli chicken and the baked eggplant. We were probably a bit annoying ordering more food and drinks constantly throughout our dinner, but the service was very good, quick and polite. Definitely a place to try for a different take on Szechuan food!"
Bad service - our dinner's order was mixed-up twice. We got dishes that we didn't order and the bill was not correct.,We got dishes that we didn't order and the bill was not correct. Music too loud. Not enough light for seeing your food.
lovely,"all the dishes we ordered were delicious. not too overpowering which we were afraid of given that sichuan cuisine can be too spicy. we enjoyed the eggplant, good slime shine and pork bits."
"Nice food, good for vegetarians but rather pricey menu","My bf and I went for lunch on 24 Jan 2020 (Friday) after reading positive reviews online, and despite the negative ones on slow and inattentive service.

We ordered a main truffle Alfredo orecchiette pasta (S$35), & 2 sides - baked eggplant with man tou (S$14) and Find the Chicken (辣子鸡) (S$16). Plus service charge (10%) and GST (7%), the total bill came up to around S$77 between the 2 of us.

The pasta is vegetarian, non-spicy and was done nicely to my liking as I like it thick-creamy with a fairly strong truffle mushroom taste. It was not a huge serving, and came with asparagus, onsen egg, red onions, and a parmesan foam but I filled up easily so am glad we ordered it for sharing.

The baked eggplant was prepared in fish sauce (tasted like tomato gravy w a slight tinge of sour) and came with fried man tou which was crispy, without coming off as too oily. It’s also vegetarian & non-spicy.

The 辣子鸡 was not too spicy, great for someone who is looking for a tiny bit of a numbing kick. but it may be disappointing for someone who wanted a much more fiery aftertaste.

Overall, a good experience as the food was not bad. The waiters were cordial, gave us an appropriate amount of attention & recommendations and responded immediately to my request to fill up my cup of warm water. The restaurant also serves a number of non-meat dishes so vegetarians do have options here.

I give it 4/5 stars for the yummy food. 1 missing star cos I think the menu is still on the expensive side. On a side-note, bring your phone to the toilet cos the lightning is quite dark and the phone torchlight will come in handy."
Delicious Asian fusion cuisine,"Went there for a lunch catch up with a dear friend. We had the gyoza which had a hint of truffle, the eggplant, and the oriental bolognaise comprising capellini with bolognaise sauce and onsen egg. All delicately put together, leaving both of us with multiple flavours in our mouths. A great experience. Loved it and would go back for sure."
dinner at birds of a feather restaurant,"we really enjoyed this dinner. the food was very excellent, creative and special. service and atmosphere were just great. very recommended!"
Good for dates!,"Went as a couple for our date night, ambience was good and comfortable. Service staff were amazing and food was unique, very fusion and fun yet delicious at the same time.

Ordered the chicken dish and two mains to share, feel free to ask what's recommended and the staff would be more than happy to accommodate.

Definitely coming back again."
"Nice food, Nice environment and friendly staff!","I booked my reservation via Chope for my dinner on 1st Jan. I like how they present the food. Presentation is nice, the food taste can be improve, the environment is nice, the staff is really friendly! We love it and will come back again ;)"
Good food / poor service,The food was good with an interesting mix of dishes but the service was surprisingly poor. The staff were surly and sarcastic - the highlight was when our party of 4 requested a second bottle of champagne and this was met with the blunt comment ‘the restaurant closes at 3pm’. Kind of odd given closing time was more than an hour away?!
Great experience,"Highly recommend this place! Great customer service, good recommendations with good food and drinks were pretty good as well! Had an awesome time here and wouldn't hesitate to dine here again."
Absolutely Stunning,"Been there to celebrate my gf's birthday and she like it. that means alot! Tried their latest from the kitchen dessert ""ice2baby"", that was unforgettable."
Go there without expectation,"Ambience was great and food was pretty good~ however service was below average, due to these circumstances;
1. main course was served before we were done with our appetiser. No one came to asked if we would like our main course to be served.
2. water glass was empty, however no one asked if we would like a refill, however when we asked for a refill, the person forgot about our water.
3. no one came over to asked how was the food, despite there were only 3 tables occupied in the corner, close to the kitchen.
4. we waited till someone would come around, so we could ask for the bill, however, it took 20 mins before we could get someone’s attention."
Coffee break,"A cozy place, I could actually sit and enjoy my coffee. I've asked specifically for a cozy place, I didn't plan on eating so no need for an eating table. The light is just right, the place feels cozy and chic, due to the natural elements and plants... very nice find!"
Good healthy food,Nice place to go with friends or date after work for fusion Chinese food and cocktail. they are playing music louder after 10PM and tables are quite close each other.
Stupendous Experience,"Came with a first date and was kindly assisted by Sharon, an amazing and friendly waitress with exceptional tastebuds that gets to know you and recommends you items to your palette. Thank you for the amazing visit! Really enjoyed the food and drinks!"
Always a fantastic time at Birds of a Feather,Absolutely wonderful cocktails. Loved the “Find the Chicken in the Chillies” and the Oriental Bolognese. Looking forward to another visit super soon!
