Quality Food & Service,"Really enjoyed the meal, speed and quality of service was excellent, good meat and value for money, will be visiting again !"
Better service than Food,AJ was a great host but it was disappointing that we waited for the tomahawk steak to arrive only for it to be underdone. Ordered medium rare and it came rare and some parts almost raw.
One of the best fillet steaks‚Ä¶.,Honestly one of the best fillet steaks I have had and I have tried steak restaurants all Over the world. It was so soft and juicy. Sides were good too especially the creamed spinach. I wasn‚Äôt quite as keen on the spicy fries or roast potatoes but there are still alright.
The perfect burger and dinner,"We had dinner in this cozy steakhouse by the river and everything was excellent.
My wagyu burger was super good and also the sirloin that my husband eat was perfectly cooked.
Highly recommended!

Only air conditioning was a bit too high inside, but nothing else to complain!"
"Not worth the money. Save your dollars, catch the MRT to Chinatown and eat local!","The food was good (not exceptional, but good). However, the service was abysmal! We were seated quickly and given menus, but then took ages (over half an hour) to get served. My son‚Äôs soup starter arrived quickly, with my wife‚Äôs just after. She decided to wait to eat until mine came - luckily she had a cold starter as my French onion soup was at least another 25 minutes‚Äô wait. I enquired as to its whereabouts twice and was told it was just coming. Once I was eating, the waiter came and cleared away my son‚Äôs dish.

I was still eating my soup when they then bought all of the mains (steaks) - including mine! The steak was tasty, but. again, definitely NOT amazing. Price was around $200, not including the service charge - which I refused to pay.

This was the only ‚Äúwestern‚Äù food we ate on our stay in Singapore. We were staying room-only in our lovely hotel intentionally to dine mainly in the hawker centres and the traditional restaurants (as we wanted to experience traditional Asian cuisine). But this was, by far, the poorest experience we had in the wonderful city of Singapore."
slightly disappointing,"First impressions were excellent, the ambience was welcoming we were shown very quickly to a table, we ordered without undue delay, so far very pleased, but all was a little tarnished when first of all one meal was served of the two ordered a good ten minutes before the other arrived, and when the meal arrived another five minute wait for the side dish to go with the steak, the food itself was of excellent quality and the presentation was superb, more disappointment when we ordered coffees which were served lukewarm, and we had to ask for sugar, and then had to ask again for a spoon to stir with, it meant three times trying to get a waiters attention to get all three components of a cup of coffee, quite spoilt the ambience of the special dinner we had planned for that night, a shame because the place and the quality of the food was spoiled by the mediocre service."
Best food and service,"Beautiful atmosphere, the food is always of Œ± high quality - lovely professional service. Highly recommend. Best restaurant in Singapore !"
Very good relaxing lunch üëç,Tastiest ‚Äòproper‚Äô burger I have had in a long time. Highly recommended for a leisurely lunch and reasonably priced for SG and Clarkes Quay. Also music at good level and air conditioning not to hot or cold.
Order the signature tenderloin and they'll flame it at your table,"Had dinner there last night, they were out of a few things, I assume to supply chain disruptions, so they suggested I have their signature dish, a flaming tenderloin. I was so glad I said yes. It was some of the most tender meat, topped with a wine-based mushroom sauce, that I've ever eaten. Probably my favorite dinner of the week in a city well known for its food."
The food and service at The Ranch is awesome!,The Ranch has amazing food and I highly recommend the Beef Tartare. The service here is also excellent. I've had a pleasant Experience at the Ranch yesterday. Our waiter for the day was AJ and the service he provided to us was excellent.
Farewell Dinner,"The restaurant staff was nice & we were very enjoy during the visit.
Only concern was the main course were served slightly late, but is okay of lesser staff during this COVID-19 period. Not much of concern. I'm very happy that, the restaurant is able to provided a piece of cake to celebrate my colleague birthday which I requested."
anniversary dinner,"good food, but was abit warm. we had a steak and pesto pasta. the steak was really good and the pasta was average (worth the price)"
Standard dropped and maybe my last visit.,"Ordered croquette as hot starters. 5 pathetic 2cm cubes where served and it costed $10. The striploin was full of sinew and super chewy. Feedback to the staff and they said ""it's like that"". Honestly, I've been to higher end places that serves striploin without such issues."
Amazing,Hendricks and team took care of us today. The steak was cooked to perfection and tasted beautiful. The sides of veggies and the salad were exception and the sangria were all top notch. The restaurant is beautifully designed and has great character and good ambience. The service is second to none. Do not walk past this place!
Meet to Eat Delicious Delicious Meat,"Brought my parents to Ranch steakhouse after raving about the Dry aged beef.. This time I decided to order a huge platter of meat and as usual the food didn‚Äôt disappoint...Juicy & flavour full dry aged beef and pork chops, OMG fall off the bone short ribs and lovely deep fried wings...my parents were filled to the brim with perfectly cooked food not forgetting the side, yum‚Ä¶ complements to the chefs and the attentive service staff even during the crazy festive period...cheer!!! I‚Äôll be back!!!"
Very good food. Reasonable price. Nice ambience,"Order rib-eye steak, cream spinach, roasted potatoes. The steak is very juicy and tender. Spinach and potatoes are very tasty. The price is reasonable. Enjoyed this meal very much."
"Excellent service, good food, reasonable prices","Our second visit to this place was on 4 Nov. First & second time there, both times, the service provided by AJ Jalil was excellent. The food was good- we tried the grilled octopus, seafood aglio, Angus ribeye, US Prime Dry Aged T-Bone Steak. Excellent service, good food, reasonable prices. We will definitely return."
Acceptable but can improve,"Tried the set lunch. It‚Äôs a quite a good deal if you order the ribeye, but on the day only one of us could order it as we were told it was sold out. While understandable, we were there only 45mins from opening time and didn‚Äôt look too busy so was a bit disappointing that they didn‚Äôt cater enough. Food quality was ok; the mushroom soup was a bit diluted."
Fantastic experience,For the price you get quality steaks at a price which would put some of the pricier joints to shame. Even the sides were commendable and of good quality. Keep it up. We were allowed to sample wines before ordering as well
Nice Ambience & Food,Food served quite fast and good quality of steak. Nice ambience too. Will definitely come again next time.
The best meal with one small hiccup...,"The cheesesticks were dope, the bruschetta appetising, the steak amazing but the salmon nicoise left a lot to be desired... Then again, its a steakhouse so maybe I was expecting too much in the fish department."
Visit to The RANCH Steakhouse By ASTONS on 14 May 2021,Great food and polite and attentive service! I was even told how long to wait for my Iberico Pulled Pork and the friendly staff also offered to take a photograph of me with the food! I will definitely go here again and this time with friends (or perhaps takeaway too!)
The Ranch Steakhouse by Astons,"The Ranch offers excellent steak at value for money price. They were having a limited promotion of white asparagus from Germany. The service, as usual, was excellent and the waitresses and waiters are knowledgeable and prompt."
Great service from Hannah,I‚Äôve never written a review for a local restaurant but Hannah really impressed me and my fianc√©e with her attitude and willingness to share. Definitely coming back next year for my birthday again
Lunch at The RANCH,Staff were very attentive and anticipated our needs. The steaks were good and there is a good variety of food. The place was accessible and ambience was great as well. My family enjoyed the meal there. My only bugbear was that the bisque was too too salty. I should have sent it back but I didn't want to other as everything other detail was fine.
A great dinner,The ranch is the best steak I have had and consistently good .. very good service from Hanna that served us more than well and a overall great night with the best of foods and wine.
Mother‚Äôs day lunch,"The staffs of the restaurant such as female crew are very warm & hospitable, esp Hannah and the lady from Malaysia. The lamb rack and iberico pork chop is yummy & recommended!"
Fantastic crew & meals,"All the crews are very friendly, all the foods are delicious, & wine was also well chosen and suit the meat. Definitely I'll come back again!!"
Excellent service and value for money,"Great food at affordable prices. Very much enjoyed the Porterhouse steak and the iberico pork. Night was made much better by Hannah, who made superb recommendations. Will certainly be back."
Horrible Service,"What started as a happy family dinner turned out to be a nightmare. All thanks to the horrible service we experienced in The Ranch. We waited for more than an hour for our steaks that never arrived. When we arrived the restaurant was not even half filled. We asked for our food 3 times. The first time, the waiter came back to say 4 more minutes. The second time, the waiter said 3 more minutes. The last time we asked for the manager. He came back and informed us that it would be 10 more minutes. We had enough of the lies and poor service. We left the restaurant. This is steak. How long do you need to prepare steaks. Unless you enjoyed not getting your food and poor service, this is not the place to go. I will avoid at all course."
Don‚Äôt bother,"We waited more than an hour for steaks that never arrive. Despite repeated checking with the waitress the answer was always ‚Äòcoming in 3 minutes ‚Äò . To think that we arrived at 6.15 pm on Saturday, and the restaurant was not even half full when we ordered this is totally unacceptable.

Don‚Äôt bother visiting. Terrible experience."
Delicious,"Great first experience! Porterhouse was wonderful and sides were tasty and generous. Friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere. Kid friendly, we had our 3 and 9 year olds in tow. Hubby enjoyed his birthday dinner. Will return!"
Quality food in reasonable price,"Overall is good, different from Aston, The Ranch menu has more variety of beef selections, also include popular items like truffle fries, onion soup, fish and pasta. Most of all, the price are pocket friendly and good value for family dining."
Good steak and service,"All staff were friendly and it was a pleasant experience dinning there. I would consider that the service provided and ambience is pretty fancy but there is a casual vibe to it. I like it. Not too much pressure for diners to act classy. I bought voucher from their road sales, good deal! Got 2 bar snacks, 2 alcoholic drink for free and 30% off on their table side flamborghini. Tenderloin was indeed tender, the flame show from table side cooking was definitely a nice experience. Bar snacks was good, try the chi chi beef cubes! Overall 10/10. Definitely will revisit!"
Birthday dinner for my daughter,The service was excellent the person attending to us Mr Abdul Jalil was very professional and knowledgeable
Good food and ambience,"The waiters were friendly and polite. We ordered the sirloin steak, chicken and ranch burger. The food came hot and tasted very good. The wait time was a bit long though. But overall it was a very good dining experience. My friends enjoyed the meal."
Great customer service,"The servers were attentive and friendly. When we were charged the wrong bill, we got our drinks waived. Great job of empowerment of your servers! Will return again soon =)"
Bad service,"Unpleasant dining experience caused by the Asst. manager named AJ.

1st visit (feb 2021) : we asked AJ some menu enquires and his response was rude and impatient.

2nd visit(mar 2021) : we asked AJ for an extra chair to place our bulky bags. He told us that ALL chairs are reserved and walked off. This rude behavior is uncalled for.

Guess what, throughout the night, there were several tables and chairs were empty even until our departure.

We have seen several complaints made abt AJ and we seek management to look into this matter."
Amazing,"Fantastic steak in a lovely restaurant. The staff are friendly and helpful, the prices are really good for Singapore and the truffle chips were my partner's favourite chips in the world. It was a great meal!"
More than value for money,"I went to this Steakhouse several times. There is only one conclusion: the best steakhouse in Singapore. Great meat, great prices, more then affordable pricing. No matter what you order, cooked to perfection, served with elegance and the most comfortable seat in any Restaurant in Singapore. Needless to say that the interior outfit is matching all other great perspectives too. A must for a meat lover. And even vegetarians can get their stuff. Wine prices are so reasonable. Try the Monte do Zambujeiro for 68 bux. Amazing as everything else."
Special Commendation,"We want to specially thank The Ranch for their fantastic hospitality and service, especially by Raja Hendricks. I think you made my husband‚Äôs birthday and that did it for me. I wanted him to feel special and looked after and that‚Äôs exactly how he felt. He also enjoyed the food very much which is a bonus because he has v high expectations! So thank you again team at The Ranch, for making all of this possible on his special day! We will return."
Good Ambience and Great Service,"I ordered a 470gm USDA ribeye and wagyu cold cut to share. The cold cut was good. The bread that came along was nice. The USDA steak was a little stiff. Overall, the service was very good and everything was nice except the steak was below expectation. Still good overall."
Friendly staffs and Great Food,"Really love this restaurant! Staffs are very friendly, and foods are great! Will definitely go back again."
Attentive service and decent bites with good promos,"Was there on a Sunday, and free corkage was granted for BYOB with a minimum spending of $50 per pax. It was not difficult to hit the amount as we had a group and order a few bites (Salmon Tartare, Duck Rillette, Fries, Warm Bread Basket) alongside the Porterhouse steak, Striploin steak and Iberico Pork Collar. In general, the food was above average, although I would have preferred the beef a little less over-cooked, and the duck rillette fresher/thawed more.
For the portions and pricing ($300+ amongst 5 pax) and 4 bottles of wine which we brought and enjoyed (nil corkage) with our food, it was a nice weekend wine-down.
Not crowded, cosy, with attentive waiters (especially AJ) who was mindful of topping up of water and how our food, setting of the place/ temperature was in general."
Great food and service,"The quality of the food here is good. Not only the steak, we also liked their appetizer and dessert. Their staff provided excellent service - they are passionate to make recommendations and serve!"
Nice place and very nice food,"Visited a month ago and I have enjoyed the second visit. Friendly service, nice atmosphere and beef steak is great."
Wonderful service and food,"The service was great. Without any prompt, the hostess informed me that my order was delayed and offered a complimentary item after I waited just around 20 minutes. I was impressed by the hostess being attentive and looking out for my order, much more than having an item for free. So I tipped back the price of the item and more. Thanks to Miu and Suzami for the great service.

The lamb riblets were wonderful. The meat smooshed in the mouth and had a slightly burnt crust. It also had a hint of cheese, which was surprising.

Side note, the beef has been in the dry-ager since 29th May, is it counted as 60 days dry aged now?"
Excellent Food and Service,"The food was fantastic and the servers were all so friendly. Despite the trying times they took the time to talk to us and give recommendations on what to eat. My friends and I were also celebrating one of our birthdays and they were able to accommodate to us at the last minute with a candle and happy birthday chocolate added to the dessert we ordered, along with a happy birthday song."
Such delicious burgers ....,"just now Great service and DELICIOUS burgers. Wide range of drinks options, and cocktails at reasonable prices. Will definitely be coming back"
Awesome dinner experience,"Had an awesome dinner experience at The ranch, thanks to the wonderful team who did extra and very attentive. Special note to Mr Mohan who make our evening more special. Definitely one of our best dinner experience, comparable to some if not better than higher end places."
Great service and unforgettable food,"My friend and I were walking around Clarke Quay last Sunday when we saw a promotion poster outside the restaurant. After confirming the promotion with the waitress at the front, we also ordered a dry-aged beefsteak and a bottle of red wine as recommended by her.

We were seated in the alfresco area as the restaurant ruled that customers ordering the promotion can not sit in the indoor air-conditioned area. No biggie, the outside air was cooled by an earlier afternoon rain anyway.

The dry-aged steak was tender and its flavour was very intense. This could be the best steak we have had in recent memory. The burger was juicy. Every bite in this meal was a satisfying treat. We chatted for 2 hours, perhaps aided by the wine.

On trips to the indoor toilet, we noticed there were 2 tables in the indoor air-conditioned area, with a total of 6 guests having the same promotional burgers. This was especially puzzling as we were denied from sitting indoor for ordering the promotion. There were still empty tables outside. We noticed among them, a man seems to be authoritative over the restaurant staffs, making us question if the restaurant's rules apply to him and everyone equally.

Though the service and food were great, the doubt of preferential treatment kept us from calling this restaurant excellent. We hope that the management can look into this matter and cast away our doubt."
Amazing Steak,"Best restaurant in Singapore, amazing steaks cooked exactly how you want. Good value for money and the sides were great too. The staff were very welcoming and friendly and I would recommend anyone who loves steak to try this place out, when you visit Singapore."
Superb birthday dinner experience!,"My girlfriend and myself visited this restaurant on 26th March 2020 for her birthday dinner. On arrival, I was immediately struck by the very warm welcome and relaxing dining atmosphere.
We selected smoked salmon and octupus respectively for starters and each had a steak for our main course. All the food was cooked to perfection, including the fries, vegetables and mushrooms which were the side dishes.
What impressed me most though was the outstanding service. All the service staff were very friendly and efficient, but special praise must go to the waiter that personally served us, a Pakistani gentleman whose warmth, hospitable nature and attention to detail made the evening especially memorable and delightful. All in all a perfect birthday dinner, and a very special evening."
Great steak great service,"On a recent visit to Clarke Quay we decided to eat at the Ranch Steakhouse as we all like a steak occasionally. Well we were in for a treat the steaks were cooked to perfecion , the atmosphere was really good and the staff were very pleasant making sure we enjoyed our meal. Prices were very reasonable. Definitely worth a visit."
Good price to quality,We had a great time and good wine. The steak has been done just right and the atmosphere was nice as well.
Great Steak and Service,"Really great steak place in Clarke Quay! We had their special - T-bone & also their Burger. Cooked amazingly... plus the service was impeccable. Very friendly, and if AJ is your waiter you‚Äôre in luck. Enjoy the food and service here!"
"Great staff, Great ambience, Great FOOOOOOOOD!!! OMG!!!","This a restaurant(RANCH) you definitely need to visit if you LOVE beef. I only decide to write a review after visiting this place after the fourth time and every time this restaurant never disappoints me... The Head Chef Dean & Chef Jason, try to find time during his busy service to come to the tables to ask how was everything go with our meal and to every customer and WOW us amazing personality from small chats to carving beef table side. It was a true experiences you have to dine into truly experiences...

The Second visit Their signature burger
The Third visit 600gm Dry age Ribeye ($19/100gm)

***Where can you find Dry age Beef at this price at this kind of location***

As you can see above I Love My BEEEEEEEF... perfectly cooked Medium Rare and every time I order the beef I literality eat the meat off the bone... and perfectly seasoned beef that doesn't need any sauce just simple salt and pepper. It did not only Wowed me but every guest I brought with me... We could stop talking on how great the food is and this place has never disappoint.

We'll be back in a few weeks to taste the new menu!!!

Cheers!!!"
As good as the reviews suggest,We are here for my 60th Birthday. The steak is superb and the service was warm and welcoming. We would highly recommend to anyone who wants a quality steak.
Comfort food for Nebraskans,"You can‚Äôt take your favourite food to another culture and expect it to measure up, however, this place did and exceeded some places in the ‚Äúbeef state‚Äù
Service was superb, food was attractive and taste matched everything else.
The environment was at a happening place, but when they shut the doors, it became quiet.
Reservations are a must. Specify on the quay or inside. You can get there by water taxi"
Great Valentines day dinner.,Great Valentines day dinner. Good service and great food. Steak was really delicious and cooked to perfection. Good service too on a busy night
Best steak I have ever had,"Lovely clean, extensive wine list. Service was exceptional, very attentive staff, food was wonderful, we had the Australian black Angus steak and it was cooked to perfection, we had the garlic mash and asparagus to accompany. The bread with truffle butter was equally as delicious. If you like a good steak,do yourself a favour and visit this gem."
Nothing special,"Run of the mill, touristy area restaurant. Average service, unable to accomodate simple requests. Average steaks."
Good meat at a fair price,"I went there alone, to have dinner. The service was quick and very friendly. The meat was excellent."
Awesome Food / Gorgeous Atmosphere,This was my 2nd time here and the food was sooo good. We had the aged beef and we really enjoyed the flavour and the tenderness of the meat. The staff knows their product and were very friendly. I will recommend The Ranch for their awesome steak. Definitely will come again.
Another fantastic visit!,"Another fantastic visit to this gem in Clark Quay. Took my colleague and introduced him to dry aged beef and Chef Dean made it both memorable and educational. Also, the Spanish octopus is very good - tender and savory and prepared with love - and should be your starter along with the carpaccio."
Served beefsteak washed in water,"The food was decent, and the business set lunch was reasonably priced. The waiter was friendly but the service could be better. However, the restraunt manager was very aloof. He didn't rectify the issue raised and gave an insincere apology in a monotone. He started screening our preferred steak house, went on to brag about the restaurant aged dry beef and his years of overseas stay and how long he has been in the hotel and the F&B industry.....(what the hell does it have to do with our mishandled food?!)
Seems like even though he has a wealth of experience, he still cannot manage a small kitchen. I guess that's why he is still a restaurant manager after so many years, and at his old age.
It was a very quiet weekday lunchtime, just 3 tables filled to be exact. Justin was on his computer most of the time. I guess that is the job of the restaurant manager. We were horrified when we saw the cook wash and soak the beef steak in a tray of water repeatedly! After highlighting what we had seen to the waiter, he passed on a message from the chef that there was blood on the beefsteak, so they washed it. All of us had a rude shock to hear that, and wondered, ""Are we really in a steakhouse in Singapore, one of the world's cleanest countries?""
After paying the bill in full, we left the restaurant. We definitely are not coming back again to eat beefsteak washed in a tray of water."
Absolutely delicious and good,"Absolutely delicious and good value for money. We are here having considered CUT, but it was literally a third of the price and great. Highly recommend."
Great Steak Great Fun,"The Ranch is a very lively restaurant or it certainly was the night we were there
Very noisey at times but very good atmosphere
The Service was good and very personal
The steaks were outstanding and very reasonably priced in my view
This restaurant is well worth a visit"
Great steak great atmosphere,"The Ranch was buzzing and full of people enjoying themselves Sometimes a little to loud but all very Friendly atmosphere Steaks were superb, good wine list Very enjoyable all round evening Try this restaurant when in Singapore If you enjoy steak"
Great steakhouse with good service,great place with big tables and not close to each other . nice ambiance with very friendly and good service . Starters and main menu were great . In particular the steak was great. will come back for sure!!!
The only Astons my wife would go to,"This was my second visit to The Ranch with my family which consists of myself, my wife and three young children. There was no dress code. Establishment was welcoming of young children. The waiting staff was attentive and makes good and honest recommendations regarding the food items.

We ordered the roasted bone marrow appetizer which was perfect for myself as I was on a ketogenic diet and it was rich in fats and protein. We also had the black angus ribeye steak which proved to be consistent in quality and value. The iberico pork chop was less consistent in the sense that it took almost 45 minutes to arrive as compared to the first time we were there. The difference was in the thickness of the pork chop - this time it was twice as thick.

Overall, the food is of good quality and value. This is the only Astons that my wife would bug me to go to."
Great steak,"We sat at a table outside but the inside of the restaurant is nice. The steaks were tasty and tender. Great choice of sides, we had corn which was lovely. The service was very good. Would definitely return. Recommended."
Amazing - Highly recommended,"Always said Angus steak house in Benelmadena was the best steak place in the world. Think that is now in serious doubt after visiting the the ranch steak house.
Staff very friendly , food was perfection had ribeye, dauphinois potatoes and buttered asparagus - just amazing chefs all seem young they do a great job. All perfectly cooked
Definitely highly recommend"
"Delicious steak, delicious wine","My husband and I ate here one evening whilst in Singapore. We sat outside, it was a great spot for people watching and the steak was delicious. Very tender and cooked to perfection! We also had the truffle Mac n cheese as a side which was lovely. The wine was great and all for a fair price. Would definitely return!!"
Great Value for Money and Service,Excellent service and food served for perfectly cooked. I will definitely visit again and would highly recommend The Ranch at Clarke Quay.
Good food and good service,"Excellent ambience with wonderful food, beer and most of all very pleasant service by the staffs in this restaurant."
Great food and good times,Went to The RANCH for a drink and stayed for dinner and the entire evening. It's rare to find an exceptional restaurant like this in Clarke Quay. Their dedication to meat is obvious and their menu is one amazing item after another. The Beef Carpaccio is a treat. Do not miss and bring friends!
Raving success,"Not my first visit, and the reasons are many! Great quality food with excellent service (better than some hotels). Never fail to impress my guest.... Surprise to see that they serve wines from Zambujeiro, great choice to match the meat."
Birthday dinner,"Love love this place.. love the deco.. love the service.. love the food.. my first visit and they exceeded my expectations of food and service. Heard and read rave reviews of the place and felt a need to try it. The service staff were excellent. They warmly welcome us when we step in.. were totally attentive to serve us and recommend their signature porterhouse even before we ask. We had the pan fried foie gras, Caesar salad, the 240 days grain fed sirloin and liberico pork chop... All the dishes were so nicely done, yummylicious and well valued. When the staff know it‚Äôs my birthday dinner treat, they were ever ready to present me a lava cake dessert, on the house. The servers here took real good care and pride to provide tip top service which is sadly lacking in most restaurants, even in the very high end Michelin restaurants, nowadays. There is really nothing not to like about this place. I will be back."
Amazing Food!,"Service was first rate. Welcomed us immediately very friendly. The steak was by far some of the best I have ever eaten. The atmosphere was quiet, relaxing - perfect for a night out."
"Meat fair, service very bad","The meat is fairly good, the service very bad. Probably because the service charge is included regardless if is good or not"
Service needs to be betyer,"Food was def value for money.
Was not expecting steakhouse service but server forgot our orders and mixed them up.

Really hope the basics of service can be achieved because it‚Äôs a great restaurant otherwise. Will return again in any case and really hope to see an improvement in service."
Great steaks,"Great service, great food, great steaks. Nice and quiet ambience for weekday lunch. Perfect medium rare steak. The aging can probably be better done though."
Dinner,The Food was great and the waitress Miu made sure we had a wonderful meal and evening. The price of the food was more than fair.
"Nice food, smaller portions","This was our last meal in Singapore, it was a lovely venue and pleasant staff but the duck portion was quite small for my husband. It was nice but quite expensive."
Amazing steak!,This is the place to visit if you want a good steak perfectly prepared and serviced. The meat was of very good quality and they definitely know how to do their steak. The wine list was pretty good as well.
Fantastic Steak,"First of all the staff were absolutely fantastic at this restaurant which made the place so enthusiastic about there jobs and it really came across well! The decor in the restaurant is absolutely fantastic and the steak selection even better!
I went for the tenderloin steak and it was cooked to perfection , the mash potato and garlic clove to accompany it was perfect!

All my other friends enjoyed their meals as well and it was finished off with a chocolate and coffee lava cake which was to die for !

The only slight niggle I have with this restaurant is for a reasonably sized restaurant one toilet between everyone I don‚Äôt think is sufficient!"
Great food,"Twice in 3 days - same cut both visits, cooked as requested, taste was awesome, the creamed spinach is also worthy of note - excellent service and cool beer - worth a visit while in Singapore."
After a slow start they came home strong!,"second night wandering around Clarke Quay. We decided to settle on some steak in place of the usual cuisine. We found the Ranch Steakhouse in Block B of the restaurants. The menu was quite good. we first order the drinks and then the meals. The drinks took quite a while to come out. I don't know what people don't get in these places. bring the drinks and keep the tab clicking over! Anyway onto the meals, the other ordered strip loins medium well to well done (Barbarians!). I ordered the medium 350 gram rib eye. When the food was delivered they got the order wrong. my 350 gram rib eye turned into a strip loin, anyway the manager was quick to address the situation and all was good. they supplied a second round of accompaniments (pommies and asparagus) free of charge and an additional beer. The steak was fantastic as were the sides. It wasn't a great experience however they did their best resolve the issues."
Great selection of dry aged beef displayed in the Fridge,"I was there at lunchtime and had one of the lunch specials. It was ok, but I think I would have preferred to come for an evening for one of the larger dry aged steaks and some wine. They had some very nice bottles of wine on display."
"good dinner, good time","near the MRT station, city hall, walking about 10min. in the center of Clark Quay. one of the ""HOT"" space in Singapore."
Best Steak in Years,"We had a family meal here including grandmother and three children, all the meals were excellent quality and service was fast and attentive. The waiters wine recommendation was spot on.
The restaurant interior is a fun and relaxed yet high quality fixtures, including very comfortable chairs. Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys top quality steak cooked to perfection.
Not cheap but still good value given the quality and overall ambiance and service levels.
5 STARS!"
Nice restaurant and good attentive service,"Pleasantly surprised by the attention and service one gets. Manager named Hendricks is excellent, made good recommendations from the menu. Food is great too. I will be back very soon."
Great ambience and good quality,The ranch has a nice environment. The service is excellent and attentive. We try their prized aged beef and regular new Zealand steaks. Its is good quality but I find it over price for it. I can find equally good beef and dishes in other restaurants without paying this much
Really well priced and delicious,"Having only recently arrived with my wife into central Singapore, we strolled down to Clarke Quay and came here just as it was opening. The prices were reasonable and the food excellent, with the wine we paired with it also very good. We both had the US ribeye which was tasty and perfectly cooked with sauces and sides all spot on. I would highly recommend it and would say the service was top notch. One thing on would say is that there seemed to be a staff meeting going on which may have been a little tense but maybe it could be finished prior to opening."
Great taste and friendly staff,"We went for steaks dinner and found the place very nice and staff was friendly, we liked the simplicity of the restaurant decoration. Meat was excellent ( Australian rib eye) so were the sides ( creamy spinach and fries). Serving fresh bread with truffle butter before the meal is a brilliant idea. The sauces for meat are served in a very tiny portions, excellent bearnaise, the truffle perigord was less good, didn‚Äôt really have a truffle taste - those were the only small things away from perfection. All sides at 10 $, one could argue this is too much. Open wine by glasses was very good and at rasonable prices as for SG standards. We will come back to try the 700 g steak next time...but in a bigger group to try more things."
VIP service with excellent food,"Executive Chef Dean was extremely accommodating and friendly to my group, ensuring that we had a great culinary experience. Coupled with the great food recommendation from another extra-dinary chef Jason Yip; using his experience to rest 2 different types of aged beef. It was a first for us, and definitely would be back soon. A big thank you to the team, the service was top notch!"

Great Food and Service,"This is an excellent steakhouse, not just for the quality of the food and wine but also the quality of the staff and service. If you are planning a trip to Clarke Quay and fancy a good steak, look no further than here, prices are very reasonable when you consider the quality of the food."
