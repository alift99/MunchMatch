Great Central Asian Food,"This river fronted restaurant located on Robertson Quay has both outdoor and indoor seating. As ours was a large group, we were seated at an inside table, close to the show kitchen, and we could see the chef in action . Also, the inside is air conditioned, which makes it more attractive if the weather is wet or muggy, which is usually the case in Singapore.
We ordered starters which included hummus and flat breads. We had to order pita breads separately, but they were oven hot when they reached our table. The vegetarian kabab platter was excellent, and easily served the six of us dining there. The Chicken sheikh was tastier than the lamb sheikh kabab, and came with saffron rice. We also ordered an okra curry which came in a rich tomato gravy.
The highlight of the evening was the belly dance. It was entertaining, perhaps more so because the dancer was probably a Thai or Singapore girl, and not the Turkish dancer one would have expected.
The wine list is extensive, but they also have draft beers, which go great with central asian foods."
Fake Persian doesn’t taste like real Persian food,"I know Persian food well and have eaten in Persian restaurants all over the world including my home country of Iran.
We got starters (mix platter), mains (kebabs and ghorme Sandi stew).

Starters came out cold despite being advertised as warm. Meat and chicken were fatty and meat in the stew was

Overall food tastes like Indian food not Persian food and made with wrong spices. Will not be visiting again."
EXCELLENT,"An excellent place. i can't say enough good about this place.

Now, food was excellent.

Of course you can have the kebabs which are excellent but many places serve these. go for some other items which you do not see often. I especially enjoyed the Persian stews. The first course plates looked excellent. I suggest you try something different.
You have both indoor and outdoor dining and a nice Alcohol Selection.
Service was excellent and friendly"
Good food and location needs to improve choice if white wines,Restaurant in great location on the river Food was lovely had hummus and bread Prawns and taboulli yummy. Could not however say the same for the wine limited choice for white wine by the glass
Repeat visit,"Service is as good as before, salad n appetiser too. As for the main, the meat was too well done. I didn’t want to inform the staff as I didn’t want to make a scene with my guest. That was kinda disappointing"
Great experience:),"Food was definitely the best, really amazing Persian food like the ones you get in Beverly Hills. Great job chef :)"
Perfect,"Celebrated my husbands birthday with great food, excellent servos and cozy atmosphere. Must try it out. Thanks"
Good restaurant in front the river,We visited this restaurant few times. Food is good and I like the presentation of the dishes. Nice location in front the river with indoor and outdoor table. Price in the average of the restaurants in the area. Wine list a little bit expensive.
"Best Fine Iran Cuisine in Singapore and the staff are friendly, welcoming and helpful!","Best Fine Iran Cuisine in Singapore and the staff are friendly, welcoming and helpful! Our favorite dishes were the kebabs and eggplant stew. Very grateful and thankful to Ajay and Rahul for taking good care of us during our visit."
Best !,I’m new to Singapore and since my husband and I arrived we been trying few restaurants and new cuisine. So far this is my favourite middle eastern food. It’s just amazing
"Would have been 5*, had it not for one bad egg( staff)","We decided to celebrate my sister’s birthday at this restaurant upon stumbling upon it on a trip to Robertson quay.
The date was set for 03/03 dinner.
We decided we should start the dinner with some shared mezze.
We ordered 3 to be shared between 4 of us.
No problem, the staff serving us were polite and friendly.
When it was time to order our mains, we asked for the menu again.
This time, disaster stuck.
The waiter( Ronnie ) came and asked if we wanted 4 menus, there’s 4 of us. Needless to say, if this claim to be a finest Persian’ restaurant. This question would not be raised.
I replied, unless you want us to share reading the menu.
Judging from us sitting on a square table, it would be rather challenging to crank our necks, let alone raking more time to take turns to have a look at the menu.
He made a snide remark that still resonate in my head this morning.
He said’ well, you shared your food so why not the menu’
Thus was the worse kind of service a restaurant can have.
We have also noticed he was especially friendly to other tables of ‘western guest’ but pretty hostile and if I should say, frown upon us.
I arrived into Singapore as a tourist but my family is from Singapore.
I am starting to think, this restaurant had hired a very bad customer facing staff.
This is exceptionally detrimental for a restaurants business.
Either he should be sacked, moved to back kitchen or undergo extensive training.
I raised that with another staff, his name is Sabin.
This young gentleman was nothing like the other.
He made us feel welcome.
I told him that I would not like to see Ronnie serving us again and praise the lord, he did not.
We enjoyed ourselves the rest of the evening.
There is another staff that served us, it’s a shame I did not get his name but I could see he is of ‘Malay origins’ he is just as friendly as Sabin.
There was another older gentleman in a white shirt, he was also friendly.
So, all in all, it was good except for this Ronnie.
I made it a point to get his name.
When the meal was over, I had a chat with JoJo about the whole thing. She mentioned that Ronnie had a cold sense of humour.
It was definitely cold, humour I don’t think so.
There was nothing humorous about that snide comment.
We definitely were not laughing.
I would have given the restaurant a 5* had it not been for that incident.
The meal was good.
My sister was even presented with a birthday slice of cake.
That is good customer service.
Would I visit it again?
This would be if the restaurant acknowledges this review and the reply it post back."
Service couple of notch lower than the price they charge,"Before I could finish my food, the waiters tried to take my plate away.. not once, twice but three time. I was so annoyed the third time that I gave it away… with a bit of an complaint that I wanted to finish the yogurt if they allowed me too. Unhappy with the approach. The manager try to calm me down with a set of free yogurt… that pissed me off even more."
Exotic Ambience and Food to match,"The best of Middle-Eastern cuisines in our opinion- Persian cuisines! The way the dishes are prepared - with exotic ingredients and marinated for many hours; and the way they are cooked and presented! And the exotic decor and the outdoor sitting to complement the dining experience. Too bad we miss the belly dancing performances. For a party of 4, we started with the Appetizer Platter (5 types including hummus, etc) with bread. And the mains of kebabs (chicken masti and pasand beef kebab). And for the Persian dishes mains, we had the Bahala Polo Mahicheh (lamb) and the Khoreh-E-Ghureh-O-Bademjan (Eggplants in tomato saffron sauce). Finished with desserts baklava and kunafe. Total cost plus a bottle of wine is S$388"
Good meal especially if you like pomegranates!,"Chanced upon this restaurant when staying at the Warehouse hotel not too far away. Despite not having a reservation for a Friday evening, we were promptly seated at a table outside the restaurant - we preferred that anyway to bring in an air-con place - under cover with cool evening breeze but away from the tropical rain. The service staff were friendly and more importantly, knowledgeable of the menu. We received the house flatbreads which came warm and were delicious especially when eaten with the dips we ordered. These came as a set of about 5 and the pomegranate with walnuts was delicious, as was the hummus and cheese and yoghurt dip. It was more than enough for two. We also ordered a chicken (instead of duck) with walnut sauce which turned out to be a variation of the walnut-pomegranate dip we had. Oh well. But it was treated differently so the sauce was delicious, the chicken though, was a little dry. It came with Persian style rice which was long-grain and saffron dressed. Very nice. Presentation was lovely and the rice came in two separate servings to allow us to share. We were saving our tiny tummies that were filling up fast for dessert. Sadly those were a disappointment. The ice-cream with vermicelli was overpowered by saffron which left a not to pleasant note on the palate. the baklava wasn’t too sweet but it wasn’t as nutty as Turkish or Greek baklava (everyone has their own variations we were told). The baklava was again, a little dry. The bill wasn’t horrendous and the staff were good company, even sharing tips and a contact for a trip to the Maldives if we ever wanted to visit! And as it was raining when we left, they fretted over possible slippery walkways and our lack of an umbrella. But we managed not to melt!"
Amazing dining experience,"Came with my family to celebrate Christmas and was amaze by their great service. GM Madan and Ismail are very friendly and approachable which makes the dining experience amazing. The food taste fantastic, we ordered shandiz, tekeh masti and bakhtiari beef and my kids loved it."
"Good food, good service",Ordered a number of the lamb dishes which were great. The kebab platter was also good with the different dips. Wine selection is ok but overall good variety for drinks. Well worth a visit.
Amazing food and ambience!,"Good service, amicable staff and nice ambience. The food was aptly priced. Additionally, the staff were quite accommodating."
Exemplary food and customer service :),"Exemplary customer service from Shabestan. What left a mark on me was the attention to detail and humbleness of the staff named Tommy - he was knowledgeable on the food recommendations and was spot on the portions that we have ordered. I think I wrote to the restaurant about requesting a small cake to celebrate my partners birthday but I think the restaurant forgot, but my partner did mention it subtlety. We ordered some dessert and then came a cake later on. I am pretty sure even without that gesture I would have left a raving review of him and the restaurant. He even refused a tip.

Food is exemplary and delicious but I think what will make me come back will be the memory of humbleness and the exemplary service that Tommy has provided.

To the management of Shebastan, you have a gem in him. Really felt his warmth and care of us"
Review,Terrible service. Extremely disrespectful staff. They really have an attitude and do not know how to treat a customer.
Excellent food,Great food and great service. Highly recommend the shrimp rice and the homemade cheese. Mix of comforting and gourmet flavours!
Good place for Middle Eastern Food,"The food tasted great. As a vegetarian, I am glad there is a separate vegetarian/vegan menu. However, portion sizes seem unbalanced, as some of the main course dishes were much more heavier than others. Overall, a bit expensive though."
Expensive but good,Have shared Lamb and beef kebab- both succulent and good. A bit on the pricey side though. Next time the set lunch recommended
Delightful Persian Cuisines,"We’ve ordered again from Shabestan Persian Restaurant. The food is tasty and the prices are reasonable. We had the hummus, falafel, muhamara (walnut paste), kashke-e-bademjan (meshed eggplant), Khor est-E-bamieh (okra), khoresh-E-gureh-o-jujeh-bademjan (chicken with eggplants), javaher polo with chicken (ginger chicken) and chicken & lamb kubideh kebab. All come with rice and bread. Total cost S$194 (enough for 4-5 persons)."
Great but subtle changes to food quality,"Starters and Kobedeh were great as always but they have seemingly reduced the amount of rice and more disturbingly, Shah Pasand chicken that says it breast seemed to have lots of thigh meat that was disappointing. i would keep paying the high price for the food as stated"
When nowhere table was available,"Warm and welcoming staff. Delicious food, good portion to share and their bread is not to be missed - never had one like that in Singapore before."
Experience at Shabestan,It was a great experience. The servers were very polite and accommodating. We think that you should provide more bread. One for each person.
Nowruz lunch at Shabestan,"Excellent food, with generous portions. Sadly the new management and staff lack the charm of the previous crew, and the legendary Persian hospitality. The staff should be trained to be more attentive."
"Good Food, good value lunch set","This place is always packed on weekends, but is typically 70% empty on weekdays at lunch (like most of Robertson Quay), which is a pity because they have a good lunch set at $48 where you pick 1 Mezze and 2 mains - maybe not everybody wants such a heavy weekday lunch and they should offer a smaller option...
Have been once for lunch and once for dinner and the food is very good - can't tell if its authentic Persian but it tastes good and the portions are generous. Service is also very good and attentive - but maybe because there's hardly anyone else there...throughout my lunch there was only 1 other table occupied.
One mild oddity is the Wine list - given the Middle Eastern menu and decor you would expect some Lebanese wines and the like, but it's the usual French/italian?Australian offerings here."
excellent!,"food and service were outstanding! food was tasty authentic, portions were generous and delicious>thanks"
"Good Food, friendly & great service by staff.","Were there on 2 Feb for our son's birthday dinner. Love the food, ambience and services rendered. Would love to come again."
Consistency at its best!,"Always a pleasure going to Shabestan, love the kebab platters....always consistent in food and service. Its our go-to for Middle Eastern food!"
Order the lamb shank!,A staycation in Robertson Quay means a chance to try various cuisines available in the area. Chanced upon Shabestan while walking along the river. Noted the Persian cuisine but was cautious about trying out the food as there were not many customers compared to the surrounding pubs and eateries. The photo of the lamb shank wooed us into the restaurant. We ordered that plus the eggplant appetizer. The lamb shank tasted as excellent as the photo portrayed! The meat was tender and it just falls off the bone. The stew was very flavorful too. The staff were attentive and helpful. Worth a visit!
Pretty good vegetarian options.,Our family favourite for Middle Eastern cuisine. Hope you guys can add more vegetarian options to the menu.
"Best Persian food with family,the","Best Persian food with family,the lamb was simply amazing!!! Strongly recommend this restaurant with family and kids!! Great service too!!"
Dinner at Shabestan,"Good food and ambience. we ordered a whole lot of starters. the bread, muhammara and humus were very good. for chilli fans, do ask them for their special chilli!"
Delicious Al-Fresco Riverside Date Night,"By far my favourite Middle Eastern cuisine restaurant in Singapore. This is our go-to date night spot - delicious food, wonderful service and al-fresco dining by the river ... what could be better !?! They have a Gluten free menu which I really appreciate as I am coeliac. By the way, the best Hummus !!!! And the eggplant stew is amazing!!"
Sunday night dinner,"Good food, good portions and great people! I was very satisfied with their service :)
Little expensive but good ambience.
They took really long with the billing towards the end (even thought it wasn’t crowded). But overall I won’t rate the experience bad."
Nice Ambience and Food,"Was looking for a place to have a get together, and this place was recommended. It was my first time at Shabestan, and I found the place has a nice ambience and food. Certainly worth a repeat visit, especially for the food."
Improvement needed,"Thought about supporting the restaurants during these though times. Visited the UNCABUNCA restaurant which was as delightful as always. We then headed to Shabestan which was empty with only employees seating down and 2 tables at the terrace.

The waitress was good but I guess she needed more training.

Now, the best part! The Kebabs were amazing as usual, the falafel was fine, Can't complain much on the Gulf Salad even though there was only 1 piece of olive. I guess this was one of their cost cutting measures. Fully understandable.

The Hummus was fabulous, we had 2 plates. As for the DOLMA,we didn't really enjoy it. Nevertheless, I ate all 4 pieces and kept one to show the Kitchen team. The Dolma was completely wet/soggy and soaked in oil. It started to break when you pick it up. Even though the grapevine leaves were wrapped properly, it didn't really go well.

Lastly, before you jump to any conclusions always listen to your customers feedback as this will only make you better. Taste may vary from one person to another without any shout of a doubt but basic quality is essential. The Staff decided to remove the Dolma from the bill which I didn't ask for as I was only giving a genuine feedback.

Last but not the least, on a sweet note. The Homemade Chilli was amazing!"
Excellent meal and service,"We came across the night a buffet was set up. Multiple choices, lamb, chicken , hummus, bread and grape leave rolls were excellent quality. Service was great. We will return here for sure"
Average place :s,"The location is very pretty, the good it’s just average, prices are midrange but the food isn’t great... :(
I was expecting better!
Rice has a very strange flavor
And for a glass of you hurt they charge 14!!! It’s a lot!"
Vegetarian Selections,Great ambiance by the Singapore river to have an alfresco setting. This restaurant offers great selections of vegetarian menu. Friendly staff and were very attentive to guests needs.
Dinner,"Great location of course by the river. Fabulous menu choices, great flavours and really super service."
Persia on a Plate,"Honestly didn't expect such good Persian nosh sitting in Singapore. Spacious interiors with a small outdoor seating area as well. Helpful and courteous staff. My 7-year old boy definitely liked it.
We ended up ordering more than we could eat, including a huge meat platter (with mouth-watering kebabs and koftas). Wasn't a fan of the rice - it was fragrant and was way too buttery, something I was ready to overlook as the rest of the food compensated for the lack of taste.
I feel that the pricing is pretty much on the heavier side which makes it not a very value-for-money restaurant."
Amazing food!,"The food that we ordered was really good! The amount of food that they give is really value for money. I went with my two friends and we each ordered 1 plate of food, and we found not finish it! Not many places have this and my friends and I agree that it was refreshing. I just wish that they had a little more vegetarian options. But otherwise it was really good! I will really recommend!"
"Good food, good service and nice location","Been to this place 4-5 times and absolutely love the food. They've decent range of vegetarian dishes as well, which is great. They hummus is one of the best! The dishes are reasonably priced for the location and the quality of food & service.
The staff members are nice and provide a timely service.
We generally prefer sitting outside for the view. On weekdays, you can walkin and manage to get seats without long waiting time. However, I'd suggest making a reservation if you've particular choice of seating or if it's a weekend/holiday."
Dinner at Shabestan,"The food was good ,specially the main dishes and the appetizers. the atmosphere was excellent and calm."
Mixed feelings about this,"Mixed feelings about this restaurant, starter great, main a little blah and bill large especially for a bottle of wine I can get for a quarter of price at home"
Great Lamb kebab and falafel,"Considering the average prices for restaurants in Singapore, the Shabestan was the best cost and quality balance place we visited. Also we had great service from its staff. Recommend the lamb kebab and the falafel."
We went there for casual dinner,"We went there for casual dinner on Friday evening as their menu has several vegetarian options.
The starters were great and the servings are big.
Drinks were creative and quickly served.
Main menu dishes( okra & egg plant) were disappointing. The taste was very much similar. Should be avoided.

In summary, go for drinks & starters only! Advance booking on weekends help!"
Redefining Excellence,"Excellent quality of food, good service by staff, lovely view - excellent package.
Had been craving for some good food since morning and this restaurant came to my mind and ended up going in the evening with family.
All of us enjoyed a lot.
As I mentioned, staff is helpful and polite. The problem what happens with most successful restaurants is that the quality of service and food goes down - but this management has kept their standards high. I wish them best of luck!"
Fabulous food and excellent service,Great quayside location and the food here is cooked to perfection. The waiters were attentive - we ate here twice and couldn't fault it.
Slow service,"The restaurant was empty when we arrived at around 3.45pm.

Within 10 minutes the tables were occupied. My humble take is that the food is great but the service need to compliment the food.

This is our 3rd visit and we felt that the restaurant was short staffed. However, everything else was excellent."
Superb dining experience,We had a lovely meal here. They have a BIG gluten free menu and food are delicious!!! Staff and manager are professional and very friendly. Definitely recommended!!!!
Excellent lamb,The lamb cutlets were as tender and good as I have taken. They were excellent. The chicken and fillet beef were ok.
Taste of Persia in Singapore,"I've visited Iran before and had the best kebabs. Located along the Singapore river, this place hands down serves the best Kebab in Singapore. Chicken is so succulent and the rice so fluffy and savory. My friends picked up this restaurant for my birthday and the head chef gave us special treat. Thank you Chef Hosseini :) Will definitely visit again."
Delightful Surprise,"My husband is Lebanese - we are always on the lookout for good Middle Eastern cuisine. We had walked past Shabestan a number of times, but never quite managed to get ourselves inside. Last Saturday we finally did - why did we wait so long? The food is very, very good. We had a duck dish with a pomegranate / walnut based gravy - outstanding. Various grilled bits - beef, lamb, chicken and an aubergine vegetable dish. There are more vegetarian options, mostly in the starters section. Everything we had was good. Shabestan also has a selection of classic cocktails and a decent wine list. Service is polite, competent, attentive. The ambiance inside is a bit on the functional side, but outside seating is very nice. We plan to come back many times."
Polished Persian Portions,"Come here for the chill vibe & wide choice of Middle Eastern Fare. Alfresco is best, we even braved the moderate haze!

We like the smooth hummus served with toasty flatbread.

The grilled chicken served with two types of rice was a winner too; meat was tender, flavorful & well marinated.

The fact that they serve tap water was also a plus. We like!"
Delicious food facing the river,"Persian cuisine as an amalgam of Far East and Middle Eastern accents, with some eastern Mediterranean inspiration (credit: Garin Pirnia - The Takeout's Guide). I think this is a good summation of what Persian cuisine is to the uninitiated. We had Shah Pasand Chicken (like chicken kebab) and Prawn kebab. Both were delicious (a tad salty but overall it was ok) which was a meal by itself with basmati rice and side salad."
Food Melts in You Mouth,"This is a worthwhile experience in Singapore. Persian food is not on the top of my list, but here is ho the food is cooked rather than the dishes themselves. he meets and seafood ae cooked so they ae tender and tasty. The presentaiton is excellent and the service superb. Try the Dips, which were delicious."
Best restaurant in Singapore,"I have been in Singapore for the last 17 years for business and if i want a perfect meal combined with perfect service i always go to this restaurant!,
The food and service of the staff and especially the mangager Madan Kishor makes me come back there every time when i am in Singapore for business if i want to enjoy a perfect meal with excellent service
Regards Carlo"
Delicious and homely,Very nice unpretentious place. Enjoyed ourselves very much. The waitress was very helpful; she made really good recommendations and the dishes were all spot on! Thank you for a lovely experience.
Good Iranian food,We visited this place and its location by the river is very nice. They serve authentic Persian food. The kebab sultani was exceptionally good the kebab koobedeh was average the appetizers and dough drink were nice. Finally for desert we ordered Fallodeh and it was superb.
Nice food with good vegetarian choice,We had a nice meal here with a good range of vegetarian options. Restaurant was nice and the price was reasonable.
Excellent Persian Restaurant,"An excellent Persian restaurant with very tasty and delicious food, located on the side of Singapore River at Robertson Quay area. We enjoyed our dinner and the mixed grill with rice and kebabs were very good selections.

The indoor setting area is nice and the atmosphere is relaxing. They also have a very nice outdoor seating area and you may select if weather condition permits. Prices are expensive, yet the food quality deserves the experience."
Authentic Persian food in Singapore,"We live in London which is the king of Persian food in my opinion, there are several Persians in my family and we have it all over the world - especially Cello Kebab.

Therefore:

Visiting a cello kebabi in Singapore, I was a bit skeptical but was pleased with the Barg (fillet) and Koobideh (mince) and the lovely fluffy rice. The price tag is on the higher side I have seen for this kind of food but the Qaulity was good and Singapore is famously expensive so it is was it is.

Service and Ambiance are both spot on. Well done team."
Delicious late lunch,"We had the prawn kebab & Appetiser Platter - delicious! By far the best Middle Eastern food we have eaten in Singapore - great service, and without the hustling experience & rude service in some of the restaurants in the Arab quarter!"
Great mains and service,"The service was excellent and the staff were friendly and informative when we enquired about the food. The starters are delicious - we had the appetiser platter ($35) which is a selection of 5 appetisers. For mains we had the Shandiz ($48), Shah Pasand Chicken ($39), Kebab Barg ($45), Mix Kubideh Kebab ($34), and Baghala Polo Mahicheh ($47). The Shah Pasand was amazing - the breast was moist and well-seasoned. The rice served with the dishes is also great. For desserts, we ordered the Persian Ice Cream ($8) and Baghlava ($10). The ice cream was nice but the baghlava - which we were looking forward to the most - was a real disappointment. It was hard and unevenly cut and very, very dry."
Wonderful restaurant but too expensive,"Had a wonderful evening here. The location and views are magical being right on the water with boats passing by. The entire area is adorable with an active scene of restaurants and bars. The wait staff were very friendly but a tad slow and we weren't always sure they got our order right.

The food is simply delicious and so well prepared. The hummus was light and flavorful and the Iranian bread was perfection. All the meats were grilled wonderfully. My only complaint is that for a family of 4 our bill was 355 sgd which seem excessive for a Middle Eastern dinner. Still the delightful environment and delicious food made up for the exorbitant price."
"Food, Service, Ambience all wonderful","Food and service are the reasons you will go back to a place, Shabestan adds ambience to the mix. Every dish I ordered was flavorful and fresh. Every dish had it’s on flavor. And the staff was extremely attentive, keep in mind that this place is empty at lunch time on weekdays."
Very nice ambience and good food at reasonable cost,"The restaurant is situated amidst the buzz of Mohammad Sultan Road, but has a decent indoor and outdoor space. The ambience is pleasant, less noisy and has good lighting. The menu is very good (even for vegetarians) and the service pretty good. Above all, prices are reasonable."
Great hummus!,"Delicious food, friendly service and great vegan options - very good value. Hummus was divine and so was the okra dish!"
Awesome,The food and ambient is terrific. Good choice of food for Vegetarians is also available. A big plus!
Good for a special occasion,"Our party of three ordered from their vegetarian selection and my top picks are their Hummus and Muhammara which come with Iranian bread. We also loved the Khorest-E- Bhamieh which is like an okra curry that is flavourful with plenty of ground tomatoes forming the foundation of the mildly spicy gravy. We also ordered the all-vege Sabzi Kebab and Ceaser Persia salad, both of which were not memorable taste-wise but came in big portions. The baklava was tasty and one order has two pieces; we all gave it a thumbs up. Interestingly this is a halal restaurant that also serves alcohol and they do pour their wine generously, which is great. Service was decent - you can get the attention of wait-staff easily and they are quite obliging."
Sin trip,"Wow wow wow!!! I have enjoyed middle eastern food in the Gulf on many occasions, Shabestan is up there. Great menu selection, helpful staff and great service. Food is just unbelievable. Fresh, tasty and plentiful. Price isn’t to bad for Singapore. Great atmosphere and located on Singapore River."
Fav Arab restaurant,"Our fav Arab restaurant in Singapore , my family love the food, great ambience nice staff , overall best"
Disappointing,"We had read good reviews & the menu reads well. The dining room & location are super. While we found the several dishes we ordered to be reasonably tasty, their presentation & the service was unsatisfactory. The staff were very nice & eager to please, but the amateurishness & clumsiness of our servers were often embarrassing. The desserts were not enjoyable. We would not go again."
Great food and service,Excellent food and service. We had a lovely time. The atmosphere of the restaurant is also lovely. Great experience
Deteriorating standards of a once iconic restaurant,"This was our fourth visit to the Shabestan which we sorely missed this time around. Not only was there a perceptable deterioration in the quality of food - being creatures of habit we usually order dishes we've tried and liked before - but the service was borderline indifferent. It was almost as if the restaurant is in cost management mode and is hiring below average wait staff and chefs. For a fairly expensive meal we left a considerable amount of food uneaten as it was either wanting taste or plain unpalatable. For example this was the first time the rice had little or no butter in it. The browned Tahdig bits were soggy, the kebab portions were smaller, and the chicken dish was sweeter than dessert - which was delivered at the fag end of the meal and for which the chef offered an implausible explanation. They did however replace this dish with another lamb dish which was passable.

This was certainly NOT the Shabestan we'd come to expect. We certainly will not visit by design anytime soon."
"Excellent food, I recommend it","Service was first class. Located beside the river in Robertson Q.but has an indoor section with ac.Good location.
The stew that I had was excellent. The okra was not overcooked as often happens. The side dish of hot sauce was nice.The bread was a pleasure.
In addition there is a nice selection of wine and beer."
Super Persian food and great ambiance,This restaurant has a good reputation and recommended by Iranian friends and we were not disappointed. Food was excellent and authentic with great service and a very personal and attentive manager over looking his team. Highly recommended for genuine food especially the rice.
Almost Perfect,Cleanliness of the dining table was compromised as there was a spec of dirt on the empty plate as well as the table cloth.
Good dining experience!,the food was good! will definitely recommend to my friends/colleagues. a must-go back restaurant to dine into.
The best,Our dinner here was fabulous. We shared the grilled combo...lamb beef chicken shrimp. Fantastic. Great atmosphere and loved the view of the river.
"Great food, service and location.","We had a really outstanding meal here while on a short trip to Singapore. The service was prompt and warm and the location is lovely, by the river. We enjoyed the stroll along the water from our hotel. The food was great, tasty and well cooked. I really recommend the noodle soup, another level of deliciousness! There was also lots of choice for vegetarians, always a bonus."
Worst Experience,"Looking for a nice Persian Restaurant, seeing the reviews, we landed up here, food was overpriced with poor quality, when we complained and asked to replace just one dish, which didn’t taste fresh and was very oily, they simply refused, we were so shocked with their couldn’t care and be bothered attitude, it was so poor, we left the restaurant having ordered 4 dishes, left all the food and paid the full bill and went to dine at another restaurant, you would be so surprised that no one even bothered to come up and speak with us."
Not really iranian food...,"As an iranian myself I wouldnt call this an iranian restaurant, its more like a middleeastern one. The waiters werent iranian which was a new experience for me. The food was overpriced and didnt really taste right.

Im guessing the chefs werent iranian either. Im really disappointed, especially because of the price."
Delicious Persian Food,"The food scene is amazing in this restaurant! We went on a Friday night to have some yummy Iranian dinner after having heard a lot about this place & it didn’t disappoint at all! It was easy to get a table reserved online for 4! The variety of food option for both veg & non veg is a lot! We tried a bunch of vegetarian dishes and they were simply mouthwateringly tasty! The Chef’s special appetizer platter was just too good, my favorite was the cheese & hummus dips! The falafel wrap was huge for a person & made very well! Everything we ate was very tasty & well presented! The decor is very Persian and the open kitchen concept is also very cool. The service was tad bit slow but it didn’t bother us as we enjoyed our meal with some Prosecco! Next time we would love to try some meats & preferably get an outdoor seating."
Great Persian food,"Big menu card can make it difficult to choose, but if you go with the chefs recommendation you are in for a treat. Order for sharing. Good food at reasonable prices."
Dinner along the river,"First try at the restaurant and a very good experience.
We had dinner outside along the river , nice, relaxing outdoor seating.
The starter and the main courses were really tasty, uncommon ,a nice discovery.
The portions are huge.... a main course can be easily shared by 2 if it comes with a starter.
Prices are bit expensive like most of the places along the river ( except for the glasses of wine )."
great place,We ordered the appetizer platter which was indeed excellent!! Loved it. We ordered curry lamb- which was great- but a bit heavy for us. Guess we were already full from the platter! Definitely going again to try the orher stuff.
First time eating Persian,Went here after wondering if they served any persian food here. Saw the ratings and decided to give it a try with my family. We were all impressed with the service and quality of food! It’s very likely we will go back again. Beautiful ambience as well.
"Disappointing food, service pretty poor.","Lured by the enticing ambience and great photos of the food in the menu we were expecting to have our tastebuds tickled. Unfortunately, our choices were bland and tasteless. Just a mains, one beer and one glass of wine came to just shy of 150 Singapore dollars (about £95). Beware, they charged for water we did not ask for. Great work by the photographer!

I don’t like to write poor reviews but the service wasn’t great either. We paid up and our waiter sent a young lad to clear our table despite the fact we hadn’t finished our drinks. I politely sent the lad away but the waiter sent him straight back. Not great. Considering the choices to dine in Singapore we felt proper ‘ripped off’ and an opportunity to dine elsewhere, lost. I’d hate to let others fall into the same trap."
"Great Food, Poor Service","Had dinner here tonight, the koobideh, chicken and rice were all fantastic, moist, tasty and just like you would have in Iran. A few dissapointments though:

- service was poor, I had to continue trying to get the waiters attention when I wanted to order or pay my bill.

- red wine was served chilled, odd. This should be mentioned when ordering. I don't expect red wine chilled.

- the Faloudeh was terrible. For a fine dining Persian restaurant I expect the chef to make their own Faloudeh noodles instead of using store bought vermicelli. Using vermicilli results in the noodles going dry in the throat and I had to drink water just to pass it down. Real Faloudeh noodles melt in the mouth.

Overall if they can improve on the points above they will be a place of happily keep returning to."
Lovely tasting food,"Staff here were very polite and accommodating, we enjoyed share plates of dips and meat. Was a great meal, slightly pricy but very nice."
Hit and miss,"The food was a hit and miss (kebabs were a bit dry and the Muhamara was a tad too tangy but the hummus hit the spot). The mains are definitely overpriced. Service was ok and the decor is quite nice. Overall, I wasn't too impressed during my first visit. However, I do see a lot of positive reviews about the place and so maybe it is worth another visit."
1st time,This was our first Persian meal and it was wonderful not cheap but well worth it. Drinks quite expensive but you don’t go there to drink the food is excellent and service very good
Shabestan,"Awesome! Very delicious and tasty food. Since we like that cuisine for us the food was outstanding. The ambience is also very good with the outside sitting. Prices for this kind of establishments in Singapore are normal, maybe the wine prices are a bit on the high side. Overall great evening and delicious food. Already been there 3 times and more to come."
Nice location for some Persian food,"Along the bank of the Singapore river, with outside tables. The mixed starters platter to share was delicious, with lovely hot Persian flatbread; our main course choices were not quite as good, but that might have been our selection, as the meat dish was not as tender as we might have liked. Not a cheap venue, but not extortionately priced either."
Great customer service and foooood!,People there were friendly and caring! The food was good and their drinks were goood too! Will recommend to people who looking for good ambience and Arabic food in the Clarke quay area!
