Cold Beers,We stoppedin on New Year Day for cold beers. Good service. Clean. Food looked delicious...give it a try. It's close to the Maxwell mrt station
"Local, quirky and great food","Great food and ambience, expensive drinks but we guessed thats due to the location in Singapore more than anything else (3x the price for the same beer v at another restaurant earlier in the day)… so the alcohol cost is the only reason for a 4/5 v a perfect 5 score. Loved our meal and the evening at this neat neighbourhood restaurant, would recommend."
pleasant experience at XYT,"had a birthday celebration at xiao ya tou - the food was good. we ordered the lobster kueh pie tee, crab omelette, truffle roast duck, spinach soup and hokkien mee and everything was cooked to perfection and was sooooo fresh. the best part was the service. the staffs were so nice and patient and provided really good service. 10/10 recommend and would definitely go back to try their other dishes."
"Overpriced, decent food, skip the drinks","Chinese Mod Fusion along Duxton Hill. More bar like (with overpriced beverages such as $10 Thai Milk Tea) but food is pretty decent and interesting.

Generally old-school decor, nostalgic posters on the walls, 90s music in the background, 80s crockery.

Food in descending order of preference:
- Lobster Kueh Pie Tue (must order)
- Hokkien Mee (atas version with scallops, most importantly got wok hei)
- Brussel Sprouts (caramelised with smoked pancetta, bacon makes everything yums)
- Otah Rolls (spring rolls filled with otah, crispy without being oily)
- Truffle Roast Duck (nicely roasted and tender, truffle part abit extra, think it would have been nicer without the truffle)
- Deep Fried Hakka Chicken Wings
- Kurobuta Char Siew (too charred & caramelised until bitter)
- Xiao Ya Tou Pork Dumplings (not awful but not wow. Just like any other 红油抄手 you can get out there at less than half the price)
- Cocktail Unrequited Love (truly unrequited, just can't love this)

Probably still worth returning for some of the food but not the drinks."
Cannot justify the price,"Food is decent but I can’t justify $32 for a Hokkien mee. The portions aren’t that big too, $32 Hokkien mee probably for one person of you share it with another pricey dish. It’s nice that it’s dog friendly for outdoors seating"
Gem of Place in Singapore,"We’ve been here a couple of times and both times, the food and service has been phenomenal!
Some of the best Asian food in town (a bold statement I genuinely stand by).
There’s good vegetarian options including the Tofu Puffs which were insanely good and the locally inspired drinks are delicious too! Particularly love the Sour Plum and Calamansi drink.
The restaurant has a nostalgic feel with scattered memorabilia that is likely to remind you of your childhood and it has a real warm vibe.
Will definitely be returning!"
Xiao Ya Tou,Food is ok but way too expensive for the quality. Service was good but doesn’t justify the price. Will probably not go there again
Old school retro local restaurant,"Not old enough to know how Singapore’s 60s, 70s look like. But the decor in this restaurant is probably quite close to the representation of that era. Very quirky and very retro. The menu is also a homage to most local cuisines but with an added twist. Imagine hokkien mee with scallops and beef hor fun that is cooked with wagyu beef."
Perfect night with friends,"Firstly the staff are amazing, super friendly, super helpful, and just lots of fun. The food was incredible especially the brussel sprouts. To top it all off the bill was very reasonable. A brilliant evening and I will be back, I want to take all my friends!!!"
"Awesome food, wonderful service!","The ambience was nice and the food was great! But what made the meal so enjoyable was the great service rendered by the service team. All of them were welcoming and attentive! My friend broke a glass and cut her finger. The service team promptly stepped forward to clear the table, helped us with cleaning the wound, and replaced the cocktail without charges. We are really impressed!"
Hands down our best meal in Singapore,"We absolutely loved this restaurant. Quirky interior, great vibe, wonderful staff, but most importantly the food was incredible. We particularly liked the truffle duck fried rice. Special shout out to our amazing waitress nee ping (so sorry if that's spelt wrong). Would have come back for dinner if it hadn't been our last night! Also worth checking out their sister venue, a cafe called Symmetry near Kampong Glam."
Down-to-earth choice in Duxton area,This place has eclectic old-school decorations with old toys which makes it a treat visually. The food is also good (though some might think it's overpriced Singaporean food) and the staff were friendly and able to make great recommendations (e.g. the Hokkien Mee) and advise on portions.
Kitschy cheeky,"Xiao Ya Tou, Duxton Hill: Kitschy cheeky Xiao Ya Tou will send you into a nostalgic spin when you are seated. There’s an overwhelming lot to take in - it’s a kitsch museum blast of the past, of all things homage to the Singapore’s yester years. I absolutely adore how kick back it is and the tongue in cheek humour starting with the quirky drinks. Opium is whisky oddly infused with plum juice. It’s definitely a strong acquired taste as is the real opium I reckon. There’s also a female torso cocktail cheekily topped by 3 2 massive lychees. We will back for more humour! #eatstylishtravelstylish"
Yummy Tze char in an unique ultra retro setting,"We were most impressed by the decor and the vibes (emanating from the tables and walls including ceiling) - probably the most retro local Chinese ambience for a restaurant pub in Singapore! Well done!!

The menu is only one page; it’s as colourful as the decor. We had braised baby spinach soup, the only soup offering. It’s good enough for three or four people. The wagyu beef hor fun was packed with wok hei - it actually tastes very much like a good char Kway teow with pork lard even! Lobster Kway pie tee was unusual but an excellent appettizer. Pork jowls was excessively colourful and it was nothing that we have tasted before.

I intend to come back with my mum!!"
"Great food, nice decorations","Nice food and atmosphere. Customer service can be slightly improved. We like to order few dishes at the start, try the food first only continue to place second round of food order."
Local Flavours with a tasty twist,"Wagyu Hor fun, Hokkien Mee, Lobster Kueh Pie Tee are among my many favourites here. Nothing disappoints, everything surprises the tastebuds. Go in a group and try more dishes. Best of all, you get to slurp it up in a really retro and hip decor. Great for casual dates and first meets."
Nice place to hangout with friends. And it's pet friendly,The staff are super friendly and helpful. Food is not bad. And it's pet friendly. Will recommend it to people who wanna bring their fur kids out for dining
Quirky interiors with awesome food,"Food is pretty decent although a bit pricey but definitely worth trying. Will be back to try out the rest of the dishes. Crispy otah is decent, Hokkien mee is fantastic and a must have, truffle duck has good truffle taste."
Too much truffle oil!,"Was ok. I liked the style of the food but everything was just abit off. Truffle duck sauce was way too strong and tasted like medicine in an offputting way, the crispy otah i couldnt really taste the otah, luroufan was nice but didnt really taste like luroufan and the rice was long grain instead of short....more of a beefstew rice really. I tried the opium cocktail which was a good idea but they put way too much sour plum inside that once it dissolved into the drink it got even stronger and eventually undrinkable. Overall its a place id like to go again as i like the concept but the calibration of flavors just didnt quite work for me."
"Good food, good atmosphere and nice decor","The restaurant was less quirky than I expected, the decor that adorns the walls and the room was carefully curated and will make the day of traditional chinese culture admirers, Japanese pop culture buffs and South East Asian oriented esthetes. As for the food, it holds the promises of the menu: it is well executed, genuine, beautifully served, scrumptious, and - since it seems like a major criterion to many here.. - quite affordable. Xiao Ya Tou is an Asian gem in the heritage gem that is Duxton hill, so people of good taste: you should go."
Lunch,"As usual, excellent food and prompt service. The spicy brussels were amazing. The lamb rib was so tender"
Tasty food and friendly service!,"My husband and I had an early dinner here a couple of weeks ago, and it was a great experience. The atmosphere and decor of the restaurant is interesting, quite casual and eclectic, with a fun and relaxed vibe. The staff were quite busy, there didn't seem to be enough of them for the number of diners, but they did an excellent job nonetheless. The older gentleman who checked us in and seated us, and also brought a couple of our dishes, was friendly with a good sense of humour, and the young woman who was our primary server was fantastic. Even though she was running around the whole night, she was still attentive, efficient and incredibly warm and funny. We appreciated the extra steps she took when we were ordering to give us more details on the dishes, checking if we were okay with spicy food or fatty meat or lots of carbs. We were very impressed with her initiative and attention to our needs and preference. Really great customer service!

And because of her helpful information and suggestions, we ended up with a fantastic meal! The pork rendang was rich and flavourful, and the lamb ribs were rich, fatty and so tender, crusted with a delicious spice blend that added both texture and flavour. My two favourite dishes were the XYT pork dumplings, which were generously sized, packed full of pork and served with a delicious vinegar and chili oil sauce, as well as the truffle duck fried rice, which had generous amounts of both the tender, moist duck and sweet Chinese sausage, a comforting and hearty dish. Even the glutinous rice balls with peanuts and black sesame ice cream were delicious; we only ordered one to share and were fighting over who got the extra piece, they were that good!

XYT has some truly creative and tasty food, and combined with their excellent service, is a place we'll return to. They also do takeaway and delivery until things reopen, worth an order for sure!"
"good food but pricey, overall, not sure if it was worth the price tag","nice unique dishes, but for the portions and the price tag, i am not sure if it was worth the price. service was wonderful though. the service staff was very very attentive."
Their prices doesn’t justify,"Heard it was good so we went to try.
But $30 for a normal HokkienMee with just 2 scallop ? and its not even the premium kind.

Truffle pekking duck was nothing special as well. You can get better ones elsewhere.
Pork rendang was a unique dish and the best out of the 3, but its not worth $30 either because the portion is just too small.

they have some unique Cocktails selections but unfortunately i didnt try any.

overall, i regret spending $100+ for something so mediocre and overpriced. Will not visit again."
Beg for More!,Delicious Asian cuisine with a twist served with great service! Will be back for more... already dined there twice within 3 days! The lobster pie tee & crab fried rice is soooo good!
"Good food, even better service plus happening vibes!","First time at this restaurant - with 2 girlfrens. The food was yummilicious, the service was simply impeccable. The service crew who attended to us - just one of the best we have ever come across. Hands down. Thank you for being you!"
Experience at Xiao Ya Tou,"Nice ambience and retro looking restaurant. Wasn't too hard to locate. The food was nice but the price was on the higher side considering the type of food they are serving. We ordered mala fish that consist of fish slices (those used for fish soup beehoon), fungus mushroom and lotus roots as well as a seafood hokkien mee and a bowl of white rice it amounts to $67."
Flavour and whimsicality,"XYT did not disappoint. Each dish that came out drew compliments from me and my guests. The flower clams took the show, with superbly infused liquor in it's gravy that made us spread it generously over white rice. The decor brought us back to old Singapore wistfully, though it came together with the lack of space. Not a big complaint thought. That said, we thought the drink portions could be more generous :)"
Retro vibes and good Asian food !,"Xiao ya tou offers Asian fare with a twist with retro-inspired theme . The food was better than expected. Fried Rice with truffle duck was really good, also the lobster Kueh pie tee.
The sago pudding was exceptional ‘. The retro theme was present in the plating and presentation of the food.kudos to the team.
Service was friendly too !

Great for a fun retro night out with friends or an ‘educational’ lunch with the young ones :)"
Excellent Meal and evening,"Excellent food, but always packed. Some must haves include Lobster Kueh Pie Tee, Truffle Duck, and Wagyu Hor Fun!"
On the pricy edge,"Ambience was good and interior design sets you back to a vibe of 80s Singapore. Hence the food on the other side wasn't up to standard- ordered Mala Fish and the fish was overcooked (when bite on, wasn't soft but rather hard). No price tag on cocktails so please becareful when you order your drinks, remember to ask the price. Price paid worth it for the food?- no. With the amount paid, if the food was good and well cooked to standard, we absolutely have no problem for that. Service was good though."
Great experience,Brought a couple friends to the place as I really enjoyed this restaurant. Food is good and love their cocktails
Small but good food,"Food portion was small though good. 7 dishes for 3 adults and 2 kids. Disappointed with service. Was told we had to leave at 8.15pm which was ok. But 7.35pm, we were told next guests arriving and we should leave soon. We had not even finish food and wine. There were empty tables (not empty due to social distancing). Unhappy that we were hastened to leave despite spending $300."
Excellent fusion food,Menu featured items not found anywhere else and the tastes were excellent. Service was prompt with a very rustic dining environment. Will be back again!
Great place to dine!,"Friendly staffs and amazing food! The baby spinach soup looks underwhelming but packed with flavours from the wok & fhe broth. The dumplings was okay, chili oil was fragrant but doesn't really provide any heat. Though the fillings in the dumpling are really packed & Flavourful. Price wise it was worth it for the quality & effort that was put into the dishes."
Great food and eminence,Really tasty Asian style food. Not pretentious. The temperature in the restaurant could be colder as it was too sweaty for us. Definitely will go back and highly recommended
Interesting food,"Interesting and by and large cooked quite well
The short ribs lovely
The pie tee a little odd
The dumplings nothing special
The chili crab lookalike was ok but the sauce was way too tomato flavoured
The duck and the duck fried rice were too heavily flavoured with truffle oil
Service was ok"
Greatness,"Excellent food, friendly service and great atmospehre. recommend To taste their aubergine, it was heavenly"
Best!,"Amazing food, one of the best in Singapore! Every dish was perfectly cooked and presented. An absolute delight!!"
Definitely a recommendation,"Walked in this super fun decorated restaurant. While looking at the menu, the owner (?) offered his help with our choice. Even though I do not like brussels sprouts, these were the best ever and I would order them again. Food was excellent, fresh, well prepared and nicely presented. Main course with fish was for us just on the edge of too spicy, but I am pretty that can be changed upon request. Long story short, definitely a recommendation."
Not as good as thought,"Not as good as the rating says , Food is so so, not match it’s value Won’t visit again. Place were quite empty."
Over priced food,We were quite disappointed with the food quality at those prices. $30 for the mala fish dish which I find it tasted weird.
Great food & staff,"Food is great and options are diverse. Would highly recommend ordering the Dumplings, Wagyu Beef and Brussels sprouts. And the staff is super friendly and professional"
Food not worth the price,Food are pricey but tasted just like any other normal standard food. Restaurant’s ambience is retro and quirky. Wouldn’t be revisiting.
Excellent food and service,"Authentic great tasting food served as it comes and in sharing dishes , 80s music and fantastic service - a great tasting good night out!"
Amazing,Amazing food and excellent service. Atmosphere was also great. Will definitely visit again soon! Thanks
great local flavours,I thought it was a very good mix of flavours and in the more quiet part of the neighbourhood. Should try the cereal chicken and the otak roll. then had the seafood mee sua and chrysanthemum trifle as dessert. Was there for lunch so no wine ordered. They do have a selection to choose. Will return!
Always love the foods at Xiao Ya Tou,"This my second visit to Xiao Ya Tou this time for lunch as usual ordered the XYT Hokkien Mee is the best and Ngon Hiang, Kueh Pie Tee is different from the normal Nonya Kueh Pie Tee a must order when come to XYT final dessert Coconut Tau Huay this reminds me of steamed milk egg pudding and Iced Chendol it would be good if the ice crushes more fine. Overall still love the foods at XYT"
Superb! Go!,Great restaurant serving tasty interpretations of singapore classics. A really nice find in Duxton Hill.
Great Local food,Great dinner. Food was excellent!will be back again! Service from staff was friendly and local! Love the deco as well
Great food & atmosphere,We keep coming back with friends for the classics with a twist and the hong kong beers in this laid back cool setting
Not worth it,"For $80/person without alcohol, there’s plenty of other restaurants to choose from. Main feedback would be a clear mismatch between food quality and pricing. The modern iteration of traditional Chinese dishes were not well harmonized in taste nor presentation. There was a high expectation going in, so we felt more let down with each dish that came to our table. I struggled to finish the meal, as I lost my appetite half way thru."
Quirky restaurant on Duxton Hill to provide nostalgia although food prices are up to date.,"Quirky restaurant on Duxton Hill Square which is decorated with old phones, neon signs and old posters to take you back in time to the eighties - I presume eighties as the music was from that era. It was busy and the menu was one sheet of local food - quite pricey. Omelette was over oiled and some of the starters perhaps not as hot as they could have been. Service was friendly although could be a little tardy. Wine was good though prices were quite high for what we were getting. The meal seemed over quickly so not much of an experience. My wife and I left hungry and so went next door for a souffle."
Local cuisine elevated,"Cuisine at XYT leans towards local food but elevated. We tried the National Day set menu, consisting of 2 appetizers, 2 mains and a dessert. For the appetizers we had the cereal chicken and the chilli crab pie tee. The chilli crab pie tee was a good reinvention of the traditional pie tee utilising soft shell crab and the texture crunch from the pie tee shell, the cereal chicken was less impressive leaning towards a sweeter rendition and the cereal flakes were not crispy as well. For mains we moved on to the chicken masak merah and the seafood mee rubus. I wished that the masak merah had a stronger hit of chilli though as it was leaning towards the sweeter side but kudos on the chicken being kept moist and juicy. The seafood mee rubus had the subtle spiciness that kept making one go for bite after bite and was chokeful of seafood ingredients. Ended the meal with longan jelly which was nothing much to shout about but a sweet ending, although the ice used could be less rough and chunky. Overall worth the value for the set lunch."
Interesting dishes,"Food is interesting as it gives you a taste of Singapore local flavours with a modern twist. So you end up having roast duck with truffle oil, or Hokkien mee with squid (instead of sotong) and scallops, etc. Personally, I prefer hawker food as I have a preference for something more traditional and familiar. But this place is great for the experience although the food is rather expensive. Expect to spend about $60 per head for dishes like Hokkien mee and a couple others."
Loved this quirky restaurant,"We stumbled across this restaurant and loved it. Very quirky in decor, fab service and absolutely delicious food, especially the spicy sprouts. Highly recommend."
Very tasty but not so cheap,"Had a very delicious meal of duck, broccolini and rice with a glass of wine. The specialty duck was very tasty and the charred broccolini very flavourful. Atmosphere is very retro and service was excellent. For a solo meal almost S$80 seemed more expensive than I had anticipated from other reviews."
Yummy!,Food was so good although a bit expensive. But definitely worth trying! Highly recommended if you have friends visiting Singapore for the first time.
A twist to the familiar dishes - spicy sprouts - best!,"Very retro-looking, basic and comfortable restaurant. The dishes seem ordinary but they were really fantastic! Otak rolls with peanut sauce were crispy and tasty. The pork rendang were yummy, really tender and rich. Angus short-ribs were soft and flavourful. Truffle roast duck - equally al dente, and truffle note was not too overpowering. Loved the spicy sprouts - wow! the spices and combination of various textures (mince, chye po) were brilliant! Lu Rou Fan was exorbitant but well, it was wagyu (yum!). The service was phenomenal, just on the steep side."
Best Hokkien Mee!,Hokkien Prawn Mee is the best I have had at a restaurant. Perfectly cooked in the wok with the flavour and right heat! Amazingly yummy?
Great Experience,"It is wonderful to go to a restaurant that exceeds ones expectations. Xiao Ya Tou has character and charm with friendly staff who think about what they are doing. Above all the food is very good. The crispy otak otak were wonderful. I particularly liked the way they made brussel sprouts tasty and fun to eat. The lamb was tasty as was the dried beef hor fan.

My wife and I are looking forward to going again and tasting more of the menu. We have already invited friends to join us."
Quirky and fun,Came in here for dinner as we were staying just down the road. Staff are really friendly and happy to recommend dishes. The menu is a bit eclectic and has a limited selection but I think that’s part of the charm. If you’re a fussy eater this may not be the place for you! Our food was excellent and the vibe of the place is great too.
Great Asian Fusion Experience,"Six of us had a fabulous dinner at this cozy unpretentious restaurant in Duxton Hill.
The Piety appetiser, with crispy skin and prawn salad , started the night rolling. The bbq prawns sprinkled with crab roe not only were unique in presentation but also tasted deliciously. The pork rib and duck were just right and went beautifully with a cold beer.
The highlight of the night was the heavenly fried seafood noodle with its rich yet delicate seafood.

The Singapore owner who has studied culinary skills in Australia definitely has blended Asian food well with western presentation, yet retaining their Asian authenticity!

Definitely a great fusion experience worth revisits!"
Nice cosy restaurant with great flavours,"Xiao Ya Tou has consistently produced good quality and innovative dishes on the 3 different occasions Ive been there. Its certainly the place to go if you're looking for something out of the norm and with a twist, this restaurant wont disappoint you. =)"
Funky Brunch Place,A funky deco place with lots of character. Something different from the usual brunch place. Does not serve the best coffee but the food are yummy.
Creative fusion,"Unable to try it’s extensive fusion menu since there were only 2 of us. Had the soft shell crab Mee Goreng, Wagyu bowl. Both were good but nothing worth shouting for.
Service staff were friendly and fast. Four stars for the ambience and interesting menu selection. Some food were a little pricey in my opinion but worth a try."
"Great Asian fusion, but high prices...","If you like to explore Asian cuisine, this is the place you should try! The menu is simple, but really good. The prices for the food seem reasonable for the portion sizes. However, I got a Lime Juice, and for one glass it came to around $10. Ummm... What?! (It was lime with sparkling water.) Despite the fact that cocktails are $15, coffee ranges from $4-$7, and the Chilli Crab Noodles were $18. The delicious food is the only thing that keeps the rating from falling."
An unassuming place but food was good! Service was every better!,"Overall environment of the place was pleasant. Impressed by the service level honestly, although they were very busy. However, was a little disappointed with the range of wine offered. There was only 2 to choose from... not much of a choice though."
Delicious food and great service,We had an amazing evening together with our friends and enjoyed the absolutely fantastic food and service. Thank you very much
Interesting place but slightly overpriced,"Love the service and fusion-created dishes. The theme of the decor is so on-point, great to experience a little chinese culture there. Just that some dishes are slightly overpriced."
Quirky & Fabulous,"Set in the stunning Duxton Hill precinct, Xisi Ya Tou is a quirky and special spot.

This special but slightly hidden part of Singapore’s Chinatown is Chinese retro meets pop culture.

You could probably spend hours just discovering all of the little bits n pieces on the walls and ceiling. The disco soundtrack was somehow enjoyable, fun & appropriate.

When it come to the food, all restaurant food should be this good!

South East Asian fusion may begin to describe the style, the quality however is simply stunning.

We had s slight hiccup with our booking but that was promptly sorted and handled with extreme professionalism.

Do yourself a favour and try XYT when you are in Singapore.

We look forward to returning."
Best Asian food in singapore,An authentic quirky local restaurant in the heart of singapore. Delicious food and friendly service. Great western popular music too.
One of my Singapore favourites,"Amazing food with local twist. I discovered it some time ago, when out with a group. Now I quietly sneak over on my own.. so that no one can comment on my ordering my third bowl of dumplings!! Both staff and vibe excellent. It’s a fun place to be."
Excellent cool brunch place for a spin of the with a fusion touch,"Great food, fantastic atmosphere, come back anytime. Loved the unagi eggs benedic and the crispy otak oak"
Extremely wonderful experience,"The moment you step into this restaurant, the ambience brings you on a trip down memory lane back into the early days of Singapore. The food was amazing too!!! We had the authentic hokkien mee with generous ingredients, ngoh hiang with tasty dipping sauce, super roasty chicken with very chicken-ricey chilli sauce, and well deep-fried hakka meat. The drinks were all very deliciously concocted as well. The dessert was also a pleasant surprise, the tau huay was super soft and accented with a coconut taste. The wait staff were all attentive. I had earlier alerted them that my friend's birthday was in October and they served up a surprise birthday pancake that was very sweetly decorated for her, candles and all. My friend was truly surprised and happy. My party and I had a wonderful experience and we highly recommend XYT!"
Pricey Lunch for team bonding,Food taste is fine but the portion of each type of food are small to share around ie soy sauce chicken doesn't have half a chicken in a plate of $19 or the ngoh hiang is around 8 small pieces per plate of $15 etc. The 3 types of dessert is $8-9 per small plate of 2 piece each. Drinks is quite costly too.
"Pricey local food, but gd atmosphere","Can tell the proprietors took the effort to source and display vintage items. Food is of local fare and pricey. But all in all, with the gd service and food quality, it still warrants a try."
"Great atmosphere, even better food","Even though the food and the cocktails are on the pricier side, it is definitely worth it! Ordered 3 small plates and 2 desserts among 2 of us, and it was just nice. The char siew was very tender, and had big portions. The dumplings were drenched in chili oil, and was so good. The seafood tofu was amazing as well. My favourite dessert was their take on tau huey, as it went really well together. My friend really loved the other dessert - kaya toast. We also loved their cocktails, especially the milo dinosaur. Would recommend!"
Good food and ambiance,"Very good food with friendly environment. Asian food is amazing with choises of Chines, Japanese and Singaporean !!"
Tip top service with decent food,"Most of us have grown to accept that service in restaurants is no longer an expectation. So I was extremely surprised by the level of service of the service staff up to the point they made sure we got into the taxis ordered on behalf. Food is quite good but for the service and the place, I will be back."
Great food great service great ambience,Loved this place max!! Nostalgic and wonderfully attentive service from the team. Food choices filled with the uniqueness and great taste !!
"heritage, unique & great effort","this is 1 place i see i can bring the kids, my parent, my friends together. kids will love the food so are we. drinks for the youngsters, the old and the alcoholist all in 1 place. i would say this is a place of comfort, back in time and i simply love the effort put in with the decoration and ornaments from the past. food is unique n great. simply love it. drinks range are good. not over priced. i love the drink menu. food menu also not complicated but delivered with perfection."
Charming,"The food here was good, but it’s the charming service and nice ambience that makes eating here great. We recommend the broccolini and dumplings."
"Borrow wine, erase worry!","I had the char grilled eel and low temp. egg burger as well as the ‘homemade radish cake’. Who new radishes could be so good? The dishes were totally delicious. So good, I’d love to go back and sample every item on the menu.

A casual, inventive Asian eatery that serves good wine and sparkling too. The excellent friendly service elevates this great brunch spot to standout!

#singaporebrunch"
It was okay,"Ambience was great with the vintage decor, however food-wise, it was mediocre. Menu offered was Asian fusion, mostly Singaporean dishes with their own twist. We had brunch there but was told by others that dinner should be better."
Always Interesting and Tasty Food!,"I have eaten at this restaurant a number of times. It is my go to place to take international guests who want to try some Asian food. The food is great to share, so you get to try lots of different things, and always very tasty. The service is fast and efficient and the staff are always helpful."
Overpriced local food made without love,"Overall, we have to say this was a disappointing dining experience...

We made a reservation as one of our friends had an amazing dinner two months back. We are aware of the relatively high pricing before coming but definitely not visiting again if the restaurant does not look into two aspects - foods quality and service attitude

My friend had raved about the beansprouts previously but it was definitely a letdown this time. It was not well marinated and after we offered the feedback, we could sense that it was not well received by the manager/boss.

Next, Hokkien mee was over cooked and the noodles was too soft that evening. Flavor was also not as fragrant as it was two months ago. Considering this is atas local food at exorbitant prices, we really expected more wow factor.

Truffle roasted duck was ok but there was absolutely no truffle flavor no matter how hard we dip the meat into the lacklustre sauce. We certainly did not think it fits the bill of being the signature dish of the restaurant, not sure where is the cushion element, we can easily go for a better braised duck at less than half the price.

Broccolini is certainly not a cheap vegetable, but the way it was chopped into small slices, it could have been better off if you change your menu to kailan instead. Nobody could tell the difference. Flavour was alright.

Fried otah was passable but I would rather go for hei bee hiang. The fried otah was just wrapping the usual muar otah in filo pastry, nothing fascinating.

We have no issues with the restaurant trying to upsell your drinks or food to chock up a bill of at least $50.00 per person as my friend had experienced in both visits, but the consistency needs to be there, and the restaurant cannot just rely on a few limited signature side dishes, like ngoh hiang and brusselsprouts.

Lastly, one of your female servers had serious lacking in her service standard as she serve our table without thank you, smiles or any pleasant traits that a server should have. We asked for bowls and she gave plates, which is slightly disappointing.

We are certainly reluctant to make a next visit or recommend to any of our friends or relatives, considering 2 out of 3 person had their first and last visit with this disappointment.

Update: The restaurant asked for feedback but totally ignored my lengthy feedback, probably thinking it didn't really matter to them."
Absolutely amazing,"Everything was perfect, though a little pricey for the quantity! The atmosphere was very chill and the staff very kind!"
"very creative dishes, a little pricey","decided to pop by after watching eatbook's video of their food, but was disappointed to find most of the featured dishes missing from their menu (taken off?). Anyway, bf tried their unagi benedicts and it was a miss for him, apparently the egg and the unagi just doesn't come together well. I had the hua juan and it was awesome! It was slightly sweet and crisp on the outside yet super soft and fluffy on the inside!
their cold brew coffee was a miss for me too. i'm a huge hater of sourish coffee and they just have to infuse the cold brew with orange. (or at least, add a slice of fresh orange inside). Really don't get it."
Xiao Ya Tou,The food and customer service are very good! The lu ruo fan is delicious and very filling! The pieces of beef meat are very tender! Just that the price of the food is a bit pricey!
Best food in Singapore,"I moved to Singapore 3 months ago and work in Duxton Hill where this restaurant is situated. I can honestly say that out of all the (many) places I have eaten, Xiao Ya Tou is hands down the best, tastiest, most creative and flavoursome food I have had yet in Singapore. Plus the owner is absolutely lovely. I recommend the wagyu beef bowl at lunch and the flower clams at dinner. All insanely good."
Xiao Ya Tou,Tasty creative local chinese dishes! Loved the kurobuta char siew and stir fried broccolini. Also ordered the flower clams which has a tad too much chinese wine but clams were pretty fresh.
Great hospitality!,The staffs are very friendly and responsive to request. I like how they are being very creative with their dishes! Do try out milo dinosaur cocktail if you have the chance to!
Not bad but expensive,"Unagi Benedicts was good, the rest of the items so so and portion smaller than I expected because the price is on the higher side. Different menu on weekday and weekend. Unagi Benedict only available during weekend brunch time."
Travel back in time...,Nostalgic! The whole place brings you back to the 1950s/60s Singapore. Definitely an interesting place to bring the little ones or tourists. We had Abacus (Suan Pan Zi) and Olive Fried Rice. Both were decent.
Atas local food with a twist,"I like how the decoration of the shop was so nostalgic and it is like a short getaway from the hustle and bustle of city life. The food was awesome, especially the XYT hokkien mee! Has a strong wok hei taste and super worth the calorie count."
Modern Chinese Food,"I liked this idea of a modern, ""zhng-ed"" hokkien mee but the portion was really small, which was disappointing given its price."
Go! You won't regret it.,"Recommended by a friend, who is a culinary teacher, we went with high expectations.
And they were met!

The food is freshly prepared, tasteful and consistently prepared. Meaning, we have gone many times and it's been very good every time.

The staff is very friendly and happy to accommodate any dietary requirements - where possible of course."
Best Asian Westen Fusion Restaurant,"Never thought I'd ever pay more than $10 for a plate of Hokkien Mee but I'm glad I did, cause it was the best HKM I've ever tasted!"
Delightful meal and nice retro ambience,"Had a delightful dinner at Xiao Ya Tou on a Sat night. Service was excellent and the dishes were served promptly. The rendition of lu rou fan used braised beef instead of pork which was an interesting change, and the meat was well marinated and soft. We loved the otak otak rolls and ngoh hiang too."
