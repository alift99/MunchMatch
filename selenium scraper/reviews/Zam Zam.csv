Poor Customer Service,"- the food was good but customer service was typically bad .
- i understand store is closing but still respecting customer it’s tip top . there was a staff that was rude and told us to order quickly as the store is closing down soon & it’s like literally 1020pm .
- we come to eat the food & pay for it but with this kind of service i guess it’s unacceptable.
- there were quite number of customer also unsatisfied with the customer service .
- i hope this could be fixed
- really dissapointed , zam zam has been my most fav go-to-eat restaurant to eat but now it’s just embarrassing to even come again atter witnessing this ."
Mutton Biryani and Murtabaks,"I visited Zam Zam twice during the Singapore trip this time. Just a couple of hours after arriving in Singapore I was already seated at the table poring through the menu. I settled on the mutton biryani (S$9).

The biryani was tasty even though after trying biryanis at different places during this trip I wouldn't say Zam Zam is the best but it still ranks highly on my personal preferences. 

The second visit was to order takeaway chicken and mutton murtabaks before flying out. It was a bit of a queue as weekend mornings are usually packed with hungry customers. The young chap who manned the cashier was friendly and apologetic for making me wait and helped me to check if I received the right number of murtabaks. That's what I call customer service."
No frills and hearty food,"A typical Indian Mulim place with no frills. Don't expect any ""service"". It's a place to get your Indian Muslim fix. Good and hearty mutton briyani. Reasonably priced."
Ok for a quick snack - Murtabak (Roti),"Very busy upstairs in dining area. We saw this from the ground floor while they were making Murtabak (roti like with egg and meat). So we wanted to try it out and elected to sit upstairs. It's like $6 for small but was large enough. We had one chicken and one beef and it was stuffed with meat. I didn't dare try the deer. Enjoyed this for a snack. Other dishes looked a bit small but affordable.

Come try this place out at reasonable prices."
Terrible staff and lousy attitude.,"Terrible staff and lousy attitude. Placed an order online to collect at 11am. Reached there and it was not ready. Just say I have to wait. Not able to tell me how long. When I ask more, they say 45 mins and ask me to cancel order. This order has been placed in advance. Next door restaurant has a much better attitude. Avoid at all cost!!!"
Horrendous food and service,"I wouldn’t have stepped in if not for an insistent colleague.
It turned out exactly as I have expected.
The deer meat murtabak was a major letdown, dry and tasteless.
The chicken briyani was equally bad, without any spiced fragrance.
The service was slow, insincere, and unhelpful."
Terrible staffs and rubbish food quality,"An honest review of a terrible dining experience by the staffs.

On 06/02/2021, my family and I came here for our dinner. We then told a staff, who was wearing a black tee, that it was a table for five, the staff then offered us the table downstairs, which we then sit. But that same staff then told us to move upstairs, which we agreed upon because of air con and as he said that we could still sit together as a family.

But what staff didn’t tell us was that we had to split us up into 3 and 2, despite initially telling us that there was 5 seats upstairs and us arriving as a family. We cooperated and when the 5 seats upstairs were available, we were rudely told off, by the staff upstairs, who has a tattoo on his left arm, to not be allowed to sit there as the staff wanted to cater to the next family.

We then informed that we’re here as a family first and had waited. And earlier, was told by the staff below that there was a table for us together, and we still had to sit seperately? In the midst of that, they way the staffs spoke, especially to my parents were very disrespectful and utterly unprofessional. When I spoke to the staff to feedback, I was instead challenged by that same staff to speak to the manager below myself.

In fact, when the next family came in, they were lead upstairs thinking that they could eat together but was told to seperate. That entire family left on the spot. Probably the same lie that the staffs informed my family earlier.

The food was also rubbish (Maggie goreng and chicken chop) were not cooked properly. This is on top of the terrible service, communication between staffs and rubbish quality overall.

Utterly gutted and will never come here again. Totally ruined the mood of us here as a family. Train your staffs to develop some ethics when speaking to customers and have better cooks.

Beyond any doubt, one of the most worst restaurant experience in my entire life. Utterly gutted with Zam Zam and what is used to be me as a consumer. Gutted, dissapointed and pissed with the treatment we received. Thanks so much for ruining my family’s mood.

Having dine with my family and to other restuarants plenty of time, this was undeniably and undoubtedly the worst, 1/5 for the staff service and food. An honest review of the experience we had provided by your own staffs."
Horrible Customer Service,"I have been dining at this restaurant since young.
But last night’s experience was worst. Customers having a hot drink after a full meal. However, an inconsiderate service crew was chasing diners repeatedly . They need to educate and groom their staff some basic manners.
Such behaviour only direct regular customers to other competing restaurants instead. Restaurant management kindly look into this matter. Tq."
Best Mutton Briyani,"Visited their restaurant for lunch and was ushered to the 2nd level.Seating was comfortable and staffs were efficient.

Hubby and I had a mutton briyani each.The rice was fragrant,fluffy and every bite was heavenly.It wasn't oily at all and each grain was coated with a hint of spices.I could just eat the rice by itself.Love, love, love it ❤

The mutton was tender,covered in one of the best tasting gravy I ever had.My taste buds were partying with joy and thanking me for the wonderful meal.

Excellent meal!!!If Briyani is something I can eat everyday,I will eat Zam Zam briyani. Try it,its worth the $7 and it is one of the best Briyani in Singapore"
Very bad insipid food,"Vegetarian meal was horrendous. Simply dry mee goreng & a veg Nasi goreng without proper vegetables. Restaurant recommends spl dum biriyani in pot. When the order arrived I was confounded by shock.just the curry and meat hidden in plain biriyani rice covered nicely with a silver foil.. Is the restaurant trying to hoodwink customers. I have eaten real Dum biriyani & I really know the composition.There may be a favourable crowd but to me this is not real food. Too much colouring added to food & the ventilation is extremely poor that when you are out of the restaurant, the pong of oil & food lingering to your clothes is extremely nauseating"
Great for the price but a few things missing.,"After coming here 2-3 years ago, I was in the area and craving some biryani. I must say not to much has changed besides some wallpaper and change of staff.

I was told to go upstairs as it was very busy, but no further guidance was given. I had to ask them to point to a table for 1 and was seated a large table in the far back corner. The table was eventually divided as some other hungry eaters came along.

I decide on some Chicken Biryani, willing to try it here.

After a little wait, I was given a plate with a spoon and fork but no knife or napkin / Serviette. The guests next to me were given plenty of napkins so later on I had to ask for a few.

Not too much later I get served my Chicken Biryani and soon after cams my papa dams.

The rice tasted well cooked and so was the chicken. I felt encouraged to eat the chicken with my fingers as I saw others doing so.

Overall I would say the food is good and well cooked but I came at a somewhat busy time.

My total was $9.00 exact, $1.50 for a canned drink, $6.50 for the Biryani and an extra $1 for the papadams.

Hope this review was helpful, I hope to back in future ."
I LOVE THEIR MURTABAK,I flew from KL just to enjoy their murtabak. Their air katira is also a must try when u go to this restaurant. Their milo dinasour is very generous and their fried rice is so delicious!!
Good biryani,"Ordered the mutton and chicken biryani. Price is reasonable. Mutton was soft and came off the bone easily. Biryani was not oily and with the 2 curry that came with it, it was tasty and filling. Chicken was a bit dry but thankfully the curry saved it.p"
Very Good Indian Muslim Cuisine-one of the best in Singapore,"Very busy always, tasty, cheap dishes-very authentic tastes and give you the feeling that they are homemade. Must visit Zam Zam after a visit to Arab Street and the Masjid Sultan mosque."
Murtabak addiction,Have been here off and on from Aussie over 30 years now. Its the taste of the spicy curry dipping sauce and murtabak that gets to you. I have tried to find similar in Aussie to no avail. It has to be Zam Zam.
The best Dahl,Dahl and roti for breakfast here was really tasty. We didnt try anything else other than chicken curry which was also good but
will visit again,"decent murtabak and basmati rice, reasonable price, promptly service.i will come back again with generous giving of curry. The only thing is the fish in the basmati is red hot spicy."
Famous murtabak,"Famous murtabak - apparently the sultan of some place came here to eat several times. Either way, it's really good. I came here as a group so we could share the medium murtabak and other sides."
Wonderful Indian cuisine at affordable prices,Great tasting food. Best part is that the price is affordable. But not the nicest in terms of decor and cleanliness.
Great food at a great price,The Murtabak here are so good. 1 beef and 1 chicken murtabak for lunch. Quick service with a smile in air conditioned room at great value. Highly recommend a visit.
Murtabak for dinner,"They were famous for their murtabak, It was the first time I had murtabak so I was not sure if I like it or not. I asked for less spicy sauce so the sauce was tasty for me. They brought out a huge murtabak which I thought that it was for 2 people, not just for 1 tiny person like me. There was no way I can finish the whole dish. I had chicken murtabak, chicken was not dry, it was juicy which was really good, the egg part made it creamy but it made me feel full really fast. Staff were nice. Floor was kind of slippery. The restaurant was always full of customers"
Affordable and very tasty.,Affordable and very tasty. Open late. The murtabak is filling and served with different fillings and in different sizes.
Wonderful Murtabak!,"We had a great breakfast here. Coffee and beef murtabak. Right off Arab Street and worth a stop. Great food, good service and great value. After the meal we roamed the shops in the area."
Quite disappointing!!,"In the Far East for over 3 weeks now enjoying Thai, Cambodian and Chinese cuisine.
Had a yearning for Indian food , particularly biryani.
This place recommended to us by a local Singaporean person
Checked out great reviews from Trip Advisor and the family decided to dine here last night before heading home
Bland and poorly spiced biryani served cold with tough flavorless chicken is what we got. While we weren’t expecting a Lucknow or Hyderabadi biryani— this rendition was appallingly bad. The kingfish curry was quite acceptable.
The Roti murtaba was equally bland . Service was attentive and appreciated
Nonplused by the many positive reviews on Trip Advisor
This thing they serve is not even remotely similar to the original version. The biryani we get at our local Indian restaurant in the US is way better
So sorry to be so critical —but this place leaves us going home on a”downer” after a great Asian visit"
Bad service experien,everytime i come..the cashier say bad thing...it's really not respect the customer bad....bad...bad service
We had late lunch here,We tried chicken beritani and famous murtabak. It were nice. recommended to try. Fast services although it was crowded at that time. Friendly staff.
Still the place to go for,"Still the place to go for a murtabk in Singapore, they’re been here for decades so must be doing it right. Don’t look too closely at the cleanliness but everyone seems to survive. One of my favourite places to eat and easy to reach."
Zam zam,"Zam zam is one of the most famous place for din briyani in Singapore. With that, it’s extreme let crowded with tour groups dropping by to try it out. The store is the same as it was 20 years ago and we sat at a table next to the kitchen. I question their hygiene standards from what I saw.

Nevertheless, their dum briyani that cost $8 was yummy but I won’t say the best."
Authentic Food at reasonable prices,"Restaurant was recommended by a friend, couldn't thank him enough. The food tasted very authentic, the portion size was good, service was fast and last but not least the tea was perfect!"
Very good food!,"Stumbled past this place and couldn’t help but stop by owing to how busy this place was. Good atmosphere inside and very good food to match. The biriyani was excellent, as was the Murtabak. Would definitely recommend!"
Awesome,"Great food, the murtabak is authentic and as good as it gets! Highly recommended. Lots of seating available. Beware...their aircon turns off at 11pm!"
Authentic & Flavoursome,"A well known and famous Indian/Muslim restaurant that offers its signature Biryani's and Murtabak's which are very good, reasonably priced at around $7 and generous portions.Great for both a quick bite to eat or for Dinner. Rated very highly and rightly so. The restaurant is adjacent to the mosque so cannot be missed. A short walk east from Bugis MRT. A must try if in Singapore."
Late Night Take Away!,"Zam Zam was around the corner from our hotel. One evening, after a late return from the zoo, we stopped in. They were near closing, but would do take out.
The food was wonderful, affordably priced, and the staff were very friendly. They do have an upstairs dining area that is air conditioned, if you are eating in.
Highly recommended!!"
Amazing!,I came back after first visit in Singapore in 2014 when the tour guide took us there. Really delicious and authentic and cheap as for the city. Defiantly will go back on my next trip.
"Open early , murtabah out of this world","Fast , tasty , cheap . This is typical fast food in singapore ... long history and incredible food. I travel to singapore regularily and it is slowly losing its soul , zam zam has stayed true to itself ... can not go wrong ."
Oldest restaurant in Singapore,"Established in 1908, but just average food and service. Air conditioning on second floor. Just average"
Great feel of local atmosphere.,Brought here by friend from Singapore. Great buzz to the place especially around lunch time. Really popular with locals from nearby offices. Packed to the rafferters. Lucky to get a table. Wonderful spot great service and good quality food. Very reasonably priced and in a great location in the city. Plenty to do and see here. Highly recommended.
Great place for a quick meal,"We stopped by for lunch as we had heard the murtabak supposedly was among the best in Singapore. It was indeed delicious. The staff were friendly and food arrived quickly. Maybe the place doesn't have the best ambiance, but it's good for a quick, delicious and filling meal. Great location too, lots of sightseeing to be done in the area."
Best Bryani EVER,"I have known this place since i was a teenager studying in a school nearby. Even now, living overseas, when I come back to Singapore this is the place I would definitely visit everytime i visit Singapore.
Great bryani and all the dishes are great...friendly staff.
You would never go wrong coming here to eat."
Excellent murtabak,Go here and try the murtabak. Just order the large size because you are going to snack it all up. Great simple dish. Had the chicken version and when in Singapore again I will go and try the other versions.
Best Briyani in Singapore,"In my humble opinion, after ordering Chicken Bryani (local spelling) at numerous eateries around Singapore, Zam Zam really is the best. Recommend upstairs in the comfort of air conditioning which also serves up murtabak, delicious fish and several other dishes. There is a great range of non-alcoholic drinks displayed clearly on the wall in colour to choose from.
Disregard other reviewers comments about service as this is on par with a lot of Singaporean venues, outside of the 5 star hotels that some believe to be the norm. These people should just get over themselves and just enjoy the relatively cheap and highly enjoyable local cuisine that Zam Zam offers."
Very good curry and friendly service,Stopped in for a quick meal recently and was not disappointed. Had curried veggies and fish curry. Both very tasty. Huge range of options. Incredibly cheap. Very friendly staff. Easy to find across from the mosque. Worth it if you love curry.
Best Murtabak,Best Murtabak in the country. We tried the chicken and plain. it was amazing with the gravy or by itself.
A must stop in S'pore,"Everytime we stopped by S'pore, my family and I will make sure that we will squeeze in 30-40 min our time to stop by the restaurant. It is situated just across the road from the famous Sultan Mosque and can easily accessed by taxi, grab or public transportation. You can order anything you can't go wrong. I would recommend to at least order their Briyani (muttons or beef) and their Murtabak and companied by Teh Tarik!!
It can get crowded at night. They do have an A/C room on the 2nd floor."
Just WOW!,This is an historic (opened in 1908) and authentic Indian/Malay restaurant right across from a beautiful mosque. The food is incredibly delicious and the service is pretty fast considering the number of people that show up here each day.
The cashier wasn't freindly,"We ordered 3 main dishes, it tasted good and can still accepted. Foods weren't that expensive. The staffs on level 1 were friendly but not downstair on the ground floor. Cashier wasn't even smile and she just gave us the bill without saying anything."
Recommended arabic tasty food,"Easy to reach the location, great tasty food, I ordered:

Muttons Briyani 9/10
Chicken Briyani 9/10
Deers Murtabak 8/10
Ice Longan 8/10

The portion are great enough. For people who doesn't really like arabic food but wanna try arabic taste can go to this place because there's no smell for the food ingredients and the food taste are light for such of arabic food."
Very very bad service.. wll never go,"i went with family of 3 and ordered biryani and Chicken Murtabak. the staff is rude and dont care. Whoever came afterwards they got food and started eating, 3 families they came after us,, may the the hotel knows them or they are preferred people

I will never go there,because of the rude and unfair attitude of staff there'
the owner at the cash register was ok guy."
Bad bad service,"Staff is rude as hell in all aspect.
We bought some mains, everyone’s main came except for one, waited patiently for 30mins after every finished eating, and still not here. Called a waiter to check for me but he brushed me off like as if I’m impatient. And still had to wait another 15mins and reminded a 2nd waiter before the food came after an hour total. Was not even packed. Forget my order just admit it. Crap service. And worst part, they close at 11pm but at 1030 the waiter for whatever dumb reason wanted us to leave so he wiped half the table and left the cloth on table and stared at us to force us to leave. Hello we are paying customers and we are not done eating. Mind you the place was not even packed. Been patronising them for years. Time to go victory just next door. Bye felicia"
Great Murthabak!,"Stopped here after visiting the mosque in the Arab quarter and sampled Murthabak for the first time. It was busy and a hive of activity with the chefs rolling out pastry non stop. The Mee Goreng and Nasi Goreng were less remarkeable, but I would defintely recommend the Murthabak."
Tasty and Cheap,Family dining recommended at first floor. Chicken Buriyani and Murtabak was excellent. Mutton Murtabak was the best. Portions are good for the price. Ice coffee was average. Quick service.
Another stomach-filled trip to ZAM ZAM Restaurant in Singapore!,"A great meeting point when you are in Singapore! It gets bit crowded tough in th evening and night hours. As usual, I ordered the legendary Mutton Murtabak or Lamb Murtabak! Try to eat them with your fingers, guys! That is the best way to taste these delicious menus..."
Surprisingly tasty and cheap eats,Found the surroundings quite scruffy and worn but the friendliness and helpfulness of staff was great. The food itself was plentiful and of good quality with complementary curry sauces and small side serve of seasoned cucumber. We had a fish biryani and Kumar chicken curry and a chicken Murtabak which were good but most surprisingly was the cost of the meal for the 2 of us including drinks was much less than one Singapore sling we had at the Raffles hotel the day before.
Amazing Murtabak,YES! This place is great and provides tasty and yummy food. We tried the by chicken biryani and this was delicious with the rice being very fragrant and the chicken superbly moist. But go to this place and try the lamb murtabak which is sensational.
Good Economical Indian Food,"Comfortable 2nd Level fully air condition area. Try 1. Mee goreng, 2. Meat Briani rice, 3. Chicken Murtabak 4. Tea Tarek, 5. Kathirah drinks Add fish had curry, yummy...... If you love the smell of curry, use your fingers while having your meal."
Good food,While visiting Sultan Masjid we found this Indian Sing fusion restaurant. Food at this place was good especially the Tabbaraq (Stuffed Paratha/Indian pan fried bread) and the fish curry. Service was excellent.
Delish,"Fast tasty crispy murtabak with tasty chicken was the order of my day. Staff probably thought me strange wanting a table looking across the street (& not upstairs in ac). Exciting watching the passing traffic, mosque across the road and orders for Zam Zam being taken then directly to drivers on their way past. Simple, quick and tasty."
The cuisine is excellent,"We had extremely positive impressions from this restaurant. My husband and I visited this place, I really like the cuisine and the beautiful design - it's nice to spend time here. The service is polite; in general, I like everything. I recommend."
Day and night for long grain briyani rice @ Zam Zam,"An early lunch or brunch for the best from the long grain basmati rice briyani here at Zam Zam. The taste & freshness of the briyani always the best ever since my childhood days.

Come and try its mutton & chicken briyani along with its murtabak, you will understand why people flock into the restaurant day and night!"
Great place for breakfast,We went for breakfast but the lunch and dinner looked just as good. It’s cheap and cheerful and the foods good and plentiful. We had to line up to get a table but didn’t wait long.
Great place to have Halal Arab / Indian / Moslem food.,"Had a chance to dine at this place. In terms of aura and glamour its a shade on the lower side but in terms of food taste , quickness of delivery and service its right up there with every top notch restaurant of Singapore. Any body who wants to have a good Biryani or Muratabaq should certainly visit this place on the Arab Street. I was fairly impressed by the quality and taste of their food."
Fresh Martabak,"We Went to zam zam for breakfast 08.00, the restaurant is clean and ready to serve customer. There are 3 family also having breakfast, i guess they are tourist (indonesian/malay).

I order mutton martabak, prata, bihun goreng and teh tarik. The food is fresh, and yummy, especially martabak. Unfotunatelly Nasi Biryani is not available before 10am."
Lunchtime murtabak,"I came here earlier in the week with a few friends for a lunchtime murtabak. Quite a long time since my last visit, but just as tasty as usual. Worth another visit."
Nothing special,"I went to this place twice because it was close to my hostel. Comparing to other restaurants in the area, this is a very cheap option. First dish that I ordered was Chicken with rice. I had a piece of chicken with bone and very less meat. On the other day, I ordered the murtabak with beef. It came with more fat than everything. Disappointing."
DELICIOUS and great for a late night meal but service was horrid,"We stumbled upon Zam Zam while wandering and looking for food one night in Singapore and it was packed and smelled amazing. The good: the food was DELICIOUS. I'd never had murtabak before and absolutely loved it. The bad: service was so incredibly rude. I asked a few questions and the server wouldn't even look me in the eyes (he was on his phone) and rolled his eyes once or twice. My questions were nothing crazy, I was just trying to ask the size of the murtabak. While we were eating, we heard screaming from the room next to us and there was a mouse scurrying around. One of the workers smashed it with a mop and then with his foot, and then carried on like nothing happened. I'm not too surprised by the mouse, but my friend couldn't eat after that. I still enjoyed the food!"
Good food at a low price,If you are looking for a cheap street food experience. This is a great place! And it was filled with people
A very delicious food with a low price,"Knowing Zam Zam restaurant for a long time, I have heard many good reviews about it. Recently, I went there and I confirm that thw taste of the food definitely deserve best comments and reviews!
The restaurant was established more than a hundred years ago (have no idea if in the same location or they changed their location). It's located next to the Arab street and if you go to the second floor you'll have a nice view of the Sultan mosque.
Try their iconic mortabak and biryani."
Unpleasant,"Dont know what the fuss about this place, theres nothing that is good in here the food is meh, the drink is meh, the atmosohere and cleanlinese of the restaurant is terrible. A very unpleasant dining experiance! So terrible, if I could give 0 star,I would!"
Good food,Iconic. Really good food! Very affordable. Really good serving size. Overall great for everyone. Love it!
Encounter unpleasant reaction from counter lady,"1. I was given a unpleasant reaction from the counter lady.
2. The shop assistant outside has asked me politely what would i want to eat.
3. I had forgotten to inform him my food is for din in.
4. I asked politely to the counter lady where should i collect my food.
5. She reacted impatiently 'You wait lah, you just order only, how i know.
6. The shop assistant then clarified with me & quickly prepared the food for me to din in.
7. However, i had felt i have been given a unpleasant reaction from the counter lady.
8. I guess perhaps i never put on a tie & wear smart attire and she look down on me.
9. I feedback to other two staff & they say politely they are sorry of what had happened.
10. I did not enjoy my meal at all for the next ten min & i feel like crying
11. I had visited this place as early as year 2000 when being bring along by my indian muslim friend + occasionally i had also visited to try their food.
12. But today at around 2010h, i feel that i am not being valued enough to be their customer due to the reaction of 1 particular staff .
13. But today at around 2010h, i feel that she don't give a damn whether i am a customer of their place.
14. There are so many menu i had not tried in this Zam Zam restaurant.
15. But today, i finally realized that she don't welcome a small little nobody like me to patrol their place.
16. Maybe next time, i have to visit there in a group & wear suit & tie then she will talk nicely to me. ‍‍‍
17. I would rather dressed comfortably to visit any restaurant & perhap they will welcome me to visit their place.‍♂️‍♂️
18. Therefore, i will have to give up my interest to sample more of their food & try other food restaurant in the future as she don't like me.
19. I do not know what i had done wrong to deserve this kind of reaction from the counter lady."
Mediocre,"I find this place seriousky over rated and I've had better elsewhere.

Murtabak filling is just dry despite being ""generous"" and curry dip is just a other disappointment.

The bee hoon goreng needless to say, no comment.

Not a place I'd recommend. Only suitable for foreigners.

Service is horrible and food easily forgettable."
Very Busy,We went for dinner on the reommendation of our hotel and were very surprised to find the place very busy. The food was excellent and the staff very helpful
Very disappointing food,"A couple of years ago we had eaten at a restaurant called Tasneem which is just a few metres away and we were really impressed with the quality and taste of the food, so thought to give Zam Zam a try. What a mistake that was. We went up the stairs to the second floor which is air-conditioned and found ourselves an empty table. There was a Singaporean family sitting on the table next to us but the waiter gave the menus to us before them which was a bit embarrassing.

So we ordered the chicken biryani, nasi goreng ikan bilis, prata and two Milo dinosaurs, an iced teh o limau and an iced teh tarik. Unfortunately they told us that they were not serving prata despite it being on the menu so that was a big disappointment for the kids who love it, so we ended up getting a plate of french fries for them. The next problem was that the waiter served two Milo drinks without the powder, so they had to take them away and add the Milo powder on the top as we had ordered Milo dinosaurs.

The fried rice came and it was actually quite nice although the presentation was a bit boring. Perhaps a piece of cucumber or something else might have made it look better. However, the chicken biryani was really terrible. Chicken biryani is actually one of my favourite dishes ever and I was so disappointed that Zam Zam served such poor quality food. The rice was pretty tasteless, light and dry with no tasty bits in it. The chicken was very dry and hard and had a wet runny gravy over the outside which was weird. When I tried to cut the chicken with my spoon and fork it was so tough and dry that the rice went flying across the table. It was the worse chicken biryani that I have ever eaten.

We started chatting with the people on the next table to us and they had seen my chicken biryani and noticed that it was very dry and they told us that Zam Zam was only really famous for martabak. I wish we had known that before coming here. They had ordered a deer martabak and a mutton martabak and offered me to try both with some curry sauce. People can be so friendly and generous in Singapore. So I did try both and it was not bad but certainly not as good as a good chicken biryani should be. I now really regretted coming here.

Our bill came to S$25. The person paying before me had used a debit or credit card to pay but they told me we had to pay cash. No problem, but lucky we just about had enough cash to pay the bill.

In conclusion, I should have skipped eating at Zam Zam and eaten either at Tasneem which is along the same stretch of shop houses or at any one of the nice looking restaurants nearby or at one of the Turkish restaurants behind the Sultan mosque which I will probably try next time."
Where the locals go,I love this place. Went here for breakfast and didn’t know what to expect but it was great and yummy. If you want to experience the local culture of Singapore you have to try this place. Food is simple but full of flavours and spices. I had my breakfast at Zam Zam twice and love their dishes. Have I mention for breakfast I paid just $2. I must have left that one out lol.
Disappointed,"I'm not normally one for giving bad reviews - I generally just don't go back but given the number of good reviews for this place I'm left rather perplexed as they are the reason we went. We're visiting with friends and we all came here as they'd seen the good reviews. What a disappointment. The food was average at best - dry chicken and flavor-less rice. It was the service that was the killer for me though. Basically non existent. Not one smile from anyone apart from the cashier. The service staff were surly and abrupt, it seemed we were more an inconvenience. Definitely would not recommend and most certainly would never go back."
Our favourite food in town,"Sometimes it's the reason we visit Singapore, just to eat this delicious murtabak. It's not a fancy restaurant, sometimes we have to share the table with others because it's always full."
"Really good food, excellent value.","We sat at one of the tables by the roadside facing the Sultan Mosque. We had two murtabaks and another dish and all were really tasty, served quickly and at exceptional value."
Best teh tarik,The best teh tarik in town with affordable price..they also have many variants of food with good taste
What you see is what you get!,"Forget calorie-counting here! Food was down to earth and tasty. The mutton mutarbak was simply delicious. Curries not something I would re-order and the mutton biryani was flavorful.
Location, easy to find when you are in the Sultan Ahmed mosque area. Upstairs sitting was simple and no frills.

So good, we came back twice given we were staying very close by."
Lousy food.,This eatery used to be very good. I ordered 1 plain and 1 egg roti prata and teh tarik. Waited for 15 minutes. Teh Tarik not hot. The roti not crispy but soft and fluffy. Worst the roti with egg burnt. Why put them on must visit. Shame to Singaporean food kakis.
An experience.,Do not expect anything fancy as it is not. Expect fantastic local food at a great price and you won't be dissapointed.
Why no prata,We kind of know the eatery do not make / serve prata anymore. However this morning I saw a customer having prata and tried ordering however was rejected.. I felt really sad. It’s ok to not serve it anymore but it’s not ok if you are making for other customers as well (I am not sure why)...
PLEASE READ IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO GO,"Dont trust google maps!
For those of you who are wondering where this is , it's in Arab Street man! we were wondering around for 1.5 hours just to reach this place, some says it was in Bugis and some says it was in little india, but it's notttt , it's in Arab Street, right in front of Sultan Mosque!
The food? You wont regret it!!"
Great place but murtabak needs to be better,"Ok let’s do it, this is a great no frills place with good food and good casual service located in the Muslim quarter of Singapore opposite the sultan mosque.

Would have happily awarded 4 stars to this popular well priced dining spot but there was clearly something missing on taste impact which needed to be higher for the Lamb murtabak and the chicken murtabak was too wet having been stuffed with a curry rather than a dry chicken.

Biriyani was nice but not mind blowing.

Would still recommend popping in as it’s a great experience."
Finally Satisfied my craving,"Have been craving for these food for a long, long while after viewing many photos of them posted by friends and visitors to the restaurant. Nevermind the cholestrol and calories. At most, exercise more & burn more. Finally I made a trip there today. No regrets. One of the best mutton bryani n murtabak served in town. The curry mutton was very tender and serving was generous too. Prefer the mutton murtabak than the chicken for the former was more tasty then the chicken breast meat."
Good biryani,"I enjoy the mutton biryani, the mutton is quite tender and its a decent portion. Overall, good food. Prefer to takeaway though and it's easy as you can order from the side of the road while in your car."
Different and yummy!,"American expat with Lao wife visited, had the chicken biryani hot pot and mutton murtabak...biryani had a whole bone-in chicken breast and flavorful rice, murtabak is a savory pancake stuffed with mutton onions and spices. 100 year old establishment with tons of upstairs cooked seating...worth a try and reasonably priced."
A must destination for a mutton biriyani fix,"I have to eat here on each of my annual visits to Singapore; the air-con room upstairs is welcome after hiking around Bugis and the Arab quarter. The mutton is tender and sometimes I get an especially good serving -- even boneless -- buried beneath a mound of tasty yellow biriyani rice and accompanied by a dish of gravy. I'm always tempted by the other dishes shown on the big posters on the walls, but I can't bring myself to detour from the dish that I came for.

This is not fine dining aimed at a tourist crowd, but a place to get a satisfying, well-prepared meal at a reasonable price."
not too bad...,Very popular mamak restaurant. Famous for their briyani & murtabak. Which I have to say was pretty good. Decent portions. Packed with flavor. Pretty big no frills restaurant. Friendly & quick service. Affordable. Crowded during peak times but they have lots of space. Worth a stop.
Great value and experience,"From the outside there is little that would draw you to eat here but ask for a table upstairs and take on the experience. We ordered with the help of the waiter and could barely finish our meal. The ‘gravy’ was delicious as was the chicken Murtabak, a house special. As someone who usually gets a curry in the U.K., there is simply nothing to compare on value for money, also alcohol free, so you also have to be adventurous on the drinks! £11 all in..........."
Popular with locals,"My husband had been there in the 1960's and always wanted to find it again. It was a great ""curry house"" then but, as often happens, is now completely different although they are proud of the fact that it has been there for over 100 years.

It is now Halal, very popular, and is now a ""cheap and cheerful"" restaurant and he couldn't get his Curry with chapatis!! We had Kway Teow Goreng Chicken and Beef Biryani which was just okay."
Meh...,"We went here to try the murtabak since it seems like THE place... Honestly, it was only average. I can see the appeal and the place seems really popular amongst locals but I found it a bit unexciting and unrefined. Sort of just dough, onions, and beef. Underwhelming at best."
Must try the Fish Head Curry,"My friends and I had dinner here last night. The place was busy but the service was fast and good as always.

We ordered the Murtabak, Nasi Goreng and the must have Fish Head curry which was wow. Nice kick to it and goes down well.

A must visit when in Singapore"
Tasty Food but tight space,"Had a dinner with 5 other friends yesterday. Food dishes were tasty and well cooked, full aromatic curry & murtabak were cooked to good texture! Only shortcoming is putting too many tables and chairs in the available space, not much walking space and I have to shift my chair a few times to allow other patrons to walk by."
Biryani and Murtabak,A compulsory stopover every time I visit SG. Fluffiest biryani rice and tasty dishes. The beef murtabak is also highly recommended. Always hectic during meal times
"Good service, bland food",This place is good if you want a cheap meal with good service. Apart from that it was nothing special. The food I found a little bland
Yum Yum,"I wanted to savour authentic Malay food at prices only found in the hawker centres and discovered ZAM ZAM. With only a handful of of tables tightly packed on a busy kerb on North Bridge Rd its all about the food and not comfort. Beef Murtabak, tandoori chicken and 2 lemon juice drinks for leas than S$10. Pay a visit."
Average taste,"For an Indian food in Singapore it’s everywhere, the location is easy to find,you can take Bugis mrt green line train.if you’re lost just ask for the mosque, it’s just opposite. Prices are affordable.but the taste I find it normal in a nice way.its nice but I still can taste the same thing in other hawker ctr in Singapore. But no harm on trying."
Murtabak - oh wow!,"We downloaded a walking tour of Kampong Glam and it mentioned this place. Since we were walking by and feeling hungry around lunchtime we paused and were eagerly ushered to a table outside, with a view of the mosque over the road.

We ordered a chicken murtabak to share, since the size was huge. Oh wow - it's one of the best things I tasted in Singapore - and such good value. Delicious savoury filling wrapped in a crispy shell. I'm still drooling just thinking about it.

If we'd had more time in Singapore I would have gone back to try something different for dinner. If you're wandering around this area, don't hesitate to stop in and try the murtabak"
Great food,"First time in Singapore. This restaurant serves fast delicious food. The chicken briyani and the chicken murtabak were amazing, also the Ice limau it is awesome."
