Real chop suey,"We like this cafe and visit whenever we are in Singapore.
The ambiance is good and has an old fashioned feel.
The location is honest old Singapore with real trees etc.
The food is good quality and very varied giving ample opportunity to sample a mix of cultures.
A step out from the norm."
Great place to show case the variety of regional food,"We regularly bring first time visitors here , since they can sample a variety of regional dishes in one place, with lots of atmosphere. If you can, sit outside at night.
This time we brought our son and his fiancee, who has to eat carefully because of food allergies. She did well with spicy food, but check if your guest cannot handle chilli dishes.
Service has improved since our last visit, and the food quality is excellent. Generous portions so you can over order. Purists will find better versions of many of these dishes in Singapore, but the places where you can go to taste all of these in one sitting are very few.
We did not order alcohol, but usually I recommend a jug of beer, given the spicy stuff."
Still a favourite escape,"Always amazing food, in even more amazing surroundings. Sitting surrounded by the jungle is a great escape from the hussle and bustle of the city. Excellent menu, with delicious cocktails. A firm favourite."
"Great food, not great service.","Really fantastic food in a lovely setting. Service wasn’t great - we had to keep signalling to the waiter despite the restaurant not being busy. That said, the food was so good that we had a great lunch. The mixed dim-sum was great and the chilli crab was wonderful."
Dim sum - perfect,"We don't really like Dempsey, but we do really like dim sum.

So, going to Chop Suey Cafe in Dempsey was a trade-off.

We had previously eaten at the other Chop Suey Cafe in Martin Rd but this has closed down some time ago, so we went to Dempsey.

We knew that dim sum was only served until 6pm. We got caught in a torrential downpour and waited for a taxi for >20 minutes in Scotts Rd. We were fearful of missing out on dim sum. We arrived at 5.20pm, which we calculated would allow us time for a decent shot at everything on the menu. We were correct.

Our favourite was the pumpkin and prawn. The lobster was quite good also. The mushroom one (steamed, healthy and a bit spicy) was also very good. There were others, but I do not recall.

Based on our experience, I feel I can safely say that you cannot go wrong with whatever is on the menu.

And by the way, it is a nice place with good ambience, good staff and a reasonable drinks menu."
"Good food, ambiance but outrageous corkage fee!!","I always loved going to Chop Suey, great food, setting, and staff. I used to come here often with friends, and we would bring our own bottles of wine to enjoy. This time around, it was to my own surprise that corkage fee was at $75 per bottle (or buy 1 from them, get your corkage free off 1 of your own) and found it to be extremely boosted!! If you are planning to go and being your own wine, please think twice as I am still in shock."
Good food in a beautifull setting.,We had a great lunch with friends. Dim Sum were dillicious. The main courses were also of good quality and taste. Friendly and professional staff.
Very ordinary,Sorry but don’t understand the good reviews. Food is at best bland but very ordinary. Service poor and by no way a reflection of any type of Asian cuisine. Just for tourists
Superb Chinese cuisine,"We visited Chop Suey for dinner and it didn’t disappoint. The food was lovely - superb steamed dumplings we shared for starters were outstanding, as well as the edamame beans with a spicy, garlicky sauce. For mains, I had a crispy beef in orange sauce and it was delicious. I didn’t pay much attention to their wine list/drinks menu simply because I was 100% bought into Tiger beer as my beverage of choice for my time in Singapore! The interiors were lovely, white walls with dark wood and fans suspended from the ceiling. A classy joint, in a lovely neighborhood. My only quibble was—as someone with a nut allergy, my choice of desserts was extremely limited (but my colleague’s sticky toffee pudding looked amazing)!"
Cool place to enjoy a lunch,"This was our first visit to Dempsey Hill so we were a little uncertain what to expect and hadn’t done a great deal of research. This cafe looked intriguing tucked away at the end of one of the rows of barracks, indeed it was so well concealed that it took me several minutes to realise we had stumbled upon one of the best restaurants on the complex of not Singapore. Great selection of food and drinks with outstanding service. I think it’s fair to say it’s skewed towards European style and tastes which is not meant to be in any way a criticism and in any case Singapore is such a fusion who knows anyway..highly recommended."
Great food in a beautiful setting,Great food in a beautiful setting. We had an excellent dim sum lunch. It’s close to the Botanical Gardens and well worth the detour!
Bad service for a group,"I had a group of over 10 guests over lunch and we had to pay for them. The management of this venue was totally inflexible while finding a way to sort the payment out with the only solution to go on site and pay at the end of the meal. They did not even want to talk to me... What a service-oriented place for a chain of cafes in town!
Lucky enough the restaurant manager was smart and customer oriented and allowed me to transfer money on his personal account and he could then pay on my behalf.
We live in the world of digital how can anything like this happen?

Big thank you to Mr. B for his help but I will in the future avoid going to any of these cafes that I use to regularly visit and of course, I will not send any of my guests any more as the management seem to have to much business to care for loyal customers."
Second visit,"I think this is an amazing restaurant, visited last year and loved it, saying I would want to revisit Singapore just to come back, so this is what we did! The staff were friendly and helpful, the interior is just beautiful and the food was lovely. However, I do think that for what we ordered last week, it was very overpriced. This would put me off coming again sadly."
One to add to your restaurant list,"Beautiful location, staff are amazing and the food wow. Wish I took more photos. The Beef Rendang, so moist and full of flavour. Also try the octopus for starters."
Nice Surrounds & Meal,"Enjoyed very much, highlights were actually the wine, dessert, and coffee. Aishsa was a lovely waitress, which made for a very nice experience."
Nice ambience...but ultimately...just poor food for tourists,"Dempsey Road is of a course a great cluster of restaurants and Chop Suey Cafe is right at one extreme end, which, if you get an outside table, gives you a nice view onto greenery. I can't really fault the helpful and attentive service but the food was just pathetic. The mains were passable but the starters were just poor, poor, poor. Several dishes just didn't bear any resemblance to their menu descriptions. If you're picky about your food, I would avoid."
"Decent Food, but you have to LIE","Service staff at this restaurant STRICTLY sits guests based on table size, regardless of whether they are full or not. I went there with a party of 2 and they refused to seat me at a 4-seater even when there were 4 to 5 4-seaters available my dining during non-peak hour. Another table of 2 told them they had a 3rd guest to secure a 4-seater. The third guest never arrived. YOU HAVE TO LIE TO BE COMFORTABLE!!???"
"Great food, wonderful setting","Setting is wonderful, food is great, but don’t expect a cheap evening! Have eaten here many times now. Only issue we’ve ever had is with the booking - too often we end up not getting an outside table as we requested. Best bet is to email Brian the manager directly and he always sorts it out properly."
Consistently good,We went here for Sunday Brunch. We had dim sum which was interesting and a little different than others. We also had a noodle dish that was delicious. They have chicken bao for those who don’t take pork. There is indoor and outdoor seating. The floral displays are gorgeous. I have eaten here several times and the food is consistently good.
Tasty treats in the shuttered palms,"Driving into Dempsey Rd dining precinct after dark is a fun, with the swaying glowing willows surrounding the stunningly restored army barracks that now contain a wonderland of modern and traditional dining experiences. Enjoy spicy delights of Setchuan et all in breezy colonial surrounds. Pricy but worth it."
Would definitely recommend,"We visited chop suey whilst on holiday in Singapore and we are definitely glad we went. The service was attentive, quick and friendly and the food was amazing. It is well worth a visit."
"Quiet, secluded gem","As a visitor to Singapore, I was invited along for dinner with work colleagues.
From the warm friendly greeting to the beautiful setting, I could tell this was going to be a treat... and so it proved to be.
The food was amazing (so much to choose from), beautifully presented and delicious and the wait staff were very friendly and accommodating. Special mention to Aishah whose lovely smile and impeccable service was as much a highlight as the atmosphere & the food.

Highly reccommend!

Thank you, would love to come back next time I'm in Singapore!"
Restaurant,Always love this place for its location and food. Always a pleasure! Less of a family place though. Nearby PS Cafe of the same owners is great for families!
Setting is great - food is just OK,"Do not go there only for the food, as it is not exceptional - vaguely Chinese but without too much subtlety.
However, the environment, at the end of one of Dempsey's main building, makes up for what the food likes in uniqueness. Outdoor seating, in particular, is very pleasant, with the right level of animation.
Service is somewhat casual, but acceptable."
Nice for lunch or brunch,"Four of us ordered very different things - some dim sum, some traditional menu items. Gluten free is available, which is one reason our friend who lives in Singapore likes eating there. You can dine inside or out, but of course most people dine outside, under umbrellas and surrounded by greenery."
A wonderful restaurant.,"First time to Chop Suey for dinner with friends and was very impressed. Its a lovely restaurant up on Dempsey Hill. The restaurant is in a colonial style building with ceiling fans, rattan chairs, tables candles (at night) and 1930s style soothing music. The restaurant has a warm and friendly feel to it with indoor and outdoor seating and serves ""rustic"" chinese dishes with a western twist. The food menu is very appealing with a good selection of starters, salads, soups, dim sum, mains, noodles and rice dishes. We had spicy mushroom spring rolls and crispy shredded duck pancakes to start, followed by Szechuan Pepper Chili Chicken, Pork Ribs, Chili Prawns and Long Life Vegetarian Noodles washed down with a couple of cocktails and a couple glasses of Sauvignon Blanc (oh - the drinks menu is not bad either!). The size portion is generous, the food is well presented and it tastes delicious. Overall we had a very enjoyable experience in a great restaurant that is not overly expensive. I highly recommend it and will definitely go back."
Great atmosphere and food was awesome,A friend took me here on my first visit to Singapore and I absolutely loved it. Such a fun atmosphere and the food was really amazing. Definitely on my list to return to on my next visit.
Beautiful Food and Ambiance,"Another visit to this fabulous restaurant in Dempsey Hill where the surroundings are only matched by the food.Chinese influence but with a twist of contempory dining that melds other flavours to compliment the dishes.
Duck pancakes,Halibut with ginger, green beans with mince followed by crab fried rice enjoyed with cold Reisling followed by a sumptuous red from South Australia.
The 1940's music extends the delights of the evening.
Just a wonderful way to enjoy time with friends"
Good choice when friends in town,"There’s no doubt about it, the building and restaurant is beautiful. For impressing friends with a bit of style and glamour, Chop Suey is hard to beat. Wide food choice, great drinks list and a pleasant evening out. And my litmus test for restaurants? (4/5 for toilet cleanliness and presentation)

That said, the last time we went the service was really hit and miss. Suggestion to the management / get some discipline back with your staff, teach them about the menu and above all, give them some positive lessons in customer service. The building is too lovely for crap service!"
Very good food,We had a great meal and service at Chop Suey. A variety of Chinese fare and beverages. In a very nice area of Singapore on Dempsey Hill.
"Not great service, food good","Went for a Thursday evening dinner without reservation. Waited 15 mins for a table which was fine as we hadn’t booked, but no offer of ordering drinks in meantime .....just left alone. Service was pretty random throughout the entire meal but the food was good (Baramundi in lemongrass broth very good as were the ribs). Red wine arrived ice cold which was not good for a $100 Sing bottle of wine. The room and location are nice. Could be very good!."
Was good but not anymore,"Chop Suey used to be a favourite of mine but unfortunately it's gone right off. The chilli jam prawns, which used to be great, are now a complete miss with a new recipe. The ribs had barely any meat on them. I found myself scraping the bones with a knife just to get anything off them. They weren't really servable. The orange beef dish is hardly recognisable as beef as it's over fried to complete crisp without any bite left in it. The $110 bottle of Rose was warm and I had a hard time getting ice. Service was very slow. It's a shame to see a goos spot go off like this. I won't be back."
One of the best Chinese experiences......,"It was a dinner for 4 and when we arrived we were sat in the middle of the service road so we asked to be moved and that was done when another more suitable table became free. The food was top drawer the duck salad was exquisite and the ribs truly delicious also the chilli jam prawns hit the spot.
Is it me or is soft shell crab overrated - I was persuaded to have some as I was told it was a treat - nope still overpowering taste of soft shell and grease and little meat taste still I tried.
The beer was ice cold and the shiraz was met with approval - all in all a very worthwhile visit - the price was on the toey side but hay its Singapore which is pricey."
Great food in a beautiful are.,"I think this might be the best place in Dempsey Hill. The food is delicious and the ambiance is great, specially at night.
It is a high level Chinese western cuisine and I think it is quite good as an introduction to Chinese food. The prices are high, but at least you don’t get disappointed with the food."
"Great food, excellent drinks list. Slightly random service","Chop Suey is a beautiful restaurant in terrific surrounds. It’s definitely a place to take out of town guests, host a work do or a special occasion. Love that they give you citronella spray if sitting outside. Food is consistently excellent, if on the pricey side. Good portion sizes that Xsan be shared. Innovative drinks list as well.

That said, on the three occasions we have been there, the service was a bit hit or miss. And that’s why I’m not giving 5 stars."
Light Dim Sum lunch,My 5th visit. Popped in for a quick and a light lunch. I really enjoyed the Dim Sum. Not cheap but the portions are generous. Service was quick and friendly. No complaints and definitely recommend.
Delicious,We had a lovely waitress to serve us today and a delicious lunch. We had the duck pancakes and wonton soup. Then soft shell crab it was the best ever especially the chilli soup. Lovely location. Highly reckoned! I'd love to get there for dinner sometime.
Disappointing,"This restaurant did not live up to expectations. I ordered ginger chicken that said it was breast meat. What I got was chicken thighs with gristle. When I mentioned this, the manager said he would check with the kitchen, told me I was correct and walked away. Just a ‘sorry’ would have been enough. The service was slow and disorganised. The drinks that we had ordered sat on the bar for 10 minutes while the staff had a chat. The smoked duck buns were delicious as was the chilli squid."
Top Shelf,"This place is an institution. Venue is great in probably the nicest building in historic Dempsey. And Dempsey itself does have history. The food menu for the most part hasn’t changed in 6+ years that I have been in Singapore. And that’s a good thing. Unerring focus on Chinese western fusion flavours with an emphasis in sweetness. Service is consistently good. Can’t be faulted for first time visitors to Singapore. And quite and more often 2nd, 3rd and 4th time visitors. The Singapore restaurant scene is improving monthly, which is saying something over the past 6 years, and we still love Chop Suey. A lot."
Don't Bother,"My wife & I visited Chop Suey on a recommendation of a friend & we were terribly disappointed. The restaurant is at Dempsey's Hill, a restaurant district in Singapore, & we really wished we had of chosen anywhere else.

We booked online a week before arriving in Singapore & when we were seated there was barely enough room to squeeze between tables to be seated. We waited 15 minutes before a waiter came over to take drinks orders & we had to ask for the wine list. The drinks were slow coming out & the waiter wanted our food order when he put the drinks down, we asked for another 5 minutes to decide.

We ordered 2 dishes which were both bought out to the too small table at the same time. We tried to get the waiters attention to order wine only to have the wrong wine bought to the table. The food was dry & only very average.

Our table was left uncleared for 20 minutes so we decided to have our dessert elsewhere.

Wouldn't recommend this restaurant."
"Good friends, nice staff, poor food","Had a nice time out with friends at Chop Suey tonight. The servers were nice. The ambience was beautiful. The omelet was bland. Ate a few bites and gave up. Tried sharing it with my friends with similar results. Another friend tried the salad with duck. The duck was off, so we tried to eat around it. This was the third night out and the previous two restaurants were great. So it was not too bad to enjoy the company of my friends, leave the food on the table, and lose weight."
Service not great,"I dined out every night in 10 days in Singapore. This venue is beautiful and off the beaten track but I felt the service lacked somewhat. I was a solo diner and wasn't especially well taken care of. The food order was wrong, the service was patchy and I generally felt a bit of an inconvenience."
Team dinner couldn’t have been any better,"After that title you would think I should give 5 stars but I seldom do that. The ambience and decor is lovely in a black and white them. The waiters were both attentive and friendly. The menu is great and we selected chili chicken, honey crispy chicken, vegetarian noddles, prawn pockets and broccoli. Everything was good and if I could give 4 ½ stars or even 4 ¾ stars they would deserve this. Thank you for a wonderful evening. So good I didn’t even stop to take photos"
Gorgeous outside dinning,Beautiful surroundings and good food on a balmy Singapore evening. The service was good and attentive but not over the top. The food came quickly but gave us time to rest between courses. A fabulous evening relaxing on the outside deck.
Last Night Treat,"This was my final night in Singapore after a week long trip. The place is really nice with colonial decor. The food was really tasty and we had dim sum with various mains.

Overall a really good place to eat but in Singapore there are better options for less money."
A surprise and a gem of a place,I met up with some work colleagues here and it is in a gorgeous area outside of the city but surrounding by tropical gardens and not far from the botanical gardens. We had a group of us and had some wonderful dim sum. My favourite was the crispy wonton lobster dim sum. The service is attentive the style is old colonial and it has inside and outside seating. Loved it.
Amazing place,"Really love this place! Went for the first time and met friends there. Loved the decor, great preservation of this old building, staff very professional but unobtrusive, food was delicious. Would go back to Singapore just to visit this restaurant - hope I get the opportunity to revisit!"
Good fusion bistrot food,"Great place quite trendy, with nice outdoor tables.Good customer service. Good wine list. Perfect for the ones that like Asian-Bistrot fusion style cuisine."
Very good dinner,"We visited the place at Dempsey.
The decor is nice and light.
Service is good.
We had rice with cod fish which was excellent and vegetarian green salad rolls which were special and very good. The highlight was the orange beef. Superb.
Fir desert the lychee desert was surprising snd excellent and do was the coconut pana Cota.
Recommend"
A very nice place in Singapore - quiet and authentic,"Great place, fusion Asian food. Amazing house, surrounded by nature. Food is really good, the service could be a little friendlier..."
"Lovely ambient, delicious food","Octopus, octopus, octopus is the absolute best! I mean, it isn't easy to get that much flavour into this meat. So awesomeeeee....salivating.

I tend to write long reviews but I'm gonna keep it short for Chop Suey.

Jade rice, yummmmmmmssssssss

Panna cotta, drooollllllll

Octopus, daaaa bessssstttttt.

Enjoy guys!"
Food good but awful piped music,This restaurant needs to make it clear that they play over loud piped jazz music constantly. It makes conversation difficult and frankly ruins the whole experience. I’ll say the food and the setting are good but I don’t go out for a family meal to be subjected to an assault on my eardrums. Won’t be back.
Beautiful location!,It’s nice to find a local resturant in a beautiful location. The ambience is good and the food is fairly good too! Will be back.
Exceptional,"Loved loved loved this restaurant at Dempsey Hill, perfect recommendations, lovely setting, great food and service with a smile. Happy to recommend and also return."
Pleasant Restaurant with an Nice Open Feeling,I was taken to the restaurant by a local couple for dinner. It was pleasant and the food was fine. I did not really like the chop suey---but I did when I was a boy in San Francisco. The food was fine but it was not exactly Chinese. The atmosphere was open and inviting---we ate inside---and I believe that the outside terrace would be a preferred location.
Delivered,"Quick informal and very tasty
We were with friends who used the area quite a lot as there are a few good restaurants on the plot.
It’s a bit off the tourist track but worth a very short taxi ride from orchard
Food was great.
Good is choices and reasonable pricing"
Slow boat to China!,"A great location and fabulous food; not typically traditional Chinese more accurately Chinese fusion - the meal(s) when they came were delicious. However, the staff were painfully slow and had to be reminded several times that we were still waiting for drinks - this detracted from the overall experience.
With improved service and more attentive staff the Chop Suey would have been a brilliant rather than mediocre experience.."
Great place to eat away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore,We come here every time we visit Singapore. This is our fish visit.I booked on line when we were staying in Vietnam. The food is excellent and the ambience is great too. I highly recommend this place.
Long time no chat,"Being easter five of us got together for a rabbit. This restaurant had a great environment for that. No loud background music. No hard wooden interiors to reflect all noise.

The food options are excellent and a bit different but mostly based on some favourites (such as Peking duck, sesame prawn toast, iceberg lettuce wraps). Their most popular main dish (advised by the helpful Desmond) is the honey chicken- it is well worth a try. The numbing pork (with Szechuan berries) is also excellent.

A good wine list and desserts, if room, completed a lovely meal and good blether.

Wheelchair accessible as it is all at ground level."
Good food in a lovely setting,"Went with some friends visiting from home. First, the interior is great, very light and airy. We sat on the terrace overlooking the lush greenery. The food was very good. We shared the Grilled octopus so delicious we ordered another serving, the Singapore Chilli soft shall crab was amazing and so much easier to eat than it’s more traditional but rather messy big Brother. We also had the dim sum baskets which again tasted great and had some real variety. We had some tea which was very light and refreshing. Just before we finished the heavens opened so we managed to get a table inside and enjoyed a couple of glasses of Sauvignon Blanc whilst waiting for the rain to go off. It took a while but we finally left after a lovely afternoon with good food and wine enhanced by service that was also good but not intrusive."
Great ambiance but mediocre food and dismal service,"I came here with my best friend, who was four months pregnant at the time and we were thoroughly disappointed with our dining experience. While the restaurant is nicely decorated and has a great ambiance, what ruined things for us was the dismal service. The food is not bad, but to be honest it's not that great either. However, in order to get our food we had to wait over an hour and a half. After 45 minutes of waiting, my friend started to feel sick, as she was pregnant at the time and hadn't eaten for a few hours. So, I called our server over to check on the status of our food and to inform him that my friend was pregnant and needed to eat as soon as possible. It seems like he had forgotten to place our order with the kitchen!! After that, we still waited 45 more minutes for our food! At the end of our meal, we asked the Manager to come speak to us about our experience - she then checked on what happened with our server and apologised to us. She offered our drinks to us free of charge - but it didn't salvage our disastrous dining experience! Unfortunately, too little, too late."
"Great food, not such good service.","We recently had a family dinner at Chop Suey. The restaurant is very attractive and it was nice to dine outside on a hot evening. We were seated promptly and orders were taken for drinks, although they took a long time to arrive. The starter courses were very good and the lettuce cups were delicious.
The main courses took ages to arrive. A bowl of rice was delivered to the table, but nothing else. My hungry grandson ate all the rice while waiting for the mains. When they did arrive eventually , one of the dishes was not what had been ordered but we couldn't attract the attention of waiting staff some I had to go and find somebody. Trying to order some more drinks wasn't easy either as we were given a wine list but no one came back to take our order. The main course dishes were very tasty, especially the honey ginger chicken, despite being nearly cold when we got to eat them as we had waited so long for the replacement dish to arrive. And when we had finished it was 15 minutes before our plates were cleared and we then had to wave down a waiter to order a dessert.
So overall, the evening was rather frustrating, especially as the food was so good but the general impression was spoilt by such slack service. Maybe they need a few more staff?"
"Fantastic ambience,good food","This place is one of the several restaurants on old army barracks area in Singapore. It boasts of several fine dines of various cuisines.

The server's are nice and the tables well appointed. You have to reserve the table.

We ordered chicken starters along with Sangria . Both were good. We also ordered rice which was well cooked .

Overall liked the place. Just one issue ...

My friend had a small hair in her wine glass which she discovered after half way thru. When she asked the waiter to change it, he brought back only half the glass...Either he just removed the hair or replenished only what was left. That left a bad taste. Most restaurants do service recovery by compesating but this one just don't bother to be as courteous."
Nice dinner,"It is a good place to taste Asian delights.
Every main is well balanced, it is tasty but not too spicy for unexperienced mouth.
Inside is definitely too noisy and we didn't appreciate that at 11 pm every lights is switch on to tell you to leave.
When you can book a table at 9 pm you should know beforehand that you will have to leave the place around 11.
Quite expensive place for only 2 hours on site.
But if you can come earlier and ask for a table outside it is a really good place to have a nice dinner."
Worthwile,"Although the name gives the ompresdion that it is a cafe, in fact it is a - nice- restaurant.
The food in this nice building is excellent( Asian) food and the service is excellent as well.
The restaurant is not cheap, but which high class in Singapore is?
In short: a good place to spend an evening."
Gorgeous restaurant serving sumptuous food,"This was a bit of a hidden gem on a recent trip. Recommended by a friend we headed there and initially was a little unenthused by the name but I am glad we didn't judge the book by it's cover.

The restaurant itself has a colonial feel and a lovely decking viewing out to the trees. The food (both Dim Sum and a la carte) were excellent - we ended up coming twice because it was that good.

The staff were lovely and I wish I had a restaurant like this near me in London!

Thoroughly recommend."
Unforgettable Food in Lovely Surroundings,"This place is one of the culinary gems of Singapore. I love the location (a very tastefully renovated army base) - green and natural in the centre of a city is always a plus. I love the building - like an old 'planter's house' with verandahs and and a choice of tables inside or out. Cool traditional decor brought subtly up to date. Calm ambiance. Professional staff who do not fuss or pester but leave you to enjoy yourselves whilst being easy to attract when needed. Add to this some amazing food, well thought out menus, excellent cocktails (says a man who hates cocktails) and good wine and you have a recipe for bliss. Prices are not cheap once you have been tempted by all the unavoidable little extras (my ginger pudding with some kind of fabulous 'anglais' was to die for, but even at SG$120 (£70) a head it was well worth it. Thank you."
Really good Chinese food,"The setting here was wonderful, we came at dusk for drinks and dinner and the sounds of birds and crickets amongst the rainforest trees was beautiful, with a distant view of the city. The decor is fabulous and colonial-style, it would be lovely for a wedding we thought. The food was also good, not outrageously so but a step above the Chinese food I can get at home, and nicest presented. The duck pancakes were great. The drinks were also good, I would return here. If you need pudding, you could do worse that the truffles!"
Amazing restaurant,Recommended to us by friend who live in Singapore. Truly exceptional experience and now one of our favorites. Everything was cooked to perfection and the setting and view from the garden was fantastic
Fusion at Chopsuey,"I was a bit confused with the menu of Chopsuey. Is it Chinese? Or Asian?

Well, I really don’t care. Food was good, period.

Truly enjoyed the different offerings from its wide menu: pad thai salad, hot and sour soup, steamed dumplings, szechuan pepper chilli chicken, Chopsuey itself, smokey eggplant ma po tofu, crab rice.

Good pairing was with hot peppermint tea.

Ambience is higher than average. Lots of greens around the restaurant. It must be better at night when cool air replaces the hot environment at lunch time.

Awesome lunch at Chopsuey."
"Fabulous Setting, Good Food","Wonderful setting they did an excellent job in ensuring this authentic place is kept tip top. The food is a fusion/creative interpretation of Asian Cuisine and is well presented and tasty. The cakes that are freshly baked keep on staring at you so you will end up trying them for desert and share them. Service is ok too. Recommend to book the round table in the semi private area, it allows you to enjoy conversation and semi privacy too. The terrace is also nice, perhaps for a coffee afterwards. For smokers there is a proper area outside the terrace too and it does not interfere with the other patrons. Well done. For us more of a special occassion restaurant to mingle with old friends and their kids."
Fusion food at its best!,"When we visit our family who live in Singapore the Dempsey area is one of our favourite local places to eat - busy but not overcrowded or noisy - upmarket with a range of different cuisine on offer. This was our first visit to Chop Suey there and we thought it the best restaurant so far!
Very stylish black, white, marble decor, modern but with a hint of Art Deco. Lovely big garden area surrounded by plenty of greenery...really nice relaxed atmosphere.
We ordered a mix of starters and main courses to share....the crispy duck pockets and prawn toasties were especially tasty, and the ginger chicken and spicy pork delicious. Two main courses with different rice and an interesting salad were plenty for the three of us.. a real fusion of traditional Chinese food with a modern 'take' and one of the best meals we have had in Singapore this visit.
The food and drink, especially wine and cocktails, were not cheap, to say the least. But we thought it well worth the cost and will certainly go again next time we come over! Recommended!"
Fantastic,"Love the food, the setting, beautiful indoor and outdoor seating. The food is amazing and dessert is to die for.....a great fusion Restaurant."
Never failed to impress,"Have come here often and it is a wonderful restaurant with a fantastic menu, consistent high quality and fabulous decor."
Really nice,What can I say.... service and food impeccable..... very professional staff.... rare nowadays.... A really good experience how dining should be. Not really anything than good comments about this one.
"Great food, beautiful setting","With family who live in Singapore they took us out to one of their favourite restaurants - Chop Suey. The food was absolutely divine - probably the best restaurant meal of our trip around Asia. We ate outside on the veranda amongst all the beautiful greenery/gardens. We had the lettuce cups, crispy beef and dessert of salted chocolate truffles - which were amazing and I was utterly disappointed when I got home and realised I'd left the final two (which I had wrapped in a serviette to take home) on the table!

Service was a bit so-so as when we arrived it took a long time for anyone to acknowledge us and greet us, and we also had trouble flagging down staff when we needed something during the meal - but they were very busy to be fair. Would definitely eat there again."
Beautiful restaurant set at the back of Demspey Hill,"Really enjoyed a late lunch here today. The food and coffee are good.

Pork ribs very tasty fall off the bone. Dark choc truffles with salt, very rich.

Golden banana with butterscotch... turns out it's a cake. It what I expected and not the best cake I've had."
Thank You dinner for Dearest,"Decided to try this place after searching the place called P.S Cafe over internet. Chop Suey is part of the same group of restaurants. This one locate at Dempsey is easy to find and tucked into a quiet corner. We did not make any reservations and just dropped in around 6pm and managed to get a table which we needed to vacate by 730pm, no problem.

Being first time visitors, we asked the waitress for her recommendations and it the choices turned out good. We tried a phad thai salad, chicken with dried red chilli (it was like kung-po diced chicken), crispy orange beef and chop suet mixed vegetables.

The phad thai salad was interesting as it was not fried but had the ingredients of the fried version. There was some glass noodles (or thin thai kway teow), large prawns (de-shelled) and the chef added salted fish bits which made a great impact on the taste and feel.

The service was friendly and during our meal, 2 staff came by to ask us how is the food and how is everything. We thought it was nice of them. We did not try any desserts as we wanted to try ice cream at the nearby Ben and Jerrys. Overall Chop Suey is a nice and quiet place for a meal. The theme of the food was more along the line of Thai food (maybe we only tried those recommended). We will try and visit P.S Cafe in the future."
Sunday night taste test,"Our friends took us to the delightful restaurant and what a lovely meal we enjoyed. Cocktails to start and I enjoyed a Long Island Tea made with real Oolong tea which gives it more of a bitter taste - so refreshing. This was followed by Starters of crispy duck pockets, san choi bao, and selection of steamed dumplings- all disappeared very quickly. When we tried to order a 3rd round of steamed dumplings our waitress politely but firmly advised not too based on the mains we had ordered. Thankfully we did not indulge.

Main courses included shared bowls of egg fried rice and chopsuey vegetables - both fabulous especially the vegetables. Then individual choices of ribs, chilli prawns, sweet and sour pork, whole roast chicken and five spice powder and pork fillet and Asian slaw salad. Nothing was left but we all knew how good the food was. Flavours, sauces, spices, and quality just perfect.

We would never have come across this terrific restaurant had it not been for staying with friends and their knowledge of local dining options. The area in Dempsey Rd where this restaurant is located is like a collection of every imaginable cuisine - definitely one to return to on another visit."
Contemporary Asian Cuisine with Serene Outdoor Ambiance at Dempsey,"We recently hosted international business guests at Chop Suey Cafe in Dempsey and were delighted to experience the serene outdoor ambiance by candlelight at Chop Suey Cafe at Dempsey.

The design of the outdoor dining provides you the sensation of eating on an oasis, in the natural greenery of Singapore.

The service is helpful with suggestions, courtesy and not pretentious, resulting in a relaxing evening dinner experience.

A great choice for business dinners, dinners for special occasions and romantic evenings.

The menu has a surprising assortment of appetizers, salads, soups and main dishes which I describe as contemporary Asian.

Do not forget to try the Seifried Nelson Pinot Gris white wine; a perfect choice for the Singapore evening climate."
Sunday brunch was pretty bad,"I have reviewed a ton of restaurants on Trip Advisor, this is one of the worst in terms of overall experience. One hour and ten minutes for the food to come, then only 4 of the 6 got their main course. Another ten minutes the two omelettes finally came, did not know it could be so difficult to make an omelette. Then a few minutes later I had to ask for the side portion of sausage I ordered to be delivered. Crab omelette was really tasteless. No waiters anywhere to be seen. Had to flag down the waiter (looked like the manager) for the bill. Bill came but when we wanted to pay we gave up and just went up to pay at the counter. Terrible service, mediocre food. Wouldn't go back even with free food coupons."
Dinner and then some,"Where do I start?!?! Firstly..do not get too full so you miss the 'Salted Dark Chocolate Truffle' OMG..heaven on earth!!!! We came for dinner on the back of a recommendation from somewhere!! I say somewhere as this place appears to be almost forgotten. The staff, especially Karen and Liza (with a Z) are delightful and make the occasion even better than the food - if that's possible."
Tasty Feast!,"The last time I visited Chop Suey Cafe was over 3 years ago. On going back a second time - I'm very happy to say, that it's as good as I remembered it from my previous visit! Very tasty - thank you!"
"Great food, great location.","Chop Suey and the Dempsey area came highly recommended by an Aussie friend residing in Singapore. What a great choice, the old world colonial charm of the restaurant was amazing. The attentive knowledgeable staff looked after us like we were VIP's. The food was simply amazing and exceptional value compared to similar style restaurants in Singapore. If you plan on visiting go early or stick around after dinner and explore the myriad of bars and other restaurants available to enjoy a night cap under the stars.

Great modern food,Were taken here with some expats living in Singapore and were not disappointed. The food was great and portion sizes were generous. The satay pulled duck was sensational. Wine list had a great variety and the jumbo profiterole for desert was great. Overall a great place to dine.
Great food,"Enjoyed a family dinner here with excellent food. Recommend the lettuce wraps, duck pockets and definitely the massaman and rusty nail beef is awesome. Huge menu and friendly personable service. The decor is lovely and location tip top. Recommend."
Great Asian food!!!,Location is ideal between all the venues of Dempsey hill. The interior is really well designed and resembles of another colonial era. Food is excellent.
Great modern Chinese fusion food and cocktails,"This was a return visit and it didn't disappoint. Situated in the great Dempsey shopping area, in a quiet corner looking out over bush to the inevitable high rises. Fantastic Asian flavoured cocktails. Inventive fusion food. Service was good again. If you are visiting Singapore, put this on your list as a 'Not to be missed'."
Lovely place to eat and relax,"Great food. Very friendly staff. Value for money. Relaxing ambiance for lunch or dinner or for that matter brunch, coffee or anything."
Family Meal,"This was an excellent meal. We were two families with five young children in tow. Although the restaurant is housed in a beautiful old colonial building that looks quite intimidating for a family from the outside, it was kid-friendly with a variety of options ranging from a too-die for trout and fried rice that was a hit with all the children. The cocktails are spectacular (although on the pricier ranger). Overall, highly recommend a visit to this restaurant (or many of the other great options) in the Dempsey area."
Nice Evening Meal,"Came here for dinner while visiting Singapore with the family. The service from the start was very good. The food is very nice and they have a decent drinks selection. Wasn't too keen on the desserts however. A little overpriced, but overall a nice meal."
American Chinese in a kitschy environment,"We love this place. In the last 6 months we have probably been here 4 times at least. Great drinks Super flavourful food. Must try the the Chopsuey mai tai, Sichuan chicken and the mapo tofu. Only recommendation I would have is that they consider including a children's menu. I wouldn't consider the place Super child friendly and felt like mine were in the way every time I took them. But hey the food is still great."
Memories of Cooky's food,"This is a very personal review as I liked the food because it brought back memories of my youth. In those days Singaporeans dined out, occasionally, at simple restaurants. The cook is usually a Hainanese man, and sometimes a Hainanese couple. That is, someone who came from Hainan, China. They cooked the best semi-western Chinese cuisine and they were usually nicknamed ""Cooky"".
Chop Suey serves a selection of ""Cooky dishes"" and very authentic. Brought us back to our youth having Saturday lunch at University of Singapore Bukit Timah Staff House, or Sunday lunch at Singapore Island Country Club.
We ordered the Crispy Fried Seafood Noodles, (very good). Medley of seasonal vegetables, Hainanese style pork chop fillets in sweet and sour sauce and potatoe chips (personal favourite), Crisphy orange beef (this is not Hainanese but a staple from Chinese restaurants in London, and done better than London), Smoked Duck Lychee Salad. Then we had the desserts and they were all excellent.
Will certainly go back."
Amazing food,A Great restaurant with an amazing ambiance! Great service but overall very very good food. Go here if you are in Singapore!!
I Love Chop Suey,"Chop Suey on Dempsey Hill is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. I've been here with kids, couples and business colleagues and it never fails to impress.

The setting is old world, black and white colonial charm, with wicker chairs and ceiling fans. The service and food are outstanding and they even play 1930s classics in the bathrooms!!

Favourites are the shredded duck pancakes, the fried beef in orange glaze (aka. rusty nails) and the sang choy bao.

Try to get a seat on the verandah...it's inside but feels like outside and less noisy than the main dining room.

I'm already looking forward to my next outing to Chop Suey Dempsey!!"
A treat,"Our last day in Singapore and we were treating our hosts to lunch in one of their favourite restaurants.
Colonial style restaurant with a good range of dishes on the menu. Waitress took time to explain whether hot/spicy and made some recommendations which were gratefully received. Seafood laksa was particularly good. Despite being on a development of restaurants , there were some nice views looking towards the skyline of Sinagpore."
Surprisingly Good,"I wasn't expecting much from Chop Suey -- I kept thinking it would be similar to bad American-style Chinese food -- but I was pleasantly surprised. Stuck to the vegetarian dishes as my dining companion doesn't eat meat, and everything we had was very good. Nice ambience. I hope to check out the Dempsey location soon as it is right near our home. I recommend."
Stick to the starters; the main stuck to me,"Meeting up with old friends I hadn't seen for many years I was delighted with the setting of this friendly cafe in what is basically an upmarket outdoor food court in a libel garden.

Fresh zesty starters full of taste and variety got me ready for the speciality spicy bully beef and egg pie which sounded intriguing. What it was was quiche with the consistency of Yorkshire pudding with a cold hard poached egg and what tasted like my old middle eastern horror - beef bacon - on top.

Stodgy wasn't the word. Tasteless was"
Locations is lovely and the food was fine but not amazing,Great place to meet up with friends. Quite an expat vibe in this part of Dempsey Hill. Lovely building but quite noisy if you choose to sit inside. I feel that this place isn't really about the food it's about the beautiful location. having said that we had a nice time catching up with friends here
Great atmosphere,Friendly but not over attentive service. Great selection of food and always well presented. Good specials which change weekly. Food always looks great. Good wine list. Love the look and feel of the restaurant....old colonial. A solid selection if at times a little expensive.
