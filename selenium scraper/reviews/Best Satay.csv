Yummy!,"Best stay chicken , beef and prawns I've had in a long time with great atmosphere. The street is closed every night so the locals can enjoy their delicious cheap bbq with beers. Can't wait to come back."
Not worth the 70+ min wait …,"Went to Lau Pasat markets wanting satays, as I was advised these hawker markets are known for them!
Best Satay had the longest line of all the satay vendors. I assumed it was because they were the best (pun intended) and popular for a reason! Waited in line for 25 mins. No probs. Once I got to the front and after I had paid, was advised there is another line to collect the food - the man confirmed it would be a 20 min wait and the line goes really quick. Annoying but fine.
Lined up for the collection line, to be told to come back in 20 mins. I assume they stagger them.
What a stupid mistake that was. I came back and waited 40 mins for collection.
All up waited approx 70 mins. The satay - it was nice but not mind blowing. My indonesian mum makes better satays than this!
Would not recommend - I am positive you could get satays like this elsewhere or at the other vendors."
Warning about wait.,"Had quite an unpleasant experience with this stall. We were surprised when we were given a receipt telling us to come back in 40 minutes to get our order, but okay, it looked like a busy night, and we set about biding our time. About 35 minutes later, we returned only to find a huge line of people waiting with receipts to pick up their food also. Had to wait in this line also, which took another 35 minutes. A total of 75 minutes after we placed our order. When questioned about this, the man, who I will think is the owner or manager said, we should have been in line 15 minutes before our appointed pick up time, and that we were told this (we were not). We expressed our displeasure at this arrangement, and he went off on a rant about how we were being unreasonable. I totally understand that things can busy, but what is not acceptable is not properly warning customers about the potential wait, continuing to take orders at a breakneck pace, and then being obnoxious when called out about it. Truly, are the other stalls really that much worse, to make that wait necessary? Be warned."
Very long wait,"I saw the line and knew there would be a wait ...was told 30min turned into an 1hr 30mins+ was given a buzzer to alert me when food would be ready. The buzzer went off ..got to the counter to collect the order was told it was not ready and was asked to go back to the line..At this point I just requested my money back and left!
DO BETTER GUYS."
One of the better satay joint,One of the better satay joint along this famous satay Street located just beside the Lau pa sat. You can taste the solid chunks of well marinated meats. Prices are reasonable as well.
The name says it all!,We came for Satays and we were not disappointed. Great mixed selection of beef and chicken. and great prices
Best Satay No. 7&8 are the best!!!,"Delicious food and extremely friendly staff. Ainon, the owner, is very kind, she spices up the place with her positive attitude and smile :)"
#7&8 best satay on the strip...,"7&8 was great satay loved the chicken and prawns, liked it so much had it 2 nights in a row...will be back one day and definitely heading here for the best satay... thanks no. 7&8"
Enjoyed a mix tailored to,"Enjoyed a mix tailored to us as a couple as my wife doesn’t eat meat. Therefore a balance towards prawns. All the satay were superb, and accompanied by a brilliant peanut dipping sauce. It’s two years since I used Best ... and still recommend it."
Name speaks for itself,"If you want to experience one of the best hawker markets in Singapore, you can do worse than heading here. We met up with two friends (who luckily had already secured a table for us) and have a fantastic evening. I really enjoyed the fact that there's the choice of multiple meats, as well as you being in control of what sauces and spices you want to try. Serving time took a while, but then I wouldn't really expect anything less at 7pm on a Friday. Highly rated!"
Best Satay Stall 7 and 8 at La Pau Sat,"Best Satay is really the best Satay in Singapore. I like the beef with spicy peanut sauce. Very delicious. I come back here every time I’m in Singapore. Great ambiance between the bank offices. 20 Satays for 14 SGD. And get a Tiger beer from one of the beer ladies for 5,50 SGD. What else?"
Best Satay,Yep the best satay I've ever had. It's on the street behind La Pau Sat. If you arrive just before 7 p.m. you can watch them turn the traffic street into an open street restaurant. Amazing in itself to watch. You can also put your order in just before 7 to avoid having to wait when the crowds arrive shortly thereafter.
Great meat,"Satay is a great way to cook meat, if you are a meat lover. We had grilled chicken satay from Stall 7 and 8. It was tasty especially when you dip it into the peanut ‘kuah’ sauce."
Convenient,This place is full with many varieties of food. I visited here one year back with my family and great taste added for asians.
Not bad but lacking order,"We went there on our first night in Singapore as it was recommended by someone who lives here. On arrival (around 11pm) we've noticed indeed a lot of locals eating there. As we walked in to the street area that contains the overnight food stalls, we were immediately approached by multiple people trying to sit us down at different areas. So here is a tip: walk down the street and ignore them all, look at the stalls and choose the one you like, than take a sit directly in front of it. That way they will know you're their customer. Now the deal is that you order your satay with a different vendor than your beer and your naan bread from yet another one. You pay separately as well - in cash! Now this is not a cheap place to go and have food and is you like clean plates and tables, than don't bother. It is a street food market even though it is widely advertised, you simply will not get the restaurant facilities such as toilet to wash your hands. The food was good, not to spicy and portions were just enough. The good thing is that the vendor will tell you which option (size wise) he recommends so you will not have to waste food. The service is BASIC, so don't expect fireworks (yet again, it is a street food place). If you wanna grab a quick bite on the way home it is not a bed option and you get to experience the local vibe late, when there is not many tourists around. One more thing! Beer is quite expensive and don't expect a pint - comes in smaller size than in UK"
#8,"Based on the reviews we sought out and ate only at stall #8.

There was a short but quickly served line. We just got smothered in cooking smoke the entire time in the queue. Smelled great initially but stuck around in our clothes long after.

We went with the combo order and shared it. We found an empty table, tough that night, and settled in. Periodically a waiter would come by, from one of the other stalls, with menus or food deliveries.

Mutton was the best (moist, flavorful and tender) followed by the shrimp and then chicken. Each of us had our own dipping bowl of mild curry and a scoop of raw white onions and cucumber.

This stall was located on the street outside of Lau Pau Sat but easy to find with its line of customers."
As the name suggests - best satays !,Definitely the best satays in the strip. We always pop in for the chicken and beef satays when in Singapore. Delicious and always friendly service. See you next time !
Don't ever eat at Satay Store #14 and #19 at Lau Pa Sat Market.,Don't ever order from these dishonest guys at satay store #14 and #19 at Lau Pa Sat Street market. I did a takeaway for 20 sticks and asked for more abit more onions. They collected $14 for 20 sticks at $0.70 each but went home to find out they only gave 15 sticks and no onions and cumcubers at all. Only few sticks also want to cheat. So cheapo.
Cool Experience,"Located at Lau Pa Sat center, Best Satay Stall 7 and 8 is definitely a must try. I saught it out heading into Lau Pa Sat and it is actually located outside where all the satay food stalls are. There is no AC so it can get hot and humid so dress appropriately.

We ordered Set A which was 10 skewers of chicken, 10 Beef, and 6 prawns. Just watching all the vendors cook their food over the grill is a cool experience. The prawns were cooked perfectly from the grill. The beef was also nicely cooked. Chicken can be a little dry, but they also give you a sauce to dip the satay in.

Lastly, be sure to bring napkins! Like most hawker centers, they don't supply this. We forgot ours in the hotel room and ended up buying moist wipes from a guy walking around selling napkins/wipes (genius for him since we paid $5 for a pack of 15 wipes lol)"
Herd Followers abound,The satay was nice but really no better than I've had before; tasty but not exceptional. I was disappointed to see them using foam plates and spice containers including single use plastic cups for drinks. The murtabak stand used trays lined with brown paper; a much better alternative
Quick and Delicious,"By far this is the best satay as they claim! $26SGD for 26 satay sticks - Absolute Bargain! - 10 beef, 10 chicken & 6 prawn. Did us nicely. Thanks Best Satay. We will return"
Good satay,"Wife was craving for satay and off I went, drove 10 minutes to lau pa sat for the satay. Many stalls here and I decided to check the ratings on google map. Best satay has one of the higher ratings and I ordered from them.

Their satays were good. Had the chicken and the beef ones. The ketupat was fragrant as well. Texture was fantastic. I asked the auntie for more onion and cucumber and she happily obliged! What great hospitality and I couldn’t thank her enough."
Best Satay in town,"Dropped in last night after seeing so many great reviews and it was well worth the visit.
10 chicken, 10 beef and 6 prawn for $26 washed down with a Tiger whilst sitting on a closed off street lined with satay vendors. An amazing way to experience street food at its best!"
"Great Atmosphere, raw chicken and terrible customer service",The title says it all. We were happy to pay over the odds for a bit of chicken to be sat in a bustling square... but when my partner noticed the skewer she’d been eating was half raw I took it back and said we wanted our money back. They were very rude and we left without an apology.
Food court,"Definitely will recommend anyone going to Singapore, I loved the concept and the food was best and doesn't cost the earth"
Definitely the best satay at Singapore Satay Street,Its nice to see there is a healthy competition amongst several satay stalls. But there is definitely one the best of all: Best Satay at stalls 7&8!
Best Satay number 7&8,"The store is located outdoor with number sign 7&8. If you happen to walk in the Lau pa sat , you will be approached by other food stalls , make sure you are not deter."
Late dinner,Great late night snack . Satay sticks with lamb and prawns . Calamari spicy stir fry. Great service and great atmosphere
Great BBQ experience for little money,"Had big portions of BBQ shrimps/chicken/beef with some side (fried rice/veggies). Delicious, well prepared and fast served. Acceptable price range. Outside seating - can smoke."
Top meal,After being recommended by a friend we were not disappointed. The food was excellent and the service friendly and helpful. I would recommend Best Satay. 7&8 to anyone wishing for an authentic Singaporean satay.
Wow!!!!,"If you go to Singapore you MUST eat at this place. The experience is the most amazing thing ever. You get your satay and maybe some other deliciousness like a rice and of course you order some tiger beer. It’s so delicious, so cheap and so great. Loved it!"
No 7 & 8 are the best satay in Singapore,Whenever we visit Singapore we always include at least one visit to Lau Pau Sat to have satays from Stalls 7 & 8 They are head and shoulders above any other satays The chicken are particularly good There is nothing better than sitting under the stars dipping satays into peanut sauce with a nice cold tiger beer and enjoying the theatre of the satay men
No 7 & 8 are the best,"Satay is a must @ this place. No 7&*8 are best, but all I tried were good !! They also have a large array of other cuisines."
Street Satay,"We ate here purely from the reviews off trip advisor

The food is well cooked you have beer and noodles to accompany the satay chicken lamb and prawns. The food is clean and cooked well with no health problems

But for street food again like everything in Singapore a little pricey but worth a visit"
Outstanding!,"If I recall correctly this was stall number 8,excellent large prawn satays to be enjoyed, also stunning chicken and beef Satay very enjoyable indeed!!"
Best satay is the best!,"This stall is among quite a few satay stalls at Lau Pasak but it is the best and it isn't just because of its name. People ordering from specific satay stalls are supposed to sit at the tables in front of the stall, and when we got there, the tables in front of Best Satay (7 & 8), were all taken while the tables in front of other stalls had empty ones. It took about 5 minutes for us to get a table for the 8 of us.

We ordered the beef, chicken and mutton satay because none of us ate prawns. My husband is vegetarian and some of us only wanted to try satay and have other food, so we ordered food from other stalls at the food court. Vendors actually come by with large menus you can order from then bring the prepared foods to your table. Plenty of vegetarian options available there. So, no worries if any in your party doesn't eat or like satay. And you paid when the food arrived at the table. Prices seemed on par with food court food.

The satay we tried were delicious though! Couldn't quite easily tell the difference between the beef and mutton but both were excellent.

The outdoor food court can get very hot but the evening we went was tolerable. It felt like it was going to rain so maybe that cooled things down a bit. And it wasn't very busy probably because it was Christmas night."
Amazing! Visit 7&8!,"We had the combination and it was awesome. My son loved the beef, daughter the chicken and me the prawns! The charcoal taste is delicious and their satay dipping sauce the best I’ve tried!"
"Best Satay, truly the best!",Had dinner with friends at Lau Pa Sat and tried the satay from stall 7 & 8. The mutton satay was juicy and tender which was a pleasant surprise as in most instances mutton satay tends to be overcooked. It was the first time I had Tiger prawn satay and it certainly did not disappoint as it was fresh and marinated perfectly. The ketupat (Malay rice cakes) was really soft and the sauce was a delicious peanut mix. Will definitely go back for more when around the Raffles Place area. Highly recommend this place for any visitors wanting to try Singapore's local delights.
An absolute favourite,"I love satay and this is the best place I know to eat it. It is of course crowded and noisy and you sit on little plastic stools (which is all part of the experience), but the beef, chicken and prawn satay are all wonderful. Any trip to Singapore without a visit to ‘Best Satay 7 & 8’ at Lau Pa Sat would, for me, be incomplete."
Delicious - a must try!,"We visited Singapore two weeks ago, my boyfriend and I were reluctant to try the street food as we had heard bad reviews however we were SO glad that we took the plunge and tried satay 7&8 (which is run by the same woman). OMG the food was so nice and the staff were nice and helpful and efficient.

We had the chicken, beef and prawn satay and they were delicious!

Thank you to Ainon for looking after us :)"
Truly the best satay,"We came here for satay and it was awesome. The rain poured down as we were waiting and the guy helped us find a table indoors despite it being packed. The satay is definitely best, dont get confused by all the others look for the stalls 7&8 and you have the right ones. The prawn was my favourite."
overrated reviews,"well.. the atmosphere may be great ~ sitting right under the sky (provided with amazing weather conditions) with a huge crowds around you.

Food wise, so so not so fantastic after all. It's overrated for sure ~ prawn weren't fresh and satay were burned most of it as well as not tender juicy kind.

staffs were busy getting more customers eventhough there aren't enough seats available.

overall, it's not a good experience at all ~ sadly."
Best Satay I have ever eaten,"This is by far the best satay I have ever eaten...the chicken and beef is delicious and the prawn was very fresh. A lot of different other good can be ordered and even thought there is no air con, the wind outside will make you feel cool."
"Casual Satay, quick and simply delicious","Stayed at So Sofitel which is next-door so ate there most nights by myself. Inexpensive, tasty and it feels right sitting on stools in a closed-off street in Singapore."
Pathetic Staff with not so great food.,"Best Satay - worst Experience.

Stall 7 and 8

The staff here is so arrogant. If you do not place an large order, your food is delayed. Period. They serve to people who come in large groups and when you ask for the food, they raise their voice and speak.

This is only stall where staff is not patience enough.

Advise: If you still want to go there, have no expectations."
Great Satay and Affordable Prices,BEST SATAY No.7&8. They are actually the best satay at Lau Pa Sat. They are no on inside the building. They start only in the evening when the road is shut and all vendors open their stalls. They serve rice cakes with the Satay and have one of the most flavorsome Prawns satay.
Nathan,What great atmosphere just walking around a hawkers market that the locals go too.Great food and cheap but when we got to best satay stall 6&7 we got great and friendly sevice for $26 we recieved a feast 10 chicken satay 10 beef satays as well as 6 prawn satays. Worth a try.
"Great satay, better experience","If the cheap Satay is not enough to bring you here (something like $14 for 20 pieces) then the atmosphere of sitting outside in fold up tables with 10 other satay stores and 100 people definitely will be! Great experience, great food great value."
Eating in the street,"For an experience of Singapore that is unvarnished and simple, this was great. The meat was tender and tasty, the satay sauce just the right balance of spice and peanut, and the beer came in a big jug.

Friendly service, albeit typically in your face as you walk by, but this is a great rebuttal to all those who complain that Singapore is too regulated and sterile: The way in which a main road is simply shut down in the evening, and metal tables and plastic stools set up so you can eat satay in the middle of the street is refreshingly basic."
"Above average food, long wait, awful experience","The food is OK. Above average I would say. But it was an extremely LONG wait. Customers could opt to sit down to be served or line up at the counter. As a one man band, I opted to line up. But they were receiving an overwhelming number of orders and just couldn’t cope. They decided to prioritise the customers sitting down at the tables instead of people like me who lined up. In the end, I waited for 30-45 mins just to get my food. For the price I paid and the awful experience of waiting for my food, I would have preferred to eat somewhere else. And this was on a Monday night. God knows what happens on a weekend."
Best Satay,"Best Satay I've ever eaten. Delicious and an interesting place to eat some food, right on the street. Awesome"
Great Taste but expensive for a food stall,"This is just outside Lau Pa Sat food court and is operational at night. There are number of stalls all offering halal satay (a big positive). I ordered the one with six sticks (2 chicken, 2 beef and 2 prawn). The prawns were the best and sauce was also great. This is more of self service kindda place where drinks can be ordered separately from couple of stalls on side."
DELICIOUS food and great atmosphere,The bite size chunks of meat on a stick were very tasty as were the sauces that accompanied it. The service was good. The table began out in the street and ended inside due to rain. Only complaint was that I could not get a bottle of Diet Coke (light).
Stall 7 & 8 Mindblowing,"The satay that we had eaten here will be hard to match up for along time to come . It cost us 24 Sgd and you get beef, chicken and prawns ...the sauce that was given with it was finger licking good. We came here after visiting Gardens by the bay ...had to take a cab to reach."
STALL 14 & 19 SATAY LAU PA SAT,"I am a big fan of Satay, particularly have high expectations on the peanut gravy. The STALL 14 & 19 has met the expectations. The meat is nicely skewed and the meat is
Tender & Juicy. The peanut sauce is mind blowing. The BBQ prawn is fresh and tasty. This is a must to try!"
Has the best satay...obviously,No need to harp on about this well known institution. Amazing chargrilled meat and prawns with a moorish satay sauce - incredible. Done.
Not so tasty satay,"Heard about the satay street and ventured there on our second night and tried a selection from ""Best Satay"" 7 & 8. What a disappointment. Overcooked with poor quality meat with an almost "" fuel"" after taste and the satay sauce was very weak! Walked past a couple of times during our stay and saw uneaten satays left behind so we were obviously not alone on this one!"
Tasty fast food,"I had chicken, beef and prawn skewers and you get a pot of satay to dip in. Best Satay 7 & 8 is the stall to buy from. So tasty I'm a repeat diner!!"
Satay on the Street,"This place is outside Lau Pa Set Hawker centre and at night the street closes and BBQ satay stall abound.
We tried #7 and #8 ""Best Satay"" and it was pretty good and despite the crowds was amazing efficient.
There were 3 choices - Prawn, Chicken and Mutton / Beef (not sure what this is!) and you chose the number of each you want. We had 20 small skewers for $14 which was plenty for 2 people, so a cheap meal. There weren't any vege / salad available so unless you like a meal of meat this is not for you."
outdoor Satay in the middle of the city,"We came here for after-party and had a great time. We were a big group of about 30 people, and the outdoor table was just enough for us. However we had to keep it quiet because there are houses around there"
Worst Satay.,"Possibly the worst satay I have ever had. Dry, poorly marinated and toughest meat. Even the chicken was tough. The prawn Satay smell strange and we couldn’t eat them. At least the Tiger beer was a bit cold. We avoided these Satay for the rest of our stay."
Great post gym protein,"meat meat and more meat! Prawn, chicken and mutton skewers with a side of a few cucumbers. definitely the busiest, and the flavours did not disappoint!"
BEST SATAY!!,"I have been coming to this stall in Lau Pa Sat for years, and the standard of satay is always great and reasonably priced. I highly recommend Best Satay for your visit to Lau Pa Sat, enjoy your satay with a jug of Tiger Beer!"
"In a word, YUMMY!",If you like satay this is not to be missed. Stall 8 is the one we ate at and would definitely visit again. Although busy service is fast and efficient. Once you have ordered your food and paid they put it all together on a tray and then you find a table to sit and eat. There are drink waitresses that come to your table to serve you a nice cold Tiger beer. Wonderful open air dining at an affordable price.
Great street satay,"Delicious, quick, honest - loved the mutton and need satay. The sauce was exactly what you’d expect and it came (obviously) Singapore style with cucumber and fresh onion."
Great Satay!,"Perfectly grilled mouth-watering satay and prawns, value for money. Return a week later to take away 40 prawns at $2 a piece for a party and everyone enjoyed it."
Best Satay stall #7 or #8,"Have eaten here several times and have always found the quality of the food to be excellent, will come back again!"
Great satay with the best peanut gravy.,"Store No.7 stand out in serving a very tender and chewy chicken satay. The peanut gravy is wonderfully prepared. The katumpat(rice), sliced cucumber and fresh onion rings are excellent when dip in the peanut gravy. Just that this is an open space eating place without the comfort of indoor air con might be a bit of discomfort for some."
Best satay I've ever eaten in Singapore,"This stall, number 7 & 8 has the best satay I've ever eaten in Singapore and Malaysia. The meat was so tender and fresh. The chicken uses breast meat, instead of the usual thigh meat, which is usually slimy.
Absolutely loved the delicious and mouth watering chicken and mutton satay!
As for the prawns, it was very delightful and pleasant as well, they used tiger prawns and it costs only $2 per stick! What a bargain! Especially with the heavenly taste and amount of meat you get per stick. On top of that, the shell is peeled on the stick! It has never been easier to eat prawn satays.
And not to forget, the heavenly peanut sauce with compliments the satays very well. It has a slight spice to it, which really makes the satay sauce from this stall to stand out from the rest. If you want the best satay in Singapore or Malaysia, better get it from here! It's simply the best!"
Super Satay!,"Having read about this market we ventured to try it out. When we arrived the aroma from the cooking satays lifted the taste buds to a higher level. We enjoyed chicken and duck satays (20) which were cooked to perfection. The sauce was perfect and added a bit of zing to the meat.
We enjoyed this meal with two beers and the total cost was a modest S$24 -- you can't beat that!
Highly recommended."
Really Good Satay,Best Satay food joint is located in Lau Pa Sat. The setting on the street is quiet authentic with fires burning and various satays being cooked. We had prawn satays and they were pretty good. Nice place to go or dinner at night.
It really is the Best Satay!,"The name says it all! Some of the best satay we have ever had. Not the cheapest of street foods but definitely worth a visit. We had the chicken, beef and prawn and it was really good. Their peanut sauce was very good."
Lau pau sat hawker Centre,Awesome authentic Singaporean hawker Centre. Satay and fresh Naan bread was amazing. Cheap and good food
Best Satay? More of Tourist Best then authentic best.,"Back in Singapore as tourist, was looking forward for some great food. After googling found Best Satay Lau Pa Sat stall 7&8 with raving reviews. The buzzing street & flames looks great & felt Yes that is satay. but was disappointed with the taste when served with a sweet version of satay source, lack of authentic spice & heat, coupled with sweet satay sticks. The lack of contrasting flavours, was utterly disappointed, when spoken to the owner, she said is to cater for tourist taste. Honestly if visiting a country for their local bwest food & got a tourist version of 'local food', then there is no longer a need to travel across the ocean in hope to have the what used to be great satay!"
Delicious satay!,"Absolutely delicious satay! We had a mix of chicken & prawn which we're both great and loved the satay sauce. Really worth a visit, surreal restaurant, your sat on plastic pop up chairs and tables in the middle of the city with huge sky scrapers around you! Very reasonably priced!"
Great Satay,"Right outside our hotel, blocked off street and satay stalls as far as the eye can see.
Sat down with these guys and was not disappointed. 60 satay sticks for $42 dollars paired with a Cold tiger.. awesome.
Service isn't overly friendly but the food is great and arrives quickly.
Great spot and we will return."
Staff should have better service,"The Satay is the best in Lau Pa Sat, but the staff is impolite, the service should be improved. There are chicken, beef and sheep Satay, I like the chicken the most since it is juicy, tourists can order shrimp here"
Best Satay is right.,On the side of the famous Lau Pa Sat. This hawker stand is deservedly call Best Satay. Great really tasty.
Great value satay.,"We had our satay in a little side street ( closed off to traffic from 7.00 pm ) beside Lau Pa Sat. It was very well priced and the service was slick. 10 sticks each of mutton,beef and chicken and 6 of prawns for S$26. Atmosphere was fun and the Tiger girls running around selling handles and jugs of cold beer. Don't sit beside the cooking area as you will come away smelling like a satay stick !!! Sit further in and they will deliver to you and don't worry about getting your change it will come right back to you.
If you go ENJOY."
Satay heaven,'Satay Street' was right next to our hotel. The food is excellent but not inexpensive. The tables and chairs are somewhat old a bit grotty and cleaning them is not a priority. But the satays are simply superb. cheaper during the day than the evening. But the night experience has plenty of atmosphere as the smoke from the grills wafts over the crowd.
Lau Pa Sat photos,"I have written a review and uploaded photo's, but they didn't save so here they are again. Lau Pa Sat was excellent - see my other review."
Best Satay 7 & 8 - Great food but rude manager,"We ate at Best Satay 7 & 8 tonight. We got the chicken, prawn, and beef satay for $26. The food was great, but when I paid the waitress she didn't return with my change. I paid $51, so should have received $25 change.
After asking for our change and nothing happening we spoke to the manager. She just started yelling at us! She questioned whether we had in fact paid at all. After being told off for a long time, our $25 was finally returned. Unfortunately, my opinion of this place was already damaged by then. I have no idea whether it was an honest mistake by our waitress, or if she stole the money.
Please try one of the other stalls instead."
Sataylicious !,"A wonderful setting. Best to go in the evening when the road is closed and converts to an open air street food cafe. Ordered a combination of chicken and mutton Satays and they were delicious. Later saw the prawn ones which looked quite inviting. Supposed to be the best satays in town in a wonderful heritage location. Incidentally ""lau pa sat"" means old market - pa sat derived from pa sar in Malay or bazaar in Hindi / Urdu."
Best satay Number 6,I love their satay .. I tried others but I love this stall.... Is the best. my Favourite. The servers from this stall are also friendly and cheerful.
"Best Satay by name, best satay by reputation","Located on Boon Tat Street. Very tasty satay!! Comes in chicken, beef, mutton or prawn. Our favourite was the chicken, we went back for seconds and even thirds. The owner Ainon was very friendly and welcoming and very lovely to chat to. Would recommend this satay place out of any in Singapore. Has won some very deserving awards. Will definitely be back next time we visit Singapore."
Best. Satay. Ever.,"First visit to Lau Pa Sat, and can't believe I have been missing out on the most amazing Satay all this time!! When you arrive on Satay street, it's really busy. The stall holders all try and get you to buy from them - to be honest i was a bit taken a back by the experience initially as it's not something you regularly encounter in Singapore. That being said, it wasn't unpleasant and certainly wouldn't put me off going back. Some how we settled for a Best Satay and it was amazing. You sit down, tell the chap your order off the menu. We opted for a small (you can choose small, medium, large etc) which consisted of 15 chicken, 15 beef and 6 prawn which we swapped for chicken. They cook it, deliver it then you pay. We paid Sg$21 and it also came with 3 bowls of sauce. My only regret is that I had to share!"
Indeed best Satay,"How simple can it be? Eating in the street (that closes to traffic at night), just outside the Lau Pa Sat (or Telok Ayer Market), this simple food that is so tasty due to the seasoning, to how is marinated and how is grilled. I had the mix of prawns, beef and chicken and was so satisfied, but didn't resist for an extra 10 of chicken. The drinks are ordered to another stand that is always passing by the tables. Singapore prices."
Great street food attraction,"Located on the street between food court and Sofitel- packed. Lots of tourists, but also locals. Shrimps more expensive than beef/lamb/chicken. A little bit messy- you will not necessarily get beer before food. Anyhow, worth the experience."
Satay Galore in Singapore,"At the Lau Pa Sat alfresco area, you will find mostly satay stalls by the numbers burning sticks & sticks of satay for the big crowd of diners there. Competition is stiff and it is good for the diners who could have a choice of ordering from the different stalls. The satay sold are made of chicken, mutton, beef, big prawns and some other meats that have been added to the original satay. It is always advised to order from the stalls or kiosks themselves than ordering from their runners who are everywhere in the dining area promoting their food.

With so many diners eating satay, which starts after sunset, Lau Pa Sat has come to be known as a Satay Centre in Singapore."
"""Best Satay"" says itall","Our taxi driver dropped us off on the corner of the food market, on his recommendation.

We decided to walk around first to see what we liked, it was busy and every stall asks you to look at their menu, but didn't hassle us which was a nice change!

finally we decided on going back outside to Best Satay as it had the nicest option for us.

We enjoyed our meal and beers, nothing fancy, just satay meats.Lovely!"
Simply amazing...,...A street dedicated to Satay! I love always already the smell of the charcoal when you are approaching and then you have to decide between all the stalls... Tipp: Try them all ;)
Singapore time institution,"I've been coming to Singapore regularly and always visit Best Satay 7&8 at Lau Pa Sat on my first night to get a reminder of what this city is about.
Yes it's a bit of a tourist trap but the prices are okay the food is good and the beer is cold. And the buzz of the on street tables reminds you of what makes this city such a great food destination.
Augment with extras from inside the adjacent hawker market if you can't face a pure meat and beer rush. The Japanese stall just inside is recommended as are the roti prata.
You just have to do this at least one (every 3 months)."
Amazing satay,"Perfect street food, what more do you want? Lau Pa Sat is a great place to bring visitors as well. Highly recommend."
"Overrated, poor value","These stalls are a tourist trap. Satay are only OK, beef quite good, chicken and prawn dry and overcooked. No rice cakes served and bland sauce. Guys, you could do better."
Good satay,Felt pressured to sit down & order satay from the people walking around with menus. The satay is very nice & reasonable price.
Best Satay 7 & 8 scores a 10,"After multiple visits to Satay Street over the last 10 years there is no doubt in my mind that Best Satay No 7 & 8 lives up to its name. Consistently offering yummy Satay I always choose the combination with Beef, Chicken & Prawns. Matched with a jug of Beer (Tiger) it is an affordable and delicious way of enjoying some lovely food in a great setting. Not to be missed."
"""Tourist Hot Spot""","It's all about the tourist here... obviously full of tourists the place is a $$$$ grab for the shop owners although there was a few decent meals throughout.
High pressure selling, others trying to sell over the top of me whilst trying to make a deal and felt I was screwed over after agreeing to pay for Singapore Chilli Crab and ending up with plate of sauce with a large head shell (bigger than live one he showed me) a few claws and not much Crab meat anywhere...RIPPED!!!!!!!!
BEST SATAY'S 7 & 8 did great job for us outside on street and do look the best overall, although satay's I wouldn't rate near a 10 out of 10 their service was great and allowed me to go look elsewhere first.
A true experience which was great to see but couldn't say I'd rave on about it.
Prices seemed okay, food about average.
Close to city centre.
Is open late."
Amazing satay 7&8,"The best satay is outdoors at the side of the food court where they cook on open barbecues. Make sure you eat at 7&8 this is the real authentic secret recipie satay where you eat outdoors sharing a platter of succulent meats chicken, pork and langoustine marinated in the satay sauce with extra dip all washed down with a jug of tiger beer.
Beware inside you will find touts asking you to sit and they will bring you food from 7&8 they will bring you food but it's not from 7&8 and you will pay more money, so make sure you are outdoors in front of 7&8 where you can see them cooking."
The Satay was not good,"There are a few stalls there and the one I tried, I think it was #4, was not good. I was approached by the stall workers.
I would suggest trying a stick of satay from each stall to decide which is the better one before settling on one."
Over rated Best Satay Stall 7 & 8!,"I travel to Singapore on a regular basic and never skip my favorite satay.

I must say this trip, the satay were a great disappointment. Firstly, the prawns were cold and so were the chicken. The chicken were not well grilled. I guess they were overly busy and did not pay attention to the quality of the food served.

Next time, I shall try the other stalls instead..."
