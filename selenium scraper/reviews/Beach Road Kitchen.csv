Awesome Buffet!,"This buffet is highly recommended! The choice of food is great and of good quality. The oysters from Japan are the best we have tasted so far! Must try! Ambience was nice, modern decor, new furnishings. Crowd was of manageable size so no long Qs for food. We had the CNY spread with free Yusheng! This shall be our favorite buffet choice !! Parking was good, fees was reasonable. Staff was friendly, chef even made his rounds to ask for feedback which is pretty rare! So overall I give them 5 stars and definitely hghly recommended!!"
Good seafood buffet spread.,"It was a very nice buffet dinner with good seafood variety. The staffs are nice and friendly as well. The downside was the area where they have the seafood and appetiser section is kinda small. Not sure if this is deliberate to maintain the crowd but it sometimes get too crowded. What I like and yet don't like is how they spread the food out throughout the whole restaurant. Good for us to walk around and look at the differen food variety but it is easy to miss out the fruit juice area cause of the spread. Salad variety is also one of the more extensive ones I have seen. For one who doesn't like meat, their galbi has stolen my attention as it taste amazingly good. Would definitely go back again if I am looking for buffet next time."
2023 CNY Dinner,"During our dinner Jun Sheng gave good service and we enjoyed the Yu Sheng dish. The fish by Daniel was very well grilled. I love the duck, it was succulent and juicy and flavorful. The glutinous rice texture was good and delicious. The pastry section never fail us with the Pineapple crumble, sesame cake, chocolate tart, waffle and the Osmamthus jelly texture was just right and not too sweet."
Lovely Dinner During CNY,"Have a lovely Yu Sheng with my family. Chef Jun Sheng was very polite and kind. He gave us a great service when he visited our table and helped us set up the Yu Sheng. Waiters were kind and professional. They cleared the plates regularly and ensured our table was clean.
Food in general was great. Grilled pomfret was delicious and the overall Chinese delicacies by Daniel was excellent. The steam fish fillets was cooked to perfection. the fish were not overcooked and the soy sauce complements the dish with a savory undertone.
Desserts were great as well, with a healthy amount of lunar new year goodies. I like the pineapple crumble. The pineapple had the right amount of sharpness to cut through the sweetness of the dish. The crumble were crunchy and gave a good bite to the dessert."
Breakfast surprise,"This is the all day restaurant of JW Marriott South Beach and a nice surprise. We are having breakfast here for a week. The variety is astounding and they literally have everything, more than most hotels around the world. Service by senior staff very good. Better experience than the hotel front desk itself"

Awesome food paired with awesome hospitality from Chef Daniel,"I wanted to express my heartfelt thanks for the incredible buffet dinner at JW Marriot. The spread was absolutely impressive, with a wide variety of dishes that were all beautifully presented and bursting with flavor.

I would like to take this chance to thank Chef Daniel for the amazing culinary experience you provided at your restaurant last night. From the moment we walked in, the ambiance and decor was impeccable and set the tone for an unforgettable evening.

I was particularly impressed with the attention to detail - each dish was expertly prepared and the flavors were well-balanced and perfectly complementary. From Asian laksa to Western succulent Roast beef, I was really spoilt by choices. The main star of the night was the Boston lobster claws. Dipped it in garlic butter sauce and it is to die for.

But the true highlight for me was the dessert table. The variety of cakes and pastries was simply mouthwatering, and I couldn't resist trying a little bit of everything. The waffles were soft and crispy, Chocolate fondue and soft serve filled up every space in my dessert tummy

Overall, it was an unforgettable dining experience and I cannot thank Chef Daniel enough for his hard work and dedication in creating such a fantastic spread. I will definitely be returning to enjoy his culinary creations in the future."
Misleading and low quality food,"I called to book a day before. I asked twice the reservation if the have boiled whole lobster they said yes. When I visited to my disppointment there is no whole lobster anyway i told the manager and he didnt say anything just sorry. Its terrible service. They should have resolve this issue. I been to many buffets and restuarants, I informed them that the fruits have turned yellow they didnt change and also when there is no more food i have informed them. The quality of the food is horrible like lobster claw there is a quality issue there is no meat just soak with water i think there is some issues with purchasing department because i havent seen such horrible quality food in any restaurant or food court. They should reflect on it."
Outstanding Experience,"My wife and I enjoyed a delicious Festive Brunch on New Year‚Äôs Day at the Beach Road Kitchen. The overall environment, food selection and attentiveness of the staff greatly exceeded our expectations. The good was very fresh with a wide variety and the facility was well organized and very clean. I highly recommend this fine establishment when visiting Singapore."

Thank you for making it a wonderful experience for celebration of family bonding!

Christmas Eve Buffet was terrible,"Dinner buffet was so terrible!
Servers was standing behind you let you feel so uncomfortable and keep clearing the utensil without asking. Like keep rushing us to finish our food. And we didn‚Äôt know that we only can eat until 7.30pm sadly not a great Christmas Eve dinner. Won‚Äôt ever waste my time to go there again. Price was so steep not worth at all."
Amazing Buffet with Well Managed Service,"1. You have an option of going on a weekend at a higher price and a bit more special choices or the lower priced days with still so many GOOD choices. I will opt for the latter as even then the selections are amazing. They really do have a great spread.

2. Why not an excellent review. They do have some dishes that are slow to refill or do not refill unfortunately. So go early."
Christmas eve dinner,"A very good spread, food display and standard is 1st class. A class above the rest. Would strongly encourage all to dine here for all the goodness including Premier service. Will visit again."
Great Experience,"It was a great place to celebrate my wedding anniversary at Beach Road Kitchen, with the nice location, food and service. My only suggestion is to widen the width of the walkway as collision between two person walking passed each other is high, especially when having food on the plate. Also, it would be better if the size of one table, which is for two person, to be slightly bigger as there aren't much spaces left after three plates, two cups and a bowl of ""lemon water"" for washing of hands."
Excellent service and food,Like to complement Chef Kok Ann and his team Ms Almash n Flora who served our table. Their product knowledge and service are great. They made our guests and us feel at home by patiently attending to our requests and suggesting food we might have missed due to so wide a selection of delicious food. It was an unmatched experience as compared to the other 5* hotels. Will definitely return again. BRAVO!
Exceptional Customer Service,"Excellent service received during my lunch with the family . Your service staff at Beach Road Kitchen , Miss Flora displayed exceptional customer service with her team at my table . The young Chinese lady and boy was also very attentive at our table ."

Singapores best brunch,We have tried many Sunday brunches and this is our favourite. The service is always great and again Almash did a great job and made us feel very special. The kids loved the dessert (and we would like to apologise for the 10 cr√®me br√ªl√©es that our youngest ate!). My parents loved the whole grilled fish. Our only advice would be to make it clear what drinks each menu includes especially for non-drinkers as we came once and mocktails were available. Also forgot to say how amazing the chefs were - so happy to recommend dishes - which we really appreciated. Thank you for a lovely start to our Christmas break with my parents!

Greatest lunch buffet ever,"1st time to see a lunch buffet having the same standard of dinner buffet with full arrays of seafood, crab, lobster, oysters and even È∫ªËæ£Â∞èÈæôËôæ. The services are nice, staff are friendly. Almash gave us very good service and made our anniversary memorable."
Mr. Gary Lee,We are surprised of the vast varieties of food spread across the floor n the food was exceptional good compared to some of the top restaurant we visited . The service was excellent esp ms Almash n Nibila with such friendly n sweet smile Kitchen. Try to have some signage esp at the carpark as caused Me some confusion n finding but Overall it‚Äôs a really a good try which I will definitely be back again
Excellent food with exceptional service render by the team!,"We visited this establishment on 8/12/2022 for a friend‚Äôs birthday.
Came in without any expectation as Buffet dinners during Xmas seasons are usually over price and the service is below par. But soon this was about to change.

As we stepped into this well-decorated restaurant, I was immediately welcomed with a warm smile by Ms. Almash. Despite the moment, she was busy with something, she stopped what she was doing and get us a table.

Unlike other Buffet setting restaurants where you will start exploring on your Own, Ms. Almash led us to the table and introduced Aden to us to be the person attending our table. Of course, I thought nothing much of it. But the surprise came later.

The plates were cleared swiftly and water was refilled almost instantaneously without me lifting my hand or signally. What surprised me most was, when I was struggling with the Snow crab, with great initiative, Aden without asking, passed me a pair of crab clipping scissors. This show how attentive the team was trained. Another incident was while I am getting another cup of coffee, a diner behind me accidentally dropped something, the server in charge of the coffee/beer counter immediately requested his teammate to attend to her without even the diner‚Äôs asking.

In the past, I had been training service staff and to get all to work together as one, definitely is not an easy feat.
Looking into these details are not easy to achieved but makes the whole dining experience very enjoyable.

Without great leadership on the ground and managers whom lead by example this will not be possible. Great job for Mr Ali for bringing the team to work together as one and not as individual. What I experience tonight was a strong team spirit wanting to bring great dinning experience to the diners.

In the current market where the product distinction is getting blurry, great service like this will make the difference!

Congratulations to Ali and team! Merry Christmas to you all and Thank you for your excellent service!

Ps : the spread of food are good, and with the special POSB card promo, really worth it!"

Good Spread and Good Value,"Went with my husband and adult son. We visited this restaurant on the eve of National Day. It was not too busy and the ambience of the place was very good for conversation and dining. We had a good table and great service. The location of the tables was central to everything. The food is spread out, so explore everything before you start. For instance the salad bar was tucked away on the other side. And we did not see it until much later. There is a very wide selection of deserts. So save space! I would definitely go back there."

A special thank to Ivan!,"Beach Road Kitchen dinner buffet is probably one of the better (if not best) for its value. Excellent spread and variety, nice atmosphere. We were welcome by friendly host. But the icing of the cake had to be Ivan. His personal attention to guests and sincerity to meet guests' needs are on point. Should look out for him if you drop by, he will make that your dinner ends more than what you expect it to be. A true host who extend services from the heart.

Thank you Ivan for the great hospitality!"

Wonderful dinner on a weekday night,My friend and I have a wonderful buffet dinner at Beach Road Kitchen tonite. The food variety and cooking quality were excellent and deserve a 4+ star rating.
Delicious and wide dinner selection,"Went on a Friday evening for a dinner gathering. Ambience overall was nice. The area where we were seated, beside the grill counter, was quite warm. On the plus point we helped ourselves to more of the tasty grills and had an informative interaction with Chef Tang Jun Sheng. My favorite was the live grilled golden pomfret. They had sea bass once the pomfrets were all taken up. Overall most of the food I had were well executed and tasty. Did not take the oysters and prawns so no comment on those but the other chilled seafood were succulent (lobsters, scallops, snow crab, octopus legs at the sushi counter). Other notable mentions are the salted egg crayfish, grilled short ribs, chilli crab with mantou and truffle pizza.

There was also a create your own noodle station and cooked on the spot by the chef. Laksa broth can be made thicker. Was told it is made from scratch and not pre-made paste. I guess this lighter version is more for non-local taste buds.

Desserts were extensive, from nonya kuehs to cakes, waffles, pies, bread pudding, chocolate fondue, biscuits, gummies and soft serve yoghurt.

Service across the board was excellent. Appreciate all the staff who served us that day."
Good experience,My 3rd visit to Beach Road Kitchen and Almash took my reservation. She was helpful and got us to check if holding specific visa card. We enjoyed our meal and happy to get some discounts
