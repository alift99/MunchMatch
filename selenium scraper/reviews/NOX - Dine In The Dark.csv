Experience the darkness,"I went to Nox with my family and had an absolute fantastic time. Eugene, the manager was so friendly and accommodating. Kyla the hostess was amazing and was so helpful and friendly. My server was Kevin was very funny and served us 12 courses of delicious food. It was truly an experience unlike any other I have ever had. I will definitely come back and try the ever changing menu. This is definitely not to be missed!!"
NOX is an amazing experience and great food!,Kevin did a great job serving us at NOX. The food was great & the experience was wonderful. Will definitely come back and eat here again!
Everyone should try this!,"Visited Nox with my husband and it was an amazing experience! You get to dine in pitch darkness except for some small rings of red lights on the ceiling from ?security cameras and the occasional opening of the door with someone entering, but these hardly affected the experience.

Halimi was our server and he was fantastic! Very cheerful, funny and inspiring, with excellent service having worked at Nox for the past 10 years. He was able to give us clear instructions and answer our queries, and made us feel comfortable.

It was great fun feeling around for cutlery, food and glasses, and guessing what we were eating through the flavours and textures, and then confirming our findings after dinner when you are shown pictures of what you ate, and informed of the main ingredients.

Would recommend that everyone experience this if possible!"
Amazing Experience,"The experience really blew my mind. Dining in the dark was a little frightening at first but our server Bernard gave us great assurance and settled us down comfortably. He guided us clearly where each items were and attended to us whenever we needed help. He was also very humorous so that helped to calm my nerves. The process of guessing our food while eating in the dark was also very novel and a very fun process. Overall really love the experience, more people should come and try it out for themselves, it will be a very memorable experience."
Amazing. Best thing we have done in singapore.,"The most surreal experience I've ever done. When it says dine in the dark, it really is! You can't even see your hand in front of your face. You get 3 courses with 4 bowls on each plate (course) and you have no idea what you are eating until the end. Maybe not the thing if you are an extremely fussy eater but it is a lot of fun & the food was nice. The staff are friendly. Kevin was our waiter and he was great. I would 1000% recommend this to anyone visiting Singapore. Thank you for a fun evening"
"Amazing, out-of-this-world experience!","The service rendered was excellent from the get-go. They were careful about our special diet requirement (halal meat, no pork, no lard, no alcohol) over the phone and in-person when we were at the restaurant.

We were served by Halimi throughout our course. He was witty, knowledgeable, (really) patient and truly inspiring. He shared his life stories with us and I truly felt humbled to have cross paths with him.

I will totally recommend NOX, Halimi and Bernard to everyone I know. =)"
❤️❤️❤️,Had a marvellous time at NOX. Our hosts were Bernard and Halimi and they took such great care of us. It was definitely intimidating in the beginning when we were in total darkness but they reassured us & gave us an unforgettable experience. They were extremely lovely & were super attentive. The guessing element made the experience even more fun. Will definitely be back and thank you to the entire team!! ❤️❤️❤️
Amazing Experience at NOX,"Had such an amazing night at NOX with our hosts Halimi and Bernard! Halimi was so engaging and my friends and I had such a fun time communicating with him throughout the night. Food and drinks were delicious too!

Thanks so much Halimi and Bernard!! You guys really made our night. We’ll be back for more! ❤️"
Definitely an experience,"Came for the experience of dining in total darkness, and boy, was it really an experience. Halimi and Bernard were awesome hosts! They were funny and inspiring, and definitely entertaining. Must come for the experience."
Just a brilliant evening,"We had an absolutely lovely evening with Bernard and Halimi. It was such a pleasure to experience Nox, because it was really not just a dinner, it was a full experience on so many levels. Thank you to Eugene as well for creating a good part of the magic."
A truly amazing dining experience,"We have just returned from a wonderful dinner at Nox. Our family of 5 didn’t know what to expect with our dining in the dark experience, our wonderful host Bernard made us feel comfortable and ensured that we enjoyed every minute of this absolutely unique dining experience. Bernard who is blind shared his story with us whilst serving us wonderful food and wine and at times really making us laugh, he was engaging and truly exhibited his love for his job. I would highly recommend this dining experience and if in Singapore again we will most definitely be visiting Nox."
A-maz-ing!!!!,"What a unique experience!! Incredible customer service from beginning to end. Great cocktails and lots of attention from the concierge crew when you arrive. Bernard and Kevin looked after us so well in the restaurant. Lovely food - expect a tapas style food experience, you won’t be disappointed. Lots of humour and giggles all the way through! Fabulous!!!"
Amazing dining experience!!!!,"My husband brought me here for my 30th birthday and I love every moment of it. The food is amazing and the service.. is IMPECCABLE!!!! Halimi and Bernard were our guides and their service are top notch!! They made us feel at ease and very friendly too! Everything is 10/10, it was indeed a fun, unique and romantic birthday dinner"
Worth a Visit!,A unique dining experience coupled with great service makes NOX a great place to dine and tantalize your senses.
Dinner date at NOX,"As ironic as it might sound, it was an ""eye opening"" experience. The hosts and staff are amazing and had a great sense of humour. The experience was slightly daunting at first, but after getting used to the complete darkness, i actually really enjoyed my time here. Every single dish tasted really amazing, the staff sat us down after the meal to show us what exactly we ate. Our host gave us an insight on how it was like to be visually impaired and how to assist them if any of them were ever in need. I strongly feel this dining experience is an experience that everyone should at least try once in their life time. Props to the service team for their wonderful service, i had a very enjoyable evening."
"Average Food, Outstanding Service, Splendid Beverages",We were there for the NYE dinner set menu. The service was impeccable right from the get-go as we entered the lounge on the first floor. The gentlemen hosting us were attentive and extremely welcoming while those in the bar served up delicious cocktails. Bernard then led us up to the dining hall while Kevin tended to us at our table. Both of them provided us with a very pleasant experience. Randy also tended to us during the second half of the dinner - he definitely has the potential to be great but there’s work to be done. We really liked half of the dishes served while the other half wasn’t very enjoyable. The cocktails and wines paired with the food were excellent.
Fun and fascinating experience for couples,"We loved the selection of dishes for each course and the thought that went into each dish.

The host (Eugene) and waiter (Randy) were really patient and friendly in sharing how the dine in the dark experience works and what to expect to maximise our dining experience. This helped to ease us in at the start.

Would definitely recommend to our friends to visit.

We were slightly disappointed with the lack of tap water available when we requested for it to cleanse our palette after each course and the explanation for why it wasn't available wasn't really clear."
Walking into 2023 eyes closed.,NOX is a must visit at least once in your life. Vision is a gift and NOX brings that to you in a fun package. Kevin served our table and his service exceeded expectations. He was warm and put us in ease in our new environment. 5/5 must try.
Good experience for a couple,"Really new experience. Good and tasty. It's definitely worth for visiting for the foodies. Thanks a lot, especially for the waiters"
Fantastic and Unique experience,My wife and I had the most wonderful experience here at NOX. Randy and Bernard were wonderful hosts and we would highly recommend having a meal enjoying a dine in the dark experience!
Dine in the Dark,"My first Dine in the Dark experience. Total darkness, felt quite helpless in the beginning. Once settled down, enjoyed the food and figured out what I ate. But the portions were pretty small. It was an interesting and amazing experience. Friendly, pleasant and cosy ambience."
Dinner at Nox,Definitely a unique experience that everyone should try... Guessing what we ate after was really fun.
Birthday dinner,"Our hosts, Bernard and Hong Wei were wonderful, warm and hilarious! had a birthday dinner for someone who had never done dining in the dark before. Amazing experience!"
Great experience,"It was really great experience to dine in the dark! Waiters are very professional, and foods are nice! Must try :)"
First Dining Experience at Nox,The overall experience is great! Truly one of a kind experience and the employees were incredibly nice. They showed us the pictures of what we ate and we had fun guessing what was in it. We even had the mocktails on the house before leaving.
NOX is super good!,Love it so much! It’s a super good place to have the birthday here! Will definitely recommend to friends!
An experience to remember,"The pitch black experience created an illuminating heightened of senses. It allowed me and my partner to disconnect and to connect fore the full dinner session.

Service was absolutely spot on, you feel the passion and sincerity from the service crew. Their character and voices encompassed the whole room with positivity. Service was top notch better than the vast majority that I have ever experienced in other restaurants. Bernhard who was taking care of us, thank you for sharing with us your life journey.

Food was great! And they change their menu every w and a half months.

Definitely a must try and we will be back."
First Dine in the Dark Experience,"Best dinning experience ever with amazing food created by the chef! Bernart, our friendly host did a fabulous job with his warm presence and service! Highly recommended!"
"A simply perfect, unforgettable experience!","Finally brought my partner here for his b’day/early X’mas celebration. It was a perfect experience - in pitch darkness, we relied more on our other senses to decipher the food (which was superb), simply enjoyed each other’s company without the distraction of our phones. The visually impaired servers were really the MVPs who made it special - Halimi, Fabian, and especially Bernhard. We loved how Bernhard openly shared his journey, and found him to be such an inspiration. Thank you Nox, we’ll definitely be spreading it to others"
Honeymoon Date in Singapore,"Definitely an experience you can’t say no to. Not only is the food good, the room is complete darkness, but the waiting staff is all visually impaired and would go as far as saying inspirational."
Great experience!,"This was really a good experience, definitely a must try if you haven’t before. My host was Halimi and he was really patient and helpful throughout dinner. Food was okay, but I don’t know what I had. I’m still waiting for the reveal of the food. Anyway a lot of inspirational talks and quotes, hahaha."
Inspiring experience and a feast for the senses!,"An amazing and inspiring visit for us. Our servers, Bernard and Halimi, were friendly, warm and jovial. They worked hard to keep the mood comfortable and to engage with each of us on a personal level. Undoubtedly, my family and I were a tad apprehensive and nervous at the start since we had our sight “taken away” from us. They were there to help us lighten up and to tend to our every needs. The meal was delightful and we had fun trying to figure out what we were eating!

Halimi ended the night for us with a lovely sharing on his story and it was truly inspiring for us. I am so thankful and grateful for this experience."
One of a kind experience,One of a kind experience- we get to experience food in a brand new way without seeing what we are eating. Not even sure whether we have finished it and we need to depend on our other sensory.
Dinner,Great host Randy making sure we are always comfortable. Tasty food without knowing what sre they. Fantastic experience
Our 1st visit to NOX,"This was our 1st experience at NOX. Great service from the door host. Food was great, ambience superb. Our table host was amazingly superb, making a difference to our whole visit. Thank you Halimi for the great service!!"
Some glitches but lovely recovery and sincere service,"It was my first time and not sure what to expect. However the warm and efficient service from greeting to introductions were well taken care of. Ironically during our “blind” experience, there was a mistake and we were served our mains first before the appetizers. Guess there are real challenges working without sight! My partner was later erroneously served the vegetarian appetizer too. It was a hilarious experience nevertheless describing and figuring out what we were supposed to be eating and why our dishes were different! But lovely waiter Halimi provided such sincere lovely recovery, shared with us his personal story of how he lost his sight, doses of optimism and his quotes and mantras he lived by and it turned out to be such a warm and enlighting experience, in more ways than I had expected in addition to a great meal and a full belly"
Awesome experience,"Interesting dining experience, nice food as well! The menu changes changes every 2 months, will definitely be back!"
Great experience!,Very special experience dining without seeing Staff are visually impact They share wit you a life you never live over a course of meal Come and “ see “ for yourself
Could have been better...,This is probably my 3rd or 4th visit to Nox. The standard of the food seems to have fallen short from my past visits.
Unique experience!!,"Dining at Nox was an absolutely unique experience. Was amazed at how nicely the server attends and serves you.
The food was good. And guessing what you are eating made it all the more exciting.
However I felt the portion size could be a little bigger.
But overall a very good and unique experience."
This is a must vist dining experience. It is so much more than just dining!,"What an amazing, humbling, insightful experience. One I have never experienced before!!
What a fantastic concept of how we interact with food, people and our world around us.
You as the name suggests you dine in the dark (pitch black). Dont worry though the hosts will talk and guide you through all the way. Bernard was was our host and ensure we had the most unbelievable experience ever!
Bernard was the most amazing host and we were so humbled after he shared his story.
I won't give too much more away but to say you must must experience this dining."
Fantastic experience,"This was a fantastic experience. The concept is very humbling (the restaurant was created by the owner whose parents are blind). The team is very welcoming and warm. The room is pitch black. It took time for me to adjust to the dark but once there is was wonderful to explore each course which is four servings per course. We were hosted by Bernard, who I would wish to give a special mention, he was attentive, funny and looked after us. Bernard told of his own story of losing his vision and how he is enjoying working in this restaurant. It was amazing to experience a variety of different foods in this way. Would highly recommend."
Unique experience,"We were served by Bernard and he was patient and detailed with where the food and drinks were placed. Bernard is a funny host with a wicked sense of humour, he made the pitch black experience less daunting and very enjoyable. We enjoyed guessing what we were eating! At the end of the meal, the staff will show and tell you what you actually had. Overall, great experience!"
Pitch dark dinner experience,"Excellent, our host were friendly and hilarious when serving us out course. Great fun experience and service. The food was interesting with many textures. Had the cocktail menu. Good good good"
Nox,The dinner at Nox was truly a unique experience and provided us a different perspective and appreciation for our eyesights. The food was amazing and our server Halimi was phenomenal. We will definitely come back and have been recommending this dining experience to all of our friends.
Great experience!,All the staff were very professional and friendly! Instructions were given to make us feel comfortable and an very delicious meal 💖 3 courses but 12 dishes so definitely worth and they will cater to your dietary needs. Thanks for the experience NOX 💖

First nox experience,"The dinner was enjoyable and a fresh experience, staff were polite and good. We were served by Haleemi and he shared with us his Inspiring story"
Dining,Unique dining experience. Helpful service crew guiding us in the dark. Had a great time here. Thank you!
Unique and intimate dining experience,"Brought my husband here for a surprise wedding anniversary gift dinner. Love the fact that we could put away our phones and enjoy each other’s company. Perfect intimate dining experience for date night.

Halimi, our host, was attentive, warm and friendly and made us feel at ease throughout the dining experience. In fact, the service by the entire service crew was impeccable; we could feel their passion and sincerity when interacting with guests.

Food was excellent as well. The fun part was trying to figure out what we tasted, and finding out when it was revealed at the end. Menu changes every 2 months; Would definitely love to come back again!"
Dinner at Nox dine in the dark,"Positive, uplifting experience. Server Halimi and Han Wei made sure we were comfortable and constantly joked with us making it a light happy atmosphere. Kudos to halimi for sharing his life story and always being able to keep his positive outlook to life. HOPE- happiness on planet earth. Well said :)"
Great experience,Highly recommend. Food was fantastic. Staff were welcoming and friendly. A new experience to dine in the dark. More challenging than you would guess!
A unique dining experience!,Love coming with friends. Conversation was fun! Couldn’t see each other so had to chat and eat. So funny eating a meal that you can’t see! Everyone should give it a try.
Yum,"Great service, great service and such a unique experience. So much fun to try all the different foods and finally finding out what we ate. Definitely will recommend!"

Will do this again!,"Had an awesome experience here!

Anniversary,"It is my first time to experience dine in a dark. Great food, treat staff, awesome experience! Must recommend"
Good experience,Nice experience. Food and service is excellent. Our host Bernard is very attentive and entertaining. One for core memory.
One of a kind experience,"The service was amazing and the food was incredibly interesting, as well as the entire experience of dining without sight was a truly interesting one :)"
Great experience,"Bernard and Halimi are really amazing. I am so impressed with their service and Halimi's story of how he picked himself up after losing his sight was very inspiring to me. However, as we are dining in the dark please make sure you have a good conversationalist in your table so that you don't end up sitting in the dark in silence. Definitely an experience that is worth trying."
One of a kind!!,Bernard and Halimi were amazing servers! they provided both laughs and smiles alongside greatly prepared food. I highly recommend a visit. it’s a memorable experience led by wonderful people.
Unique experience,Its was a unique and fantastic experience. The blind host was actually visible in the dark. They can even sense that my hand was not on the table. I get to experience how the blind live in the dark world. Its really not easy.
Go for it!,Great experience and great food. And great service too. Highly recommended for young and old alike. One of the best dinners ever. 😊
An Experience I Would Never Forget,"I had no idea that our host, Halimi, was completely blind. It really took me by surprise. Throughout the entire time, he took care of all 13 of us really well and ensured that we were comfortable.

This made dining in pitch darkness all the more meaningful. There were times I felt helpless and a little dizzy. But listening to Halimi’s story really warmed my heart. The entire dining experience made me treasure my senses more and appreciate the life I have now. I will never forget his parting words to us “Aim for perfection and in the process you will achieve excellence!”

An experience i would not forget!"
NoX Wow,Loved this. What an amazing experience. Some dishes we loved more than others but there are so many you definitely will not go hungry. A big shout out to Bernard. He kept us giggling through the night and even helped us have a slow dance between courses. Many thanks to the chef and all involved in this wonderful experience.
A Must Try Amazing Experience,"Irfan (bartender), Kai (manager) and Halimi (waiter) are some of the most genuine and amazing staff we have ever encountered. The restaurant's food, service and people is world class. I only wish I lived in Singapore to experience this more often."
Unique experience,"Definitely a very unique experience! You can see nothing in the room, only can feel and touch the stuff, and taste the food! Fun to guess what I was eating! Excellent customer service! I will recommend friends to try it out!"
Must Try!,I was kind of skeptical at how the night will Go… but i have to say it was a definitely fun and eye opening experience. Not to mention you leave with a different perspective :) This is a must try :)
Unique and fantastic experience from start to end,"This was an amazing experience that I will recommend to everyone to try at least once! Thank you to the team for creating such a meaningful, impactful and tasty experience!"
Amazing!!,"Had an amazing experience, loved the food and fabulous service from Halimi! A must do, we will be back :)"
Completely can’t see anything lol,Nice food with super special experience 🙈🙈🙈 it’s a nice one to have with your friends or partner.
Ms,Very nice food & very unforgettable experience. Nice staffs & i will recommend my friends to try out.
Amazing food and people!,"The atmosphere, cocktails, wine and food were amazing. The staff are inspiring. Good fun, and made an already great experience, unforgettable."
Immersive & Experiential dining experience!,"If you’re looking to dine at somewhere immersive, artistic and experiential with a team of attentive crew, Nox in the Dark is definitely a place for you.

Food is yummy.
Heard they change their menu every 2months so I look forward to be back.

Both servers Bernard & Halimi are really experienced in pitch black darkness. They kept me calm with clear instructions (I was afraid of the dark) & help me navigate my way around the dining area with ease. They were meticulous too."
A totally different dining experience,"Close your eyes and be led into a pitch black room where you start second-guessing whether your eyes are open or closed.
Food was a blend of enjoyment and curiosity as you wonder what you just put in your mouth. But not to worry, the answers will be revealed at the end of the meal.
The winner here was the service from the staff. Super friendly and patient while they guide you through your “blind” meal.
Definitely an experience that everyone should try at least once!"
Special 2nd anniversary experience,"It was a truly special and memorable experience!
We had an amazing time thanks to Halimi too. He is truly inspiring and we walked out feeling like our lives changed (for the better of course)
We will definitely recommend this to everyone!

THANK YOU NOX! :):)"
Fun family experience,Nice amazing experience. Good service also!! Food was good. My children enjoyed. Get the cocktails pairing. Unique experience in Singapore
Special dining experience!,"Entered the restaurant to a nice cosy lounge where we sat and waited, could order some cocktails as well. However not a wide range of cocktails were available.
We got guided to the main dining area by our server Bernard and he was great. He has a very soothing and assuring voice, and we felt comfortable following his lead to our seat.
It was at first a little uneasy not being able to see, and afraid of bumping things over. But we soon eased into the darkness, and felt our senses heightened to make up for the lack of view.
Bernard also chatted us in between the courses and we were happy that he guided us to feed each other in the dark.
Food were served in an easy manner to be consumed and we had good time guessing what each dish was. We ended up feeling rather full, which is great as we thought it may not be sufficient.
Overall, 10/10 experience here and also a good way to cherish our eyesight and be grateful that we are given that."
Memorable experience! Recommended 100%,"You can count on them to make ur experience a memorable one. They are thoughtful - and Bernard was such a great host who is handsome, eloquent, well spoken & charismatic! Thank you for the memorable experience ✌"
Incredible Experience,"What a blessed place this is. It is a super humbling experience to learn the story of some specially abled people. Halimi, who was our host was amazing. He served us the meal and gave us instructions. He made it super easy for us. The guy is amazing. His story is super motivating.

Must visit. It will be a great experience for you."
Interesting dining experience,Servers were very caring as they have detailed instruction for every course served as we dine in the dark. Food were also pretty nice with a Prosecco on the house for melted dessert served.
Experience Nox,"Interesting experience and very friendly staff, enjoyed the whole dinner! Served by the visually impaired and kudos to them for making everyone feel at ease."
Fun experience,"It was really fun and unique experience. Foods was great, although we ordered cocktails pair but the waiter rushed me to drink up, i really hope I could enjoy more time to enjoy drinking."
Good Dining Experience,The food and service was awesome. Will definitely recommend this to our friends and will definitely be back.
"Wow, overall a great dining experience!!","It was a little overwhelming upon first stepped into the total darkness dining room. But Bernard was very calming, patient & humorous !! managed to settle myself in shortly after. The service upstairs & downstairs are awesome too!! It was nice to put away our phones and smartwatches as well the food was well done too!! Really have to experience it for yrself!"
Unique experience dining in the dark,"12 dishes served over 3 courses and you eat in total darkness. Don’t worry about how is it possible to eat in total darkness, the hosts (who themselves can’t see) will guide you so you don’t fumble. The supervisor Bernard has a great life story to tell. The whole time we’re trying to guess what we were eating which was quite fun. I like how the tastes progress through within each course, tasting the bursts of flavors and different textures. I decided to strike out my dietary preferences and tried everything they had in store and I didn’t regret it. At the end of the dining experience, they’d reveal all the dishes with photos and we had many “ohhhh” and “aha” moments. One dish that surprised me the most was the mussels because I don’t like mussels but I finished that dish! Dining in the dark is a unique, interesting and humbling experience. Best of all, no phones are allowed in the dining room! The price point is just right for the food and overall experience in my opinion."
Unique Experience,"Love the overall experience. The customer service was great. The food was delicious, enjoyed the surprise dishes. Had a great dining experience !"
5/5,"A great experience to try out! Food was tasty and eating in the dark is a unique experience everyone should try, recommended"
Third visit here,"Love everything about this place: the people, the food, the environment, the cocktails. Everything! 10/10 recommend to try dining in the dark at least once - and nowhere else but the place that does it best: NOX - Dine in the Dark"
Perfect!,Everything was excellent from the beginning to the end! Food was sooo good and also the cocktails&mocktails were fantastic! Service was so nice!
Blindingly novel experience,"It's excellent to jus force your visual prejudice and focus on the taste, smell, touch, and hearing. we were served by Halimi and it had been a theme park like experience."
Birthday celebration,Halimi is a very positive and inspiring man! :) Very interesting to hear insightful stories from him
Great experience! Top service!,Would recommend this just for the experience for all. Food was interesting. Service was 10/10. Bernard was an excellent host!
2nd experience,Still as amazing as my first experience in KL NOX Would definitely want to come back again for more experienced
Worth a visit and revisit!,"Very unique dining experience. When sight is taken away, you can only based on your taste and smell senses, it becomes challenging! Server is very attentive and experienced-! Great!"
