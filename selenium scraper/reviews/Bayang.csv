"Plenty choice, quick efficient service from friendly staff","This is one of those places where the staff ask lots of questions and you are actively encouraged to over-order whilst they know that there isn‚Äôt a hope in hell that you are going to be able to eat it all! They tried and I reckon we got it by saying we might order more, which we didn‚Äôt cos we couldn‚Äôt! We didn‚Äôt get our order entirely right though as we had everything that had been deep fat fried (our fault) and whilst it was very good, it wasn‚Äôt exactly healthy!!
Would I recommend this place - yes I would but it‚Äôs very individual, you need to order what you like. Good luck!"
Try the chicken. And the rendang. And...,"This was my first visit to an Indonesian restaurant. It won't be my last. It deserves top marks solely for the grilled chicken platter, as I haven't tasted chicken that good in a long time. The beef rendang is both delicious and plentiful, no stingy portions here.

The staff were very attentive and pleasant too, and the only bad thing I can think of is that there isn't one of these restaurants back home - so I'll just have to return."
This place is awesome!,I am giving it 5 stars because I love their services and I will encourage everyone to go there and check this place out
Great food,Great location with a good atmosphere all around the restaurant. Great food with 2-1 beers all day ü§ôüèº
Satay chicken,Good service and great satay chicken! Needs more characters to submit but that‚Äôs all I need to say!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????????????????????????????
Nice surprise at Clarke Quay,"Delicious food, attentive service, nice people, good atmosphere. Better Satay than in Newton food centre. Price level not totally intolerable. What else can you ask for? Well they did not have Bintang beer but so what..."
Clean and fresh,Lovely restaurant with very friendly staff. Very clean and comfortably air conditioned. Well presented and tasty ffood.
Superb Service,"My friends threw me a surprise party here; food was delicious, staff were very helpful and kind. Good start to try authentic indonesian food. Overall a very pleasant experience here."
"Food is nice, price is a tad higher","Huge price tag for the type of food offered but I have to say that the portion is really big. Food is tasty, especially the Ayam Penyet!"
Miss,Last meal in Singapore and is absolutely amazing if you‚Äôre ever in the city definitely come check out Bayang!!!
Very very good.,Went for a sunday dinner. Staff very busy but quick to seat us and gave good service. Food was very tasty and plentyful. Prices reasonable.
Decent meal,We enjoyed a family meal here by chance. It was lovely and the 2 for 1 drinks drew my husband in. Smaller drinks compared to other places we ventured but the chicken leg and rice dish was yummy perhaps a little oily. My husband enjoyed the seafood mix grill and also enjoyed his meal. Child‚Äôs meal was out quick and also tasty.
A Nice Taste of Indonesia in Clarke Quay,"never easy to find a place in Clarke Quay so much choice Stop by Bayang, enjoyed a nice dinner al fresco on their Terrasse under The Clarke quay roof.. Nice food very efficient service."
bayang,succulent food. Very quick and friendly service. Great atmosphere and amazing waiters. Definitely recommend it.
Worth a visit,"Arrived Friday evening without a reservation. All inside tables, air conditioned, booked so dined outside. Warm evening but a little breeze made it reasonable. Chose beef date, a chicken and a beef main with some beer and excellent mango juice. Service was friendly and efficient as well as fast. Food quality was acceptable, perhaps not great but nice. Not too noisy but our bench seat was a bit too low for the table."
Good!,"Great restaurant and good food,To try!1 year ago i was there but i like all ,and the atmosphere too."
Beautiful restaurant,This restaurant has beautiful food. Great service and good margaritas. It is located in the Clarke quay area and is a great place to people watch and enjoy the atmosphere
Last Supper,This was our last night at Clarke Quay. We had seen this restaurant during the day and decided to have dinner there. It was a typical hot tropical night so we decided to eat indoors. The airman was pleasant without being cold. After drinks we ordered the mixed entree and the whole deep fried fish. The service was quiet but attentive. The starter was a good tasting of Balinese style food and the Fish was excellent. Overall a great experience and a lovely way to finish our holiday.
Delicious Fish,"Our first night in Singapore and we found Bayang. Don‚Äôt let the laminated menus put you off, the crispy whole fish was delicious as was the super smokey BBQ squid. Enjoy."
First local for for family,"Loved it, 11 year old ate chicken rice and gado gado. Will come again. Ordered the tiger bears for two and was exactly what was needed to complement meal. Having stumbled off the plane from Heathrow this was just what we needled."
Best In town,"Best Indonesian Restaurant In town, a Must Visit when Coming to Singapore, Easy Access, Awesome Atmosphere, Great Foods. And of Course BINTANG."
Good Indonesian meal!,Visited here during a short trip to Singapore with friends. Lively atmosphere provided by the surrounding restaurants and bars.
Nice food,"Good food, nice vibe..... ordered food nice and quick and very firendly, would recommend.......overall good"
A little bit of Bali in Singapore,"Just finished our river cruise and chanced upon this fab place. Staff were really attentive and friendly, food was thoroughly enjoyable. Drinks promos really good. If you are ever in Clark Quay please give this place a try."
"Great service, fantastic food",Bayang Indonesian restaurant and bar is well worth the visit . The staff were friendly and helpful. The food was fresh and just magnificent with that hint of spice enough to tantalise the tastebuds. Highly recommended .
Our first balinese in Singapore,"One of the best balinese food i ever had, the clerk is very nice and the portion is so big, we had a feast."
Best satay,Excellent food and service. Great value for money. Be sure to drop in if you are visiting Clarke Quay.
Nice Dinner,Nice atmosphere right at Clarke Quay. Really good Indonesian style food and nice service people. Will come back again ü§ì
Great Food,"Had a late night ‚Äúsnack‚Äù of satay chicken and beef, plus vegetarian spring rolls, best satay we ate in Singapore.
Lovely spacious restaurant, attentive service and reasonably priced. Pleasant ambience, separate from but overlooking the night life on Clarke Quay. Could‚Äôve chosen a table outside also.
Sorry we didn‚Äôt get back there for another meal, would‚Äôve liked to try the rest of the menu!"
Love love this restaurant,"Fabulous service, amazing food. Loved the shared entree platter, mango salad and the roti bread was awesome! Cocktails were yumo! Have been in Singapore for 4 days and this was our fave! Highly recommend."
Good Food,We had lunch in this Indonesian restaurant and could not fault any thing. The service was attentive and pleasant. For the main course we had satay chicken and mixed fish with noodles. Both dishes were very good. Highly recommended.
good food,The level of service and dinning experience at bayang was great. will certainly recommended and visit again with my hubby
Good food & good service,"Enjoyed a good dinner here with my two sons, and found the service very attentive and the food quite good...very traditional indonesian style food and a nice spot to sit and people watch whilst eating.. Fish dishes were great"
very good food,I am not a big fan of Pork.. but I liked the way pork is cooked in balinese.. a friend treated me here....very good service.. and clean.
Fantastic!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience at Bayang -the satay was great, the kids shared the ""spiced"" fries and the hubby and I took advantage of the 1 for 1 drink system.
The staff were delightful and the service was swift.
I am totally happy to come back a second time before we leave to go home."
Delightful waitress made our evening,One of many places to eat at Clarke Quay we chose this by luck. It was cool and quiet inside and our waitress was charming and helpful. Ate the chicken satay and yellow rice combo which was good and reasonably priced.
Not amazed,"Read review online so decided to have a try. However, the food was not that amazing as rated. It's cozy place though."
Great food,Delicious food and big serves. Very reasonable prices and great service. 2 for one drinks and lovely location at Clarke Quay.
Indonesian food reasonably priced,"Satays were tasty, greens were very well cooked and squid was delicious. Found the inclusion of fried stuff in the gado-gado a bit strange. Two for one wine meant a reasonable deal all round for some well prepared food in a great space.

Read the menu carefully for gluten free safety."
Must visit,Went here on my last night in Singapore and the food and service were both very good. Would recommend the squid and satay platter and of course the Singapore Sling.
Really good Balinese cuisine,"Cool, relaxed, laid back - almost a serene oasis of calm in the middle of busy Clarke Quay. They have a few outdoor tables, but they were occupied, so we were seated in the far quieter interior.
The menu features a lot of popular Balinese dishes, but most of them are offered as a set. This may be a little cheaper than √° la carte, but the drawback is that there is often an item included you don't really want.
My partner had a beer, and I ordered a Bali Breeze cocktail, very refreshing and with just the right kick of alcohol. We shared a gado gado salad as a starter. It was nice and full of flavour with quite a few condiments, but it was not really what I expected from a traditional Indonesian gado gado. Maybe a modern twist! My partner had a fried rice satay set which he enjoyed, but again the satay was a little different as far as the condiments were concerned. My rendang with yellow rice was a delight, though. The beef was obviously slow cooked, it was so tender, and the spicing was aromatic as well as hot. Very enjoyable.
Service was extremely pleasant, a little shy maybe, but that could be because their English was a bit hesitant. Our bill came to SGD96 which is not bad in a fairly upmarket restaurant in a trendy and touristy area."
Great tasty food with fast service,"We stopped here last night and had a very enjoyable meal. The service was lightning fast and the food was full of flavour. We had the randang curry, spring rolls, fried wonton and a couple of other main dishes all excellent. Would use them again."
TravelTo bali !,We had a delightful meal with excellence appetizers a roasted fish and social rights plates with excellent service
"Lovely food, good service in the lively Clarke Quay traders market","There are so many food choices on offer, but Bayang tempted us due to their menu and appetisers specials. We were eating early, so service was very quick and attentive. There were 1 for 1 drinks until 9pm. Serving sizes were very generous, we did not leave hungry! We tried the appetiser platter, bbq squid, fried rice with satay, seafood noodles with xo sauce. Everything was served hot and beautifully presented. We did have option for spicy or not, which suited us well. Option to sit inside or out allowing you to soak up the bustling atmosphere of Clarke Quay."
tasty snacks,Bayang offers Indonesian food in a relaxed setting at Clarke Quay. We had several snack size dishes and they didn't disappoint. The satay sticks (chicken and beef) were great with a good peanut sauce. The mixed appetizer plate was very good and the summer rolls were very fresh. Indoor and outdoor seating (its quieter and cooler inside but you miss all the activity such as the belly dancer next door) is available. Prices are quite reasonable for such a touristy area and they have 1 for 1 drink offers until 9 pm. Despite being a Friday night it wasn't busy and there was no rush to get us to finish up.
Worth the Stop for $9 Appetizers!,"Stopped in while at Clark Quay enjoying the atmosphere. The appetizers were good quality and for the price you couldn't go wrong. Chased them down with a cold beer and back to watching the nightly goings on at Clark Quay!

Staff was there when you needed them, but were not pushy to get you in and out quickly."
Good Indonesian-style food,"We stopped here for lunch after a short river cruise from Clark's Quay. The selection of appetizers (satay, squid, giant prawns) was just right for two. It was fairly quiet when we were there (Sunday afternoon), but I can imagine it bustling at night."
A disappointing visit,"This is the second time I have been here and it was very disappointing. The staff were mostly interested in chatting with each other - the customer an inconvenience. Then the order was wrong - not suprsiningy given the lack of attention.
Unfortunately the food itself is equally average - Gado Gado was basically a few cold vegetables and a side order of peanut sauce.
Clearly Clarke Quay is a tourist trap but my suggestion is keep looking around avoid Bayang !"
Tasty and fast food,"Clark quay setting is excellent for people watching and activities before and after dinner. We enjoyed the fresh dipping sauce of the satay and the marinade for the grilled squid was my favorite. Both proteins were cooked to perfection. The service started slow but got much better and the food came out quickly. I think we caught them at the end of a rush, otherwise 5 starts. We would go back"
"Good food, indonesian style, basic seating atmosphere","Wenn went there for dinner. Appetizer selection made out of various small bites was tasty. Gado Gado could have been a little bit more Tastenfeld. But pea nut sauce was excellent. The reasons why i do not Give more points is service and atmosphere. Service was provided by young staff, friendly but not trained and could hardly handle any conversation apart from taking orders. No possibility to Talk about the food nor to alter orders."
Peaceful dinner,A charming little restaurant in the middle of the crowded and noisy Clarke Quay area. You can enjoy Indonesian cuisine dishes in a friendly atmosphere. The food is great and the service is not bad at all. Highly recommended.
Dinner on the run,"Could not fault the service at all, staff very friendly and helpful, both meals were absolutely wonderful and a shame we couldn't eat the last mouthful, will make this place a regular and advise anyone looking for a good feed to go, walked past about 2 hours later and one of the staff recognized my wife and gave her a friendly wave and smile, well done"
Beautiful Indonesian Lunch,We had a lovely lunch at Bayang. The restaurant was clean and comfortable and the service was nice and friendly. The lunch specials were a good option for something smaller and the standard options of Beef Rendang and Fried Chicken were great and came with plenty of sides.
Definitely worth a try in the Clarke Quay district,"There are so many options for eating out at Clarke Quay. We ate here one night while staying at Clarke Quay, ordering the satay dozen (half beef, half chicken), fries with dipping sauces and chicken wings. The service was quick, the food delicious and the two for one beer offer was a nice plus. We did get caught on the ++ pricing (add 17%) which is a sting in the final bill at restaurants in Singapore."
Excellent,Visited Bayang on our last night here having eaten in many of the restaurants in and around Clarke Quay during our week in Singapore and I can assure you the food is fab! We ordered the mango salad & spring rolls to start followed by a surf & turf platter and Ayam penyet set. Wow... amazing flavours and thought for the prices that the savings would be small but no - struggled to eat it all but it was so good I wanted to eat every last bit. Service was very good too - it's a must try if in Clarke Quay!
Ok but a bit overpriced,The food here was ok but lacked a bit in freshness and flavour. If you want good satay then Lau Pa Sat is a great option for flavour and the beer is half the price (although the environment there is not relaxing). The green mango salad lacked in flavour and freshness.
Won't visit again,Below Average Balinese food. Not to my liking. This place is visited by foreigners. Service level is excellent as there aren't a lot of customers in this restaurant.
Nice Night Out,"Quite & good looking restaurant. As vegetarian, It has been hard to find the right place, especially if you look for local cuisine, so the Balinese one has been a good option.
Did not really like my Gado Gado & the Noodles were a bit tasteless, still I had a lovely night out. Thumbs up for the friendly staff that even helped us with our Glass coasters collection! :)"
Enjoy yellow rice with Satey!,"Singapore has all options available, but Bayang was a good place for enjoying Balinese food. The service though is slow, the food non the less is good. Try the yellow rice and chicken Satey."
Dinner with the kids,"There is plenty of choice at Clarke Quay, but not all great for kids (outside of the usual pizza). This place had good food for kids that was not too spicy and a decent variety. The kids had the satay stick and chicken drumlets with a side fries. The adults had curry chicken hot pot and chicken platter, both were tasty and chicken moist. Felt it was a tad expensive as was around $125 (without any alcoholic drinks). Service was good and food came quickly."
Very god food,We had a really good dinner here with the familly. Staff was attendant and service was quick. A bit pricy but food was delicious and you get away from the noisiest part so you can enjoy your food.
Tasty cuisine,The food was tasty. Not really a family style concept where you can order few dishes and share. mainly good for an individual portion. Service was quick and efficient. Happy belly happy me!
Nice meal,"Nice place for Balinese style food. Presentation of food very good, starter platter had a good selection of nibblies. Main meals were very tasty, Nasi Goreng had lots of juicy prawns, hot satay sauce. Mee goreng had lots of flavours, spicy. Icy cold drinks. Restaurant tends to be a bit noisy & tables are set close together."
Just OK,"Limited menu choices and only a passing resemblance to decent Indonesian cuisine. We were hoping to find a rijstafel but were disappointed. Service was hit and miss. Pricey, as is everything on Clarke Quay but this was not good value."
Good choice on a busy restaurant strip,"We had dinner here as a family of 4 and the food and service were all very good. Fried Rice, beef rending and crispy chicken were all delicious. It's off the main strip which is a bit quieter which was nice."
AMAZING,"We ate here late on night after a boat trip - not sure where to eat and stumbled upon Bayang - what a find!.We ate outside,shared vegetable spring rolls/dumpings for starters - light and crispy vegetables.
Main was a bowl of delicious spiced curry,rice,vegetables and two garlic prawns butterflied.
The food was superb,wonderful spices with a bite but sooo tasty - wish I was back there.
BTW Wine or beer was 2 for 1 which we didn't realise until the lovely serving lady kept bringing us the drinks.
Give it a try - really,really tasty meal!"
A great disappointment in many ways,"The food was very disappointing, we have been to Bali nine times and know the cuisine well. The chicken satay was stringy and chewy, the rest of the meal was poorly prepared. The service also was poor, staff lacked interest in their job and we sat with dirty plates uncleared for 30 minutes yet they were not busy.
I certainly would advise you miss this establishment."
Very nice!,"Very nice food and staff at door and the servers were great and very attentive. Only the 'supervisor' seems a little hostile. Asked for a little bit of water for baby's milk, was told off abruptly 'we dont serve water!' For a restaurant that looks so posh and with that pricing and ++ taxes, i guess a supervisor who is more flexible would be an added asset. Besides that we enjoyed our meal and evening."
3.5 stars - good enough Indonesian food but not very good service,"The menu here isn't very big. Basically just a two-page menu. However, food here is nice enough. I had a basket of mixed food items, extra satay, fried egg toufu and spicy noodles. The noodles were a bit too soggy like and not at all spicy. Was told I had to request for it to be obviously spicy. The mixed basket had alot of food items there - some satay, a fried fish, grilled squid. The fish was just alright - a bit dry. The satay was delicious and so was the squid. Yummy. The fried toufu is tasty but the crispy egg bits wasn't alot. Overall food is good enough.
Would be nice if there were more options like beef rendang.
What wasn't good was the service.
The first waitress that served us seemed irritable. Definitely not the service friendliness type. In fact, I became weary when she kept suggesting dishes when there were only 3 of us. Along the way, another waitress served us and she seemed like the boss. No smile at all. When I asked about the noodles she said I had to specially request for it to be spicy, even though the noodles was spicy noodles. Hmm ..
I didn't pay for this meal so not sure how much it costed. If it's reasonably priced, I would come back here again if I have a craving for indonesian food."
Cheshiresupermum,Been to this restaurant twice now. Food is delicious and we have received very quick service. Alcoholic drinks have been 2 for 1 or 1 for 1 as they like to say here. We have enjoyed the platter dishes and you can have non spicy or spicy food. The waitress warned me that dish I ordered was spicy spicy - the beef degan I think it was called. It was spicy and full of flavour but not hot. Or I didn't think so. Well worth a visit sg$ 120 ish for three of us.
Not good and pricy,"Of course you pay for the location, but 52sgd for a coke, noodles, 3 small sate sticks and a small mango salad is too much, considering it wasn't good either. Had a better 5$ indonesian lunch the following day"
Not bad,"I come there for fish. It is good. Giant prawns are also quite ok. Alcoholic drinks are on the expensive site though. Overall, the food in this place is better than in the restaurants along the river."
"Good food, interesting service",The food was good yet each item came out on its own. The happy hour drinks tasted a bit watered down. The service was a little slow to start but then picked up. They gave me the wrong order to start but made it right quickly and food was tasty.
Tiny Portion of Bland Bland and extra Bland,"Overpriced considering how dull the food was, and how little I received. Go elsewhere... you'll be seriously disappointed."
Nice Spot for Indonesian Food,Stopped here for a quick bite in the afternoon that would last us until dinner time. Nice atmosphere and friendly service. Located in an area of Singapore (Clarke Quay) that is loaded with bars & restaurants along the river.
Service letdown,"On approaching this restaurant you see about 3 or 4 staff trying to entice you in but once we were inside, everyone disappeared. Menus were delivered and then we were left to wait and wait - no excuse as we were the only occupied table.
Menu has plenty of variety and meal quality and presentation were terrific.
Could have been a memorable experience if only service was up to par."
Indo restaurant,"Inside Clarke quay this restaurant prepare typical indo food . Service is fast and cordial. As first dish I ordered typical fried noodles with prawn and vegetables, with satay, French fries, egg ....and as dessert ""cendal"" with beans, mais , coconut, ice and a strange green string bean. Really good noodles and satay and really ....particular taste the dessert . Beer promotion : two tiger beer and pay just one....with a bill less than 50sgd.
To be visited."
Rip off,"I suppose in somewhere like Clarke Quay restaurants are always going to focus more on turnover than quality, but even so this was a bit poor. Firstly, the cheapest (SG$45) bottle of wine was not available so we had to go for the next up - SG$60, which is a bit steep. I had satay with was lukewarm, suggesting that rather than being freshly grilled it had just been warmed up. Then my main course came before we'd finished the starters, so I sat and watched it get cold while we waited for my wife's jumbo prawns. These showed up 10-15 mins later; they had obviously been freshly grilled. They were huge and really good - almost like lobster. This would have been a two star review if it hadn't been for the prawns."
Lunch and dinner,"Enjoyed lunch so much we went back for dinner and it was just as good! Great value and staff lovely. Try the baked fish, it was amazing."
Must try Indonesian !!!! Great !!,"This was a first ever visit to a Indonesian Restraunt,we visited at lunchtime and they had a set menu deal on. The food was really tasty, the staff were helpful and efficient. The Restraunt was really clean. What more could you possibly ask for .?"
Good food - noisy location,"Nice looking restaurant in Clarke Quay, selling Indonesian style dishes. Had dinner here one Friday evening and decided to sit outside and enjoy the activity around Clarke Quay.

Food was good, although not cheap and not huge portions. Service was OK - they were certainly very friendly before I sat down, afterwards the service was OK if a little perfunctory.

However, it was very noisy outside, with all of the nearby restaurants and bars trying to out-do each other in the music department. When the Middle Eastern place next door started the belly dancing show in the street, it got even noisier!

Would try it again, but probably not sitting on an outside table."
Very good Balinese cuisine on Clark Quay,"Very good Balinese cuisine on Clark Quay ! Nasi and lasi goreng, satay with very goods Singapore Sling, in the heart of Clark quay and his crowded streets by night."
GREAT INDONESIAN FOOD,If you are wanting Indonesian in Clark Quay this is the place. Great food and prices and fantastic drinks list too.
An indonesian corner inside singapore,"Great food & great value for singapore.. Traditional indonesian food with happy hour on some drinks.. Easy dinner out, on budget, tidy, tasty.. Quite, you can chat.. And have the non smoking option"
"Excellent food, great service & reasonably priced","Called in here for dinner after virtually 24 hrs travel from the UK (after several delayed flights and lost luggage). It was only 50 metres from our hotel, so it was about all we could stagger. As such we were after efficient service & tasty food (after 3 weeks of pub grub).

As regular visitors to Indonesia we were full of hope, but had little expectation. Our hope was met & our expectations exceeded. Food was great - between us we had chicken curry, seafood fried noodles & fried rice with satays.

Service was also prompt & efficient- which gave us a chance to eat& then go back to our hotel & begin to deal with our jet lag!

Importantly the beer was on tap & cold!

Worth trying!"
Delicious,"We enjoyed an impromptu dinner for 2. We feasted on Nasi Goring, a duck dish and a spicy curry one of the spiciest currys I have ever had but very delicious. The Nasi Goring was soo good I have been craving it ever since. The food was fresh and the service was good."
Amazing and scrumptious Balinese cuisine!,"During our recce for a resto to host our girlfriend's Bachelorette Party, our contact at Bayang, Sharon was very attentive and patient in listening to and understanding our needs to design a special menu within a budget. On that visit we ordered the Ice Chendol With Avocado as a tasting sample, but when we asked for the bill, Sharon kindly waived it. This even before we conclude any deal!
On the night itself, Sharon and her staff were very attentive. Although we occasionally made a ruckus during interval for games, the resto was fine with it. The special menu comprising of appetizer, soup, mains and dessert was aesthetically presented. And so delicious and tasty! Each person has her own lovely portion (without digging into a shared dish).
We also got to meet the Head Chef, who is a very friendly jovial chap. Best of all the Bride-To-Be had a fabulous time!
Awesome and amazing resto for Cuisine and Service and Price!!!"
Great Food,"Came here with my best friend bai yun and her boyfriend. We sat inside since none of us were smoking. Our ordered were rendang beef, appetizer platter, fried beef noodle and tahu telor. The food is great. For the cracker (Emping in Indonesia) they served w/ chili sauce. The staffs so friendly. Good ambience."
Exciting food. Excellent service. Indonesian cuisine.,Excellent value. The food was very fresh and tasty. Had a tasting dish with coconut rice. Totally yummy. Definitely recommend. reasonably priced. You can eat for around 20 to 30 Singapore dollars each.
Good Balinese fare.,Enjoyable meal at a reasonable price which is a bonus in its own right in Singapore. Mixed entree platter reccomended.
Worst in Singapore,"Obviously had large party before we were sat. We Mistakenly thought this was because the place was good. We were sat after standing outside for ten minutes then ignored by the staff for the next hour as they moved tables around. After getting their attention we ordered our meals and our drinks arrived. 45mins later after watching another table sit then order and be served, we complained again where our did was. We saw our starters emerge only to be taken back again. My friend is a type one diabetic so I was getting angry at the sheer lack of service and customer focus. Our starters and Mains then hit the table in succession.food was a poor representation of Indonesia and it's cuisine. We will never go back to this restaurant. I do not recommend it. Awful."
Excellent Tasty Food,"Had an excellent meal here,you can eat outside (rather noisy)or inside as we chose to do.Good choice on menu with very reasonable prices. Staff were pleasant and friendly. Would recommend and return."
Would not bother,"Crazy place.

Wrong orders came out. Beers were over-charged. The Nasi was very ordinary although the chicken salad was very fine with wonderful flavours of lime leaf and chilli.

Staff were a la Fawlty Towers. Moving furniture around by scraping tables and chairs the WHOLE time was just not only poor form it was completely out of touch with good manners and good customer management.

To make matters worse the obnoxiously loud and foul language emanating from the speakers of a restaurant/bar several shops away was disgraceful with expletives galore. It not only drowned out the conversation anywhere outside but also in the space where the inside tables were located - it should be outlawed.

Give it a miss."
Great Indonesian,"Very good indonesian food, the nasi goreng was everything my mother-in-law had hoped for. Great location in a bustling street at Clarke Quay just off the river. We sat outside and enjoyed watching the world go by whilst eating very good food."
Not worth the mo ey you pay.,The food is fried and it is soaked with oil. I think the place around klarke mostly for tourist. You can find better quality in other places in the city. Expensive. Will not recommend to arrive. Very noisy .
great Balinese food,"if you come to clarke quai you took the right decision for getting a lot off different cusines and great food.

today we enjoyed first time balinese cuisine. for us a mixture from asian and indian style. we took first the appetizer platter and after this as main course bbq seafood platter.

for us tasted really good! staff very friendly and the food came fast"
Our favourite,"We always enjoy eating here when we come to Singapore. The location suits us, food is good, drinks (especially happy hour ) are fine, service always good and prompt. Prices reasonable for Clarke Quay."
Very nice food but it comes with a price,"I found this place when we strolled around Clarke Quay area. The restaurant is cozy considering the location. The food was pretty good and the people were nice. However, I don't think the quality of the restaurant justified the price. We paid about 110 SGD for 4 persons without alcohol. I know it's Clarke Quay area so everything is overpriced. So would I recommend it? based on the price, probably not. There must be cheaper Indonesian restaurants in Singapore."
Nice food,"Went here with friends. The food is yummy yes, but we found it a little bit pricey. We paid 180sgd for just 1 platter of seafood. But well this is Singapore what do you expect. So far the experienced is ok."
Excellent Indonesia food at reasonable price.,"My wife and I lived in Indonesia for 10 years so love the food and know what is good and is not. This was our second visit and the food was as good the second time around. We had the Gado Gado, which was unique in that it had some tempura kind of veggies as well as the traditional makings of the dish. We also ordered the mixed seafood BBQ which was cooked to perfection and not overcooked which is often the problem. Tiger draft is always buy one get one free. Prices are higher than if you bought in Bali or Jakarta but reasonable for Singapore."
