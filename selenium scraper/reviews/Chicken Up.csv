Chicken up review,"The chicken up website stated that there were buffet ($25) meal but upon arriving, the manager told us that it was discontinued.

I went along with the ala carte because we and my girlfriend had already travelled all the way down.

The attitude from the manager was extreme my bad when I mentioned that I was going to use chope vouchers.
They talked to me with a pair of judgey eyes.

In addition, the unacceptable part was that my soy fried chicken bucket set was actually UNCOOKED.
There was red blood in it when I was eating it halfway."
The food was nice... love. it..,"Love. the food, portion was good enough, a little pricy to me, but guess its worth it. Too bad the Bingsu is not available. Staff are very friend too. But I think they are under staffs, so need a little patient esp during peak hours."
"Very good service by staff, but poor food quality, atmosphere and the pricing wasn't great.","Oil was stale or overused, hence the chicken, which had a good taste and was well marinated, was ruined. The atmosphere is not impressive. However, the staff was very helpful and friendly, especially the restaurant manager."
"Amazing Food, Confusing T&Cs","We booked a 7pm-slot for Chicken Up and wanted to redeem a 5.30pm - 7.30pm voucher at 7pm, when we arrived. The manager told us we weren't allowed to because we were supposed to dine from 5.30pm and that they will be lenient with us and let us use the voucher. However, I emailed chope and they said we could just use it anytime within the stated hours. We had to rush through our meal, and felt bad throughout the meal for having messed up the T&Cs when we were actually right. Please clarify with Chope before approaching a restaurant. Things can get messy."
Big and tasty chicken wings,"Chicken wing buffet is really good and worth it. But servers might be a bit lost, only the senior ones are more familiar with the menu."
Cozy place for me time,"I have always been visiting this place during my me-time, not only because I like their menu, but because they still try to accommodate me even if I have no reservation. But since I already have Chope, it's easier to make a reservation."
Army stew is a scam,Do not ever order army stew there. Costs 25$ for ingredients that maybe only worth 5$. Portion is so little even the noodle is break into half. Extremely disappointing. Chicken wing was good though so order that instead.
Forced to Finish Meal. Very Dissatisfied!!,"I had just recovered from an operation and I figured I'd celebrate by going to Chicken Up. We made our Chope voucher purchase and headed to the restaurant with my bandage and neck brace still fully intact. I got excited and over ordered although my appetite hasn't fully recovered. When we decided to have the left overs wrapped up and taken away, we were told by the staff that it wasn't possible due to the fact that we were using the Chope vouchers. I pleaded my case with the staff but they were not entertaining and stood their ground. I had checked the T&C's of the voucher and nothing was mentioned on taking left overs back and if this was the case, it ought to be explicitly covered. I did not want to waste food because it was unethical, therefore we sat out over a longer duration and chipped away at the leftovers undesirably. I would never return to this restaurant after this experience"
Best Korean chicken outside of Seoul!,We have been here a few times now and the chicken is so good...amazing! So crispy and so flavorful it’s just unbelievable. If you like spicy they have it and if you want to kick it up a notch (or down) just let the waiter know and they will adjust. Love this place!
Staffs are helpful and good service,"The bulgogi fries were tasty with some beef inside. However the chicken we had is a little dry cause got chicken breast. Should have ordered with some sauces. But we ordered this cause the staff recommend its the most popular and crispy. The cheese corn is sweet, had us feeling rather super full. For 2 pax is really filling like the others mention big portions."
Chicken Ups and Downs,"Came here last weekend with a group of friends. We were put upstairs and by the corner near the window. Before we talk food, I have to talk ambience. The air con was lacking and 2 of the ceiling light bulbs aren't working anymore! (Makes it hard to read the menu at night)

Food wise - the army stew is a bit small compared to other army stews in the area but everything else was quite good. I just wish they improve on the ambience and speed of service."
Best Korean fried chicken in Singapore.,This is the best place for Korean fried chicken if u are looking for Korean fried chicken. We will back again.
Casual dinner,"We were the only table that ordered the watermelon saka, where as all other tables on the non aircon side ordered the pineapple. The watermelon option is not strong in alcohol content.

Pancake is yummy. Chicken is acceptable doe not my preference but seafood pot is not great."
Good food,The food was served very fast. The water melon soju can be better. Waiters are frenly and attentive. Good place to hang out
it was ok,"the quality of the chicken has dropped since my last visit, and there is a male server that was a bit rude."
good customer service,"enjoyed the food, and really good customer service. had a nice table, will definitely go again, thanks chicken up"
One of the better ones,"Tried a few fried chicken joints locally and Chicken Up has an authentic taste, very close to what you can get in Korea. Service is swift and the soya sauce chicken is especially tasty. Comfort food."
Fried in the tradition of Korea,"Probably better than some of the fried wings we had in Korea! Other than the wings which come in 3 different sauce, recommend to try the fried onion, fried gizzard (if you dare) and truffle fries. Will definitely be back."
Read if you are the traveler who loving in K-foods,"I’d like share with my experience dining in here yesterday. Especially if you are traveling in Singapore to check with K-foods, please go somewhere taking care of your appetite. We are two who have ordered pineapple soju at S$30 in promotion coming with fried rotus roots free side. Soju cocktail was served with fancy decorated in the real pineapple on dry iced, but the pineapple soju was having weird bitter at the last taste. It was not normal soju cocktail you are expected. Because straight soju is having very bitter taste originally. That’s why K people made it cocktail drinking better. I had tried two sips of the cocktail and stopped of it. My wife did it too. And I ordered two spicy fried chicken with rice ball on side. Rice ball came on the table first, I smelled sour taste from the rice ball, so I thought it was cook with rice and other ingredients by rice vinegar. Told my wife. We ate one and realized the steamd rice was gone. I told a server check the rice ball. The manager apologized with the situation immediately, and he was serving a new rice ball with new steamed rice-probably- that was okay without any sour taste, but the manager did not admit the rice ball was gone. I couldn’t continue to eat anymore all meals while new rice ball was served. Total bill was around S$80 with Soju cocktail, 2 different fried(each 4pcs) chickens and rice ball. If you are Singapore residents, then it’s up to you taking your own risk losing your appetite. However if you are travelers who are missing K-food vibes, this is definitely not your place dining in expected good quality of K style fried chicken as the price range."
Ok but not fantastic,"Their food wasn’t overly nice, they were generally too sweet, which makes you sick of the food rather quickly.

We tried their fried chicken (Yangnyum), Japchae, Chicken with rice cake and Seafood Pancake.

I do like their Fried Chicken, crispy on the skin and tender on the meat. Seafood pancake was the only dish that gave us a tad saltiness to our overall meal.

But it’s still a good place to check out especially you’re looking for places that opens till late at night, because they’re opened till 3am at night."
Free food with patience,"We waited more than 30 minutes for food due to a “printer error” in the kitchen, around 1130pm. We asked after our order a few times when tables that came in after were being served. To compensate, we got a FREE appetizer (pictures below) called “onion bomb” which was awesome, with truffle whipped cream (not mentioned on the menu, except for “yummy sauces”). I could not stop eating this spicy, amazing thing & it certainly made up for all the wait. Also, chicken wings were tasty in the end."
1st time here,"Everything is perfect! Servicing, foods and how the staff explained the promotion they have on that day."
Unworthy,"Bought voucher from Chope in the end cannot be used on promotion. Not worth to buy voucher from Chope coz in house promotion better and save more than you actually bought the voucher from Chope to use only on ala carte food & drinks. Also troublesome to use Chope Voucher, staff still not familiar , took my phone away for few mins juz to solve on using Chope Voucher. I have to go to the cashier to find out wat happen to my phone. As u see phone nowadays is our top privacy ans sensitive thing, they should advise us follow them to cashier instead took my phone away."
good food,"Was OK. Decent chicken. I ordered the deep fried whole chicken. I had this one year ago and was totally blown away by the seasoning, spices, kick. Today, it was simply just OK tasting fried chicken."
Really rigid system which totally ruined our mood,"4 of us went to Chicken up at Tanjong Pagar to celebrate a birthday. As my friend had the Entertainer app, we used one of the promotions in the app - 1 for 1 mega chicken. After finishing our food, we wanted to order some beer to eat with the cake that we brought. As they had a promo for their Suicide tower $38++, we decided to order that. However, one of the staff (let's call him Staff A) came over to tell us that we are not allowed to order this promo as we had already used the promo on the entertainer app. I felt strange because the two promotions are not linked, and there shouldn't be any problem to use these 2 promotions together. Staff A said that the system does not allow them to key 2 promos in one receipt. We understand that and told him to settle our bill first, then open another bill for the beer. He refused. We even told him, what if we walk out and come back in, are you going to turn us away? He said even then they won't allow us to buy the beer. So we decided to go to the bar next door to drink - Dont Tell Mama, which is also owned by them. My friend wasn't sure where the bar was so she asked one of the Chicken Up staff. Instead of giving us an answer, she told my friend ""oh wait ah!"" and just ran back inside the shop to do her stuff n never come back. Apparently, one staff in the shop told us that Staff A has informed all the Chicken Up staff not to let us buy the beer. This whole experience totally ruined our celebration and our mood.I understand you cannot combine promotions. I don't think this is unreasonable. It's not like I'm using discount vouchers to pay for discounted beer. The 1for1 chicken promo on the entertainer app has nothing to do with the beer discount you are offering. What do you mean you cannot key 2 promos on one receipt? If you shop has 1for1 beer at happy hour, and I come in a group of 20 pax, does that mean I'm only allowed to order 1for1 once?? If I had to order 20 beers, isn't that ten promos in one receipt? Or is that not allowed too? We even wanted to walk out and come back in, but they just turned us away. Is this how you do business? You rather let other business earn our money. And what's with the weird staff who just ran away without answering us?I went to Buangkok outlet previously and I purchased Fave vouchers ($50 value voucher for $30). I also order 1for1 beer promo. I used the voucher for food and paid for the beer separately. There was no issue. Tanjong pagar outlet so rigid and ridiculous."
No need to upsize your 7-Up at Chicken Up,"Not refined, but very satisfying. Portions are generous, especially for the ‘mega’ dishes. The UFO platters easily feed 3 people, even starving teenage boys. The watermelon soju drinks come in half a large fruit, for all to dip their straws in. Chicken wings are yummy; the spicy yangnyum ones are extraordinarily messy, but you are given plastic gloves so it’s ok. The lotus fries are very pretty. Friendly, helpful service. Place to go to with a big group of youngsters in a party mood."
UFO time with friends !,"Tried their UFO due to buy 1 get 1 promo! We ordered the squid and spicy chicken.

Squid tastes good however I find the chicken doesn't taste like Korean at all, more like chicken curry!
Both UFO have cheese, rice, egg and corn on the side."
Tasty Korean chicken,"We were there on a Friday night and the place (2-storeys shophouse) was packed. We did not have to wait long (5mins or less) as we were brought upstairs. Here was quieter and brighter.

We ordered half chicken (4pcs of chicken) too much for us adult though. We were given gloves prior to eating. The sauce was tasty as we ordered the non-spicy version, and crispy eaten fresh.

I like my chocolate latte drink which was not overly strong to make me worry that I will be unable to sleep at night due to caffeine.

Jabchae although with some glass noodles inside was not eaten much by the kid as too much veggie.

There were complimentary water.

The whole meal was mid-price.

This brand good to try."
Yum,"We only had the fried chicken wings in soy sauce and the seafood pancake but both were amazing! Soy chicken wings sounds simple but the sauce had a fragrant, semi sweet drizzle that really elevated the wings. The seafood pancake was probably the best I've ever had- crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. And chockful of seafood. Very satisfying."
Great time with chicken and hite!,"Always a good time with family, thanks chicken up for the yummiest soy chicken and cold refreshing hite!"
Belly Up,"I ordered a half chicken- Spicy Yangnyum Up & 4hrs later, I was having diarrhoea, fever, vomiting for 2 days.. doctor believes it's food poisoning from the undercook chicken from the bigger chunks of meat. I'll think twice before ordering a half chicken."
Good food.,Very nice chicken wing. Very nice army stew. Very nice ambience. Very nice staff. I will definitely come back again very very soon
Parkway Parade branch - an okay experience,"We were looking forward to dinner here after reading the reviews and on the recommendation of a family member.

They have interior seating, as well as some tables in the outside walkway within the mall. We ordered the signature bulgogi fries. It was pretty good and had quite a lot of beef, but you need to eat it fast as the fries tend to get soggy.

We also ordered the spice up and the regular chicken. The portions looked adequate in the menu, but I wished the server had warned us, as the two portions were half a chicken each, which proved too much for just the two of us. I preferred the spicy version, though it did numb the tongue a little. The skin was super crispy too.

The deep fried lotus chips we ordered as an appetizer turned up last, and perhaps that was why we did not do the justice. By that time, w3 also had our fill of deep fried food.

The two sodas we ordered were a little diluted, especially for the price.

Overall, it was an okay experience."
Great food,The chicken is fresh n delicious. Must try. Weekend is crowded so must make reservation or go early.
Great place for casual gatherings,"Great venue for casual gatherings. Food was great, especially the chicken. Wasn’t oily at all. Will go again!"
Dinner🤗,One rule we follow when looking for somewhere to eat while on holiday is to look for the busy restaurants. That was how we found chicken up. It was very busy and we decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed. Food was amazing! Service was good. We left very satisfied.
"good food, good ambience",love the fried chicken at chicken up. arrived 30 min early and was able to secure a seat and order a drink earlier. as usual the soya wings are excellent. will come back.
Over rafed,"Went there for dinner, and the food is over rated. It’s not as good as what is reviewed in some of the website and the food is considered at the high side. During our visit, we were given a very small table while there were plenty of empty seats available. Total bill about $85 for 2 of us, with only 2 cup of beer and some dishes. Not really worth it."
Ladies Night Wednesday,"Was there with girlfriends. Food and the watermelon soju was great as usual. For the atmosphere, the music was abit too loud though they did lower the volume after we requested."
Chicken & beer time,Good to go during when it is not meal time and it gets crowded. Food were served promptly and service was good.
1of the best,Big portions of UfO snow and the chicken wings super delicious... and the staffs were friendly.. the place is always packed
nice girls night place,Good food and value.. only that the music is a tad too loud and can hardly hear a conversation......
Yummy,"A wonderful place to try their signature fried chicken dishes. They have various types of chicken bites and wings, as well as various Korean dishes. Ambience was quite cosy."
By far the best fried chicken,The service stuff was very friendly and pay close attention to us if we needed them. That fried chicken is juicy and that sauce that came along with it is amazing. I like the spicy sauce best haha. It's spicy yet bring abit of sweetness
Best Korean Fired Chicken,"Seriously even though there are so many Korean fried chicken chains in Singapore, Chicken Up is one of the BEST here. Delicious recipe, just the right amount of crispy, friendly staff. Don't need anything more!"
Great atmosphere,Portion is cater for 2 and above. A great place to hang out with family and buddies. Service was prompt and staffs are friendly.
Best Korean Fried Chicken,Chicken Up never fails to disappoint when comes to its food variety and quality. Had wanted the cheese tteok-bokki but the staff recommended this UFO squid stew which was so awesome! Had the watermelon soju which is very refreshing. Hope they can bring the pineapple soju back! Fried Chicken Wings - so yummy!
Great place to celebrate birthday and have chicken,Our candles from Henri Chap were used for other table 😭Overly priced food items. Kimchi fries are bad. Overall Slightly spicy yet shiok. Perfect place to treat your enemies for chicken. Good culture to see staff celebrate the birthday for each tables involved.
Good place to chill!,"Good place to hang out with friends! The seafood pancake is really good !! Chicken wings are big , juicy and delicious...very worth the price!"
Chicken Up (Tanjong Pagar),"The atmosphere was quite terrible as they used yellow lights which made the restaurant looked like haunted house. The menu was unique but messy and the the food there was very expensive and poor. Overall, not worth it!"
Superb food,We went there after work around 1am to drink and was satisfied with the food. Hahaha!!! Never expected that. Staff were friendly and cery helpful and food was superb.
Exceptional chichen,"Chicken Up remains at the forefront to a modern approach to Korean cuisine. Due to its double-fried, Korean fried chicken. The brand has been labelled as Singapore’s #1 Korean Fried Chicken. We ordered, the dry Spicy Up (the spice is in the batter, not the sauce it's coated with, the Yangnyum (fried chicken slathered with a signature sweet and spicy sauce and topped with sesame seeds,
the Ganjang deep-fried chicken wings non-spicy but delightfully umami special soya sauce blend. All were finger licking good. The restaurant was quite busy and noisy at the time. But overall nice atmosphere, and nice food .The waiters and staff was fantastic, they presented flawless service, friendly and professional. The attentiveness and enthusiasm of the service made for an enjoyable, evening. Great place for a real Korean cuisine."
Meh chicken,"This is a great place for group gathering, but am not a big fan of their chicken. However their appetizers, soups, noodles are still quite good."
Unique take on friend chicken,Pretty cool Korean Chicken place - unique menu items that are super tasty. Fast and friendly service.
Good Chicken and Beer,"A little claustrophobic when it is packed. Best to make a reservation if you come in a bigger group. Situation could be worse if you are seated next to some Korean men drinking beers and complaining about the day's woes... But that's how it is, we have seen that in many K dramas...
But to be fair, the food dishes were the closest to the authentic ones back in Korea and they taste good. Service was attentive too. You could see that everyone was busy but they tried their best to attend to you as soon as they could, with a tired face, but that could be emphatised.
Afterwhich we went back a few more times and thought we ought to give it a thumbs up well deserved.
Keep up the good work on the front and back in the kitchen."
UFO SPICY CHICKEN STEW FOR THE WIN!,They are too brilliant to combine the spicy chicken stew with other yummy side dishes! Thank you chicken Up Tanjong pagar for introducing this dish to us! My family and I will definitely go back and try the other UFO platters!
Highly Overrated Korean Fried Chicken,"Chicken Up used to be some sort of an institution for Korean fried chicken, but their standards had dipped drastically over time. Their spicy wings aren't spicy, everything is generally over-sauced, and the rice/noodle dishes are simply lackluster. With the number of (excellent) Korean restaurants in the vicinity, it's not hard to get how their popularity had faded."
Great Service! Keep it up!,"Chicken was awesome, service was prompt & friendly and they are super attentive, helping to top up soup for our army stew when they notice our pot was running a low! I love it! Will be back!"
GREAT STUFF,"Simply love the chicken, onion dish (can't remember the name) and the watermelon soju. Welcoming service was great with real, attractive korean greetings. The place is easy to find and the restaurant is cosy and nicely setup. I will recommend this place for group gatherings!"
Good chicken wings!,"The chicken wings are nicely made! Really enjoy them. Pricing wise on other menu is a little more expensive, but is good for gathering!"
Spicy fried chicken and beer - what's not to live,"Great food. Friendly staff. Went for a team dinner, surprisingly there were a couple of vegetarian dishes to keep the vegetarians happy."
Amazing Korean Fried Chicken,"Chicken Up is one of my go to places for Korean Fried Chicken. I'm especially a fan of their spicy wings. Their other dishes are pretty good as well, would recommend their ddeokbokki.

Took one star away cause though I enjoyed the food, my mouth and throat felt dry after eating here. Small price to pay for the delicious food though. Price is reasonable for their quality of food."
Good for group gatherings.,Portions are good for sharing. Flavoured soju is a favourite. Go in groups in order to enjoy more variety from the menu.
Great that we tried!!,"Food is nice, served hot. Service is good and prompt. Only bad thing is restaurant too warm, we are sweating throughout the whole dinner."
Delicious fried chicken!,"Consistently good food, with great service staff at the Tanjong Pagar branch. We were using Chope vouchers, and although we forgot to bring the printed voucher, the staff were very helpful and assisted us in making the redemption through our phone.

Food wise, crispy wings with tasty sauces/seasonings, great when paired with the Korean beer they sell. The wings were very meaty and huge too, unlike chicken wings you get at other fried chicken places. Awesome experience as always."
Good food and service,"Good food and service and its a great place for friends and gathering. Chicken is good, drinks is good and service is good."
Delicious food,Love the kickass chicken and the fried onion dish. The restaurant is abit too dim for dinner though.
Good Korean Chicken,Good tasting korean chicken - though the chicken was abit overcook the taste made up for it. Will visit again!
great chicken,the eat all you can is really worth while if you can eat alot and drink alot beer! delicious wings!!
Good locations,"Always go to chicken up is simply because its conveniently located in big shopping malls. For the taste itself, nice chicken wings but just too bad , they don't have salted eggs flavour."
Not much to eat for solo person. Quite expensive. Modest portions only.,"Was hungry. Was late. Nothing much else to eat. Settled for this joint. Wanted fried chicken.
But was disappointed that they did not have chicken portions for one. All the chicken dishes were for sharing. Min.2 persons. Too much for 1.
Quite disappointed.
Settled for spicy dry noodles with popcorn chicken. Menu price $10. $10.70 with GST.
Turned out to be a packet of Korean instant noodles laced with spicy sauce, only two meager pieces of fried chicken pieces (looks like straight from the frozen packet you can get at a supermarket -- disappointing thought it would be made in house since it's a chicken joint) the noodles were really spicy and fiery despite ordering a less spicy version.
No service charge, so that's not so bad. Service was so so anyway. Don't expect much.
Fried Chicken items aren't cheap. 4 pieces of chicken wings for $12. Wow. $3 a piece!!
Half a chicken was $20.
Other items like noodles from $10-15. Rice dishes $15 up. There's speciality fries like kimchi or bulgogi fries $18, truffle fries $8. Not cheap. Portions only look modest. Not so value for money.
Would I be back? Only if I'm super hungry and have no other choice.
Better to go to KFC for chicken!"
Decent food,"Great food, love their Kimchi pancake and boneless chicken which was done to perfection! We ordered the watermelon soju which tasted good but it's overpriced imho... still a great place to hang out with friends!"
Excellent,Excellent. I had a great time with my friends. Food is good as always. Service is very good as well.
Nice wings,"The chicken wings were very tasty, but the service wasn't that good, other customers were served with ice water, but ours didn't have. The place was pretty dark too, it's bad for the eyesight."
Watermelon soju!,There was a promotion for free watermelon soju with $50 food purchase. Awesome deal. Service was not bad.. Would go again
Yummy chickens,Even better bulgogi beef fries. Noisy if up for a proper chat otherwise a good way to spend an evening with friends!
Fantastic,"Good ambience and the staff are very friendly, the food is great and we love korean kansahamida we will be back"
Will Give This Chicken A MISS,"Waited 20 minutes for my chicken wings which are just TOO SALTY for the local taste.
The Smoothie was a complete waste of money and the pork dishes are no where close to what we eat in Seoul, Korea.
Pricey for a simple location and set up.
Won't be back for more!."
Severely Overpriced & Overhyped,"One-time experience at Chicken Up Tanjong Pagar, but such a letdown! Went for dinner hoping to get a nice amount of fried chicken that (more or less) has been hyped on social media etc. Arrived at 5.15pm when they open for the dinner crowd and was greeted with a bewildering EDM competition on who can blast the loudest noise on the street, had to tell the staff to turn it down as I want to have a normal civil conversation with my friend and enjoy the nice vibe. Obviously that was a mistake, sitting outside and having to shout at each other as if we were in some cheesy nightclub. Had to move inside and was still pretty loud and utterly annoying to have to raise my voice while wanting to eat, who does that?! Ordered the soy chicken wings and was expecting at least 5pcs given the price of it, but only had 3. Ordered the sweet&sour chicken and was expecting some redeeming flavour in the dish, but no. Ordered the kimchi fries and frankly, could not tell it apart from the one at 4Fingers. Forget about it, just get your chicken fix from 4Fingers or even Texas Chicken (!!!) and save yourself the sore throat, headache, financial setback and entitled disappoint."
Good ambience.,The best outlet among all other chicken up outlet. A good chill out place and open till late night..
Tasty chicken in different ways...,"Must try the soya fried chicken, The chicken stew., the bougogi fries.. And the spicy octopus... The watermelon soju is cooling. To end the evening. You must try the melon ice-cream..."
Dinner at Chicken-Up (Tanjong Pagar),The food was awesome. We really love the soy chicken. It was tender and delicious! The service staff was very friendly and ensured that we were enjoyed our time dining in Chicken Up. Thank you! Will definitely come back again!
Wrong order & bad service,"I would like to feedback on the Tanjong pagar chicken up outlet. I was dining with my husband on a Friday night of Nov and our order was taken by a Korean lady. She took our order wrongly. We only ordered the soy chicken wings & sweet spicy half chicken. But in the end we realized another fried half chicken was served.

In the first place, their service was very slow. We realized the order was wrong only when the food was served. So we told another waitress that the order was wrong and we need to cancel 1 dish as we cannot finish 3 dishes. Her ""can't be bothered"" reply was they already keyed in the order & cannot be cancelled even though we have not touched our dish yet. She told us the only way for us is to take away if cannot finish. What kind of solution is that?

In the first place, the Korean lady did not repeat our order after taking it down. If wrong order was taken, they should admit it & cancel for us and not force us to finish it. We were very disappointed with their service. How can they expect 2 of us to finish 3 plates of chickens!? Their service was unacceptable."
Freshly fried and really crispy chicken,Crispy Up and Spicy Up are our favorites at Chicken zip as they are really nice and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. This is the original Chicken Up outlet and I still prefer coming here than going to the other branches. I find that the chicken here is still a lot nicer. And they serve complimentary drinking water (which is standard for all authentic Korean joints) whereas the Orchard Centerpoint one charges for mineral water.
First visit!,"First visit to Chicken Up. Service was prompt and good, and good that there is indoor, alfresco and outdoor seating - provides a range of seating options to choose from!"
Visit after one Year,"I visited Tanjong Pagar branch one year ago and this is a re-visit. The taste for the ""Spices up"" have change. Use to have Korean music, now become western hip hop. The concept is neither here nor there. Food, Music, Atmosphere are all different. The little magic touch this place used to have, are gone. Maybe it expand too fast that have quality control Issue. I would not pay this sort of price for the fried chicken.

There used to be a friendly Korean lady asking us on the quality of the food and chat with us, the customer. But I didn't see her today, I would have feed back to her on the changes of the place. This place look cold. Diner beware."
First time,"Good host "" Emil"" made our day for doing the introduction of "" army soup"" which we truly truly enjoy. Good dinning experience . Will come again !"
Costly but it a trend.,"Have supper on weekend.Jam pack with night crawlers.The spicy chicken wings too sticky wet.Noodle more like packet korean instant noodle brought fr.self.Watermelon sojo,over priced..taste -mmm melon juice. Parking is a problem here,even lots of parking lot behind."
good food,watermelon soju was really suitable for summer. Just that the light is a bit dim. The service was excellent.
Great chicken dishes,The fried chicken were not as good as the past. Meat is a little hard and not as tender as the past. Service was okay. It's strange that they do not allow booking of more than 2 person using the chope app so I have to indicate under remarks.
First timer,"Good food, Bulgogi fries (excellent), watermelon soju (awesome) and staff were friendly. They even have San Miguel Beer on happy hour. Food a bit pricey but it's good for two. Will definitely comeback."
Dinner at chicken up,"The experience was horrible. Poor customer service. Service stag is inattentive and we have to repeat our drinks order few times for them to serve us. The quality and portion of food is miserable and pathetic. Almost all the processed food used for the hot pot.
Chicken wings still ok but a bit too sweet. Overall poor experience and not value for money judging from the quality and serving.

Worse the staff got the cheek to ask us to visit their Facebook to give review. We were reluctance to do so but he insisted we access to Facebook account to give our review before we left the place.
Worse korean Food we ever had. Kids generally have low standard when comes to food. Imagine their comments about chicken up is lousy... how bad u can imagine"
Snack time!,Visited the Buangkok outlet at around tea time. We only ordered 4 pieces of Soya chicken wings and coke to go with the chicken. It was shiokness! Love the salty taste of the soyu chicken. The chicken wings were soaked in soyu sauce and we had to drink water to curb the saltiness. There are some promotions now too. Help them write a review on Facebook and you can receive some vouchers.
Chicken Up never disappoints!,"Bulgogi fries was as usual pretty good, apart from the soy fried chicken. Visited the new outlet at orchard centrepoint and tried the fried squid dish which was really delicious. Good for sharing among 4 persons!"
fun,"although this is a late review, my friends and i love to come back here during friday night! we love everything here. the staff and especially the food! on days we cannot come, i would order for a delivery. My gf really liked the Soya flavoured chicken ."
"Food was ok, place was extremely noisy and hot","Visited the Tanjong Pagar Outlet
Was given a table on the second level.
Food came very promptly and service was good. However, half way through out meals, we felt short of breath and we were all perspiring. That didn't make the dinner very enjoyable. Besides the temperature, the noise level is like being in the night club where you have to be shouting at each other in order to hear what the other person is saying to you. Therefore, if you are looking to have a nice dinner so you can chit chat with your friends, you have got to give this place a miss. We were out of there as quickly as we can and head to a ice cream place to cool down."
Food was okay but overpriced,"Place was abit too hard. Service was good, took initiative to help us take a group photo. Took the time to explain and asked for our feedback"
Good meal to be had,Made reservations with Chope for Tg. Pagar branch and had a great table waiting when we arrived. Service is prompt and food was good. Why good? Everything arrived piping hot and quick too! Servings are sharing portions so great way to explore the menu. Quite authentic to the Seoul snack scene so for a fun meal it a nice place to try.
Great little spot!,"Food was above average. And yes the chicken is fantastic. The soya wing especially. Otherwise a place more for younger clientele. Louder music, and whompin great variety of soju flavored drinks.

If you need to sit, chill, eat some wings and drink your liver out. Great place to be."
Good,Their chicken wings are great! The Kim-chi fries is surprising delicious too! A great place to chill out with friends and family
