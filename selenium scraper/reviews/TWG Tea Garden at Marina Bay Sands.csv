Excellent place,Visited this restaurant for afternoon tea with my partner. Loved every bit of the experience from the tea to the food to the music! Will be back for sure!
Wonderful Afternoon Tea,TWG Tea Salon was wonderful. We had the Parisian Tea for Two with Jade Dragon and Lung Ching Jade teas. Everything was excellent. Service was great and it was very busy and a full restaurant.
TWG Atas Tea Break,"Service was excellent and an expensive tea break, but worth it. Except the muffins was horrible. Long queues doesn't deter us as were on staycation."
Singaporean afternoon tea,"Wow, how exciting it was to try the TWG tea experience after being told it was one of the things to try, and we weren't disappointed.
We were shown to our table and our waiter Julius, was a star. He was extremely polite very friendly and made us feel at ease.
They have a great book of all the teas they have from around the world, which will take a good few minutes to read through.
We decided upon a tea and scone set. Each chose our own tea, which was served with 2 warm scones, clotted cream and their own TWG tea jelly which tasted of strawberry or raspberry, interesting but very enjoyable.
We were asked if it was our first time there and we said yes. We were then presented with an in house pastrie, delicate butter pastry, jam base custard top and then finally finished with a thin cremebrulee.
After our tea and scones we stepped down into the shop and purchased a tin of Weekend in Singapore tea leaves to enjoy at home and relive the memory of tea at TWG's.
Go when you are in Singapore you will not be disappointed."
Place to tea,"We first time had tea here was in 2014! We are visitors to Singapore and come back to tea after 8 years. Everything is so nice and the memory comes back with the scent of the best tea in the world.
Thank to those who make the excellent tea for us and servers for their good service!
TWG, you should be proud of your team!"
Amazing blend of tea,"An amazing place inside Marina Mall and a great ambience and good food aprt from very special tea. We went for afternoon tea and I must admit I being a lover of milk tea, they changed my perception and black tea offered was far better than milk tea and had some of their signature infused aromas."
The details and attentiveness,Superb food and of course the teas. Attentiveness and attention to detail makes you leave feeling celebrated! Thank you
Terrible Lunch Experience,"Went to TWG MBS and decided to try their set lunch. Service was slow despite the place not being crowded ( we went pretty early). We had to wave many times just to try and get someone's attention. Tea for the set lunch was bad ( orange and wood) which i tasted absolutely none of. Mains and desserts was nothing to shout about. As I do not eat alot during lunch, I requested for food to be packed. There was more than half of it left. I was then told that I could not pack my food! There was no signs informing me of such a policy. If i had known, I would have bought something smaller, something I could finish comfortably. In the end, forced myself to eat as much as I could because I did not want to cause so much food wastage. An extremely unpleasant experience."
Exquisite food and tea.,"Exquisite food and tea for any day of the week. Come to Marina Bay Sands the Shoppes, one cannot miss the TWG tea garden. This is perhaps one of my favourite TWG places in Singapore. Natural sunlight fills the place during the day making the tea experience even more special, akin to the tea gardens in the UK. Food was excellently executed, a good blend of taste bringing out the full flavours of the ingredients. From the savoury to the sweets, buttery to tangy, everything was of choice ingredient, you can definitely tell from the first bite. The tea list is really long and one will be able to find something to one's liking."
Excellent Service and Food,Had a wonderful hightea with my friend. The food is amazing good quality. The staffs are professionals specially Mr. Arnold Latorre very detail and attends well on the guest he made our dining experience special.
Great Job TWG,"TWG
I love the ambiance of this TWG branch. I always feel relaxed and love how naturally bright the shop is. Of course, I enjoyed the wide varieties of tea and pastries. But most importantly the kind of service that they offer here, that in spite being badly hit with the pandemic, the service continues to be amazing."
Exceptional customer service!,Exceptional service at Marina Bay Sands twg! Staff was really friendly and remembered us. Celebrated my birthday with me even though it was belated and gave complimentary macarons and candles. Will highly recommend this outlet.
Good food! Good times!,"We had a wonderful lunch today at TWG with friends. First, great service by the staff as I feel it is their service which turns a dining experience from being satisfying to being a delight. A special mention for the lady manning the entrance, who made us feel very welcome and Alvin who took care of our table, was very friendly, courteous, prompt and extended excellent service. With covid, many dining outlets at mbs have specified time periods allocated for your meals. We were glad to see TWG did no such thing, and we relaxed, chattered , and had a great time bonding over food and tea without a time limit hovering over us. Thirdly, the food was excellent. We were tickled pink to see the wide variety of tea options available - I think I saw more than a hundred blends mentioned !! Heard of and tried tea mock-tails for the first time - it was delicious . They have a tea cocktail too - if you like a spirited drink"
"Delicious Food, Excellent Service","Highly recommend the TWG Branch at B1 of MBS (perhaps a lesser known location compared to the Tea Garden which is more visibly located at the mall centre). For a restaurant that is more famous for its teas, the food is surprisingly good - in particular the steak and fries, and the wonderful sauces and condiments that goes well with the mains and bakes. Service was absolutely professional from beginning to end, in particular Ryan the store manager was warm and attentive to our meal, and his team made sure we had a good dining experience. We will certainly be back!"
Expensive but delicious!,"Expensive ofcourse because they are high end. But their teas and food are delicious! Fantastic sandwiches, cakes, ambience, and great service. Could tell that one of the staff who served us was knowledgeable - He knew what kind of tea would suit us individually the most. Thumbs up to him!"
Amazing food and thoughtful service,"Food was delicious and perfectly done. Was delighted with the special twists to the various sauces that accompany the main dish. Above this, would like to do a special shout-out to Charif, the area manager. He made it a point to go to each and every table to check if everyone had a good time and also to provide really really good recommendations and house specialties. He was also very attentive and was really warm in his actions and conversations. Well done Charif!"
Afternoon Delight,"Always an experience to dine in here. Food and the service are always very good, however lacks or that warmth feeling. Every staff were focus on serving , cleaning taking orders, but this girl - Sophia, whom I’ve seen the second time (lasttime was October2020) was a breath of fresh air. As my friends and I were dining , i asked of her to take a picture of our group, she politely smiled with that genuinely gave warmth feeling of “yes sure I want to help you” attitude, I appreciate that a lot. I recognise her warmth gesture. Thank you again Sophia."
I’m still thinking about their portobello sandwich 3 days later,They were warm toasted sandwiches with roasted portobello mushroom and white truffle béchamel sauce infused with Emperor Pu-Erh to be exact. Delicious. The scones were divine with jelly and cream. Oh and the macarons! Napoleon tea and caramel was my favourite flavour. Love how it painted our mouths too Selection of teas were overwhelming and the waitress was helpful with making recommendations. They don’t take reservations on the weekends so the wait for a table was pretty long (almost 1 hour). A fancy experience nonetheless.
A Royal Treatment at TWG Tea cafe MBS,"There aren't many Tea house chains or restaurants that specializes in Artisinal Teas. Luckily there is TWG, a luxury Tea brand based in Singapore and has branched out around the world. They specialize as a Tea retailer as well as a restaurant that serves their signature and customized artisinal teas, savoury recipes, pastries, deserts and accessories. They offer the largest collection of different Tea varieties at around 800. Their logo 1837 signifies the time when SG became a major Tea trading port. I've been around 4x at their branch in Marina Bay Sands - twice in Tea on the Bay at B1 and same for Tea Garden in B2. Getting inside their restaurants or shop will transform you into a world of luxury, beauty and elegance. I felt dining or shopping inside a palace. Their staff are one of the best - formal attire, accommodating and very friendly to their customers. The interior decor is classic, elegant, beautiful and luxurious - I felt inside a European palace. The lighting is absolutely amazing with those gorgeous chandeliers and lamps. The tables and chairs are of top quality, finest furniture, classic designs fit for a Royal. As a fine dining restaurant, their cutleries are served accordingly to what you'll order. They offer Teas, All Day Dining, Sandwiches and Deserts. Most of my visits I've ordered their Tea Time set at 20 SGD, it is absolutely practical and affordable. It consists of your choice of Tea served in a Golden Tea pot and includes 2 deserts of your choice - Muffins or Scones. I personally loved their Lavender infused custom tea and Scones. Their light, buttery, creamy scones truly shines when you add a touch of their cream and TWG Jelly. The cream is one of the best in the world - fluffy, creamy and not too sweet. The TWG jelly tastes fruity, fresh, light, not too sweet and rich in texture. It is absolutely wonderful, flavourful and perfect. I couldn't stop eating it and it compliments perfectly with my herby Lavender Jasmine tea. With their luxurious cutleries, impeccable tables and chairs, elegant interiors and gorgeous lighting - this is the perfect IG worthy photo for that beautiful shot of your Tea and Deserts. Their shop offers a wide variety of Tea bags, leafs, accessories and pastries/deserts/jellies. Perfect for gifts, souvenirs and for yourself. If you're a Tea lover then this is a must try if you want to immense yourself into the world of Teas at their finest."
Good food and service,"Its during the covid period, thus we need not make a reservation.
The food is of good quality n service is superb. Staffs are ever so attentive and helpful. We were attended by three staffs in our area and Theodora really stands out. Besides the usual service rendered, she took the time to explain the 4 different flavours of mooncakes they offer. Truly a pampered moment for me and family."
Tea galore,"My wife and I popped into this wonderful restaurant for a quick afternoon tea one weekday afternoon. We ordered a pot of tea each and shared a serving of muffins (two per serve so one each).

The choice of teas is enormous. Very difficult to choose just one. I went with the 1837 black tea while my wife had a French earl grey. Eleven Singapore dollars each but you do get four cups out of each pot. The muffins were very light and 'yummy' (to quote my wife).

Service was top class throughout our visit. One staff member saw we were going to share the muffins and rushed over with another plate and knife.

Well worth a visit for any lover of tea."
good food,wonderful place by the Marina Bay area. enjoying their various trademark dishes during weekend nights with the family and friends is the best thing to do.
"Lovely Venue, Nice Tea, Efficient Staff","The venue is lovely, very clean and luxe feeling.

We wanted a light snack, and had scones with our tea (recommend the Moroccan Mint and Bohdi Dharma). They were nice, nothing over the top.

Staff here are curt and helpful. They sorted our missing macarons in no time."
"Rude counter staff. Shocking, objectionable comments.","We were fortunate not to be at the other end of this exchange but were still served by this crude Russian woman at the tea counter.

Her condescending, presumptions comments made to the customer beside us were shocking. Fortunately, the individual was elegant enough to look the other way but we all saw how shocked he was at her comments.

This man was buying rock sugar sticks. Immediately, this russian woman behind the counter loudly announced, in a very crude and rude manner, that these sugar sticks were not lollipops. We all looked at each other and wondered what on earth possessed her to assume that she should make such a statement. To assume that the customer was not aware of what he was purchasing. My goodness, the gall and the condescension!

As mentioned, the man who was taken aback, laughed it off but clearly looked perplex by this exchange. By the way, he even replied that he was buying the rock sugar sticks for his tea. Yet, seriously, he should not have had to justify his position or dignify that awfully insulting statement.

It is surprising that TWG employs such unprofessional individuals with such arrogance. It is, without doubt, a fine tea purveyor with a pretty good range of products but gosh, they sure fail in providing proper training to their staff in customer service. Quite often, the blokes standing around their tea boutique are stiff and cold, perhaps choking on their tight black and white uniforms. Such behaviour is downright off-putting and it's baffling to experience this kind if service in a high-end tea boutique.

When she served us, she displayed the same attitude but I believe she reigned her uppity nature in due our stern expressions after witnessing the previous exchange. Such a shameful display of disrespect should never exist, especially in Singapore."
awesome,The quality of service here was amazing!! I had a really memorable experience here celebrating my birthday with my friends. Food arrived fast and it was delicious. Thank You and be back soon
Best tea supply in the World,Love the concept. The tea menu is massive... the best? ask for suggestions. Staff is highly trained and eager to help. Food is great too. High class in all senses.
A “grand” branch of TWG,A “grand” branch of TWG at the podium of MBS. The menu and service are similar to all other branches. The tables are too close to each other to maximise revenue
Possibly the BEST Tea Salon in Singapore,"TWG is one of my favourite hangouts, so yes, there's some bias in my review^^. Moreover, as I live in Singapore, I've access to their seasonal/special items like tea-infused macarons and mooncakes, all which I find delectable.

I usually meet my gal-pals @ the ION salon while the MBS one is for Pre-show Dinners with my folks. For this occasion, I brought my mum and 2x tweens. Our order comprised: Barramundi, Black Cod, Wagyu Burger, Prawn Pasta and Soup of the day for each person. 2x pots of tea: Imperial Rose and a festive-flavoured one. A trio of tea-infused sorbets artfully combined in a platter for all to sample.

Our unanimous verdict: AAAAA - save for the festive tea which the kids didn't take to. Anyhows, I reckon their Salads could be jazzed up with something exciting such as Tea-infused Meets Local-Fusion. Also if feasible, how about introducing Tea-infused Cold Pressed Juices - now that would be interesting :)"
A classic teatime experience!,"Excellent tea served at this restaurant - have tried several tea blends and they have never disappointed. Especially recommend the Haute Couture tea, Creme Brulee tea and Grand Wedding tea.

While the sandwiches and pasta are decent (some might say they are overpriced), I mainly visit this place for their tea. I usually order the teatime set which consists of 2 muffins and a teapot. Love their tea jelly and cream as well. Overall, a place for tea lovers. Service is impeccable and the restaurant is elegant as well."
Great cakes...,"Stopped for tea & cake after a morning spent walking around the bay. It was delicious, so many varieties of tea to choose from. I had the fruit tart which was delicious. My husband had a scone which he really enjoyed. Would recommend."
"Disappointing Parisian hi tea set, but tasty prawn pasta","Treated two friends here after watching Downton Abbey as they wanted to have hi tea. We ordered the Parisian set for two at $72, as well as two dining sets which included a main dish and a tea.

The prawn pasta mains were delicious, with a nice smoky marinara sauce and plump and fresh prawns. The sets came with a breakfast tea, which was okay.

For the Parisian hi tea, we selected two cakes - a pistachio slice and a mixed fruit ball on rice crispies, as well as smoke salmon sandwiches. The smoked salmon was okay, we liked the pistachio, but the fruit ball was unremarkable. The set was not value for money, we all thought, as there were not a lot of items. There were no scones, and we had to request for butter to go with the two round bread. What there was were hit and miss. For instance, we did not like the curried crab wonton. What was good was that we could select our teas, though you had to pay a supplement.

We also ordered three macaroons - Vanilla earl grey, passionfruit and chocolate - at $2 apiece, and they were small and sweet parcels.

The entire experience was okay, and cost $178 for four people, which was a tad expensive for what we got, especially the Parisian set. Service was efficient and friendly enough, though tables are rather too near each other and the walkway was cramped. For instance, staff and customers walking past our table had to jostle past, especially with prams etc, and we often had to reach out to prevent our tea cups from toppling."
A jewel in a shopping mall,"Walking along we noticed a lights and colour, very intriguing. As we approached closer we found it was a posh cafe. We just had to try it out. The service was excellent and so was the ambiance. We don't encounter this in Australia. It's either McDonald's, Coffee Club or some other cafe where you can walk in wearing shorts and thongs. Not here. So, we bought 2 teas and some cake each. All nicely presented. And this is what it's all about. Maybe the tea doesn't taste any better then from a supermarket but just sitting there with your partner and enjoying the atmosphere is worth a few dollars. We thoroughly enjoyed it as it was different."
Inauthentic teahouse experience,"TWG means The Wellness Group - Did you know the number on the label means next to nothing and there are plenty of lawsuits back and forth?

As I'm sitting there, I found this out while checking out tea reviews, since it serves pricey tea which tastes not much different to supermarket brand (Honestly do a blind tasting).

Service is good, the ambience is nice but you'd have a more authentically Singaporean tea experience at any yum cha style place. And no, we don't grow tea here."
Dinner at TWG Marina Bay Sands,"Last Friday we were at Marina Bay Sands for a sale, but ended up at TWG for dinner, as the restaurant looks so inviting. It is nicely decorated and the staff are friendly and ushered us to our seats.
We had seafood set meals, which consist of main dish, dessert and a pot of wonderful tea. It was a lovely and delicious meal, hope to be back again."
Would come back again,"Very much enjoyed this place. The iced tea was spectacular, in my opinion. As well as the fresh scones served with tea jelly and cream. And the (slightly overpriced but worth it) sandwiches. It was nice to be at a place where so much care was taken in the way your food is served. For example the ice tea was served in big glasses and came with a small jug of sugar syrup. The sandwiches have their crusts cut off and looked awesome. Went to their shop after and bought a couple of teas to take home."
Macaroons,Salesperson were all friendly! They will recommend tea and other best stuff they had. Alot of selection so they were asking if you need assistance.
Bad attitude,"The staff didn’t care about you and treated you like poo when you sat down. Had to order 1 pot each person so we had 2 pots we didn’t even finish the one. The waiters were literally hovering over you and they look so judgemental, didn’t even wanna eat in front of them. VERY VERY pricey aswell rather starve than spend $22 on a teapot"
Loved the Tiramisu macaroons!,"Realistically I would never spend SGD 12 on 5 mini macaroons though they were absolutely cute and tempting displayed to attract any passerby. But just one bite of the Tiramisu flavour, I ended up going back the next day for another Tiramisu macaroon fix!"
Exquisite,"If you're searching for a place to have a tea in a fine dining environment,then this is one of those place. It houses a wide variety of tea. Mind the waiting line before being seated. But its worth the wait🤗"
Anne F,"I recently visited TWG with my husband for afternoon tea to celebrate my birthday whilst on holiday in Singapore. The restaurant was delightful, the waiters were very attentive, and the afternoon tea delicious. We found it hard to choose a specific tea as there were so many to choose from. I was even given a small cake with a candle in it, which was unexpected and very enjoyable.

I thoroughly enjoyed my time there and would certainly recommend it."
Lunch and afternoon tea,"Caught up with my pals here over lunch and tea. The mains are pretty delicious especially my salmon with mentaiko coupled with midnight summer night tea. We also chose some desserts off the pantry tray.
The service was prompt and friendly. Reservations are recommended even o weekdays."
Ideal place for afternoon tea,This is a nice place to have an afternoon tea and pamper yourself. There is a wide selection of teas and beautiful pastries. Nice place for gathering of friends
Lovely ambience and a good cup of tea,"After a tiring walk around the shops, we really enjoyed the ambience and excellent cup of tea and snacks at this tea garden."
"Not only tea, but food too","This is one of my favourite place which I will always bring my wife for lunch and dinner. Tonnes of tea selection for you to choose, and which i prefer their french earl grey. Food are exquisitely well present and the only set back is, they changes their soup everyday, which we dont really like. But, they sure have nice tomato soup which we prefer it to be included in the menu, rather then one of the Soup Of the Day choice."
TWG,TWG at marina bay is amazing. There waiters and waitresses are very help full and whenever u need something they come really quick. The atmosphere is really positive and friendly and they have amazing food I am looking forward to my next visit in singapore
It's alright la!,"Heard that it's good. By the time we reached at 8pm 2 out of 3 set menu items were not available. Bummer!

Nice ambience naturally but to have people above you being able to look down on you as you dine is not an experience I would prefer always.

Oh well for lack of any options..while at marina bay sandes you try the outlets there...have a go!"
“Kiasu” real estate,"It was my second visit and surely it shall be my final one.

The seating arrangements were so tight that I find it difficult to get into and out of my seat without knocking into my neighbors.
I am a medium-sized and if you were plus-sized, I hope you have a more pleasant experience.

I have no doubts the waiters were silently complain but they need a job so they just bear with it. I do seriously wonder what were the managers thinking. Perhaps they are immune too.

Unless you desperately want to dine at this location, trust me, there are far better choices to have a meal elsewhere and you wouldn’t have to walk far."
Still needs improvement,"After the housefly experience from my previous TWG brunch, it's been a while since I pop by the MBS outlet to satisfy my TWG cravings as I prefer to stick to the Ion outlet. As usual, the truffle croque was great and the service staff was wonderful.

However, I must have the worst luck with flies at this particular outlet as there was a fly in my Number 12 Teashake today - a fly - in my half drank teashake. ‍♀️ Which really ruined my appetite and was the reason I couldn't finish my dessert.

The staff was prompt and offered to replace the drink for me once I showed them the fly flowing in my drink but the thought of sipping the teashake that has a fly in it for some time made me not too keen to have a new drink.

Knowing that I wasn't keen to have a new drink, the service staff offered to waive off the teashake from my bill and gave me two macarons out of goodwill.

It's pretty good service recovery in my opinion as they were quick to rectify this issue. I left the restaurant feeling queasy about my luck but still appeased.

However, upon checking my receipt when I got home, I realised that I was still charged for the teashake and it wasn't removed from my bill. ☹

Well, it's really my fault for not checking the bill proper when it was presented to me. But it's still disappointing to find out that I am charged for a half drank drink that I was told would be waived given that there was a fly within.

Hence, my conclusion that this outlet still needs a bit of improvement. Hopefully, I'll have better luck dining here the next time - which would definitely be some time way later."
Macaroons,"I have lost count how many times I passed next to this store and the wonderful smell was always there!

I entered this store and I felt that I was in Disney, at least, my kind of Disney! with so many different tea flavors, teapots and cup of all sizes and forms.

I wish I could take them all.

The service was on point and their macaroons were extremely delicious, they practically melted in my mouth. All the flavors were screaming my name and the price was great; only $2.00 per piece.

Thank you!"
afternoon tea,"One of the highlights of our holiday ,waited a little while to get seated but it was worth it .We all chose a special tea and a mix of cakes and sandwiches ,you couldn't tell which was the cakes and which was the sandwiches they were soooo beautiful .Staff were very atentetive and pleasant .Yes it was expensive but worth every penny .."
"Good Memory, Great Tea","The tea was amazing, so was the Lasagne. (Man, I really loved the Lasagne). The staff were great, pleasant The restaurant did open up my world to Tea. Greatly enjoyed my time with my ex."
Simply lovely,Loved the variety of tea and the ambiance. The staff is able to assist if you are not sure what type of tea to order. A little pricey but well worth the indulgence.
Magic Macaroons & Tea.,"An experience in the old english afternoonTea ceremony. The Macaroons are really good, the Tea sublime. (My son buys a box every time he visits Singapore and keeps it for weekend use only.)"
came back here twice,"While staying in Singapore we came here twice. And twice i ordered the wagyu burger. Food taste and quality was superb. The TWG tea experience was great with a variaty of tea choices on the menu. White linens on the tables, good service quality, nice ambience made me remember this place"
Wonderful tea,"A literary staggering selection of teas, very high class atmosphere taking you out of Singapore almost as soon as you step inside. After walking around the gardens by the bay, you'd be well off coming here for afternoon tea later, with a good selection of light snacks, and the complimentary tea jelly is quite good also. With friendly staff, and two locations within the Shoppes, and a store section where you can buy tea sets or bags for gifts or to take home."
Nothing But The Best,"As usual, the service was spot-on at this outlet of the famed tea brand. I was grateful that the outlet is wheel-chair accessible as it sat on an island surrounded by water. The team member who led us into the restaurant very nicely allocated a table for us next to the ramp. Kudos!

It was tea-time and my partner and I opt to try the 3-tier Parisian set. It was worth every cent. We left the tea selection to the team member to recommend. Obviously, product knowledge is key as there are literally thousands of blends to choose from and one would be overwhelmed with the wide selection. Service was prompt despite the capacity crowd and the bite-sized eats was tasty and beautifully presented. The scones were of the right texture, crumbly and light. Layer on the jam and clotted cream and you have yourself a heavenly meal.

Well done, TWG!"
Love this place,"This is my daily piece of calm. Tea. Delicious food. Tea. Amazing staff. Tea. Classical music to soothe the nerves. Tea. So many types of tea, a true heaven for anyone who loves this noble drink."
delightful lunch,"After deciding we would eat somewhere in the MBS Shoppes we saw TWG and it's so well presented we were keen to try. I had a vanilla tea and I love the service that comes along with ordering tea here, out is special, the smell of the tea was very vanilla with a hint of black tea undertones. It was really nice. I ordered the salmon salad that comes with twills filled with crab that have a slight curry flavour. I was curious when I saw these, pethaps it might be too strongly flavoured for the rest of the dish but it wasn't it was tasty! The service was impeccable so I would definitely go again."
Always excellent,"This is our favourite spot for lunch in Singapore and each time we visit we try to get there. The range of savoury food is not large but always top quality: this time we had black cod and a scallop dish. The range of patisserie is large — we both had Black Forest concoctions — and of course the range and quality of teas is staggering.

There is usually a happy crowd of locals and tourists there."
Great food and service!,"Been to this restaurant all the time I visit Singapore and never left me disappointed!
Dishes are sophisticated and taste amazing, I usually order their Mains which change every season.
Desserts and Teas are a must when visiting TWG.
The place is ideal for brunch or afternoon tea to relax nourished by beautiful flavours.
Can’t wait to visit again!"
TEA TIME !!,"It is TWG so you know you are going to get amazing tea anyways, but the servers here are so nice and ready to serve you that they will stand there and explain the taste of every single tea, they are very informed.

This is probably the best tea time I have experienced outside of the UK.

Try it"
Nonchalant Manager,Disgusting attempt that service recovery. Disgusting service attitude; lying about keeping the sandwiches warm when it was obviously left at the window for some time. lying about the 45min wait for afternoon tea to be served. not recommended
Fabulous Quality and Superb Selection of Teas,"I love TWG Tea Garden. It is a great place to sample all kinds of speciality teas, from Gunpowder Green to Darjeeling and Assam.

I particularly enjoy the Earl Grey's blend and will usually take 100g home with me. At S$19.90/100g it is seriously expensive, but the flavour is unrivalled."
TWG -The Worst Group,So we decided to cap off the night with a tea in TWG and to my surprise you are required to order 1 teapot for each person! Since we were four and decided to order only two teas since we can barely finish 1 teapot. They took the 2 teacups in the table since the waiter told us that we only ordered 2 teapots! This is the first time I've encountered such bold and arrogant customer service! What the hell?! Since where did that policy comes from?! Is it because TWG is going bankrupt so they rob us the prerogative to order what we can only finish?! I swear I won't be coming to TWG and rest assured I won't be recommending this to either of my friends and colleagues! Although TWG think this won't be their loss but your policy of forcing people to order drinks will soon backfire on you guys! Next time you should put a BIG CLAUSE on your menu's that each person should order one drink to let your customers be well informed!!and not that stupid little clause at the bottom of your menu coz nobody really give a damn to read that!
so beautiful,"my partner and I had lunch here and it was a highlight of our trip for me, service great, food lovely, just a lovely experience, in middle of shopping centre and lovely fine crockery, so for me lovely,"
Perfect cup of tea,"Called into TWG this afternoon and wasn't disappointed,being a tea lover and really enjoy a good cup of French earl grey, this was one of the best I've tasted"
So many teas to choose from,Stopped here for morning tea. I had the best chocolate truffle tart with vanilla bourbon tea ice cream. The macaroons were crisp on the outside with unique tea flavours. The service was great and the atmosphere lovely. Teas cost between 11- 17 SGD per person. It is a lovely thing to do whilst travelling and shopping.
"As always, fabulous","Staff is great, tea is amazing, food is perfect....can't get better! We go often to TWG around the world and always consistent and delicious!"
Chi Chi Tai Tai Hangout,"The business was surprisingly brisk on a lazy Thursday afternoon. Mostly tourists or ladies of leisure types. We had to wait for a table. Good thing their shop was pretty interesting to browse.

There are a few tea set menus - ranges from a full blown main course & dessert set to a simple cake set. We ordered the cake set to share - citrus cheesecake was tangy & unique but a tad too sweet. There are also sandwiches, pastries and western fare to choose from.

Their tea selection is definitely impressive but bewildering, the four pages of tea varieties was really intimidating. For tea non-connoisseurs like us, it was pretty stressful making a choice.
Good thing they provide a tea bible.

The food presentation is very good. We saw many instagrammable dishes on the other tables. Ambience is classy but the distance between tables are pretty cramped.
Go there to see & be seen."
Delicious tea and great service!,"I went to have dinner with my sister at the TWG Tea Garden at Marina Bay Sands as the exterior and the interior of the place was absolutely phenomenal. We were basically attracted to the place like magnets. We were greeted and welcomed by the well-mannered supervisor and the staff. They were all so kind and helpful. Once we sat down at our table, my sister and I noticed that our table was not stable, as in, it was wobbly and we really didn't like it. I then called for the staff and told him about this problem. He was so nice and helpful, he took at piece of paper and folded it, placing it below the table to stabilize the table. We were very thankful and this is one of the reasons why I would say this place has great service. They took care of the matter nicely and efficiently. We started our meal with some Apricot Tea. The tea was extremely delicious! Right after the meal, I headed to the nearby TWG store to pick up some Apricot tea leaves for my friends and family. It was that good!! After the tea, each of us had mushroom soup, and I know what all of you are thinking, ""It is just mushroom soup."" I can be a critic when it comes to mushroom soup, so I can assure you that, that mushroom soup at the TWG Tea Garden is one of my top 10 favorite mushroom soups in all of Asia. The croutons that were served with the mushroom soup was absolutely, positively awesome!! We also had some other food such as a burger and spaghetti but it was only alright. It was delicious as well but it wasn't food that I would constantly order over and over again. Other than the food being great, the plating of the food as well as how the food was being positioned onto our tables were great! Perfect for a food blogger shot!! The lighting may not be enough if you go at night, so I recommend you to turn on your flashlight from your phone and shine it onto the food when you want to take a pic. Furthermore, not to mention, the atmosphere and the ambiance was incredible! Finally, to conclude, as only my sister and I came, we needed someone to help take our pictures. Our extremely kind waiter for the night, named Patrick, was so nice. He helped us take pictures and we also had a full on conversation with him. He was very friendly to talk to. For anyone that is thinking of visiting the place, it was really a nice experience, the food was pretty good and if you ever get to meet Patrick, definitely ask him to take a picture for you. He really knows the perfect angles. My sister and I were scared that we might not get a shot that we wanted, but the picture turned out awesome, we didn't even need to retake the picture! He was of excellent service!!"
Good afternoon tea and great service,"Consistent quality of service every time I return for afternoon tea. Nice relaxing ambience and the canapes are really nice. And you have to try the scones. If you are looking for a light afternoon tea, this will probably be a good choice. Many hotels serve very good afternoon tea as well but sometimes the food is too much.

Compared to the other famous macaroons I have tasted like laduree and Pierre Herme, the macarons taste good and probably the most value for money. You can do a take away at the shop along with some tea."
Excellent and worth spending and evening.,"The TWG Tea Garden is a must visit place. It's beautifully situated, has plenty of choices in terms of tea and accompaniments and one can spend a very enjoyable couple of hours just drinking tea and people watching."
Modern Colonial Experience,"Great tea, there is like 1000 different types, awesome food, from Scones to Eggs Benedict, lovely setting and impeccable service. This is living like a Colonial Rajah in modern days!"
Gorgeous Tea House,"I had my brunch here with my friends last Aug 5. Though it’s pricey but the location, ambiance and the level of customer services are worth the money. The meal they served were all fantastic with lovely presentation. I will definitely comes back here with my husband."
Just OK,"We picked this place because it was near gardens 's by the bay and it had good TA reviews.

The tea was great and I'm sure the cakes are too. But we had lunch and it was pretty average. I ordered a burger which came out luke warm and others ordered sandwiches that were a bit small and not well executed.

Last time we visited, we went to an Italian upstairs. That was really nice. Wish I could remember the name of it!

Summary: tea and cake yes, lunch- choose elsewhere."
Brilliant scones and great tea!,"Our first impression was that this place was gorgeous, and it looked like a place where one could chill at for hours on end. We reached at about 3pm on a weekday and the place was rather packed. Thankfully, we didn't have to wait for a seat.

We ordered a 1837 set(2 scones + tea; $19) and a Chic set(2 scones + finger sandwiches + tea; $33). As usual, the scones were delicious and perhaps the best in the world, IMO. The tea was great too; I'd recommend the Royal Breakfast Tea and do request for some milk on the side!

On the other hand, the finger sandwiches were a letdown. 3 tiny sandwiches(curry tart, mushroom bread, smoked salmon bread) for the additional price of $14 was certainly not worth it.

Service was top-notch. There IS a problem with this place though. At about 3-5pm in the afternoon, the seats on the left side of the place would get UNBEARABLY hot as they would be in direct contact with sunlight. I found myself sweating and it was really uncomfortable. I'm not sure what can be done about this because it's really an infrastructural problem but perhaps the brains of the company can think of a solution to this."
Thank u Patrick!,"I've been coming to this place for the past four years every time I visit Singapore. their staff are very kind and welcoming and their dishes never seem to disappoint! I used to order very delish salmon with matcha rice which recently have been removed but the alternative is still ok. I love their tea, club sandwiches, the atmosphere and their desserts r good (try the French toast!)

Thanks sheikh Patrick for the amazing recommendations"
Ala Venice,"Tea time at the canal section of the MBS, sweet! The rest of the family waited here while the kids had a gondola ride. The setting is just lovely!"
Weekday lunch,"Went to TWG for lunch at around 1pm. Place was slightly crowded and we had to wait 10min before our table was ready

Ordered the set lunch, consisting of tea, steak and a dessert. Wait staff were attentive and food tasted great. Nice place for an afternoon chat"
Elegant with a wide choice of teas,"After window shopping in Marina Bay Sands, we stopped at the TWG tea shop at Marina Bay Sands for morning tea. They have a HUGE range of teas and if you are confused about which one to choose, the staff will recommend a tea for you.
We added the scones and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.
Such a great setting. Quite elegant.
Make this a must stop on your travels in Singapore."
Afternoon tea,"My husband & I were walking around the Shoppes at Marina Bsy Sands & saw this TWG Tea Garden.
We were amazed at the wide selection of tea at this outlet.
They also provided a set menu for tea time which is interesting and affordable.
Desserts are also on the menu & the range of Macarons together with the tea gave us memorable experience."
Definitely needs some improvements,"My friend and I used to drop by the Ion TWG for lunch after yoga classes as we love their Genmaicha mushroom linguine, Napoleon tea shake and scones with tea jelly. However, we haven't been to TWG for more than half a year after we change yoga studio.

As we have been craving for their food and drinks, we decided to pop by their new outlet at MBS for lunch today. Sad to say, our cravings were only half satisfied. It started off with one service staff bringing us the outdated lunch menu. We had placed our order for the mushroom linguine only to be informed another service staff that that was no longer in the menu. :(

Instead, they have replaced the mushroom linguine with porcini linguine. Unfortunately for us, the porcini linguine consists of beef and beacuse we can't take beef, we had to decide on another replacement. Since we really crave for pasta today, we end up choosing the seafood marinara as the third option, wagyu meatball tagliatelle, also contains beef. We had tried TWG's tiger prawn squid ink spaghetti previously and remembered that it was also not bad. Hence, we believe that the seafood marinara would be a good choice too.

It was a mistake. The mussels were not cleaned properly and smelled. The baby octopus looked unappetizing. In the end, I only finished up half of my spaghetti and my prawns, leaving the rest of the food untouched.

To make things worse, there was an annoying housefly flying around the restaurant. It kept landing at the table beside us and everytime the couple shoo the fly; it will land on our table instead. The fly even landed on my bread, which could also be another contributing factor to why I lost my appetite. Though I must give credit to the third service staff who immediately change my bun after I informed him that the fly landed on my bread.

Yet, I won’t say that the whole visit had been disappointing. At least, the service was good, the scones with tea jelly was great and the tea shake was awesome. Perhaps TWG should consider reverting back to their original pasta menu and the MBS outlet should try to get rid of that housefly. :p In the meantime, I might still visit TWG but maybe just for scones and tea at the Ion outlet."
Mul-Tea,Have to admit that in my mind TWG was connected with just tea and bisquits to nibble on. But new I know better and would gladly go there again for a tasty light meal and excellent tea and bisquits. Gluten free option are not promoted as such but since each course description is quite extensive gluten-free customers can also find suitable courses.
Depending on what you are after,"Really depends on what you are after. If you are looking for something label and pretentious for a high tea, this is the place to be. Check out their retail shop on the same floor, a mug could be costing $160 or a set of teapot could be $800+.

This is not for us personally. Won’t be visiting again."
Just a soothing spot for relaxation and a light meal,We wanted a light dinner and TWG at The Shoppes at Marina Bay is a great spot to people watch. The colonial brass and crisp white tablecloths and napkins add pizzazz even if you only have a cup of tea. We selected a Caesar salad and Eggs Benedict. Both were good sized meals. The salad was fresh and crisp and very tasty. Our tea was served in a full size pot with metal warmer. The prices are very reasonable and service as always impeccable. The most difficult part is choosing from hundreds of varieties of tea! And don’t forget to visit their shop nearby to buy some of that tea to take home.
Great food and delightful tea,I was greatly impressed with the food and the service. Attractive prices for great quality food. Beautifully located in the heart of the mall this place deserves an obligated visit. I enjoyed wonderful double tea pots with plenty of time. Totally worth the waiting time😀
nice,Nice tea selections and cakes. Staffs were professional & friendly. Great for a fancy afternoon tea..
Delicious Dinner,"My wife and I had dinner here and it was fantastic. Unfortunately we were late to sample the high tea options but I had the Wagu steak and my wife the pan seared cod and they were both delicious. We opted for a mint tea which was very good but the tea selection on offer was unprecedented. The staff were polite and attentive and the restaurant is like a little oasis surrounded by the hustle and bustle of the mall, a great dining experience."
what a delightful and surprisingly delicious lunch!,"teenage hunger prompted an unplanned stop here for lunch and it was SUCH a great find.

I'm not a desserty person but apparently the maracons were 'to die for"""
Surprisingly Pleasant Lunch on a Lazy Sunday,"I’ve dined at TWG several times over the years at different branches. Today’s late lunch gave me a good surprise.

Firstly, service was on point (except for the time it took for the bill to come). Staff was attentive and welcomed my request for more butter and olive oil for my bread roll. Big shout out to Sergio for your excellent service. We could feel the service from his heart.

Next and equally importantly, the food made our eyes lit up. We ordered the cod and the tiger prawns with squid ink spaghetti.

The cod was perfectly glazed on the outside, giving it a nice crisp. The inside was a nice flake and tenderness that felt delightful in the mouth.

The pasta was al dente and masterfully crafted with tomato and a bit umami that made us think about where we’ve had better. It’s wasn’t so clear.

Obviously the tea selection is an encyclopedia’s worth so it depends on your personal preference. What I can say is that the afternoon was a joy and I’m happy a Singapore brand is doing us all proud."
Elegant dinner for two,We decided to eat an early dinner here. We got the set meal and I got the best choice. My daughter's was not as delicious as my choice. The tea was of very good quality. My meal had very soft octopus with cheese on top of salad and so delicious. My dessert choice too was divine. Service was very good.
Excellent Tea and Dessert,"The tea has always been good to us. We just love exploring the various type of tea. But the dessert is really yummylicious and amazing. We ordered a cheesecake and a chocolate truffle tart. Both were exquisite and we would sure to be a returning customers. Just a gentle reminder to remember to place serviettes on the table as mine was missed out and we had to asked due to the busy peak. Overall, we enjoyed both the tea and dessert. Kudos! :)"
Nice option for lunch break,"TWG formulated the best blends of tea in the world.

But they serve all the blends only one, same way instead of serving them the way each blend ought to be or according to each consumer's preference.

Otherwise, lunch options were reasonably well prepared and varieties were adequately offered.

There were 3 venues at the Shoppes. We visited the one situated in the open area within the complex."
Island in the Middle of the Mall,"This restaurant is cleverly set in the middle of the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, raised up above the floor by a few steps. We arrived before the lunch crowd but still did have to wait quite a while for our food. The tea is served in what seem to be gigantic teapots but which actually don’t hold much liquid. The tea menu itself is miles long and it’s really quite difficult to decide which one to order!

We had the Tiger Prawn Salad which was quite good and the Wagyu Burger; good but relatively small for the price. What did irritate us is that when a diner spilled some food on the floor, the waiter tried to clean it up but wasn’t really careful to get everything, so a squishy wedge of tomato sat there on the ground for at least half an hour, just waiting to get stepped on. This just didn’t match the otherwise lovely white tablecloths and flowers set around the island."
Delicious!,I started with an iced tea and scones since it was a hot day and I wasn't starved. As I finished I decided to go for a piece of cake and hot tea. All delicious food and drink and the staff is just attentive enough to not be pests. You can also buy the tea at the shop attached. Highly recommend!
"Good food, good service","I ordered a 24-hour braised beef short ribs in a red wine stock, served with melted cheese potato mash sprinkled with cheese potato mash sprinkled with Lu An Gua Pian tea leaves. The beef was very tender but it was the melted cheese potato mash that I loved the most! Had creme brûlée tea and my cousin Paolo ordered his fave tea which name escapes me."
Tasty macarons but strange experience the day after,All their stores at the Marina Bay Hotel and Shopping Mall are amazing. The food looks good and service is great. I bought a box of macarons and really enjoyed the different tasty flavors. The only complaint is that I believe they use excessive food coloring ... the effect after eating a couple of macarons might be seen in for at least 24 hours.
New Policy,"My family and I have been going to TWG fairly regularly, we enjoy their food, tea, pastries and the atmosphere. The food is interesting and infused with tea, well done and has nice sides. Service has always been impeccable, and it was always a good experience eating with them.

However, today when we went to dine with them again, we were appalled to discover that they had a new policy: every diner must order a beverage. We had already ordered a main course each, but were told that to eat here, we had to order a pot of tea or beverage each. Neither of us wanted something to drink, we just simply wanted to have a nice lunch meal at TWG.

We hope they would review their policy because we would like to be able to dine here again without being forced to order a beverage each in addition to a main course."
High Tea Treat,This was our second visit to the tea garden - having been there 3 years previously. Hundreds of blends of teas to choose from whilst sat in opulent surroundings. Orchids all around. World class macaroons - S$2 each. Luscious sorbet!
Absolutely Delightful Afternoon Tea,Beautiful food and beautiful service. The tea is perfect. This experience is a must for Singapore and it’s culinary experiences
