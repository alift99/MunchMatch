Great bar,"We have two great memories here. The first was our last night out before all the COVID lock downs. And the second was tonight for an after dinner drink. The bartenders Bob and Jes were exactly what you want from from a bar tender - good conversationalists, good recommendations and a little fun without being intrusive. Hats off to them and their great drinks."
Casual dining with good food and flawless service,"Had a casual brunch at this restaurant with our visiting friend from the UK. The service was prompt, efficient and friendly. We ordered poached eggs on salmon and spinach and cheeseburger with side fries. Light, tasty and just the right portions for lunch. The service was flawless. Ulli, the Operations Manager, sent a thank you email for our visit. This was unexpected and was a nice touch to what was already a wonderful dining experience."
Unique ambience,"Nice starters: angel hair with black truffles, crispy salmon sushi, scallops with truffles.

The mains of sesame crysted sea trout, wood fired tiger prawns were very nicely done too. The grilled octopus and the bacon wrapped SRF pork chop was ordinary - bacon was generously provided and apricots were sweet and interestingly made.

We were served a complimentary dish of samosas with minced chicken filling and herbs. They were delicious.

We tried the desserts of blueberry basque tart and Flaming Rose Alaska. These were the must try because they have a great balance of textures and taste.

Ambience of restaurant was cosy, set in a colonial high ceiling house. Service staff was not obtrusive and always within reach."
Pricey,"This being a celebrity chef restaurant by Jean Georges + under the Como group, prices are not low. $65+++ for set lunch Simple crab meat on lettuce to start. Dry burger. Average bluebery tart Service is good though"
Old world charm restaurant with new world cuisines,"Outstanding dinner from the starters till the dessert, and also the wine! We had the Crudo-ceviche and kale & broccoli salad. Followed by delicious orecchiette (pasta) with scampi and kale and also the delicately cooked pork chop with smoked chili glaze and asparagus. Finished with the refreshing sorbets and a pie. Total cost for 2 persons including one bottle of wine S$314."
Public displayed of affection,We came to celebrate our anniversary here which the place is very romantic elegant and classy. Service are excellent and food are amazing. Excerpt the manager I can tell Russian or German that make us uncomfortable as he is mingling next table with us. He gave that 5 star service to that table not to everyone. I can tell seems like a couple as too much affection to show. And when the bill comes the friend of the woman insist to pay and he said he take care of it and she insisted to pay and said he didn’t key inn and nothing to worry.
Wonderful dinner!,"Enjoyed the Dempsey experience! Table outside, great service, tasty food. The pasta with crab was divine. Interior is very original!"
Portuguese Wine Pairing Dinner,"I went here for a curated Portuguese Wine Pairing Dinner by Wine Adore. The food was incredible, each dish carefully paired with the wine. The team were very knowledgeable and explained each dish and the wine that accompanied it. It was my first time in this restaurant and will definitely be coming back!"
DC Experience,"A great place to celebrate our anniversary. A lovely setting, excellent food and attentive service. We could not have been happier with the experience."
Outstanding brunch.,Outstanding brunch. Wonderful convivial atmosphere created and led by the GM Balthazar who has done a wonderful in creating a fantastic environment to have a relaxing brunch. The food was sublime and the cocktails were amazing! Will definitely be back. Highly recommended.
Won’t go again,"Came because it was highly recommended by a colleague, but very surprised. Service is good, but I think that’s where it ended for us.

The burger was pretty awful. At an establishment like this and a $36 burger, you’d at least expect a brioche bun. But the bun was a stale sesame bun. The burger patty was tiny and the whole thing just lacked flavour. Accompanying fries were stale and soggy. Needless to say my kids didn’t eat the burger and I wasn’t too keen on finishing their portion either.

Crackling chicken was crispy but it was just a fried piece of chicken. Served with a very weak habanero sauce and wilted spinach. The whole dish was tasteless and a big mistake to order.

The shrimp salad was ok - shrimps were nice but salad dressing not too great.

What we loved was the sushi on crispy rice. That was really good.

Needless to say, we didn’t stick around for dessert."
Bday Lunch,Was early for my lunch appointment so they seated me at the bar.. not after about 10mins I get the reserved table. My sis ordered the set lunch which was value for money & tasted awesome! She had the kale salad & rigatoni w/meatballs. I ordered a Tomato mozzarella pizza & crispy sushi.. great food! Highlight was the apple cinnamon cake w/sherbet. Overall nice ambience and friendly staff. Definitely will back again!
Excellent service + food + atmosphere :),"We had an event in the private dining space. We had such an exceptional experience at Dempsey Cookhouse. All of the staff went the extra mile to make our experience truly stress free and memorable! The food was amazing, the room was bright and was not only pleasant for the dinner but also made pictures look so nice! We felt very taken care of and everything went seamlessly! I couldn’t recommend your space for an event more!"
Great Service But Beware of The Price of Acqua Panna,"Overall the food was great and service was good too until I realised that the Acqua Panna was chargeable at about $9 per bottle, it was not made known to me that the acqua panna was chargeable, the waitress only asked me if I had wanted still or sparkling water... Decor was nice, chic and modern."
Wonderful experience - as always!,"Wonderful, as always!! Loved the ‘new’ free flow brunch option with Prosecco & a whole array of different cocktails (also champagne option available). Service was fantastic!!"
"Bland, boring, bad!","The service was impeccable - faultless. We ate alfresco during a calm cool night. Candles, dim lighting, beautiful surroundings - it could have been a perfect experience had it not been for the terrible food.
We ordered a array of starters which were mediocre - and for my main, I had the scallops.
I know fresh scallops when I taste them, and fresh these were not. Rubbery, fishy tasting with a bland sauce. My husband ordered a pizza which was kiddy sized and bland at its best. We had cauliflower which when reading the description, sounded amazing - but it wasn’t. The side of fries were cold and soggy.
What an expensive, very forgettable meal.
Had it not been for the aforementioned service, I would have given 1 star.
We won’t be eating there again. Feeling very ripped off."
Excellent service,Came here for lunch and we ordered 2 set lunch. Love the high ceiling and white interior design a nice quite place to have a meal with friends and family. The service was excellent our cups were always top up with water waiters and waitresses were very friendly and professional. Came here to celebrate a birthday and they gave a small cake on the house. The food is very fresh and we were very full after desert. Will definitely visit again.
"Good food, lovely ambience and great service.","The food was good, and probably that’s what you would expect too! We walked in during phase 2, where only two-to-dine is allowed. It was nice, not having the need to make reservation, but clearly you cld see that, ths business has taken a hit. The service level did not drop though. Every staff who served us, provided the same professional and warm service. We had the salmon appetizer, pizza and lobster eggs benedict. Enjoyed them thoroughly. It was a great experience. We will be back."
Birthday Dinner,"Celebrated bestie's bday at this beautiful restaurant at Dempsey. Good service & delicious cuisine namely crab avocado salad, red snapper etc. Came with a foc slice of cake (unfortunately dry) The dessert we ordered Cheese cake was good though but prefer the sorbet to be less sour. Most beautiful restaurant with high ceiling & black & white flooring etc truly a place to impress."
"Great dinner, superb service and ambience","Was lovely to be back to Cookhouse with my hubby and 2 kids for dinner. Due to the 2- pax per Table dining restriction, the kids had to sit at the adjacent table. Starter warm shrimps salad and their salted caramel ice-cream are my must-have dishes every time I am at cookhouse. They are really good. It was great to see the familiar service staff (Daniel & Johan) who are ever so attentive to our needs."
Date night,"Great atmosphere and restaurant design (high ceilings with an illuminated bar in the middle) with excellent food! The lobster main, tenderloin, snapper and lobster pasta were wonderfully done. The pea soup with fried bits in it and tuna tartare were just OK."
Lunch on Hari Raya and Ascension Thursday,Just had lunch with my young 6 year old daughter. Great thanks to the excellent from service from Densyl. Thanks Densyl!
Too expensive and bad service,"Friend insisted to come and try, we went last Saturday for brunch. The male server who served outdoor called Justin seemed not willing to serve us. Very hard to get his attention. The price of the menu is overpriced. Not coming back."
Very overpirced!!,"We were there recently for dinner. The service is pretty good for Singapore standards but the place is so overpriced it's ridiculous!! I wouldn't go there again, lots of better places in Singapore."
"Great ambiance, wonderful service!",Beautiful set-up! Cocktails was great! Had a great time with friends....excellent service by Mohan! Thanks!
Wonderful restaurant in Dempsey oasis,"A lovely restaurant in Dempsey with great ambience for both lunch and dinner. Western cuisine with three course set lunches at S$45 pax. Attentive wait staff who are professional and friendly. Good selection and delicious appetisers, main course and desserts. A beautiful environment. Quiet for professional business lunches and perfect for a romantic evening with loved ones."
"Great food, stellar service, and amazing ambience","Second time dining in here, and I'm glad to say that standards have been maintained and the food is as amazing as ever.

We were served by Giuseppe and his team of dedicated servers; Timothy, Leah and Daniel, that provided impeccable service from start to finish. Making my business lunch enjoyable.

The set lunch options are well portioned and well executed. I had the samosa as my entre, then the Burger, and the passionfruit sorbet as dessert. Nothing to complain about the food, the pacing of the courses was done right and service didn't feel too rushed.

Will definitely be back!"
Well done on their set lunch,"SGD 45 set lunch which includes Starter, Main and Dessert. Had Kale salad to start, main was Chicken and dessert 2 ice cream. Was surprised the meal was of such good quality and generous portion. Service was very attentive. We had a cocktail each which is a bit too sweet for my liking. When we call for the bill, we had 2 credit card + cash to spilt into 3. The nice caucasian waiter took them happily. Some resto will give us an exasperating look but not here. You feel very welcome the moment you step into this place. I'll certainly be back again!"
Excellent service and food,"Excellent service and food . Djessa and Daniel were impeccable in their service. A small ice spill on the table caught their attention. Attentive yet non-obstructive. Am impressed.
The toasted egg yolk with caviar is a must! The creamy egg yolk with caviar sea saltines and light toasted bread blended perfectly.
The grill octopus was good. Even my wife who doesn’t fancy octopus enjoyed it. But the main highlight - crackling organic chicken is out of this world with its light crispy crunchy battered breading and moist meat is one of the best chekcken tasted to date. Definitely will come again."
Pizza is good!,"Great job on the pizza , luv the size and the taste . Offer a few more options and it will be back for more! Pan fried squash is spectacular !"
Nice outdoor Brunch,"Great outdoor Brunch at the cookhouse in Dempsey amazing ambiance, great service and delicious food. The outdoor setting is really nice surrounded by the lush greenery and nice breeze on a Sunday afternoon makes a great difference for the experiences. The service was very attentive even do we where seated outside (most places forget about you..) not at the cookhouse. keep it up will be back just one critic your burger needs some quick."
Original and tasty,"Nice atmosphere, quality of food is very good and it’s quite original, specially the combination of some flavours. The service was excellent, specially from Mohan, who was attentive and paying attention to the details. Thanks!"
Food quality has dropped,I used to like dempsey cookhouse but they have become complacent. Me and my friend ordered our burgers medium- well but our burgers arrived bloody and even the most cooked parts were at best medium... definitely not medium well done. We didn't bother sending it back but we both could not eat the burger and so didn't finish it. I think the restaurant has become complacent over time and their quality has certainly dropped from when they first opened.
Overpriced for a tired menu. atout at Dempsey is better.,"Chic modern décor. The food is good, but nothing to scream about. Worse, the short menu has not changed for well over a year. Two out of four meat main dishes are deep fried. Service is friendly and polite, but mechanical. This is not a place where you can engage in a conversation with the staff. At $100-120 per pax, you are paying for the brand and the décor. I am not returning until the menu changes. For French/western at Dempsey, atout is more satisfying, and there are many other options too."
Again 5 stars,"Can't remember how many times we've already been here, but again it was very good overall so long story short: we'll be back once more! Can really recommend it for dinner!"
Delivery was poor,So we ordered delivery - we love this restaurant normally - but the food was soggy and uninspiring when it arrived. I suspect we weren't the first stop on the delivery route. We tried reviving it in the oven at home but it was still very very average. We had much better delivery from other restaurants. Surprising also that this restaurant is not seeking opinions on its delivery service directly - hence I wanted to post here.
Delightful,"This is a ‘must go to’ place if you enjoy great food, great cocktails and fantastic service. With 4/5 different food options you are always spoilt for choice and the quality is outstanding. Apart from the great food and drink the staff make the place even more special. Always smiling, always helpful and always knowledgeable, Densyl in particular always makes time to engage and makes it his mission to look after you.

Enjoy!"
Great place to chill out,We had a great meal with family and friends at this restaurant. Great decor. White colonial! Great selection of food that everyone enjoyed. I enjoyed the Organic Chicken.Cheeseburger got good reviews as well. Good service. Definetely worth a visit.
Compliment - food and service,"This is a compliment from the heart to Cook House Dempsey for their excellent cuisine, and especially the excellent service provided by Timothy - truly outstanding!!!

Thank you, Timothy and Cookhouse Management - great to see your professionalism and service in these troubling times, please keep up the great work!!!"
At best average,"I was expecting a great experience from the brand but the ambience was noisy, service was rushed and food mediocre at the price asked. Hope the feedback from many customers will see some good changes by the management."
sunday brunch,"First time here for brunch (had dinner previously which was good) and not so impressed with the food. We ordered a Gruyère and Wild Mushroom Omelette, Crunchy Spiced French Toast, Calamari and the Grand Marnier Chocolate Chip Souffle. At $22, the omelette was much too small and gruyère was minimal. Calamari also came in a small portion but was tender and not overly-battered. The french toast was crunchy and soft, but the bacon that accompanied it too rubbery and chewy. Highlight of the meal the souffle which was perfect - light and airy."
Not as good as expected,"We loved dining at Nougatines and Jean Georges at the Bund when we stayed for several years in Shanghai, and we were looking forward to dining here.

The ambience and table settings are lovely and there is a view of the show kitchens from most tables. Service was also attentive without being overly supercilious, and staff were mindful of my wife’s allergies.

Foodwise, the experience was disappointing. My wife enjoyed the gulf shrimps appetiser (with a slight premium of $5) - the prawns were firm, sweet and nice, but the sauce was pretty one dimensional. My starter of calamari was also fresh, but I would have preferred a mayo or aioli as an accompanying sauce. The one provided was bland and could have used some heat.

My wife’s pork chops (premium $8) was okay, but tasted mostly salty, and we both did not like the brown-sauce like taste of the bacon with the jus. My veal Milanese was done well, but I felt there was a strange disconnect with the salad, though I did enjoy the liberal sprinkling of cranberries.

Dessert of deconstructed cheesecake was mostly sweet, while the chocolate cake was okay.

The bread was slightly cold."
Great food in a not so known place,"This is an unusual place, but with excellent food. Probably not for the children because of price. Great inside atmosphere."
Good Food & Good Service,"Love the food. Cheese truffle pizza, trout fish, club sandwich, egg benedict, chocolate cake, salted caramel ice cream, they were all so delicious! And thanks to the ever attentive waiter (Mohan) that make our meal even more pleasant and enjoyable! What a perfect lunch!"
"Great service, gorgeous venue, but expensive with small plates of food","We dined here in a large group, so had the option to sample many of the menu items. Some are nice enough, but most are merely average at best. However much you think you need to eat, add 50% as the portion sizes are tiny, apart from dessert oddly. You're paying all the money to hang out in a gorgeous venue and for all the staff they employ, many of which are just standing around. Totally instagrammable but go for drink Vs food!"
Hyped but the food was so Salty!,"Thought the reviews on travel advisor and google was good enough but the only thing good about this place was the Decor.

Maybe it is sunday brunch and the cooks could be the backup but the veal, pizza, calamari were just drenched with olive oil and too much salt. Worse off was their bread, which had a rancid taste.

Service was mediocre.

Won't be going back for sure."
Great ambiance,"The room is a gem and this would be a five star rating if the service were less spotty
Like all Jean Georges restaurants, the menu is imaginative and broad. The food actual,items failed to meet my expectation. That said, the cookhouse may be the best brunch in Singapore and a great atmosphere for a special occasion. Be aware it’s not cheap"
Indoor garden lunch,"Part of the COMO group and opened a years ago with the celebrity chef. Had tuna tartare, cod, snapper and clam pasta for lunch. All pretty good and a competent effort, including service. Nice garden ambience. Wonder if it can get a michelin star"
Lovely food and ambience,"This place is very nice and the food and service was surprisingly also very good.
We had lunch with a friend and we both liked it very much especialy the trout.
The only negative point is that the place is very cold.
When looking for a place in Dempsey this one is great."
Great Dinner,"We celebrated my girlfriend’s pre-bday celebration at The Dempsey Cookhouse and Bar, and they never failed to delight us. Dishes were delicious and tasty, and the service was amazing and on point. Even the Executive Chef Lisa came to our table personally to serve us and discuss about the food we have ordered. Absolutely classy! Densyl, Carly and Sommelier Djek were also caring and on top of our table to make us feel at home and comfortable. Our first try to this restaurant and will definitely be back for more occasions. Thank you."
You pay for the brand,"The best thing about this place is the elegant modern décor. The food is good, but nothing to scream about. The crackling chicken is delish; the steaks are not the most flavourful you’ve had; other mains quite ordinary. Service is friendly and professional. At over $110++ per pax, it is not great value. Essentially, you pay a hefty premium for the brand."
Another great dinner,"Had another wonderful dinner at Cookhouse. Great snapper with broth, roast cauliflower and the veal Milanese. The bread and service remain excellent."
Excellent restaurant,Excellent place to be for the evening. Excellent ambiance with beautiful setting. Excellent service - prompt and attentive but quite forgetful about orders. Excellent service recovery and apologetic. Excellent food. I love the organic chicken breast. Well done
Como Dempsey cook house,"Pretty high ceiling restaurant. Great food. Had the degustation menu and very tasty, full of flavor. Good wine selection. Must try."
Dempsey cookhouse and bar in Singapore – casual drinks before dinner,This establishment is located in a very large complex containing many restaurants and bars and it is wise to get it up on your Google map to help the taxi driver take you to the exact spot– The bar itself is in an extremely large open space with high ceilings good lighting and unusual large lights shades which are currently blue in colour – bar service was excellent and accompanied by chips nuts and popcorn – moderately priced but a good place to meet friends before moving on to dinner although I understand you can get dinner there as well– We booked and had dinner at Candlenut which is in the same great big open space but separate and operated by a different company it would seem– This whole area is worth exploring because of the wide range of restaurants and other facilities available so even if you don’t go to Dempsey – you’re likely to find somewhere else you would like
Order the Truffle Pizza,Stylish eatery which is good for brunch / lunch and dinner. Nicely curated selection of cocktails and other beverages. Highlight was the truffle pizza. Most dishes are well priced for the quality.
Maybe not worth the trip,"I went via taxi from Sentosa as a friend said Dempsey Hill had lots of places to eat and yes, you are spoilt for choice. I picked The Cookhouse but wasn’t over impressed. However is was reasonably busy and there were locals and tourists dining in couples and big groups, some celebrating birthdays etc. Maybe if I was I a group I could have picked a selection of foods to try but as I was on my own I only wanted three traditional courses, so limited my experience. What I had was ok but I wasn’t blown away by it but the service was good and the place it’s self fine but I was a bit disappointed having taken and paid out for a taxi there and back. The driver taking me didn't know this restaurant was out all the ones there so that made me think it’s not that popular possibly? I believe it use to have a MICHELIN star rating I’m not sure it does anymore, I think that reflected in the food I had
Show less"
Dinner night out,"Had a dinner recently to celebrate a birthday. The food was excellent, really loved it! Ambience was better very peaceful yet vibrant and the servers and manager were great, always paying close attention and following up with us even when we were just enjoying the meal! Overall wonderful place to visit for a good night out"
Pretentious,"Overcooked penne.
Meh burrata.
Building is beautiful but I couldn’t eat it. It’s like they were trying to make you forget you were in Asia."
First visit,"Made a reservation for my husband birthday dinner. The staff call up to confirm reservation and to remind us of the 1.5hr table sitting duration. We were usher to our sit smoothly.
We ordered the toasted egg caviar, Truffle and cheese pizza, NY stripl, Red Snapper, mango coup glacé for dessert. Everything was so good. Their service was excellent."
"Pretty place,attractive prices for set lunches..",Almost full house for lunch on a Tuesday. Book in advance for a table. Set lunches at sgd34 for two courses or sgd 42 for three courses. Some items taste good some are average. Desserts are the winners. Service is prompt and attentive. Always a wonderful place to entertain friends and business associates.
A favourite at Dempsey - great wine choices and dishes with real flavour,"Tried out the tuna tartare and went with the angel hair pasta, both of which did not disappoint. Tuna in particular was fresh and nicely flavoured - starters / appetisers seem to be a feature of the place.

The ambiance was very pleasant - we sat outside vs. inside and it was very relaxed with some chatter and laughter from the tables around.

Wine list has some good European picks, and you can spend a fortune on a bottle or two (the actual food prices overall were not bad, the wine gave the bill a fair bump though).

Service was attentive and staff appeared regularly to top up water, wine and to clear at the appropriate times.

Overall, well worth the trip and sits in the top restaurants not just around Dempsey, but in Singapore."
Great Place in Dempsey for Dinner,"Our group of 4 had dinner there to celebrate a birthday last week. The service was warm and attentive, and the food was good. The Roasted Sea Trout was delicious, the Crackling Organic Chicken awesome, and the Grilled Pork Chop excellent. The reason why I am giving the restaurant only 4 stars is because the tagliatelle with tomatoes and eggplant was not great. The pasta was overcooked and the eggplant mushy. I would highly recommend the Kale & Broccoli starter to share, as well as the side of Sauteed Corn with Manchego Cheese.

And although there is a `Pasta & Vegetarian' section in the menu, there are really only 3 vegetarian dishes available, which left the vegetarian in our party disappointed.

Reservations are required - the restaurant was full even on a Monday evening. Indoor & outdoor seating are available.

The Dempsey Cookhouse is definitely worth a visit."
Dinner with Family,"Had a dinner at the Cookhouse.
Everything was good from the aperitifs to the desserts.
Service was attentive but yet not intrusive.
Overall an excellent evening."
Not Good for Vegetarians,"Well since we are vegetarians the options of going to a fine dining restaurant are limited. In cook House too the options are very limited and the food wasn't tasty. service was very good, staff is friendly but for the price you pay the food was below average. we paid 100$+ for just a pizza, a pasta dish and pancakes for kids. The ambience is excellent and restaurant interiors are done tastefully. but because of limited options we came back disappointed."
Try. The. Warm. Shrimp. Salad,"Husband & I sat at the full-service bar. He had the cheeseburger which he says was “very good”. Praise from Caesar and all that. You know how I feel about the shrimp salad.

Service was gracious and warm and quick. Will come back again!"
Fantastic experience,"Beautiful setting, exceptional staff and a delightful Menu makes this restaurant stand out. Had lunch here and felt like a mini holiday. Can highly recommend the daily set Menu."
Great spot,"Had a lovely client lunch here. Food was decent, but the vibe and the atmosphere was the highlight. A great escape from the hustle and bustle of the central business district."
Decent fusion in former army barracks,"Part of Como at Dempsey the Cookhouse serves fusion food.

Service was good.

It could get a bit noisy.

The Sri Lankan crab on toast was a tasty light starter.

The four tiger prawns came in a hot plate and were decent portions for a main.

Worth a visit."
Great food & Great service,"We have been here a few times now for both brunch and dinner. Every time that we have been the food has been really good, well balanced and seasoned perfectly. Special shout out to Carly she's fantastic. Not only very attentive but very knowledgeable about the kitchen (her recommendations have been spot on)."
Expensive drinks in an average place,"Stopped here for a drink after dinner, nice quiet venue and weird, but comfortable seating. But the drinks are above average Singapore prices for an average venue. Nicer places in Singapore to get an expensive drink."
Classy ambience; delicious food!,"Classy colonial atmosphere; service was prompt and professional. Dishes were unique, presented well, delicious but rather pricey....well, you get what you pay for!"
Ladies Night Out,"Food was great! The truffle pizza and the Octopus. The truffle fries were good too! Wine selection is quite various.

But service is a bit slow. Continuously need to call the waiters to refill our water and wine.."
THE DEMPSEY COOKHOUSE AND BAR,great food. new food new revision. service is great the restaurant still looks great. will be back for good food.
Mouthwatering Food,"Wow the menu at the Cookhouse is fantastic. Had a good selection of starters and mains and everything was delicious. Crab toast and tuna tartare really stood out. Vegetable red curry a little bland though nice comfort food. Staff were friendly, attentive and professional."
Friend’s gathering,"Amazing food. We had quite a number of dishes to share. My personal favourite is the roasted prawns, lamb, pork chop and the shrimp salad. The dessert salted caramel is a MUST TRY, good for sharing. 😍"
The BEST is here,"My soft spot in cuisine is generally from childhood and very few places match that memory. Como Cookhouse managed to send me back with an extravagant twist. The French Toast with crispy bacon and berries and maple syrup with coffee took did just that! The ambiance, the decor, the service all blended to enhance a great brunch. I will be back when I’m next in Singapore!"
"Gem in Singapore, tropical forest setting, colonial architecture, great food","I have spent a week for business in Singapore, and was craving for some nature, colonial vibe... this gem has it all. gorgeous colonial architecture, set in the middle of the forest, only a short drive out of the busy crowded town center. excellent food (French, Italian, Fusion), great service. and just so refreshing to dine outside, among trees, with birds around. My favourite in SGP"
Fabulous restaurant,"This is a wonderful restaurant and very much recommend it.

It’s a great concept in Dempsey sharing restaurant space with other wonderful eateries like Candlenut.

We had a pre dinner drink at the bar and had an amazing boutique gin. The bar tender helped us choose based on his recommendations and it really was a wonderful drink.

The menu is wonderful. Varied and delicious. I could have eaten everything off the menu. The staff are simply excellent and know the menu exceptionally well and so can advise and guide you.

We shared 2 starters (the crab roasts and the octopus dish). Really delicious! And I had the pork chop for my main. Very well cooked and really yummy. Desserts were all delicious. My friend had the salted caramel sundae which looked epic. I had the lychee trifle which was lovely and light. Wine list was wonderful too.

All in all a wonderful choice and in a great location at Dempsey. Worth going if you want something special and a bit different."
Good casual,"We had a curated menu at a lunch event: tuna tartare; roasted beets and citrus salad with ricotta cheese; mushroom crusted sea trout and the famous - original warm chocolate lava chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.

The first two were excellent - light and bursting with flavour. The trout was a tad overcooked but otherwise very nice with the mushroom crust. The lava cake was excellent."
"Beautiful restaurant, good food","This restaurant is stunning, the staff was great, and the food was good. We came for dinner and had a great time."
Review for bar only,"We’d had lunch at Candlenut so only went to the afterwards for a cocktail. I chose to have gin and the Barnan was very knowledgeable about the different types available. The presentation of each gin with its individual garnish and mixer was a great touch, especially when ordering artisanal spirits."
cool vibe-good food,"First of all I have to commend the restaurant for the choice of Music (Something I really appreciate, when done well) rather ecletic selection that I like, KOOP, ZERO 7, QUANTIC, BOARDS OF CANADA, BONOBO ETC..ETC..Just at the right volume.
Having been to Jean Georges in Manhattan, I was very excited to try this restaurant. Having Just picked up the Easter Lamb from Hubner's was in the mood for something tasty. Not disappointed. They have a great selection of Cocktails, started with ginger Margaritta and cucumber martini, both deliscious. Some wonderful home made bread with Basso extra virgin Olive oil and Balsamic vinegar, could have eaten the whole loaf. We then chose Crispy Fish sandwich and Quiche..both came smartly and full flavour, Fish was light and crispy with spicy slaw, and quiche was rich and creamy with melt in your mouth pastry, very rich and elegant.
We chose a nice chenin Blanc from the wonderful Nederburg winery in South Africa which I have visited, a perfect accompaniment to the great Food. Then finished with profiteroles, again perfect, an unusual combination of Strawberry and passion fruit and crisp choux pastry a real delight. Service was prompt and judged to perfection in efficiency. Very nice lunch!"
Daughter’s Sweet 16th,Chose this place as my daughter loves chips and guacamole. I love the weekend brunch here. The kale and broccoli salad is one of my favorites and pizzas are all good!
Worth coming back,First time here and took the recommendations of TA Burrata and fish in broth were awesome The cherry Tomato melted in the mouth
"Cool area, fascinating history and excellent food","Recently had dinner st The Cookhouse with my son, a work colleague and his wife and another work colleague. First of all, the atmosphere and history of this facility is really interesting. Food and service was great. Alcohol a bit on pricey side due to Singapore taxes. Would highly recommend The Cookhouse for excellent food and service. For sure, make reservations."
Very good choice!,"Very good food and service. We were satisfied with all ordered food items. Pizza truffle and mozzarella were great, fritto misto,red snapper, burger, and fish mushroom were outstanding. It's hard go guess what's inside the dish but you feel the flowers all over our mouth and senses..
It is indeed overpriced but at least you get what you paying for. Decoration and location is also good!
Buon appetito"
so much flavours in everything,"fabulous lunch, will return to try more from the menu. we took only starters and they were so tasty, want to try main courses next time.Not cheap but worth the price, definitely."
Don’t order the Set Meals,"Most of us ordered the two piece set meals - SGD40 I think. I ordered a beet salad which was minuscule, nouvelle cuisine notwithstanding, plus the trout main had few vegetables and the fish was nothing special. Interestingly one person ordered a Caesar salad, not on the set menu, and it was far larger.

To quote Fawlty Towers - pretentious, moi?

Location lovely, service excellent and personable."
Recommend by friend,"It’s Thursday night, my friend suggestion to go Dempsey to have dinner and drinks.
So we were here, the food is nice and cocktails is ok. The service is very nice! Credit to one girl who service our table! Who made our dinner nicer, from recommend food, drinks and dessert!

Manager you should raise her salary!! I can give more details if needa!!"
"Lovely building, special occasion prices","This really is a terrific building and a really lovely renovation. The seating is spacious and the ambience first class. Great cocktails and friendly staff. We had a hoot with Antonio who really knew the menu.

Food was delicious but as with everything in Singapore, there is sticker shock on prices. This is NOT value for money dining ... but it is a lovely venue and we’ll be back. For a special occasion though as opposed to every Tuesday night!"
Outstanding Birthday Meal,"The staff remembered the children , the service was exemplary and the food delicious . They also produced a birthday cake for my sons special day"
Simply Great!,Intimate setting in colonial style building. Modern european cuisine that marries with oriental elements to produce exquisite dishes. I had an owesome warm prawn salad with champagne vinegrette and continued with juicy pork chop. The sommelier was very knowledgable and helpful. She helped us to choose beautiful wine to accompany our meals and evening. Bravo!
Still going strong,"I've written a couple of reviews on the Dempsey Cookhouse, they are still doing well and the food is still right up there. If you are not drinking its at a reasonable price, but I have always had a problem with the price of their wines......not unusual in Singapore. The food is very consistent and the menu tends to change a bit. They brought in Lisa a new head chef, she knows what she is doing. Its still a strong recommendation for dinner if you are in Singapore. They have some great cocktails too......I tend to eat dinner most of the time up at the bar tend to get good service there."
4th time and we'll be back for more,"We had a visitor and decided to take her here as we had been there 3 times before already and really liked it. Again, it did not disappoint. Friendly and very helpful staff (except at the counter when you arrive - this was also the case on earlier occasions), delicious food, really very nice and jummy, good wines, good vibes and atmosphere with brilliant decor and just overall a fantastic restaurant to go with friends. We will surely be back and we will not wait that long this time around!"
Amazing customer recognition,"This was my fourth visit to this restaurant and each time I am blown away by their customer recognition. Knowing my name, acknowledging me and my colleagues to the point of bringing a complimentary dessert - every staff member is “on”. Keep up the great work! I know it is driven by a customer loyalty program but so many places dont manage this process like Como does. Oh. The Kale salad is the best on the island!! Thanks team."
Lunch with friend,"First time. Feels welcome and nice ambience. Had the 2 course lunch, choose either an appetizer, a main or a main and dessert. Lunch set comes with either tea or coffee. Had the Trout as main. Smooth mashed potato and the doneness (medium well) of the trout was just nice for me although the server advised that the chef will usually cook it to medium. My friend had the Organic Chicken. I tasted a little, it was juicy and the skin was crispy. Taste great too. The dessert, Coconut panna cotta impressed me. Loved the coconut taste, just nice not overwhelming and the texture is smooth. Happy to have tried their food. Shall return for more."
Nice place to unwind,Always packed. Reservation is a must. Nice food. Been there couple of times. Fish can be better. Nice ambience
Service not there,"Food and ambience were good but service was lackluster. Need to call out to service staff several times before they could take our orders, refill water etc. Not sure whether it was understaff that night."
Nice place in a great little area,"Had lunch here after having dinner the evening before at ""Betelnut"" (excellent place). Dempsey is a really nice, energetic atmosphere, good menu with variety of offerings. Great atmosphere for brunch or lunch and some drinks. The area is a small 'development' of several restaurants and also a fashion/cultural center which is quite cool if you're into higer-end 'hip' international fashion (e.g. lots of cool Japanese and European designers of street wear, shoes etc). The food at Demsey was very good, prices a bit high, but not bad for Singapore. Cool crowd, good service. Recommend."
