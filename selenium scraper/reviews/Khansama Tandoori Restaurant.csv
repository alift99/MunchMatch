Authentic Indian,Very good meal in the hustle and bustle of Little India. Travelling solo and stopped by for a quick meal. Curry was very good and the indoor-outdoor feel was ideal for the weather in Singapore in December. Staff were very friendly and easy for deal with. Would definitely visit again. Next time with friends so that I can try more options on the menu.
Always consistent,Best Indian food in Singapore for my opinion. We are living in Singapore for more than a decade and this is the only Indian food that satisfy our cravings.
Great service. Very friendly staff.,"We picked this restaurant because it was very close to our hotel. It was a good choice. Excellent food, generous portions, just right amount of spice for me. Will eat here again next time I'm in Singapore."
One of the better North Indian food place,"One of the better place to have North Indian food and moderately priced Food is too oily though, good for large group, and serves alcohol as well"
Disappointing with staff,"Was recommended by friend as this restaurant seems had good review.
But then very disappointed after we paid a visit.
Food was just okay, not too nice nor bad.
What disappointed us is that their staff is lack of courtesy.
They didn't even respond to ""thank you"" after payment is make."
"Order mix up, non veg dish sent 🙄","Kids wanted to order north indian veg for lunch and then placed the order on the food panda app online. to our shock, instead of the vegetarian dish, they sent us a non vegetarian dish. extremely disappointed and shocked/ surprised on the same. restaurants handle all sorts if order all the time, but such mistakes are not expected. I don't think I will ever order or visit this place."
Take away order not fullfilled,"Our whole family ordered their food around 6pm, waited for 2+hours in hunger saw no trace of our delivery. Tried to contact the restaurant but no avail after a few calls. The restaurant told our order was not taken in, our food panda app showed delivery on the way. This is the second time our delivery was delayed. It was so disappointed."
Could have been much better,"Portions of meat were a good size. Samosa well made . But butter chicken had a smoky flavour as if spices had been overcooked and both curries had not been heated through so they were lukewarm, tasting as if 'gravy had been added to the meat' rather than cooked together. Service was good , but the curries made the visit less than satisfactory"
Excellent food with outstanding service,The food was good as always. I always go there for the grilled items and the chaat. The service staff are friendly and accommodating.
Disappointing.,"Saw this highlighted in the top 10 on several reviews so I thought we'd give it a try.
Very disappointed with the quality of the food.
The starters looked nothing like the menu photos e.g. the chaat was just a few crispy bits in a sea of yoghurt.
The lamb masala was so hot it was impossible to finish (I've been eating Indian food for 40 years so I know when something is spiced correctly and when it's ridiculously lathered with chilli so you can't even taste the meat).
If give this place a miss."
Superb indian Punjabi taste,Very nice and delicious food Superb quantity and value equals to quality I visit many restaurants in Little India but all are too waste of time and money Khansama is best for North Indian Tandoori cuisine
Over priced bad food,"Having Tandoori in your name you'd expect its their strong point.

Sadly not.

Dry chicken lacking flavour.

Butter chicken was over priced small portion which was overly sweet and chicken also dry.

Garlic nann was worst bread I've seen and 0 garlic.

Really poor.

$55 inc boiled rice, terrible."
Worst Experience and Feeling Cheated for Extremely poor service,"I have a negative feedback. On last Wedensday (Feb. 9) I went to your restaurant at Science Park with my colleagues. We occupied a table and order our food. By the time food arrived we found many cockroaches around our table. We changed the table, food arrived and while we are taking our food we found cockroaches again on chairs and below our table. We left the food. I called staff and manager and show them the situation. We were feeling degusting by this and left our food. To my surprise the staff charged us for such horrible experience. Then I paid but I am feeling cheated and disappointed.

Given rating of one as that is the minimum possible as an option."
"Decent service, nice ambience, ok food","The punjabi curries are amazing.. their chaats are not so great.. so when u go there, order all the punjabi curries! very good. But dont waste time on the chaats.."
very poor service,"the beer was ok.. the food was mediocre.. the service was poor.. We went there to have a good time on a friday evening. But, it soon turned into one of the worst .."
The Best,"The best Indian Restaurant I've ever been to. Service is always great and the setting is nice, sat outside in the hustle and bustle of Little India. Even something bland like a Butter Chicken is super delicious, still to not find anything to compare."
Spice Up,"This is our to-go place for deliciously spicy Indian fare. The chicken tandoori is tender & moist. Best of all, it’s skinless too.
The soft Paneer tikka is best eaten with the refreshing mint sauce.
Likewise, the butter chicken is an orgasmically succulent fillets bathed in thick fragrant curry.
The mixed vegetables curry is a tad too spicy so clear the heat with mango lassi.
Servings are decent, prices are a bit steep but still good value for the quality."
Best Indian Restaurant in Little India,"Traditional Indian food and consistently good quality and value. When visiting we always look to sit indoor and upstairs at it feels more like a restaurant and I prefer the air condiytioning when eating, however, for the authentic feel, downstairs and on the street may suit you better. Don't miss the Chicken 65 which is spicy and amazing, so much so we had two portions during our last visit. A little dissapointed by the lamb vindaloo as not as spoicy as I had hoped but will give it a try again on the next visit. Definitely a go to place in Singapore for an excellent Indian meal at good prices."
Long waiting time,We waited for more than an hour for our food. Food was good other than the mutton curry being too salty.
One of the better North Indian food place,"One of the better place to have North Indian food and moderately priced Food is too oily though, good for large group"
Takeaway,Ordered takeaway dinner for the family which was confirmed by email and over 2hrs later still no delivery. To make matters worse the restaurant hasn't answered the phone and I've called 30 times. Disgraceful customer service. Surely if the food is delayed a simple call or message would have been reasonable from a business that cared about the customer. Why support a local business during these difficult times when they clearly hold the satisfaction of a customer's all in such contempt.
Crap Delivery and Disloyal Management,"Terrible delivery service. They are only looking for your money and there seems to have been a change in manager/person who picks up the phone on calling their number. About a week ago, when I asked for chicken dum biryani, I got nice, saucy curry inside my biryani. However, when I ordered today, not only was the biryani cold, but it had DRY CHICKEN, as if boiled without seasonings (yuck). Adding insult to injury, the person on the phone told my family to add an extra item for $50 minimum charge with free delivery whereas last week the person was kind enough to do free shipping on $48. Truly horrible delivery service with terrible, dry biryanis and terrible management. Please considering going back to your old, not-so-stingy ways so the restaurant can be a success. Posting this everywhere so everyone knows about your crappy service (my day is ruined and my disappointment is immeasurable)."
FOOD GOOD BUT PRICEY,"The restaurant is large, two stories high and the menu is quite extensive. The Tandoori Chicken and Chicken Tikka were very good but portions were small. The naan we as excellent but the portions small. Overall the food was very good but the restaurant is very touristy with high prices."
Great Indian Dishes,"Ate at Khansama Tandoori Restaurant at 166 Serangoon Rd at junction of Norris Rd. We shared Aloo Tikki, mixed veggie Pakora (6 pcs), garlic & butter Naan and Mutton Kebab. Several sauces and yogurt were provided with the dishes. Several different spices and flavors tickled the taste buds. Very interesting dishes and very tasty. Washed it all down with two large Heineken beers."
Amazing food!,"When I want to eat Indian food there are very few places that come to mind. Khansama is one of those places. The food is amazing, there is honestly nothing that can be faulted when it comes to the food. The service is also very good. The staff is incredibly attentive. The only thing that I would like to see a change in would be the furniture that they have...it is aesthetically fitting the theme of the restaurant, but it feels like it may just break apart! It feels dangerous and the furniture is incredibly heavy too. So it’s really difficult to push back the chair to get up and when you do manage to do that then there is the added fear that it will just break. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone I know. But I will most probably take away the food."
Very good food,Food is really good. Some of the tables on the pavement are a bit grubby but service good and they have revamped to create more outdoor space. However the food is excellent. Been a few times and the last time we went the food was even better than previously.
Just around the corner from,"Just around the corner from the Hilton Garden Inn is a brilliant Indian restaurant called Khansama. Fantastic food, service, and beer, all at a reasonable price especially for Singapore. Well worth a visit. J"
Very tasty!,"Slice of India in Singapore. Visited little India after a craving me and my wife had on honeymoon. Which was satisfied at this restaurant.

Authentic traditional Indian cuisine which resonated with home.

Well located in centre of little India and brilliant customer service.

Would highly recommend."
Best Indian in Little India,Whilst in Little India I asked a local 'which is the best Indian restaurant around here. Without hesitation she directed me to Khansama. It didn't disappoint.... great authentic dishes and wonderful friendly service. Highly recommended.
Great food as we sheltered from the rain,We had seen a gentleman on the other side of the road promoting the Khansama Tandoori Restaurant and as it started to rain we were walking past it and the friendly staff ushered us in to a table. The menu is extensive with over 25 pages of food and drink choices. I ordered chicken biryani and they offered a less spicy masala sauce. They also did a special lemon tea with no sugar which wasn’t on the menu. We enjoyed chicken biryani and egg biryani with a chick pea and spinach side dish. We asked about the size of the plain naan bread and were told to order just one and see how we go. We did end up ordering a second naan and it was light and crispy. The meal was delicious and so much more authentic than Indian food in the UK. Excellent value. The staff all came over in turn to chat with us and were friendly.
Amazing,Amazing food and service and a must in Little India to get a true authentic flavour of your surroundings. Well worth the walk along the street.
"Delicious Food, warm hospitality, great vibe !","Super-delicious North-Indian food. Perfect aroma, perfect blend of spices, served in right portions and with a lot of warmth. All snacks and tandoori items are great – kebab platter and Chicken-Tikka are my favorites. Main-course is good too. Energetic bunch of servers, wearing a smile and doing their best to expedite your order. Don’t miss the Kingfisher Premium Beer and enjoy the Indian music in the background."
Lifesaving find!,"We happened upon this restaurant while doing a self-guided day tour of Singapore by Hop on Hop off bus. We were hot, tired and in need of some food but given my food sensitivities I am always cautious. This place was a gift. We were immediately given a curbside table and made very comfortable with extremely attentive service. My needs were heard and the chef prepared delicious food which did not contain gluten or dairy which I need to avoid, especially when travelling. We found this by sheer luck but were reassured to see Trip Advisor and Yelp stickers on their entry so that we gave it a try. They certainly deserve the accolades they regularly receive."
Food was terrific. The tandoori,Food was terrific. The tandoori pamfret was amazing! We also ordered the mutton biryani and butter chicken which were great. Biryani was moist and came with extra gravy. Staff was awesome. They even helped with a taxi as Grab was not working.
Top curry,Great Indian food! Friendly staff! Lots of locals dining is probably the best review! Would go back in a second!
Excellent Indian Food,"We enjoyed lunch here while shopping in Little India. One of the culinary highlights of our trip. Food and service was excellent. My husband has traveled to India several times and said this food was true to Indian cuisine. Interesting non-alcoholic drink options and Indian beers. Air conditioned upstairs room, or ""on the street"" patio experience downstairs in open air. It was not too hot or humid so we enjoyed sitting outside in casual open atmosphere."
Firstfamilyindia,Average restaurant with average taste and exorbitant prices.Taste is average and portion sizes is okay.Ambience is also nothing great.Can eat in half the money at other places like Delhi restaurant and Komala restaurant on the same road and at almost same price in better restaurant like Kailash parbat near Hilton village inn on same road.
cheese kebab,"Nice food specially cheese kebab they were recommended by my son in law, they did taste good, very busy place friendly staff and good service"
Best little Indian restaurant in Little India,"Excellent curry, and great advice. We visited the place twice - on two different visits to Singapore. The advice we got was what the staff there preferred, with further recommendations on other curry's. If it was not so far from the UK, we would visit the place more often. Rainy season outside, comfortable and dry inside. All the staff are very friendly and helpful."
Great Indian Food in Singapore,We had lunch here and it was really good. The Tandoori chicken and butter chicken were both delicious. We would definitely go back.
OCC Review of Khansama Oct 18,"On Thursday 18th October 2018 – The OCC visited Khansama Tandoori Restaurant, Little India.
Khansama, situated on the junction between Serangoon Road and Norris Road, spans over 2 storeys. The ground floor offering casual, outdoor dining synonymous with Little India where the hustle & bustle of the car and foot traffic adds to the authentic dining experience. The upstairs is a quieter, slightly more formal dining room with the benefit of Aircon!
For full transparency see below scores (out of 10)
Quality: 7.5
Customer care: 8

Value: 7.75 (the bill was about S$75 per head however did include an irresponsible amount of beer and a round of house specialty cocktails)
Service: 8.25

Atmosphere: 7.75

Overall: 7.85
Khansama IS AWARDED the much-coveted OCC sticker of recommendation

As this was the inaugural meeting of the Singapore branch of the OCC there was a fair bit of admin to attend to prior to ordering. The attentive waiting staffs were happy to provide poppadum’s and ice cold Tiger beers before allowing us the time and space needed to attend to our clerical duties. The Indian chopped salad adorning the poppadum’s was a nice touch and went some way to negate the fact that only a green chutney was offered as an accompanying sauce. Throughout the evening the wait staff adeptly struck the balance between attentive service and not overcrowding or hurrying us. This was especially appreciated by one group member who having consumed his fourth raw chilli fine of the evening urgently requested “YOGURT, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD YOGURT!” The waitress flying into action and coming back with a bowl of raita which was quickly slurped up before any lasting intestinal damage was done.

Turning our attention to the task at hand, ordering starters, we were a little intimidated by the vastness of the menu. In my experience an overly busy menu can sometimes be the downfall of a restaurant but in this instance I am pleased to note that the old adage ‘Jack of all trades, master of none’ did not apply. The starters of Paneer, Tandoori Gobi and Chicken tikka arrived promptly. Portion size was good as was the quality, with the Paneer being noteworthy in its’ texture and tastiness.

With the restaurant now quite full, the waitress wearing out the floor between our table and the bar took the initiative to offer us an ice bucket of beers, and quickly set up a side table with the additional beers and chilled beer mugs. This was very much appreciated.

Back to the mega menu to order mains and after much page turning we ordered Yellow Daal, along with a chicken, a mutton and a vegetable curry with ample sides of breads and rice. These again arrived promptly and were well presented and were very tasty.

Half way through our mains our waitress suggested we try the signature highball cocktail. Challenge accepted. Refreshing and quite punchy, these were a well-received round off to a very enjoyable meal.

We were greeted by the manager as we were leaving and he was keen to know if we had enjoyed our evening and encouraged us to come back again. All in all a very enjoyable experience and a strong start to the OCC in Singapore."
Never Disappoints,"When it comes to Indian Multi Cuisine place , I think of KHANSAMA as the best choice ..!!
Menu Choices are amazing & dishes are made with perfection too.

I like the Chaats, Biryani & Daal Makanhi

Lastly

5 star to the Moong Daal Halwa which now I don’t hv to order —they know I m here for it ...!!

Overall great team & good stuff

Would keep coming ..keep it up —best wishes

Thank you"
Delicious vegetarian food,"I ate dinner here twice during my business trip to Singapore in October 2019. I sat outdoors and you are near hustling and bustling Serangoon Road. There is also an indoor seating and dining area upstairs. I had palaak paneer (a spinach dish), basmati rice, onion naan and a mango lassi the first time I went there. The second time I went there I had dal (a lentil dish), basmati rice, onion naan and a strawberry lassi. The food and service were very good. The server explained to me the difference between ""Deepawali"" and ""Diwali"". Both words are used for the Festival of Lights but ""Deepawali"" is used in South India and ""Diwali"" is used in North India. So I learned something in addition to the delicious food."
What an amazing place!,"Let me start saying that this is the best Tandoori Indian restaurant I have ever tried before.

The service was absolutely amazing especially for somebody who does not know. About the 26 pages of the menu. They took the time to explain to us but more important what we were expecting.

If you are coming to little India in Singapore, this place is a must."
Fabulous food,Excellent friendly staff ~ Fabulous food really enjoyed the meal ~ I would certainty recommend the tandoori prawns
Love this place,"I eat at Khansama in Little India all the time. Whenever I stay at the Hilton Garden Inn, I can walk over in 5 minutes. Usually, I sit upstairs where there is air conditioning unless the weather is not too hot. I love the boneless Tandoori chicken, the Masala Papad and the Paneer Butter Masala. Knock that down with a Kingfisher. It's the best!"
A good restaurant which is pathetic in delivery,"The food of Khansama is fairly good. But I have mostly gotten delivery from this restaurant. They claim to deliver throughout Singapore, please do not fall for this. They never use the delivery features of Grab or Deliveroo or Food Panda and they are pathetic in the delivery. A promised time of 45 min can easily become 1.5 h to 1 h 45 min. You will be waiting for the food for ever. The food is fairly okay, not fantastic or anything. That is why I stopped at 2 stars"
Average at best!!,"Took my wife and children to Little India to check out the Deepavali festivities and to have dinner. We decided on Khansama as we had read very good reviews of the restaurant, friendly staff and extremely tasty food!! The restaurant itself has an undercover eating area downstairs and an upstairs air conditioned dining area. The menu is extensive (perhaps too many options) with all the usual suspects you’d expect from an Indian restaurant. We ordered some onion bhajia and samosa to start, followed by Butter Chicken, Korma and Tikka Masala curries with plain rice, roti and naan. I must be missing something though. For me, the food was ordinary where the taste didn’t meet the expectation! The Korma sauce for example tasted more like “hot milk” whilst everything seemed to have a hint of being “smoked”!! The restaurant itself was also very dirty especially the tables whilst the toilets were disgusting - don’t go unless you absolutely have too! Yes the staff were friendly and yes, you could sit there and soak up the atmosphere but the restaurant and meal (for me) were a huge disappointment! There are plenty of other restaurants up and down the road - next time, we shall try one of them!!"
Tasty Indian food!,"Solid 4.5 stars. Came here for dinner during the week. Was pretty crowded even on a Tuesday, but we managed to get seated pretty quick. It reminds you of restaurants in the 90s in India (in a good way). We got the hara bhara kebab and aloo tikki chaat to start off with. Was very tasty especially the kebab. Had garlic naan and paneer butter masala for mains, again very tasty and very fresh. I was super impressed, and will be back to try their non-veg options soon!"
Great Local Restaurant,"We had just arrived from an inbound flight, and after checking into our hotel needed something to eat.
Walking down the main street, as with other restaurants, the staff were out looking for customers.
There is an undercover outdoor dining section on the street level, however we went up the stairs to the main dining area with air conditioning.
Staff were friendly, and gave us a few tips on Little India.
Food was authentic as expected in Little India, having the Chicken and Muttin Biryani dishes.
As this is upstairs, not sure if there is a lift available for wheelchairs or pushchairs.
Not too badly prices, until we found the Tekka Centre foodcourt lol"
"Nice service , good food good !!","The waiter was very nice , prawn curry superb ,but I never seen the dirtiest toilet in my life Disgusting !!! You serve food!!!"
Dinner,"We had an early one, just after 5.00pm.
There was five of us, and the meals varied fron chicken tikka and butter checken to mutton vindaloo, all with garlic naan bread, vemosa's and vegetable fried rice.
Everone thoroughly enjoyed their meal, and struggled to eat it all
Their sevice was great, and we found them very freindly and chatty.
Would highly recommend."
Fabulous Restaurant!!,"We love Khansama! We had dinner there three evenings during our week’s stay in Singapore just as we did during our previous stay. It’s really that good! We liked everything, especially the lamb curry, tandoori chicken, the paneer tikka and the Chana Masala, among many other delicious dishes. The service was excellent, too. Akash, our waiter, was wonderful, very helpful and personable. We highly recommend this restaurant!"
One of the best indian cuisines around,"Whether its lunch or dinner, this restaurant never fails to get me like ‘wow’. Truly one of the best indian cuisines around. My all time favorite is the palak paneer, pani puri and butter chicken. Although the food is a bit rich with cheese but the taste is unmatched. The restaurant also presents a very royal looking indian ambience. Highly recommended"
Meeting Customer Expectations,"Was there yesterday as part of a company dinner gathering. Due some booking error on our side, our reservation for 25 pax was at a different branch of the restaurant. However the management team of the restaurant quickly contacted the other branch and got the copy of our booking and pre ordered menu. They arranged and accommodated all of us for dinner albeit their restaurant was quite busy. Kudos to the Khansama team at Little India. They managed to prepare and serve the food quite promptly. Food was good and we all enjoyed our dinner. This is what I call going the extra mile to satisfy customer. Would highly recommend this place due to the attitude they demonstrated even without a booking. Please book in advance and you will get even better service."
Good food,Very satisfied with our meals. Would definitely eat here again! We over ordered because meals are bigger than what we get at home (keep that in mind if on a budget)
Great Indian Located in Little India Singapore,"Located in Little India Singapore, in our experience this is a very good little restaurant, we visited twice during our week here, the staff were a bit miserable and service was a bit topsy turvey but the food quality, quantity and flavours were quite superb!
Our starter course tended to be served the same time or later than the mains so I would suggest if you expect differently to advise your waiter at point of order.
Lots of staff there but none looked very happy they were all quite somber, but these are the only two things I feel they need addressing, apart from that, quite amazing tasty fair priced food. Enjoy."
"Tastless food, high price","I have been to many Indian restaurants over south east Asia, this is one place I wound't return. The staff is nice and friendly, but very pushy with the orders.

For two people, it will cost at least SGD 70 plus taxes. The main issue was the food did not have a real taste. The mushroom we ordered just tasted like water.

Will not revisit."
"Attentive, service with a smile","Khansama Tandoori Restaurant in Singapore’s Little India was a lucky find during our visit. The menu is extensive. Something for everyone! Service is attentive, prompt, and extremely polite. We loved the Chicken Manchurian and Aloo Matar 💓"
Truly excellent value for the price,"I dined at Khansama twice during a recent trip to Singapore because the food was so good. Very prompt and friendly service, the wait staff were conversant with suitable options for a coeliac, and the food came out steaming hot and very quickly after we placed our orders. Try the tandoori chicken and the paneer saag!"
"Over Priced, Small Portions But Good Food Nonetheless","The solicitations to make you their customer start when you pass by Khansama on the street. The upstairs A/C sitting is good. The waiters are courteous and friendly.

We've been here twice because of the quality of the food but it left us desired for more, because, small portions for the price we paid.

Waiti time is not much and food arrived quickly. The prices for Roti's, Naan's and other accompaniments is very high. Imagine ordering a Paneer dish worth $15 (excluding taxes) and 3 roti's along side, the bill for roti's shall surpass the entire bill amount. To top it over, GST and Service Charge!!

This place is very expensive considering the quantity of food they have on offer. Many other alternates nearby to explore."
I love this place!,"I discovered this place on my first work trip to Singapore 2 years ago. Now everytime im in Singapore I always make sure I visit this place at least once.
I live in London, which has great curry everywhere, but there is nowhere as good as Khansama. Every dish i've tried has been incredible. Last week I made my seventh trip to this restaurant and when im in town again, I will definitely be going for the 8th.

You should definitely try this place."
"Good, average service",We opted for the air conditioned upstairs space. No atmosphere and lots of staff. Food was good and prices ok. Menus were tatty and staff not bubbly or friendly.
Good Food and Bad staff attitude,"We ordered Naan + Mixed Kababs + Lamb Biryani + Lemon Soda + Tiger Beer. Food was great, except Biryani (it is colored rice with good quantity and quality of Lamb).

The guy attended us was discourteous and could have just put little smile on his face and guide us with some choice of food."
My favorite Indian in Singapore,"Great food, generous portions, speedy service - I really like this restaurant. Very wide menu selection, so lots of choice for spicy or mild, vegetarian or carnivore, curry fiend or tandoori lover.

Both air-conditioned and outdoor seating available.

Also they serve Guinness, as well as the usual boring lagers."
Tourist rip-off place,"Tourist rip-off place. Avoid. If they can tell that you are a tourist then they will tell you how famous they are and then hand you a paper menu with higher prices. For example, garlic naan for S$4.50 that sells for half that price elsewhere. At least ask to see their regular/formal menu and you can save a little money."
Best Tandoori Food,"Best tandoori food. The restaurant is expensive, but the taste is great. They have a bar and the ambience is mind blowing."
Good Indian restaurant,I really liked Indian food. Staff is hospitable. Sitting though is in open but good food covers everything
Authentic Indian food,"Little India is changing. About 10 years ago, you could find an idli joint in every corner. It’s good to see some options for those who like North Indian food. The prices are decent, the beer is chilled and the service quick. Now if only they could replace those rickety chairs and tables with something a bit more comfortable. But good enough to return."
Fabulous Indian food,Eaten at many Indian restaurants but the taste here is just something different! Veey authentic North Indian taste and very good variety. The service is sometimes chaotic with waiters not knowing whether to seat people upstairs or downstairs and food takes longer than usual to arrive. But it is still worth the wait.
Best Indian food we had in Singapore,"Greeted by pleasant waitirs, got a table outside and served up cold beer straight away, starters of mixed tandoori chicken and sheesh kebab, main of prawn curry, chicken tikka masala and garlic naan and rice. To be honest there was to much food but it was to good to leave, they did offer a to go box, but hotel may not have been to impressed
They also do a delivery service to anywhere in the city, worth remembering
We’ll be back, great place to eat"
Little India for lunch,"We sat at street level under cover and got the breeze from a ceiling fan. Very pleasant. As you'd expect from the Indians, service very prompt."
Good food but bad service,"We were looking for a good Indian Restaurant that night. It met our expectations regarding the food but the service was disappointing for us. The waiter was standing the whole time beside our table and asked already after 1 minute what we would like to eat. Furthermore, other waiters were starring at us at the same time. It was un uncomfortable feeling for us. At the end we felt that they were craving for tips which is a no-go!

Keep the good food up but change the service manners or teach them at least how not to be intrusive."
Excellent food,During our visit to little India we stopped here for lunch. This was some of the best Indian food I have ever had. Service is efficient and friendly. Butter chicken and mixed vegetables were incredible. It was my mistake but wish I would have ordered my veggies a little hotter but the flavors and sauces were exceptional. They also have fairly priced wine.
Best north india punjabi food in Singapore,We are a regular visitor here and this is our goto place when we crave for punjabi food. The curries and servings are decently balanced on spices and would surely satisfy all palates and is great value for money.
Overhyped and definitely not worth the wait!,"Came here because my friend had a naan and butter chicken craving. This place showed up at the top of our Google search with 1000+ reviews so we thought we wouldn’t go wrong.

Famous last words, I’d say. We were afraid of over-ordering and made it clear to the waiter multiple times as he was taking our order but he kept recommending more dishes and reassuring us that the portions were small. We also asked for mutton chunks for one of the dishes but ended up with mutton sausages instead? The naan was average (tried the garlic, onion and cheese naan) and the butter chicken and mutton left much to be desired. Papadum was crispy and tasty but literally dripping with oil.

But what really frustrated us was the waiting time. We had to wait almost 30min for the first glimpse of food on our table. Even after that dish came (yoghurt), we had to wait another 15min before the rest appeared. The restaurant wasn’t even that busy when we were there.

The drinks were their only saving grace. Blu Coffee was good (ask for the non-sugar, non-milk option if you’re not a fan or overly-sweet things) and their special Lemonade was a good find.

But honestly, everything else paled in comparison. The place was also occupied by tourists rather than locals or Indians. Should have been a warning sign for us. My friend also commented that the decor is confusing, as there were Chinese lanterns and Christmas lights amidst flower garlands??

Think twice before you head there. Personally, I wouldn’t go back again."
Indian food better than india !,"We have eaten here at every visit to Singapore and it never fails to please us !
There’s a wide selection of dishes but the tandoori mushroom and dal makhani are outstanding. So is their paneer tikka and their cheese garlic naan and other breads
Comparable to any good restaurant in india !
Must eat when you are craving North Indian good in Singapore !"
Good Indian food,"We spent a week in the Little India area and ended up having dinner at this place thrice. The food quality as well as portion is good and the taste is very Indian. Pair it with a local beer and you get a dhaba type experience.

Recommended for Indian travelers looking for North Indian food."
"Too much hyped, but moderate food & poor service","The food is good but the service is pathetic. They do not serve you food if asked to and say it’s self service but charge service charge!!

Please avoid as you will end up paying the GST and the service charge also on top of that if you are on a budget which is like another 15$ on a bill of 100$

There are 2 people who have French beard who take orders and they simply show highhandedness. Also do not get fooled around by local taxi or your tour operators telling you that you will get a discount. There is none such..

All the tables are literally shaky and give a creaky sound."
Delicious,"The food at Khansama was absolutely delicious. The naan, the butter chicken, samosas, bhendi, and all the other dishes we tried were fabulous. Can’t wait to eat here again"
Yet another visit,"Visited again with friends to have the Biryani , Moong Daal Halwa & Gajjar ka Halwa . Will see me more often Always happy to be at Khansama Thank you"
Excellent,"The food here was excellent. Someone was handing out flyers for this place near the temple so we thought we'd give it a try. It was about 5pm and not too busy. We had tandoori starters and a tikka main. The food was impressive, much more that I expected. I would highly recommend anyone in this area to come here for lunch or dinner. Staff are also very friendly."
Fantastic food,"Really great food, although pricey it was worth while. If cheaper would eat here a lot more. We had 3 dishes, 2 kebabs and a curry - all fantastic and good with the heat being hot as asked"
Below average,"The staff outside trying to lure you in are the friendliest .. well it ends there
We dined upstairs .. the server seemed least intrested in taking orders .. when asked for #bharwank bhindi said not available.. so I asked which other bharwan is available as they had 4/ 5 variants listed as their speciality .. he said any will take 30 minutes to prepare so .. that means the bhindi was available.. since I decided to wait I asked to place the order .. it surprisingly was rather 1st to arrive in 10 mins then rest if the order and looked and tasted more like 5 to 6 peices of okra slaped with thick masala gravy on top .. he messed rest of my partner's order as well .. masala chass and salted lassi both below average
The butter garlic nan was the only thing really good .
Chicken starters dry .
Extremely poor service"
Average rather than outstanding and expensive,"We ordered fish tikka which was expensive but nice, chickpeas (big serving), mixed chaat, raita and garlic naan (great) This with 3 beers came to just over $100 including service and tax. It's been a while since I paid that much for Indian food. Ok but I wouldn't rush back."
"Poor service, food was average","My wife and I were looking for a good tandoor restaurant but we were very disappointed. We ordered the mixed Chats which were inedible, the tandoori chicken was so spicy we couldn’t eat it. We also ordered the dhal which was bland and tasteless. Not recommended. We paid $64 dollars and had only a few mouthfuls before we walked out. Wasted money. The naan bread was fine but that was the only up side."
Quite Good but not the Best,"We had dinner here, it is a spacious restaurant with quiet upstairs and a bit crowded noisy downstairs. We opted upstairs where all the tables were cranky. Food was good but overpriced."
Over rated and over priced,"Went here because of the good write ups and ratings. The menu was huge and impressive however the food was average. The pepper chicken had little depth of flavour - I think reflects the fact that it was added to a cooked sauce to enable delivering such a large selection of dishes. The service was not great and the waiters looked like they wanted to be anywhere else but there. Beware, the prices on the menu don't include taxes or service charges - this adds another 17%. Had much better food in the Tekka centre"
Very good food,The chicken curry was identical to my grandmothers! Food was brilliant and I didn’t feel bloated like most Australian Indian restaurants! Staff are also fantastic! Really enjoyed everything!
Tasty North Indian food,Busy Friday night sat upstairs in cool AC. Buzzy atmosphere. Lots of choices for vegetarians. Favourite dish was a chick pea flavoursome curry. Well priced for Singapore. Service surly but attentive.
Amazing Food,"After a tiring day, one needs a good meal to end the day and go to bed.
Well if you are looking for good food, this is the place to go.
With soooo much variety of food , drinks and deserts on the menu, you won’t regret visiting this place.
Quality and taste of food is excellent and the originality of taste is maintained.
Service is also very good. Everyone is polite and helpful.
Well done guys, keep it up."
Delicious!!!!,"This was recommended to us by a local as his favourite Indian in little India. He was right. Some of the nicest Indian food I’ve ever tasted. Very good Dahl and tarka masala, and of course the tandoori chicken was amazing. We sat street side and it had a good buzz and atmosphere all evening. If like us you love a good curry then you won’t be disappointed."
Worst service ever,"Ordered from this restaurant via Deliveroo app. Not only did the restaurant not follow up on my order, they blame the system for the delay in delivering the food! Called the first time and was told by one of your staff that the food was on its way and I should give another 5-10mins. Waited another 20 mins to give the benefit of traffic, was told that my order did not exist! And claimed that my order was missed due to a second order request that came in shortly after mine. How convenient it is to blame the system. Humans invented the system, fault lies in humans so don’t blame your system when your staff overlooked. Have never tried their food and probably never will."
"Good food, average service","We selected this place based on TripAdvisor reviews, but please note that some Singapore reviews are not as accurate as the reviews in US or EU. The food was good, but definitely not at the level we expected, especially for the price we paid. Next time I would go for small family restaurants, much more authentic and well priced.

That said, please don't get me wrong, the food is not bad.

Now the service problem - I forgot to get my check and change of about S$35, totally my bad, because I went out for smoke and the check wasn't on the table when I was back. When leaving no waiter pointed that we didn't get our change, after all the amount was way above any possible tip levels, but I didn't notice my mistake until 3-4 hours later. When I got back to the restaurant, I was given some run aground, but Management finally paid me the missing change. What made me extremely unhappy wasn't the original rejection to pay, but the way the payment was given to me. Apparently, it was said that this was first such issue, and the Management wasn't able to confirm who had my money, indirectly pointed that could also be me... great disappointment especially for Singapore, one of the country's with the highest cost for crimes. Please be careful!!!"
One of the best indian food in Little India,"This is absolutely better restaurant as compared to other INDIAN restaurant in Little India, nice North Indian food"
Very good food,"We came across this restaurant whilst having a wander around Little India, we only went for a drink but looking at the food coming out of the kitchen we booked to come back the next night. I’m very pleased to say it was excellent. By far the best Indian food I’ve eaten. Staff were friendly and the price was good (for Singapore). I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it."
Amazing indian food,"I love the food even the place is not very fancy. Service is OK, but the food is worth to go to Little India."
Great Food!!,"Went for an early dinner and was not disappointed. Staff very friendly and food superb. We probably ordered too many starters but the meat on the sharing platter was delicious- have never had such tender chicken.
Mains were also good - Prawn Jalfrezi was pleasantly hot and spicy without being too much. Would definitely visit again."
Excellent food,"We ate our first dinner of Singapore here.
Awesome food!!! We had the best chicken biryani ever and best butter chicken too.
It was so tasty that we had dinner there for 3 days during our 6 days long stay in Singapore. All dishes have decent rates, not so expensive.
Very humble staff and nice seating by the road of Little India.
Must try dishes: Chicken Biryani, Butter chicken and chicken tikka.
For drinks: they have beers and other drinks at decent rates, Mojito was my favorite."
Amazing 🥰,"Butter chicken and veggie tikka masala spot on 😊 beautiful food, efficient service and overall great experience!! I'm really glad we took a gamble and went in without checking reviews beforehand as well worth it"
