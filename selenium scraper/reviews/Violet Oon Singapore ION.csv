Modern twists on classic dishes,"We didn't know what to expect when we sat down at this restaurant in the middle of a mall. Not your typical fine dining locale but because of how it's situated you forget the throngs of people that are out of view.

The beef rendang is a favorite dish of mine and this one was incredible. Great flavors and texture. We tried several other dishes and really enjoyed most of them. We were told that the tastes aren't ""traditional"" so when you come here don't expect the same old flavors of classic dishes.

We had a great time and I highly recommend eating here!"
Above and beyond,"I've been to Violet Oon 4 times and the food and service has been always amazing. However, yesterday my expectations were exceeded thanks to the help of the team to make my sister's birthday, who traveled all the way from Colombia to visit me, an unforgettable one. Special thanks to Rowel n li chin, I'll definitely come back!"
amazing service and food,"We were travelling in Singapore and found this restaurant has good reviews online. Thai fusion - very innovative and delicious. The venue was lovely, and service was excellent. Would love to go back!"
"High tea was great, service even better!",My family loved the spread for the high tea. The service staff were friendly and most attentive. Definitely worth the money and a return visit! Would love to see a change in menu so we can go back again soon.
Family dinner,"Very nice traditional Thai food we took chicken with buah keluak, fantastic taste This food need a specific and long preparation."
High Tea Set,We enjoyed the high tea set and we would be very happy if we are to allow more choice for the selection of tea (now we are only allow to choose 2 types from the menu)
High tea,"Had high tea here for the first time, i am previously here for lunch or dinner. The high tea is fusion with western scone and chocolate cake, and peranakan items like kueh pie tee and desserts. Some are really spicy like the otak

Fully booked on the weekends so reserve early

7/10"
CNY Lunch,"There was no special menu for CNY except for Yu Sheng. Nevertheless, the food was DELICIOUS! The Yu Sheng was the envy of fellow diners who didn't order it cos it wasn't on the menu. We asked and we were granted! :))"
Disappointing Nonya dishes,"We’ve ordered 3 Nonya dishes, Babi pong Tay, buah Keluak ayam and chap Chye. The Babi dish is extremely salty and it’s impossible to eat the mushrooms that are soaked with the salty gravy. Chap chye was bland and cabbage was undercooked. Ayam dish is too spicy. For about $100, it’s definitely not worth the value."
Disappointing,"This is not my first time to the cafe at ION. This new year's experience, with my visitors from overseas was very disappointing."
A little disappointing as I know their food can be better. Try their National Gallery branch instead,"Food was average. Had 3 dishes. Kueh pie tee - not bad. Sayur lodeh- gravy was a little watery. Gado gado - the dish looked messy when it came to us, taste was ok. Service was excellent though - staff was attentive and friendly."
Superb Peranakan Food,Great service is always a perfect start to a dining experience. Food was amazing. Amazing selection of Singapore specialities. Good quality ingredients.
Great Culinary Experience,"The cuisine is unique. It’s tasty, mildly spicy and light. The meatless meatballs were outstanding, a must for everyone. The service was also excellent"
Dinner,"Authentic Nyonya food (chicken & beef), Taufo is so so only, good services by the ladies staff, convenient location"
"Food is good, customer service not so","It was a weekday lunch with 2 friends. We placed our food order, chit-chatted and realised that it's been 30 min and our food hasn't been served. We asked a waiter to check and 10 min later still no food, whereas we saw tables who had arrived later with food on their table. So we asked another waiter and he was quite curt and asked us who took our order as though it was not his problem. Does it matter? Can't he check with the kitchen? Our food finally arrived and the waiter who brought our food was apologetic and by that time we were so hungry that all the food tasted extra yummy. When we were done with our meal, the waiter who took our order came over with complimentary desserts for making us wait so long for our food. Honestly, I understand if our order was overlooked and an apology was given or if the waiter who was asked to check was helpful and not rude. But the complimentary dessert did somewhat make up for it in the end."
Pleasant evening,"Food was great! Service was fast! And it was nice to receive a slice of cake for my birthday! Most impressive was the call Center - I had made a wrong booking but the person helped by arranging another time
Slot and calling
Me back to say we could go earlier if we wanted! That was very good!"
Unpleasant experience at ION Violet Oon outlet.,"My friend and I had lunch at ION outlet on 16-Dec-22. Our reservation was 11:30. Before we entered the restaurant, we’re told to leave by 13:30.

While we were having our lunch, one of the waitress , Shanti kept coming to our table to clear the plates, and repeatedly told us to leave by 13:30 even the restaurant wasn’t full. We noticed she only picked on us and we were wondering why? She even told us if we didn’t finish in time, we have to takeaway our food and leave at 13:30?

Is this the service Violet Onn provides to chase away customers for fast turn-over of tables? But, the restaurant was not even full?

Thankfully, the restaurant Supervisor, Louie came to apologize and we let the matter rest.

This is the season we catch up with our loved ones. All we ask for is a simple meal with a pleasant environment, and not being discriminated.

I hope you will look into this case to improve your service. Thank you."
High Tea set at Violet Oon Singapore ION,"I got a call confirmation a day before and ordered a high tea set. On the day, I went to the restaurant half an hour early. Glad that we were arranged a table. By 3.30pm, I looked around the restaurant was full even it was on a Monday. Food was good and not too salty nor too sweet."
Amazing as usual,"If you are having a bad day, a trip to Violet Oon will certainly pick you up. Fantastic food, fantastic service and a cozy inviting ambience. Always a pleasure to come back! Because of our experience of a drunk, unruly customer from our previous visit, I have indicated to have a quieter corner at our next visit and they really did arranged it for us. This is exemplary customer service !"
Afternoon tea at Violet Oon Ion,"Nice restaurant deco, attentative staffs who were friendly and helpful. Free flow of beverage was a pleasant surprise. Food was nice"
Dinner at Violet Oon ION,"Nice prenakan food at Violet Oon. Pricy though. They also serve cocktails, tried Singapore Sling, nicely mixed. The desert Bailey’s Pie was disappointing, not sure if it is a cake or ice cream…too creamy. Satay, fish curry, fried egg plant, kueh Pie Ti were excellent. Their Ngoh Hiang was just average for me."
Anniversary Celebration,"Food, service as well as atmosphere is satisfying, will definitely visit again to try the other dishes"
Once in a lifetime experience,"This was my first visits with my wife , I had visited the restaurant with business guests . Awesome food , service , great recommendations by staff . Excellant experience for a birthday dinner with the wife ."
High-Tea,Having afternoon tea is always a lovely occasion. The desserts was all fresh and tasty especially the warm scones and the home-made jams (to die for). So many calories but it was all worth it.
Team Lunch at Violet Oon,"Food was great. Just that staff seems a little bit rushing to clear our empty plates. Also, I noticed one of the senior staff literally scolding someone who seems to be a ""trainee"". Poor trainee, hope things like that should be done discreetly and in private not in the dining area. We we're initially planning to order for deserts and coffee, but eventually decided to go to Lady M just opposite VO."
"Excellent food, service & ambience.",Lovely restaurant with very good food and nice ambience. Great place for my friends and I to catch up with one another.
Tasty Peranakan food,"Better to come in a group to share each dish and order more dishes. We had satay, pork chop, beef rendang. The chicken wings tasted normal though nicely fried. Appreciate the crew going around and topping up water."
Best customer service!,"The restaurant contacted my daughter 2 days later to check if everything was all right and if the food was up to her requirements, & expectation. My daughter had to order a non gluten meal which the restaurant very gladly obliged!"
Hi-Tea@Violet Oon Ion,Food was nice. There was variety. It was interestingly arranged. The corner table assigned to us was great. It allowed us to have privacy to talk. My friend was delighted.
Disappointment,"Worst peranakan taste (rendang flavor is way off), Super expensive (SGD15 for few thin slices of fried tofu served with beansprout and rojak sauce), Judgemental server (after not ordering any sparkling/still bottle water. Should ve just poured still/tap for every customer), They sent someone’s Go Hiang to my table and my Gado2 to a diff table (and for claiming to be a 5*; should not re send/ re serve the food from my table to other’s and vice versa)

My seating was at 8:30pm; the servers could not wait to clear my table up, was not even offered for a dessert menu for after meal.

Once is enough, to never return! Sorry Violet!"
Great service!,Service was great. Staff were very attentive of our needs. Food was good. I hope some day we can request for the Beef Rendang less spicy
high-tea,excellent customer services by Jeanne. she initiated birthday cake & taking photo. others been checking enough drinks & refill. Will be back with friends. nice place for meal & gathering
Not aware it only gives one and half hour for dinning,"The service is ok. It’s just there is no reminder on the reservation page saying that only one and half hour dinning time is offered for Sunday lunch. Only when I was sitting down there, I was informed so. This is not expected. I had a catch up with friends and we haven’t met each other for 13 years. I would have chosen another restaurant if I knew there is time limit for dinning at Violet Onn ion orchard."
Excellent Service,Made a reservation for their High Tea to celebrate a friend’s birthday. Service was great: printed a nice photo for us and helped to celebrate the birthday. It was great.
Uniquely Singapore High Tea,Thoroughly enjoyed the high tea by Violet Oon Singapore! The selection of the food items was unique.
One of the Best Peranakan Food,"It was my 3rd visit to the restaurant. Loved the food, very high quality. Happy that they still have physical menu and not using those hopeless QR code. Please keep up the good effort!"
Great services,Celebrating my friend birthday. Was surprise to receive a cake from them. Staff have help us take a photo and give 1 photo to us. My friend had a memory birthday.
Inconsistency food quality,"The beef rendang taste different - less fragrant , gravy texture is runny and the meat is mushy … unlike when I ate it twice earlier .
Portion of the food is still good.
However . I hope VO should pay good attention to the quality of food they are serving before they start losing customer . I will still give VO another go …"
Bit overpriced,"For the price of the food, expected better taste but service and enviroment seems ok. Need more sharing food options."
High Tea,"Enjoyed afternoon tea here at Ion orchard branch. Their scone is one of the best in Singapore that we have tasted so far, comparable to the scones at Fortnum & Mason in London.

Flavour for the sweets and savory are strong but not too spicy for us even for those spicy ones.

It also turns out that they noted that the High Tea reservation is for my Husband's birthday and the staff presented with a tart and took a photo for us. They even gave us a printed photo. Thank you!!!

The only down side is that it looks like there is a shortage of staff for a Public Holiday."
Crafting for Nyonya foods,"Customer services and waitress are professional. The CS helped us to reschedule the booking so we can make it. The waitress are kind and considerate to proactively offer a high chair, kid cutlery for my kid. We did try nice nyonya and sg foods there. Will definitely revisit again."
Overrated,"This is my 4th visit back to this restaurant. I had high-tea twice and lunch once in the last 2 years. I was back for lunch this time with a friend. I liked the high tea but the food served during lunch is at best average. I had the Hainanese Pork Chop and the sauce was overly sweet. The pork chop had a lot of fat bits and I left half of my plate untouched. We ordered the Kuey-pie-tee to share and the filling was again too sweet for our liking. We only managed to eat half the servings! The only saving grace was the dry laksa which was at least half decent. Overall, I think the quality of the food has dropped significantly since my last visit. In addition, they only allow 90mins for each sitting, so I would not recommend unless you really like their food."
Weekday lunch at VO,Always a joy to dine at this place. Food is great and the staff are pleasant and prompt. Keep up the good service!
Afternoon Tea,"We had our team Afternoon Tea at ION outlet, it takes a while for the waitress to take our drinks order & served food. Overall experience was quite nice..nice food, sweet items so-so and good service."
Topnotch Customer Service even at the peak of Formula 1,"The mains, particularly the Hainanese Pork Chop and the VO Shepherd's Pie, are a must-try! But what made our dinner memorable was the hospitability of the staff. When they found out that I brought my Mom to have birthday dinner, the staff were kind enough to serve us a complimentary cake slice, and they even gave us a photo souvenir. I will go back to this resto during my next trip to Singapore."
Too many reminders to leave,"The food was ok but what was terrible was being left feeling unwelcome by 4 reminders by various wait staff through the course of the meal that you have to leave by 1.30 pm. Yes, we understand the house rules but four times?! Can't there be some coordination such that there are at most 2 - once at the start and 5 minutes to the deadline. Since we felt pushed out doubt we'll ever come back."
One of our favorites,"Great place to experience elevated local Singapore (Peranakan) food. Their menu is filled with common Singapore dishes that are prepared with better ingredients and cooked meticulously. Our favorite is the Kway Pie Tee, Chicken Sate, and their tender Beef Rendang. You may want to try these dishes first at a local hawker center (food center) before dining in Violet Oon so you can appreciate the difference. Special mention to the restaurant staff for being helpful and responsive to our questions and requests."
High Tea Set,The high tea set is ok but the service is below average. The staffs seem to be very busy and many Trainees whom are not allowed to take orders. Many tables were waiting for order takers. Thank you
Wonderful Service,"We had a wonderful time in Violet Oon, the restaurant is sensitive towards the note I've written on my booking app and attend to us in a well mannered!"
Peranakan,A great and tasty introduction to peranakan food. Go for the “nonya selections” near the back of the menu rather than the front. The front has “french fries” so avoid unless your 3 year insists. Desserts are tempting too but look so sweet. Good service
Good food but could use a few improvements,"I had eaten before at the Violet Oon restaurant at the national gallery and had fond memories. As my husband an I were staying in Orchard Rd, I booked a table at Ion. Could only get a booking for 6pm which is earlier than we normally prefer to eat dinner. I was a bit surprised on arrival to find that the restaurant was in the middle of the mall, but OK. It did not have much atmosphere.
The food was great, but I felt that the service was a bit rushed. We had ordered appetisers and mains. The mains came out to us barely after we had finished our appetisers. It was all delicious, just would have been better if it felt a little less rushed.
Next time, I would prefer to go back to the National Gallery instead."
Limited Drink Options,"This is my third time eating high tea at this restaurant. The food is just as good as usual, but they have limited their drink options to only 2 types of tea and some types of coffee this time. Chocolate drinks, mocha & most types of tea are not available. As I am neither into coffee or tea, I will just go to other high tea options that offers chocolate beverages in the future. Service is also not as good as my previous meals there, and they are always eager to collect the trays and plates even though we have just barely finished eating."
Good Food,"Food quality was excellent, glad there is a branch located near MRT. Service was OK, could have been better."
Good food,Food was awesome and ambience too. Kind of pricey though but overall good. The service was impeccable. Only complaint lack of staff and getting service is a little slow
EAT AND GO,"Made lunch reservation for a table at 1.30pm, was only seated at 1.42pm. Food (ngoh hiang, satay, rendang, dried laksa and brinjal) ordered about 1.50pm and starters and main served together around 2pm. Food was warm but you know it was probably pre prepared before order was made. We finished our meal around 2.40pm and wanted to order dessert but was advised table had to be vacated by 3pm for their high tea guests. For the $142 that I paid and the fact that violet oon is suppose to be more than casual dining, did not expect to receive such treatment. Hope the restaurant can give guests more time to enjoy the meal and have a positive dining experience!"
Superlicious Dinner,"Hosted dinner for my Swiss friend & his family. He specifically requested to eat at Violet Oon cos he missed the food after returning to Zurich 3 yrs ago. His wife simply love the beef rendang &
bush KelHis 3 yr old son loved the prata."
Service has room to improve,"Food was great. However, service has room for improvement. We arrived promptly at 3pm but was served food only at 4pm. We noticed that other tables who arrived after us were served food before us. We had to feedback to the team before our tray were then served within minutes. The system has room to improve to ensure tables were served in a fair manner."
Could be better!,"Even though we were there for the afternoon tea. We have ordered sole starters as well.
Personally I do not like the crab tart, too fishy to my liking, and the chicken, too much spice. Sweets are generally good.
Service team is excellent. Choices of tea is very limited, only garden brew and earl grey even though rest of the choices are of the same price.
Kurobuta ( starter ) is super yummy!"
Satisfaction,"Food and servive excellent, original taste and cocktails, thank you! Waiters really kind and available to needs"
Stop serving lunch after 2pm,"It was about 2:15pm we walked in for lunch but was told they are fully booked and are setting tables for 3pm high tea. They are still serving lunch and there are empty tables. I guess if you go to Violet Oon after 2pm, don’t bother you won’t be served! Give them a pass there are other places for lunch!"
Great service and delicious food - consistently!,Could not buy chilli sauce for pietee home. What a shame! But service was friendly and super efficient. Food has been consistently good.
"Good food, awesome service, impressed!","1st visit for mum's birthday celebration, food is generally good & service is awesome! Will return in near future!"
Lunch on 4 Jul 2022,Great foody Friendly service we enjoyed dining there. will recommend that to other friends will be there again soon !
Terrible service. Regret spending money.,Waited 20 mins to be seated even with reservation. Table setup was incomplete. Service was super slow. Food served was cold and late even thought we preordered. Staff were not attentive.
Fantastic food plus exceptional service!,"I had my birthday celebration together with my mom and it was amazing! The food was the best version of local Peranakan and the service was a delight! The restaurant was busy but we felt that we were well taken care of and we had the best recommendations from Diana.

Kudos to all the staff who made sure we were seated promptly and the food served was exceptional, I would like to commend Jandel and Diana for their warmest welcome in Singapore, great dining experience, and for delighting our tummies! You guys are awesome! Cheers!"
Violet Onn Ion,Food was not bad tho very pricey but restaurant is at the heart of Orchard after all. Would have tasted better if food was served piping hot.
Upscale Paranakan cuisine for tai-tais & tourists,"Loved the tender Beef Rendang, and crispy Pie-Tee, but the dry Laksa (really?... it looked like spaghetti with a couple of prawns for decoration, probably okay for tourists). As for the Kueh Bingka Ubi (tapioca cake) for dessert, I am sure that any real local would baulk at paying $15 per very standard slice.
We did enjoy our lunch there, but lovely as Violet's restaurants are, some of the prices are rather ""amusing"".... But that did not stop us visiting her other restaurants too!"
Service at its Best,"It is our first time to visit Violet Oon Singapore ION. We don’t know what to order , the staff gave us recommendations, it was all good ,my family had a great time . The service was beyond my expectations. Thank you Violent Oon Singapore Ion staff we had a great experience , will definitely recommend this with my family and friends."
Birthday lunch,"Very enjoyable time spent at Violet Onn for lunch, food is delicious, and they are so caring, we had a slice of toffee cake for my sister ' birthday after our meal. Thanks you, will visit again."
HighTea,Savoury Dishes were amazing. Sweet dishes were a little disappointing. HighTea set is good for 2 pax
It used to be better!,"Food is not as good as when they opened, service is poor as the waitresses constantly make you feel like they’re overwhelmed all the time"
honest feedback,"1) Thanks for the providing the great gesture during our visit
2) Thanks for good customer service on mis-communication of the wrong food order
3) Understand that there is a 2hour seating time limit. However, I will like to suggest when the seating time is up instead of clearing our plates, our napkins, our table mat subsequently.....you all can inform us in a way of politeness; that will do,. Thanks."
Perfecto,"Food, service and hospitality were on point! It was my friend’s bday (I just statement in the remarks) and they surprised w cake and photo print out!"
Disappointing,"Booked the table for a birthday celebration. Foods were of poor quality. We ordered Cod Fish, Beef Rendang, dried laksa, Ngor Hiang. Fish was not hot as if it has been left out on a table for a while. The other dishes were not impressive at all. Though I mentioned in the booking is for a birthday but nobody served us the birthday cake at the end and I had to remind the staff."
Amazing food,Every dish was amazing and had never ending positive reviews. So glad to have chosen this place as it has added a positive experience! Only wished I didn’t have to take much more effort than usual to get a service attendant’s attention.
"Delicious food, service was a bit off at the beginning","I had such an amazing meal at National Kitchen by Violet Oon, that I had to try another of her restaurants during my visit to Singapore, so I chose the Ion location. My reservation was at 1:30 for lunch. There was quite a queue when I arrived, so it took a few minutes to get seated. The restaurant was busy when I arrived. So, it took the server a bit of time to get to me. She was professional and efficient, but not very friendly. It was difficult to flag down the server when I needed something. Once the earlier lunch group started to leave, and the restaurant emptied a bit, the service became much more personal and attentive. The food was absolutely delicious. My advice, would be to come during less busy times, for a better service experience."
My lunch experience,We had a lovely meal was only disappointed that we didn’t have get a chance to have dessert as the table was for another session. Would have appreciated if we would have been told there was a time limit as I was unaware when I booked. But nevertheless we had a great meal. Thank you.
Violet Oon high tea,"Food was excellent if you go for quality rather quantity. Will try the other outlet at Changi, Jewel."
Wonderful Peranakan Dishes,"I dropped by the ION Orchard brand last week and ordered the Ayam Buah Keluak and Beef Rendang and the Kueh Pie Tee. The Kueh Pie Tee was excellent, the savoury and sweetness was well balanced. The Beef Rendang was tender and tasty. Finished up the evening with the Pulut Hitam with Coconut Ice Cream and Gula Melaka Cake with Coconut Ice Cream, both of which were simply divine. It certainly brought back memories for me of my great grand aunt who was a Peranakan. Wonderful dishes and taste! Going back there again this week to sample their chicken rice."
They asked us to leave,"We had lunch at the restaurant, we are 9 people and we order quite alot after we finished our food we had ordered some desserts and while we’re waiting for the dessert the waitress came and ask us to pay first and we did pay, After that as soon as we finished our desserts they asked us to leave cus the next customer are waiting (which only has been 2 hours)"
A late lunch,"We ordered the kueh pie ti, chicken rice and chicken satay.
The chilli sauce and the grated ginger served with the chicken rice were spot on. Rice was flavourful without the oiliness.
Peanut sauce for satay was spicy and with a dollop of grated pineapple makes it very refreshing.
All items are consistently good."
High tea for 2,I’ve been here multiple times in the past and I have always enjoyed my visit. The high tea price of $58 for 2 is such a great deal. I prefer savory over sweet so I love coming here for high tea. The menu is unique from all the other high teas I’ve been to. I love that they provide Singaporean dishes! And the staff is always friendly and nice. Definitely a must-visit if you’re visiting Singapore!
Weekday local high tea,Reservation process a breeze. Restaurant ambience was casual and nice. Food spread is nice. Price is reasonable.
Good Food,First time going and ordered those recommended dishes and they didn’t fail to disappoint. Nice ambience for chillax and makan!
always a wonderful experience,"had a wonderful time with the family... all the staff were very friendly and attentive... ambiance for a restuarant in the middle of an upscale mall could not be better placed... great food, awesome servers, fantastic ambiance"
Good experience,Wasn’t a fan of Nonya kuey but was amazed by the savoury items on the high tea menu especially the coronation chicken! The waiters were attentive and it was my second visit to Violet Oon at the different venue. Probably will go to the next one as well to try out.
Fantastic Service and Mouthwatering Food,"We arrived early and were seated. Plant Based menu was godsend and incredibly delicious. Had the meatball rendang, fried rice and delicious blackforest cake. highly recommend."
Bday lunch at Violet Oon,"The staff at Violet oon was really very good and I did't get his name but the guy who serve us not only make sure that we didn't order too much but made recommendation. It was a bday lunch and they were very kind to surprise my friend with a cake. The food was good and so was the cake :)
Thank you very much"
Peranakan high tea at Ion,"We made a reservation for 3pm and had to wait till 3.30pm to enter due to only 1 person attending a long queue plus bringing the guests in. Best was the kueh pie tee and the scones. Dessert tier was so so only. Consolation was that we could change to a different beverage for the 2nd serving, a birthday surprise gula melaka cake plus ice cream and a complementary take-home photo."
Nice Nyonya food ever!,"Very happy to had a nice food when I was feeling super hungry ! My friend from Japan she surprised the food so good in this restaurant too! Thanks ( ps* service can be more improve, some one them (waiter) ignored us when they saw us calling )"
HighTea Reservation at 3:00pm on 22nd April 2022,"I think the Management at Violet Oon (ION) need to review the way tables are being turned around from lunch guests to welcome 3:00pm high tea guests. When questioned why our table isn't ready, as we were punctual and in a queue, an unusual response came from a staff member, ""we cannot ask them to leave"" (by ""them"" he meant the lunch guests). It left my high tea companion and I wondering why a Chope reservation for 3:00pm is necessary. Further, there were visibly empty tables. We only got seated (concurred with my companion) around 3:15-3:20pm."
Gorgeous setting with great food and service,It was date night for my husband and I. And we were craving for nonya food - VO was an excellent choice in both the setting and quality of food and service. No regrets! Food is just so good 👍
Nice Peranakan cuisine,Very seldom got the chance to do Peranakan cuisine but this restaurant gave us a very unforgettable experience. The food was tummy and the restaurant ambience was great. Should try when in Singapore!
Fantastic experience celebrating birthday,"My friend and I had a great night out on Monday. Since this booking was made awhile back, I forgot that I included a special request noting to celebrate my friend’s birthday that evening. To our pleasant surprise, the team at Violet Oon ION gifted a huge slice of black forest cake and even offered to take our photo and printed a copy with a frame so that my friend could keep as momento. This was her first time to Violet Oon, and she commented that it won’t be her last. Thanks for the great experience!"
A very pleasant experience,"Was there with my 3 sisters. We were celebrating one of my sisters birthday however I didn’t mention while making the reservation. One of the service staff overheard our conversation and she actually arranged a slide of cake and candle towards the end of our meal, we were so pleasantly surprised!! The service throughout our meal was already very good, all were friendly and attentive, the surprise cake make it overwhelming, all of us were impressed. Thank you very much !"
Delicious food and friendly staff,"love their belachan chilli dip with lime, spicy enough to give me that extra punch. Sayur lodeh is really good and savoury..and must have their bubur hitam with ice cream."
Gorgeous just gorgeous,"Experience real Singapore Perenekan food, excellent service, delicious, beautiful restaurant.
We had booked for Clark Quay but they had technical problems so moved u a to Ion. As an apology they gave us two bottle of amazing wine and free desserts. Outstanding service the whole way. But you do feel like you are eating in a shopping mall despite beautiful decor."
Food was great but we were rush to finish our meal!!,"Food was great but the service was terrible.... We were rush to eat our dinner! Before we are done with our starters, we were asked what do we want for the main course? While we were still eating our main, we were asked about dessert. While I was still having my main and the rest are done, the same waiter came to ask are we ready to order out dessert?! :( It was so embarrassing especially I took my guests from overseas to the dinner."
Violet Oon (Ion Orchard),"Excellent and attentive service. Food was delicious and portions were well-managed. Though the ambience was light and casual, the staff made it a fine dining experience."
"So Cold & Distant, So very Not Peranakan","It was a rare family get-together with the auntsl, and had decided to bring them to somewhere which felt a home away from home. So what could be better choice than this popular Peranakan restaurant since we had all grown up on Peranakan?

Firstly, the food was mediocre and simply overrated. A few of our Peranakan friends cooked way better.

But the spoiler of the entire experience was really the cold and distant waiter who was assisting us.
I had never met any service staff such stone-cold, and it's not the mask.
Pure coldness, the way he spoke sent us the message that we were not welcome at all.
To top it off, he came up to us at past 1.20pm asking if we had any last order for dessert as he needs the table back by 1.30pm.
There was no reminder from staff about the timing when we entered the restaurant.
Yes there was a mention on the timing in the reservation confirmation, but being in the service line myself i strongly believe that it's only courtesy that the restaurant provides a face-to-face gentle reminder upon our arrival.

Well, I believe Violet Oon staff really couldn't wait for us to get lost as another staff looking like the manager came over soon and told us that his next table is waiting outside already. ( and it wasn't 1.30pm yet!)

Thank you Violet Oon for bringing service to the next level."
