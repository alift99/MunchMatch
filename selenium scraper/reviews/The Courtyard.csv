AVOID!!!,"Visited the courtyard on a work Christmas party in December, we enjoyed our night. Visited again early January and took my in laws, well it is safe to say, I was embarrassed for recommending the place and taking my family. The whole experience was shocking. Food was cold and tasteless, 45 minute wait on drinks, and not attentive at all. I then was told that the general manager and head chef had left. Safe to say those senior staff obviously carried the place as it is now on a downward spiral. It is apparent there is no leadership with customer service and no quality of food in the kitchen.
Will not be returning and would absolutely not recommend to anyone."
Excellent Service,"Without A Doubt,We Genuinely Enjoyed Our Afternoon Tea Experience At The Courtyard.
A Special Shout Out To LINH
She was very couteous,helpful,friendly and attentive.
This kind lady went all the way and helped me look for a 2023 party novelty of my choice.
I'am deeply grateful.
A HUGE TQ also goes out to the doorman n bellhop on duty.
On the whole we were thoroughly impressed.
TQVM FULLERTON HOTEL."

Courtyard Review,"Excellent service as always and food was amazing, Albert and team took very good care of us during our visit to their high tea. We had an amazing time. Will definitely recommend Courtyard to friends and family."
"Worth a visit, even if it‚Äôs just for coffee","Did not actually stay as we were on a trip to the Grand Prix but visited for coffee. A very beautiful hotel, was originally the Post Office. A variety of shops on the ground floor, one being a very nice jewellers!

Has a great seating area outside th3 hotel too so you can watch the world go by!"
Beyond my expectation!,The quality of food and the standard of service were better than my ‚Äògood‚Äô expectation. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and had a great time!
Very impressed with the high tea !,"We came here for the afternoon high tea and we had amazing time . We were very impressed with the decorations , food , ambience and the service . Albert , our server , was very friendly and he made our experience memorable . I highly recommend this high tea . Hotel is decorated for Christmas and I truly enjoyed it"
Delightful Christmas high tea,"We reserved a table for the first day (December 1) of Christmas high tea at The Courtyard with a credit card deposit. We were very impressed with the beauty of the Christmas decorations at the outside entrance and in the hotel lobby, especially the tree. We also enjoyed the calming harp music and the quiet and respectful behavior of diners that were having high tea at the other six or seven tables that day. The fare included clumps of sweet ham, wagyu beef in a pastry shell, and haddock. There were small sandwiches, and on the top tier was a collection of sweet pastries with Christmas decorations. We tried without success to access the free hotel wi-fi. We were given a bill for the tea that did not mention the amount of the deposit, but we found that the charge for the deposit was reversed shortly after we left. The service team did a wonderful job making us feel at home. We recommend the Christmas high tea at The Courtyard."
As nice as the hotel,We stayed 1 night at this hotel and the courtyard is great for some tea/coffee and to take it all in!
Extremely satisfied visit,"Joey is very professional , polite and nice. He makes us feel very at home. Great ambience and delicious food. I had high tea with my cousin and there was lovely harp performance. Would definitely recommend the high tea. I am from the hospitality line and I believe Joey is an asset to the restaurant. Keep it up!"
"Great experience, food can be better.","5 stars for ambience, environment and service. Love the harp performance.

3 star for the food. Much room for improvement on the food quality. Too little of the savoury selection and the sweets are generally too overwhelmingly sweet.

Still worth a visit though, and a great place to spend a nice afternoon."
Visit to the clubhouse.,"Great experience at the clubhouse. My visit was during tea time (2-4pm). I had a warm welcome, and was lavished with the choicest of teas, juices and a whole assortment of delectable treats. Highly recommended to visit this posh area to unwind from a morning's worth of sight seeing and/or shopping.
Not only was I getting a treat from all that's available, team lead Joshua even prepared a little gift for my kid who was with me at the time.


Thank u Joshua, Chandra, Ryan and Nash for your kind hospitality."

SUPERB SERVICE,"Drop by Fullerton hotel for food and discussion after a long morning meeting, we step in The Courtyard dining area looking for lunch. We were famished. However it was 11.15am, the kitchen would not be open until 11.30am. The quick thinking staff (Mr Lalikumar) at the Courtyard tell us not to worry, he will take our food orders and speak to the chef and serve us food at 11.30am. At 11.30am, the food promptly arrived. It really helped us. The good service did not stop there, we continued our discussion after food and suddenly a plate of love cakes appear in front of us, it is on the house according to Mr Lalikumar. We felt well taken care of and our tiredness all wash away. It just made our day. Thank you to Mr Lalikumar at The Courtyard, Fullerton Hotel. They have top grade, out of the box thinking staff."

Great location & Nice view! Family & child-Friendly hotel in Singapore!,"Lunch at the French restaurant inside The Fullerton Hotel with my family. Nicely decorated and beautiful setting. It is spacious so we didn't feel crowed and sat comfortably at our table. The staff was nice and helpful. They explain the menu to us clearly. We were afraid that there wasn't much food that the kids would enjoy but luckily, they do have the kids menu available and they loved it very much. Overall it was a great lunch date and beautiful view especially the historical building. We took a walk and cross the bridge outside of the hotel to the park on the other side. It was very relaxing. Highly recommended if you are looking for a comfy and spacious place for dining!"
Experience the Fullerton,Worth going just to enjoy the ambience of the Fullerton Hotel! Such a historic building. Was very formal & lots of business meeting for a family to go but enjoyed the experience.

Enjoyed the service. Food could be improved,"Happy to be served very warmly by Latikun. Fabian was also smiley when servicing. The lady staff who ushered us from the entrance to our table was comparatively not friendly.
Food wise, staff was generous in offering to refill our trays. Selection is sufficient. However I minus one star for the freshness of the savoury treats. The bread/bun/toast were hard and chewy. I ended up not eating them :( otherwise, I enjoyed my visit!"

Oriental Flavours Afternoon Tea at The Courtyard,"Good and peaceful ambience. Pastries are tasty, and refillable. Tea is unlimited too.

Purple Afternoon Tea,The experience itself made the afternoon tea worth it! Brought my mom here for her 60th birthday and she had a lovely time and was extremely impressed by the service provided.

She also hasn‚Äôt been here since it was the Post Office and it was very nostalgic. Would definitely return.

There was top up of savory food, scones and unlimited choices of drinks! (I had tried a few hotels but this is the 1st time I ever had free top up ) the price is reasonable for a hotel afternoon tea. They had the best sweet dessert I ever tried. Personalized service by staff Fabian."
Fantastic food with excellent service,"We enjoyed the Cantonese food, the ambience of the restaurant, and the service provided by Alson. Overall I give it a 8/10 dining experience. It will be perfect for me if it can be less pricy. Great restaurant!"
High Tea @ The Fullerton Hotel,Tried the Purple Afternoon Tea at Fullerton Hotel today. Beautiful pastries with Purple Rain gin and lovely tea. The staff has kindly provided a slice of cheese cake after knowing that I am allergic to cocoa pastries. Thank you Mr Lalikumar and other staff for the excellent service.

Fabulous birthday celebration @ The Fullerton Hotel - The Courtyard,"A special shout-out to Mr Lalikumar and team for the hospitality and amazing service rendered to us during our hi tea session at The Courtyard.

Amazing!,"Amazing service and food. The staff here are well-trained and attentive to the customers. Food is tasty, well-balanced across flavors, and portions are sufficient. Very well done üëçüèº"
Fullerton high tea@The Courtyard,"Expected a better experience. Selections were pretty limited. Only 5- types of savoury sandwiches. There were 5-6 types of sweet cakes, all of which is nothing to shout about. Tea selections was pretty limited. Overall underwhelming, given the good reviews and the price. Service was slow. Bill came to $103.70 for two persons after credit card discounts & taxes. Won't be coming again"
The people from the courtyard of Fullerton is amazing,"Hats off to all of the people whom are working at the courtyard of Fullerton hotel, Mr.Lalikumar, Ms.Christine, Ms.Angelina and Ms.Cheryl did a great job at attending to us and making sure our time at the courtyard of Fullerton is enjoyable and fun, their service is superb truly a 5 star world class service, please raise their pay or give them a bonus, they really deserve to be valued by the company"
Lobster Nasi Lemak - A local favorite raised to the standard of a posh hotel,"Came here for my daughter‚Äôs birthday lunch. Could only get a table for 4 although we wanted for 5. Pretty crowded at the restaurant as well as the hotel.

Ambience was great and service was excellent, especially from Fabian. Surprised to get a birthday cake and photo taken after the meal.

My wife and daughter had the turkey Christmas special which they liked having missed that for Thanksgiving since we came back to Singapore. I had the fried whole lobster Nasi Lemak which I thoroughly enjoyed. The lobster was juicy inside and crispy outside. The sambal was just right and really authentic and I had a second helping which Fabian brought with a smile. I agreed with his comment that the real taste of Nasi Lemak is in the sambal! I think it‚Äôs a great idea to combine lobster with the humble Nasi Lemak in a posh hotel restaurant so you don‚Äôt feel cheated eating such a common local dish here. They did it so well that I would definitely come back for this dish again."
Undoubtedly #1,"Fullerton's courtyard restaurant deserves its number 1 position on trip advisor's list of restaurants in Singapore. Whether you're looking for a nice and quite time with your significant other or want to have a good time with family and friends or even a catch up session with a business associate over tea and scones, this place wins it hands down. This is primarily due to the service offered by Lalitkumar and team. The menu rotates every month and the festive special menu for December is definitely worth a visit even if you visited a few months back. Highly recommended!"
afternoon tea,"My friend and i had a most memorable afternoon tea on 1.12.21. We opted for a vegetarian menu. It was a very well thought through menu and the service was excellent. Especially Lalitkumar and his colleague. They were v mindful of our diet restrictions and attentive. Imppecable service by both gentlemen, Would love to return!"
Lovely High Tea at Courtyard,A good thing we made reservations at the Courtyard. We had high tea while waiting to get through the long check-in line. Very friendly staff and excellent vegan pastries. Had a relaxed and pleasant stay.

We celebrated our 14th anniversary here and was presented with a surprise cake and also a memorable photo!"
Wonderful services at The Courtyard,"The Courtyard is my first visit, and the service is excellent.
I booked through the Chope app, and they contacted to see if I was going for a celebration.
I was there to celebrate the birthday of my best friend. They provided excellent service on the day, taking photos and printing them as gifts for my buddy, as well as preparing a slice of cake.

The food is delicious, and they continue to double-check with us to see if we require any additional savory food. We don't eat beef so they get chicken for us. Very thanks to Lalikumar, Sherlyn and John.
Surely will visit there again."

Fantastic time!,"A friend and I had high tea at The Courtyard yesterday and we found the service was excellent throughout and it made our time there very enjoyable!

Lovely Abie recommended some excellent teas to go with our food. She has such a warm and friendly vibe about her that it made us feel comfortable, chatting away while enjoying the food, knowing that we were well taken care of.

I love the pulled pork with friend mantou but found it too oily so I didn't want any replenishment. To my surprise, Lalikumar presented us with steamed mantou and pulled pork! I am not sure who prepared it but knows that Rey was involved too. Thank you, Rey & Lalikumar! I enjoyed it so much more and is really appreciative of the effort. I am touched that they sense what I needed without being told.

The Fullerton coffee was another good recommendation and we love it. Thanks again to Lalikumar!

Given the chance to have another high tea, I will go back to The Courtyard again just for the excellent service."
Afternoon tea,Mr. Lalikumar & team were absolutely wonderful at The Courtyard. They are so polite and courteous with each of my order and coming around to check if we are doing alright. I have enjoyed my afternoon tea thoroughly. Thank you. 10/10 will be back again.
