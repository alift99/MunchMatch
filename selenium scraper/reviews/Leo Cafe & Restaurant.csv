Gluten free Indonesian food,"A family run restaurant with very simple delicious food. Celiac friendly, great value no frills dining."
"Good food, great atmosphere, awesome service!","We had the kampong fried rice, bakar ayam and the ginger sliced beef. Everything was so good! The fried rice had a nice ikan bilis crunch, the ginger sliced beef was perfectly cooked but the bakar ayam was the star for me! Crispy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside and the chilli was just right.

The place is clean and nicely decked out, with a homely feel. Uncle Leo and his daughter were very friendly and welcoming, and despite it being my first visit they made me feel like I was coming home. Before the other patrons came in, uncle Leo even sat for a while and chatted with us, which we thoroughly appreciated.

Highly recommended for an empty tummy, a quiet night and if you feel like letting uncle Leo regale you with stories of old Singapore."
Wonderful hidden family run gem!,Definitely recommend! Wonderful family run restaurant with authentic cuisine. Ordered my all time favourite kampong fried rice and ginger beef and did not get disappointed again. This restaurant is worth the short stroll through the hotel lobby to the second floor as all hidden gems are. The cherry on top is the warm conversations with uncle Leo.
Warm and Cosy Restaurant,"Found this little eatery tucked away in central Singapore and it was a great find! The place is cosy and has a relaxed vibe, while the service is warm and friendly. The food was hearty and overall it was value for money too! This is a wonderful place if you want somewhere quiet be it for yourself, you and your friends and/or family."
A hidden gem at Middle Road,"We found a hidden gem at Middle Road.
Leo Cafe & Restaurant is located at Populous Hotel, 2nd floor, 23 Middle Road. Just nearby hotel 81.

Uncle Leo and the lady boss is very friendly.
The restaurant is cosy and relaxing.
The food is good quality for Singapore homemade style. It is so good even the white rice alone. They have special mixed a few types of rice, not just a simple normal white rice.
The chicken chop, skin is so crispy.
Fish and chips, fish is fresh and crispy. Not oily. My little boy finished the whole plate!!
Indonesian Oxtail Soup is rarely found in Singapore, and they have a good one.
We ate everything clean.
I promised uncle Leo to shout out. This is a good local quality small restaurant that prepared their food with pure heart and love. We will come here more often for sure!! I put the name card and menu QR code in the photo below."
Great find. Will be back.,Great find. Had a weekday lunch here. The chicken fried noodles were fresh and well made. Service was good. Uncle Leo is friendly and welcoming.
Hidden Gem,"This little family-style cafe is located on level 2 of Lion Peak Hotel (previously Populous Hotel), and is run by a friendly uncle Leo with his family .

The menu has a good selection with a mix of western & local dishes. Besides the usual cold & hot beverages, they also serve beer & wine.

We were very pleased with the quality of food served, as everything tasted fresh.

The Hawaiian pizza had fresh pineapples, tomatoes over a thin pizza crust with a smokey flavour.

The chicken chop was crispy on skin n is lightly flavoured with salt & pepper to retain its original flavour.

The fried rice with beef had bursts of ""wok hey"" with bits of salted fish & fried white baits added with crunch from a generous amount of chopped vegetables.

It is overall a satisfying meal.

We'll be back again!"
"Good home-cooked food, cozy atmosphere. Worth it!","Family run business, in a new but secluded location. Food is carefully made to order, taste is clean and good.

A business worth supporting!

It is along Middle road, walking distance from Central National Library. Look for Hotel 81, and it is in the hotel next door, on the 2nd floor.

Sizable portions, reasonable price, no service charge and no GST"
A must visit hidden gem tucked away in Middle Road,Food was excellent and salad spot on Friendly service to top it A hidden gem Must visit Had dinner here almost daily as the chef is constantly creating new sauces to ‚Äòcustom‚Äô fit to our liking Fantastic jobüëç
"Excellent food, friendly service","The cafe serves a wide range of Asian and western cuisines -- pork free. Staying for one night at Lion Peak Raffles where the cafe is housed on the 2nd floor. Decided to try their ayam pecak (grilled chicken smeared with spicy Indonesian sambal and served with hot rice and lettuce salad in gado-gado infused mayo dressing) I must give this dish a 5-star!! Will certainly come again and it's highly recommended. Uncle Leo himself (who's 80 years old and a former mechanical engineer) will make you feel so at home. Enjoyed dining on the terrace/balcony with fresh tropical warm air (versus the super cold aircon inside) . Kudos to Uncle Leo and his team who has been in the business for 20 years serving quality, great tasting food!"
Highly recommend. Great food. Friendly atmosphere üëç,Amazing food. Lovely owners. Very friendly atmosphere. Highly recommended if visiting Singapore. Leo makes a mean Singapore sling. Outstanding üòÉ
Brilliant take on old school chicken chop,"Impeccable service by the humble staff. Love the cosy and comfy environment. The oven baked checked chop cooked in its own juices, elevated by the savoury marination will definitely have me and my friends coming back for more. Glad to have found this inconspicuous gem!"
Nice place to hangout and reasonably price.,Good food. Highly recommended the chicken chop. Big portion and generous with the fries and veggie. Well marinated n done perfectly. Good place to have a family meal or hangout with friends.

Food is to come back for!,"Tender and well-marinated meat with a subtle grilled taste and a citrusy tang from the sauce. Old-school flavours and a very generous portion. I thought that the chicken chop was slightly too charred, though some would think it adds to the smoky taste."
Leo caf√© & restaurant,Very tasty food. Uncle Leo is really friendly. The chef customised my soup to my palette. Pls do visit if staying at the hotel or visiting Bugis area.

Warm Hospitality!,"I had a wonderful time dining in this restaurant due to the staff's friendliness and also her helpfulness to cater to my vegetarian needs.

Even though Leo's Cafe is located on the second level of Populous Hotel, it is open to public customers to dine in. I will come by again as a non-hotel guest in future."
My experience at Leo's Cafe üëçüç∑üçïüçªüòç,"Located snugly on the 2nd level of Populous Hotel, is LEO'S CAFE. I'm drawn to them not only for their addictive food but also to the staff's warm, genuine and excellent hospitality. Each time I visit Leo's Cafe, I forget that I'm a customer.

Back to food, I've tried their saut√©ed salad, shown in the picture below. It consists of Shitake Mushrooms and Baby Potatoes, adorned with bell peppers to add that extra color and spice. Everything was done to perfection... like fresh from a grill-out, except that it wasn't. Staff was extremely helpful in tweaking the taste to my liking. (Im pretty sensitive to saltiness). Kudos to Siew Lee for this

Next, their pizza, a newly-invented recipe, is to die for. Highly Recommended for their thin crust & deliciously melted cheese. I had a video taken but unfortunately, can't seem to upload it. The Pictures below include their Mushroom pizza and Hawaiian pizza! My all-time fav? Definitely The Mushroom!!!

I also tried their Nasi Ayam Pecah, an invention by the Owner's Daughter who's talent in adding the traditional touch of Indonesian tang to her dishes makes me wanting more. (I love spice!)
The Ayam had a slightly crisped exterior (skin) and tenderised flesh that was served with a generous dollop of the spiced sauce which made the entire dish lip-smacking flavourful. The vegetables by the side were fresh but slightly bland for a reason... It's to complement the rich flavour of the chicken by mixing it in...and it balances everything out to perfection...again!

There are also a variety of liquor/mocktails/draught beers (even beer towers! ) available.. giving it a very bar-like feel.

Totally great for a chill-out session with friends/family and even by yourself... There's a sliding door that allows you to relax/dine while enjoying the external ambience.

Overall, Leo's Cafe offers reasonable prices, given the superior quality of their Food and Service.. It's definitely the place to be!"
Nice food,Love the new signature dish Bakar Ayam (grilled chicken) üòãüòã Hotel cafe with nice environment and ambiance
Hidden Gem In Bugis,"Good service, nice and cozy ambience to chill.
They serve good food and the indonesia dish is good as you are able to choose your own level of spiciness.

If you want a simple dish, you can try their fried rice as the ""wok hey"", taste is good."
Nice place to chill around Bugis,"Has been a regular customer with Leo Cafe and know the boss and his daughter personally for years their days the previous location,Albert Court. Outstanding service and food as usual, this has never changed. Well worth a visit if you need a cosy place to chill and for lunch & dinner within the Bugis area."
Very nice ambience,This new place is perfect! Al fresco sitting or indoor air conditioned seats at your choice. Nice ambience perfect for friends night out or even for couples. The food is cheap and good too. Will come often
Lunch,Resonable pricing for such a fantastic meal. The ambiance and service is heart warming and friendly that make you feel like at home.
Great New Leo Cafe,It is simply awesome for Leo Cafe to be in their new location that‚Äôs the Populous Hotel. Much better environment and new menu like Ikan Pecak is so good and can be spicy per request. Highly recommended as they at promotion now.
Never felt more at home,"I came across Leo cafe during my staycation at Populus hotel and was just planning to have a quick brunch while I work. The boss here is really sweet and introduced me their specialties which is Indonesian food. However, after I told her that I‚Äôm on a strict diet, she prepared a really healthy yet delicious plate for me immediately and even suggested to prepare me a healthy breakfast that is out of the menu the next day before I check out. The service here is definitely commendable and the food here is really yummy too! Thank you once again for the hospitality. Like I mentioned, never felt more at home at a staycation. Blessed."

"Nice place to eat, drink and chill","Worked nearby and it's my go to place after a day's work to have a hearty meal and a couple of drinks. Owner, Uncle Leo and his daughter Vicki are extremely friendly and nice to chat with. One thing to take note of, if you can handle your spices, their secret sambal belachan packed a punch. Fret not if you can't, just let Vicki know and she will customise the spice level for you."
"Delicious food, cold beer, very chill ambience",I enjoyed every dish that I had here and one of the must try is the fried rice with its sambal chilli. Simply unforgettable.

This family run restaurant,"This family run restaurant is a long favourite of ours. Uncle Leo is an amazing host and the food is delicious and genuine. On top of that very reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend this restaurant! Our favourites: the tom yam, oxtail soup and the kampong fried rice are simply amazing!

Feeling welcoming to the restaurant and the beer price is reasonable for the surrounding. Enjoy the food and it‚Äôs fresh cook."
Leo Cafe Curry Mutton,"When I crave for mutton curry, only think of Leo Cafe. It is simply awesome as the mutton is so tender and the curry is really great. I can‚Äôt find the same great taste anywhere so far. Highly recommended to order Curry Mutton or the Fried Rice."
Great find,While staying in Singapore we stayed very near this restaurant and decided to try it out and glad we did as vicky could not be more helpful and the quality of the food was some of the best we experienced while staying there. The menu has a good choice of food to cater for all tastes and the drinks are very reasonable while there I had a good chat on a few occasions with her dad a charming gentleman and very helpful it a must try if you are in the area highly recommended
Family run and cheap drinks!,"We stopped by here twice now, and probably will again before our trip ends. Drinks seem far cheaper than other places in the area, family run with father and daughters, who all took the time out to make sure we were comfortable and happy, always give complementary peanuts with drinks. Brilliant small bar & restaurant. Can‚Äôt recommend enough!"
A real family experience,"We were visiting Singapore because my wife spent her very early years here when her father was in the RAF. My wife was really keen to eat some authentic Singapore cuisine which her Mum had learnt to cook when she lived here in the 1950s. Fried rice was top of the search list. We could not have done better than this small family restaurant. From meeting the owner to tasting the food it was an absolute delight. Mr Leo, the owner, is very kind and solicitous and he offered useful advice on the menu. We started with the wonderful spring rolls which were cooked to perfection, and then my wife was in heaven with her fried rice with chicken! I opted for the beef with black pepper and ginger and it was superb too. And all washed down with draft Tiger beer. An outstanding trip down memory lane. Vicki Leo, the daughter, popped out to see us and we almost felt we had had a family meal. Don't hesitate. By the way, the setting in Albert Street really feels like old time Singapore."
Stumbled upon this recommendation,Stumbled upon this recommendation thru TripAdvisor and so glad we paid a visit to Uncle Leo & Vicky! The restaurant has been here for 16 years and you can tell the from the food they served! Very delicious and price is very affordable. Plus points for the cheap beer as well! Prolly cheapest in town will be visiting again soon. Highly recommended
"This Restaurant is just amazing,","This Restaurant is just amazing, food is excellent and uncle Leo is always taking care of his guests. Perhaps the best cheap beers in town!"
"Stop looking, you need to eat here!",Indulge yourself in excellent local food. This family run business is highly recommended. Awesome food and affordable beer!
Lunch on CNY,Return customer. Excellent quality robust flavor into your palette and soul. Generous quantity friendly owner.
Great restaurant with personalised service,"We visited this restaurant several times for dinner while we were in Singapore.

It's a small intimate family owned restaurant with a good variety of meals in Albert square, set within a food court type setting. We were served by Leo himself and the meals cooked by the chef his lovely daughter we're good and tasty and range from Chinese cuisine to more contemporary Western dishes.

Of course there were no long waits and the food was always served hot. Some free candy for the kids doesn't hurt and great conversation with our host.

Overall a good experience."
"Super food, Super Host","Leo is a great host. I had come for take away food and ended up chatting with him while food was being prepared. Found Leo to be a very warm and nice person. He had suggested 2 mutton dishes both of which were very yummy.

Overall had excellent food and great experience. Definitely recommended"
Delicious and reasonably priced,"Delicious and reasonably priced food. We had a decent dinner for 2 and paid ~ $50 in total. The restaurant is run by a very accommodating couple, who made sure we had a pleasant experience. Quiet, comfortable outdoors seating. Nothing to complain about really."
Super friendly host and tasty food,"We visited Leo‚Äôs for dinner on a Saturday after we arrived in the morning.

The restaurant has a great variety of Asian food at affordable prices. Everything we had was fresh and tasty.
Seating is outside in front for the restaurant.
The owner and his daughter (who runs the kitchen) are great hosts, very friendly and attentive.

Wold definitely come back."
Best Feed,"LEO and Vicki are super welcoming and couldn't be more helpful when choosing tasty food to eat. Can make it spicy or mild, suitable to all taste buds. Flavoursome, delicious food. I will be back."
Best food in Singapore,"I have eaten here a year ago and had nothing but amazing food and hospitality. Nothing has changed food is beautiful doesn‚Äôt matter what you order. My children even loved it, well done Leo and Vicki."
Terrific restaurant,Leo and Vicki are amazing. Great service and beautiful food. We all loved the spring rolls and butter chicken.
Really authentic Singaporean food,"Believe the fantastic reviews....Leo's is a must visit destination and a real hidden gem.

Two main courses, 2 beers and the legendary first class service from Mr Leo and his daughter Vicki was just $$52.

Fresh food made to order, superb flavours and service to match make this place a real find.

Many thanks for making our visit such a special occasion."
Hi we just went and experienced,Hi we just went and experienced leos based on trip advisor reviews. not only was the food great leo and his daughter were super nice . They prepared the food to our liking for spice and we really enjoyed the experience ! The wine choice was also nice and the price was very fair for singapore . Thanks Leo and your daughter you made our day !
good food at a lovely square,"Staying at the Village Hotel Albert Court Hotel it was very obvious for me to go out and have a drink and dinner at the traffic-free Albert Court just in front. For dinner I selected the 'Leo Cafe& Restaurant' with pleasant outdoor seating. The prices seemed very reasonable.

There was nobody around, when I arrived and nobody came later on. This surprised me, because the food offered, half Chinese, half international, is very good. I had a 'Baby Kai Lan' (a cooked Chinese Broccoli) with Seafood, all perfectly done, especially also the spicing. The seafood consisted of shrimps, calamari, crab and slices of fish cake. With it I drank a half pint of Tiger Beer.

When finishing my dinner an elderly Chinese man sat by my table and we had an interesting conversation. It was Leo himself, the owner of the place"
Amazing,Have been in Singapore for 6 days now and this has genuinely been the most delicious meal we have had since our arrival. Incredibly kind hosts and truly incredible food.
Delicious food,Delicious food and very kind personal. They have gluten free and vegetarian options. They are located in a very nice square where you sit al fresco. I will definitely come back next time I visit Singapore to eat again the vegetarian fried noodles.
Delicious Dinner,"In a courtyard called Albert Court is a surprising little restaurant called Leo Cafe. Id seen reviews and decided to try it. It is not fancy. It doesn't impress looking at it, but what matters is the food and service: Excellent ! We enjoyed some nice cold beers and ordered several dishes with help on how spicey to have them prepared. They were all delicious and the quality of the seafood was very apparent. I recommend this for a very good dinner."
Excellent place to have dinner,"Visited here again on our most recent trip to Singapore. Greeted warmly by the proprietor. The food is so good here, reasonably priced and freshly cooked to order. You can choose how spicy you want your food, it is good to have such a choice as everyone's taste is different. Highly recommended. Visit, you will not be disappointed."
A great location with very tasty meals!,"We've been at Leo's for a late dinner at 10 pm on a Monday evening with three persons. We were very warm welcomed and got a nice table. After a short while we got - first - our beers and - second - our meals. As starters we had Tomatosoup and Springrolls and as main dishes noodles in different variations. Everything was really tasty.
I must say a great THANK YOU to Mr. Leo!
So"
Very authentic restaurant!,"Flow and Michelle brought us there for Tom yum soup and black pepper beef(if I didn't take it wrongly..) etc.

I love the outdoor ambiance, the uncle Leo, he is very friendly. And the food is awesome especially the black pepper beef has amazing taste!! Higly recommend it to everyone!"
This place and it‚Äôs family never disappoint!,Lovely evening and it is always a pleasure being welcomed by uncle Leo. The food is genuine and excellent. Love the atmosphere and attention you get as customer!
You must eat here when in Singapore.,"friends brought me here. the food is delicious, service is excellent, But uncle Leo is the best and entertaining"
Excellent quality and choice,My family (wife and 3 older children) enjoyed an excellent evening at this restaurant. The restaurant is family run and very friendly. What drew us to eat here was the mix of local and international cuisine which meant that even the most fussy teenager could be catered for at the same time as others enjoying local cooking! All choices were tasty and well received. Thank you.
The Best,Absolute must if you get the chance food is outstanding and the friendly service is second to none thank you Vicki for an unforgettable meal first class !!
More for tourist,Food not bad. A quiet place for gathering. Feel that this place is more for tourist. close by Village Hotel Albert Court
The most genuine people and nicest services in singapore,"I came here with my Bf. We found this place online and we love it immediately when we arrived there. We were greeted warmly by Mr Leo and his family. They serve really good local food and also western food. Their Indonesian oxtail soup is my favourite. It‚Äôs so flavourful and delicious and also addicted. Mr Leo will chat with us when we finished our meal and he is a real lovely person. If you want a real genuine service and semi local scene in Singapore, u must come here ! Love it!"
Great place,"I stayed at the Village Hotel and this restaurant was conveniently situated in the court yard. Mr Leo and his daughters were very welcoming and kind. During my 7 day stay I ate there about 4 times. the food was delicious,tasty and portions were generous. I especially enjoyed the fish and chips and Prawn Korma. I would go back there anytime."
Must visit,"Hidden gem in plain sight! The owner welcomes you personally, staff is very attentive and the food... is absolutely delicious! This restaurant is well worth the trip from every corner of Singapore. Prices are very affordable, for example 10,- sgd for 2 mugs of tiger beer is a rarity in expensive Singapore. Foodtime: the oxtail soup is excellent, and for beef lovers, try the pepper beef in ginger. They have a small outside seating capacity so making a phonecall before heading over is a smart thing to do."
"Great find, great food","Leo‚Äôs was recommended by friends and we are very pleased that it was. We were greeted by the owner and his daughter who made us feel welcome from the start and right throughout our evening. My husband had the chicken curry and I had the butter chicken. A big tick from both of us. Tender juicy chicken with loads of flavour. Cold beers to go along with our yummy dinner, casual atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle, really lovely setting. We will be going back to try more of the food."
Nice place,Fantastic food as spicy as you like friendly staff good location from surrounding hotels 0and cheap beer
A beautiful hidden gem!,"My Partner really like to treat ourselves to some simply delicious indian and Asian cuisine, and Leos really does deliver.
Great prices, amazing food, (Prawn Kumar and pineapple (rice are to die for!), and very quaint setting in Albert Court.

And Mr Leo and his assistant are so welcoming.

Highly recommend, be it for one person, 2 people or a group .."
