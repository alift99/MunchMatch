"Nice food, great service, excellent view","Had lunch with a friend.
You get to choose the starter, the main and the dessert.
Food is nice and looks very pretty.
Lunch options are not as much as dinner.
Reasonable pricing.

Ended off with a small piece of birthday cake and the staff sang birthday song.

Wonderful!"
Exquisite vegetarian food experience,It was such a surprise to find a fine dining restaurant that was a 100% meatless! Food was beautifully presented on a variety of eclectic crockery styles. It tasted very good too and the customer service was outstanding. As a vegetarian I was thrilled with all the options on the menu… my meat eating husband joined me and also enjoyed the food. Lovely view from the roof top too!
Good Value Lunch Set,"I never enjoy meatless or Vegan meal. Came here as gf is a Vegan and I read good reviews of this place. Indeed I was impressed! Set lunch is only 35+ per pax and comes with a glass of beverage! We have 1 Prosecco each (Taste ok not great a bit too warm). Food presentation was good and Mushroom steak was very good. Of course I'm still hungry after the meal. Total damaged is SGD 89. I thought was a steal considering how expensive dining out is these days. Ambience was great as we sat by the glass panel great views and place is still air condition.
Wine by the glass selection is poor. Pls improve :)"
Average Food. NOT fine dining,"I would describe the food at Joie as average. The only course which really amazed me was the chefs selection to start, it was really tasty and the flavours worked well together (probably the saving grace of this meal). My main course (the truffle risotto) was poorly done. The rice was over-cooked and tasted like rice pudding. They served it with a potato croquette which would have been nice on its own but definitely did not accompany the risotto well. They also added some sort of coleslaw on top which ruined the taste of the delicate truffle. Eating this reminded me you should never eat Italian food outside of Italy! The rest of the courses were average for the price you pay. I also found that the courses came out way too quickly - the whole meal was finished in 50 minutes. The staff did not ask us once if we enjoyed the meal or the courses which I found quite rude. They did not introduce 4 of the courses which you would expect when having the tasting menu. I think Joie has a lot of potential but needs a lot of work to make it more special. There needs to be more thought put into the flavours of their dishes."
Excellent service and vegetarian cuisine,Never thought vegetarian food could be so elegantly delicious! A vegetarian menu degustation that delights the palate. And service was excellent!!
Our family time to savour meatless cuisine,"This restaurant isn't suitable for those in a hurry. Food here is meant to be enjoyed together with those in your company (i.e. those accompanying you). Hence they take their time to serve you your next item only after you've completed the preceding one. To me, it's like Japanese European fusion meatless dining."
"Nice idea, delicious pictures, awful food","After reading very positive reviews expectations were high. Now that the dinner is over, I'm confused.

The concept of the restaurant is good and menu items feel imaginative. Service was polite but hurried. Wine list looks decent in Singapore terms but in practice most of the wines were not available. When it comes to the most important part, execution fails big time and the food ranges from ok to unedible.

Chefs selection of assorted platter included small watery mushroom, nice wasabi cracker and dessert-like raspberry bite on a soggy cracker. Charcoal coated tempura platter was fancy looking but not really light as tempura should be but quite greasy instead. Mascarpone and watermelon takaki with chips was the tastiest part of the meal but lacked finesse.

Luke warm and watery Japanese kunbu broth with tofu did not really have much taste and the slight taste it had was unpleasant.

The main of truffle risotto was nothing short of a bad joke. In reality the portion was overcooked unpleasant tasting porridge topped with a deep fried vegetable patty and a piece of a soggy mushroom. Everything else than a truffle slice on top of it all was plain bad and left awful aftertaste.

I was hoping the dessert to save the experience but unfortunately it did not. Coconut and blueberry cake top layer was decent but the bottom part was left alone after one bite."
100% Vegan Meal,We were 2 couples looking for a change in menu. At most restaurants the menu will contain some meats and/or seafood in their courses. At Joie the whole menu is only vegetarian (vegan). Each dish was well prepared and presented. It tasted good albeit some dishes had different textures and taste. We enjoyed the differences and the meal was accompanied with wine and sake. The service was friendly and good. The server was entertaining as well. The pricing for a 7 course meal is acceptable. At the end of the meal we the males were 80% full while the ladies were full!
Review of Joie by Dozo,Had a great dinning experience at Joie. Staff in charge Alex wong was very humorous and entertaining. Food is very good. Recommend people to come and try this !
Great ambience and good food !,We visited Joie yesterday and had a great time. The 7 course dinner was amazing and the service was fantastic! Would definitely go there again.
Best fine dining Vegeterian/Vegan Restro!,"All of the variants were amazing and tasty. The afternoon course set is just perfect in portion and loaded with different variants. Each and every recipe by Joie is instagram worthy as well as tastes unique. I would like to take an opportunity to recommend this place to all as a visit here will leave you with a great memorable experience. However, the price is also really reasonable. Just avoid taking the vegan cake as dessert, look for another variant.

Value for money : 4.5/5
Ambience: 4.5/5
Food - Taste and Quality : 4.8/5
Food - Presentation : 4.9/5"
Incredible experience,What an incredible gastronomical experience. Wonderfully plated food. Beautiful venue and wonderful service. I highly recommend!
Business lunch. comfortable setting,Business lunch. comfortable sitting. Food presentation was fabulous. Tasteful and definitely palate friendly.
A real find,"Beautiful presentation of dishes , including the starter drink , painstaking and excellent service and a scenic location on the rooftop floor of Orchard Gateway make this restaurant a real treat. Only cavaet is that getting to the restaurant may not be so straightforward: you have to go to the 11 th floor and then go up one more floor from there.

There are al fresco tables but very few: 2 or 3."
"Inventive food, but dated decor and ambience","This is my second time trying Joie’s 7 course vegan dinner, and as much as I really want to love this place, I don’t think the ambiance aligns with the “high end” cuisine they are going for.

Overall their dinner is good value for the quality of food you get. The presentation of each dish is nice, and the enthusiastic waiters attentive. I also love their efforts to bring high end vegan/vegetarian food to the SG restaurant scene.

Having said that, the restaurant ambiance and decor is a bit of a let down if they want to be seen as “high end” dining. The restaurant is in big need for a renovation, quite tacky. They could probably charge a lot more for their 7 course menu if they modernize the place and make it less cold.

I went for a birthday. They sat us in a shared side room which looked like an office meeting room. It all felt a little like an airport lounge, from the cardboard lady at the entrance, the purple neon lights, the (very) bright lighting, lack of table cloths and retro glass walls. Unfortunately the place doesn’t feel quite right for a special celebration despite the great food. I do hope they improve the ambiance as this place could easily be amazing."
Worth a try!,Went for lunch for the 6 course meal and would say it is definitely worth the $40 per person. Everything we ordered was delicious and beautifully presented. My favourite item was the truffle soup. Special shoutout to the servers for their warmth and exceptional service.
Food and service is on point!,Delicious food! For $70 you get a 7 course dinner with fantastic service and a full belly at the end ... pretty great value! Oh and SIT OUSIDE at dinner time! It’s windy and beautiful! The food is really good. I wouldn’t go as far as saying “fine dinning” cause I think some of the dishes are over complicated/structured. The food is delicious though and I highly recommend . Wine menu is lacking but they have delicious teas!
Overrated,"Fairly overrated. I like the concept of a fine dine vegetarian restaurant, esp if it is multi-course. But the food here left one wanting and the service was inattentive. Give this one a miss."
5 stars experience,"Amazing presentation of the food, absolutely delicious. My table was served by Alex, very attentive, making sure we were well taken care of. The joyous graduation celebration has been elevated."
Amazing experience,"The food was pretty delicious and aesthetically very appealing. The best part was service; waiters were most pleasant, took great care in detailing out ever dish, taking pictures, celebrating my husband's birthday. Overall, very satisfying experience."
Lunch,1st time visit a vegetarian restuarant so expecting the dishes will be boring but turn out out of my expectation! The foods and service was great! Worth to go.
Affordable and amazing dining experience,"Was searching for an Omakase restaurant but found this instead, the staff takes time to introduce each item along with how it's supposed to be eaten. Really friend and helpful too, especially the two staff who served us, one of him is named Alex."
Excellent Vegetarian Fine Dining at its highest level.,Great presentation of good. Taste absolutely divine and awesome service. Such a delight to experience Vegetarian Dining at its highest level.
Birthday celebration for my mum 86yrs old,"Highly recommend this restaurant if want something out of box, creativity and reasonable quality food.

Surprise the portion is just nice, filling . Good restaurant , ambience , food offer and accessible by Mrt and friendly for wheelchair , take Mrt “Turn Left from Mrt Somerset exit gantry) , hit Orchard gateway lift B1 , take another lift from shop Under Armour and there lift hit straight to Level 12 rooftop .

Washroom for handicapped is accessible and near to restaurant too.

Go during weekday lunchtime 12noon , price reasonable and service good .

When restaurant heard of mum aged 86 birthday, prepare another 2 wellwishes serving and for us. Really touched and appreciate much their kindness....

Thanks Lord God for blessing us for the trip and the meal ."
EXCELLENT,"We visited Joie restaurant early April. It was our first time to try a vegetarian cuisines and it turned to be an unforgettable experience. We love the food, the ambiance, and the service.

Thank you to all the staff who generously explain all the dishes to us. For their patient and attentiveness to all our needs.

We will definitely recommend this restaurant to our friends. Thank you Joie! Cheers!"
Fantastic,"What a find Joie was. The 7 course set dinner was an absolute delight, not a single 'miss' in any of the dishes as presented, and excellent and attentive service. A lovely evening."
The set lunch was a selection,"The set lunch was a selection of 6 dishes. We will given 4 options for each dish. Perhaps it was due to the options we chose, all failed to catch our attention. They tasted more like the dishes commonly dished out in a Chinese wedding, rather than the French-Japanese cuisine the restaurant has purported. Perhaps it’s time to refresh the menu to go back to its roots.

Nearing the end of the meal service, only 3 tables of guests remained. One followed by another, the kitchen staff walked into each of the empty glass private rooms and started their break, such as napping or playing mobile games. We could see their every action, which is a little off-putting as we were still having our meals. Hope that management can consider giving their staff a dedicated resting spot.

Overall, it’s not a worth the price for the set menu. Unlikely to return unless there is a change in menu and price review."
Amazing & Wonderful,"My wife booked this resturant as it catered for us being vegan and suited our fine dining wanys. It definately exceeded our expectations. The meals not only presented well, but tasted amazing. Our waiter Alex was also excellent and provided some wonderful recommendations. This is a must vist for anyone looking for a vegan or vegetarian experience."
Memorable Time at Joie,"The food at Joie is beautifully presented and tasty. It offers fine dining experience with great service and ambience.

I had visited Joie several time with family, friends and colleagues. Most of them are non-vegetarian. They love the food and place too, and in turn brought others to this nice restaurant.

Recently, I reserved the private room (complimentary) to hold a surprise birthday gathering. We had the 6-course lunch set which is very reasonably priced for each in the group. It was a special and memorable experience."
Very good food and service,"We held our solemnization and wedding lunch on 28 Feb 2020 at Joie. One of their staff, Alex, was very patient and accomodating to our requests. He also gave very useful feedback that aided us in our wedding preparations.

Needless to say, our guests were very impressed with Alex and his team's service. They also enjoyed the food very much as it was delectable in both taste and presentation (i.e. most of our guests are not vegetarians). The director of Joie also made a visit during the wedding lunch and offered his hospitality.

The venue, being located at the rooftop, offered spectacular views and was a wonderful choice for our event. We are so glad to have chosen Joie to hold our special day. Kudos to the Joie team!!"
Best vegetarian meal ever!,"Dinner for 2, sitting on the balcony high above Orchard Rd, and enjoyed the most sensational vegetarian meal we've ever had. First time visit an d will definitely be back. Friendly, knowledgeable, attentive and very detailed service, spectacular presentation and a taste experience that just kept on coming! Amazing"
This restaurant is a hidden,"This restaurant is a hidden gem in the heart of SINGAPORE. It is an easy walk from Somerset MRT and is accessible via elevator on the TOP floor of the mall. It commands decent views of the city centre.

The food is a wonderful surprise like no other place I’ve visited. If you brought people here and did not tell them it was vegetarian I suspect they might not find out even after they have eaten.

If you look at the pictures enclosed you may well understand what I mean.

The staff were very knowledgeable and explained each dish in detail. The wine list was very decent too. The price was reasonable too for this high end, casual dining experience. We will be back!"
Delicious Vegetarian Food,This is one of the best vegetarian restaurant I hv tried so far. It is cozy and has a nice ambience.It has rooms for a group of 6-8.The Place is suitable for groups or date nights.The food is beautifully decorated and every course is delicious.The service commensurate with the price you pay. The set lunch is abt $40 whilst the dinner is about $60+.The only wish I have is that they should hv different menu for dinner and lunch.
Great Food and great service,"We went there last week and really liked the 7 course dinner. The service was really nice and there is a very good value for the money. We are not vegetarian, but we didn‘t miss meat at all in the courses. Would definitely recommend it and go there again!"
Valentine’s Day Celebration,Absolutely amazing place to celebrate Valentine’s Day. Amazing dinner and amazing service by waiter Alex👍🏻
Wonderful lunch! Would recommend to anyone,"As a vegan with a non vegan partner I am always looking out for restaurants which we can both enjoy together. Joie hit the mark beautifully. While they don't offer meat the owner's mission to share flavourful meatless dishes with the average omnivore was written up nicely on the tables and really rang true for my partner as we both enjoyed the flavours of all our dishes very much!

Beyond taste, Joie hits the marks of fine dining with great service, beautiful dish presentation, surprise details and great care in the entire experience from start to end without any pretentiousness that you might expect from a restaurant in the fine dinning category. It is also very reasonably priced.

Adam, our primary server, was very warm and took great care of us for the afternoon. I liked his style a lot and felt at ease straight away. He even offered to take our photo at the end of the meal without our asking which was a nice memento and something we usually don't ask for.

At the time of choosing our dishes Adam was great about calling out a few ingredients or aspects of a dish to check that it would be to our liking and if not, guide us into ordering a different dish. I thought this was really wonderful and we ended up with dishes that were really to our liking. The only small comment for improvement I could make is something that probably isn't any issue for very many people. But as a vegan, I am not looking for vegetables to be prepared in such a way as to resemble meat or flesh. I understand that is a popular and familiar entry point for omnivores to approach meatless dishes and I assume it takes a high skill level to pull something like that off in the kitchen. For example one element of the starter assortment was a carrot prepared in a way that was very reminiscient to me of fish in texture, not in taste. But it was too weird for me to eat the second piece so I gave it to my partner. Don't get me wrong, the flavour of the piece I had was very good and my partner loved everything about it. So it's just personal preference if you have a thing about avoiding dishes that resemble meat or fish, maybe that can be pointed out by the staff at the time of ordering in the future.

We both really enjoyed everything and look forward to visiting again next time we are in Singapore!

Thank you Adam and thank you Joie - I wish you a long, long success introducing many more people to the deliciousness of meatfree eating."
"Awesome food, great service & nice ambience","My SG friend recommended this veg restaurant to me and we had a wonderful lunch here during my recent trip to SG. The food was really awesome and each dishes was beautifully presented! We were delighted by the excellent service, because at the end of our lunch they surprised us with a dessert plate that came with a chocolate-scripted “Welcome to Singapore”, we were absolutely blown away by the gesture. Definitely recommend it~"
"Great service, high professional standards - will come back","Joie was amazing in terms of service standards - cheery, prompt, professional and warm. We were very pleasantly surprised with the level of service we received.

The food was tastefully prepared and presented. You can tell by the presentation of the food that the chefs are proud of what they do, even if the ingredients are not particularly expensive for some items. We loved the six-course lunch set.

The ambience - at the 12th floor of Orchard Central - was really nice as well.

All in all, we would return in a heartbeat."
CNY Luncheon 2020,"First dining experience in a vegan restaurant and it had an interesting concept. Overall great service from the staff especially Alex who attended to us and explained to us the dishes very well from their vast menu, interesting food and good ambience. Thanks for your service! :)"
Best vegetarian restaurant!!,"Have been in search for good restaurants around sg with my vegetarian mom and wow Joie at OC was by far one of the best! In terms of service(easily Michelin standard), plating, taste, it was all nothing but perfection. They have a great team there! Impressed! Thank you!!"
Wedding Anniversary,The food and service in JOIE was wonderful. Thanks Alex for the fantastic service! I would recommend all my friends to try it out. Cheer!
Great experience,Definitely a great place for an occasion! I visited there when I was traveling to Singapore. Very fancy meals with great presentation + friendly staff. Especially vegetarian sashimi blew my mind. I would definitely recommend this place!
Perfect wedding dinner!,"Our daughter decided to get married to her boyfriend over the holidays in Singapore. We had the solemnisation ceremony followed by a small dinner at this restaurant in their private dining room.

The access in setting up the room and making all the arrangements beforehand was excellent. We felt reassured that the staff, especially John and Alex, would follow through on fulfilling our wishes. We booked the large private room enclosed by windows on 3 sides. The room was made available to us to decorate, and the tables set up as we had requested for our small party of eight.

We ordered off the menu. The food was beautifully presented and very tasty. The service was great. We brought our own pink champagne which the restaurant chilled and served. The event was flawless and a great hit.

Many thanks to Joie, and especially to John and Alex for helping make a happy occasion very special."
Nice food and humorous staff!,"It was our 1st time visit the restaurant and we had no idea what to choose for the food. But the staff Alex was very helpful and introduced the food to us in a very funny way.
Personally, i was really impressed with the ""sashimi"", the taste and its presentation! Taste really like a real fish ; presentation in very nice way.
The signature dish ""monkey mushroom steak"" is also another food that i would like to highlight! The mushroom is so soft and dip w black pepper sauce, excellent!
I love the mushroom soup as well, because even after finished dish, i can stil feel the taste stay inside my mouth...
And i also ordered the classic desert, lava cake w ice cream. Hmm, it is good through but if it the inner can be more lava and more chocolaty then would be better.
We've the welcome drinks and special made drinks from Alex!! It was good but i think it can still improve which... blend the ice longer so it wont be so rough..?
Anyway, our overall experience for the food was great! Nevertheless, i would like to thank you alex for his great effort and make our diner so fun :)"
Perfect place for fancy vegetarian meal,"We always go to dozo when we want an original and vegetarian lunch or dinner.
They serve only 6 or 7 courses set meal with a choice for each course. The portion is just nice and the food is very creative, and taste great.
The service is always spot on, professional and friendly.
We will come back again and again!"
Tasteful Course Set,"Impressive food display and exquisite taste. The service staff (Alex) was helpful, professional and humourous. He made sure we know how the food was prepared and sparked curiosity, as he led us into a self discovery of the taste."
Epitome of Great Service!,"It was my first time at this restaurant and the experience I got was amazing! I booked this restaurant without any expectations as I was just looking for a nice vegetarian restaurant for a Christmas dinner with a friend. However, the service rendered at the restaurant was top notch! Staff around were friendly and wore great big smiles! - it really brighten my day despite all the rain and gloomy skies!

I would also like to specially thank Alex for the first class service! - he made every dish a mystery to your taste buds before you dig in! He was smiley, jovial and polite. Thank you for the laughter and entertainment each time you present a dish!"
For the discerning palate,"Today is my first dining experience at Joie by Dozo. I have been hearing the good review of the food and it is listed on my dining list with my mom who is vegetarian. I felt the warm hospitality as I stepped in the posh fine dining setting. With the staffs all so smiley and assisted on my food order as they recommended the signature, popular dishes and also based on their personal preference such as recommending a not-too-sweet dessert. Their knowledge and experience were professional. After the meal, their friendly staff would approach for feedback, asking which dish do we like , etc. I think it is very important to ask for feedback to hear the good thing they have been doing and also what to improve on. But basically we really love the dining experience and strongly recommended people who are not vegetarians , should also give a try. Meatless are delicious too."
Enjoyable lunch!,"Visited Joie few days back when my friend decided to give me a birthday lunch treat. I’ve been there a few times before so I know how good the food and ambience of the place is like. Needless to say, the food was amazingly delicious, and food was served readily and very promptly shortly after we finished our courses, which definitely was a big plus-point given that we don’t have to wait for long at all wandering around why and how come the next course isn’t here yet, which also shows how attentive the waiters there are as well. Pretty ambience and a complimentary birthday cake with beautiful wordings and decorations by the side was also served out at the end of the meal too. The staffs always patiently shared and explained to us about the food, with a smile each time just when each dish was being served so we understand clearer how to better eat and enjoy the food. And at the end Alex also chatted and asked for our feedback on anything that can be improved on. Overall excellent service and I highly recommend Joie if you are looking for a vegetarian decent dining place in town!"
Wonderful lunch,"Would highly recommend this place, the staff were fabulous and very knowledgeable about the dishes. The food was well though out and presented very nicely"
Great food and nice servicing w Alex,Wonderful servicing.. nice food... especially the japanese sashimi and the coconut false cake dessert Great for events and dating...
My fave in town!,"Outstanding food (just any!), adorable creativity n concept with awesome staffs! We were granted one of the private rooms, guess bec we just arrived from the airport. But overall the ambiance is classy n not kitschy. 😉 A table reservation is an advantage."
Fun dining experience with interesting and delicious vegetarian food!,"One might not even realise it's a vegetarian restaurant at all with the creative culinary skills in place. There's the vegetable sashimi, where the 'salmon sashimi' is being substituted and make alike with carrot. The mushroom steak is also excellent in taste. All the dishes were also beautifully plated.

Our server Alex was attentive and made our dining experience fun and joyful, together with his colleague Baby.

This restaurant is definitely worth a visit!"
Fusion Vegetarian,Nice food and they make good effort in presenting their food too. Ingredients used are natural with no mocked meat. Cosy environment and nice embience especially suitable for family and friends gathering. Their staff are well trained and specifically introduce each dish upon serving. Special thanks to Alex and Baby for their attentiveness. Will come back again.
Great foos,My girlfriend and I had dinner tonight. We weren’t sure what to expect and we loved it. The food is tasty and presentation is beautiful. The menu is varied and the 7 course dinner was amazing. I would definitely go back for q special occasion. The mushroom steak was my favourite by far
Friendly staff and awesome food,"Food display is exquisite, taste is rich. Service staff - Alex and Andy are both very friendly and helpful."
Great food and presentations!,"Great food and presentations! Excellent environment and services, All staff were friendly and attentive. Alex in particular made the guests a joyful experience !!"
Highly recommended even for non vegetarians,"Superb service and great dining experience. Alex and team was thorough in sharing details of each course. They also were very thoughtful when it comes to special arrangements for birthday occasion.

Food wise.. coming from a carnivore (non-vegetarian)‘s point of view, this restaurant serves delicious food comparable to flavourful non-vegetarian dishes. Must try!"
Alex explanation is perfect,"Good service and good food. Location is good, atmosphere great. Can bring along your family and friend for private room."
"Great food, great service!",Great concept with beautiful plating. Excellent service from the team. Server explained every element of the dish when serving.
Good food and great service,This restaurant serves amazingly good vegetarian cuisine. Every dish is thoughtfully created by their chef. Their service was excellent too. We are impressed with Alex’s service. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Amazing server,"Was served by a guy called Alex Wong, really funny and expressive in the dish. Food is good, will surely be back!"
Excellent!,Great gourmet vegetarian cuisine. Unique innovative tasty dishes and warm courteous professional service. The venue is also fantastic with a stellar view of Singapore. Two thumbs up!!
Excellent food and service,"Brought my taiwanese relatives and they were impressed by the passionate staff, excellent food, and good service."
Unique,"Went to joie for my birthday ...two couples. Enjoyed a 7 course meal, not cheap but was worth the experience.
Alex was our server made the evening rather jolly.
Food was great ...most creative I’ve had and all vegetarian was a bonus for us.
Although it mentioned rooftop so we were expecting to be seated outside but we were given a private area which was intimate but extremely chilly so make sure to take a shawl or a cardigan.
The place can be tricky to find:)"
Unique vegetarian dishes,"We we so impressed to taste unique taste, incredible vision and to be in present of so kind staff. Dishes not only looks like an art, but are so healthy and good for vegetarian. You have vegan options also. Go and taste everything on the menu! We will be back!"
Good experience,"Joie by Dozo is a fine dining pure #vegetarian #restaurant that fuses French and Japanese cuisines. It’s unique, it’s an experience, a very rare combo and hence a tad pricey. MRP is 45$ per head fixed set lunch meal - although #PPT recommends you take the 10 voucher booklet and then the price comes down to 38$ per head. They serve a six course meal and in not a hurried manner. So if you have a group of 6 pax or more, it’s advised to book a private room of your own - that helps kids & folks talk at own audio levels! The staff explain every dish in detail and also help you make your choices. They also celebrated a birthday of one of our hosts with cake and candle. Overall they were nice and funny to interact with. The hotel is located on rooftop of Orchard central and has complete wheelchair access even from the MRT & Bus stop - one of the beauties of #Singapore which probably no other country has, at this level. Refer to the images of every dish. Happy dining. Recommended for fine dining seeking pure vegetarians .. who are open to exotic cuisines.

Slightly adventurous and highly enjoyable,"This is an unusual restaurant, but absolutely worth a visit. The tasting menu is forces you to try an array of interesting dishes that were creative, striking, and delicious. They combine aspects of molecular gastronomy and food art, and the waiters are helpful in guiding you through the process.

Especially for vegetarians or those with dietary restrictions, a must visit!

Room for improvement: they could have a cocktail menu or more than the small number of wines by the glass."
Excellent food and service,"I was there with a group of friends, and was back for more with my family in the same week. Impressed with the creativity of the dishes and enjoyed them as well. The service was excellent and they were passionate about introducing the dishes, and their presentation and ingredients. Alex was especially passionate, attentive, and humourous."
Best Vegetarian in Town,"Took my vegetarian friends from out of town to Joie. It’s my favorite vegetarian in town not just because of the food being very creative and great tasting. The service and attention to details was amazing.

I walked in mentioning I couldn’t have a cold drink because of my cough, the next thing I know, the staff brought me a scarf.

The food and service was great as ever through out.
But knowing my friends were from out of town, they brought us a ‘welcome to Singapore’ desert. This is truly where that extra mile made such a difference. Bravo, and my friends from the US was so impressed."
Great Dining Experience with a tinge of Art,"If I could give a 6-star rating, I would love to do so for Joie by Dozo. The food was top notch; not only was it exquisite in taste, each dish was just like an art piece; so intrinsically done. A meat lover will be tempted to be a vegetarian at the end of the whole course.
It would be an understatement to comment that the service is good. At least for my family experience, it was superb. Special kudos to Alex and his teammates for being so friendly and patient in attending to us. Thank you."
Perfect for a Veggie celebrating their birthday,"I feel like it’s hard as it is to find vegetarian places in Singapore but a fine dining vegetarian place ??? Pretty impossible...but at Joie, I didn’t have to feel awkward asking the waiter/waitress if ____ is vegetarian because everything is !

Not only is the whole experience beautiful, the dishes were one of a kind! My favourite part was when they brought the deserts. Also they brought me a lovely cake in the end for my birthday!

Definitely coming back !
Thank you x"
Vegetarian Treat,"Loved our experience here. Catering to vegans and vegetarians, with cool semi private areas Joie really impressed me with its thoughtful menu and well-trainer staff. Dishes were beautifully presented and although above a mall, the view is out onto a leafy terrace and the Singapore skyline."
Great dining experience!,"I loved everything about Joie - both the ambiance and the food. And what I think makes Joie stands out (the food, of course) is their staff, which I think it's crucial for the dining experience. Alex, who served us last Sunday at 2 pm, was both professional and lovely. He was approachable and took very good care of me and the rest of the party. Thank you for the lovely service and definitely looking forward to coming back again soon!"
Beautiful food & presentation,"Excellent service, lovely ambience, great vegetarian cuisine presented in an exquisite manner. Loved everything & especially gastronomic chocolate desert!"
Wonderful birthday dinner,"It was my first time to have dinner at Joie, I was in Singapore for the F1 with all of my family and it happened to be my birth, and as my sister and her boyfriend are vegetarian we thought it would be nice to have dinner in a restaurant were they didn’t have to settle on the only vegetarian option. The restaurant is on the last floor of a mall, the view is great and the room itself was nice and airy, with simple yet classy design. The dinner is a 7 course menu where you have a choice of three or four plates for each course: we were worried 7 courses were going to be too much but each plate is on the smallish side and quite light so we actually ate everything. The waiter was very friendly and helpful, pointing out for us their more popular dishes and explaining everything throughly. The food was great, very tasty, unexpected and sophisticated and enjoyed even by those of us who are carnivores! In the end the waiter got out a brownie cake with a candle on it for me and sang happy birthday with us. It was a wonderful experience and I will be sure to go back next time I am in Singapore!"
Nice Vegetarian Restaurant,"This Veg Restaurant just local center of Orchard Singapore, and it’s fresh with good ingredients, if you are a Veg lover this is one of the place you can’t miss when you visit Singapore, and the staff Alex was extremely helpful and always attentive to detail, we will definitely can again!"
Beautiful presentations,Wonderful selections of fine food. The staff was super friendly and passionate about each dish brought to the table. Great value for the experience.
Birthday celebration,"Went for my birthday celebration with my family at Joie. We are meat eater but wanted to try a different cuisine for a special occasion. Knowing that it is a birthday celebration with family, they gave us a private room without extra charges. We chose the 7 course set dinner. This is a Atas dinning for vegetarian food. Every dish is nicely presented and the taste is good too, some special and not the usual vegetarian food that you would expect.
Overall i’m Happy with the food and service. The only feedback for improvement is the place is getting a little run down, it is in need of a facelift!!! Hope they will renovate soon!"
Creative and shooting for a Michelin star,"This restaurant on the 12th floor of the Orchard Central mall offers commanding views over part of Singapore's skyline. But this is not the reason to eat here.
Joie is a 100% vegetarian restaurant that sets new standards for vegetarian food as well as layout: the restaurant has individual private dining areas in addition to more open dining.
The five course set menu (offering amazing value at less than SIN$ 70) offers a choice of dishes under the categories sides (starters), cold dishes (entrée), soup, mains and desserts plus a selection of imaginative cocktails. Dishes are highly creative (eg carrots made to resemble smoked salmon) and are artistically and appetizingly presented. Portions are small and light and therefore easily digested.
Three suggestions to improve this already excellent restaurant further:
1. Turn down the A/C. It was so cold, our party had to be supplied with blankets
2. Dishes are served at Usain Bolt speed. Less haste would have contributed to a more relaxed evening, and
3. We wouuld have wished for more pronounced flavours (especially in the mains).
Bottom line: one of the undoubted highlights of our recent stay in Singapore.

Outstandingly good veggie dining and great value too!,"Had been meaning to get to Joie for a while. Certainly didn't disappoint, indeed it was quite superb from start to finish. The team were really friendly and well informed and the service was slick and efficient throughout. The food is full on vegetarian, 7 taster courses packed with different flavours and really incredible presentation. Decent and reasonably priced wine list on hand too, overall it's very good value for the whole experience. Highly recommend the Monkey Head Mushroom Steak!"
Very good vegetarian rest,"Creative chaff with a very tasty food. From the appetizer to main dish , 5 courses which were very good. Highly recommended all the pic are 100% vegetarian"
Fine dinning,Excellent presentation and delectable vegetarian food. Totally enjoyed myself..Set dinner at $68++. A must visit.
Enjoyable vegetarian fine dining experience,The restaurant offers a 6 course set lunch which was very reasonably priced for the food and experience. Food is overall very good and well presented. The service staff are also friendly and patiently explained each individual course. I will recommend it for anyone who will like to celebrate any special occasion here.
Surprises and Indulgence,"The interior is of classic posh style with armchairs, chandeliers and black tables. So this is definitely a great choice for casual dates if want to impress. At parts of the restaurant, there are full glass panels that overlook the lush garden surrounding the restaurant. So request for a table in these areas if in the mood to enjoy beautiful scenery.

Refreshers, in the form of passion fruit drinks, are the first to come onto the table. Sweet and refreshing, they go pretty well with the baked udon and soba that look like uncooked spaghetti. Seasoned with parmesan cheese and herbs, the baked udon and soba make for quite addictive treats while waiting for the courses to be served.

I cannot wait to try Chef’s Selection of Assorted Platter when it arrives on my table because the trio of dainty, pretty morsels look so good. Recommended to start with the carrot piece at the centre, I carefully use a knife to nudge it onto fork while expecting it to taste like fresh, crunchy, mildly sweet carrot. After I pop it into my mouth, I am blown away by its taste and texture. It feels like salmon and paired with sea grapes, a kind of algae, I taste the umami of salmon! The dollop of cream on top adds extra savoury flavours to this creation, which is all good. Next to sink my teeth into is the rice cracker with dots of wasabi cream and fruit puree that are not only for aesthetic reasons, but also to incorporate some kicks to taste of the cracker. Raspberry sphere is an interesting creation in which the combination of slightly tangy raspberry juice and nutty pistachio works pretty well.

We know that cheese goes very well with mushrooms, and the appetizer of Gratinated Champignon with Morzarella just enforces this notion. The meaty flavours of the buttons mushroom and cheesy goodness of mozzarella hit a wide range on the taste spectrum.

Baby Root Vegetables Garden looks so pretty with edible flowers perching on top of the vegetables, and the taste matches up to its look. Mashed potato with truffle is the winner there. I had tried chawamushi with truffle, fries with truffle, but mashed potato with truffle is the best.

I am expecting Infusion with Cepes and Truffles to be good since it is hard to go wrong with mushrooms and truffles, the two ingredients that are packed with earthy flavours. And this soup meets my expectations. Pumpkin Velouté has the sweet earthy taste of pumpkin, just that it is less bombastic in terms of taste as compared to Infusion with Cepes and Truffles. It can be a crowd pleaser though.

Duo Ravioli Platter is impressively presented with a fancy glass lid put over the dish. When the lid is taken off, I am greeted by the sight of a pretty garden. I love the look of this dish. The filling of pumpkin ravioli tends towards the sweet side due to the use of quality pumpkin, but I find that when eaten on its own, it is a tad too sweet for main course. It tastes good when drenched in the accompanying savoury sauce though. Also helps that the dumpling skin is thin and smooth. Spinach ravioli is more nuanced in taste, so I prefer this instead.

I get to try the wild rice of my companion’s Wild Rice with Eggplant Terrine. I absolutely love its strong aroma of rice husk and the slightly chewy texture. I think the rice was cooked in broth since each grain is so flavourful. Wild rice is now one of my favourite rice variety.

The yoghurt in Yoghurt Pudding is pretty ordinary in terms of taste, but its texture is thicker and creamier, which is how I like it. The real star of this dessert is actually the mix of crunchy puffed rice and wheat flakes, whose texture gives the oomph to the yoghurt. In fact, the mix alone elevates the yoghurt pudding to awesome status.

Warm Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice-cream is a must-order. The dark chocolate cake is bursting with intense flavours. Baked to perfection, it has crust-like top and bottom that we enjoy munching on, and its irresistibly decadent molten filling flows out at a light stab into the cake. This reminds us of our favourite lava cake at Jewels Artisan. So savouring this dessert is like reliving a lovely dream.

Hawaiian Blue, a refreshing concoction of lychee and blueberry, may be saccharine sweet, but I enjoy sipping on it since I like lychee, and this drink happens to have strong flavours of lychee.

The service here is great. The service crew is very friendly and helps to make us feel very at ease despite the mismatch between the place’s posh setting and our very casual outfits.

Best vegetarian restaurant here."
A fantastic experience,"Joie by Dozo is an excellent restaurant, a little expensive but perfect for date or if you want a gastronomical food experience.
They have a 6 course set Vegetarian menu which is fantastic.
Since we were two of us, we could try two dishes in each course.
Loved the food and the presentation too.
Definitely recommend this place."
Wow...not what I expected! Amazing food artistery,I booked this restaurant not realising it was 'Meat free'. We went for the 7 course set menu and were not disappointed. It was like investigating and exploring a new way to taste differently presented food. The presentation was exceptional and the tastes were amazing!
Fantastic vegetarian experience,"This restaurant can be difficult to find. It’s on the 12th floor of the Orchard shopping centre. However, it’s worth the effort because it has an imaginative and interesting vegetarian menu served with flair. The six course set menu costs around $39. The menu has a choice of 3-4 dishes for each course. The presentation is beautiful and the food exquisite. The serving staff are attentive and explain each course as the serve it. One of my best dining experiences in Singapore."
The best non-meat dishes,"This is definitely not my first visit there but what keeps a meat eater from going back? The food. It is super-tasty and this is one of the best non-meat dishes I have ever tasted! It is so good that I brought my wife there for our anniversary and not to my surprise, she enjoyed every single dish that she ordered off the menu!

For our anniversary, they even prepare a surprise for us, a small chocolate cake.

The service: Excellent! Very entertaining server that attended to us.

Enjoyed the evening throughout"
Fascinating presentation of vegetarian food,"My wife and I are not vegetarians but we dined at Joie with friends who are vegans. Joie staff provided them with a more limited menu while we enjoyed the standard menu. Frankly, I enjoyed the experience, the presentation of the food and the innovative nature of the cuisine more than the food itself. I found some courses a little bland but the overall dining experience was very good. The staff were excellent including our server, Adam, who did an outstanding job advising us on menu selection and explaining all the dishes. The actual food was almost secondary to the total entertaining experience. And the cost was very reasonable."
"Amazing food, amazing staff","Lovely lunch at Joie, delicious food and the staff is super friendly! Definitely coming back!!! Highly recommend this restaurant!!"
The Best Mother's Day Dinner Ever!,"This restaurant was highly recommended by my brother's friend who was a non-vegetarian. We have finally gotten a chance to try this restaurant on Mother's Day and we was WOW-ed by the friendliness of all of the staffs in the restaurant.

We arrived 1 hour earlier than our reservation time & the staff was kind enough to have us seated. As both of my parents could only understand Chinese & very minimal English, the 2 gentlemen who were assigned to us as our waiters for the evening, were very warm towards our parents. They greeted them in Chinese & has even gotten them the Chinese menu. On top of that, they even explained to them of EACH of the dishes available & what are the recommended ones. That was SO helpful to my brother & I, as we are usually the ones who would need to digest all of the menu & translate/explain to them.

When each of the dishes were served, they took the time to explain to both of my parents (they ordered different dishes as well) & how to eat the food served to have the best enjoyment on their taste buds. They have also taken the time to ask if they have enjoyed the food (yes, they did not forget my brother & I either).

After the desserts & drinks were served, they surprised us with a platter written ""Happy Mother's Day!"" with a small piece of brownie for our mom! That is a very nice touch & it is an absolute surprise to our mom. She was so happy! The staffs took turn to approach our table to wish our mom's Happy Mother's Day too. They have even assisted us to take beautiful family picture when the brownie was served along with a lit candle.

At the end of the dinner, when we were walking out of the restaurant after the bill was settled, every staffs greeted us with ""Thank You!"" & ""Happy Mother's Day"", and man I tell you, this is one of the BEST service you could get from any restaurants in Singapore! You could feel their genuine attitude when they were conversing with us. This is how every service staffs should be!

Not to mention that the food was exquisite! Definitely will be back to dine with them again & will be recommending to all of our families & friends!
THANK YOU JOIE's TEAM!!"
Stunning Meat-Free Journey,"Joie offers a gorgeous, experiential (meat-free) set-menu that's a treat for the eyes and the palate. The lunch ($39) and dinner ($69) menu are the same, with the exception of an additional cold dish, but the cold dish was my favourite. The restaurant also has a warmer feel in the day-time, with light streaming in through the windows. At night it takes on a dark and slightly formal feel.

Service is friendly, and each dish is explained. The chef has designed some dishes to be eaten in a certain sequence or for ingredients to be combined in particular ways. It's exciting food and a lot of fun.

A tip for the restaurant owner - a hot drink does not count as a course. Other than that, this is definitely meat-free dining at its most interesting."
Wonderful total surprise,"We just happened on this place and were wow'd by the unique and excellent food, its presentation and wait staff! Highly recommend!"
Destination for vege foodies in the land of foodies,"The exuberance of passion of vegetarian eating reveals itself in the creations at Joie. Located on Orchard, in the Orchard centers, 11th floor, From a gracious welcome to delicious food, and their willingness to adapt incredients creates a Joyful experience.

FIne environment, great food, wonderful service, ...I am in.."
Perfect vegetarian choice!,I had some doubts when entered the place as we are vegetarian. We were served with delightful variety of vegetarian food. It was a set menu so it becomes lot more easier once choices are made!
Amazing experience!,Went there to celebrate my sister's graduation. One of - if not - the best vegetarian food I've had. The steak that they made out of the lion mane mushroom was very good! The service staff were professional and the ambience was great (we got to go into one of the rooms to dine). I would recommend this to people who are willing to spend a little more. It might seem a little pricey but I personally feel that it was worth it!
Great quality and awesome service,"The restaurant serves meatless food, but quality and taste are definitely not compromised. We had an outstanding experience and had great compliments after every course. The staff were very well informed about each dish and were very friendly. They volunteered to take pictures of us and even gave ideas on poses to liven the photo. Hearing that it was my bf's birthday (I made a note on ""special occasions"" under their online booking), they gave us a surprise with a small birthday cake and song, it was rly the cherry on top of the cake. Thanks for the lovely evening!"
Lovely 6 course vegetarian meal,"My wife and I went to Joie and had a good experience. They have a 6 course meal for lunch and 7 course for dinner. Lunch is about 46 S$ per pax inclusive of taxes. I liked everything that they served. My favorite was the truffle rissoto and the mushroom starter with cheese. Must try for vegetarians and vegans. They also have an eggless menu. They refresh the menu every 6 months or so. Location is nice, at the top of Orchard Central. Staff were polite and friendly. Service was great. The only thing is that the tables start to look very worn out and probably need a refresh."
Beautiful and relaxed meal,"The ambience and the concept (vegan) is truly beautiful. The place has Japanese and French influence. Even though it is vegan, the taste of food is really well created. Enjoyed the lunch! Worth a visit"
