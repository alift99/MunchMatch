Just average,"Average food and average service. Nothing special here and I expected more for an Indian restaurant here in Singapore. The fish was old and dry, though curry sauce was good. Mutton vindaloo was sold out so had a different mutton dish that dry and tough.
Overall experience was average and there are better places in Singapore and most other countries."
Disappointing Service,"I ordered the Mutton Mysore, a garlic nan and rice. The curry and rice arrived at the table almost instantly, which suggests they are cooking en masse and serving as ordered. The server was gone as quickly as he appeared, and certainly before I could ask for cutlery. I finally attracted a waiters attention and requested cutlery and napkins. I only received cutlery. It was now nearly ten minutes, certainly over five, since my food arrived so I started to eat assuming they had forgotten my nan. A further fifteen minutes later the server brought the nan bread. I only had a few pieces of mutton left, so I told him it was far too late and I didn't want it. The food was fine, although I didn't really enjoy it due to the poor service. When I went to pay, I told the cashier that I wasn't paying the service charge as the service was awful. She called the manager over and that was dealt with which is why I gave two stars and not one."
Excellent food and service,Excellent food and service! Always a good sign when there seem to be more locals than tourists. We tried a lot of the dishes and we couldn’t fault one.
Birthday dinner,Good food reasonable prices nice ambience Polite and obliging staff Cléan and virus proof with safe entry
Reasonable Price & Good quality,"This is the only restaurant that comes to my mind when I want to have something outside for my lunch or dinner. My husband and I are regular customers for their Fish Briyani for lunch and Naan(butter/plain/garlic) with Paneer butter masala and Mutton Mysore for dinner, which I would recommend trying at least once.

Price is also reasonable(less) compared to other restaurants on the same street but never less in the quality of the dishes and you get to pay only the amount in the menu card(no additional service charges)."
Affordable,"Price is affordable. Friendly staff. Nice enviroment. Located 15 mins walk from Tekka MRT Exit E. Suggest order ""small"" to share as portion is good for 3-5 people and you can order more dishes. A wide selection and choices for your taste bud."
Bad service for order via Deliveroo,"I write to convey my experience and unhappiness for my deliveroo order made on Saturday, 17th October for dinner about 7pm. I had just been discharged from hospital and we had decided to order in Gayatri's since I wasn't feeling too good to visit the outlet. Therefore ,my family and I, 4 of us had ordered to have a feast at home instead. Although there are tonnes of options for South Indian cuisine listed everywhere on Deliveroo,Food Fanda and Grab Food, with relatively affordable pricing, we still stuck with our decision to order from you'll as its one of our fav restaurants to frequent. But the experience we encountered via our delivery definately made us reconsider this decision. Firstly, we ordered all the dishes we liked but couldn't find White/Basmati Rice. I scrolled top and bottom but only could find Rice Set that comes with 2 vegetables. But that wasn't what we wanted. As an Indian Restaurant, and rice being a staple, we were puzzled on how there would be no rice in the menu. Nevertheless, still being keen to place the order we called your race course outlet directly informing of this dilemma. A lady had answered (I don't have her name as she was adamant on not providing it) and told me should we like to place an order for rice, we could choose the option for Papadam instead and they will replace it accordingly. So anyone in the right state of mind would assume, should I want 4 packets of rice I should choose 4 packets papadam and they would edit the order accordingly as spoken. And that's exactly what we did, placed an order for 3 packets of papadam at $1.95 each and called the lady to alert her of this special arrangement. We even mentioned please give us 1 papadam and 2 rice as the amendment for 3 packets papadam as previously discussed. This was confirmed and we prepared to enjoy our dinner to celebrate my disharge. Although it was a true hassle firstly to get the rice sorted, we didn't want it to get to us so we can get the food we like. Annnd the food arrives, with an overload of papadam and 1 packet of rice. Here we are hungry and excited to eat but there's only 1 packet of rice for 4 people. A little ridiculous considering all the effort put in to explain the order to the rude lady whom answered. I therefore call and try to find out why there is only one rice and the same lady says she could only give us 1 packet rice because it is $4.50 for each packet and our previous discussion with her to amend our 3x papadam couldn't cut it because $1.95x3=$5.85 would only entitle us one rice and papadam.Seriously?! we had ordered a variety of dishes amounting to about $60 and you could have added a packet of rice out of goodwill or even explained this to us when we called for the amendments. How were we to know the rice charges if it weren't even in the menu?When we called to ask the lady rudely passed the phone to a man I assume is the manager called Maniam whom also wasn't sorry at all about what had happened. He kept insisting we can only give what was paid for but how are we to pay for something that is not even on the menu or we know the price for?If we can order all the variety dishes, you think we can't order another packet of rice? Already I was not feeling too well and all we wanted was a good family dinner but no, it was ruined. We didn't have rice or even the fish gravy we requested for. We put in a special comment to request for fish gravy because we do not want the fish curry with fish since we already had fish varuval and fish cultlet, just the gravy would have been all we needed.But no, Maniam said tit needed to be ordered they don't even give complimentary fish gravy.How do I order if it doesnt exist in your menu?And considering we've been there to eat umpteen times I'm honestly appalled by this. I mean if i did a small order and you couldn't give me some gravy I may understand, but I did quite a substantial order but you can't provide some gravy?And to make it worse, we even heard the manager Maniam telling the lady on the phone, why didn't you just tell them we ran out of gravy thinking we couldn't hear and understand. It was so disappointing, and honestly a huge dampening of spirits for the family dinner we had looked forward to. I mean we had only asked for amendments for items not found in your menu and unimaginably rice not found for an Indian restaurant is absurd!And having to charge for a little gravy (non-existent in the menu as well) for a substatial order is penny wise, pound foolish. It has been time consuming to type this out to you but I would like to convey the bad and unexceptional service provided. As you are aware there are several restaurants available in the stretch of Race Course, please do not be over confident and lose long term customers for foolish reasonings. Keen to hear your reasoning."
Dinner at Gayathri restaurant,"Came for a dinner with family. Food was great as usual, and was fresh and hot. Good customer service and nice ambience. Will definitely visit again. Thanks."
Dinner with family,Great food & great ambience. Good service by staffs who are very attentive. Taste of food is above average.
Quite possibly the best curry meal we’ve ever eaten!,"Wandered past this place looking for the Mustafa Centre shopping mall and went back because it looked good, the food easily surpasses the look of the place. Tried a mutton dosa, a butter naan, butter chicken, pepper prawns and mutton mysore as a sharing platter between two. Each dish was better than the last but hard to pick the nicest, for me it was the mysore, for my companion it was the butter chicken but no morsel of anything was left uneaten. The staff were pro-active and helpful, altogether a superb experience and we will definitely go back for more. Great place, fantastic food."
Terrible experience,"Terrible experience, I reserved a table and instead of being led to a table with reserved tag (several reserved tables empty as it was early at mins past 7pm), was showed to table near the entrance. Told the staff I had a reservation but he insisted I take the table near the entrance and he simply walked away, so I was left to decide to take that or leave as the restaurant was fully booked for the evening."
Excellent service and food,"Excellent service along with equally excellent food. We were there with the lunch crowd, and most appeared to be local office workers. That’s a good sign, in our view."

Great service and even better food!,"This is my second visit here and so far, I've not been disappointed! On my prev visit here I tried the naan and briyani along with dishes like butter chicken, aloo gobi and gobi manchurian.

I love the butter chicken the most, so rich and indulgent — diets can stay away when you dine here! It's all worth it though. Service is also super attentive, friendly and warm."

Good dining experience,"Really good ghee dosa, good food in general, and great interiors! The service is good and prompt as well."
Solid Indian food 👌,"Really loved their chicken tikka, butter chicken masala, the butter naan, and the sweet lassi!! Will definitely come back!"
Poor quality food and lack of service,"The poori was very oily and thin; the appum was flavourless and the coconut milk was bland; the chicken tikka was full of spicy masala and lacking in taste, the biryani was average and the accompanying curry was full of pepper and lacking in taste. Very poor quality food overall which is very disappointing given the high prices. We ordered the tea which never appeared. Staff was at a minimum and seen to take an order but then never execute on it. Generally, not a good dining experience. Disappointing."
Yummy lunch at gayatri,"This is my first time at Gayatri, recommended by my colleagues. Totally enjoyed our time here. We ordered fish head curry, gobi manchurian, fried bindi, fish cutlets and briyani set. The service was good and the food was excellent. I'll be sure to bring my friends and family here for makan."
Delicious food,"Took some family who is visiting to Gayatri for Indian food and we were not disappointed! The service was friendly and prompt ! The food came out very quickly as it was all already pre prepared but the garlic naan was made to order.

We wanted the Masala Dosai but they don’t serve this till 3pm - So do note this point - however the food was all tasty and delicious"
Nice quail eggs,"Nice food, but the briyani rice is dry. The staffs are pleasant. The tea tastes good. Papadam wasn’t fried well."
Good food,A good restaurant with good ambience The waiters are very friendly providing a good service. Tasty and delicious food. Worth visiting again.
Top Indian Food in Little India,"Really good food in a nice (also Aircon’d) restaurant. Atmosphere nice with lots of local Indians eating here, which is a signpost the food is good. Service could be improved, but overall would recommend to those looking to taste India away from India."
A taste of India in Singapore,"The food tastes very good and I had the opportunity to try something different from the Indian food I am used to. The service is quite quick and simple; the dishes are really good and the prices are cheap.
Many local people inside the restaurant are a quality guarantee."
Excellent Food,"Great food with great hospitality. Enjoyed the briyani with garlic fish, chilli chicken, and metti prawn. Nice place to dine in 👍"
Lunch,Nice food. Good ambience. Will come again for family gathering. The fish briyani and mutton briyani is good.

"Delicious food, excellent service and great value for money","What more can I say, the service was excellent and the food served promptly. The food was delicious. I am leaving Singapore tomorrow, so wont be able to return in a hurry, I would be a regular if I was a local. Well done."
Food that feeds your stomach and your soul!!,"Awesome mutton dum briyani. The basmati rice was so fluffy and flavourful with every bite. Raita (yogurt with onions) complemented so well with the spices of the briyani. Highly recommend to come :) cosy atmosphere, great for families and friends!"
Good food and ambience,Went here for lunch after a work event. Tried the naan and butter paneer masala. I love the scent of the bread. It smelled fresh from the traditional oven. The taste of butter paneer masala was divine. I enjoyed every bite.
Good Indian Treat,"Lovely food. They serve vegetarian meat dishes like mock chicken and mock mutton dishes. They also serve non vegetarian dishes. They serve liquor, moderate pricing."
Great food,Great Indian food but service could be a little faster. Overall a good restaurant to enjoy some good food
Best lamb dum briyani,Always go here when I really feel like eating lamb briyani. Good service as well and reasonable pricing.
Best mysore mutton,Best mysore mutton I've ever tasted! Worth a visit. Posh setting too. Servings are a bit small but it is very nice! Fish head curry was okay. They are having a promo 85 dollars for a tasting menu. Not bad.
Excellent food as usual,"I had my lunch today and not surprisingly, it was good as usual. This time I tried their Chettinad Chicken and Pepper Prawn. It was fresh and delicious.

I was not aware of their catering services. I bumped into one of their management staff Mr Marimuthu who is in charge of their catering division. He briefed me on their capability to cater from small to large scale events. I was very impressed that they can cater for more than 500 guest. Price range in my view was very affordable as it starts from SGD12 for their catering package...

Excellent job Gayatri Restaurant!"
Briyani party at gayatri!,"Amazing food, we always come back for the mutton mysore and the briyani. Love the experience and will def recommend."
Good briyani,My colleagues and I love coming here for the dum briyanis. My favourite is the mutton dum briyani. Good service and friendly staff.
Appam jalla,My kids loves the appam jalla. But the chicken is quite spicy. However you can have it with tandoori chicken
Excellent food and service!,"Must try, food is good esp the butter chicken, naan & fish head curry. Excellent service and the ambience is lovely and clean. Nice place to dine with family n friends"
Good Briyani,"My friends and I had dinner at the race course outlet. The staff delivered good service. Also, I really loved the chicken briyani. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to others! :)"
Nice food and service,"The food as well as the customer service is good here, the restaurant has a clean and welcoming ambience."
One of the Best Briyani Rice,"Gayatri serves one of the best Briyani rice in Singapore. Its soft and fluffy and not oily.

Pair it with Chicken Masala or Mutton its an excellent combination.

Gayatri has a wide range of Wine selection which can be paired with both North or South Indian cusine."
Family gathering,"Good experience and good service, reminded of home in Singapore. The place has a good mix of Cousine"
