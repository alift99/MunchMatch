Good dining experience,"First and foremost, the staffs were friendly and helpful. They provided great customer services.

Secondly, the food spread, although not as much if compared to other places, was great. The (limited) varieties was good, seafood especially was fresh. The desserts corner was fantastic, small slices of cakes, bread pudding was yummy, there were ice-creams (and toppings) so that corner will be heavenly for those with sweet tooth. Because there was so much seafood (lobster, prawns,crayfish, shellfishes) , the restaurant could have offered a wider variety of sushi, but I understand that they also want to reduce waste.

Cooked food was nice, but we hope to see more varieties on top of the regular chicken/duck rice, steamed items. Perhaps, there may be other dishes that are served on other days and that we may have missed out.

Nonetheless, we enjoyed our dining experience there and will certainly come back soon!"
It was a very great dining experience,"We had a great day and its worth every penny. The varieties of food are all well considred. The venue is superb, food is wow, ambiance is super nice, plus a thumbs up to MS.VIC who assisted and serve us all through out our lunch. Its really indeed worth the experience if you top eveything with a very friendly staffs and well deserve thumbs up on the services..."
amazing dining experience,"had a great experience dining in Crossroads Cafe this afternoon, to celebrate mum‚Äôs coming of year. Food choices were plenty with good variations at each station. Service staff at these stations were patient, polite and executed their stations profesionally. Foods were topped up quickly too. Service and wait staff at the lobby were also a gem and executed their duties professionally. Requests were met with pleasant nods and smiles and attended to quickly. Thank You, very much, Crossroads Cafe, for a amazing dining experience and thoughtful gesture of surprising my mum with a birthday cake."
Options/Variety Shrunk,"It has been 2 years since my mum and myself last visited and we missed it dearly! It is our go-to for our yearly birthdays as the ambience and service - always memorable. Unfortunately, this time around we were greatly disappointed with the food offerings. There were many missing items from the supposed menu. While we understand some might be subjected to availability, this seem to have been a non-transparent marketing effort.

Missing items : Sashimi salad, Ajizuke Tamago Zaru Soba, French Bayonne Ham, smoked duck breast, Raclette, Braised Pork Trotter, Sour Plum Duck, Sweet and Sour Fish, Thai Style Steam Seabass, Braised Beef Cheek, Beef Goulash, Sausage Stuffed Squid in Adobo Sauce, Grilled Fish Citron in Garlic Butter Cream Sauce, Ravioli pasta station, Moroccan Spiced Lamb Shoulder, Rolled Pork Saddle, no chocolate fudge cake and none of the tarts.

This day was to be special for my mom's birthday - but the selection left us underwhelmed. Service wise was great, kudos to server Christine for going the mile ! I really hope to see more transparency and honesty with the menu offerings."
Lunch on 29 Sep 2022,"The service was good, however my Wayu beef burger was too well done & had a burned taste. I was looking forward for it as it was listed in the menu as ‚Äúbest seller‚Äù."
"Cheerful, excellent service rendered @the Marriot F&B","Below ladies were so cheerful in serving us - though they were wearing mask, we could ‚Äúsee‚Äù that they were happy in rendering their service to us through their
gentle mannerism and happy tone of speech. They really made our
buffet lunch at the Marriott Cafe on Sunday 28 Aug a delightful one. Please convey our appreciation to them once again. Thank you! (Lily, your very happy patron)

Service is excellent with Vic,"I always like to come here for dining as food is yummy, ambience is good and service is good. But this time I find that the food standard has dropped. Food is not as nice as before. But one thing good is ambience and service still maintain well. Without fail, Vic is providing his excellent service as usual and it‚Äôs her service that will make me come back again."
Significant drop in quality and service,One of our favorite restaurant previously. Not sure what happen but spread was much lesser and quality of food was terrible. Many food like fishes were overcooked and hard. Nuts were stale and not crunchy. Lunch buffet was supposedly 12pm-2.30pm but we were chased off at 1.50pm telling us that they were closing soon. Very disappointed and will never return.
My Top Pick For Buffet In Singapore,"I recently visited Singapore and decided to try out a number of the 5 star hotels buffet lunches during my stay. My top pick was the Marriott Hotel at Tangs Plaza which is a very convenient location in the centre of the orchard Road area. The seating was good and comfortable, the price was consistent with other hotels, the selection of food was excellent and probably what pleased me the most was the high quality of the food offered and the way it was cooked and presented. The food was all cooked to perfection and obviously high quality ingredients and clearly labelled. This buffet had also taken different cultures and nationalities into account and also catered to vegetarians/vegans by having a plant based selection of food. The bread selection was good and the breads very fresh. There was a selection of fruit and cheeses along with good dessert choices with the most delicious cr√®me brul√© I have ever eaten. The service was also very good with dishes cleared off tables almost immediately. I also really liked that water and coffee/tea were included in the price of the buffet. I also received excellent service from the chef at the roasts counter who ensured I was looked after for my request and was very helpful. It was nice to see Chefs who are happy to interact with the customers which is not always the case in Singapore. I am unable to find even the smallest fault with Marriott Tangs Plaza and I would highly recommend this buffet."
Great ambience and fantastic service,Love the services by the team. Enjoy every moment at my dinner. splendid food and definitely will visit again.
Mother‚Äôs Day + Birthday,Splendid meal/brunch! The service was wonderful. Thank you Vic. She was really excellent. I definitely would recommend a family outing/meal right here in Marriott Cafe :) cheers
Marriot High Tea,"We came here for the high tea on the Mother‚Äôs Day weekend and it didn‚Äôt disappoint! Theres a variety of durian theme pastries and the portion is big. There is a welcome drink upon seated. Beverages is unlimited so we get to chose both the coffee and TWG tea!
They have friendly kids menu too so getting food for the kid while enjoying our tea session isn‚Äôt a problem! The service staff is really attentive and friendly, Thanks Vic for the service! Cosy ambience and Overall price point was really good too. Recommended !"
Great high tea,"It's great if you have the entertainer promo, but even without, it's relatively reasonably priced for high tea. They have refillable hot TWG tea with an additional cold welcome tea. The dessert selection was also nice - I really enjoyed the pomelo mousse cake. The savory selection adds a good balance, though I wish they had more savory choices. I really liked the truffle scrambled eggs on toast. The only thing is I think the options are not exactly the same as the menu on their website. Nevertheless, I liked all the choices."
Lunch at Marriot Hotel - Excellent service from Vic,I enjoyed my dining here in Marriot cafe. Nice environment nice food and most important service is excellent from Vic. She is just marvelous. Enjoy my dining here with her excellent service.

"Food, Ambience & Service","I have always enjoyed dining at Marriott cafe as their staff Mogan, provides fantastic service each time I visit with my friend, n even remembers us. He also ensures that our special request for my food order is being taken care of. We would highly recommend coming here to relax & enjoy dinner or just relax with a few drinks as the ambience is excellent too."
Staycation,Great staffs that provided very friendly and prompt services. Always there to offer helps. Surprisingly good local dishes for breakfast like Laksa and Nasi Lemak. My wife's favourite. Thank you to Miss Vic who is very cheerful in serving us.
High Tea,Wonderful service. Especially Vic in being professional. Pleasant environment. Food is delicious and the Tea from TWG is excellent.
Passable breakfast experience,"no reservation is needed for breakfast but they do have a prominent signage indicating potential traffic at certain timings. Only a few tables was occupied on a weekday morning 7:45am and my orders were quickly taken. The Chilli Crab Omelette was quite tasty, alongside okay-ish bacon. Smoked salmon was good too, but the mesclun salad was bad so please avoid. Coffee could be stronger as well. On Day 2, the chef forgot the cheese in my ham & cheese omelette. While taking pics of the space, I was also advised that the management doesn‚Äôt allow photos to be taken, especially of the layout"
Amazing,"The Ni√ßoise salad with grilled tuna was wonderful! Very generous serving of tuna (thick slices!!!) which was perfectly cooked. The greens were very fresh and I particularly loved the potatoes. Slightly salty though (could have been due to the salt seasoning on the fish or the olives).

The iced soy latte was slightly diluted and I could tell they used Nutrisoy, which is not a bad thing but a slightly odd choice for coffee.

The aglio olio was good! Shrimp was super fresh and substantial. Slightly spicy for my mother so if you can‚Äôt take spice, do request for less spicy!

The service was really good as well! All the staff were super patient and helpful in answering our questions. Would definitely come back for the ambiance and high quality food. :)"
Excellent food and experience for wedding anniversary,"My husband and I had a wonderful celebration of our wedding anniversary at Marriott Tangs Cafe this afternoon. The food was great. I particularly like the ribeye steak with red wine sauce.
I would like to compliment Mr. Darren Chen of the cafe on his professional service rendered at the restaurant. He patiently introduced to us the different choices in the menu, and also very helpful, attentive to our request and always served with smile. We are thankful for his consideration and making the extra effort to make us comfortable. It was truly a wonderful dining experience. Thank you, Marriott Tangs Cafe!!!"
Awesome service by the team!,Food (breakfast) was great even if menu might seem limited choices. Vic is probably one of the most sincere staff among all with her smile and service. Will be back!
Excellent service and food,Service is excellent and breakfast is hot and delicious. Vic was super attentive for the 2 days we were there and provided us with great services. Breakfast items were served hot and yummy.
Lisa,We had dinner and breakfast at Marriot Cafe. The staff are friendly. They have wide variety of food. Wonderful experience! :)
Hi-tea to the highest,"Went here with friends for some catch-up. Had a great time and I enjoyed the high-tea. Also, good service with our friendly host Vic üòçüòçüòç"
Marriott lunch,"We have ordered satay, ribeye and pasta its delicious. Ms Vic had gave us very good Service we are very satisfied. Thank you very much."
Excellent Service,Thanks to Mogan for the excellent service!!! Was able to accommodate all our requests and very friendly
Enjoyable High Tea,Enjoyed our high tea with friends at Marriott Cafe. Shoutout to Mogan who took care of all our needs very well! üòä
Nice high tea with great service,"Was a little nervous with the bad review about the afternoon tea on google but it turned out to be very delightful. Our server Vic was friendly, attentive and helpful. They also provides various drinks. We started with the welcome cold drinks, along with a TWG tea and followed by a coffee, all free refills. You can try out different TWG during the high tea as well."
Lunch at Marriott Cafe,"Excellent service! Cosy atmosphere, good quality and delicious food. High standard hygiene!The waiters and waitresses are very helpful and will update you the best offer available."
Fantastic service and ambience at lobby cafe,Just finished lunch at the lobby caf√©. It was a soothing atmosphere and service rendered by VIC was top notch. All smiles and attentive to all diners in the floor. With her was another guy who rushed over to offer drinks once we sat down. It was such a lovely way to spend lunch there. I strongly recommend to all and will definitely be back. Thank you Vic and guys! Appreciate your service with finesse!
Marriott Cafe Breakfast,Been here for a month and the food and breakfast is great. All service staff are nice. I wii stay here again. Thank you especially Vic for giving me always a warm welcome.
Pleasant afternoon tea experience,"Had English afternoon tea at the lobby lounge. The good - the maitre d (?) or the manager promptly escorted us to our table and was polite to us. One of the waiters, Mogan promptly brought us the menu for tea selection, and was attentive to our table, he did not intrude on our meal as some waiters tend to do usually. The selection of savory/sweet was decent - I especially enjoyed the lemon meringue tartlets, croissants and beignets. However, the selection can have a better balance of savory and sweet. There were way too many sweet items as compared to savory so it was a bit difficult/cloying to eat at times. Other than that, the main staff at the entrance of the lobby lounge can be a bit more pleasant/attentive, instead of making the patrons wait in the middle of the restaurant while they sort out the reservation. They also looked like they didn‚Äôt want to be bothered with us. Long story short - get patrons to their table as soon as possible instead of making them stand awkwardly near the cashier. I think that was the only blight - overall we had a good experience! :)"
Valentines Dinner,"Great ambience, service and food! Excellent service from Mogan! The experience was good and everything went smoothly"
Crossroads Restaurant,"Good ambience, great service, good menu choices and reasonably priced. Outdoor sitting and free flow drinks options üëç"
Always a delight to return,"Always a delight to return to stay at the Marriott Tang Plaza. The highlight is always the breakfast at the Marriott Cafe. Even during the post-pandemic area where buffets are non-existent, the breakfast still has a very wide selection to please everyone. And most importantly is the staff, especially Vic, who is among the friendliest individuals you‚Äôll ever meet. With her ever-ready smile, she will surely brighten up your day every morning."
Breakfast at Marriott Cafe,Food is great and all the staff in the cafe are very friendly! Would definitely like to come back again =)
Marriott,All staff are amazing here.. I had a great time eating breakfast in here..and the food was great and also mention the cleanliness of the restaurant. Waitress Ms.Vic likely flight attendant was so adorable and full of personality. She is deligent and entertaining. Beside of the great food amazing staff like her is a great asset to the restaurant that deserve something great.. I really hope to stay here again someday..
Breakfast Service at Marriott Hotel Cafe Tan Plaza Singapore,"Awesome service from Jasmine, she pays attention to details of ordering and delivering service. Puts customer and hotel guests first and goes above and beyond when serving customer to the fullest with everything they need to make dinning easy. Food was fantastic and I can‚Äôt wait for my next business trip back to Marriott Singapore Hotel Tan Plaza.

A+ Service from Jasmine!"

Excellent Service and great dinning experience,"The Marriott Cafe is an excellent dinning place for breakfast. They have wide selection of choices and the coffee is great. The service is awesome, compliments to Vic, Maria, Makend, Rachel and Hemma."
Marriott Cafe Breakfast,The food was served in small portion but was all delicious. I received courteous and prompt service from Vic on my first day. She was the one who greeted me. Over all experience was great. Thumbs up for the great service.
"Excellent service, average food","Ordered the local delights (char hor fun and Hokkien mee), which were both very very average unfortunately :(( The risotto & wagyu burger was not bad. And the mango lime cake was very yummy!! Not too jelat, it felt a bit like mango pudding on sponge cake hehe. Service by Darren was realllly excellent! He was very understanding, and also very attentive to our needs! There was excellent customer service from him, all of us were really pleased! ‚ò∫Ô∏è He constantly came to refill our water, and was patient with us when we were ordering (:"
Delightful birthday dinner,"Lovely time at Marriott Cafe tonight for a birthday celebration! The food was great and we enjoyed our time here. Also had really good service by Laughing, who was very quick, friendly and made the overall experience an amazing one! Thank you!"
Lunch,"Not much selection on the menu but the food is good. A good place for lunch and dinner. Not serving buffet anymore, just ala carte."
Decent Marriott Cafe,"Nice ambience and friendly staff, however has pretty limited food options. Their Asian dishes are better than the Western options."
"Good food, great service",Went for high tea with friends. Great service and food is good. Kudos to Mogan for the wonderful service
High Tea at Lobby Bar,My family and I had such a good time at the Lobby Bar at Marriot Tangs!

Great hotel stay and nice restaurant,Love the buffet breakfast.great service by the staff name vic!the foods are delicious.we will definitely come back again soon.the last stay in oct also very awesome
Got turned away even though there were uncleared tables,"We were there to collect the marriot christmas log cake which was excellent as usual. Kudos to Marriot Tang on maintaining the standard.

We wanted to chill for an hour or so before collecting so we thought sitting at the lobby at Java+, will be excellent place to chill and people watch. Coincidentally there was an empty uncleared table at the lobby so my partner went to asked the lady wait staff. However it was curt reply that all the tables were full.

However after collecting our log cake, another customer had went up to the counter to order and then went to sit on the uncleared table and the lady wait staff went to clear it. Thereafter, I took the pic of drink being served to him. Really unprofessional service staff.

Since I didnt manage to try the food and drinks, everything else is rated fair."
Great food,"Location is accessible, great customer service, friendly staffs, Me and my friends had great time catching up under a very nice giant Christmas tree. All the food we ate tasted so good!"
Family friendly place,Excellent service by Vic in ensuring we had a comfortable time enjoying our high tea n getting the kids settled in :)
Same Great Service as Always,Thanks for keeping it up all in all! (Could have real crab meat instead of just the sauce in the Chilli Crab Omelet though!)
Crossroads cafe Marriott,"After 24 years of, visiting the crossroads cafe at Marriott. Service was very good and attentive staff. Caesar salad and Calamari could improve in terms of freshness for romaine lettuce."
High Tea by a Gorgeous Christmas Tree,Had the best high tea at the Marriott Cafe! Delightful finger food and the best drinks ever! Highly recommend the TWG choco mint truffle tea as well as the ala carte truffle fries. Thank you to Owen for the hospitality and Misti as well as the rest of the staff for the wonderful service. Would definitely return!
3 Tier high tea,"Good service, the scones & sandwiches are okay. The cakes are too sweet for my taste. I would really prefer the buffet but it is not available due to COVID.

I will not consider to return to this high tea again as the food is not up to my liking."
Staff,"Stayed at the Marriott hotel for a month, the food and accommodation were excellent. The staff were extremely helpful and a big shout out to Morgan... he went above and beyond..... a big thank you."
Staff,Stayed at the Marriott for a month. Staff where excellent alway helpful. One particular gentleman Morgan in the cafe was excellent. He always meet us when we arrived for dinner. Knew our general order and always had a beer for us. Morgan made the difference between a good experience and an excellent experience. Hats off to you Morgan.
"High tea is good, tea quality superb","Great choice of deserts and snacks for high tea, good service from staff as wel (vic, stephanie, ling). Tea by TWG is good as always"
Marriott hotel,Good service and very good initiative by service staff Glenn He tends to help us as we have kids under 5 years old and brought baby chair for us at the lounge
Decent breakfasts,"I stayed at the Marriott for 2 nights in Sep and breakfast was included at the Marriott Cafe. Quality of the breakfast was decent and the service was friendly and efficient. Also came here for evening snacks in lieu of the lounge being closed. Whilst the service remained very good, the food offered as part of the lounge equivalent deal wasn't quite as exciting - of course one can't complain too much when it's provided without additional cost. Overall it's very good and worth using whilst you're at the hotel."
Beautifully decorated for,Beautifully decorated for Christmas! The lobby lounge is so wonderful and we loved our afternoon time here! Excellent tea set with high quality teas and coffee (bottomless). Great customer services from Vic and Stephanie!!!!
Hi-tea,"Great service from Vic, Stephanie and Ling for afternoon tea! Thank you for the endless offers to help our family take pictures! ü§©"
Marriot cafe,V good service. Must single out Jasmine for exemplary service. Outstanding. It was an ala carte buffet breakfast n jasmine could remember all our orders n was prompt.
Hi-tea,We had hi tea at the lobby lounge in Marriott and were well attended to by Vic. It was a nice spread with champagne and reasonably priced too.
Disappointing. Very mediocre for a top rated Marriott.,"We had breakfast at Marriott cafe and was quite disappointed. Start with what is good? Well, the freshly brew coffee hit the spot but not much else. Juice was not freshly made. The dim sum is your supermarket frozen variety and was quite disappointing. The egg benedict's hollandaise sauce tasted like it came from a can. The fruit plate did not look appealing nor quality cuts. The pancake and waffle was cold. All in all, not a breakfast one would expect for this is iconic hotel."
Breakfast at Cafe,Well done! Good food and service. I enjoyed the variety. English muffins toasted perfectly. Vic is very helpful and friendly.
Food are tasty and staffs are friendly,"Food are tasty. Due to covid-19 health guidelines, they offer ala carte buffet. Staff are very helpful and friendly."
Less fancy would have been better.,"Less fancy would have been more wonderful. TWG s√©lection too flowery no plain black afternoon tea eg Assam. Sandwich made too early curling corners, open faced sandwich shouldn‚Äôt have been toasted as soggy. Sandwiches could have been more than one each of two flavours. Scones too small and oddly square. Cream Seemed to be non dairy, butter may be better. Jam was unconventional blackberry not strawberry. No need for mini mushroom quiche or mini doughnut or mini char siew bao, just give two regular sized plain scones and decent butter and jam. Cakes too fancy but not well executed: brandy chocolate lacked chocolate hit, passion fruit mousse cake had clearly defined creameaux lay Yee but not a strong passion fruit flavour as was too sweet; red velvet very pretty with ombr√© two tone butter cream rose but too much cream to cake ratio. One normal slice of any regular cake would be preferable. Could give guest a choice. Milk for tea should be cold not hot.
Not very expensive at $38 but better value for money and dare I say more margin if less fancy mini selections more sandwiches and regular sized scones and cake, and stronger tea."
"Friendly service, average food","Had dinner here with the family. Waited about 5 minutes to be attended to upon arrival, staff were engaged serving food or helping other guests take table photographs. Local favourites were ok (hokkien Mee, beef hor fun, chicken rice). The grilled chicken breast was healthy but dry. The standout was the brownie with vanilla iced cream. Warm friendly service"
High tea at marriot lobby,"Terrible quality of pastries. The sandwich is bad, the cupcakes taste worse than airline‚Äôs muffins, the scones are not fresh. Overall, what a terrible and disappointing high tea experience."
A good breakfast with wonderful staff,I enjoyed a good breakfast this morning with wonderful service provided by the staff who can recognise me from the previous stays. Everyone was friendly and very professional in ensuring a good experience. I would like to commend Vic for her professionalism in handling a difficult guest very well and politely. She is also very engaging in her communications with the guests.
Family High Tea,Great service from the staff especially Vic. We enjoyed the food. environment was nice to spend our weekend. Thank you
Bad food & very average service,"Had lunch at Marriott Cafe. The signature grilled chicken breast dish was dry and blend. The signature beef hor fun was ladened with MSG. Staff was not attentive. For that price, it was a big disappointment. Will not return again."
I expected more from a Marriott,"I went with my friends to celebrate our birthdays as they was a NTUC 30% discount birthday promotion. We order 2 starters, 2 mains, 2 desert and 2 glasses of wine to be share between 3 people. Even with the discount, he bill came to be about $50 per person. That wasn't really the issue.

The services was slow and inattentive. The soup we ordered came to us just slightly warm and so we politely had to ask the waiter to have it heated up again.

The Caesar Salad had too much Caesar sauce and made the salad mushy.

We also ordered an Impossible Burger as one of our mains and found it rather dry as there was no sauce of any sort in the burger.

Overall the food was rather blend. We really did expect more from a 5 star hotel restaurant and but was made rather disappointed after the meal."
Marriott Bonvoy member treated with extremely rude service,"Our family has been loyal members with the Marriott Bonvoy for years. Definitely not worth paying nor renewal of the annual membership with such horrendous service.

1st Incident dated August 2nd 2020 (Dinner).
Over the phone, we were informed by Ms.Sharon that the reservation to be seated at the Marriott cafe or lobby lounge will be served with the food menu from the Crossroad. We were ok with that arrangement. However, when David attended to us he rudely insisted that such an arrangement was not permitted despite what has been confirmed by his colleague. Tone spoken to us was unacceptably rude and unprofessional.

2nd incident dated Aug 9th 2020 (Lunch 1430hrs)
With the concern of having elderly members seated away from the crowd, I have requested for the corner sofa seats. David (again who has attended to us) rejected our request with reason that they will soon be having a carpet cleaning exercise. Shortly after, we noticed that he has allowed another family to occupy the same requested seats.
Adding to our already unhappy experience, David did not allow us to utilise the Marriott Member card for discount. Clearly, there were no mentioned of blackout dates for using the Marriott card and Wanhao resturant has allowed us to use it during our early lunch on the same date. To David's response, he said this was due to the need for Wanhao to entice more customers. Only when the Marriott dining reservation desk confirmed that the member discount can be honored on the date,David proceeded with the discounted bill at his own discounted rate of 15% (members were entitled to 30%).

Throughout all conversations with David, there was not a single professional f&b service and neither did we feel valued as a Marriott Bonvoy member."
Good Lunch Buffet,"Was here for a business meeting and got to say they do a very good buffet, comprehensive selection of various foods so even vegetarians or vegans can enjoy their meal here."
Lunch buffets,"Had lunch with friends during covid 19 period, all screening is done accordingly. Service is great, food variety is fair, taste ok"
"Super nice food, very friendly, highly efficient staff.","To be brutally honest, what got me was the lobsters. Buffet flow fresh lobsters with 4 different dip sauces is enough for me to come back again and again. However, that was not all that was good. Once I finished my 30th half-lobster, I went hunting for new treats.

The steak was nice (with at least 10 different sauces to try), the ham was nice, the fish was nice, the salad selection was very nice. I didn‚Äôt save any space for breads or pasta, but my wife (a self-styled pasta aficionado) said the arrabiata was nice. Towards the end, my wife also mentioned the Parma ham + rock melon for dessert, and we ended on a sweet + savoury note.

The service is just as good as the rest of them. Water always topped up, table always cleared (very important for seasoned buffet diners), and even fresh napkins were given in replacement of soiled ones (replaced 3 new napkins for us in total).

Very good overall experience, but I would come back just for the lobster alone, nothing else required."
One of the best buffets I've had!,"Loved the fresh lobster and baked oysters. Super fresh and tasty! Overall quality of food was great - steak, ham and pasta station. Service was excellent as well. We were greeted by warm smiles the moment we stepped in making us feel very welcomed and at home. What impressed me most was when I requested for more flat crackers for cheese which the buffet table had run out of - a chef told me he'll pop into the kitchen to check if they had any more. After 5 mins he didn't appear so I went back to my seat. To my surprise after 10 mins he delivered a plate of crackers to my seat apologizing for the delay as he had to go to a kitchen on another floor to get it for me. I was so pleasantly surprised! Really made my day.. Thank you and we will definitely be back! :)"
A++ for Buffet!!,"A considerably wide variety of buffet offerings using good quality ingredients. Spacious seating arrangement due to the COVID-19 situation, which are enjoying very much. Staff are extremely prompt in clearing our plates, but our highest commendation to the lady who handled our bill. Kudos to her for her infectiously cheerful spirit and friendly disposition!"
Delicious and wonderful!,"Had a great lunch buffet on 28th March with a friend. The staff are all very helpful and absolutely a joy! Service is top-notch. Food is also great, the baked salmon is wonderful, and the prawns are fresh. We got a carbonara at the pasta station, and that was delicious too. Overall, a great experience, and we hope to return some time soon. :)"
Lunch out with friends,Great dining experience! üòä Vic and the rest of the team was very friendly and accommodating. Food taste great as well!
Lunch with friends,Excellent service by staff Vic. Love the food selection. Ambiance very nice. Desserts were good.....
Lunch Buffet,"Service - 5* - good service for all the staff especially Ms Vic who always attended our needs and a very cheerful staff.
Food - 5* - the food was awesome, we really liked the salmon and the sushi was fresh. Dessert was great as well, chocolate panacota specially."
Very friendly and great food,We went to Marriott Cafe on 18 March to celebrate birthday. Food spreads were superb. They cooked in small portions so foods were freshly cooked all time. The best I like was cheeses section. Love it! And the most impressive was staff Ms Vio. She was friendly and thoughtful. We felt great for her attentive and friendly service. We surely want to come back here again soon.
Marriot Cafe,Excellent breakfast buffet at Marriot Cafe. We love their breakfast buffet especially the Big Breakfast choices like their freshly baked croissants and pastries. We were especially impressed with their Indian curries and roti prata which are as good as high tier Indian restaurants. We can't help but have a second helping. Fruit juices were freshly squeezed. Salad bar is simply generous. And not forgetting my evenly cooked oat which tastes just like homemade ones. Vic served as during breakfast and she is very attentive. Overall experience is wonderful. We definitely recommend this. Cheers!
Breakfast buffet,"Marriott cafe is well located in city center, good access from MRT and buses.

There is a good variety of food and staff are attentive and helpful (Ms Vic).

Thank you for the good start of the day!"
