Really nice and elegant place for CNY,"To be honest I’m a bit surprised by the bad reviews of this restaurant recently…. Our family decided to come to Po for CNY Gathering. I’ve been here few years ago and I absolutely loved POPIAH! I was worried that their quality might not be as good now but I was really pleased that it tastes even better than i remember!
The restaurant ambiance is elegant and staff are attentive. If you wish to eat out with family in a relatively less crowded environment, Po will be a great choice."
A big disappointment,"Restaurant is nice enough, staff friendly . Our entrees were very nice. We all had beef cheek rendang for mains, meat was chewy,tough and not nice texture. I could not eat mine. Told waiter who relayed it to chef, who said he could cut it with a spoon, in other words he didn’t believe us. Such a shame,as we were looking forward to Po so much."
Disappointed,"The ambiance was lovely. I know we are living in a digital world but we did not not like that we had to get the menu from the bar code and read off our phones in an up market restaurant. If they had hard copy menus, we were not offered them.
We shared two entrees which were very nice, particularly the beef satay, so tender and tasty. We all went the beef cheek rendang, was tasty but very tough. We had to request a knife and fork as you could not eat it with chopsticks or break it up with a spoon, was also very gristly and we could not finish the dish as it was unpleasant. We mentioned this to the wait staff who let the chef know. Seems the chef had no problem getting through the beef with a spoon!"
$30 for 4 glasses of water !,"Been to this restaurant 3 times in the past 3 years. On the pricey side ($48 for 4 popiahs) but in Singapore it is to be expected and the ambience and service is always pleasant. Plus I always try to support underdog establishments which aren't doing super well, I feel they are a bit overlooked in the scene and it is a lovely environment. However, yesterday when I went for lunch and when I left, I realised we had paid $30 for 4 glasses of water. They charge $7 per person for sparkling water and $5 for still. When I contacted them by email to verify, their staff rang back. I couldn't speak at that time but assumed there will be some kind of apology but when I rang back today, all they said was that yes the water is free flow so hence $30 after tax. We don't mind paying for water, but $30 for 4 glasses is ridiculous especially since we didn't get any refills. For that price, one usually would get 3 bottles of 75cl Aqua Panna or San Pelligrino in most places (I have noticed prices range from $8-12 in most restaurants). If you want to charge for free flow, please make it easy for us to get refills ourselves at a station or have the servers top up our glasses regularly. My French guests were aghast when I told them, 20 euros for 4 glasses of water for 4 pax is unheard of in Europe."
A really great lunch.,"Contrary to the last 2 reviews, we had a really good experience with the food, the wine and the service. We were greeted by the head waiter who welcomed us and explained about the popiah- it’s also on an instruction card on the plate. A popiah is basically a spring roll that you make yourselves given the ingredients which was a fun thing to do and it was surprisingly filling. Luckily, one of our party was used to Malaysian food and suggested some staters and mains including the star of the show - the paper cooked chicken.
We started with a bottle of champagne followed by several bottles of the NZ sav. blanc which was sensational ( it scored 4.4 on Vivino) .
We retired to the hotel lobby for a further couple of bottles of it ,finishing off a most agreeable lunch."
Disappointing,"The Warehouse Hotel was extremely dark inside the reception area. The restaurant is immediately to the right as you enter the building. We were served very shortly after placing our orders. Overall the food quality was very disappointing and way below our expectations. The Kurabuta Char Siew was acceptably tasty, the soft shell prawn was average good. The ngoh Hiong was unusually served in very thin squares. The Laksa was thin and disappointing in taste, while the
carabinero prawn and konbu mee was overly salty, with no wok hei, soggy, served with 2 large river prawns. We found the mahjong tofu very bland and tasteless, and the green bean salad was neither here nor there… very flat."
Disappointed,"Very disappointed. Read the reviews and was looking forward to it. Food came out 45mins after ordering and 30mins after my partner. My chicken was all bone and hardly any meat. Flavours were good but left feeling hungry!
So disappointed- there are many great restaurants in Singapore but this is not one of them. Don’t bother with it!"
Had a pleasant time,Staff were welcoming and the food was great. Their Popiah is a must try. Would go there again in the future
Unavailable main dishes,Only complaint is that key mains (spring chicken and rendang) were unavailable that evening which was disappointing
Disappointing lunch at Po,Very disappointing at Po. Wanted to try the special CNY lunch set but was told they were not offering that day only when we arrived. And our main course carabinero prawn took a long time to serve. We were waiting for so long.
5-star all round,"Was slightly hesitant when we booked this place as I heard about their 'high end' popiah. However, once you ordered the other dishes (eg. sea bass, hokkien mee), you will realized the overall dining experience and service will make it all worthwhile. The restaurant is not very big in terms of space but you get very personal service. Kudos to their F&B manager Syarif who recommended the dishes to us."
Excellent take on Singaporean cuisine!!,"The food was excellent and well executed. Every dish was fabulous but the star dishes were popiah, wing bean salad and the sea bass. Service was also outstanding. And their desserts were divine esp ice cream popiah!
Gavin was attentive, polite and he knows his stuff! Definitely an asset to Po!
Great overall experience"
Amazing Experience at Po,"It was my first time dining at Po. It was definitely an amazing experience. The food was good, service was top notch and ambience was great! Will definitely bring more friends and family back again."
Local staple food up a notch,"I had a staycation at The Warehouse Hotel and decided to have dinner at Po. I’ve never regretted the decision made. I had popiah and satay and both choices never failed to amaze me, especially satay. The meat on the satay was tender and juicy and the sauce was to die for.

One important note - the professionalism, attentiveness and friendliness the service staffs there made the dining experience even more enjoyable and memorable. A special mention to Gavin who gave good recommendations and went to the extra miles to ensure that we didn’t go hungry while waiting for our satay to be served. Well done!"
Great aesthetics and amazing service,"Sal and team were extremely attentive and very accommodating. We stayed in the River View room which was susceptible to some noise from the quay, but wasn't bothersome in any way. The breakfast food and service were both amazing. We also really enjoyed their fresh take on local specialties with dinner at Pó."
Excellent food & 5 stars service,"The food was great, and the restaurant manager Ms Corinne has superb & 5 stars service. Highly recommended"
"Excellent service, delicious food","Ordered the wagyu rendang and the kombu prawn noodles, both of which were excellent. Service at the restaurant is extremely attentive and the ambience is pleasant."
"Good food, better service",Signature Popiahs great but skins thicker than traditional handmade ones. These have the thickness of crepes. The sweet sauce lighter and excellent. Nice change to be service by expat CORRINE who knew her stuff around local hawker cuisine.
Amazing as always,"One of my favorite restaurants and the no.1 go-to place to take guests who are in Singapore for the first time. This time, the waiter Chris who told us he was doing his internship there, was very friendly and helped my friend who visited for the first time understand more about the cuisine and right ways to have a popiah!"
Food,"The prawn noodle was too salty. Otherwise, overall love the atmosphere and the service. The captain and the waiter were very attentive and we enjoy the night there. The recommended wine was excellent."
Great Service and Food,"Heard so much about this restaurant and their legendary popiah and finally manage to reserve a place to enjoy the food,
What bowled me over was the service which I must say is friendly, the staff genuinely tried to engage you and make good recommendations. They are not pushy for you to order more food.
I ordered :
XO Carrot Cake
Popiah
Paper Wrapped spring chicken"
Excellent Service & Nice Po.... Pian,Celebrate wife birthday at Po restaurant during staycation at The Warehouse Hotel. Must try their signature popian. Must really praise the service provided by restaurant manager Shariff for the excellent service.
Excellent service and very nice meal,The konbu prawn mee is really tasty and reminded me like a hokkien mee but with better ingredients.the pork char siew and satay also excellent. Really happy with the dishes and excellent service of the restaurant.
Excellent customer service,Staff were friendly and engaging. Atmosphere of restaurant was great. Surrounding of hotel was well-tidied.
Martin,"Delicious food, especially the popiah and grill chicken with good service and ambient
Price of Popiah is somehow a bit on the high side"
"3x there, never disappoints","Everything we ordered was SUPER DELICIOUS and satisfying.
Love their popiah. The experience making it + eating it is soo good. The small condiments & fillings make the popiah perfect. We also love the popiah ice cream. The pineapple ice cream is so refreshing, peanut butter too. The nougat makes it damn good. We always ordered popiah & popiah ice cream. The konbu mee with prawn is also very nice. Definitely my favourite peranakan restaurant. The ambience, interior is perfect too. I love this place."
Dining at PO,My friend and I both had an awesome experience enjoying our cocktails at hotel lobby to dining at PO. I visited before once and the lobby manager and staff remembered my name and took care of me to ensure I had a wonderful time!
"Wonderful setting, great food ..","Dining experience was very good .. arrival to Warehouse Hotel was smooth (given that temperature is taken, vaccination status confirmed, TraceTogether check-in) with all these COVID formalities.

Cocktail at the lobby bar was very good - great service, great drinks.

Dining at PO was very good - menu is great, food taste was very good. Service lacked a little - given that there were just 13 pax in the restaurant. If you called the waiter over and asked for something, it was delivered - there was no proactive interaction with us to; explain the menu, offer (sell) a second glass of wine, offer the QR code for dessert - if you asked for these they were delivered. As such, given the decor, menu and pricing - the overall experience fell short."
Enjoyed our lunch thoroughly !,"We had lunch at PO this week and it was a superb experience ! The popia and satay were so delicious ! Pricy yes but worth it as the ingredients were quality and the taste just not what you get at the hawker center or what i do at home. The restaurant was also so cosy and a lovely ambience, very nicely done up from what used to a warehouse in the past. We will certainly be back to try other food on their menu plus a repeat of the popia and satay ! Keep it up PO restaurant !"
Great ambience,"Service was great, so was the interior. Portion was generous and loved the rendang! Would definitely return."
"Average food, dim light ambience",Service is great and the place was nice. Food is ok but definitely not worth the price as it was quite expensive. Restaurant could have some background music as it was really quiet and lighting was very dim.
Pleasant dining experience,Satff were extremely friendly and professional. Food portion was so generous and taste was satisfactory. Overall we had a good time!
Worth the trip,"A good restaurant to try local food with a twist. Decor is nice and food on point, especially the Ayam Panggang!"
Opportunities,"Food portions was described accurately. The dishes were visually appealing and tasty. The servers were polite, but utilitarian. Food and drinks were overpriced for quality, service and ambience provided. Either lower prices or ""up"" the experience."
Experience Quality Mod- Sin cuisine,Located in a lovely restored warehouse hotel. Nice functional ambience with a touch of local elements. The food quality was good but the interpretation of local/traditional Singapore food can be more adventurous and expressive. The hits were the refreshing green bean salad and the wagyu beef rendang with roti jala. The XO Crab Carrot cake should be describe more as an omelet. Not much 'kick' from the XO. Still a good place with a nice ambience to enjoy some quality 'hawker fare'
nice dinner,me and my friend really enjoy the dinner. food and service everything is good. just prawn noodles a bit saltly but it's okay. thank u !
The best popiah in town,"Their popiah is the best. It looks good, tastes good. They’re using high-quality ingredients. Love the experience making your own popiah :)
I also like their popiah ice cream. The pineapple and nougat sorbet is so refreshing. The candied peanuts/sugar adds to the texture. Extraordinary experience.
The restaurants is nice, small and not crowded. A perfect place if you want to enjoy delicious meals while enjoying the ambience."
Great dining experience,"I staycayed at the hotel during CNY for 2 nights and had all my meals at the restaurant. For breakfast mains, I tried their roti prata and congee, and for the other meals, I had the barramundi, paper spring chicken and mango sago for dessert. All were delicious. Pleasant ambience and great service from the wait staff too. Would love to return to try out the other items on their menu."
Yummy local delights,"Our family loves the popiah dish and will plan to come back again. We ordered XO carrot cake, mahjong tofu, ""hockkien prawn bee"" , ""Bak Kut Teh "" (which is the only disappointment).

We will come back to try the rest of the dishes.

One point to raise, the reservation via Chope is annoying as I received 4 SMS on confirmation from 5th Feb till 15th Feb."
Disappointed,Our first visit to Po was lovely - so we were expecting the same experience but were sadly disappointed. We arrived early and took a seat outside for a cocktail but it took 15 minutes for a drink to arrive - and then another 5 minutes for the next one! In the restaurant the Popiah was lovely - we should have ordered more! The Spring Chicken was nice - but for one not the 2 - 3 people advertised. The Baramundi must have been on a diet for the past year because there were more bones than meat. We eagerly anticipated the Beef Rendang - but were told 45 minutes after ordering that it was off the menu. We were compensated with a free plate of Kailang - which though nice didn't appear to be a good swap! So all in all with a bill approaching $400 for two of us it was a highly disappointing evening - made worse by the fact that our previous experience had been so good.
Wonderful place I could eat at all day (and did),"Well designed setting for various group sizes. Bathed in natural light during daytime, and soothing lighting during nighttime. More than just popiah, it's a full experience. Have one of their specially blended teas to accompany your meal, because you'll probably end up with too much food from wanting to have everything on the menu. Must-have: popiah (flower crab version recommended if you're up for it), duck pie tee, melt-in-your-mouth kurobuta pork, flavourful carrot cake. Konbu mee if you have the space for it. Desserts optional, better to finish with a cocktail. Thank you Alvin and team for the hospitality!"
GREAT EXPERIENCE AT PO,"Nice ambience, friendly staff, good food, but very limited parking lots. Loved the popiahs, kueh pie tee, kurobuta char siew, nasi kuning. Would highly recommend them along with the Ice Cream popiah with candy peanuts, super creative! Overall, loved the experience and would visit again."
Fun experience!,"Went here for brunch with a friend. This restaurant opens at 12. We ordered their famous Popiah, kurobuta pork and beehoon prawns. Popiah was wonderful, the other meals are just standard. Would definitely recommend and come again for the popiah experience."
Good ambience,"We enjoyed the ambience and design of the main lounge/bar.. as for the food, I personally felt average only.. nth attractive.."
Delicious asian cuisine with a nice ambience.,"The food is absolutely delicious and beautifully plated. The staff were very friendly and gave good recommendations. We had a enjoyable birthday dinner date. Priced slightly above average, for good quality food and service."
Great menu and dining experience,"Date of visit: 23rd Dec 2020, 7pm. My friend and I ordered popiah, prawns and konbu mee, mahjong tufu and nasi kuning. Everything was great except that the prawns from the konbu mee dish did not taste fresh. I also found the nasi kuning quite greasy though flavourful. Nevertheless, I loved the general vibe of the restaurant and the hotel and will coming back soon to try out the other items on the menu."
Small family get-together,"This will be my 3rd visit to Po in 2 months. This time round is with my sisters to try their seafood congee which I loved. Our highly anticipated lunch started off a bit disappointing as 1) a few of what we wanted to order were not available despite we booked the 2nd searing for lunch on a Sunday, 2) we were also told that one of the dish we ordered was not available after some time and was offered to change to another dish and 3) we waited for 1 hour for our ordered food to be served. The food however turned our lunch around as it was very good. And, the wait for the food (although not ideal) provided us with a really fun time trying to explain the long waiting time. I must say Po service staff was fantastic. They were friendly and patient. The restaurant also provided a good service recovery...way to go Po. It's a small gesture that goes a long way! I'll be back soon for the congee."
Good quality food and service,"Quality of food was fresh, great and service was good. Ambience romantic and calm. Had a good dining experience at the restaurant"
Martin,"Excellent food though a bit pricy on the dessert
Nice ambient and friendly attendant
Keep it up....."
Pleasant dining place,"Po restaurant providea great dining atmosphere for couples, family and friends gathering. Good services but limited menu availability when we are there. We ordered 3 dishes, for the price paid the food did not leave a wow factor. Even the cocktails was mediocre for what was paid."
Delicious elevated Singaporean food,"I took my friend for dinner here for her last night in Singapore before returning to her home country, and it was the perfect send-off. It was my first time at the Warehouse Hotel, and the building and lobby are absolutely gorgeous, and the atmosphere in Po is equally lovely. The service was excellent, we were warmly greeted and presented with some tasty achar pickles while we decided what to order from the very tempting menu.

And the food was fantastic! We shared the truffle and duck pie tee and the iberico pork satay as starters, and both were delicious. The pie tee shells were thin and crisp, and shattered on first bite, the duck was tender and the truffle flavour pronounced and not overwhelming. The iberico pork satay was perfectly grilled with a good charred flavour, and was incredibly tender, and the accompanying satay sauce was rich and just the right sweetness with the added pineapple. My friend enjoyed her carbinero prawn mee main course, while I had the wagyu beef short rib rendang with lace crepes. It was spectacular. Without a doubt the best rendang I've had, anywhere. I love beef short ribs to begin with, and these were cooked perfectly, tender and very moist but still with some bite, and the rendang sauce was rich and flavourful, with just the right amount of spice, and the accompanying lace crepes were the perfect side to scoop up the sauce. A truly divine dish. Desserts also did not disappoint; I of course ordered the banana fritters with coconut gelato and gula melaka, and was impressed with the generous portion, crispy exterior and the warm, custardy banana inside. With the gula melaka and gelato it was just the right sweetness level and the ideal way to end a delicious meal.

This is certainly a place worth visiting, and one I'll be returning to again!"
Authentic Food experience,"Great restaurant if you are looking for traditional and authentic flavours for local dishes. A good selection of flavourful and hearty meals. Just a shame, where most of the service crew were excellent for the exception of one, where he was a bit aloof and a tad rude on asking customers to leave where restaurant is closing for the afternoon and dealing with the bill; leaving a bad taste to the much enjoyed dishes for lunch itself."
The service is excellent and the food is special. Ambience was great too.ecial and delicious,The service is excellent and the food was special and delicious. I will definitely bring my friends there.
Excellent service.. Excellent food idea and taste..,The food in term of taste or ides are excellent. Service top notch. My girl was crying and the staff immediately get her a dog balloon to stop her crying.
Always the best meal ever!,Never disappoints! Food is always well-made and super yummy. A good place to bring family and friends for that one-of-a-kind experience!
Get Together Meal,Food was fantastic. Service was great. Our party of 3 enjoyed ourselves very much. A big thank yo to Chef Ken who made our dinner such an enjoyable experience. Oh! The restaurant is also very well decorated.
Good food but mediocre service,"Food is excellent! The appetiser Achar already set a pretty high standard. Starters and mains are lovely. Particularly the satay, char siew and carabinero prawn mee. Cocktails are unique too and desserts ended the meal with a good note. Service not the best. The host at the front door told us to wait for 5mins for our table to be ready but gave no updates after 5mins. We waited and waited until another hostess asked if we needed help and brought us to our table when it is already ready. When we were ready to order, we signalled to the waiter who saw and walked towards us but suddenly took a turn when the table of caucasians next to us signalled to him. The whole dining experience would have been perfect if better service is being rendered for the $400 we paid for 3pax."
Delicious paper wrap chicken!,"The restaurant ambiance is nice and understated luxury. More importantly, it’s their food that is the star of the show. A must try is their paper wrapped chicken. Very delicious!"
Atas hawker fare,"Ordered the Charcoal Grilled Iberico Pork Satay ($21), XO Crab Carrot Cake ($22) and the Cabinero Prawns & Konbu (essentially $34 hokkein mee). The last dish was good but all of the food items just felt like elevated, overpriced hawker food. There were only 3 satay sticks per serving - how to even share? The carrot cake was generous with crab meat but expectedly so for the price.. I guess you pay for the ambience and the service. But I’d rather just go to the hawker centre"
Carrot Cake,Too much egg and cannot eat the carrot cake at all. Should improve on it and I feel to thick. Thinner would be better.
"Delicious, modern twist on Singaporean food","I've stayed for multiple months in the hotel, and have tried EVERY SINGLE DISH on the menu, and I can tell you: you are not making anything wrong with any of them.

My favorite was the wagyu beef. It melts on your tongue, and the ""crepes"" that it comes with, have an amazing texture and consistency. Loved it.

The Po is also the go-to choice for any shared meal. Great value for money.

The restaurant itself is modern and not very big. Hence, it doesn't get too loud, nor do you feel like you are in a commercial place. Very nice atmosphere and super friendly staff!"
7.30pm,One of the places that I love to come back every time. The signature popiah and prawn noodle is a must have at this place!
"Sumptuous food, amazing service","The food is excellent and well worth it, and this is coming from a local who would typically not want to pay hotel prices for local food. The service is even better than the food and the staff made us feel very welcome and comfortable throughout the meal. Thoughtful service and they were very accommodating even when my kids started running around and making noise. My younger daughter even received a balloon for “eating well”, and she was so pleased. My compliments to the chef and all the staff!"
Good experience with the dishes,The food was good to recommend to others in terms of taste. The dishes I had in there were to my liking
Will come back for more,"The food was splendid and the atmosphere too. Beef Rendang, Popiah, highly recommended. Chateau de Berne Rosé was a surprising find, a great accompaniment to the well crafted dishes. Thank you to the whole team, namely Sefalyn and Edvinna led by Tarun. True art of hospitality, keep it up!!"
Excellent Signature Dishes,"The ambience of this restaurant put me at ease as I walked in. It was dim, inviting and had a calming effect. The staff was equally hospitable, engaging and warm.

The restaurant advertises itself as having a refined modern Singaporean concept and the dishes are decidedly local with a twist; with the menu available via a QR code. My dinner companion and I asked a team member for advice on the portion sizes and promptly received it.

Dinner started with the signature Popiah Platter. It offered a taste of yesteryear and is a most welcome starter, but be prepared to have a hand in making your own popiah. After all, that is half the fun. The popiah skin, filling and condiments came served in bamboo steamers and their presentation was impressive. The next dish was another specialty, the Paper Spring Chicken, a whole chicken stuffed with glutinous rice, and tasted honey-glazed.

In the end, we were too full for dessert, but judging from the excellent dining experience, this restaurant is definitely worth repeat visits."
Nice spot for drinks and dinner - popiahs decent too,"Went here for dinner with friends.

The Warehouse hotel itself feels like it could drop in to New York or London (in the trendier neighbourhoods) and is a nice venue to while away some time.

Drinks / cocktails were well put together and we enjoyed a drink before walking through to the dining room. Wine list was solid, with some good reds in the mix.

The popiahs were a novelty but very tasty, even coming with some instructions to help out first timers.

We tried the chicken, the prawns and a selection of starters that included the satay. All hit the spot and nothing disappointed.

Service was a bit hit and miss, so hence the 4 star review. But overall a good dinner, decent drinks and a place we would consider visiting again."
Exceptional Food & Service,We visited Po early this week for a birthday celebration. I absolutely loved the Barramundi Salad that we re-ordered it after finishing the mains. The restaurant team really took care of us and made celebration a success. It’s safe to say that you’ll always have a great time at Po.
One of my favorite Popiahs in town,"I like the popiah and ambiance here. Parking is limited but free if you can get it.
I like the popiah with everything and that the ""bangkuang"" / stir fried turnip is a bit less wet here. i also like the quality of condiments, the leaves for example. The service staff are good. friendly and attentive. this is nice to have a drink outside and have a cozy dinner with a close friend or girlfriend /wife etc."
Friendly and Attentive Service,"Staff were friendly and introduced each dish that was served. The ambience and mood of the venue was fitting, however should avoid having young kids at the venue at dinnertime. Otherwise everything was prefect!"
Fun and delicious!,Great ambience and the food was amazing. Staff were attentive and friendly. Would advise to visit as a group so you get to try more stuff on the menu as portions are quite big.
Great place for gathering!,"Great mod sin Cuisine! Famous popia and Hokkien mee! Good food, good drink and good friends! Cannot ask for more!! #modsin #popia #hokkienmee #goodfood #gooddrinks #goodfriends #foodie #sgfoodie #foodporn #sgfoodporn"
Very good restaurant,"Wonderful experience in this restaurant. Everithing was on the top.
The service was excellent (advice...)"
Lovely Birthday Dinner!,We enjoyed the wonderful service and excellent food. The restaurant serves local cuisine with a modern twist! The ambience was lovely too! Thank you for a nice time!
1st Date Night after Phase 1,It was a welcoming date night where I spent a resplendent evening with my wife. Great ambience and yummylicious food!!! Had the chicken and barramundi. You should try it when you are there.
I recommend,"Good value for money!
The food (especially the signatures) and the service was really good!
The atmosphere was nice as well!"
Great ambience and nice local food,The ambience is nice with excellent service. A great place to catch up with friends too. Hope to be back soon.
Average for first experience,"The restaurant setting was nice and cosy....however the food was a little disappointing. Nothing special in terms of taste of the food and you are essentially paying for overpriced local dishes you can easily find elsewhere in Singapore. Definitely would not be top of my list for returns. Service was average as well. The waiter had forgotten our drink orders and we had to ask about it mid way through the starters. Also, when we were halfway through dinner, while the waiter had come over to ask if everything was ok and if we wanted any other orders...we said no, and that the portion was enough, only to realised later that their kitchen was closing. Because we were not clear that the kitchen was closed, we had tried to order dessert, but was then told that everyone had gone home. Poor experience for our first visit and my guests wasn't impressed with the visit either. Would give it another chance if there was more variety on the menu"
Amazing lunch,We had an amazing lunch yesterday at this beautiful decorative restaurant in a nostalgia hotel. Will recommend to friends of overseas who visiting SG.
Really nice,Enjoyed our meal here especially the starters of the pies and the popiah. Would go back again just for these. Mains was a tail of barramundi and noodles. Not overpriced and a nice experience.
Great place to bring visitors,I took a friend that was visiting Singapore on a short stopover. I had never been there before and went after a friend highly recommended it to me. The food is amazing with a lot of peranakan choices and a great place to introduce someone to the unique food that we have here in Singapore in a fine dining setting.
Excellent CNY lunch,"A wonderful setting. Staff were lovely, and food wise everyone was impressed (if also stuffed). The team tried hard and were very attentive when around, however were not always present toward the end of the service. Perhaps one might consider to better cue the timing of food being served, taking into account how busy the restaurant is - so if you're pressed for time, better let the supervisor - and all the staff - know. We had what felt like extended gaps in serving time between yusheng and popiah, and popiah and kueh pie tee (we had the fortune of a staff trying to serve us pie tee twice, and although it was delicious we turned the second one away). That said, the food here pretty much always hits the spot and it's a place to come back to every time."
Lovely,"Loved the food here, great service by the waitress, we could have ordered way too much food but she put us on track"
Enjoyable Experience,"Po Restaurant has executed their CNY menu really well and the food was delicious. Their signature Popiah remains consistently good and I was also very pleased with the service that day.

The wait staff were professional, polite and attentive. One notable example was regularly filling up our cups with hot water, even without any prompting. That to me, deserves a special mention because I have been in various restaurants whereby, one literally has to stand up and get the attention of the wait staff, simply just for a glass of water. In Po, however, they see it as a norm, as part of their service delivery and customer experience.

Since their opening, I have been a regular because Po has been doing things right at so many different levels. I will have no qualms recommending the place to any of my friends or business associates."
Excellent Food with Service,We had our office CNY lunch at Po Restaurant. The food was fresh and well prepared. Definitely will come again.
Tad disappointing,"Decided to bring my family here for a nice dinner to celebrate CNY.

After we were seated, no one came to pass us any menu. We waited for a while but no one came to service us. After we requested for the menu, there was no apology given for forgetting to pass us the menu.

During dinner, a waitress knocked over my purse and it fell on a floor but she did not apologise at all.

After dinner, I requested for the bill but the waiter passed the bill to my dad instead of me. I wanted to pay for the dinner but my dad insisted to as he was given the bill. I was quite upset as it was meant to be a treat for my family.

Toilets were not very clean as well.

Nevertheless, we enjoyed the cocktails and ambience."
Good overall,Love the ambience and lighting. Food is good generally. Service is great. The kurobota pork is too dry but everything else is great..
"Very good food, great venue, good service",Very good traditional food. A good mix of Singapore/Malaysian/Chinese type dishes. Served by a friendly team who explained each dish well. Good sized serves so the value is OK. Great old hotel with plenty of old charm. Recommended
Food good service less so,"Food was good but service was very average. Also, it was too dark! Could barely see what we were eating?"
Exceptional Dining Experience,"Had a wonderful experience at Po. Love the ambience and setting of the restaurant and the quality of the dishes were exceptional. Servers were attentive and professional. Would highly recommend the Truffle & Duck Pie Tee and of course, their amazing signature Popiah.

Definitely a great place for both business and family dining experience."
Singapore Cuisine,"You know i have travelled overseas and have never seen a proper Singapore restaurant. Maybe at last there is a recipe for one. This place remakes Singapore's essentially street food into a package that could maybe emerge as a cuisine. Popiah is excellent, wagyu beef rendang the best and very good congee too. OK people who say this sort of food can be found in hawker centres state an obvious fact but kudos to the people here for trying. A bit expensive but well worth it, the best thing is after finishing the meal i am already planning my next trip."
An amazing restaurant,A very beautifully decorated restaurant. Fantastic food with friendly price tags. Holistic wine list. Great service staff like Mel. They also have a professional sommelier who is there to enhance your palate and dining experience.
YUMMY mod sin cuisine,"Ambience without a doubt was on point (love the tables) being housed in the posh Warehouse hotel. Popiah being the highlight of the restaurant is a must order (radish mixture very good, i like the shredded egg) and the nice experience to wrap your popiah. Seafood congee, paper wrapped chicken, duck truffle kuey pie tee so flavourful! Barramundi salad was refreshing. Pulut hitam dessert was good. I would return to try other dishes! Thank you for the lovely service too."
Delicious,"Service, amenities, personal and specially the food - that all was amazing and made one of our best memories of Singapore."
Worst experience ever!,"DON'T EAT HERE IT'S AMATEUR AND OVERPRICED AT BEST!!! You can eat the same level of Singapore Traditional food at a much better level and a quarter of the price just about anywhere...I don't mind paying for a culinary experience but this was a Terrible experience....The food was below average and the service absolutely terrible...not worth $35-50 a main..don't offer a 9pm reservation and then rush your guests. Our drinks on arrival took 35mins to arrive and our starters had almost all arrived by the time they came out so we had cocktails with dinner! We asked for the service to be slowed as everything was arriving at once however this was completely ignored and we were even given our bill whilst we had just started eating our food. It's fairly obvious the staff wanted to head home as soon as possible ...NOT WHEN YOU'VE PAID NEARLY $400 and have been made to eat your entire meal in less than an hour! It's a shame......THE NEXT REVIEW SAYS EXACTLY THE SAME AND THE RESPONSE IS THAT THIS WILL BE RELAYED TO THE MANAGEMENT AND TAKEN CARE OF...,OBVIOUSLY THIS IS JUST A PUBLICITY STUNT TO APPEASE THE LAST COMPLAINT ONLINE!"
Excellent Dining Experience,"This is my go-to place with friends and family. Traditional fare with a modern twist, these quality dishes show much care and attention to details. Always finish the meal thinking when will be the next time I come back again. The only draw back is that it can get a tad too noisy due to the low ceiling. The good thing tables are not that close to one another so there is still some form of privacy."
WOW what an experience,"We visited Po on our last night in Singapore as it was our Honeymoon and we wanted to dine somewhere special. We were not disappointed.
The food and service was excellent.
On arrival I opted for a Singapore Sling cocktail it was amazing! The staff were very helpful when explaining the menu and recommended the Popiah which was some of the best food I have ever tried. They even surprised us to a glass of champagne each.
Such a lovely way for us to end our honeymoon in Singapore."
Sing faves in a fancy setting,"This is a nice way to impress people from out of town with Singaporean hawker dishes made with the best ingredients. For example, imagine satay sticks made with the juiciest tender cubes of grilled meat and the best peanut sauce you’ll ever have? You’ll need to order sides to balance out your mains. I would have been happy eating our way through the selection of small plates and popiah. They were delicious. No view of the river but still a sophisticated dining room with attentive staff."
Service was disappointing,"Food was fabulous, both presentation and taste. Consistency in these mentioned areas is the reason why I keep bringing my overseas guests back to the place. However, service this round was slightly below expectations where promptness was lacking and some of the service staff seemed unapproachable when my guests requested for their assistance.This made my guests question the general service type for restaurants in Singapore which was quite embarrassing I must say."
Fine local food,"Looking for local delights such as po piah, satay and hokkien mee. Po kept the tradition in these dishes and really bring out the local flavour with quality ingredients and preparation. The service, as always, was delightful."
