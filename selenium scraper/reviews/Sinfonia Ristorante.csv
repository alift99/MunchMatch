Elegant quiet fine dining,"Elegant interior, warm welcoming attentive service and awesome food. I chanced upon this restaurant while googling for best Italian restaurant in Sg. A wonderful find. Starter was very special, the cold cheese and caramelised onion. Mushroom soup was pipping hot and truffle oil simply aromatic. Beef melts in your mouth while the octopus was prepared so uniquely, outer crust crispy while inside tender (must try for yourself to understand the uniqueness). Dessert was ok, maybe overshadowed by the others. Thanks to Andy and Rajoo for great service - attentive but not intrusive. And they change cutlery with each course so that flavours don’t mix, I love this little details. Highly recommended."
Omakase menu on the weekend is worth it!,"The weekend omakase was so worth it! Besides trying the items on the omakase menu, replenishing those we liked is one of the highlights! All the dishes including the desserts were well executed. The beef stew was exceptionally tasty. Great service from Raymond Foo!"
Absolutely to avoid,"The food was ok, over priced compared to the quantity provided. A bit of failed nouvelle cuisine surrounded by poor quality of ingredients.
What I found most annoying is the following statement in their website:

“Inspired by fresh and seasonal produce, Chef Simone Depalmas believes in giving new life to quality ingredients with creative culinary techniques. Even the simplest dish can taste sophisticated and refined with a touch of his magic”

The Chef left over two years ago and NO ONE inside the restaurant is Italian.

Lastly, let’s not pretend this is an Italian restaurant when the food has nothing to do with the country it pretends to represent

Given a 3 for the service as it would be a 2"
Lovely evening,"Attentive service, great food, with even a rotating magician to entertain you during the evening. Perfect for special events."
A pleasant surprise,"We booked dinner at the restaurant because it was beside the theater where we were watching a show. While we expected the ""usual"" fine dining experience, my wife and I were pleasantly surprised that we enjoyed the food more than we usually do - the duck (and my wife usually does not like duck), the seafood platter, the mushroom soup. We will surely be back."
Excellent!,The only drawback was that the food could have been serve a little faster. But the magician in between courses was a lovely touch!!
Food deserves praise for the Chef,"Enjoyed the delicious menu, however, there were only 3 tables of two pax each while we were dining there. Left at 7:45pm. A pity as it was theatre night. How about creating a shorter menu for concert/theatre goers?"
Birthday dinner with my wife,"very nice ambience, waiters are very nice and polite, Like the appertiser and starter very much. Beef cheek was soft and lovely."
Sinfonia Ristoriante,"It has been a while me and husband ate in Sinfonia but we were pleasantly surprised of the service level remain top notch and attentative. Food quality and presentation remain in Michelin Star level (even they have not been given one). This is a ""jewel"" not being discovered by many and it should be found out soon by foodies."
“It’s a fantastic place at a moderate price”,It’s really an incredible place with wonderful food and really pleasant staff! Chapeau to the sweet and oldest waiter who’s an absolute gentlemen and a fantastic host!
Food was really bad.,"Firstly, parking is an issue, the nearest parking would be at Parliament House.
Secondly, the food was really bad and disappointing, Staff were rigid and not versatile enough hence I guess that is how it would affect their business. If staff are good and accommodating, people would patronize the restaurant for the ambience and service despite the bad food.
However, their bread and desserts were really good, and that explains the 2 stars I have given."
Avoid at all cost,overall priced set course. food quality is only comparable to family restaurant. cannot find a single to touch of Italian.
Worth & nice ambience,"This was a birthday celebration. Price range was pretty fair and the most important thing is the food was awesome. Waiter and waitress were polite and friendly. Nice and pretty ambience. Surprisingly, chef prepared a mocha mousse as our dessert for the birthday boy. How thoughtful they were! Lastly, worth it and it’s a good place to spend your time and catch up with your loved ones!"
"It is good, but the price is not worth it","The place was completely empty the whole time we were there and it was a Friday night. We wondered why....The place is in a very nice classic building. You are offered a set menu with 4, 5, 6 or 7 dishes. I ordered 5, my wife 4 (both including dessert). They brought the dessert to my wife when I was still in my 4th dish. The quality of the food is good, but not for a 400 SGD price!"
Fancy dinner,"Sinfonia offers set menus for dinner. Options from 4 to 7 courses, prices changing accordingly. One choice of main for vegetarians. Food was good, service super attentive and A/C making you feel in the Alps, during winter. Discomfort enough to spoil the experience."
Excellent service with quality food in an enchanting ambiance,"The attention to customer need, proactively serving meals without needing to ask for during ala carte buffet definitely making you feel privileged. Food quality was good especially turkey roulade and blueberry cheese cake. Special shout out for the on duty manager who provided a complimentary drink for my daughter and a birthday cake. Will come back again when they have new menu."
Enjoyable Christmas Dinner,"Booked Sinfonia for Christmas dinner with my family and had a very enjoyable evening. The food was fantastic and the service was great ! The oyster was very fresh, Foie gars was delicious . I really like the seafood dish as the fish was really soft, tender and tasty plus the prawn was cooked to perfection."
Wonderful experience,"We visited this restaurant last month and it a great experience, we were seated at the centre of the restaurant and it was very comfortable. The interior and decor is very nice and has a very relaxing atmosphere. We opted for the 4 course menu and we weren’t disappointed, each dish was presented very well and the taste was great, in particular the aglio olio impressive, although the food and atmosphere was great the thing that I will remember the most is the service staff at the restaurant, each member of staff was polite, helpful, attentive but not suffocating and this made it a memorable experience, overall a really amazing restaurant and I cannot wait to return."
"Excellent Set Lunch, attentive staff","Thank you. Did a goodbye lunch w friends. Did the app, side and steak main.... all were delicious! Thank you"
"Bad food ,Bad service","I remember few months ago the quality of the food,the presentation is much much better,also the service from executive chef's was amazing...now not worth the visit..."
Food and service quality dropped,It was an average dining experience comparing with our previous visits. Both the food and service quality dropped. The waitress didn’t mention about the free flow. Not a good decision to remove the table cloth.
Friday lunch for 2 ladies,"Both of us had 4 course set with a variety of selection. Each course has good flavours and tasty, service is prompt and friendly. Spacious interiors with pleasing (greek) columns. In entirety, it was a filling and enjoyable meal."
A grandiose affair and true oeuvre,"Entrance into Sinfonia is a grandiose affair. The restaurant is breath-takingly beautiful with classical lines which makes sense as it’s housed in Singapore Symphony Orchestra. All resonating the right notes. It’s a classy and elegant affair here with ample space between tables (rare in Singapore). High ceilings and space means sound acoustics are good, affording good privacy. Service is top-notch – we had Raymond Foo, affectionately known as Uncle Foo who was impeccable in his service and even educated us on the glassware in the restaurant. Fil, the Manager, was very politely gracious and tended gently to our requests promptly, warmly and professionally. We did the $48 Bottega prosecco free-flow and the $58 free-flow omakase which was an absolute snag given the quality of food. It bordered on the safe side but made up in taste, quality and presentation. Tuna was perfectly seared with the right pink hues. Halibut was plump and tender. Dessert was elegantly plated - the perfect swan song to the finishing piece. The entire experience was faultless and an absolute oeuvre. It’s a true symphony of haute dining and taste."
"Excellent Food, good service and nice ambience","My family and i have been going back to Sinfonia Ristorante for a while now and our most recent trip on 21 Feb to celebrate my son's birthday was another treat. Being located on the ground floor of Victoria Theatre, the restaurant is both majestic and elegant and that makes it a popular choice for weddings and corporate functions. However, what really sets it apart is Chef Simone. He exuberates exceptional culinary skills and uses fresh ingredients to create incredibly sumptuous dishes. Unlike most chefs who are typically rigid with their menu, Chef Simone is always open to requests and suggestions. He is also one of the most friendly chef we have encountered. His dishes are beautifully presented and the portion is right enough for you wanting more. This is one restaurant where you leave thinking when you are going back again."
Tried Omakase lunch on Saturday.,Tried Omakase lunch on Saturday. Very worth it. Really appreciate the Chef and staff good services and good food! Thank you for having us.
"Quiet, perfect location for private business lunch","Searching for a private, exclusive business lunch location. The lunch course menu was perfect, good service, and we could have perfect business lunch without disturbance"
Excellent ambiance and personalized service,My family celebrated my husband's birthday over weekend lunch in Sinfonia and I couldn't find fault in this restaurant. Their omakase lunch was excellent - taste and budget that is. The portions were for tasting portions but you're welcome to take seconds based on their menu for the day. The service was excellent too. I'll be coming back to celebrate more occasions on this resto.
"Outstanding Food, Excellent Service","Omakase Weekend lunch is inventive, of excellent quality and very good value. Sinfonia maybe a little hidden; but well worth finding for possibly the best Italian and Sicilian food, sourced by one of the best Head Chef's in Singapore."
Great food and service,It's our second time to go for Omakase Sunday lunch. For $58++ the free flow of good food and good service are more than enough. I highly recommended it.
Bad service. Do not go!,"Accepted our reservation weeks ago. Yet when we called the day before the event, they drop the bomb and said they actually have a wedding that day and should not have taken our reservation. No apologies other than it's oversight and they don't know who accepted the reservation. Could not reply why nobody bothered to inform us. Had we not called, we would have been turned away at the door. What fine dining restaurant that can't even get the basic service right. Totally disappointed and disgusted with the nonchalant attitude and the service tone of the Filipino waitress who took our call. Avoid this restaurant at all cost."
BEST AUTHENTIC ITALIAN FOOD WITH EXCELLENT SERVICE,Had lunch and dinner here recently. All my guests and dates enjoyed the Italian food very much. Friendly executive chef was out to explain each dish thoroughly. Beautiful internal decors great for Instagram pictures. Friendly staffs with excellent service. Will definitely visit again.
Amazing dining experience,"I visited the Sinfonia restaurant with my family for the first time,we were impressed by the quality of the food and the service from the executive chef"
OUR OMAKASE LUNCH EXPERIENCE @ SINFONIA RISTORANTE,"My husband and I had lunch on Saturday 24 May at Sinfonia Ristorante.
The restuarant only serves the Omakase lunch special on the weekends. As we are in our early 60's we thoufgt this would be an ideal meal for us to try the fantastic italian food inspired by Executive Chef of the restuarant, Chef Simone Depalmas. We were certainly not disappointed as every dish we were served was excellently prepared and tasted fantastic. Whilst the food was excellent we found that the service was also fantastic too as we had Raymond, a very young at heart staff give us the best service we have ever experienced.
We left fully satisfied."
Nice Oasis with Very Good Food,"A stone’s throw from the busy business district and Merlion, it is an ideal venue for a relaxing lunch."
"Hearty, robust Italian in a somewhat misplaced setting.","It was a most logical idea to turn this large, beautiful space in the Victoria Concert Hall & Theatre into a dining restaurant. I just feel though that in place of a fine dining concept, a slightly less formal, chic restaurant/cafe would better serve the needs of concert goers, and the people who come in and out of a building of this nature (including tourists). Somewhere along the lines of DB Bistro and Osteria & Pizzeria Mozza (closed unfortunately) may work better. And perhaps this explains why the restaurant was empty when we dined there one Wednesday evening. We were the only table, save for another group of 5.

More importantly, I feel it is because the menu consists of only a 5-course or 7-course set dinner (lunch is 3 or 4 courses) without the flexibility of an a la carte menu. This concept is very limiting, and considering the performance halls it caters to, it must surely turn prospective diners away. Already, as a stand-alone restaurant, it is not positioned well for ease of getting to.

The food itself though is very well executed. Hailing from Sardinia, Chef Depalmas has a warm and friendly disposition and this shines through in his dishes - flavours are robust and portions on the hearty side. The truffle chicken liver brulee, a stroke of genius, is certainly the winner here. The lamb rack was full of flavour as well.

First up though, the menu was really puzzling to us - it lists a total of 6 courses - namely Starter, Soup, Primi, Secondi, Cheese & Dessert. Yet, one has to choose either a 5-course or 7-course meal. The waiter proceeded to explain that if one chooses the 7-course meal, you would have to select TWO Secondi (two main courses)!! I would have thought surely that choosing two starters makes more sense. We do however appreciate the restaurant's generosity.

Having chosen the 5-course and my husband the 7-course, we found ourselves quite full half way through, aided along the way again by really big portions even for the starters. We ended up staring at three main courses in front of us and making our way slowly around them!

I would like to suggest that offering a 7-course meal should also come with paring down on portions and offering lighter dishes. More importantly, to bring in customers, have an a la carte menu so that one does not have to sit through at least two hours for dinner. I am aware that there is a Pre-Theatre menu, but it is again either in 2 or 3 courses. While the selection for each course is adequate, it is not enough to draw us back any time soon. That said, Sinfonia is a very elegant and classy place to have a quiet and intimate meal."
Little Italy,"One of the best places in Singapore, let you feel like you are in Sardinia. The owner is so nice that there is nothing like that"
Great Italian food,Sifonia never fails to deliver. Ambience is fantastic and the service is excellent. Time and again it remains the same. Would highly recommend for those who want a great experience.
Good service,Good service and good foodGreat magician with great performance and very entertaining Will definitely visit again
Slightly underwhelming,"Had the free-flow omakase Christmas Day dinner, and I was looking forward to it. However, the experience was quite underwhelming. The live stations, which served beef, turkey, fish and pasta, were rather ordinary – not what one expects of omakase. Surprisingly, the appetizer and dessert spreads were actually better, and went some way to redeem the dinner experience. That said, kudos to the wait staff, who provided impeccable service and did whatever they could to make it a pleasant experience for patrons."
Best Italian ever,"Had lunch with family, and everyone enjoyed it so much. Creative and tasty food, beautifully done plating, friendly service, would give it full five stars!"
"Beautiful restaurant, nice food","1. Beautiful. Like a bigger, brighter, prettier Flutes. 2. Good portions of food that was tasty and quite unique 3. Good selection of wine 4. Classy experience for a ok price Service is professional & friendly. Would recommend."
Weekend brunch,"The weekend brunch is a superb value at SGD 52. The quality of the food is excellent, the service is very professional and the restaurant is elegant. Kudos to Chef Simone Depalmas and his team."
Absolute #1 favorite restaurant,"My partner and I are foodies to say the least and we have been living in Singapore 4+ years. When I first came here for dinner a while back I knew right away it was my favorite restaurant in Singapore. But then when I came back for the brunch I realized actually it is my favorite restaurant in the world.

I wish I was exaggerating when I say that chef Simone has made me actually shed tears on more than one occasion. I truly have never seen someone so passionate about food as chef Simone. His craft and meals are indisputably art, which I find to be unique and moving. I never have a visitor in Singapore who I don’t bring here, and if I get to chatting with anyone at all about food I insist they try the brunch.

I have visited many Michelin restaurants worldwide and I can say with full confidence that when it comes to quality, location, price, and service, no one beats Sinfonia.

I also had my engagement party in their bar last year and everyone in attendance still raves about the food."
Very interesting dishes and experience,"Came here for their 12-course Omakase Italian lunch which was also free flow after all 12 courses were served, meaning you can re-order certain dishes if you enjoyed it a lot. All of this was only for $52++, which is an amazing deal if you ask me. We thought we had enough stomach to order more after all 12 courses were done but we were SO FULL. The food had very interesting tastes but overall was good, and made up for the bland decor of the restaurant. The chef even came out to say hi and small chat with us which I thought was a nice touch. It would be good to have all of the dishes explained in detail as they come so the experience is more comprehensive. I found myself at times guessing what I was eating as I was not sure where a specific taste was coming from. Service was amazing though, would recommend the lunch!"
Lovely place with great service,"This is my second time back at Sinfonia. Thoroughly enjoyed myself because of the lovely staff and chef. The service was impeccable and the food was yummy. As much as i am glad that the staff was attentive, i wished they had more patrons so that they can continue to flourish."
our reservation have not been taken into booking,"we came to the restaurant and all staff were busy by setting up the tables for a big event. Nobody was waiting for us and nobody took any note of us coming in. So, it was very disappointing - we left the place and went to another place."
Nice higher end restaurant,"Well executed, decent and creative food. Beautiful space. Good place to take someone older like your mom or aunt to. Nothing much to critique on, not much notable to highlight either. Just good all around. I probably wouldn't go back if I had to pay."
Terrific experience!!,"Went for the weekend omakase lunch!! It was wonderful! The presentation of the food was top-notch, as was the execution of the flavours. I particularly like the blue cheese macaron as well as the frog tempura! It was clear that a lot of effort and thought had been put into each dish.

The service was also impeccable. The service staff were helpful, obliging and efficient. They also clearly knew the food well and were able to explain each dish. The best part is, you can order additional portions of the dishes you like at no additional charge, and the staff are more than willing to assist you.

At the price, the weekend omakase lunch is definitely an awesome bargain. I had a wonderful and thoroughly enjoyable experience and I highly recommend this place for a special occasion!!"
Dinner and talk : Private event,"The wife and I were at a private event that included a talk and dinner. The restaurant was specially open only for our group for that night. Pre-dinner drinks of wine, beer, soft drinks. Sit down dinner with each dish served by waiters negotiating the aisles whilst we ate and listened. The food was pre-ordered by the organiser. The starter was some kind of fusion food, which had pasta and potato mixed in with cheese- too adventurous for my taste. I had a main course of wagyu beef cheek - very tender and good sized chunk of meat that could be easily ripped off in layers, following the natural arrangement of the muscle groups of the animals cheek I suppose. The other highlight for me was the uniquely designed and surprisingly delightful dessert, which was made of gelatin, sugar, some fruit puree all combined into a most delicious sinful morsel."
Great Sunday lunch and best value for money,"We tried the omakase free flow Sunday lunch. It was really good value for money and the food was great. All the dishes were definitely fine dining quality but the price was very reasonable. The service was great, and all the waiters/waitresses were super attentive. We really enjoyed our Sunday lunch there."
Outstanding,"Had dinner here last week with my family , very romantic atmosphere & relaxing ambiance , although price a bit on the higher side , the food and service were well worth it .Excellent place good for business lunch, dinner or night out ."
Excellent Fine Dining Restaurant,"Had dinner here last week with my family , very romantic atmosphere & relaxing ambiance , although price a bit on the higher side , the food and service were well worth it .Excellent place good for business lunch, dinner or night out ."
Excellent place for Italian dishes with fresh produce,"We went, 2 adults, for lunch.

LOCATION: Concert Hall, so definitely in the city center. Easy to reach with MRT also.
You are inside the Concert Hall building, so this already gives you a nice atmosphere.

FOOD: I can only say the food is basically speaking based on super fresh ingredients, which, in the Italian cuisine, is 80% of the trick. Seriously like being in Italy in a good resto.

SERVICE: very attentive. The executive Chef Simone is also a gracious and passionate host. Ask him about the preparation of the food and he will open for you the doors of his hearth!

To sum up: good location, good food, good service. Cannot ask more!"
World class restaurant,Amazing venue furnished in gorgeous tone of white marble. Food is superb here and the head Chef is one of the best in town
Nice atmosphere and good food,"Victoria Memorial Hall historical building is a fantastic location for this restaurant. The historic building creates a very nice and cosy atmosphere.
Waitresses were really friendly and responsive, especially Donna.
Selection of food was good, except for the starters. None of them jumped out at us. We went straight to the main. We ordered angel hair pasta/Black garlic and bottarga, soufflé gnocchi with prawns and salmon roe and finally the lobster.
The waitress told us that unfortunately the black garlic was not available tonight and as soon as she finished her explanation, the Chef came and apologized for that. He gave us a few options and we realty appreciated it.
Food was really flavorful and yummy. A good dinner."
Would come back again and again!,"My friend and I went for Sunday lunch and it was really value for money!

We got 9 plates of deliciously prepared food for the price of SGD 52++. Note that some plates had more than 1 course and that you can order one more round of any or even all the plates that you enjoyed! Super worth it, in my opinion.

Granted that you would have your favorite ones and those that you didn't enjoy as much, I overall loved the experience. I don't really like super fine dining where I couldn't tell if what's on my plate is edible or not. Foo'd for me was comfortable, uncomplicated and yummy.

The ambience is really nice and classy --all white and high ceilings. The tables were far apart so you get your privacy.

The service is superb as well -- the waiters were very attentive. They would clear the table very quickly and bring in the next plate right away. But you would never feel rushed as you could take your time to enjoy the food.

Overall, I'd recommend everyone to try this out. I think you're getting way more than what you're paying for. I can't wait to find an occasion so me and my friends could visit again!"
Fine dining at its best - lunch,One of the best fine dining experience that is kind to your pocket. Go there for their lunch and be surprise with their chefs menu. Best Italian - Japanese cuisine
Not your average Italian Restaurant,"If a restaurant’s venue adds to the experience, Foo’d gets of to a great start. Housed in the beautiful Victoria theatre its outward grandeur is matched by a spacious and modern design within. The food was equally beautifully presented and matched by great flavours. The four course lunch special offers two choices of starters along with a soup and a dessert (all at a very reasonable 52++). I opted for the asparagus and poached egg starter with taleggio and black truffle; the creamy taleggio sauce had a delicious cheesy flavour that wasn’t overpowering, but when mixed with the perfectly prepared poached egg and fragrant truffle, it was mouthwatering combo. As a bit of food swapping was going on , I also tried he octopus starter which was artistically presented and tasted soft, yet still firm enough to have a nice texture. Next came te creamy mushroom soup which was also presented very well by being poured over some steamed whole mushrooms. The grilled seafood dish came next and although it wasn’t as spectacular as the previous starter it was well presented and tasty. Cooked with subtle flavours that complimented the texture of prawns and fish without disguising it. Of all the dishes the dessert was good rather then great, a nice mango pana cotta with pineapple chunks and lime zest. Overall the meal was well balanced, tasty, not overly filling, but packed with different and delicate tastes at every turn. The service was generally polite and efficient, although one guest was missed while ordering and some cutlery was missing before one of the courses. But that’s just nit-picking as all in all it was a great lunch. I think I’ll be back to try the omakase menu."
Gorgeous venue and even more amazing food,"Chef Simone is the person you would wanna have in your kitchen, skilful, friendly and knows what he wants in his food. Every dish is thoughtfully prepared and executed perfectly world class standards"
Disappointed! Second visit of weekend Omasake lunch,"This was out second visit since last July. The first time was perfect, food was amazing with great value. Creative presentation with high quality ingredient. We have kept missing it until we were able make it again last weekend.
The price has increased by 15%, which we knew it in advance, but we still want go since the food was way too attractive. But, the menu changed so much and all the costly ingredients almost disappeared. Seafood, beef and my favorite smoky duck. They replaced it by honey duck which I didn't want to order again. To that extent. All the portion were smaller which was fine since you can order again. But you feel, the feeling is not good when you see the size shrank so much.
I will not go again, very sad that suddenly I lost my favorite restaurant but good thing,like is I don't need to diet so much for a meal in the future."
Awesome!,"Very nice restaurant, in the nicest area of the city. Excellent dinner, great quality materials and creative cuisine. Very friendly service, good wine list at reasonable prices. One of my best dinners in Singapore"
Italian with a twist ....,"Italians love eating, cooking, talking about food since ever (way before this was 'mainstream'). Being and Italian in Singapore I sincerely appreciated the establishment of Foo'd. Quality drive, prepared Crew, First Class Chef Simone De Palmas nested in the renewed Victoria Concert Hall makes a real difference. Among the huge plethora of pretentious players in Italian restaurants Foo'd deserve a very high ranking. Definitely suggested. Keep up the good work guys!"
Fantastic omakase lunch!,"Had the weekend omakase and it was an amazing experience. It was 14 courses on that day and its all-you-can-eat. Comes in taster sized portions so you can try all and decide which ones you like the most. My favourites were: foie gras, cauliflower soup, risotto and beef cheek.

Staff were very attentive and knowledgeable about the food and building (it is in a beautiful colonial era part of town). Elegant surroundings inside, but I popped outdoors for dessert so I could enjoy the view of the National Gallery, Cricket Club and Singapore Flyer.

Great value for SGD 52! Sadly I was too full to order a second round of my faves."
Weekend omakase lunch need booking,"Was told by a friend that they serve (omakase)12 course lunch for $52.00 only on Saturday.
Italian cuisine, nice ambient upon sitted chef came around greeted guest.
Not a bad deal for this omakase food presentation also good.
Quite a good portion and at the end of the meal a waitress csme and ask if we like any of the the dish they will serve us more.
We were surprised at this gesture, we said it will be great if our meal include coffee or tea. The reply they do hsve hot drink but charge separately.
We joking said free ok pay no, then came the manager after some conversation he said he try snd see what he can do.
Then we were served a pot of free tea, he really make our day and we feel so complete with the hot tea.
The extra service and flexibility will definitely bring in more business,
We then book another date to bring families.
Understand they now open on sunday.
To the manager good job."
Weekend Brunch,Visited for the weekend brunch whilst visiting SG on recommendation by my son. Wow we were not disappointed- beautifully presented courses of delicious Italian food to excite you. Service also impeccable- discrete and attentive. Will return on our next visit from London.
Nice paced brunch,Some hits and some misses but overall well executed dishes. Could do better with plating as while aesthetically pleasing it was impossible to grab some of the food from the dishes used.
once is enough,"The restaurant is quite nice. We went for the omakase lunch.
Food was not bad, but served a little too slow even though there were just about 5 tables around.
Desserts were a little disappointing though.
Bad point was we felt that they were quite pushy about their alcoholic drinks. We told them we didn't want to drink alcoholic beverages since it was a lunch, but they continued to tell us about their bespoke cocktails service so we just ordered 1 so that they could leave us alone."
Affordable fine dining,"We went to FOO'D for a friend's birthday and it didn't disappoint. The presentation of each dish was impeccable and well thought out. The spread was a good range: we had things from foie gras mousse and black truffle to beef short rib and excellent seared salmon. For what you get, the weekend all you can eat omakase lunch is extremely affordable!"
Great Weekend Omakase Lunch,"Nice ambience with great foods & service. 1) crispy prawn with ginger sauce 2) potato leek,watermelon,roasted octopus 3) beef short ribs Above 3 are my favourite."
Great place for creative Italian food,"We are vegetarian and most Italian restaurants only offer us few options. Foo'd was a completely different experience - we had the Omakase menu and the chef delighted us with creative creations...we had a wonderful meal and the chef personally came and checked in with us several times...overall, very good attention to service and great food."
First visit- definitely won’t be out last!,"This is a superb restaurant.
Fantastic food combinations, and great service combine to make eating here a real occasion.

We had the 5 course Degustation menu which I’d recommend, as it allows you to try a wide selection of dishes.

Chef Simone came out to chat with us, and was happy for us to change any items on the menu, at every course he came to see us, talk about the recipe and check we were happy- fantastic service.

Even the cutlery and glasses have a story behind them, which I will leave for the waiters to tell when you visit.

Fully recommended, we will be back again...."
2nd visit in a month and still want to go back soon,Value for money. Every course was a delight. Wine selection focuses on Italian. It's a well-selected list.
"Beautiful place, beautiful lunch",We have always enjoyed its weekend Omakase lunch. The lamb was made perfectly. We will definitely return again.
Experience at Foo'd by Davide Oldani,Atmosphere was great as the restaurant sits in a museum. Interior was pleasant to be in. Food was even better. Loved the sea bass and the desserts were superb. Can't stop thinking about the lychee creme brûlée!!!
Good food and service,"The service was excellent. The ambience is nice, great dining place for couples. Love the wine they recommended."
Incredible interpretations,"Had 13 courses of wonderful produce served in very interesting formats. What's even better, if you love the dish so much you could ask for it again right before they fire the desserts.
Chef Davide himself was greeting everybody present on the very busy F1 weekend. It was also my partner's birthday, and the staff were sweet enough to bring out a slice of cake.
Wonderful dinning fine dinning experience at very affordable prices, must try!"
"Awesome night, awesome dinner",Food was great! The chef actually came out to have chats with us and making sure that we are ok with the food and service. Would definitely return to try other dishes.
Awesome brunch,Really cannot complain at all for 52++ for free flow omakase brunch. Hits and misses but overall pretty awesome. Will definitely be back
Value for money but.....,"We were there for a couples weekend lunch getaway from the kids and was very impressed with the ambience being our first time. Perhaps we already started off wrong as hubby was put off by the purple potato dish, too cheesy for a start and we could not really taste any foie gras in it though it was very beautifully set on a plate with the polenta and frog leg tempura. Those 2 appetizers were fine but not seriously blown away still....

Next on the pumpkin soup, it was light with a tinge of ginger and served with a few slices of grilled octopus. Nice offset to the cheesiness of the potato. The 2 dishes that followed - Gnocchi and Marsala were refreshing combination of different ingredients. Also, the next 2 dish - Branzino (sea bass) and Beef cheek were cooked to perfection! Hence, hubby reordered the Branzino as well as the beef cheeks again! Unfortunately, it did not taste the same the second time round. The beef cheeks were overcooked and the Branzino I had had a bone in it (about 1cm)! I informed one of the staff (in grey suit) about the bone and he mentioned that he will feedback to the kitchen. That was all there is on the Michelin Star service (or none!) that we were expecting. Totally disappointing!

Though the meal is truly value for money and the place is nearly full by the time we left, I truly hope that the management is able to better train the kitchen (QC) and service staff."
Fine dining with great service at reasonable prices,"Housed in the historic Victoria Concert Hall, this spacious restaurant has an alfresco area for drinks and offers fine dining sets in generous potions at very reasonable prices. Matched with attentive service and helpful recommendations by restaurant manager, this is definitely one of the best pre-concert meal in town!"
Great Dinning Experience!,"My friend and I had the Saturday omakase lunch for her birthday. The staff were lovely, friendly and attentive. They even brought us a special birthday surprise!

The restaurant is beautiful and yet the atmosphere is unpretentious. Chef Simone Depalmas is so humble and greets all his patrons personally and even asked us why we didn't finish some dishes (paiseh) but honestly it was cause we were way too full by the 4th appetizer. He was even gracious enough to let us take a picture with him! The staff explained each dish to us and every course was exciting. It is amazing affordable as well.

I would definitely come back to try their weekday course menus. I would love to thank the team for making this day so special for us, it was the best dining experience I had in Singapore this summer."
Saturday Omakase is great value for money!,"We had the Saturday omakase for $48++ - 8 courses with unlimited repeat. The food was delicious and price was great value. Add to that the setting was great. Will definitely be back, and try the free flow Prosecco too."
Excellent Food and Service!,"Having read all the good reviews, I decided to try this restaurant with my colleagues during lunch. We really enjoyed the food.. good quality ingredients served with impressive presentation and taste. I must say we were very impressed with the service staff too who were all very attentive and gave their best in service. It was also great that the chef came around the tables to greet the diners.
Ambience was nice.. classy and romantic. I will definitely be back again for a romantic dining experience here!"
return visit,"This is our ""go-to"" for a dinner prior to a show at the Victoria Theatre - super convenient as it is in the Victoria Theatre!.

A return visit, I was really looking forward to their entree caramelised tartlet, however it wasn't as good as the first time. It was simply over-done - borderline burnt so was disappointed - sorry!

Perhaps next time we will try the ala'carte menu instead of the pre-theatre offering - oddly the ala'carte menu wasn't even offered to us and we had to ask for it. If you ask for soup, request the bread - they only bring this afterwards with the main."
Nice venue and food beautifully presented,My first time here and I had omakase lunch with 3 friends. The food was beautifully presented and we enjoyed the majority of items on the menu (13 items!). Good value for money
Well worth the time,"It has hits and misses, but is overall worth the checking out. Desserts are not strong. Very pleasant service."
Amazing Saturday lunch,"I visited the restaurant last Saturday for Omakase lunch ,is my second visit in this restaurant,absolutely one incredible experience ,for the food quality,for the food presentation,for the great service staff, for the Chef who takes care of you, This restaurant is absolutely Michelin star level"
Underwhelming experience,"Granted I dined alone but there was very little atmosphere for a Saturday night. There was limited options on the menu, especially for pre-theatre. The food was very heavy/rich and felt quite uncomfortable after. Some lighter and more healthier options would be preferred, especially if attending a show afterwards. The food appeared to be pre-prepared as well. Had hoped for something more special in such a beautiful location."
"Excellent service, value-for-money","Service staff was attentive, head chef was warm and friendly. Unique dishes that delighted our tastebuds :)"
Best Omakase ever!!,"Value for money 💰Omakase lunch on Saturday Exquisite quality and variety of gourmet Excellent service and servers, including friendly Chef who goes round chatting with guests Perfectly classy ambience Highly recommended!!"
Great for pre-show dinner... and more,"Excellent food combinations be it for taste and texture, very good presentation and service; overall nothing we did not enjoy... even the bread and butter were excellent ;-) Looking forward to our next visit..."
Weekend Omakase Lunch,"Beautiful interior, unique food, impeccable service! My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit and will definitely be back for more."
Awesome!,"Had ala carte dinner before our Boeing Boeing show. I must say we thoroughly enjoyed the food n service rendered to us by the professional n friendly staff. Assistant chef made an effort to come to us to explain the meals. Food was very good n tasty .Nice embience n will definitely go back again. Special thanks to staff Furhan ( hope spelling is correct ), Christina n Uncle Foo ever so smiley he told us his niece was the owner hence Foo'd combined with the chef's name. Highly recommended!"
Very pleasant experience!!,"Overall very pleasant experience! The staffs were all very attentive and knowledgeable. Food was very nice, even the cutlery was very interesting."
Pre-Concert dinner,Very friendly staff and our wonderful server was Christine. We had the most amazing and intimate dining experience. Soft music so conversations can be heard. Brilliant and eye popping food presentation.
Wonderful food and experience,"I've been here twice and both times I'm stunned by the creativity of the chefs and the wonderful service. Every dish made us feel a new experience, even something familiar like smoked duck was executed in a way that made us look at it through different eyes.

It's amazing value for such high quality and I'm shocked they're not fully booked all the time. Do not hesitate - the Saturday afternoon omakase menu is a steal. You get to try 10 dishes and then reorder any number of those you liked. I've not had a single bad plate here. Not even a mediocre plate. Everything is good.

I'm definitely coming back."
"Great meal, ambience, service.",Unforgettable experience especially when chef came by twice to chat with us. Definitely recommended and will be returning there very soon
Nice ambiance and satisfied,"The ambiance is good and the cutlery is interesting. As for the food, the taste of the starter is nice, we love it. The staff are polite and friendly. Overall we are happy with the service and foods."
Top notch food and service,My dad and I had dinner here as part of the pre-concert dinner tie up with the Tang Tee Khoon grand series Beethoven the Heroic years. I informed the staff that my dad was diabetic and they kindly arranged an alternative dessert for him - a fruit platter with pineapple sorbet. This was really going above and beyond their duty as they could easily have said that the menu was fixed. The food and service were extremely commendable. My dad and I had a really lovely experience.
Foo'd,"Food was good, especially tomato starter and coffee flavoured risotto. Ambience nice, but please take away the LCD screens"
