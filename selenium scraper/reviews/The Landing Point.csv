Cozy place to have HTHT with nice food,View was awesome and the service was great! We came early and they allowed us to find a table to settle down first.
Great Afternoon tea in FABULOUS LOCATION üòç,"We had gorgeous Afternoon tea here and I just loved the decor, ambience and those VIEWS! Great place for celebrations üíØüíØü´∂"
Good ambience and tasty. Staff friendly.,"Nice view and staff Ms.Lotha very nice! The environment is very quiet, guests are very gentle, there is no noise, it is a very comfortable place. There is a male staff play the piano, which is very nice. Will come again."
Great aesthetically but‚Ä¶,"‚Ä¶in terms of the food on offer for our high tea this afternoon, I was hoping for a bit more. It mostly tasted very good but while the presentation was stunning and the ambience lovely, for the price charged, I would think that the selection of tastes might be a bit more varied too. For example: I like scallops but the sliced scallop tartlet tasted of nothing much other than salt."
Utter disappointment,"The restaurant is located opposite Marina Bay Sands with a nice river view.

Food was fine, but the quality I think was over-rated.

The service of the staffs were a bit disappointment with limited or ignorant attention given to diners.

Before leaving, we have requested for a complimentary parking coupon. Trusting that the staff will check on the coupon issued, it only came to our attention that the coupon given was expired.

I was utterly disappointed to have chosen this place to celebrate our anniversary"
Must go to The Landing Point!,Food and servicr was excellent. Professional staff that made us fill comfortable. Ambience was great. Beautiful setting of tea time set! We enjoyed our catch time so much!
Ambience is nice but....,"The ambience of the restaurant was nice and comfy. However, I find that the communication between staff and guest a bit lacking. We place our drinks order through a staff, thereafter, another staff came to ask. However, we end up with additional order of tea, which was wasteful. Trying to get top up for hot water for our tea was hard as there was obviously shortage of staff since the whole place was filled up during the 3-5pm hi-tea.

The food looks impressive, however the taste was so. Somehow the pairing of food ingredients doesn't seem right and end up with the dessert all tasting almost similar. Nothing memorable or distinct. Staff also did not take the time to explain which item was which. hence, we had a good time guessing. We also have a shortage of one of the item which should not be so.

Guess for the price this hi-tea cost, I will not be returning."
Fab high tea,"Great food with nice selections of tea time treats. Location is fab and has great ambiance, view is fantastic overlooking Marina Bay and staff are really friendly."
"Once a 5 star quality restaurant. Now, clueless & incompetent","It's been about 2 years since I last been to The Landing Point, and I must say, how far it has fallen. I don't understand what happen to a once 5 star hotel quality service to a worse than 3 star hotel service (maybe worse). Here are the things that happened:

1. We were asked to wait at the lobby and they will call us once our reservation timing starts. Time came and no one appeared. We walk to The Landing Point and there was a line of people queuing to enter. When we arrived at the counter. The staff look shock, giving that ""omg I forgotten to call them!"" look.

2. They mess up our seating, and didn't prepare for our arrival. Instead, they ask us to sit awhile and they will arrange our seats for us. 20min have passed and no one was serving us. We had to alert them to the situation before something was done; even that was greeted with cluelessness and panic.

3. Their staffs were either clueless or doesn't understand English. We asked them ""if this was still a buffet?""; the staff didn't know. When we alert them we didn't received an order, the staff doesn't seem to understand English (I mean literally).

4. Asked for a refill of water. They forgotten.

Honestly the best thing about this place was it's high tea buffet and it's service (pre-pandemic), but since that is no longer available, there's no reason to come.

Never am I coming back again."
Magnificent afternoon tea at the Landing Point,"The expressions afternoon tea at the landing point is a journey into a magical land. Exec Chef Sidd Prabhu excels with his sweets - especially the chocolate tart, and creative interpretation of local Kaya delights. The savouries are as exciting, with a diverse mix of smoked / cured fishes. The curated selection of TWG teas and Baccha Coffees balances the richness.

Special thanks to Karen for recommending a few items on the menu so my leftover Fullerton credits won't be wasted. And Asel who replaced a coffee that we couldn't adjust to. They were gracious and patient."
Amazing high tea and view!,"Excellent view of Marina Bay Sands.
I liked the high tea served, especially the Savory items. Some of the Sweet pastries a bit on the sweeter side. Only the Savory pastries are unlimited (not complaining as I love them!)
Fantastic service by Emma, she moved us to a bigger table since we ordered ala carte items on top of the high tea set. Ala carte dishes were also great by the way!
Will definitely come back, it was a great experience! A bit pricey but I do think it was worth it."
"Good environment, food so so","For $65 per person high tea, will expect the quality of the food to be better. For example, the savory pastry is soften. Variety is also very limited, will prefer it comes with a small semi buffet. However view is excellent and nice classical building."
Amazing afternoon tea experience,"Heard of this place as a popular afternoon tea venue, and really glad to find out there were vegetarian and vegan afternoon tea buffet menu.

Love the ambiance ‚Äî colonial style deco, seats were comfortable and relaxing, service was excellent,

Food were delicious. Free flow coffee / tea, most tea was TWG, coffee was great. Sweet pastries were excellent but no free flow. Savoury pastries were free flow but our vegetarian choices taste just average to below expectation. I was expecting common veg savoury such as spinach rolls, cheese pastries, quiches etc but we got sandwiches and other choices instead. Fortunately the scones were amazing, it was very moist, soft and free flow! I will return just for the scones.

Overall we had a wonderful afternoon tea session and I will definitely return for more."
Excellent High Tea,"An excellent vegan high tea. All dishes were prepared to a high standard and the service was very attentive. Dishes were replenished very quickly and you didn‚Äôt have to wait for a long time, which was great.

However, my only recommendation would be that they need to have more savoury dishes that don‚Äôt taste like meat/fish. As a former meat eater I don‚Äôt mind the taste of meat but if you have never had meat then the mock meat won‚Äôt be for you.

Overall I would recommend it as the setting is beautiful, the prices are very reasonable and doesn‚Äôt suffer from the same poor Singapore service levels we sometimes experience. Finally a special shout out to Emma who is very professional who went out of her way to make things special for us."
Excellent Service,"Wonderful and prompt service from Lotha, Tyson, Maria and Daniel Lee. Lotha especially, extremely professional, pleasant and understanding. Will definitely come back again, very fast and seamless. Great experience here!"
Lovely Lunch Experience,"Had a splendid lunch a few weeks ago here.

Was warmly welcomed by Emma, Maria and the rest of the team whom are working 8th Jan.

Food was well prepared and feedback on food was well taken care off. Emma was very professional in checking up with us on the food quality and the needs during the entire dining experience.

They went an extra mile to celebrate my birthday even though its was a few weeks back which of very kind of the team.

Would surely patronise again during my next stay at Fullerton."
Good Visit for Business and Friends,"I visited the landing point yesterday for afternoon tea with my client. Food was delicious and the view was amazing.

I would like to compliment the Korean guy who served us, forget his name. He was attentive and friendly. And especially he has good knowledge about teas. The tea that the staff recommended was just to my client‚Äô liking.

We enjoyed high tea. And i will visit my friends again. Thank you."
The Perfect Afternoon Tea,"The perfect afternoon tea! The Landing Point at the Fullerton Bay Hotel presents an elegant and scrumptious afternoon tea. Food is simply fantastic and fresh, seconds on your savoury and scones are a must. The sweets are equally excellent, you can taste the buttery goodness. Change your mind about your choice of beverage? No worries, just change, no restrictions. Service quality is top notch too! Overall, a 5 star experience."
Highly recommended - Afternoon High Tea,"Attentive of the staff to give us best view window seat as I shared during the booking the coming event is to celebrate my bff birthday. They have also surprised us with a small slice of Bd cake for my friend. Their thoughtfulness warm our heart
The young waitress Olivia that attended to us was attentive, sweet , warm n ever ready to top up our prefer choices of spread with her sweet smiles. She has also volunteered to take photo
Graphs ( good photos)

The food n drinks are highly recommended , we thoroughly enjoy our times at the landing point today ( 9jan 2022) . Thanks everyone of your efforts to able us to have a great time there ."
Disappointing experience this time round,"2nd time here but the experience this time round was so disappointing. Came to The Landing Point for my 3rd year anniversary. But the waiting time for the tier to arrived was super long - almost 20mins. I saw that the tier was at the serving counter but the hostess / waitress just didn't serve it. I get it that they were busy. But guests who were seated later than us received their food earlier. It's not like we ordered special items, it's just the generic set from the menu. We were only served after asking for our tier. Furthermore the one that has been left on the counter. The only saving grace was the complimentary chocolate cake. It was moist and not too sweet. Felt like I wasted our money this time round. Not recommended! I got bad mood from this high tea."
Review,The variety And selection has dropped so much since my last visit!the desserts were also not free flow as compared to last time. I wouldn‚Äôt go again.
High tea,"Love the ambience absolutely. But a few hiccups. First we can 2a1c (6 yrs old paid) but was served only 2 sets of sweets instead of 3. Secondly, my tea came in a v nice teapot but inside was just hot water. Luckily drinks and savoury was refillable if not my bills came up to almost $200 was totally not worth at all. A plus for the view but food wise was mediocre. Especially the sweets need to brush up."
Attentive staff,Emma was very attentive and helpful to families with kids. Will definitely visit the place again. üëçüèª
Afternoon Tea,"Waitresses were serving us the various foods that are fantastic and delicious. The view of the skyscrapers like Marina Bay Sands Hotel from the window, was pleasurable and enjoyable"
"Ideal spot for high tea in Singapore, overlooking Marina Bay at water level.","Fabulous Afternoon Tea, great selection of savoury, sweet items, champagne, no alcohol wine and of course tea and coffee, and scones and. Ream and jam. Go for the bottomless option and treat yourself and your partner. Book early to secure a window table overlooking Marina Bay.

I have to give a special mention to Emma and the team for making our afternoon fun and enjoyable, and for indulging me and my friend so much. Great fun afternoon, chatting and people watching as the procession of wedding parties passed through on the Saturday afternoon. Highly recommended."
Good ambience and very good service,Love the ambience and the staff are very nice and attentive. The pastries served are pretty good except the scones are quite disappointing.
Great birthday celebration high tea,Booked the place to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday. Great high tea selection and service. We were given a good seat of great views. Ended with a photo card for my friend and a slice of cake. Everyone makes us feel very welcomed and during payment the staff noticed I have a credit card to enjoy 20% discount and suggested to me to use the card! Totally impressed with their service level. It was my 3rd time to landing point and I know I will go back again :)
One of the best afternoon tea,"We had afternoon tea at the landing point. We were amazed by the view and ambiance. They offered wide variety of food with free flow savories and coffee tea. Daniel Lee is very helpful on the menu, with his suggestion, I tried something new. That was excellent. Will definitely visit again."
Perfect for a long lunch!,"Great service >>- going way 'above and beyond' expectations. Lotha, Daniel Lee, Xin Rong. Healthy food and a great array of beverages :) Amazing views from some/most seats - across the 'Bay'."
tea time,it was very cozy and the staff was very attentive and friendly they explained everything and was helpful in making suggestion
Moderate,"The ambience was nice. I had the afternoon tea. The savouries were okay. The cucumber sandwiches were normal. The king salmon with sea grapes, choux & burnt radish had a conflicting taste; salty & sweet base. Though the savouries were free flow, the taste was so so. When my plate was full, it was not changed. When I asked for a change of tea, e teapot was changed but cup wasn‚Äôt though it was filled with the previous one."
COMPLIMENT,"I like their service very well. Their attitude & service is so good, they will serve free cake & a memories photo card when you celebrate your birthday there. The scenery view from The Landing Point also very stunning, the view towards Marina Bay Sands is so clear and prettily good."
Great view and wonderful service,Went for high tea to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday. Had the add on free flow of champagne. The staff was quick to top up food and drinks. They even remembered that I mentioned the birthday celebration and give the birthday girl a piece of cake with happy birthday on the plate. Even gave her a postcard photo that they took for us. A very pleasant and memorable experience. Didn‚Äôt get the names of the staffs who served us but they are great!
Visit for the service and ambience,"Came here for high tea. Food wise was average, free flow savory items. Service was great, regular refills. Sadly was unable to get the window seats (made reservation 1 week before but was unable to get window seats)"
Enjoyable high tea experience,"It was a high tea date that my friend & I were really looking forward to for weeks; and it was such an enjoyable experience!

A delectable selection of high tea treats were presented - we were not fans of sweets in general but even the sweets were very well done! We absolutely loved the items presented in the Savoury menu, and were delighted that we got to refill our favourites multiple times :)

The Staff on duty were exceptional as well - Daniel made it a point to make us feel comfortable through friendly smiles and chats along the way, and even offered to take photographer-standard pictures for us as a form of momento. We certainly would not have thought of taking a picture :)

Prompt and professional service of the staff - Daniel, Olivia & Tyson made us (and our tummies) very happy, this will definitely not be our last trip to the Landing Point.

Thank you :)"
Fantastic High Tea,"Great choice of delicious food and beverages; reasonably priced (SGD50-60 p.p.); excellent service, great views"
Free flow hi tea,"This was the place that I always want come for hi tea. Free flow coffee and tea, as well as sandwiches. Very good service from Daniel. Met the new Director Mr. Yunkai Wong, he is very professional leader and talked about all dining options at Fullerton Bay. We will come back soon."
Best high tea in Singapore,"Been here countless times now and food and service have always been consistently good. I‚Äôve tried many high teas and have to say this is probably the best one in the whole of singapore, considering the food, the view and the ambiance.

Scones and all savouries are refillable, sweets are not. Free flow of tea and coffee. I always ask for tables next to the window with marine bay sands view. Staff are friendly and attentive, although sometimes they may seem overwhelmed by the amount of patrons.

Would definitely recommend this place to all!"
Good high tea time,"Ambiance and location are great, ideal to enjoy a moment of relax.
Service is really good and kind.
Food selection could be better though we found it a bit limited and repetitive.
Special thanks to the staff (Lotha, Daniel, Tyson) for the quick and attentive service."
Form over substance,"The ambience and decor at the Fullerton Bay Hotel are lovely. The ladies serving the high tea at the Landing Point are also lovely, but there are not enough of them.
Afternoon tea really is not a complicated proposition - serve people a combination of scones, nibbles and sweets and try to have the tea ready at roughly the same time. None of this gets done at the Landing Point. To be fair, the mini scones were excellent. However, they are supposed to be served with clotted cream and the Landing Point is just another place that can‚Äôt get this right. (Marks & Spencer‚Äôs in Singapore sells decent enough clotted cream though). Also, the portions of cream and jam are tiny. The staff will bring more, but it‚Äôs annoying to have to keep asking for it.
The champagne we ordered was flat. This was replaced without any fuss.
No one came to take an order for drinks. We had to keep chasing them, first for the champagne then for the tea. Tea was served when we were almost half way through the meal.
The savory and sweet nibbles were no more than edible - cantine style. Bread was not fresh and it all looked like it had been prepared a very long time before it was served. The egg salad and pate, I could not even eat it. Same with a cupcake. As mentioned in other reviews, cheap ingredients, all rather low quality. We paid about SGD 100,- per person. This includes two classes of champagne. Nevertheless there is a disconnect between price and quality."
Good service and ambience,Staff was very attentive and offered to help with photo-taking and refilling of the food items at the high tea. Very good food and good range of teas.
Perfect place to afternoon tea.,Such a warm and inviting atmosphere to enjoy the delicious spread of sweet and savouries with lovely cup of tea overlooking the beautiful view of Marina Bay and MBS hotel. The view is simply awesome and the wonderful staff will certainly make you feel comfortable.
Awesome Afternoon Tea,"A very pleasant afternoon spent at The Landing Point. Received a call 2 days earlier to confirm the reservation and to check if I have any dietary restrictions. Got a table with a nice view overlooking the bay and MBS. Servers were very attentive and polite, and takes initiative to ask if we need any refills. Love all the savouries which are refillable. The sweet were just as great! Choice of coffee and tea which are free-flow and able to choose both! The staff took a picture for us and printed a lovely photo in a card as a souvenir for my birthday celebration that comes with their classic chocolate cake."
Hi Tea,"Amazing Hi Tea session, great food which totally worth the price. Also enjoyed service from Lotha and Idros. Really grateful for Idros paying detailed and special attention to his customers, making his customers feeling more comfortable while having the hi tea."
Vegan & Vegetarian Afternoon tea,Great view overlooking Marina Bay and was pleasantly surprised to hear that the chef specially ordered vegetarian cheese for us as we had a lot of dietary restrictions. Great service by Daniel too - he helped us to adjust the table and seats for us to get a photo without a pillar in the middle and adjust it back and was very hospitable as well. Food was rather decent considering our dietary restrictions and my mum and I enjoyed our time there!
Nice view (if you get the right seat),"nice place but can get a little noisy depending on other customers dining at the same time.. has a different menu for november unfortunately as i was looking forward to the original menu items.. food was so-so.. do note if you are paying with a card that has promotion you need to inform the staff that you would like to enjoy the discounted rate as i was charged the original price at first.. when i enquired, the staff asked if i would like to be charged at the discounted rate instead.. strange.."
Afternoon Tea with a View,We were seated by the window and we have an unobstructed view of the Marin Bay Sands. They offered eight selections of tea and seven selections coffee. Love their scones. It was soft with the right amount of sweetness. We asked for a refill pf the beef randang and the kueh pie tee. We were assisted by Ms. Lotha and Marie they were very attentive.
High-Tea Review,It was awesome! I super love the lower seats near the window. The food is nice too except for the dessert :) YUMMMMMS!!
Disappointing High Tea!,"It is perfectly alright to feature local delights for high tea but not if you serve subpar food in taste and quality. Ditch the fanciful names and what we had today for high tea were worse than dining in a hawker centre. Major disappointment! Beef rendang was dry and bland; Cucumber sandwich was merely thin cucumber slices laid on buttered bread; Chicken sandwich which tasted like tuna; Chilli crab bun served cold with a few shreds of crabmeat which tasted more like shredded chicken; Kueh pie tee shell was not crispy and had only vegetables filling, we expected fresh shrimps fillings at least for dining at a 5 star hotelEven the most basic highlight of the high tea went horribly wrong;the scone was not buttery, not light and flaky nor tenderThe sweets served were of mediocre standard, I really do not want to waste more time describing how they tastedYou could have done alot better than this being a 5 star hotel seriouslyyyyy! Damage:$56++ per pax. Go for it if you want to pay only for the ambience, provided that you get a table overlooking MBS that is...."
Experience at Landing Point,Daniel and Ruth Tyson provided great service and we definitely enjoyed the ambience and food served. I definitely had a great time catching up with friends and look forward to my next visit!
Came here to celebrate my,"Came here to celebrate my mother‚Äôs birthday with my family

The view was amazing with Marina Bay Sands as the backdrop

The food was not bad. I did like the beet root pastry the most. The savoury stuff are refillable while the desserts are a one time.

If you‚Äôre looking for dessert this is not the place.

The tea selection was under TWG and everyone enjoyed their own choice of tea (mine was Moroccan mint, and I liked it)

My stars are given for the excellent service. They were all well aware of our table‚Äôs needs and there were enough staff for each table."
Amazing service!,"Amazing service by ms lotha and Mavie. Constantly providing refills for us and attentive to details. Macarons , truffle eggs in saffron buns are a must try!"
Delightful high tea,Had an enjoyable afternoon tea with a friend thanks to their delicious food and attentive crew (Daniel and Emma) who provided timely replenishments without interrupting conversations/ being invasive.
Flawless Service,"Absolutely wonderful experience for the special Charity Breast Cancer Afternoon Tea. Amazing for the hotel to donate some money from this. The savouries and sweets were perfect, the added champagne deal is generous and the tea, which is included is beautiful. Love that you can select more of the savouries as they are truly delicious and the sweet offerings plentiful. I wish that they would consider proper clotted cream for the scones as I buy it here now, imported from the UK so I know it‚Äôs available!
I highly recommend this afternoon tea experience for value for
Money. Many thanks to all the servers who were so kind and helpful and thanks
For the anniversary cake! Delicious"
Birthday bash!,"Went to dine in at landing point for my bday celebration and all I can say is , they made my birthday extra extra special!! The food was great, kudos to the chef who prepared a super super perfect steak! The staff were all amazing , Haizul and Leah especially. super friendly and very efficient! Love the surprised cake. I was really touched and surely they made my day! Would definitely recommend this place to friends. Will come back again!
Thank you Fullerton Bay and Landing point team! Much love‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Not recommended for meal,"we had the risotto and nasi lemak. As mentioned by another reviewer, the nasi lemak was terribly disappointing. the one at the hawker probably tastes better. The rice was bland, and even the otar, egg and fried chicken were way below average (and bland). the only thing one can't get wrong is the ikan bilis and nuts... the risotto was also bland. have dined here previously and thought the food was better. maybe standards have dropped.
only the ambience is nice.
also as mentioned by another reviewer, while the wait staff were polite, they were not attentive even though there were only 2 tables at the lobby level of the restaurant, and I also didnt understand why my mum and I were only served HALF a cup of warm water..."
"Good food, good service!","First time dining for the high tea set with my siblings. A little hiccup at the start when we request for a switch of seats nearer to the glass panel to get a better view since it‚Äôs an exchange of 4 seats to 4 seats, but the staff mention not available and not answering our request by saying max 5 pax and all. She don‚Äôt seems to understand my question/request. I didn‚Äôt get her name but I think it was a Filipino lady. However, was resolved by another staff which was more flexible.

Food wise was good after trying various high tea set in Singapore. All the other staff there were friendly as well. Good experience. Will come back again."
Find elsewhere for dinner pls,"Since we've Happy Hour at Gin Parlour, we wanted somewhere close to have a nice dinner. Read so much nice reviews of The Landing Point (mostly about the high tea) thought dinner can't go wrong too. Arrived at 630pm, ushered to the high chair tables which have nice view. No one came and I've to ask for a waiter that we're keen to order. Had Satay to start and disappointed by the size and quality of the satay. The chef obviously tries to flatten each of them so probably 1 portion can make 10 more sticks. We do not mind paying premium for local food in a hotel but it has to be of some quality.

Dinner menu is limited so partner ordered Nasi Lemak while I had Duck Fonfit SGD 49. Both are disappointing again. The Nasi Lemak SGD 31? are pathetic in terms of presentation and quality. Duck Confit is way too salty. We were so looking forward to have a nice meal from a 5 star hotel but judging by the quality of food, we think Fullerton on a whole is struggling. We were thinking of having a stay-cation here but Landing Point experience made me think twice.

Ambience was nice but service is poor despite probably 2 tables having dinner? Leaving we saw quite a few waiters hovering at ""reception"" area. We think they're over-staff with workers standing at the wrong area."
Splendid High Tea,"The Landing Point has really outdone itself. Already, the place hs an excellent view and atmosphere to it. The staff were really friendly and constantly polite when checking in on us. Credits to Daniel and Zoul for attending to us and our many requests. Will come again because of the quality of their food, their staff and their excellent service and attention to details."
Best service and best afternoon high tea,"Staff were all very attentive and helpful. They constantly checked with us whether we wanted to add more savouries for our high tea, and whether we needed more photos taken. Savouries were very delicious! Find the sweet on average. Must try their signature Fullerton express tea:)"
Landed at perfect ambience,Elegance and luxurious ambience fills this place for special occasions such birthdays or anniversary celebrations. Service team were awesome and attentive to detail. Perfect ambience for a high tea with great backdrop of the marina bay view.
Awesome hi-tea!,"Me and wife had hi-tea here on a Sunday and it was a memorable time. The staff, food and ambience were fantastic. Daniel and Idrus was very attentive to guests and it was a pleasure having them near our table."
Amazing team coupled with scrumptious food,"he service crew delivered a phenomenal dining experience for us, everything was well structured and served in an orderly manner, most importantly all my guests enjoyed this wholesome experience that was delivered by the service team - Prakashh, Jayson, Lotha & Vava!o. Kudos to everyone!

Also, not forgetting the food that we had. It beyond incredible, every single piece of dessert/ snack looks appealing and the taste was on point. Incredible work from the pastry chefs'!"
Amazing view,"Especially thank u for Ms Marine/ Maria and Emma and Idrus, really great service and wonderful experience, with amazing view , facing Marina bay sand building.....so fantastic! English afternoon tea is a good choice for weekends !"
Nice high tea experience,"Enjoyed high tea with perfect view in the landing point. Special thanks to hostess Maria, server Idrus and Emma. You guys did a very good job! Thank you and appreciate it!"
High Tea,The high tea pastries are yummy! The ambience and scenery is really nice and relaxing! Together with the excellent service from Ms Lotha! It was a really great experience here with my friends! We had a really awesome high tea session!
Exceptional afternoon tea with superb customer service!,"Landing Point is always my top choice when it comes to one of the most value for money afternoon teas in Singapore with undeniably the best customer service.

As it was International women‚Äôs day, we were greeted by tiers adorned in a splendid shade of lilac. The lobster cornet and prosciutto bagel were delicious, and the vegan set was noteworthy for the new menu including Impossible patty.

Best though was the superb customer service offered by Prakash, Idrus, Vanessa, Emma and Lotha - who were all exceptionally warm and amiable despite the busy noon service. They were also attentive and refilled our tiers promptly upon request, just the service alone warrants a trip back!"
Vegan afternoon tea at The Landing Point,"My wife an I went for the vegan afternoon tea at around 12PM on a Saturday. We were seated next to the large window with fantastic view on Marina Bay. We were served by Latha and we found the service perfect. The vegan food was delicious and cream on the pie, we got a 30% discount that makes this afternoon tea the best deal in town !"
wedding planning with friends,"had a great experience dining here at the landing point. food are great, service was superb. thanks to Idrus who always make sure we dont run out of twg teas. highly recommend, best high tea in the city with a view."
Afternoon tea at the bay,"Good service, ambiance and food. We had a very great experience dinning here for
the first time. Special thanks to idrus, princess, mica and Vanessa. Thank you for taking care of us. Highly recommend high tea in tge city!"
Consistent service levels and good food,"Was there for high tea to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday.

The food for the high tea can be topped up. So you can eat to your hearts content.

You have a choice of drink - tea coffee chocolate. And you can change it once.

Service is good. Staff is around but not in your face so you feel that there is privacy.
Ambience is nice. It was relatively quiet on a weekday afternoon. Perfect place to unwind and catch up with loved ones.

Highly recommended."
Sundown Soiree-Evening Hi Tea,"The food is fabulous with the refills upon request. Free flow coffee and tea blends. Loved the lobster prawn mayo, ham w/cheese and ondeh ondeh macarons. Had a last minute birthday request and got surprised with a cake and birthday song by the staff on service(Lotha and another lady)

The service there is first class!! Will return again soon!"
Nice place!,"Had an excellent valentine‚Äôs here. food was great and atmosphere enjoyable :) especially liked the cucumber sandwiches and sencha tea

all the staff also gave excellent service and helped relocate us to a bigger table when they saw it was free. lotha (one of the staff) was very friendly and helpful.

would recommend!"
Excellent Afternoon Tea....Lived up to expectations,"During a recent visit to Singapore I booked for and had afternoon tea at The Landing Point in the Fullerton Bay Hotel...This was a memorable experience and it did not disappoint...The booking was made the previous day and when I arrived I was met by smiling,friendly staff who made me feel most welcome...The food itself was superb and consisted of a wide variety of both sweet and savoury items...My cake stand was replenished a number of times and I was left feeling very satisfied indeed...This was a most memorable experience and was the perfect way to round off my two weeks in Singapore...worth a return visit...top class...10 out of 10."
40th Wedding Anniversary Made Memorable,"Celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary with The Landing Point's Afternoon High Tea. We were welcomed with warm smiles from people more than willing to be of assistance. Mavie had been a delight althroughout checking on us from time to time as well as Lotha who have been helpful to us as well. The cake for the celebration and the printed photo to capture the moment was but a cherry on top. Thank you, Fullerton Bay Hotel for making our 40th wedding anniversary unforgettable. Here is to looking forward for the next time!"
Excellent service as always at the Landing Point,"The high tea at The Landing Point, Fullarton Bay Hotel is my favourite place for high tea in Singapore. Lovely ambience, delicious food, and the service is always faultless! I came with my Mum on this occasion who needed a comfortable seat due to her back pain and they were more than happy to accomodate us. We even got a table with a view. We were also extremely impressed by the excellent services of Emma, Maria, and Vanessa. These ladies took such great care of us, always with smiles on their faces, and no request was too much of a problem for them. We will definitely be back!"
Excellent service!,"I have booked a high-tea buffet to celebrate my hubby's birthday at the Landing Point. To give my hubby some surprise, I have requested for a birthday cake and a good view over the bay. The staff has readily agreed to my request. On the actual day, we were greeted warmly by the staff of Landing Point, Irene being one of them. Their service was commendable and warm. The highlight was their birthday song accompanying the lighted candle! It was definitely a memorable celebration for us, especially the tea selection. They are the best variety we have ever savoured!"
Peaceful and pleasant,"Cosy and comfortable place in a nice location, with a view. The staff is elegant and smiling, and the service rather efficient. Good coffee and fresh juices."
Generous and efficient,"Was served by Maria and team this afternoon and we are very happy with their service. Food was generously served and they were very polite. Only bit lacking was the introduction to the different tiers of food, so my friend and i were on a journey of surprise :) loved the truffle egg mayo and lobster cornet. The sweets would be appreciated by those with a huge sweet tooth."
Excellent Service- Thumbs and Toes Up!!,"Wonderful ambiance and food. They even top up the items you like. Free flow of coffee and tean. Shey, Emma and the team were wonderful. Thank you for the tremendous service. Will definitely visit this place again."
The landing point hi-tea,"The hi-tea spread has dropped from my last experience couple of years back. The ingredients used were all very cheap and not appetizing to start with. There is no wow factor to it.
We have a normal hi tea set and a vegetarian hi tea set. The vegetarian hi-tea set as savories like white bread with cucumber/ bread topped with pickes/bread with beet root. Such are very cheap and not interesting foods.

Normal hi-tea set has savories like minced lobster in pastry/ egg mayo bread/ ham bread which are very basic and non interestng items we can easily find in any cafes.

The price of the hi-tea is not very worth with the quality of foods presented.

Would appreciate the team to review the quality and selections of foods to make it more worthy.

Christmas Afternoon Tea,"Lovely afternoon with delicious high tea, made our Christmas in Singapore really special. A beautiful spread and service was great. Phi looked after us through the service and was super attentive!"
Best tea ‚òïÔ∏è,"Christmas Day tea with an amazing view.
The service and staff is exceptional.
The food was delicious and great choices for vegetarians.
Buffet not a lot of savory choices for vegetarians just the main tea options.
Ask to be seated in the gallery for a view of the Marina."
Wonderful tea time experience,"After reading several reviews about the lackluster service and food, I was initially apprehensive about having our afternoon tea here. However, the staff and food quality of Landing point completely exceeds my expectations. Firstly, our seating request (indoor, beside window) was adhered to, which allows us to have a great view of MBS and the river. The manager and waiters were extremely attentive, and would approach us with refills and ask if we would need any help whenever we pick up the menu, or when our tier of food begins to empty. Therefore everything feels very thoughtful and personalized. The Christmas deserts were very tasty (love the fruit cake) and the savory options were good as well, especially the cheese tart and the lobster wafer. Me and my friend are not fussy eaters, so everything was quite delicious to us. Staff were very helpful about our questions, and even went the extra mile to check with the chef if we could purchase the non-alcoholic fruit cake back. I would defiantly recommend Landing point to anyone who wishes to have a relaxing and delightful afternoon tea experience."
Disappointing afternoon tea at the Fullerton Hotel Singapore,"My wife and I entertained friends at the Fullerton this afternoon with the High Tea. What a disappointment. To be true, the food was fine and beautifully presented.

It was like dining in a food hall. Nothing special and had tourist groups in with cameras blazing. My privacy was not respected.

The tea, and the manner in which it was served was not up to a standard that was acceptable. Luke warm tea, and it required us to call the attention of the staff when we needed replenishment of both tea and milk.

It made me feel that at best, leadership was missing.

There appeared to be adequate staffing, however many wandering around, eyes up.

I will not be able to recommend this tea to anyone. The harpist started playing well after 3pm and the sound of a jack hammer drilling did deter from the already devoid atmosphere.

I suppose we have been spoilt in that we are staying at the Sofitel in Singapore and we just love the quiet and attentive staff that are here.

We just might leave the visit for High Tea to the Tour groups and we will certainly go elsewhere."
"Staff, Great - Food, a tad Disappointing","The staff of Lotha, Maria and the team were attentive, super efficient in topping up the food, bringing clean cutlery and plates, serving hot items from the buffet table even though we could have gone to pick it ourselves. I totally love their smiles and care for the elderly folks I was with, and the simple b'day rainbow slice of cake for my godpa.

The hi-tea buffet spread was changed to include festive treats. The fruitcake, ginger star cookies and ""ondeh ondeh"" lamington cake were nice, but too sweet.
I had expected finger sandwiches of cucumber and such - we had smoked salmon square sandwiches (good) and egg mayo truffle (dry & funny looking green bread). The mini quiche looking round disc was brown and did not taste of anything. The chicken pie puff was more pastry (good flaky pastry) - not much filling (what chicken?). The lobster case with a touch of caviar was tasty & rich - the foie gras brioche(?) was nice but not outstanding. The duck roll was good, and the only item that everyone liked came at the end - bread pudding with vanilla sauce - the pudding was not heavy, was tasty, and the sauce was just right!

Having had afternoon hi-tea there a few times before; am a bit disappointed that the food was not up to par, and the offerings very ""normal"". The price was also increased for this ""festive menu"" - which I felt was not worth it.

We had a lovely corner sofa seat with floor to ceiling windows looking out to the bay. It was a perfect spot for a group photo and happy memories for the old folks."
Nice chill out place,This is the place to be at if you need a drink away from the hustle and bustle. The service from Lotha was excellent and she proactively checks on the guest if they require any assistance. Definitely coming back again.
"Slow service, unpleasant experience","Service was poor.

Went today, 11.11.19 at 3pm. We came early compared to many others. The staff didn't have time to check if we will like to order our drinks. Even when we told them we were ready, they kept telling us to wait. By 3.20pm, they asked for our drink order. And we continued to wait. Our high tea set did not arrive. Subsequently those who came much later got their high tea set except for ours. We waited until I raised my voice. They took notice and asked if we are ready for our trays to be served. I was shocked that they actually asked that and made no apologies. If you've forgotten to serve our food, apologise. And don't say that we didn't tell them we are ready for trays to be served. Do you mean we come for high tea for your fresh air? This is not my first visit. All my visits are fantastic except for this. I actually brought my friends to try out this buffet which I love very much. Talking about the Christmas menu, I've to say that it pales in comparison to last year's Christmas high tea menu. What's a high tea menu without chocolate? And when we asked for it, they kindly told us that they can bring some vegan chocolate menu for us. Huh? Does non-vegan menu not include any chocolates? Saving on budget? This Christmas menu isn't cheap. I'll suggest those who like a celebration this year, do not come to Landing point. They probably didn't have the manpower to allow you a pleasant high tea in a grand setting."
Good place for high tea with girlfriends!,"Came here for a high tea with friends to celebrate a friend‚Äôs bachelorette. Lovely views over MBS, a wonderful high tea set (refillable! plus a mini buffet of scones & mini savoury pastries) and free flow tea/coffee! Ambience was quite lovely too with plush & comfortable seating.

The staff were all very kind and welcoming as well, especially Ms Lotha. We came at 3pm and stayed quite late almost till 7pm, and the staff never once rushed us. Service was attentive and friendly.

This is a great place to spend an afternoon. I would recommend sitting inside as it is cooler with the aircon. To me, I felt it was quite value for money given that the food and drinks were refillable / free flow. Service was also really helpful and cheery - definitely appreciated that!

Thank you for a lovely time!"
Great servyce,Enjoyed the afternoon tea with great views. Thank you to Lotha for making my birthday a special one.
Excellent vegetarian high tea and service,Amazing high tea along with an outstanding view of the marina.. and lovely service by Ms lotha and another gentleman whose name i cant recall.. it was a truly memorable experience...
Great experience,"We had a wonderful tea. The food was amazing. The waiting staff was very attentive to our needs, especially Lotha, who was very helpful and friendly"
Very disappointed !!,"My wife and I were looking forward to our ""Sundown Soiree"" at The Landing Point.
On arrival our hostess asked if we would like to sit outside as there was a somewhat vocal group from Deutsche Bank who were making their presence felt inside.
We felt that we had no choice but to take the offered outside table.
Outside it was so dark that we couldn't see what we were eating and so hot that the food was badly affected.
The sandwiches were curling up and the chocolate was a mess.
Our table was placed in a busy thoroughfare, there were groups passing through constantly so no atmosphere at all.
SGD$113.00 for inedible food is not acceptable and it was so dark that I couldn't even read the bill.
Singapore has many great restaurants but this is not one of them.
Don't believe everything you read in ""Lonely Planet"", this place definitely does not serve Singapore's best high tea."
Vegetarian High Tea,"Was at the Landing Point today for High Tea with a friend. There are not many places that serve a good vegetarian high tea, so was pleasantly surprised at the spread prepared for me. Was served by Lotha a lovely wait staff who was diligent to ensure that she got my dietary restriction correct. Lotha has a natural personable nature, she was warm and attentive and ensured that we were well taken care off. Thank you Lotha for your excellent service."
Rooftop restaurant what a view!,"Rooftop restaurant, amazing views, expensive food but good quality .Service was slow and it wasn‚Äôt very busy !"
Birthday high tea,Lovely high tea with my hubby. Picturesque view of MBS and the bay. Well taken care by Ms Lotha with her attentive service :) Complimentary slice of rainbow birthday cake was indeed a nice gesture Cheers
Hightea with friends,"Came here for a hightea session with 3 other friends and we were all very satisfied with the service and food here. The staff, Kumar, especially was very attentive and would take note of our needs when serving us. He would also make small conversation that makes us feel welcomed and not intruded. Great ambience and service."
High tea,"Cosy ambience ; friendly service staff especially Lotha who never fail to refill our glasses.

Surprise with the food refills. Love the yummy cream cheese with pistachio in mini tartlet & refreshing raspberry madeleine with yuzu jelly.

Boston lobster cornet n white truffle egg mayo just as yummy"
High Tea,"Our first time in Singapore so I decided to take my wife to experience high tea at a five star hotel. To our disappointment we really had zero service . We arrived one hour before service so we made a reservation at that time. We arrived five minutes before 3 and was told that other guests made reservations earlier and we were not able to be seated in the lounge but rather across from the lounge by the corridor. We understood and said it was fine . However after 15 minutes no one approached us to place our settings so I had to walk over and ask did you forget about us? She responded no and ten minutes later the settings arrived, in that time frame we were trying to flag hotel staff down but we seemed to be invisible. The settings arrived and we promptly placed our order. Again after 10 minutes plus of waiting the tier arrived. We sat there again for ten minutes and I had to walk over and ask is this supposed to be high TEA because our tea hasn‚Äôt arrived , she responded it‚Äôs on it‚Äôs way. Another five minutes of waiting she drops the tea off and hastily but I had to grab her and ask don‚Äôt you have cups? It‚Äôs seems like quite a nightmare and we should‚Äôve just walked but my wife says we‚Äôve waited so long and see how all of this plays out. The teas were really good but the food was half edible because it seems the food was made in the morning or days before because the greens were limp and the bread was hard . I simply feel for a 5 star establishment they should be really ashamed of themselves for not providing service that the hotel is known for. I‚Äôm terribly upset that we were treated very very badly and I definitely would not to have any of my friends and family to ever visit or stay at The Fullerton Bay hotel , it may be sour grapes but everything that I‚Äôve posted did happen and we didn‚Äôt antagonize the situation,"
Held Birthday Event here!,"Recently booked the Landing Point for 18th birthday about 2 weeks ago! I really loved the ambience as well as the view, especially in the evening and thus chose this venue to hold the party! Based on the comments from our guests, the food was really delicious (but we had a buffet menu catered to the event, which may not be provided in their usual menu) The staff are also very friendly, as we spoke to Maria a couple of times there, and based on observation they also catered to our guests needs and took care of them well! I would definitely choose to dine here again for the environment and service!

Regarding the birthday cake, it was very delicious! Was a little shocked at how large it was because I did not instruct any specific dimensions but it was a pleasant surprise :) The desserts were also amazing, think the guests would have finished them if they had any room left in their stomachs. And the chefs had altered the menu and colours of their usual desserts to match with our theme, which I appreciated a lot as well!

The pianist also played for us which we are also very thankful for and it really enhanced the restaurant's ambience with the night view of the city skyline.

Also, I would like to recommend Nicholas Leong, who is one of the banquet managers at the hotel! We actually had no idea he would be helping out by overlooking the event, but we are extremely thankful that he did. He was extremely helpful throughout the entire process, as he was very efficient in ensuring that everything was going smoothly and had a lot of experience. I am very grateful for how the party went, as he also took special care of our guests and helped me out with any queries or concerns that I had. I was able to fully enjoy the party and so did our guests, because of his great service. We are very thankful for his cheerful and helpful attitude which took the stress off our shoulders in managing the event. Please look for him if you ever feel like hosting an event here! :)"
