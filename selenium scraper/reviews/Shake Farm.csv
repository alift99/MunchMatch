"Excelent experience, amazing food, fair price and friendly staff! Highly recommend! The Farm Shake is a rare gem!","The Shake Farm is a good place to have breakfast, brunch, lunch, early dinner or happy hour!
Very good and Healthy food. The staff is very friendly and greet us with an smile and “welcome” all the way from the door until our table.

The shake farm is rare gem that should be valued in Singapore! One in one million, since here is quite common to find restaurants with expensive food with average to poor quality and rude service wich many times make the costumer regreats to leave the residence."
"Healthy and delicious, with vegan options","They have delicious bowls, be careful with the add ons, there are too many nice ones, we can add too much food. I got veganlicious with cauliflowers bites, walnut pesto, roasted coconut, creamy garlic mushroom. The double choco keta shate was also great. My wife said that they reinvented the tuna sandwich."
Poor experience and will never come back,Very poor and bad service. Waited more than 40 minutes for our order just to find out they have forgotten. Food blend… coffee lukewarm…. have to ask for cutlery etc… Cannot recommend sorry
Do not order from this restaurant!,"Terrible service. Order never came, when rang return said it was out for delivery but would be over an hour. Said call if the food was cold...... of course it’s cold ordered it 3 hours ago. Do not order from here"
Big bowl !,"The choices are plenty . Suitable for all diet types, vegan, gluten free, keto . I went for the all day breakfast bowl that had smoke salmon in it. Healthy and tasty at the same time. But be warned, potions are huge . Good for guys who hit the gym often. I am average sized eater. Two ladies could possibly share 1 bowl."
Lots of Vegetarian & Vegan Options,"We recently visited Shake Farm Robinson Road outlet to check out their new menu. They have added a lot of really delicious new protein bowls and you can now build your own Amazebowl (BYO acai bowl, chia bowl, yoghurt bowl etc)

We loved the Sumo Bowl and the Impossibowl (vegan meatballs and rainbow zoodles)

Highly recommended if you are looking for healthy and delicious food which is not over priced."
Incredible breakfast or lunch,Incredible breakfast or lunch spot with great vibe and good staff! Will definitely e going back for more!
Always delicious and healthy,Always delicious and healthy options there. Suits vegan and vegetarian One of my favorite place for lunch
Good açai bowl! Quantity keeps reducing in every visit,Açai super bowls and shakes are amazing and fresh. I visit almost thrice a week to the Telok Ayer or Robinson road. The quantity of açai bowl is just vague. Apparently the Robinson road has stopped 2 sizes of the bowl after the renovation and provides only one which is apparently the large one. I have been having the super bowl for a few months now and the large bowl definitely is not the quantity to be called large. It’s just vague and keeps reducing while the price is still at the same level. 13 dollars for that quantity is mere loot.
Great food.,We had a really good meal here and visited for lunch. The Perfect Pesto Salad with chicken here was excellent and the staff was friendly. The pricing wasn’t really high considering the location. Will definitely return to this place.
Worth a trippy trip!!,"So glad to give this place a shot! Most marvellous place to makan, chill and chitchat! Definitely going to return with good friends to yabber with and sip wine!"
"Excellent! Food, Service and adaptability.",The Owner personally supervised our meal as we have numerous allergy issues. It is normally a real problem finding food we can eat. Shake Farm delivered great tasting and healthy food with ease. We were very impressed with the entire eating and drinking experience.
Expensive healthy food,Food was definitely healthy and makes you feel good after eating. However the portions are quite small and really expensive
Healthy Burgers & Cheap Beer,"We visited Shake Farm 4 times during our trip to Singapore. Each time we tried something new and was impressed everytime.

They are running a promotion for just $6 for a pint of Pure Blonde Ultra Low Carb beer all day and night.

The build your own Better-For-You burgers werd great just a bit slow to be served but it was busy so understandable.

The Grandma's Roast and the Perfect Pesto Salad are also highly recommended.

The second floor is really nice to relax or outside they have a nice seating area."
The best healthy food in Singapore,"We have been looking for super tasty and healthy food in Singapore all week and Shake Farm was by far the best. We built our own Better-For-You healthy burger and built our own protein bowl and we were very impressed with the food, service and the overall experience was 10/10,"
ShakeFarm HQ - A Hub for Wellbeing,"I love ShakeFarm HQ! The menu is full of delicious, healthy options, the organic wine is well-priced annnd there is kombucha on tap!

On Jan 31/2020 I met friends there for dinner on the 1st floor, attended a figure drawing meetup organized by the Singapore International Artist Collective on the 3rd floor, and then enjoyed dessert and wine with friends on the 2nd floor. It was a perfect night at a wonderful place!"
Super Great Venue,"We needed a place to do our company event, and Shake Farm was the perfect place to do it. Super central, booking was super easy, and Mia was super amazing at getting everything sorted and making sure we had everything right. Thanks to Lucas as well who looked after us as well on the day. The canapés were amazing, and looked more like it was a feeding of 5000, than a small event. Due to the building’s heritage status, theres a lot of stairs but the interior is super gorgeous so it’s worth it."
Great Event Planners,"What a wonderful experience it was to host our client appreciation event at Shake Farm. The team provided great service and support. The food was very good and everything went smoothly and promptly. Thanks very much Shake Farm! We will definitely host other events with you again.

In the meantime, i will continue to enjoy lunching over there (love the DIY bowls) when I can =)"
Shakefarm event space is awesome,"We hosted our class reunion at Shakefarm. The food, decoration and IT parts were all taken care of so it was hussle free. They had great facilities and the staff were friendly and provided good service, going beyond their job scope to provide the best event space for us."
"Cosy, Great Service","Held a private event at Shake Farm HQ and the space was just perfect for the crowd we had! A very cosy, relaxed environment and all the amenities we needed for the event were available and provided as well! Mia was extremely helpful with the coordination and Lucas was very warm and always ready to assist on the day itself. Everything turned out as planned and I am truly happy that I chose Shake Farm to hold my private event. Well done to the Shake Farm Team!"
Great place for a nice quiet meal!,"Love the ambience of this restaurant and the service was great! We went of christmas and some of the dishes were not available. Nevertheless, good service and food. Food abit pricey but still enjoyed the food !"
Back for another shake,"Returned here for a shake after lunch. Made use of the Burpple app so the pricing was ok, but a bit expensive if you had to pay full price."
Best salad I’ve ever had!,This place has a great vibe and delicious salads! Try the green goodness with salmon.. I think it’s the best salad I have had in my life :)
Excellent service,"Held a gathering at Shake Farm recently. Found the place v conducive, allowing all to mingle and connect in a relaxed manner. Food was excellent. Mia was superb, her turnaround time is amazing, v much on the ball. Staff who served us that night were extremely helpful, yet not intrusive. Was pleasantly surprised, the owner Danny came to check on things. The boss down to all operational staff were v. friendly and definitely service-oriented. Place highly recommended. Thank you, Shake Farm and Mia as all of us had a great time that night!"
Funky and Healthy,"Danny and Mia and Farmhands. Well done guys, Came here everyday for the week we were in Singapore. Brilliant food, amazing concept and great service. Congratulations Farmhands see you all again soon Open a store in Melbourne Australia please."
Fantastic healthy options plus plenty of gluten free and dairy free options,I came to Singapore for a holiday with my partner. I have an autoimmune condition as well as being a celiac (gluten free) and dairy intolerant (I have the trifecta!!!) we scoured the internet for healthy options in Singapore and found Shake Farm. Both my partner and I were thrilled with the food and drinks offering. So many options for me with my diet limitations and heeaaaapppps of healthy options for my partner. The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming. We also happened to meet the owner - lovely guy! I commend him on his offering in Singapore. We are spoilt in Australia with our food and health and wellness options...Shake Farm allowed me to eat safely and enjoy my food. Well done. Definitely worth a visit.
Awesome experience that will convert you to be a vegan,"Mia and her team did an amazing job. Excellent service The food was fun, creative and tasty (much to our surprised) Venue was convenient and easy to find Highly recommend anybody who wants to try being a vegan and eating healthy"
Awesome !,"Thanks to Mia and the team. The ambience and food was fantastic . The food choices were fun, creative and very reasonable . ( not to mention nutritious ) Service was good and the follow up was great Must try the broccoli and tofu!"
"Unique, friendly and buzzing environment!","After walking past Shake Farm HQ many times and seeing people queuing out the door- I decided to see what all the fuss was about today. I have to say I was suitably impressed! The staff were friendly and welcoming and the service was quick. I chose a ‘build your own bowl’ which was full of good quality, healthy ingredients and the portion was so generous that I couldn’t quite finish it all. I also liked their no plastic ethos with glass bottles and paper straws. A great find and I’ll most definitely be back!"
Honey we Shrunk the Servings,"Hitchikers guide to the Galaxy ""End of Universe cafe"" meets indoor crazy golf venue decor gives somewhat unusual ambience, Customers primarily Instagram addicted accountants from CBD and muscle t shirt protein punch exhibitionists. Order at counter with table delivery.
.....So far no different from a number of misguided Hipster wannabe hangouts in Singapore:
Menu is usual selection of avocado with everything, Kale , anti oxidants and green and fruit mixed smoothies with veggie biased food menu. Offerings are mainly breakfast/snack/brunch staples. However punchline is portions are miniscule in size - avo toast I ordered was approx 8x 4 cm ( yes cm not inches). Taste nothing special. Avoid unless you like thimble sized smoothies and canope sized mains.Will return to buy some of the unusual shop fittings when it closes down."
"Hearty Salads, Hit-and-Miss service","Hearty salads (recommend them beefy brothers) and pretty good açai bowl. There was a really helpful male Malay service staff who was helpful when we went at lunch on 4 Dec (Mon). However, the female cashier was quite rude when taking our orders which kinda dampened our mood. Not sure why we could only redeem 1 Burpple offer even though we came in a group of 6. This is not in line with Burpple Beyond T&Cs. So just FYI. 2nd floor is air conditioned and more chill."
Could be so much better....,"I won't be surprised to hear if this place has shut down the next time I come. It is right on trend but if the poor service and general attutide doesn't improve, people won't come back. I mean who serves a meal with out a drink? Or 25 minutes late for what looks like something you would feed to the dog? The over all concept is clever, but it is lacking core competencies of polite efficient staff and good food."
Fantastic place. Cool concept,Fantastic place. Cool concept and excellent food. Very healthy but extremely tasty. Service also great. Well worth going to
UOB workplace banking,"Had planned for a gathering for the business segment to unwind and relax with a simple art festival where a mini competition was held internally. Really glad the host wasn’t particularly strict with what we can do within the venue, especially when painting is involved. :)

The location is perfectly centralised, with less than a 2 mins distance upon arrival at the nearest Downtown MRT line.

The venue is aesthetically on point and if you are looking for a conducive, photogenic and cosy environment, would recommend giving this place a go.

The food choices is incredibly health concisely prepared and catered. Based on my personal observations If you’re looking for a place to meet a gym partner or a health enthusiast, I reckon this is the place to hang. They host are really nice people too.

So out of 10, I would give it a 9. :)

Shout out to Mia for being an awesome host!"
"Expensive, slow, forgot items","Have eaten here twice, once was a fair while ago and it was good and cheap. Sadly prices have gone up a lot.

As with many of the build your own salad places, they have three sizes, but are more expensive than any other. I think it was 15 dollars for a medium and a large was 19.90. They then add service on top of those prices which we didn't realise, meaning it was S$22 for a ""large"" salad!

The food took well over half an hour to arrive during lunchtime which is extremely slow compared to any other salad joint. And to cap it off they missed items from BOTH of the two build your own salads we ordered. How hard can it be to follow the ticked list?

We won't be returning, you can get food which is just as good for a significantly lower price, wait way less time and actually receive what you order from many of the other salad places - e.g. Super Simple, Daily Cut, Autobus etc, all of which are c.15 dollars for a large salad, not 22."
Nice Cocktails!,Went here for a short break during our weekends getaway. They have outdoor and indoor seating. All food and drinks are supposed to be healthy. I tried their sake-coconut cocktail which is unexpectedly superb!
Superb team + great food = excellent event!,"I worked with Mia at Shake Farm to organise an event for my University Alumni to get together in Singapore to network over some food and drinks.
The first floor was the perfect private space for a short presentation and for the guests to mingle and get to know each other.
The canape selection was delicious and healthy coupled with a choice of wines and craft beer.
I've hosted events in other locations in CBD and often the acoustics are terrible and people struggle to hear each other, this was not a problem at Shake Farm.
It was great to work with the venue that's unusual from the standard choices in CBD. The staff took good care of us and made sure that we had everything we needed.
I look forward to hosing other events there I can highly recommend it for you too!"
"Yum, yum, yum!","So impressed with the delicious food and fantastic service, good luck getting a seat though - such a great place 👏🏼"
Healthy and good food,Love this place. Food was healthy and delicious. Was impressed by the service and the floor manager on checking on us and finding seats for anyone coming in. Will come again for sure.
LOVE IT!!,Omg! This is my first time trying out vegan and keto friendly protein bowl ! I definitely love it! And also it’s my first time customizing a protein bowl .. and i love it ! For the ambience there i love it .. it’s a cute cool place .. with cute and friendly waiters and waitresses.. even the chair .. and also the deco of the cafe .. i have my brunch on 2nd floor .. where it’s a more comfortable dine in area than 1 st floor .. and they provide free infused water too ❤️❤️
Good shakes but not a bargain,"I came here last month for one of the shakes after lunch. The place is certainly very popular, considering you're paying $10 or more for a shake. I'd say good rather than exceptional. The food does look interesting - maybe that's better value for money."
"Epic shakes, food is amazing.","Came here with the mrs and we were blown away buy how good this place is. Thank you so much. Felt like home, great clean place with amazing food and staff. Thanks guys"
Excellent Fresh Food,"Was at Shake Farm for the Ceroc dance night and enjoyed an excellent salad bowl. Full with lots of great fresh ingredients! The place has a great vibe, will most definitely be back."
healthy food and drinks! super friendly stuff!,"SHAKE FARM is where you can enjoy all kinds of healthy food starting with Acai bowl, Protein bowl, Avocado toast, Vege pizza and more! This is place I always hung out with my friends because of their food, drinks and cozy atmosphere! Their stuff are always very friendly and looking happy too. Happy place to be in Singapore."
"Great vibes, great food, great service!","What a fabulous find in Singapore! Love their concept of wellness via what you eat, what you do, and what you think. Felt healthy just being there. Super chilled and fun vibes with how they've done up the place, especially the lounge on the second floor. Food and drinks were absolutely delicious! And so happy to see paper straws being used instead of plastic! Friendly and helpful staff also added to a fantastic experience at Shake Farm! Will definitely be going back."
Ceroc night at shake farm,Tonight is our trial night for the studio at 3rd floor for our ceroc class night .I have always love this place especially the acai bowl is my favourite the vibes atmosphere locations the service the dance floor (studio ) was perfect everyone love it especially the foods is super delicious

Sunday lunch,Great healthy shake and Mexican salad! Friend had a fruity drink that tasted fantastic! planning to come back for the gin and tonics
Excellent little place for healthy food and drinks,"Had lunch here with a friend on Sunday. Their selection of food is great, healthy options and original dishes. Great place for an organic Gin & Tonic in the evenings as well.

Staff is lovely and always up for a chat and a laugh.

Highly recommended for lunch!"
"Healthy hearty brunch, awesome environment","Changed upon this place on eatigo app so dropped by for brunch and coffee with a friend after pole dance class. Absolutely loveeeee the weekend brunch menu. We had the steak & mash and big breakfast set, mocha muscle and açai awesome. Our plate was overflowing with food and the variety was great! Shake was super yummy and we’ll definitely be back for more! :)"
Awesome food and shake,Tasty and guilt free food and drinks. Will definitely come back again Try their big breakfast for variety and good quality ingredients!
Great food served with a smile,"I am a solo traveller and visited Shake Farm through Trip Advisor recommendations and I could not be more pleased with the experience I received. The Grandma’s roast reminded me of true home comforts, a rarity whilst backpacking! The staff were also gave top service at an efficient rate that I haven’t really discovered yet in Singapore!... Shake Farm is a true gem, please come to the UK!

Many thanks team,

Grace"
Super fresh and tasty!,"We walked down the street and the cool vibe of Shake Farm immediately caught our attention. Healthy food and cocktails - we couldn't resist and were not disappointed! I can definitely recommend the super fresh Acai bowls. Accompanied with great music and friendly staff, this is the place to be for a great night out."
The best healthy food I’ve had,"I don’t usually enjoy healthy food, until we visited Shake Farm recently. The protein bowls are the best I’ve had - full of super tasty and perfectly cooked meats and vegetables and the shakes are very tasty and refreshing.

I had the Grandma’s Roast and Summer Slimmer and loved it.

My friend had the Veganlicious which she had was delicious and surprised how good it is for a vegan dish.

The coffee was also great.

10/10"
Awesome Shakes and can accommodate groups,"Great drinks, snacks and tunes all at an affordable price. And staff were really helpful and put up with our ridiculous order. Would recommend."
Healthy food that actually tastes good!,10/10 food and drinks 10/10 service 😍🙌👌 highly recommend this restaurant for your health fix. Friendly and helpful staff
Sooo yummy!,"Very tasty shakes, definitely try the protein ones they have so much flavour! Super friendly service and fun interior design. I'm very glad we stumbled across this cute place!"
Absolutely awesome,We came in with a big group and the staff were more than happy to accomodate. Great food & tasty smoothies!! And super cute restaurant vibe
Healthy shakes and delicious food!,great range of acai and protein bowls. Flat white was really well made :) Would recommend 10/10. Danny and Jermaine were really great hosts too! Really cosy vibes with beautiful aesthetics within the area makes for an unforgettable experience! Do yourself a favour and visit this place!!!
Healthy Food & Brunch,This was such a great find! We found ourselves in the perfect place for healthy food in Singapore - great options that all sounded delicious! We tried the Summer Slimmer and the Early Energiser shakes which were really refreshing in the hot weather. My friends had the SF Big Breakfast from the brunch menu and a ‘Perfect Pesto Salad’ with super tasty chicken which was delicious and guilt free! We had to wait a little while to order but it was well worth the wait. And the coffee was lovely too! Highly recommend!!!!
Great place to chill!!,Went to shake farm HQ on a Sunday. Vibrant place with great ambience and atmosphere. Friendly staff. Food looks and tastes great. Sells many flavours of kombucha. Excellent!!
AMAZING FOOD,"Love a healthy salad and IMO this cafe on Telok Ayer is Singapore’s best new healthy food spot. Had a fantastic salad for $15. Shake Farm absolutely nailed it. Even though the line was out the door when I arrived, my lunch arrived super quickly, and was delicious. Protein smoothie was on point , even though I had to take it away as my salad was a decent size .. Definitely coming back! Top spot"
Easily my favourite spot in the CBD,Great food great service!!! There is no trade of between taste and the healthy food served... love love love this spot #sofeshandsoclean 👌👌👌🔥
Super yummy and healthy,"Without doubt one of the best brunch restaurants I have been to and gone there two days in a rown now. (As a brunch enthusiast I have been to many different brunch places...) very fresh and perfectly prepared. Really love their super bowl with toastedcoconut, chiaseeds, toasted oats and seeds and acaiberrysorbet. Highly recommend this place!"
Great option for healthy food and organic gin,A really great option for healthy food in the CBD! Very wide variety to choose from and don't miss out on their organic gin cocktails which are apparently hangover free ;)
Great Choice for Healthy Food in Singapore,"High quality healthy food in a convenient location in the heart of Singapore's CBD. I am a frequent patron of this restaurant and they never disappoint. It is also located in a very cool space with a super comfy second level that is available to those who choose to dine in. Lots of great breakfast choices as well and of course there are shakes too, which are awesome"
The BEST place in Singapore,"We spotted this gem whilst walking to another cafe in Singapore and we were so happy to find it. The food here was absolutely delicious and the service was fantastic. We decided to build our own bowls and after having one, we went there again for lunch the next day. The bowls have so many options and there’s also a great range of shakes you can have. We’re so glad we spotted this place. A MUST VISIT IF YOU’RE IN SINGAPORE! Will definitely recommend and go back when next visiting."
Amazing Healthy Organic,"Was so happy to come across Shake Farm, and its incredible menu. So many healthy options. It was exactly what I have been looking for, as I traveled through Singapore on a short vacation. Have been back multiple times, as there were several healthy bowls I wanted to try. Super central to everything, it was a great dining experience. Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys a healthy breaky, lunch or dinner alternative. Side note, Shake Farms organic wines are also very “on-point.”"
Health is wealth,"I’m glad that there are more healthy food place in SG, not only that I didn’t know that organic wine taste that great! Thanks to ShakeFarm for introducing me to my new drink.
However, It was kinda busy that day so I totally understand the rush. Keep it up and would love to try more of your products."
Delicious food and yoga classes,Healthy and delicious food in a super central part of town. Staff are super friendly and helpful. They also host a yoga class every few weeks at their studio upstairs with food and a smoothie after.
Lunch,Food is tasty and healthy. We found somewhere to sit pretty easily (quite a bit of seating upstairs)... and the staff are great. I want to check it out in the evening too... their drinks offers sound pretty fun!
An Amazing Find!,We were staying in Singapore for a few days before visiting Thailand. We found Shake Farm after reading the reviews and we were not disappointed!! Loved the healthy food and shakes. We actually went there every morning of our stay as it was a great way to start the days sightseeing. Great food and excellent friendly service. They have lots going on in the evenings I understand as well as yoga classes in the daytime in their spacious upstairs venue. Loved it and will definitely return in our next visit.
Awesome wholesome food!,"Favourite go to place for quick bites, lunch and weekend brunch! Absolutely love the presentation and colours on my plate whenever I order a beetroot hummus toast salad, pita pockets or Super toasts! And most importantly it tasted awesome as well. Kept my tummy full yet not bloated. Summer slimmer shake is the way to go!!!"
new food heights,"Friendly fast service by extremely helpful and pleasant staff.
Food simply superb. Fresh healthy and attractively served. Original and creative menu.
A whole new eating experience. Wonderful value for money.
The kind of restaurant where you can eat every day and still find something new.
Very competitive pricing too."
Good option for delicious healthy food,Good variety from salads to shakes; freshly made and delicious! Easily the go-to place for anything healthy and tasty.
Amazing food!,"Really high quality, healthy food & incredible service with a smile. Popped in for a bite after the gym and was surprised to see a menu with so much on it!! 10/10, Would recommend."
Beautiful healthy goodness,My new favourite stop for health and goodness. Fresh ingredients and an all round great experience. The food is well thought out and prepared. Came off the back of a recommendation absolute love it!
My new favourite,So delicious and nutritious!! All meals prepared with the freshest ingredients and good portions. I think this might be my new favourite :)
Delicious Clean Eating.,"Shake Farm combines good, healthy, clean eating with delicious like nowhere else in singapore. The food is fresh, organic un processed but also tasty and fun. The staff are amicable and fun and this translates to good food and service. I went on a Friday in the early evening after heavy work out and decided to have a couple of drinks after my meal.
A) it was Friday
B) they had a happy hour.

It turns out they serve loads of organic drinks, even spirits. So for someone health conscious like I am this was perfect.

I drank several organic Gin and Low calorie tonic based cocktails (total calories < 100) and met a bunch of cool people while doing it. The craziest bit about all of this is that I woke up with no hangover

My new favourite spot in Singapore without a shadow of doubt! ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
What a disappointment,"This place was across the road from our hotel & we thought it looked like a good place to have our breakfast. I wished we hadn’t bothered. We should have walked out when it seemed like we were being pushed into ordering a salad for breakfast by the very offhand waitress but this kind of set the tone for our whole Shake Farm experience. After being told any overnight oat based items weren’t available on Mondays we ordered 2 shakes,which to be fair were nice if a little overpriced, banana & peanut butter on toast (my daughter had to ask for an extra slice as you only get one I think) and an Americano which was nice too but I had to remind the staff to actually make it. So, 4 things ordered 1 almost didn’t arrive without a prompt & offhand staff. This place had the the potential to be so good but I’m sure there are better places to try first which is a shame."
Cool and awesome chill place,"The place is like really cool and its a place to chill with ur friend, family and someone special to u and they have an awesome healthy and fresh foods, the foods can go well with the music, great vibes, love the place so much, next i will come with my friends"
Good vibes!,Shake Farm is definitely the place to be compared to the other cafes I've been in selling super awesome shakes and one of the best coffee I've ever tasted. Golden milk was super bangin! The staff was all so friendly and welcoming. Good music. Good ambience. Overall good vibes. A place to be! I would definitely come back again for more!!
great space & love the healthy menu options,protein bars& shakes & kombucha & beer & cider & healthy food & comfort food right in the zone of telok ayer
Awesome venue & food!!,"I have had a number of meetings at Shake Farm and it certainly is an ideal space!

Little do most know that shake farm has a cozy level 2 So wether your in for a quick bite - or on a date, this health focused location with hit all your buttons

The chicken salad was mind blowing and to top it off, I topped up with a Summer Slimmer.
Felt the goodness flowing for days!"
Best lunch I’ve had in SG,"Really great food, affordable, central, and amazing service. They even do cocktails at night! Highly recommend."
Tasty and f@$&,Amazing food and great service. The owner was very polite and helped me on my choices when I told him my healthy eating plan with the cheeky organic cocktails. I’m a regular now and love it. Would recommend to anyone. Do miss the disco ball hanging from the ceiling wonder where it’s gone.
MMMMM,Amazing food and fantastic shakes. Just what I need after a heavy night out would recommend to anyone looking for healthy tasty food!
great place to eat and drink healthy food,a real buzzy environment with top quality food and drink the staff are exceptional nothing was too much trouble wish we had longer to sample the whole menu we will be back
Great Organic Juices,"Good, if slightly quirky, menu. Great juices. Quite a hip place. Good selection of organic bars and brekky items to buy. Worth going back to test all the flavour combinations"
Healthy Gem!!,We love this place - fabulous healthy food - great cocktails and very welcoming staff. We’ve had 3 meals there this week!! Great menu including the option to make your own healthy bowl from an awesome selection - Definitely worth a visit!!
Another level of delicious!!!,"Totally a must visit! So many yummy options - the menu is so varied there is something perfect for all tastes. Visiting Singapore for the week and this has been a favourite spot so far, hence the several returns... haha! Trust me though, you wouldn’t blame me if you tried it! Fab food and also love the concept of having healthy cocktails- not something that I’ve seen before but tried a 2 and both amazing! Plus the owner and staff are all lovely, all in all a wonderful place."
Good food with rude service,I’m eaten here often and enjoy the food. Recently the business expanded and the owner seems to have been replaced by an employee who is unhelpful and blatantly rude. A pity. Suggest you avoid this place if you care about service.
Service with a smile,"Delicious food and helpful staff, happily catering for my (many) dietary requirements! Super friendly and well informed staff. Big 👍🏻 from me!"
Amazing food and amazing vibes,Fantastic food as always. Highly recommend the organic prosecco and their brunch menu is 👌Danny always ensures the glass and tummy are full
Delicious healthy cocktails!!,"Came here for drinks after dinner because we wanted something sweet and desserty. Luckily we came across this as it fulfills all our requirements:
- sweet
- dessert in drink form
- healthy

Great cocktail smoothies. Mocktails also available if you don’t feel like drinking!

Chill barny vibes with a fantastic playlist if you’re into hiphop. Dan is a great host, extremely friendly with impeccable customer service.

Friend and family friendly, would recommend."
Great Healthy Options!,"Visited Shake Farm HQ on a Friday night with my friends.

We got the Kombucha-Ha-Ha, Ah-Sah-Ee, Cocumber (mocktail) which was very yummy! Would highly recommend for anyone looking to have a fun time grabbing drinks while staying healthy

I used to live around here so I would come here to grab lunch all the time, and the smoothies and the food are amazing! Definitely worth checking out both daytime and nighttime."
Yummy shakes!,"I came here with my two friends from high school. We had eaten dinner nearby and wanted to get a drink/dessert somewhere nearby. Came across this lovely spot! I got Komucha-ha-ha and my friends had Ah-San-Ee and Cocumber. I would rate my cocktail 8/10 - the flavors were rich but sometimes I could taste the bitterness of the passionfruit too much which didn’t go well with the rest of the ingredients. Maybe pineapple would be a better choice! Apparently the cocktail menu is being renewed in a little while so that sounds promising!

The host was very friendly and attentive to us, checking in every now and then to make sure we were having a good time.

It’s a great place to hang out and grab a casual drink with healthy ingredients!"
