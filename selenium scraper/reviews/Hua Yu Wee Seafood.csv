Good old school Chinese food for highly reasonable prices - just beware of the limited parking..,"This is a very old restaurant but my first visit - I don’t stay in the East so I hardly pass by this place. In fact in the past few times I drove by I didn’t even realise it was a restaurant haha. Obviously, the interior decor is old school.

Not only is it old, it is large! There is a massive outdoor area (I think enough to hold a typical wedding banquet) and a smaller indoor air conditioned part within the villa. The kitchen, which you have to walk by to get to the toilet, is also large.

Today we ate the Chinese new year set menu, but my friends told me their ala carte dishes are fantastic. So my review may be biased as it is based on my observation of the special menu.

Firstly, the dishes come very quickly. Considering the crazy crowd, this speed is pretty impressive. But it could also be because the menus are special so the cooks are just focussing on some dishes the whole evening. (Their business was so good they had three seatings for dinner over the new year).

Secondly, I would grade the quality of food at 7/10 - soup used a very traditional chicken base that is found in the older Chinese restaurants such as Red Star and Manhill; roast chicken was classically Cantonese style; the sauce in the chilli style crayfish was suggestive of a cross between long beach and jumbo chilli sauce; three-floor beancurd was generous and soft enough. We were served unsweetened chrysanthemum tea as default “tea” - which I thought was somewhat strange.

Thirdly, service was surprisingly quite good! Many waitresses were of middle-aged and above but they were steady and helpful. The cashier asked if we had received our (complimentary - what a little surprise!) dessert and then promptly instructed a waiter to serve.

Fourthly, note that parking space is very limited. They provide valet service.

Finally, I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the price - very reasonable considering the number of dishes, the festival set, good service and yet they don’t charge service charge!!

I’ll review again after I try their ala carte food and obtain greater clarity. Further more right now I’m a little confused over their genre - Cantonese, Teochew, zi char, Malaysian, etc."
Do not recommend,"Worst place ever. Service was lousy and we waited for an hour for the first dish to be served. This is despite the fact that we were made to order and confirm the set menu way before. And then the food was suddenly served all at once. The table didn’t even have enough space and the servers just kept trying to fit more plates. We felt pressured to just have them remove the dishes that weren’t even finished just so they could serve the food.
Ridiculous."
"Wonderful seafood, baby-friendly, and helpful staff!","Loved the good quality seafood and friendly service here. Yesterday was our first ever time dining out with our baby while celebrating my wife’s birthday, and it ended up being such a pleasant experience overall. Been here several times and the dishes like chilli crab and drunken prawns are always delicious. If the parking is full the valet is always a friendly option too. Thank you especially to all the helpful staff that made our night!"
Nice seafood restaurant,"This restaurant was personally recommended by a family friend living in the East. We are from the West. We went on a Sat... that was a wrong choice. The restaurant was filled to the max capacity. Suggest you go there on a weekday.

Food generally was good. We ordered salted fish fried rice, you tiou, hot plate, cereal prawns and chilli crab. The hot plate had fresh seafood. The chilli crab was meaty (800g) and tasty with mantou. The cereal prawns was a little disappointment for us as we are not used to their style of cooking of cereal prawns.

They have indoor (air-con) and outdoor seating. Suggest you make booking at least a week in advance. We only got outdoor seating only even booking a week in advance."
A family favourite,"This is one of the family faves, and we used to bring friends from overseas here as well. The chicken is very good, and we order this all the time.

The signature hor fun is also tasty, and has wok hei. We were quite disappointed with the black crispy squid this time, as it was not crispy and my wife said the pieces were not as fresh as usual. The cereal prawns were, on the other hand, super fresh and were the best dish of the night.

Service was, as usual, quick and friendly."
Feng Sha chicken was awesome,"booked 4pm on a subday and we had the restaurant to ourselves. crowd started coming in at 445pm. order butter crab (fried-dried style.7. 5/10, but the crab was alil small-$68), qinglong vege (fragrant and nice) and feng sha chicken (juicy meat and crispy skin - green sauce was awesome 9/10). do note dining time for only 1hr15mins and was kinda chase out in a nice way but still quite upset cus we wanted to order dessert but the staff said need to wait at least half n hour. when we said we could wait (when we were at our 1hr10mins), the staff said but she needed our table alrdy. if we were alerted earlier abt the waiting time for the dessert we could have ordered earlier. but definitely worth coming back for the food. wont expect much for service but guess its cus they would be busy."
Great seafood at this heritage restaurant,"Great food at this heritage seafood restaurant. Very popular with locals and the price is very affordable. The taste were awesome and each dish was well balanced. From their frozen vegetable with sesame sauce, omelette sharks fin with lettuce, yam basket with mango, braised pork with thick soya sauce, drunken prawn and Chili crab was very good tasting. Service was acceptable. For dessert we had the yam with ginkgo nut and ice jelly. Good taste and not too sweet!"
Great food at a great price!,"Bought a black pepper crab, fried baby squid and seafood beehoon for wifey's birthday and the food was amazing! Delectable and fresh! Highly recommended!
Also bought chilli crab for my folks and they loved it!
Looks like the taste has remained the same through the ages! Highly recommended! Simply superb!"
Great Food,Very good food with a very nice old school feel. The dining experience was nice with very friendly set of staff who was happy to explain stuff on their menu.
MSG Infested Chinese Food,"Boy oh boy does the food taste good here! That's because they are using MSG by the bucket load. Wok fried broccoli never tasted so good.

I asked the waiter if MSG was used as usually I dont like the taste of broccoli.

""YES!"" The waiter beamed.

I spent the next four hours with my head in a bucket of ice cold water trying to quench my thirst.

A great restaurant for MSG addicts."
Good. Solid Chinese Cooking and friendly wait staff,"Located in an old bungalow house in Katong area, is Hua Yu Wee - an F&B and entertaining institution back in the days of 1950's & 60's.

Now, Hua Yu Wee is known for its solid Chinese cooking. We had a family dinner at Hua Yu Wee early in February. As expected the restaurant was full, but indoor and outdoor sitting areas.

The food we ordered (set menu for the New Year period) was your usual festive dishes. Food presentation was simple, but the flavours of the food the chefs brought out was spectacular. The roast chicken was crispy on the outside, yet succulent and tender on the inside. Even the the sauteed broccoli was enticing enough for our carnivorous diners.

Service was spotty - which I suspect is because of the lack of service staff that has not returned from China, but those that we encountered, was friendly, calm and pleasant.

Overall, although Hua Yu Wee isn't your typical, well dressed and modern outlet, it was certainly a dining experience that brought back great memories of ""Old SIngapore"" dining scene that I enjoyed as a child. Although this was my first visit, I'm sure it wouldn't be my last.

For diners who long to experience dining in a ""old Singapore"" style, you should try Hwa Yu Wee out."
The most authentic chili crab experience in Singapore,"If you want chili crab, excellent seafood and other staples of Chinese-Singaporean traditions, look no further than Hua Yu Wee. This is where locals go for their chili crab fix."
Happy again,"We try to come here every year. A lively restaurant with good service. Fantastic crabs, very fresh. What a pleasant experience! We will come again and again. Thank you!"
Excellent food and service,"Great taste, great quality and fresh seafood, great service, and reasonable pricing definitely will come back :)"
An enjoyable step back in time,"@TheKuoKnows

Expect to pay about a-third less than some of the other much-hyped, heavily-advertised seafood restaurants. But expect the same, if not better quality.

The Chili Crab is reminiscent of the traditional version that was available in the 60s. Less sweet and lots more punch.

The Marbled Goby was perfectly steamed the Hong Kong way. And the Roast Chicken was crispy on the outside and still succulent on the inside.

The service throughout was impeccable. The food arrived steadily rather hurried from the kitchen. The plates were cleared regularly and the tea was constantly topped up.

I love this place to bits."
Delicious seafood on East Coast road,Blink and you’ll miss it. The restaurant is located in an old house along East Coast road. Fresh black pepper crab. Just don’t expect the staff to Deshell it for you! Their seafood Hor Fun is good too as they add some mysterious crispy ingredients at the top. I also like their Cheng ting because it comes with a unique jelly.
Great food!,"You will get great food with reasonable priced seafood and other dishes here, no tourist price tags.mostly locals too! I used to frequent this place in the 80s as a kid and coming back here brought found memories. We tried the black pepper crab, sambal kang Kong, olive fried rice (delicious), a soup, drunken prawns, a coke and a lime juice for $130 or so."
Superb Seafood in the Suburbs,"Tucked way out in the suburbs but very close to the Airport - this place is an absolute find. Inside and outside seating areas and friendly staff make for a great welcoming experience.

The menu is focussed on seafood but there are heaps of other protein and vegetable choices too.

The black pepper lobsters are rich and spicy, the chilli crab is as good as anywhere and the roasted crispy skin chicken is sensational. The fried fish skin is a must.

The beer is cold and the prices are very reasonable.

When you are sick of the city buzz, escape here for a couple of hours and all will be well with the world."
Revisit After 40 Odd Years,"The place was a 'buzzing' on a weekday and the food has not changed much. Service still very good. Before there were only locals, but now, I see a few westerners enjoying the good food and am glad as their faces shown delight at every bite.
The family decided to revisit this place and we were not disappointed after so many years."
Kinda disappointing,"Went there for dinner last night after many years. The place was packed in spite of the rain. Had the Feng Sha chicken which was quite good but everything else was pretty average. We had the black pepper crab and streamed crabs. Disappointing. They were small and over priced, with 2 crabs costing $136 pre tax. Meat quality was so-so. Better off going to Keng Eng Kee or Long Ji! Unlikely to come back."
Great restaurant with reasonable price,"One of my friends invited me and my wife to this restaurant, catered mainly for Singaporeans. It looked unassuming but the food was great. My friend ordered three big crabs cooked in different styles: chilli, black peppered and buttered. All Crabs were sumptuous. Deep fried chicken was delicious with crispy skin and juicy meat. Actually every dish was so delicious that our group finished it nearly instantly.
When the bill came, my friend asked me to guess how much.
It was pleasantly cheap considering all the great dishes we devoured.
One caution, though, is that you have to make reservation well in advance. The place was packed with lots of customers, mostly Singaporeans."
Dinner,"Had dinner with cousins. Sat upstairs to keep cool. Ordered pepper crabs, fried squid, and was introduced to a new vegetable. It was spinach on a bed of ice. Very crunchy and fresh. The crabs were dilicious and cooked to perfection..The hostess was Angela.The best seafood restaurant in the East coast."
One of the best,"Whenever I have visitors in town this is the go to for seafood namely chili, pepper or steam crab.

The average price is about s$70 a kilo for the crabs. If you want the jumbo crabs (each weighing 1.5 kilos), reservation is a must. You must order a whole crab for each type of cooking style. If you have a big group that’s fine but if traveling in a small group (4 people), difficult to finish 3 crabs at the table.

Very popular place with locals n visitors, food is reasonable and good, average service when it’s crowded.

If you want an aircon place, reservations is necessary. If not there is a huge outdoor dining space.

Nothing to fault except the toilets could be better."
Fantastic evening event!,"This is a wonderful place for a group dinner. The staff treat you like family. Portions are huge and everything was fantastic. We had pepper crab, chili crab, roast duck, roast chicken, pepper prawns, chili green vegetables, and much more! The crab was some of the best I’ve had. And the pepper prawns were a big hit."
Fabulous local foodie place,"Friends invited me to this seafood restaurant famous for black chilli crab.

It was busy on a Saturday night after fighting for a table although we had a reservation we needed up being waited.

It is essential here how to get serving staff’s attention to get “serviced.”

Foods are fabulous as we all loved. Especially deep fried shrimp with coconuts was my favourite.

BYO is a great feature here as well."
Birthday dinner,"Very delicious Chinese food . Awesome roasted chicken with Super crispy skin . Very rich balanchan favour and sambal for kangkong .
Staff is very good service especially auntie Lyn who took the reservation for me before . She also personally attended to us through out .
A very pleasant trip for the first time ."
Overrated,"Certain dishes taste good, but not all. Most of staff are polite, but there is one waitress who is extremely rude to customers."
Good food,Celebrated my friend's birthday here. The foods are great and the service are up to standard. A good place to eat at
nice restaurant,Celebrated Birthday with my Husband. Great food and wonderful service! The staff was very welcoming and gave us good recommendations.
Very very huge crab,"I can only tell you that this place is quite far from city center, Located almost at the airport. But the quality is good compare to the price you paid. We ordered chilli crab weight 2 kg!!! 1 crab which was huge. Cost is 70 SGD per KG. The taste is also good. Recommended."
Great Seafood,This is seafood qt it’s finest. Fresh and well prepared with q beautiful presentation. The menu offered q wide variety of choices and everyone in our group was pleased. The staff was extremely helpful in helping us make our selections.
Best Crab in Singapore.,"This no nonsense restaurant. Expect no frills here just simple good sea food. An old establishment, with probably the best made crabs in Singapore."
Very Expensive,"1 plate of medium You Tiao (fried fritters) cost $12 and they gave you 8 pieces. I think its a rip off. that said, the staff there are great."
The food was cool,"Every bite was like a surprise.excellent service, will come back to try the dinner next time Food was excellence in taste and beautifully presented, service was outstanding."
"Vibrant restaurant, great crab dishes",This restaurant hums with family life - lots of large family parties on the Sunday evening when we went. Very much a local institution. What it missed on refinement it made up for in the entertainment of watching the enjoyment of the family celebrations and the quality and flavour of the food. Be guided by the set menus - they don't offer a lots of clarity but did provide a very satisfying varied meal. Black pepper crab was delicious.
Average Food,"The aircon side was full. We decided to reach there at 9pm on Sunday to try for a table at the aircon side as my friend is not used to the hot and humid climate of Singapore. Two tables of diners just left and we could get a table immediately. I guess we could not have gotten a table if we did not reach at 9pm. Due to the high ceiling, the ambience was noisy. We could not hear one another at a bigger table. After changing to a table meant for 4, the noise level became bearable.

We paid $90 plus for 4 pax. We ordered 5 dishes - 虾枣，Baby Squid, Sambal La La, Stir-fry Spinach, Cereal Prawn and their signature Hor Fan. Mt favourite is the Signature Hor Fun. It has wok hei and a homely taste. My friend commented just their food did not taste commercialise. After trying one time, I will not likely return again."
Crab heaven!,"You know somewhere is good when it is rammed on a Monday night!
The black pepper crayfish and chilli crab are superb! But order in advance if you’re planning to eat later in the evening.
Staff were lovely and the place itself was cool, clean and spacious. Great atmosphere when you open the door to a noisy room! Would absolutely (and hope to) visit again before leaving Singapore!"
Reasonable & Good,The food is indeed very nice as heard from the ground staff that most of them have been with the restaurant for a long time. It's also reasonably priced! Must make reservations & it took me a few calls before someone picks up the phone as they are super busy!
Tasty,"Brilliant place for a good lunch ,we had a very good selection of fresh fish ,tasty & deliciouse food."
Dinner visit,The crabs specially as the place is known for was superb. The chilli crab is a must. Also the prawns were fab. The place is simple no frills but their food is one of the best I’ve had.
"Best seafood restaurant in SG, with a nostalgic feel","I have been patronising this restaurant ever since I was young. Love the food and the environment as it will bring you to the old days of Singapore. My favourite is definitely the yuan yang hor fun, chilli crab, qing long vegetable. Strongly recommended for all locals and tourists."
Family go-to,"my family and i come here for every occasion, birthdays, or even casual weekday dinners. definitely one of our favourite restaurants"
Almost Perfect,"Excellent food with beautiful presentation, which is the main reason for the huge crowd even on weekdays evenings. Non-aircon area gets really hot when crowd comes in, hope restaurant can do somthing to improve this area. Most of service staff are very friendly, especially one young waiter who is very helpful and patient."
Awesome,10/10 food 10/10 taste 10/10 visual 10/10 service Highly recommend everyone try it out when they are nearly
The best seafood in Singapore,"To start with have been going here 10 years. When I first arrived in Singapore everyone told us go to Jumbo, No Signboard and Longbeach. Tried them all but our favourite for eternity is Hua Yu Wee, local, always very busy and food always exceptional.
If you are visiting Singapore for first time this is a must and you won’t regret it.
So many good dishes to recommend .. drunken prawns, ginger and spring onion clams, sambal crayfish, Hong Kong style Sea bass, black pepper crab it goes on and on.
Prices also much better than touristy alternatives."
Good but not great,"Hua Yu Wee was recommended by a local Singaporean friend. When I asked him where can we get some nice Singaporean Chilli crabs, he instantly said go to this restaurant. The restaurant was huge with plenty of big tables, I guessed most of their customers came in big group. I didnt see any tourist, mostly Singaporean office workers. The restaurant was tucked away somewhere in the non touristy area. The sfaff spoke basic English but fortunately managed to get my order in. The Singaporean chilli crab was ok, a bit too sweet to my liking to be honest and the crab was a bit skinny. Crabs cost about $60/kg. The other food was ok. I've tried better Chilly crabs in Singapore so I think I will give this one a miss."
Crabbed out,"Have not been here for a very long while but was not surprised that little was changed since the last visit. For once, came to a seafood restaurant and did not try their crab - because of crab overload elsewhere.

Sat in the outside sector of the restaurant on a relatively cool evening. Many expats there on what I expected to be a quiet weekday evening. Sampled feng sha chicken, baby squid, prawn rolls and bbq pork along with kangkong and a delicious seafood soup.

An enjoyable meal. Strange to think that not so many years ago the sea lapped gently on the beach that was once located not very far south of that white restaurant wall."
Excellent choice for fresh seafood!,"Visited Hua Yu Wee for the famous chili crab and it didn't disappoint!
We had super-delicious chlli crab and pepper crab, but also need to mention the excellent cereal prawns!
If you look forward to having a great seafood experience, then visit Hua You Wee! Maybe making a reservation would be a good idea.
Its been one of the best experiences in Singapore."
"Fresh seafood. Rustic environment, good local feel, ok service.","Abit out of the way if you’re a tourist staying in central singapore or a person living in the west side of Singapore.
The service was quite prompt. Typical Chinese restaurant service, don’t expect the staff to be prim & proper but they are nice and helpful enough.
The dishes came quickly, the dishes were also cleared quickly.
Chilli crab is quite spicy for me. I preferred the black pepper crab which was fragrant and not too spicy or overpowering.
The jade tofu with mushroom was tasty. Seafood Horfun was also flavorful. Stir fried Veg is normal. So is the egg fried rice.
On the whole a good meal. It was a treat, so I’m not too sure about the price but I think for 6 adults, it was over $300.
It’s a seafood dinner so be prepared to fork out some pretty dough for it!"
Value for money,"Recommended for Chinese seafood dishes, not to miss its specialty chicken dish, chilli crab and black pepper crab though the crab dishes might be a little spicy for some. The children loved the stir-fry broccoli with garlic."
Reasonable price and delicious seafood,"Family of 7 members visit this local seafood reastaurant at 4.30pm
in a week day.
Time : open 7 days per week
4pm to 11.30pm
For weekend ,please make
a call reservation
For weekday,just walk in.
Price : reasonable,as it was a local
business.7 person S$300
Services : very good, the staff will
reconmend dishes to you.
They speak chinese, but the
manu got english .
Food : Every food taste good.
Chilly crab with mantou.
Lala , fish, kankong , megorang
drunken prawn, chicken wing.

It was pleasant to use dinner at this environment. The restaurant was actually a more than 50 years old residence small building.
All my family members enjoy to dinner in Hua Yu Wee."
Amazing,We were attracted by the many people who had lunch here. It’s a good idea to reserve a table. We were impressed by the fresh seafood and especially by the pepper crabs. Highly recommended!
Awesome Seafood Restaurant,"I went there quite a few times during my time in Singapore and was never disappointed. If you are a seafood lover, you should try this one out. Great atmosphere, good food."
Fab Food experience,"A large and obviously very popular restaurant with mainly family groups seated at tables for 10. Service is fast despite all tables being taken and is very efficient and friendly.

Great for locals out of the city but it is well worth the visit for visitors."
Excellent food and off normal tourist route,"We were taken here by some Singaporean friends. Excellent food and service to match. Full of local people, large range of very fresh seafood."
Supreme dining experience.,Nothing but the best! The staff were fantastic. The food was beautiful! Such a wonderful afternoon. Thank you to all the staff!I look forward to my next visit
"Chilli crab, Coffee-favorited Pork Ribs and Fengsha Chicken","As the title suggests, these are the 3 best dishes you can find that represent this restaurant. Quite a small place to find, but decent parking space if you come early enough. If you want to dine in an aircon environment, come early or else you have to do it alfresco style hopping it’s not too humid in the evening. Food wise, definitely value for money compared to the sea food centre restaurants nearby. For tourists, take public buses (10,14,43,48 etc), use Citymapper."
Great food!,"Rated no.1 seafood restaurant in Singapore on tripadvisor at the time when I visited. Simple unpretentious decor and location, with indoor and outdoor seating.
Everything we ordered was really good, except for the squid - we were expecting succulent squid but it seemed like it was dried then deep-fried... anyways, overall the food was great
The service was ok, but most of the waitresses couldn’t speak English. We did get everything we asked for, and fairly quickly. Reasonably priced as well"
Delicious dinner,Great food and cozy atmosphere. Being many times in Singapore I really love this place discovered with help of my friend Sonia:) Thanks!
Unpretentious Crabs.,"Old School Seafood Restaurant.

The last surviving member of the Upper East Coast Seafood restaurants (there used to be 3 or 4 within 2 bus stops). That says a lot about their food quality, though to be fair it has dropped somewhat over the years. Having said that I feel qualified to say that because the family has been eating here several times a year since the early 1990s.

Be warned though, the good crabs here run out really fast, and I would encourage anyone who is coming here seeking crabs to call in and reserve your crab in advance.

Recommended dishes
Black Pepper Crab (Perhaps the best I've ever had)
Chilli Crab
Dry beef horfun. Not Cheap. But oh so damn yummy.

A nice point about this place is that there is no corkage charges, so feel free to bring your own wines to pair with the seafood."
A great dinner with friends,"No need to go to Jumbo's for Chilli Crab, come here order other nice dishes and enjoy the atmosphere in this old villa. See and taste for yourself. It's about making your own experience, but I highly recommend it."
Good Food and Great Service!,It was great and the best Seafood restaurant in Singapore. We love the food served and the staff very helpful and friendly. Love the atmosphere! Definitely would be back
Chilli crab😍,"From the appetisers to mains, it’s nothing short of amazing. Quality & quantity make it worthwhile for westies, northies and southies to make a trip down to this restaurant hidden in the east. Some notable dishes will be chill crab, fish maw & crab soup & fried squid (appetiser). So, do pay Hua Yu Wee A visit if you are in for a feast:)"
Seafood in the east,"No GST, very yummy roast chicken and seafood, and really good desserts! Only downside is that it can get very crowded and chaotic during dinner time so be sure to make a booking!"
Delicious Seafood,"Had a family birthday celebration dinner. Ordered the usual chili crab, roast chicken & steamed prawns. They certainly didn’t disappoint. The favorite was the chili crab. Yummy chili gravy was thick & not overly spicy. Only problem was the slow service. They seemed to be understaffed with none of the servers near our table. Another tip is to get a outdoor table, the air conditioned hall was way too noisy."
"Busy place, great crabs","What a busy and lively restaurant! We caught a table outside and it took some time until the food came out, but, boy, what a joy! Our crabs were delicious! All seafood very fresh. A pleasure! And everything at very reasonable prices."
Always a Great Place,"This is our forth visit this year, twice this month. Food are at their usual standard - first class. They have amazing chefs here. Will be back whenever there is a reason to do so."
The best crab I've ever had,"First night in Singapore and a friend recommended coming here. What a great place, sadly I was on my own so could only order one dish, pepper crab. I challenge anyone to eat one without making a massive mess or to find a better place to get it.

Mainly frequented by locals and off the beaten track, but we'll worth searching out"
WE ORDERED CRAB BUT IT WAS CRAP,"Had dinner tonight with friends , everything was great besides the crab. We order the salt and pepper crab, and the meat of the crab extremely mushy so we called the manager over to question if the crab was off or not. Was surprised to hear her say their crabs were farmed and not wild caught therefore the meat is abit mushy. what a rubbish explaination when we had crabs at hawker centres n the crab meat was much better.

We are seafood lovers and crabs are one of our favourites so very disappointed with this restaurant."
Mother Day Dinner,I would considered myself lucky as I came here without reservation and still managed to get a table. They only served set dinner on 12th and 13th May for mother day. Prawns are really fresh and the chilli crab is at their standard. Love this old restaurant and definitely come back for the food.
What I like,The food always hit the spot and fills me up with the food.Their service is excellent. I like the free cold water dispenser.The crab is excellent as I can eat it with buns and it is super yummy.
Great clams and Crabs.,"Visited with friends and family enjoyed the outside dinning area. Three plates of wonderful clams and excellent salted egg , Black Pepper crab. All truely tasty with good friendly service. BYO wine was also no problem."
Over-hyped Seafood Fare,"The very much hyped and recommended place that fell short of our expectations.
Both the chilli and black pepper crabs were salty.
The prawns were over-cooked hence a bit rubbery.
Stir fried pepper beef was salty (suspect same mix as the black pepper crab)
Vegetables, egg toufu were alright.
In all, the food was above average."
Nothing beats their chilli crabs,First time there on 13/4/18 and no regret despite travelling almost an hour by bus. Love everything single dish we ordered and simply can't find any fault. Even their service is good. Highly recommended.
Fantastic Singapore Seafood,"We were lucky to go during Chinese New Year. The restaurant was full and, the service was still fantastic. Eat in the back, outside; the inside is nice but air conditioned and loses the ""Singapore"" touch. Over the years, we have had many dishes on the menu and they are all excellent. Still, it is the best Chilli and Pepper Crab in Singapore. Do not forget the buns to dip in the chilli sauce. I have been going here for several years and the consistency of the food and service is the best."
Best food ever,"simply the best, décor not flash, service not flash but the food is amazing. try and book before you go as you cannot always get a seat. if the locals go, which they do, then you know it must be good"
Good overall,I had heard how good this restaurant was. It was good but not outstanding on this evening. Was packed and maybe this had a bearing service was slow food was mostly very good but some of the waiting times were just a bit irritating but overall very good.
Always happy to go there or take away,"Very good food, typical. I like the back yard better as inside is to Aircon and to noisy. Quick service. An institution."
Yummy and not expensive,Most of the dishes are delicious. Service is pretty fast. Must make advance booking if you plan to go on weekends.
Delicious food,I think the best think I liked about this restaurant was that they actually de-shell the crabs for you! Cheaper than some of the more popular Brands for crabs out there and just as delicious. Will be back for more soon!
Delicious but expensive,The restaurant serves delicious food but expensive. The chilli crab is really food and fast service as well!
Delicious authentic Chinese food,"The chilli crab here is to die for and goes down a treat with cold tiger beers. The service was efficient and friendly too and the prices reasonable. Atmosphere was great, even on a Monday night and lots of Chinese families jovially shovelling down food with gusto. Will definitely come back!"
PEPPER CRABS TO DIE FOR,"we were visiting singapore and were taken to this place by friends,it is a family run restaurant with seating inside and in the open .it was packed. you would need to make a reservation.looked very ordinary , but once the food started coming we couldnt stop licking our fingers. it was too yummmm"
Old but gold!,"Been coming here for the last 40 years. Dine-in or takeaway, the food is always good. Like how my mum does it. I love the Roast Chicken, Har Lok (Prawns in Special Sauce), Pai Kuat Wong (Spare Ribs King) and Beef Steamboat (the special chilli sauce is delicious)."
"Good, but not the best","Big restaurant with tables inside, but most of them outside. Service is fast and the staff is kind. Food was average, not bad, but wouldn't visit it again. Food was fast as well, but a bit pricey for this type of restaurant. Mostly locals in the restaurant with the whole family or business dinner, they had a lot of food on the table, looks like they are wealthy or got a different menu. We had two dishes and two drinks, and paid pretty much European prices."
Where the locals eat Chili crab,We had a great meal at Hua Yu Wee. The chili crab and pepper crab were fantastic. I love watching the kitchen work here. It is always very busy but food comes quick.
Yummy Crabs ♥♥,"Ordered the chilli crab for our family outing and loved it! The sauce was amazing and I love dipping the mantous into the sauce! I think this easily beats out other places. However, come early for easy parking !

As for the rest of the dishes.. meh... portions were small and completely overshadowed by their crabs.."
Hidden Gem,"Simple and very busy restaurant away from the tourists. They sell crab dishes to die for! Try their chili crab, butter crab and black pepper crab. Best ever! Many regulars here, the locals seem to love this place. I will return when I am in Singapore again."
Crab aholic,"Hua Yu Wee Seafood located at 462 Upper East Coast Road, Singapore. It’s a basic place but it’s very busy with people. The ambience is basic, with a good atmosphere to enjoy the lovely local food that is on offer .Anyway if you are crab lover like myself, this place is great! It's the best quality crab meat in Singapore. Crabs are always super fresh, sweet and moist. We also had other dishes, and they all were scrumptious. But if u want great quality crabs in a pleasant no fuss environment then this is the place. Service was prompt given the fact that the restaurant was busy. .. We had a truly delicious meal which was very reasonably priced. The food was of excellent quality. The service staff were friendly and thoughtful, making our dining experience a memorable one. I highly recommended! I shall return."
Anniversary,good food and service and the seafood was delicious and fresh. The place was busy and there were many parties so it was quite noisy.
Traditional Singaporean seafood,"Great to get away from the shopping mall restaurants in this traditional Chinese restaurant. We had a feast: squid, duck, pepper crabs and chilli crabs. All apparently reasonably priced and absolutely delicious. Well worth it."
Delicious,"Good food with local service. Recommend to book the table and the crab in advanced as there are limited in door seat. If you don't book for a crab, you can get only one per table.

Better if you go with local as staff speak limited English but be able to communicate in simple vocabulary."
Going back in time with Old Style Cze Char,"The place and food still remains the same as when I was a little girl. No where else you can find a Cze Char place like the old days (Red House etc started in this area too out of a house like that. Used up be the beach out back).

Good place to dine for a trip down memory lane and also enjoy good food in a old styled bungalow.

Food is decent and"
Memories of yesteryear,"An institution of local cuisine; think of it as an upmarket Zhi char.
Its had been decades since I first visited this place. Upon arrival, the restaurant was packed. Even with reservation, it does not really matter for the team of staff.
A limited menu but with each category properly represented. Food arrived quickly and was dropped on the table with any announcement. The apparent of messy service is much alive and evident. Reminds me of the ""old school Hainanese"" service - abrupt and curt.
Food quality of average or slightly above average while the crab was the savior of the evening.
Honestly, except for memory sake of an old institution, one should not expect much from this outfit."
Great Locals Eatery,"The reward for a set back in time was amazing. The meal of fried squid, drunken prawns, stir fried greens and chilli crab made the experience very enjoyable.
The restaurant was full of local families enjoying the abundance of delights on offer eating at very large round tables.
Would highly recommend if visiting Singapore short stay and needing somewhere to eat and experience the local cuisine a short distance from Changi Airport.
Take a spare packet of oversized wipes if you want to take on the challenge of the Chilli Crab well worth the effort."
Try the pepper crabs!,"I usually go for chili crabs, but the pepper crabs here are really delicious. The sweetness of the flesh stands out in this cooking method, probably because it's retained in the shells and not leaked out into any sauce like in the chili crabs. However you have to be able to tolerate the spicy pepper taste on the outside. The roast chicken, stir fried Chinese spinach, scallops and doufu were also tasty dishes. No corkage charge for BYO. We spent about SGD50 per person. Service was quick and efficient even on a crowded night. The car park is small so be prepared to valet park."
Worth the wait,"This is the place that the locals would go for crabs according to my taxi driver, the place is packed, and short staffed. Just have to be a little more proactive to get the waitress attention, and if you don't want the peanuts just tell them when they served it to you (Peanuts are not complimentary). If you don't like spicy but still want to have Singapore Chili Crab, then go for the Chili & Tomato Crab with Chinese Deep Fried Mantou."
$350 for 6 people and left overs,"It's a tad bit expensive, but it's a seafood restaurant. Personally, I'm not really a fan of chili crab. Maybe it's the man tou that comes with it.... Instead, I like ordering salted egg crab. It's probably way more unhealthy, but whatever. The soups here are good, and the chicken and cereal prawns were also nice. Ask for some green chilis. They aren't very spicy, and have good flavor."
Oldie and goodie.,"A familiar haunt to those who remember the line of seafood restaurants along Upper East Coast road. The last of the Mohicans but I am so pleased the food is great.

If you need mod, pristine and matching chairs, skip this place. For what it lacks in ambience, the food sure made up for it.

We fed 24 pax and all were happy. We started with the fried fish skin, stuffed you tiao and baby squid. For mains, we had feng sha chicken, drunken prawns, chilli crabs with fried mantou, stir fry kailan and lala hor fun.

Dinner service was packed but service was good. Staff quickly attended to requests for drinks and chilli. Food came out piping hot and everything was fresh and the seafood was not over cooked.
Special mention to the fried fish skin, baby squid which are such fun starters. The star of the night for me was the lala hor fun. It's name is a misnomer as the dish came with lala and prawns. And boy was there wok hei in the noodles. It was the perfect way to end our meal.

I enjoyed the chili crab too. Soaking the fried bun in the gravy brought back many happy childhood memories. If I had to nitpick, I would say the drunken prawn though perfectly cooked came across bland.

Happy happy eating. Will be back

Tip: book indoor air conditioned seating
Tip: don't panic at limited parking. Valet available.

Sumptuous seafood and home-style food in Singapore,"Hua Yu Wee is an old-school, traditional ‘Cze Char’ (aka ‘Zi Char’ or ‘Tze Char’) stir-fry restaurant serving what many Singaporeans would consider home-style ‘comfort food’. The sort of food that Chinese grandmothers and mothers have served to generations of Singaporeans. While fundamentally Chinese, the cuisine is often a fusion of Chinese cooking and spices and ingredients available in Singapore and the region. Over decades, this fusion has resulted in distinctly Singaporean dishes such as the famed Chilli Crab and Pepper Crab.

Speaking of which, the Chilli Crab was sensational. Perfectly cooked crab in a gravy that was tremendously rich in flavour. In fact, the gravy is arguably more enjoyable than the crab-meat; sweet as it was. Their Chilli Crab, Black Pepper Crab and Crispy Sotong are highly recommended.

That said, we had ten dishes and all of them were excellent. So good that we would be hard-pressed to find anything remotely wrong with them. We came away from dinner fully satisfied.

The restaurant is situated in an old Colonial bungalow on East Coast Road. For a person who interested in heritage building conservation, it was a delight to see the bungalow being preserved and used. Admittedly however it would have been better used as a museum or similar.

Service was efficient and courteous by wait staff who were dressed like Singapore Airlines stewardesses. We found this quite quaint.

The restaurant is in two halves – the indoor section within the old bungalow and the outdoor area in the backyard of the property. It is subjective, and to your personal preference, as to which is better.

Would I return to dine at this restaurant? Absolutely and hopefully soon!

Recommendations / Tips:
(1) Book a table as this is a popular restaurant.
(2) Book an indoor table and be comfortable dining. Otherwise you can enjoy outdoor courtyard dining at the rear.
(3) Arrive early for dinner to avoid the crowds.
(4) Parking is available and free. Valet parking is also available for a nominal fee.
(5) Open 4pm to 11:30pm daily

Thanks for reading this review and my gratitude should you rate it as helpful. No pressure though...

Life is short. Make your plans today and go travelling and makaning! Enjoy Singapore and its food!"
