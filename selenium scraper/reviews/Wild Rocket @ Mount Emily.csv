Last day at Wild Rocket,It’s truly been a journey. Sad to see such an iconic restaurant leave the market. Amazing mod-sing dishes
Interesting but service could be better,"The place was packed for lunch during Saturday. I decided on the omakase lunch which was consisted of 7 courses. My only request was the dessert not to be the restaurant's signature Wild Rocket Chendol which I just had a couple of weeks ago. Ice water was served after placing order.

Course 1 : Bah Chor Mee
Negitoro (minced fatty tuna) topped with chopped spring onion and chilli padi, crispy lards, fried shallots, on top of a bed of warm glass noodles.

Course 2 : Thai Pomelo Salad
Served with tiger prawns & frozen coconut dressing
The dressing was like a scoop of ice cream and made of coconut, chilli, fish oil, and shallot. It tasted quite lemak. Having it with mint leaf, pomelo, and cilantro, it tasted quite refreshing with hint of spicy and sweetness of fruit.

Course 3 : Chilli Crab
Crab cake made of blue crab and spanner crab, served with chilli crab sauce.
The crab cake was packed with nothing but crab meat. Quite juicy and yummy on its own.

Course 4 : Hokkien Mee
Fresh pasta cooked with prawn stock, and hae ko (black shrimp paste). It was quite flavourful but a bit too salty for me.

Course 5 : Wild Rocket Strawberry Cheesecake
It served deconstructed style in a Martini glass. Creamy without too sweet or sour.
I was surprised that I was served dessert before my main. I later asked the staff who thought I already had it. In the end I went through what I had with 2 different staffs and decided that there was 2 more courses.

Course 6 : Black vinegar iberico pork jowl with pickled cabbage and chestnut puree
The meat was quite tender and pulled out easily. Quite appetizing with the pickled vegetables.

Course 7 : Lychee sorbet with lychee martini gummy
The sorbet was topped with ginger flower and blue pea flower. Interesting flavours of the light lychee and the slightly stronger ginger flower. Quite refreshing.

Overall the food was not bad but was a tab upset about my course of dishes being overlooked. By the way as the place was full house, it was quite noisy too."
Not worth it,"Agree with a previous reviewer that although the food is interesting, the pricing is way too high. Definitely not worth it."
Nice meal,It's a fusion restaurant with Asian and Singaporean food. Nice atmosphere with good service. My favourite was the smoked duck salad and the prawns
No wonder the restaurant is empty...,"I will suggest to Mr Low to relook/review his dishes and pricing policy before Wild Rocket goes the way of some restaurants in Singapore. A dinner outing for 3, with a bottle of wine, set us back nearly $450. Whilst his chef's execution of the dishes is interesting, the portions are really tiny. There are so many ""adds"" and ""adds"" and ""adds"" to each dish in the tasting menu. I really cannot understand why restaurants do that. It is petty. Charge one price and leave it as that. I can understand if the ""add"" is for truffles or expensive stuff, but it is not the case here. I left the restaurant unfulfilled. If a restaurant charges top price, I expect top rate service. Again, this is not the case here. Napkin dropped on the floor was picked up and folded and returned to us (and it was not changed). Side plates had to be requested. Service standard was merely perfunctory and not enthusiastic. And I can go on... My experiences at Wild Rocket were pretty many good years ago. It was mostly full-house at that time. The night I went, it was rather cold and is a sad place. Until Mr Low starts accepting that he has lost his magic and needs to do something about it, I will not be back. And he must realise that he is doing something very wrong here when he sees his ""then"" and ""now"" revenue. I really hate to see it going down like this."
Lovely Dinner,"Yes, it was hard to find. Eating outdoors was not noisy but calm and perfect for dinner. Portions are small, you have to think of it has a tasting menu. Prices are high but I don't regret spending the money to be there."
Not worth it,"After reading all the great reviews, we decided to eat here. Although the food is pretty good,the portions are insulting, the location random and atmosphere nonexistent. WE ordered the ravioli and it literally had only 5 small raviolis. The snapper was half the size of my pinky and the soup was exactly 3 spoonfuls-"
Interesting but noisy and inconsistent,"This small restaurant made our evening most uncomfortable. It was Super noisy!! There was No sound absorption, the voices of people was amplified and reverberated around the room and it was impossible to hold a decent conversation. Our ears were terribly traumatised by the time the meal was over. Service was below average.
Overall, the food was very rich and spicy and heavy and creamy. Interesting as you never know how the next dish will look n taste like. The Prata with tuna and caviar was a clever concoction but a tad bit salty. The Gado Gado was interesting and we enjoyed the crunchy vegetables and the rich ice cream. The fried oysters were served with a tasty sauce. The spaghettini was unforgivably soggy and overly spicy. The Buah Keluak ravioli was an acquired taste. The Ibirico pork with Black Vinegar jelly was disappointing and tough. The fish with Sayur Lodeh sauce was good but spicy. The chendol was outstanding!!"
A hidden delight,"We chose Wild Rocket after reading Tripadvisor reviews. Do not be put off by the location or the lack of obvious entrance to the restaurant as this is a great restaurant. We went for dinner and chose the 5 course set menu. This is a bit of a misnomer as there were choices. The quality of the food is very very good and while there may only be 2 choices for each course everything on offer is fabulous. We chose alternative courses through the first 4 courses and both went for the signature sweet chendol. We went for a reasonably priced bottle of white wine and thoroughly enjoyed the meal.

There was only one other table of 4 in for dinner so the atmosphere could have been better however we got to talking with the one of the guys serving who asked us why we had gone for wine instead of saki (which is a house speciality) I offered up my ignorance of saki as a defence and then got drawn into a saki tasting experience which was wonderful.

As ever the litmus test is would you go back and this would be a definite yes. Great food with fantastic service. I would encourage anyone visiting Singapore to try Wild Rocket."

Delicate flavours and dainty dishes,"We came for lunch which I think is better value. We missed the hotel entrance when we walked up the steps to the park but soon had directions from a local.
The setting is cool and serene. We had booked but there were a couple of free tables. I had the four course option and my hungrier husband had five. Food was very tasty, subtle flavours and seemed to be Italian with an Asian twist. The beef spaghettini was our favourite dish. The lychee sorbet was a work of art on a plate. We had water, a glass each of wine and excellent coffee and we thought the price was very fair. This is not hearty fill you up food but having a meal here to experience Mod Sin cuisine makes a welcome contrast to the delights of hawker food courts."
Evening meal,Don’t come here if you are hungry ! A la Carte and set menu the same - only 2 main courses - one is pork and the other one fish !
Delicious and accommodating,I went here with two colleagues. The chef was quite willing to put together a 5-course vegetarian menu for me with prior notice. The food was excellent. Each course was small with good flavors. Some courses had subtle tastes. Others were bold and spicy. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The wine list was good. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the atmosphere is quiet.
Wild ride on the Rocket,"Feb 12th we had a fabulous meal at Wild Rocket..the flavors were wildly enticing, and each tasting menu course built on the next with waves of various foods, whisps of spice, hints of exotic delicate flavors. We even had them pair wines with each dish, and the results were fantastic. All the servers (especially Ram) were very knowledgeable and could explain each dish in detail. Chef Low even took time out from the kitchen to say Thank you. A memorable experience."
One of the best meals I ever had,"I always wantewtl try Wild Rocket and I finally did.

The food is one of the best food I have ever eaten. The flavors are so familiar yet it's elevated to a point that it's mind blowing.

I would recommend anyone to eat at this restaurant and I would be back to try the omakase menu."
Sublime flavours,"Very easy to find, in a great little neighbourhood just out of the hustle and bustle of the city. Setting is very crisp, minimalistic and clean. Waiting staff were unassuming, extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the cuisine. Table settings and cutlery drawer were cool.

Food - amazing. I am sure dishes will change so won't review specifics but what came out of our experience is the obvious skill and passion in creating the dishes as the flavours, contrasts, and textures are so well done. Crisp and distinct flavours come through in layers that don't clash and complement each other so well. Each mouthful was exciting.

Priced very well especially for the complexity you are getting in the meals. The table service was excellent and the drinks (basic cocktails) were mixed expertly to the point that they were the best balanced and flavoured cocktails we had ever had.

We were impressed and left very happy indeed"
Amazing place where to have lunch,"We've decided to try this place for a set lunch menu. The location is quite far from the major streets but to be honest I enjoyed the place that was very quiet and with a green surrounding area. The strange thing of this restaurant is that it is at the ground floor of a building that I didn't understand if it was a condominium or a hotel. However, the atmosphere was nice and the staff very professional. I had a smoked duck salad that was really good but they could have put more duck to be honest as there was just the smell of it. But I can forgive this as the cannelloni with the duck ragout and truffles were amazing, one of the best cannelloni I've ever tried in my life. I also had a coconut dessert that was good too.
I hope to come back soon in this place."
Well worth the trek up Mount Emily,"We came here purely because of what seemed like a great value lunch menu. Otherwise I would have never considered coming here. Now that I have, it'll be hard to stay away.

We started with Soto Ayam soup and a Smoked Duck salad. Both were great. The soup was so intense!
For mains we had a Salted Fish spaghetti, which I was curious about. I wondered how it worked, but my gosh it does and it's fantastic! I didn't really like the whole peppercorns in there, as when you got one, it would overpower the rest of the dish. I left them to the side.
The other main was an Adobo Duck ragout cannelloni with mushroom and truffle infusion. Wow this smelt amazing, and it tasted even better. I had no words. I actually went to Gaig a few days later and tried their famed truffle cannelloni as well, and it wasn't even close to how good Wild Rocket's version is!
For dessert I had an almond brittle, peanut butter icecream and dark chocolate fudge. It was great.
Overall, I can't believe you can get this quality for $32! Everytime I am in Singapore, I will definitely make this one of my first choices! Well done."
Interesting Asian take on western food,Food was interesting and tasty. Asian spices and classic flavors incorporated well into western cooking techniques. On the whole also not that pricey.
Nice tasting portion and ambience,A nice place with group of friends. Tasting portions are always a pleasant surprise to the palate. The fusion in taste is interesting. Love it when chef has a passion for his work. Service is good. Great ambience. There is no recommended dish as it depends on what the chef is cooking for you.
Simply amazing,"We came here for dinner and were truly floored. Delicious flavors, good drinks and good representation of mod-sing cuisine. They were extremely accommodating and hospitable. A must go to while in Singapore!"
Very different in a good way,"Thus place is an experience from the location which is pretty hard to find , to the menu which is short and very unique. As we were a group of 20 + we pretty much had everything on the menu and everyone was excited about the food. Pomelo and prawns salad was amazing and pretty hard to describe as it had so many ingredients. Definitely worth trying.

The restaurant has a long list of drinks. While the location is hard to find it was definitely packed when we got there; probably wise to make a reservation.

Strongly recommend"
Hits and misses,"The decor was edgy rather than fine dining. Customers could come in bermudas and T shirts.

The service was friendly. They explained each dish on serving.

The focaccia was too dry!

The soto ayam was average.

The pomelo salad was great, an example of the whole greater than its parts.

The spanner crab ravioli in laksa broth neglected the laksa broth; not thick and fragrant enough.

The tiger prawn spaghettini looked good but tasted average. The Japanese seaweed sauce did not quite make it.

The chendol was great but the brownie dessert was too deconstructed, an example of parts not coming together as one."
Great find,"Hidden away gem, food is an interesting and delicious take on Singapore flavours. Totally recommend it. Look for the hidden cutlery drawers."
"Difficult to find, but delicous food","Although we had some difficulties to find the actual restaurant (it's inside a hostel) we are really glad we went all the way from Orchard Road to Mount Emily for this restaurant. The atmosphere is fabulous, cosy and trendy. The food is Asian and also trendy. The service was good, but maybe a little too quick. It's rather pricey and we felt like there was not enough time to enjoy the delicous and amazing food. So maybe ask them to slow down a bit between the courses?!"
sensational and unique flavours !,"Pomello Prawn salad was absolutely sensational - one of my most memorable flavour dishes in Singapore to date - new flavours and so refreshing for hot singapore. I would have happily eaten another portion!

Home made pasta cannelloni with the duck was delicious.

It is in an unusual location - at the back of a posh/high end youth hostel, however it is near a park, hidden and tucked away which made for a really peaceful vibe.

Great service too - attentive and friendly. Definitely would recommend and return again … soon!"
Tasty quirky mod-sin gem,"This lovely little restaurant hides its light under a bushel. There isn't an obvious sign on the street at the end of Upper Wilkie Road to say it is there, and you have to guess it is in the ground floor of the hostel at 10A.
But once you find it, you are encased in a modern wooden cavern, which reminded me of a giant wine rack and my companion of piles of wooden chairs. The menu ranges across Singaporean, Indian and Japanese, and all imaginative, tasty and well prepared, although my duck cannelloni was rather dry and tough to my taste. The pork main is excellent, as are the desserts.Certainly a place worth a try."
Hidden gem,Great food. The presentation and taste of food are excellent. Chef's interpretation of local dishes is just great. My guests all love the food and service here.
"One of the best and not $$$$, but A++ food","These guys served one of the best food in Singapore. If you are looking for Mod S'pore or fusion food because you just cant eat anymore chinese this is the place. About $50usd for a fabulous 4 course meal that included barramundi carpaccio
with orange shallot dressing & dashi jelly, spanner crab & daun kesom ravioli in laksa broth, and iberico pork char siew wi th shanghai kao cai & quinoa

the chef owner is quite amiable and the service excellent. It ranks up there with the other top end places but not the price is much better."
Singaporean classic with a twist,"My wife and I visited Wild Rocket for a birthday celebration and enjoyed our time there.

I would recommend a counter seat over the dinning table as it had more interaction with the chef himself and the bartender.

We had the Omakase menu; the theme of the food is classic Singaporean food remade into modern degustation format. These claissic dishes of prawn noodle, laksa, chilli crab, fried carrot cakes, and pandan cakes were transformed into different shape and form. It's refreshing in a way of giving diners the pleasant surprises by conflicting senses (taste/smell v sight). We also tasted different sake, which they have a nice inventory, through their recommendation through the evening.

The restaurant is cozy and the place is tucked in a secluded location. Service was personal and attentive, leading from the owner chef himself, Willin.

It's a pleasant evening."
"Excellent and unforgetable meal in a discrete, intimate location.","Came here to entertain 5 biz colleagues from out of town and they all left very impressed. VERY inventive menu, each course being a mix of cleverly complementing flavours, colours and textures. Half of us had variations of the tasting menu, to maximise the spread of tastes, and none were disappointed. Two of the party were vegetarian and one requested gluten free - not a problem for Willin Low, the Chef / Owner, who had obviously planned these when designing the menu, not as after thought as in some restaurants, and who made time to come out to chat with all the guests during the meal. The staff were professional, knowledgeable and super courteous and attentive, without ever being intrusive. The wine list wasn't cheap (but then it never is in Singapore!) and I was bit lost with all the Sakes, but the final price was very reasonable for the superb meal we'd had.It's a pleasantly small, intimate location that can be a tad difficult to find - but it was well worth the effort. A great find!"
Unforgetable food experience A+++,"Chef and owner Willin Low was super hospitable and friendly. He takes a lot of pride in his creations, using local flavors deconstructing them and putting them together in a new way. He created Mod-Sin, modern Singaporean food. The highlights of my meal were the assam laksa salad and the Iberico Pok Char Siew. The Pork was superbly flavored and tender. I would recommend the moderately priced tasting menu. The decor is well appointed, wonderfully designed but not overdone."
Disappointing,"Have heard much about this place but never had lunch there before. Went once for a private party some years back and like the place. Check on line and thought the price of the lunch menu was pretty reasonable. There is a 2 and 3 course lunch set. However, it was not stated that you can't order anything else! No ala-carte choice. One of our companion was not too hungry and requested for a soup but were just told there isn't and staff did not want to make any exception, even when they knew she then did not order any meal.
The food was a great disappointment. The appetiser we order, aka sashimi was too salty. The main courses are all pasta but tasted really bad. Trying to be fusion but really cannot make it. And one of us felt there is too much MSG because she is very sensitive to it.
All of us are there first time for lunch and we all agreed this place will be banned!"
Modern Singapore Cuisine,My wife and I visited this restaurant on the 13th March 2017 for dinner. Initially the taxi driver had difficulty finding the restaurant as it is not immediately obvious but it is well worth persisting as the food is excellent. Our 3 course dinner including a bottle of Suavignon Blanc cost Singapore $267 and was well worth the experience. The service is also excellent and the chef was good enough to come out and have a chat with us at the end of the meal. It transpires he trained as a lawyer but decided to change career to practice his passion of cooking and it shows in the delicious food presented. The strawberry cheesecake is 'to die for'!
Still as good as ever,"Went for lunch to try the new pasta menu. Had the oxtail rendang pasta - quite unusual but worked well. Finished off with coconut ice cream, delicious! Planning a return visit for dinner to try more of the new menu. Well worth the hike up Mt Emily..."
Wild experience,"Wild Rocket is the flag bearer of Singapore’s ModSin cuisine (which is a modern take on traditional Singaporean meals). Imagine having nasi lemak, char kueh teow but twisted and fusion into something completely unexpected.
The decor has a large infusion of wood which makes the place really warm and cozy. Really nice for lunch, albeit a bit out of the way from the city center."
Nice and intimate,Had the 4 course menu. The food can be described as Singaporean fusion with the West. They have paired the flavours well. Enjoyed the laksa ravioli and cheese cake to end. Small intimate restaurant at the previous Mt Emily Hotel.
Stunning if limited,"Lovely little place with fusion pasta, I had duck curry futtucine that was amazing, the beef tongue one less so. LImited menu and small seating area but lovely and intimate and the chef clearly tries very hard to come up with original ideas. Love the idea of him serving sake but not sure it works....

Worth trying"
For Fusion Lovers,"Tucked in the back of the first level of a budget hotel (but independently operated) at the top of Mt. Emily, this is a place to go if you are a lover of fusion food that is really done to perfection. The dishes are all Singapore cuisine themed, as their website explains. My companion and I each ordered that evening's 5 course dinner special, and shared all the dishes to get a complete sampling of the food. Portions are not huge, but don't need to be, plenty of food for the two of us. And some really tasty dishes. We happened to visit on an evening that the owner/chef was away (we were told), but the food was still all well done and attractively presented....a wonderful pasta dish, char siew pork, and seabass were some of the hits, though all the food was interesting (including the desserts!). We've all been, probably, to fusion style restaurants that just seem to throw unrelated food together with less than successful results. Not here, the Singaporean street food theme was present in all the dishes. Cozy and comfortable setting, its a small place (so perhaps call ahead), but the low ceilings keep the noise levels from the other diners at a manageable din, and the wood carvings on the walls and ceiling (there's a name for this I can't recall at the moment) most attractive. As with so many restaurants these days, bare-topped tables, but at this place, it works perfectly as its not trying to be an elegant, five-star affair......its a stylish, cozy, trendy place, really good Singaporean fusion food, great service, prices perhaps on the upper edge. For ""Fusion foodies"", Wild Rocket should definitely be on your list!! Recommended!"
"Go, but don't go too hungry","My all means go. Beautiful place, Swift service, excellent food. Wine list has essentials. Food is artful and tasty. Prefix was S$75 and left me impressed. But certainly not too full. BTW, your knife and fork are in the drawer under your table. Fun surprise.
BTW2. Yes it is in that hotel lobby area. Keep looking."
"Modern style, quality food","I was visiting Singapore in December and a friend invited me to dinner at this restaurant. It is situated in a quiet neighbourhood, not far from the top end of Orchard Road.

The restaurant is not the easiest place to find, but the food is worth the time you spend looking for it. The restaurant is in a modern house and quite low key. The restaurant is at the back of the house (hotel). Not a massive restaurant, so probably worth booking ahead.

The food is modern Asian, and we went for their tasting menu, four courses, each course was absolutely perfect, not particularly large (some may say small) but full of flavours that kept your mouth tingling from the pleasant tastes that kept going even after you had swallowed the food. The presentation on the plate was part of the art of the experience.

I would strongly recommend visiting the restaurant for a easy social setting, a romantic dinner.

This is not a restaurant to go to if you are looking for a pile the plate high with food."
Go!!,"I have been gourging on hawker food in Penang and by the time I got to Singapore I had my fill. Wild Rocket was perfect as it was still Singaporean, not Western or Japanese (what's with Singapore's obsession with Japanese?). I was in Singapore after all and what shame if i had gone to a Japanese!

Wild Rocket uses local ingredients and hawker concepts to come up with their cleaver creations. I was super surprised the Chandol desert tasted amazingly like chandol but it was not."
Amazing,"My wife and I where wanting to try traditional Singaporean cuisine and this is what we got 3 course set lunch was great value for money, food was amazing and staff extremely friendly. Not the easiest place to get to by MRT but shouldn't put you off going."
Everything is just right!,"Lovely interior, friendly staff and delicious food.

We totally enjoyed everything we ordered.

Tastes and textures are on point there's really nothing to improve on.

Nothing disappoints.

We ordered 2 sets of 4 course menu which offers great value.

A cup of chamomile tea after the dessert is the perfect closing."
Cozy & Chic,"With only a handful of tables, Wild Rocket provides a fun sense of exclusivity - all the tables were full on the Monday night we dined there. My wife is gluten free, and they made her a pomelo salad and a nice noodle & kale dish packed with flavor. The 48 hour spare ribs were delicious.

The best part of the meal was a dessert brought for my wife's birthday that wasn't on the menu but should have been - a pandan leaf panna cotta with coconut sugar. It was phenomenal - the best panna cotta I've had in my life. And contrary to other reviews we've seen, service was solid.

There was a great drink selection as well. It was our first night in Singapore, so we weren't in full groove yet to attempt the omikase menu, but we'd definitely recommend it. Order that panna cotta if you can."
Creative and amazing starter and dessert. Boring mains,"As per subject line, they have amazing starters and dessert. The thai-influenced starter which contained pomegranate and nuts was so amazing! Their desserts too...

However, I find their main very boring, both the menu and the flavor. We ordered beef and spaghettini. Beef was mediocre and spaghettini was totally dry and flavorless. Expected so much more for the price tag and supposedly Singapore's top chef.

Unlikely to revisit."
Very Unique Modern Singaporean Cuisine,"Great introduction to modern Singaporean dishes. Had the 3-course lunch and the food was good. Everything was very flavourful and unique. The only downside is that the portion is quite small, hence lunch was not as filling as it should be. Perhaps lunch could be increased to a 5-course meal considering the sizes of the dish."
Amazing flavours and impeccable service,"I had dinner here and thoroughly enjoyed it. The flavours were amazing - I had a very interesting soup to start, red snapper in a Cambodian curry and finally a pannacotta-based dessert. Every dish was amazing. I also really liked that the portions were just the right size - enough to make you satisfied but not so much that there is no room for dessert. Throughout the evening, the service was really charming, warm and professional. A totally enjoyable evening and well worth the money - I loved it, and will definitely be back next time I'm in Singapore."
Interesting interpretation of local cuisine,"We tried the omasake, while the children had either the set or ordered from the ala carte menu. Food was an interesting interpretation of local dishes - for example char kway teow with squid slices in replacement of the flat noodle. Dish was tasty, almost like the real thing except for a slight difference in texture.

Service was good. Crew explained every dish that was brought out. Even shared that they carried the sake which Abe-san presented to Obama and is now sold out everywhere. They even shared they had a sister of that sake (cheaper) which they actually preferred and we ordered that instead. Was a good choice, paired well with the dishes."
"Good food, service needs improvement","Visited Wild Rocket with friends and family for a special occasion dinner. The restaurant is located in a good location but the signage is poor so it took us a little time to find it. All but one of our party opted for the 4 course menu which we enjoyed very much. The portions were a good size and the food delicious, although we wouldn't describe it as Modern Singaporean, more western-asian fusion. The main disappointment was that one member of our party chose to have only a main of snapper which she enjoyed, however when it arrived it did not come with a side dish and when we asked if we could get a bowl of rice to accompany it or indeed any other side to bulk it out a bit we were told this was not possible. This to us was very strange and tainted our experience. We forgot to specifiy tap water and were brought bottled water, the waiter taking it upon himself to open new bottles when one was finished (which we aknowledge is quite common in restaurants) - we quickly asked for tap water when he opended the second bottle but were still charged: the water was extortionate! We paid 20 dollars for 2 bottles of water which I think is utterly ridiculous and this has really affected our opinion of the restaurant. A few tweaks to the service and pricing would greatly improve this restaurant."
A twist of modern Singaporean.,"We tried Wild Rocket for a special occasion lunch with friends, where the whole of our table opted for the 3-course set lunch. At SGD35, it was good value though there was the option of certain Main Courses which could be offered as part of the set lunch at a supplementary cost.

Though the menu was quite small, there were a range of interesting dishes which were overall tasty and with an interesting twist. Some of our party felt that the portions for the set lunch were a little small, however I felt that they were sufficient for lunch. The only let-down from the meal was the dessert - the options for the set lunch were somewhat lacklustre and uninspired. We didn't have anything bad, but nothing particularly 'wow'-ed us with the choices (champagne jelly with sorbet, or coconut ice-cream with Gula Melaka). All in all, a good meal that's worth checking out."
Relaxed restaurant with big flavours,"Really enjoyed most of our meal, flavours were good, spicy and really tasty. There's not a crazily large choice of food or drink, but it's all good, so that works quite well. Only slight downside is that the food came so fast we were done in an hour! I would highly recommend to anyone who is interested in simple food cooked really well."
Quaint Restaurant That Serves Modern Singapore Food,"Wild Rocket is a nice restaurant that specialises in ModSing cuisine. The dishes we ordered were mixed mushroom dash consommé with shiitake wonton, salmon red rice & baby octopus donburi, adobo duck with onsen quail egg, truffle mash & baby spinach, spanner chili crab linguini with onsen egg, 48-hr beef short rib with smoked oyster milk & kale crisp, roasted stuffed quail with yun cheong sausage & jus, peanut butter ice cream and black sesame ice cream. Our favourite among all the dishes were the salmon & baby octopus donburi, chili crab linguini, stuffed quail and both the peanut butter and black sesame ice creams. I didn't like the mushroom consommé, it was bland and one dimensional in taste. The short-rib was very dry even though is was cooked sous vide, adobo duck was ok but not really great. Service was exceptional. Worth a visit when in Singapore."
I expected something better.,"it is my second visit in one month as I felt comfortable the first time but the impression was the same. Food is nice but not ""special"". you expect something better in a place like this. soft shell crab was nice but the quail was overcooked. dessert ok but lava cake and raspberry sorbet are a strange couple. I felt I paid more than they deserved. I dont think i will be back."
Pretty Much the Best,"Nice location outside of the core CBD/orchard areas and therefore easy to drive to. The fixed four course menu for dinner was perfect, each dish had a unique taste and was just the right size. Staff are friendly and well informed about the menu. Don't drink , but the wine list looked to be good quality. Will certainly be back. Expensive and worth every dollar :)"
Martinis and crab,"Wonderful meal as a special occasion. Would recommend the 4 course option, promise it isn't too much food. Crab pasta particularly wonderful and delicious lychee martinis. Only downside - all courses served quite quickly so felt a bit rushed through."
Modern Take on Traditional Singapore Dishes,"My husband and I visited Wild Rocket on our honeymoon travels. We opted for the tasting menu and it was delicious! We'd been to several fine dining restaurants during our time in Singapore, but Wild Rocket was way more up our alley. I loved the lychee martini and, while every dish was great, the fish dishes really stood out to me. The chef even came out and described several of the dishes to us. When we make it back to Singapore, we will definitely be making a stop at Wild Rocket."
Impressed with the Fusion.,It was my first time to the restaurant Wild Rocket for a birthday celebration and was wowed by the fusion meal. We opted the 4 dishes set meal so as to try most of the dishes on the menu as far as possible. I was very impressed with the asian fusion of some of the dishes like the laksa pesto linguine with king prawns and the Chilli Crab spaghettini with egg. It was out of this world. I would recommend people to come try their creation. Thanks to the Chef for coming out with these dishes.
Good food and cozy atmosphere,"My friends and I ordered 4-course set meals for dinner and we enjoyed the food. The restaurant is small but cozy and comfortable. The portions are generally small but the quality of food is very good. We liked the short rib as the meat is tender and flavourful. The entrée and pasta are also very tasty, and ingredients used are fresh and dishes are prepared in a way that brings out the freshness!"
"Good food, quiet setting","This was a business lunch and we all opted for the set menu. The soft shell crab is good, although not overwhelmingly so, and the prawn with spaghetti main course was tasty and not too large. Dessert was a coconut ice cream with maple syrup. Service was attentive, and the meal was served quickly, which was perfect for us as we were on a short timeline. I felt this was somewhat pricey for the menu ($35/head for 3 small courses), but overall no complaints."
Surprisingly good,"We went for a function at Wild Rocket one evening and had set dinner. The mean was excellent - we had scallops, papaya salad (Fantastic), risotto, as well as other dishes. Service was attentive. The portions weren't large but very tasty with good wine pairings. I will be back."
Something to try,"The menu is relatively, as there aren't that many to choose for, we basically tried 2/3 option in each stage of the meal.

Appetizers: Pomegranate Salad, Salmon and Baby Octopus with Rice
Pasta: Laksa Pesto, Spicy Crab Spaghetti and Seafood Linguini
Main: Iberico Ham and Short Ribs
Dessert: Strawberry Cheesecake and Pandan Pana Cota

I am just simplifying the menu, with the most basic description.

The thing that I felt, basically was that there are some very nice meals like the Laksa Pesto and the Ribs. I wouldn't really say that the flavour or the taste of the restaurant is purely Singaporean, as there are many parts of Asia or even western influence on the dishes that are served in this restaurant.

I enjoyed my dinner, but for some reason I didn't quite fully feel satisfied, there is a feel that is missing from me to say that this was an excellent meal. It was good but it wasn't great.

I took quick photo of the meal, if you would like to see."
Sensational...,"Take my word for it...just book a table and try it out for yourselves!

Me and my wife went whilst visiting Singapore and we agree that the food is some of the best we've ever had. We like our fine dining and have travelled a number of countries trying some great restaurants, but Wild Rocket was a unique and more casual experience.

The restaurant itself is under a hotel on Mount Emily, you won't stumble upon it, you'll need to have planned the visit. The decor is modern and light with a casual and friendly atmosphere and setting.

The staff were delightful and very knowledgeable about the menus on offer. We opted for the 4 course menu and each picked different dishes so that we could enjoy as much of the menu as possible. The salad came with a frozen dressing that you melt and mix in and wow was it worth it. The taste and attention to detail in every dish was an experience and if we were staying in Singapore for longer we would certainly have gone back.

Dinner for two with several glasses of wine was around s$300 so very reasonable for the quality.

A must try if you like your food and are staying in Singapore."
Surprisingly great food!,"Was quite a fan of Willcookwilleat on Instagram, hence decided to pay a visit to this restaurant.

Was a little skeptical when I saw the menu online and nothing strikes me as must-have immediately. I am not a huge fan of fusion food too. Was pleasantly surprised that the food turned out to be really good!

Had the Pomelo salad starter & it was very refreshing. Laksa pesto pasta was the highlight for me. Flavorful, pasta done well & it's just an excellent creation - could never have imagine that two strong flavors could blend and taste so well! This is a MUST-TRY!

Had the lava cake & strawberry cheesecake for desserts. Both are nice.

The location was a little inaccessible, service was alright. Definitely going back for the laksa pesto pasta!"
"Great, could be fantastic with more polish","We had a variety of a la carte dishes with 5 people and booked a few weeks in advance. Except for the bar it was full house on a Saturday.

Some dishes were compelling: pomelo, prawn and coconut starter, deconstructed strawberry cheesecake dessert, laksa pesto linguini. Chef Low shows he understands flavors and textures here. Others were underwhelming: seafood crustacean oil spaghettini, beef short rib. A pasta of $35 should not be incredibly dry. These need a few more iterations before they are great dishes. Serving size for pasta's and main are a little small, but are just nice for starters and desserts.

Service was attentive, warm and careful we had an infant with us. Patient during our order with questions and able to accommodate. Could keep a better eye on topping up water.

Rich selection of sake's. The wine list is okay, not fantastic (all stocked half-bottles are merlot blend, so much for options), and prices are a tad high even for Singapore. Could use a few better beers in stock as there were only Tiger and 1 Hitachino when we visited."
Hidden gem,"This is my best dining experience in Singapore so far ! We all took the 4 courses menu at 75$. Even if it is 4 courses, you don't overeat as portions are very moderate. Everything in the plate is beautiful to look at, and then, when you eat, so many flavours, tastes, come out and it's simply divine. Very delicate, subtle, balanced. There is a good wine list as well as a sake list. You get very good advices on wines to best match your dishes. Service was excellent, very professional. And finally, the place, which is almost hidden in an hotel, at Mount Emily, is beautifully arranged, with nice wood furnitures. Very good atmosphere. I will definitely go back there."
Second time visited & just as good!,"This restaurant must be one of the best kept secrets in Singapore. The food is simply exceptional & even on our 2nd visit we found it absolutely stunning.
I have no wish to bore anyone by going through thw whole 'Omakase' menu dish by dish but suffice it to say that whether your palate prefers seafood, meat or puddings you will not be disappointed. I think only 1 or at most 2 of the 9 courses were repeated from the first time we came 4 months before & these were worthwhile repeating!
We would describe the cooking as 'Modern Singaporean Fusion' with a fine dining take on several traditional Singapore street food dishes.
Best served with their own selection of different Sake's, even including a kind of 'pudding' sake which is both most unusual & a delicious accompaniment to their wonderful desserts.
Not cheap (expect >£100 per head with sake or wine) but well worth it for a true modern gourmet splash out! We will not hesitate to go again next time we're passing through Singapore."
Great Modern Singaporean,"Interestingly designed space in the Hangout Hotel on Mount Emily. The food amalgamates local influences and ingredients with western techniques. Stand out dishes were the pomelo salad with frozen coconut dressing, beef carpaccio with sesame and ginger puree & linguine with laksa pesto. Wine mark ups slightly exorbitant, but hey, it's Singapore!"
Fusion,"This place has been around about 10 years and my 2nd time here. Just managed to debut on the Asia best restaurants list also

Was renovated 1-2 years ago and the tables seemed closer together. A sushi counter was built for the omakase dinner

We opted for the 4 course dinner. The wine list is short and kind of blah. My first course of pomelo salad had an instantly local flavour. The 2nd course of spaghettini is similar to the one at Ember . Main course of beef was alright. Dessert was deconstructed cheesecake

Overall very good, but many other restaurants to fight for mindshare here"
"Very good, just needs that something special","I visited Wild Rocket with around twenty of my work colleagues for a team dinner. By and large, most of the group were impressed - and so was I. However, I felt it just missed a special something that restaurants of this sort need to get the top rating.

We ate from the four course menu. I chose beef carpaccio, basil minced pork, pork char sui and cheesecake. The food was consistently good. Each of my dishes was creative, well balanced and very tasty. In fact, I'd struggle to rank them in any particular order of preference - and to some extend, that highlights where Wild Rocket just falls short. There was no single standout dish that I would insist somebody must try. If I went again, I'd probably choose four different dishes. All very good, but none that left you begging for more.

Wild Rocket has a lot of other things going for it. Located slightly out of the way, there is an element of escape about its setting. Oddly, it is attached to a hotel that has a very different class/style, but the restaurant itself has a nice ambience. The set up is simple but the quite perculiar wooden barbs coming from the ceiling add an element of intruige.

Service was very good. Both leading up to the booking as I changed the headcount and on the night itself, I found them helpful and friendly throughout. One of the best compliments you can give service is to say you got everything you needed but didn't really notice they were there, and I would say that applies here.

Overall, a very nice place and I'd recommend a visit. I have no real criticism, I just didn't quite find a 'wow factor' in otherwise very good food. Perhaps somebody else will!"
Definition of flavors,"Maybe a bit difficult to find but just worst for it. Amazing welcome. Staff trained, knowledged and worm... Let's talk about the food tasty tasty and tasty. We went for the chef menu. And was incredible. Don t need to talk about just go. In the wine list take the riesling from Egon muller best of the best. We took 2 bottles and match with all menus. Thank you for the team and see you next month. Egon muller fan....."
Nice setting and interesting food,"Basically smack in the middle of Singapore's centre the place is 'off the beaten track' on top of a hill (Mount Emily) next to a small park inside a budget style hotel, but don't be fooled by the latter.
The place is small and 'smart casual'. The menu too is limited but varied with 4 starters and 3 pastas, mains and deserts and the option of a 4-course where you select 1 of all (it's worth it) and consists of fusion Western-Asian dishes. I'm no Gordon Ramsay but having taken the 4-course I'm going to give it my best shot:
Starter - Beef carpaccio with sesame ginger puree: The first bite the sesame seemed a bit overwhelming but the ginger slowly infused and after a few bites the combo worked very well.
Pasta - Krapao thai basil minced pork bee tai mak with onsen egg: Presented very nicely you have to mix-up the ingredients on your plate to have a smooth, mildly spicy dish that combines very well. The chily is enough for a little kick but does not overpower the flavour of the pork.
Main - Baked halibut with buah keluak pesto & roasted vegetables: A good portion and nice but probably the most disappointing, found the pesto a little bland but the fish was cooked pretty much perfectly.
Desert - Pineapple dark chocolate tart: Awesome. The pineapple is served as a sherbet on a chocolate pastry tartlet with a chocolate filling and small pieces of cut citrus. Excellent combination with rich and well combining flavours. I topped it with an espresso which combined great too.
Also tried the house wines and had a glass of Marborough Souvignon Blanc which was fresh and tart and a glass of Italian Pinot Noir which was the lesser choice being a little 'flat' in taste.
All in all worth it despite the slightly high price."
Excellent cuisine in stylish premises,We had a tasty business lunch at Wild Rocket. Great to enjoy local dishes with a sophisticated touch. Don't forget to complement your meal with one of their nice wines.
Meal for 3 - superb,"Had a relaxed, informal and superb meal at Wild Rocket. Salad with frozen dressing and halibut for main was excellent. Great service too, really impressed with this restaurant which is off the beaten path but a terrific find."
Food is Ok,The food is ok here. not much to rave about but you can get your fill. At night its a great place to hang out and have a few drinks
Fantastic Foodie Experience - A Must in Singapore,"Had a wonderful team dinner in a private room. The tasting menu was diverse, great flavors and a truly ""fusion"" experience of French and Asian. The Sushi/Crudi of scallops with truffle was amazing. Each course built on the prior one and created increased expectations which continued to be met. Wine choices and dessert were great additions. we were a group of 15 and the quality and elegance were amazing and as such I plan to return and highly recommend. One of the best places for me in Singapore."
Very good but it was better in the past,"The Wild Rocket is certainly one of the top restaurants in Singapore. However, our last experience was average. The usual problem is a too cold AC, but knowing it we dress accordingly. The new menu was quite tasty, but we weren't satisfied with the main courses. The short ribs were served cold and the halibut was just a mini portion. In a restaurant like Wild Rocket one would expect pre-heated plates. Service was however the bigger issue. To be served in such (30 seater) restaurants from all 4 waiters is annoying. We probably would have had another glass of red wine if one would have asked us. No this time service wasn't good at all and food just okay but not whow as usual. Consistency is the challenge in this business."
Nice ambiance. Dont get what the hype is all about,Went there for dinner with friends and expected food that would be innovative and out of this world. Sorely disappointed. Had the pomelo salad with king prawns. Firstly that's not a aking prawn. Its an average shrimp. Secondly ordered chilli crab linguni. Very average. Heavy on the tomato sauce and the flavor felt more sweeter than spicy. Not returning.
Go there before this restaurant gets michelin star,"I tried the tasting menu and was surprised by the dishes one after one. Just very tasty, with lots of nice fusion of food and taste, which are the great successful experiments by the chef. The host who invited me to Wild Rocket reckoned that they need to go there more often now before it gets any michelin star. I agree, but I'll certainly go again even when Wild Rocket becomes that famous."
Our annual X-Mas dinner love,"Guess, we are creating a tradition: Again we spent upon arriving in from Europe in the evening, our Christmas Dinner at the Wild Rocket @Mount Emily.

The food is so savory & fantastic, we always choose the Wild Rocket Menu; for us a great first evening to kick-off our Asia holiday adventures.

The Wild Rocket crew was very attentive, professional and very nice.

Even though the restaurant has only a couple of tables and a bar with some folks, we had enough privacy and felt like home.
Why you should go there:
- If you love puristic design (Wild Rocket is held in Japanese chashitsu) the tables had drawers on each side with cutlery in it
- If having a view overlooking Singapore from the restaurant is not important to you
- If you love Mod Sin food
- If you love walking back through the quietness into buzzing Singapore (we enjoyed this walk a lot)

Love going there for our next Christmas Dinner!"
A nice interlude,Innovative and well done. Quiet with good food and peaceful decor. The salad starter with the frozen coconut dressing is tremendous
Just Ok,Recently went to Wild Rocket on recommendation and whilst there is nothing wrong with it I just didn't feel that impressed. Food is good but doesn't have the Wow factor and is quite expensive for what it is.
Good food but expensive,"I am going to go against the trend of recent reviews for Wild Rocket. Yes the food is good and the chef has been quite clever in making Singaporean food contemporary. We chose the a la carte menu and I just feel that it is over priced in comparison to other eating establishments in Singapore. Perhaps we will try the Omakase menu next time and find there is better value?
The restaurant is stunning with a Scandinavian ambience with very comfortable seating."
"Singaporean fusion, a surprise in every course","We went as a group of 5 foodies which meant that we managed to try all the dishes on the 3 course and 4 course menus plus a couple of extra. Kudos to the chef for reinventing the familiar taste that Singaporeans grew up with and creating something new and exciting! For the tastebuds now used to Mich standard French, Italian, Dutch, International, whatnot, I found every bite a surprise. The crab linguine was great (as most reviewers have said), the salad dressing for the pomelo salad which came in a frozen ball was just a delight. I would skip the mee tai bak dish in the 3-course but for the rest, must try!! Ok, perhaps you do not get an art piece on your plate for every dish, but the dishes were still a sensory delight. And I do hope the chef never decides to go for the art-on-a-plate ideology because that to me would become pretentious and would lose the Singaporean feel to the dishes.
And in terms of price, I found it very reasonably priced for what you get. Next time I get the chance, I would try the chef's tasting menu. I am sure that would bring back lots of nostalgia and memories. How great is that that a dish can do that for you!
Thanks Chef."
Outstanding,"You know that moment when you realize it's New Years Day and you forgot to sort dinner? No? Well I do. A frantic search on Hungry Go Where online booking system showed me just how late we were, very few options were left open, so I cannot say that we planned to head to Wild Rocket, but it had space and we had not being there for over 5 years so we thought we would try.

To be honest I had completely forgotten this once fashionable place, boy do I regret leaving it so long. The food is fusion, the menu options limited, but what is there is excellent. We only had one miss which was halibut baked with curry, just didn't seem to work, but the rest did (and we tried everything on the menu as well).

One word of advise, safe room for desert, they are quirky and delicious. The service is every bit as good as the food, don't think we will wait 5 years before we try again.

If your driving, you can also park in the car park just to the left of the entrance (the Hangout only has parking for 5 or 6 cars and is very tight)."
A true gourmet eating experience in an unlikely setting!,"This restaurant is quite small, part of an upmarket 'backpackers' hotel & fairly minimalistic. Don't go here if you expecting a luxurious setting & ambiance. However if you love new eating experiences, with highly innovative dishes, true Asian fusion style cooking using everything from pigs ears to French truffles & washed down with some of the best Saki then it's an unfogettable eating experience.
The service is also unique with every dish served & explained either by the Chef himself (a UK trained Singaporian lawyer turned master Chef!) or by one of the excellent staff.
We tried the 'Omakase' menu (equivalent to a French 'tasting' menu) with 8 very different (& all delightfull) dishes, accompanied by 3 different (& again excellent) Saki's. Not cheap but thoroughly recommended. Unexpected but probably the best meal we have ever eaten in Singapore. We will not hesitate to return."
Mouth-wateringly genius omakase dinner,"Just had Wild Rocket's omakase dinner at the chef's table and the genius of it blew us away. Inventive Singaporean dishes with bang-on flavour profiles. The bak chor mee-inspired scorched tuna tang hoon was just amazing. No attention to detail spared, down to the lovingly-selected crockery. Well worth a visit."
Hidden Gem,I was invited to this restaurant for the first time and all guests and myself were all impressed by the dishes from the tasting menu. I would not be surprised if this restaurant is to be given michelin star in near future.
Lovely neat restaurant,very clean and nice ambience. served local dishes and continental breakfast for large groups. every one praised their standard of food and quality
The omakase chef's table dinner at Wild Rocket was excellent!,"My seatmate on the flight to Singapore lives there half of the time, and gave me advice about where to eat. Wild Rocket was a great tip! I was on my own, and eating out solo can be a drag, but I had a wonderful time by treating myself to the chef's table omakase at Wild Rocket. This place is a hidden gem: cozy, modern, with jazz playing in the background. The dishes, 9 of them, were beautifully crafted and delicious. The servers were friendly and knowledgeable, and provided good company for the evening. The chef came out and talked to me about some of the dishes -- including details about the actual dishes the food dishes were served on -- and even brought out a special hand-crafted copper cup for me to have some of my sake from. All in all, a wonderful experience."
Unexpected pleasure,"Unusual location in budget hotel/hostel. Fantastic food and unique approach with silverware in small drawers at table, as an example. Lovely atmosphere, wonderful food, fantastic staff. Excellent value for ""top chef"" menu inventiveness and quality."
Very quaint and delicious!,"Very simple and beatiful restaurant with friendly staff. Chef Willin came out to meet all the guests and chat. Food is ""Mod Sin"" modern Singaporean and delicious. Loved the silverware drawer built into the table."
"Earnest food made with sincerity, familiar yet different.","Wild Rocket is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. i cringe whenever someone mentions 'fusion food' and images of poorly constructed food flashes across my mind.

BUT Wild Rocket isn't fusion, it's an insult to call it such. it's essentially Singaporean, modern Singaporean.

Singapore's unique identity is of us being 'rojak' and absorbing other culture's influences and give our take on it, Chef Willin is doing a great job at that.

I've tried both ala carte and Omakase on 2 separate occasions, and trust me, when you've spent far too much time and money across the world on multiple meal failures (like me), give Chef Willin's Omakase table a shot.

I know i will be back."
Definitely worth a visit if you like fusion cooking,"The chef tries very interesting (and sometimes daring) combinations, but we enjoyed every course. Nice ambiance in a quieter part of town. Not cheap, but good price/quality ratio. Personnel was attentive but not upfront. We went for the normal menu, but if I visit next time I will certainly try the 10 course chefs table tasting menu (timely reservation advised)"
Nice Singaporean fusion cuisine,"Although many restaurants in Singapore use local materials to create the local flavors, Wild Rocket is more direct in combining the famous dish into its Italian base cuisine. The result is very nice. It's located at foothill with nice environment. And the pricing is reasonable."
Delicious,"The 4-course tasting menu (at $78+++) was delicious. The ambiance is cozy, it's perfect for a cozy get together among friends. With Survival Chic's offer of 30% discount, it's fantastic!!"
Excellent fusion food,"I had the seabass and soft shell crab, both were lovely. I usually did not enjoy fusion food too much, but Wild Rocket did such an excellent job on the tastes that we decided to order more dishes to share. And the price was very reasonable too."
Interesting menu and location,"First restaurant before others in the chain, this bare and simply decorated restaurant is hidden away in the nostalgic area of Mount Emily. Their menu is interesting but the dining experience forgettable. A stroll in the area seems to bring one back to the Singapore of the 70s and is way more memorable."
superb fusion food experience,my son found this place. gem hidden in a residential district. we did find it after going round Mt Emily. we had a rocket set lunch menu. every dish was different from the usual recipes. not cheap. but you have to pay well for good food. The waiters were very good. Indeed one came out of the restaurant to guide us to our further destination. I would highly recommend especially if you want to celebrate an occasion.
Delightful flavours,"We had the four course menu. Everyone enjoyed everything. I have never had sea urchin capellini before,but it was rich, speckled with caviar, just wonderful. As was the soup and the rigatoni and the almost savoury peanut ice cream It's hidden away, but ever table was full. Portion sizes could have been a little larger is my only criticism."
