Great food at affordable prices,"Great food, fast service in a central location. We arrived just after opening and despite having difficulty placing our orders via QR code the staff happily assisted and recommended their specialties. Great location near our house and with MRT and bus stops nearby. Must admit they have the best egg omelette I've eaten in Singapore Thai restaurants. So were the other dishes we had, Thai green curry with Thai white noodle and tomyam prawn noodle, their house special with 2 big fresh water prawn. Will be back for more."
Spicy food,Very spicy food but very tasty for us spicy foodies Serve food quickly Attentive staff Thanks Highly recommend this restaurant for everyone who wants to come to This place
Excellent Thai foods in Singapore,"Excellent Thai foods in Singapore. Super delicious authentic Thai foods. We had pad kaprao, Som tum, pork BBQ. Love here!!"
Excellent authentic thai food!,"We enjoyed the thai food here, especially fried seabass, crav omelette and green curry chicken! Will come again!"
Superb Thai cuisine,Had dinner at the Hougang Blk 529 outlet. Quality of food is superb and price is reasonable. Definitely will recommend more friends to come. üëçüèªüëçüèª
Outstanding quality and value,"Outstanding quality and value. Great service too. During the recent 2HA lockdown Soi Aroy‚Äôs deliveries were a godsend. Reliable, tasty, value for money. Food was neatly packed, arrived warm and ready to eat. Keep up the good work Soi Aroy"
Good tasty Thai food in Sim lim,"Did not expect to see a Thai food place in Sim lim, was pleasantly surprised by the taste and spiciness of the pad krapow, pork cheek was flavorful as well as the rich Thai tea! Enjoyed my time!"
Hidden Gem üòãSoi Aroy,"Found this authentic Thai food at Sim Lim Tower while waiting for my box upgrading. Love this friendly place and enjoyed the food. Thumbs up to the signature noodle, delicious non-oily collagen soup with the generous portion of ingredients and chewy noodle. The sweetness of the Thai ice tea taste good for me. Not forgetting the yummy grilled pork cheek, the meat not too oily after using the flame torch lightly over it. Overall, I have a great experience with my first visit, and definitely revisit the place."
nice food,Food was pretty decent and portion was just right! The waiting time was quite short also around 5 minutes.
Creamy Tom Yam,Creamy Tom Yam was great!!! Portion is just right as there are 3 sizes of the food I can choose fromXD
"Authentic thai food, reasonably priced","One of the few authentic thai food that's not only delicious, it's reasonably priced too! Love the meat platter, vermicelli salad and surprisingly good bak chor mee AND their drinks are good too :) Service was fast even when i visited at full capacity."
Great Thai food off the beaten track,"When my wife suggested lunch at a Thai restaurant at Sim Lim square I was very sceptical but pleasantly surprised I was with Soi Aroy. The food was fantastic and the fact that you can order tasting samples was a real bonus as we got to sample many items on the menu. The Grilled Pork Cheek was exceptionally good and when you ask for the Spicy Pork Salad at the 'I want it hot' spice level, it is definitely HOT but lovely.
The staff were excellent, attentive and also taking the time to explain the concept of the restuarant and also the dishes which was very helpful. 4 bottles of Heineken for S$25 was also refreshing to wash down the fantastic food. We will definitely be returning to this little gem."
excellent thai food,extremely delicious thai food and friendly staff. the desserts here are so unique especially the cotton candy wraps. i would highly recommend people to dine here if given the chance.
A chance encounterüòò,Was at Sim Lim Square repairing my laptop. Was hungry so walk around and saw this Thai eatery. Ordered a few dishes drinks n dessert to share; Wah..was so authentic n yum..almost like I was in Bangkok again! The food is fantastic so decided to order takeaway for crab meat fried rice n mango sticky rice. Will definitely either patronise the shop or order in (saw a deliveroo ad). Have to try their other dishes n food from the restaurant. The staff are polite n helpful too! Highly recommended
Impeccable service and perfect food,"I'd just gone shopping in Sim Lim Square and was looking for dinner when I was caught by the extremely professional greeting offered by who I assumed was a random staff member.

I stepped in and got myself a meal, and everything was perfect. Not too salty, not too sweet...just how it was supposed to taste.

The service throughout was also fantastic; turns out the gentleman serving was also the owner himself!

13/10 would come back AND check out their affliated outlet, Super Thai, in Joo Seng."
"Bangkok, Singapore","Go here to experience authentic Thai street food & hospitality. Perfect break when travel is Covid-grounded.
The premium Tom Yam soup is appetizingly creamy & tangy. Mixed grilled platter was delicious: pork patty on skewers were tender & yummy, lemongrass chicken mildly fragrant & pork belly melt in the mouth! Sambal kangkung was sharply spicy.
Thai milk tea with chewy balls was a tad too sweet.
Best of all, the the price was affordable & service was par excellence. The waitresses were attentive & super polite. Will be back for their signature noodles."
Super recommended!!!,"Good service, ambience and the food is soooooo good!! It was a lovely meetup with friend because of this place! Come!"
Top notch food and staff,"Visited Soi Aroy for the first time on the basis of reviews here. Not disappointed. Two f us had the four signature dishes on the menu (taster size) plus mango salad and a couple of soft drinks. All four signature dishes were absolutely delicious and more than enough for lunch for for two. Served rapidly, by friendly and professional staff. Unreservedly recommended. $21 total bill."
lunch,"Great food. V authentic and nice environment. If you happened to be around the corner shopping for gadgets, good place to rest your feet and have a good meal"
Great meals,"Having lunch with friends and had ordered a few dishes. It was a great meal and highly recommended for the foods served in this restaurant... Very authentic Thai cuisines prepared by the Thai chefs.
Will definitely return to eat again and hopefully can bring more friends there."
Great and affordable food!,"I love Pork Skewers the most! They are so tender and juicy.
For the main course, Pork Ribs Noodles is wonderful as well as the grilled pork cheeks. I ordered the Thai Ice Tea, you can adjust the sweetness of the tea here so the sweetness is perfect for me. Not so sweet! Thumb up for the affordable food!!!"
Food and service is awesome!,Great customer service & great food! What‚Äôs amazing about Soi Aroy is their attention to details and food quality. I‚Äôd strongly recommend them. :)
Very Good authentic Thai Food,Dishes were all very good! Staff were very nice and polite too. Would definitely order from Soi Aroy again!! Highly recommended
Delicious!,Really love this place. I recommend all to try if you are in the area! Warm & friendly staff and central location.
Order everything!,Literally tried all the dishes after returning for many times! Moo ping and everything else. so so delicious!
DA MUST ORDERSSSSSS!!!!,"Moo ping, grilled pork cheeks & the premium creamy tom yum are my favourites! Definitely a MUST order if you have difficulties ordering from the wide variety! Have an extra stomach if you can!! :) Delivered right to my doorstep! FANTASTIC! üëçüèº"
Food,"Love everything on their menu, so delicious, and their portion size caters to the different tummy sizes. The ladies are so friendly and the space is intimate with excellent choice of music. I keep going back to chill, so relaxed I feel to be there"
Authentic Thai,"I took away Basil Pork with Rice, Thai Bak Chor Mee and Mango Sticky Rice two days back. They were authentic Thai and I liked the Mango Sticky Rice - the sticky rice was warm & soft, and an excellent combination with crushed ground nuts, a little salted fresh coconut milk and Thai sweet mango - it's heavenly. Aroy Mak Mak!"
Great food. Affordable price.,Love the food so much! So well fed. Owner even let us try his new cocktail concoction from his new menu üòª
Yummy yum delicious cheap,Yummy yum delicious cheap authentic! Premium Tom yum soup - highly recommend!! Up on level two - lots of interesting IT shops around.
Really good taste for a cheap meal,"Really good taste, a bit more expensive than a hawker but still very cheap! And all the staff ladies were super friendly Cons: you can only pay by nets or cash"
A Superb experience,"We ate their recommended dishes like the northern Thai pork rib soup noodle (super good), grilled pork cheek (super delicious with the sauce), candy floss wrap (first shop in sg that I know selling this other than Thailand) and the tapioca with coconut dessert. Red ruby was sold out when we arrive thus didn‚Äôt get to try that. But definitely returning to try that dessert. (: staff was very friendly and gave us some of their signature dishes before we ordered too. Overall experience is very good. I recommend everyone to try their food. (:"
Delicious Food,Warm & friendly people here. Food are very delicious! The tomyum kung has enough spices and flavour. Worth the trip down to try the food
Best Modern Thai in the country,"We stopped by Sim Lim to look for new computer internals and happened upon this charming little place tucked away in a corner on the second floor.

The tastes here are phenomenal. They are justifiably proud of the 12 hour collagen stock, which forms an incredible base for the Northern Thai Rib Soup ($7). This is rich, luscious and incredibly nourishing. The pork balls are fall-apart soft, and the ribs are tender and delicious. Come here for this alone, it's well worth it!

The pad kra pow ($5.80) is unbelievably light and virtually oil-free. Delicate and tasty, this is another 5/5 dish.

We had sides of the pork skewer ($2 ea) and pork cheeks ($4.50),the latter theatrically flame-torched at tableside. These too were incredible.

I had a very expertly done Thai tea ($3.00), while my companion abstained. The pairing of mango rice and sago rounded out a great lunch, for UNDER $30!

Overall, Soi Aroy is honestly the best Thai I've had in Singapore since the old Ah Loy Thai in Bugis shut down. 5/5 will be coming again."
Thai noodle specialist,"I dined at Soi Aroy 4 times over the last 2 mths and I will return because:

- it is like dining in a street side store in Thailand except this ‚Äústreet‚Äù is air-conditioned
- they are the foremost Thai noodle specialist in Singapore with > 6 delicious noodle dishes
- they use awesome chicken/pork soup stock in the soup noodles/porridge dishes
- prices are really affordable and the taster dishes priced at $3-4 allows you to try 2-3 dishes on one visit"
Reasonable price Thai Food.,Conviniently located in SMU Campus. Friendly service staff. Good selection of food with local flavour twist. Reasonably priced and offers multiple portion sizes to choose from. Good to try!

Great affordable Thai Food,"Great affordable Thai Food in Sunny Singapore! Must try the Grilled Pork Cheek! Pork rib soup is also brilliant , soft and chewy meat is worth eating‚úåüèª"
Wow Amazing,"I have been to Thailand many times and have experienced many different local food, This place does exceptional food and i would recommend it to anyone (especially the Tom Yum)"

Really good!,"We ate Tom yum and the signature platter, everything was absolutely delicious. Definitely recommend this place!"
Fragrant basil pork.,"First time dining at this cafe. I ordered the basil pork with rice and I was pleasantly surprised by the generous portion. The garlic and basil were stir fried nicely, and with the minced pork it is a medley of flavours."
One of the Best Thai Food I've had!,"We're visiting in Singapore and Soi Aroy was our first stop because of the reviews we've heard. It definitely worth the trip!! Their food was authentic Thai and the people who run the place (the mother and daughter) were genuinely so nice. I would recommend their Mixed Platter, Mango Sticky Rice & Tom Yum! Can't wait to go back. FIVE STARS!"
Unique taste of Thailand,Good place to escape the mundane local taste. Unique range of choices and reasonably priced. Try it out!
Creamy tom yum mama noodles,Return here couple of times because of their tasty Thai food! Especially love the creamy Tom yum mama noodles! Staff are attentive too.
Get the Northern Thai Pork Ribs Soup!,"This eatery was excellent. Staff were happy to accommodate me while I simply wanted to relax with a drink and later, when I was ready to order, I found them so helpful; patiently explaining the menu to me. In the end I ordered the Pork Ribs Soup and it was fantastic. The meat was really high quality, without gristle or chewy fat which surprised me given the affordable price. The curry sauce was also delicious, and the manager offered to adjust the spiciness for me when she brought the dish out. Really great place, great food, great staff. My best find in Singapore so far!"
Signature Noodle at Soi Aroy,fantastic atmosphere with friendly waitress. good signature noodle with authentic iced milk tea Good environment nearby Sim lim Square
Not the super place as it‚Äôs described,"An average street food cafe, but the staff is incredibly friendly. People saying that it‚Äôs true thai food, 100% have never been to Thailand, Tom Yum has nothing common with Thai Tom Yum. The location is pretty weird, like it‚Äôs located in cheap shopping mall with hand me down items. I don‚Äôt understand all the amazed reviews."
Nice Thai food,One of the best Thai restaurants here in Singapore. Great food! Recommend the grilled pork and Thai seafood noodle.
Great dinner,"Thai food from Soi Aroy is great experience. Premium Tom Yum soup n basil pork taste fantastic good, thumbs up. Our family regular Thai food place."

Lunch with friend,"Service and food was great! The lady still have us free thai snacks to try and it was good.

Nice food and nice staff,The lady boss is really nice and friendly and recommended some of the speciality. Food is not too bad as well. Cannot get the mini option because it is too small. The regular portion is just about right.
Saturday Dinner,"Excellent value, healthy options, awesome service & interesting Thai street food. No MSG in 12-hour Pork Collagen Souo! Loved the colourful signature drink: Aurora Cooler! Reminds me of the Northern Lights."

Recommended for people to try different kinds of thai food here ^^"
Unique and delicious!,"Had the Northern Thai Pork Ribs Soup, Thai Bak Chor Mee, Mixed Platter (Pork Skewer, Grilled Pork Cheek, Lemongrass Chicken) and a Mango Sticky Rice.

Overall very delighted and happy with the food. Very interesting flavours and quite unique as compared to other Thai food places.

The broth of the soup was rich and tasty. The pork cheek is super yummy and they flame grilled it on the spot!

Mango sticky rice was a great way to end the meal!

Do give it a try."

Delicious,"Delicious without msg. Tom-yum taste very good, ba-chor noodle and basil pork r good. Staff friendly and food are reasonable price."
"It's good, but is it that exceptional? No.",Good value for money but not delicious to the point it deserves such a high rating. I was even disappointed by the egg noodles which tasted very average in quality . Service is very nice.
Hidden gem in Rochor,"The food is good! Not a lot if place like this in rochor, it's a must visit! The owner and the staff really friendly and helpful to giving ideas what to eat."
Thai food name is Soi Aroy,The food is very nice and more choices for eating. Menu is very good food from Thailand. Taste is similar from original.
A pleasant dine out with my wife,"Like to give praises to the staff/owner managing this shop. They are very patience and friendly. The food is good, we ordered Thai Pork ribs soup with brown bee hoon, this combination was recommended! My wife order Thai stewed chicken soup, we felt abit like Chinese taste but with Thai rice noodles, is abit fusion

Lastly end off with a WARM mango sticky rice ‚ù§Ô∏è favourite Thai dessert food for us"
Delicious Thai Food with Good Service,"Great food, Nice Variey & friendly staffs Ate Thai Bak Chor Mee they are generous with their ingredients Nice ambience too!"
DELICIOUS AND GOOD!!,Best in town! Must try. Revisit for second time and the quality is still good. Will definitely come again üòä
Delicious!,The food was delicious and afordable! You must try the northern thai pork ribs soup and the ice tea collection! We recommend it 100% if you are in the neighborhood!
Rochor delight,Cute cosy space. Friendly space. Great food. Char siew is not bad - soft and fatty. The spicyness can be reduced
Good affordable thai food!,Good rib noodles! Decent portion even for small. Tasty mango salad too. Friendly and warm service by the hosts
Enjoy great food,"Had ordered number of dishes.... Creamy Tom yum, Northern Thai pork ribs soup, pork skewers and Thai tea. All taste perfect for me and my family. This is one of our best Thai eating place to have. Will come again soon.. Cheers"

Spicy and Shiok,"I had the Northern Thai Pork Ribs Soup and it was darn Shiok ... my nose started leaking as it was spicy ( in a nice way). The ribs were tender and the brown rice bee hoon went very well with soup .

The staff were very helpful and Super Hospitable. Great experience.

Will definitely come back again!!"
Authentic Thai Food,"This place takes me back to bangkok solely with the taste of the creamy tomyum maggi dish that i ordered, prepared by thai chefs proves its authenticity in my point of view. The spicy level is legit thai style in terms of spiceness so if you are a chilli lover, go for the ‚ÄúI WANT IT HOT‚Äù level"
Nice food!,"Service was excellent, beautiful staff, food was excellent and for a moment I thought I was in Bangkok. 10/10 will come again for nice Thai food! üëçüèª"
Best tom yum soup !! üëçüëç,The tom yum soup flavour is so thick and tasty :) i like the grilled pork cheek and the satay!! Everything i order is good üëçüëç
Great place!!,"The food is great. I tried the northern Thai pork ribs soup and both were delicious. I am Mexican and we were looking for spicy food and here was the perfect place to eat spicy. The place is inside a shopping center, in the second floor."
Great food!,"Ordered the creamy tomyam and northern Thai pork rib soup. Like both of them. Simple, flavourful and just enough portion."
Hidden gem in Sim Lim Square,"Ordered the basil pork, noodles with collagen soup (soup was thicc!), tom yam noodles, stewed chicken soup, and sai mai (interesting candy floss dessert).

Food was yummy and service was excellent. Even though we came after their operating hours, they were very patient and accommodative when taking our orders as we had multiple food restriction.

Highly recommended, will definitely come back again! :)"
Good food for good pricr,"I had the premium Tom Yum Soup Main and the mini Thai Milk Tea mini.
The Tom Yum soup wasn't very spicy, so it's good for kids trying their first time. However I found it a bit more sour than the usual fare you have outside. Regardless, the prawns given was big. The main jewel of this would be the pork, which tastes authentically Thai!

The Thai Milk Tea doesn't taste as sweet as other selling outside and the tea taste is stronger.

They also have a 12 hour collagen soup base broth made daily so that's another plus point for me.

Overall I was very satisfied with this and would come back again!"
Good service and nice ambience,"Came here for lunch on Sunday and was surprised that the staff was friendly, food was good and ambience was nice."
Awesome yummy food,Hi! We love your food. Pls keep up the goodwork! We will keep coming every week during lunch breaks from work!
Nice food and friendly staff,"We read the reviews on trip advisor and went to this place for lunch. Because we had no internet and it was on the second floor of the building, we spend some time looking for the place but with some help of local people we found it. It is a small cozy restaurant with friendly staff that was not too busy when we arrived. The food was very nice with a bit of spiciness. Also the drinks were good, especially the purple one (see picture). I therefore recommend this place!"
Thumbs Up!,Friendly staff. Authentic Thai food at affordable prices. Centrally located near train stations and public transport. Very convenient.
Affordable and authentic Thai food,"Thai tea and food was super authentic, exactly like how you‚Äôll expect in Thailand (food was quite spicy but it‚Äôs ok) Affordable pricing , would come back!"
Good,The owners were friendly and helpful. Collagen chicken broth noodles was good though the broth was not as satisfying as other collagen broths I've had.
Satisfying my cravings for Thai üòç,"Revisiting my old favourites at Soi Aroy, but now with an expanded menu (3 different sizes) & a brand new outlet at SMU! Can never get enough of the tomato-base soup for the pork rib noodles, healthy with no MSG! Won't make your hair drop!ü§£ü§£ü§£"
