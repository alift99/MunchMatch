Fantastic family dinner,"We had a family dinner, about 20 of us at Burlamacco. Was fantastic.

Grace did an amazing job in responding the the various queries from certain guests prior to the event and accommodated most of teh requests.

The set menu provided a great choice and what we had was fantastic, really well presented and a delight to consume.

on the evening the service was first class, prompt, efficient and attentive.

highly recommend."
"Meh, didn't enjoy the food","We were there in conjunction with Restaurant Week. More details on food later.

Paintings were nice to look at.
There are a couple of tables outside as well, which can be nice to sit during their happy hour. I wish this was made known more as lots of us are looking for happy hour places!

Water is not complimentary (FYI)!

The server was friendly, surprisingly anticipating my needs, way to go girl, and kudos to that.

Let's talk food, 4 course meal which includes Carparcio & Burrata as appetizer which were alright. Linguine lobster pasta was good; we both agreed upon that.
Then, after came the main course Pork Chop and Sea Bream Fillet. Personally, the fish smelled extremely fishy, and I couldn't bring myself to have it. It would be great if they had included that the soup was cooked with clam juice, not just with white wine.
The desserts were passable. Undoubtedly, we enjoyed Tiramisu, which was on the house. That's very kind!"
"Great food, excellent service",We had lunch at the East Coast outlet. The food is tasty and prices are reasonable. Excellent service and friendly staffs. Would definitely recommend others to try here if they want Italian food in the east side.
Wonderful!,"A friend and I were looking for somewhere new we'd not tried before and Burlamacco was chosen. As much as we go to venues on Telok Ayer, Amoy St, etc, we often forgot that there are so many great places on Stanley St.

Upon arrival the venue was empty apart from one couple inside. We hesitated - all the others places along Stanley St were heaving - so we decided to grab one of the two tables outside for a drink before making a decision.

One tiny criticism here - they don't offer tap water - only bottled water for $9.... Surely free tap water should be standard, no?

Anyhoo, whilst enjoying our drinks, a few more people arrived to dine inside but it remained quite empty for its size. Despite this, the menu looked good, the atmosphere outside trickling down from other venues was great and our waitress, Brema, was simply lovely.

We are so glad we took the chance as the food was delicious! Brema continued to be lovely, offering advice on our choices and answering our questions. We ended up being the last to leave and feeling absolutely stuffed from all the wonderful food.

We will definitely be going back - not just because of the great service but because there's so much yummy food we still need to try - so don't be put off if it's not busy."
Great food,"I've been to this restaurant a few times before, but the food quality seems to have improved, and I found the food much nicer compared to previous visits."
Burlamacco Ristorante (East Coast),"Burlamacco is at its very essence an Italian boutique restaurant which serves typical Tuscan cuisine in a family setting. A simplistic interior yet elegant, Burlamacco provides a fine dining experience nevertheless with Riedel wine glasses and cutlery you would typically find at a Michelin star restaurant. A recently opened sister branch of the original Stanley Street popular spot, Burlamacco fulfills every Italian food lover’s desire with the creamy burratta starter to awaken/stimulate the palette followed by customizable vegetarian pasta dishes and a perfectly created Italian coffee cheesecake (yes, Tiramisu...)! What really caught my attention was their ability to create an arrabiatta sauce so perfect in consistency and balance of flavours, I barely left any gnocchi for the fellow diners on my table. The truffle cream sauce risotto with porcini mushrooms took the gastronomic journey to a whole new level with the “just right” amount of creaminess to balance the granularity of the carnaroli rice (again..you guessed it : dream like truffle risotto). To complete the meal was a well balanced Tiramisu in a ‘wine cup’( if thats what they call it)...basically, the sweetness of the semi-thick mascarpone cream and the bitter flavour of the Kahlúa balanced each other out extremely well. I shall definitely be paying Burlamacco another visit...hopefully, leaving satisfied yet again!"
Excellent food and Service,"The sesame crusted tuna tartare was well balanced.My husband enjoyed the steak and said it was the best he had had during this restaurant week winners' edition. I enjoyed the pannacotta whilst he ravished the chocolate tart. The coffee included in the set menu was a pleasant way to end the meal. As always we received a warm welcome from Mr Suraj, the restaurant manager. He really went out of his way to make us feel welcome. A lovely way to spend an afternoon. The automated calling system needs addressing. Even though I had informed the restaurant that we'd be there in 5 minutes, I received a further 4 phone calls."
Best Italian in singapore - outstanding five stars!,"Hidden gem - outstanding five stars!!!!
Best Italian in Singapore hands down. We have tried almost every Italian in Singapore including a number on the East Coast and some Michelin starred favourites in Purvis street. Burlamacco is very well priced including the wine list. The BYO on Tuesdays and Thursdays is an added bonus and we will definitely come back for that. Some of the best service in Singapore and the food is five stars. Recommend the T-bone steak if you are lucky enough to get it as the special. It was child-friendly and they made a huge fuss of our children making them feel like princesses. If you are looking for a casual mid-week speedy dinner or a special romantic dinner with excellent wine, you won’t be disappointed. I just wish we had discovered this hidden gem sooner."
Had higher expectations,"Not worth the fame and cost. I’ve eaten much better in other Italian restaurants for the same I payed here. It’s not bad, just not as good as I expected."
One of the best Italian Restaurant in Singapore,"Went for a family dinner in Dec. We ordered Polpo’ , Balsamic Grilled Octopus Tentacles for Appetizer and it was so tender , soft and delicious. I tried the same dish in other Italian restaurant , most other restaurants will get the tip of the tentacle char and burnt but not in Bulamacco, they cook it nicely without buringing the tip which is a plus for me. This is by far the best Polpo I had tried in Singapore. We also order the Linguine’ Boston Lobster Tail and I have to comment that the lobster was so fresh and nicely cooked. The cook did it nicely so that it was not over cook and become very chewy. We really love the dish. The portion is big as they served the whole lobster and is really worth if for the price we paid. My daughter had the ‘Capellini’ Angel Hair with Blue Swimmer Crab Meat and it was another very tasty and delicious dish. I had ‘Tonnarelli’ Pasta with Hokkaido Scallops in Basil ‘Pesto’. I don't like the combination of pairing scallop with spinach , that is just my personal taste. Overall the service was good and we had a very enjoyable evening."
Lunch experience at Burlamacco,"food and service are okay. But need to brighten up the interior as the whole room is somewhat dark. considering the price point, its generally value for money."
Great food but ambiance.....,"The food is always great; but the ambiance is no longer the same.
It was rather noisy and to the extent of rowdy for a while.
And even without comparing to the previous ""version"" (previous location/restaurant), the premise has some room for improvement. Also surprised to see that white (literally) lights are being used in the core part (and focus area) of the restaurant."
Nice Italian Food,"Was looking for a simple but impressive place for a lunch where I can conduct some catching up with old friend. Very reasonable set lunch with quite a good choices to choose from,."
Extremely slow service,"I am sitting here, 1 hour 45 min after arriving and our group of 4 is still missing one main dish. Throughout dinner, our group was told to wait multiple times and they clearly served other tables first. Could be due to our group looking young (low 20s) due to our casual dressing and small builds. Very judgemental place, it was a totally unenjoyable experience."
Great restaurant week choice,"It is our first time dining here and did so during the Restaurant Week. It was full house. They don’t serve complimentary water but they serve complimentary focaccia bread. The 4 course menu with sponsored whiskey and coffee is excellent. Portions are decent. We really like the hamachi with pink peppercorns, lobster tail linguini, lamb shoulder, beef short ribs and ginger date pudding. The 5 service staff are very friendly and food is served quickly. We left as soon as the crowd built up."
Overall Review,Went there for a business lunch. The service was way better than the food provided! However both were not lacking. A decent place to dine.
A good deal,"Service staff were extremely friendly and attentive. The 1-1 pasta deal we got was extremely worth it, but if I were to pay for the dishes the ala carte price, I would be actually be dissatisfied.
Truffle Gnocchi: Good but slightly too creamy for my liking. Gnocchi was chewy, but I would've preferred a crispy exterior.
Crab Capellini: Lobster bisque was good, but I prefer my capellini dry, and not in a soup.
Losber Linguine: Was decent, nothing too special.
Scallop Tonnarelli: Excellent presentation, which huge scallops which I appreciated, but the pesto fell flat. Tonnarelli was good."
"Nice ambience, tasty food and friendly staffs",Four of had dinner at Burlamacco tonight and we enjoyed our time here. Food is tasty and the staffs are friendly and attentive. Nice ambience and reasonable prices. Would definitely recommend people to eat here. Thanks to David and his team.
"Tuscan food, for business lunches or relaxed dinners, in the CBD","The owner is Tuscan, and he always offers one or two Tuscan dishes in his a la carte menu. (Singaporeans loving tripe should check ahead if it is on the menu.) The executive lunchtime menu is excellent value, but I have organised larger dinner groups pre Covid with a custom menu."
Excellent food and service!,"Every item we ordered came out great. Service staff was honest to let us know that we might have over ordered and suggest that we add on later if we want more. The revised order turned out to be just right for us.

Will definitely come back for more!"
Wholesome robust flavors,"From the foie gras to the lobster linguine, the seafood stew and the chocolate lava cake, it was very good through out!

So many places where it’s only 1 or 2 out of 3 courses that were very good.

Service was warm and gracious. There when you need them, left alone for you to enjoy the company of guests when not.

An assured place."
"Awesome food, lovely vibes and ambience","The food was superb and reasonably priced for authentic Italian cusine, the service is prompt and friendly. Definitely worth a visit and we will return soon :)"
Great night out,"This is the first time we are trying the restaurant. Saw mixed reviews, but decided to give it a try. We were delighted with our starters - Fegato was stunning and Calamari was great. We had Spicy ""Arrabbiata"" Linguine with Boston Lobster Tail and Manzo for mains, and they were both excellent, although the Marsala Wine sauce was too sweet for me. However, we were really disappointed with Tiramisu. However, we had excellent service while there - granted we were the first set of customers on that evening."
terrible service,Food great as always the service was absolutely diabolical. We asked for service 4 times in the end we just paid the bill and left.
Lovely Dinner,New good find! Servers were really friendly. Would prefer the complimentary bread to be served warm but it’s alright. The impossible meat pasta is very good. I’m really happy with the Cod fish too! Excellent!
Appalling Service,"We had some friends over from the U.K. so 6 of us went to what has always been our turn to Italian in Singapore. The food as always was superb - But and its a big but Gabriel was not around last night and the duty manager just wasn't able to cope - We requested service 4 times in all and were ignored, In the end we requested the bill and left. So , So disappointing we were made to look rather foolish in front of our guests who couldn't understand why we had chosen this restaurant with such appalling service in the first place."
Outstanding service and food,"We had dinner here last night. My husband and I both got the vegetarian menu, which had a set four courses. The manager was very nice to offer to make us each something different for the four courses so we could share and have more variety. We really appreciated this and enjoyed everything we ate. It was more than enough food and the service was outstanding. We loved the fact that they offer free corkage on some nights, which is how we discovered this restaurant. It’s a great choice for special occasions. We certainly felt we were treated special. It is not often I leave a restaurant feeling I should write a positive review."
"Excellent service, good food","The service here is excellent. Ambience is nice and the food is also very good. I'm very happy that they now offer the pasta with Impossible bolognese. My friend also enjoyed her non-vegan food. Initially her fish was under-cooked, but they immediately changed it when we informed them."
Birthday Celebration,Suraj and the team at Burlamacco went above and beyond to make the birthday celebrations go without a hitch! From creating a special menu for 12 guests. Check out their BYO days as well which is really accommodating of them! The menu changes regularly so its a place I like to visit at least once a month!
Excellent service and food,Great food and service. Also loads of parking if you are going during the weekend. Would definitely be a restaurant that I’ll visit regularly during the weekends.
Nice decor and good food.,Really liked the interior of the restaurant and definitely relatable to the name. Food is excellent and menu well thought out.
Good food but service can be better,"First visit to the restaurant after it moved from Telok Ayer to Stanley street.
Food was up to expectations, albeit slightly salty for its seafood. Service can be better. Though it's understandable that a particular waiter/waitress is assigned to each table, they can help serve each other's table when one is busy and there is a table call."
"Great Italian food, knowledgeable staff, romantic ambience","During a weekday lunch - this place was crowded and i was glad i made reservations. Came here to celebrate a friend completing her postgraduate studies.

The menu had some Italian terminology that we didnt understand - but we asked the staff and he could explain everything to us in great detail (and with great enthusiasm).

We ordered Pasta - lobster pasta and a duck-stuffed ravioli - both were good: savory and cooked to perfection.

Dessert was tiramisu and a chocolate tart. They literally sent us to dessert heaven - i was scraping at the bottom of the dishes just wishing for a bit more.

The best part: AMEX love dining programme has huge discounts. 50% off if two adults dine from the a la carte menu :)"
great place to go for restaurant week,"food is good. missing the foie gras already, melting in your mouth. portion is reasonable but i do think the pasta is a little big. great service overall and is worth to go again."
Excellent Service and Food,The food was good and the service was excellent. Highly recommended restaurant. Will definitely revisit.
Was there for restaurant week.,"Was there for restaurant week. Food tastes quite good and prices were reasonable. The experience though felt rushed. They can’t wait to take our orders and the dishes were served in succession very quickly. From an ambiance and service perspective, this is definitely not fine-dining. Would still recommend it though - just for the food."
A Singaporean jewel in the Italian crown,"Italian in Singapore? We previously had a bad experience with an “up-scale” and “posh” Italian restaurant here and we were skeptical. Well, Singaporeans you have an undiscovered jewel in the Italian crown. An excellent restaurant is the combination of good service staff and an excellent chef and kitchen brigade. We spent many summers In Forte dei Marmi and enjoyed the sophisticated Italian cuisine of Tuscany. Gabriele Piegaia cooks with the finesse of his hometown of Lucca (Tuscany) in Singapore using local products. We ordered the Cozze (Pot-Cooked Black Mussels in White Wine & Tomato ‘Guazzetto’) and Battuta (Hand Chopped Raw Red Tuna Tartar Served with Avocado) for starters. The dishes were excellent. The main dish was a Filetto (Grilled Beef Tenderloin with Kenia Beans & Mashed Potato) with and without foie-gras ‘alla Rossini’. I ordered the dish without the mashed potato but with Truffle Fries (extra side order). My wife is a nightmare for the kitchen brigade, since she orders the filetto medium-to-well. This is the best test for the professionalism of the kitchen brigade, and the quality of the product. Zero failure, and excellent texture and taste. The meal was accompanied by a Brunello di Montalcino. The diner companions confirmed their previous good experience whilst ordering Carpaccio (Thin Slices of Raw Beef Tenderloin with Parmesan Cheese) and the Cozze, and as main dishes Cacciucco (Traditional Tuscan Fish & Seafood Stew with Garlic Bruschetta) and again the Filetto alla Rossini. The waiting staff decanted the two bottles of Brunello and it was another pleasant surprise. The glasses were the right size and format (important!) for a Riserva wine in order to taste the full bouquet with all your senses. The meal was finalized with a heavenly Tortino (Ginger Date Pudding with Toffee Sauce & Vanilla Ice Cream) and a lemon sorbet. We skipped the coffee and decided for a digestive of an excellent grappa. All in all a pleasant experience to get rid of the jetlag. I am a regular contributor to TripAdvisor and I have only given once 5 stars to Frans Wiget with his 18 Gault Millot restaurant Adelboden, Schwyz (Switzerland). Gabriel Piegaia and “Burlamacco Ristorante” is not ranked by Gault Millot or Michelin, but he deserves an incentive and support for the excellence of his cuisine and his staff. The only criticism would be the basic presentation of the dishes. There could be more finesse, decorative and abstract, emphasizing the ingredients. The essence is the taste and preparation, and that is excellent as it should be prepared in Tuscany. I therefore don’t understand his current ranking by TripAdvisor. Sure, it is not the posh environment for a star restaurant but give the talent of this chef, it deserves a top ranking. Shame!
The restaurant is worth a detour and a visit. My rating is 4,8 out of 5 and I can honestly recommend this treasure in Singapore. The 12% Singaporeans of my +48,000 readers, you will appreciate and love this restaurant. Unfortunately, I have to leave after the F1 but will surely make another visit in the near future."
Enjoyable dinner,"Made a booking for 2pax on a Friday night and the place was full when we arrived at 730pm. We were promptly attended to and brought to our table. The service staff (2 ladies- Grace & Rainbow) were pleasant and knowledgeable with their recommendations on the wine and food. We had a special squid ink pasta with crab meat, codfish and a bottle of red. The tab was reasonable. It was a pleasant evening."
"Good food, nice ambience and excellent service","We had lunch at Burlamacco. There were six of us, five of whom had the set lunch. One person ordered a la carte - a main dish. We were pleasantly surprised that she was given a complimentary soup on the house. I would recommend taking any pasta dish as the pasta is freshly made by the restaurant."
Amazed with the Quality & Service! Will def return,"Was a quite Monday night, but you could relate there were their regulars around. Had a business dinner which was simply superb- my partner was simply fulfilled with the vegetarian meal he had, lovely burata, truffle ravioli & a house special veg/tomato based pasta. Rainbow and the other Indian wait stuff took care of us very diligently with a smile at every pour of the wine and service. Great stuff- look forward to a return meal with the family!"
Great trattoria style Italian,"The service was excellent along with the food. Must orders include the tripe, burrata, pappardelle, tagliatelle"
"Great food, good ambience","Not my first visit to Chef Gabriel’s restaurant - the food quality has been up to expectations from previous visits.

Went with two friends to celebrate birthdays. The bottle of Sicilian wine we ordered was very good, the appetiser of Burata was excellent, as were the pasta that we ordered.

Service was friendly, exemplary and unobstrusive. They had even plated our shared dessert of tiramisu with a Happy Birthday message and a candle.

Definitely worth a visit, as it is one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore."
Great Sunday Brunch,The Sunday Brunch at Burlamacco is exceptional value for money. Great food and drink and helpful and friendly service. Why do so few people take advantage of it. More customers would improve the ambience.
Personalised service by the waiter,Very good care given by the waiter on standby. Always on the lookout to serve and exceed our expectations.
I have loved this place for years,"Fantastic Italian cuisine that really is an unsung local hero. Everything consistently tastes great, the chef’s clearly understand the cuisine well and I recommend it as a good date night place often. Jury’s out on the decor and might be a reason why they might get less walk-in business than they deserve."
Excellent experience,Service staff were great. Food tastes great. Price commensurates with the. quality of the restaurant
Food is more than meets the eye!,"I can't emphasise how pleased I was with the flavours and textures in my dishes despite the IG-unfriendly restaurant lighting. Everything was shiokalicious, from the Spicy Arrabbiata Sauce Linguine, Beef Short Ribs with Marsala Wine Sauce, to the Ginger Date Pudding with Toffee Sauce & Vanilla Ice Cream.

Food was served swiftly and at optimal temperatures too!"
Thumbs Up,"Had an opportunity to introduce Burlamacco to business colleagues and they were all impressed by the quality of food and service by Suraj was impeccable. Since it was BYOB Tuesday, we brought our own wines and Suraj and chef Gabrielle pulled a fine pairing with the wines. Started with portions of air flown burrata, followed by a spinach cream pasta that was simply delightful, a second pasta cooked with ragout, a beautiful piece of sea bass and completed with soft beef ribs. Everyone went home completely full and satisfied. As it was a Tuesday evening, we were able to get good service and food."
Dinner with friends,"Nice cosy restaurant. Food is good. The Chef is friendly & chatted with us. The waiter & waitress are great, friendly & great service"
"Excellent food, real Italian taste","Fantastic food cooked by Chef Gabriele.
It was superbe, and the service was great. Very friendly staff.
Lobster pasta: spicy and delicious
Clams with white wine garlic: a must!! Fantastic
Fish stew: great variety of different fishes/seafood cooked in a delicious tomato sauce
And finally a great tiramisu to share.
What a great dinner!
Graziella Gabriele"
Inventive cuisine,"There are so many Italian restaurants in Singapore we don't need another offering nothing but pasta with only the traditional pasta sauces and the usual appetizers. BURLAMACCO has always offered interesting dishes hardly seen elsewhere. Their tripe appetizer has been my favourite although it disappeared from the menu in the last 6 months. (I was happily informed that it would be making a comeback!) This time the menu offered a spinach cream pasta which is again a rare sight. It was very nice and a good deviation from the run of the mill pasta sauces. The Sicilian red wine on offer at $48++ was actually quite good and I would recommend it. I have been to BURLAMACCO many times, even before it moved to its current location, and its dishes have rarely disappointed."
Terrible customer handling skills,"I won’t publicly state how bad a restaurant’s food is, but not customer experience since that’s the least expectation and I pay 10% service charge on total bill. Here’re what I experienced with Burlamacco last night:

1. Chope promotion - I asked the waitress if the 10% discount voucher was still valid and she said yes. Then I told her why I saw “vouchers are available for purchase” in my upcoming reservation page but invalid when I clicked on the restaurant page. She said it’s handled by Chope and I had to ask them. Isn’t it a restaurant role to verify? And she didn’t apologise for such confusion.

2. Birthday special - I asked the waitress if there’s any birthday special such as complementary dessert. She said let me check and there wasn’t update until we paid the bill. I asked again as I realised she owed me a reply. After that, she said “since you asked for it, the Chef agreed to give a complementary lemoncello”. What? Such a phrasing! Not the exact but you get the idea! Frankly, I had contributed part of your restaurant’s March revenue, $251.90 for 3 pax.

3. Order taking - Please write down the order if you can’t remember by heart. It’s not nice to double check again.

@burlamaccosg You need to empower your waitresses on how to deal with customers.
Ask your waitresses to apologise first- customer comes first and yet you’re in service line. If they don’t know how to handle a customer, ask restaurant manager to help.

Lastly, as for food, there’re certainly other better options in town and even those nearby. With such experiences, do you think I’d come back for the recommended Pappardelle which I regrettably gave a miss initially? Also, the actual cacciucco turned out to be messy as compared to your IG’s tempting post - partly due to the head chef spending more time serving customers than working in kitchen? The worst is, how could you serve cold focaccia?"
Very good fuss-free Italian cuisine,"Have been here at least 3 times in the last 2 years and paid them a visit earlier this month for a Sunday lunch. The restaurant offers robust Italian cuisine.

Ingredients are fresh, dishes are competently executed and portions are hearty. I recommend the Tuna Tartar with Avocado, the Burrata, Angus Beef Short Ribs or Tenderloin and any of the seafood pasta dishes. My favourite pasta dish is the Cappelini as the seafood bisque-based sauce is at very well balanced and not overpowering in terms of flavor and/or consistency They have a good wine list selection. Desserts are safe and traditional a good way to end the meal but nothing too fancy. I do think their starters/mains are overall stronger than the desserts, as is usually the case for italian restaurants.

Service was pretty good and attentive and could not be faulted.

Love Dining programme benefits for Amex Platinum cardholders apply here to the ala carte menu.

We will definitely return."
BEST ITALIAN RESTAURANT IN SINGAPORE!,"From the first bite of an amazing burrata to the last bite of panna cotta, i was transported to Tuscany. The service was excellent, and the staff was friendly and welcoming. I was with a small group and had the opportunity to take a taste several dishes. Each dish was par excellence!!! I love this restaurant and highly recommend it."
Amazing find but an underwhelming visit,"Having been to Italian Restaurant numerous times, and since craving for one, my friend highly recommended the place to us for a catch up over lunch. Previously, I remember reviewing the service is attentive and the food being arguably the best Italian fare in the area. On this visit, however, we were somewhat underwhelmed. I wouldn't go so far as to say it was a mix emotion of a good and bad experience.

The staff (one tall guy and one lady - both are in black blazer) seemed to be welcoming upon our arrival, and I thought this was a really positive sign. However, the service for the rest of the afternoon was left unattentive after coming to us 2 times and knowing we are not ordering anything else from the menu (asides to the mains and drinks). Thankfully, this group of friends is being positive and somehow not affected by the servers.

A plus point of this restaurant is they serve really delicious food and upon payment at the counter, a chef came out from the kitchen and thank me for letting him know the food was excellent.

I'm not sure if this was just an off visit - the restaurant didn't have many tables to serve and didn't seem overly busy. It was quite disappointing to know that the impatient attitude towards customers was so obvious and as well the servers were somehow sales driven."
"new location, same great food, wine and service","always love coming here, the staff and chef always look after me and my guests good is always reliably tasty and filling highly recommended for lunch or dinner"
AMAZING ITALIAN FOOD!,"Visited this restaurant for the first time and the food was exceptionally good to our surprise. Their buratta was simply out of the world, actually one of the best that I have had and it is a must have to anyone that dines there. lobster tail arrabiata pasta was extremely delicious as well. I Will definitely be returning again. I am extremely impressed with the food."
"Nice ambience, good service","The ambience of the restaurant is nice. The service is also good. My angel hair pasta was excellent, although my friend's foie gras was a little over cooked."
"Wonderful Service, Food and Experience","My wife and I wanted to revisit our time in Italy and Gabriele Piegaia looked after us perfectly. The food was exquisite, the service was perfect and the atmosphere was excellent.

Gabriele looked after us personally and made sure our time in his ""Ristorante"" was perfect.

We will be going back every time we are in Singapore. A wonderful evening and his Lemonchelo was special."
Homely style and generous portions,"I ate at Burlamacco as part of a group booking. Conveniently located close to Telok Ayer MRT, the restaurant recently relocated to its current location in Stanley Street.

We ate on a rainy Monday night as part of a group booking.

The menu for dinner included anti-pasto, pasta and main options as well as desserts. We ordered starters to share and mains. The portion sizes were generous. I tried the parparadelle. The cod was large and looked good.

The wine list is mainly Italian, and included wine by the glass, bottles and magnums.

Overall a good value meal for a large group. Service was friendly, homely and not over the top."
"Good food, good wine","We had Parma ham wrapped mozzarella and grilled octopus for starters. Main courses were two kinds of pastas, beef and sea bass. Everything was great except the octopus. Although flavorful, the octopus was too soft for our liking. Both the red and white wine we had was great too."
Delicious Tuscany food with excellent service,"Recently relocated, the restaurant is now with brighter furnishing, wall full of interesting paintings and is much more cosy.
Enjoyed the triple egg poached in tomato sauce. According to chef Gabriele, this egg dish was his father’s signature dish. The bread to go with the eggs is crusty outside and soft inside.

The vongole angel hair is done to perfection with white wine garlic sauce. The Chianti house wine is perfect with the dish.

The friendly and talented Chef Gabriele is as chatty as his usual self. He never failed to delight us with his cooking."
"Perfect lunch: great service, delicious food","Went there a week ago with family for a day trip in Singapore. The food was really delicious (red tuna tartar, stew beef tripe, home made ricotta ravioli & pasta, crostata chocolate cake) with a great choice of wines. Mostly the service was perfect, friendly & very much attntioned. A must go place in Singapore !"
Excellent Food and superd hospitality! Great service and food!,"Visited this place many times. Always give me different feeling and really love going back! The Chef owner is an excellent character. Friendly and very lovable! Always wearing a sweet smile and welcome look! In a nutshell, Excellent Food and superd hospitality! Great service and food!"
An Italian restaurant worth going!,The food was fantastic and the service was great! Went there 2 days in a week! I love the ravioli in truffle sauce!!!
"Food is honestly above average, but worst service ever","I've been to Burlamacco thrice, because the place is close to my office and is convenient for after work dinner and drinks.

To say a word of fairness, the food isnt low quality for the price u pay, especially if you have a one for one offer on your credit card (Amex), and for the location. Food is not something to rave about, but on combination of ambience and location, sure it's somewhere you would go back for.

But the service is what I'm really here to comment on. I can safely say the place has the WORST SERVICE of any place I've been, and on the three times I came back, I was hoping for better (maybe different shift waiters etc). The service is exceedingly slow, sloppy, unhelpful, unprofessional, and most of all, the waiters and waitresses are downright rude and confrontational. You will spend an excessively long time waiting for your dish on a half-occupancy night, and ANY sort of attempt to ask about food or bread meets with something along the lines of 'this is a xxx starred restaurant' or 'we are not a roadside stall'. The staff sure act completely otherwise though.

In short, come here if you are prepared for a long wait, or come with friends if you are prepared to be treated like a low life (i.e. NOT drinks with your boss/client/significant other/date). The place will embarrass you. You will not leave feeling happy, and you will most certainly NOT look good to whoever you have brought with you. It is worth going to experience their service standards BEFORE you bring anyone important to the place."
Terrible service let’s down a good restaurant!,"Waiters in private conversation at corner of restaurant when we needed attention. Waved for them. Waited for their conversation to finish. Waved again, trying to distract them with other guests looking at me and looking at them, still ignored. Few minutes later got up walked over to them and asked for assistance personally.

They abruptly stopped their ongoing private conversation and proceeded from the back of the restaurant to the front, looking as if they were naughty school kids being caught out. Later asked for assistance again with menu, waiter passed me, and said “do you mind if I help you later”.

I’d just had enough! I got up paid the bill and left. My and my guests will never ever return to this place!"
Amazing food and service,"Amazing food, amazing service. Special shout out to Suraj for his impeccable service and lovely surprise!"
Bad service,Food is good but service is disgusting that makes our first dining experience there very uncomfortable
One star service,"Food is good but poor service in such a Italia restaurant ❗️We are the regular customer here but first time requested by the waiter to put the used tissue on the plate for him when he was clearing the plate ❗️becos he don want to touch the used tissue‼️ isn’t that your job to do it ⁉️ There is so many good restaurants out there, will think to b bk here again"
"Excellent food, disgusting service","I’ve been to Burlamacco on a couple of occasions before, and never have I had service as revolting as that which I’d received today. From the outset, our waiter was condescending in his tone, emphasising (and I quote), that he has ‘a very full restaurant’, and that he ‘has a kitchen to run’, when all we wanted to do was to order some sides to share, ON TOP of the main courses that we have already chosen. I’d understand his outburst if we didn’t want to order mains, or shared a main between two people - but that was not the case. Everyone had their own main course and yet we received such scorn and disdain for no good reason. Unfortunately, the manager was no better. She was cold and unfriendly, and worse, did not even have the decency to replace used cutlery with new ones, but instead asked that I reused cutlery from my previous course for the next. That would all be well and good, had the waiter not boasted: ‘we are not a bistro, we are a Michelin-style restaurant’. Indeed, the kitchen is top-notch. One would be hard-pressed to find good, hearty Italian food at this price range in Singapore. The food was impeccably cooked, served piping hot, bursting with flavours. However, any meal at a restaurant of this alleged, self-proclaimed calibre should know that a dining experience is made up as much of food quality as it is service standards. The greatest pity is that the latter has completely failed the former. What an absolute disappointment. I will never be returning to Burlamacco again."
Just an average set lunch,"Returned to Burlamacco for another set lunch after a long absence. The food was ok but not that exceptional and the service, whilst efficient enough, somehow lacked feeling. I was left feeling a little underwhelmed. On the plus side there was no extra charge for bread or iced water."
Disappointing food and service,"Visited this restaurant with high expectations after reading the reviews online. We were a group of 3 and ordered the grilled octopus, duck and fish platter. Octopus arrived first and it was cold, wet and chewy and just plain disgusting. Sent it back after one bite. Duck and fish was also semi cold and average tasting. It was 9pm and we were starving so we just nibbled on the mains and left. Service was average. We were choosing between the Merlot and Pinot Noir and the staff said we could order the Pinot if we like drinking water??? Whattt!!! Such a strange comment. Perhaps he was trying to crack a joke? No idea but my first and last visit and I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone even if the dishes are at half price promotion."
Dinner at Burlamacco,"We booked the Burlamacco via Eatigo. The restaurant is on an old Singapore house with the long shape and an opening at the middle of the house. The restaurant is very nicely decorated. The opening is converted into a skylight window. Comfortable seats, ambient is nice.

We ordered the Red Tuna Tartar, Tomato soup, slow cook beef short rib, beef tenderloin and a pear tart dessert with hazelnut ice cream. The Red Tuna tartar is so-so. The slow cook beef is good, soft and tasty. The beef tenderloin is good too. But the restaurant clearly under-staffed. The staff are trying their best to provide great services but is under staffed."
Great team dinner,"Chef Gabriele and Suraj and team took great care of us last night. Our team of 10 enjoyed the food, ambience and service. The large table at the back worked perfectly for us and the customised menu ensured that everyone was satisfied. Thanks again to the Burlamacco team for making our team dinner a success."
Great (but austere) Italian Restaurant in Singapore,"I went there by myself in a quite monday night. Most of the restaurant are closed in that day. The atmosphere is a little bit to serious and the guys there should try to smile a bit more. Sometime people think that more austere means more classy. Beside this, food was really good. i am italian, I often miss pasta when I travel and I am often disappointed by the italian cuisine i find overseas. This is not the case, I wanted a quick dinner, I had ""involtino"" pan roasted mozzarella wrapped with ham and ravioli together with a great glass of red new Zealandese wine. It all was good, the quantity of food is small for american standards but ok for europeans. Price fair for the quality of the meal."
Disgusted!,"Was snapped at by the waiter or manager? (he wore a suit) even before we sat down. There wasn't a signboard that asked customers to 'Please wait to be seated'. If there was, we would have waited there. There wasn't. So my daughter walked up to the guy who was at the cashier and requested a table for 3. This guy's response was something like 'Can't you see I am busy? Can't you wait?' & it was a talk down kind of tone...My daughter just turned 26 n we were there to celebrate her birthday. She was wearing a hoodie and probably cos of that this guy thought she was still a teenager and didn't respect her as a customer. (Still, one should treat all equally). I was right behind my daughter and I heard him. I was appalled n disgusted and felt that this kind of attitude was uncalled for. He might be busy but he could have been more polite. My daughter expressed her displeasure to the guy that she didn't appreciate this kind of treatment. He didn't even stop for one second to address this concern. He just said ' Sorry but I was busy with the bills' as he walked away. Same kind of tone and attitude. No sincerity felt in his 'sorry'...We left without eating and went to look for another place to dine. So what if the food was good? The service sucks despite a waitress coming up and trying to pacify us. That one star is for her. Thanks but no thanks! We won't visit here again. P/S I did not exaggerate any detail or fact."
Best Burrata cheese,The burrata cheese is excellent - really creamy inside. Book in advance to avoid disappointment. The set dinner was reasonably and good quality. Good service.
Amazing brunch,"Okay, we never write reviews, but from Elgin's warm welcome to the fabulous food and service, I don't know how you go to brunch anywhere else. Excellent value and the food was fantastic. The little onions marinated in balsamic... and the lobster pasta... oh my!"
Fine Dining with Ease,Celebrated belated birthday during Restaurant Week with excellent service with our special request. Very accommodating! The food is alright but could have been better. Maybe due to the limited choices that we chose during the Restaurant Week.
Good food but terrible service,"The food is good but you pay for it.

However the service is very poor. Rude staff who sneak food you didn’t pay for on the bill, bring food to the table you didn’t order, and treat you like trash once you have placed the order and they sense they won’t get any further money out of you. Also there is a clear difference between the level of service offered to women versus men."
Amazing Food,"Was invited to this lovely intimate restaurant by close friends and wow. The food was superb from the raw tuna starter with a magnificent burrata and Parma ham followed by the best home made pasta with a pork RAGU, outstanding.
Topped off with dessert of affagato. Best of all the serve by Suraj wonderful."
Dirty glass tumbler,"We were a party of 4 which had dinner on Sunday, 19 March 2018. The place was less than half filled but I expect edit to be since it was a Sunday night and its location was not exactly in a bustling food area.
The ambience was okay as it was quiet with sufficient lighting. The starters were quite substantial and the mains were too. There were only 2 men serving that evening but given that it was quiet, 2 sufficed and gave passable service.
The one incident which upset our party was the barely warm water provided and for one of our group, she found residue in the glass. The waiter or whatever he was, dismissed it as coming from the flask. There was no apology and no offer to replace it, if I recall correctly. Doubtful we will return to the restaurant."
Good Italian Food,Everything we ordered was delicious. From the tomato soup the Beef ribs. There only one slight issue I had. One of my friends was still on her 1st course when they brought out the mains simply because the other 2 has finished. Not quite right. But otherwise an excellent meal.
Company outing,"Had a really great night out here recently with my colleagues from our Singapore office, the host was very attentive and made every effort to make the night enjoyable,had a mixed platter to start, fresh tuns, octopus, a mozzarella type cheese which was to die for followed by a very good steak with a highly recommended red, would definitely recommend"
Great place for romantic night out,"Service of the staffs here is excellent!! Very attentive, helpful and friendly. Went there by purchasing chope vouchers at 30% off. The slow cooker beef short ribs in Marsala wine and chocolate tart are really good!"
Poor service and average food,"Came here for a Valentine’s Day dinner, whereby a set menu was prepared.

Firstly the food was quite average, and for the price range it was served there are plenty of better options in singapore, such as No Menu, or Dolce Vita or Laterria Mozarella

The service was also quite poor where they would clear the plate of one person who had finished when the other people on the table were still eating. We tried to use our survival chic card, which they said was valid here, but then they argued they didn’t agree to it on the phone.

Wine was the best part of the dinner, and that’s a shame for any restaurant.

It was quite disappointing and would not come back or recommend to anyone."
Recent visit,1) Beef short ribs was very tender and the chocolate tart was good! Cod fish and tiramisu was average. 2) Restaurant was small and cosy. 3) Waitress attitude has much room for improvement
Nice ambience,"On the whole, the food was quite good. Ambience is also nice. Service was also quite good. For a weekday night, it was rather quiet."
"Awesome food and services, as always","Went there for a birthday celebration on a quiet weekday evening.

As always, service was prompt and the sommelier is great for introducing an affordable bottle of Italian red that really goes well with the burrata cheese. Baby spinach salad is really flavourful and comes in decent portion. 48 hrs Stewed Short Ribs is well executed and Grilled Seabass was perfect too. Even the truffle fries is well fried with a good balance of the truffle oil.

Strongly recommended if you want straightforward Italian cuisine that is simple and great."
Burlamacco the magnificent,Nice food... great service considering only having 3 waiters... props to them! The discount voucher doesn’t apply to degustation but still very god value.
Second time not as good as the first.,"It was son's birthday and we took him to Burlamacco for a family celebration. The waiter refused to take a family photo using my wife's phone, stating he was too busy. Our water was not re-filled at all during the entire evening. The bread was stale. We are never going back."
Overpriced,Food was good but very small portion sizes. 28 SGD for two small mozzarella balls wrapped in prosciutto is a rip off. Pasta with tomato sauce way too heavy on the garlic. Steak was good but not enough mash and 6(!) measly beans is a joke. Would not go back. Even with the 30% voucher still not worth the price.
A pleasant dining experience!,"Loved the decor in the restaurant. The food and service were good and it was decently quiet to have a comfortable conversation. Service staff were attentive and polite. A meal for 2 persons with drinks will add up to $150 and above. Overall, it’s a good place to bring a date to for dinner."
Good overall experience,Every staff were exceptionally good world class. You dont get this in many even 5 star restaurants. Food was good bit rich so save this place for special occasion. Nice classy ambience. Wine pricey but good selection. Many Singaporean customers which for me is indication serves good food.
"Great ambience, decent food","Restaurant have a nice ambience, though caveat is that the ceiling is low hence may become noisy if there is crowd. We went during weekday lunch hence it was quiet & peaceful.

Burrata & Beef short rib is good. Lobster is fresh. Dessert wise is average. Overall decent food quality"
Great food,"Came here a couple of times, and food is always consistently good. Bread served during the start was warm and fresh as well. Service was efficient, though servers were not smiling and warm."
"Authentic Italian Cuisine, A hidden gem",A lovely and cosy environment for a romantic dinner. Celebrated my wife's birthday there and we loved the food and atmosphere. Service was impeccable and very accommodating.
Hidden Authentic Italian Restaurant Serving Classic Tuscany Cuisine,"One of the few Italian restaurants in Singapore that serves quality burrata, which is a must have dish for my every visit! The rest of the menu is certainly not any less impressive with a well curated selection of pasta, meat, seafood and dessert. Another hidden gem!"
A bit overpriced for what you get,"Burlamacco is a nice restaurant in the CBD area of Amoy Street. I consider it one of the better Italian restaurants. However, in a city now full of very decent ristoranti Italiani, the menu is solid, but a bit stale.
We'd ordered simple fares like the burrata and carpaccio, and some pasta. All of which were good, but not excellent.
The wine selection was good but a bit pricey. The staff were knowledgeable and friendly, perhaps a bit too friendly since at the end, we'd ordered only 2 digestifs for the ladies but were served 3. I told him I didn't want it as I was driving, he put it down anyways and said enjoy!
Then we were charged 3 limoncellos, which irked me a bit!
However, not wanting to make a big deal out of it, I feel it noteworthy for the review.
Overall, the food was good and the atmosphere typical of restaurants in the area. However, @ $510 for 3 for 2 bottles of wine, 2 starters and 2 mains and 3 digestifs, it's not good value for what you get. And that's problematic consider other ristoranti like Osteria Mozza have a great ambience, and similar service and food (if not better) for the same price."
