Fantastic place to eat and drink,"At Clarkes quay. What a wonderful place to wile away some time. Happy hour is 3pm to 7pm drinks are not cheap but the ambiance is excellent. The staff are helpful, friendly and cheerful. The food is just superb and I would recommend this bar to all who visit Singapore."
"Friendly service, delicious food","SQUE was next door to the hotel I was staying at.
I ate there several times for lunch, dinner and drinks in the last week of November.

They have great happy hour cocktails and a three-course lunch deal. All the food I tried was well prepared and tasty.

The staff were particularly friendly and looked after me well as a solo diner."
Fantastic food!!!,"We came by this place by accident and WOW!!! We had the ribs, chicken, soft shell crab and sirloin. All four of us simply could not fault anything at all. Meals very very generous, ribs so tender and tasty. HUGE chicken dish, almost a whole chook!!! Sirloin beautifully cooked and crab super tasty.

Service amazing, fast and friendly. Do yourself a favour and just go there, very reasonably priced also."
Amazing service,Go to Sque for great food and drinks but above all‚Ä¶. The service is perfect. Kris in particular waited on me like I was the queen. We will be back for sure
Travel with my friend,I love it The food is delicious I will comeback I love it The food is delicious I will comeback I love it The food is delicious I will comeback
Certainly worth a visit,Stopped here for a couple of drinks whilst walking around Clark Quay. The staff are friendly & accomodating. Beer was cold and reasonably priced. Certainly worth a visit
Happy hour,"Great service, we came for happy hour and had a great time. Would recommend while staying in the Clarke Quay area, go for the Singapore Slings!"
great service and food,"Decided to stop here after a long morning of walking in the heat.
service was quick and friendly, decided on the 2 for 1 drink specials, coronas then next went for the Singapore slings..hit the spot.
We tried the calamari rings with the fries promo..all very nicely done..
Good spot looking at the river.
SGD $62.40 all up"
Riverside gem,Very attentive service and fast! Beautiful location highly recommend! One for one drinks happy hour from 11.30 to 8.30 very attractive
Great place to meet friends in the evening,"We had a table for 4 for drinks and snacks after work. Very relaxed environment, with great views across the river. Drinks were very reasonable, with an interesting (and long) 2 for 1 Happy Hour. Food was good, mainly western snacks and mains - we had the pork knuckle which was excellent."
Disappointed,"Food was ok only. As burger was dry . Senior waitress wasn‚Äôt really happy while serving . The worst part they charge for water . When I asked why the answer was,‚Äù because customer keep on asking for water and service again and again. If we charge for water they will not ask.‚Äù
Well then don‚Äôt charge us SERVICE CHARGE .
Won‚Äôt be going again"
Good spot for quick lunch,"Family lunch on aver quiet Sunday. Fish and chips, tuna salad, clams and quesadillas . All good - happy hour as well so good value on the drinks and meals. Great service and river views.."
Cool,From the minute you arrive to when you are seated you are looked after so great plus the view and location. Especially as there is so much competition but they win and good is super.
Good time spent with friends,"Had visited for the first time, I found it average place, we sat outside and it was too hot and humid, there were no fan or cooling options Food was average as well"
Must Try!,"Food was YUMMY, service good, location very nice opposite River next to Central Mall. Will surely return for more:)"
Sweet vibes at a great price.,"Love this place. They've got Guinness on tap, a smoking area with a great view of the river, and last but certainly not least, KARL. What a doll! So personable and just such a joy to have around."
"Good happy hour, friendly, helpful staff, great location","A great place to chill out by the river, 2 for 1 beers during happy hour with friendly attentive staff - well worth a visit."
"Fair Prices, Good Food, Excellent Service","In a country where you have to rely on Happy Hour to keep costs down, the HH at Sque runs nearly all day. The pastas are good, the pepperoni pizza is surprisingly close to NYC standards, and it's the only place I've tasted true caesar salad dressing since moving here. (The prawn fritters with chipotle mayo are sneaky good too).

Most importantly, the service is ON POINT. The staff works exceptionally hard and is attentive and alert. They are genuinely friendly and accomodating. They are polite but not fake. The beer is always cold and the food comes out promptly.

The location is great--on the quiter side of the riverbank. Still there is plenty of foot traffic that makes for great people-watching. You can judge all the motivated runners and cyclists while you enjoy your beer and comfort food."
Delicious food and nice atmosphere.,"Delicious food, nice environment and good services. Recommend snack platter come with juicy beef cube and crispy chicken wing. And cocktail LYCHEE MOJITO."
Nice place to sit while wife goes shopping!,"Dropped in here to have a few beers and snacks while my wife went shopping and had her nails don in the shopping mall. Waited ages to get severed but once I was on their radar all was good. great chicken satay, and 2 for 1 beers!"
Great burgers,Our arrival accidentally but luckily coincided with the start of the late happy hour (9pm?). We each had a glass of red wine accompanied by an enormous burger and chips. Fabulous food. Very friendly and chatty waiter who stepped in to advise on the best accompaniments to our respective burgers.
Nice bar with good food opposite Clarke Quay,I always thought of this place as a pub or drinking place - and it is that but we decided to eat here on our last night in Singapore and found the food to be surprisingly good. We were served by 2 different waitresses one of whom was a bit full of herself but the other was just delightful. We had prawn fritters and pork knuckle - very tasty and it turned out to be more than we could eat. The fact that you can sit outside in the breeze and take in the lights and sounds of Clarke Quay is a bonus!
Not such a happy revisit in January 2020,"Had a great experience on our previous visit, but unfortunately this visit wasn't a pleasant experience.
The burgers were very ordinary & quite tasteless,the Caesar salad was average,at best.
The waitress who served us was OK but keen to upsell rather than listening to what you were asking for.
Sadly that will be our last visit there as Singapore has a lot of great eating places that caters to any budget & taste."
Food was fantastic great burgers,Food was fantastic the burgers were cooked to our liking and using fresh ingredients soft drink and beers are very cold. Service overall was excellent next to the river just enjoyable will be back again with a large group Thanks üôè
Great service,"Great food and wine,good price and really friendly, highly recommend , Clarke quay central location."
Wonderful dinner in SQUE,"We (a group of ex colleagues)have our annual meet up @ SQUE at Clark Quay.
The restaurant is as always crowded hence it is recommended to make reservation.

We ordered (1) SQUE Platter (2) Seafood Platter (3) Bacon & Egg / Margharita Pizza
(4) Nicoise Salas (5) Festive Platter
(6) Clams (7) Fish & Chip.
The service was efficient & food & drink was served pretty fast. It was big kudos to the serving team & special shout out to Mr.Heyden.
The food taste as delicious as we can remember. My personal favourite is the Bacon & Egg pizza & clams soup.
My colleagues enjoyed Erdinger & Weiser Beer the most. The restaurant also serving 1 for 1 Mocktail all night long..

It was a wonderful evening to catch up with friends & enjoying the good food.
We will be back :)

Forgot my credit card,"I went to SQUE after a long flight to Singapore from Copenhagen I had some really good chicken sticks there and afterwards I accidentally forgot my credit card.

The staff was so nice and kept my credit card safe which saved my entire vacation, I offered the staff $100 for giving me back my credit card which they insisted on not taking.

I have no words for how nice and happy I was to get my card returned"
54 üá∏üá¨ üéÇ 9 August,The food is quite nice. Very relax place. Price average Ê≤°ËÆ°ËæÉ. A pretty good place for small group gathering facing Singapore river. Some drink are 1 for 1 offer until 11.00pm daily.
"Tasty, good value food!","We dined here again during our most recent visit to Singapore and once again, we were not disappointed.
It was early in the evening when we arrived and despite it being ‚Äúhappy hour‚Äù, we were able to score a table overlooking the Singapore River. Despite it being a very warm and humid night, the gentle breeze off the river and the overhead fans made dining conditions very pleasant.
Service by the attentive staff was friendly and fast with advice readily provided on menu items and happy hour drinks deals.
Our meals of a chicken burger with fries for her and a beef burger and fries for him were tasty and very filling. The selected drinks of beer and soft drinks were served ice cold and quickly replenished as part of the happy hour deal, when needed.
We were very happy that we had chosen to dine here yet again. The food was tasty and good value for money. The happy hour drink deal, being two for the price of one, for certain drinks was excellent value.
We will certainly return for another meal and drinks next time we visit Singapore. Highly recommended!"
Casual Dining at it's Best,"One of my favourite eating places on my many visits to Singapore. SQUE is perfectly situated on a balcony overlooking the Singapore River opposite Clarke Quay. It is outdoors, under cover, with gentle breezes off the river. Trees provide shade from the evening sun. If the humidity of Singapore gets too much there are indoor airconditioned dining areas (I have never used them).

The menu includes pasta, pizza, and meat and seafood mains. There is a good range of international beers. Happy hour extends for much of the opening hours and provides BOGOFs on promoted beers, including the ubiquitous Tiger.

The staff are friendly and efficient. Service is quick without feeling rushed. The food is consistently good - my favourite is the deliciously spicy spaghetti arrabbiata with added chicken - and the portions reasonably generous.

The venue seems popular with both locals and tourists and has a great vibe."
Nice place for a drink with friends,I was visiting Singapore for a few days and caught up with some friends here. I really enjoyed the buy 1-get-1 concept. Relaxing atmosphere good location.
Good food,We ate here three times during our stay. The margarita pizza was the best I have ever had. Thin crispy base with slices of tomato on top. Happy hour was also a good deal. Very friendly staff.
"Great food, great location.","Had dinner here 1 night. Location is really good, food and service was very good. Great choice of food available."
Lunch special!,Wife and I stopped in on a Thursday in May around half past noon. Had the lunch menu Beef sandwich with fries. 9.95 SGD. and the buy one get one free Stella pint. Really good. And big. Wife had the pizza. Delicious. Paper thin crust. Crispy. She had a buy one get one free bourbon and coke. 60 SGD total. Right on the water across from Clarke Quay.
Super,Always a good happy hour time They even have smoking areas where you can drink and smoke Perfect staff and prices are ok for this kind of location
Always Happy Hour at Sque,"The food is ok and good value! The drinks, including the Singapore sling, are virtually all available on the 2for1 happy hour deal virtually all of the time!"
A very good location and good food,"We visited for a late lunch. We were served by Wendy W. The server was very knowledgeable and also wanted us to get the best value and best food. The ambiance was great. Eating al fresco with a large sail above to protect from the heat and rain should it start!!! All in all, good food, nice staff and a great location on the river, hard to beat."
dinner,friendly service and decent food. restaurant faces the river. great place to chill out. will definitely return.
Friendly,"We stopped in for most of our evening meals, the staff were friendly and as I required a gluten free meal we this easy to get, and the food was lovely. I felt confident eating here! With a great variety as well. Everything we had was very enjoyable."
Fantastic,"We ate there before going on a cruise and when we returned after 20 days we were surprised the staff remembered us. We found the food was great with a varied choice, we tried a variety of dishes from the menu. The drink's list is also varied with a selection of beers, wine, cocktails cool drinks, coffee etc. The staff 'Dan, Chris and Noel' - what can I say except ""Very helpful, friendly, lovely to chat with (time permitting)"" Thankyou for looking after us Bob & Linda."
Enjoyable.,"We dropped in for a late night snack and drink before heading back to our hotel. The two of us shared 3 entree style items. Food was good, as was the service. A good place for eating, drinking and people watching."
River side bite,"Had a quick bite here twice during the week. Decent food at decent value. Drinks, beer and a burger with views of the river. Good place, good food and good service"
Great restaurant,"Overlooking the river on Clarke Quay, Sque restaurant is well worth a visit. The pizzas are thin crust and full of flavour, the prawn paste wings are just to die for... crispy outside but juicy as on the inside. I have had several meals here and they have all been exceptional.

The staff are very friendly, prices are very reasonable and happy hour seems to go all day!! What more do you want??"
River view only plus,"Don‚Äôt know what all the hype is about this place. We went there for an early evening light meal, following all the great reviews

The plus point was the table overlooking the river and being able to people watch and see the bum boats go by.

The happy hour waiter put pressure on to buy more drinks than we wanted and they were always hovering wanting us to order food. We ordered a Caesar salad with tuna which was mostly a bowl of lettuce and a wrap which allegedly had mozzarella lettuce and salmon in it. The salmon was evident, but the cheese virtually non existent and not very appetisingly presented.

We were then rushed from our table and even before completing payment a reserved sign had been placed on the table

Don‚Äôt bother with this place it is just a fast food outlet with unfriendly wait staff"
Great spot,"Had a mixture of small plates for dinner, all very tasty and accompanied by a 1 for 1 deal on drinks. Staff very attentive and great spot to people watch in the evening"
Very good location,"The restaurant is in a very good location on Clarke Quay. Good price, service could have been a lot better."
Great place ....,"Visited on two occasions & found service & food to be really good. We were fortunate that Noel looked after us on both days, we found him cheerful, friendly & really attentive, clearly able to ‚Äòmanage‚Äô the place‚Äôs smooth running very well. Fairly priced meals that were varied & able to suit all tastes. Loved the happy hours as well!!"
nice view ..at a price,"Lovely terrace overlooking Clarke's Quay . Good choice of food and drinks , but like all over this part of Singapore you are going to overpay for what you get...!"
Lunchtime meal and drink,Popped in with family. Had a lovely experience watch the boats go pass. Food was good britsh menu which was a nice change considering we have been eating asian for last 2 weeks. Happy hour gave us 2 for 1 drinks. Staff very pleasant and we didn't have to wait for service. A nice place to relax at lunchtime
Rude Staff,"Popped in here to have a drink with my girlfriend whilst visiting Clark Quay. Stood around for ages and there was no one to show us to a table, so we sat down on one. Took ages to get the waiters attention and when we did manage to the waiter came slammed the menu on the table and walked off. Not so much as a hello. None of the staff seemed interested in the customers."
Atmosphere and mocktails,We managed to score a table at 6:30pm on a Friday night and the atmosphere was great. We had great food and service. Mango mocktail was delicious and on the happy hour list. 14 month old loved it too. Be sure to catch the laser show around the corner in Boat Quay 8/9/10pm.
"Great food, good service, good value","Lovely food, very good value, I had the satay burger (with cheese & fries obviously) My husband had the beef burger and they were both very good value, good service and great spot to watch the goings on"
Perfect place in CQ,"I came many times to have diner of have a drink. All the team is perfect, good service, good food (you have to go and test the pizza pepperoni). Not so expensive for Clarke Quay. Happy hour every days... perfect for an afterwork with my french team :)"
Good value. Friendly service,Casual dining. Good prices. Friendly staff. Nice location by the river. Would recommend for lunch or dinner.
Great spot,"First place we go to in Singapore. Few cold beers and a plate of Nachos while we watch the world go by. Brilliant position by the river, Noel and his team make you so welcome! We‚Äôll be back!"
Good find,"Round corner from Clarke Quay MRT stop. Overlooking river. Happy hour 11.30am until 7 pm then again from 9pm. 2 drinks for price of 1. Didnt eat but food looked good. Great place to unwind. Follow boat quay signs out of MRT. Good selection and of beers, wines local and international. Great service."
Raw Chickenüò≥,"Visited for 2nd time in 2 days (first day had great beef burger & very reasonable prices as buy one beer get 1 free) but on second occasion served a chicken burger that was TOTALLY RAW the whole way through the middle! Only discovered after cutting through middle (hopefully this saved me from potential severe food poisoning) changed my meal after I showed burger to waiter without complaints and had beef burger that was fine that I was given free when I checked bill, but could have been potentially fatal if eaten so feel this needs raising to all please cut whole way through food before eating!"
Going home,"We have been to Sque a few times. Everytime we are in Singapore. The food is excellent and the staff, very helpful and friendly. The all day happy hour is also a plus. It is in a great location and highly recommended."
Fantastic meals,Have visited Sque a number of times over that past few years and the service and quality of the meals has always been fantastic. We look forward to visiting again next time we are in Singapore
1for1 beer with great view,"In addition to the 1for1 beer during Happy Hour, you can chill out with friends overlooking Riverside/Singapore River at the same time."
Great spot on the quay,"We visited this place once just for drinks and once for dinner. Both times were really impressed by the service and staff members. The food was great quality and full of flavour. We had pizzas, pasta and a burger and all of us finished our meals and were fully satisfied. A much better spot for families or those who don‚Äôt want the chaos of the opposite side of the river. Not cheap but certainly not over the top expensive. Good selection of beers and cocktails were sensational."
Great spot to have a beer and people watch!,"Never ate there but most evenings on my stroll, I would stop there for a beer and the wife would have a glass of wine. Three are good views of the river too! You get 2 for 1 on the drinks. Service is pretty efficient and the place is pretty busy!"
Great Site,"We liked this place. Great view over Clarke Quay, perfect for watching the world go by and with HappHour making the drinks a reasonable price couldn‚Äôt beat it. Staff couldn‚Äôt do enough for us."
Nice place facing Clarke quay !,"Warm welcome, not a lot of people today for lunch Nice menus, international food discount for each day Something like 14‚Äì15S$ for a lunch It is good ! Calm terrasse with good music"
Nothing much,"This place is quite pricey and the food is not worth it. Had the chicken hamburger which completely fell apart and the fries were served without any sauce (not even Ketchup). They do have a buy-one-get-one of Mocktails during lunch, which was the only good thing in my experience.
Overall - there are way better places to eat by the river at the same price or lower."
Amazing View,"Clarke Quay's colorful buildings are seen from the outdoor restaurant, and the place makes you feel in Europe rather than in Asia. The staff is nice and the food is super good. The prices are high, but, well, it's Singapore :D"
Family night out along Clarke Quay river front,We had family dinner and fun time drinking at this restaurant along the river front food is great location along the river with outdoor dinner across the river from Clarke Quay next to a mall.. very convenient from our hotel I recommend this restaurant for a family night out and fun time
Great fish and chips,Good fish served in a crispy batter with well done chips and a small salad. Pleasant location and adequate service for such a busy restaurant in a great location.
Drinks and Lunch,"We stopped here for drinks before our river cruise, special of S$13.40 for two beers. Served chilled in chilled glasses, refreshing Tiger. We later stopped for lunch, soft shell crab for my wife while I opted for the 220g beef burger with fries. A couple of soft drinks and bottled water and we were satisfied. Good views of the local action as we relaxed. Recommended."
Cauliflower Manchurian,"We stayed in Chinatown in Singapore for 11 days and discovered this fabulous eatery only 5 minutes down the road. Great spot to sit and enjoy the evenings. It's right on the river @ Clarke Quay. Happy hour is a must. Try their 'Singapore Sling'. We discovered their Cauliflower Manchurian and will never think cauliflower is a boring vegetable ever again. It is divine. Great service, great food and reasonably priced."
Drinks here,"We had drinks here by the river , very pleasant , as Singapore is expensive for alcohol this place has 2 for the price of one and we took advantage of that offer . I have eaten here and it was good but not this time , I recommend this place"
Holiday lunch,"Just passing and stopped for lunch, nice cool breeze off the river, two for one on drinks even better, the waitress was very friendly and helpful, order three appetisers to share came quickly and tasted good, all in all very good, for ¬£30 great."
Happy happy hour!!,Great place to enjoy a peroni and escape the heat. Friendly and most accommodating hospitality. It will definitely be on our go-to list in Singapore.
SQUE Rotisserie & Bar,"Great place by the river at Clarke Quay.
Food choice good all cooked in the open kitchen so you know it is all fresh.
Okay for lunch or dinner.
Beer choice also good especially during happy hour(s) when it's buy one get the same for free.
Staff are really friendly and helpful, would recommend this place to all."
Drinks with a View,Good alcohol deals in an awesome spot overlooking Clarke Quay. Didn‚Äôt eat anything there but it looked like a wide array of choices. A good spot for a few lazy afternoon drinks.
The best place for food and drinks,I have been coming here for 4-5 yrs. Prices have remain the same. Good quality of food and drinks. A must visit for all!!
One of the best,"During this trip I have enjoyed happy hour two beers for cost of one, I had the chicken skewers, steak and pizza, all of which were of good quality, hot and well presented. Service was excellent, super attentive staff, cost wise much the same as most venues in the area. I think it is a little more laid back than the other side of the river."
This completes our honeymoon in SG,This restaurant is sooo awesome! Good are pretty amazing! Very kind staffs and they have a really good beers and cocktails! The the view near this restaurant is sooo awesome! I will recommend it to everyone! I love this place!
Great staff,"Visited Singapore and wthe as advised that Sque was worth a visit. Went there for a drink ended up buying a meal as well,good prices. Members of staff were amazing, as soon as a better table became available we were asked if we wanted to move. Highly recommended!"
Good burgers,"Visited Sque twice during our stay. Good selection of cold beers and ciders. Excellent waiter service, very friendly and chatty. Recommend the burgers, costs extra for fries, egg, bacon etc but was worth it."
Sunday Lunch,"Nice place to have Sunday Lunch. Their burgers are pretty good, the prices are a bit expensive as you have to pay extra for the fries"
Great service and good food and beer,Stopped here for burgers and beers - well looked after by great staff and the food was very good. exactly what we were after. Recommend
Light lunch and cold beers,"Sque was close to our hotel and the beers were half the price (as long as you took the 1 for 1 deal and had 2). Good lunch food, good service and a nice outlook over the river with all the action. Went back a couple of times during our stay."
Can‚Äôt beat this place,"We visited Sque four times during our recent Singapore holiday. Everything was first class. The view across the river and the whole atmosphere is fantastic. The food is superb and the happy hours are just brilliant. The service from all the staff is amazing, but I must give special mentions to Noel, George and Chris......they go above and beyond. We will definitely visit Sque again on our next trip to Singapore."
Great service,Great service. Noel was friendly and attentive - definitely an asset to the business. Provided local and international knowledge. We returned repeatedly as we enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff. Would return again when in Singapore. All other staff we came into contact with were great.
good dinner,"A group of friends and I had a very nice dinner here on 24th June , I had read about this place on TripAdvisor , we were staying at the Furama so it was a short walk , we had to ask twice to find the place as directions aren‚Äôt clear"
"Cold beer, good choice of food","Most of the seating for Sque is outside, so not the best place for lunch (hence we sat inside). Burgers and beer for lunch was the right choice. Service was friendly and prompt, food was satisfactory. All in all average but serviceable"
Steak,"The worst steak I have eaten in Singapore. Tough, bland. Service average. Burger is much misrepresented than shown on the menu. It's looks like more of a drinking house than an eating place."
Alway good food and service,"My husband and I were here three nights in a row last week when we stopped over In Singapore on our way home to Australia. We also ate and drank here two years ago when we again stopped over. The food and and drinks are always good and great service by Dan Dan Jong, she looked after us very well, we were never without a drink and we enjoyed some friendly banter."
Dinner with a Client,"Had dinner here with my Japanese client. The food was good. My perosnla favourite is the crispy beancurd and the meatballs starters which i recommend.

The pizza was also awesome. The price is abit on the hugher side but you get quality out of it. Portion-wise its somewhat average too"
Great food and service,"Every trip to Singapore includes a visit to Sque. Noel always remembers us even if we haven't been there for more than a year.
We've been coming for 7 years now and are always looked after very well.
Always happy hour deals and extensive menu to choose from.
Our next trip to Singapore will include a night of dining at Sque. Great food and a great view right on the river."
Amazing night!,"Thanks for being our service provider Mr. Sing Thai, unforgettable experience, very detailed and great service ever. Amazing professional service. Looking forward to eat and drink in this place."
Great first time visit,"Noel and his staff at Clarke Quay made us very welcome and kitchen provided good food especially the chocolate fondant, burgers good, beers of different nationalities. great job people"
Quality without emptying your wallet.,"Situated on Darling harbour amongst all it's vibrancy, especially in the evening.
A type of restaurant that perhaps you would pass by as it is just your average looking terrace type but was enticed in by their offering for Happy Hour drinks. Certain beers and house wines, get two for the price of one.
Tables and chairs are outdoor patio style, no table clothes or fine tableware but very clean and well patronised by both locals and tourists.
Menu choice was very good, Asian and Western and there are daily specials. We were there Tuesday so it was Pizza special (can't remember exact price but it was very attractive and almost tempted us to order that, perhaps $10.00 instead of $18.00). Tuesday is also 20% off main meals so I ordered Lamb Shank and my wife Fish and Chips, Pint of London Pride beer and a Shiraz (so two each because of two for one)
Meals were served in a reasonable time and were of decent size portion and quite tasty and well presented, the wait staff come and set your table with table mat and cutlery while you are waiting.
Great choice of craft beers by the bottle as well as the London Pride on tap and the usual Tiger and few others.
Service is good but not exceptional by any means.
We were quite relaxed here though, nice atmosphere and general ""throng"". Had a craft beer by the bottle and a large sparkling water as well.
All up with 7% GST the bill came to Sing $103.60 so I gave them $110- and said they could keep the change. (Tipping is not expected in restaurants in Singapore but I was feeling a little generous after the drinks.)
As I said, about AUD $50.00 a head for decent meal each, three beers, two wines and a water, not bad for Singapore which can be a bit expensive.
Asian type dishes were a lot cheaper."
Best waiter - George,"We drank Brothers Toffee Apple cider and by the time we were done, we had made a brother. If providing good service is an art, George is Picasso."
Yet another excellent visit,"SQUE remains my favourite watering hole in Singapore.

I visit Clarkes Quay for a few days every year or so. I always try a few other bars but after trying them I always settle back to SQUE.

Excellent choice of international beers served properly and at a reasonable price. Food straightforward, well prepared and tasty. Staff friendly and helpful. Great for people watching and overlooks the river directly.

More than happy to return."
Last meal in Singapore,"Dropped in for our last meal in Singapore , so glad we did. Meal was plentiful, service was quick and friendly - Beers were cold.. Not much else you could want ... Thank you to all. :-)"
Pre cruise 2018,Enjoyed meeting George & the food we had was very very tasty. Not pushy when we were undecided & gave us another option. Beer nice & cool & water for free unlimited. Thank you.
"Nice views, food and beer",Its located on the quieter bank of Clarke Quay. It has good outdoor seating where you get views of the entire area. They are average priced and the food is decent. Nothing very exotic but basic continental cuisine at average prices.
Our Go-To Place for Beers with a Great View,"We stayed at a nearby hotel and found Sque to have the best Happy Hour prices & hours, beer selection, view and service. We absolutely loved the German Dunkel! The view can't be beat as you can relax riverside and watch the river boats float by - also a great location for people watching! We visited on several occasions during our week long stay and did eat dinner one night, which was very good. I had the Steak Sandwich which was amazing, and my husband had the Hamburger which he said was pretty good. Loved this place!"
