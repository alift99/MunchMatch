"Intimate, Date Night Dining","Intimate dining setting in a vintage vibe. Highly recommended for date night. Food is superb, service is impeccable. Fabulous cocktails by their in-house celebrity bartender Rizwan (Botak). Had all our meals here during our 2-night Luxe Sarang (Rm21) stay at Villa Samadhi on 20Jan 2023 during the long CNY weekend. Every visit to the restaurant was wonderful and enjoyable.

Special thanks to Momma Helen, Rose, Joanna, Tsai, Rizwan for the lovely dining experience.

We will see you again soon!"
Great atmosphere for gathering,"Had my rom + wedding reception there during covid in 2021.
It was a nice cosy environment, the service is great! I had everything I wanted!
The event planner was Sarah. She was so responsive and always replied to me in time. There were SO MANY regulations during that period, Sarah really helped us ease our nerves in handling all of those!!!

Highly recommend here if you want to have a small and intimate event.

Thanks Sarah for all the help we got!"
Sunday Afternoon Brunch,"Relaxing late morning leading to early afternoon brunch with attentive service. Lots of small plates, tasty and flavourful, free flow beer and bubbles (cocktails available too), made this a perfect Sunday out in Labrador Park in gorgeous surroundings. Great way to spend Sunday, thank you to all the staff."
Nice location,"Was here for an event so readers should take that into account.
Location is a bit out of the way if you are in the CBD but surroundings are worth the trip. Like I said I was here with a very large groups of people. Staff were rushed off their feet most of the time with one side of the table not getting any rice, plus a long wait for drinks at the bar. The food wasn't really that good as it lacked heat, again this could have been sue to the mix of the people there. That said I have had better Thai without the need to travel to Labrador Park and the faults would not put it on my immediate try again list."
"Unprofessional, sesnselessn behaviour","I had made advanced reservation for a special 80th birthday celebration. There was no objection from the staff I talked to.

As overseas guests were invited, I called up 4 days in advance to ensure that the reservation was in order.

However, I was told that the restaurant did not have record of my reservation and it couldn't accommodate me as it was full house on the day of the celebration. I explained my booking history and sought the restaurant's help. Another staff called back later and assertively alleged that I had given the wrong information; that I called the wrong number belonging to the hotel (Samadhi) and that I spoke to staff who are part timers etc and not to him. In short, senselessly blaming me for everything that led to the lapse.

He missed the fact that the number I dialed (6929 2100) was listed on the website as the reservation number for Tamarind Hill and I had spoken to a staff who had answered my call and acknowledged the reservation.

Unfortunately, instead of apologizing, this staff showed no desire to help or listen and accused me for the error. To add salt to wound, he hung up the phone on me while we were still talking. I called back immediately but the line remained engaged for a while.

His rudeness prompted me to request repeatedly that he or a manager return my call. The staff I made my request to happened to be the person who booked my reservation. She agreed that it was totally their fault and not mine. Till this day, I have not received any call from any staff even though I was informed the manager “will call” me.

Its incredulous that an “award-winning restaurant” under a ‘luxury boutique hotel” will offend customers by unjustifiably blaming them for reservation oversight, being rude to them and making themselves uncontactable with no follow up action despite my requests to address issues or make amends. Such behaviour shows how little it cares and how undeserving it is of any good rating."
Extremely unprofessional behavior,"Very unprofessional. Our reservation was cancelled via email notification without reason. When we called and asked for explanation, we have been told all the reservations for the day were cancelled due to private event. First of all, it is not very not nice and professional to cancel reservations of everyone with short notice just because you restaurant want to make more money by hosting a private event instead. Second of all, if you do that, at least i expect an apologize message from the restaurant explaining the reason of the cancellation and offering to reschedule the reservation to another day, even better if accompanied by a complimentary discount for the inconvenience. This is what a 5 stars review restaurant would do, and Tamarind Hill is definitely not one of these."
superb thai food and set lunch on weekdays for just 35,the Resturant is beautiful and went for lunch. they have set meal veg and normal one. the food was superb and set lunch is worth having for just 35 . the fried rice and green curry were superb. the roll is really nice. the Resturant decor is superb. the coconut ice cream is too die for.
Tranquil,Tranquil with a good view of the sea. Food was tasty but overpriced by Singapore's standards of luxury hotels
Most expensive pint in SG?!,"Food average. Ambiance weird - why the whale music?! Service OK. No wifi and no network coverage - good luck getting a taxi back home.

But S$26 for a pint! - a pint of draught Chang at that - is just extortion. I would have called the police but no network coverage! Ohhh now I get it!"
Such a big disappointment,"When we visited this restaurant in 2020, we were absolutely delighted and this time deeply disappointed with the service and food.

The service was extremely slow, the food took almost an hour to arrive and the quality was subpar. One of our main dishes was forgotten, and mistakes can happen but the waitresses didn’t even bother to apologize.

The taste of served dishes, appetizers and main dishes like vegetarian curry and tom yam soup was not good at all, their taste was too sweet for Thai food. To be honest, you can get much better Thai food from hawker centers in Singapore.

Drinks menu is and the quality of wines were good, but last drink was served at 9pm and staff already informed us they close the restaurant at 10pm. Other restaurants in Singapore serves the last drink at 9:30pm and they close the restaurant at 10:30pm.

This information of early close should have been mentioned during reservation. This was a place we liked in the past but we won’t go there again."
Food was superb,Excellent property and great service! Can’t say more then the food was delicious and we were happy. Ros is a gem and added to the plus of Tamarind Hill.
Exceptional Wedding At Tamarind Hill,"My wife and I would like to extend a big thank you to the team at Tamarind Hill for ensuring our wedding event was able to proceed smoothly. Our guests have complimented that the venue is amazing and the food was excellent.

Special thanks to our wedding coordinator Sarah, for the flexibility accorded to us despite the multiple changes in wedding regulations since last year.

Rose and Riduan have also gone out of their way to make sure that our guests and us were well taken care of with their impeccable service.

If you appreciate a beautiful heritage venue close to nature, fine Thai cuisine and an affable service team, then Tamarind Hill is the perfect place for you.
We will definitely be back again!

Cheers,

Ros & KK"
Harassed and Hurried to leave,"After hearing impressive reviews we chose Tamarind Hill as the place to celebrate my friends birthday

However I was deeply disappointed.

We had a booking for 8:30pm. There was an initial misunderstanding about whether we chose to sit indoors or outdoors so by the time we sat down it was around 8:40pm and a waitress approached us telling us there was 5 mins until the last order. I was surprised to hear this as I had not been told this in the call I received nor on the booking email. We quickly made our menu choices so we could start enjoying our evening.

Following that the food arrived and we had only just started eating when we were rudely interrupted and told we need to hurry up as it was nearly time for closing. This spoilt the mood and also meant that we were under pressure to finish our meal. We had come to spend time together have good conversation and enjoy the ambience. I had yet to finish my meal but the waitress insisted on clearing up the plates that were done as she said we need to have the dessert we ordered and leave, as a result: the dessert was served while I was still eating my main course.

On arrival of the dessert the bill was then slapped down on our table. My friend had only just blown her candles out and was in the middle of making a thank-you speech when she was rudely and abruptly interrupted to be told we would need to leave soon

How many reminders do we need? The only time we should have been told that the last order is 8:45pm and the restaurant shuts at 10pm was at the time of booking. Had this been communicated to me in advance I would have made an earlier booking to ensure ample time for us to enjoy our special occasion.

Moreover if these are the timings that the restaurant must adhere to there is a polite, gentle and considerate manner in which the waitresses should deal with it- we should not have been made to feel harassed pressurised, stressed and interrupted continuously.
I have dined at many of the worlds finest restaurants in Singapore and abroad and have never been so disappointed. At this price tag (we paid $240 for 3 pax no alcohol) we deserve better service. Tamarind hill is meant to be an upmarket restaurant yet we felt like we were dining at a hawker or a fast food chain.

The lack of communication of the last order and restaurant closure timings coupled with the rude and abrupt manner of the staff ruined my friends special day.

If you want a nice quiet enjoyable evening please do not come here, you will be harassed and hurried to leave from
the moment you arrive.

I did not want to write this review and had in fact written a private e-mail of complaint to Tamarind hill and attempted to follow up by calling them to no avail."
Great service and ambience,"Really great service provided throughout our meal. The staff are very friendly too even when we want to take away the soup, they even offer to give us rice.
The price is in the mid high range and the portion is quite small. But it is decent. Their tom yum is not spicy so people who can't take spicy can try it!
Their red ruby dessert is really great! So yummy."
"Wonderful service, excellent quality food","Ignore the negative reviews; those reviewers are probably looking for a cheap Thai food served in huge portions, with little care for quality or ambiance.

If you appreciate food that is well-sourced and served with impeccable manners, read on

We booked a table for four for my friend's bachelorette party.

Not only was I allowed to rest in the air-conditioned lounge when I arrived at 11:45 (before they'd even opened), the restaurant handled my balloon order from a third party and the waitress set up the table with a keen eye for beauty and design.

We never felt rushed. Those that mentioned feeling so in their reviews may have had trouble reading; operating hours are clearly stated and, for the Sunday brunch (which is what we had), it is clearly posted that dining time is two hours from the first order.

Despite it being busy, staff were quick to clear plates and place new orders for us. Only toward 2 did service become a bit slow.

We were completely full on a huge range of delicious dishes by the time we left. Highlights were the fried pork, lime rice, and dessert. The only thing we did not enjoy was the salted egg prawn as it was too sweet /creamy.

I enjoyed this experience, the food, and the staff so much that I'll be returning for brunch today with my husband.

Ignore the negative (and, at times rather racially-charged) reviews. If you like good food, head to Tamarind Hill."
Wonderful weekend brunch,"Very warm and prompt service by 2 lovely Thai waitresses. We sat outdoors to enjoy the greenery, luckily it didn't feel too humid or warm. The weekend brunch items are all small portions which is perfect so we can try many items! Love their salads and rice rolls, v refreshing. Note their clientele is international so level of spiciness is v low, if you like more kick, maybe tell them in advance or ask for cut chilli padi. We really enjoyed the over brunch experience and will come back again."
Housed in a beautiful black&white,"Housed in a beautiful black&white colonial-style house, decorated with class. Knowledgeable and pro-active service staff. Unfortunately, the food is not very innovative, and except for a few dishes like red tom yum, extremely average - quite unmemorable. There are many places in Singapore that serve better Thai food. Prices are high. No wonder when we were there, the clientèle was exclusively expat (primarily Caucasian)."
If you read several of the,"If you read several of the negative reviews, the other dissatisfied customers couldn’t be more right. This restaurant wants you out the minute you arrive. There is no consideration for the guests having a leisurely meal experience - instead food is served to you all at once with virtually no consideration for guest experience. The staff are more focused on the closing time of the restaurant then they are on ensuring guests have a delightful time. A real pity given the restaurant has beautiful surroundings & decent food. There is clearly a lack of intelligent managerial oversight & ownership. Wouldn’t recommend this establishment to anyone."
Good Slightly Toned Down Expensive Thai,Went with wife and youngest daughter. Beef and seafood salads were particularly good. Massaman beef and morning glory were both full of flavour and nicely cooked. Whole sea bream with lime could have done with a bit more heat. Red seafood Tom yum very nice but again a bit light on Chili. Mango sticky rice always good. Overall nice meal together with 2 cock and 1 mock tail plus a bottle of red was about $500. Lovely venu and we had good service. I have had some fantastic Thai food In Thailand and elsewhere in Asia for very little $. My choice to go “ fine dining” but I always feel a little perplexed spending that much on Thai food.
Terrible Service,"Decided to come here to celebrate wedding anniversary after reading the highly rated reviews but strangely it was bad service and dining experience, with average food. Had to ask to refill water, pre-requested during booking for decorative dessert (ok to pay extra) but there isn't any, and explicitly asked to leave though we are already done and getting ready to go - this is the first restaurant i come across that could not even wait a while longer. If there is a '0' rating , i would have given it."
"Fabulous Location, Food and Serve","We dined here on New Year's Eve. We started with lychee martini cocktails at the bar. The bar tender took great care in preparing this delicious drink. We wished him a happy new year and said that we hoped that he would enjoy seeing in the new year after work, enjoying what he did most. We were delighted when he responded by saying that he was already spending his perfect evening doing what he was doing now at the restaurant. The restaurant service supervisor Rose showed us around the restaurant so we could choose where to sit. We sat outside on the verandah overlooking the forest, sea and the port. We had a bottle of the Italian house red, sangiovese and merlot blend that was lovely. We had a seafood set that started with some mixed appetizers, followed by mixed seafood curry, deep fried grouper with chili, mixed vegetables, rice and for desert mango sticky rice with coconut cream. All the service staff were Thai as indeed the staff were in the kitchen. It was simply the best Thai food we have had outside of Thailand in the 30 years we have lived in the region. The atmosphere was very special and of course the Thai staff were a delight to chat with and their service was warm and friendly, impeccable. This was a very special new years eve for us that we will never forget. Arrive early and enjoy a drink at the beautiful bar before heading for dinner. It is fine dining so not cheap but worth ever $."
High style & charm; not too high price tag.,"(Had to resubmit this review due to a rather unfortunate autocorrect error in the previous title!)

Stopped in here with the whole family (myself, wife, 4yr old and 2yr old) to refresh ourselves after a stroll in the lovely Labrador Park.

We only had drinks (bottle of Prosecco for the grownups, and mocktails for the boys) and were pleasantly surprised by such reasonable prices for such a stunning venue. The interior has maintained its colonial charm with modern comforts added in a sympathetic style. We didn’t try the dining service, and I believe they may have a no under-14’s policy for dinner service. (Once you feel the atmosphere of the venue it is hard to begrudge this policy!) However just for drinks our whole family was given a warm welcome, impeccable service, reasonable prices, and even escorted with an umbrella to our taxi as we left. A thoroughly enjoyable and pleasant experience from start to finish.

Wife and I can’t wait till we can unload the kids on the in-laws and get back here for dinner and a room for the weekend!!"
Good but Expensive Thai Food,"We had the appetizer platter (recommended for 2 pax, 4 types of appetizer, came in a pair), tom kha gai and soft shell crab yellow curry + brown rice.

The appetizer platter was uninspiring. Quality was not there and the it was overpriced. The tom kha gai and soft shell crab yellow curry on the other hand was amazing. So I'd skip the starters next time and just go to the mains. We had brown rice instead of white rice which was a healthier choice. But do note that their brown rice is not pure brown rice. It is a mix with berry rice which is a little closer to black glutinous rice. Nice texture though and definitely healthier (lower GI)."
Wonderful wedding experience,"We held our wedding luncheon at Tamarind Hill and stayed two nights at Villa Samadhi's Luxe Sarang.

From the moment we checked in, we felt incredibly well taken care of by the hotel staff. Also appreciate the handwritten well-wishes from Ewan! The villa is amazing and we were really glad that we had 2 nights to enjoy our room. It's also the nearest room to the restaurant, so walking to the restaurant in my wedding dress and heels (and taking gorgeous pics along the way!) was do-able.

We got the Timeless Menu and our guests loved the food and the ambience. Many people also commented on how attentive the staff were, so HUGE thank you to the team for ensuring our guests had the best experience.

Special shoutout to Sarah for coordinating the wedding, Kai for taking care of us in the villa, Rose for the awesome dinner service, and the restaurant staff for the sweet treats even during breakfast.

Major thanks again to Ewan and your team. We definitely recommend this venue for weddings and to stay at least 2 nights to enjoy everything the hotel has to offer."
Delightful thai cuisine with colonial architecture and nature,"Came to enjoy some cocktails and thai diner at Tamarind Hill during my staycation at the Villa Samhadi. I love it, it feels like an exotic gateway, so far and relaxing, from the busy CBD."
"Fantastic Ambience, food and most importantly People!","I was able to get a seat through the help of the business manager Jaspreet who set up such a lovely table for my girlfriend and I as part of a birthday celebration. From the time we entered to the time we left, we were so well taken care of by the Staff, especially Rose, Mama Helen and the bartenders. They were always making sure we were comfortable and were extremely proactive throughout, truly made it feel so homely.

The food is definitely up there with the best Thai food I have had locally- highly recommend their Masaman curry and fried pork. Drinks were fantastic and the place is a gem, doesent feel like Singapore at all. Location and decor are amazing!"
A total unprofessional and the most lousy service ever,"Went for a walk at Labrador Park, decided to visit Tamarind Hill since my friend mentioned that it is a hidden gems. Have lots of expectations towards this place but as soon as we reached the restaurant, we were totally disappointed! We were literally 'chased out' by the waitress and waiter.

We were there on Sunday at 2.10pm, the waitress welcomed us with an unfriendly approach. We asked if they were still open for business, she claimed yes but told us last order at 2.30pm and guests must leave at 3pm. We said ok since we would like to have drinks only. She said ok and then walked away and brought another waiter with her, the waiter was not friendly too and asked if we have appointment, which we said no, he again told us the same thing, ""our last order is at 2.30pm and guest will have to leave at 3pm"". We again told them that we were ok since we only came for drinks.

He took us to a dining table which we asked if we can sit a the sofa area or the bar counter, he said no and said they only served food?! we said we only want drinks, he said no drinks. we thought we heard wrongly and asked him in another manner ""do you meant that we cannot order drinks if we did not order food?"" he said yes ..

Firstly, if you were so lazy and eagerly to close the restaurant, simply put a sign outside and said ""we are closed"" or simply convey to us that you are closed when we asked if you were open!

Secondly, never in my life i came across with such a restaurant like Tamarind Hill where you were not allowed to order drinks if you skipped your food! Even a fine dinning restaurant or a 6 stars hotel, as long as they are in operation, they serve all food and beverages available in their outlet/ property including a bottle of sparkling water!

Thirdly, aunties and uncles who are working at the hawker centers are more professional than the above waiter and waitress who are working in such a classy restaurant! its time to groom them harder instead of damage the restaurant's reputation!"
Wedding at Tamarind Hill & Samadhi Villa,"This amazing restaurant and boutique hotel is adjacent and owned by the same group,hidden away inside the National park (Labrador park) It's tranquil, tasteful, culture and history-rich, we could not have imagined a more perfect tropical wedding venue in Singapore.
The food is excellent and great value for money, and 15 - 20% cheaper than other equivalent wedding menus at other restaurants. The staff are amazing, attentive, genuine, accommodating and very professional. We had our wedding reception at the hotel and stay one night at the hotel, and it could have been a smoother and more pleasant experience.
Whether it's dinner, special occasions or staycation, I've always been impressed and left wanted to come back again."
Look elsewhere - best avoided,"Breakfast at this restaurant was included in my staycation. I had to order what I wanted the day prior at reception from a set menu. Menu was adequate and I ordered.

The restaurant is a considerable uphill hike from the hotel but I eventually reached it. Outdoor seating only for breakfast. I ordered breakfast for 8am and arrived about 8.15am - so I was late but from the look of my breakfast it had clearly been cooked sometime earlier. Eggs benedict with dry bernaise - service was slow when the waiting staff were about but most of the time there was no one present to assist guests. Absolutely non attentive staff who did not look particularly interested to be there.

This restaurant is best given a wide berth."
Good amazing food but lousy service.,"Beautiful hidden colonial building away from city. Enjoyed everything until the service staff named chai was inadequately trained and lack of knowledge even for simple things. We even noticed whenever the guests in the restaurant tried to get his attention, he would simply just walked away and ignored the guests. Please educate this service staff with more proper training required."
Horrible...Trust Me or Try it,"Over rated price, service and food. This is how they served foods in diff bowls for sharing. Staffs were racist, serving rice and other foods on western ppl’s plates but not to Asian. Dishes got no presentation. Foods were cold. They rated themselves as Michelin star but out of staffs and we paid Sunday brunch SGD82/pax at the end without alcohol drink. One of the waitresses was so fierce and rude too. She ruined the whole brunch atmosphere.

There was a “no children” note when we reserved the table. I didn’t mind at all but turned out few babies were there.

This place is beautiful and could do much better."
A staycation in one meal,"With its out of town location, colonial building and natural setting, a meal at Tamarind Hill feels like a staycation! The welcome is expertly done by the lovely Helen. Make time to have a drink in the beautiful lounge. And try to choose an outdoor table as you will enjoy the sound of the frogs quietly croaking in the woods. The food is among the best Thai food I have ever had."
"Very loud, average service","While the location and setting are nice, I was honestly expecting much more. The restaurant was incredibly loud, so much so that we had to scream to be heard on a small square table for four people. Service was at best average, with food served just warm rather than hot. What was supposed to be a special celebration ended up just ok (despite mentioning to the host that we were celebrating our daughter's 18th birthday, this went totally unnoticed - did not expect much, maybe just a little candle on the dessert we ordered). No attention to details, I guess no need as long as the turnaround is there."
Father's Day Celebration over Brunch,"I personally feel that the food reviews that I read over the internet were overrated. If you are going for ambience, then this is a good place. For food wise, I will rate it average."
exclusive,we had lunch. very exclusive place. only accessible by car. free parking. seating within greenery. thai food. plater is nice n easy to eat. tempura scallop is wonderful. Tom yam soup sweet. enjoy the wine with thai food
"Poor service, worse attitude.","We had a really disappointing meal at Tamarind Hill this evening. This was our third or fourth visit and it is one of our favourite restaurants in Singapore so we were looking forward to another meal. From the get go, the service was incredibly slow both to take our order but also to repour wine and generally engage with us.
All of the food was cold when it arrived but there was no one around to ask to take the food back so we got on with it. We ordered a second bottle of wine which came 25 minutes after it was ordered and only after asking a further time. Even then, it was another 10 minutes before it came. We also had to ask twice for the table to be cleared even though we had clearly stopped eating. The only speedy part of the experience was the bill being brought.
When we complained to the owner we were given a long story about a large proportion of the staff being unable to cross the border from Malaysia and how the ones who are working are tired and just want to talk to their wives and children. While we fully understand that the virus has put enormous pressure on all sectors in the economy, Tamarind Hill was the only one who used it as an excuse for shoddy service. We have eaten out every day during this week and have had no such issues elsewhere. The restaurant was not short of staff, it was just short of enthusiasm to do the job properly. It’s sad to say I don’t think we will be back again - we would have given them the benefit of the doubt had it not been for the poor excuses from the owner and the lack of attempts to make things good. An apology followed by a string of excuses is not an apology at all. Would sadly no longer recommend - go elsewhere in future."
a prized find,"Great service. Very tranquil ambience. Thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience. No snooty service crew, just a team of warm and attentive friendly faces who stopped at nothing to make our evening as enjoyable as it can be. Food may not be traditional Thai, just still it didn't disappoint. Keep up the great work guys."
Over priced lousy food,"Went for a wedding dinner. Tiny car park was full. Went to Wilson paid parking - haven't walk up a step flight of stairs which is littered with dry leaves, sandy, and dark. Coming down the stairs when leaving - be careful not to trip and tumble.

Place itself claims to be top choice wedding venue - it's run down with dirty air con outlets and ceiling beams with cracking plaster paint.

Food claims to be fine dining Thai cuisine. I can assure you - finding better Thai food at a fraction of the price requires no effort.

Let's see what you get for $125 (=USD 95) per person wedding dinner - starter of overly spicy mango salad + tasteless prawn cake + 3 strips of chicken.

Then you get 5 dishes + ice to be shared amongst 4 persons - overcooked steamed fish + dry & hard garlic pork + asparagus + green curry chicken + salted egg prawns -- all of which was lukewarm at best when served to our table.

Dessert was individual portion of coconut ice cream + cake + mango sticky rice."
A special kind of dining in luxury thai food,I went to this restaurant when I was staying at Villa Samadhi Singapore back in December whilst on business. What a lovely little restaurant it is! The food came in asian-style sharing dishes and really helped everyone to feel connected to the food rather than the traditional keep to your own plate way of dining. A real joy with an excellent team and great food!
"Amazing, gorgeous experience","Top end, gorgeous and gracious experience. Superb food. We are vegetarian; there was a complete set of choices for us. Unobtrusive, friendly and attentive. Astonishing location! Great views."
SO relaxing !,Lovely setting that felt SO calm as soon as we entered. Plenty of space in the restaurant to move around and lovely subdued lighting. Food was delicious ! Plenty of choices and we shared starters. Great mains especially the tuna and crispy duck.
EXCELLENT THAI FOOD,"Went there for lunch and had a great time. The restaurant is set in a secluded part of Singapore and surrounded by beautiful garden and trees. The inside is very spacious and well decorated. The food was simply awesome. The service was quick and courteous. We got to taste a lot of food from their brunch menu. Poached tiger prawns wrapped in fresh salmon, ,fresh apple rolls and deep fried corn cakes were superb as appetizers. For the main do try deep fried grouper with spicy sweet and sour pineapple sauce, green curry with vegetables. There were quite a lot of other choices also. The price was quite reasonable and the wine selection was very good. All in all not to be missed while visiting Singapore."
Great Ambience and Excellent Service,"My partner and I found this hidden gem and decided to spend our New Year Eve at this black and white colonial converted restaurant and we really appreciate the ambience of the restaurant which really has the old English house. The food was amazing and the excellent service served by the staffs, especially Steeven totally made our night so special! Thanks to them. Would recommend to family and friends!"
"""Tasty thai food """,Delicious Thai Food !!! and very good service 👍. The environment are so beautiful .Me and my friends love it.
Beautiful Setting and Food,Got a time to spend lovely romantic dinner at this restaurant. Service was really quick and helpful with great ambience. The Thai food is absolute mouth watering. Recommend the Pork Penag curry.
"Blown away by the quality of food, hospitality and service","Tamarind Hill impresses time and time again. The food is excellent, their attention to detail is impeccable, and their service quality is beyond compare. Kudos to Ridzuan (I may have gotten his name wrong) and his colleagues for a wonderful experience."
Beautiful settings...that’s it,Great ambience and beautiful decor. Excellent service too. But the food was disappointing and over priced. Have tasted better Thai food in Singapore with less damage to the pockets. Go with friends for a night out but don’t expect a tasty meal. And pricey too. Bill came to S$150 per pax for our group of 21 which included 2 bottles of red wine (plus 2 bottles of champagne BYO). Corkage was complimentary (1:1).
Slightly disappointed.,"We lived in Singapore for 4 years and this was a firm favourite but visiting earlier this month we felt disappointed. We were left standing at the entrance while staff chatted at the bar and eventually taken to a table. I’d booked online 6 weeks before requesting an outside table only to be told they had a problem with lighting. To be honest if they’d contacted us to tell us this, I would have rescheduled as sitting on their beautiful terrace is part of the attraction. Sadly the service was lacking, it was difficult to order a drink or get our food order taken, and we were disappointed that we had to leave the Massamam curry as the beef was much too chewy. The rest of the food was lovely but it’s the complete experience that counts."
Perfect Place for an Intimate Wedding,"My wife and I held our solemnisation ceremony and wedding lunch at Tamarind Hill in Nov, and we could not have picked a more perfect place. We were looking for a unique, intimate location with great food and atmosphere; a place that was grand and elegant enough for holy matrimony, yet down to earth and warm enough for our guests to relax, be themselves, and truly be present with us. Tamarind Hill gave us all that and more. Co-ordinator Sarah Lee and her team met our every need, and was a constant source of help from start to finish. Thank you Sarah and team!"
Gone very down hill,"So, have been a few times and generally seen as a nice meal, but a treat (as quite expensive). However, while the flavours of the sauces were still there, we had 3 meat dishes and EVERY SINGLE DISH had something wrong with it. The meat was either too tough (beef and pork) or too much fat / bones (duck). I think we could take one being poor, but all three was unexpected - very disappointed."
Wedding reception,It was my son's wedding and we had a reception on the morning. The staff were extremely helpful and kind to us. The food was delicious and the ambience was great. The staff worked very hard to ensure that everyone had something to eat and drink.
Tasty Thai Food,"Very good Thai food. Didn’t feel heavy after the meal, which means they aren’t using Ajinomoto. Very good ambiance which gave me the feel I was in Crazy Rich Asians sets"
"Beautiful restaurant and unbeatable ambience, food was average","Just a couple of minutes drive from the bustling Alexandra Road area you enter Labrador Park area and before you know it you're in Tamarind Hill and you totally forget that you're in a metropolis. Tamarind Hill is in a beautiful old house with a large lobby and tables where you get ample space from the next table - welcome but rare in Singapore. The service is friendly but can be a bit slow if you're in the room on the right of the restaurant - I feel the left side is far better - and more beautiful.
The food itself is pretty standard Thai fare - which is fine - nothing like Thai comfort food. Starter portions are small but main courses were more generous. I'm very particular about Thai food and find it's almost impossible to find genuinely great Thai food in Singapore. I would say that TH is slightly above average but not top top. All in all, however, great for bringing guests from outside Asia to make them feel they're really in Southeast Asia. And of course this is also a great place for a date given the space you have vs other tables and the dim lighting. Overall - recommended."
business dinner,"Had dinner at Tamarind Hill as part of a large group business dinner. Ambience was lovely and service was great. Enjoyed the opportunity to dine in a colonial era ""black and white."" Food was so-so. With a large group it was difficult to have a conversation...voices echoed off the bare floors and walls and it was difficult to hear those just across the table. Would be much more suited for a private dinner."
Gorgeous setting,Back here after a year. Thai food in a gorgeous setting. Attentive service. Highlight for me was the ambience. Food was decent but not memorable.
Deli in a very nice colonial villa,"Really delicious balance of sweet and spicy tastes with wide choice, nice service and very pleasant location, where you can eat, chat and relax with no problem. Rice was particularly good and so was the mango dessert"
Friday night dinner,Sampled the home infused fins. Delicious. Food was wonderful as usual. Good size portions. Highly recommend.
Awesome fine Thai dining,"Beautifully located in a colonial ‘black & white’ in Labrador Park. Probably the best Thai food I’ve had in Singapore, and their house infused gins were amazing. Large portions mean family style eating is the way to go. Excellent service and decent wine list. This place is a keeper"
"Fine, South East Asian cuisine","Next door to the Villa Samadhi, this upmarket restaurant is open to hotel guests and visitors. As hotel guests, we had no problem getting a table, but if going as a group or for a special occasion it might be better to book as it was very busy both nights. You need a car to get there.

An excellent selection of meals and starters, beautifully presented. Wonderful, friendly staff. Plenty of food and for the quality, well worth the price."
VIP visitor,"Our company’s CEO was visiting and we wanted to host a casual fuss-free dinner. The food was excellent, service timings perfectly timed and the service staff (for the outside tables where we were seated) were friendly and attentive. Thank you for hosting us perfectly as per our wishes!"
Great Ambience,"Pros:
1) Great ambience and decor.
2) Service is good. Thanks to Ms Yuvethva and the service staffs around.
3) Food is good.

Cons:
1)The street lights from the car park to the restaurant is too dim. Don't feel comfortable even though it's just a short distance walk.
2) The toilet lights could be brighter, too dim.

Overall, we do enjoyed our dinner."
Tuesday Thai,"Food out of this world. Tasty, great variety of dishes on offer. Service and attention taken of the customer outstanding. Very much appreciated."
Poor Service by wedding coordinator,"Beautiful place let down by inept staff. If you want to get married here avoid Sara Lee as your liaison. She did not turn up on the actual day of event nor make any attempt to inform/ remind us of that or provide an alternative contact. Also edited our seating/ attendance sheet without our authorisation; leaving out crucial information that would have aided in seating our guests.

Coordinator LIED to us about rooms not being available for early check-in. A simple check by calling the front desk proved otherwise. Will conveniently 'forget' the gift owed to you unless prompted.

As an events venue they were not sure if their systems were compatible with Apple platforms and required guests to supply their own adapters. We also had feedback that the sound was poor and inaudible/ muffled.

Servers were confused as to how many pax were meant to share each serving and guests were not allowed to order and pay for their own drinks at the bar if they wanted.

Will rip you off for $6++ per cup of 'authentic jasmine tea' or plain brewed coffee (even though you're already spending tens of thousands with them). The concept of 'inauthentic Jasmine tea' is unfamiliar to us in any case.

Dishes were on the whole well received by our guests but at least one of the dishes was markedly different and we suspect not what we ordered."
Great Ambience,"Tamarind Hill has a great decor. The lighting was a bit muted, and took us time to get adjusted. But overall feel and vibe was outstanding."
Private function on loud speaker meant you couldn’t hear yourself,"I booked a table at the tamarind hill for a special occasion. I called to check an hour in advance and the restaurant said it was all good and I should make my way for my special occasion dinner

I arrive there and to my horror there is a large group of people standing by the bar; a power point presentation being projected and a woman speaking loudly on a microphone her voice vibrating through the restaurant.

It was a private party which was going to last 2 hours ! So there I am stranded with no other reservation and my special occasion becoming even more special with the loud announcements

So I check with the restaurant who brush me away by saying that no other guest is complaining and neither should I - no common courtesy that they tell me when I am making a booking that they will be hosting a loud private party.

Anycase I ordered and they were out of coconut water - ok that’s fine- I ordered mango salad that came stale and withered - perhaps from the private party buffet.

Completely annoyed by their unprofessional behaviour."
Elegance and great ambience,"The restaurant is set atop a small hill, next to Labrador Park. Tall trees flank the road leading to the restaurant which is set amidst lot of greenery. There is ample parking space very close to the restaurant. We were a group of office colleagues and a separate table was reserved for us in a coy corner for lunch. I ordered set meal, which had appetizer (salad & minced chicken) , main course (chicken with green curry) and dessert (coconut flavored ice cream). The food was good, ambiance & the service was great and setting elegant. If you are looking for a gateway in a tranquil corner of Singapore, Tamarind Hill is the place to go."
Birthday Dinner,"Simply Amazing! From the ambience, to the quality of food and presentation, and the range of beverages. Probably the best Thai Restaurant in Singapore!!"
Good food but poor Singtel and Starhub network,"Beautiful setting, lovely ambience, good food but poor Singtel and Starhub network. Had to stand on the balcony to get 4G network."
Delightful tranquility,"Visited at lunchtime and sampled the 'business menu' - fabulous value for money.

You are away from the hustle of Singapore, transported to a place of calm and relaxation. The building is an old colonial bungalow that has been tastefully renovated, the design is subtle and understated. The staff are so gentle and unobtrusive which adds to the dining experience.

The food was delicious but as to be expected has a real spice kick! The offerings are more than sufficient however having said that we did manage to consume all three courses! I opted for the thai green curry and was not disappointed, in fact there was an egg served onto of the rice which was a revelation.

Only downside was the location, a taxi was required to and from the hotel but if you're looking for authentic food, at very reasonable prices then I highly recommend you visit for a lunchtime treat."
Lovely restaurant,"Although I’m normally not a great fan of thai food, we had an excellent dinner here. There were plenty of choices that catered to my palette. The restaurant has a great setting in a green and lush area. We sat outside but there are plenty of tables inside too. Wonderful interior with a great bar"
Great food Great Atmosphere,Looking for a romantic place for dinner? This is the place I’d recommend. It is a black and white colonial house converted so it is surrounded by beautiful greenery. IndoChinese art objects set the mood with just dim enough lighting. Every dish we ordered was superb. The red beef curry the green veg curry set the mood for Thai. Then we were uplifted by a superlative Gewurtztraminer from Zind Humbrecht. The sea bass flown in from the Gulf of Thailand was fresh and tangy with lime and chills. Pandan dried chicken wrapped in pandan leaf and tamarind sauce was perfect! Deserts were enormous but delicious. All in a wonderful evening!
Not recommended,"I was at this establishment for a wedding dinner. The only good thing I would commend on is aesthetics. The old colonial-style building and interior decor are good for pictures.

The food is average-tasting and was not served warm. The waiters & waitresses need additional training. On several occasions, they would serve the food in between guests who were having a conversation - they really could have served the food from the other side. It is also disappointing to see the service staff clearing the leftovers food in the plain sight of guests (during a wedding dinner, no less). See the attached picture. They could have either bring the plates outside the dining hall or invest in a simple panel to block the view. I think this is the minimum standard expected of a place that is supposedly a ""Thai Fine Dining"" location. If the restaurant is unable to handle a wedding dinner properly, I cannot see myself ever visiting it on other occasions.

Lastly, the phone reception at the location is rather poor, free wifi won't help."
Authentic Thai Cuisine amidst nature,"The location is atop the Labrador Reserve as the name suggests and the entrance is super inviting with bamboos adorning both the sides amid a vastly green surrounding. A historic colonial bungalow has been converted into the restaurant serving authentic Siamese cuisine. I was pretty impressed with the decor themed Black & White, radiating so much positivity. Moving on to the food, we choose to go with the executive set lunch which was a 3 course meal. Soon enough the starters arrived, arranged neatly along a straight line on the plate with the right amount of everything. Of the lot I loved the minced chicken salad, it was flavourful and well cooked. The main course “Green Thai curry”, the best I have had yet was creamy with the right amount of spices, left me wanting for more. And finally for the dessert, generally am not a fan of durian but somehow it’s tingling flavour mixed with the coconut ice cream felt heavenly. Overall a great experience and would definitely visit in the future."
"Excellent food, good service, amazing ambience",Went there for our anniversary. Food was authentic with fresh ingredients; service was attentive but not over the top; the highlight has to be the building and the surrounding.
"Beautiful location, good food","Set on a green, tropical hill that reminds you of Colonial Singapore. Someplace to go for date night and enjoy the night."
Emphasis on ambience,"We had been round Hawr Parr villa and Labrador Park and friends said let's just have a look inside as they had always wanted to see it - so we popped in, looking somewhat worse for wear, and it was so lovely that we asked to be squeezed in for dinner. Not a problem for the glamorous maitre d [who set the hubby's heart a flutter!]

Emphasis is on ambience and tables are well spread out, giving diners a bit of peace and space. Food was excellent, they serve a mean cocktail too.

Just lovely and no where near as pricey as it should be."
Excellent,"This is such a hidden gem… setting is spectacular: amid lush greenery you feel miles away of the hustle and bustle of busy-busy Singapore. Food is superb.
We’ve been mainly for romantic dinners. However, early this week we hosted a group of 12 corporate visitors with special overseas guests (with special dietary requirements and demands). We knew that food and ambience would be great. This time though, Yuvethra and the service staff blew our minds. They went out of their way to make sure that every single detail was taken care and that my special guests felt REALLY special!
Kudos to Tamarind Hill and thank you!. Definitively we will be back!"
"Superb setting, great service, food very average.",Went for a wedding anniversary dinner. Setting is fantastic and beautifully lit up at night with a very nicely appointed bar. Balcony looked fantastic but it was a bit warm to be sitting outside. Service was impeccable but sadly the food let it down. I love Thai food and was excepting it to be something like Suay in Phuket. The starter platter was nothing special then we had a very average red duck curry. The barrimundi with crispy lemongrass however was very good. Portions were a reasonable size but I would have rather had them smaller and better quality. The worst part of the meal is what is usually my favorite. We ordered the mango sticky rice. It came with four huge lumps of rice with four small pieces of mango on the top with the thickest coconut sauce all over it. Worse still when we cut into it and took a bite realised that the rice was just a solid lump. Completely overcooked and cold. Who doesn’t serve sticky rice warm?? When I asked apparently they never do. I was like eating cold over cooked rice porridge. For the first time in my life I sent the dish back. The waiter was very nice about it and offered to bring me something else but I declined.
Amazing food and ambiance,"We are Tamarind Hill regular guests since three years, the food is exceptional, the place is always charming and the service is excellent!"
Tamarind Hill Singapore,"The worst experience we ever had in Singapore. Reception unfriendly, service poor and food partly uneatable."
A delight - as always!,I love Tamarind Hill. The setting in a heritage home is superb as is the decor. And the food? Well delicious doesn't even come close to doing it justice! Have been many times and hope to return often too.
Disappointing dinner,"i was there last night full with excitement at first , the restaurant was surprisingly packed for Monday night so i thought food must be good. First dish papaya salad was not fresh, it seem it has been kept in fridge for sometime.. beef curry tasteless and meat was tough, im not going to comment on the rest. it is a shame cos i really like the place...."
"Beautiful food, location and service!",Exquisite Thai dishes in a beautiful serene setting. A lovely evening for intimate gatherings with family or friends.
Location is very special and food fantastic.,"Sitting on top of a hill surrounded by lush tropical vegetation with lights of the city below, and the sounds of the native fauna around you, the location is fantastic. This is matched by the great food. It is fairly pricey but I believe it is truly worth it.

I would recommend sitting outside to get the full effect of the colonial building and it's surroundings but if the air con is required there is an indoor dining area and a beautiful bar area."
Cooking course required for chef ...,"What a total disappointment. Having just spent 2 months in Thailand a few months ago we were craving an excellent Thai meal. $85 later we are still craving an excellent Thai meal. This place does not deliver. It relies on the decor to fool you into thinking that the food will compare but it does not. Poorly seasoned and missing the vital balance of sweet and sour, spicy and salty the food here was extremely poor. Don’t think for a moment that paying what for Thai food is top dollar will get you a great meal here. It won’t. We left feeling slightly nauseous, and totally underwhelmed."
Nice romantic night out.,"Received exceptional service at Tamarind Hill. If you are looking for a quiet romantic dinner, this can be one of your options. Upon finding out that it's our anniversary, we were presented with complimentary desserts, lemongrass drink and a bouquet of flowers! Sorry we didn't get the name of the lady who served us. Thank you for the pleasant surprise!"
Excellent Sunday Brunch,"My wife, son and I had a wonderful Sunday brunch.
The restaurant is located in a lovely old colonial house in a quiet area of Singapore.
We opted for the free flow food and drinks option. We were not disappointed.
The food was freshly cooked and delicious further complimented by an excellent supply of cocktails and wine.
We were expertly looked after by the delightful and very capable front of house manager Yuve and her her team.
We will certainly visit again."
Terrible service,"From the moment we arrived for dinner it felt like we were bothering the staff with our presence. After the meal our empty plates sat there for 30 minutes as the staff busily reset tables around us for the next day. Good food, but shockingly bad service."
Worst value brunch in singapore,"Went for Sunday brunch which is advertised as being 3 hours however on arrival discovered that the food is free flowing for 3 hours but the drinks only for 2. At 120++ it’s terrible value for 2 hours compared to other brunches.
Annoyed but hungry and having already made the trek out there, we decided to stay.
Overall the food and service are good but the place was mostly empty and there was no atmosphere to speak of.
Recommend for dinner when it’s busier and you can order a la crate but brunch is a bust."
?,"We took clients to our his place and was asked as soon as our main arrived whether we wanted dessert or not as it was last orders ...
Then we were asked to leave the restaurant and sit in the reception area about 10.30pm... we sat down at 8 15pm?
The waitress was rude .
The food was good and the place very impressive but for business dinners or lunches I don’t think I’d risk this anymore ... it should be worry free and it wasn’t . We left feeling annoyed and upset and sadly our clients thought this was a true reflection on what Singapore restaurants are like ... what a shame ."
Great spot for my husband's Birthday Dinner,"I wish more of Singapore still had more of these lush settings. Set and dine near the water in a great piece of architectural history. We had a lovely, complexly spicy meal and I really enjoyed the house-made pandan crème brûlée and tamarind juice. The online booking said there were no tables but I was able to call and get a table. This service operation might need to be checked with the owners, as i might not have called. We certainly recommend dinning for dinner and my advice would be to get there before it gets dark in order to appreciate the setting."
Ambience and good service makes up for price,"I like the ambience and exclusivity of the premise. Staff of restaurant was friendly and attentive. Although price is steeper, the nice experience makes up for everything. Taste of Thai food is also great, flavourful and tastiness just right. Most delightful dessert of coconut ice cream with red rubies...simple but taste was perfect."
Scrumptious breakfast!,"I had poached eggs with champagne, coffee & orange juice for breakfast. The service was quick & efficient. I enjoyed it an easy pace in the serene surroundings, with sounds of birds chirping & gentle sea breeze brushing on surrounding trees. The architecture is quite colonial, it takes you back in a time where life was perhaps not so fast."
"Great ambience, okay food","For a group of 12, Tamarind Hill had a great ambience that facilitated good conversations. While other places might have been too loud or crowded, the set up allowed for semi-privacy. We had a lohei, which was a treat for our non-Singapore based guests. They also included a decent vegetarian menu for our vegetarians (though I didn’t try it myself).

The food itself was pretty decent, with some ups and downs. For our dinner, we had set courses (see pic). In order of appearance, here were my verdicts:

1) Sweet Turnip and Prawns in a Crispy Cup - 3/5 (my crispy cup was unfortunately not so crispy anymore)
2) Sago with Scallop Salad - 4/5 (I liked the spicy sago—I’ve never had this before)
3) Red Tom Yum with Chicken - 5/5 (one of my favorites for the night)
4) Stir-Fried Pork with cashew nuts - 4/5 (yummy but average)
5) Mixed vegetables with oyster sauce - 2/5 (less than average)
6)Steamed Barramundi with Fish Dumplings - 2/5 (pretty tasteless)
7) Longevity noodles with smoked duck - 3/5 (tasteless noodles but great duck)
8) Pandan crep
e served with vanilla ice cream - 5/5 (my favorite of the night. Loved every part of this dessert! From the pandan crepe to the red rubies hidden under the vanilla ice cream.)

All in all I would place food at 3/5, but the ambience makes up for it and hikes it up to 4/5.

JMHO."
Nice ambience for large groups,Interesting place near Pasir Panjang .. nice staircase walk way to entry. Large car park. Food is decent not so great... huge variety in food and wine choices ... separate room for large groups.
Unreliable,Every time I try to make a reservation it is confirmed online. Restaurant then calls later to cancel because of some event. Multiple times this has happened now! Will not go back even if the food is decent. Just bad behaviour to its clientele and can't be relied on to honour reservations.
"Great food, poor service","Brought some of my friends together for my birthday - Tamarind Hill holds a special place in my heart. The food was excellent as usual, but the service was appalling. We had to wait and often wave our hands for minutes before even capturing anyone's attention for basic things like ordering the next course, the cheque and more. Later, my wife Jemma mentioned she had requested for a birthday celebration, but it didn't happen. We're left questioning our loyalty to Tamarind Hill. Sid and Jemma."
Excellent Thai fare in idyllic ambience!,"Lunch at Tamarind Hill on a working day is an idyllic experience as there are very few tables taken and on a rainy early afternoon, the setting is amazingly peaceful and classy! The food is mouthwatering and authentic Thai fare is on offer. We started with Miso Tom yum soup followed by okra rice, green curry with vegetables & stir fried tofu. The drinks we tried were Mimosa, Lychee Bellini & Kir Royale. Service was prompt and courteous and we had a great time. Will return most certainly!"
Lovely building,"Beautiful building and well maintained. Nice welcome by the staff. The food is good with very generous portions. Service was OK apart from one waiter who could not smile for some reason. Wine choice OK but as always in Asia ensure it is not corked!

The place feels upmarket and a bit special.

What would I improve? The waiter who looked fed up. Staff make a place come to life!"
Great location and venue - excellent Thai food,"This is a really good Thai restaurant in an old black and white colonial mansion in Labrador Park Singapore. We ate outside and our food was excellent and the service just right. The bill was ok too - quite a fair price for such good food in such a lovely location.
Labrador Park is a quiet natural area of parkland. Tamarind Hill is not an escape from modernity but it serves as a reminder of an earlier and perhaps more gracious time. Well done to it’s owners for bringing such a lovely building back to life. Highly recommended."
