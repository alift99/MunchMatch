Memorize service and food.,I went to this restaurant with my family because my friend recommended it. The place was clean and neat. Service was excellent with Mr Madan service was too good and high profile. Waiter and waiters are very friendly and definitely will recommend this restaurant to my friends and family. Great job guy's
Best Indian in Town !!! Just Wowwwww !!!,"Wowwwwwwww!!!!!!! What an amazing experience we had at Anglo Indian , one of the finest and yummiest food we had after a long time in SG. We had tried the Non Veg platter as the starter which was so delicious and presented in perfection. We had chicken tikka masala and chef special Dal Bukhara and Prawnste are here to die for , every bite will make you feel like that you are eating in india . One of the best Indian food I tried after long in SG‚Ä¶.
Now about service , the gentleman Madan was taking care of our table and that guy was on another level about knowledge regarding to the food and was extremely polite , he make us feel at home and I am not sure whether he is manager there , but the organization is for sure lucky to have a manager like him .

A must Visit place ‚Ä¶.Highly recommended..

Tip :- if you are looking for flavorful Indian food and excellent service Do visit this place and you will love it for sure ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
Great ambience and service,"Had a memorable dinner with a group of colleagues, thanks to ever attentive restaurant manager. Biryani and prawn dish were my favourite and the Singapore Sling is quite legit here! My third time in Anglo Indian and every time there's always something new to try."
A great night to end the year.,"We had a wonderful evening attended by Madan. We was actually walking around the neighbourhood to find a good dinner to end the year. Madan recommended that we had our dinner at Anglo Indian. We had a very great evening with constant showers of service from him. He recommended dishes, drinks and also kind enough to inform us to stop ordering as the food will be sufficient for our group of 4. Indeed, service from the heart. A great person to end the year with. Happy new year guys."
Great hangout atmosphere,"Seated at the ‚Äúoutdoor‚Äù seating, which I feel has a great vibe for chilling with friends. Food & drinks were good too. Shoutout to Mr Madan for great service!"
High Quality Food with Great Service,A good restaurant with nice ambience sets a high standard for its food quality with fast great service serving every meals. Serving quality food can earn the restaurant a good reputation and compel first time customer to return for repeat visit. The dinner was awesome and we throughly enjoyed ourselves. My colleagues and myself had great time. Thank you!
"Mesmerising dinning experience , great service and good food at Anglo Indian Chijmes .","Dine in with my colleagues at Anglo Indian Chijmes . Yummy favourable food with great service. Wait staff were so personable to recommend the food, constantly follow up on our dinning experience. Great ambience, cool place for a relax chill down evening for dinning evening. Highly recommended and will patronise the place again ."
Not a restaurant but an eating house,Accept any walk ins with total disregard for any previous reservations. Greedy for business. Large portions but very average taste.
Terrible Service,"Had booked this place for dinner and they constantly keep haggling to order fast and leave after eating. Within 2 minutes of sitting down, was asked at least 5 times if I had placed the order. After we finished, within an hour they came to clear and clean the table, gave the cheque and asked to leave the place cause next customer is waiting. Even the usual dining time is 90 minutes but clearly the staff was just focused on getting in more people to eat and leave. Wont visit this place again. Poor Experience."
"Friendly service, flavourful food",Staff were friendly and attentive. Food was simply delicious. We sat in non-airconditioned area and yet it was breezy
"Great service, good food, value for money","Very attentive and well-trained staff. Each server or host seemed to care that we had a good meal. Fun atmosphere. It's not high end food, but it is satisfying and well-made, though the vegetarian dum biryani was a bit dry and clearly was made with frozen mix vegetables and some cauliflower thrown in."
Utterly disappointed - total waste of money,"Ask very surprising how anyone can give a positive review of this place. I ordered 8 different dishes and 7 were utterly tasteless. In fact 3 main courses (chicken & mutton) were so uniformly tasteless that we couldn‚Äôt even distinguish them from one another.

The only thing that were eatable were chicken 65 (which had no resemblance to the chicken 65 eaten anywhere before) and butter chicken (which I would still rank very low )

All in all, avoid fish shashlik, lamb chops , chicken Malai tikka, mutton curry , butter chicken. don‚Äôt remember other dishes.

Though not a replacement for Indian food , I would any day prefer going to Rengaya a few steps away, which I feel is worthwhile to spend every penny in that restaurant."
Pleasant evening out,"Food was nice enough although some dishes like the chaat and palak paneer were a bit sweet. It was all ok, no complaints but also nothing to get super excited about. Prices are quite steep but I guess you‚Äôre paying for the location, in Chjimes."
Disappointing experience,Disappointed with the level of customer service provided that day. We tried for several minutes to get the attention of the service crew to order food. Finally a waitress attended to us but wasn't able to answer questions on the dishes. We had to wait for another waitress to speak to us.
Excellent Indian food!üòÄüëçüèΩ,"Wenn immer in Singapore,dann komme ich gerne ins Anglo Indian Restaurant at Chijmes‚Ä¶good food and always nice staff as Mr.Madan Lal"
Great Hospitality leaves an last long impression,"This is 4th time I have been there and every time I have a wonderful experience. The ambiance is really good and the food recommendation and the hospitality & service given by ‚ÄòMadan‚Äô is beyond expectations. I really would like give 5 +stars to him because the way he take care the need of every customer is commendable & amazing.
Everything has a unique taste which we had ordered, nice arrangement and service
Would highly recommend this place‚Ä¶."

Food and atmosphere,"Madan was our waiter, he was so professional and attention to detail .provided an excellent service and even went the extra mile to explain the food and the menu. We surely coming back for delicious butter chicken and mutton curry ."
Very poor Indian food - which is a shame,Pretty awful food. Stodgy salty and tasteless albeit spicey. Good atmosphere. Even the staff knew food poor. I had 4 dishes. All of them poor. The roti was more like a grilled pitta bread. Goan fishy curry gloopy and definitely not fresh. Shame - because location is good
Great food and Fantastic service!,Was served by Madan. Very professional and friendly. He was very patient and explained the food and menu well. The cheese nann and nachos with cheese was fantastic! Would definitely visit again!
Best waiter in CHIJMS,"Madan was our waiter, he was so professional and provided an excellent service. He was so attentive and even went the extra mile to explain the food and the menu.

Really Good Food with Nice Atmosphere,The food is really good especially the Butter Chicken and Doan Curry Fish complete with Garlic Naan.
Lovely Indian / continental food at Chimes,"Been here for quick lunch, food options are decent and they gave some dinning credit at the end of the lunch

mixed experience,"Ambience is quite good - you sit outside on a terrace. Service is fiendish fast. Food? dahl and nan were perfect, Goan fish curry had no spices, no coconut and odd fish which tasted of bread. hand sanitiser available but no place to wash your hands"
Lovely dinner at Anglo Indian,"Delicious food, lovely ambience with attentive service at Anglo Indian. The Indian Railway Mutton was yummy! The mutton was soft, and cooked to perfection. The Mushroom masala paired perfectly with the bread. The staff were very professional. Highly recommend!"
Anglo Indian Cafe & Bar Chijmes,"Overall experience can be better if not because of the manager, he doesn't seems to be approachable and friendly, quite disappointed as the rest of the service crew was great!"
Best Indian food,"we ordered Chicken dum Biryani, Tandoori Chicken and Seekh kabab. Food was excellent. We will go again to indulge other dishes. And we booked at Chope, its good platform for booking and you also get vouchers as well."
Great place for Indian food,We have visited this restaurant a couple of times and we must say the food and service is wonderful. They had a dome experience over the holidays and we did enjoy our lunch in the dome.

Great experience,"I had dinner at the AngloIndian caf√©. We book the ¬´ d√¥me exp√©rience ¬ª. I confess that I wanted to please my kids but didn‚Äôt expect too much of it. Actually I was very surprised how nice and out of time it feels inside the domes! The food, like usual at this restaurant was super good and the staff highly efficient! I warmly recommend for family or adults! Great experience !"
Great place for family or smaller groups of friends,"We had booked THE DOME @Chimes a part of the launch by Anglo Indian. When it comes for a well balanced Indian food - Anglo Indian is a good choice. Food is great - more tasteful than spicy. Our favourites are prawn star, panner tikka, butter chicken and railway mutton curry. Staff is always very energetic, polite and helpful. The ambience at the restaurant is very warm, however specially this time the DOME felt very cosy and safe. Great place and good food - highly recommended to lift some spirits."

Awesome experience, lovely decor, delicious food and great hospitality by all Anglo Indian staff. Thanks Vinod and team. Highly recommended."
Culmination of food and ambience,Anglo Indian cafe is a place where your heart is. They have a range of food items to satisfy your palate and tickle your taste buds. A place you would like to unwind with friends after a hard day at work. A place to create good memories with your family members. Highly recommended if you are visiting Singapore and craving Indian food.
Christmas Eve - Anglo Indian Dome,"Went for a small family dinner at the domes setup in Chijmes by Anglo Indian. We had to book in advance because understandably the concept was much in demand. Pre booking was seamless. Once we landed there, the staff was courteous and led us to our dome which was beautifully setup. The menu was pre-set and enough options for both vegetarians and non-veg alike. Really good food - the hara bhara kebab, chicken tikka, mutton railway curry were my favorites. I have my 4 year old along and he was delighted with the dome and the grass outside. The staff was incredibly polite and helpful and I would recommend the place :)"
Anglo Indian,"We had our first Dome dining experience in Chijmes and we would like to thank for the fabulous hospitality by Anglo Indian staff. Whether it‚Äôs was the variety of food, drinks or service everything was top notch. We would highly recommend to anyone. Veg kebabs, Mutton curry & Daal Bhukara are sumptuous.
It‚Äôs a must visit if you are going to Chijmes."
An experience,It was lovely experience of exotic food specially in Dome concept which was giving exclusive feeling. Kids enjoyed and danced on music inside dome without being noisy for people outside.
Dinner at Dome,"The ambiance was amazing, beautiful lights and decor with full privacy inside the dome. The food was excellent and so the service. Daal Bukhara was delicious üòã would highly recommend Anglo Indian for great hospitality, food and their prompt services."
The Dome at Chijmes with Anglo Indian Cafe & Bar,We had a lovely experience as a family seated in The Dome. The decor within the dome was pretty and the cooler provided kept us comfortable. The high-tea in such a setting was a unique experience indeed. The service & food was good. It was nice to meet the owner of the restaurant...a friendly gentleman . A pleasant experience on A Monday evening !!

Dinner with friends,"Fantastic food, ambiance and value for money. Must visit. Butter chicken, daal Bukhara, garlic naan üëçüèª"
An evening at Anglo Indian @ Chijmes,"We loved our time spent at Anglo Indian cafe and bar. We visited their Chijmes outlet. It was during the weekend rush hour. But the staff was very accomadating despite us having no reservation. The service was super fast too. And when it comes to food, it perfectly suited our taste buds. With moderate spices the food was very good. Our kids enjoyed it too. We loved the food, the ambience and the service."
Waste time and money!,"Was very crowded. Despite prior booking and ordering of food, they didn‚Äôt give the food as requested. Which yielded in poor service and quality of food. Overall taste was ok because of heating up the food twice."
"Great Ambience, Great Service","Went for lunch and my friend and I were the only diners there. Food was great, especially the Chicken Tikka curry with Garlic Naan. The former was so creamy and rich in taste. Service provided by Anita was excellent! She was very accomodating to our needs, highly attentive and jovial. Her bubbly personality lightened the mood and we enjoyed it! Highly recommended!"
Awesome Food & Ambience,The food was authentic and awesome. Ambience was excellent. Good Service. I would totally recommend that one should try and personally experience.
Not Your Normal Butter Chicken !!!,"The taste of the heavenly butter chicken & naan combo , is a taste that cant be found anywhere in Singapore , the butter chicken which you can feel the time and effort that they had spent in it ,
i will be back as my senses from my tongue are craving for more of their unique and flavorful and delicious food"
Super delicious,"The food taste Super delicious even for a Chinese like myself that seldom eat Indian food. My friend and I had a great time tasting all kind of curry (fish, mutton and butter chicken) there.

Go for the specialties appetiser to pair with your beer. If you are alone , Simply order the yummy chicken biryani (signature) and you will get a taste of heaven."

Lunch at Anglo Indian,"While it feels great to go out out for a working day lunch, it felt even better witb the quality of the food and service experience we had at Anglo Indian.

The Garlic Naan was brilliant snd the butter chicken sinful as ever.

Anita and Mandip were perfect hosts and made our experience worth the visit!

Cheers and hope you guys see many many more customers."
Great service :D,"Saw that they had a bad review and based on it, it seems that the restaurant has indeed improved their standards for service. The workers there are very friendly and they take extra precaution with customers due to COVID19. The manager even joked with us and the boss even greeted everyone, as well as sought for feedback on the food, ambiance and service. Their food is good, and wow the chicken briyani and cheese naan is so delish man. I will be coming back. Worth the try. Stay safe!"
Very hospitable,"I enjoyed the friendly atmosphere and had a great dinner with my friends. Food was tasty and the drinks were awesome.

The menu also included a variety of choices, such as vegetarian dishes, appetizers, bread etc. Definitely recommended if you want to have a nice, hearty meal with friends or family."
Great food!,"Biryani was the best, naan and chicken strips were good. The long island was not bad but I wish I could have had more! ;)"
The great Anglo Indian,Nice place to have a scrumptious meal with your friends. The staff are really hospitable! I would recommend this restaurant a 100 times.
Dine In,Amazing Food & Service A must Visit for North Indian Cuisineüíû My Favourite Starter Is Haryali Kebabs Love Them A Must To Have üòã
Anita service at Chjmes,"My visit to Anglo Indian Cafe the second time was again met with a pleasant one especially with Anita's warm and bubbly service which lightened up the atmosphere even though we were the only diners there at lunch. Kudos to her fantastic customer service.

Not forgetting the food, we enjoyed the food recommended by Anita too."
One of the best Indian meals,"Chijmes is a beautiful location for the restaurants to be located in. So, nothing more to add to that.

The Cafe & Bar is located amongst a row of cafes and has inside as well as outside seating.

Good service accompanied by excellent food is what distinguishes the place. Executive Chef Sahil Tomar and his team dished out simply awesome food. Joseph John and his team ensured that the service was prompt and polite.

Highly recommended for anyone desiring a good Indian meal."
College get together,We went to chimes Anglo Indian bar n restaurant for college guys get together who stay in Singapore. Great evening. Food was pretty good. Nice place to hang around. Thanks to the restaurant team for taking care of our get together nicely.
Excellent food. Would recommend,"Excellent food. Would recommend the lamb ragra, cooked to perfection with the right amount of spices.
The service was great, Anita was friendly and courteous. In the times of Covid-19 she was still smiling. The lunch time rush is reduced but there were still quite a few tables full."
Women's Day Celebrations,"Amazing Food & Desserts I would recommend the Anglo Indian Restaurant It has alway been my favourite joint at Chijmes to Hangout.. Good ambiance

Me & My Friend's Really Enjoyed..

The Staff There Were Very Friendly & Gave Us Very Good Service.."
Scrumptious food & excellent service,"Hi,
We organized our son's 1st birthday at this place. The venue was accommodating to our needs. Competitively priced and the staff was extremely friendly. Food was delicious, even our guests praised the quality of the food. The place was spacious, neat & clean."
First time experiencing proper Indian cuisine,"Its my first time eating proper Indian cuisine and i love the food. For starters, I would highly recommend the cheese naan if you‚Äôre a cheese lover with butter chicken curry on the side to dip your naan.

The briyani is very unique. None of that typical food court style briyani. Rice was soft and chicken was tender and surprisingly boneless which was always a struggle whenever there is bone in the chicken

Nachos was great, reasonable portion and a nice finger food for those who are looking to have a drink and chit chat

Only one downside is that the fried chicken tenders was very dry but none the last, i would recommend coming here if you‚Äôre looking for quality Indian cuisine."
What a fab restaurant,"Only in Singapore four nights and ate here twice. Food lovely, staff lovely and nice atmosphere. Enjoyed it give it a try. Chjimes area is lovely location x"
Great food and staff,"We visited here twice whilst in town. 1st time we were enticed in by the lovely staff and the service and food did not disappoint! We went back the 2nd time as the 1st time was so good and it was exactly the same...great food and staff were amazing, giving us some local tips for things to see and do. Nash and the staff are a credit to this place and when we are back in town we will be popping in for a bite."
Really great food,"I can see how difficult it would be to stand out in Singapore with all the amazing eateries there are, but the food at Anglo Indian was fabulous and reasonably priced.
I had the Ragra mutton which was delicious and my husband had the fish shaslik which was really well cooked and also delicious

Food was very reasonably priced and the ambience f the restaurant was lovely and welcoming. A good tick in their favour was that the cricket was on the TV.

Out server, Anita, couldn‚Äôt have been any nicer. Very attentive and helpful."
Easy Dinner,After having our Singapore Sling we went around the corner and crossed the road to get to this food court. We chose Indian where the food was a fine example of this cuisine. Staff are friendly and helpful.
Great food & service,"We visited the Chijmes restaurant for dinner, & ordered mains (2 vegetarian, 2 meat), some breads (naan, roti). All the mains & breads were so yummy! The people at the restaurant were also very friendly. Definitely a must try!"
Great place for a Singapore sling,"Very well located in a Chimes outdoor food court. Although we did not have a meal there , we went on two consecutive nights for a Singapore sling. Each time it was prepared as good if not better than at the Long bar and at a fraction of the price. Service was great in contrast to the ""production line"" why are you bothering me attitude at the Raffles Long bar. Highly recommend this cafe but note the last call is at 10:15 PM"
Must go,"What an awesome place and brilliant staff. We celebrated our daughters 18th birthday here.
It was very well organized from the planning of the menu to the final day. Jakhmola Ji was always available to suggest and discuss and was ready to accommodate to the requirement. Special thanks to the staff for being proactive to my guests needs.
A big thank you and all the best to Anglo Indian."
"Good Indian Food, Reasonably priced, Good Service","Good Indian Food, with reasonable prices, excellent customer service with a very polite and attentive staff - great experience with family !"
