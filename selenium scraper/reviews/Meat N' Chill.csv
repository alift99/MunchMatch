Crispy Skin Grilled Salmon,"Had the Crispy Skin Grilled Salmon, it was fresh, thick, and rich in flavor. $22 for the fish and 2 sides. Got fries and salad as my sides and I like this combo, the fries were very tasty and crispy! The salad was alright. Would recommend this place if you’re near the area!"
Grass-fed Ribeye,"Ordered the Grass-fed Ribeye, the steak was thick and juicy. Love the char on the steak, richness of flavours. It came with 2 sides, I ordered fries and mashed potato, fries were very crispy and crunchy, love the mushroom sauce in the mashed potato!"
Good experience for a reasonable price,"Ordered the seafood platter and the portion and seasoning on it is great The prawns were fresh along with the mussels.

The New York Sirloin’s portion is great too. Asked for a medium rare doneness, but some parts were too rare. But overall it’s a great meal.

I would recommend a group to come for the sharing platters and the steak!!"
Great place to have Pork Ribs & Steak,"We ordered the Signature Pork Ribs (very delicious) & Grain-Fed Flat Iron Steak (250g). Each main came with 2 sides (we took the straight-cut fries, Corn Bread, Cajun Rice & Asparagus).

The Pork Ribs were incredibly tender and flavourful! We could choose between 5 flavors and took 'Bourbon', which goes well with the Ribs. The Fries were crispy and fresh too. Would recommend this to those who love meats and American-style cuisines"
Super cozy and lovely food!,"Ordered the pork ribs with bourbon sauce (comes with 2 sides, straight-cut fries and cajun rice) and the a grass-fed flat iron steak with 2 sides as well (cornbread and asparagus).
I must say both dishes are cooked perfectly! The pork ribs were literally fall-off-the-bone tender and the thick slab of steak was cooked evenly! The sides did not fall short at all - my favourite was the cornbread! They have a wide variety of food, and the atmosphere was really cozy so i’ll definitely come back again for special occasion!"
Great food and service!,"Food was great! We ordered pork ribs and the meat was sooo tender, came off the bones so easily. Pasta was nice too, was a pleasant surprise."
massive portions,"came on a weekday afternoon and food came really quick. portions are massive! honey mustard ribs are tender and juicy w a delicious marinade, and the beef chilli fries were hugeee for its price. service was great as well!"
RECOMMENDED,"Would recommend others to order their popular Shira Cognac Beef short ribs! 10/10 worth the try. Very tender & juicy! Ordered their signature honey mustard pork ribs as well! Portion is good for sharing. For appetisers we got the soy garlic wings too. Reminds me of the Korean fried chicken. Overall was very filling and satisfying.

The ambience was great too. They have outdoor and indoor seating (2 levels). Able to host a large group on the 2nd level."
"Wonderful Meat , Flavourful Taste","i visited Meat N’ Chill on a reccomendation of a friend and i throughly enjoyed my experience ! I ordered the Shiraz Beef Short Ribs, Honey Mustard Pork Ribs, Vanilla Milkshake and Honey Soy glazed Chicken.

The Shiraz Beef short ribs and honey mustard pork rib were both so tender that no effort wss required to pull it off the bone. they were all packed full of flavour as well. i really liked the sauce of the shiraz beef short ribs , the shiraz really elevated the flavour profile.

the honey soy glazed chicken had a balance of sweet and salty , and the chicken was hot and crispy and piping hot. i enjoyed every bite of it !

i highly reccomend people to come and try it for yourselves. it really is one of the best places i have been to !"
"Amazing steak and ribs, totally blown away!","Really delicious American fare at reasonable prices! We ordered the pulled pork quesadillas and soy garlic wings for starters, and for mains we got their signature ribs and a New York strip. Everything was so scrumptious and delectable, the quesa is a MUST ORDER! I simply cant choose a favourite because every dish was perfect. The ambience also feels so homey and cosy with friendly service staff. I would totally come back again."
10/10 American Food,"Love the vibes of this small quaint restaurant at Sixth Avenue, perfect for residents there. For the rest of us parking may not be as easy, as there are limited slots around the building the restaurant is. Staff were super friendly and made sure we were well taken care of. The Classic Ribs were nearly fall-off bone soft and delicious. The New York Strip was decent and I personally enjoyed it a little bit more than my partner due to the charcoal grilled sears. We also ordered the soy sauce marinated wings and Quesadillas, which were both absolute bangers. 10/10 recommend and will definitely be back to try out the rest of the menu."
Flavourful meats and sides.,"Came to dine for a weekday dinner. Seated on the second floor. Ordered Shira Cognac Beef short ribs with coleslaw and chili beef fries while my partner ordered Bourbon BBQ pork ribs with corn bread and asparagus.

Taste of the beef short ribs was good however would be good if there was some vegetables like carrots as the meat was quite rich towards the end. The chili beef fries was delightful! The fries was crunchy, the chili beef had a nice texture to it (spotted capsicum and beans), taste wise was addictive! Would definitely order it next time.

The bourbon BBQ pork ribs was flavourful however not as fork tender. The corn bread had good texture with corn kernels in it. Love that they took effort to grill the asparagus for the smoky flavour.

We also ordered draft beer on tap which was good, fresh and crisp. Service was attentive too, service staff came to check on us and another table seated beside us."
Cozy restaurant,"A cosy restaurant located just a few minutes away from Sixth Avenue MRT. Warm and friendly staff welcomed us upon our arrival and were helpful with our questions on the menu. We had the honey mustard ribs and a steak. Both mains came with 2 sides, so its perfect for anyone who loves huge portions! The steak was well done and cooked to just the perfect tenderness. Would definitely like to come back again!"
Enjoyable dinner experience,Really enjoyed my dinner here! The mains and sides were perfectly cooked !! They were quite generous with the portions as well😌 The staff were very friendly and gave suggestions of the popular items. Highly recommended
yummy steak and friendly staff,"ordered the steak which was slightly on the pricy side out of all the items on the menu but well worth the money as the steak was yummy and was cooked very well - ordered medium rare and it was cooked perfectly!

really worth visiting this restaurant with friendly staff who are always eager to help and provide assistance."
Steak was well seasoned,The sauce went well with the steak and the sides were good. I recommend having it medium. The sides were fine. Would want to try other things on their menu.
Yummy food and friendly staff,"Food was yummy and I really liked the carbonara that I ordered - generous portion of ingredients and noodles. Portion of food was larger than expected and I could share my food with my partner.

The staff were really really friendly and made us feel at home! Really nice place to come as a couple and also as a family! Strongly recommend."
Great experience!,"The interior of the restaurant was really nice, had those cozy steakhouse vibes that’s really good for gatherings! Went there a little early and wanted to wait for my friend before entering but the friendly staff offered to get me seated inside first :)

We ordered and had to wait awhile for the food as there was quite a lot of people that day. Food was really great!! Absolutely loved the burger, it was soooo juicy and the chilli fries were great too!

Overall a great experience :)"
Great dining place,"Went to MeatnChill for dinner and I really enjoyed my time here! The ambience gives a warm and homely feel to it which is great for dates and meals with your loved ones!

Ordered the buffalo wings which the marination is really good and only gives off a mild spiciness (For someone who can’t take spiciness). We also ordered New York Strip and it was cooked to our preferred doneness perfectly! The strip was really thick and juicy too which is very worth for the pricing given!

5mins walk from Sixth Avenue MRT and recommended to make reservations first as there are limited seats."
Amazing salmon and root beer float,"Amazing for a place that serves great ribs and steaks, I was surprised to find their crispy skin grilled salmon was also perfectly cooked to the right texture and juicy flavours locked in.
The root beer float was also very good as it had a generous scoop of creamy rich vanilla ice cream. Such a satisfying meal!"
Western food at decent price,"For a simple western meal, this is the place. Good food & decent price. Coupled with attentive service, you can have a cosy quiet gathering with family & friends."
Meat N Chill food,"Food was well-cooked especially the soy garlic chicken, and the flavors were very strong! Would definitely recommend it. Mac N Cheese portion was huge, had some trouble finishing it. Downside is that the location was a little hard to find."
Delicious authentic BBQ and Mac n cheese,"First time visiting this restaurant as we were craving for authentic Bbq pork ribs. Decided to try this restaurant instead of going to our usual bbq restaurant i.e. Morganfield's.

Overall, we were happy that the ribs were really fall off the bones as described. The steak was pretty good as well and decent portion. The highlight was the truffle Mac n cheese which was very delicious!

It's a simple n down to earth authentic Bbq restaurant so don't expect any fancy decor and 'atas' ambience.

Highly recommended!"
Great hangout spot,"The burger was great, and the wings were fantastic! I highly recommend trying the soy garlic wings. The restaurant was very cozy and the waiters were extremely friendly. Definitely recommend visiting if you are in the area."
Get the pork ribs!,"I came back here for one of the best best pork ribs I have ever had, and it never fails to blow me away. I got the original pork ribs and it paired perfectly with the sweet BBQ sauce. Not to mention the generous portion and the sides were great (truffle fries and corn bread). Corn bread is a must!"
Best pork ribs!,"It's my first time here, tried the original pork ribs and ribeye steak. The pork ribs were so tender and flavourful! Also, the slight spicy, sweet sauce went together with the meat really well. Enjoyed the hot and crispy truffle fries on the side too! Friendly staff and good service :)"
nice place for a hangout 😆,"Cozy place, conveniently located near Sixth Avenue MRT station. Staff were attentive and provided great service. Portions were huge! Meat on the ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender—would recommend sharing :)"
Original ribs,"Had the original ribs and I must say the portion is seriously HUGE, had trouble finishing it but was enjoyable nonetheless, really tender meat with a delicious sauce to go with. Also shoutout to the friendly staff there as well who even checked if aircon was too cold for us."
"Great atmosphere, Even better food","Had a pleasant experience at Meat N' Chill, the staff was friendly and the food was great too. Ordered the New York Strip steak. The steak was cooked well and was very tender and was really good paired with the red wine sauce. Highly recommended!"
"Good Service, Nice Food","The original ribs was surprisingly quite filling. Highly reco to share! Meat from the ribs was relatively tender and the sauce complements the ribs so well. Could literally taste the potato from the and wouldn’t mind ordering another serving of fries the next time I go. The salad could have been better imo with different types of veg like onions, purple cabbage etc

Also ordered the Chrizo Mac & Cheese which was quite decent. Doesn’t feel jelat at all as the sauce wasn’t too cheesy or thick. Good for sharing. Would’ve preferred if they topped it up with ham too"
"great ribs, great service!","v chill eatery w gr8 service and good food! ordered the chorizo mac and cheese + original ribs. I was quite shook because they were really generous w the chorizo. ribs were also p good w v a very moreish glaze, tho wish the salad we ordered as a side had more variety to better complement the meat."
Good food!,The pork ribs was really delicious and tasty! Don’t feel like the meat around the bone was very thin but rather meaty. The staff was very friendly too. Highly recommended.
Nice ambience,"Easily accessible from MRT and no problem to get a parking along the back lanes, free parking in the evening. Order the burger and beef steak companies with red wine. The patty was tender and juicy except a little salty on the top layer. Beef blended well either the recommendation of red wine. Price is in average range. Recommend to go there for family and couples."
Fantastic burger,"The burger was fantastic! Loved how tender and juicy it is. However the surface of the meat was a little bit too salty for my liking. We also ordered the steak but was a bit too tough, however it was still nice. Also enjoyed the ambience and the convenience of the place, very easily accessible from the MRT!"
Delicious Ribs!,I had the ribs here and it was amazing. Would get them again if I come back! The service was also really good.
Lovely pork ribs,"Service at Meat N’ Chill was really good. Ordered two ribs dishes and a seafood dish containing mussels for a party of two. The portion sizes are hearty and we were very full at the end, almost couldn’t finish. The ribs were nice and tender, very easier to cut through, although the marinade was on the saltier side. Mussels were cooked nicely as well. Would recommend this place!"
Fantastic restaurant with yummy ribs!,"Went to get dinner with my family. It is conveniently located near the MRT with alot of parking space around it also.
 
The atmosphere was cosy and quiet and the staff were really friendly and helpful. 
 
We ordered the original pork ribs as well as the three little pigs burger for our mains. The pork ribs are a must get - it is seasoned well and falling-off-the-bone tender. The sauce is not overly sweet and goes really well with the cornbread too!  

Another must try is their quesadilla. It has generous servings of pulled pork with cheese and also comes with a side of salad. 

Serving portions are on the large side here. We ordered a main each and was unable to finish everything. 

Overall an enjoyable meal and will definitely be back again to try other flavours of ribs available!"
Value for money pork ribs!,"Ordered the Old God Mother Pork Ribs, Original Pork Ribs and the Garlic n' White Wine Baked Mussels.

Portions were really generous for the price point, definitely a plus point! Especially so for the mussels!

Old God Mother Pork Ribs (at the top) were not bad, but the meat tended to be a bit tougher than the Original Pork Ribs for me. Personally, I really liked the Original Pork Ribs and the sauces and flavours, but given the portion, it was a little too much. Very good for sharing! Would definitely come back here again!

Atmosphere was also really good, and the staff were really attentive and the service was good too.

Overall, good experience and worth the money!"
Great Place with Amazing Ribs,"Went on a weekday evening with friends. Was greeted the moment we walked in and the staff around was really helpful to make sure the dishes were to our liking.

The atmosphere was cosy and quiet - good for hanging out with friends after work or having a meal with the family.

Was very fascinated by the variety of tea they offered. Tried kyo breakfast tea and it had a very intersting flavour. Would totally come back to try the other tea options offered!

For appetizers we had the quesadilla. It is a must try as the flavour of the pulled pork was fantastic and they were very generous with their cheddar.

For mains we had the original prok ribs as well as the three little pigs burger.
The ribs were well cooked and the meat was falling off the bone tender. It goes really well with the pickled celery which is very refreshing. The pickled celery here is pretty unique as it has a strong spices taste which I enjoy and I rarely find elsewhere.

The burger is a good alternative to the pork ribs, with generous portions of spam, bacon and pulled pork. The side of fries which came with the burger was also freshly fried and crispy.

Serving portions are on the large side here - we even had to takeaway some of our food.

In all a satisfying meal and will be back again to try the other flavours of ribs."
Come here for the Ribs!,"Not too shabby, ambience is nice. Pasta tasted homemade and I meant that positively because you could taste the passion in it. Came for the beef but it was sold out, understandable because the pork ribs was so tender and juicy. Dessert was amazing too, ice cream on cheesecake was new to me"
Amazing food and ambience,Cosy ambience to really “chill”. Would definitely recommend ordering the ribs. The pork ribs were extremely tender and charred to perfection. Definitely one of the best pork ribs I have eaten. Finished the meal off with a cheesecake that had a slight tangy flavour. Certainly a 5/5 meal.
Great ribs and vibes,"As its name suggests, come here if you want to eat good meat and chill. The ribs are amazing, really tender and flavourful. Pair it with a glass of red and it makes for a very nice meal with friends or loved ones"
Cosy restaurant!,"This place is really cosy and nice for a good catch up. We both ordered pork ribs (hickory and the carolina bbq) because we've heard good reviews about it. The food came and they were really good! The meat was soft and flavourful and together with the sides, they go really well. We both agreed that we will not hesitate to come back the next time!"
First experience,"Reasonably price foods, for its taste and portion. Ordered the flat-iron steak which was cooked perfectly. Meat was tender, juicy and very well-seasoned."
Value for money steak!!!,"Ordered the 250g Flat Iron Steak. It was perfectly seasoned and done just to my liking. For a very reasonable price, the steak is actually very juicy and full of flavour!"
Great ribs and tortilla,Tried the tortilla set and the honey mustard ribs and they were delicious! The ribs were packed with flavour and the tortilla set came with great dips to go with the pulled meats!
Come here for the ribs!,"Heard that this place had good ribs, and wasn’t disappointed! Original ribs were juicy and tasty. Ribeye steak was well cooked too. The portions felt a bit small for the price paid, would have given 5 stars otherwise."
Value-for-money Tortilla Set Sharing Platter,"The Tortilla Set Sharing Platter offers a variety of option such nacho chips, tortillas as the base, with their generous portion of pulled pork and chicken as a healthy protein, not forgetting their guacamole and nacho cream cheese which packs additional creaminess and flavour to the chips and meat."
Cheezy and Crunchy,"like the warm vibes here. the staff are friendly. got myself a cobbs salad and love it. Generous amount of cheedar cheese 🧀 which blends very well with other ingredients. it's perfect for cheese lover. Cheesy, crunchy, and savoury! 👍"
Amazing pork ribs,"Fantastic pork ribs! I was blown away when I took my first bite. 5 pieces of ribs was super filling and good for sharing. The sides (mashed potato and corn bread) were really good too. The tomato soup however, was nothing to shout about and would have been better if they added cream. Nevertheless, it was great for the price, and I look forward to going again."
Superb Pork Ribs!,A most pleasant dining experience. Restaurant is not too crowded at dinnertime and orders are served promptly. The Golden Carolina BBQ Pork Ribs I ordered is very tasty and portion is HUGE! Should have ordered more side dishes to go with it! Will definitely go back to try other food on the menu
Must try Steakhouse!!!,"The Medium Rare Steak I had was sooooooo tender, juicy and succulent! The thought of it is already making me salivate! It was a huge portion of meat served, and I thoroughly enjoyed every single bite of it. Will definitely be back for more!!!

The environment is ideal for friends or couples to chill and unwind after a long day of work. The service was great, and we were greeted with warm smiles when we were served.

Overall a 10/10, will definitely recommend the place to my family and friends, and this will be my new go-to place if I am craving steaks."
Great Food and atmosphere,"A short walk from Sixth Avenue MRT, the restaurant had a nice ambiance and great service. Ordered the Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich that came with coleslaw and fries. Would have liked to be able to change the coleslaw option in the online order but the sides were still satisfying. Portions were large and the steak inside was really tender and well worth the price. Definite recommend. Overall a really great place for a meal."
Lovely Diner Near Sixth Avenue,"Homey American-style diner near Sixth Avenue station. Ordered the bourbon Ribs ($26) with mashed potatoes and butter corn. The ribs were amazingly tender and the Bourbon sauce was really good. The mashed potatoes were equally good, being creamy and possessing full-bodied flavor. The Root Beer Float ($5.50) complemented the ribs well as a delightful treat of a meal. Would come visit again given the opportunity!"
Mouth watering Pork Ribs!!!,"These glistening Original Pork Ribs were so tender and juicy, definitely a 5/5 for me and I'm missing it already!

The environment is perfect for gatherings with friends and theres many drinks options too.

The service was awesome and staff were thoughtful (we chat and ate for so long that we stayed past the opening hours by 5 minutes, the staff were still polite with warm smiles, thank you!). Looking forward to visit again!"
Great food and atmosphere,"Place was small and simple, conveniently located near the mrt (though you'll need an umbrella if it rains). I can imagine coming down to this place for some good steaks and ribs while ordering a bottle of wine to go with. I tried the new york strip and was happy that it wasn't as tough as I know a new york strip to be. Their ribs were fall of the bone tender too with interesting flavours. Would recommend!"
Cosy western diner,"2022-05-04 lunch Calamari rings - Excellent. Great breading and texture Chilli cheese fries - Good. Generous portion and the toppings worked well together Original ribs - Excellent. Very tender, and has been kindly deboned for us"
Great ribs and chill atmosphere,"The food was great and the portions were quite big! We visited at lunchtime and ordered pork ribs which were surprisingly soft, chili cheese fries (very large portion with generous sauce), and calamari. I appreciated that the ribs were flavourful and had very few bones!
The staff were also very friendly :)"
Amazing Pork Ribs and Steak!,"Highly recommend the “walk in the park” pork ribs! The ribs were tender and juicy, while the sauce is spicy and delicious! Also had the steak which came with two sides as well. The steak was flavourful and juicy! The service crew were nice and attentive to my needs as well, asking if I need any other things or even small actions of passing a chair for me to put my bag on it. In all, I had a really good experience in Meat N’Chill!"
Excellent place for Ribs,"I ordered their “walk in the park” (pork ribs) under the Spicy YOLO Challenge. The BBQ pork ribs were the best ribs that I have ever tried at this price range. It was reasonably priced at $25.50, and the portion was good with the selection of two sides. The ribs were perfectly cooked and incredibly soft, to the extent that it fell off from the bone smoothly without much knifework. For spicy lovers, you will fall in love with the robust spicy gravy. Food aside, the service crew is very friendly and attentive to our needs.

Excellent place for ribs! Will definitely come back again to try the other ribs.
P.S. Please note that you need to sign an indemnity form before attempting any ribs under the Spicy YOLO Challenge and trust me, it is worth it!"
Dining at Meat N Chill,"I tried the Shira Cognac Beef Short Ribs , and I must say it is one of the best in town I have ever eaten. The meat is cooked and seasoned perfectly and the meat is chewy, moist and not too dry. it really lives up to the name and title of ""The Meanest Ribs in Town"". The portion was also appropriate and goes really well with the sides that I have ordered. Will definitiely recommend this brand to others to try. 9.5/10"
Dining at Meat N Chill,"I tried the Mango Sriracha Rib, a special release by Meat N Chill as it was their 7th birthday. The meat was seasoned perfectly and the meat fell off the bone smoothly and easily, will give it a 8/10. had a really full and hearty meal as the portions are big, alongside the side dish that we ordered ( fries and coleslaw). the staff are really helpful and friendly and even offered to ask if we wanted to change seat as we were sitting under the air condition. perfect place for a dinner getaway with old friends with the cosy and comfortable environment."
Nice ribs ! Def sit inside!,Really good ribs and super friendly staff. We sat outside as only table left but only do this if there is on two or three of you.
Cozy little establishment with great vibes!,"We started with the calamari which was really fresh and flavorful. I had the ribs which was tender and the meat fell off the bone easily. The service was good as well, staff are very attentive and thoughtful! Highly recommend."
Delicious steak and friendly staff,"For the starters, we ordered the calamari which was quite fresh. However, the batter was not fried as crispy as we would have liked. Would give it a 4/5. For the mains, I ordered the steak which was very flavorful and juicy, highly recommended 5/5. Staff were attentive and friendly as well, which made the atmosphere very comfortable."
Juicy RIBS,"The restaurant is cosy and comfortable. Location wise, its nearby the mrt station, hence its it's pretty convenient. The staff are friendly and attentive, they made us feel comfortable throughout the entire meal and checked on us once in a while. Food was served reasonably fast. I ordered the lamb ribs. The orange mint sauce was super delicious and the lamb was so well done that the meat was succulent and juicy. I love that the meat didnt stick to the bone hence it was so easy to eat! I truly enjoyed my meal!"
Delicious Ribs,We ordered Lamb and Pork ribs for dinner and the ribs were so tender. Highly recommend the pork ribs with honey mustard as the meat was well seasoned and falls of the bone. Side condiments were all right and the overall experience was very satisfying.
Dinner at Meat N Chill,"It's my first time here and the food was really nice and the portions were huge. It's not a loud place by any means which makes it really good for catching up with friends and date nights. Special mention here is the ribs which were really good and there were a whole bunch of flavours to try. It'd probably take at least a few more visits to finish them all. The truffle mac and cheese was really good too, fragrant but still nicely subtle."
hearty dinner!,"really yummy food with cozy vibes! pork ribs are really fall-off-the-bone like the other reviews say, and liked that the meat was still so flavourful too! mac&cheese had a really fragrant truffle taste and had loads of other ingredients too. overall my favourite was the chilli cheese fries, the fries just came hot and crunchy and the chilli and cheese sauce was such a good combination, and the portion is freaking huge !!!! overall i went home w a happy food baby hehe next time i would defo save space to try their desserts!"
Catchup over good steak,"First time here and was impressed by the angus ribeye. It was soft and flavourful and pairs well with my chosen sides of buttered corn and mashed potatoes. Ambience was cosy, service was good and music hit the right spots. Overall an enjoyable dinner."
Dinner at Meat And Chill,"Quaint and cosy ambiance. Rather enjoyable for a dinner date with friends. Good portions with well grilled meats. My favourites would be the spicy signature pork ribs and corn bread. The ribs at Meat and Chill are fall off the bone tender and coated with finger-licking sauce. The corn bread was delightful, sweet and moist without being too dense. I would recommend adding one of the salads as a palette cleanser. The slight sourness in the vinaigrette and freshness of the green salad complemented the meats really well."
Juicy steak,"Ordered the New York Strip (medium rare) along with two sides and red wine sauce. When it was first served, the steak looked thick and juicy! It was cooked to how i liked it to be- a little pink and soft in the middle. I also got the classic vanilla ice cream with warm brownie for dessert, which thoroughly satisfied my sweet tooth. The waiters were attentive and courteous. Overall, I would definitely visit this cozy restaurant again!"
Soft and flavorful ribs,"Original Ribs from their signature selection were flavourful and really soft! Loved how it came with 2 sides of choice and the ribs came off the bone easily. New York strip was not bad too, really liked the mashed potato and coleslaw helps to give the dish a different colour! Ended off our dinner on a sweet note with fudgy brownie with a scoop of ice cream. Quite worth for price point, and most importantly, very good service staff who catered to our needs :)"
Tender ribs,"Had a Tortilla sharing platter Set, Bourbon Pork Ribs with sides of mashed potatoes and fries, and Calamari Rings. The sharing set was more than enough for 2, with flavorful chicken and pork, cheese sauce, guacamole, and tomatoes, DIY style! Known for their ribs, they do not disappoint, with tender meat that slides right off the bone, with a balanced glaze. Staff were really helpful and warm!"
Great food and experience!,"Ordered the Tortilla Set and Bourbon Pork Ribs! Really enjoyed the flavour and tenderness of the meat, ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender😍 Staffs were really friendly and welcoming too!"
Meat N' Chill,"Went to Meat n' Chill with my partner for a date night, and it was lovely. Great service from the staffs there and the food taste great with generous portions!

We ordered the mac and cheese, angus ribeye, chilli cheese fries and soup of the day!

We got medium well steak, and it was done nicely with still a little pinkish meat in the middle. The meat and sauce was fragrant and tender. The mac and cheese was cheese but not too much and the tomato soup (soup of the day) was very refreshing too!

And we love the chilli fries! And the portion is huge, really value for money. Definitely recommend to share among friends over drinks. Overall great experience and will definitely return for more~"
Good food and nice atmosphere,"Had a lovely dinner here and tried the Mac n' cheese which was really rich and delicious! Had the Chilli Cheese Fries as well and the portion was very generous, good for sharing with friends!

Good food cosy ambience,"Had the Signature Bourbon Ribs and Texas Style Beef Back Ribs, and they were certainly a treat! The Bourbon Ribs were almost falling off the bone and incredibly tender, and the seasoning was also delicious and generously slathered on. The Beef Back Ribs were interesting, as it was my first time trying any sort of beef ribs. Paired with a good traditional BBQ sauce, it was certainly an interesting new experience. Overall, a good experience and cosy environment I would definitely revisit!"
Great food and wonderful ambience!,"We ordered some pork ribs as well as beef back ribs. The pork ribs were absolutely tender, paired really well with its seasoning and sauce. The beef back ribs were pretty good too! Was a great experience overall and definitely perfect for those rainy nights when you want something savory and meaty. Can't wait to go back again!"
Lovely Catchup Meal,"We were shown to a very cozy spot at the corner of the restaurant, in front of the Christmas Tree! The Aloha! Grilled Chicken Sandwich was tender and moist; paired with the salad gave it a refreshing finish. The sandwich also came with iced lemon tea and a scoop of ice cream. Portion-wise, it was very hearty for one."
Good ribs with nice ambiance,"Tried the Grain-fed Flat Iron (medium well) with coleslaw and corn bread. I can feel the juiciness and tenderness of the steak with every bite of the meat. It was very flavourful and well-cooked. The sides I ordered were also delicious and value for money. Ended the meal with a fudgy brownie with vanilla ice cream, which was a nice match! The restaurant has a nice ambiance too, a great place for gathering with family and friends."
Soft and tender ribs,"Have to try the ribs! I got the bourbon ribs which is tender, very flavorful and only slightly spicy so its suitable for kids too. Portion may look small in pic but its actually pretty big. Got the cajun rice and truffle fries as sides. The sides were decent.

Friendly staff that checks up on us every so often.

Worth a try!"
Dinner with Friend,"Started with a tangy tomato soup as appetiser. Then moved onto Golden Carolina BBQ, A very generous Truffle Fries, very crisp & delicious Really big, meaty ribs with rich, savoury BBQ sauce. Ambience is very cozy, service is very friendly & proactive"
Tender and juicy pork ribs,"Decided on Old God Mother pork ribs with a side of coleslaw and chili cheese fries. The ribs were very well cooked, tender and juicy and the marinade was spicy and flavorful :) we also had the cobs salad. Tasty and refreshing! the portion is pretty big too so it’s great for sharing! Will definitely be back to try the items on the menu :)"
Great Ribs Place in Sixth Avenue,"Located just a 3 mins walk away from Sixth Avenue MRT, Meat n Chill is a perfect dinner place if you're in the mood for some delicious pork ribs. We got the chilli flavoured one which was not too spicy, but still left a slight kick that we really enjoyed. Flavour aside, the meat was so tender and it slid off the bone so easily. Comes with 2 sides; would recommend getting the chilli cheese fries!"

Best quesadilla,One of the best quesadilla I have ever eaten. Pork ribs are tender and flavorful! Service crews are friendly and helpful.
Dinner,"Had their grain fed flat iron with mash potatoes and fries as sides! The meat was cooked well, and the fries were really tasty!! Portion was big for the price and location is convenient near the MRT. Will be back to try the other dishes!"

Love the place!,"Steak and ribs were both great, especially the ribs that were super tender and flavourful. Service staff were really friendly and they even gave us a complimentary glass of wine for a really tiny order mix-up! We really appreciated that. All in all, an extremely hearty meal and I dare say we'd be back soon!"
Juicy Ribs & Great Service!,"Staff were very attentive and made sure we were comfortable. Ribs were meaty and tender – was pleasantly surprised! Chilli cheese fries are a must and I enjoyed myself here. Portions are hugeeeee.

Warming for the tummy,"Had an enjoyable lunch! The soup was refreshing and good for digestion. The salmon paired with mash and salad, was well cooked."
Worthwhile visit,"Ordered Buffalo Wings, Original Pork Ribs & Truffle Pasta.
Buffalo wings was crispy, with appropriate seasonings applied to make the dish more tasty. Pork ribs was relatively good, comes with two sides of your choice, and they taste good too. Truffle pasta has the unique truffle taste to it and the pasta was cooked just right. The cheese applied on the truffle pasta goes well and enhances the savory taste of the cheese, well blended with bacon slices.
Staff service was superb. Upon entering the premises, was greeted warmly and was served iced water right away. When asked for recommendations, the staff patiently explained the best recommendations for us to come to an informed decision of our preferences. Excellent!
