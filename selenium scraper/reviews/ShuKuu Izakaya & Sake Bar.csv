"Wagyu beef, cold beef and chicken heart skewer","Located near CBD area, perfect place to chill and hang out with friends/colleagues after work. Wagyu beef skewer was the favourite dish, super juicy and flavourful! Would definitely come again"
Shukuu Izakaya,Really crowded even on a weekday‚Ä¶ do make your reservation before coming! We ordered many things (as seen in the picture) but my favourite was the A4 wagyu and their gyudonn!! Good food good vibe!! Loved it! My partner really loved the oyster too!!
Order the Kani Gratin,"Staff was friendly and there were many diners in the restaurant. The price and food are value for money!

Ordered the Buta minced katsu, Rosti mentai, Kani Gratin, Torikawa oroshi ponzu and gyu don to try! I think overall was less than $60 for so many dishes.

Particularly enjoyed the Kani Gratin (crab gratin with mentaiko). Wanted to order a second portion after trying!! But I had to save my stomach for the rest of the dishes. The Torikawa oroshi ponzu (chicken skin with grated radish and citrus soy-sauce) was also special to try! Loved the ponzu sauce and I couldn‚Äôt stop eating the chicken skin! The Buta minced katsu (home-made minced pork cutlet) was a good portion to share and was crispy on the outside but juicy in the inside!!

Overall would recommend! Better to reserve as it gets crowded during dinner time."
Great place for drinks and snacks,Great ambience with great decorations. The staff was friendly and provided us with some recommendations for the sake when we were deciding. The mini spicy salmon don was delicious and paired really well with the sweet sake.
Great place for Izakaya,"Delicious and well done Izakaya! Dishes really complemented their drinks! Great with families and friends, plus furkids üòä"
Juicy beef,The staffs were very welcoming and we were seated promptly. The place had a great ambience and it served as a vibrant place for social gatherings. The staffs even recommended some of their dishes. The one dish that stood out to me was the beef mini bowl. The beef was juicy and tender and it was paired together with some sweet sakae.
Nice Grilled Skewers,"The grilled skewers taste very good, love the juicy squid and pork belly! Nice Japanese bar vibes too!"
good spot for chill drinks & bites,favourite dish was the grilled squid which was paired nicely with the mayo dip. ambience is good for chill vibes & drinks especially if you work nearby
Yummy food,"Yummy fresh sashimi and octopus, atmosphere was very vibrant and vibes were good for gatherings and a good drinks session"
Amazing experience,"Amazing experience! Beautiful and authentic place, the food was fantastic and the service excellent. Special mention to Mario, he made the experience even better with his great service and advises on the food. It will be our first stop when we come back to Singapore again!"
Dinner at ShuKuu Izakaya & Sake Bar,"The fried shrimps very nice and crispy, chicken karaage came in a generous portion. Enjoyed the shredded potatoes with mentaiko sauce too!"
order kawa ebiage!!!,"we went on a hungry monday evening and ordered 6 dishes! for izakaya sizes, this was more than filling. my favourite would be the kawa ebiage, would be a great snack to go with beer, or even by itself :) even though its stated as mini, the gyu don was a sufficient portion, w generous servings of perfectly seasoned beef. spicy salmon don was delicious too!"
Great food!,"Ordered the Rosti Mentai, Gyu Don and Aburi Shimesaba (torched vinegared mackerel). All the dishes were very tasty and flavourful. The Rosti Mental had a generous portion of mentaiko and the Aburi Shimesaba was so tender and savoury. Will definitely drop by again!"
Great food and good ambience!,"Had my dinner here and I have got to say this is one the best dining experience I‚Äôve had in a while! Tried the mackerel, mentai rosti and pork belly & beef don! Really good food here :) Highly recommended üëç"
Great weekday night dinner,"Walked into this quaint Izakaya bar and was glad to find an assortment of delectable dishes.

The standout dishes were the pork skewers that were flavourful, juicy and had a smoky aftertaste, and the spicy salmon don which had a nice amount of spice kick on a bed of warm beady jap rice.

My only gripe was that I wished the portions were bigger!"
Great Izakaya vibes with many noteworthy dishes!,"Came by Shukuu Izakaya on a weekday night. Pretty surprised how packed it was, so there was a certain degree of noise.

Ordered a variety of dishes, of which a couple left an impression. The crab roe mentaiko was pretty interesting and delicious! Spicy salmon don hit all the right notes- light and spicy.

The place has nice Izakaya vibes so if you‚Äôre looking for that this is the place to be!"
Great hang out place with delicious food,"Drop by Shukuu Japanese Izakaya & sake bar the other day and was impressed with the traditional Japanese Izakaya vibes. Very good place for large groups, the place can be a little noisy, so please take note of that.

Ordered the Premium salmon roe on sushi rice and their Homemade minced pork cutlet, Mentaiko rosti and the Shukuu's chicken bites. The ikura (Salmon roe) used was fresh and gave off a salty taste which compliment the well-seasoned sushi rice. The chef gave a generous serving of ikura as well.

The minced pork cutlet was flavourful with a crispy exterior with a mushy (in a good way~) interior. The dish is also served along with a tangy sauce which makes it a little overpowering for my tastebuds however overall a great dish.

Mentaiko rosti was a little bland however love the mentaiko (though not much of it)

The chicken bites had a crispy exterior however it was tender on the inside. Serve up with a squezze of lemon and mayo.

Price-wise, the place is still rather affordable with dishes around $10 and up

Overall, it was a good experience! Would recommend to come!"
Great Food at ShuKuu Izakaya,"The ikura/salmon used in the bowl was very fresh (although the cut of the salmon was a little too small), and the rice was quite well-seasoned, although slightly mushy.

The chicken was quite well-prepared and the sauce provided was just right, but I think the chicken should be cut into smaller portions.

The mentaiko rosti, on the other hand, was a little hard and was not very appealing, but makes up for it with the great portion and taste of the mentaiko sauce.

But a good experience nonetheless!"
Great food,"One of the first meals we received were a variety of charcoal skewers that we had ordered.The skewers had a unique smokey flavor and were very well cooked. Also had the spicy salmon bowl, and the spicy sauce packs a punch!I really enjoyed the ambiance and environment here, and would recommend going after work to chill. Excellent cuisine with a broad selection of dishes, including sushi, skewers, and don bowls."
Best Sapporo in town,"Ordered Sapporo, Rosti Mentai and Tori Karage and honestly it‚Äôs one of the best I‚Äôve had in my life! Will definitely come back here again!"
Good food with good service,Reservation process was swift. Well greeted to our table. And food was definitely great. Love their Dry Sake too. Great ambience though it could get a little noisy when it‚Äôs full house.
Great Japanese in Singapore!,"Excellent mix of asian food, preferably japanese. Nigiri to die for and great tempura. Good service and nice to sit outside om Stanley Rd."
lovely place!,"service was impeccable & food was great - the black squid ika was awesome , so was the blue fin tuna sashimi & gui-don & saba ‚Ä¶ gyu-tan was so-so generally can improve by making the cooked food hotter"
IM AMAZED,The atmosphere was amazing and the food was great! I didn‚Äôt expect that the Mentaiko Rosti would taste so amazing?! I would definitely go back for it again! I would recommend the Beef Ponzu and the Char Siew Jowl! These 3 goes well with each other!
üíØ Wagyu skewer!,Juicy and Tender! Glistening and Decadent. The Wagyu Skewer!! Ikari Eggs Pop in My Mouth With Bursts of Ikari Juice!üëçüèª‚ú®
Chill place to hangout after work,"Great food, great atmosphere to chill out on a Friday night. We had the seared beef fillet with ponzu, as well as swiss-style potato shreds with mentaiko. These dishes were very tasty and flavorful. Would definitely drop by again!"
Amazing Japanese skewers!,"We ordered the Kani Gratin, Spicy Salmon Don and skewers. The Kani Gratin is delicious, with very savoury cheese and macaroni. The Spicy Salmon Don was good with the fresh salmon and sauce that further elevate the taste. Finishing off with the beef, chicken and pork skewers and the Tochigi Wagyu A4 is a must to order! The beef is tender and juicy coupled with the sauce that elevated the umami taste, highly recommended!"
Visit after work,The food is amazing. The ambience is awesome and the staffs are friendly too !! ordered this salmon egg bowls. It is delicious
A must visit if you wanna chill after a long day of work,"Awesome food and atmosphere! The char siew is the best by far on the menu! Mix with the sauce, it is amazing. Along with the egg as well, it is a pretty good combination. Good place to chill after a long day of work, as there are alcohol and other drinks too! The other food on the menu are worth the try too!"
Like the food but will not return again,"It is not my first time here and I enjoy the food and sakes. The reason why I will not return is because of the toilet. To some people, this may not be important but it is to me. The restaurant was full and very busy on a regular evening but there is only one unisex toilet available. Patrons were unable to use the toilet without stepping on urine on the floor. Even the design of the toilet is flawed - it is a small cubicle with an average-sized door so when opening from the inside, you will end up brushing your leg in between the door and the toilet or waste paper bin. It was a rather horrifying experience.
Giving it a 3-star because I really liked some of the dishes but hygiene of a restaurant is really important too."
Slightly pricey but quality food,"Very knowledgeable staff on sake pairings‚Ä¶ fish was extremely fresh, although price tends to be on the higher side. Yakitori was well seasoned too.

We were seated at a secluded corner, and they did feel slightly understaffed but servers were patient and overall we had a positive experience"
Nice and cozy,"Nice and cozy atmosphere with good food! The portion size was a bit small and the place was crowded and understaffed, but the staff were patient and friendly, explaining to us how to drink the sake."
Great Menu!,"Ordered the agedashi tofu, tako wasabi, rosti mentai, pork jowl sushi, salmon sushi and maguro sushi.

Agedashi tofu was good, soft on the inside and the outside (and bonito flakes) were nice. Did not expect the tako wasabi to look raw, but it tasted really good! Lightly salted with a hint of wasabi, really refreshing! Rosti mentai was really good too! The mentaiko sauce really bombed!

Pork jowl sushi was really tender and and nicely seasoned. Salmon sushi and maguro sushi tasted really fresh and good, especially with the sweet wasabi.

Overall, good visit! Will definitely recommend and return again :)"
Nice Izakaya Spot,"Ordered a variety of dishes, best menu items we tried were the skewers (chicken gizzard and black pork collar tasted great, loved the texture and flavour profile). Other notable selections include the pork jowl nigiri and rosti mentai, would highly recommend!"
Great japanese food,"My dining partner and I ordered a total of 6 dishes with a glass of sake each. Gyu ponzo - cold starter, was refreshing. Rosti mentaiko is yummy. Salmon sashimi is fresh. The skewers are done well; slow cooked iberico pork tasted normal. The oden soup was pretty filling, the fishcakes and really huge. Sake of the day was really nice, we tried the sweet versions. Overall spent over $100 for 2 pax. Good atmosphere, a bit short staffed at certain periods but good experience."
Great food and ambience!,"Great food and ambience! Rosti mentaiko was really nice with a generous portion portion of mentaiko sauce, skewers were great too. Service was quick and crew was attentive when it came to refilling water for us. Overall a nice play to chill and hangout after work :)"
Lovely,Had a wonderful meal at Shukuu Izakaya. There is a wide selection of Japanese artisanal Sakes chosen to pair with the exquisite meals available. The place had a really nice ambiance too with lovely paintings across the walls.
Amazing food & ambience!,"Ordered a selection of charcoal skewers, which were the first dishes to arrive! The skewers were cooked really well and had a distinct smokey aroma. I also ordered the Spicy Salmon and Negitoro don with a carafe of their sake of the week, and it was definitely an amazing pairing! All in all, the warm atmosphere created a very relaxing environment, great for a night to unwind after a long day."
Amazing Rosti Mentaiko from High End Japanese Restaurant,"I really enjoyed the atmosphere, best item we had was the rosti mentaiko. A very decent place for hangouts, skewers and sake were good as well. Overall enjoyable experience and would return"
good catch-up with friends,"the food (roastie mentaiko, skewers) we ordered is good. pricing wise, the food is on the higher end. ambience is good with traditional japanese vibes. good place for catching up with friends! :) however, food took a little long to be served."
Á¥†Êô¥„Çâ„Åó„ÅÑ„ÅÆÂ±ÖÈÖíÂ±ã,"Visited shukuu izakaya on 4 april and was pleasantly surprised by the ambience of the restaurant! Servers were polite and ushered us to the seats quickly. We tried the nigiris and several japanese tapas. The highlight for me wld be the yellowtail nigiri as it had a rich but slightly sweet taste. The fats were in the right amount as well. Another dish worth mentioning is the mentaiko rosti as the rosti was nicely seasoned with the umami sauce and was fried to a golden crisp. The taste was addictive. Overall, a very good place to come and visit with ur friends to explore around town!"
Casual dinner at shukuu izakaya,"Stumbled upon this gem of a restaurant, the staff was friendly and the food was very appetising and inviting. Extensive food choices with quality ingredients, the sushi was very fresh and is worth a visit for."
Skewers and Sake place!,"Ambience here is great if you are looking for chill place to have Jap food. Tried their skewers, Tori-Kara age and brinjal with miso. Didn't manage to try their sake this time round. Would definitely come again to try them!"
Great Food with Excellent Service,Great atmosphere and the menu was quite extensive. Ordered the 7 piece skewers of which the bacon asparagus skewer was especially enjoyable. Also ordered the chicken karaage and onigiri. Service was good and food arrived quickly.
Great food and excellent service!,Great tasting food with wide variety of items from sushi to skewers to don bowls! Had the Spicy Salmon Bowl and the spicy sauce packs a punch! The chicken karage was also juicy and crispy paired very well with the rice bowls! Staff was also very friendly and kind as they automatically refill our cups and check in with us on the quality of the food!
Lovely Izakaya in the Heart of the City,"Great place to socialize with colleagues after work. The restaurant is beautifully decorated like an authentic Japanese Izakaya. We had the 7pc Kushiyaki (assorted charcoal-grilled meats and vegetables on skewers), which had an enjoyable selection of skewers. The highlight was the pork belly skewers in my opinion. We also ordered the Chicken Karaage (Fried Chicken), which was substantially larger than usual. We ended the meal with Umeboshi (sour plum) and Mentaiko (spicy cod roe) Onigiri. The items we ordered were surprisingly filling, and definitely satisfying. Would come again to try more items from their extensive menu!"
Will come again!,Food was tasty and came quickly! Love the beef bowl - beef was tender and had a good fat-meat ratio. Atmosphere was great too - conducive for catch ups!
Shukuu Izakaya,"The place gets pretty crowded at dinner time but the ambience definitely shouts ‚ÄúIrasshaimase‚Äù. The Gyu Ponzu ($8) is definitely a delightful starter. The lightly-seared juicy beef slices paired with the citrusy sauce whet my appetite. The Tako wasabi ($6) may lack in appearance but not in flavour. This nicely marinated octopus is a must for wasabi-fans. The Negitoro mini don ($10) was not too bad. The tuna belly is definitely flavourful but the sushi rice was a bit wet today. Overall a fun dining experience. 4.0/5 bowls

Awesome Friendly staff,Had a awesome dinner. The staff were friendly and kind.. They allowed us to put the birthday cake in the afternoon while our booking was at night... Thank you.
Great place to chill with colleagues!,"Chanced upon this Izakaya near the Telok Ayer area after work and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food. The Mentaiko Rosti was super delicious ‚Äî creamy, crispy, soft and fluffy altogether! The Surume Squid Ink Batter is great too, it was tender and not chewy. I really enjoyed the vibe and the food, had a great time with my friends."
Amazing food,"Enjoyable night out at Shukuu Izakaya. Limited seating available so making a reservation would be good.

Tried their shukuu tamago nigiri, rosti mentai and negitoro don.

Highly recommend the rosti mentai. The potato strips goes really well with the mentai sauce which is not too overpowering. The negitoro don is very flavourful and taste good when everything is mixed. Ended the day with a glass of their premium sake. The sake menu is very extensive sp there's tons of choices."
Lively dinner atmosphere with a wide selection of food!,"good food and good vibes at this izakaya! reached for dinner close to 8pm on a Monday, and the place was buzzing with people! really large extensive menu that was a little overwhelming initially, but had finally decided on Ponzu Beef, Pork Don w Ginger & of course some Chef Selections skewers. portions weren‚Äôt too big but the flavour of the different dishes were great!! would come back next time"
Great ambience and good quality Japanese food,"Amazing decor was done up. Really enjoyed all the food ordered especially was quite surprised with the Gyu ponzu as it was a cold dish but the beef was thin and nicely sliced but should be paired with rice. The only thing was that the portion could be a bit bigger, especially for the rice bowls."
"Overall, a great dining experience","Great ambience, really cosy & comfortable sitting.
You will be spoilt for choice with their wide array of cuisines available.
Ordered the Edamame, Crab Gratin w Mentaiko & Buta Shogayaki(Pork Slices in Ginger Sauce.
The edamame is well seasoned, crunchy.
The Crab Gratin w Mentaiko was absolutely superb, 100% recommended.
Soft, Creamy, Savoury
Delicious!
The Buta Shogayaki was full of flavour & very finely cut, easy to eat.
Ended the day with a Premium Sake, not really an alcohol person though, but it was sweet.
Overall, cosy ambience, spot on service & delectable cuisines."
Good Atmosphere,"Enjoyed the dining experience at ShuKuu Japanese Izakaya! Food choices are plenty, and their ambience is lively as well. Tried the rosti mentai and iwashi mentai which both come with an abundance of mentai sauce. The rosti is fried to perfection coated with the mentai sauce that embedded a harmony of sweet and sour taste. The sweetness for the tamago nigiri is just nice as well. Will definitely recommend 10/10!"
Dining Experience at ShuKuu Izakaya & Sake Bar,"Interesting experience at ShuKuu Japanese Izakaya with authentic japanese interior setting and there is a wide variety of food choices as well. Ordered their Pork Jowl which was recommended and it was really good. Also ordered the rosti mentai which i liked it alot as well, those who love rosti and mentai should order it :D

My friend and i also ordered the iwashi mentai which was a little on the fishy side. We also ordered the tamago nigiri and pork jowl nigiri which was not too bad. Overall it was an great dining experience and would certainly come back again to try their other dishes!"
"amazing food, wonderful service","Wonderful chill ambience, helpful and friendly staff serving such flavourful food! Following the recommended items and sakes, it was really a holistic experience to the menu and drinks they can provide. The portions for everything we ordered were just right! Started off with Torikawa Oroshu Ponzu, fresh, crispy chicken skin with a citrusy sauce. (would definitely eat this as a snack non-stop if i could) Rosti Mentai had such a good mentaiko sauce, and Kani Miso paste with crackers was really interesting to eat, with a flavour akin to prawn noodles! Hotate Sriracha was such a uplifting dish with bright flavours. Thick cuts of salmon sashimi, juicy Tochigi Wagyu A4 that is cooked to perfection, and sweet Tare Buta Bara (pork belly) were really great!

We were recommended the Grand Sampler Set of 3 for sake as we were new to sake, and tried both the standard dry and sweet sake, as well as a choice of premium sweet sake. Small portions that were great for tasting, and the standard dry felt the smoothest to drink, then the premium sweet then the standard sweet. Additionally, we tried the Adegashi Tofu after we drank, and it really provided a warm, comfortable dish to finish the meal.

Overall, food, ambience and service were perfect!! Definitely a place to bring friends, family and dates!"
Authentic Japanese Food,"Very nice ambiance, especially for catching up with friends or even with a date! The food was superb. My personal favourite was the Tochigi Wagyu A4 Beef. It was soft and tender it melts in your mouth!"
delicious 2 pax set with sake!,"ordered the 2 pax set and everything was so delicious! best part of the set was the sake which topped off the meal perfectly we also added their mentaiko rosti which was so surprisingly addictive we got a second portion. overall loved the ambience and food, would definitely be back again!"
Visit,"Good food and presentation by the team. Would recommend this place for its 2 pax set, affordable and delicious. üòÉ highly recommend the rosti!!"
"Cozy, great food and service!","Enjoyable experience with Shukuu~ Cozy environment with great food and service!

Would definitely recommend their creamy Kani gratin which tastes like the sea - superby tasty. I will come back for the Kani gratin! Negitoro don was well portioned though it can be more umami. Sake cooked oysters were flavourful.

Give their wide range of sake a try too! I ordered the sweet sake of the day - very smooth and fruity! The staff later told me that sake is from Aizubange, was a pleasant surprise to know that the sake came from one of my favourite places in Japan ((:

Service was overall great and food came really quick, recommend to everyone to come have a lil taste of Japan here at Shukuu!"
Amazing Pork Jowl Charshu,"The pork jowl charshu was really springy and tender. The fatty meat was slightly charred, giving a fragrant taste. The sauce, pickles and egg also compliments the meat very well.

Gyudon was nice as well. It had the right amount of sauce and is not overly sweet."
"Nice vibe, good food and sake","Had a very pleasant experience at ShuKuu Izakaya sake bar! It has a very comfortable and chill vibe suitable for hanging out with friends.

Ordered the Salmon Sashimi, beef stew with potato, gyu ponzu, fried shrimps and a sake sampler. Food was good and the sashimi was very fresh! The sake was refreshing and smooth and it was interesting trying the different sake with the sampler."
Great experience üòÑ,"A very pleasant environment that is suitable for casual chitchats among friends or even serious talks. Ordered river shrimps, beef stew with potatoes, salmon sashimi, gyu ponzu and the grand sampler set of 3 sake. Food is great, my favourite goes to the beef stew with potatoes and the sakes (dry sweet and premium) were amazing. Had a taste of the 3 and really loved it!"
"Cozy Izakaya, good for a post work dinner","Had a great night catching up with friends at Shukuu Izakaya. The charcoal grilled selections were well flavoured, smoky and juicy. Definitely get the meatballs! We found the Mackerel a bit too fishy for our tastes. Overall, it was a satisfying meal :)"
Enjoyable meal to get over Monday Blues,Had a lovely meal here to get over Monday blues with my boyfriend. Really enjoyed the Torikawa Oroshi Ponzu (aka fried chicken skin and the Chef's Selection charcoal skewers - really additive to munch on while chatting! The Rosti Mentai and Maguro Yukke were delightful to eat as well. Would come back again and enjoy some sake next time!
delicious authentic izakaya,super juicy breaded oysters and melt in your mouth beef!! rly a must have at this place! great place for a hangout with your friends and family! love it
Yummy Japanese dishes that did not disappoint! ‚ò∫Ô∏è,"Was really looking forward to visiting Shukuu and was not disappointed! The restaurant was only a short distance away from the MRT. We were seated immediately in a cozy corner of the restaurant. The menu had a wide selection and we ordered their Aburi Salmon Mentai and Maguro sushis, coupled with the chef's selection 5 PC charcoal skewers that went well with our drinks. The highlight of the meal was the wagyu beef skewer, which melted in my mouth with every bite! Overall, a great dining experience and would revisit again!"
Lively atmosphere and good food!,"Was very excited to eat here and it definitely did not disappoint! Had a very nice ambience and lively atmosphere during our dining experience there, which I enjoyed thoroughly. What was even better was the food, as we tried the rosti mentai as well as the aburi salmon mentai and maguro sushi for starters. It set the tone for the night, which was to be greeted with even more amazing food. Tried the 6pc oden and the chef's selection kushiyaki (5pc) as well, it was flavourful and satisfying. Would look forward to coming back here soon!"
Delicious Food,"Food was really delicious. Ordered torched mackerel and gyu ponzu. Both dishes had interesting, chewy textures - the gyu ponzu also came with crunchy roe that popped in your mouth and they were extremely flavorful as well. We also got the parmesan chips, and the salty cheese complemented the sweet honey and cherry tomatoes really well. Those 3 dishes paired well with the sweet sake. We ordered agedashi tofu and hot soba too, both of which were warm and comforting, perfect to end the meal with. The ambience was also very cozy and the staff were helpful!"
Chill Izakaya with nice skewers,"Atmosphere is chill and not too noisy for izakaya. We had the skewers to share - particularly love the chicken meatball skewers! I also had the minced tuna don, which was nice and filling. Overall a good hangout place if you're in the area!"
Cool Izakaya with great food,"Visited Shukuu Izakaya for dinner with my girlfriend and we had an enjoyable meal. Highlights of our meal were the Maguro Yukke, Torikawa Oroshi Ponzu and Rosti Mentai, and all the food was delicious and fresh. The decorations and seating added to the Izakaya ambience, which definitely contributed to our experience. Would visit again!"
Great Izakaya experience with quality food & drinks,"Shukuu Izakaya & Sake Bar is well-known for sake newcomers and lovers of all-things Japanese; I can definitely see why after dining there!

Love the interior decor and ambiance of the place as it really does remind us of Izakaya bars peppered around the streets in Japan. Food-wise, every dish was well-seasoned and marinated (esp. the Gyu Ponzu). Could tell every ingredient was fresh and cooked with well-balanced flavours.

As for the sake, the staff gave us a detailed overview of different sakes that we could try and asked us what were our preferences so he could recommend which sake would be better for us. We decided to go ahead with the sweet sake, which paired very well with the dishes we ordered.

This is a must-go place for friends to catch up over light bites and drinks, or if you wanna try an authentic Izakaya experience!"
Cozy ambience with quality Japanese dishes,Really great food and ambience here! Had the Aburi Shimesaba and Gyu Ponzu which were perfectly seasoned and paired with the sweet sake. We also ordered the Agedashi tofu and hot soba which went really well to balance the other dishes. Really appreciated the service being prompt and helpful. Will definitely recommend coming to ShuKuu Izakaya for a cozy night out with friends!
Great Japanese Food for a Date Night at Shukuu Izakaya!,"Tried the 2px experience platter because we didn't know what to order and it did not disappoint! Included in the set are 6 different dishes [Agedashi Tofu, Lightly Seared Fillet Beef, Torched Vinegared Mackerel, Salt & Butter Oysters, Garlic Soy Fried Chicken, and Assorted Skewers (Chicken + Pork)] and a 180ml sake of the week

Special mentions for the mackerel which was grilled and seasoned well (very umami), and the sweet sake, which had a fruity taste and was served in a beautiful sakura-designed glass jug accompanied with 2 sake cups, each with a cute koi design inside!

To complement the 2px platter, we tried other dishes as well. We ordered the Pork Shabu Don, Aburi Salmon Mentai Nigiri and Scallop Gunkan. The nigiri and gunkan were affordable and freshly prepared, not to mention tasty so they go well with the sake! The pork shabu don was a complete solo meal on its own too, with the pork shabu being soft and chewy, going well with the don. I recommend ordering rice when geting the platter to complement the flavours of the different dishes.

Besides the great food, the deco of the restaurant also creates a relaxed ambience, perfect for meals with your partners, family and friends!"
Quality meal,"Very yummy food. Wagyu beef was tender, sashimi slices were thick and generous. The fried Oysters were really worth it too!"
Not too bad,"Went there with friends and was recommended a couple of dishes like the iberico pork jowl and salmon bowl, etc. The iberico pork jowl was really damn good but the salmon bowl was a little bit underwhelming. Nonetheless, we had a good time there :)"
Dinner at shukuu izakaya!,"The ambience is great! This izakaya gives a warmly and homely feel that brings out an authentic japanese vibe. The food was tasty, especially the yakitori sticks. It is perfectly roasted, crispy and fragrant, really good ato go with a cup of ice cold beer."
As good as an izakaya gets,"Have heard of this place since awhile ago but never tried it till now. So glad I did, because it's a really nice izakaya with cosy and chill vibes. Enjoyed the food very much, especially the skewers and oden. Service was great too! Affordable beers too. Will be back for sure!"
Date Night,"My visit to Shukuu Izakaya did not disappoint. The place had really good business and was bustling with diners at my time of visit. It gave off a really ‚ÄúJapanese‚Äù vibe with its decorations and in-store furniture placings. As much as I would prefer a quieter dining experience, the vibe and environment there was rather pleasant as well. I ordered a spicy salmon don, along with crispy chicken skin to share with my partner and I got to say that the salmon they prepared had a really good texture, and the texture and taste of the rice complemented the meat well. The crispy chicken skin was rather exotic and the sauce that came along with it really satisfied our tastebuds. Really loved the food and the pricing of the menu was reasonable too!"
"Great experience, good food selection and sakes (in various ml)","Love the dishes are tasting portions which all went well with sake.

Esp love the gyu tongue; good bite to it and juicy, not overdone. And also the maguro yukke which was served with raw quail egg.

Their selection of sakes was impressive and love that they have options of 180ml for house pour sake.

Tried a dry and also a sweet 180ml sake house pours which were complementing to the dishes. Thanks to the staff who had great sake recommendation.

Great experience! Good service though the place was very packed on a Tuesday day. Probably good to reserve a table."
Cosy Izakaya and Nice Staff!,"Never been here before but glad I did! It was crowded even on a Monday evening so that says alot already. Their oden was really enjoyable ‚Äì paired with skewers it was a real treat. Together with the beer, it sure made my day!"
Good Vibes and better food.,"Upon arriving at the entrance of the restaurant, I expected a quiet dining experience. But, there was a whole other room packed full of customers. I was surprised as it was so quiet outside. The vibes were very fun and relaxing, it was good as I went there after work."
Lovely and Authentic Japanese Izakaya Food,"This was my very first izakaya experience and I was highly satisfied! There were 2 of us and we ordered the Tori Kara-age, Mentai Rosti, Buta Minced Katsu, a 5-piece Chef‚Äôs Selection of kushiyaki skewers and a Shirasu Don to end the meal with. Here are takes of some of my favourite dishes:

The Tori Kara-age might have been one of the best karaages that I have eaten, and I still crave for it from time to time! I loved how they added a hint of cheese to make the chicken taste more creamier, so juicy and terrific!

The Chef‚Äôs Selection of skewers include lightly-salted mushrooms, asparagus wrapped in bacon strips, chicken wings, chicken thigh and tsukune (chicken meatball). Sadly, the salted mushrooms were not pictured here as we were too excited to try them out before it gets cold Would like to highlight the mushrooms and wings as they both exceeded my expectations despite them sounding just like normal dishes!

Being a huge fan of both mentaiko and rosti, the Mentai Rosti was what made me so excited to give this place a try since this dish was pretty highly-raved online. The rosti was drizzled with the right amount of mentaiko sauce, and the portion was just nice for 2 pax to share. I would say that the rosti is not really swiss-style like they mentioned since you could easily pick up the potato shreds with your chopsticks, but nonetheless it still tasted great and we had savoured it all! (we even wanted to order another serving hehe)

The place was pretty crowded even on a Monday night and it was pretty noisy due to that, but I applaud the staff for being very proactive despite the many tables that they have to serve!

Overall I would highly recommend this place for those that are in the area looking for a place to catch up with friends as the food is good for sharing! 10/10 :)"
Great place for a night out with friends,"It‚Äôs been 2 years since I last travelled to Japan so I‚Äôve really been missing the izakaya I visited there. Shukuu Izakaya provides a dining experience reminiscent of that in Japan, with great ambience and decor, and an extensive menu featuring a wide selection of affordable food that pairs well with sake.

I went with a friend for a weekday dinner and we ordered several dishes to try. The food was served very quickly and portions were substantial. The torikawa oroshi ponzu ($8) was very crispy, and the ponzu sauce adds citrusy notes to the dish which balances out the heaviness of fried food. The yaki gyu tan ($14) is perfect for beef lovers, with more chew and flavour than the usual cuts of beef, and goes well with drinks. I‚Äôve been trying to find inaniwa udon in Singapore, so was delighted to find that they serve it here. The udon ($14) is smooth and the dashi (possibly the same broth for their oden?) is sweet, making an overall light dish that‚Äôs great to end the meal with, but I would have preferred the noodles to have a bit more bite to them. You can also choose to have it served cold. My favourite dishes were the ika ‚Äòkuro‚Äô-age ($12) and the kani gratin ($8). The ika ‚Äòkuro‚Äô-age was novel as I‚Äôve never seen anything like this before, and after trying it I can see why it is one of their recommended items. The squid ink batter is savoury and the dish is served with big pieces of squid, which were very fresh. The kani gratin was creamy and had a generous amount of mentaiko on top, yet I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn‚Äôt overly rich since gratin tend to be quite heavy sometimes, so I could finish the whole dish without getting tired of it at all. My friend loved this dish as well.

I highly recommend getting a glass of sake to go with the food. You can choose between sweet and dry, and standard ($7) or premium ($9). I got a standard glass of sweet sake, and it was very sweet and smooth, making it easy to drink even for people like me who don‚Äôt drink much. It‚Äôs only my second or third time drinking sake but I would definitely order it again. For those who are not very interested in sake, they also have a wide range of other drinks including umeshu, nama beer, chu-hi and shochu.

Overall, while I think it may not yet quite be on the same level as the izakaya I visited in Japan, the experience is largely similar and possibly one of the best of what you can get in Singapore at a very affordable pricing. I would recommend Shukuu Izakaya to those who are looking for a more authentic izakaya experience locally, or just anyone who‚Äôs finding a cozy hangout to catch up with friends over drinks!"
Cozy Atmosphere w great food!,"Highly recommend the Pork Jowl Charshu. The layer of fat in the meat, paired with the fragrance of the egg yolk truly elevated the entire dish. The chicken skin with ponzu sauce is great with their sake; but try to eat it asap to maintain the crunch! Food service was brisk and the staff were very approachable."
Pretty good experience,"Upon entering the store, the staff greeted us warmly. The wine tastes really refreshing and good. Ordered the mentaiko crab gratin and i guess that's one of the best thing we've ordered for the day. Very flavourful."
Great place to wind down...,"Wine: Two shots of Ê¢ÖÈÖí (1999 & Yuzu) & one shot of Â∑ùËæ∫
Food: Kani Gratin, Rosti Mentai & two Nigiris (Sweet Egg & Aburi Salmon Mentai)

Wasn't disappointed at all. Their mentaiko was amazing. It packs so much flavour that will leave you wanting for more. The Rosti Mentai was an additional order after trying out their Mentaiko sauce. It was THAT good.

Highly recommend the Crab Kani Gratin. Texture is soft and savoury. Even the appearance alone is enough to make you want to dive in and grab that first bite.

Staff was friendly and the atmosphere is suitable for you to wind down after a day's work.

Cheery night with great food,"I really liked the upbeat atmosphere that greeted me when I entered. The boisterous crowd and cheery decor made me feel right at home. The food was served swiftly once my friend and I finally made up our minds about what to order (the menu is really extensive!). From skewers to fish cake, there was nothing I ordered that night that I didn't enjoy. Special shoutout to the hot soba and karaage, they were the highlights of the meal for me. The soup of the hot soba made it a perfect complement for the heavier tasting items that night while the karaage was perfectly fried and came in a generous portion."
Great skewers!,"Food was great, especially the skewers! The smokiness and taste was so good. I would definitely go back for the skewers! Honorable mentions are the grilled squid and crab cake. The food were prepared well and the waiters were all very nice."
Great for casual meetups!,"Shukuu Izakaya was great! I tried their Japanese Fish Cake, Chicken Skewer and Spicy Salmon Don and they were all really good. The Fish Cake really stood out for me, it was slightly sweet and really aromatic and delicious. The service was good too, and the staff was friendly and accommodating. Overall a really solid experience, and I‚Äôll definitely revisit soon!"
Good food with cosy atmosphere,The sake was clean-tasting and pretty sweet which makes it feel really smooth! Food was good and there was a great variety to choose from. The Buta Shogayaki Don was very fragrant and goes well with the jap rice. The Gyu Ponzu was flavourful and I highly recommend having it with sake. The atmosphere is cosy and perfect for dates. Highly recommended !!
Highly recommended place,"Comfortable ambience, amazing for hearty catch ups. Food is great and at a good price point! Very friendly staff as well. We ordered mentai rosti,
skewers (pork belly, tochigu wagyu and bacon scallop), gyu ponzu (must get!!!), buta shogayaki don and sake sampler set of 3.

Definitely recommend and will return for subsequent visits to try more items on the menu :)"
Awesome charcoal grill skewers and sweet sake,"Great casual place for sake and Japanese charcoal grill skewers. Especially liked the bacon scallop one! Aburi salmon sushi was good too Went on a weekday night and it was bustling, seems like a popular place for after-work drinks! Service staff were friendly as well, would recommend visiting."
Great Jap Izakaya with Exceptional Service,"First time having izakaya and all the dishes we ordered exceeded our expectations.

We ordered the agedashi tofu, gyu ponzu, ika shiokara, tori karaage as well as an assortment of their skewers. The gyu ponzu is a must try. Even though we did not expect it to be a cold dish, we were nonetheless extremely impressed with the taste. The beef was tender and the fish roe gave the beef extra texture when mixed in. The ponzu sauce added some tanginess which made the dish very refreshing.

The skewers and karaage were all freshly grilled/fried and was pipping hot when served. Would like to especially recommend the beef skewers as it is tender, flavorful and had a slight charred taste.

Very cozy place with great ambience, ideal for hanging out with friends after work. Especially loved the decor and the epoxy resin inlay table. The staff there were also very enthusiastic and friendly, always making sure our tea cups were never empty.

In general a great place with a good variety of food options. Would highly recommend it! :)"
Delightful Jap resto!,"Great food combined with a great ambience creates a restaurant that is not only amazing for dates but also for families to visit. The food was extremely affordable for the quality that was provided such as the salmon moriawase and sashimi. Not only that, the restaurant infuses traditional Japanese tastes with a touch of modern brilliance. Items like the ordered parmesan chips were surprising (in a good way) in taste and left me wanting for more.

Other than the great food and the lovely ambience, the staff were also friendly and helpful. They accommodated every request! This restaurant is definitely one of the best Japanese restaurants I have been to in Singapore and moreover, it doesn't burn a hole in my pocket. I would really return again!"
Amazing Japanese restaurant with a fusion of modern tastes,"One of the best restaurants to go to for your quick fix of sashimi. The sashimi is fresh and extremely affordable!

There are various items on the menu that is fresh for a more traditional form of Japanese restaurant such as the Parsmesan chips which tastes absolutely fantastic.

The other food items are also really well prepared such as the spicy salmon don and Iberico pork. Another really underrated part of the restaurant is the service! Staff were really friendly and often assisted with our numerous requests. Would definitely return again!

Chill catch up,"The food there taste great, probably a 4/5 overall.

I ordered:
- Chicken Thigh skewer (Momo, Tare)
- Black Pork Collar skewer (Kurobuta Tontoro)
- A mini-don, Pork Slices in Ginger Sauce (Buta Shogayaki)
- 3pcs scallop with mentaiko sauce
- A glass of Sapporo beer

The skewers taste okay but they might have been kinda salty for me.

For the mini-don I had, visually it didn't look like a don, more of a bowl of rice and a separate bowl of pork slice as a side. Personally I think it would have been better to have the pork slice placed directly on top of the rice in one bowl so that the pork slice would not be dipped in the sauce the entire time, making the overall dish less salty.

The scallops has a nice smoky taste to it on top of the mentaiko sauce. But the taste of mentaiko was almost close to overpowering the taste of the scallops.

What I noticed is that when the menu was provided, the 2 menu doesn't match, one menu had almost the full menu which includes food items that are not shown on their online menu. While the other menu seem to be missing some pages of the menu. So it would be good if they can try to provide a fully updated menu. In case a customer may patronise the izakaya alone and missed out some food items they might want to try but is not shown to them on the menu."
Japanese Casual Dining,"Great place if you are craving Japanese food. The staff was friendly, prompt to respond when you needed help. The atmosphere was good quiet, and peaceful though I went there around the peak period on a weekday. I love the design on the menu. It was really nice. Perhaps adding a little more information about any other ingredients would have been great. I ordered the Gyu don, and the beef was mixed with ginger. The beef is good, but I didn't really like the ginger. The don was very filling for me. The skewers were good, just right the heat. The pork one was my favourite. Pairing the set with beer ends the meal very well."
Great Japanese fare,A go-to venue for a unique variety of quality Japanese food coupled with great service. Highly recommend to anyone who‚Äôs looking for an enjoyable dining experience!
