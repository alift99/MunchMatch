"As Always, Amazing","I've already wrote a review on Google a few months back. Today is my third time dining at Kucina with my partner. As always, food and service rendered were exceptional. But what stood out to me the most was how welcoming and down to earth the service staff were.

My partner had wanted to surprise me for our second anniversary but was quiet about it. When we wanted to leave the restaurant as it was near to the end of their operating hours, at about 9:50pm, my partner had somehow communicated to one of the service staff with regards to the Dolce Di Giorno (which was our favourite dessert) and to my surprise, it came with a Happy Anniversary lettering on the platter!

As it was almost 10pm, I did not expect for the service staff to be so accommodating and in fact, he even offered for us to stay behind to enjoy the dessert!

Thank you so much to everyone - from the front of house to the back of house team for this lovely dining experience. I am beyond grateful for this.

Lot of love,
Zarhidah"
So blah,"Went there for lunch. Service from the start was blah. No smile, no warm greeting ... first blah. Wait staff were not attentive to the tables and customers while they were 'busy' doing their work. I tried to be friendly when the order was taken but the reciprocation was blah ... second blah. Then I asked, 'what is good on the menu?' and the response was 'everything is good.' So blah. Eventually, I ordered the lamb shank which turned out good al beit a little small.

I would not go back there again just because it was ... so blah."
Pleasantly surprised with the service and quality,"Visited the restaurant twice, one of the best Italian food we have had in the recent past. Staff were courteous- special mention to Julius who went beyond the call of duty and displayed the dessert near our table when the kids had a hard time selecting one from them. Please keep up the great work!!!"
Terrible Customer Service and Charging Policy,"Dreadful customer service. Can only guess the staff have received absolutely no training. Was asked if we wanted water when we arrived which I then asked if it was tap water. The waiter said yes but didn’t tell me it had to be paid for. When it arrived I asked if we have to pay for the water since it arrived in a bottle. The waiter said yes to which I replied okay then we’ll eat elsewhere. The waiter then barked at us to put out masks back on! Really??! Is that the sort of customer service that encourages customers to return?
We were about to spend over $100 on food and drinks! How short sighted this policy is of making customers pay for tap water. In the very few restaurants I have been to around the world I will never pay for tap water. Actually that only usually happens in Singapore. I have no problem on paying for bottled water if I’m in a country where the tap water isn’t safe, but not in SG where. So in the end the money grabbing restaurant with poor customer service missed out on a nice piece of business. The Italian just around the corner did not have such a policy and the staff were very customer oriented."
Second to none experience,"I had an awesome dining experience at the restaurant recently. The booking system was seemless and I've received a confirmation call from the restaurant just a few minutes after reserving a table. The meals were wonderful and tasty. The restaurant manager, Ms Priya, was very knowledgable and patience in addressing our queries and her recommendations on the dishes were spot on. I have been coming to this restaurant a few times and the experiences were all great so far. Will definitely come here again. Thanks a million Kucina!!"
Great meal n service,"Decided to have lunch here due to recommendations by friends. Had fried fried seafood ( fritto misto) and side of bread for starters. Very Lightly battered seafood while bread tasted fresh.

Mains were cioppino, linguine alle cozze, pizza caponata.
Cioppino was tastiest of the three. Recommended. Good as a solo or shared dish. Every table should order this crowd pleaser. Authentic Italian taste. The pasta was good. Good amount of mussels but the dish lacked that” kick “. Wish it had more garlic. The caponata pizza was good but tasted better when dipped in the cioppino . Chose this pizza as I like pine nuts and ricotta cheese.. like, almost pesto but with a twist.

The frontliners especially the lady with the jacket, Priya, was excellent. Simply put, professional. Came across as genuine and sincere. Took care of minor shortcomings quickly. E.g, We were not given an extra bowl for shells in our seafood dishes so she replaced our small plates in a timely manner.

Overall - Had a great time and would dine here again.
5 stars."
Dessert is AMAZING!,"I have to say that I am impress by the quality and level of service at Kucina (Halal Italian peeps!!).
Tuck away in the corner of KINEX Mall it was worth the trip.
Every food served to our table was licked down to the very last drop. The array of dessert offered was mesmerizing. I had the salted caramel and tiramisu which clearly blows my mind. Subtle to the palate of once tongue.
Feeling greedy, I ordered the Olive Oil Chocolate Cake to take home and share with the fam, it didnt last long before it was over. That clearly says it all!
Thanks to the manager in-charge Priya, amazing knowledge and she brings back the level of service that I have missed in this industry.
Thanks to the Pastry Chef, tucked in a little corner of his owe, I did not manage to find out your name, but you will be hearing from a wholesome of peeps including myself for more of your awesome dessert."
Kucina Kucinta!,"I would like to share with everyone how much My Family and I love this restaurant.
By far, the best Halal certified Italian restaurant!

We always have the Fritto Misto for starters, their Chicken fingers are scrumptious! All their Pasta are good and our favourite are, Tartufo (Tagliatelle), Formaggi (Gnocchi) and Squid Ink Risotto. Savour each mouthful! I love the hearty flavours of the Truffle, rich and creamy.
I love desserts but I just prefer something not too sweet. I love their Panna cotta, Cannoli and Affogatto.

Warm lightings with cosy ambience and good-natured Team!"
homely hearty Italian with excellent service,"The service stood out first at this casual-looking joint, then the playfully written menu. It was a joy to browse and be introduced to the various dishes, some of which we'd barely seen around locally. As a pasta lover but far from a connoisseur, I especially appreciated the wide range of pasta types available, complete with recommendations of what might go best with each dish.

We shared the Pescatora with Squid Ink Chitarra, La Barca Funghi e Tartufo, Arancini Siciliani (not pictured) and tiramisu (also not pictured). As a big fan of squid ink pasta, I thoroughly enjoyed the umami taste of the sea that many other local renditions lack. My boyfriend enjoyed the la barca (boat-shaped pizza) more with its creaminess that I found slightly heavy, but we agreed that the bread was a welcome fluffy and doughy accompaniment. The crispy arancini, a rare dish locally, was rich in tomato and herb flavour - I'm glad I was able to introduce this to my boyfriend. Finally, as a coffee lover, the tiramisu was a decadent, fluffy and aromatic end to my meal.

My only gripe: for the premium price, the seafood in the pasta and the tiramisu serving could be more generous. We'll both be back to try more on the menu though!"
I'd be dancing with joy about how good the food was if I wasn't in public,"Quite possibly the best Italian Food I’ve had in a while. It was my first time in KINEX and of all the nearby restaurants and foodstalls packed into the basement floor, nothing else smelled quite as good or delivered on its obligation to provide quality food as this shop.

My partner and I had the Pescatora with squid ink chitarra and La Barca Funghi E Tartufo for mains. And dayum, did it leave an impression. The pasta sauce was so smooth and well incorporated with the pasta. And the pizza, the sauce to bread ratio was perfect, it was crispy outside while soft and fluffy inside.

While the dessert and appetizer offerings did not leave as strong of an impression as the mains, they were definitely solid contenders. The Arancini Siciliani was certainly a unique dish rarely seen elsewhere in Singapore. And the Tiramisu was a textbook example of a well-made dessert. Defo a place to return to once things go back to normal."
Appetizing Italian Food in Singapore,"I had the La Barca Funghi E Tartufo as the main. For this dish, the bombardment of different flavours and textures creates a new taste and textural experience upon every bite. From the strong nutty taste of the truffle, followed by the creamy and earthy taste of the creamy mushroom sauce to the crunchy then chewy texture of the bread, it felt exotic and ideal for a novel food treat. I really loved the effort taken to make the bread as a fish pond shape. I recommend this for avid truffle LOVERS!!

As for the dessert, I had the Pannacotta.
This dish is a refreshing rich creamy pudding dessert well topped with raspberry sauce. I recommend it as a simple creamy and sweet dessert. A must try for milk cream lovers!!"
Kucina Restaurant Food Review,"Dish Ordered: Arancini Siciliani(Appetizer)
Description from menu:
Breaded saffron rice balls stuffed with beef ragu, mozzarella & parmesan served with spicy sauce

The rice balls were really delicious and the different cheeses added were well combined to provide a slight spicy note at the end. I particularly loved how the crunchy textures from the crispy crust of the balls complemented the soft rice stuffings which allowed for an interesting intertwining of textures that melted in our mouths.
When I placed it in my mouth, there was an explosion of flavours from the cheese, salt and tangy and spicy sauce. In addition to that, the ASMR from the crispness of the crust was an added bonus in this dish. Would definitely recommend it.

Dish Ordered: Tartufo
Description from menu:
Mushroom cream sauce with black truffle pate & truffle oil
Chosen pasta: Tagliatelle

As someone personally not a big fan of creamy pasta, this pasta was just nice and scrumptious. The creaminess as the whole was light and complemented the mild truffle flavour. I personally liked the crumbs of cheese and crunchy mushroom which added more textual elements to the food. I chose the Tagliatelle pasta type and have no regrets as it was delicious and something new for me. Overall the ambience was chill and cosy, providing a great eating experience."
"Great Italian fare, warm ambience","Visited Kucina on a Monday afternoon and I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch. I had the La Barca Funghi E Tartufo - a pizza dish shaped like a Pide, topped with a cheesy, creamy, truffle mushroom filling. It was DELICIOUS. It is a very creamy dish so it would be great for sharing but honestly, I had most of it to myself and I didn’t find it too overwhelming. I would have loved a little more of the nicely charred mushrooms on top though! It lent the dish a nice earthiness to complement the richness of it all. We had the Pannacotta for dessert which was really good too. The raspberry and mango coulis was just tart enough to cut through the smooth creamy pudding. It was a really pleasant experience overall and I’ll definitely be back to try more dishes! The restaurant has a warm ambience and friendly staff. Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a chill, fuss-free but delicious Italian meal."
Cozy Italian Lunch!,"1) Bistecca: Black Angus Ribeye with baby carrots and potatoes in black pepper sauce

I had this in medium rare, and it was really not bad! The presentation was nice, BBQ sauce paired with the meat perfectly. Funnily enough I loved the potatoes and carrots and wished they gave me in greater portions. Would recommend one to share it instead though bc it’s quite a large serving and I couldn’t finish it :(

2) La Barca Funghi E Tartufo:
Creamy mushroom sauce with black truffle pate mozzarella and smoked scamorza drizzled with truffle oil

This was really good! Done perfectly and wasn’t burnt at all. The creaminess of the mushroom sauce wasn’t too overpowering for someone who can’t take carbonara, and the dough was done perfectly - not too soft. Paired with the mushroom and cream, it was really good. This may get a little gelat at the end, so would be good if you could share both the steak and this! Pretty addictive I found my fork reaching for more.

3) Panna Cotta: Drizzed with fruit drizzles with a hint of passion fruit.

After the heaviness of the two mains, I found this quite the perfect pairing. It looks smooth and bouncy, light on the palette especially with the fruity sauces decorating the plate. It vanished with a few mouths.

Side note:
Staff is super friendly and nice, feel free to ask anything. You need to pay for water! It’s 50cents per cup. They also have a wide array of drinks available that looked promising. The place itself is a cozy restaurant in KINEX, quiet and comfortable. Good for catch ups, especially on a weekday lunch."
Authentic Italian Place with Great Atmosphere,"Had the squid ink chitarra and gamberi linguine as our main dishes, and smoked salmon bruschetta as appetizer. The pasta was al dente - I loved the texture and how the sauces were nicely soaked into the pasta. The seafood was very fresh and just the right proportion (I especially loved the prawns in the gamberi linguine). The smoked salmon bruschetta was also a great kickstarter to the night as the salmon was fresh and went very well with the crunchiness of the bruschetta! :)"
A cozy italian restaurant,A cozy italian restaurant located at the basement of KINEX mall. Waiters were friendly and the service was fast. Ordered the squid ink chitarra to share over dinner. Portions were generous and food was delicious!
Wide Italian variety,"I got the Tortellini Di Manzo after being showered with so many different pasta choice possibilities! The variety here is so extensive and seeing that not many places in Singapore can do tortellini justice I gave it a shot. OOMPH it blew me away with how the creaminess of the sauce gelled together so well with the texture of the tortellini. For tortellini, the pasta skin shouldn’t be too chewy, and this had an al dente texture somewhat reminding me of a Chinese wonton, but having an added depth when you bite into it. Loved the meat that was within as well!
It had me wanting seconds :( loved this place and how Theres just so much to choose from! It’s hidden in a quaint corner as well so really like the atmosphere :)"
Cozy Italian Spot,"Tried the al granchio squid ink chitarra! Firstly, the variety available here in Kucina blew me away. It really had a taste of Italy because you can choose from egg chitarra, squid ink chitarra, gnocchi, tagliatelle, the list goes on! Was so spoilt for choice but eventually settled for the squid ink chitarra which definitely did not disappoint. It was doused in a bed of tomato sauce and loads of chunky crab meats inside. I loved how the texture of the squid ink chitarra gave an extra bite and oomph. I also tried the creme brûlée, it had a nice crusty exterior at the top! Had a nice cosy atmosphere too :)"
Halal Italian Restaurant,"I really love how they're halal certified, giving Muslims the chance to taste their yummy food. The staffs were very friendly as I saw them strike up conversations with the diners there.

My boyfriend and I shared 3 different dishes - the platter, La Fungi Pizza and tortellini. It was really truffle overload as everything was doused in it. I really love truffle so there was no issue there at all. I really like how generous they were with the truffle as well.

For the food, the platter were surprisingly good and we really enjoyed everything that was served. There were a perfect combination of finger bites, cold pasta, ham, pepperoni, cheese, olives and pickles. The platter was meant for sharing and is honestly perfect for 2-3 person.

The tortellini serving was rather small, which I was quite sad about because we waited half an hour for it and was really looking forward for it. Meanwhile. The La Fungi pizza was very huge and we couldn’t even finish it as a result. But my personal favourite is still the La Fungi Pizza as it really hit the spot."
"Gr8 food , ambience, awesome staffs.","Gr8 food, gr8 ambience but the thing that stands out were the fantastic staffs. My spouse n I were walking around looking for things during Ramadan n so we found this place. Jaz managed to get for us a seat even though they were fully packed. N we were attended to by Priya. She went thru practically recommending the best chef had to offer n delighted both my wife n I. I must say she recommended the best there is in Tanjong Katong.
Food came for our iftar n a Chinese gentlemen staff, we asked for tea n he recommended one that came with an add on of $2. I initially did not want the additional but my wife insist n so we agree. Boy did the guy made a gr8 recommendation. The tea pot allowed us to get 3 additional servings.
There was a nearly bad scene with a rude family that came claiming that your staff had lied. But both Priya n Jaz handle it perfectly. I was getting irritated with the couple but I guess they might have just came out of SHN after year being isolated or that they couldn’t fly to India due to the travel ban. All in Jaz n Priya handled well n we could carry on with our peaceful iftar.
The food was gr8 as well as ambience but it’s your staffs Priya, Jaz n the Bubbly Chinese gentlemen that took our experience to the next level.
We shall return ( minus the kids, coz they won’t know wat we are talking about.)
Kudos to your staff n team. Keep up the gr8 work y’all."
Delicious Italian Fare!,"Had the most lovely time with a friend at this quaint little restaurant. We had the Carnivora pizza, which was loaded with meat topped on a crisp crust. The real star of the show was the Tortellini Di Manzo - fresh pasta filled with turkey ham and beef, just divine! It's also great that it's a Muslim-owned restaurant - always nice to see more options around for Italian food. Looking forward to coming back!"
Cozy ambience & Great Pizzas!!,"Had the Carnivora as my main which had various meat such as turkey ham and bacon, chicken sausage, and beef salami along with mango juice.

They complimented each other well and they were pizza was especially generous with the portion of the pizza and it has to be one of the best I've had hands down!!
The Crust was done justt nice and the pizza was not too thick or thin too!

Definitely a great recommendation!"
Kucina Italian Restaurant,"Ordered the Kucina antipasto, canneloni di pollo and Carnivora pizza. They didn’t start preparing our mains until we were almost done with the antipasto, which I thought was great because it meant our mains were freshly made. Loved the variety and presentation for the antipasto, could tell that effort was put into making it look nice. The sauce for the canneloni di pollo was nice. The meat can be a lot and overpowering based on the other Carnivora pizzas I’ve had at other places, but the one I had at kucina was just right. Felt that there was a good balance between the meat and the sauce and cheese. Service was good too, our needs were attended to pretty quickly."
Hearty Italian,Went for an early weekday lunch and was probably the first few there. Clean and warm atmosphere and the service staff was great too. Our needs were attended to pretty quickly. Ordered a peach mint and a lychee blue lagoon drink and they were nice and refreshing. The Kucina antipasto had good presentation. Had the canneloni di pollo and Carnivora pizza for mains. The sauce for the canneloni di pollo was nice and the pizza had a good balance between the meat and cheese and sauce so it wasn’t too overpowering. Great experience.
Authentic Italian cuisine,"Visited Kucina for a weekday dinner, and the wait time was relatively short despite the decent crowd. Service was fantastic and food was good and reasonably priced, with large serving sizes. Definitely would revisit."
Great experience!,"I have to say, I enjoyed every single bite of the meal. I had a carbonara, paired with a medium done striploin steak. Although the carbonara sauce was slightly too salty for my liking, it was still really good! Price is rather reasonable as well. Service was great and the staff were pretty attentive to the customers in the restaurant :)"
Italian Fooood,"Had a dinner date on a Wednesday night, which explains the slightly longer serving time. The antipasto platter was very interesting, with different variety and ingredients to try out. Also ordered the La fungi pizza and really pleased by the quality of the bread - crispy crust but soft inner part. The tortellini tasted good but the portion was slightly smaller than what I expect. Overall quite a good experience there."
Hearty and Authentic Italian Fare,"Great Italian Fare, no frills and at reasonable prices. Was delighted to find out they only used freshly made pasta, and very much enjoyed the Al Granchio (squid ink pasta with crab meat cream sauce). Also would recommend the Cioppino - really tasty! Would say it'd be best to order plates to share. Staff was attentive too, great customer service and ambience, which added to a great overall experience.

Also, only found out about the restaurant being Halal-friendly after but that's definitely a bonus!"
Short trip to Kucina Italian Restaruant,"The food was really good! The appetiser platter was very delightful and filling, and the steak was cooked just about right. The baby carrots and potatoes that came with the steak complemented the main dish excellently. Service was also enjoyable, I love it when staff ask about whether we enjoyed the food and our time there. It makes the food end off on a really nice note!"
Authentic Halal Italian food with great service!,"We ordered the signature tortellini and crab meat squid ink pasta and were delighted to find out that the restaurant only serves fresh pasta! Both dishes tasted superb, but the tortellini portion was a bit on a smaller side for the price. Their tiramisu was soft and creamy, even though it doesn't contain alcohol. Overall we were very satisfied with the food and service!"
Kaleidoscope of flavors,"If you are a fan of adventure and surprises, then you must try the appetizer platter, Kucina Antipasto. The mozzarella was dripping with freshness, the bread toasted to a satisfying crisp, and the sauce was zesty and mouthwatering. It is a delight to the senses."
Great food!,"Greeted by friendly staffs that was helpful in reccomending the dishes. Had the pescatora and the tiramisu.
The pescatora was flavourful with a little kick from the chilli, the chunks of crab meat were fresh. The tiramisu was creamy, was a great pairing with the pescatora to end off the meal."
Authentic italian food worth trying!,"Kucina Italian serves Italian food that blew my mind! My friend and I came here after seeing some instagram stories and decided to order the chef recommended Antipasto platter and La Barca Funghi pizza. The antipasto platter was really large and very tasty – it was all bite sized eats which allowed us to taste many flavors, which I enjoyed a lot! I particularly liked the cheeses and cold cuts, which really gave me an appetite! The La Barca Funghi pizza was pretty incredible as well, and as a mushroom lover, it was very flavorful and cheesy. The bread had a really nice crust and the whole pizza really lives up to its chef’s recommendation.
10/10 would recommend"
Great Ambience! Good Service. Great Food! A Must Try!,"Kucina is located at Kinex Mall in Paya Lebar, a very convenient location.

I have ordered Branzino, I like this crispy skin sea bass fillet served with my favourite mushroom. The sea bass is very fresh, tender and tasty. This is a truly flavorful dish. Delicious! Must Try!

Aside from their great selection of Italian food including some interesting dishes such as the La Barca Funghi e Tartufo and their Kucina Antipasto, You will be treated by an impeccable customer service by their staff, very prompt and friendly. I love the cosy atmosphere of the restaurant too."
Seriously good Italian food at affordable prices!,"Popped by a dinner following the many recommendations by colleagues, and the servers were nice enough to accommodate our request for a nice spot to sit at.

We ordered the Kucina Antipasto as an appetizer and I really enjoyed the cold cuts with cheese, as well as the cold capellini with prawns and truffle. The dish itself looked and tasted and smelled really good, and we had no problems finishing it!

For the main course we chose to try the recommended La Barca Funghi E Tartufo pizza. The first thing that really catches your attention is that it is no simple pizza, but a thick, beautifully oven baked doughy pizza with an incredible mushroom sauce and black truffle pate. The generous amounts of mozzarella and smoked scamorza baked into the pizza was incredible. The mushroom pate was rich, thick and flavorful. I would highly recommend checking this pizza out.

The Italians are famous for having appetizers, a pasta (secondi) and a main, but we were so full! We will definitely be back to try more!"
"Incredible pizza, a must try!","You have to come here for some serious Italian food!

The gf and I came here for a good meal after a long day, and we were lucky we got here early because it got crowded fast! For starters, we ordered the Kucina Antipasto platter, and wow we should have brought friends because it was large! I particularly enjoyed the caprese salad and the cheeses, and washed it down with the mocktail of the day. I definitely enjoyed the nanduya spicy sauce, which we used liberally on the chicken fingers.

For our main course we decided to pick something special, and so we went for the La Barca Funghi E Tartufo pizza. It’s not like your simple pan pizzas, this one was a boat drenched in the most amazing smelling mushroom sauce and black truffle pate. When we cut into it, we could stretch the mozzarella and smoked scamorza (it was a generous amount and we were really pleased). The mushroom pate itself was the highlight, rich, decadent and so flavorful that I was lost for words and just focused on eating for the rest of the meal. The gf agreed that this was one of the best shes had.

We highly recommend checking this place out, it has decent prices for some really good Italian food and one should not miss out!"
Authentic Italian halal cuisine with great pasta and pizza,"Calamari came freshly deep-fried and was piping hot. The squid was perfectly done and not overcooked, resulting in them not feeling rubbery. I ordered a Tortellini Di Manzo as my main, where the creamy rich sauce couple with the freshly-made pasta resulted in a decadent experience. I also enjoyed the Margherita Di Bufala, where the pizza came fresh out of the oven and had perfect leoparding spots on the bottom of the pie. Not going to lie, but the pizza was the best pie I have eaten recently.

10/10 recommend you to come and try the pasta and pizzas."
Excellent gnocchi,"Ordered the calamari, salmone gnocchi and margherita pizza. All in all the food was great and the service was excellent. The gnocchi was made very well and I would definitely recommend getting gnocchi here. The pizza was done very well too."
Authentic Italian Flavours Highly Recommended,"Visited on the 22nd March. Very impressed with the Kucina Italian Restaurant overall. It is located very conveniently at KINEX. Food is really authentic and well flavoured. Tried the Margherita de Bufala, ingredients used was really fresh and the pizza perfectly baked! Highly recommended 👍👍👍"
Lovely Traditional Italian Food,Restaurant is located at convenient location near the Paya Lebar station. Pleasant and cosy dining experience. Was greeted by friendly staff and great service. Love the unique and warmly lit interior. The restaurant serves really nice Italian food. Highly recommend the ravioli which is simply flavourful with the spinach filings and rich tomato paste seasoning.
Great Italian Find in Paya Lebar,"The restaurant is located in a cozy corner of Kinex and was pretty crowded during lunch hour on a weekday. The staff were very attentive despite the crowd.

Got their best selling spinach ravioli and was impressed. I would also recommend giving their mock tails a try instead of the juices as they aren’t freshly squeezed.

Overall, a great experience with the cozy interior and tasty Italian food!"
Wide Variety of Italian Food + quaint little spot at an unassuming mall,"I had made a wrong reservation, but the staff attended to me promptly without much of a fuss. Service was prompt and attentive, and the food was a pleasant surprise. First off there is a wide selection of pastas - which put me in a difficult position cuz i love my pastas.

Then came the actual food - portion was surprisingly generous, and I was quite pleasantly full from it. Ordered the tortellini di manzo, and boy was the filling innit a delightful mix of turkey ham & beef.

Had also a dessert in the form of nutella calzone - and once again were they generous with the Nutella.

All in all a good meal, ambience was also pleasant as it was relatively quiet."
"Cosy, yet lively atmosphere, hearty food :)","My gf and I enjoyed dinner here. Cosy, dimly lit, and yet with a lively atmosphere, we enjoyed a generous, well seasoned Caprese salad with pesto drizzle, thin-crust Margherita and Kucina's signature Cioppino, seafood broth which I have to say was very moreish and overall my favourite. Hearty food indeed :) We would return."
Hearty and Delicious Seafood Soup!,"The seafood soup was hearty and delicious with a good variety of fish, shrimp, and mussels. You could taste the effort put in it! It was a satisfying meal paired well with crispy baked garlic bread. The service staff were very attentive. For the pricing, it’s very reasonable and I would definitely be back here (:"
Lots of delicious options,"Interesting menu with lots of options. Eventually settled on the tortellini di manzo. Service was great, food came fast. The tortellini texture was perfect and the filling was flavorful. There was effort put into the sauce too, which complemented the tortellini. Overall a great dish to try."
Lots of choices to choose,Lots of choices to choose in this restaurant. I placed a booking in advance and the process was seamless. Food comes in quite a large portion for the price you pay for. Will definitely recommend this to others looking for Italian food.
Good food and ambience,"Ordered the pizza, mushroom bread appetizer and squid ink pasta. Enjoyed the food and ambience, food portion is generous as well for the price, will recommend to come here and try!"
Great authentic Italian food,"Had the Tartufo gnocchi here and I have to say i really loved it! The mushroom cream sauce was very rich and indulgent, and the fragrance from the black truffle oil really comes through:) The gnocchi was very light and fluffy and traps the sauce very well with each bite. A reasonable portion for how it was priced, with prompt service. Would definitely patronize again!"
Linguine Prawn Aglio Olio,The restaurant was quite generous with its pasta and prawns portions!! Prawns was also very juicy and fresh!! The pasta was tasty and fragrant!! I really enjoyed the dish!!
A steak worth trying!!,"Tried the bistecca!! The steak was super tasty, savoury and most importantly juicy!! Really done to perfection!! Super value for money too at only $30!! The truffle butter was a v good addition too!!"
Gourmet Halal Italian,"This is still my go to for gourmet halal Italian food, especially pizza. Is there anyone else in Singapore at this level? I hope it’s only a glitch, but the toppings of the pizza seem a little reduced."
Simple and fuss-free halal italian food,"Simple and fuss-free halal italian food! Tried the salmon gnocchi and pizza, pasta sauce was flavourful and gnocchi was soft and pillowy. Pizza was great and tasted delicious. Great service and staff was very attentive and friendly!"
Will visit again! :D,Quaint Italian restaurant nestled in Kinex Mall. The food was awesome! Personal favourite was the Tortellini Di Manzo! Food portion was really great and ended off the meal with Tortino which capped off our meal perfectly. Def visit again!
Truffle Gnocchi!! <3,"Absolutely enjoyed my dinner at the cozy Kucina - had Caprese Salad, Tortino and Truffle Gnocchi! The Truffle Gnocchi was AMAZING - easily one of the best I've had in Singapore! Overall great experience!"
Great food and service!,"Great food and service! I really enjoyed the fritto misto (fried prawns, chicken, and calamari), it was very flavourful and a good starter to the main. The gnocchi salmone was quite heavy, so I would recommend getting a lighter side as a complement. I would definitely recommend Kucina for its authentic Italian food and nice ambience!"
Great food and excellent service,One of the best Italian places I've been to in Singapore. The la barca had a great truffle taste that wasn't overbearing and the cannoli was crunchy yet creamy and was very satisfying. The service there was excellent and the staff were friendly and attentive. Would pay them another visit again in the future!
"Lovely, cosy place with a wide variety of Italian food","This is a lovely, cosy place with a wide variety of Italian food! I came with my sister for lunch and we left, feeling so stuffed :)) The lasagna was super cheesy and the pizza delicious! I think it’s an ideal place for family meals or date night, especially since it’s located in an accessible spot."
Halal and Italian!,I usually avoid pizza crusts but trust me when I say that every inch of this pizza is lovely because it was baked in a wood burning oven that gave it a smokey taste and crisp texture. Did not enjoy the pasta quite as much but would definitely be back for tasty *halal* Italian food! The service was also great!
Great place for dinning,"The place was well located and easily accessible. At the restaurant, the service was top notch and have a cozy atmosphere. I love how my needs were attended to quickly and whenever.

The food there were delicious especially the pizza as it was very cheesy and filling for me!"
Great sauce paired with pasta,Great sauce that paired well with the tortellini! Would not mind trying the other pastas on the menu!
Italian Food,"Came here on a weekday for lunch with my friend, and ordered the gamberi gremolata, which surprised me because the sauce was thicker and less oily than expected of an aglio olio dish. Nonetheless, the pasta was delicious and the amount of prawn given was generous. I would recommend this dish for all who want to try a different type of aglio olio. We also ordered the bruschetta salmone as an appetizer and tiramisu as dessert. The bruschetta was too hard for my liking, but the tiramisu was good, and the portion size was very big. I would recommend the tiramisu for people who like sweet mousse and cream as the there was more mousse than biscuit in the tiramisu."
Can’t wait to go back,"Had their very unique truffle mushroom pizza which was wonderful. The crust was very tasty and well charred. The filling was nice and creamy, with interesting bits of the truffle pate. Can’t wait to try their other dishes as well!"
Great Italian Restaurant,I really enjoyed the food and service at Kucina. The Antipasto has a great variety of food for people to enjoy together. The pizzotto also have an interesting taste with the turkey bacon mushroom and egg! Would love to try out a few other menu items
Authentic Italian Food,Food and service at Kucina was great! Definitely recommend the Antipasto for sharing! Would love to come back and try other items on the menu!
Great Food,"The food was good and the service staff were very friendly and helpful! I ordered the tartufo tagliatelle, which is mushroom cream sauce with black truffle pate and truffle oil. The portions are really big so I think it’s quite worth!
I also shared the Bruschetta Salmone from the appetisers as well as a tiramisu from the dessert section with a friend. The salmon serving was very generous. The tiramisu was bigger than expected, and it would probably be too much for one person to finish the whole thing. So its good if you have a friend to share it with! The cream part was slightly too sweet for my liking, but the cake was still really good!"
Great place for dinner and a catch up!,"Ordered the Salmone, and the gnocchi was perfectly complemented by the tomato cream sauce. I also ordered the dessert platter, and it was great that we could try a variety of desserts without having to break the bank."
I had a great time at Kucina!,I had a great time at Kucina! Food was nice and service staff were very helpful and attentive! Would come back to try out more of their menu.
Great food!,"Food taste good! (Just that it's a little salty for the sauce) But I am so pleased to see that the crab meat they gave is not those cheap frozen crab meat that you brought from NTUC, they are fresh crab meat!"
Good time at kucina,"Good food, big portions and wide variety of pasta selection! 😋😋 We ordered way too much for a couple..."
"Great Food, At a Price",Overall experience at Kucina was okay! Service was prompt and staff were polite. There was good variety in terms of pasta choices and flavours but I decided on having the Branzino in the end. The fillet was fresh and tasty with the consistency of the mash being to my liking as well! The mash was slightly on the salty side for me personally but nothing deal-breaking. Overall I do feel like the restaurant has good food but does lean slightly on the expensive side!
Interesting Pasta,"Their pasta is pretty interesting!! You can choose from potato gnocchi, squid ink chitarra, egg tagliatelle and more! I tried the formaggi gnocchi, which is a type of pasta made different types of cheese in a cream based sauce. The gnocchi was soft with a delightful burst of cheese flavour. The sauce had the fragrance of herbs, lightly drizzled with olive oil. If you're a cheese lover and don't mind forking out about $30, this is worth a try!"
Salmon gnocchi,First time trying gnocchi and it was very enjoyable! It was a pretty filling meal and the cream has a slight sourness that I really liked. Would definitely recommend this!
Interesting Italian pasta,Rly recommend the salmon gnocchi as it had chunks of salmon aside from the salmon cream and the gnocchi was really chewy. The saffron rice balls were also deliciously cheesy with a hint of spicy chilli sauce. Good food and a chill ambience.
Halal Italian Restaurant,"It was a decent meal. We loved the calamari rings, which were very fresh and tender. The pasta was average, though we liked the tomato based squid ink one better as the carbonara was a little too eggy for our liking. And we ended off with the tiramisu which we loved. Especially loved that their sparkling water was so affordable! props to the restaurant for that!"
"Extensive menu, great food","Visited this restaurant with some friends over dinner few days back, and I really enjoyed the food. They had an extensive menu (I was spoilt for choice!), and the atmosphere of the restaurant was cosy, even had a open-kitchen concept.

Ordered some sides to share - we got ourselves the Kucina Antipasto and the taste was really unique. Personally loved the cold capellini with prawns, highly recommended for those who love truffle! Had myself a squid ink chitarra and my friends got a Kucina pizza. Everything was great, would go back again!"
Best Italian Food Experience,"Heard about this restaurant from a friend and I would say that the overall dining experience was great! Personally, I like their Kucina Antipasto especially the cold capellini with prawns and truffle. The taste of the truffle elevates the overall taste of the capellini."
Incredible flavours,"Heard about Kucina Italian Restaurant from a friend recently and was excited to give it a try after reading many positive reviews about it online.

The positive reviews were definitely well-deserved. I had the Chef's special Lobster Ravioli, and it was out of this world. The flavours were incredible and the serving was really generous. Definitely would come back again!"
Great Food + Service,"Had a quick lunch fix here at Kucina Italian, and I must say the food and service here really blew me away. The waiter was patient and gave us a really clear breakdown of the menu and the chef's specials for the day, it was a shame that I forgot to get his name.

I had the Lobster Bisque and Risotto de Mare for lunch. Something that I really enjoy that I feel is missing from many Singaporean restaurants are strong flavours. However, Kucina's food packed a strong flavour punch. The lobster bisque was incredibly flavorful, saturated with the taste of lobster, and was really appetising. Similarly, the risotto de mare was full of flavor, and came with large portions of seafood.

I really enjoyed my lunch here, and I'd definitely come back for more!"
Pretty much a hidden gem,"Quite a hidden gem tucked at the basement of KINEX. Great selection of Italian food including some interesting dishes such as the La Barca Funghi e Tartufo and their Kucina Antipasto. The price isn’t the cheapest but of course they made up with the generous portion.

Great pasta, good flavours, delicious pizza! Will definitely be back for more."
Great Food n Service,Food is authentically Italian in every way and not over priced unlike some wannabe Italian restaurants in town. Service is warmth n friendly. Definitely be back n highly recommend others.
Located at Kinex Mall in Paya,"Located at Kinex Mall in Paya Lebar, this halal Italian joint served up quality food that was big in portion as well. Came in a group of 4 and we ordered 1 antipasto, 2 pastas, and 1 pizza to share and we left feeling pretty satisfied! My favourite is the Mushroom Cheese Boat Pizza (La Barca Funghi E Tartufo) — the pizza dough was fresh and had a good bite, and the mushroom cheese was so flavourful. Will definitely come back just to eat this dish again!"
Good Halal Italian food,"Pretty good food than expected. Although price was on the expensive side, portion is generous. Ordered two pasta, a tartufo and an antipasto platter to share with friends, the tartufo surprisingly tasted good."
PIZZA WAS AMAZING!,"Excellent experience with its service and food! Especially the pizza which have crispy crust and tender in the middle, perfect pizza for the weather. The truffle fries was a bonus as the portion and flavour was amazing 👍🏻"
Awesome Italian Food,"The restaurant is located at Kinex, a mall that's pretty well equipped so the location is convenient with amenities abound at the place. The restaurant feels cosy and fuss-free. A good place for friends to gather and catchup- it is not too noisy too which is great fro conversations. Food wise, they i'm actually blown away by how well all the food tasted. We had the La Barca Funghi e Tartufo, a uniquely shaped pizza which tasted so good, one of the best i've tasted. Their cold cut platter was good as well and they will elevate it up for a better dining experience. Even their pastas are well cooked and taste excellent too. Thumbs up!"
GREAT ITALIAN FOOD,"Food was great, the salmon was quite thick and the tortellini di manzo was really creamy and appetising."
Halal Italian Restaurant,Nice place for a casual dinner with great selection of Italian dishes. Really enjoyed the bruschetta salmone starter and the vongole tagliatelle pasta. Would definitely come back to try other dishes! :)
Love the Canneloni Di Pollo!!!,"We ordered the Carnivora Pizza, Canneloni Di Pollo & Truffle Fries. The food taste really good & the restaurant is also easy to locate! Definitely recommend this restaurant and I highly recommend their Canneloni Di Pollo as I love how the sauce is cheesy but it doesn’t make me sick of the taste!"
Love the pizza!!,"Ordered the Margherita Pizza and Formaggi Gnocchi and of course we ended it off with a dessert, tiramisu! Food overall was great and location is convenient (near paya lebar mrt station). Other than that, it is also halal! Would totally recommend it!"
Best Pizza Ever,"Ordered the truffle fries, formaggi gnocchi and the margherita pizza. with a tiramisu to end the meal! The truffle fries were on the thicker side and was given with a generous amount of parmesan cheese! The gnocchi was really soft and not overly chewy which was amazing with the creamy sauce.
The pizza was one of the best i have eaten! The pizza was not only savoury but also has a nice crisp to it even though it is not a thin crust pizza. It was not overly doughy where it had the perfect ratio of dough and toppings. The crust at the end of the pizza was also amazing as it had a savoury flavour in the dough along with a crisp! The pizza however is quite huge but even after eating half of the pizza i wasnt sick of it!
The tiramisu was good as well as it was really sweet and creamy! The price is abit on the steeper side but is worth it! Overall an amazing place for italian food especially their pizza is a must order!"
Special Italian Dishes!,"Always walked past this place and wanted to try the food here. Finally did and it was pretty good! :) I got tortellini di manzo, and the meat in the pasta was very juicy and first few bites was amazing! We also got some nutella related dessert (cant remember its name) and it was delicious :-) (other desserts looks good as well and we had a hard time choosing) The service is great as well! One of them even pulled up an extra chair for us when she saw us carrying bags of stuff, thank you!"
Unique and Tasty!,"First time here at Kucina Italian, and it was really great! The service was really good, we were attended to quickly, and our food took — minutes to arrive, which felt just on time! I got the calamari for starters , tartufo as a main and butterscotch frappe. The tartufo was really savoury, and the calamari i got as a starter really complimented it. I’m glad I got the coffee, it was not too sweet and just a perfect portion! it was overall a very nice and cozy meal. Great place to go to for family, or even with friends ! :)"
Authentic Italian Pizza,"Recently had lunch at the timeless Kucina Italian Restaurant! Their menu catered to a wide variety of authentic Italian food, of which I tried one of the pizzas! Although the prices may be on the more expensive side, the portions are pretty big and generous -- I couldn't even finish the pizza completely even after sharing it among friends. The staff were also really polite and nice there. Overall, Kucina Italian restaurant is a cozy and authentic place to dine in!"
"Aromatic Truffle Fries, Fluffy Flavourful Pizza","I went to Kucina Italian Restaurant with a friend. I ordered their Best Seller Truffle Fries and Carnivora.

They served the fries within 7 minutes, and pizza within 15 minutes, which was prompt. The truffle fries were served hot and golden brown. A crunchy exterior and a light, fluffy interior.

I was pleasantly surprised by the aromatic, moderately salty, taste buds-punching truffle oil & pate, along with grated parmesan which gradually melts on the smoking hot fries. The toppings elevated the overall taste of the fries.

The Carnivora pizza, topped with chicken sausage, tomato, turkey ham, beef salami, turkey bacon, and mozzarella was evenly baked.

The cornicione was crunchy, and the rest of its crust was crispy outside and fluffy inside. The generous portion of cheese, turkey ham, and turkey bacon were delectable and savory. However, I wish that they would serve some fresh tomato slices on the pizza instead of only tomato paste.

Overall, the generous portions of aromatic, mouth-watering truffle fries and fluffy, flavourful pizza were well worth the price."
Italian Eats: Delicious Delights,"I got to know of Kucina online and went down for dinner with a friend. It was our first visit and we enjoyed ourselves immensely!

My friend and I ordered the Truffle Fries, Carnivora Video and Bolognese Gnocchi. The pizza was crispy, meaty and flavourful too. As a lasagna lover, I was slightly hesitant to try something new but I'm glad I did! The gnocchi was perfectly cooked, with a creamy middle that was scrumptious.

Shoutout to the tomato sauce: Light and tangy that made me hungrier with every bite.

And the fries were a perfect appetiser to start the meal. I always appreciate hot, crispy fires with the right amount of salt.

The service was also stellar - polite and lovely servers. The cosy yet refined atmosphere is perfect for a family celebration and business get-together."
Good food decent price,The food was splendid for a decent price! Had the classic carbonara and ended off on a nutella tiramisu! Splendid flavours that were powerful but yet not overwhelming. The Tiramisu was super thick and creamy would definitely come back again
Great service and nice ambience,"My friend and I ordered the magherita pizza and the carbonara spaghetti. Pizza was simple but nice; had a crispy crust too, yumm. For the carbonara, you can choose which pasta noodles you wanted and they had a few special choices apart from just spaghetti and linguine, though we went for the safe option. It was good too. Note that this is a halal italian restaurant, which is kinda rare in Singapore (at least to me), so this is somewhere I'd bring my muslim friends to, for future gatherings! The service was also good - polite and nice servers. Waiting time wasn't too long on a weekday evening as well."
"Intense, Mouthwatering!","I visited Kucina back in End-October on a date. Both of us agreed that the portion sizes were fantastic and we were pleasantly surprised by the dishes we ordered. The salmon gnocchi in particular was very flavourful and the gnocchi did not disappoint! However the lava cake was a bit of a let down as the top fell through and the cake was mildly cold. Staff were very receptive to feedback and I do hope the cake has improved since then! All in all, a very welcoming place for dinner."
Hearty Delicious Italian Cuisine,"When visiting an Italian restaurant for the first time, you just have to go with the classics. My choice — Pasta Carbonara! Kucina’s beautiful take on this iconic Italian dish was an absolute delight The wonderfully creamy Carbonara sauce was nicely complemented with some delicious sautéed beef pancetta.

I rounded off my meal with a refreshing mint chocolate latte for that special Christmas touch

Great food, friendly staff, cosy atmosphere! The perfect way to spend your evening"
Great food!,"Had a nice dinner at Kucina last week, ordered the tortellini di manzo and was really impressed with the mushroom cream sauce that I finished every drop! Service was great and ambience perfect for a nice and casual dinner."
Great service and delicious food!,"Had a lovely time with my +1 here. We had the Antipasti platter, which was pretty impressive! They were really generous with the portions and had a variety of items on the platter. Would highly recommend if you're looking out for halal certified Italian food!"
