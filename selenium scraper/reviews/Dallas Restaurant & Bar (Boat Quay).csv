Dallas boat quay,Great food and great drinks. Jobel is the best very attentive five servive and very friendly I always go back here because if the service
Ladies of Boat Quay,Awesome service!! Friendly atmosphere that makes drinking and eating enjoyable. Best personal attention in Boat Wuay for locals and visitors.
"Staffs were my favourite part ;) it the whole part of my many Dallas Boat Quay visits, of course food is üëç","Staffs were my favourite part ;) always the best part of our many Dallas Boat Quay visits, their service is the best & of course food is üëç"
Great venue,"Rose was the friendliest waitress you could ask for! The food was delicious and surprisingly quick given the restaurant was busy. Drinks were cold and well priced, with the view over the river - a perfect backdrop. We even were treated to a birthday plate for one of our guest‚Äôs birthday. Highly recommend if you are lucky enough to get a spot."
Terrible service and unfriendly staffs,Really terrible service and unfriendly staffs. I reserve for outdoor but i was not informed earlier from restaurant either call or text outdoor is full. Staffs unwilling to arrange for us.
Great lunch,Had a nice lunch and a couple of beers here. Service was good and food to match. Will return next time I'm in Singapore.
Highly Recommended,All crew are friendly and helpful especially the chef/kitchen staff. Food was quite good and price is affordable.
Good service but a little over priced,"This busy bar gives a good view of the water and light show. The nachos are a meal in themselves so just ordering these between two would gave been enough. Popular with groups meeting Smal, bar snacks were the best orders."
Birthday Lunch,"Booked in for a birthday lunch for 8 on the Friday of the hectic F1 weekend. Great setup upstairs, excellent food and drinks, all great value. Easy process and friendly staff will do that every time we come back!"
Had a great time at here,Service and Food is perfect. Waitress is so considerate. She helps to adjust the aircon when it got too cold and even got me warm water to keep me warm. Will visit again!
Pleasant Sports Bar,"We ordered the Dallas Wings, Classic Wagyu Burger and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken, where all of them were good!"
Best burgers in Singapore,"Dallas has been dishing up really tasty food for years, and their burgers are the best - especially the lamb burger which is my favourite. Jason Pope runs a brilliant pub and restaurant, with friendly and attentive staff. Can‚Äôt wait to get back there on my next visit to Singapore!"
Consistent Wow,"Dallas Boat Quay consistently wow me with their service, dedication and responsiveness. Its a sure haven if you expect good food, reasonable price and consistent great yet prompt service."
Great taste,Lunch set meal is very nice in quality and quantity. Mexican food and hamburger are special. Dessert is also very good. Anyway drop in here then never regret‚Ä¶.Thanks a lot
#boycottdallas,"Dallas was our go-to place for celebrations. My friends and I went for margaritas and nachos on July 20.

It was crowded, so they put us at a table with chairs on the edge of a curb. The chair fell off the ledge, I fell and hit my head on a ground lamp, it happened minutes after we had arrived, we were not even drunk. There was blood everywhere from the 3-cm gash in my head and i went to the ER in an ambulance. No apology. No checking in to see if i was okay. No followup. No humanity. We were the best of customers, but dallas has burned any goodwill it had with me and my friends. Owners should be ashamed of themselves. #boycottdallas"
Enjoyable Outing,"Very good food and good selection as usual, and the very friendly and attentive waitress despite what seemed to be fairly short handed situation, make the outing even better!"
Regular customer with a bad experience,"We had reservations and when we arrived I had to go up to the waitress named Gina and asked if we can sit ourselves since we can clearly see our name on the table. Without a word, she just gestured with her hand to go ahead, so we sat ourselves. Waiting for some time and no one visited our table so I got up and got our menus myself from the host stand. When we got our food, our steak was not cooked well enough. My husband ordered medium but received his steak raw with the meat inside bright red and soaked in blood so he only ate the ends. I ordered medium well but received it medium. I only ate and fed my 3 year old daughter the ends as well. Since we‚Äôve visited this restaurant many times before we mentioned it to the manager towards the end. The only reason why I didn‚Äôt rate the service terrible is because the manager was nice enough to give us 10% off our bill and a complimentary brownie ice cream dessert. My family usually prefers Dallas over other restaurants but not sure we‚Äôll be coming back anytime soon."
dinner,"ordered the set menu. food quality is decent but what stands out is the service. Restaurant was pretty busy and only three service staff.

I was using the paper serviette and one staff saw that. He put another paper serviette in the glass without me asking. Very attention to detail. Thanks so much."
Great location poor food,"Excellent location on Boat Quay. Menu great and good service. Food was just poor, it was bland with cold fries and over cooked fish"
Dallas Restaurant & Bar (Boat Quay),"The food here is incredibly delicious, and the cocktails are worth every dollar. However, service was a bit slow with 2 out of the 5 main‚Äôs we ordered being served around 10-15 minutes later than the rest of our‚Äôs, so just a heads up! Location is right in front of the river and we could get a clear view of The Fullerton Hotel from our table. Ambience was nice."
Hot steamy day,"... and chanced upon this place, where I saw it served Little Creatures pale ale. Ice cold and accompanied by the antipasto platter. 2 drinks, one a G&T, with an $80 S. bill. Terrific lunch in a very swanky place at a very reasonable cost. I'll gladly return for more!"
Great time,We always delighted when we go to Dallas Bar BQ. The staff are friendly and amazing. The food is outstanding.
Nice ambiance and very friendly staff,"We live in Singapore and like to go to Dallas for a drink or lunch. The cocktails are very good and they have our favorite beer ""Stella"". Also the food is very delicious. I like the staff there because they are very friendly!"
Excellent food and ambience,"For the quality of food and their portion, the pricing is surprisingly reasonable. We had nachos, prime rib steak and the Dallas platter and drinks of course. Service level is fine too. Will go back one day, definitely!"
One of the best,"I have been in Singapore for around 3 months. Dallas in my opinion is one of the best Restaurants in the city. The good food is complimented the best staff and outstanding service. Special thanks to Irving, who always makes sure everyone visiting is very happy with the food and the experience.
Cheers"
Great Food and nice ambience!!,"I had a business lunch with my colleagues. The set lunch is really a worth especially the way they handle beef is really tender and juicy. All my colleagues like it so much. Very enjoyable moment we had!!!

The only set-back is that they lack of man power. Only 1 or 2 waitress to attend to the customer. Took a while to get their attention to serve us."
"Good food, however not a good place for vegetarians","Usually, you have a 2 course menu with fries and a salad (optional with fish) which also can be eaten by vegetarians. As of now, you don't have any vegetarian 2 course menue, only with fish or meat. Which is a bit unfortunate."
Ok,Air conditioning was set too cold the food became cold and tasteless within minutes. Informed staff but it was brushed off.
Loved the Meat platter and one of the best Long Island ice tea in Singapore,"Dallas is a go to place for Meat Platter and drinks especially Long Island Ice Tea tried in many other restaurants but Dallas serves the best very liberal in portion. My family knows that for me DALLAS is go to place, anytime."
"Great service, sliders","Service is outstanding. Truly one of the best service in Singapore. We spent a little over $100, but was ushered to a third floor private dining area. The space smelled a bit musty but it felt quite bougie to be honest. Very quiet and perfect for a date. The portions are huge! My fiance didn't like his steak all too much though. The tacos were cold, I think from the guacamole - it would have been better if the temperature was warmer. The standout dish is 100% the pork sliders. It's honestly the only dish I recommend. The apple pie for desert was mediocre to be honest - I don't mind having a few bites but won't order again. Overall, I would not recommend ordering too much food, just a few drinks and sliders and you're good to go. I would come back just because the staff were so friendly. It was a good experience. PS Toilets are nice and clean too haha"
Infuriating,"This is infuriating. At 4.45pm, I requested to sit at the bar by myself when the tables were empty & they gave me the whole regulations thingy that it's not allowed. Without any resistance, I agreed to a table outside despite the hot weather. Next thing I knew, a white guy was allowed to sit at the bar when the place is packed at 5.45pm. When I asked the manager, he argued that the place was packed when I came and that now it's empty. I pointed to him that all the tables are packed now so who is he kidding? In all honesty, it's a Friday, even if you are not there, do you think 5.45pm would be empty and 4.45pm would be crowded? The guy even try to smoke me with eyes wide open in a packed place. I questioned him, why do you allow a white guy and not me, the Asian lady? He couldn't give me a proper answer."
Excellent service by Lou-,"Excellent service by Lou- food was great we ordered 2 sets of CNY 2-course menu (prime rib steak & dessert) + nachos . Overall a fantastic customer experience from the moment we walked in , we were warmly greeted . Highly recommended !!"
Great place,"Great service, wide western menu - just what I wanted for a Saturday lunchtime. The portions are big, the beer is cold, it‚Äôs a lovely setting - what more could you ask for ? Will be returning soon !"
Birthday Celebration,I had arranged for birthday dinner with my friends. Total 4 pax and bill was $580 which we had ordered 4 bottles of wine. Service is good.
One of my favourites,This is possibly the best eating restaurant in the boat quay area. the food is brilliant and the value beats many other places. Will continue to go back.
Very nice food and great staff!!,"I went for some drinks and food Sunday and the staff were great. Prices are reasonable and the burger and chicken parm were awesome, huge servings as well. I will be back again for sure. Much better trained staff than most bars I've been to in Singapore. Thanks for the fun day!!"
Great food at decent price !,"A great time in Dallas tonight. Great good , great waitress and great ambience. Sounded like a bar but the food is actually good for value. Especially miss Lou was exceptional! She was attentive and what impressed me was she can remember my order without even writing down! She served well and make sure we always have clean plate to eat on each course ..very patience and friendly. We have ordered the calamari which was excellent as the squid retina tender and crispiness outside are hard to do! So don‚Äôt miss to order this.. we miss the nacho as it runs out. We have the Dallas burger, Dallas steak, pork pull quesadillas and pork ribs . All good except the meat inside a little dry. The drink was reasonable price with house pour wine at $10 ! Lovely night and for sure to come back again!"
Excellent Burge and Beer combo for lumch,"Went in with a friend for their Wednesday Burger and Beer special for lunch. Basically they throw in free half-pint of draft beer for the price of their Burger on Wednesdays. The burger is excellent (big Angus patty, great bun) and very well put together. Had a hard time finishing it, as it comes with coleslaw and a bunch of fries.
Have been to Dallas Restaurant for dinner; used to love their Suntec location. Too bad it closed down.
They also have excellent calamari., and Boat quay location is great. Not very crowded these days in the post-COVID lockdown period. Highly recommended for good American food."
"Excellent staff, good food.","Excellent and attentive service staff. Food generally good. I thought the slow-cooked pork ribs were deliciously tender and tasty. My sister had the beef, she wanted it medium well but came out a little tough (but acceptable). In any event the staff were so apologetic and sweet. Ready to go an extra mile, such staff are hard to find. Lunch deal is worth going for, steak (with wine) at BQ at $40++, definitely worth going again. Definite thumbs up... Thanks guys!!!"
What a happy Friday at Dallas!,"Very good food at Dallas. We have halloumi fries, calamari, fish tacos, black angus steak and avocado chicken parmigiana. they are all so deliciously prepared and came in huge portions. Our cocktails and brownie to end the meal were good too. But best thing is the service. All the service staffs are friendly and cheerful, even with their masks on. We can feel the hospitality and love the vibe at here. My friend felt so cold in the restaurant and they actually realize it and turn up the temperature at our area without us telling them. it was a full house friday. totally didn‚Äôt expect such great service. Dallas you did well and continue doing!"
A surprise find on our way back to our hotel,"After a long day out in the Singapore heat and humidity, we were on our way back to the hotel and stumbled across the bar. The staff were trying to get you to stop and because it was happy hour (between 4-5pm), beers were only $5! This worked and we stopped for a few drinks (the next day too on our way back)!
We also had a meal on one of the evenings, which was plesantly good and a nice suprise. It is right on the rivers edge, so you could watch the boats and people pass whilst drinking your cold beer (or Singapore Slings).
Nice find, friendly staff. Thank you"
"Lovely food, Friendly staff and good views across the river","Walking up Boat Quay we came upon the Dallas Restaurant and Bar. There was a good choice of food and when it came it was well cooked and the portions large, The staff were very friendly and efficient. As we were the evening there were good views across the river. Very good value"
Celebrating a special event of a friend,Besides the nice view which the restaurant has... Shout out to the staffs who are friendly and attentive to the customers needs. Food serving is great as well as the presentation. üëçüèª
Great Burgers and Ribs,"Came here on 5th January 2020 after looking at reviews. Was looking for something different to the curry and Chinese food we‚Äôd eaten so far in Singapore. So went for Burger, steak and ribs restaurant.

I hadn‚Äôt booked, we turned up on chance of getting a table. It was very quiet, which worried me but thought we would give it a go as the reviews were good. We were shown a table on the outside terrace on the river side.

The whole family were very happy with the dishes they chose. We had nachos to share for a starter, and mains of; Dallas burger, Full rack of ribs, house burger and a chicken dish with advacado.

The service was attentive and friendly.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant and this particular location at Boat Quay ( there are three Dallas Steakhouses in Singapore I believe)"
PLEASANT AND LIVELY,Plenty of bars along the river but this one took our fancy on our first night in Singapore. Good friendly service from the manager and his staff. Based on our first night experience we called again a couple of nights later. Good food as well.
Good food,"Very good food, good ambience, good behaviour. Very expensive and other than putting food on the table, no service was provided yet full service charge was taken"
Amazing restaurant!,Love the food and drinks at this resto. Great service and great staff too! The happy hour really makes this place amazing too!
"Great food, good service and nice cold drinks","This was a really nice meal as we had the beef sliders,Schnitzel tacos, fries and croquettes to share. It was all delicious. Service is good and the food came out fast. Highly recommend"
Was very nice to make the,"Was very nice to make the event (02.12.2019) in this restaurant! Everything was perfect: location, food and beverage! Thank you Chanttel, was pleasure to make the event with you! Thanks a lot:) Liza"
"Great Staff, Service and Food.","Always have a great time at Dallas in BQ. Staff all so friendly and helpful, good food too and specials at lunchtime are good option. My number 1 spot in BQ. Thanks for looking after me so well!"
Just wanted AMERICAN food,"Thought this would be the best for it. It was ok, the service wasn‚Äôt good. The calamari was best part."
Great spot,"Enjoyed a Sunday evening meal here with my family. Super chilled wine, great kids meals and lovely outlook. We specifically came here for steak thinking it was a steak restaurant. But there is only one steak on the menu. Fortunately all of the other options were great too. Thanks Ellen for your prompt and friendly service, you‚Äôre an asset to your employer!"
Good steaks and beer,We had a good steak with beer and some veggies with an exeptional view on to the Singapur river. The service was really fast and friendly!
Good cocktails,"We stopped here on a Sunday afternoon for a couple of cocktails. We asked the guy who greeted us if they did a good Singapore Sling - his reply yes. I have to admit he lived up to his statement. The Singapore Sling was lovely as was their margaritas. Prices weren‚Äôt bad - we were there at happy hour. Service was great - the staff were all very friendly and helpful and the cocktails came out quickly.

Great way to spend an hour or so along the river."
"Great food, professional staff",Best Pork chop I have ever had in my life! The meals were great and very reasonably priced. The set menu is an absolute bargain at 2 courses for $26++ or 3 courses for $36++. Staff were extremely polite and friendly as well! Not to mention the views. Wish I was staying in Singapore longer as I would definitely come back.
Poor experience,"Food average at best , my daughter wanted a bowl of just mac and cheese ( which on the menu came with crab meat and lobster meat ) , still got charged $23 !
Also my meal never arrived , I did then tell them not to bother cooking mine as it was too late as the family has almost finished theirs ..... however they did bring it but didn‚Äôt charge me...
I wouldn‚Äôt return , there are better places on the Quay, it was a shame as this was our last night in Singapore!"
Amazing food,"The food here is delicious; I had the set meal which consisted of the steak, apple salad and dessert. The portions are HUGE"
Nice spot by the water,"Visited here a couple of times during a week holiday in Singapore. We enjoyed the seafood platter, cold beers and great service. A great view of the river."
Dallas food delights,"Just had a walk along the boat quay in Singapore trying to beat back the food promoters while trying to select a good spot for dinner. We took up their offer for a three course meal for 36 dollars. I had a seafood bisque soup followed by A300gm sirloin and apple pie.
Admittedly I had to pay ten bucks extra for steak but it was perfect. Ditto for the soup and apple pie."
Great afternoon happy hours,Stopped in for afternoon drinks after exploring the area on our second day in Singapore. Loved the seating overlooking the river and enjoyed many cold beers and cocktails. We only had appetizers to eat but they were very nice. We enjoyed ourselves so much we went back there the next day as well. Thanks to Chantelle and Terrence for looking after so well.
Big portion of steak,"Had the 3 course meal. Generous amount of steak and soup. Big bowl of soup and wow the prime rib steak is quite huge. We ordered medium and medium rare, but it doesn't look medium nor rare. It looks more like medium well. Overcooked...
Staff are quite friendly. We were sitting at the outdoor area. Great view but all the tables and chairs are crammed together. Very squeezy. And also one of the chair has so many ants! I think something sweet dropped there which results in so many ants. Will be great if they do check on these."
Good position,"Pleasant staff, very helpful, decent food and drinks but a great location overlooking the harbor . It‚Äôs really a great place to sit and watch the world go by."
Pretty Good,Pretty good but the service wasn‚Äôt the best (my meal arrived 15-20 minutes after my wife had been served hers) and there‚Äôs a lot of tables and chairs crammed into a small space which makes getting in and out tricky. The lobster taco was superb
Great food and helpful staff.,"Well I‚Äôve had some great food in Singapore so far with one or two exceptions. But I just enjoyed the best steak I‚Äôve had in a long time, happy hour Sunday and great staff. I will be back many times. Thank you."
"Dodgy start, but Manager pulls it off !","We booked a table upstairs with a view of the bay, and arrived at our time ready for a great night out having read the reviews.
The barman told us that they were understaffed so the restaurant was closed. You can imagine we were a bit annoyed
Manager then said the a/c was broken, but showed us to a table by the bay and gave us a free drink.
The food served was great, lobster taco‚Äôs and chicken fajitas.
It was superb.
Well done Mr Manager"
Nice lunch spot,Dallas is a handy spot for lunch with great views of the harbour. The service is friendly & prompt. Not an extensive menu & not cheap but then nothing is in Singapore! The food is good quality & the beer is cold!
"Restaurant that offers good food, service and views","Location: by the river and if you get a table by the window on the upper floor, you will get a postcard view of the river and the CBD buildings and the Fullerton.
Food: we had the ribeye steak which were tastefully marinated and chargrilled. Ended the three course meal with a great cup of latte (and I do like a cup of good coffee).
Service: prompt and staff were friendly.
Conclusion: great experience with good food, lovely atmosphere and friendly service. A special mention of thanks to Chef Vernon for the superb food and Lu (spelling may not be correct) the friendly staff who waited on us which made the evening a very memorable one. We will return."
Fantastic food,Massive thanks to Lou and all at the Dallas Steakhouse. A fantastic dining experience. Great service and great prices!!
Yummy steak by the water,"Had a great time at this restaurant. My girlfriend took me out on a birthday date here and I couldn‚Äôt have been happier; the steak was delicious, they had one of the wheat beers that I liked and the view over the quay was magnificent. Will definitely come back when I visit Singapore again!"
Great food and gathering eats by the river!,"Serving up great food with good quality, portion is huge and beef doness rightly balanced! Did not expect to be this good but turns out a positive surprise on the food served."
Great place to hang out,Lovely staff here at the Dallas Bar. Tasty wine on offer on the happy hour promotions. Super location. Place to meet with friends and family.
Reliable,"Good food, good value and friendly service. Try to avoid the lunch time crush as they do get busy deservedly so."
Worst attention impossible,Nice place with nice view. The only thing that made our dinner the worst was the service. Waitress all the time with their mobiles and talking. We didn‚Äôt exist. Won‚Äôt recommend and come back!
The worst service,"Really the food was amazing but the service with the phone is horrible.. really I need to call 10 times to the waitress to bring me a glass, salt, oil and my water? I‚Äôm not comming anymore ! Thanks you"
Had a great Prime Rib steak kere !,"Not always easy to find a restaurant that serves great steaks and also something vegetarian for my wife but we stopped off at the Dallas one evening as we walked down Boat Quay -- what a great choice by me , my steak was just perfect and her "" ladyship "" was well satisfied with her salmon and salad."
Good food and good drink,Hello to all. The Dallas Restaurant in Singapore is a good place to take the lunch during your business day. The only one thing can improve is to have a better ventilators for outside area. All other are very good.
Perfect location,Just love Dallas .... great place to eat and the menu is great or simply take in the fabulous views of Singapore /
Amazing food and drink!!,Great ambience and music and friendly staff. Lovely cocktails esp singapore slings. Great beers too. Excellent value with happy hour and amazing burgers. Thanks. A great night. Will return.
Awesome Fish 'n Chips by the River!,"This was a perfect spot for a quick business lunch. A short walk from Raffles Place, my colleagues recommended Dallas. We all ended up ordering the Fish 'n Chips and none of us were disappointed. Great vibe, nice aircon / fan combo, very good service and overall great value."
Lovely afternoon at the Bay,"Walking past my husband and I fancied a little tipple. We noticed it was happy hour. Draught beer for ‚Ç¨10.
Our favourite beer Stella !!
Whilst there we ordered a delicious pizza for ‚Ç¨25. BBQ chicken. Full of topping not tight at all.
Because the music, the atmosphere and the food was so lovely we decided to stay for another. Well worth a visit if your on the bay. Not as expensive as other bars and very tasty food"
Ribs and Service were only fair,"I read up on ""the best baby rack ribs in Singapore"" and this place got a good rating.
So I ordered the ""Firery Ribs"" and they were very ordinary. I assumed that firery meant spicy hot but no, no heat at all. Maybe I got the wrong dish? The receipt was correct.
I have cooked ribs myself much better than this.
Service? None. I was surprised, plenty of staff but as it seems these days they are busy talking to each other and not taking notice of customers. They did jump when called but that is not what it is about.
Maybe I am just getting too old!
Maybe I am harsh with my ratings but if you are to rate as one of the ""best in Singapore"" you should be much better than this."
Good ambience,"Met with a friend and my son here for drinks and food. Good range of drinks, seriously good food and great staff."
Great place to hang out!,"Good Food plus Great service from Maricelle! The service was fast, and the food has big portion for us to share. Meat platter is highly recommended üëçüèΩMe and my friends were able to relax and chat! Fun evening at Dallas üòÅ"
Great view and yummy food!,"We had our dinner on Friday night at Dallas Restaurant & Bar. I tried Maxican food for starter and main course i.e. Nachos and Fajitas. It's really great and good quantity as well. We tried drinks as well, it's really good.

Service and environment are good as well."
Dallas by the river,"Our group of friends were looking for a casual evening, and booked Dallas at Boat Quay for the riverside dining atmosphere. The food matched the nice ambience as we enjoyed the fajitas, and the prime rib steak for me. They had a monthly 3 course set meal for SGD 39+++, so it was a no-brainer to get this set with the caesars salad, prime rib (12 dollars extra), with dessert and coffee. The service was also very good. Had a beer tower, which was ‚Äúonly‚Äù 3 liters. Have had it at other places, where the tower is 4 liters, so minus points for that. On the whole a good place to hang for a relaxed evening. I have tried their burger with the lot at another outlet and it was also very good."
Lunch,"Had the bbq chicken, there was a generous topping of salad, and the chicken had a thick layer of cheese on it, great TGIF lunch"
A great environment for chilling,"A very good restaurant and bar for chilling. One of the waiter which is called Alfred, he is very patience and friendly. Very enjoy at this moment."
Good environment and dinner,"We have celebration party at the place where we occupied the whole 2nd floor. Good for event gathering, environment is cosy and the food is generally quite good."
"Great Staff, Great View, Great Food","We had a great dinner today at Dallas ‚ù§ The staff were nice and friendly. The manager checked on us and ensured that we were fine! One of the staffs- Ci En was very welcoming and pleasant- she would always offer a smile and talk sweetly to make the customers feel comfortable. The ambience is awesome!- didnt want to leave so soon! ( was here for 3 hours++) The food tasted yummy, and filled our tummies.

Thank you for an awesome dinner! Will definitely be back with friends!!!"
A great choice in Singapore,"A solid choice for dinner down at Boat Quay. The menu is varied and sure to have something to suit everyone.

Myself and my husband had 2 starters and 2 mains to share, all were fresh and tasty. The portion sizes are huge.

Also they have a happy hour from 5pm-7pm with specials on beer, wine and Prosecco. Great for a couple of pre dinner drinks.

By Singapore standards I would say priced in the middle of the spectrum."
Great lunch,Great location on the water at Boat Quay. Friendly staff and good prices. Had the $20 weekend lunch special of a beer and burger. Several to choose from. Very tasty and well cooked. Would recommend.
Wahlbergers - Eat your heart out! This is number 1!,"We spent the day wandering around the Marina Bay area and taking a long trip to see the sights. Late afternoon and we wanted a cool drink and something to eat. I opted for an amazing salad with salmon and my first ever Singapore Sling (it would be rude not to!) and my husband had the burger. Now he has a burger everywhere we go in the world and up until last year he had always said his favourite was a Wahlberger from the chain owned by Mark Wahlberg (the actor) and his brothers Donny and the other one (sorry!). However, the burger from Dallas was so good he said it was better than a Wahlberger, so that says something It is not cheap, but neither is it expensive. You are paying for really tasty, well prepared quick food, in a setting by the water. The wait staff were great and helpful and we would go back again in a heartbeat, when we were next in that area of Singapore."
Best view of the Singapore River - and excellent food at sensible prices,"During our 4 night stay in Singapore we ate dinner twice at the Dallas Restaurant and Bar alongside the Singapore River. The atmosphere is great, there's all the activity on the river to watch, and being in the heart of the business/financial district there also a lot going on shore side as well.

The menu is quite short, basically this is a grill house, concentrating on burgers and the like. I had (twice) the grilled chicken with avocado and cheese, taste wonderful, and gargantuan portions! My wife chose very nice salads and a burger, also very nice. The beer is cheap by Singaporean standards too.

Staff are friendly, service is prompt, and the price modest by Singaporean standards. All in all dining here is a great experience, the combination of the atmosphere, views and food is unbeatable. Needless to say you might need to go on a diet if you eat here too often!

Thoroughly recommended."
Very nice,Very nice reasonably priced food. Great service. Nice location. Would recommend this place. Good variety of food.
Great bar on the riverside - fab bar food too,"Really nice bar at Boat Quay - good prices, seats under cover on the quayside if the rainstorm breaks...and if it really pours - take cover inside at the main bar.
We enjoyed great service, chilled beer and a couple of snacks of the menu - great squid and fries!
Recommended."
Get together,Always a pity when the menu you came for is sold out but must admit that the staff sorted this out pretty well and came up with pretty good alternatives. This made the evening still successful.
Just drinks,"Visited whilst wandering around boat quay.

Typical bar - nothing exceptional about it - had sports on a couple of screens, and food coming out of the kitchen looked good (we didn‚Äôt eat).

No working WiFi, which was disappointing but drinks were cold and air con even colder.

Not bad for a couple of scoops and chat."
"20% off for food order by 6.30pm promo, really? Doubtful !","We were having a ladies night out on Fri, 20 Oct 2017 @ Dallas Restaurant & Bar. I emailed enquiries@dallas.sg with supporting to clarify the next day, 21 Oct 2017 upon noticing the food ordered by 18.16hrs were charged in FULL, without 20% off promo (note: totally bill was split by 3-credit card transactions).

On 3 Nov, I patronised the same outlet for a quick happy hours drinks. I provided my feedback to the outlet manager, Irving Tolosa, Group Restaurant Manager.

1) He offered to extend the 20% on food all night that evening, knowing that Im there for ;a quick happy hours drinks ONLY.

2) Then, I asked for the appropriate refund to our credit cards in view of his lack of customer service, cited that I‚Äôll unlikely revisit the 3rd time, as he absolutely tactless !

3) He proudly shared his business card & requested me to drop him an email with details, where he has been made known a detailed email been sent on 21 Oct. Obviously, he simply COULDN‚ÄôT be bothered, but taking it out of convenience to him! Truly no qualms of inconvenience the customer, and expected customer to ‚Äòfeed‚Äô him with details instead of doing a simple check/appropriate investigation finding internally !

Sadly, to date - neither do I receive a courtesy reply nor an update from Dallas Restaurant & Bar, needless to mention on our requested refund !"
Drinks overlooking harbour,"We were on our way to the Gardens by the Bay and decided to stop for a drink. The tea pot came and looked promising as it was fairly large. However there was only 1 tea bag in the pot and it was like dishwater. We asked for another tea bag and the girl said we only provide 1 tea bag!!!! So we had to empty some water out. Then I asked for WiFi and they said it‚Äôs only for staff to get food to the bar!!!! What a shame. Not impressed.
If you want tea bring your own tea bags"
nice cosy ambiance upstairs,"was planning a dinner session, and was recommended the upstairs seating. the ambiance was formal yet cosy, which provided us lots of privacy. the food was rather decent, and we enjoyed the friendly service as well. would come back again."
