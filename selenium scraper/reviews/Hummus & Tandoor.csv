Syukran jazilan!!!!"
Smooth Hummus near Sultan Mosque,"The host was delightful, he deduced that we were vegetarian very quickly and made some suggestions. We took him up on the cold mezze + a couple of different breads.

Located on a quiet corner, with tiled tabletops. We saw the resto in the morning and made sure to stop by for dinner, absolutely worth it!"

"very good food , great customer service","food was awesome, staff was very attentive, great customer service, lamb chop was very tender and juicy, sure we be back"
Loved it,Beautiful lunch and wonderful service. Came here as it looked good and we weren’t hounded by the guy outside! He was lovely and the food was great. The fresh squeezed juices were a great addition too.
Fantastic food large portions.,"Fantastic food large portions, efficient but laid back vibe. Friendly staff, clean restaurant and in a nice lively area."
Bestest Food,"Best food ever, came for 2 evening meals out of the 4 nights we were in SG. Friendly staff, great food and drinks. Recommend"
Not authentic and not worth going in at all.,"Not worth going in at all, no point coming for any food, and not authentic. I went to order Lahmacun.
I asked if they knew how to make it cos i did not see any Turkish chef around. The guy assured me. And what came out was a thick pita type bread with minced lamb. No taste. The cook handled the food without gloves and took my two Lahmacuns out of the oven 5,6 times to check on it. Obviously inexperienced. I felt cheated. Nothing remotely close to a Lahmacun. Before i left, i looked at it and took two bites. Sorely disappointed. i did tell the staff that what i ordered was not a Lahmacun. See the pictures for yourself."
Amazing food,Dad and I stopped in for dinner and decided to try the moussaka and lamb chops… for 2 people this was plenty. Absolutely delicious and so filling… now we need a car to pick us up to go back to the hotel
Nice food,"I had the falafel roll, it was nice but I think I prefer chicken. The hummus dips were something new. We had meat platters which were enormous and came with briyani rice"
Nice Grill Platter,"Grill platter was perfect for the family with a good mix of grilled lamb, beef, chicken and kebabs. The mezze platter had a good mix of dips. Kids liked the freshly baked pepperoni pizza. Service was great all round and liked the ambience inside."
Food was not up to standard,"The food was mediocre at best. We have tried many of the restaurants serving middle eastern food in that same area and in comparison, this was the worst food in the area.
I will never go back there again, especially when there are better options nearby."
"Great food and service, nice ambience","Very good hummus and bread, chicken tagine was nice too. Excellent service, food came quickly and staff are all very friendly, would definitely come back again."
"Most Amazing Kunefe, Baklava and Coffee By Hummus And Tandoor Islam and Riad!","Most Amazing Kunefe, Baklava and Coffee! We love the cosy beautiful atmosphere with splendid decorations and furnishings. We are very grateful and thankful to Islam and Riad for taking good care of us during our visit. They are so helpful, friendly, kind and attentive."
"Great dishes, great value","So nice to visit a restaurant highly recommended by TA which more than lives up to its billing. Lovely dishes, great value, friendly people."
"Great food, service and ambience.","We visited on a Saturday night and was ushered to the second level which was beautiful and cozy. Ordered the mixed grill platter for 2 pax - it was just the perfect mix of meat options. Everything was cooked to perfection, the service was impeccable and we will definitely visit again! Thank you for making our night a memorable one, D’mahal!"
Excellent Food & Friendly Staff,"Very tasty Egyptian food., one of the Best Restaurant in Arab Street Especially the bread which you don't feel bloated after eating . It's freshly made and fragrant when served. Chicken & Lamb meat was soft . Friendly Staff . Mint Tea was Great . Will visit again . More important pocket friendly restaurant ."
Very poor service!,"It was a gathering with a group of 8. Made reservation via quandoo and when we got there, we had to sit separately in a table of 6 and 2. We had to ask the person to rearrange for us, he was abit reluctant at first. And after a while, he decided to make the arrangement for us which is possible.

Next, I check with him what entertainer app 1-4-1 dishes are we entitled to. He told us one table only able to use one coupon. From my many years of using entertainer app, coupons are based on number of pax. Logically speaking, 8 pax is allowed to use 4 coupons, but the boss told us one table only allowed to use one coupon. WHAT?
For those intending to use entertainer app there with large groups, please do not go there!

Next, we asked for the bill 4 times and it didn’t come to us.
The restaurant is not very busy at that timing, however I’m not too sure why the bill took so long to come. There was once we asked for the bill again , the boss was too busy trying to get customer inside their restaurant, he just glance at us and ignore. After which he just continue to do his things and we got to go to the counter and ask for the bill for the 5th time. He even pass the wrong bill to the wrong table?!

Besides all the bad reviews on the service, the food in general is not too bad.

But I’ll not go back to this place again. Feels like we are not respected as customer at all."
Lunch,"Good food, very tasty and not too salty. Staff were friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the chicken mandi and some of their dips."
Very good dinner!,"We had a good time here. Ordered a few dishes for sharing. Food was good, especially the moussaka. Ambience was good."
Good eatery and good service,Had the food here for dinner with a couple of friends.the serving was food. Highly recommended for those with burpple 1 for 1
Not Bad,"We got hummus, chicken kofta and chicken tawook. The rice was great, the tawook MEAR was a lil' dry, but overall it was a good hole in the wall. Lemonade mint was great!"
Grilled chicken dishes,We ordered two main dishes - shish tawook and chicken kofta. Chicken kofta was nice and tender. Hummus came with a flat bread kind of thing. Would be nice if we can have more bread with it. Drink was nice.
Very good food! Great ambiance,"Very good food! Great ambiance and very friendly staff. Service was fast, overall an evening well spent"
Restaurant review,"We ordered the Lamb Mandi and Chicken Kofta. Portions were very generous with flavourful basmati rice served with big portion of meat, salad and salsa. Food was delicious! Will come back again!"

"Delicious food, great service , best Lebanese food","Delicious food, great service , generous portions, friendly staff and helpful, mix grill is to die for , lamb chop is the best so tender and juicy u should try lamb chop , they offered us baklava on the house Sure we back soon"
I should have taken a photo.,"How is it possible that they have so many good reviews from people who has only written one review on TA?

Husband and I were craving for some kebab/ middle eastern food and headed to Arab St area.

Staff was busy soliciting customers on the street and that’s how we ended up inside. We also had 1 for 1 via Entertainer/ Burpple.

We mentioned we were looking at having the shaved kebab sort of meat and he said he can prepare something off the menu and it costs $29.90. It ended up being seasoned chicken breast meat, nothing like what we had expected. Salad was old with wet vegetable, rice was tasteless.

The beef kebab I had did not come on a skewer but just a few cubes of meat on the plate. No charred/BBQ taste and it was so hard.

We didn’t finish our meal and had to go off to somewhere else to get a fresh new meal.

Abysmal, will not recommend."

Overated tourist trap,"TripAdvisor told us this was in top 40 restaurant in Singapore. Living in Singapore I wonder why this is?! No idea...

The food: I am quite accustomed to middle east food and I can say food in this restaurent was below average. The Muttabal was the worse: lack of spices, no grenade as on the menu, a fizzy taste, merely an aubergine puree, with tasteless cheap arabic bread. The Mussaka was not much better. Even the fallafel were a bit funny, like spicy and possibly overcooked.

The prices: are those of a tourist trap. Being localed in one of Singapore most touristy area, these guys are obviously taking advantage of it. Needless to say the value for money is low.

The service: except for the boss, the waiting staff seemed careless, inattentive and non-chalant, making mistakes when serving dishes, being dress like they would go for a run, not giving a damn that the dish looked like nothing on the menu.

Depite this I must admit the main waiter (maybe owner) was kind enough not to charge us for the dish we found horrendous and offered us a drink. Maybe he was thinking of the review I would write."
First time trying Lebanese Food,"The restaurant has high rating On TripAdvisor, so we go and try it. The restaurant decoration isn’t that great. The food however is good. The thyme and cheese pizza is good surprisingly. Average hummus, and the lamb Madi is very good. The table is too small to hold all the food we ordered."
"Best Lebanese food ,awesome service","Food was delicious , staff very friendly and helpful , we had hummus with fresh bread , mix shawarma , and chicken shawarma all were nice lemon mint was fresh thanks"

"Good food, great service","On a day date with my husband. The decor makes you feel like you’re in Lebanon. Met the owner, he was so kind. Just across the way from Kampong Glam restaurant. A very lovely meal there. The mint lemonade is refreshing too!"
Very good food and service,"This is my third time here , my new favourite, staff very fast and kind we had chicken shawarma was very nice mix grill very delicious sure we come again and again for sure thanks alot for treat us like family members"

Great dinner,"Very good hospitality , great staff very attenrive , lemon mint very fresh they offer us mint tea on the house sure we be back"
Have to return in a week,"2 trips in a week- first time i went partly because it was not crowded( given its covid time- thats a factor we have to look to) and partly because of the favourable reviews. We tried the mezze platter, lamb kofta and chicken Shawerma and washed it with lemonade mint. For the next weekend trip which happens to be her birthday we originally were planning for yantra for an Indian treat but my wife wanted to be back at the same place and try the same dishes. I m glad we did so - the only change was we replaced the shawarma with chicken kofte and falafel.

The only regret we had is because we repeated the same items we may not know if there remained some hidden gems since in my next trip also we probably will repeat these wonderful dishes. Strongly recommended if you like mediterranean dishes - if you have not tried before this will be the best place to srart.
I realised i was so full could not try kunafa - pending next time."
Best Lebanese food,"Best Lebanese food , great food and service Staff very friendly and helpful Food was delicious Mix grill was awesome Bread was fresh We will come back"
"Hummus way too salty, almost","Hummus way too salty, almost inedible. Other mezzes were good. Meat platter ok, some cuts were very dry. No credit cards accepted. That it has 150++ excellent reviews throws a mockery into reviewing in general. It’s decent, definitely nowhere close what I had in Dubai."
Very very surprised that this,"Very very surprised that this restaurant is rated 38 in Singapore at this time of writing.

Went with a party of 4 and we felt the food was overpriced and of average quality. We ended up paying $210 for the following items
- 1 hummus platter for sharing
- 2 pita bread for sharing
- 8 falafels (which were really good) for sharing
- 1 main course each ie a sharwarma (which comes with the most dismal serving of fries - 10 fries per pax!)
- 1 lemonade each

This worked out to $50 per pax and we would not return to this place... there seems to be plenty of other options in Arab street and the restaurant was practically empty on a Friday night as well."
Home delivery of yummy Turkish food,"We ordered home delivery of Turkish food owing to the lockdown and were very happy with the food quality, taste, delivery on time. The owner is very courteous and patient to help with queries and even helped to customise the meal plan and included a free desert and bread. The Chicken Pide and Mixed Grill are must try!"
Pick up,"Must visit. Everything we ordered was amazing. The hummus was so fresh, baba ganoush was yummy, falafel wrap is recommended, its value for money. Mr Mahmoud Abdelaziz is a kind gentle man. He took the order on whatsup and advised me what to order since we are vegetarians. He also added in free baklavah and moutable. Very courteous service and Overall a very great experience. Waiting for the lockdown to open so we can visit in person"
"Delivery Mixed Grill(2 people) & hummus, $40","Mixed Grill was dry and rice bit hard when delivered. They included 2 free items, but didn’t fully enjoy main course. Left feedback in conversation as well. Management was receptive and pointed out when delivery food is covered, it will continue to “simmer” from kitchen to destination, hence harder than usual.

Also noted, menu pic and what I got looked quite different. Overall 3 stars."
food delivery,we decided to order food from hummus and grill during covid 19 food was awesome and delicious as usual they give us baklwa for free and hummus as well we will keep ordering from them again
Delicious,We’ve ordered from Hummus & Grill three times since the start of circuit breaker. Love it! Delicious and good value for money. Will keep coming back.
Home delivery,"This shop was recommended to me and it was on 50% offer. Ordered Hummus lamb & hummus chicken. Both taste fine and acceptable to me. Given free bread, but the bread was a little tough to munch bcos i have sensitive gums. Not recommended for elderly. Haha."
Mediocre.,Mediocre food. Tasted not very fresh and waiters and chef appeared somewhat unkempt. Rather surprised at all the positive reviews which misled us in our choice of restaurant.
Delivery,Food is delicious at a reasonable price! Will definitely recommend this resto! Perfect for occasions as well!
Great food,Decided to order delivery from this restaurant during the circuit breaker. And the food was delicious. The mix platter of meat was great and the hummus and falafel was very tasty. Can tell that it is all home made! Would definitely order from here again!
Hits the spot,"Had the food delivered due to partial lock down in SG. Very fast response, person was friendly, food was great. Took longer than expected to arrive but it was worth the wait. Good sized portions and was a treat to eat. Thanks!"
"Absolutely delicious, generous servings, we will be back for more!","We ordered takeaway as we are under partial lockdown in Singapore, and want to support the local F&B scene. I was blown away by the quality of the food. The food was still warm when it was delivered. So delicious, generous portions, and my typically picky children came back for seconds! Sorry couldn’t post a pic as we ate too quickly We’ll be back for more!"
Excellent food and hospitality. Will be back.,"We went to eat here last week and were absolutely blown away by the hospitality and food. We loved eating everything we ordered, including the cold mezze platter and the meat platter. The dips were superb with the freshly made pita bread. The grilled meats were also tender and juicy (not dry at all). The owner was fantastic, throwing in a lot of things on the house and a good deal on our ice teas. On the whole the service was great. We thought it would be difficult to decide which restaurant to choose on this street. We chose this restaurant based on the reviews and were not disappointed. We will be back."
"Great Service, Good food","Special off menu food for me due to my diet restrictions. Great friendly service, nice ambience Food is good👍"

Fantastic Service with Lovely Ambience & Great Food,"It's our 2nd time here and it's our 1st choice restaurant when we come to Arab Street. Today we had Mixed Grill and Grilled Fish. Fish was really Amazing as it was fresh and felt healthy to eat. The Chef is very versatile and cooked according to what we requested and we enjoyed our meal with a nice Hot Mint Tea afterwards. Mahmoud was always looking out if we needed anything, his customer service is pleasing and we felt very welcome even though we sat there quite some time. Warm n friendly place with amazing good.

Thank you.
Cheers

Fantastic food and service,"Fabulous meal with great service

Food was fresh, delicious and decent portions. Plenty to choose from! We had the moussaka, haloumi, hummus and beef/lamb wrap. Was fabulous. We were also given some drinks, chips and entree as complements which was so generous! We had a lovely dinner and staff so friendly. We had our toddler with us and was very easy with high chairs available. Sitting outside under the canopy was lovely. Definitely be back and highly recommend"
Great food great service!,We had a delicious meal at 1001! The food is authentic and the service is outstanding! I would highly recommend heading down to Arab street to give this restaurant a try! Yummo!!
