Appalling service,"Menu did not have the item I wanted. Disappointing Next, A great challenge to get hold of an available server. I had to go get my own bill after my meal. Will avoid this branch in future. Not even for a free meal…no way!"
Mom's B'day,Best place to be at for any occasion! The service crew were impeccable. We had great food and great service. it was a wonderful celebration. Will be back again :)
A Party We Had,"We had planned a get together for a friend’s birthday and Marmalade Pantry came up as a choiced venue. We were greeted warmly by Charmaine who ushered us to our table and served us our water very promptly. She even introduced us to the Triple Plus card and recommended us to some of the food items while we waited for our other friends. When the rest of the party arrived, Lynn helped us with the ordering. Food came quickly and they were all yummilicious. We had soups, salad, a cold dish, beef, pork, fish and desserts. Lynn gave us two cupcakes to celebrate our friend’s birthday. Thank you team Novena. Appreciate for making the night work for us."
Great food and ambience,"The food was pretty good in terms of portion size and taste. Ambience of the restaurant was nice albeit hard to find, with all the constructions going on resulting in blocked pathways.
Service could be enhanced as the staff went ahead to prepare my second glass of gin tonic (assuming i want the same drink) without asking. The rum spiritz my bf had was not smooth at all."
Good service and nice atmosphere for meal with friends,Good service by the staff there and they were very patient to give us recommendations as well. Food was delivered fast. The place is sheltered from the MRT station so one do not need to worry about getting there in the event of wet weather (not the underpass at B1 but via link bridge at Level 3).
Lovely hi tea celebration for a birthday,Lovely birthday celebration with friends. Food and beverage were delicious. Gold Moscato is by far best tea tasted.
Lunch on 8 Feb 2022,The food is good. Value for money and the atmosphere is very good for gatherings. Will definitely go again.
Felt rushed by staff,"Nice food and to be fair, the staff were not rude but we were rushed and hurried a number of times to make our last order by different staff and they kept asking to clear our plates even though we were not done eating. The bill was also given us to settle in the middle of our meal unfortunately. Towards the end, they would remind us of the time - eg that it’s 8min to closing. Their current closing time is 9pm. I hope that is not permanent as it’s such a shame to feel so rushed through a meal."
"Marmalade Pantry, Novena",This location is much more elegant and cosier than the one at ION Orchard. Food is good. Will visit again.
Superb service!,The staff were super kind to my 9 month old baby. Food is great! Portion is more than enough for us. We had a discount too!
Great welcome greetings,"Great portioning of main dishes. Tuna watermelon salad was good, barramundi was on average and crab pasta was good. Service was excellent! Thank you. Is a definite, we will visit again."
Great food,"Nice food and ambience... Didn't know there was a promotion for payment with Mastercard until after we paid.. As there wasn't any display of the promo, would be nice if service staff could let us know when we asked for the bill."
CY2021 Gathering at The Marmalade Novena,A nice place for gathering as it's spacious and not noisy. The staff are patient and GEMS...They overhead that one of our friend's birthday and had given a Birthday Cupcake and such sweet and nice gesture. I loved the salmon set and overall very happy with the food and service. Thanks the staff for their good service and nice place for great gathering.
Great service and food at reasonable price,"Service was great, Charmaine called 2 days earlier to remind me of my reservation, she was helping us with our orders too on the day itself too, gave us good recommendations on food and beverage."
Enjoyed my first dining experience at Marmalade Pantry @ Novena,"Everything is perfect. The ambience, service, food, and pricing. In fact, it exceeded my expectation."
Disappointment,"My 2nd visit to Pantry Marmalade after the 1st visit that left an impression on me a year ago. However the ambience, the food and overall visit was such a disappointment.

We had the executive set lunch and tbh it's really not value for money and I can get better elsewhere.

I ordered the lamb chops but the knife provided was not a steak knife but the normal western food nice which is not suitable to cut up the lamb chops. I had such difficulty with the meat that even my partner could tell just by watching me handle the food.

Ambience was lacking too with harsh lights shining down on us. Seats were a little too close for comfort as well."
High Tea,We went for high tea but ended up ordering some food as well. The mushroom risotto is excellent. The savoury items in the high tea was much nicer than the sweet items. Nice place to sit and catch up with old friends.
Great service for average food,"Great service but the salads were average, the Mexican salad was a let down. The mushroom soup was very nice though. However, $3 for a slice of bread to go with my soup is ridiculous!"
"Quality food, welcoming ambiance and excellent service","Amazing dessert, food and service! The signature seared scallop and prawn pasta and clam vongole pasta are the must try for me. And not forgetting the Sticky Date and Toffee Pudding dessert. The staff team at Novena branch was friendly and attentive too. Service was excellent. Makes me want to go back for more. Highly recommended!"
Scones were dry and doughy,"was rather disappointed with the tea set. while the service was good and the savoury items were nice, the sweet items were soso and the the scones which I was saving for the last was dry and crumbly - tasted like red mart frozen scones."
A little luxury goes a long way,"Little luxuries are the simplest things which make the largest difference ... these mean the most. Our meal at Marmalade Pantry at Novena began with a kind and efficient greeting at the door by Raymond. He was welcoming and warm... then our server, Charmaine was wonderful to walk through the online menu (when we had trouble downloading), and took our orders with patience and a great smile, even behind the face mask.
The food arrived in good time, and the Hokkien Mee was well cooked, despite the heavy pepper shocking me a little..., but it was pleasant enough. Kimchi Fried rice with a nice steak, was a lovely combination, as the flavours balanced well on our tongues. The shared dessert (recommended, of course) was a wonderful end of a great meal.
Our kind server, Charmaine, added warmth to this Cafe, as she gave us diners enough private space, and yet was chatty enough, as if we were being hosted in her personal kitchen... such warmth makes our meal most memorable. Dining is seldom only about functional taste and beautiful food, but the experience of warmth and kindness of heart. This little act of communication was huge to us... a luxury we will always treasure.

Thanks guys.. you know we will be back!"
good restaurant etiquette,"Special compliment to Rahmad for his good recommendation for good spicy crabmeat , Pan-Seared Barramundi and and Caramelized Pear Bread Pudding. We enjoyed the food very much. He has great knowledge on the ingredients too. Thumbs up & keep up the good work! Cosy Environment ! Will definitely recommend to my friends !"
Great service,Enjoyed the visit to marmalade pantry at Novena branch. Happy to be able to reserve easily using chope.
Good food and ambience,"The main dishes were prepared quite fast, presented sophisticatedly, and were delectable! The chocolate fudge cake was super rich and good. They made for a filling meal"
Great service coupled with yummylicious food!!,It was another great experience dining at Marmalade Pantry. The service was impeccable as usual as the staff was engaging & ever so cheerful to serve with a smile albeit behind a mask…. Worth repeated visits!
"Great service and food, 100% recommended 🥰",The staff SYAM was so friendly and attentive. The truffle beef burger was amazing too rich in flavour and taste.
Lunch with Gal friends,"Nice ambience, friendly staff, yummy food. There were 3 of us, we ordered a salad and a pasta. Each of us have a glass of juice ... enough tummy space for dessert and coffee. This was the first visit for all of us and we agreed to return to try other food, especially the desserts."
Good service,"Food are generally good with reasonable price. Thumbs up for one of the staff, Rahman, who is observant enough to inform me that I can get 15% off for master card user and helped me refund accordingly. Good atmosphere as well"
Excellent!,We had an enjoyable experience dining here. The ambience is very nice and the service were excellent! The staff were courteous and attentive. My fav was the desserts. Overall good food! Good staff! Highly recommended for those who haven't try out this restaurant yet.
Good Food and Service,Was very pleased with the excellent food as well as the excellent service especially at the branch at Novena. Most pleasant visit!
Nice quiet afternoon for hi-tea,"Ambience is cozy. Service staff is attentive and able to recommend and chat with us. Food has mainly hits than misses, with the truffle sandwich being the most outstanding, and scones being the most boring and ordinary."
Simple meal,Wasn’t too bad .. services are pretty Good.. meals are reasonable and portions are big and it’s value for $$
Fantastic experience,"Great staff and pastries. We were there for tea. Highly recommended for ambience, staff and quality and variety of cakes."
Excellent Experience!,"It was a wonderful catchup time with a friend. The service was good and the ambience was just nice for conversations. Food was also delicious, with generous portions. Only thing was it was slightly in the pricier side. Nevertheless, all is well! Will visit again."
Value for money but service needs to be improved,"Upon arrival, the manager saw us waiting but continued to let us stand at the entrance without even a nod of acknowledgement. He continued to let us wait for a few more minutes before coming over.

I was not able to find the Afternoon High Tea Set in the menu after scanning the QR code and informed the waitress. She very brusquely told me that it's in there. When I was still unable to find, she showed it to me impatiently."
Good food,We went for the mothers day high tea. It was a good spread and the preparations were tasty. Overall a pleasant experience.
Friends outing,Went for the high tea from 3 to 6. Ambience was pretty alright. Staff could be a little more attentive. Had to call a number of times before they refilled the hot water for our tea. They were polite though. Food was alright. Quite an experience overall.
Average food but quite expensive,I thought it was overpriced for the quantity and quality of food received. I had the pork belly which was also a bit oversweet.
Big is not Best!,"Don't order the Big Breakfast. Stick with something more exotic - prawns benedictine, for example. By the way, here is no real Marmalade at the Pantry! Nothing artisanal, nothing thick cut, nothing bitter. Commercial marmalade out of a supermarket sourced bottle, at best."
The sticky date pudding as usual is the highlight,"We had our favourite chilly crab pasta and the sinful mac and cheese. My husband liked the mac and cheese while I usually enjoy the pasta. However, as usual, the highlight for us at Marmalade pantry is the sticky date pudding. It is always served warm, moist and drenched with caramel sauce, which is not too sweet, and a vanilla ice cream. It's one of the best sticky date puddings we've tried in Singapore. Have tried this dessert elsewhere but it is usually not as moist."
Highly recommend u to come,"I would like to compliment Syam! She is a very friendly staff, who engaged us, tell us the promo on burple, and recommended us the food items to eat. The food was awesome and the ambience is great!"
Afternoon High Tea,"This was the second time we had been to this place. The tea set was great, as usual. The quantity was just nice for 2 pax. We find the ambience lovely and conducive for discussions. The staff were attentive, without being intrusive. Had a good time enjoying our tea. Thank you! Highly recommended!"
poor service,"Multiple incorrect orders came to my table asking if I had ordered an item
Table that came after me got the high tea set before I got mine.
Far cry service from ion branch."
Birthday at The Marmalade Pantry,Brought my dad for his birthday lunch. Grilled salmon was good. Crab pasta was good too. Liked the ambience and service was good too.
Pleasant Surprise,"Did not realise menu was different from Ion outlet, hence did not get to order my fav dish. Notwithstanding that, the pork belly and scallop linguine were good as well."
Not over the top,"Did not have a pleasant experience and was rather embarrassed to have chosen the restaurant for an important social gathering. Would advise against to if you are thinking ofr going to The Marmalade Pantry. Went with a group of friends , the waitress assigned to serve us was not very polite and not quite friendly. Some friends arrived early and were made waiting outside despite being quite empty in the restaurant. The customer service was very bad."
Excellent service,"Excellent service and food. We were in a hurry to go back to work after lunch, so I asked the waiter to derby the food quickly. The food was served within 20 minutes."
Understated,"On the recommendation of a quiet venue for high tea, we made a reservation for four at 3pm on a rainy Saturday. The MRT underpass was not accessible so had to go up Novena Square mall and across to the Marmalade Pantry bistro next to Oasia Hotel. The decor was plain,service staff distant and not particularly attentive. The QR code menu didn't work so we had to ask for the various options for tea and coffee, mainly settling for Earl Grey and a long black. The scones were fairly good, one raisin and the other plain, served with clotted cream, jam, Marmalade. The cakes, red velvet and pecan chocolate cupcakes were delicious but the sandwiches were dry and unappetising, made quite a while earlier, we suspect, white or brown bread lightly toasted but neither crisp nor delicate. The tuna sandwich was more moist and tasty than the the egg or salmon triangles.
The only advantage was that it was quiet and we were left undisturbed to enjoy our discussion.
If you need the restroom, you have to use the one in the alley outside the bistro."
Excellent food and service! Thanks Charmaine!,The food was very good (truffle burger)! Very nice experience and perfect service from Charmaine* (Sorry for the spelling) 😊 (31 December 2020)
"Classy venue, Good foods","The place has a nice ambiance, service was attentive , we were fortunate to get a seat as we had no reservation and the place was full. Special shout out to Rahman for his excellent service, he was very courteous and caring. The foods portion are big and tasted good. I had sweet potato fries for starter and it didn’t dissapoint. Had really high expectations for the mac and cheese but it’s 3/5. All in all definitely worth visit."
A friendly kitchen just like at home,"I like to friendliness of the serving staffs that have the patient to wait and give recommendations to my two daughters when deciding what desert to go with. The manager is also helpful in assisting me out to process my voucher when footing the bills. Lovely food, lovely people and lovely experience. Thank You Guys!"
Great service!,"Love the service provided by Syam! She is patient and she is considerate to our needs! Even though she has to serve multiple tables, she is cheerful and positive and she make our day! Thank you so much! ❤️❤️❤️"
Good service and ambience,"Had dinner with a friend and tried the Hokkien Mee and kimchi fried rice as we were curious of the taste. It was not bad and the hokkien mee is as legit as the ones you find in hawker centers with quality ingredients.

Rahman provided good service during our meal :)"
"Great service, food & ambience :)","Second visit here and I must say that Charmaine is a star. I was served by Charmaine on both occassions and I love that her service is pleasant and unobtrusive. We were a table of HR Professionals and mutually agreed that we would hire her for our organization in a heartbeat! (I’m really sorry to say that when we were served by the other service crew, they pale in comparison...)

The desserts were divine. We ordered the Carrot cake, Salted Caramel Cheesecake, and a cupcake. (Salted caramel cheesecake was good, we ordered twice).

Food was good - Chicken caesar salad, Pasta with scallops and prawn, Kimchi fried rice, Truffle Fries, Chicken Sriracha Burger.

Ambience was nice and comfy. Not too crowded.

We will definitely return :)

Thanks again Charmaine!
Please recognize Charmaine for a job well done."
Attentive service and good selection of food in quiet environment,"Although the food isn't cheap, it is affordable for the hefty portions. They also have daily happy hours. Quiet, cosy environment with attentive staff who'd ensure the dining experience is enjoyable."
Enjoy the friendly service and food.,"The truffle fries were delicious. Definitely recommend to anyone.
Mac and cheese was good too if it was not for the cheese on top which is very salty.
Scallop and prawn linguine was a bit salty, otherwise, it would be 5 stars.
However, the friendly staff and the ambient make up the lack.
Pricy but the portion of the food is big.
So, that makes up."
Marmalade pantry,The restaurant had a nice ambience and the service was good. They gave us ample time to view the menu and decide our orders. Thank you!
seafood main dishes are good but pasta were too salty,"A group of 5 tried this restaurant and we ordered:
1. pumpkin soup - taste great!
2. mushroom soup - taste great too!
3. salmon - taste great!
4. burra fish fillet - thumbsup
5. risotto - rice not cooked (texture is powdery when rice is not fully cooked yet)
6. carbonara - too salty
7. prawn scallop pasta - too salty
Staff quickly noticed our expressions and she approached us to fix Item 5-7. great efforts there :)
8. got a complimentary chocolate cake, very delicious"
"Best service, good food and great ambience","Highly recommended place for a good meal. Excellent staff especially Ms Charmaine, she made me so happy that i look forward for my next meal here again!! This is not my first time here but definitely not my last. You will see more of me here!!"
"Warm, friendly Service","The staff was attentive and friendly and took special care with my dietary preferences. Syam deserves special mention because of her professionalism. She was attentive to the small details without being intrusive. Takes a special personality to achieve that.

I had a great time at the restaurant. Thanks to her."
Superb food fantastic service,"Came here over the weekend with a girlfriend
The restaurant is cozy nicely located at Oasia Hotel. Nice and quiet for some relaxing meals and chit chatting
The food is super delicious beside looking exactly like the picture published in their website
A shout out to your staff Syam as she is really warm and passionate with her job
She knows her product knowledge well and we're were very satisfied with her recommendations
Keep up the good work guys.
Will be back again!"
Lovely Sunday Brunch,"So glad that we chanced upon your bistro at Novena this afternoon.The food was great and was extremely impressed with the quality of customer service we experienced.

We were attended by Ms. Syam and Mr. Chua, who were well-versed and extremely attentive. They displayed genuine interest throughout such a great commitment to customer services should be commended highly.

Thank you both for a lovely afternoon. We enjoyed ourselves very much."
Excellent and Friendly Service,Food was delicious and service was excellent and friendly. Staff Syam provided good recommendations and customised service. Will definitely come again. Thank you for fulfilling experience.
Good food,I had a lovely brunch here with a friend. Service was attentive - to be fair the place was almost empty! Food was well presented and the menus are extensive.
Professional and Friendly service,Stayed at Oasia Hotel Novena for my Stay Home Notice (SHN) upon my return from UK. My appreciation to the staff for promptly taking my room service orders and delivery of meals to me. Kudos to the restaurant manager and his team!
Lovely hosts made the difference,"Kudos to attentive and charming hosts Lynn and Charmaine who made our lunch a delightful experience! We felt absolutely welcome, which made the perfectly balanced burger and decadently flavoursome risotto taste 2 notches better! It's a shame though that the MasterCard discount did not apply to executive set lunches or illI be back pretty often!"
to Syam : cosy and a warn service that comes from the heart,"has the pleasure to be served by Syam three times in a row ( twice for breakfast and a afternoon tea). Adding to the cosiness of the place, Syam's casual yet warm service attributes lighten up our days. She'a attentive, has a good sense of humour, and gives a personalised service despite the heavy load she had. More deserving so for her efforts after finding out that she was a victim of the lockdown and has yet to return home to meet her loved ones. if this is not professionism, then what is.

nice to meet you Syam and Thank you.

Wishing u and your family safe and strong.

joe"
Best Service Award goes to...Syam!,"I came for a quick lunch today. Food quality is pretty average though quantity is aplenty. Syam is a gem! She’s attentive, personable and made our dining experience a joyful one. I’ll definitely be back."
Nice Ambience,Visited the one at Novena. Food is good and price is reasonable. We had the pastas. The restaurant has nice cake and tea too. Strongly recommend.
Great ambiance & food,The restaurant had a great ambiance. Service staffs were very pleasant and the food was amazing! The menu i must say is very well thought out! I hope to visit again and try more items from the menu!
Great Food,"Had Brunch on Sat, food was great especially the big breakfast with sausage pork.Portion was big and value for money.
Ordered Latte came with nice art. Special thanks to Merridy who take care our table and rexomended the breakfast. She is very friendly and keep checking our tables all the times."
Very exquisite experience,"My wife and I have came for hi-tea to celebrate our friend's birthday on 29/2/20. Three of us really enjoyed the food there in The Marmalade Pantry. The Char Siew Kurobuta Pork Belly melts in the mouth, definitely a must-try!

Apart from the food, ambience of the restaurant is nice, environment is clean. Staffs are well-attentive!! Kudos especially to the pregnant hostess for bringing the cake to our table, it definitely not easy for a woman to walk around with a baby in tummy.

Thank you and happy working!"
Birthday celebration,"The staff is super friendly, very attentive. We are happy to have a wonderful birthday celebration here. The food is aweeeesome."
Excellent service,Excellent service and excellent food. Nice environment and my kid love the place. Quiet place for gathering.
Belated birthday celebration in Marmalade Pantry at Novena,Made a reservation through Chope and had 15% off ala carte menu with payment of mastercard. Excellent service and good food! Nice ambience and a great place for girl’s catch up!
Great place to catch up with friends,A wonderful place with elegant ambience and delicious food. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Truly a great place to catch up with friends.
Visit for Mom's Birthday Dinner,Excellent food. Service was very good. Very nice and relaxed ambience. Area was also quiet but we enjoyed the intimacy of the atmosphere.
super service and quality of food,"The vongolo was so delicious. The spaghetti cooked al dente. Clams were fresh and juicy. Most important of all, the quality of service was great."
Great place for gathering,Nice food. Great service and fabulous ambience the hi tea set was value for money. Will definitely go again
Never disappoints 😃,"Great for meetings or catching up with friends. Have been coming since 2010. Particularly enjoy the fish dishes, and (recently) the risotto. Good range of pies and desserts too!"
Disappointed that our favorite Waygu Steak & Eggs was not available!,"Went to Novena Marmalade on 5th Jan to celebrate my son's birthday with the family. We went there specifically for the ""Wagyu Steak & Eggs"", which is my son's favorite. Waiter informed that it was not available. Subsequently, we found out that its likely that we are not informed as we booked via Chope reservation. Went for the Laksa instead and was very disappointed with the portion and quality. Vastly different from the marketing photos."
Excellent ambience for tea,"We choped the afternoon tea 2pax set. Friendly and helpful staff. For the money, the food assortment was great. The place was clean, nice and quiet perfect for catching up. What a day!"
Won’t be returning,"2 out out of the 5 mains on the lunch set menu had run out, but they only told us after 10 minutes of us ordering. Service ranged from poor to average depending on which waiter was serving. Very pricey for what you get. Wouldn’t come back."
"service,food and place",staff are very friendly and accomodating service are excellent and foods are very satisfying highly recommended sure will revisit again!
Birthday celebration,"we brought our own birthday cake, not knowing that outside food is not allowed. The restaurant manager was super nice, I think his name is Joseph. He didn’t want to disappoint us, complimented us with 2 slices of cakes for my sis and my birthday. Such service is exemplary and must be commended."
Weekday Lunch at Marmalade Pantry Novena,Food was great. They served our one order of soup nicely in two separate bowls when they knew we were sharing it. Service was great and professional when available. However they were clearly shorthanded as it was difficult to get a service staff free to attend to us throughout our time there.
Half day of leisure,"Ambience is great for a leisure afternoon as my friends and I have planned for a tai tai theme gathering for Christmas. Staff Syam introduced the festive carvings platter for 3 for lunch since we planned to have hi-tea later. It was a great suggestion and the platter is yummy (though portion size is tad small... There are only 2 piece of beef for 3 to share ?) We added salad for balanced diet. We ordered the hi-tea set for 2 which the sweets items are much nicer than the savory items... Overall, we enjoyed ourselves and Service is great."
Bday celebration,Awesome place to have a birthday celebration for my friend! Excellent service and the staff was very friendly. Special thanks to Syam for surprising my friend with cakes! The food was very good too! :) Would strongly recommend this place to all my friends.
Enjoyable,"Our 2nd visit back to back here at Marmalade! This time round, though we didn't managed to make any prior reservations, we were promptly seated upon arrival.

Service standards remains top-notch as compared to the outlet at Ion. Food service were timed properly, both on mains came together, served piping hot! Service staffs were very attentive and refilled our waters and and when required, without prompting. In addition, if we need to reach out to service staff, they were alert and came over quickly.

Food served is delicious as always, and was satisfied with our meals. Ambience is really enjoyable, quiet yet convenience! Overall, we really enjoyed dining in this outlet, always!"
Pleasant evening with friends,Service staff was friendly and cosy place for gathering with family and friends. Dessert was really good.
Nice Main Course and Dessert!,I am not a sweet tooth person but Marmalade Pantry managed to wow me with their desserts. I loved that their desserts came with smaller size so that I could try different flavours of cakes. Their main courses did not disappoint also. I tried their Seared Scallop And Prawn and Grilled Salmon. Both were equally good. I will definitely visit again with Entertainer App.
Lunch Meeting,"The experience was good, with great food and good customer service. It was an enjoyable meal, just a bit noisy."
Awesome food and service from,Awesome food and service from the crew! Was given a complimentary birthday cake for the birthday boy.
Room for improvement,"Nice ambience
Convenient location
Average service (made a reservation via Chope but took us quite a while to be seated inside)
Expensive menu"
"Good ambience, service and food","We were there for a birthday celebration, and was pleasantly surprised at how quiet and chill this outlet is, so different from the outlet at Ion. We were served promptly upon arrival, table service was superb with out needs being attended to without having to call for the waiters. Food was delicious, and ambience was superb. Will surely visit this outlet, more than the one at Ion in future!"
Very good except for cakes,"The meal was delicious- pork ribs ,burger, roast chicken. Service was pleasant and efficient. Nice ambiance. The only disappointment was our dessert - the lemon meringue and banoffee, though great looking, were both terribly dry."
Greta value using Entertainer 1-4-1,Came here for late lunch on a busy Saturday but service was faultless and efficiently polite too. Great value with the Entertainer 1-4-1 (mains) offer too! We had the prawn and scallop linguini and char siew pork belly both of which were delicious. I had a less than ideal experience at the Downtown outlet so I am guessing the chef here is the better one :)
Wonderful!,"It was our 2nd visit and it looks like it won't be our last! Loved the food (we had the wagyu and eggs, and the caesar & kale salad), wine, and the excellent and friendly service by Fairuz and his team. Thank you! See you soon!"
EXCELLENT,Marmalade Pantry Novena never disappoints. Every meal prepared to excellent standards. 3-Course Lunch with colleagues was satisfactory. Serve was great... attentive and friendly.
Healthy living,Tea time and looking for salads! Came to the right place! Tuna salad was 2 thumbs up!! Buratta yummy!!! Heirloom tomatoes were super fresh!
