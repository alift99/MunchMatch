New Year's Eve 3* event did not do the hotel's reputation justice,"We have been to the Fullerton Bay hotel quite a few times. Not to stay the night but for dinners and brunches. This time we decided to opt for the New Year's Eve champagne dinner. We were looking forward to a classy night out. Unbefitting the class of the hotel however, the organiser of the event seemingly decided that the volume of the sound equals the level of enjoyment. The volume was so elevated, we could hardly hear the person sitting next to us at the table. We virtually had to yell at each other, for 4 hrs! The buffet set-up was nice as well as the food, but not being able to talk to each other decently was crazy. People around us started staring at their phones or stopped talking to each other all together. Some families came with kids and grand parents, and it was clear this is not what they signed up for for $600 per person. The quality of the band/singers playing would fit a low budget high school party, which made it even worse. I complained about the volume level multiple times and at one point a restaurant team lead called Azoul shot back at me that he could hear me well. Scanning the room he felt everyone had a great time. I think he needs to learn how to better read a room. Ultimately the best part of the night was the great view of the fireworks afterwards and the party outside. During that time (after 11PM), one of the employees started to charge for champagne in cash payments only. This seemed like a total scam and we reported that to Mrs Ibrahim, the duty manager. So overall, a very odd experience, and totally not the level of class the hotel usually stands for, in my opinion."
Gin Parlour - the place to be on a sunny evening,"Came here with my wife and a couple of friends for one of our friend’s last night in Singapore after many years living here.

My wife had booked the Gin Parlour and it turned out to be an inspired choice!

We had a fantastic table overlooking the Marina Bay Area - although in fairness all the tables look to have great views - but when combined with a beautiful evening, the sounds of the team practicing for the NDP, the gins, the food and the Happy Hours it meant that we spent a very pleasant evening enjoying the best that the Parlour had to offer.

Our waiter, Sibiil, did a terrific job and even mentioned to us about the Fullerton dining card that saved us 25% on the bill - great customer service!

Definitely a recommended spot that we will be back to, but you do need the weather to really enjoy the location to the fullest."
Restaurant is Closed. Bar is open,"I booked for The Clifford Pier on Chope only to be told on arrival that the restaurant is closed but the outdoor bar is open. I had booked for a friend’s birthday dinner. Imagine being told they only serve finger foods and limited to choice of around 6 to 7 items. What saved the day was the excellent service of the cheerful waitress who tried to find alternatives but to no avail as it was a Friday night. Anyway, we have no choice to do our best to enjoy the wonderful views and cool weather. Finger foods were ok."
Amazing service,I reached about 45 mins earlier than my reservation timing because I finished my dinner early. The hostess accommodated me and my partner and let us sit early. Loved the menu and the drinks and the view.
Heritage dim sum brunch,The service provided by ASEL is very good. Our water is filled up promptly and the requests are accommodate. Ambience is very nice as well. Its a nice place for friends and family.
Very beautiful place but unfortunately avg food,Very beautiful place but unfortunately the food was just average. Good to go once but doesn’t give you any reason to come back. Service was not so great except one manager who was running everywhere to compensate for her lousy colleagues
Favourite place for a brunch,"I love coming here for brunch, really such a beautifully decorated spot. The food is spot on and so is the experience. First class costumer service. Not too expensive for all that you get."
"Great Food, Great View but service not so much!","This is a review for their Christmas Eve Dinner 2020. My friends and i arrived at 8PM. Water was served within the first 10 minutes, no problem. After that has been a downward spiral experience at this restaurant. I specifically remembered two tables around us that arrived at least 20-30 minutes after us that got served first.. I lost track of how many times our group have asked for a followup. Also there was clearly a lack of supervision with the staff, courses are Being served in no particular order and it was obvious the staff were confused which food goes to which table. I would expect the servers to recall/remember what course they have already served to each table. The servers i think clearly tried their best but I feel that this restaurant is understaffed. Such a sad experience on a Christmas Eve. The only redeeming factor is the food. It was delicious. The view is wonderful. However, i wont be going back to this restaurant again."
Very Nice Place to Celebrate the New Year,"Went to have New Year dinner with family. Food and service was wonderful. Atmosphere was great too.

Staff even knew who is having the sea perch and the tenderloin without asking us.

Apart from the mains, my favorite dish was the marinated king crab.

Attentive service by the whole team"
"Good drinks, view, great staff!","Made reservation via Chope at 6PM, but went earlier, to our surprise we were accommodated warmly. We were greeted by Nicoleta who was super friendly and warm. Staff were attentive and friendly. Femia (pardon if I didn’t spell her name correctly) was also a great joy. They have a good selection of happy hour drinks. (Price range starts from $9++) My friend and I enjoyed our time as everything is a delight, the drinks, ambiance, view, and most especially the staff. It’s a hidden gem and a must-go for people who just want to chill out or catch up with friends. Will definitely be back soon!"
Heritage Dim Sum Buffet,Food was fresh and good. Service was excellent. Quite a good choice of the menu. Would be perfect if it comes with coffee/tea considering the price that you paid @$59++/pax. Love the ambience!
Best brunch Menu and amazing staff,"The resrvation was easy and staff has checked us in smoothly. Ms femie assisted us all thoughtout. Her demeanour was very pleasant and always smiling. Food was very nice, my favorite would be the mantou and the durian brulee"
Amazing environment! 5/5,Amazing environment! Location: 5/5 Food : 3.5/5 Variety: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Drinks: 4/5 Overall: 4/5 weekend dim sum brunch
Best service,"We were at Gin Parlour last evening. Anthony (I hope I got his name correct) and Asle definitely has exceeded our expectations. Well done to their service recovery. We ordered a bottle of wine, however it was out of stock. And they even tried to get it from another restaurant. We really enjoyed our evening there. Even after the new bottle of wine was served, they even offered us a cheese platter and fries. Appreciate for the effort made! I will definitely come back again.

Thank you. Keep up the good job."
Magnifique!,"Beautiful place, good service, good french wines in Singapore. The place is amazing if you want to look at the bay water show! I had a good birthday party! The singer sang my song, what else do you need to have a good evening! The food is correct."
Quite Disappointing,"We came here after a staycation at the Fullerton hotel. We had a great experience at their in-house restaurant Jade which is why we were sorely disappointed when we went to Clifford Pier. The food came cold except for the fish maw soup. The service was good at the start but nearer to the end of the buffet they stopped serving our items despite us asking for them. We also were served items we did not order like chocolate ice cream. When we asked about them, we were told it was because they did not have the flavour we asked for and this was a replacement. We found it a bit strange that they didn’t just come back to us to ask what replacement we would like instead of just forcing a random flavour upon us. Needless to say the ice cream just melted there as none of us ate it. We also had to ask for water 3 times before it was delivered.

Despite all this, we had a great service experience from Nicoleta! She was very polite and gave great service with a smile.

We do hope the restaurant can step up their service and food standards as it seems a huge waste given the beautiful venue."
amazing dimsum brunch buffet with friends,"Would recommend it for local dishes lovers, unlike your average high tea, good mix of singaporean dishes like carrot cake, noodles, kueh, dimsums, and traditional hot desserts aside from the usual ice cream and stuff, would recommend, love the ambience too, had a great high tea with friends before COVID i really miss the place"
Dimsum Brunch,Great views but so-so dimsum. Service was very slow. Had to call the waiters all the time for them to top-up the free flow or bring over the dimsum cart. The dimsum selection was very small portion and not very tasty. It's a 6/10
Dim sum brunch,"I was there with my family for the dim sum brunch yesterday. To our surprise we have add on $18 for free flow of coffee, tea and juices. This is not acceptable and logical that basic hot beverages are not being served together with our food, not for a 5 star hotel restaurant.

Although stated in the menu as shown, it is at the last sentence as shown in the picture.

Nice ambience but we will not be visiting again anytime soon."
Not recommended,"Visited on 15t Aug. This review is based on the expectation of the hotel brand and at the price tag of $58+ for the Heritage Dim Sum brunch.
Tea is not included, pay $18+ for tea/coffee/juice/soft drinks.

What is worth mentioning is the ambience. The restaurant is beautiful and overlook the water. Good variety of food that reflect the singapore heritage.
However, food quality and service is disappointing
Interesting some items is different from what is stated on the menu. E.g. the Tiger prawn laksa has no tiger prawn nor prawn. When I ask the server, I was first told that tiger prawn laksa is just the name of the dish. It does not means it has tiger prawns. Awhile later i was told they run out of tiger prawns but has replace it with other prawns. I have to show him a bowl of laksa to convinced him that there are no prawns in the laksa at all.
Iconic Chilli crab Bao is also not filled with Chili crab gravy. Rather it’s a simple fried mantou with a chilli crab dip on the side.
Perhaps the restaurant can update their menu to reflect what’s really being served.

Service wise, it’s exceptionally disappointing. Perhaps we expect too much from the Fullerton Brand hotel.
Few encounter
- we have a server with a dim sum cart came to us TWICE asking us what we would like from the dim sum cart. Both time we wanted the siew mai and shrimp dumpling and both time he was out of both items. And of course both time he say he will come by again.
- Most restaurants and/or hotel lobby lounge will remember what is the order of each guest and the order will be served to the correct guest. This is not the case when we order coffee and tea.
- Due to the COVID situation, we will place our food order with the staff and they will serve us. There were quite a few time they got the order wrong
- Will need to ask the wait staff for water refill. Again, at most restaurants and/or hotel lobby lounge , the wait staff will attend to such details without prompting.
- finally, when we are paying, we were given a wrong credit card to sign on the terminal. After a few fail attempt then we realised it’s not our credit card and alerted the staff.

Overall, you get better service else where and better tasting food at any of the dim sum restaurants chains like crystal jades or THW.

PS. I hope I don’t get a template reply from the restaurant GM."
Brunch at The Clifford Pier,"Menu is put together with care to showcase the heritage food of Singapore.
Quality in Tim sum items is good but not the rest.
Price of $58 excluding tax and service charge is a little on the high side considering coffee and tea are charge separately.
Service staff are attentive and friendly.
Nice ambience."
Weekend Dim Sum Buffet at Clifford Pier T,"My wife and I enjoyed the dim sum buffet greatly. Have been waiting for a couple of months for them to re-open which they finally did this month.
A great place to eat and relax. Couple with good food and service made the time enjoyable.
This is a buffet served at your table. Don’t even have to walk and order. I do empathise with the staff who need to walk so much to make sure that the customers receive their order promptly."
Afternoon Tea Experience at Clifford Pier,"Prior to the whole circuit breaker situation in Singapore, we visited Clifford Pier for their signature Afternoon Tea on a weekday. This allowed us to enjoy without the hassle of the weekend crowd.

Overall the food was delicious and tea/coffee selection was good. Service was okay as the staff were spread out and getting their attention from accross the restaurant can we challenging at times. The food was refillable which was delightful for us as we throughly enjoyed certain items and kept on ordering those again.

Overall the experience was good and would reccomend."
Beautiful Art Deco Restaurant,"From the moment you step through the door you are greeted with respect and kindness. The staff are friendly as well as being very professional.
My husband and I ate here twice. Once for lunch when we had a superb lobster roll and pink champagne. We also had an evening meal with friends who had not been here before. They thorougly enjoyed it too. For evening meal we all had the set menu, which was really well paired and tasted lovely. It is also very good value for money, especially considering you are in Singapore. In the evening you also get a pianist and singer who does song requests. The art deco interior feels very opulent but at the same time very relaxing. Its a real shame this restaurant is not in London, as we would be visiting all the time!"
"good food, good service",good food in safe distance restaurant. we appreciated a good overall quality lunch during these challenging times
Excellent ambience and service,"Visited this place with my family for lunch. Affordable set lunch with cosy and relaxing ambience. I would like to specially thank the staff Stephy, Femi and Selan for their attentive service. We will definitely come back again."
Excellent service,"Excellent service, nice coconut ice cream , live piano and singing, fabulous restaurant, really deserve it!"
A beautiful 50th Birthday Dinner at Clifford Pier,"I chose to have my 50th Birthday dinner at Clifford Pier and I couldn't have asked for better food or service. We were so well looked after. We got to preview the NYE drone display as we were there the night before New Years, and I was even given a special little birthday cake which my 10yr old niece helped me eat. Would totally recommend this place to anyone, and I will surely be back again when I'm next in SIngapore."
Enjoy the terrace views at night,"Went for a very late supper mid Feb.
The restaurant was empty apart from two tables (it looked deserted ...). And it was SOO COOOLD inside!
Note to restaurant: it's no longer fashionable or necessary to so severly cool down particularly huge rooms like the main dining hall. Normal 23°C at floor level would make people feel more comfortable inside, particularly when there are few visitors who don't heat up the place that badly.

We went for the terrace (with bar seating at low tables) to escape the empty cold inside, although the architecture and overall presentation of the restaurant is very very nice!
The staff was very accommodating offering a slightly larger than average table to dine at. The drinks were brought swiftly (we were nearly the only guests) as were the good portions of pasta we had ordered. My husband had the crab spaghetti, I had the vongole - both were nice.

We were looked after by very kind staff.

The only negative thing was the very loud music on the terrace - normal for a bar, too loud for dinner, particularly as I had asked them to turn it down a tad. They eventually did, but only slightly so around the time when we left - too late for a comfortable dining session, unless maybe they wanted us out.

Go for drinks, go for wonderful views and good dishes. Also, take a jacket and a good pullover for inside seating."
"Beautiful ambience, pretty good food","We had the Heritage Dim Sum Brunch on a Sunday. The food was mostly ok with a few standout dishes (fried dark radish cake, ginger rice and kueh pai tee), but the lovely atmosphere made it a special experience. Special thanks to Christopher Chia from the F&B team for his attentive service! Would visit again."
DISAPPOINTED AND NO EMPATHY AT ALL.,"We are supposed to have our Wedding dinner at Clifford piers restaurant on 10 January 2020 for dinner.
We have made a deposit of 50 % payment for the dinner.

Two day before our wedding has unexpected circumstances occured that we have to postpone this wedding dinner date.

Yugen, guest relation executive, show no empathy on making any alternative to change dates nor even offer to offset for a dinner for 2 that was already paid.

We still feel he should provide an option instead of forfeited our hard earned money.

To feedback to share with this is the way to cheat our hard earn money with no flexibility of choices for married couple.

We regretted choosing Clifford prier restaurant.

Terrible and cold blooded service catered.

Regard
Mr and Mrs Sandras"
Walk in new year day 2020,"Staying at The Fullerton, we decided to walk around the river edge. Customs House was lit up, so there we headed. It was 8pm, so we decided to eat somewhere. We walked past a number of restaurants, but walked into Clifford pier in Customs House. Buffett for $ SG 88 per person. The experience and quality was great. We had the champagne free flowing, but at a cost. Initially we thought it was part of meal, but when the bill came, the surprise was realized. We had a great night, good quality, good service with a smile."
Disappointing service and food despite beautiful dining room,"The start and end highlight was the beautiful room - one reason I chose to book for dinner on my birthday.
Nothing went as expected for a restaurant associated with a hotel of this stature. Initially no reservation was found, so I had to pull out the phone for the confirmation e-mail. Then, despite being on time at 6:30, I (and other patrons) had to sit and wait for a table. I was given a menu with special fish dishes, that was not what I expected from a vague memory of checking the online menu. I seriously thought about leaving but I’d had a long walk to get there, so decided to stay and be adventurous and try the set menu. But the Japanese-inspired seafood was not good. Eventually, I had to request a drinks menu because none was provided when I was seated: I can’t fathom why.
Over halfway through my meal, a group of men sat nearby and refused the menu I was given and requested a menu on a sheet of paper. Checked on my phone and, yes, this was what I seen online and liked the look of. I was staggered. Why would a restaurant not provide customers with all menu options at the outset? Staff then said they’d bring me the other menu, but by then it was too late. On top of that, it took so long to bring the dessert that I left and paid up fully before it arrived, just so I could get out of the place. Staff said I could speak to the manager, but unfortunately he was not in the floor ( never a good sign), and I was too upset by then with having my evening spoiled. I’d be disappointed with this level of service in a Pizza Hut. For this establishment, it was unforgivable."
Well chosen for celebrating the New Year’s Eve,"We spent New Year’s Eve evening here.
Accompanied by our 7 and 10yo kids and a couple of friends, we have chosen it before arriving and sort-of reluctantly, on the account of location, hoping for a front seat to the fireworks. I started by being very reserved about it when I’ve arrived as it looked way too big of an event to feel well and cared for. I was wrong. The service provided by Princess was absolutely excellent. The food choice was really lavish, from Beluga caviar ry good quality to roasted Wagyu, going through all the three varieties traditionally featured on Singapore buffets: Chinese, Indian and Malay. A separate sea food and a separate grilled meat buffets would complete the feast. The free flowing champagne was Veuve Clicquot and although the free flow wine was nothing to write home about, the list to chose a paying one was rich and well priced. The DJ on the terrace where one would spend most of the time watching the unique fireworks and the fantastic view of Marina Bay Sands and the impressive over the water view of the financial district skyscrapers was very inspired and the atmosphere joyful and festive. It proved to be a very inspired choice!"
Very Enjoyable Evening,"Good food, great service, excellent entertainment and wonderful atmosphere. Restaurant provides interesting choices of impossible beef in Asian flavors. Its salted egg yoke chicken wings should not be missed."
A nice high tea let down by poor service,"We enjoyed our high tea at Clifford Pier Restaurant on 30 December under the stunning arched ceiling and in the ambience of the 1920s-style furnishings. The food and the teas were high standard – particularly the savouries - and plentiful. Where our experience was let down though, as others have commented, was the service. No criticism of individual staff who were polite and hard working. There just did not appear to be any organisation or system for serving tables, no staff were assigned to a particular group of tables to ensure they were well looked after. Rather, it seemed, all the staff were serving all tables which did not allow for consistent communication with staff or consistent service.
We were one of the first groups to be seated but watched as other groups came in and were served drinks and food well ahead of us. We began to feel invisible as staff hurried past us too fast to engage in eye contact. When we were served, as promised, the food and beverages were replenished upon request. But there were some long delays so that we had to sometimes make repeated requests for the same thing.
This is really not acceptable for a luxury hotel and high class restaurant but should be easily rectifiable with some changes in process and staff responsibilities."
Just The Best In So Many Ways,We found the Clifford Pier by accident while walking around Marina Bay. Sitting down having drinks outside while enjoying one of the best views in Singapore already was amazing but then to have our drink specialist Celine walk us through their amazing menu of Gin drinks was just a joy. I can not recommend this place enough.
Excellent service and cosy environment,Really cosy and warm. I had an wonderful evening. Excellent service from Kui Taah! Great pumpkin soup!
excellent place for weekend brunch,"Staff is the best I have ever experienced. Thank to Selan & Rachel who did all their best to accommodate all our needs! My 3 year old had fun interacting with Selan and Rachel brought my boy some toys to keep him entertained. THANK YOU SO MUCH!

On top of that, the music, ambience, view, service and food are all wonderful.

Atmosphere is relaxing and that's the reason that make us return to this place every few weeks. A great place to spend your weekend as it is spacious and child friendly."
Excellent for a fancy night out,"The music, ambience, view, service, and food were all wonderful. My fiancee had the fixed 4 course meal and I ordered from the menu. It was all excellent and our server Samuel was very attentive.

A sign of great service: my fiancee was cold and ordered tea. The server came back with the tea, and a lovely shawl for her to wear!

Definitely recommend for a date or just dinner with a good view and some music."
Unbelievably slow service,"It took over an hour to get the main course. Can’t even blame the totally overwhelmed staff because they seem to be inadequately trained to work in a restaurant this size and simply understaffed.
This was my second but definitely last visit."
Terrible service,"This is my fifth time to the Heritage Tea; I have returned and recommended Clifford Pier due to the good food and service. However, after today, I will no longer make this recommendation. Today was ridiculous and I’m even more upset as I had my niece from USA visiting. A woman named “Princess” was out initial server. At 4pm, she dropped off a card asking for a TripAdvisor review and we never saw her again; by the way, so rude asking for a review and especially 30min in to our afternoon. After she left, it was impossible to get any assistance (see attached picture...no staff in sight...woman taking man’s photo was his friend) and what staff there were ran around clueless. Anyway, I expect better from Clifford Pier."
Overpriced buffet restaurant,"The buffet was nice, but even if the restaurant was more or less empty the service was poor. The best part was looking at the Marina Bay Sands light show.... Nice drinks!"
Memorable Birthday High Tea,"I would like to commend the staff at Clifford Pier for the excellent service, especially Samuel. He made us feel right at home and we had a great time celebrating my mother-in-law’s birthday. The High Tea Buffett was excellent, highly recommend the Pomme Prestige which is an apple infused ice tea."
Elegant Setting for Dinner,"The Clifford Pier is a wonderful place for a relaxed meal in an elegant setting. The dinning room has soaring elevated ceilings that add gravitas to the setting, but the beautiful furnishings provide a warm and welcoming feel. The service is quite good and the menu provides a good balance of both traditional and more modern Singaporean cuisine. Besides the many choices on the menu, there was a fixed price menu on offer as well. Everything we tried was excellent, well prepared and tasty. We especially appreciated the jazz singer combo that performed during dinner, which added to the overall experience. We hope to return the next trip to Singapore."
"Excellent service, food and ambience!!!","I have indicated that it was our anniversary when I was doing the reservation and they brought us a slice of cake with ‘happy anniversary’!
One of the staff even asked if we would like her to take a picture for us. That’s really sweet of her !
Food is good especially the porridge where you can choose fish, pork, clam or crab meat. We will definitely visit Clifford pier again!!!"
"Great ambience, let down by choice of music","Had the set dinner, and the food was great. The decor was very good, and the antique maps, hung gallery style, made it look like a museum as opposed to a run-of-the-mill restaurant. There was live music, which was a nice touch. Unfortunately, I requested for Etta James' ""At Last"", but the singer did not perform it. The most lacklustre element for me was the choice of recorded music played in between sets. It was some contemporary music you can hear on the radio stations targeting those below 20 years old. Given that Clifford Pier started operating in the 1930s, and the decor reflected its history, the choice of music fell short. The experience would have been better if they played Cole Porter's tunes or even Sinatra's music from the Columbia and Capitol years. My expectations are not as high as Ryuichi Sakamoto; just wishing for period-correct music."
Dim Sum Brunch for birthday,Excellent service from start to finish from our waiter Daniel. Really good choice of food and plenty of it. Room is stunning and we really enjoyed our afternoon.
Thanks for the wonderful experience and memory,Lovely memorable dock reestablished as an eatery . The doughnut pontoons are charming yet magnificent looking. It merited the ride.
Beautiful ambiance and decor,"Had lunch at the Clifford Pier. We ordered the crispy calamari and heritage bites for appetizer. Lunch was lobster roll, steak and frites, laksa, and burger. For dessert, we got pulut hitam, tropical fruits, and ice cream. The food was average overall. We barely ate the heritage bits and the calamari was not good. I filled up on the dessert. The ambiance is absolutely amazing! Loved the decor but the food can be improved. Service was really good as well.

Apparently, there is a fixed lunch menu which the waiter did not share with us. Bummer! :-("
did not eat here but it was beautiful and historic!,"Merdeka age will recall this area fondly...taking vessel excursions to close by islands, school trip visits... Clifford Pier."
Very Average experience for the price,"We'd been looking forward to dining here on a recommendation, the space is vast and lovely, the service is narrow and indifferent, the food, meh, You don't come here for the *best* version of anything...

We were utterly disappointed in the service, we were seated, told someone would be with us, then they just left us sitting there. All the staff were continually averting eye contact - we had to physically get up out of our chairs to chase staff down for more tea, any dim sum (we were there at around 1pm and it felt like we were just left with the 'scraps' of what was left, the dumplings over steamed and falling apart - absolutely not worth the money. But that said, if you have lots of cash and an undiscerning palate, then come for the space and floral arrangements... but don't expect much else."
Average,"Service was good, if you manage to get the attention of the staff. They were super understaffed for what was a large venue and it was difficult to get hold of their attention (we were waving for quite a while just to get the bill and eventually walked up to the counter to pay as no one came). Food was below average (some items came cold and soggy) and definitely not what one would expect at those prices and at a top tier hotel. The place is very nicely furnished with a quiet, relaxed atmosphere."
Stunning venue!,We had a work event here - gorgeous venue with stunning views. Great food and drinks - very opulent surroundings - worth a look
Amazing food and service!,"We came to this restaurant on the first day of F1 week. Food was amazingly good. We order chicken rice and nasi goreng which fill us up perfectly. Ambience of the restaurant is so beautiful. Shye took care of us very well and was very informative, he is definitely an asset to your establishment. Will definitely come back for dinner again."
Nearly wonderful,"A special occasion farewell dinner in a lovely room. The food was excellent. The service was very good , except when they were absent or hard to find. Was a little surprised that in such fine surroundings we were made to reuse the cutlery from our entrees again for the main course."
High Tea,Food and Ambiance is excellent. highly recommended to guests. Will visit again mext time. Thank you.
Lovely evening,Were looking to spend the a nice final night in Singapore and stumbled upon this restaurant. Lovely place with very nice ambience and excellent food!! We had the ribs and chicken rice which were both great. Service was also very good - a special thanks to Samuel. There was also some nice live music. Would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to have a nice relaxing meal.
Amazing high tea experience!,"An exceptional experience having the most delicious high tea buffet experience at Fullerton Bay Hotel. The photos don't do it justice as being there in person just makes it better. We were welcomed with great service by the staff members who were always ready to help and served with a smile. A great variety of local delights cooked in real time as you watched the magic happen along with the amazing live band duo that added to that afternoon delight experience. A special shout out to Selan, who was the ""teh tarik guru"" who exchanged fun and interesting conversations about how the delicious beverage was made! Overall, it was such a great first experience!"
Birthday Celebration,Thank you Femie and the team for making the occasion such a special one. Great setting and food was of a high standard as always!
Amazing experience at Clifford Pier with Mr Allan Phon,We had a amazing dinning experience at Clifford pier and we are thankful to Mr Allan Phon for his kindness and assistance throughout the night. Mr Allan’s recommendation of the food and drinks clearly shown us how much he pay attention to our conversation. Mr Allan Surprises ya with a birthday cake! We will like to thank him for his amazing service given to us. We will surely be back in the coming weeks. Thank you Allan.
Amazing venue and un-rushed high tea,"We booked to attend the weekend (Sat and Sun) high tea from 3:30 pm until 6 pm. Finding the Clifftom Pier venue proved a journey given that it is part of the Fullerton Hotel complex and you have to wander a good 400 m (underground from the basement of the Fullerton Hotel) if you arrive thinking it is in the Fullerton Hotel main building. Once there you just admire the amazing Cliffton Pier building and the vista it provides.
When we arrived it was about a 60% capacity and remained that way for most of the 2+ hours we stayed. On arrival we were taken to our table and told 'go and try the buffet and your drinks orders will be taken soon'. We weren't expecting the buffet of various asian styled dishes, but made the most of it; it made it more of a late lunch afternoon tea combo. We didn't need dinner that night after were strolled out at 17:45.
Eventually orders for tea and coffee (the start of a never ending supply) were taken but it took a while to get the attending staff attention.
After about an hour (all very enjoyable) our high tea cakes arrived and a special (but limited) set for our gluten free companion. The buffet availability stayed until about 5:30 pm when sated people started waddling out.
There was not even the minimum sense of rush during our stay. Whether that was because it was the style of the event or just that they were understaffed by a factor of 2 or more; a bit of both maybe. It became common for diners to either wave, stand up or chase the scurrying staff to get something for their table, like the small spoons to eat some desserts in glasses or just clean cutlery after the dirty plates had been taken away. Water for the table had to be requested and took a a while, which was the opposite if you ordered a tea of coffee as that arrived very quickly; this was not an uncommon experience in our Singapore stay. Quirky and patchy service is to a certain extent common in Singapore, but not what I would have expected from a venue at a higher tier hotel.
But the venue was beautiful and the view it had of Marina Bay and the central business area. The outside square was also a good location to what the Marina Bay light show in the evening, which we returned for.
As to value it was very very good value, and we would recommend it for for a visitor on the weekend, just go with the sloooow."
Wonderful night,Much recommended highlight in a beautiful setting by the bay. Great food and ambience. Service fantastic. Thanks very much Princess and all team members including the lovely person who took our booking. Would highly recommend for special night out.
Magnificent bayside setting,"Stunning decor in a beautifully restored Singapore landmark. Lovely lunch and dinner options, pictured are the lobster roll with truffle fries and the Wagyu Beef Rendang curry. Recommend booking to ensure you get a table at this Singapore icon. A Singapore must do."
Stunning Upmarket venue,"Singapore's iconic venue, spectacular decor, understated elegance, very plush surroundings, stunning backdrop, pity we're only in town for a very short stopover. Will book high teas for next time, looks to be delectable. I have gait/walking challenges (stroke), all sightseeing has to be well-researched and not overly taxing; I wear a legbrace. Outside Clifford Pier straight on Marina Bay waterfront, an olde-worlde trishaw is on display - very cool. Across the bay is Marina Bay Sands hotel, music & light show at night (check the show-times). Look forward to being in Singapore again soon."
Food with a view,"Ate here on an evening after walking around the Marina area, as it was warm evening we wanted somewhere to sit outside & soak up the atmosphere – we were not disappointed here, additionally there was a female singer preforming inside which all added to the ambiance – between us we enjoyed a Chicken Caesar salad & the Chicken Prata washed down with a couple of drinks – great location & a good place to eat – Recommended"
Crab-ilicious Dinner,"Sweet, tangy crabmeat topped up with rice noodles, truly flavourful & worth every calorie!
Gunaselan has been most hospitable, checking in on us throughout the dinner, making sure we are well taken care of.
Kudos to the team at Clifford Pier for a delightful dinner date"
Dinner @ The Clifford Pier,Was at The Clifford Pier for Dinner. I had the Impossible Burger my hubby had the Beef Burger. The Asst Banquet Manager Gunaselan Jaykumaran introduced the house signature Gin Tonic ~ London Mandarin. Citrus and fruity flavour added freshness and we completed our meal with Key Lime Pie dessert. A nice evening with Singers and good ambience.
Wonderful business team dinner!,"Food quality was excellent and presented very timely and professionally. The setting in a grand hall and ample spacing between tables gave sense of luxury. A piano player and singer took requests and was fantastic throughout the night! Our host was Gunaselan Jaykumran, Assistant Banquet Manager was professional and courteous. Will come back soon!"
Average Food Average Service,Went there for a lunch appointment.The service was irritating as while we were having our conversation the waiter would come back every 2 minutes to ask our order..Customers will order when they are ready to. After we placed our order the Satay arrived and was very dry and hard. The nasi goreng was no better and once again the same waiter was hovering around us to get our dessert order. Bad lunch.
Classy and sexy. SAMUEL is the star of Clifford .,Love everything about this restaurant . From the ambience to the service and of course the foods . It’s excellent and delicious .. pls try their Hainanese Chicken rice and pulut hitam . You will like it. It is “ truly Singapore taste “ . Thank you SAMUEL for you taking care of us . The service is meticulous. I will definitely come back to try your nasi goreng and beef rendang
Gd place for gathering,"Gd idea to have the savoury food in buffet style, sweets were normal, only kong ba bao, prata and the prawns were the better tasting ones. Service was slow."
Special Peranakan Menu,"I took my wife for her belated birthday treat.

We came here planning to try their lobster roll and prawn laksa, and instead we opted for the special Peranakan menu under their "" Best of Peranakan Cuisine by Chef Philip Chia"" , which is only available from 1-12 July.

It was the right choice as the 3 dishes we ordered were impressive, and they tasted better than those I tried recently at another new Peranakan restaurant.

The Ikan Chuan-Chuan is a fried whole snapper, that has been carefully filleted, and the presentation was classy and for the very instagrammable.

The Grilled Lobster, with Peranakan style fried rice was simply delightful, with with deep complex flavours.

The Chendol Dome tis an innovative deconstruction of the traditional chendol desert with gula melaka sponge cake, pandan-scented chendol, juicy red beans paste, paired with a scoop of red bean ice cream.

The service team very thoughtfully prepared a slice of rainbow cake as a birthday treat for my wife.

Well done! We will be back for that Lobster roll and prawn laksa."
Great high-tea experience!,"The food is great with a local themed cuisine buffet. This is matched with an interesting selection of artisanal tea.
The ambience is on point with a view of the Marina Bay area. This, coupled with live music from a great singer makes the entire high-tea session really memorable.
Our server, Selaw, topped off our wonderful experience with superb service during our time here.
10/10 would recommend."
Birthday,"Went to Clifford Pier for the heritage high tea for my wife's birthday and we weren't disappointed,the service was second to none with a good range of teas to try with the continued replacement of the saveory and sweet made for a totally relaxing afternoon , with wonderful surrounds and a great view of the Marina Bay Sands hotel"
Lunch Hour,Went there with a good buddy. The mutton soup was awesome. We sat outdoors and the feel was good. Besides that they have a good menu of local dishes but my laksa wasn’t that much to my preference. The gravy was kind of a blend. Not too sure about the other dishes.
Average for the food - Excellence for the service & atmosphere,"Had gathering with friends, select this place as recommended.
Service staff - very good
Love the live entertainment and the atmosphere.
Food - average review for the food.
We had mixture food from the Peranakan promotion & a la carte menu. Some were good and some missed the mark.
Good review on food: Heritage Bites were good so as their Classic fish and chips. We all loved the special fried rice but the texture of the lobster was bit mushy as it is not fresh enough. Dessert go for their Banana fritters. We did not like the deep fried snapper as we felt that the sauce does not compliment the fish. It was lacking something or maybe not to our taste palette. I loved the red bean ice cream from the Chendol Dome.
Some traditional should remain as it is instead of modern twists.
We will come back again but maybe this time taking food from the a la carte menu instead."
Dining in grandeur,"Fabulous tasting menu from Giovanni, perfectly paired with Mersault white and Bordeaux red, ending with a signature Negroni cocktail and Cuban cigar in the patio overlooking Clifford pier and enjoying the fireworks."
Excellent dinner,Clifford Pier is a stunningly beautiful restaurant and an excellent place to take your date. It is blessed to be staffed by attentive and friendly service staff who really make the evening enjoyable. Special mention to Samuel and Selan - thank you! The food is reasonably tasty as well - try the lobster roll
Excellent choice for High-tea,"An old wharf converted into a most beautiful dining place as an annex of the Fullerton Bay Hotel. It has a beautiful view of Mariner Sand with its boat like roof top. We had High-tea at $55++ per person. The selection of food and beverages was generally good, although we would have preferred a bigger variety of Nonya desserts. High tea ends at 4.30pm. Initially we were well served by staff but for some strange reason, only a skeleton staff was left after 3.30 pm. It was hard to get their attention for drinks or top up tea. At one stage, I had to go up to the front where 2 guys were standing to ask for service. It was a disappointing end just as we thought the service was great and attentive. I wanted to comment on the absence of service towards the latter half but could not locate the supervisor. I found only the reception staff at the front. A disappointing end to an otherwise pleasant afternoon."
Thanks,Good service and good ambiance. Good selection of local favours. Good location and lots of photo opportunities.
Dinner,We had drinks outside next ti the Marina Bay before moving inside the restaurant to have dinner. We watched the light show at the Marina Bay Sands on the other side of the bank. The Fullerton Hotel is grand with chandeliers and beautiful floral decor. We ordered a spicy crab meat spaghetti and a linguine with clams. Both were not disappointing. There was also live music with a singer at the Clifford Per too. We had an enjoyable evening.
"Poor service, average food quality","Visited this restaurant for the heritage high tea at Friday 3:30 pm. Service was slow and it took them 40 minutes (and it took me 3 reminders to the manager) to serve the food even though the crowd was moderate. The manager apologised but to be honest, at that point I couldn't care less any more. The food was average and not really worth the price. Standard Chartered Bank VISA Infinite card was supposed to give a 33% discount for a group of 4, but the manager was very confused and flip-flopped between ""no, there's no discount"", to ""15% discount"". Payment took 30 minutes because they screwed up something (and they brought me someone else's credit card and bill!). This will be the last time I visit this place and I really advise NOT to try this. One of the worst experience I've had in any restaurant."
Good local nosh in a posh setting but wait for the host to end his phone call to be seated.,"Short of sounding like a schmuck, this place is what it is. It's pointless to whinge about the prices with the ambiance you enjoy whilst savouring the few miserly portions of well-executed local delights.

Sure, you'll be greeted with a professional air of nonchalance and lament the stark contrast of filling in your lobster roll after drooling over images of it, stuffed like a puffer fish, on their promotional images on TA and chope.

Still, they serve up an elegant serving of beef rendang, juicy, tender and delicious thanks to a robust rempah.

I've enjoyed a few very civilised lunches here in comfort and with a lovely view of the fullerton bay. I know that I'm always assured of that, some decent nosh and a consistently aloof reception at the entrance.

Oh yes, it always amuses me to see how the hosts or hostesses are always busy on the phone when they ought to be receiving diners with undivided attention.

Perhaps it's all a ploy to have you soak up the ambiance whilst you wait to be seated, even with a reservation."
Lovely looking hardware which lacks the human touch,"The best thing about Clifford Pier is the impressive lobby entrance as one walks towards the restaurant. Gleaming marble floor and glistening chandelier; one feels transported to a world of elegance and charm. However charm is not what I would describe the service nor food at The Clifford Pier. Staff exude neither warmth nor efficiency. And the food would be rated average; but given the prices one has to pay; below par should be the assessment.

A place to go if one wanted to make an impression with the view; but not for the food nor the service."
Afternoon tea with friends,"Lovely ambience, good variety buffet and service. We had an enjoyable afternoon and will go back again for lunch!"
Such a contrast,"I chose this restaurant to take a foreign guest who is staying just across the road for its ambiance and innovative take on local food. I was still apprehensive as the reviews were mixed.

The ambiance didn't fail to impress. It was grand, with a good view and even a live performance, which was enjoyed. Service was impeccable, maybe a little enthusiastic and that is a good thing.

The food, while well plated, was however disappointing in taste. The satay was dry , the spicy prawn was more salty than spicy and wagyu beef rendang was below par.

So come for the view, maybe over drinks and snacks."
Bland food,"Hostess asked us to wait for 10 minutes despite place being empty. We were not informed after 10 mins and we had to go back and ask for availability. Food was bland, avoid ordering spicy crab meat lump pasta. The only saving grace was the ambience."
Lovely food and ambience.,"We happened upon this restaurant by chance during a stopover visit to Singapore and decided to have a meal there, based initially on the availability of vegan options as well as a good choice of meat/fish dishes.

The restaurant’s decor is delightful and it is in a great location. The live music was very good, and I gather that many people make return visits just for this! The food was excellent and the service was very good, too: we were served by Maga, who was very polite and efficient. We would also particularly like to mention Nisha from ‘front of house’ who was helpful, friendly and very professional.

Highly recommended."
Bank Centennial Celebration,"I am Lorraine Cher from Singapore. My company had made the right choice to choose The Fullerton Bay Hotel for the centennial celebration recently. Prior to the date of the event, my colleagues and I went down and was warmly served by the front office staff, Ms Rhea Decolongon who was very professional and dedicated in her job. She assured us that the hotel had made all the necessary arrangements for the prestigious event and also would take good care of our VVIPs from our HongKong Office who would be staying in the hotel. Everything went on smoothly and all the invited guests were very happy with the beautiful ambience at the banquet hall. They were also very pleased with the delicious buffet food which were fresh and kept warm throughout the dinner. Special thanks to Ms Rhea Decolongon and also the staff at the event hall who were very professional , cheerful and polite in attending to the various needs of the guests.

I would like to thank The Fullerton Bay Hotel for their more than 5 stars service in making a success of our centennial celebration. We will certainly recommend to hold our next important event here . Thank you once again for the excellent service rendered.

Best vegan burger ever,I had dinner there with a bunch of colleagues. Nice atmosfere and great cocktails. However what was completely outstanding was the vegan burger they had on the menu. I never tasted such a delicious vegan burger in my life.
Dinner,Had a birthday dinner there. Nice rainbow cake. Batter of the fish n chips are a little thick but the fries are fabulous. Tiramisu is a little disappointing. Ambience is fantastic and good for chit chat with great singer and pianist. A little persistent selling of the gin tonic but overall good night chill out with friend and will visit again.
Great place and fantastic service,"What more can I say, the service crew are excellent. Very attentive and always with a smile. Nothing seems too difficult for them to do for diners. Nisha, Isabelle, princesses were amongst those who were waiting my table. Fantastic service. Food was good. The ambience is really comfortable and cozy. The view of the marina bay is just awesome."
Norm,"Kinda disappointed as Lobster roll sold out during dinner time and the servers look pretty newbie.
An encounter with a female server whom lay side dish out and my phone was in the way, she utter nth but look at me expecting me to shift my phone aside. I wouldn’t say the quality of service is great but overall, it was a comfortable dining."
Beautiful Sunday Dim Sum Brunch,"We stumbled across this beautiful building by mistake and made a booking for the next days Sunday Dim Sum Brunch 11am - 2pm.

It was a beautiful experience, the food was fresh, plentiful and so much variety. $55 for unlimited dim sum and you can add $69 for free flow French Champagne 3 hours which never stopped being topped up.

The staff are amazing and our amazing waiter Dankesh made our experience perfect. Including a honeymoon rainbow layer cake that was stunning. He is a wonderful man and employee and I always say a business is only as good as it’s staff.

I highly recommend this for a weekend brunch experience that Singapore does so well. Made the start of our trip memorable and an experience I recommend for anyone to enjoy."
Beautiful building,We had lunch at Clifford Pier which is part of the Fullerton Bay Hotel. The building is old world and absolutely beautiful. The food is casual fair and lacks a little but it’s worth a visit for the view and the building.
No the Clifford im used to.,It's a beautiful setting in a superb hotel but our dinner was disappointing. Most dishes arrived at our table cold and the service was very slow. Not the Clifford experience I am used to. In the past its been fantastic!
great for a networking even,I experienced the beauty and architecture here through a networking event which the place is well suited for outside space for bbq and indoors for the wine and chatting great place to find and lose people great venue
Clifford Pier,"The service and ambience in Clifford Pier was really great. However, we felt that the food is below expectation."
Beautiful restaurant good food.,"The interior is lovely. A taste of a bygone Era with a modern twist.
We had the Chinese new year banquet which included a couple of unusual items, baby octopus and jellyfish. The latter was little odd! The rest of the food was excellent and plentiful.
Service was initially a little slow but improved as the restaurant became quieter.
Relatively pricey but worth a visit."
