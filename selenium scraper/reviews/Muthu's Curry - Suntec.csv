A real curry,"Fantastic, I’d forgotten how bland our uk curry houses make the food. This packed a real punch. Chicken tikka masala was delicious as was the Aloo Gobi. Fresh coconut milk for my drink. I will be going back."
Nice Indian cuisine,"Had some time to spare following a business meeting and waiting to do the ‘three rounds’ on the Fountain of Wealth opposite.

Nice restaurant with a free flow of popadoms. Chose a couple of kebabs and rice between two. Good flavour and although we were there for almost two hours there was no hurry to leave from the staff - restaurant not too busy as many of Suntec staffers still working from home. Nice place for lunch. Not overly expensive."
Good restaurant,Authentic Indian restaurant with good food. appreciate that they have tender coconut as well. will visit again.
Much hyped regarding authenticity - but eating their food here in Suntec tells you otherwise.,"Maybe once the ( apparently earnest & maybe excellent) cooking at Muthu’s was the real deal— alas no longer.
The re-cooked tandour chicken ( quite expensive $14++) was mostly dry & barely warm....the Black Daal weak in flavor & not ‘rich’ as it should be & therefore just so-so...
Better was the Palau Paneer & curiously the finely achieved Curry Mutton quite lovely.
Part self service, the operation here isn’t a particular nice experience & certainly isn’t worth the money.
Forget it."
Eeks - - $3 per customer for rice,"Each person is charged $3 for white rice (or $4 for biryani). That makes this place really pricey -- most places charge $1 a bowl or $3 for one large pot to share among everybody.

One dish and one rice per person is $20 / head -- which is a little too pricey for an everyday meal. Food was good -- fish curry had 2 pieces of fish, and chicken curry had a nice charcoaled flavor.

You will definitely leave full because of the free-flow of rice. I don't like carb overload, but you won't starve.

I would maybe take out-of-town guests here, I think most locals would feel ripped off. (I heard another table also questioning this rice policy)."
Standard Has Dropped,"Came here for dinner and had the fish head curry. The curry was a let down for us, not spicy at all, they used to be spicy. Only good things they having going is the free flow of papaddum which many places have stop and the service standard is still good. Also free flow of rice and a one serve of complimentary cabbage and brinjal"
"Casual restaurant, tasty vegetarian","We arrived at this restaurant as walk ins while traversing the Suntec building. We had no prior knowledge but high hopes, and it did not disappoint. It’s a large dining area with warm woody decor. The naan is light and crispy. our spicy potatoe cubes and Paneer in Butter sauce were delicious. Prices are reasonable and we would definitely return in future when we are in Singapore. Good casual Indian food."
It is what it is,Basically it’s a quick Indian delivered with dispatch and not too bells and whistles. A mutter paneer and vindaloo were fine for a quick lunch.
One of my all-time favourite,"Muthus Curry is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore for Indian Cuisine. Recently, the egg fried rice became my favourite. Their Mutton Vindaloo and Aloo paratha are my personal favourites. Biryani is quite similar to other restaurants. Aloo paratha is so thin and mildly spicy, mutton fry is also very yummy and not overly spicy. Kebabs are nice but I find it dry. Chicken fry and curry are subtle and never hard on stomach. I strongly recommend this restaurant for Indian non vegetarian cuisine lovers."
Authentic South Indian food,"We ordered the fish masala, chicken chettinadu and tandoori rotis. Every gravy had a different taste which is great! Free flow of pappadum and water to drink which was a plus. Our fav go to place for South Indian delicacies when in Suntec City!
The picture is proof- we remembered to click only once we finished the scrumptious meal!"
Good food,"Comfortable seating, good ambience, good food with free flow papadum and water (self service).

Ordered briyani rice ($4), white rice($3), butter chicken ($13), small curry fish head ($22) and garlic naan ($4).

The rice is free flow and comes with small side dish of eggplant and cabbage.

Butter chicken is really good!
Curry fish head is their award winning dish, it’s sour and bit of spiciness. A small curry fish head is good for 3 pax."
Good curry and great service,"Fish head curry was good, no complaints. Portions were decent sized. We ordered a small size and we couldn’t finish it! Chicken tikka masala was very good, would come back for that! We loved the garlic naan as well There is also free chips and self serve water. Also love that they are straw free! Servers are very friendly as well"

Good Indian Food at Suntec,We ordered vegetarian dishes which were well made. The Tandoori Rotis and Paratha were crisp and nice. The staff were very hospitable and warm.
Pleasant visit.,Staffs were considerate and relatively fast in service. Most of them were kind and that brings a good atmosphere.

GREAT FOOD!!,This was one of the best Indian cuisine experiences I have ever had the great pleasure of trying out!!
Curry for lunch,"Came here for lunch earlier in the month with some colleagues. We chose a mix of curries and added in some naan. I'd say the curries were nice enough and no real complaints, but not sufficiently good to warrant a 4 star review. Service was efficient. Pricing was ok - we paid about $100 for lunch for 4 of us."
Indian food,"Always love their fish head curry. They come with sizes, so don’t worry if you come solo or large group.
Very decent price and unique way to eat. You eat in a tray with banana leaf as the bottom. You need at least try once of their fish head curry if you are in Singapore."
Poor Customer Service,"We visited Muthus on Thursday 18th October. it was only 9pm and they said that it was last order, so we should hurry and order our drinks, starters and mains all at once. We placed our order and we were handed the bill, with our server telling us that they were closing early and thus we need to settle our bill straight away. There were still 2 other tables in the restaurant.
The staff/team cannot leave until we are done with our meal, so why the need to get us to pay even before we received our meal is baffling.

Given this incident, it ruined our dining experience.Food was good, other than the chicken vindaloo which tasted like a watered down bland chicken curry. Overall food quality rating: 8/10
Dining experience that evening: 2/10"
Great food and service,"Ordered Butter Chicken, Curry Mutton and Biryani Rice. All tasted so good we gobbled everything up in 10 min. The Curry Mutton was flavorful and spicy, meat was tender. Butter Chicken was sweet with thick gravy. Biryani Rice was so fragrant and serving was generous. Free flow of plain drinking water plus delicious crackers to go along with the curries. Service was friendly and welcoming. Will visit again."
A Gem of an restaurant,"What a great place for Indian at Suntec City. Open kitchen with fresh food. Very tasty and great value. Definitely going to come back. Also, you can eat as many papadoms that you can handle, for free!"
Lunch For Two,"Had an Eatigo 50% off for lunch for two. Muthu’s Curry remains our all time favorite Indian Curry Fish Head. The same taste and flavour, consistent over the years, in all their dishes. The fish is fresh n juicy, almost creamy and leaves a pleasant taste on your palette. Sambal king prawn is such a delight. Masala flower crab is unforgettable. And free flow of crispy popadum. A must-have meal for all in Singapore."
Good Indian food,We went to Muthu’s which has good Indian Veg as well as Non Veg options . Our friend really enjoyed the Non Veg items . The menu is pricey but worth the extra money as food is tasty . Aloo paratha was very good and they serve two veg small bowls when you order Rice. We ate there 3 times during our stay and loved the food.
Bad bad bad,Bad taste bad Service and will never bring my customer here again. Brought my chinese customer here for a indian meal. Looks like it was a very bad miatake. Taste was mediocure. I felt it was clean and service was ok. But still could do much better guys. Very different from their Race Course Road Main Branch!
Great Indian food in the mall,Don't expect mall food pricing but the food is great. A nice place to sit and eat good Indian food. The papad is free and you need to get it from a box kept near the water tray. The service is decent. Overall a good place to eat.
Went for the fish head curry - not disappointed,"When my wife and I visited Singapore two weeks ago we were determined to try a fish head curry.

Staying at the Conrad Centennial we quickly established that the nearby Muthu’s Suntec City was the place to go.

Suffice to say we were not disappointed. Excellent meal, with prompt and courteous service. Will definitely return when next in Singapore (and given the literally thousands of food outlets in Singapore that’s saying something)."
Doesn't disappoint!,"We are regulars at the main restaurant along Race Course Road but the outlet can be very noisy and crowded, and parking is a nightmare!

The Suntec branch in contrast is quiet and more dignified, catering mostly to family groups. Taste and pricing is the same at both outlets, but the advantage here is the ample parking (per entry after 5pm).

Service here is fast and efficient and the staff are as friendly and helpful as at Race Course. We loved the self-service water and pappadum counter which kept us well entertained!

Our order: Signature Fish Head Curry ($22 for small, $27 for medium), Butter Chicken ($13), Fish Cutlet ($2.50) Naan ($3 plain $4 garlic), Rice ($3 plain $4 biryani). Sufficient for our family of four and extremely delicious!"
Best Indian food,This restaurant is basically Indian food both veg and non - veg. Sufficient vareities and yummy food. Staff are friendly and professional. The orders are placed via iPad which is available in every table. It's always crowded. Prices are reasonable. Water and papad is self service. Papads are complimentary. Keep up the good work!!
Quick and nice business lunch,"We had a business lunch in this Indian restaurant located in Suntec City. We all took chicken Tikka Massala, tasty and quickly served. When UOB client you get a 10% discount on the bill (>30 SGD)"
Vegetarian Delight,"Had eaten at Muthu's Curry in Suntec City a few years ago. It was high time to give it another go. This time, tried a straightforward vegetarian dinner setup with Black Daal, Aaloo Mutter, and Biryani Rice (which included two vegetable dishes). Good on all points with just enough spice to add a spark to the evening. Also, must add a star for service, as all the waitstaff were smiling and attentive. This absolutely hit the spot. Cheers, Muthu's!"
Value for 'time'!,"The problem with big shopping malls is that you need a quick bite and a brief moment to recoup at a decent price. All these aspects are satisfied by this restaurant in Suntec city. There is a popular choice of Indian food here. More importantly, it is delivered to your table much earlier than you expect. If you order some mocktails or soft drinks, that also comes quick. The dishes are well prepared, nothing extraordinary but well palatable. Also , there is free supply of pappadam , but the rider is that you have to go & fetch it yourself. The ambience is below average but the restaurant is clean. The pricing is a bit more than the foodcourts, but easy on the wallet specially when you are shopping at Suntec city."
Good for a quick lunch break,Quick business lunch. We had mainly chicken in different styles with rice. Good quality and light. I miss this kind of offer in Italy
Delicious but not cheap,"Our first visit here and was not disappointed with the food. Ordered Butter Chicken, which was very rich and yummy, and Fish Head Curry, which was slightly fishy and tad spicy. Food tasted good but was very thirsty the whole night after that"
Good old Japanese curry bowl,Great for family meal. Curry bowl platter is good to share for 3-4 with additional portion of rice. Recommend the chicken karaage for sides.
Awesome food,"So when we were in Singapore and looking for some Indian outlets to fulfill our craving, we came across Muthus Curry Suntec plaza..Food is yummy, you can order here via Ipad provided at each table. Glass of water & Papdams are self service. Very nice staff who speak good English and Tamil. The restaurant is always in demand..we made a visit almost thrice during our fortnight stay but never found it empty. Food is very tasty, and quantity is sufficent enough. It has both vegetarian & non-vegetarian options. A must try for everyone who is missing Indian food. Kudos to the staff & their good work!"
Indian food served overseas with same taste!,"The restaurant offers good Sound Indian food with authentic Indian taste and spices. The food is served on the dinner table by the attendants while water and salads/papad are self-service based. The style of serving the food with traditional banana leaves in the plate adds to the flavours.

Must try items (Non-Veg):
Chicken Chettinad
Butter chicken
Chicken Tikka
Dum Biryani (Chicken)

Must try items (Veg):
Dal Makhani/Black Daal
Butter Paneer
Garlic Naan.

The ambience and the location of the restaurant is a big plus. Try occupying the outdoor seats to enjoy the view of the Fountain of Wealth."
Southern Indian with homage to the North,"Most Indian eateries in SE Asia tend to be Southern Indian. With the influx of people from the North of India, cuisines have changed to accommodate a wider variety.
Muthu Curry caters to this in a clean, organised business lunch setting with aplomb and efficiency without sacrificing taste and flavour.
Fish head curry was great, fish cakes could do with a little more texture a touch dry), biryani rice was typically southern without any fruits, palak paneer was ok without being spectacular, and most of the other curries were honest and satisfactory.
There is the usual tandoori oven and rotis. For a business lunch out offers a great place to entertain without being disappointed."
Over hyped 😐 ignorant arrogant staff,"More of a self service restaurant
Attendant was not welcoming help your self to your seat , comes n leaves a tab to order food while lamely pointing out to a kiosk for water / papadum
No serviette/ napkins / finger bowl upon asking was directed outside the restaurant
Food was ok would definitely not recommend
We ordered
Chicken tikka- was ok
Fish tikka -was ok
Crispy lady finger -was ok
signatures fish head curry with biryani rice ( biryani rice came with cabbage vegetable n aubergine pickle)
Just about ok to taste
Palak paneer ( not greasy) was decent but small portion
Assorted nan basket ( they all tasted same plain )
Nothing out of the ordinary
Extremely poor service actually no service
Self checkout
Staff does not even smile
Would not visit again n do not recommend as there are umpteen option available
Wonder y they have a 10.% service charge that should actually be the discount as its self service"
Worth a Try,"We ordered the fish head soup, chicken chukka, and curry mutton. Their meals are great, not too spicy but still tasty."
Tasty and reasonably priced,"The food is tasty, service is speedy and prices are reasonable. The usual dishes feature on the menu. If you enjoy Indian cuisine, try this."
Must order Naan and chicken 65.,1st time to this outlet. The naan is one of the best I had in Singapore. Curry fish head was disappointing as the fish isn't fresh. Perhaps is just mine. Chicken 65 is nice! Felt very thirsty after we left. I guess the msg kicks in.
There are better Indian options in Suntec,"We got into this restaurant, with the assumption that it's an upscale south indian restaurant. However, don't think the quality or the quantity of the food does justice to teh price they charge. The dining tables are placed pretty closed to each other, so on a crowded day, it would be almost like eating at a food court"
Must try fish head curry,"Came for dinner with friends. Recomend to try fish head curry, and mutton curry with bread. I feel food is good, service is good. Better to get table with nice view of Fountain of Fortune that add value to your meal. Recomendable to hv Indian curry in Singapore."
Poor .....,A la carte menu at lunchtime with free flow papadom was extremely poor value. Mean portions with poor spicing served tepid. Poor rice and quality and we would have been better served using the food court.
Yummy tasty curry...,Must try Fish Head Curry...if you are at Muthu's Curry.. Not only fish curry was good but you must try cheese chicken kebab.. Too good to resist..
Great Indian food with a good view,"Went here with my colleagues for a team lunch. We settled for curry as everyone had a different preference in food. It turned out to be a good decision. Loved the curry but a little disappointed by the naans. Slightly on the pricey side due to the restaurant being in town. We were seated outside the restaurant but that turned out to be the best decision made for us as the view of the Fountain of Wealth was simply breathtaking. Even as a local myself, this is the first time I had such a fantastic view of the fountain."
Real Taste Lost,"Those whom have had tasted Muthu's Curry > 10 years ago will realize that the taste is no longer as good as before.

Aaloo Mutter was served nice and warm, however Curry Fish (slice) has lost the original taste and also served cold.

1 fish + 1 vege + 3 plain naan > S$25, not exactly value for money."
decent food,"we had our lunch here after checking out the mall, the quality of food is decent but a bit on the expensive side,"
Nice Place - Muthu's Curry in Singapore,It's an Indian Restaurant in Singapore and here the food was excellent very tasty and yummy we had Fish Curry Rice which was superb one must visit this place it's awesome.
Not particularly tasty but clean and good service,"We ordered a small curry fish head (they were serving red snapper that day) and a plate of masala chicken and one plain naan. The dishes look ok, reasonable size serving. Taste is not as fragrant and yummy as I anticipated. I find Banana Leaf's dishes better but I guess sometimes it's a matter of taste. I can't say that the curry fish head was piping hot. Service is friendly and fast and place is clean. Pricing reasonable - around SGD50 for what we had. Location is very convenient. Toilet facilities are in the mall."
Good location and nice food,"Ambience and location:
Location of the restaurant is big plus. Only Indian restaurant in suntec.
Ambience is nice specially if you are sitting next to fountain of wealth.

Service:
Service is very good. We were guided well while ordering food. Only thing which I didn't like was self service for water. Didn't make any sense to me.

Food:
Food is good in taste and adapted a bit to suite locals and tourists.
Quantity is less considering the cost per dish.
Desserts are average compared to main course.

Must try:
Fish tikka and mango lassi in starters
Chicken chetinadu in main course"
Flavor of Indian tastes,"The Staff well received and My Friend recommended to have Gobi Manrichan, however since am from Hyderabad, the choice went towards to have ""Hyderabad Chicken Biryani"", after long stay in Singapore felt the ""Indian food Spicy"" touch here. Must visit to tickle your taste buds"
Fish head curry supreme,"If you don't like your food looking at you (a North American thing...) don't worry, the fish head is engulfed in the delicious curry with nary an eyeball poking out. And there is plenty of meat as the ""head"" really includes the first third of the entire fish. The flesh is perfectly cooked and the curry is so good that you keep at it long after you are full. The dish is very large (I got the small portion!) and satisfying. Only difficulty was finding the restaurant as it is tucked out of the way in the basement level of a very large mall -- but worth the trek!"
