Try the strawberry and rhubarb crumble :),"Great restaurant for seafood! Oyster was fresh. Good food recommendations by Sherica. Everything was spot on. We could see why the strawberry rhubarb crumble is the best seller, we didn’t even leave a crumb!"
"Overpriced, poor value","Portions are very small for the price, probably half of what you would get at similar restaurants elsewhere. Only the happy hour oysters are good value. So be prepared to fork out double what you normally would, just to feel moderately full after dinner."
Sh!tty value for money,34 bucks for 8 slices of an octopus tentacle? You have to be freaking kidding me. This has to be one of the most expensive octopus tentacles I have had that contained so little value.
Fabulous menu,Some really interesting and super delicious menu items make this a must-go destination for seafood lovers. Innovative. Delicious Superbly customer-focused staff.
Delightful,We love Humpback. The oysters are so fresh and flavorful. The vibe in the restaurant is unique and fun
Seafood Experience,"Tasty, fresh seafood. A tad pricey but the quality was good and the dishes could not be faulted. Surprised we’ve only just discovered this place. Excellent service with friendly, chatty staff and we enjoyed the company of the Executive Chef too!"
Great service!,Very attentive and caring service team that goes beyond to make your dining experience special. Great seafood dishes
The feel-good vibes,"Humpback happy hour makes us happy. Our third time round - just overall a feel-good place to hang back on the weekend, with wine pairing and a good range of fresh seafood. Service is unpretentious, thoughtful and immaculate. The staff even extended a birthday surprise...More"
Excellent seafood and service,Very yummy oyster and hh was so value for money. We had big fat juicy mussels and nicely done sole fish. Will be back
Will definitely recommend others to try!,"Great food and great service, no doubt. Staff is amazing and friendly. Nice atmosphere. Need to make reservations in advance as space is small and does not hold a lot of pax. More worth it to come for their happy hour."
Humpback,A place that will leave memories. The dishes brings out the best in seafood and highlight were oysters as starters to kick off evening. Fresh with the ocean goodness.
Worth a visit if you love seafood,"Great food. Fresh tastes. Lots of seafood. Oysters were great. Some fabulous signature dishes.; charred cabbage, and barramundi. Fantastic service at the cocktail bar."
Excellent Seafood,"I have to say the dining experience here was simply wonderful. We are not huge fans of high chair seating but this was an exception, which we didn’t mind. We reached on time and had made reservations prior, which was a good thing as this...More"
Well taken care of,I have dietary restrictions (gluten+others) and I stated that in my reservation. Staff did extremely well - provided a dedicated menu and checked back with me on anything they weren't sure of. Food taste/quality excellent. Just 2 (very minor) negative points: - Kitchen said mayo...More
Best oysters in town!,"Humpback never fails to deliver a wonderful oyster experience! Always fresh and tasty! Coupled with the great customer service, the dining experience is always enjoyable."
Our Anniversary,"We celebrated our anniversary at Humpback, and I mentioned this when I booked and asked for a nice table....never expected to be fawned over, receive welcome drinks and flowers. Awesome staff, food and so lovely to receive special attention. Thanks Humpback!"
Excellent staff and fresh food!!,"The staff were very knowlegeable about their menu and able to recommend me (blue mussels broth and swordfish schintzner), even though I have no idea what I wanted. And that meal fits the cold, rainy weather for the day."
Nice Chill out place,"Enjoy the fresh oyster promotion & cocktail - I love New York Sour, food was nice too. Staff was friendly & helpful."
Loud music and fun food!!,"We came for dinner and discovered that the indoor music here was too loud so much so I had a headache and my appreciation of the meal was impacted! The seats were elevated, mostly on high stools/sofas and even the younger guests had difficulty climbing up. Service was good and attentive. Food was generally good. We tried many dishes plus oysters. The serving sizes were tiny so we had to order all 3 pastas and an extra serving of bread! The halibut was not exciting, mussels were tiny and overcooked but with an excellent sauce. We enjoyed their salads, Burrata, cabbage, and especially their scallops with avocado. Regrettably, the toilet was disgracefully filthy."
Nice service and good food,Good service and the snacks that we ordered were all very nice although overall food prices are a little on the high side. The Rose wine we had was their house wine but it is a nice one. The oysters are good too but it was the small type. But I guess different season have different type of oysters so will go back again for different ones!
"Great food, excellent vibes!","Lobster croquette, salmon dip, kale salad are delicious! Wish we could have a broader range of Oysters to choose from on V day. Their seasonal cocktail bottles will knock you out (order & consume with care). Overall I had a great experience!"
Good Food Good Service,"Food is excellent, service is great! We ordered dozens of oyster and they are all so juicy and fresh - this price is a paradise for oysters lovers especially with the affordable happy hour price. Highly recommend it!"
Really Disappointing Food,"The Tuna Steak was so overcooked, made me feel like a cat food can.
Signature crab croquettes weren't amazing either. Crab taste rather mild with huge potato chunks
Definitely not a place to visit if you're hungry for food. Atmosphere wasn't that bad for a few drinks to chill."
Terrible service,"Despite having previously frequented this venue multiple times, this past visit my friends and I had the unfortunate experience of having to deal with the restaurant’s manager Jason. He is the rudest manager that we have come across in our over 10+ years in Singapore. As a result we will no longer be patrons of this establishment."
"Try the ""Bloody Mary""",Had a slighty diff name as was made with tequila but OMG...best version of this cocktail I think every hahaha...until a better one in hand...one large square cube with wafer thin cucumber slice on top...hit all senses at once...great deal on oysters as well...
Sea spray splendour,Beautifully love made dishes. The delicate and distinctly mesmerising balance of flavours competing with the freshness of the ocean is simply... Ooh la la... 🥰
Very average at best,The staff were generally standoffish and not friendly. Food was disappointing. Especially the lemon sole. Best dishes were the scallop ceviche and the lemon pasta.
Great affordable oysters during happy hour,"Was given a great seat by the bar (just in front of the oysters). Service was very good as well. And of course the best of all, oysters were very fresh and tasty."
Poor First Impression,"The hostess that lead us to our table was very unprofessional, otherwise, the dining experience was not too bad."
Great service and atmosphere,"Service is impeccable, great atmosphere and busy vibe, oysters and food were great too. Highly recommended."
Lemon Sole was undercooked And fishy,Drinks were good but expensive (mojhitos were $22 per shot); oysters were excellent and fresh. Steak was cooked perfectly. Letdown was lemon sole which was undercook and really fishy (doesn’t feel like it’s fresh).
Humpback never disappoints,"Brilliant as usual, Humpback never disappoints. This is my go-to place for fresh quality for oysters. The chef Polo does a nifty curation of the menu and a must-try dish is the cabbage. It will make you change your mind altogether about vegetables!"
"Great vibe: Fresh, tasty and fun","5 of us met up for a great reunion meal after being locked down for months. The staff are friendly and the ambience very chilled - good lighting and acoustics really help. If you order before 7pm the oysters are incredible value and still tasted of the ocean. Rest of the food was good - modern and interesting without feeling pretentious. Overall, a really great, mid-priced venue for a great evening on a date or with friends."
Seattle-inspired Humpback,"Seattle-inspired Humpback is pescatarean arms-thrown-wide-open friendly. Oyster buffs take their fresh picks from the catch baskets. Brunch is a medley of small but very tasty plates with flavours of the sea swirling. The restaurant is easy on the eyes with the pastel colours, reminiscent of a seaside eatery. #eatstylishtravelstylish"
We will be back,"So with the looming lockdown rules about to be enforced we thought we better go out and enjoy a dinner while we can. Humpback had a table for 2, when we got there they had organised their seating in regulations to the social distancing rules. We got some cocktails and oysters, both were delicious, if only I had known about their Oyster happy hour on weekdays earlier! We ordered snow crab croquettes which were also very tasty. For mains my husband had the Lobster roll and I got steak. I really enjoyed the friendly, efficient and up beat staff as well as the music playlist they had in the background. After chatting with staff it seems they will be open as they are under a restaurant license not a bar license so if you do need to get out they're most likely open,(though ring ahead), and they're on top of keeping a clean hygienic place, willing to serve you with a smile."
The place for oysters,"The best value for fresh oysters! service staff are friendly, they refill your water constantly and there is no charge for water."
Fresh oysters,"Always the freshest oysters happy hr at $3 a pop we had 30 at a go for 2 person, service was great at the bar counter and we can see the bartender creative mood too :)"
"Great vibes, fresh oysters","Come here for the oyster promo for oysters $2 or $3. Love the Kale salad and iberico. Char grilled cabbage too. A bit pricey, but worth paying for the quality and service."
Average,"Honestly not impress, neither by the food Nor the place itself. Overall quality is ok but not worthy for the money."
HumpBack Oysters,"Dined at HumpBack on last Friday , had a great time catching up with an old friend.
The oysters were excellent , at $3 a pop , its a great deal ....highly recommended and will be back for more.
Only set back was the music was a bit too loud for a conversation, if you are seated inside."
Best and freshest oysters I have had,Humpback serves the freshest oysters and it's totally worth the price! We ordered the barramundi fish and it tastes great as well! Will definitely be back for more oysters!
For oyster lovers,The food quality are excellent and they serve fresh oysters. Most of the dishes are creative. Wine selection are mediocre. Great value for oysters and food but not for the alcoholic beverages.
Good service and seafood,"Good oysters, scallops and hamachi. Churros tasted a little overcooked and cocktails were a bit on the weak side. Next time, we'll just have seafood with wine."
Nice food but overpriced.,"The food tasted nice enough but the portions were too small. Well presented oysters, delicious octopus but not enough of it and lobster roll with minimal lobster. The British waiter was informed and indeed had been trained on the food served (a rarity for all but the top restaurants in SG). The other staff were not so helpful. Had reservation for outside but given inside table which was blankly refused! I can imagine the only live animal who was truly happy with the sub-zero temperature inside was the pet penguin! The outside eating area, which seemed to be modelled on a derelict UK council playground, double up for the smoking area! Why? No charge for the passive smoking but still totally unacceptable."
Good food but music a little too loud,We went there for oysters and it did not disappoint. Fresh oysters. Churros dessert was also yummy. Nice atmosphere and good cocktails. But music volume should be turned down since most people are there to have actual conversations and we had to shout at some points across the table
Great Service 👍🏻,"Ever been to some restaurants where i got there early by few minutes and the staffs knew i was there but did not welcome me as it was not their operating hours. But this, i got there few minutes earlier and they asked if i would like to go in to sit while waiting! Of coz i would, especially in the current weather. So nice of them. After serving me iced cold water and given me the menu, the moment i looked up from the menu, even though they were standing from a distance, they would ask if i want to place an order. Maybe because i am the first and at that time the only customer, they were efficient. That’s what i thought. But as i observe, no, they are very friendly and efficient even after the crowds start coming in. They have a good varieties of oysters, i now know which type i preferred! I went there in August where the whole month they have this promotion, $3++ per oyster, really good deal! The best part, they would remove the oysters from the shell but put back on. Meaning, i can just slip them in conveniently! Some places i have been to, i have to struggle to get the oysters out of the shell. There is always a tiny bit that got stucked and i would burst the oyster if i am not careful. The other food such as lobster roll (quite bug portion) and cocktail are good too. In conclusion, i love my experience there (:"
Best oysters I have eaten!,"Had the freshest oysters, 4 varieties in all! Grilled octopus was excellent too! Interesting salad choices! Tall tables and bar stools not so comfortable and user friendly, Hope there are normal height tables for the elderly folks."
Oyster happy hour,"Oysters are fresh and very reasonable priced during happy hour. The rib eye steak was disappointing and expensive :( the sauce did not go well with the meat. However, will go back just for the oysters against"
Great for oyster lovers,They offer happy hour deal for fresh oysters and it is just great. The restaurant is small but cozy. Staffs are very friendly and helpful. I like sitting at the bar where all the oyster baskets are placed.
Great Oysters and Happy Hour,"The ambiance is already good, nestled in the heritage st of Bukit Pasoh. The Humpback serves good food with fantastic Happy hour drinks and deals. The staff were really friendly, but not intruding, that makes your dining experience really great. At the same time, their a la carte food were really tasty and fresh. One thing about this place is the oysters. Very value for money and supremely tasty. When ever I need a zinc fix, I always come here. Do make reservations for the Happy hours as they get booked out really fast."
Dinner,"Delicious food ,small plates to share , gorgeous flavors . Specialize in seafood - torched salmon amazing. Loved the veggie dishes as well beetroot and gorgonzola and the fried cauliflower dish"
"Great food, staff and ambiance",Visited for the chefs table and it didn’t disappoint! The staff were attentive and carefully explained the ingredients and drink pairings to us
Absolutely Delicious,"Excellent food, couldn’t fault a dish and we had lots. Also excellent bottle of white wine. One of my favourite restaurants now in Singapore."
Great oysters and seafood,"Nice place. Small, but glamorous. I had the oyster selection and some fine seafood appetizers. Wine selection was okay. Nice little patio setting."
Seafood At It’s Best,"One of the best seafood restaurants I have ever experienced. There was an incredible variety and it made choosing difficult, everyone in our group found unique selections. Great staff, helpful and friendly. Highly recommend this place."
Fun Place,"Enjoyed a nice mother’s day lunch here. Great imaginative food for sharing, nice wine, and a fun vibe."
Terrible service!,Very disappointing since it was a Mother's day brunch. The service was horrible and the restaurant wasn't busy. Couldn't get any service. I had to ask for everything from menus to water over & over. Couldn't get anyone's attention. The food wasn't great either. Never going there again.
Fab - great food,"Love Humpback, i've been upteen times now and each time the food has been fab. Great selection, the cabbage is a particular favourite. Happy hour is also fab - $15 Aperol Spritz! Highly recommend!"
Good food and good mood!,"We visited this place multiple times. It gives us good food and good mood every time :) Tasty oysters, incredible scallops ceviche, fresh torched salmon! Yummy)"
Sunday,"They must’ve been really busy. Friendly Caucasian staff, the rest seemed really flustered. Not once approached first, we had to approach them first :to order our meals, clear our plates, order more oysters, choose dessert, foot the bill. Better luck next time"
Consistently good,"We have been here so many times and it never disappoints.

The service is always attentive and the atmosphere is buzzing even for a Monday evening.

We had the burrata with chili oil which came pleasantly surprised. It’s smooth, delicious and the kick from the chilli really made a difference.

The Brussel sprout was very good, too. It’s tasty. You don’t need much as the sauce and the egg made it on the heavier side.

We had the seafood sausage which wasn’t quite my taste. I thought it had a foul taste to it but I can’t quite pin point what it was. The pork was delicious.

We finished off with the churros which were covered with a lot of cinnamon sugar with salted caramel inside. The last time we had it it was served with chocolate sauce and I thought it was lighter in taste. Nonetheless, they do make great churros here."
Fresh oysters and worth the price,"Def going back there for the oysters and the price is really worth it esp during the happy hour! Aside from the oysters, the pork dish was superb!"
Great value oysters,"Loved the happy hour oysters. Great tasting and quick to come out. Other food items were small and took 1.5 hours to be served. Staff gave us a complimentary cake for my wife’s birthday which was a nice touch.
Would go again for the oysters & drinks"
Amazing experience,"What a memorable night with the best food, atmosphere and service! Special mention to Ian who is such an amazing host! Will definitely recommend and come back again!"
Very good place,I like this place very much! Thank you for happy hour! Atmosphere was excellent! All meal very high quality
Good for brunch,"We wanted to try this place after watching Crazy Rich Asians, and the place didn’t disappoint. We went there for brunch which is a good option if you’re not a fan of seafood."
great evening,"The food here is always excellent - great atmosphere with good music, beer and oysters. We’ve been may times and will come again."
"Come for the oysters. Skip the umi,","We had dinner here recently and we were impressed: the food is fresh, delicious and their oysters are great - freshly shucked, condiments on the side, ready to be sampled.

The menu is mostly seafood, with a couple of beef and chicken dishes - we may try those next time. From our dinner, the lobster roll was almost as good - but we are biased towards fresh oysters, anyway.

Unfortunately the umi sea urchin snack was diminutive. Almost a non entity. And not very tasty, either.

Recommended: Sun Seeker oysters and a Negroni -happy hour oysters are as fresh, but at half the price. And the lobster roll and chardonnay.

Service is very friendly and comfortable. Will definitely return to sample the rest of the menu."
Amazing restaurant.,"Humpback is one of those amazing little gems in Singapore. Fantastic food, great wine, fun music, very attentive staff and a chef that deserves at least one Michelin Star....maybe more."
Cool joint,"Oysters! Well, that did seem to be their core offering, tho the rest of the menu held a bunch of interesting contemporary smallish/tapa-ish dishes most of which we really enjoyed. Pretty amazing how US oysters (cuz that's most of what was on offer) get shipped all around the world - but they were certainly fresh and very tasty. It's a somewhat noisy, busy, after-work scene and we enjoyed a couple of tasty drinks too. Overall a fun experience with tasty food. Certainly recommended."
Great fresh food,I have eaten 3 times at Humpback recently as I felt the food was always fresh and tasty. I especially like the kale salad and barramundi. And the flourless chocolate cake for dessert is divine. Friends ordered oysters which they liked and which were very reasonably priced during happy hour.
Didn't expect myself to like the oysters,"The happy hour oysters were a pleasant surprise, not too over-creamy and most importantly, it's fresh - I'm someone who generally runs from the sight of it.Other highlights were the black olive toast and the grilled swordfish."
Love the food!,Food is great and the servers are really accommodating! The Happy hour for Oyster is really worth it!
great food in a trendy loud venue.,"We went for the farm to table dinner on a weeknight. The place was crowded and noisy with a nice (but overloud) buzz. With the crowd size the kitchen was on the slow side. When it arrived, the food was great, as usual, and the drinks and wine selection excellent."
Nice place for couples and friend,The food and atmosphere is great. A good place to chill with friends and a quiet corner with your love 1
Oysters never disappoint!,The oysters are always fresh & staff are attentive - make sure you take advantage of happy hour oysters!
Lovely oysters and a well-rounded menu,"Mondays are all-day happy hour, so we left very happy indeed. All four oysters on offer were slurpworthy and intriguingly distinct. Blue Pool was bracingly briny with a sweet ending, Disco Hama full-bodied and addictive. We also ordered the burrata, which was fresh and rich, and a superb prosecco."
Unexceptional experience!,"Bumped into this restaurant as it was settled next to the hotel I stayed.
It was happy hour (till 8pm) and the oyster was so cheap!!!!!! Just 3 SGD per one!
I ordered the pork with strawberry jam for main. I cannot believe that the pork is so tender and taste great with the jam sauce!

I must recommend to my friends and families!"
OYSTERS!! The best!,I like the environment. Staff are friends. Oysters are ohh sooo yummmyyyyyyyy. Im hopinh to visit again with my boyfriend
Excellent place for oysters!,Humpback is excellent for oysters! Oysters at $3 a piece and Happy Hour all day on Mondays and Sundays. The lovely staff shucked the oysters in front of us right after we ordered and even offered their knowledge on the growing process and experiences in Washington at the Hama Hama farm. The rest of the menu boasts excellent food - we tried the pork and barramundi - and dessert was delicious. Humpback boasts a laid-back vibe and attentive staff. Sit at the bar like we did and engage in lovely conversation with the staff.
Casual dining & great food,"Excellent menu, fresh oysters, attentive staff. Beef and oysters are a must! What more can you ask for?"
Great food & Service,"$3.00 oyster !!!!!!! 4 x selection to choice from . I enjoyed the Blue points and Hama Hama. Happy Hour bottle of Verve Prosseco was a bargain. . The sea urchin from Japan was delightful . The only disappointment was the calamari. It was very soggy. Overall , the food and service was very good ."
I will be back...and I did,"Wow is an understatement. We found a restaurant in Singapore that made us feel like home in Seattle. The fresh oysters from Washington, USA and they are excellent. Besides the oysters, we also had beetroot, burrata, scallops, salmon, calamari, barramundi, wagyu, chicken, Mac and cheese, banana cake, chocolate cake...ok, pretty much the entire menu. All of them are consistently amazing."
Just $3 oyster!!,"First time I visited the restaurant. We could enjoy cheap and delicious oysters only $3 during the happy hour (until 8pm).And other seafood meals also very nice;)Stuff are kind and gentle, we spent happy time there."
Oyster eater paradise,"Great great even greater... we had 2 times the oyster plate and tried all kind. Later we choose 5 dishes to share... great taste and we happy we followed the recommendation. Also the wine list is good and fair price.

Yes... we will be back
Yes... we will recommend to everybody"
Woowza,Amazing food amazing drinks service was phenomenal the staff were very friendly and hospitable. Book in advance and try to be there during happy hour.
Happy hour oysters,$3 per oyster during happy hour. Which is pretty good for Singapore. Wish there was more variety for the oysters. They’re all Washington but they are (mostly) very fresh. Hard to get better oysters in Singapore.
Yummy food - terrible service,"Delicious food – really interesting and yet still refined and very tasty. Our particular favorites were the chicken with capers, the beetroot tartar and the olive and pesto bread.
The décor and ambience of the restaurant are nice – casual with high tables in a pretty shop house.
Two things really let humpback down –
1) the pacing of the food. The concept is sharing plates so between four of us we ordered about 10. It would have been lovely to be able to have a sip of our wine and then slowly be drip fed one or two dishes at a time so we could appreciate the delicious flavours and so our meal could be a relaxed experience. Instead they can nearly all at once as soon as our wine arrived which made the table stressfully overfull and really meant we couldn’t enjoy each dish individually.
2) The Service really lets Humpback down. It was an accumulation of many small things. Some of the staff were friendly and perfectly professional. Others were quite brisk and really lacking in charm. Some of the staff seemed neatly dressed with aprons on while one waitress was wearing an oversized tee-shirt (which hopefully had some shorts underneath) which looked like she had just got out of bed. It gave off a sloppy atmosphere rather than the cool casual atmosphere we were expecting. Other small things like being told that the kitchen closed at 11.30 (we arrived at 9pm) and yet we were asked whether they could give us our bill 10.30 while were still drinking our wine which made us feel very hurried out – such a shame in a half empty restaurant on Saturday night.
Service in Singapore really makes or breaks a restaurant for us and sadly the service in Humpback will proberly stop us coming back."
Good oysters,"good chill environment for sunday brunch. good oysters. Free flow mimosa is a recipe for disaster, sugar overload in a good way :)"
Oyster lovers hangout place,"Small lovely place for oyster lovers to dine. Had 4 variety of oysters to choose from, recommend that you get 1 of each type to try before deciding. The rest of the dishes were really good but portioning's way too little for the price."
Seafood to die for!,"I loved every bit of our visit at the Humpback! The waiter recommended nicely some dishes for us and they were extremely good :) Also drinks were good, although everything summed together was a tiny bit expensive but in the end it didn’t matter."
Great oyster place!,"Lovely place to enjoy the fresh oyster that came from USA and Canada up to 4 varieties they served other seafood that served with creativity. Alaska crab on the toast, Uni on the bread crust , unlimited oyster to satisfy you with $3 per piece till 8pm. Wine selection was great and reasonable price. The restaurant is very casual dining and has open kitchen concept .. very young and energetic Friendly waiters and waitress .. very enjoyable night ! Book earlier as the seats are not too many with some outdoor sitting as well."
such a cool funky place,"love this place, very cool, boutique, lovely portions of seafood based dishes, all lovely and well prepared and served with a smile lovely cocktails too and ambience outside great place for a date"
Good for small plates of fresh seafood,"My friend and I enjoyed a dozen oysters at happy hour pricing for oysters sourced from the USA Pacific NW. Good source for delicious oysters, but seems like there could be a more local source, like Hokkaido, Japan. Anyway they were wonderful. They did have a Hokkaido scallop we tried that was great. Also had some octopus and calamari. All our plates were finished when we realized we hadn't had any vegetable. So we ordered the charred cabbage with chili sauce which we enjoyed. Seems like mainly a place to drink and enjoy snacks along with. You have to be diligent to put together a balanced meal."
Great Little Spot if you like Oysters,Happy hour oysters between 5pm - 8pm everyday - all day/night on Mondays. Sharing plates. Great service and nice outside atmosphere on a cute little street.
Happy hour,Go for the happy hour!! 5-8 pm and all night Monday. Oysters and cocktails are excellent. You'll probably wanna stick around for dinner too.
Decent oysters,"We had a bit of a craving for oysters last week and knowing that the Happy Hour ends at 8pm here we were able to just scrape in to get our fix. 4 different types of oysters available during the Happy Hour at $3++ each or $2++. A small selection of drinks also available during Happy Hour. I had an Old Fashioned for $14++. The oysters were really quite good, but even during the HH it's not a cheap night here."
Nice and easy,"It's not spectacular but food, service and atmosphere are all very good. I would say it's a little pricey but only a little."
Excellent,"The oysters were fresh, juicy and sweet. Service crews were really helpful and friendly as well. Highly recommend this place."
A little over priced restaurant!,I was there for the 1st time and i kinda like the relaxed mood setting.. the standard of the wine served and quality of oysters were ok but i think the overall pricing was a bit steep..
