Best Korean BBQ !,We had a fabulous dinner at 8 Korean BBQ (Shaw Center)! Food was great and service was immaculate! Good for people like us who are lazy to grill the meat ourselves üòÅ. Will definitely go back again!
8 Korean Bbq,The quality of food (beef and pork) is great. The staff who cooks for us is friendly. Good dining place to visit even with young children.
8 Korean BBQ,I and my wife took our BBQ dinner on 16/11 and it was recommended by our daughter. The food is ok but we like the atmosphere.
Super decent food and quality service! Friendly staff.,"Super friendly staff and quality service. The food was super nice with meat flavored from wine, to red pepper paste. My go to place now! Price is ranging ranging around $30-$40/pax. We ordered one jar of Meokguli which costs about $40. MUST TRY!!! SUPER GOOD MEOKGULI! NOTE: 90 minutes dine in time"
BBQ lunch,"Meat did not seem sufficiently marinated, not flavourful and has a chewy bite. The pork belly and pork joal we ordered had porky smell."
Just a normal,"only 90min we could have a seat thus, all service crew seems very rush and no time to think about thier service it self. I won't recommend for purpose of business dinner but maybe with friends"
Excellent Korean pork,"I love the Korean pork. Our waiter Josephine was very helpful and told us to order the 4 portion pork instead of 8 as it would be a bit too much for 5 ladies‚Ä¶.if we aren‚Äôt full, she can upsize for us later. The Chope anniversary promo 1for1 Snake River iron steak was a disappointment‚Ä¶meat was as very tough. Also was charged GST and service on this when I realised Chope had already charged me service and GST on the voucher. Also 2 out of 5 guests got mild diarrhoea after dinner‚Ä¶.either to much raw lettuce or kimchi . Otherwise a nice place for a gathering."
Ladies Night,First time dinning there. The service is very good and prompt! Food is beyond our expectations! Price is reasonable! Booking via Chope is so easy and convenient!
Too short time for good food,The current 1.5hr dining time is not sufficient for a decent meal as the servers are always around to cook for you. Would be good if the dining time is at least 2hrs.
Limited variety,"Very limited variety. Army stew is very average and Korean pancake is below average. We ordered seafood pancake but kitchen got our order wrong. To save the trouble we told them we are ok with kimchi pancake. However, the cashier told us kimchi pancake and seafood are same price. We found price difference though."
"Food was great, the lone service staff was great too","Amidst the Covid dining restriction, I was rather surprised to see the restaurant bustling with customers on a Monday afternoon. A total of 6 tables were occupied, including mine, and there was only 1 lone service staff tending to all of us. If you've never been to Eight BBQ, let me explain why this is a problem. That one staff has to take orders, bring out the food, cook the meats at the table, set the stews to boil, clean up all the vacated tables so next group of customers can be seated, AND handle the cashiering. Through my time spent there, I saw a total of three female staff but only one (Filipino) staff was hurrying around, truly working her feet off. The other two (local Chinese) staff made their appearances once in a while, mumbling through their masks. The busy one, while hurrying, was still friendly and accommodating, and helped sent our requests to us whenever she bustled past us. We felt bad for her, as she obviously wasn't the only person working in the restaurant but yet she was made to work as though she was. Food was good, but other than the very commendable service efforts of the Filipino (5* for her) , the rest of the staff were lacklustre (2* for them). I got the vibe of unwilling team of service people. To have one staff overworked as she was while the others retreat into the kitchen, be prepared to lose your best staff - and then your customers."
Dinner with friends,"Excellent atmosphere, great food and friendly crew. Be back for sure again with family and friends. Special thanks to Levi and the other crew"
Average,"The atmosphere and the service is okay. We ordered the flower pork meat set and selected 2 flavors (Wine and Red pepper) felt that its just average, so we felt that the value is not really worth it. With the same price, other Korean BBQ restaurant definitely more worth it."
Not value for money!,The quality of meat was not good. Service was also not commendable. Food was not tasty. Staff clean the pan by sweeping with a brush/sponge (not too sure what it was was) to the side of the pan and thereafter she followed by putting the next dish on the same side; mixing it with the scraps.... I will not go again. Nothing worth mentioning and nothing to shout about!
Good service and food,"Meat was of good quality, stew was slightly underwhelming as it had a strong taste of MSG. Overall would recommend as meat flavours were great and serving sizes pleasant."
Good food,"Staff did their best but good if they learn to say ""excuse me"" while patrons having conversation instead of barging in and explaining the food"
Average,The food was not too bad actually. Was a little peeved that the place has a 1.5hrs limited and for a bbq place 1.5hr is really short. Quite a downer for my friend who was celebrating her bday. We still had some alcohol and half a plate of seafood uncooked.
Awesome food and environment,The reservation was seamless and the entire dining experience is great. Really love their 4 color pork belly and wagyu beef.
Very nice,Service is excellent. Food is really nice. Can have stew and bbq stoves together at the same time unlike places that have only 1 stove at a time
Food good but 90 min dining time only,Food is fantastic service as well but 90 minutes no sufficient for two of us to finish the beer. Was given reminder 15 min before 90 min
Decent Korean meal and comfortable and spacious environment,"Our first time im this restaurant at Scotts Road. It is spacious but have only 1.5hr to finish the meal on a Friday night. One of the best is the Yucha Makgeolli which is the ice rice wine and the seaweed appetizer. The meat portion is quite good and the there is a waitress who did the cooking for us at our table which spare us the time to cook. Kimchi and beat sprout are free flow.
This is a decent place fo have a Korean meal with a group of friends."
Great food and great service,"Definitely will revisit again as the food were fresh and yummy! They will assist you to BBQ on the spot , free from hassle yet enjoy the BBQ food :)"
Family dinner,"4 colors pork belly so so, tried other Korean BBQ much better in terms of taste and quality. For the same price, can get better one elsewhere"
Great service from Chris,Had a wonderful dining experience with the family here at 8. The short rib and the atlantic salmon was really good and there was all round great service. We especially enjoyed the service from Chris our chef for the day!
"Not worth it, food was average, service too",Was told that I can‚Äôt enjoy burple‚Äôs one for one deal because I did a reservation under chope and they can‚Äôt cancel our reservation even though the restaurant was empty with only one table occupied.
Jal Meogeosseumnida,"Had an appt nearby and decided to give this restaurant a try - read the reviews and understood that the dining time is only 1.5 hours (regardless whether peak or non peak period) makes me wonder why though?
It was a late Sun afternoon, as I got to the restaurant, I waited at the entrance for someone to acknowledge me. Nobody did, till one of the waitress happened to be at the cashier counter and even then I had to greet her first, not the other way around (not that I mind, I just really wanted to be seated). She then informed that the dining time is only 1.5 hours (as expected, despite a non busy restaurant).
Ordered the flower pork set and it comes with a stew of your choice. 4 types of banchan was then placed on the table and followed by the serving gears and cutleries. I must stay, the banchan are pretty tasty. Later came the hot plate and my choice of flavoured pork accompanied by kimchi and bean sprouts. One of the waitress helped to BBQ the pork at my table and left momentarily - when I tried to turn the pork around, the waitress came back and said don‚Äôt touch the meat and that she‚Äôll do the BBQ-ing for me as there‚Äôs timing to ensure that its fully cooked. Hey, fine by me if you wanna do the BBQ-ing.. it‚Äôs just that perhaps she could have used a friendly tone or phrase to inform me of such instead of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt touch the meat‚Äù
Once all the pork has been grilled, stew has been cooked/ warmed up - I took my first bite of the pork and immediately fell in love with the flavour, texture and the juiciness! Super duper delish! Kimchi tasted just right too! Def has my kind of spicy and sourness to it! The stew was okay, will taste better with thicker broth.

In a nutshell:
Food - 4/5
Service - 3.5/5
Ambiance - 4/5
Value for money - 4/5

Will I come back again?
YESS! With my family next time :D"
Branch at Shaw Center,"Located on the 4th floor of Shaw Center on Claymore Hill Road entrance is a minimalist Korean restaurant. Had their Army stew, truffle steamed egg and green grape soju. The army stew soup taste pretty good and the egg was acceptable. The soju was a great accompaniment for us as a couple. We finished everything including their kimchee! Price was mid to high. Didn‚Äôt order the meat because there were only 2 of us."
Satisfy your Korean Pork BBQ crave during Covid 19 times,"Went to the Shaw House outlet. Had a good meal ordering their 4 colors set which comes with Army Stew. Good quality pork, one of the better ones. Also had the grass fed beef which was yummy, too. Ordered the Kimchii pancake and steamed eggs. All the dishes met our expectations.
Not sure if it was because of covid19 limitations but they seemed a bit short of staff and service was slow at the beginning. When the food arrived, we were too busy enjoying and didn't need the service as much.
Will certainly go back for more."
Ok. Not bad.,"Too bad we couldn't try the signaure pork as my partner was Muslim. Beef was nice! Ordered seafood which was ordinary. Kimchi pancake was SUPER YUMMY & crispy! But, super oily too. Would be perfect if not so oily."
Unlikely to visit again,Unable to use burple app even though they indicated that it was available for use. Food is terrible.
Very bad experience due to lack of customer service relationship,"My booking was 6pm but I arrived half an hr early to wait fr my Son. I was first greeted by the staff who told me the moment I stepped into the restaurant, they start counting 90mins time limit and I hv to leave by 7pm irregardless what time my Son turns up! It doesn‚Äôt matter I arrive on time or earlier. The restaurant was empty at tat time and I was like thinking what kind of customer treatment is this? I book for 2pax, the staff shld be experienced enough to see how Long customers can eat right?
At this time of a crisis, when every restaurant is welcoming all diners where possible, such rules are imposed the moment A customer stepped in? Well, first impression of good service already gone down the rain no matter how good your food is. Customer mood was dampened the moment I stepped in n I do not feel welcome at all.
Next, I had a voucher which I need to redeem by 30jun but was told they do not honor the voucher and asked me to call the bank for extension. There was no arrangement with the bank at all and I was told to wait for next 15mins while the staff tried to call their Mgmt to verify.
My point is I am ok NOT to redeem the voucher if there is extension.but they left me to wait and could not make any decisions. If the restaurant owner decided to put themselves eligible for rewards redemption, pls inform their staff on the right procedures.

Last but not least, for anyone of you who wants to eat at this restaurant, chope does not state any rules the restaurant imposed. So best to call up or u will get the same experience like me! The food is not cheap n there are lots more worthy restaurants out there that give better customer treatment!!"
Average food with inefficient exhaust system,"At level 4, this restaurent is rather dark and cold. The exhaust system was not efficient enough, so we were all smelling of our dishes! We ordered many dishes including pork Neck, Short rib, rib eye. The octopus was disappointing. Seafood pancake was fairly tasty and crispy. The steamed egg looked unusual, was fluffy and interesting. The pork jowl and Kalbi and makgeolli rice wine was not available. The meal experience was way below expectations."
Dinner,"Went for early dinner at 6pm. Ordered a BBQ set for 2, and get the soup for free (only for those priced at $18, if not you have to pay for those additional cost for those more than $18. BBQ was more than enough for 2 females. Added a rice to share, and the side dishes - seemed to have less variety now. Only the cream pasta is nice."
Service,Friday dinner typical crowd. However the staff managed well and were polite and courteous. I really appreciate this kinda attitude instead of being brushed off despite being busy. They served non mediocre kimchi üëèüèº
Hit and Miss with this place.,"No doubt service is good, but the food is a hit and miss, beef was a mixed bag some were chewy some were good, cuttlefish was a big let down, very chewy, the best was actually the salmon, highly recommend it. The mushroom was also so chewy. Soup was so bland and not aromatic. The pancake was also a big disappointment. Side dish condiments was also a mixed bag, some were good, some were average. And I cannot believe they charge for water."
Great food and service,"Great food, service and love the environment. The menu had what we needed. The waiters bbq the food for you and prep it on the table. There is a fan mechanism on top of the table to suck in the smoke."
"Great service , nice environment with well ventilation",The location was well ventilated so that u do not as bad as you can imagine. You can sit back and relax as the staff are so friendly n they cooked for you. Will visit again
"Meat was good, but won't be coming back","Compared to a lot of other Korean BBQ establishments, this place is clean and ventilated. Did not smell like BBQ-zombies after we finished out dinner. Overall, food was in good portions, ordered two beef portions, and one pork jowl for 4 pax. Very satisfied and full. The downside was the korean side dishes, all didn't taste authentic and variety was bad. Because of this, the meal didn't feel complete. That's why I won't be coming back."
Craving satisfied,"You are spoiled for choice among the many Korean restaurants in Singapore. But 8 Korean I believe is youe best bet for quality meat. Special shout out to Vanessa (from the Shaw Centre branch) who was a superwoman at the time we dined there. She greeted customers, led them to their table, prepared the cooking gear, brought the meat and explained the process, grilled the meat, checked in to ask if we were enjoying it, refilled our kimchi, and helped settle the bill. Repeat by the number of tables in the resto."
Dinner at 8 Korean BBQ,Food was great and service was excellent. Nice atmosphere and all of us had a good time. Will definitely go back again
Nice ambience but Kimchi a bit sour...,Nice ambience but Kimchi a bit sour. Good serving of the 4 flavours of pork and tasty army stew with Soju.
Excellent Service,Excellent Service even when we are using chope vouchers They look after each table needs very well Very attentive Provide apron Nice food Friendly staff
Poor Service,"Both the pork belly and LA kalbi were good. When we booked the restuarant, they Whatapps me to inform me that we had to finish our meal within 1 and half hour. When we were at the restaurant, the keep reminding us to the time limit. They make the customers look cheap. Even though the restuarant was not full. The staffs attitude were very poor !"
A lovely birthday treat,"My daughter loves Korean bbq and so we ended up here on holiday for her birthday. It is quite a find not least it is in labyrinth of the Shaw Centre and not as easy to find as you'll imagine. However, your efforts will be rewarded with a 'one of its only kind' in Singapore Korean BBQ (the other branch is a 'short' distance away in LA!) with 8 flavours of meats to try - it was a feast worth trying and the condiments and kimchi are all up to scratch and the waitress was chatty and cheerful despite being run off their feet. The pancake was excellent too. Highly recommend."
Nice experience,Meat was fresh and the service is good as they help us to grill the meat. Side dishes are refillable too~
Excellent,"Very authentic Korean BBQ with good service, nice staff and their signature pork bellies are a must!"
8 Korean BBQ - VERY BAD SERVICE,"They provide normal but very pricey food. Service is bad they chased us out when time up given only 1.5hours to eat, we wanted to order their bingsu only 1 flavor available and due to time permitted we were not able to order cos it take 30mins of waiting time for them to prepare it!"
Satisfying Dinner!,"Been seeing reviews of this in IG. Finally made it there tonight!

Great place to feed the growing teens! Taste was perfect and service was great!

We ordered the pork set meal for 4 flavors that comes with a beef kimchi soup, and a beef kalbi and vegetable pancake.

Will come back for more!"
"overpriced, non authentic, lousy service","Only good point: the staff doing the BBQ for my table. She took effort in explaining the steps, meats.

Otherwise, service was nothing to shout about cos it was practically non existent and when there was, it was either reluctant or with a sour attitude.

I stood outside the restaurant for 5 mins and no one came to check if I needed a table. This was during non peak, without any crowds.

When I got myself seated, I was left alone for 30 mins (still no crowds) until the staff got antsy about the next reservation for the table and then they decided to come and ask for my order. They claim that dining is confined to 1.5 h, but this was not communicated before/ during booking. Nor posted any where in the restaurant itself.

Even after taking my food order, I had to prompt them for beverages to be served. Plain water is $2. While refillable and I support charging for water, this amount is way over market rates.

The food quantity is not worth the value paid, even for the orchard road area. The price also doesn't justify the quality/ taste, as there was nothing special nor was it authentic Korean food. You'll be able to get a better value meal at any of the cafes or even restaurants in the hotels around for the same price.

At bill payment at the cashier, the staff was so ambivalent in her task and had such an angsty vibe. This was even when there wasn't any Q behind me. In fact, she barely uttered any words, even when I thanked her at the end (automatically, though I should've stopped those words from coming out of my mouth)."
Mr. Adrian Lee,"The most welcoming restaurant where the staff are so warming and welcoming to us with open arms, this is my 5th time returning to this restaurant as we love the foods and the ambiance is just superb, had the hot pot with BBQ Pork Belly and Neck, with seafood pancake and assorted vegetables"
Value for money!,"Great ambience, good service! There are different sets of flavoured barbecued pork that you can choose from. Would recommend this to anyone looking for Korean Bbq."
Good experience,"We came for a pre-Mothers Day lunch. The flower pork set for two ($58) which came with a seafood stew ($18) (1 prawn, 2 mussels) was just right for us, plus the customisable bi bim bap ($10) - which we realised only letter was a set as it cake with a drink. That rendered this item unchangeable on Chope vouchers - something which the server could have conveyed more courteously. Still, decent food and you can watch the latest K pop music videos on the hanging screens."
First and last visit,Could not taste the favouring of the meat. The truffle steam egg doesn't taste any truffle at all. The seafood beanpaste soup is very diluted. Service staff was not very friendly and helpful. Quite upset to have choose this place for my birthday dinner.
Do not patronise this restaurant!,"I hardly leave reviews, so when I do, it means it is really bad.
The cons
(1) One of the service staff is quite rude. She cannot spare a couple of minutes to explain the menu to us, always running around. When my wife ask her why can't she explain the menu properly; she curtly said that the restaurant is under-staffed, so she is the cashier, waitress, and cleaner at the same time. Yes, I understand the problem of being understaffed, but that is her boss' problem, why am I the consumer being penalised; more so in a restaurant with premium pricing?
(2) The food is over-priced for the quality. Ordered the flower pork set and the wagyu beef. The flower pork set came with a stew of your choice. The meat is tough and tasteless, and the stew's taste is like water with some kimchi flavour.
(3) They bring all the meat out at one go. I think they did it because they are understaffed, so they do not need to take 2 trips to bring the food. We cooked the flower port first, and only the beef half hour later. By then, the beef is already not fresh. The staff needs to be better trained on food quality and freshness; again for a restaurant with premium pricing.

Overall, very bad experience; made worse with the waitress attitude (the other waitresses are okay, only the Filipino waitress has a perpetual scowl and black face)."
Service Quality...,"Overall service quality dropped drastically as compared to the initial period when the restaurant started business with ample service staff to guest ratio. I visited the restaurant on 20 Apr and the experience was no different to a mass market family Korean joint. I even had the experience of the waitress shouting across 2 tables in reminding me to leave the cooking to her!

I've been to 8 Korean @ Shaw frequently since they started business, and last Saturday would DEFINITELY be my final visit..."
Best BBQ at orchardarea,"Had enjoy the bbq with my family during the weekend. Order the army stew and it was great as well. Unlimited serving of side dishes where were great. While waiting, we get to enjoy the various kpop mtv on the TV screen. By the way, this is our second time here and both time, the experiences were wonderful."
Good quality pork (Clarke Quay),"Had a very enjoyable dinner at 8 korean BBQ. We had the 8 selection of pork which is cooked in front of your eyes as well as Kimchi/Beansprouts, you also get a selection of side dishes which you can get more of throughout your meal you just have to ask. My only problem with this place is it is very loud and smokey, you definitely come out of the experience a little charred but the food is worth it."
Great food and excellent customer services,"Was at Isetan Orchard and chanced upon this restaurant while searching for something new for dinner. While googling to check reviews of this place, realised that this restaurant needed reservations at 6pm. Was lucky that there is still a slot for 6.30pm , but on condition is that we need to vacate the table by 8pm due to full booking. Hey, 1.5hrs is more than sufficient for my family as we are fast eaters.
As we are 1st timer, Vanessa, the waitress that served us was fantastic. She advised on the right amount of food to order for a family of 3, even recommending better selections. Knowing that we are 1st timers, she even helped us to cook the food, and explaining the food and cooking procedures. Vanessa truly demonstrated excellent customers services and my family were fortunate to be served by her. She is a great asset to this restaurant."
Unpleasant,"Was there on a Sunday late noon at 2.30pm. Bought chope vouchers and the first thing we were told by the staff was ""You have to bill by 4pm, otherwise we can't accept this voucher"", in an unpleasant tone. First impression was bad as I was there with my parents for my dad's birthday.

Service was also slow despite that it was an off peak hour. Truly disappointing experience."
8 Korean BBQ (Central Clark Quay),"Quality hot plate meat with great tenderness. Outdoor seating is perfect, great view, great breeze, great food. Will definitely visit again."
Great Food and Staff,"Went to Shaw Centre branch 2nd time after thoroughly enjoying our first visit, this time to celebrate our friend‚Äôs birthday. The food is excellent as usual, makgeolli is a must try, I had yuzu and organic honey before, both were yummy! Special thanks to the staff for going the extra mile to sing our friend a birthday song when bringing out the cake, that was very sweet. The only downside was that we had to leave pretty much on the dot in order for the next round of reservations."
Reunion dinner,Meat portions seem smaller than those at Clarke Quay but service was better than the Clarke Quay branch.
Not bad,"This was my first time at 8 Korean BBQ. Overall, quality was pretty good but it's quite pricey for the amount you get. I also find that it's very pork heavy, there are some nice value sets for the pork dishes but none for the beef/chicken options which means if you're not a pork eater (like myself) your meal can actually get quite expensive. I'd say the quality of the meat and seafood makes up for it though."
Nice when you are hungry,"It was late, but we walked here (next to our hotel) to satisfy our craving for Korean food. It was not quite the standard that we were used to. Service was excellent. Food was spicy hot, but not strong in flavour. Limited selection of beers and sake. We would not go back, but it was not bad."
Excellent service! Great meats!,"Service by the staff was excellent. Clarity in their explanation of the menu and they would always ask how well we would like our beef done. In our case, our service staff also gave us her recommendations and we were glad we took them!The stews were not as good as the meats but since it came as part of our meal, we did not want to be too critical of it.Not the most affordable outing but the service made it worthwhile!"
A little disappointed,Third time eating at the restaurant. Didn‚Äôt visit the restaurant for awhile. The standard in term of taste has drop. Isn‚Äôt as delicious as before. Overall service and all is still good. The outlet has also shrunk in size.
Tasteless and not work the price,Short rib was chewy ans tasteless. pork collar was hard. For the price I wasn‚Äôt expecting to be served and made to eat off plastic. Won‚Äôt be going back or recommending this place.
Great Korean BBQ Experience - better than Seoul Garden!,"My friend had booked dinner for us at this place. We were seated promptly, and the waiting staff were so helpful and recommended various dishes when we stated what we preferred, and how to cook them (our first time at a Korean BBQ in years)!

We tried various cuts of meat, with a variety of marinates. We also had other side dishes - the kimchi and the seaweed were amazing! The bulgogi was astounding too. The atmosphere was lovely and not rushed at all, and the prices were very reasonable for the quality of food there. Will definitely go there again!"
Worth a try,"While BBQ in a restaurant setting is not new, it was a refreshing change to have someone cook the meats as part of the service. I think it would have been a much better experience if I had some advice from the staff on what to expect."
Deserves a nine,"@TheKuoKnows

Love the laid-back feel about this very trendy Korean BBQ eatery in the Orchard area. They have modernised bulgogi without losing any of the authenticity.

The selction of condiments that accompanied the set meal is superb. The Kimchi is as good as I have had. Not sure that it needs to be heated on the grill, though. I prefer it cold.

The deep fried seaweed gets top marks. The Kimchi beef stew is delicious.

The pork medley is a great way to sample one of the protein selections. It‚Äôs expertly cooked for you at the table too.

Prices are a bit higher than elsewhere. But the portions are generous. The condiments are bottomless, which is another plus.

Well done 8 Koren BBQ!"
Free range pork served,"The Mangelica Pig that hails from Bulgaria is the star of this bbq joint. Choose from their 8 selection of marinates but my personal favourites were the herb, wine, garlic and kalbi.

The table set up is really fuss free, do not expect the elaborate sort of dining experience you see on television. The refillable side dishes were of a small but ample range, and the friendly servers would be more than happy to top up your empty plates.

For me, the stew that came with the set order for 3 pax was forgettable in both taste and appearance. Or you can just say that I am bias against the boiling pool of redness because why settle for stew when you can indulge more in the pork!

The servers will explain the cute and marinates, line the beautiful pork bellies ok the slightly tilted bbq pan which was meticulously angled to allow the oil to drip into the ‚Äúcollection bin‚Äù situated so nondescriptly in the center of the table.

There will be a piece of paper that would be placed on top of your meat as they sizzle and cook away, this was supposedly to prevent the oil from splattering. The only issue I had during the dinner was the tiny smoke vent which I reckon did next to nothing in sucking away the smell.

Forget about ordering the kimchi pancake, just go full on carnivore mode if you are dining at this place! You shall not regret it!"
I love korean bbq!,"I really don't eat korean food, but this bbq is an exemption. Meat is fresh. Taste is really great with variety of flavors to enjoy. But what i really like the most which is a 10 is how the crew provides service. They are really polite and attentive. I will comeback if i have a chance!"
Mouthwatering korean bbq!!,The best korean bbq we've ever tasted! And we really want to come back again to Singapore because of this.The taste was really unforgetable(no joke!). The staffs are pleasant and accomodating also. Dreaming for the next trip to Singaporeüòõüòõüòõ
Excellent Food and Service,"Meat was fresh and well seasoned, except the side dishes were a little too sweet. It is a pity that rice was not provided. Cooking was done by their staff, they were friendly and attentive."
Dining Experience,"Ordered the 4 colours set & while the meat was good, the seafood tofu stew was very underwhelming. Also, a point to take note for those ordering the 4 or 8 colours set which comes with a stew, the set only covers the $18 stews so if you order the $24 one you have to top up $6 which is not written in the menu. The staff did inform us, so just bear this in mind in case the staff forgot to let you know. The unpleasant part was that the restaurant was understaffed so some staff forgot our request for refills of side dishes; had to ask another (already busy) staff to get it. Also requested a staff to helped take a photo but she said she had to wash her hands first - understandable - but once she left the table she forgot to come back. Feel that service can be improved a lot more."
Top Korean BBQ in Singapore,"Our second visit at 8 Korean BBQ was again a pure culinary enjoyment.
It is a small restaurant- so it is wise to book a table (use the link from trip advisor) as it is usually filled to the last table.
They have a small menu - but each of the products is from the highes quality and taste. We tried basically everything and there was nothing what does not taste. Also bigger groups (10-14 people) can eat here together."
Still the best korean bbq,The meat is fresh. Service is good. I just hope they give more side dishes. We also love the flavors of the meat.
Excellent korean BBQ meats,Had a BBQ lunch with kids and it was a wonderful meal. Love the kimchi and beansprouts on the hot plate which absorb themeat‚Äôs juices and gave them extra flavour. Marinades of the meat were very interesting. Tried the original and wine flavour. Wine is nice.
"Great service, great food","Service was great, staff very attentive and helped to cook. Ordered 4 flavor pork set for 2 and we could finish it! Pork asked great! Just feel that the army stew might not be that worth it. Not that many ingredient."
Cosy place and nice food,The 8 flavours or pork were interesting and tasted interesting. Staff were attentive and helpful in fulfilling your requests. They helped to carry out with our birthday surprise and offered to store the cake for us during our dinner there.
Nice place but given 1hr30min too short.,Only let us stay for 1 hr 30min is abit short. If is 2hr it will b better. When we left there no Q at all. Was thking y do they hv to rush us? We hvnt really finish our beer n drink. N we hv to rush to finish it. Disappointed
"Good service, bad food","The ambience and service were really good. Waitresses were there to help you to bbq, however, the meat wasnt really well-marinated and the price was on the high side."
"Good experience, nice food","Our first experience of Korean BBQ cuisine, so we were a little apprehensive! Staff put us at ease and explained the menu options and gave us their recommendations, as we weren't too sure how much food to order for 2 people.

Food was tasty and good quality. This was actually my first experience of Kimchi - It was delicious!

Thank you for a good evening!"
Good Food,Love the food here and the great customer service. The service staffs are all very efficient. Will definitely return again.
Food is good but service is abit slow,"I have been patronizing this eating place almost on a weekly basis with my colleagues, friends and even solo. The food is definitely recommended but for set lunch, at times it did subject to the mood of the chef's/ the person preparing the food. Because the sides could be abit salty at times and the soup base may be abit bland at times. However, the BBQ porks maintained its standard still. As for the services, I noted that there are lesser staffs for the lunch session hence it is abit slow in serving. Dinner time is usually okay for more staffs are around then."
Excellent service and good food,The service staff is friendly and prompt. The kimchi is really good too. Food is good and served piping hot.
Great experience,Excellent food with great service from attentive and friendly staff! Loved their 8 colour set. Third time visiting this outlet and will definitely come again.
Bad first experience,"Took up a friend‚Äôs recommendation and decided to give wife a treat as she‚Äôs always been interested in Korean food (especially those small side dishes)
I‚Äôm a meat eater and when my friend said the meat there is great, I didn‚Äôt need any further research.
But boy! Were we disappointed.
The meat wasn‚Äôt really that great as the waitress didn‚Äôt seem to cook it well enough making the fat really chewy and hard to bite.
The seafood of the Flower Pork Meat Set was also not fresh... prawn head was black as it get cooked and the mussels were tough and lack of sweetness.
What‚Äôs worse was that I had the runs after this meal... hmmm. Not sure which part of the meal disagreed with me though.
Doubt I will come back to this joint ever again.
$104 for 2 adults and a small child isn‚Äôt really a very cheap meal either. Was expecting much better."
Eight types of marinated pork,Tried their signature eight types of marinated pork. Interesting concept and flavours but not all the flavours suited my taste buds and the meat was quite expensive. Traditional korean side dishes were also not fantastic and did not like the customer service.
Korean Barbeque pork belly,The side dishes are good but the pork belly have too much fat and less meat. The seafood pancake is good. Bingso desert is average.
Impeccable customer service,"The atmosphere is hip, and very spacious. What really surprised me and my partner was the customer service by what seemed to almost be a one-woman show - taking and serving orders with recommendations given. She was really helpful. On a side note, having to have read other reviews prior to going for our meal here without expectations, i was pleased to be able to taste the difference between 3 out of 4 of the pork belly flavors. Highly recommend the garlic flavor! There was once dish which we did not enjoy, the bibimbap - too little rice and when recommended with the mushrooms, it did not compliment the dish at all and felt that it cancelled out the Gochujang taste."
Big mistake,Their signature dish was the four types of pork belly. It was 90% fat couldn‚Äôt really tell the difference between each one. Also have the beef wagyu was just ok. Was definitely the worst Korean barbecue restaurant I‚Äôd ever been to.
Great Korean bbq,"This place is famous for their eigh colours pork. It simply means pork belly marinated in different flavours. Ask the service staff for recommendations and they will be Glad to do so. Menu is not really very extensive but good enough for your usual korean fare. The staff will do all the bbq and your part is to wait and eat! Love the food, will be back again!"
"Great location, Friendly staff but let down in food quality!","Restaurant was over half full. Staff was friendly. Promoted the pork set when taking our orders. ( just 2 pax) As we are not great fans of pork, we ordered the short ribs ( 200g), soy chicken and a pancake to share. Did not start right, the complimentary side dish ( sprouts) had gone totally off! We told them and they promptly replaced with a new serve. Staff returned constantly to see if we wanted more of the side dishes. ( The pancake was as good as what I have tasted elsewhere)

The short ribs was definitely less than promised 200g. In our opinion, no more than 150g ( 8 or 10 small and thin slices) When I asked if the serve was indeed 200g, staff evaded the question, not once but twice! Last came the soy chicken, which was simply too sweet to eat.

The total bill including a rice wine was over S$120. I like to think beef and chicken was not their speciality. But overall I tasted much better Korean choices at 20% cheaper. Unlikely to return."
I LOVED EVERHTHING ABOUT THIS PLACE,"Remember to make a reservation before you go because they don‚Äôt fancy walk-ins.
This has one of the best BBQ experiences.

What was awesome about this place in terms of food was:
1. the sides were great - not your standard flimsy sides that have been left out for far too Long
2. The BBQ pork belly was tender and not over done!

Service was TOP too! I‚Äôm definitely coming back for more!"
Casual Lunch,Standard environment with average Korean fare. Staff were competent but not extravagant. Worth a try but not unlikely for repeat visits.
"Great service, yummy food",the food was good with generous portions. The ventilation could be improved though as we still smell like walking bbq after dinner.
"Nice food, ambience and staff","Enjoy friend gathering there with delicious food, nice ambience. The staff are friendly and accommodating. Good service."
Wonderful Evening,Great food. The pork was spectacular and so was the soup. The service was also very friendly and kids enjoyed the food as well. Will be back again.
Great fusion korean bbq,Overall a bit pricey. Average price per diner was $50 but the pork belly is definitely worth a try..
