Poor quality at high price,"Quality of food getting from bad to worse and especially today which was bad enough for us to make this our last with them - steam dungeon crab was not fresh, dimsum shrunk in size and tasted like they were prepared and left there for quite some time (skin hard and chewy). Bolo buns were so different in size with one like a mini version. Chrysanthemum tea was quite tasteless. Service was fine as they changed the crab to mud crab which was not the standard like before but we couldn’t be bothered to ask for another change."
Yummy expensive seafood,"Friends told us to try Jumbo seafood so we went to the one in Ion Orchard. Had to take a queue number and we waited quite long for our table almost 2 hours. We went shopping and came back and yet had to wait for quite a long time. We were so hungry but the wait was quite worth it.

The waitress who couldn’t speak proper English tried selling the lobster to us but we were there for the chilli crabs. She kept telling us to order two crabs but we told her we are going to order other dishes. There was just two of us having dinner! We also ordered a soon hock marble goby fish and two other dishes.

It was too much and we were soooooo full. Imagine the waitress kept pestering us to order another crab as she said one wasn’t enough! We wouldn’t have been able to finish it. The dungeness crab was quite big. They ran out of mud crabs.

The food was good, the chilli crabs were great, but the cost wasn’t. It was expensive. We ordered a chilli crab, soon hock fish, kang kung belacan, and a Malay noodle and tea and the cost was SGD 290. Might be affordable for Singaporeans or foreigners from countries with stronger foreign exchange rates, but when you’re from Malaysia you can get it cheaper at home.

The restaurant deco was nice."
Seafood Dinner,Best chilli crab in my opinion! Request for female crab in advance to get the crab roe! It is super amazing! Alaskan king crab can be cook in 2 different ways! Went for the steamed and chilli crab style! Order mantou/deep fried buns to dip in the chili crab sauce! It is amazing and delicious! Seafood were really fresh and dishes were well cooked! Remember to ask for bamboo clam if available as they are sold out most of the time. The best bamboo clam you can ever get! Not frozen kind! Well taken care by service manager Lee Jia Lee with her professionalism and top notch hospitality skills! Thank you for the wonderful experience Jumbo Ion
MUST TRY WHILE IN SINGAPORE!,A group of friends and I recently went to Jumbo Seafood for lunch and we were not disappointed! We specifically came here for the chili crab after multiple recommendations for this restaurant. We were all pleasantly surprised by the amazing service and the quality of the food. We all found the crab to be delicious and were left extremely satisfied. I would highly recommend this restaurant specifically for your chili crab experience!
Very Good!,"Delicious food especially the chili crab and good services, i will taste again when i go to Singapore next time."
Rushed and Pressured into ordering,"Came here for a lunch. The waitress was really pushy and tried to get us to order the most expensive Alaskan Crab. Went for the mud crab instead. To be honest have had better as the sauce was slightly bland.
Then someone came into the restaurant and tried to sell us bags of crisps going from table to table. Wtf?

Very expensive and not worth it. Sorry"
Had seafood without getting hands messy!,Hard to get reservations as it’s really popular. Good service staff good food. Good place to bring visitors. Chilli crab meat in the sauce and deshelled prawns is a real winner
Worse experienced ever,"In short, waited over one hour for crab. It’s unbelievable. Food was ok however the time was unacceptable. Everyone else around you were eating except your table. After multiple times of chaser, our crab finally came."
Pleasant birthday lunch,"Celebrated my mum's birthday here with my family and we were seated near the window overlooking Shaw Tower. Opted for 1.2kg chili crab (mud crab) to be shared with 3 pax. Crab was fresh and the sauce was delicious. Also ordered salted egg prawn, siew mai & salted egg custard bun which were good but not memorable."
Standard of food and services reduced,"Jumbo/Ion was our family regular visit for birthday occasion. 06 Jan’23 was a shock to me. The crabs & cereal prawn cooking standard was very poor and seem not fresh. Services was poor & unfriendly. Seem a lot of old staff had resigned.
All unfamiliar faces. Tgis could be our last visit to this branch."
Good seafood variety but service needs much improvement,"VIP room booked and yet service was terrible.
- took at least 10 rings/buzzing to get some attention
- food served at lightning speed as if we are expected to swallow them.
- warned the chef to slow down and yet rest of the dishes came even faster n got cold.
- YET final fruit platter took a longer time to be served compared to the cooked dishes.
- bad impression left by overseas business visitors"
Good,Chili Crab is always good in Jumbo! Though it is a bit pricey. We enjoyed our dinner. The place is nice.
Disappointing Services,We were told that the chili crabs would take 40 minutes to prepare. We were advised to start with the other dishes. It turned out that the crab came out first and followed by all the other dishes. It was messy to eat crabs and the other dishes at the same time. Hopefully they can improve the communication between the kitchen staffs and the waiters/waitresses.
์Normal Alacarte not available,"I book the table on 14:30 but when I arrive the restaurant, the staff said it's available only Dim Sum."
New Year's Eve Dinner,Excellent food recommendations by staff. Service didn't disappoint. Will definitely visit again for family gatherings.
Crab is not fresh & overcharged,"Crab do not taste is live crab. Manager there have confirm is live crab. It is a big lier, they not even ask the kitchen. The crab serve definitely not live (kill once order), the crab serve is in fridge before. It is very easy to differentiate live crab & fridge crab. Live have more texture (爽口，弹牙，口感）， fridge crab is messy & creamy bite (肉棉棉，水水). Even hawker stall crab can taste more fresh & live than Jumbo.

Apart of that, the weight charge is 1kg. The crab not look like 1kg, maximum is 800gram or less. Maybe rope weight 200gram (I don’t know), I can show from picture."
Jumbo Ion,Chili crab was fresh and excellent. Kang Kong and Mee Goreng were excellent. Fried sotong portion was terribly small and not worth.
Dinner at jumbo ion,Had my dinner with my family during the weekday and the foods was great and the crowd wasn’t so much as such there enough staffing around to attend to you.
LUNCH AT JUMBO,The service was good and food too! The aircon is a bit too cold but overall it is ok. Enjoy the lunch
The price is too high,"Compare with last time we visit , the price is increased a lot, also there is no set meal offer for 4 person, so disappointed."
Overrated Seafood restaurant,"Ordered 2 crabs - Salted egg yolk crab was too dry and not much meat.
Award winning chilli crab (SGD $101.69)- The staff gave 800g for 4 pax (we did not specify the weight or size of the crab, recommend to ask for bigger crab even for 2 pax for those that still want to try this restaurant), the crab is small, not meaty, chilli sauce lacks the punch. Not as good as before.

Deep fried mini bun is pretty small and served cold.

One of the dish did not arrived despite us keeping asking the waitress. She also checked with the kitchen several times. After one and a half hour, we decided to cancel it and was told by another staff that the dish is not available when we ordered. I find that is just an excuse.

The prawn is good though.

Not worth going back."
Cleanliness is a concern with stained cups,3 out of 4 tea cups are with stains and the waitress told us is normal. Then change to 4 Chinese teacups. Again 3 out of 4 are with stains so approached the manager instead. She changed for us with no apologies and with an irritated face. Really wonder how can the cups not washed properly in such a reputable restaurant and is located in Ion Orchard
Afternoon dim sum set,"Food was great, service was great too...a great n unique dim sum selection...tasty too! Worth trying!! We really enjoyed our tea session with great ambience n nice dim sum."
Review of Jumbo Tim sum meal,Food is good. But we waited for almost an hour before food was served! The waiter explained that they were short handed in the kitchen for that day. They could have pre-informed customers so that we can decide if we want to dine there & willing to wait.
Must try restaurant,"Heard of the reputation for long time. Ordered 1 kg chilli mud crab and 2 small dishes for 4 people. Very good food, fresh, and tasty."
Will be back,"We enjoyed our Black Peppered Crab, salted egg prawns and sambal kangkong. It was a great way to celebrate my wife’s birthday"
Delicious,"Food (chili crab, scallops) was delicious and very friendly staffs. Highly recommended. A place to be !!!"
Yummy,"Family dinner, food served as good as usual.. we had a great night great dinner bonding. Will be back soon"
Yummy food !,"Great food, everything was yummy ! The service was average coz we had a hard time asking to change plate. Overall it was great ."
"Bad Service, Food ok but overpriced",Terrible service. They forgot about our order. After one hour the salad arrived. No apologies! Then they forgot about another dish. Therefor all the dishes arrived very late. In the meantime the waitresses were shouting through the whole restaurant and wiping the floor. I expect a decent service level for a 200 sgd dinner!
Dinner with family,Had a dinner with my family on a weekday. The foods was great especially the chilli crab and the service at ion seems to improve maybe due to less crowded
Dim sum afternoon tea,"The service staff were nice and helpful. Food was petite, cute, delicate and delicious as there were served warm. Ambience was classy and cosy to enjoy our afternoon tea."
Underwhelming quality,Premium pricing with underwhelming taste especially the salted egg prawn. Not fresh. Not going back.
Good location,"It is located in central, easy to reach via mrt, bus, and carpark fee in evening is lower than expected. Food and service quality is as good as other outlets."
Shortage of staff,Nobody answers phone calls. We reached 15 min before booked Time but nobody attend to us. Table service was poor.
High Tea,The foods were majority nice but too little…it’s just nice though…would be good to have more variety of drinks.
Great food but very misleading pricing,The food is delicious but ask for the total price of the crab before ordering. We were planning on getting the mud crab but the waiter kept pushing the Alaskan snow crab telling us it was almost 50% off and almost the same price. Well the crab came to ~$750 and discounted to over $500. Definitely not worth the money!!
Dim sum,The dim sum is very nice. Well prepared and displayed. Taste good. Some of their dim sum are nicely crafted
No if's and or but's,Simply Excellent. End of story. I had the chili Mud crab at the Riverside location which I loved. The next day I went to the ION Orchard location for the pepper Dungeness crab. Either location is great to enjoy some great crab.
Good seafood,"My 8th visit, the live Boston lobster braised with glass vermicelli in clay pot was good. Members get 30% off this month, a good deal.
The chilled mango sago pomelo was good too, like the small portion at SGD6 each.

After several visits here are my favorites:
Beef fillet with black pepper sauce.
Baby lamb rack grilled with pepper and honey sauce.
Live red tilapia deep fried with nonya sauce.
Mee goreng.
Chilled slice abalone.
Chilli crab meat with fried mantou.
Boston lobster.

This is my new account, same name and picture as the previous one.
First visited this place late last year."
"Servicing very bad , spoon and glass cup so dirty ,","Very disappointed , serving very bad , spoon , glass cup so dirty, glass panels near my sit was very dirty ."
Hight tea,We went for the High tea and the food was disappointed and service very poor. No top of tea and have to call many times for bill.
Jumbo at ION,Had a dinner on 25 sep with my family. The foods was great especially the crabs are of good quality. Will go there again
Great food- average service,"Food was really nice. We were encouraged to order small portions which turned out to be smaller than we would have liked. The food all tasted good however we had to ask a number of different waiters for our egg fried rice (which truly was delicious when it finally arrived)
Service was substandard- no one seemed to know what others were doing. We were asked about refill drinks by 3 different people, everyone checked our ticket and ignored the fact we were still waiting for a staple (the rice)
Overall the experience could have been better but that aside the food was delicious."
Bad service,"When asked about a smaller crab the waitress pushed to order a 1.2 KG crab for 2 pax. And when ordering '麥片蝦', the waitress did not specify it is with shells or without.
Who would know that the deshelled version is called '麥片蝦球'?
Lame service for a over 200 SGD meals in the fancy ION mall. Ridiculous."
Poor service,"Poor service. Made request to cut the lobster up into small pieces so that it's easier to eat for an 80 year old elderly. Request was not done. Food standard that day not as good as other days too. Restro was abit busy that day and seemed like short of staff, service very slow & had to keep putting up my hand to get the serving staff attention, but to no avail. Had to walk up to the staff in the end. Poor service!"
Hi Tea spot on!,The hi tea served is delicious and all the foods are on point! Worth the money spent! 2nd set of hi-tea 50% off for Jumbo members. Will be back again.
Nice environment.,Chili crab was really tasty. Too bad the garlic bamboo clam is out of stock. Worth the price and will definitely visit again.
Good food; but service is below par!,"This is our first visit to Jumbo Ion Orchard (probably our last, too). We ordered the high tea dim sum set for two. Food was okay but service was poor. We pressed the call bell on the table at least 3-4 times but no one attend to us and we ended up having to wave our hands for attention. The tea was served without the tea cups and we had to ask for them when the food was served. Not exactly the kind of service I expect for the price we are paying!"
Good but Pricey,"Had my birthday celebration there to enjoy the membership rewards. Food is good and with rewards is totally worth it. The outlet might be lack of manpower so when they are all busy, it is hard to get the attention from the staff."
Hi tea meal,Went to hi tea and ordered a bottle of champagne. Staff opened and it was warm so I requested an cold bottle instead they offered to put the opened poured champagne in the glasses in an ice bucket to cool. Terrible service
overall experience / 1st visit to Jumbo Ion,the garlic chicken doesn't taste like Garlic on it quite bland. but the australia lobsters are good also we paid by UOB card (there was a promo on this card)... however there was no $20 rebate although we have spent way above $80??
Jumbo Seafood High Tea,First time eating Jumbo seafood dim sum high tea. But two person high tea set only serve one pot of tea. For Man this high tea portion a bit small. Not bad can try.
Poor service,"Too expensive and poor service! We were asking for glasses, napkins, the food arrived late… staff unkind!"
Afternoon high tea,Be sure to make reservations for their high tea as it's always fully booked. High tea tier was nicely decorated. Food was nice and creative. Service could have been better improved and more attentive . Not much view to rave about too
Everything was OK!,"The foods were not too excellent but I like the sauce of the chilli crabs, the staffs are very approachable and friendly. ION Orchard view is something that I can blame about!"
Service,The foods is great but the service not as good as previous. We requested for chilli 4 times then waitress finally served us.
Great food!,"A great restaurant with many seafood options. From the crab to fish, prawns to tofu dishes, everything was delicious! We had a private room and the staff were highly attentive and we never had to worry about anything. I’d be back!"
Good seafood,"My 7th visit, repeat order for chilled sliced abalone and deep fried red tilapia with nonya sauce, not bad although not as good as the first time.
8th visit, the lobster noodles were good, using e-voucher 30% off, dish not in the regular menu, with the chilli sauce tasted pretty good.
9th visit, the fried mee goreng was good ，as good as the first time. The chilli crab meat sauce with fried mantou was also good."
Service,Waiter didn’t change the plate when my plate was full of garbage. I rang the bell many times but no waiter came
Great Dinner at Jumbo Ion,Great Customer Service from Sally Lim . Night scene of Orchard Road by the window . Food served hot and delicious ..
Nice experience,The ambience was nice and we got our request to be seated next to the window. Food was good and did not disappoint.
How long to cook chili crab,"Chili crab is the first one I orderd but I have to wait more than 1 hour, even though the food I add more I come alr, the chili crab still haven't come, I asked staff how long, they said 4-5 minutes. Ok I wait and wait more than 1 hour. No have any staff explain why my food come late. And I order dessert, I haven't told serve, staff served my dessert while I'm still eating, after that my dessert melt alr."
A restaurant that lives up to its name!,Had a great business lunch here with fellow colleagues! The service provided was exemplary and exceptional! Food was even better especially the huge lobster that we ordered! Every one of the dishes that we ordered was outstanding with great plating and presentation that wets our appetite even before we sunk our teeth into them! A truly great restaurant living up to its name!
Delicious food,Went there with family over the weekend. The food was still delicious but feel that the price is higher than before. Spent about $65 per person.
Tim Sum brunch,"We ordered Steamed Siew Mai , Cigar Popiah, steam Prawn Chee Cheong Fan, steam prawn spinach dumplings , steamed Har Gao and Fried XO carrot cake and two Pu Er tea. The tea was presented on a burner to keep it constantly warm .
Total bill was $56 plus, it’s reasonable and the ambience is good . We were offered a window seat and can enjoy the view while eating . Reservations is necessary as even weekday the restaurant was nearly full. The service was attentive and polite . It was a pleasant experience ."
Delicious!!,"This is the best of seafood, I love very much, I will come back to eat again, Crab in black pepper is very good."
Poor Service,"Waitress didnt take correct order, not attentive. Disappointed. Not keen to visit again though location is convenient. Expensive and not worth."
The fried chicken was not available and made known to us after a long 20 minutes wait .. should have informed us at poin,The fried chicken was not available and made known to us after a long 20 minutes wait .. should have informed us at poinT of ordering and not after we waiting for 20 minutes .. the table next to us ordered the same time as us and they were served chicken without issue and manager only informed us after the same fired chicken is served to the table first .. why infogg Fh m us only then .. making us wait 20 minutes.. not good service .. but your cod fish and scallop were delicious.. Thank God
The best Chilli Crab i've ever had!,My fave resto for Chilli Crab. I always visit and enjoy the food whenever I visit Singapore. Will come again for sure!
Afternoon high tea,"Good food. Good service, friendly staff. Perfect serving size for afternoon tea. Will revisit in future"
A nice seafood gem inside Orchard ION!,"Fantastic seafood spot inside the mall! Seriously enjoyed the hot chili crab, cigar prawn spring rolls, and black pepper beef and of course the buns to soak up the chili. Timely, tasty, and good service. It was busy on Saturday early afternoon so suggest a reservation anytime you plan to visit"
Probably won't visit again,Food was good but the service was average. It is a bit different from the one in Clarke Quay where both food and service are great.
Chili crab and cold wine,As always another great lunch at Jumbo. Chili crab meat sauce and mantou a regular favorite. Can’t beat the fried rice.
Crabbbbb,Good service and good food…… Superb Singaporean Chili Crab. Worth every cent and calorie…… Nice ambiance. Fast Service
Crowded and Short Handed,"The promotion advert in the restaurant website is not clear and misleading. The afternoon high tea promotion didn’t state the timing in the website and T&C. We only found out that it’s applicable after 2:30pm. Restaurant was crowded and short handed. The service bell on the table basically serve no purpose because no one respond to it and have to still wave your hands to get attention. Understand it’s the new beginning after covid and short handed, hope the restaurant can improve this. The outlet I visited was ION."
Must visit,Food was excellent - we truly enjoyed the chili and black pepper crabs and the cereal prawn. Service was very good and place was very clean.
Dinner,Food was good and staff was friendly and well trained. The waiting time was long however it was expected as there are many dine in customers
Nice Dim Sum,Celebrated my friend birthday at this restaurant. The staff is nice to provide a candle and lighter upon request. The Dim Sum Set is nice.
"Average high tea, small quantity and more towards savory side","For the price, it’s considered very small portions and definitely will not have your fill even u go after lunch. It’s just more like tasting abit more unique dim sum. Considering the atmosphere, it’s still consider ok."
Jumbo with family,Finally had a dinner with family of 10. The dishes were great especially the chilli crabs. The 1.4kg female crab was fantastic
service,"food was nice, entrance staff is welcoming and good. but the serving staff service were discounted.
the front desk staff got me a table, i sat for quite awhile doing my work via phone, after about 20 mins, realised that we have not taken our order, i buzzled the button few times, intermittently, no one come, then i waved but seems we are transparent, but in the end one lady came and i told her we order set X 2. Then waited agan, long wait, at lease another 30 min. i waved but no notice from waitress or supervisor, Then i have to go to the front counter staff to ask for assistance, then they served our order and said they missed out our order. I sat on the table at 4.05pm, high tea served at 4.55 pm. if someone came to inform there is delayed, we are fine and understand, we are not difficult but the supervisor and waitress are giving a lot of attention only to few tables in the middle of the restaurant, We are just being left aside at the corner. Just Airing my view-- customers are all the same, no double standard, we pay the same too. jumbo in East coast is so different, serving large crowd, waited for sit and serving but the staff care to come forward to inform, thumbs up for the team there."
Dim sum set,We enjoy the dim sum very much it was well prepared. Can we ask you bring back the dim sum set & we do not mind you charge more like $59.90 instead of $49.90
Generally good!,"We came late but every thing seemed so nice, the foods were still well-prepared and served. We order a 1.6kg mud crab for 02 plates and they turned out perfect!"
Dimsum Afternoon Tea,Promtion with 4 Pax 1 dine free set. The Dimsum is good. In the end we ordered 4 more dimsum from ala carte menu. Should give it a try if you like dimsum.
Great fun family night,I enjoyed the experience with my family. Although y is a bit messy but good fun also. I will love to get back again when I am back in Singapore.
yummy,"food is yummy, but just ala carte will do. the high tea set is not worth the price. staffs are prompt too!"
Disappointed,Ordered dim sum afternoon tea set. Food served was cold and service was slow despite multiple request.
High tea,"High tea set i find a bit oily, if u could reduce the oil quantity that would be great. Would also suggest more varieties on the high tea set"
Cozy Vibes to dine in,Got seated right away after arriving at the restaurant even though I was late for my appointment during the peak hour. Great service and food is fantastic!
Jumbo - ION,"Jumbo has a reputation for excellent food and this visit to their venue in Ion was no exception. The Mocha Ribs were outstanding. Highly recommend them.
Service is average. Not to the level of the quality of food. The Venue by the Sea is much more our style but overall it continues to be a good experience."
Good seafood dinner,"Fourth visit, the red tilapia deep fried with nonya sauce was really good, fish very fresh. The beef fillet with black pepper sauce and chilled sliced abalone were good.

Fifth visit, the chilli crab meat sauce with sliced fried mantou not bad, better than the whole crab which I had on my first visit. The salted egg prawns about the same standard as my coffee shop zi char stall. The mocha pork ribs were lousy.

Sixth visit, the mee goreng not bad, but at SGD24, worth it ? The fried cod fish, a very small piece, not worth it.

Normal customer service."
Always great,We live across the street fro this restaurant and eat there frequently. Many choices down menu after crabs and lobsters. The best seafood fried rice anywhere. Great service from Su Ying and Tom Xiang.
Amazing food and service.,My husband and I were super impressed by the quality of food. Everything was delicious. Chilli crab is a must try!
Really nice chilli crab,"I ordered a chilli crab, stream fish and salted egg yolk bun for lunch with my wife. No regrets on my orders. The staffs are nice to wait for us to make the last order (at 2pm). Will definitely dine again."
Salted Egg Alaska Crab,"Love the ambience! Request for window view. All the food we ordered was tasty! We had bamboo clam, Australian lobster, 3 head abalone, home made beancurd with crab meat. Everything was superb. Loved the dessert too! Mango sago and Peach Resin. Was so refreshing. Will definitely make a come back! Staff were attentive too!"
Excellent Food,JUMBO Seafood at ion as usual display their top notch food quality. Their service is excellent as well too. Definitely a must visit place if you want to eat chilli crab in Singapore!
Gave a feedback,Gave a feedback to the assistant manager about the mud crab due to the crab was not I was expect from the past visit she told all her staff about this. Every staff walks pass our table will look at it. All eyes was on our table. The atmosphere was so terrible and so discomfort where when we are eating they look at bus and some even laughing. We can't stand the discomfort and atmosphere as we don't feel welcome. We stop eating half way and planned to take away the food as we felt very discomfort. When we ask the waiter for take away. The waiter he took our plate and show the assistant manager his action like telling her 'see what's this' before packing up for us. this meal cost a whooping $350++ I didn't expect to experience such service from this restaurant.
Food and Atmosphere,Overall the food is salty and prices is quite expensive but the service is good and have a nice ambience especially sitting near the window.
Dinner,The food is not value for money and seafood no fresh. Is very disappointed for my first trip here. I will never be here again.
