Buffet at Carousel,"This place has the most excellent buffet spread: seafood, Japanese, chinese, western, and Indian cuisine. The seafood is very fresh, love the Oyster the most, juicy and huge. Their sashimi is awesome too. The cheese spread has a good variety to choose from. They also have a live station to cook your choice of pasta. The Indian station has long grain bryani rice, butter curry chicken and grilled chicken, very tasty. The ice cream are creamy and nice. The only reason I gave 4 stars was the price, it is $98++ for weekend dinner, a bit pricey."
Great service,"I would like to compliment Sherelin Raj and her team for excellent service for our dining at Carousel Restaurant, Royal Plaza on Scotts, Singapore. Great service by Meghala and team, too!"
Can be better to uphold the Carousel name.,Went there for a buffet breakfast at $25++ per person. The selection is not too bad. Egg station can be better. Hot drinks selection n juices adequate. Cooked dishes can be improved. Bread selection is enough.
Great variety of buffet spread,Busy and large crowd of big groups dining in. Huge variety at the buffet spread. Servers Raja and Rajeev were attentive and friendly. Thanks!
Just a meal,"Great Service for our section along the glass panel that has view of Hyatt hotel opposite was excellent, both a young Malay lady and an Indian senior staff service was tip top. Unfortunately my wife dont get used to such type of buffet style, which foods is been serve instead of self service. Raw fish Sashimi is tastless (Frozen), Chefs at Asian foods section was very helpful and friendly."
False advertising,"""Voted best buffet restaurant in Singapore"" by who? The ambience is completely lacking. It is comparable to a Swensen's in appearance. The offerings were an odd collection of low quality budget foods from various regions. The seafood spread was an unusual combination of soggy and over cooked. There were no condiments for them. When we requested cocktail sauce, butter or even soy sauce for our chilled seafood we were handed a single serving packet of mayonnaise for the table. The coffee and tea selection is better at McDonald's."
Local High Tea,"We went for high tea on a weekday and the place is fully booked. Place is big and noisy. Spread of food is mainly local dishes. No WoW effect for the foods. However, service is good. Staff are attentive."
"Food quality compromised, not value for money","Went there for their hi tea buffet. The actual offerings somehow didn‚Äôt match the offerings published online for their hi tea menu. It was generally very cheap quality food for the price of the buffet.

Also turned off by the waitstaff, hi tea buffet was indicated to be 3-5pm. At around 4.15pm, one of the staff came to ask to settle the bill, and at 4.45pm we were reminded to leave by 5pm.

There‚Äôs better buffets with better food and service out there."
Service degraded,"The services on Carousel has degraded as compared 2 years ago. Bill started to 'pop in' by the waiter in the middle of diners conversation with interruption.

We requested for a small slice of cake for the Birthday celebrant but was rejected by the waiter immediately. Coffee and Tea were not server promptly."
Nice dinner buffet,"Dinner buffet started at 6pm and the queue before entering the restaurant is a breeze. We tap our TraceTogether & show our vaccination status, then present SMS from Carousel stating our table number which we were ushered to.

Staff did a good job in explaining the safe distancing measures in Carousel.

Hot drinks are available free. You just have to scan the QR code available on the table to view the drinks menu. A seperate electronic menu is available for ordering soft drinks, wine etc. at a price.

Food variety is good but abit lesser than before Covid times. For example the dessert choices are not much from the trolly going around; handled by the cheerful staffs. Condiments for icecream such as peanuts, sprinkles are not available. Only chocolate sauce.

Buffet food are served by the ever enthusiastic staffs there. You can just inform them how many servings you need.

The bread & butter pudding are worth trying!

Good customer service with staffs asking how the food was & smile when passing by us. Even Mr Abraham Tan (I frequented RP for years thus I know some of their staffs‚Äô names) lend a helping hand in helping his colleagues when the queue for food is forming.

Overall food & ambience are excellent as always even though things have changed but we understand.

We shall return for our staycation once RP is done with their SHN thingy."
The buffet dinner is fabulous,"This place has an enormous amount of food to eat, plenty of choices to choose from. The ambiance is the perfect setting for any occasion."
Dinner Buffet,"Fresh seafoods! Table will be allocated through sms before you arrive. There will be less contact between guests and staffs which is a very good move. Wanted to change to a bigger table when we arrived and because the crowd have not came in so we got it. The senior staffs are very friendly and hardworking. They will get for you the food at the countet so basically it is not self service. Even the hot drinks will be ordered through the staff and they will bring it to your table. The mini desserts will be serve to your table. They will bring it around for you to choose. Although it was a weekday, it was still packed. Had a great time eating all oysters!"
"Super cozy, Good service, Clean","This restaurant is great, the place super cozy , the food here was amazing, tasty it was delicious .Best service and friendly staff"
Wonderful dinner nite,"Wonderful customer service by mr.Nalan, me n my husband really enjoyed our food .will definitely come back again .kudos for the team üëèüèªüëèüèª"
Birthday Celebration for Sister and Sister-In-Law!,"We had to adhere to strict measures due to the pandemic and the hotel/restaurant did great in following protocol making sure safety was not compromise for the guests as well as the employees which was truly commendable.

Nevertheless we had a splendid time at this premise! Since there were 6 of us, we were place in a private room. Ordering through the restaurant app was a breeze indeed. Food ordered was timely and in great portion. Most importantly the quality of food was not compromised and it was delicious. The staff were super friendly, jovial, approachable and warm. Great job there Carousel and keep it going!"
The Best,"As always, the food, service and ambience hits the spot. Still the best. But due to COVID restrictions, couldnt explore the buffet line. butstill worth it."
Service Crew all round is Excellent!!,"Went there with the family seated at table V2. Mr Das explained to us the rules of the buffet slowly and clearly. He was friendly, polite and dedicated. Then we met Lynn who was also kind and polite to my mum especially. I felt the whole team including the chef for Chicken Rice was friendly and committed. Its has been a while I met an entire crew team of an F&B establishment who is consistent and took pride in their work. They are friendly, thoughtful!! I met with a Ms Angkhana who was ever so kind and told my mum to take the lift instead of the stairs. She was very concerned about my mums leg as she has a problem with her knee. Been to the hotel several times and the service this time is just exceptional. Thank you to the team for a memorable dining experience."
So so experience,"While the food was quite nice, I feel the meat section could have been better. There should have been more unusual and posh desserts too. The experience was not anything to shout about. Overall, we did enjoy the food but the whole experience was marred by music of only one type. We would have liked to hear music of a greater variety. We were unfortunately put at the table just below the loud speakers and therefore conversation was almost impossible. Please take note of these pointers and improve in these areas. Otherwise it would have been a waste of my time writing to you."
Great customer experience !,"Excellente buffet : variety and quality ! But more importantly, great service ! Especially Raja who served us like if we were king and Queen ! Thanks. Great customer experience from the entry to the bill. I will be back tomorrow ! Thanks again !"
Good to be back. overall nice food and cosy ambience!,"It has been more than 10 years since our last visit here and with the recent reopening, we decided to come by to try the buffet. It was a weekend and the restaurant was almost full house.

Upon arrival at the main entrance of the hotel, and after doing the temperature check and safe entry, we were told of our table number before heading to the restaurant. This was good, much better than have to queue again to register before heading in.

The restaurant is more cosy and nice, with orange theme, bright and very lovely. Staff were very friendly and efficient and credit must go to everyone which many earlier reviewers have mentioned too!

As for the food, the spread was quite good, at least better than Lime (Parkroyal Pickering), the previous week we went to. It was so pathetic there. The spread here covers local, asian, western dishes and most were nice and yummy. Of course, there were ""hits and misses"" but overall, they were good.

Some of the food that left us deep impression included the herbal chicken soup, seafood, the prawn paste chicken, grilled fish (salmon), stir fried vegetables, pastries (the cakes, macarons, ice cream etc). As for those that were off the mark, they were the chicken rice (cold and the rice was bland), bryani rice and chicken (the rice was not fragrant as it should be and not warm too and chicken too hard), and eu foo noodles, too bland and cold.

For the pastries, they were served by staff pushing trolleys and do not worry, they have a few going around and we won't be missed out! But if you have a sweet tooth, save it for them, you won't be disappointed for sure!

In terms of improvement, since it's a halal restaurant, maybe they should include more halal food or local food like satay, rojak, kembing soup (mutton soup), popiah etc, that would be imperfect.

Service wise, as mentioned, great and lovely service!

Value for money, yes, as now we have 50% discount for senior citizens (60 and above) and so it's quite a good bargain!

And one feedback that I hope the hotel would look into. Due to Covid19, the lobby has been fenced off and for diners who needed to use the washrooms, they are located on the 2nd storey (actually they have on the lobby but was fenced off) and so they will have to walk up/down the winding flight of stairs and making things worst, there's only 1 cubicle for each for the man/woman and 1 for the handicapped. So can you imagine the wait as the buffet proceed into the half and one hour and beyond (considering the restaurant is full house, notwithstanding that the staff and customers of the hair and beauty salon/conference rooms on the 2nd storey are also using the same washroom).

Other than this, I think we have had a wonderful lunch and will return again soon tapping on the promotions, possibly this week again. Hopefully this review will allow the staff and management ample time to look into and improve it's service offerings!"
"Exceptional service, just bad food","The menu is bad, the service was excellent. I am appalled. The discount helped to soothe the pain of having to pay for such an excruciating dining experience with my friends. And the worst part was that I recommended the place. This is actually the first time that I have had to allow myself the liberty to speak my mind for the this establishment to pull up its socks and re-examine it‚Äôs hopeless menu. If it weren‚Äôt for the excellent waiting and staff, Carousel would‚Äôve gone down in flames. I‚Äôve been here once pre-COVID and this current setting with its menu and pricing pales in comparison to its former glory. I am so upset having to spend an evening with my friends at a place where we could‚Äôve been elsewhere really enjoying our dining experience. Please really look into your menu and the food. It‚Äôs salty, just bad, a better experience could be had at the local hawker‚Äôs. I am on the overall displeased with my spending and I am sad that with the excellent staff, less than mediocre standard food was being served. I am a foodie, a lover of culinary delights and this just doesn‚Äôt cut it. Please don‚Äôt take my word for it. Just be prepared when you see the menu and actual dishes served to you. Be positive I say, always but also do not expect anything. My apologies for the rant but I am hopeful that Carousel aims higher and takes care of its offerings before it joins the majority of the food and beverage, as well as retail industry everywhere. Kudos to the exceptional service though!"
Fantastic,"Service was very prompt and the alacarte buffet menu was superb with the variety and the dishes were very tasty. Additionally, I would like to specially compliment this one particular service staff named Mary Lum, she not only answer to all our enquirers quickly, but also had a very friendly and cheerful disposition towards us and asked us if we needed anything. She also provided my child with a special order of mantou as she saw that she was enjoying it a lot. Overall it was an excellent dining experience ."
Disappointing,"We used to visit this place regularly, food was amazing and service top notch. We went for Christmas lunch buffet: what a disappointment ! Limited choice in the menu, main dishes lukewarm and tasteless. The staff didn‚Äôt announce last order and we were stuck without having time to order our desserts. A staff lady was nice enough to bring us few pieces of cake. The bread and butter pudding looked old.

On top of that very poor and cheap Christmas decoration, and no ambience"
Generally good experience and service,"In general, the ala carte buffet food is good and the service staff tried their best to be prompt. However, there were some slight problems in using the food order site to track what was ordered at the table in total. Hence, at times, it was difficult to determine if our orders arrived accurately."
"Few years ago, it was my favourite","Few years ago, it was my favourite buffet restaurant. Until there‚Äôs 1 year that I heard there are changes to the head chef. Seafood beginning not fresh. Hope they have improved by now."
Our favourite buffet hotel,Our favourite buffet hotel restaurant eversince. We are always satisfied and very happy visiting the restaurant. Kids and adult love the spread and generous.. üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü
Quality food and good place for gathering,Me and my friends visited Carousel for dinner and this is a great place for having quality food and chitchat with friends after a long day at work. Price is on a higher side but well worth it! The service staff are Excellent as well.
Wide variety of foods and great service,"Quality and diversity of food is mind-boggling with sumptuous Asian and Mediterranean buffets, the food served is catered to every conceivable taste. Would have preferred the seating space be further apart between tables. Holding a birthday celebration for birthday person is a moment when all the staff make a circle and sing ‚Äúhappy birthday‚Äù song which adds a heartwarming atmosphere to a memorable party."
Corporate event,"The food was good and there was a large variety of cooked dishes and seafood to choose from. Unfortunately, there was a limit of 1 hour for our company to eat as we had to share the lunch slot with another company, else I would have gotten more time to savour a more variety of their dishes properly."
Buffet lunch,Worth the price after discount. Went ard noon full spread. Good dessert..cakes..sashimi Worth it. Personally i loved the laksa and the japanese section. Nice drinks included..mix soda
halal buffet,1 of the rare but good halal buffet places you can find. especially its located in the middle of Orchard Road.
Lobster n Crab Feast?..Really?,Went for the Lobster n Crab promo on 23Feb but it was disappointing. Food like paella was extremely salty. Cold seafood like the lobster was chewy/hard. Lamb roast was overcooked. Chicken was dry. Overall food quality poor. Tasted better.
Company dept lunch,A lot of variety. But the quality of the sashimi not as good as expected. The other Asian food ok. Not to complain based on the price. But can be better.
Disappointing High-Tea Experience,"It has been awhile since I have been to Carousel and I have to say that the standards of their food and dining experience have dropped. Despite the large variety of food served at high tea, the majority of which were heavy items and were more appropriate for lunch/dinner.

Was really looking forward to some nice pastries & finger food. The sandwiches had pathetic amounts of filling that could barely be seen. The dessert selection was very unappetizing and the entire spread looked effortless.

Also, we were asked to make payment about an hour into the buffet, not sure what is the hurry.

Even the coffee was off; did not get a chance to try hot chocolate/mocha as the chocolate powder in the machine was empty and not refilled.

The environment was also very noisy with loud music, not a good place to catch up with friends over a high tea session.

The only nice food I had was the muah chee."
Hi-Tea with family,"Had a great hi-tea with the family at Carousel Royal Plaza on Scotts. Lots of delicious food and desserts. The place was nice and service fantastic. Will have another visit soon, maybe lunch or dinner, reservation is advised as the restaurant is full all the time even in this present situation. ...well done Carousel."
February - High Tea,"We went for the high tea for our son's birthday on 2 Feb with table L14, and we could see the standard of service has dropped. The other waiters and waitress seems 'busy' all the time, except the 2 Indian Waiters (with specs) and one newbie (small girl) who seems to juggle the workload. The food was OK except the chili crabs we found its not that fresh. There seems no enthusiasm during the singing of the birthday songs. The feeling was just different from the last time we were there. Hope it will improved as Carousel is one of our favorite dining place. Thank you!"
Best Halal Buffet in Singapore,"This has got to be the best halal buffet in Singapore. Service was excellent and the food was amazing. Especially love the oyster omelette, fried carrot cake and the lava cake was to die for. I also love how they celebrate birthdays and anniversaries for their guests. A definite must try experience for everyone."
Grilled meats are nice,"This is a very popular halal buffet option. I like the cleanliness, the nice spacious seating and the efficient service staff. The empty plates are cleared from the table quickly even when it is crowded. The food is replaced as quickly as possible. The leg of lamb, chicken and lamb kebabs are grilled to perfection. The artichoke tagine and grilled pineapples are very nice. The slipper lobsters and scallops are served in generous portion. Lots of sushi to choose from. The chestnut tart and creme br√ªl√©e are excellent. Nice selection of teas and fresh fruits."
New Years Eve buffet dinner - outstanding food and service,"We were staying at Royal Plaza on Scotts so decided to have dinner there for New Years Eve. The selection of international food was excellent. The seafood was fresh. There was hot and cold to choose from. Japanese teppanyaki, sashimi was outstanding. The number of desserts to choose from was amazing - it really was the best buffet dinner I've ever been too, anywhere in the world. Well done and a must if you love any type of food as there is something for everyone. The staff were amazing - always there to fill your glass with wine (BYO) and always smilling."
4 stars if you're only talking Halal buffet; 3 stars if competing with other hotels,"Nice space, fresh seafood but overall the rest is very average. However, amongst the Halal eateries, this is definitely one of the best buffets in town. If your appetite isn't that big though, there are better representations of individual dishes out there and better buffets (non-Halal) for big eaters."
Halal + Fresh Seafoods!,"Best choices for halal buffet, you can find all international and local cuisine from western, chinese, Indian, etc. Be pamper on the sweet desserts & chocolate fountains X 3"
Fabulous Christmas Eve Dinner,One of the widest variety of buffet stations ever with great quality food and superb service! Good price too with special tie ups with credit cards! Will definitely dine at Carousel again!
Year end company buffet,"Nice spread of international fare. Seafood is the most popular station. Oysters, prawns, lobster, and lots more."
Carousel Restaurant,"The restaurant has a promotion (50% discount) for those 60 years old and above. The food is nice and with this promotion, it is good value for money."
Friends gathering,We went there for the buffet dinner. Total of 40 persons. The staffs were very attentive and efficient in their service.we had a great time .
First time,"Visited the place the first time after recommendation from tripadvisor. The staff were helpful. The staff welcomed us to the buffet, helped cleared our used plates efficiently. The lobster was good, wished they had prepared more choices of dishes for the lobster."
Repeated Visit to Carousel Buffet,"Carousel's is our favourite place where we visited every 2 month. We will normally take turn to do online booking or call in to reserve the seat. We came early today and sat in the hotel lobby to wait. As usual we have 10 to 15 person for each visit

The food variety compare to last round actually become lesser and mostly is warm and not hot.  This is definitely not base on my own experience but more of us who visited Carousel so many times.  Hope to see more different varieties of food. This will definitely make us wanted to visit every 1 to 2 month for gathering, makam session. But we impressed as we are normally given a bigger room during our visit .Overall experience today is 8/10 and we look forward for a better guest experience the next round.  We will definitely be back again. Looking forward for Christmas Gathering"
never regretting this decision.,i visited carousel last year for my mums bday and i am coming again in 2 weeks for my mums bday again! i was really blown away by the customer service ettiqutte that your staff has shown. i am very very satisfied with the selection of food and seafood. seafood was super fresh! i cant wait to be back here every year to celebrate my mums bday! and super thankful for the staffs that sang a birthday song and danced along! i will never regret choosing this place for a birthday celebration. keep it up carousel!! to many more years!
Nice Food,All the food buffet is good. u must try it..Their waiter and waittess is very friendly too. They have theme buffet too.
Wide range of food,"The choice of food is great! They have seafood range, sushi, indian, western. Too overwhelm of variety and not enough time to eat. Good choice if you are not rushing for time."
Great buffet - something for everyone,"We tried to get a table but were told it was fully booked. We then approached the hotel concierge who got us a table & when we sat down, saw a few tables empty around us that were not taken for the next 2 hours. Maybe the staff were a bit lazy?
The food was wonderful - great fresh seafood & a huge choice of hot mains - lots of vegetarian dishes & assorted meats. The desserts were fabulous too - great unusual choices & ice creams."
Birthday celebration,We had our birthday celebration here and the food was great. Lots of variety and never get tired visiting this place
Limited seats,I was surprised that most of the section was closed. It is the same old buffet and nothing has changed much. I was given a table near the clearing area. There were no other bigger tables available. Plus I couldn‚Äôt find the carpark! I was very annoyed as I could have had a complimentary parking. Tour buses blocked the entrance and there is a big blue dustbin which concealed the entrance to the carpark. Can something be done about it? Make the carpark signs more visible.
Perfect place for birthday celebration,Carousel provides a wide variety of food and i am totally amazed by the seafood available in the dinner session! I reccomend this place for birthday celebration!
Great Buffet,"This place gets very busy. Large variety of food and the seafood is very fresh, loved the meats and salads. I was too full to have any desserts, next time though."
Worth every penny!!,"The variety of food is outstanding. Nothing bad to review about this place.The only thing is,I hoped they will bring back the dessert fondues back and more variety for the ice - creams.Maybe gelato as well?"
It's ok,"In terms of buffets i'm afraid this isn't up there with the best. We did this with work recently and was pretty disappointed, food was mediocre and the selection was odd. The atmosphere isn't great either, it's not very inviting. If you need to do a buffet in the area then you're better at the Hyatt but even then it's not that much better...go further afield and do Pan Pacific or MO."
"Pricey, but it's just one of the best buffet I've tried",Huge variety of good food. The seafood is fresh and I love the desserts. Make sure you go early with an empty stomach.
Priced at a worthy premium,"5 star buffet in a 5 star restaurant. Great selection of seafood,cooked good and desserts. The subsets of seafood are raw seafood and cooked seafood. The subsets of desserts are yummy cakes, ice creams and pastries. As for cooked food, the chicken rice is fantastic and the cooked food section consists of Mediterranean, Asian and European foods. Great place to tease all parts of the palette"
First & last time visiting Carousel,"My wife and I had been looking forward to this dining experience, and we chose her birthday occasion for this.The service staff was a great bunch and we are pleased with their encounter. The variety, choice and quality of most hot dishes were great. The seafood however, left much to be desired. The tiny half lobsters/or crayfish was soggy and flaky in texture, quite obviously not of the fresh variant. The blue crabs were by far the worst. The meat fell apart like mud in my hands and felt like clay in the mouth. After my feedback to service staff, there was apparently no followup. They kept serving the same stale crabs. I was rather astonished actually at the poor quality of seafood on offer. Both my wife and I agreed: it was no good value for money, Carousel is definitely over-rated, and we will never step foot into this restaurant again."
Lunch buffet whilst on business,"Wide selection of food: Indian, Med, Chinese, Pasta Counter, Seafood counter, Sashimi Counter, Teppanyaki! Kudos to Teppanyaki stir fry which tasted delicious. Seafood selection was good.
However there was not much of wow factor to the spread, dishes seemed monotonous after 2nd day of eating at the buffet.

Loved the water taps which enabled access of water without attention of wait crew! Lunch buffet seemed a little chaotic at times due to overcrowded buffet crowd, would have appreciated managers coming around to get feedback on buffet for improvement etc.

This spread is definitely sufficient, but would like to see more changes to keep old customers returning back to this restaurant for its buffet."
HUGE SPREAD,"There was so much food! Couldn't try everything in 1 sitting! We were there for a family celebration & hope to try the cold seafood as there was so much to eat, hence had to skip this station (weep)."
Good variety,"Good variety of food and seafood selection. Food was refilled relatively fast, but taste is quite average. Price is on the higher side."
Best Seafood buffet ever!,‚ÄúCarousel‚Äù is top of the top! If you are a seafood lover definitely try the seafood buffet served every Sunday and Monday!!! You will not regret it!!
Fun desserts,Thoroughly enjoyed the dessert offerings. Some birthday was on the other table so the staff did a celebratory for them. Was nice. The ambience is so lively and warm.and staff is wlvery hospitable
LOUSY AF!!!,"Seafood not that fresh.
Lobster is more like crayfish.
And it was so unfresh that the skin stuck to the meat
Basically just a tasteless piece of steamed or boiled meat. Also the poop was not dug out. Its disgusting to even start eating it. I give up on seafood after that.

Went on to italian. Aglio olio sucks. Basically just spaghetti fried in oil. Freaking oily, not salty enough and no garlic. Tasteless oily noodle is all it is.

Big pot of seafood pasta that sits there for hours. Seafood is not fresh, of course.

Food always running empty with slow or no refill. Look at these glorious constantly EMPTY containers

Pathetic sushi spread (if u can call it a spread)
Dont even have salmon sushi - thats like THE most basic and typical sushi item

Goes without saying there is no unagi

Baked fish FAIL. Fish is not fresh, tasteless and bcos its not fresh, they used overwhelmingly strong herbs and seasoning to cover that up. All you can taste is some weird herb smell

Generally tasteless food, i can have better food at home

Creme brulee texture was okay, but are they trying to cut cost or something? The portion was off balanced, too much sugar on the top, insufficient creme at the bottom makes it too sweet. And the top was burnt until the sugar turned bitter

Cakes is a far cry from a decent cake.

No JUICES. Fruit juice charge $8 per cup like wtf. Carousel are you broke or WHAT?! $90 buffet but you so Bankrupt that you cant afford to serve juices?
Get lost, Carousel.

Supposedly one of the most atas buffet in Singapore has seats crammed like KOPITIAM and noisy like PASAR! You should be ASHAMED!!!"
Good quality of food,"If you are the seafood lover, you will like this very much. They serve variety of nice seafood. One thing I like pretty much was their kaya toast ice cream.
Other than that, they do serve lots of different food. Too bad, most of the space was kept for seafood, I only tasted some of their hot dishes."
Great food & great environment & people,"The food here is good & varieties; Western, Chinese, Malay, Indian, you name it . I love the environment, calm & peace of mind. I love the coffee too The people there are friendly & helpful High recommended restaurant"
Birthday feast,"First time I went to this lobster and crab buffet, the seafood is very fresh, I ate lots of lobsters and crabs and oysters, they top up very fast, you won't get nothing or queue for the food, variety of food also alot and the staffs are all very friendly too. I will definitely go again."
Dinner,"Good spread of buffet. Value for money and great ambience. For Muslim, there is a prayer room available near the exit to the carpark. Very convenient to get to the place. Near MRT station and bus station for those who wants to get there by public transport."
Disappointing food at exorbitant price,"I was really disappointed at the food and having to pay such a hefty price for the terrible taste. The international spread didn't taste like any of the authentic food I've had and the Chinese food was so horribly cooked that the hawker food is better. Trust me, I've had had many buffet in Singapore and Australia. The Equinox at Swissotel charges the same price and has far better tasting food. The Epicurean at Crown Towers in Perth charges the same price and there is a generous spread of seafood. To top it off, the place was like a school canteen in the 1970s. I would never go there again."
Not bad,I have had better but I have also had worse. It was a little expensive for what we got. There was a good selection of different foods.
There‚Äôs Quantity but not Quality,"Went there for a company dinner. Though there‚Äôs a lot of choices of food, not all of them are great and of quality. The paella was a total fail. Most of us felt that it tasted like chlorine. The buns that came along with the chilli crab were hard. Not sure what coffee they used but it‚Äôs also not that nice. The only great station was the Indian food. For the price paid and quality offered, definitely not justifiable. Just because it‚Äôs a lobster night didn‚Äôt mean the charges must go up so high to cover the cost that the restaurant incurred. Hope the management can look into this area."
One of the best!,"Definitely one of the best buffets in Singapore for lunch!
The selection of foods is great and very fresh.

The staff were attentive and very welcoming. We finished up in about an hour and the lovely lady at the front invited us back in and made sure we had tried the desserts.

Will definitely be returning!"
One of the top 3 lunch buffets served in a hotel and certified halal too,"Situated at the Royal Plaza on Scott‚Äôs, the buffet spread at Carousel is mind boggling..:::it features Mediterranean, Asian, Japanese fare, a diverse seafood spread and more.

Huge seating capacity but don‚Äôt take that for granted. Always make reservations ahead of time because the wait list can be long for peak seasons.

All food at Carousel is prepared in Halal-certified kitchens, which makes it a popular choice when you have Muslim friends, guests or business clients to entertain."
Not the same anymore,"Service crews are superb! Attentive and polite.
The food standard i would say not as good as before. Last visit was about 2 years ago.
The Nasi Lemak rice is cold & hard.
The Wu Xiang meehoon is already harden by 4:30pm
Maki is too thick with rice. Chilli crab.... hmm nothing fantastic
What still keeps my hope high was
Chicken rice, fresh sashimi and seafood, dessert spread."
"Fantastic Service, thoughtful staff and good food","‚úì Service/Staff

Our family had arrived later than expected for high tea buffet. In fact, we only had an hour before the buffet closed.. so we had an hour to get our food, feed our toddler, take care of a baby and still find time to eat before the stations closed.

One of the staff (i'm sorry I didn't get her name!) was so kind. She took the initiative to ask our 3 year old if he wanted juice, and she asked if he was OK with chicken rice. Then she proceeded to serve our boy a portion of chicken rice and some juice. It saved us quite a fair amount of time and the food kept him occupied while the adults took turns to leave the table. She also rescued my baby's blankie and very lovingly covered the baby with the blankie while we juggled our food/toddler. I am very VERY grateful for her help!

Other serving staff were polite and professional at all times as well!

‚úì Food

There was a good selection of food. I love how fresh the crabs were, the oyster omelette was yummy, and the whole family enjoyed the food."
Family gathering dinner,"The food has many varieties, Asian and Continental style and the ambience is nice and cosy. The staffs are friendly and helpful."

Great buffet that's Halal certified,Perfect place for a group with varied dietary requirements! Wonderful choices and delicious desserts.
Standard breakfast,"We stayed at the Royal Plaza with breakfast at Carousel. Almost all dishes taste standard, nothing special. The omelet I ordered was even cooked a bit burnt.
The savior is a croissant!! very tasty, crunchy outside, soft inside... Just perfect."
Amazing Seafood Buffet.,"I really loved seafood and this restaurant did not disappoint me at all. Seafood selections are great and fresh. Lobster and fish are just so awesome. And need to mention the beef also, it was really delicious. Staffs are very attentive. Looking for you everytime. I highly recommend this restaurant. It is really worth it."
Fabulous buffet. Seafood and much more.,"Fabulous seafood of every variety. Too many to mention and all presented and served in a relaxed and pleasing atmosphere. Plus a great selection of meat and veg. dishes also. Not to forget soups and salads and a great selection of deserts and ice cream. Plus free water and coffee. Beers and wines are also available at reasonable prices.
Some might think a little expensive, but for what you can eat and refill as you want - it certainly is not.
I would recommend for everyone to give this a try. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.
Great friendly staff and service. Make a reservation as the carousel buffet is so popular. I loved it ."
Birthday lunch!,"We come here at least once a year and they never fail to impress us. The lunch buffet spread we had was excellent to say the least. Every one of us had a great time, in fact we were the last to leave the restaurant. Thanks Carousel!"
Wonderful spread,"Came here for high tea, the spread is wondeful and the food is fresh and tasty. Will recommend this to anyone who is first time Singapore. Local food and seafood with dessert spread all available. You need a large tummy for everything!"
Sumptuous Buffet Spread,"This is one of the several restaurants that offer halal (for Muslims) buffet with a large spread. Personally, this is one of my favorite when it comes to the variety offered in a buffet. The only ""downside"" is the possibility of over eating because of the options available."
Nice lumch,"9 of us when for lunch to celebrate my daughter‚Äôs birthday.
A nice selections of seafoods, sashimi, Indian foods, Malaysian foods and quite a lot of Chinese dishes as well.
Did enjoyed the salted egg yolk ice cream.
Worth a visit."
NICE BUFFET,Nice ambience Very well train staff Friendly Service orientated Nice chilli crab üëç Delicious fried egg oyster Fantastic rojak Tasty sushi Will be back for more!
Pasta & Chendol ice cream,"A crowded Friday lunchtime, but servers were attentive. Food spread has good variety despite halal limitations. Pasta self selected and cooked on the spot for you, with your choice of sauce. Chendol ice cream not to be missed."
The taste is good,"They have variant of menu. But it would be better if they change the menu everyday,but the taste was good enough :)"
Buffet breakfast,"Usually this place is popular with high tea and dinner buffet. But i came here for the breakfast. At $32 for adult i think, the price is a little bit on a high side compared w wat they offer. But if u want to have a calm n relax atmosphere, then this is e place. The variety is quite ok not too extensive n e taste is just nice. I love the egg station. The only thing I hope is e waiter n waitresses shld provide good and pleasant services."
Outstanding,"Absolutely amazing. Food quality and quantity is second to none, the service is also fantastic. Prices seemed a little high at first, but once experienced it was worth every penny. Highly recommend trying this."
Tasted good but full of MSG,"Large variety and great for seafood lovers if you are not sensitive to MSG. As for myself, I shall refrain from returning. MSG is never good for the body."
A Nice Buffet Spread,I went there for dinner to celebrate my daughter's Birthday last month. It was a great place with a huge spread. They were serving both continental and Asian cuisines. It was not expensive for such a spread. I went 2 rounds for food. Their desserts too were great. My wife enjoyed the salad bar and she too went 2 rounds on Appetizers alone. Overall it was a great experience.
Buffet lunch,"The food was absolutely top class
The head chef here really knows how to get fresh fruit and veggies. The beef and lamb on skewer..fantastic. seafood..wow wow wow...I have paid twice the price at other similiar restaurants but this one now top of my list...
Thanks to great reception and service."
Rude Staff,"I visited this restaurant for a lunch buffet with my cousin on 22 March. It was not my first time visiting this restaurant but I am fairly certain that this will be the last. The food was decent and the buffet variety was good so I will give them that. What disappointed me was the abysmal service standards. I raised my hand a few times to ask for water and the waiters just walked past me without batting an eyelid. The pasta chef, Khairul was also very rude to my cousin. At times, I felt that he was being confrontational to us. I had seen him being extremely patient with other guests. When the buffet was about to close, we were not informed. Thus, when we went to take our desserts, we were curtly told by the staff that those on the buffet table were meant for tea guests and that we were forbidden to take them. It makes me wonder whether this substandard service was given to us due to both me and my cousin being 20 years old. When I checked with the manager, later on, he told me that the standard protocol was to inform guests 15 minutes in advance with regards to buffet closures. Nevertheless, he thanked me for my feedback and asked for my email. Yet, it has been two months and I have yet to receive a follow-up. While the variety and quality of the food are decent, the sub-par service really ruined my dining experience. Honestly, it is disappointing to witness such a huge drop in service ever since my last visit."
Delicious food and great service!,"Really enjoyed the seafood, and the service by the staff was great! There was a variety of selections we could choose from, will definitely come again!"
