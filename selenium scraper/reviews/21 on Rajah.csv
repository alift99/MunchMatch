Wedding,The whole experience was the most absolute perfect. Nan fulfilled all our requests and was prompt in responses. One example was when we wanted to take pictures with our bridesmaid and groomsman right outside (open area) and she unlocked the door right away and waited for us by the door. All our guests love the food. Carrie and M Nanda provided great service on our bride and groom table itself. We are so grateful we picked this place to celebrate our special day! - Afiqah (bride)
A huge shoutout to Nan and Azlan from 21 on Rajah,"My school had our year-end lunch at 21 on Rajah. This was our 2nd time having our lunch here, for obvious reasons. I liased with Nan and it was such a pleasure to communicate with her. She was always ready to attend to my queries and got back to me immediately. Then on the day itself, she ensured everything was ready even before the event started.
Another staff whom I would like to praise is Azlan. He was so helpful and attended to our every needs. He even got the chef to cook for my 4 vegetarian colleagues...amazing! Then he was always there to remind me to play music during the intervals so as to hype up the event. I was so appreciative of this.
I don't think words can describe the excellent service we received at this restaurant. My principals and colleagues were praising the quality of the food, how fresh the seafood was and how they ensured the trays were not empty and constantly topped up.
I would definitely recommend this place. It is not as expensive as some other places and worth every cent.
Thank you 21 on Rajah, especially to Nan and Azlan."
Buffet lunch,Staff was friendly and accommodating. Prompt to attend to requests and clear the used plates. Place is bright and clean. Buffet is value for money.
Weekday Dinner,Visited for a birthday celebration. Food was great! Variety of food and there were Christmas treats too!
Celebrate my daughter's graduation day,"We were at 21 on Rajah today for dinner. We were received by Mr. Azlan, who brought to our table and was very attentive to our request and made us feel comfortable and severed us well. Even though the restaurant was was a bit crowded but Mr. Azlan and his crew were very accommodating. Thank you very much Mr. Azlan and crew
. We wish you all the best‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è"

Thank you 21 on Rajah!,"Speak all thanks to Concierge Manager Henry Neng and Restaurant Manager Nan for their effort and time to make this special outing for the seniors end with a bang at 21 on Rajah possible. All the crews on shift at both Days and Ramada were very friendly and helpful. The seniors and volunteers enjoyed the food and experience at 21 on Rajah.

Thank you all for having us, see you guys soon!"
Can be better.,"Went there for buffet breakfast. $20++ per person. Price seems reasonable but of course the spread is not extensive but adequate.
Egg station is reasonably good. Porridge plus the teriyaki chicken taste ok. A few types of fruits n juices."
Birthday celebration,"we went there to celebrate my brother‚Äôs birthday & was served with excellent services. the malay lady manager was very outstanding in her service provided. despite the last minute request for a birthday cake, they still accepted it. i would like to thank Natasha for helping with the cake personally, she did an amazing job and was also kind. 10/10 would recommend anyone coming here for the buffet & the services rendered. thank you!"

Outing for beneficiaries,"Thank you for providing an excellent and attentive services to us and our beneficiaries. It is wheelchair ‚ôøÔ∏è friendly and good food from the restaurant staffs, reception crews and managers. Thank you üòä"
Lunch buffet,First time dinning your hotel restaurant for birthday celebration. Many choice of food and desserts. But not much choice for seafood. Reccomended. Will visit again next time.
"Nan - Detail Oriented, Excellent Service","Organised dinner at 21 on Rajah and the restaurant manager, Nan was amazing. Not only was she extremely prompt responsive in getting back with the queries, she's also extremely attentive and helpful. One of such instance includes helping us with our photo taking and assisting us with the logistics. She also ensured that there are sufficient seats and food for everyone.

Additionally, the crew and her were very friendly and welcoming. Excellent and memorable service. Thanks once again Nan and team!"
21 on Rajah,21 on Rajah service was excellent and top class. The staff was very friendly. The food is nice and the spread is awesome!
Nada - attentive and professional,"I am a regular at 21 on Rajah because of my work that takes me either at Days Hotel or Ramada. Nada has shown to be an excellent restaurant manager. From the way he leads his team to serve the guests, you can tell that he is someone who goes all out to provide excellent service to the guests at the restaurant. I always enjoy my meals at the restaurant and I always rely on Nada to suggest food that he knows that I would like."
Excellent service Azlan,"For work reasons, I frequently stay at Days Hotel. I was initially unsure but when I finally tried, I was very impressed with the food and the service at 21 on Rajah. Azlan played a big role in initiating me to 21 on Rajah. He was attentive and attuned to my needs as a customer each time I was there. It made me feel like I was with family although i was away from my own family."
Weekend brunch,"Outstanding service‚Ä¶!!
Entertained by Nan, Azlan and Masitah..
Thanks guys! Keep up the good work‚Ä¶!!"
Mummy's Bday Weekend Brunch,Good Excellent. Prompt and attentive. Food served promptly. Actively moving around to check on tables and guests.
Thank you Azlan!,"Thank you Azlan for making our Dinner night awesome. It was my partner's birthday. We did not expect the surprise cake from him! Definitely a 101/100!

On top of that when we ordered beverage, Azlan recommended us watermelon mint. Which I swear was the best we've ever tasted! So refreshing. Just what we needed after a tiring day! Also, he was always there to check with us if everything is fine, if the food is great. Omg Im so happy. And looking forward to bring my family along the next time :)

Thank you Azlan and staffs! We will see you again!"
Everything was better with the Manager Mr M. Nadarajan,"I have to give a shout out to Mr M. Nadarajan who was the manager on duty for 27 August 2022. I think people generally forgets that good service is as important as good food. My family and I are no strangers to the buffet at 21 on Rajah. We've been there a few times but not the recent years and Mr M. Nadarajan was courteous and patient to explain that there is an upgrade in their ordering system. I find the way he explains to us stubborn or ""know-it-all"" customers was a rarefind. He commanded a great crew and was kind enough to help us to find a birthday cake suitable for my sister who is lactose intolerant. The food at 21 on Rajah have always been a healthy spread for the amount of money spent. Not too overwhelming yet providing the balance of good food like how a buffet does.

Thank you 21 on Rajah and thank you Mr M. Nadarajan for making our night better. We will definitely come again! I hope the management understands and appreciate the quality and ability that Mr M. Nadarajan possesses."
Great customer service at 21 on Rajah Restaurant! üíï,"We were served by Nan from the start till the end. Friendly and approchable. Detailed oriented and warm personality. Love that she is patient and her genuine service for us. Other servers as well were great as well. Thumbs up for thier service, will recommend others"
Lovely buffet spread/ Birthday dinner with family,"First time here.
Celebrated both sons' birthdays.

Pleasantly surprised with the buffet spread. Delicious food and good service especially by Ms Carrie. She is really helpful and even surprised us with small slice of red velvet cake.
Thank you for the sweet gesture.

Pls continue to Maintain the good service and food quality.
Will definitely return to this restaurant."
Wedding on 29 Apr,"Good morning

I would like to record my heartfelt appreciation to these gems in the picture and all others that were involved in making my daughter's wedding a success.

Up till today, my relatives are still talking about your great food and excellent service from your staff. They were really amazed with the service given. Will definitely make a comeback for the food and hope to see these friendly gems.

Please continue to provide great food and wonderful service.

Thank you once again from my family."
Superb service,"Despite a very busy Sunday, the staff took time to acknowledge and render good service at the restaurant.. we noticed that the h√¥tel is understaffed but the staff do not show it on their faces.. special mention to Nan , who is ever so efficient doing dual roles at the entrance as well as in the restaurant. Hope th√© h√¥tel recognises the work and appreciate your staff. Food was good too, always being replenished and served warm."
"Something Old, Something New","Finally after two years we are back again, enjoying one of our favourite buffet. Some items have been replaced, and equally good if not better. Service is excellent, esp. from long term service staff, Vimel. He‚Äôs always warm, courteous and helpful, and introduced us to the new menu. We will be back again soon. Thank you."
Worst brunch buffet ever...,"Over priced and food served is of poor quality. Lamb shank is rubbery, squid is tasteless and definitely frozen squid rings used here. Roast beef at carving station is pre sliced and left under the heat lamp. Cold seafood station is pathetic comprising of cold prawns, mussels and clams. Rest of the hot food is nothing to gloat about. Dessert station is also poor with soggy pancakes/waffles, ""air dried"" kueh lapis and more.. Served English breakfast tea but label it as Moroccan mint tea. Overall, I would have given a ""0"" star rating if not for the not too shabby service staff.

At $58++/pax for the weekend brunch, you still have to pay $2++ per pax for filtered water. With such high pricing, it's definitely NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY..!

There are better restaurants in town for that price. Avoid this place at all cost..!"
Funtastic experience dining at 21 on Rajah. A secret gem with outstanding service.,5 out of 5. Fantastic service with Nan and Vimeo. always so patience serving our VIP guests. Thanks Nan and Vimel for the outstanding service. The food is the best halal food in town. perfectly cooked. Great experience
Awesome staff,"My stay in days hotel was wonderful , specially the staff are friendly and will always greet you with smile , this morning I had breakfast at their restaurant 21 on Rajah , the front of house staff Vimel specially made sure I was ok because this was my first time attending breakfast there , very helpful and prompt service , thank you"
12 May 2022,"The ambience and service is good. Friendly staff., especially Nan. The food are tasty. If more food choices would be better. Missing the salmon for cold dish. The lobster in black pepper and grilled prawns are delicious. More choices of desserts please. Hope the usual buffet spread and servings starts soon just like before Covid 19."
Ms,We had a pleasant stay at Days Hotel Singapore. Breakfast for a vegetarian family with kids and people with gluten allergy was very well managed by Mr.Vimal (in 21 on Rajah).
Fabulous staff with fantastic ala carte buffet at 21 on rajah,"Had an awesome birthday celebration at 21 on rajah, super convenient to order via the app and delicious food was served to your table quickly and pipping hot by friendly and efficient staff, good especially for families with elderly n young children without the need to walk to and fro for food and drinks.

Seafood on ice was fresh with sweet prawns n mussels! The saut√©ed squid was surprisingly delicious n soft (not overly chewy)! Even simple dish like sweet and sour chicken was very well executed with its crispy chicken. The lamb shank was soft and well marinated which have us ordering a second helping. All the ice cream, cakes and kuehs are fabulous too, not too overly sweet, the kueh lapis were super soft and buttery, my kid love them!

Special shout-out to Ms Nan, the restaurant manager and Vimel, the tall Indian gentleman (I hope I spell your name right) for your excellent service, bringing plates after plates of yummy hot food to us with your warm smiles, the restaurant is so welcoming as if we were dining at a friend's place! Even the chef waved hello when he passed our table!

Overall, it's an affordable ala carte buffet with good quality food served by a passionate friendly team! Will definitely be back with more friends and families now that life post covid is almost back to normal! Totally forgot to take photos of e food cos we truly enjoyed ourselves and the genuinely great food too much!"
Good food better service,"We had a family dinner during Ramadan. As there were many people, it took awhile before our food was served. However, all their service crew tried their best to attend to us and ensure we got our orders as soon as possible. Especially the manager, Mr Nada.

The food was nice. The rib eye steak was super tender and delicious. The portion of each serving was just nice for one person. We thoroughly enjoyed the dinner."
Dining at 21 On Rajah,I was there to celebrate my wife‚Äôs birthday with the family. The foods and the place was great. We were attended to by attentive and friendly staffs. Especially to Mr Nada who took great initiative to bring us a cake for us to celebrate the occasion even though we did not asked for one. Thank you for a fantastic and memorable evening for me and my family at your restaurant.
Great Dining Experience,My friends and I enjoyed the quality food and the service by the attentive and friendly staff! Love the ambience!
Weekend Staycation Dinner,"We came for dinner during our stay in Days Hotel. The restaurant gave a chill vibes. We would like to especially compliment Mr Nada, for providing an excellent service to us."
"21 on Rajah, despite restrictions...","My last visit to 21 on Rajah was in Dec 2017... I gave a 5-star rating as it exceeded our expectations. But this dinner visit, Mar 2022, has somehow gotten me into a mixed review.

Extended family of 9: 2 tables of 4 & 5 pax.
Need prior booking & table reservation.

The place looks good even after 5 years. The entrance, thru Days Hotel, the reception desk & interior still has that inviting vibes. We were seated near the entrance but our two tables were separated by a column pillar. Can't really see what's happening on the other table.

Place was about 50% full.

We scan a QR code on the table & that brings you to a site for online orders.
Click the quantity of dishes you need & click ""Send Order"". One table to one QR order, irregardless of number of pax.

Water was not served & upon asking, the staff confirmed there is a charge of $4 per bottle of still water, that fills 4 glasses.

Our first batch of dishes arrived well within 2 minutes. Though not all, most dishes arrived fast. All dishes were served individually per order & it's meant for 1 pax. So if there's 3 of you who wanted crab salad, you key in 3 crab salads.
To be served that many dishes individually for all diners, the table gets crowded fast; and a little waste of resources. But that's how things are now, being served in a buffet rather than walk up to the buffet line.

The other table got their order stuck in the system. Accordingly, after placing about 12 items, only 2 got it the system. Everyone waited not knowing the order did not went thru.

After speaking to the manager, we had an issue with the online platform. And that happened to my table after. We placed our second order & had to wait for 7-10mins.
Not all items arrived, but funnily, repeat orders came to our table. Items which we had ordered & eaten, arrived to our table again.
I would think the kitchen has already prepared all dishes as this is a buffet spread. But somehow, I suspected the kitchen prepares the dish as & when an order is placed. While the food is delicious & near perfect, we had to wait.

The next few orders were just waiting & waiting; and same goes for everyone that evening. We spent a total of 3 hours to complete dinner, and half of it were just waiting. You need to have good conversations, otherwise everyone will just look at each other, lol!

But I must complement the manager & staff for going the extra mile to address the shortcomings straight up. They spoke to us & the others to ensure our issues were rectified & that no orders went missing. I think the staff made our day.

As for the ordering system, it definitely needs improvement. Why not place a wifi-enabled tablet on all tables & manage both hardware & software together? This is a more stable configuration & staff will be more familiar if there are issues.

All in all, same good food but different experience. Due to the App, I've given a 4-star this time. Will come back for the good food, desserts & friendly staff.!

Thank you 21 on Rajah...

*my last review of the restaurant:
past review: https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d3791666-r549018139-21_on_Rajah-Singapore.html"
A great place to dine with great staff that will make ur dining experience a great one..,"This place is great! Atmosphere is chill and cool and the staff is also really friendly especially Nan, Nada and Kumar They know what they‚Äôre doing and what they‚Äôre talking about, and you can tell making the customers happy is their main priority. Food is pretty good, and for their prices it‚Äôs 100% worth it. Thank you for the great experience!!!!... will come again soon.."
Birthday Dinner,"We came for my brother‚Äôs birthday dinner.. not many people around cos they just reopened. Perfect ambience.

Superb service from Natasha & Nada!! We kept ordering so Natasha & Nada kept serving us always with a smile..

Shout out to the chef! Food was excellent!! ‚ù§Ô∏è Truly recommend!! Couldn‚Äôt think of a better place to go for dinner now.."
21 on Rajah,"After 2 years due to the pandemic we're finally back here! Their roast beef is still the Best plus their durian mousse was Wow! I love the lobster their sauce was superb..
Keep up the standard of food served & service was excellence!
Will definitely come back with my family"
Value meal,"We bought the value sharing meal for 4 pax and it was so delicious! Food portion were generous. We had paella, spaghetti with clams, sea bass, chicken and also mini lava cakes as dessert! Worth the money and would highly recommend it :)"
Suzaimi & Rashidah's Wedding,"Since the start, the manager at 21 on Rajah know as Nan. She was patient with us in running thru the packages provided by them. She even give suggestions and provided us with alot of information for the wedding preparation. She was so helpful troughout the whole journey till the end. I would really recommend 21 on Rajah for a good and nice ambience place for your special day."
Lunch at 21 on Rajah,"We were invited by my old friend, Christine, for lunch at 21 on Rajah. This restaurant is at the Day‚Äôs Hotel. We were not familiar with the area so we took a taxi there. It was a lunch buffet and there were quite a few people there. The variety of the food, was good. The fish was the first to go. By the time I got there, I saw only the spine and a bit of meat on the side. So I guess it is the best dish. There was sushi, cold prawns and oysters on one side. Chinese salad (Rojak), local desserts and fruit on the other side. The hot food was at the back. The hot food consists of different kinds of meat, cooked in local sauces as well as vegetables. Everything was good . Unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt try everything. Being a dessert person, I tried all the dessert, including the rojak. I did taste many of the hot dishes too. I have no complaint . They were all good."
Great variety and awesome food. Hidden gem that suprisingly isnt costly,"This place is much better than some places that charge double. the variaty is great and food is realy good, place is very clean and neat, ample parking, been here 4 times and still not sick of it."
Good Food,"Cosy, simple place with good food. Good service. Average spread of food. Friendly staff. Good pricing"
Good!,"Good food and good price.
Highly recommend you to try their fried rice and lychee cake.

Two thumbs up!"
Hotel buffet,"Many kind of foods available. But there are not significant dishes.
Sheet is relax and we can make a fun chats."
Dinner buffet,"Ambience was good, ample seating space. Choices of food wasn‚Äôt much compared to the price paid per head. There‚Äôs only 3 choices for live seafood. Staff greetings need to be improved but clearing of plates was fast.
Not worth on price paid per head."
Pleasant atmosphere,"Ambience was good, food value for money & staffs were very approachable & friendly. Definitely will dine again with family & friends"
Reunion of Sisters,Spacious and clean restaurant. Nice and relaxing ambiance. Food wise satisfactory but value for money. Affordable for working people.
Buffet Dinner,"I dined at the restaurant during the CNY festive period. The food was average, the selections were quite limited. Quite a number of dishes on the online menu were not present (even though it was already stated in the online menu itself that some food may not be available.)
Not value-for-money."
Lovely buffet place,The Mediterranean dishes makes it all worth while. 21onRajah is one of my favourite restaurant for buffet with my loved ones. The ambience is still beautiful even after many years and we will definitely come again.
Friendly and helpful staffs,"Very happy and satisfied with the service Mr Vimel provided during my meal.
The buffet choices are quite limited though. Can be better!
Still good foods and services!"
Birthday Dinner,"The food was good. Their service was fast as well in responding to our requests such as getting our chilled water cups refilled and getting us a finger bowl. It would‚Äôve been better if the food were topped up during our visit there. We were there from 7 plus. My bf was looking forward to the cakes spread but the display remained empty despite the place closing at 10pm. During the birthday surprise, I received a delicious chocolate cake. The staff who brought it over, sang the birthday song together with my bf. Overall, it was a pleasant experience dining at 21 in Rajah. Will come back again!"
Value for money meal,"Many varieties of food. Most important part, most welcoming attitude by the employees. Good environment."
Humbly good,"Food quality is excellent with quite a good variety. Classy presentation and food was replenished timely. Waiters were prompt, polite and engaging. Pricing is reasonable. Will come back again."
Stellar service and affordability!,Went to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday and they so generously offered to bring out a birthday cake without me asking. Service staff was also very friendly and proactive. Buffet spread may not be wide but it was just nice for is - we didn‚Äôt mind.
Good Dining Places,"very nice food and good ambience. good for family as well. Best of all, it is a halal restaurant which cannot be found easily."
Good food!!,The food is tasty with local delights. Staff is friendly and helpful. Alot of dessert varieties. Design of the restaurant is very new.
Good for group sit downs,Went with a group of 8 this time. Restaurant has good enough of spread to keep the group filled and engage in conversation.
Year end gathering,"Ambience is nice, bright and colourful. However, food not many variety. For gatherings and meetings will do fine."
Good range of seafood,Seafood range is good and good satay. Might need a bit more vegetable options. In general value for money and good for large group gatherings
Not worth the amount paid,"We went on 1st Jan 2020 to celebrate my son's birthday with the rest of the family. For the price we pay, the variety of food was very few, nothing much to choose from. For the same amount of money we paid at the end, i could have gone to a better valued restaurant.

Space was cramp, and it was really hard to talk there.

If you need carpark coupons, you would need to get them to split the bill (if you need more than 1 carpark coupon) - and you need to walk over to Zhongshan Mall (maybe 5 minutes if you can locate the information counter?) to get the carpark coupon. Not cool, when you spent almost $500 at a restaurant, and you could only get 1 parking coupon and told by the person issuing that you have to split the bill to get more parking coupons.

The only saving grace of this place was they had a magician who could make balloons and entertain the kids so i think that was really great!"
Good Quality Food Serve!,Nice neighbourhood cafe serving good quality food.Good Services. Will definitely be back again. Appreciate!
One of the best buffets,Really enjoyed my time with my family in celebrating my belated birthday here. The staff were friendly and kind and the food was up to my expectations. Will defenitely recommend this to others and most likely will come back again! :)
Superb!,"We totally enjoyed the juicy roast turkey - even the breast meat wasn't dry, in fact it was wonderfully moist! Everything else were totally enjoyable, especially the ambience. Service was superb."
Food was really good!,Thanks for making our Christmas dinner so memorable. There is a wide range of buffet selection and all dishes are up to mark. Very attentive staff too!
Our chill hangout,We love going to their buffet lunch once a month. It is not too big spread but just good for some varieties yet not overly indulging. Recommended.
Festive Gathering,Was looking for halal buffet with reasonable budget. Good variety of buffet spread and ambience is great as well! Definitely satisfied and worth the price. Thanks 21 on Rajah for hosting us!
Company Event dinner,The spread was okay for the price we paid but the location was more what we paid for - because it was private and we are able to celebrate our event. Thanks 21onrajah!
variety of foods and value the money,"their lamb chop are the best. assorted sushi and fresh sashimi, my kids love the chocolate fondue and the ice cream section. the best is they have the prayer room also."
"1 Dec 2019, lunch 12.30-13.45","The staff very friendly, courteous and helpful.

Especially a Malay staff whose name I have overlook, he is very informative and very helpful in many ways

Another is Vimel, also very helpful, responses very fast

I wanna thank them for the wonderful lunch experience I had."
21 at rajah weekend buffet @ days hotel,"Horrible experience !!!!being charge at 55 ++ due to additional barbecue station with nothing big deal . Chef inside the Lasak station not helpful . Not pack during my visit but he show me face when I asked for a bowl
Of noodle.

$55 ++ per person . Not worth with such service and serving . Can find better hotel with better rate / Service and food ."
A pleasant booking experience for a big group and good food!,We went in a grp of 31. Had a pleasant experience and the food was good. Ambience is nice. Please check it out!
Poor choice of food,"There was poor and limited choices today. As such the few reasonable ones like the baked fish was gone in a jiffy. But the replenishing was really slow.
I also noticed the number of cooks are reduced. Only about 2 of them. How can you run a good service this way."
Good value & modest variety,The staff are friendly and the food variety was modest with alot of dessert options. They even have a BBQ option.
Awesome dining place,"Food was awesomely great, staff are polite, very helpful and alwayd willing to assist. The whole dinning experience was excellent."
Well Worth the Price,Affordable and reasonably priced buffet with plenty of options for different dietary requirements and also lots of choices to choose from. This is my second trip and it did not disappoint.
Worth every penny,Had a dinner gathering. It was the first for all of us. We enjoyed our dinner buffet together discussing about the food and around it. Good thing there were less crowd so we manage to hear each other talk while chomping down different delicacies until we were too full. The waitress was attentive. She ensured our glass isnt empty of plain water. The waiter..Syahmi was great too. Very accommodating from the start till we left the restaurant. Thank you and excellent service Syahmi. Will return again soonest with family this time round.
Birthday,Though the spread was not overwhelming but it taste very good..awesome !! Ideal place for family gathering or social meet up. Spacious basement carpark that link to nearby mall
Had a wedding package at 21 on Rajah,"My husband and I had a wedding package done at 21 on rajah. Mr Syahmi and Ms Nan attended to us and helped us with the organisation. Mr Syahmi kept us in the loop through all the details and was so helpful with answering all our questions.

We visited the night before the wedding and made some changes to the sitting arrangement, and again Mr Syahmi was so accommodating to our needs. The wedding day itself was perfect! It was such a relaxed and inviting atmosphere thanks to Mr Syahmi, Ms Nan and the 21 on Rajah crew! One guest mentioned that there wasn‚Äôt enough vegetarian options (completely my fault though as I chose the menu) and told me that Mr Syahmi had asked the super talented chef to make some lovely pasta for her. She, and my family was very impressed by the service!

My husband and I sat in the VIP area and were served and tended to do by Mr Syahmi & Mr Alvin and Ms Nan. They helped make sure everything ran smoothly. We felt so pampered and relaxed. Some guests joked that we were the least stressed bride and groom that they had ever seen!

The guests absolutely loved it as well, they said it was such a wonderful and chilled event! I 100% recommend 21 on Rajah‚Äôs wedding packages because of how helpful and accommodating the staff are. Just lovely!"
Excellence experience .,"I made a booking for a farewell lunch for my team members.The booking was at 2 pm as the apps suggested as only available time.Thus we only have half an hour to enjoy the buffet when the duty manager called me to inform.He is a malay guy whom i didnt manage to get his name,was so kind to suggest that we get the food on the table before the buffet closed. We still able to enjoy the lunch and memories together till about 3 pm eventhough I can see the staff were doing cleaning up after 2.30 pm.Well done on your excellence service.You make a big difference for us."
"Sufficient spread, relaxed ambiance",The buffet spread has enough variety and tastes great too. I like the relaxed atmosphere. The extra bonus is the 50% discount for senior citizens (aged 60 and above).
Anniversary dinner,"Food was so great! Felt like the best dinner in our lives. The buffet has lots of variety. From roast beef, fried rice, salads, desserts, to sushi."
Blissful Wedding Majlis,"From the moment we first visit 21 on Rajah during the Wedding Open House last year. We immediately fell in love with the place and we knew we wanted to have this place to celebrate a special moment with close family and friends. The ambiance and the setting of the venue was perfect for the wedding we envisioned.

The wedding reception we had recently on the 12th of October was simply perfect. The food was amazing and our guest really enjoyed the food. Everyone left with happy faces and their stomachs full. The buffet line was always filled with food and the staff on duty at the various live stations were always on hand to assist our guests to fill their plates. The service staff were quick and professional in clearing of the plates as well.

The event itself went perfectly. Special mention to Nan, who really took care of us on the day itself. She ensured that the setup was perfect and the flow of the event went smoothly. She also ensured that we were hydrated and set aside food for us to enjoy as well. This could not have been possible for not the rapport that we had build over the months leading to the event. She was always on hand to answer our enquiries leading up to the event and always gave us the peace of mind that everything will be alright.

Also would like to take this opportunity to mention, Vimal and Alvin as well. They stepped in and assisted us as well during the food tasting as well as the AV testing. And a special mention to Mr Faizal for coming down on your off day to meet up with us and congratulating us personally. And of course to the Chefs who prepared quality food. Till today our guest are telling us the food they had was really really good. I really can't thank enough the staff at 21 on Rajah for their hospitality. Thank you for making our special day memorable. Please keep up the great work!!!"
Surprise Birthday Celebaration.,"Planned a surprise birthday celebration for my husband with Nan, one of the staff at the restaurant, and it was well executed. My family and I were also happy with the food offered. It was of good variety and tasted good too."
Perfect place to Chill and Dine,A decent spread but each dish is AMAZING! Worth the trip for the weekend dinner buffet. Would definitely come again. Good ambience too. Highly recommended.
Love it,"Love the place there since it‚Äôs been halal certified and knows, Chef Faustino plus service is excellent."
Wedding Reception at 21 on Rajah,Did a family wedding reception at 21 on rajah and Nan and team from the banquet department was really helpful and made the event a succesful one. Food was great and service from the banquet team was better. Thank you for the wonderful experience.
Always having a good time,"I have been repeating going to 21 on Rajah with family and they have always give the best service plus of course good spread! This time, we celebrate aunt's birthday and they give a delicious cake and sing a birthday song to her. Thank you so much! We will surely come and visit again! :)"
Halal. Tapas. Antipasti. Roast beef. What's not to love?!,"We have been here a few times already, and every time, the quality of food is consistently delicious. We always love the carving station's beef rib-eye roast with a beautiful side of greens displayed - with gravy, mustard and horseradish creams on the sides! The salad bar is mediterranean inspired and so varied (eggplant! sundries tomatoes!) unlike most other buffets that make people think salads are boring. There is also tapas and antipasti. For its price, we personally feel it rivals the other higher priced popular buffets. Staff service is also good and pleasant."
"Great food, quick replenishment. but not a very broad variety","The Snow crabs were awesome, and the staff were quick to replenish and make sure there was always more to go back for. The Roast beef, YUM. Only downside, the variety overall of all the dishes aren't that broad, but still worth the price, nice!"
Lunch buffet,"Easy to make reservation as it is online at their website. Food is nice too, vibe is good. Overall excellent would recommend!"
THANK YOU SO MUCH!,"We would like to express our heartfelt thanks to the staff and management of 21 on Rajah & Days hotel for making our stay and event a very memorable one.

Greatful appreciation to Nan who oversee the entire wedding event of my sister's wedding (Siti & Ridzwan) on 28.09.2019, making it a smooth and flawless event. And giving us a chance to always express what we want & how we do our things, from the dining options, to the set-up.

Many thanks also to Rahmat & the supervisor who helped tremendously (cant remember his name) & all the entire 21 on Rajah team who worked tirelessly during the entire event serving good food & quality customer service to all the guests throughout. Running the service industry team myself, i know it takes alot to continuously serve tirelessly, with a smile and positive attitude. Kudos to the management for inculcating a very positive vibe among the staff.

Cant thank the staffs & crew enough and we made the right choice on choosing 21 on Rajah for good food & quality service & we fit in comfortably just like at home.

We tried the breakfast, lunch & dinner buffet during our stay!

Keep up the good work!"
