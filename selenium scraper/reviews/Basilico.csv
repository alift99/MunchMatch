Very Disappointed,"For Dinner buffet @$99++ with limited selections, coffee and tea should be included. This would probably be my last visit after 10 years."
Outstanding dinner experience in Basilico üíï,"Great food ,fantastic chef Valerio for the best risotto and great quality service for Nisa and Nae .People there are so cordial & hospitable and also for the drink server VJ for having profound knowledge of drinks."
Fantastic Experience with my Family,"The food was excellent , a lot of variety of cheeses ,Thanks to chef Valerio ‚Äçfor the risotto it is really the best risotto in town and you must really try that one . And for the staff‚Äôs they are so friendly , they take care of us and it feels like HOME . The rumours are true that BASILICO is the best restaurant in town ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Stellar occasion,"It was a great evening at Basilico Conrad Singapore with our family. The food was fantastic and the ambience was inviting.

Will also need to take pause and commend their waiter Vijay on his attentive and comprehensive service the whole evening, ensuring plates were removed and glasses filled with regularity.

Will definitely recommend a dining experience here."
Amazing buffet,"Great food, amazing service, and massive selections. The cheese room and desserts are definitely a highlight! Thank you to Ananthan and Vijay for the great service and recommendation."
Wonderful lunch gathering with friends,"Had our lunch buffet and the food was amazing. If you love cheese and beef, this is the place for you. Beef lasagna is good. Great selection of cheese.

Service crew Jovis is attentive and gives good recommendations."
Spread Service Staff,Always enjoyed having a meal here with the delicious spread and friendly staff who provide one of the best services around. A recommended Italian restaurant with authentic Italian flavor. Will be back again for sure.
Bad value for money,"Went because of Amex platinum card 1-for-1 deal but it turns out that it has been discontinued since the hotel changed to Conrad management less than a week ago. Buffet was also less attractive than during the festive period, at essenrially double the price."
Great Italian cuisine n excellent service by staff. A pure Italian Buffet that I think is the one in town.,Impressive cheese room with many assorted cheese . desserts are amazing n the Italian spread lovely. Vijay great staff !
"Fantastic freshness and spread of food, nearly completely marred by backend customer service","Wife and I queued to be let in at the start of dining time. Frontline couldn't find my reservation because Basilico had apparently sent an email for prepayment to guarantee the booking. I received no such email, nor any calls before reservation date that I (supposedly) have an email to read.

An ethnic Chinese manager (regrettably I didn't note his name) managed to arrange a table for us, but not before a whole 30 minutes of the dining starting time has lapsed.

The food on offer was fantastic, but we were nearly made to consider another place for lunch before service recovery. Someone on the backend needs to be disciplined for not doing their job properly and nearly costing us our reservation, during a festive season to boot. Upon checking my email account after the meal, there was indeed no such email sent out. I'd have been happy to make a prepayment, and my only issue was that I was nearly turned away for a mistake on the part of the restaurant. Food quality, spread, and service recovery saved our visit."
Horrible and Terrible,"Book a table for Xmas day. Restaurant cancel my book without informing me.
Only found out about the cancellation when I double check my booking via the local booking apps.

Call the hotel restaurant only got an email reply that said pre payment dateline over. Don‚Äôt bother to call back.

I never get an email or call from the restaurant asking for payment.

I guest when restaurants is filling book they can very disregarded any other customers."
"Great Service, but Food Quality Much to be Improved","We recently organised a birthday event under their semi-private dining. The manager assigned to us, Mr Wilson, has been great throughout and met the deliverables required of him. His team managed to decorate and inflate the balloons prior to the event. Service was excellent during the course of the festive brunch.

We are long customers of Basilico and have visited the restaurant countless times. We noticed the quality of food has dropped a fair bit. This is no fault of the service team, but we wish the food quality will improve in the near future.

The buffet no longer serves foie gras, and deep fried seafood selection (calamari, fish fritters). Seafood selection is limited. Hot foods stations appear to be rather limited. Pizzas were better when we last ordered via a la carte.

Cheese, cold cuts selection were great.

The buffet was priced at $148/pax before alcohol, and $188/pax with alcohol. It was considered a ""Festive Brunch"". At this price range, we would expect a better selection of food.

Service-wise, it was excellent throughout and we very much appreciate it."
Worst buffet in a 5 stars hotel,"Selection of food is limited for the price we paid ($88++ after discount). Understand it is an Italian based restaurant, however, selection of hot and cold food is very limited. No oysters were served!
Beverages are not included, that include coffee and tea. Really, in a buffet concept??
Only warm or ice water were served.

No alcoholic beverage packages are available too. All based on a la carte per glass.
We were ask what is the occasion. We mentioned that it is a birthday celebration. Guess what, nothing was done for us. Then why ask?

When a staff drop his POS card, my son saw it, pick it up and returned to the staff, not even a thank you was mentioned. Kitchen staff are standing at the open kitchen leaning against the wall, talking. Very unsightly. Told the Pastry chef that the serving tools for the cake is dirty, and nothing was done to replace. And to top it off, there wasn't any car park coupon was offered to us.

Highly not recommended!"
Basilio,"4th visits this year in 2022. First time feeling a huge let down from Basilico's offering. Foie Gras was clearly stated in the online menu a month before I made the booking and even a few days ago before we visited (it was actually updated when I checked today though, too many complains? Perhaps!!), even the chef at the carving station mentioned Foie Gras were not available since ""long time ago""!! And why wasn't the menu updated with accurately information? Secondly, seafood station did not replenish the lobsters constantly and the station staff seemed to be rationing carefully when he eventually brought out the tub from the storage. The rest of food items were the same, no surprises in a neutral way. Clearly, the high standard in Basilico that we experienced from the past visits has gone and I actually refrained from complaining to the management right on the spot as it was a birthday celebration and did not intent to spoil the day. Basilico would not be our incumbent choice of Weekend Brunch buffet offering and would definitely consider from others like Estate, Colony, Opus Bar and Grill given these are on par in terms of price category and standard."
Quality Food,"One of the best buffet with high quality food. Food selection had dropped, a bit disappointing. Was not offered complimentary parking by the waiter, probably due to our dressing not high class enough."
Quality declined,"We have been many times to the Sunday brunch pre-covid. This was by far our favorite brunch in Singapore and we couldn‚Äôt wait coming back again and enjoying the fabulous selection of Italian meals.
Unfortunately, our expectations were a bit disappointed. Not only the choice was limited compared to the past, but the quality was also not there. Their risotto which was a mind blower was a bit dry. The choice of mozarella was not as wide.
While pan fried foie gras was on the menu, it was not available. We were explained by the butler that Singapore imposed a ban on it. After verification on websites and friends in the F&B, this information is not confirmed.
The only thing that truly impressed us was the selection of cheeses."
Absolutely divine!,"It was our 5th year wedding anniversary and we decided on Italian food, again.

To our greatest delight, we were pampered by Mr Ryan and his impeccable service. His introduction to the wide array of cheese selection, his focus on all the tables needing his attention and his cheerful smile makes the experience even better than expected. Great camera man too, by the way.

On top of that, the chef who was doing an inspection round offered to whip up a salad with generous doses of balsamic and olive oil. It was amazing. Divine!

The food selection is excellent, no introduction needed for this famous restaurant.

I would like to offer my thanks to all the service staffs, the manager, that particular chef and of course, the most impressive staff of the night, Mr Ryan.

Thank you all very much, can't wait for our next Italian food craving!"
A foretaste of Heaven,"After cocktails in the Regent Hotel‚Äôs Manhattan Bar, we adjourned to dine at Basilico. From the moment we arrived, Danielle, the manager, and his accomplished staff ensured that our dining experience was truly memorable. A buffet is often risky. Basilico‚Äôs Italian Buffet a risk worth taking - and repeating - an enormous selection of the freshest antipasto and crustaceans through to a heavenly asparagus soup, onto a selection of pizzas constantly prepared, roast meets, breads, salads and a sinful choice of deserts. The most singular and creative aspect of the buffet was the cheese room with a selection of over 55 cheeses from regional Italy and Sicily. For us the high point was the White Chocolate and Truffle Gorgonzola from Lombardy. The experience was so worth we‚Äôll that we have booked into again next week. Thank you to Danielle, the chefs and staff."
Favourite Italian Buffet in Singapore,"Meals at Basilico are always satisfying. My highlight was the buratta cheese. It was fresh and creamy without being too runny. I appreciate that the menu varies from day to day to keep things interesting. While disappointing when my favourites aren't available that day, it is a great opportunity to try out new dishes.

For mains, I was particularly impressed by the baked salmon and was disappointed when it was later replaced by a sea bass which was still good but less outstanding. The saut√©ed beans were also very memorable.

The refreshing house made sorbets and comforting bread and butter pudding were a great way to round out a good meal.

Service was attentive and friendly despite the restaurant being fairly crowded.

I'm super grateful that Basilico is part of the Amex Love Dining promo to make this great venue a more affordable."
Very Good Experience,This is one of the rare restaurants in Singapore which has a cheese room. The quality of food is very good but the cheese room brings it over the top. Service was excellent. I would like to commend Annanthan for the attention he gave my family. He quickly arranged something for my son when he found out that it was his birthday and patiently took numerous family photos for us!
Excellent Food & Service!,"Celebrated a friend's birthday.

Food was good as always. Although we have been to the restaurant for a few times, we were not aware that there was a hidden section dedicated for cheese lovers. The selections were aplenty and my friend had a spontaneous request to see if it was possible to have someone share more about the different types of cheese.

My friend approached Anathan on the request and he took in our feedback. In no time, he had invited Head Chef Valerio and Chef was more than happy to share his knowledge about cheese pairing; how to read the label and select in accordance to one's preference.

Chef Valerio was very friendly and Anathan was very attentive during table service. Thank you Basilico for the awesome food and service!"
A lot less options available,"Went for the lunch buffet on a weekday. There was a salad spread, cold food spread and some warm dishes. But there's a lot less warm dishes compared to before. It was rather disappointing"
"Still as good, not the same",Was informed that it has become a full buffet during confirmation of my booking with a price increase. Still prefer the half buffet as I get to choose just one main course that I love. Overall still a very nice dinner and superb atmosphere.
Basilico 2022,"The staff, like the food, at Basilico never disappoint, they were attentive, helpful and very kind. I always always enjoy the Basilico experience."
Weekday lunch buffet,We visited the restaurant for weekday lunch buffet. Great service and we really enjoyed the great selection of cheese and ensalada.
Highly underwhelming experience,"Let me start off by saying, out of fairness to the reader, that Italian cuisine critique is not my forte.

Now I‚Äôll explain why three stars. I notice there‚Äôs abundant wine and cheese in this restaurant - it‚Äôs abundantly clear to any visitor. But I don‚Äôt usually drink wine and I don‚Äôt particularly like cheese.

When it came to orders, there is only one potato soup option for soup, and plenty of large mussels were in it (I‚Äôm also not a fan of mussels).

I got a carbonara - the pasta had a springy texture which is lovely, but the sauce was unlike that of other carbonaras I‚Äôve had in my life - the roasted bacon were tiny bits and looked overly roasted; think there was a truffle taste in it or which, again I‚Äôm not a fan of. I asked for chilli flakes, but it never arrived.

Finally the dessert. I thought I‚Äôll play safe and get their tiramis√π- it was a ‚Äúdeconstructed version‚Äù (so says the waiter). Not my cup of tea‚Ä¶ not much alcohol, no cake feel but crumbs inside, and lots and lots of cream on top.

To top it all, service was inattentive the entire evening, considering that the restaurant was less than a quarter full (it‚Äôs Monday).

So I guess it‚Äôs a FnF for me - first and final."
Birthday celebration,"A lovely experience of good food, quiet and serene ambience, great service - definitely going back again."
Sophisticated Sunday Italian Brunch,"Sophisticated Sunday Italian brunch. We indulged in such great food in a nice private room. It was a perfect celebration for our friend. Make it extra on his 40th.

The free flow ranges from $112 up to $222, the difference amongst its prices was the choices of champagne and premium wine. Food wise, it's a great and quality selection from their antipasti, pasta,meat and the amazing cheese section. Good amount of seafood as well but no oyster which I always see in the buffet but still fine of course. At times, I tend to forget it‚Äôs only Italian food, hahaha was looking for sushi and curries

So, unlike the usual buffet, there‚Äôs so much chef than the usual who are standing behind the food glass counter (precautions during covid time) and will assist with what food you will choose. So better have a look at the food first then you Q for a smooth flow. You will expect a line so, be patient anyways the chefs and other staff are helpful enough to guide you.

Overall, it was a 10/10 experience. Thanks Basilico team especially to Francis with his excellent and fabulous service. He caters what you need just before you ask for it."
Sunday Brunch,"Patronized the Basilico Sunday Brunch on MayDay and had the Prestige Selection of the Champagne options. Champagne was top notch but I can't say the same for the food. Food selection was not as varied before Covid, and the food quality of the hot plates has dropped quite significantly. I didn't go for any 2nd helpings. Seafood was fresh and delicious though.
Fortunately too, I had a wonderful server named Francis waiting at my table and he was very attentive and prompt in clearing my plates and topping up champagne. Much kudos to him for making this Sunday brunch quite a wonderful experience."
Birthday dinner,"Food was good quality and service is great as usual. the service staff, Vijay , has served my table 3 times and it is impeccable as usual. Never fail to
Impress me. However the lighting can be improved because the big table we had was at the darker corner."
More of the same - Good Old times,Great to be back to the full buffet. Excellent service by Corwynn. He was attentive and prompt in his service.
Birthday Celebration,"Celebrated my Birthday at Basilico. It was my 1st visit and we were totally impressed by the service and attentiveness of the staff.

To name Executive Senior Sous Chef Luca was amazing. Sharing with us the different type of cheese and pairing it with Truffle Honey.

Chef Valerio was friendly and welcoming too

Daniele, Restaurant Manager seated us in a very cozy corner. Food recommendation was excellent.

Shern & Thiny (not sure if I got the spelling right). They were both very helpful and attentive.

Thank You Basilico for the Awesome Experience"
"Best Fine Italian Cuisine in Singapore and the staff are friendly, welcoming and helpful!","Best Fine Italian Cuisine in Singapore and the staff are friendly, welcoming and helpful! Our favorite dishes were the truffle pizza and seafood Risotto. Very grateful and thankful to Vijay for taking good care of us during our visit."
For cheese lovers...,We tried‚Ä¶ probably give the experience 6/10‚Ä¶ largely due to the yummy antipasto platter and the wonderful friendly table service by part timer retiree Michelle.
Very Satisfied!,Service was good and staff very attentive to our needs. Will go back there again. Highly recommended for those who are looking for good food and service.
Good food & service,Everything served was tasteful & delicious. Our business guests were happy with this selection (of restaurant) which made our business discussions a success too!
Great dinner,"We had a phantastic dinner last night at Basilico. Since Chef Luca is on board, the restaurant has so much changed for the better. He is creative and very customer oriented.

You can see and feel the improvements everywhere. It starts with the upgraded bread basket, the Focaccia they serve free of charge afterwards or the little surprises in between. Do not hesitate to ask Luka for his recommendations if you don‚Äôt want to order a la carte or the 4 course Menu. The pasta with lobster we tried yesterday was simply delicious

Thank you Luca and the entire team and we will be back soon."
An excellent leisurely Italian weekend lunch,"Enjoyed a excellent set course lunch with free flow drinks at the Basilico. The Antipasti, Seafood platter, Beef & Burrata cheese was very good. Didn‚Äôt like the Squid ink risotto as much; & the dessert was a little rich. We had a table overlooking the pool, & the waiter Prem assigned to our table was outstanding. Highly recommended."
2022 Service Award goes to Diana!,We are super impressed with the services rendered by Diana and the whole service team. Good job üëç!! Keep it up!!
Basilico for my anniversary dinner!,"I saw a special dinner promotion on Regent Hotel‚Äôs website so I made a reservation to try it.
When I arrived, staff were prompt and attentive. The space in the restaurant is so comfortable because it is so spacious. I hope they would change the chairs though because it‚Äôs so heavy when you stand and push the chair away.

Appetiser is totally worth it, it‚Äôs unique and rather delicious.
Mains were reasonable and filling.
Syrah red wine is so good with my steak!
For the dessert, you can forget about the mini sweets platter and cheese board.

Other than that, Francis took care of us really well!"
Decent food,"Appetisers were great, we had the mushroom soup and burrata. The meat dishes were good too. However, the patrons of the table beside us were smoking (indoor) and nobody stopped them until we raised the concern. The smell from the lighted cigarettes was very unpleasant. Not sure if we received subpar service standards because we were using chope vouchers?"
Expected more,"- Heard so much about the place, decided to bring sister in law for her birthday.
- The dinner set menu was more expensive than when you added the same items up ala carte. Staff didn‚Äôt really know how to explain so we went ala carte.
- A number of items on dessert menu were not available.
- Burrata was alright but I have only had better elsewhere, e.g. Publico, Zafferano
- Requested for risotto no cheese. Probably not the best idea on our part but would have appreciated the kitchen/chef to tell us it won‚Äôt be good because it was terrible.
- Cheese stuffed wagyu was dry but tasted ok / plain.
- Tenderloin was cooked to perfection but peppercorns were extremely overpowering
- Service helped the situation a lot. Staff were attentive, polite and friendly. Prepared birthday cake."
Over rated! Poor service,"We went for dinner as it was highly recommended by our friends! We were extremely disappointed not only with the food, but incredibly poor service! We had to keep requesting to refill our wine glasses and it was a challenge to find our totally disinterested table server. The food was nothing to write home about! It almost felt as if the chef was in a hurry to pack up as the food was bland and tasteless and the plating left much to be desired! The Antipasto all Italiano was the only dish which was up to the mark! The Capocolo e Burrata, the Ravioli and the Beef Steak in green pepper sauce were all forgettable.
Very disappointed as it was highly recommended!
When restaurants become popular they need to be more careful about maintaining a certain food and service standard!"
Good meal and nice ambience,"For two diners, I would suggest one goes for the set and the other just order a main from the a la carte and skip the starter and dessert altogether. We made the mistake of having two complete set lunches, and were already quite full after finishing the antipasti, which is a fixed platter of assorted cold cuts, greens and cheeses."
Good Food Good Service,"We had wagyu bombatte, spinach ravioli and poached pear with vanilla gelato to share between two. I feel that the portions was just right. The mains were hearty but not salty. The gelato was creamy and delicious. Service was good, she (I did not get her name) even told us about the credit card discounts. To me, the place was cosy but maybe a little dim."
Lovey restaurant delivers every time!,"I dine here very frequently with my friends and family and every meal at Basilico is thoroughly enjoyed by all. The food is consistent and on point, service warm and professional, and atmosphere charming and cosy. We are usually looked after by Shaern who always goes the extra mile to ensure that our every need is met - even more appreciated when we are dining with our kids. At our last visit a few days back, we had the white truffle w fresh tagliatelle, and off the menu item and it was amazing. Our favourites are the black truffle focaccia and funghi pizzas, carbonara and squid ink pasta, lasagne, and the desserts are simply delightful. Thanks for all the meals so far, Basilico, and cheers to many more!"
Delizioso!,"The food was great especially the wagyu beef lasagna. I would have rated it excellent if not for the bone I found in my food. But the staff changed it for me and threw in coffee on the house as service recovery. Most of the staff were friendly especially a Malay lady who could return my banters. Because of the service and the taste, I have booked my next visit."
Enjoyable Italian fare at reasonable fares,"We made reservations and had a quieter part of the restaurant with a poolside view. As the sun set, it was a lovely view to accompany the quite authentic Italian fare. Squid ink pasta was above average, wish there was more squid though. Carbonara pasta a bit heavy on the salt. Appetiser was only burrata cheese with ham, cos the selections werent huge. Special mention of slight twist to tiramisu, with coffee jelly that gave it a new texture to the dessert. Cracked open a bottle of Chianti that did not disappoint as well.

All in, will recommend!"
Always Feels Like A 'Little Holliday',"5 Star all around. Top quality food by chefs Luca and Valerio. Often exciting specials. Super service provided by Anna, Prem, Shaun, Jaya, Malcolm just to mention a few. Efficient, yet at desired relaxing pace. Excellent in recalling regular guests individual requirements. Gunther W"
First timer,Was very impressed with the food standard and service by prem is very commendable. His recommended food and drinks were all very nice and dessert was awesome. Its a very lovely dining place for couple. Very very good.
Impeccable service,"We were here for dinner, the service was perfect and impeccable. We were served by Diana and she was excellent in her recommendations, regularly checking with us that everything was fine. Super impressed how well trained and happy she was to serve the guests. Not to mention the ambience and finery of the restaurant was incomparable. By the way the food and wine were excellent."
Nice place to dine in,"service is amazing. The waiter is patient and efficient. They serve the food within 10minute or less . We ordered pizza, sew and lasagna and dessert. Ithe food are delicious and I will be back to try out other dishes. t"
Lovely food and ambiance,"Had an excellent lunch at Basilico. We had two lunch sets. The antipasti was delicious. I esp enjoyed the 4 types of cold cut, the seafood and roasted veg. For the main course, the squid ink pasta was perfectly cooked while the large prawns were fresh and went perfectly with their accompaniments. Dessert was a selection of sweets. The cakes and tiramisu were very enjoyable but we found the bonbons wat too sweet. The staff were friendly and polite. We really enjoyed our lunch."
Great first time - Fantastic Authentic Italian!,"A great first time! Heard many good reviews about this and decided to visit it. Had birthday lunch for my wife (actual day too) and we got the 3 course set lunch.

Food was excellent and you have to try it for yourself. Since it was the eve of a public holiday, we didn‚Äôt get to enjoy any discount but I would still say it‚Äôs worth the price we paid.

We will be sure to visit again, this time hopefully with the kids!"
Great dining experience,Recommendation of the food were superb! The bottle of riesling paired very well with the pasta! Beef was tender and juicy. Prem and Shaern delivered a great service with good recommendations of the dishes and ensuring our glasses are filled. Great dining experience overall.
Italian with Asian touch,"Nice dining place with great service. This is our 2nd time and first review of the place.

We had the parma ham pizza, $31 for a huge pizza with lots of toppings. Very good but not as crispy as the crust was somewhat between medium thickness. You can get filled just eating this pizza.

We also tried the octopus (my favorite if you like octopus), and the lamb chops (not the best). I think the beef was much better as the table beside us had the beef and share the comments about the lamb to the wait staff.

Overall great choice, nice ambiance and good service."
Fabulous but PLEASE bring back the original tuna appetiser!,"This is the second time I‚Äôve had dinner here and I love it. Food is good and service is fantastic. A special shout out to the manager who was working on Sat 9 Oct (I assume he is the manager/supervisor as he was wearing a jacket, unlike the other staff). He is so very pleasant, most welcoming and helpful, service with a smile. The rest of the staff are great too. Thank you all for a wonderful dinner. So to the hotel, please value your staff. If I can just make a request, please bring back the tuna appetiser you had back in January. I don‚Äôt usually eat tuna but because it was so good, I had to come back again. Unfortunately, I discovered that this item has been changed, now the tuna has a crumbed layer on the outside and cut into bigger chunks. Why modify a dish that was already perfect?? Please change it back and I will gladly come back for the 3rd time. And you‚Äôve changed the dessert too! We had a plate of dessert each the last time. Now you‚Äôve combined it with a cheese plate to share. Again, why? Perhaps give customers a choice of sweets/cakes or cheese plate for dessert if you want to have a variety."
Great food & service,Another lovely lunch today at Basilico. The set lunch is great value. The last time we were served by Prem whose service was exceptional and so good to meet him again today. We will keep coming back for the food and service from the heart from Prem. Bravo to the Baslico team and management!
Fulfilling Brunch,First time trying the Brunch Menu - was satisfied with the salad of roasted veg and fresh tomatoes. Starter of the cheese sticks and foccacia is awesome too. Very fulfilling brunch for the weekend ;-)
Authentic Itlalian and substantial Set Lunch,"The 3-course $58 (discount from $68) set lunch was very substantial, especially the Anti-pasta which came with a wide variety of cured meat, burrata and mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes, pickled artickoe and zuchini in pesto sauce. We had the Octopus tentacle which was perfectly charred and tender.
My only unhappiness is the $9.50 cup of black coffee; unreasonably priced."
Fantastic Service & Food,"Service was attentive and professional - big plus point. They‚Äôd explain what each dish consists of (eg what each dessert piece is on the plate)
They serve the courses together like any food kitchen does- very good to see a main chef watching over and communicating with the other chefs.

The quality of food was excellent; portions just right.
I had the $68 set lunch with antipasto, stuffed wagyu and dessert plate. And yes, complimentary bread basket with 4 kinds of bread.
Definitely would return!
Do remember to ask for complimentary parking coupon if you drive."
Terrific food & service,The food & service remain at the level that draws us back here. Make sure you try their burrata. Ravioli made a wonderful main course. And the tart & gelato the perfect end to the meal
Italian Delizioso!,"Popular Italian in vantage location on Cuscadean Road! The main courses of Seafood Pugliesi, Pizza Ortalana, Carbonara Pasta were extremely tasty. Pizza portion was quite huge and not scanty like other fine dining restaurants.

Must try Dolci section, wherein Tiramigu was very different, with espresso jellies, coffee ice cream, etc all rolled into one.

Overall, really recommended for tasty Italian with great ambience & friendly service"
Mediocre Pizzas & Pasta with condescending service.,"We've been regulars over the years at Basilico and I'm sad to report that my family and I were shocked by the drop in standards.

The Pizzas are stingy with their layers of cheese and meats, the fish stew my mother had was apparently watery and tasteless and had chunks of overcooked fish in it, the most disappointing really was the pasta.

We ordered 3 pastas and only one of them was enjoyable. The ravioli my son ordered seemed like the most palatable of the lot. Our other 2 pasta dishes were lacklustre, wasn't plated with enough sauce and was grossly lacking any flavour. They tasted one dimensional and I hate to say this, but something you could heat up at home straight out of a bottle. We don't even do that at home.

To top it off, service was condescending and pushy. The waiter asked if we wanted a bottle of wine for the table and we declined politely, opting for mineral water. My wife detected a smirk and coming from a waiter who was there to serve the diners, that was most insulting.

You can bet we're not coming back for a repeat of this. Come to think of it, from the moment we were greeted at the entrance of the restaurant to the time we finished our meal and left, the service was devoid of warmth and any hints of being valued as a diner. Distant stares and a nonchalant attitude all round.

Gosh, what has Basilico been reduced to?"
Today's Basilico can keep us as loyal diners,"As regulars, we've never been more pleased with the standards of Basilico's kitchen. The current menu is, in our humble culinary opinion, perfection. The flavour nuances in each dish tickles our senses every time we have a meal here.... and we do so with much anticipation each time.

It's a gem of an italian ristorante and it goes without saying, our fave. Any naysayers should be ignored and we hope the chef and his kitchen simply keep the magic alive.

We've been hampered from visiting it regularly over the past few months due to pandemic restrictions but now, we do vow on making it a weekly affair at the very least. Our palates are delighted by that very thought alone.

Not to be missed are their elegant pastas, layered and complex. You can't go wrong with their starters and seafood either and always save room in the tummy for desserts. Oh, they serve a tree nut tart that is such a treat, almost like a nutty baklava but so much more..... We always order a la carte as we do not like the restriction of the structured set menus but to each his own.

We do wish, however, that some of the staff are better trained at serving the dishes tableside and adopting a less casual tone with diners. Addressing your diners as ""you guys"" does not bode well in an establishment of your calibre. On that note, the reception at the front desk could also be warmer. It always feels like we're reporting to the head mistress, checking off our attendance with a scowl. I'm sure that with a little training, these can all be improved on.

Fortunately, all these missteps are made up by the culinary genius of the kitchen. This, we sincerely hope, will never change."
Delectable food and the service was impeccable!,"Venturing out for a proper meal after the P2HA in Singapore, we decided on Basilico.

It was indeed delightful to be greeted at the front of the hotel by the excellent duo of Danny and Arjuna - such great hospitality that makes coming to the Regent Hotel always so special.

For our lunch, we started with a huge portion of antipasti including Parma Ham, Salami, Parmesan Cheese, Burratina, Buffalo Mozzarella, and Marinated Artichokes & Vegetables.

This was followed by our 2 mains which include a Seafood Stew with Sea Bass, Salmon, Mussels, Prawns, Scallops, Olives, Basil and Capers and a Sea Bass cooked in Parchment Paper with Wild Clams, Pachino Tomatoes, Olives, Capers, and Asparagus

We ended our meal with a lovely Miniature Dessert Selection and some Italian Hard & Aged Cheeses with Truffle Honey.

The food was simply delectable and the service was impeccable. Special thanks to the incomparable Jaya, Malcolm, Francis and Apple, for making our afternoon an exceptionally enjoyable one."
Excellent food and service,Basilico was everything we expected and more. The crusted tuna was simply delicious and such a generous portion that I was able to share with my fellow diners. The risotto was exquisite as well. The cheese plate was very generous. Service was good and unobtrusive. Will definitely return.
Excellent Lunch at Basilico,"Had an excellent lunch here at Basilico. Pity there wasn't a buffet as per previous occasion. But the food was still up to standard. We opted for the 3-course set lunch and was thoroughly delighted with the food. I started with the Buratta while my friend had the Anti Pasti. Both starters were delicious. I would definitely recommend the Anti Pasti as it gave the option to try abit of everything.

For the mains, I went for the Risotto while my friend went for the Salmon. The Risotto was absolutely divine and delicious. I'm still missing it! The Salmon was a tad overcooked but still alright.

For the dessert, we both opted for the dessert platter which gave us the option to try a chef selection of dessert. That was a good choice as the dessert on offer was good.

Service was also excellent all around and friendly. Overall, we enjoyed our lunch here at Basilico and would definitely recommend a visit here."
Still very good even if less diverse than pre Covid,"Pre Covid, the weekend buffet brunch here used to be our fav, mainly because of the extreme diversity of dishes and types of Italian cooking on display. They are doing their best to provide this diversity, but if it‚Äôs only a fraction of what it used to be. Quality of ingredients also seems to have gone down a little. Most importantly, the experience is less satisfying, mainly because the (otherwise excellent) staff are overworked with all the serving they now have to do. Requests are sometimes forgotten. There also seems to be an intended delay to serve the free flow wine in a cost-control effort? It remains very good quality, and decent value, however. During the week, many √† la carte offerings are outstanding, like for instance an amazing carbonara."
Transported to Italy,"Enjoyed the recommended courses - the starters were delicious and full of fresh ingredients - olives, tomatoes, artichokes, Parma ham, cheeses, seafood and meats were superb. We probably were ‚Äúweak‚Äù from the circuit breakers and couldn‚Äôt indulge with the sheer volume of appetisers. We guiltily enjoyed the foie gras twice before the pasta and the mains. The desserts came with the cheeses and we topped it off with some coffee and tea. A wonderful experience and excellent and attentive service throughout."
Pleasant Easter Lunch,"Very good food (entrees and mains) and even though it was a table service buffet, the portions were ample and delicious. The service was relatively good but it got a bit slow towards the end of the seating. Only recommendation is to consider to refresh the decor and to employ more staff. The dessert was certainly not the best of the seating, a bit bland and uninspiring. The hot cross buns were excellent!"
Good and solid Italian Food,"Basilico used to be known for its awesome appetiser buffet spread before COVID. Since reopening they had to adapt and did a great job so far! The set menus as well as the a la carte selection offer a wider variety of choices. My favourite is their soft burrata cheese with tomatoes as an appetiser. For dessert I highly recommend their version of a tiramisu,
There is a lot of space between tables due to social distancing and hence one has privacy and other tables can't overhear our discussions. If one wants a slightly more formal Italian dinner this should be on your list!"
Confusing with Citibank 1-1 dining,We are disappointed as the restaurant cannot honour Citibank 1-1 offer despite when we sat down we told them we wanted that offer. We were being offered a weekday menu (which looks 90%) similar to the Citibank 1-1 offer. And claimed that because we should have booked through their website. We only got 15% discount.
Excellent Service,"Dinner at Basilico was special. The starter of mozzarella, parmesan, burratina, olives and heirloom tomotoes was delicious and generous. It was customised to our dietary requirements. The lobster risotto was creamy and tasty. I could easily have foregone the dessert platter. The tiramisu and panna cotta were the only two that I enjoyed. Service was topnotch and the private dining area had a great ambience. Many staff members checked in with us throughout the meal to ensure that everything was fine. Our waiter even offered the young man at our table a complimentary dessert platter but he chose not to partake, and ordered of the al a carte menu whilst we were having the restaurant week menu."
Regent never fails!,"Great food, service, ambience. Lobby lounge food served at Basilico was unexpectedly delicious and a nice divergence from the usual Italian at Basilico."
It could be better.,"The experience was good and the food was generally fine. but the service was slow and we have to asked for some of the courses for them to be served. The risotto was plain and not ""al dente""."
Nice Brunch,"We quite enjoy dining at this wonderful restaurant. The last visit was a bit underwhelming to be honest. The service wasn't as good as it usually is. One of the waitress Ms. Apple seemed to be rather rude in her demeanour. The food was pretty good but not as good as it was the previous time we had visited this restaurant. We will surely be back, just hope that we get better service."
Average brunch experience,"I've been wanting to brunch at basilico for the longest time so the good: grilled angus beef sirloin, oven baked focaccia, porcini mushroom and black truffle risotto...

Need to improve:
Service staff tried their best. Food wise, everything was very average, the starters were alright but I don't care for so much antipasti or salad, the desserts were ok, cheese platter was underwhelming (aren't they famous for this). When we asked service staff if we could just tell him what we want because we don't want food wastage, he grimaced and told us everything is all ready to be served on platters (so i guess, no? They ended up clearing alot of uneaten food from our table).

They put 2 bowls of pasta on our table like they are doing us a favour, without explaining what they were until we had to ask, one was the risotto (good), the other was a potato gnocci that we hardly touched and we would have rejected if given the option (food wastage again). I get it that it's a brunch with a fixed menu but if I am paying, can I not tell you what we want to eat or don't want to eat based on the menu? There are no deviations, and we will not complain that we are being short changed, we just like some things more than the others.

Even the premium seafood, foie gras (wasn't bad but wasn't good either) and grilled lamb chops (tough) were disappointing for what we paid for. When they said poached boston lobster (ok), slipper lobster (alright), tiger prawns (good) and scallop (ok). All the seafood were cooked and iced and some people like that, but ours tasted like they were still defrosting prior to being served so parts of the lovely chunky crab legs and lobster claws were part icy mush, part sweet and fresh. Shame...

Ambience: There was a group of tipsy guests banging on the table and shouting at each other that afternoon, was hoping for some peace...

So if I had to pay $108++ per pax, I would skip the brunch and come back for lunch or just ala carte, for the dishes they do well...or maybe just head over to Summer Palace for better food and value for my money."
Exceptional Service and Delicious Food,"Celebrated my best friend's birthday and received excellent service, especially from our server Roy who was very attentive to our needs and always giving out a friendly vibe. Thank you and will definitely return again next time!"
Yum!,Great food and service! Will definitely be back again. The brunch selection was both generous and delicious.
Lunch at Basilico Regent Hotel,Good food and good service at Basilico restaurant Regent Hotel. We really love the pasta and seafood stew! Mr Prem served us and he was friendly and helpful. Definitely enjoyed the meal!
Basillico,We visited for an anniversary dinner. The food was excellent the seared tuna was perfect. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Well recommended.
Food makes up for the service...,"It was Dad's birthday - so we booked a semi private room and expected top notch service, however were very disappointed with the lack of smiles, lack of proactivity, just lack of any warmth. We ordered a bottle of Chianti, which took at least 25 minutes to come (on a Monday evening!!), and had to request for menus, request to order. We had to drive the whole dinner. Lucky when the burrata and antipasto showed up, it made up for the lack of service. Very fresh, delicious and beautifully presented. Mains were equally good and kids meals were generous portions! When we asked for any dessert with no nuts, they had nothing...which seems peculiar in this day and age when so many people suffer from nut allergies. For Dad's birthday, they brought a log of chocolate mousse - must admit it did NOT look appealing to the eye...literally a log of brown stuff...but tasted rather nice. The dessert platter was very disappointing. Overall we had to ask ask ask ask, nothing came naturally, even water! In the end, we also asked for car parking ticket authorisations but the waiter failed to tell us that it is not applicable in the Regent's outdoor carpark, only undercover....it would have been nice to have been told rather than being charged $26.75 on the way out for 2 hours of dining. Overall, average...."
no buffet. Now it is 3 course meal.,"Antipasto was fantastic. The main course beef was okay. I was not asked how it should be done, so they did medium. I wish I was asked. Capucchino was made by machine. It is not great. For high end restaurant like this, they should not use machine for coffee."
Wonderful lunch on 31st Dec,"Last day of 2020 and we celebrated by having one of favourite cuisine, the Italian and obvious choice was Basilico. Awesome menu from cold cuts to warm pizza and then mains and delicious desserts served to our table instead of buffet service.It was such a lovely afternoon time. The staff were nice and their warmth hospitality made the difference. Surely coming back again."
Still a wonderful place for lunch,"Used to be a regular at the buffet lunch. But ever since covid, it has become sit down lunch. There were many items that were not on menu or were not available, I guess it's because of supply chain issues. But nevertheless, thanks for trying your best to make the experience as wonderful as ever."
Very sad,"We booked 26th December brunch. From the second we sat down our server told us we had 1 hr until he served desserts. The whole time we were there he made us feel under pressure to eat and leave as fast as possible. They charged an upgrade for seafood which for brunch feels like a standard especially given how much this cost. We were chased out and this was all the more galling given people who arrived before us were still leisurely finishing their food. We turned up on time so that couldn‚Äôt be the excuse, very disappointed and wouldn‚Äôt recommend. We asked to take the food home given we weren‚Äôt given enough time to eat but were refused, terrible waste of food."
Great service and food,"Great food and service. Our server, Rishvi, was really attentive and great with recommendations. Really love her service."
Wonderful Cosy Lunch,"Excellent food & service. Staff were friendly and attentive, especially Francis. He was very alert to our needs and go out of his way to service us. üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº"
"Nice place to dine in, weirdly felt uncomfortable with the rushly served courses","Had Saturday brunch at Basilico. Felt a little weird as we do not know how it works and nobody came to us to ask for whether we were going for the basic or luxury course meal until we reached out. Once we placed our order, the luxury items came together with the starters, which were a little over the top and felt rushed. All items listed in the menu are lumped together on a plate, which felt kind of odd. Subsequently, even the main courses came together in a plate (imagine sea bass, lamb chop, steak all lumped together on a plate).

I guess due to COVID, the experience was kind of weird. We paid $270 for 2 pax, but it somehow felt like a cheap buffet meal we can get for $50 max per pax. I guess i would come for ala carte during this period."
Disappointing,"We booked early for the Christmas Brunch at Basilico as it has always been one of our favourite buffets. They seemed to have had trouble adapting their buffet to the new normal as the food was very disappointing. It started reasonably well with the antipasto although I was disappointed not to be offered a choice of burrata - especially as I am not a fan of black truffle. A selection of breads would also have made a nice accompaniment. However, it was the mains that let it down, comprising a rather sorry looking plate of meat and fish with little in the way of accompaniments. The turkey dinner was even poorer - thick wedges of turkey crown, no roast potatoes and overcooked, dry sweet potatoes. The deserts were very good, although I was intrigued by the huge, overfacing plate of Italian cheese at the end - again with no accompaniments. Basilico needs to up its game if it wants repeat custom."
Dinner,Lovely Bday dinner at Basilico. Special mention to Ms Rishni for the lovely dinner service. Definitely a great experience.
Better than expected,We had lunch a week ago. It was surprisingly better than its usual buffet. The food was freshly cooked and served piping hot. We enjoyed excellent service provided by Prem. He kept apologising for not being more prompt and explained that the restaurant was unable to get sufficient staff for this festive period. In spite of that we enjoyed the sumptuous meal.
Need to Improve,"From one of the best buffets in Singapore to just an average place.
Basilico is still having problems to adapt to the new "" serving on the table"" system. The staff while friendly is clearly not enough when the restaurant has a full occupancy making the service irregular and dishes coming in a wrong sequence....................still an OK place but far from what it used to be."
Disappointed,"While it‚Äôs understandable that this long-standing fine dining Italian favorite can no longer have its famed antipasti and dessert buffet, had hoped they would maintain the same quality of food in its new table buffet. Not. Mains were spectacularly unpalatable - beef was like jerky, turkey was greasy, fish was dry. And seating was outside of main restaurant, by the bar in the open hotel area. Ambience too was missing."
Great dining experience,My husband and I had a birthday celebration lunch @Basilico! The food is impressive and service is superb! We had a great time!
Dinner at Basilico was delightful.,"Dinner at Basilico was delightful.
We had a wonderful server (Rishni) who took effort to introduce the selections in the set dinner and helped us narrow down our choices. Her recommendations were also spot on and the food was amazing!
She was also an excellent photographer and offered to take photos of us with every course.

Thank you and we look forward to come back to Basilico for their famed buffet!"
A Basilico Covid-era Experience,"Visited Basilico for an anniversary meal. There is no longer an entre buffet, and a 2 or 3 course lunch is served instead.

The appetizer selection is a passable replacement for the offerings during normal times and generous servings are given.

However, the mains were poorly done. The seared Seabass was undercooked to the extent that it was raw in the centre and translucent, and could not be cut through with the fish knife. Upon informing the staff, they were apologetic and provided a replacement shortly after.

That said, the encounter with raw fish left a bad taste coming from such a well established restaurant, and I was left wondering if I would suffer any stomach upsets after the meal."
Fabulous food and service,"They gave me a complimentary dessert plate. Such impeccable service throughout. Wish the place was quieter but it being a holiday for school children, families were out in force."
Great Dinner,Celebrated my birthday with my family. Waiter Mr Shern gave us top notch service. 1) advised us not to over order 2) took great photos of my family 3) served us with warmth and a smile. Will be back again!
