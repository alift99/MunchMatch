Dinner,"The food was amazing!! The staff very welcoming. Nesh is the best!! He was very kind, super helpful, and enthusiastic to share his recommendations."
Authentic Italian taste at reasonable prices,"I happened to eat at Waterfall many times. I am Italian, live in Italy and my kids are very Italian-taste oriented. It is difficult to find places like Waterfall.

Personnel is great, food is authentic Italian (specifically, from southern Italy - Puglia), most of the key ingredients are imported directly from Italy and Chef Simone and his team (Gwen, Julius and Ravi Kumar among others) are always on the spot to help and support.

Lastly, beside the great location and the friendly-business casual setting, it is worth noting that pricing is kept at reasonable levels for Singaporean standards.

Well done!"
