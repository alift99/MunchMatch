Perfect place for good wines and pasta,We had a perfect night with high quality wine and an amazing pasta carbonara for a good price. Service by Azam and Shamil was very friendly and smooth!
Wonderful experience,"Had a wonderful dinner with the delicious food served by our lovely server, Zee, who was actively providing suggestions on our first visit. Especially loved the ambience of the whole restaurant as the seating was adequately spaced and nicely lit."
Excellent food and service!,Was served by Zee during dinner service and had a very pleasant dinner! Food was amazing too. Definitely worth coming to try!
First tim here,Service is good. Food is well prepared and nice looking. Nice ambience too. Zee is a very hardworking waitress which is very respectuful too
Yummy deserts & cocktails üòã,"Good Vibes, great service by Azam & Khairul ü•Ç love the atmosphere‚Äî an open concept bar ‚ú®will be back! ü•Çü•Çü•Çü•Çü•Çü•Çü•Çü•Çü•Çü•Çü•Çü•Çü•Çü•Çü•Çü•Çü•Ç"
Great Atmosphere,We would like to compliment Azam and Khairul for the great service. We had ordered the O‚ÄôConnor Ribeye Beef Steak and the Duck Leg Confit and both were delicious. Really enjoyed the atmosphere and our dinner.
"Amazing experience, great servers",Food was great and the server (Z) was extremely prompt and friendly. The bottomless mimosas were well worth it and tasted great as well. We had an amazing time:))
Dinner on 19 Jan 23,Awesome service by service staff Zee! She was very attentive and went above and beyond to provide an awesome service experience. Keep up the awesome work! :)
Oyster Promo @ Ginett,"Great food. Oyster was fresh (albeit a little small, but cheap with the promo). Drinks were good, really liked the city rose I ordered. The burnt thyme infused into the drink created a unique aroma."
Buzzy place for Buzzy people,"Booked a table the day before, as this restaurant fills up very quickly. Most of the tables were full of young executives under the age of 35 meeting after a hard day at work . It's a lively location and it gets noisier as the wines flow. Regrettably the service was exceptionally slow , we waited an hour for our food. Other tables were also trying to secure the attention of the staff for service. They said they had made a mistake with our order, apologised and made amends at the end. The Cocoqulet de fermes roti de herbes ( Roast baby chicken) and mash was mouth wateringly delicicious, and the wine which I drank by the glass more than acceptable. Prices are quite reasonable. Unfortunately I am now part of the grey market and so given the time we had waited for the food once we finished eating we left. However for the younger eater, who likes great food then this is a definite place to meet and enjoy."
Wonderful dinner,"Went thr for my bf's bday, good service from Zee, it was so amazing. Food is fantastic! They provided us a free bday cake and a red wine as well! Definitely will come back next time ü•∞"

Lunch drinks,"Food and drinks was awesome here. Zee was a great waitress , super hospitable and attentive. Please give her a raise please"
Group dinner,"We had our group dinner on a Thursday night. Our group of 25 pax was taken care of by Suraishi (I‚Äôm sorry if I mispelt your name!). She did such a great job handling the group‚Äôs requests and sending out food promptly.

The food was great but portions could be reduced for better enjoyment of the courses.

Ambience was great too, recommended for group dinners :)"

"Disappointing. Food quality deteriorated, service was slow","Went there with my partner for their Hokkaido Scallops as it was good the previous time we were there. However, today the scallops were slightly undercooked. My partner had oysters, but the size of the oysters shrunk. Service was pretty slow, some staff ignored when they saw us waving at them. Overall a disappointing experience, might not return."
Excellence service by Nur Aisyah,Nur Aisyah was attentive and made sure we were well looked after. She anticipated what we needed and was always at hand when we needed her assistance. A gem indeed - excellent service.

Hotel G with delicious food restaurant.,I go to have G and have dinner there. There is a good restaurant with great waitress service. Especially the lady by the name of Aisyah. She recommends to me Western food so detail and patience. I had good meal with my mom tonight. Thank you about it.
Great place to celebrate birthday!,"Food was good, service (by Zee) was impeccable, and there was even free dessert and wine for birthday celebration, thanks!"
Great value in convenient location,"We had a memorable dinner at Ginett. We arrived at about 6:30 pm without a reservation and sat at a nice table for two by the windows. We had lobster bisque, lamb shank with mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and carrots, French bread, and orange juice. For dessert we had ice cream that was arranged with blueberries and strawberries. We felt that the service was exceptionally helpful, all of the food was well-prepared and delicious, and the cost was reasonable."
"Nice deco, average food and below par service.","Nice ambience and deco. It was not very crowded during lunch, I do see some empty tables around.

We ordered a 2 course Set lunch ( $18++), you can choose from a salad or soup. Pork belly or fish.

I chose the soup and pork belly and it was not too bad.

We were quite disappointed that the additional cheese plate we ordered was without crackers and served without a knife.

Service there definitely could be better though, not expecting fancy, just the basic. The staff all generally don‚Äôt look happy or friendly.

Host did not even greet us or welcome us when we first stepped in and we had to request for essential cutleries.

There are seriously better options for this price range."
Amazing food for a good price!,"[Served by Shamil] The ambience and the food was great! Asked for some red wine reccomendations and Shamil reccomended me a good one to go with the beef cheek. Beek cheek is super good btw, melts in your mouth"

Thank you to Azam and Shamil for the wonderful service!
B-day dinner was great!,"Great food, ambiance, with very attentive and warm service from Zee! Was there with a group of friends to celebrate a bday!"
Why haven't we stopped by sooner,"Lived on mount sophia for a year and had this spot on the to go list, but unfortunately only made our way after we moved to a new neighborhood. Totally regretting that now.
Here on a Saturday night and it's popping.

Food tastes fresh, flavorful, and exciting.
Man the Hokkaido scallop special tonight was bomb

Shamil's service was the icing on top. I'm glad we had the bar seat. He delivered on the wine recs, and was so personable and funny. I wanna be his friend. He made our night. Thank you.

Will be back and recommend anyone and everyone to come by. Esp for their lunch special which we'll be back to try."
Best experience in Ginett,"Was here on a weekend with a couple of friends . Initially was late for our gathering , but they are so kind enough to hand us the bar seats .
That‚Äôs where we met Azam and Shamil who is serving us at the bar. Honestly , they made our experience a wholesome lovely night that I will never forget . Service is wonderful from them, wine prices ? Affordable af , and the best of all? The vibes .

10/10 would definitely recommend. Hit them up at the counter as well. Friendly and welcoming !!!"
Worth to come back,"Good food, free flow mimosa at affordable price and will definitely be back! Great service from Zee and she gave us good recommendations on the cheese selection for our 1m cheese board"

"Fantastic food, awesome service","Every dish was fantastic! Oysters were so sweet and fresh. The festive menu sundae was refreshing and unique. Zee attended to us and her cheery demeanour made the wonderful experience even better. Busy night but she really went all out to make sure we had a good time, and we certainly enjoyed ourselves! Can‚Äôt wait for our return visit!!"
1 for 1 oysters!!,Had a great time here and the oyster promo was worth it. Good vibes overall and impeccable service by Zee too ^^
Excellent dinner and service,"We were served by Zee. Attentive, polite and service with a smile. We will come back here for her. Had the olio scampi, g board."
Dinner,Get birthday dessert and wine from the lovely staff Afiq. Good in service and food is nice and delicious
Happy birthday turns out to be a remarkable one.,"Actually we came here to celebrate and yet it turns out to be the most unforgettable one. They ignored our table ok fine, then after an hour plus dessert arrived yet our main courses haven‚Äôt even serve. We asked for the 2nd time around and we waited again and then we we told the lady to cancel our order, perfect suddenly it‚Äôs already cooked and prepared? System glitch or human error? Is it just because we are Filipino? That‚Äôs why we are treated this way? We don‚Äôt have an appetite at all. You want to do a service recovery? Yet twice or more we‚Äôve been neglected. You must treat each customer fairly as we are also in the service line. We are patient enough to under the situation but we leave this place nothing but a big disappointment."
Waiting in vain,"We came here with a smile knowing that we‚Äôll be having a good wine and dine celebrating our friend‚Äôs birthday. But the thought of a good celebration turned into me writing into this review because of infuriation. We ordered our main course , we just thought it‚Äôs just taking so long, but as we waited for more than an hour, we have finally asked one of their staffs, we still understand that they forgot our order and their reason was there was a ‚Äúglitch‚Äù in their system, and that was still okay. But the second time, they forgot again. But the worst thing was, as we just had received our order, the staff ( who took our order earlier and forgot our order)approach us and ask for last order, and never even apologise for what had happened earlier. We just had received our first order after 2hours and you are asking us for the last order???? In addition to this, I‚Äôm still talking to the staff about the last order but she went off and served other customer! (While I was still talking, how‚Äôs your good customer service in that)This is the worst bday experienace we had. Definitely not recommending and NEVER coming back again. Definitely a negative rate in this restaurant !"
Long wait. So disappointing.,"We were here for a friend‚Äôs birthday. We came at 7pm. Ordered appetizer and wine as soon as we arrived. Wine came first but appetizer came half an hour later. When one of our friends arrived at 730pm we ordered our main dish. The staff even recommened 2 different steak as it will be enough for all of us. One hour later, they served the birthday cake instead of the main dish. When we followed up they said no order was placed under our table. So we vented out our frustration since we have been waiting for more than hour. Minutes later the manager came and never apologized. She mentioned that it was system glitch and if we want dessert it will be on the house. As if we were asking for freebies. So they said they will expedite the order, 40minutes later the steak didn‚Äôt arrive yet. As soon as they serve the steak, they asked for last order? How are we supposed to enjoy the food? It was supposed to be a birthday celebration after not able to see friends for more than a month but we were all frustrated as there was no sense of urgency even though we have complained more than twice!"
Ran out of wine,Went with a group to celebrate a friend's birthday. From the start we were ignored by the staff. After finally getting attention (at least 30 minutes after sitting down) and trying to order wine they proceeded to tell us they had run out of MOST of their wine. Just the very expensive bottles left. This was on a Friday afternoon too. The staff were rude. One even rolled her eyes. A once favourite and much frequented restaurant has gone downhill and will not be returned to.
"Great ambiance, wine, and service","Very nice vibe. Came here to celebrate a birthday. We got the communal table with a designated waitress, Zee, who was very nice and helpful and made everything easy for our group. Thanks !"
Great night,"This place has a friendly ambiance. The food was delicious! Had a great time! Thank you for the wonderful service, Azam! :-)"

Friends :),Food was great and staff were very friendly especially our server Zee ü•∞ wonderful experience overall! üíñ
A good place to celebrate birthday,Recommend to make reservation before go because alot people going there and its located below a hotel. Celebrate birthday there they provide cake and wine. The environment there is good and the food there is delicious
Evening Wedding Celebration - 8.00 pm,"Evening celebration with family of friends ( My son and daughter in law) . The food, wine and ambience were fabulous. Special thanks to Zee - she was attentive and helpful throughout the evening . Nothing was too much trouble especially topping up the glasses. Thank you"
"Good service, nice food","I would say 5 stars for the service, and probably 4 stars for the food. One less star because the oysters were mediocre.

Service by Zee was top notch even though it was a packed crowd at dinner. Offered a free dessert to celebrate our special night as well.

Would come back again to try more of their dishes."
Great ambience and service,Love having birthday celebration here. With complimentary dessert and wine. Thank you Zee for the pleasant service and checking on us.
Great food and environment,"Had the burger and it was so good. Bottomless mimosa great and staff so friendly, overall an amazing experience"
Great service,"Great service by zee, despite having to manage a big group. Food and wines were decent, and the portions were surprisingly much larger than expected."
Tr√®s bien,"Great service by Zee! Came here for a birthday celebration. Food and service was impeccable. Warm bread was served complimentary as well, where can you find this in SG? If you haven‚Äôt given Ginett a try, what are you waiting for?!"
Service is only good when the manager is around.,"Food is absolutely great (obv overpriced as it is a French place in asia).

Atmosphere is good, nice music, and interior design.

Service as soon as the foreign manager is not around is absolutely disgusting.
We will only come back if she is here. If not, it is definitely not worth it."
Great food and excellent service,"Restaurant was accommodating to children, food was great and surpass expectations. Nice ambience. Our server (Fhezenia) was attentive and kind. Would return again. Foie gras bikini was good, scallops were delicious too."
Celebrating Birthday for friendü•∞,"Food is nice, and also $15 for free flow mimosa is nice. Excellent service from Fhenezia!! Thank you so much for having us!! Free ice cream puff will be provided for birthday celebration üç¥yummy!!"
Ginett Singapore,"Azam was an excellent bar tender. Prompt service, great manners and very personable and professional. Would recommend."
Food and service ratings,"Foods are nice and tasty, service staff very efficent and friendly. Tried first time set lunch really enjoying."
Quality,"To be honest, my favorite restaurant in Singapore! I go there 2-3 times a week and I am always eating well. Prices are amazing for the quality. The only problem, the service ... staff are not kind at all and not helping if you have any requests. Also, they are not welcoming and smiling which is sad in this kind of environment. The pasta is amazing and it is the best value for the price but I don't really recommend the steak.
Finally, I will definitely go back but hoping for a better service ."
Great experience,"Had a very enjoyable evening, was attended to by Fhenezia who was very attentive and helpful. Food is generally good, the lobster bisque really stood out to me that evening as well as the wine Fhenezia recommended."

Nice Food & Environment,"Food is pretty tasty and is served in generous portion. Environment is ambient for having a hang out night with friends.

Family Celebration,"Zee is very helpful and friendly, the food and ambience is nice! As birthday, we have dessert and a free wine, appreciate and thank you!"
Fantastic food and service,"The food at Ginett never fails to disappoint. The grass fed beef, pork chop, duck confit were all great. Their prawn ceasar is the best ceasar salads I've had in Singapore in a while.

Despite always being packed, the service at Ginett was wonderful as usual. Fhenezia, our server, was very attentive and helpful.

I genuinely don't think Ginett needs any more rave reviews considering they are regularly full, but they deserve it."
friendly great service,We had the pleasure of having Azam serve us. While he was only learning he had a kind nature and happy attitude making it a nice experience.
Great dinner and dinner service!,Was here for a birthday celebration and Afiq took great care of us and provided superb recommendations for both the desserts and cheeses! Would highly recommend the you to visit if you're in town and looking for some french inspired cuisine!
Thank you Afiq!,"We tried the French Onion Soup for starters, followed by a pork chop, cauliflower steak and truffle risotto for the mains. All the food we ordered were great, including the birthday dessert that was served. Thank you Afiq, our server for the night for the great service!"
