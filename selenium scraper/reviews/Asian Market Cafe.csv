Birthday Celebration with Friends,We chose to have dinner & birthday celebration @ Asian Market. Served by Azizi - very attentive & courteous. Made our visit much more delightful.
Birthday/ CNY/ Get together,"Good spread for the buffet table, love the durian pengat, even enjoyed preparing my own food like the rojak and laksa.

Azizi is also very thoughtful in ensuring that our dinner experience is relaxing and that we stay hydrated by topping up our glasses with water. For that we are truly grateful for his kind attention."
Appetising food spread with exceptional service,"This is our first time back to Asian Market Cafe post Covid.

The service was impeccable with the wait staff being extremely attentive. Thank you Imran and team! We will be back for sure!"

AMC....Such a lovely place!!!,"I have been here several times past many years. Its a great lunch buffet option. AMC is best suited for a mix of diners with various preferences. Team business lunches will find this a fab ""suits everyone's"" needs kinda place. the serving staff is kind and helpful. though vegetarian options are not that many, the staff quickly whip up stuff if needed. Getting here used to be a challenge, its quite tucked away. But of late more detailed signage from level 2 Starbucks at Raffles City Mall to AMC is very helpful"
Lunch buffet birthday celebration,"Food is awesome with wide variety of choices. Special shoutout to staff Asmadi who made our dining experience much better.

Extremely disappointing,"We had a meal this place today around 8pm today because of all the great reviews here, but then I found it very disappointing. Some food (quail eggs and cooked seafood) did not seem to be too fresh and most of the buffet bowls were empty. For the price (over $80 per head, ended up being $200 with tax and service fee and one soft drink) it was not worth it at all. Not sure whether I can trust TripAdvisor reviews for the restaurants in Singapore anymore :( It was very disappointing. Service was nice though."
Worth the visit if you have craving for food and do not want to overspend,Pretty decent food with this price .. one for one deal .. service is great and keep refill of water and clearing the plate .. the staff handle the crowd well and keep refill The food and never left the tray empty ..
Birthday & Wedding Anniversary,Shebana was extremely kind & helpful to get us a table even though it was full house. Food was good but variety of food was lesser than previously. Nevertheless had a good time of celebration there.
birthday dinner,great place to dine with family for birthdays or anniversaries. reasonable pricing. love the food and ambience.
Good Casual European Bites,"Nice coffee, decent pastries and pasta. The service was polite and efficient at an easy location by the indoor fountain"
Excellent service!,"Food were topped up in timely manner, servers and staff were quick and proactive! Food were of good quality and cooked perfectly, highly recommended!"
First visit after lockdown,"Great service and mouth watering food.

Staff service very pleasant and efficient and would definitely return for more of all the food delights."
Great food and staff,"Food was delicious and worth the price. Great ambience too. Love the cold items section especially the salmon sashimi. Eat lots of it. Guess the chilli crabs nice since there's a long Q. The best part was the durian dessert. So creamy and delicious!
Last but not least Mr Asmadi the server was very helpful, diligent and friendly. It was an enjoyable experience being serve by him. Keep it up Mr Asmadi!"
"Impeccable Service, Truly.","Dear Aug 15 Dinner Team, special shout out to Mister Asmadi for providing me the best seat in the house. I am currently 29 weeks expecting and 7 minutes into my visit I was offered a cushion to support my back! Totally a pleasant and unexpected gesture, might be simple to some but to me‚Ä¶.Superior service.

Throughout the entire time, men in suits were consistently on the move pulling equal effort to ensure plates were cleared, drinks were topped up and trash were cleared. It takes great leaders to transform an even better teamwork. Top Gun material indeed these floor managers.

Its been a few years since I came back and a decision I did not regret.

Thank you very much for making this night memorable for me and my family."

The spread was a variety of asian food which was surprisingly exceeding my expectations. Everything we ate was fresh and there were live stations and always seeing them topping up food, you‚Äôll never see an empty warmer.

The staffs there were friendly, helpful , especially Mr Asmadi who came to approach us even going to the extend of getting fruits and desserts. Pretty commandable despite full house!

I highly recommend this restaurant."
