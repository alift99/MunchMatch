Food was good but we have tasted better with lower or similar values,"While there are a wide variety of whiskey offered, the value we felt is not the best. The food were nice & tasty but we have tasted better. The atmosphere Fabulous and service was good."
First Time at Bedrock,"It was my first visit for a lunch with a customer.
I ordered the set lunch (3 courses) with the fish fillet.
Everything is actually well cooked and portioned.
And the service was great. I went earlier at around 11.50am before they open, but they have provided me a temporary seating outside and serve with glass of ice water while waiting for the actual seat to be ready at 12pm.
If the thermistors lobster of SGD165/- could be lowered, I will probably try it next time.
Thank you so much.

Excellent customer service,"My partner highlighted that her steak was a little too salty . The service staff immediately arranged to replace without any question . At the end , the staff even waive the dessert as he apologised for making us wait for the replacement steak as gesture of goodwill . Great customer service definitely the place for great steaks and good service"
Q T Pie Review @ Bedrock,"The food was good and fulfilled with LOVE , especially the handsome guy sitting at the end of the table"
great food and excellent service,"my family stayed in oasia resort sentosa we had breakfast at bedrock everday for the duration of our stay. service is prompt and their staff are friendly and efficient. since breakfast starts our day, am glad that people at bedrock ensure that we have a good start with their welcome smiles.

we also had our christmas dinner at bedrock and the food is great. and service is again excellent.
my family would like to thank Mary, amy, joey, kenneth and suha. thank you for a memorable experience"
Disappointed,"Ordered the set lunch, rib-eye steak, not sure if it's because of price difference therefore quality of meat was underwhelming. Ordered medium rare but came medium, meat was quite chewy/rubbery/veiny. Far different from when I last ate here. Sis had the pepper steak rice bowl. Meat was barely chewable. Staff who cleared the plate Didn't even bother to ask what was wrong it. I guess this separates service from the not. Was not going to kick a fuss to have them take it off the bill. But I think the bare minimum one could do was ask."
Not the best experience with bedrock,"I have always had my sister birthday celebration at bedrock but this year, the experience were far from positive.

Steak with different level of done-ness were served wrongly to our group, where we had to get assistance from the staff to switch the steak within the group.

At point of ordering, already indicated the desserts for set meal which we requested for hot tea and coffee instead - only to be asked again by a very rude staff on what we ordered for dessert with a very bad attitude and tone.

This is turn totally ruined the birthday celebration mood for the day"
Dissatisfied,Food was not good and overpriced. Staff didn’t explain clearly the menu nor giving any recommendations about the signature dish
hospitality in it’s most genuine nature,"it was a meal to celebrate the boy’s coming of age. birthday boy had a satisfying meal, but declared that Bedrock Origin was much better, having dined there a year ago. the sauteed mushrooms sounded ordinary when introduced but it was truly delish when served. the button and shitake mushrooms were juicy without drowning in seasonings. they even had a slight crunch to them signifying that they were not overcooked. the Mac & Cheese had a pungent truffle smell when served but didn’t overwhelm the tastebuds. in fact, it complimented the mac & cheese so well it brought the old-fashioned dish to another level. the porterhouse steak we had, according to the birthday boy, was good with the right doneness 85% through but faired when compared to Bedrock Origin.
however, what struck us and left an indelible mark in our memory bank was the hospitality rendered by Pugan. we had the privilege to experience what true hospitality was about. he gave recommendations suitable for our fam of 3 and readily shared when asked what the dishes were about. he was attentive without being intruding and went the extra mile to offer a replacement quickly, when we shared feedback, slightly unpleasant, on certain food served. when we rejected, he apologised, thanked us for the feedback and quickly passed it on to the kitchen. when the bill was presented, he explained there was a discount and this was for the food that was served that didn’t meet expectations. we were very surprised by this extra extra mile Pugan has taken, without even being asked. Thank You, Pugan, for making our first visit to Bedrock Bar and Grill, a memorable one."
Very Good Food and Service,Awesome service and food! Great choices Steak was done perfectly (medium rare) Salad was good and that charred taste was epic Tomato soup was excellent
Amazing,Amazing food and ambience. A perfect place to have celebrations or even just to perk up your day. Highly recommended.
Excellent steaks,"My son is a serious steak eater and declared the tenderloin one of the best he had ever eaten. I do agree. Cocktails were good as was the wine. We really like to read from a proper menu rather than having to get it on our phone though, and it often took a long time to find a waiter to assist us. Plus for the price I might expect some fries at least to come with the steak. Overall a lovely experience though."
Excellent,"Everything was really nice, especially if it's for a birthday. They give you a small nice slice of cake if you just let it know beforehand in your reservation. Atmosphere and service was excellent as expected."
Belated birthday celebration,I celebrated my 58th birthday with my family on 21/8. We had a most enjoyable experience and the food was excellent! We were also impressed by the service staff who were patient and polite and very obliging. We will definitely return!
Great steak and service,"One of us had USDA Prime Grain-fed tenderloin and it was so good. Tender, juicy and full of the sweetness of the meat. Service staff was able to recommend the type of beef and wine to go with it. Will definitely visit again."
Poor Service and Steak Quality,"The service staff was absent when taking orders. The Grass-fed Ribeye was so tough and sinewy that the steak knife had difficulty cutting it. My lunch companion left half her steak uneaten. It was so embarrassing.

I will not go back again."
Excellent service & food,"One thing you can't find in most restaurants nowadays are the excellent services aside from the food quality. This restaurant still keep the quality of their staffs services and also the food. If you come for anniversary/bday, there'll be a surprise dessert for you. Also, the distilled/hot water and flatbread is freeflow. Highly recommend as one of the best mid-high class restaurant to go to."
Great service and food!,"the food was really great, the pita was super fresh and fluffy! and the huge apple crumble was a great surprise! Along with the cake for the bday! Servers were really nice and helpful and service was quick too! Had a wonderful time!"
Birthday Dine in for 2,"Had mac and cheese, bone marrow and black pepper steak. Love the quality of all 3 dishes. I prefer to eat the black pepper steak without dipping the black pepper sauce. I love it as it is! The staff there were also very kind to provide a birthday dessert as I wrote under my reservation. Very thoughtful of them!"
Excellent Service and food,"This is our 4th time here.

The staff is very attentive and helpful as usual. The food comes with no surprise. consistently good. Meat doneness is on point.

I have indicated that this is a wedding anniversary dinner in the reservation and to our pleasant surprise, my wife and I were presented with a very pretty cake. the staff even offered to take a polyroid picture of us. This picture will definitely go down our memory lane.

thank you Bedrock for the wonderful experience. And we will certainly go back again."
Good food and services,The food and the services offered by the staffs is excellent since my visit. The staff called me for my need to have earlier timing for my third visit recently. The food is fantastic and makes me to go there again.
Dining for lunch on a weekend,Had a lovely Sunday lunch at Bedrock Bar &Grill. Was there to celebrate my bf bday and we enjoyed the food. We ordered their set lunch and I must say it is value for money. Very nicely grilled tenderloin & ribeye. Definitely will be back. A place to celebrate as well as dine & wine.
Enjoyable dinner at Bedrock Bar and Grill,"Nice ambience, lovely food, tasty flatbread and excellent service from 2 gentlemen and soft spoken, attentive Angeline"
Good quality meat and cooking,"We ordered the Dry aged Porterhouse, which came with generous amount thyme butter and it paired very well with the beef! The meat was tender and done according to our request- Medium.

The accompanied garlic was excellent too. Done sufficiently well such that the bulbs were soft and yet not over-cooked."
very good will return,pepper steak and mac n cheese very good complimentary dessert for birthday finally service was impeccable as well
Best steak and oysters,Probably the best oysters I ever had. Steak was undoubtedly awesome as well. Would definitely return.
Very disappointing. Not recommended,"We went to this restaurant to celebrate my birthday, after not having celebrated for 2 consecutive years having been stuck in Vietnam die to Covid. We arrived back in Singapore on the 2nd May, and on the 5th May we really looked forward to ""properly"" dining out once again.

For a start, the waitress that greeted us was haughty and to verging on the point of rudeness. Okay, we just just gotten back into Singapore and being the first time dining out, we didn't realise that we had to keep out masks on until food or drinks had been served. We'd appreciate the advice in keeping in line with the law, but there was no need to shout and slap the menus on the table as a result.

As for the food, there was more disappointment to come. I asked for my steak to be cooked ""rare"". I am a steak chef myself and I can feel the doneness of a steak. My steak was served medium, edging on the verge of being well-done. I brought this up, was disbelieved and was asked to cut my steak right down the middle into two halves......point proven, it was close to well done.

A replacement steak eventually turned up some 15 minutes later, but it was bland, devoid of taste and shodilly cooked. You could almost say that the steak wasn't even seasoned. This is definitely not a $99 steak.

Sorry, but this place falls way short of my expectations, given the price of food charged."
Disappointing,"The restaurant was supposed to be a steakhouse, but disappointingly, the worst dish of the meal was the steak. We ordered the kombu for sharing at the recommendation of the server as the porterhouse was not available. We ordered it medium so that the children could also enjoy the steak. However, it turned out raw! Only the bits at the corner were edible. Every other part was bright red and rubbery to the chew. It was impossible to chew and swallow and we ended up having to spit out more than half of it."
Today eve of mother's day.,"Eve of mother's day is not a public holiday. After visiting Bedrock Grill, I realised, Triple Plus may not be valid. Mother's Day should be gazetted as Public Holiday soon.
My advise to the esteemed organisation, please do away with all these discounts and promotions. Confusing your poor customer and staff.
Pressed chicken was on the average side. Barramundi was excellent.
James service was excellent."
Little less than fancy,"Had the lunch set. Comes with choice of appetiser, main and dessert. Waiter/waiter est was attentive to your request. However, nothing really fancy. Ribeye was good, potato wedges had the black coating of the pan stuck on it. Dessert was ok, for sweet tooth’s might be a bomb. Will consider to visit again on occasions, but not a frequent."
Fantastic food,Excellent outing with good food and decent wine. The tenderloin was very well done and please try the mac n cheese
I’m impressed.,"I highly recommend Bedrock Bar & Grill for those seeking a premium steakhouse experience. They really know their cuts and the menu won’t disappoint. We decided to try both the USA and Australian rib-eye served family-style with the delicious Mac ‘n cheese, truffle fries, spinach and aged whole snapper. The portions are generous so do arrive hungry."
Perfect!,"The starter, french onion soup was so good and you may ask for more serving of the bread which they served at the beginning. Steak living up to expectation. Good even without the dipping sauce. We were so full that we didn't get to dessert. Certainly going back for the full experience."
Good Family Dinner,"We were hosted to a family dinner here and the experience was pretty good.

We started with heirloom tomatoes with burrata, which was very fresh. The onion soup was robust and hearty tastewise, while I especially liked the Mac & Cheese, which was charred nicely on the bottom and was not overly heavy with the taste of truffle oil.

We also had the 1kg Porterhouse, which was around 700 gms after cooking. It was tasty, but some parts were a little red for me. I actually preferred the ribeye cap steak, with the sauce.

Oh, they serve a Naan type bread with roasted garlic and butter. It was delish. Do not think it is free flow, but you can request another piece.

Dessert of apple crumble with ice cream was so good that some of us wished for more, but cooking the dish takes too long.

Service was attentive and the dishes were paced well. It is a casual dining place, and you can people watch as you eat."
Excellent Service and food,"The service staffs were all very helpful, attentive and friendly. The food was delicious, especially the wagyu which was completely melt in the mouth wonderful. Thank you very much for the delightful lunch!"
Lunch Date,the food is good for sharing. Good environment and chill place. highly recommended! can come with friends and family. The service is superb.
Extremely poor service,"This restaurant has such a bad hospitality service
We went to the restaurant, got sat down.
We asked immediately for service staff and wanting to get a bottle of water, got an reply of: we will get someone to help, and that never happens
we waited for another 10 mins, asking for assistance, got ignored
It was so pathetic that we had to storm out of the restaurant
The staff should be ashamed especially at this price point
Plenty of restaurant in singapore that offers excellent service, sadly this is just not one of it"
Lunch Feb 2022,Was expecting a better cut of the tenderloin steak. Asked for medium rare but turned out tough to cut and chew. Atmosphere is great. Set lunch was of reasonable value. The starters were better cooked than the mains.
A treat for myself,"The food and service are excellent as usual. Staff pays attention to me and refill my bread without asking. Towards the end, staff came to check on how’s my meal."
Awesome birthday meal experience,Brought my hubby for a birthday lunch date and it far exceed our expectations. Food was good and staffs were attentive to our needs. The meal ended with a complimentary birthday sliced cake and a polaroid to commerate the date:)
Tasty with excellent service,Booked a dinner slot for my girlfriend’s birthday and it was a great place for a date! Atmosphere was fantastic and the staff were friendly and recommended the right stuff! The mac and cheese was the best and the dry-aged porterhouse platter was insane! beef fat melts in your mouth and the meat was so tender! Also they gave us a cake for her birthday FOC!!! Thanks again! Will come again!
Nice atmosphere,Went there for my fiancé birthday and had the set lunch. Worth it and restaurant took note of my special request for his birthday
Disappointing steak. Overpriced.,"First time here and I must say probably also my last time visiting this place.

Considered to be one of the top 10 streak house on Singapore but the quality of the steak is sadly lacking behind some of the other big names within a similar price range.

Ordered one of their woodfire grill bedrock pepper steak 300g $108 and 300g ribeye cap steak $128. The quality is similar to those within the range of a $30-50 steak. And 2 side dishes - truffle mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms, it's disappointing for that price to be served a below par for the side dishes.

Service and ambiance is decent but again nothing to shout about especially when the meal comes up to $400 plus with a bottle of wine for two."
Bedrock is rocking :-),"Great food, good service, cozy venue. Satisfaction to the max! Will go back again for the food for sure."
Always a good dining experience,Awesome dining experience! Food was tasty plus the defining moment for me was the impeccable service by the team especially Maria! Been here for a number of times and I must say Bedrock doesn’t disappoint everytime I dine in. Looking forward to visiting again!
Great ambience & amazing food,"My friends & I had a lovely time catching up on NY Eve at Bedrock. Their service was excellent, menu interesting and delicious, especially the roasted bone marrow & Rib eye. Conveniently located too."
Good food and great service,Not my first time but my family's fist time. Again no disappointments. Food is consistent and fabulous and accentuated by the impeccable service of Gary!
Incredible food & service!,"It was my first time here and I’m really impressed with the quality of each dish. Ordered their Bedrock Pepper Steak which was cooked perfectly in medium rare as requested; the Iberico Pork Ribeye is soft and tender, and it complements really well with the veggies sides. We also ordered a Mac & Cheese and it was hands down the best I’ve tasted! Enjoyed the Shiraz although it is pricey for a glass of red wine. Lastly, we had the Bombe Alaska for dessert & it came as pictured in the menu - picture-worthy with a strong taste of rum! Overall, both of us thoroughly enjoyed the meal; might return again to try other dishes! ;)"
Great dinner,"Celebrated my boyfriend’s birthday dinner here, great food and ambience. Bedrock even prepared a complimentary creme brûlée for the celebration. Would recommend to friends and family 👍🏻"
Good steak good service,It is easy to over order as the portions are huge. Just order for one and a bit more and split for 2 px. I love the byo mondays
Impressive as always,"After a very impressive meal with them a year ago, my husband and I decided to return to celebrate our anniversary with them. We were once again amazed with their level of service, food & ambience. The T-bone steak, and foie gras side was excellent and they gave us a lovely dessert surprise as well. Will definitely return! Thank you team !"
"Friendly professional staff, outstanding beef & Mac n cheese","Servers were very professional, spoke softly, so that other tables could not hear you. Allocates waitress to ensure consistent service delivery. Rib eye cap is a very meaty and is an eye opener. Pepper steak was amazing, good amount of fat and char and the mac n cheese is simply amazing. They also gave a Polaroid picture and complimentary dessert for my partner’s birthday celebration. Overall great experience and highly recommended!"
Amazing food & service,"Started we some complimentary bread, freshly made. Love it!
Really great steak - we ordered the double cut poterhouse to share. The doneness was perfectly medium rare. The birthday boy was also surprised with a lovely chocolate mousse cake. For someone who doesn't like dessert in general, his plate was licked clean!
Birthday boy was happy and very satisfied, thats all to make the entire experience memorable."
Great food as always!,"Been a year since last visited this restaurant, and the food quality has been consistent. First time tried the porterhouse and my wife said it’s one of the better steak in Singapore. We ended our meal with Bomb Alaska, and it was a satisfying to say the least. Definitely one of the few steakhouse to visit frequently :)"
Wanna-be top tier steakhouse which is severely let down by its service standards,"I've been to bedrock several times and it's one of those places that's a hit-or-miss. I've not good experiences for the times that I've come for dinner but my lunch experiences have always been good.

Bedrock has a solid value-for-money set lunch starting from $32++. We had the burger and the pepper steak rice set. The burger was fantastic for the price. Meaty, flavorful with a good hit of umami, this was one of the best patties I've had in a while. The BBQ sauce was smokey and tangy without being overly sweet, and brought life to the burger. I prefer this to the famous dB burger (which goes for close to $50 for just the burger itself). At $32 with a dessert, I'd say this is a far better deal. The pepper steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and the foie gras was done well. The beef fat fried rice was indulgent and tasty, with heaps of smoke flavour. This came with an appetizer and dessert ($58).

What really lets Bedrock down as a ""top-notch steakhouse"" is its service. At its prices for dinner (averaging close to $100 per steak), this is the amount you'd expect to pay at the very best of steakhouses such as Cut, Morton's, etc. It wasn't too long ago that Bedrock was selling its steaks at one price-tier below (at around $70 per steak) before its price revision, so it's clear where the owners aspire to be. In my previous experiences, Bedrock has always lacked that personable, warm type of service top steakhouses offer. They lack the efficiency of a true fine dining establishment that one would expect for the prices they charge. For example, I found myself requesting at least 3 times for a top-up of water when this comes automatically at the best of restaurants. You also have to try quite hard to catch the eye of a server. Quality control can be suspect at times. There was one visit where my steak had to be sent back not once, not twice, but three times as it was overcooked (medium-rare VS medium-well)- a definite no-no when you're paying over $100 for a steak. I also had a less than pleasant experience in my most recent visit.

I called in late at about 12pm to make a reservation for lunch at 1245pm. I was duly informed that there was only outdoor seating, which we were ok with. When we arrived, I enquired if there happened to be any indoor seating in case there was a cancellation. The lady at the front of the house then very curtly replied that 'I already told you there was only outdoor seating when you called.' This is not something you would expect to see from an organisation that is aspiring to capture the upper echelons of the fine-dining market. Aside from that, service was decent and friendly enough (albeit rather slow) but that exchange did set the wrong tone for our meal, which was unfortunate since we were celebrating my wife's birthday that day.

TL;DR: Really good food (at times), but service leaves quite a lot to be desired before it can be safely considered a top-notch steakhouse."
Excellent food and service,Great steak and loved the mac and cheese. Waiting staffs were very attentive. My steak came slightly charred and upon feedback the staff promptly exchanged with a new piece. And we were given a free dessert as we were there for our anniversary. Enjoyable all round!
"Disappointing quality of beef for the price, even at 1-for-1",Came here using a 1for1 voucher and was still disappointed at the meat. Felt like Astons except at $108 for a pepper steak. May not return if not for the free corkage
Cheers to 30 years birthday dinner for bf :),"A very good ambience restaurant. I booked this restaurant to try their dry aged beef. We ordered a 30 Days Aged Vintage OP Rib. The portion was big for 2 person and served with side dishes. It was delicious!!

Their service was great! Thank you for the complimentary dessert! It surprised us and we really enjoyed it."
Enjoyable Birthday Celebration,"Booked in advanced for a birthday celebration and requested for a quiet corner. Service staff welcomed and ushered us to our seats, and food came promptly, within 15 mins.

The steak was really good and flavourful and done just how we preferred it to be, not overcooked nor undercooked. At the end of our meal, service staff surprised us with a complimentary cake for the special occasion, and polaroid. Very good service and steak, surely enjoyed ourselves and worth the 1 for 1 entertainer deal"
Good but not top,"A few superior things at Bedrock: the freshly-baked, hot mini pita bread served with roasted garlic; the sinful but delicious bone marrow; and the very friendly and efficient service staff. Good variety of steak cuts (in my opinion, the best are the signature Bedrock black pepper steak and the cap steak, both rib eyes). The problem is they are not as flavourful or as professionally cooked as at premier steakhouses, like Cut, Wolfgang, Morton, or Bistecca. The only reason I go here is because of the various Entertainer discounts."
Very disappointing. I don’t recommend going.,"Very disappointing. I don’t recommend going.
So many better steak restaurants in Singapore, and much less expensive.
The porterhouse steak was overcooked.
I think the crab cakes were frozen and re-heated, as they were tepid and soggy.
The truffles fries, we were assured has fresh black truffles, but I think it was that awful truffle oil. We couldn’t eat them.
I asked for the truffle mashed potato without truffles, as they said that they use the fake truffle oil. They mashed potato came hard and tasteless.
We left most of the food."
Tomahawk! 🥩,"Visited Bedrock a few times and decided to go for a Tomahawk this time round. Well, it did not disappoint. Ambience is dim & cosy, appetiser was served fresh and taste perfectly with butter & garlic provided. I’ve a good meaty night!"
"Good ambience, great service","It's my 2nd time dining at this restaurant and comparing with the 1st time which was a lunch, the dinner was comparatively costly. That said, service and ambience was good.

Now, to the food. The 500g USDA dry aged T-bone had a typical stronger smell due to the dry aging process. The texture of the steak was tender and doneness was quite accurate to that of a medium. That said, I wouldn't say that the quality met the value for the price, especially so for high-end steak house.

Ironically, I'm more impressed with the Iberico pork ribeye. The texture, tenderness as well as the flavour surpasses expectation. Again, not the cheapest but this one, in my opinion, definitely worth it.

The sides have to be separately ordered. Portion is large for sharing and the Black truffle fries was generous with the seasoning.

Pair the above with 2 glasses of the Terrazas Grand and Terrazas Reserva (Argentina) with the latter recommended if you want an easier drink. The Terrazas Grand might not be worth the higher price but does offer a full bodied, longer finish on the palate."
Decent steaks but doneness needs work.,"And that's not subjective. Medium-rare is pink in the middle.... not a graduation of brown and only a hint of light pink in the middle. We had the porterhouse and it arrived medium-well. A pity.

Just bad luck for us or a kitchen that needs to work on a more concrete method of assuring the right doneness.

The flavour of the meat was still decent, a good cut but we'll be having second thoughts on a future visit.

The joint has a nice ambiance but for a serious steak-eater, I like to put my moolah in some experienced meat meastros."
Fabulous lunch,Perfect place for lunch with close friends ! Casual yet smart venue. Tenderloin was succulent and Italian Rosso tasty!!
Always perfect!,"Back again for a dear friend's birthday celebration! The team is always attentive and professional, and their steaks are always perfect! Very good location and ambience is friendly and cosy. Will be back!"
Possibly the best place for beef western style,"Go for the sharing cuts, any of them. Lamb Rack, Tomahawk. Double Cut Porterhouse.. Mac and Cheese a must. Oysters are great but on the steep side. Grilled vegetables are a must. Go on Mondays for free corkage, Grilled cheese is personal. Apple Crumb is awesome but do not burn yourself."
No need to dress up for table fellowship over good food and wine!,"I’ve eaten at the restaurant twice so far; dinner with family of 5 on a Sun night was so good I returned for a Sat lunch party of 3. The food was good; reflected in the price, the wine recommendation from Calvin both times were excellent; I ended up hunting down the local distributor to order 6 bottles, and overall service was attentive but unobtrusive.

My only two negatives was that they ran out of the roasted bone marrow the first time - yum! - and they sat a family with two young children - one of them was screaming quite regularly - just next to the three of us in what might be a private room which did make us jump mid-way through our conversation!

My favourite part about this restaurant: no dress code. Smart move!"
Expensive but worth every cent,"Steaks here do not come cheap, but they are worth every cent, get the dry aged steaks if you can. The wait staff provide top notch service and special mention to the flatbread provided at the start of the meal"
Wonderful Experience!,"Like many others, we went for dinner at Bedrock Bar and Grill for a birthday celebration on April05. Our server's name is Meet. The service was splendid, at no time was Meet over intrusive, yet he was attentive to us through the whole night. His recommendations for the food and drinks were delightful! Its rare to find a place in Singapore where the servers know their food and drinks so well, and are truly delightful to talk to.

Atmospherically, the place was extremely complimentary to the service and food that you get there. All in all, it's on the pricer range but if it's a celebration, I would suggest for you to go, and really heed the server's recommendations."
A little lacklustre to be fair,High expectations not met would be the story here. The oysters were warm and not chilled properly and the dry aged steak was 50% fatty tissue. I'd prefer to write glowing reviews or none at all but Bedrock is expensive for what it was and didn't deliver the value. Wine pours are very light but the staff was very attentive and the atmosphere (if you get a booth) quite good.
Too much to improve,"Visited this place a few times in the past so decided to bring my family here for Sunday lunch after the kids dance classes.

We were sat outdoor so probably a full house indoor. It was not that humid so we took up the offer.

There were no kids meals but the main course from the set meal came quite promptly. However, we were not fortunate for ala carte.

The ala carte orders came terribly late, seriously late. I'd say at least 20mins later. We ended up with kids finished their meals and the adults still not eating. Trust me, it's a pain to be hungry but the waiting time made the hunger away and kids hurrying and telling you they want to leave the table because it's taking too long.

Not only did the food came so late, the side dishes were not delivered. Not sure if the server or the kitchen missed the order.

It was annoying cos the table that came about 10 min later had their meals & left.

I can see that the staff weren't attentive to tables outdoor cos dishes were left uncleared with birds attacking it. Also I would like to advise placing the bread plate on the table only when it's occupied because birds were just landing and walking all over it. Simply disgusting.

Food wise, besides the fish & chips. The ribeye was over marinated, the Braised oyster blade was too dry and the ginger couscous was too strong for my liking. But the bone marrow is highly recommended.

I could see that the servers were doing their best so service wise it was good."
Dinner at Bedrock,Enjoyed the food and they remembered is for birthday celebration even we have postponed the dinner for another week.
Exceptional first class service by MEET,"We went in a group of 7 and we were lucky to be served by Meet who patiently and with impressive expertise introduced and recommended the menu items to us. He took care of the table very well, making sure that we got our orders right. It’s not everyday you come by a service personnel who serves with a genuine heart to make you feel so at ease as if you are dining at home. His smile (despite the mask), warmth and sense of himour throughout our dinner was the cherry on top of our experience at Bedrock. The Devesa meats (from Argentina) which we tried from the “Meat the World Series” were exceptional, highly recommended to the max! We tried the various cuts and each cut was superb in terms of taste, texture and value. Must try!

Hope to see Meet at the upcoming Sentosa Bedrock!"
Great overall experience,"The set-lunch was worth it, the portions were actually bigger than anticipated and the Tenderloin was really nice (better than the Ribeye in my opinion). Service was good, had some nice complimentary bread with garlic and butter. Good for special occasions!"
Loved it the first time. Disappointed with my revisit,"My steak was a little dry and the foie gras was so small and nondescript, unlike my previous visit in January."
Food and service,"Very nice and cosy ambient for birthday celebration with my partner. Food was really good and above our expectations. We ordered ribeye cap steak with red wine sauce and Mac & cheese (recommended dishes by the waiter and was very satisfied with it). Both me and my partner were overwhelmed with the food served especially the mac & cheese; really unexpected. And, we were greeted with excellent service throughout the meal, especially the waiter who is serving our table. Thumbs up for him (p.s. we could have asked for his name and give him the credit..he is an Indian guy). At the end of the meal, we were caught on surprised with a complimentary birthday cake that was served to us by the restaurant. Thank you for a great meal experience at Bedrock."
Worth every penny!,"Arguably the best steaks we have ever eaten. We had the Ribeye Cap Steak and Bedrock Pepper Steak. We also ordered Mac n Cheese as a side and it took us straight to heaven!

We were given a comfortable table tucked in a nice corner almost akin to having our own private room. To top that off, first class table service from Meet, definitely worth commending!

This steakhouse is worthy of a revisit in the near future! Looking forward to be back again."
Enjoyable night,food was fantastic and the service is top notch. Quiet place for dinner to bring my wife out for a good dinner. we have the ribeye cap steak and black pepper steak. we enjoy the ribeye cap steak alot.
Food quality is superb but the service is very slow,"Service is unexpectedly slow for the price. Need to keep on checking our coffee, bread, bill etc. But must say the food quality is good,"
Great value set lunch,"I've been to bedrock several times, but the past two experiences prior to this weren't great. The steaks didn't taste like a hundred bucks- the average price of a steak here- and the service was slow. All that's seemed to change, and hopefully it's here to stay.

We came here for the set lunch, which includes an appetizer, main and dessert for $58++, which is great value. We had the truffle and mushroom soup, and salad for the appetizers; ribeye and pepper beef bowl for mains; date pudding and burnt cheesecake for dessert.

Standout dishes: pepper rice bowl came with a generous portion of wagyu pepper steak, onsen egg, foie gras and beef fried rice (some onions and pumpkin as well but who really cares about that right?). The steak was perfectly cooked and tender, and while there wasn't much marbling, it had a crisp crust coupled with a great smokey flavour. Every bite was juicy and tender to the last bite, even at the end of the meal when the steak was cold. Fried rice was beefy and paired well with the rich foie gras and creamy egg.

The date pudding was paired with a gingernut ice cream. The spongey pudding soaked up the delicious ice cream fabulously, and you could taste the flavours of the ingredients without it coming across as too sweet.

Service-wise there was a marked improvement from the last time I went (in 2019). Service was polite and brisk, and the server even made the effort to let us know there was a 15% discount with MasterCard on ala carte items! Unfortunately we didn't manage to get her name, but it's small gestures like these that really helps make for an enjoyable dining experience.

All in all, a fantastic meal and we'll definitely be back again soon!"
Good steak,"Tender and cooked as requested. What more could you ask for? Recc getting the dry aged steak, and mac n cheese. Best in townz"
Perfect steak and attentive,"Perfect steak and attentive service as usual. Truly appreciate the service of the staff on 7 Feb who served us. They all seem to be in sync, everyone knows what was going on as many tables were celebrating an occasion as well. Those who were serving the indoor section wished us an happy anniversary whenever they past by. We spotted a foreign object in the water and service recovery was prompt. Thank you!!"

Anniversary Lunch Date,this is not the first one we visited the restaurant. the meal is great and ambiance is awesome! highly recommended. thanks for the great service!!
Will be back again!,"It’s definitely not my first time dining here, and i would strongly recommend to steak-lovers. Thumbs up to their service crew who gave good wine recommendation and went round tables to ensure everything was well! Lovely!"
Not recommended,"Service : Sucks big time. Depending on what time you call the reservation hotline, you would be lucky to get someone talking to you on the line.

Even when you reached the restaurant, no one is at the counter to serve or greet you.

Food : IMHO lousy, considering the price factor. Better steaks elsewhere. iSteaks or Aston’s have better tasting and cheaper steaks to offer. Or even Jack’s place.
My order today:
Bedrock Black Pepper Steak - nothing fantastic or out of the ordinary
Tenderloin - asked for medium, served well thus it was tough.
Caesar’s salad - nothing to shout about
French Onion Soup - ok"

"Good food, good service",My wife and I went for a Christmas Eve lunch on an Entertainer booking and were very satisfied with the great deal on the good food and good service.
A must-go place to close for the year!,"Bedrock is always a dream place I love to go with closed friends. We have a great celebration for a friend’s BD + wrap up for the year. Very good service and heart-warming place to spend with lovely people. Their food is also world class standard. A must visit restaurant at least once a year! Thumb up to the team, they have a lovely and fun team too. Memorable night we have:)"
Great steaks and more!,High recommended for their flavoursome steaks! We also ordered their mac n cheese which was good too!
Good service and good food,"My partner and I had no idea what to expect from this restaurant. So we randomly ordered a French onion soup and 2 steaks which were super flavourful.

The ambiance was superb, pretty design and relaxing music, perfect for a date.

The server was extremely attentive, constantly coming to attend to us, topping up our drinks, etc."
Birthday dinner,The Ribeye steak is awesome!! Overall service is excellent! Although it’s a bit expensive but it’s worth every penny!!
Bedrock Bar and Grill Experience,"I reserved a slot for 2 (to celebrate my boo's birthday) and they called to confirm on the day itself. I asked if they sold cakes, and they said they will provide a complimentary cake for my partner. The cake was a work of art, and had rum-filled berries inside :-)

We had the Ribeye Cap Steak and the Bedrock Pepper Steak. Extremely tasteful and delectable!! We also ordered Truffle Mashed Potatoes and Creamed Spinach, Poached Egg, Cheese. Superb~

Although it was all very filling for us, but we managed to finished all (but the mashed potatoes cause carbs xD)

I also had a nice glass of RockFord PS Marion Tawny Port wine to pair with my steak. Delicious."
BEST STEAK EVER,"Everything was great, the service, the people and even the dessert! I will definitely go back to celebrate my anniversary!"
