Don't miss out on the chilli crab!,I make sure I get the world famous chilli crab every time I visit Long Beach Dempsey whenever I'm in Singapore 🥰 (this is my 3rd visit)
"Nice setup, sadly very poor service and mediocre food","I made a booking for 6, but when I arrived they were trying to put us on a table for 4 with the excuse that they gave us an indoor table cause it might rain. My advice to them was do not take bookings when you do not have enough tables. It took 30 minutes for them to sort a new table for us.
And 45 minutes since I arrived before I was given menu or water. The restaurant was very under staffed. Waiters were clearly exhausted and miserable. The managers was trying their best to keep people happy, but you couldn't help dire situation. Everything took much longer than normal and a lot of effort before you actually got it.

Lo hei was too sweet that it was distasteful. The honey squid was also too sweet. And I have sweet tooth. The other dishes were good. Black pepper crab was the best one.

The place is nice, but service was shocking beyond acceptable, so I would not come back.

The manager tried to do service recovery and talk nicely to my daughter, promising ice cream after dinner. The ice cream never arrived."
Bad experience,billing took 30 mins even after I pass my card to the cashier. Crew was impatient while taking order.
Good dinner with one major flaw that almost spoiled the whole experience,"Went to their Dempsey branch after many years. Always liked the quality of food here. Glad to see they turned their ugly concrete deck into a nice covered seating area.

Service was still very good and friendly and they helped us to split a group of 12 into two tables last minute. Also helped choosing right sizes of food with kids and all. No complaints.

Food quality was very good as well. The classic Chili and black pepper crab still got it.

The only thing I got really irritated by and not sure if this was in place before is the outside toilet right next to the restaurant entrance, where people usually queue up to wait for their table. You couldn’t stand there due to an extremely nasty urine smell. Not sure who planned this, but it’s the first thing you noticed coming to this place. It almost kills your appetite completely. It’s disgusting. They need to change that asap."
Great place,"There were many people, and saw many fantastic food. We ate fish soup, crab etc, even durian which was fantastic! It was quite similar than creme brulee, dont miss it!"
Very disorganised,We hired out the restaurant for lunch. They placed name cards on the tables for the vegetarians and vegans (which had been provided in advance) but then failed to cater properly for them. One person was given some raw vegetables as as starter and steam vegetables for the main. Others went without because 'we've run out'. Service was disorganised and haphazard. Very disappointing.
Slow service,"Came at 6 pm on a Saturday. Ordered around 6.15 pm or so, and was made to wait almost 50 mins for food to come. unacceptable."
Excellent food and great service,"Excellent and great meal we had on our late lunch. Friendly staff, excellent service. Thanks for the wonderful afternoon. We will come back again."
Best Dining Experience for this trip,Alfresco dining setup amidst lush nature greenery. Great variety of live seafood to choose from. Delicious seafood dishes. The Irish Duck is also highly recommended. This restaurant is pet friendly as I seen guest dining in with their flurry dogs and I wish I had my baby with me. Pricing is reasonable for the quality of food they serve. The best meal I had for my trip in Singapore!
Avoid this restaurant when you are a visitor let the locals deal with them,By accident I posted the review under east coast seafood Centre and somehow I cannot delete it. But this story is related to long beach restaurant chain (location: Dempsey) Terrible treatment when your not local and they simply try to fool you.
The Seafood Restaurant I must visit whenever I am in Singapore,"My favourite seafood restaurant whenever i visit Singapore, my last visit was more than 2 years ago, pre Covid. I was surprised that the restaurant has a new extension wing with a beautiful alfresco area, literally dining under the stars. I booked a VIP room that has a gorgeous lush greenery view but my colleagues were in a mood for alfresco dining, it took them awhile to find us a table coz the restaurant was packed and all tables were fully booked. Thank goodness the ever courteous manager, Priscillia came back and told us one of the tables is more than happy to swap because they were waitlisting for a room. No regrets dining under the stars, the busy restaurant has a vibe of its own though I must say, as with other F&B places I have visited, have to wait a little longer for drinks but the smiling manager was apologising profusely, making the wait easier. Server was professional with her recommendations and kept stopping us from ordering too much. We decided on the amazing white pepper Alaskan King Crab, sweet, succulent and meaty, we love this dish, our must have on previous visits, as good as ever. The Dungeness chilli crabs were heavenly, again the order taker tried to stop us from ordering 20 buns which we wanted to dip with the sauce. We finished these and practically cleaned up plate till the last drop of the delicious sauce. She suggested that we should try other seafood & brought us upstairs to the aquarium. I have never seen so much live seafood in a restaurant. The large tanks were filled with an array of live crabs of different species, a variety of lobsters & some rare seafood, what caught our eyes were the not too pretty Geoduck. It was our best decision to try their geoduck sashimi served with a broth which the server recommended. This is the freshest geoduck I have ever tried, price was very reasonable, compared with what I used to pay in a Japanese restaurant and many of us have not seen a whole live geoduck in a tank. My colleagues who were also trying it for the first time agreed and concur they will definitely be back for this. Their Irish roast duck is also a must try, we added a half duck, meat was really tender. We wanted to book a table for the weekend before my departure, unfortunately the restaurant was fully booked and promised to call back should they have a cancellation."
Disappointing. Expensive.,"Food portions small especiallyvegetables. Even Chilli Crab portion was small although we ordered a large crab at 1.4kg ( SGD $160). Pot was big, just full of chilli crab gravy.

Alot of aginomoto in the food. After the meal, we were very thirsty.

Unsatisfactory meal. Disappointing. Expensive. Not tasty. Good food does not have aginomoto. Will not return."
Lobg Beach Seafood Restaurant General Review,"1. I called the restaurant 1+ month ago for table reservations. I used to patronise long beach quite often so I know the manager Kenneth and Priscilla.

2. The manager Kenneth if there is a minimum spend for room. He gladly said *""of course not, for you!*
I did NOT even asked for discounts as times are bad.

3. Manager Kenneth called me slightly 1 week before my reservations and insisted on a minimum spending of S$1000 for a table! He explained that they need to make better profits for a table and it was heavily instructed by b the head office (I'm awed that you treat a regular customer this way ?!)

4. As he is just an employee, I rejected politely as this is an unethical tactic by this business owners!

5. Certainly hope this honest feedback will help in your decision

There's many other seafood restaurants in Singapore which are really good and offer value for money and premium seafood, chilli, pepper crabs etc.

Do not go if you are not prepared to pay exhorbitant prices for the food there!

Service is also terrible."
Manager Jason was terrible,Service from manager Jason Ng at the Roberson Quay was really really bad. He forgot our order and did not even apologise. His attitude was “Don’t care for customers “.
It's raining crabs!,Excellent service plus excellent food! White pepper Alaskan snow crab and Sri Lankan chili crab was the highlight of our post new year dinner!
Delicious seafood in Singapore,"Brought my colleague there as part of a celebration for the birthday celebration ! Felt very welcomed by the staffs at long beach in Demspey road.. we enjoyed the food, affordable pricing and very nice views from where we are sitting in the newly renovated VIP room.. we are very very full and will recommend to my friends and colleagues. Thumbs up and keep it up.. need to mentioned the staff name xuan ( management trainee) and one Philippines girl ( captain )their service is awesome . Will visit again"
Fantastic crab,We really enjoyed our chili crab and pepper crab tonight. Both perfectly cooked and so tasty. We were served by Alice @ Dempsey - she was very friendly and efficient
Didn't Get a Chance to Eat,"We had prior reservations. Our greeter (who wanted to speak in Mandarin) kept us waiting with her about 5 feet from her booth while she chatted on the phone. We waited patiently for her to finish talking. She then indicated that our table was being setup at the outdoor gazebo. In the meantime, the group (with the same number of people) behind us in the queue was already being seated in the gazebo. She then shoved the menus at us and told us to wait. She walked back to her booth. We looked over at Samy's Curry and went there for our lunch."
Excellent Seafood,The seafood dinner in this restaurant was a great experience. The food is fresh and delicious. The service is very good and the atmosphere is plush. The wasabi shrimp was delicious and the crab fried rice was cooked to perfection. The crispy white fish is also delicious. We had a great experience and I eventually became a member here.
Great seafood,"If you are prepared to pay S$88.00 per portion, the chili crab is fantastic. They offered to de-shell it for me, which I accepted, a good idea for an inexperienced gweilo. The sweet & sour prawns are also good, although not authentic Singapore. If you order rice to go with the seafood, tell them you don't want too much - they are over-generous.
The surroundings are a bit basic, but some would say that this is part of the 1970's charm. The access is poor for those with walking difficulties, and they would be legally required to make it easier and safer in a western country."
"Good, fresh and tasty live seafood","Large black pepper clam was fresh and the meat was firm. The sauce was flavourful The razor clam was fresh and fleshy, and went well with the garlic sauce. The fermented bean curd gave the kang kong a good flavour without overpowering it. A good alternative to typical way of frying the vegetable in sambal sauce. The service was very attentive."
very good but stop trying the constant upselling!,"very good food and service generally good but my goodnesss the staff here are relentless in their efforts to sell more of anything. We had a steamed sea bass, full duck and prawn fried rice- everything was well presented and tasty and nice views out to seafront."
The lobster 🦞 was delicious,The lobster 🦞 was the most delicious I ever had in Singapore. Chili crab was huge but not my favorite. Service is quick but I think it’s a bit pricey
CNY loh hei,was disappointed as there was no nice crab during the visit. was there for the loh hei food was kinda nice without sri lanka crab.
Excellent Seafood,A lot of choices for seafood in Singapore. But Long Beach @Dempsey is unique in its location and always consistency good food and service.
Degrading Quality,"I was used to be a loyal customer at Long Beach East Coast Restaurant, I always coming here for its signature dish Black Pepper Crab in the old day.
The last visit to this restaurant was Last year at its Dempsey branch, and the quality was still good.
However during my recent visit on January 9th at Long Beach Dempsey, I felt very disapointed to its cooking quality and food presentation.
The Black Pepper Crab was very dry and hardly taste its pepper. Then the Speciality Prawn as well as its sauteed spinach was very soggy with oil. The Golden Stripe Lobster was messed with bread crumb and not presentable. During that time, it seemed that all of the food was prepared by the trainee chef.
After experiencing these unpleasant meals, I definitely will not come back again to this restaurant."
"Pricey but attentive, responsive service","The seafood's freshness is only superceded by the friendly, attentive, hospitable and very well-mannered wait staff, most of whom are not local Singaporeans. The food prices were steep but worth the money. It was a pleasant experience."
Best seafood,Long Beach has the best seafood in Singapore. I am a huge fan of their pepper crab and other seafood dishes.
Seafood dinner for 4,"We ordered a chili crab and a black pepper crab, a drunken prawn, 4 bamboo clams, a clay pot and 2 taros paste/yam, a coconut and a refillable Lime juice all for SGD $360. It’s not cheap but portions are good size and food quality excellent. The service is good as well. We had a reserved table next to entrance with high traffic so the waiter changed a table for us even though the restaurant was full."
Good chilli crab but expensive,"We ordered chilli and pepper crab., I must say we are not dissapointed with the taste but the price of$88 per crab sounded expensive to me. It was not a large crab even though they told me it is 1kg . I will have to consider other option when I need a fix of chilli crab"
Nice food and environment,Great food. What we like about this place is that it’s not as noisy as most other seafood restaurant even though the crowd is there.
Good signature chilli crab,"The environment is not a modern but keeps a bit of the local flavour. Service was good with the waitress around all the time. There were not that many people ona Wednesday night but we ordered a small crab for 2 persons, with vegetables, some shrimp salad and drinks. A small chilli crab is around SGD80."
Long Beach Dempsey,Excellent food and service . Chilli crab and white pepper Alaskan crab was fabulous . Staff service was excellent. They even help to remove the shell of the crab craws. Friends enjoyed it and I will be visiting again soon.
Long Beach is the OG for Pepper Crab in Singapore,"The home of pepper crab and truly a great place to have it. People compare Jumbo and LB, I think LB has it for Pepper Crab by a good bit. The service is impeccable and while it can be pricey, it’s well worth it for the exquisite food."
Crabs: the best of the bests,"It may not be as famous as other similar Clarke Quay restaurants, but Long Beach Dempsey, in my humble opinion, far surpasses all others in food quality, food preparation and customer care.

I have been there several times over the last few years and I have noticed a constant improvement and updating of the recipes.

The crab, whether it is from distant countries or locally fished, is simply perfect and tasty.
There is no lack of other excellent dishes, from caramelized baby squids to typical local food.

The staff is very friendly and attentive to customers."
Alaskan King (Pepper) Crab ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"Always a great place to bring out of town guests to. This time, we ordered the Alaskan King crab in pepper sauce it was so good!!! The meat was SO good compared with the Sri Lankan chili crab! A bit costly, but SO worth it!"
Great Black Pepper Crab,Great crab and drunken prawn we had at long Beach dempsey for my birthday treat from my hubs. Thank you Cheryl for being so attentive to us and recommendations on the black pepper crab. We really enjoyed the food and will gladly be back.
Great seafood,Our family will always come here for the crab when we visit Singapore. The service is good and friendly and the food too. The huge King Crab in gravy eaten with the mantau buns in too delicious. We also tried the Sultan fish. Sorry dint have time to take photos as everyone tucked in immediately.
For Chilli Crab lovers,We had a grea time here. It is an informal pleace but seafood is awesome. Especially black petter crab. Service was friendly and accomodating.
Great Black Pepper Crab,The concierge at the St. Regis recommended this restaurant for chili crab and black pepper crab so we got both. Price is charged per kilo but staff was great to explain. We liked the black pepper best and had the sweetest waitress to crack it for us...we would have done a terrible job ourselves and enjoyed it just the same. Very casual environment (but we were told that in advance) and not cheap (also told). Glad to have had the experience and the good meal.
Amazing,This is regarded as the best seafood in Singapore at the moment. It did not disappoint. The Chilli Mud Crab was superb as was the fresh whole Sea Bass. The veges were amazing as well. Totally loved the atmosphere and the food - highly recommend
Fantastic,Great restaurant - real treat having their speciality of Alaskan King Crab in white pepper. Superb! Recommend the full dining experience. Service really good.
Very memorable,"Recommended by my cousin, the dishes are very good. The most memorable were 'Gui Fei' prawn and white pepper crab. The prawn cooked till just right and juicy; the white pepper crab not too spicy and can taste the freshness of crab.
We end the meal with a good durian pudding."
Yummy food! Worth it!,"Went to this restaurant with my family and took up the set menu for 4 pax. This menu basically includes some of their signature items. Crab, prawns, dish, etc. The renowned good standard is there. Service is great too. I’ll recommend this."
Tasty and Good Service,"I come to Singapore 2nd times. We enjoyed Seafoods. Especially Chilli Crab is so tasty. Sauce is good balanced, I enjoy with Fried bun."
chilli crab gravy here is sooooo tasty,"chilli crab gravy here is sooooo tasty, not too strong, creamy, spicy, a bit lemony, very complex. I think it's the best chilli crab gravy that I've ever tried so far. Fried mantou is bigger than common mantou. unfortunately crab at the time we ate there is all small (the srilankan). but still great experience"
PRIVATE ROOM,"Had an awesome time with family, we booked the private room so that we could speak intimately. The service by the staff is impeccable. Warm and with initiative, from entering to exiting the resto.

We ordered the Alaskan crab done in white and black pepper as well as a crab done in red chilli.
Frankly I did not enjoy them as much but the white pepper stood out amongst them.

I enjoyed the deep fried fish and the bamboo clams!

The horfun done in two ways- braised and deep fried was pretty tasty although very starchy.

The orh nee (yam paste dessert) was not good. Didn’t have the oomph, maybe it’s the healthier version. They used sweet corn dressing which was not enjoyable fer me.

Good reliable resto, excellent service!"
Great Chili Crab,"After hearing how I could not leave Singapore without trying the famous Chili crab, my wife and I chose LB@D based on the reviews. We were not disappointed! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We went more-so around early afternoon, so we could easily get a table and it wasn’t very crowded. We ordered a 1.3kg chili crab and it was phenomenal! Definitely prepare to get messy...however, included in the price, one of the kind waitresses will de shell it for you (which is what we did and well worth it!). Additionally, we ordered the fried dough buns to dip in the chili sauce and wow they were tasty! Yes, it was an expensive meal, and you get what you pay for, but it was well worth it, and I highly recommend it"
impressive,"A restaurant which delivers confidence to your guests or family with great seafood and local delights. The only criticism I have was our food didn’t come hot enough. Among the 3 flavours crabs we had, my TOP 2 pick was their white pepper and chilli crab. Mantou was not the best."
Customer Delight,Brought my customers there in appreciation for the successful completion of a milestone project. Service was good and food customised for the intended audience.
Good food,"Dempsey is a great destination for restaurants. Long beach is not the most fancy in terms of decor, quite the contrary,
but for seafood it is a good choice. All our dishes were tasty and we had a good time. Prices however are on the high side especially for the crab."
Very popular restaurant - but is it worth the hype?,"This restaurant is located in a popular area with several restaurants. It is a very busy place well known for its sea food. The dinner started with a rather strange preparation of lobster smothered in dark colored flakes of ... I am not sure what but certainly not a wise combination, just a strange way to spoil an otherwise perfectly fine lobster! The best dish was the black pepper crab - delicious. Both the wasabi shrimp and the crispy duck were disappointing. A fish dish (grouper) was served with a very tasty broth. Overall the meal was not disappointing and worth the very high price charged! There are many great fish restaurants in Singapore, but this is not one of them."
Grab the Crab,"Casual, unpretentious this is an eat-only place. No fancy furniture, no great ambience, in fact even the menu is quite ordinary. But the food?....ooh-la-la, yummy, mouth watering and yes.....messy.

The pièce de résistance is undoubtedly the Crab. Specially the Black Pepper Crab. Oily, greasy and messy, but before you take the first bite or rather the first crack (you need to crack it open with a nut cracker to savour the goodness inside), equip yourself with a BIB!

Now you are ready. Crack, twist and take a bite.....soft, succulent. a bit tangy with the balck pepper and above all, most nourishing.

Could have more but to balance the diet I opted for two other favourites:
Beef black pepper and onions .......so good you want some more so next the Beef kwayteow. Some greens, some mango and the palate seduced, the stomach sated its time to go home.

Like the place the staff is homely, friendly and accomodating. The price affordable.

Thumbs up!"
Dinner,"Went there for the Singaporean chilly crab after hearing a lot of good things about this place.
Ordered a huge Alaskan crab- half made in Chilly style and half in black pepper. While the Crab was tasty and succulent .. the chilly crab sauce was a tad bit too sweet & the pepper sauce a tad bit overbearing.
The vegetarian dishes were good too
We entered really late (last order).. so i think the staff was slightly irritable.
Sake & wine were both perfect. Service was fast"
Dinner visit,The restaurant is part of a chain of Singapore Chilli Crab restaurants. It is kit very large but has some super crabs from Alaska and so on and of course is very expensive for such speciality. But the foods very good and it’s worth a visit. They have other kind of foods as well.
Tasty AND nice,Excellent service with superb food and well priced. A great place to visit for lunch or dinner. Good for family dining too
The Pepper Crab is,"Visited this restaurant together with friends and we had pepper crab and chili crab. Must just say that the pepper crab was something very tasty and delicious. Compared to the chili crab it was in a different level, the chili crab was excellent but to me the pepper crab was superb. Location is of course a little bit off from downtown of Singapore but definitely worth the trip to go here."
Sunday lunch,"I had lunch here with friends who used to live in Singapore where to have authentic good Chilli Crab, and this is where we went. We took the MRT to the Botanical Garden station and then a taxi to the restaurant.The restaurant sits in a row of other eating places up a small hill which used to be army barracks.

We were shown to a cosy table in the corner with good AC. The food and service were fast and efficient. The waiters very helpful in recommending dishes and supplying us with fresh hand wipes and aprons.

Really recommend this place."
good seafood,"quality of seafood is good. staff are friendly. razor clams, prawns, black pepper crab, chili crab... all good.. easy to get to if u drive but there is no mrt station nearby if u don't drive"
"Was once a favourite, now will never go back","Booked this place for a dinner specifically for the chili crab. Upon arrival was told that they were sold out of all crab, except the most expensive type and smallest was approx 4kg, making it about $800 as cheapest option for 5 of us just for the crab. Told them it was too big, which meant no crab for us, but they kept trying to sell it to me over and over. Almost left then, wished we did. Went ahead with dinner anyway and ordered other food knowing no crab. Then out of nowhere they ""find"" a smaller crab, 1.8kg. Still most expensive type, but given that is what we came for we agreed to get it, but asked them to remove the scallops we had ordered. 30-40 minutes later food arrives, including the scallops. They told me the chef had already started cooking them when we cancelled so nothing they could do and walked off. Two things, one why didn't they tell me this when we added the crab and two, no way do you start cooking scallops 30 minutes (or even 15 minutes for that matter) before serving. Service was just crap and the whole experience just felt like they wanted to rip us off. Such a shame, always went to this place when in Singapore, will now never go back."
Best ever white paper crab,"On recommendation of a friend we chose this place over the famous Jumbo Seafood... I think it was a great decision.

We had white pepper Crab, Chilly garlic prawns and crispy squids.. Oh my God. What a lovely taste to all of it. We also had bok Choi salad alongside.

The size of the crab was pretty big and so were the prawns.

Pricing was reasonable and staff was very friendly and nice.

Finding a taxi on way back was a challenge but the restaurant folks arranged for one.

Super place.. .Must visit when in SGP"
OVERRATED!!,"We were really looking forward to great seafood especially the black pepper crab. We ordered the large portion of the crab but it was extremely extremely small! We told Sally our server that it was very small compared to other restaurants in Singapore. She dismissed our issue and said she would provide feedback to management. Nothing was done! I was additionally disappointed that they charge you for peanuts they bring to the table. I didn't order these peanuts yet they charged me for them.
Overall the experience was not good!"
"May be for a one-time visit, but nothing special","We visited this famous place in April 2019. We had high expectations because of the reviews and we were excited to try the pepper crab. In our opinion there was too much pepper and we did not feel the true taste of the crab. It was quite spicy.
Costs of this place are pretty high - we spent about 300 SGD for a couple for a set menu. The restaurant was quite dirty to compare with other Singapore's restaurants and very noisy. The waitresses were very nice and attentive. With crab, we had to try a set of dishes, so we tried clams and vegetables - it was good, but nothing special for us.
So we don't not recommend to visit this place."
"Really good food, but slightly overpriced","The food was very good especially the chili crab. I really liked the casual atmosphere as well, however I feel that the restaurant is slightly overpriced."
too pricey for garlic!,"they killed all the dishes with extra quantity of garlic (don miao/ bamboo shell..). crab was ok but not fabulous. along the years, becoming more and more pricey. Also, very difficult to access with prams/wheel chiars"
"If you like seafood, this is a great place to take your foreign guests","Long Beach @ Dempsey serves very fresh and deliciously prepared seafood.We ordered the Set menu that consisted of razor clams, lobster, chilli crab, fish, vegetable dish, fried rice and a dessert. Added roast chicken in case our guests were still hungry."
Outstanding seafood,"Dempsey Hill a former armee base from Great Britain, baracs are now shops and restaurants . Long Beach offers excellent seafood you can sit inside and outside. Very good parking for the cars in that area. Stroll around before you go to the Long Beach restaurant and order the black Pepper Crab, all other kind of seafoood much choice a bit pricy but worth the visit. After dinner a small place for a dessert but I took an ice cream at Ben and Jerry's also easy to reach walking and there are parking sports available as well."
Our First Time,"Great food (black pepper crabs), service, ambience. A little bit pricey thou. Highly recommended! Costs approx S$70 per person."
A restaurant which offers very fantastic seafood,"Generally in Singapore Chilli Crab and Pepper Crab are very popular seafood. And there are quite a few restaurants which offer them. One of most famous ones is this Long Beach. I have visited the same restaurant located in other places and I love the food this restaurant chain offer. My first intention this time was to visit another similar famous restaurant in Dempsey but unfortunately or fortunately that restaurant was full, therefore we decided to have our Sunday lunch here. And it was a correct decision. 6 of us enjoyed À la carte menu thoroughly. We started with coconut juice, then had fried prawn, fried green leaves (name forgotten) with squid. This fried green leaves went very well with rice. Then famous chilli club, which was really good and waiter kindly removed all the shells and served us. It was very kind of them. Next we had Scallop with asparagus, which too was tasty, and then we ate Pomfret with bean curd etc. , which was also very good and this time the waitress nicely removed bones and served. And finally ended with Mango sago with pomelo, Durian pudding Sea coconut with longan bean curd as dessert.
Food 4.5/5, Service 4.5/5 and Ambience 2.5/5"
"excellent food , caring staff and excellent ambiance","You have live sea foods exhibited ,from where you can choose.Excellent food. A must visit for foodies."
Nice chilli crab and fried rice,"Almost all dishes we ordered are satisfactory, except the black pepper which is quite tasteless. Chilli crab with fried bun are the perfect match, not forgetting the fried rice was awesome too. Special dessert like durian pudding was surprisingly good, even my western boss likes it very much."
A different experience,"I went to this fish restaurant on Dempsey Hill with 7 colleagues and we sat at an outside table.

We chose one of the set menus which included one or two dishes that were new to me at the time, including the first course which was geoduck (didn’t know of its existence!) and could be eaten raw with wasabi or dipped in a soup for a short while to cook. Different but quite pleasant. Amongst the other dishes was chilli crab and grouper, all of which was fantastic.

The set menu for 7-8 that we chose was just under SGD700 and the bill was SGD1,000 in total including drinks. I consider that good value, especially by Singapore standards, and I will certainly visit again."
Delicious chili crabs,Lovely location and great food. A good seafood dinner for a group of friends. Service was good and there are some beautiful bars nearby to hop into after dinner.
Excellent Foods and best service,Very nice food especially for pepper and chili crab at there. I have enjoyed there with very professional services and very delicious foods. Excellent!
Chinese new year lunch,Friends reunion at Dempsey Long Beach. Best dish : Cereal lobster... awesome. Very good service especially during Chinese new year eve. Loh hei was good as well.
Have the chili crab,"Crab was definite highlight, didn't have the black pepper which is also highly rated. Rest of the food was OK, the item accompanying the lobster was a bit too salty but overall happy to have visited."
Absolutely loved this place,Staff and Food were awesome we had an incredible night couldnt fault the place had to be one of my favourite meals of the week the full meal was great
Classic Crab,Had both the chili and black pepper crab cooked in classic Singapore style. The dishes along with beef and vegetable dishes were all excellent. Service was very good as well. Great atmosphere in this restaurant. Highly recommended!
Great place,"If you’re looking for Chilli or Black Pepper Crab, look no further. It’s not a cheap place, but the surroundings are delightful and the food impeccable. Give it a try, it’s a good one."
Always bet on black pepper crab here,"Hands down, this was the best black pepper crab bc the black pepper complimented instead of overwhelming the crab, which was quite fresh and big. Sure, it’s on the pricey side, but when you factor in size and quality, it was worth every Singaporean dollar. Would definitely come here again."
"Good and tasty, satisfies craving","Always nice to be back to satisfy our craving for good seafood. We had the special set menu with Alaskan king crab and it was delicious. 1/2 was in chili crab sauce the the other half supposed to be white pepper but came out black pepper sauce.

Next time I'll need to remember to double confirm that I want white pepper instead of black pepper as IMHO white pepper taste better."
Went with work colleges,"Great location, excellent specialty sea food menu! Fresh fresh items as the place has a real cult following, excellent Singapore experience for a newbie visiting Singapore.. the chilli crab..... mmmmmmm"
"Fresh seafood, fun and friendly staff","We had a group of seven diners; one gluten free. The kitchen presented seven courses with Singapore chili crab as the centerpiece. The food was excellent and the staff was attentive and fun. The setting, an old British barracks, was unique."
"Great place, and wonderful seafood","Had brought our friends there for a cure of the local seafood taste bud, after being away from Singapore a long time. Ordered, chilli and black pepper crabs with buns. Herbal prawns. Caramel baby squids. Trio eggs with vegetables. Deep fried you tiao with sotong paste. Overall taste is nice and tasty. And service was great too."
Foodie,"Great family restaurant, we have been here a number of times and always have great food and service. The chill crab is fantastic and my parents loved it on their first visit to Singapore also."
Interesting Cuisine - Unusual Place,"A local favorite food in Singapore is the chili crab. The Long Beach on Dempsey was highly recommended for this dish that we wanted to experience. Reservation required. So we dined there one evening. The restaurant was a bit unusual for Singapore in that almost everyone had a difficult time with English, so it was difficult to make ourselves understood. And the wait staff kept changing. We would place an order with one person then someone else would come along and ask for an order. We ordered the lobster and got a dish with a claw and very small tail covered with a crispy cereal. Most unusual. Lot of cereal, not much lobster, but taste was good. The chili crab was very good and we enjoyed this a lot. There are fried buns to go with the dish that you dip into the chili sauce and there is a lot of chili sauce served with the crab. Interestingly, a plate of peanuts had been placed on the table (which we did not order) for which we were charged on the bill. We were also charged for the fried buns. So, the bill was a bit pricey. While I was grateful that I had a chance to experience the chili crab and I enjoyed it, I would not return to Long Beach for another meal."
This is where I bring my foreign visitors - ALWAYS,"This is the flagship store of Long Beach chain of restaurants - the chief chef came from the main branch in Marina previously. Over the years, they have refined their presentation of food, while generally maintaining the standard of their famous chilli crab AND black pepper crab. When we visit it, we usually order both types of crab :-). The chilli gravy is neither too spicy, too thin nor too heavy on ketchup/chilli sauce; it’s very eggy, has a slight sweetness, and goes all-so-well with buns. The black pepper dish is packed with wok-hei, just right in balancing dryness and moisture. There are other forms of crab that we tried too, but these two are still our perennial favourites.

The restaurant is good for other stuff too. Al seafood is fresh (this is unlike some “self-proclaimed live seafood restaurants” that stealthily use frozen seafood for certain dishes, thinking that the customers are all as dumb as they think). This means that steamed fish, steamed bamboo clams, steamed prawns etc are excellent. If you get the steamed prawns, ask for their chilli sauce - the pairing is heavenly. That same chilli sauce goes very well with the restaurant’s roast chicken too. If your party is at least three to four people, do consider eating the geoduck.

Previously when we used to dine very frequently (almost three to four times monthly), we observed that standard of food differed depending on the crowd. But lately (past one year), I notice they are much more consistent."
Local food at its best,Seafood as much as you can handle. Just great and tasty. If you are not too much into garlic you should tell them :-) Looking forward to having dinner there again
Best Chili Crab,"This visit is a must but please book and make sure you’re sitting outside (otherwise you won’t pass the hearing test). And be careful: there are too many nice starters and you can hardly focus on the crab. Anyway, together with some beers thesis the best chili crab we ever had."
Very delicious,Our Singaporean friends took us here for lunch before our departure back to our hometown. Used banana leaf to eat and all the food was delicious especially the fish head curry. To experience Singapore... must come here!!
Real taste of crabs,"Many people tend to visit Jumbo for Chilli crab. Jumbo is a really good choice for crabs. But its taste is a little bit commercialised. Just good for everyone. On the other hands, Long beach restaurant has an unique taste of chilli crab. The sauce is a little bit spicy but, how can I say, it includes kinds of Chinese ingredient. Very unique and yummy. On top of that, pepper carb is absolutely far from other restaurants. The sauce is quite spicy because of pepper. Its taste is absolutely awesome. And the burn is very very tasty. The fried rice is good enough. Besides, the staff is really really helpful and kind. As you might know, it is quite hard to meet this sort of kindness in Singapore. You should feel well treated here. If you have only one chance to experience Singapore crabs, then you should visit here!"
Great chilli crab,Went for chilli crab and black pepper crab. Fantastic. There were just three of us. But our server was very helpful - got us a couple of small crabs. So reasonable value - would be a lot cheaper per head if there are a few more sitting. But still good value. And great taste.
Worst meal,"I just got home from eating at this restaurant, very dissapointing. We booked and our table was in a parking lot! Crab was great and so was the chicken, the rest was a waste of time. Cost us $600 for 4 and my husband even said it was poor, which is unlike him. Anyway would not recommend and would not return.

The Best Seafood Restaurant Anywhere,"If you think you are going to heaven be sure to try the peppered crab here before you go - exceptional staff (Lynn Lin and No 6 Part Time), Sea bass, whole prawns and noodle goreng were all a delight too. The lemongrass jelly might be an acquired taste but I acquired it. Chilli crab on next visit. Thank you"
Delicious Food,We had lunch here. Away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Simple interior. The service was excellent. The food was delicious. We had pepper crab. A very good seafood restaurant.
Pepper crabs,Wanted an authentic crab dinner in Singapore. Our hotel concierge recommended Long Beach and was leery as I felt it would be a tourist trap. But the restaurant was filled with locals all enjoying local specialties. Our host Essie was extremely helpful picking out what we should order. We ordered both the chili crab and the pepper crab. We all preferred the heat of the pepper crab. It was a very sloppy but fun experience !
Best chili crab and crispy fried fish,"When you go to Singapore you have to try the chili crab, there is so many place where you can eat this dish but the Crab/ food at Long beach @ Dempsey are by fare the best and probably some of the more expensive.
The sauce is so tasty and Moorish, the crab flesh is soft and sweet and you can chose the crab yourself if you like from they thank in the restaurant. You can have a crab to share which can be up to 10 kg. If you find it too hard to deal with the shell or don't want to get messy you can ask for your crab to be de-shell so you can enjoy the flesh with the sauce in its pure form. Bib and finger bowl are available it you really want to get your hand dirty.
The whole dip fry fish was just fantastic, crispy and so tasty with a tangy, chili and citrusy sauce with fresh herbs.
You can seat inside or outside and the service is good and friendly.
The dessert of tapioca/jelly coconut custard was nice to finish your meal.
You can have a set menu like we did in this ocasion but you also can order dish individualy.
Thanks again"
Great for nice seafood,"My friend in Singapore invited me to the restaurant. Great seafood Singapore cuisine, especially Crabs with Black pepper and Chili sauce. The most wonderful point of the restaurant was wonderful atmosphere. The restaurant is in the forest where we can enjoy quietness and fresh air with the foods together."
Long Beach Dempsey,"Great place for lunch, had a set menu and food was very tasty. Good location whilst exploring Singapore and good service"
Great Crab!,"I'm told this is the home of the original Chili Crab. Not sure if that's true, but it is delicious! The Black pepper crab is also great!"
