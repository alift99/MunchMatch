It started with the waiter smashing a wine glass over us and went down from there.....,"Our lunch started with the waiter trying to balance a bottle of wine, bottle of water and 2 glasses without a tray and failing, dropping a glass and smashing it all over our table, floor and my wife who was not impressed.

He tried to blame it on a crack in the glass but my wife saw the whole thing and just said he was trying to balance too much and it slipped and should have used a tray.

The waiter was very apologetic and asked us what complimentary drink we wanted to compensate us. I said Champagne and he said that he didn’t have a bottle open…..which surely wasn’t the point?

It was supposed to make up for smashing a glass on our table which meant we had to move and my wife was still getting glass out of her dress an hour later….!

So we settled for Prosecco although he clearly knew he had done wrong again as when we were about to have dessert he said that a bottle of Champagne had become open and he could now give us a glass. I don’t actually believe him as the Champagne was flat…

The waitress also wasn’t very knowledgeable about anything so between the two of them it was a bit of a joke.

The food was fine if unspectacular apart from the spicey fin which was lovely and the duck with pancakes. The rest wasn’t great including their signature chicken and their desserts were bland.

What a shame, I used to love coming here but it’s gone downhill. It was clearly a sign when the waiter smashed the glass all over our table, we should have left then."
Disappointing experience!,"Globally a bad experience:reservation taken without problem for 9:30 pm.at the arrival we were informed that the kitchen closes at 9:30pm!
One minute to decide what to choose even the drinks which are probably(!)not cooked…
Indian food but the fusion concept is not really perceived.low quality of service and they really wantedd to close at 11pm!disappointing!"
"Great location, great atmosphere, great staff , great menu, great food, great prices.","The title of this review says it all.
-
To which I should add: ‘ great bar, too!’ Good
-
And I would heartily recommend this place to anyone - if it were not for the travesty, the sad and sorry joke, that is the cleanliness and overall appearance of their gentlemens’ toilet.
-
Having said that: a clean entrance would not hurt, either. The used latex glove that was lying there at opening time was still lying there hours later when we left. Shame, really. So easy to solve...."
Fusion Indian food,"We had group dinner here . They serve fusion Indian food which is passable. The jack fruit curry , a special , was very good. The staff are very helpful."
Great food & good service,"Excellent fusion at the heart of Chijmes. Beautiful creations, nice atmosphere. Great hospitality by Ms Malini and her team. Lamb chops is one of my personal favourite and awesome cocktails & drinks. Definitely will return"
Recommended experience,Great and a unique taste experience. Cooks with passion and a attentive service staff. The open kitchen makes the dining to an adventure.
Extensive Menu to suit all tastes,"The menu at Coriander Leaf is quite extensive offering a variety of Asian food. It also has vegetarian options. The plates are for sharing and we ordered the crispy duck pancakes, the Nepalese chicken dumplings and the lamb cutlets. Each dish was beautifully flavoured and the 3 dishes and a small dessert was plenty of food. They also included an “amuse bouche” that provided a pleasantly interesting introduction to the flavours we were going to experience.

The restaurant has a nice feel about it and the tables were full with a buzz of conversation around the room. The staff were attentive without being intrusive.

We had an enjoyable time."
"Decent food, very slow service",Attended a business luncheon and found the service really slow. Asked for coffee 3 times and was told by waiter that he is checking with superior even though it was part of the set!
Delicious Asian Fusion !,"We had a really delicious meal ! The crispy duck pancakes are fantastic but so was the green mango salad, the little curried chicken buns …..& the Pavlovas are very good and possibly big enough for 2!
Service was also excellent, we were given a quieter table with no problem, everything was lovely !"
Nice mix food place @ chimes,"This is a nice place in chimes, spacious and variety of food … just that it doesn’t have open air setup or good outside view .. but inner decor compensates for that

Jackfruit curry, duck red curry and green mango slide was my favourite

Lava cake is awesome"
Good dinner,"First visit, the miso marinated silver cod was above average, portion was rather generous. The stir fried eggplant was good. The steamed white rice at SGD4 each, my most expensive bowl of plain rice in Singapore, didn't taste anything special.

Ambience okay and normal customer service. Probably return to try out other dishes with the different types of naan."
Good comfort food with very nice ambiance.,"Nice and cozy restaurant with Awesome food great hospitality by Mr Clovis and his team. Lamb chops is one of my personal favourite and it was divine, awesome cocktails & drinks by Mr Fred and Ms Kajal definitely will return."
Excellent service,The service was impeccable. The Jack fruit curry is a must-try for all those who plan to head there. I tried their sting ray & wing bean salad yummy
We will definitely be back!,"1st time visit to this restaurant and loved it. Great customer service, ambiance and great food! Really enjoy sitting in front of the kitchen and watching the food being cooked and served, great insight how a kitchen operates . We will be back soon!"
Wonderful contemporary Asian cuisine,"One of our favorite restaurants in Singapore. So good, we have been twice in a week over the Christmas holidays, and we will be back! Highly recommend the lamb chops!"
A Christmas Pairing: Coriander Leaf dinner and Candlelight concert!,"After a year of being apart due to the pandemic, my wife and daughter arranged a special pairing for our Christmas celebration: dinner at Coriander Leaf followed by a candlelight concert at Victoria Theater and Concert Hall.
From the time we stepped into Coriander Leaf and until we left, it was evident that service was considered a priority at this place. What surprised me, however, was how exciting and delicious were their food. For starters, we paired the green mango salad topped by a crispy soft-shell crab with the watermelon salad. The tartness of the green mango salad, the spiciness of the chili-lime dressing, the sweetness of the watermelon and the creaminess of the white cheese created a melange of flavors in our palate that could only be described as refreshingly satisfying. For our mains, we shared the Nepalese momo dumpling, crabcakes, spinach parcel, and garlic naan. The dumplings were light and flavorful but what made it pop was the roasted tomato relish. The white cheese and brown butter sauce for the spinach parcel was perfect for our garlic naan. The spinach parcel was steamed perfectly and the crabcakes had just the right combination of crabmeat and spices. And while we were enjoying the dining experience, Daniel who is a member of the chef staff stopped by to ask how the food was! It was clear that the chefs cared very much about the satisfaction of the customers.
This became more evident when we ordered dessert. My wife wanted the avocado ice cream with fried banana fritters while my daughter ordered the rose pavlova. I really wanted to have the banana fritters but with coconut ice cream and so I asked Daniel if they would be willing to serve it that way. He said he will try and then later personally brought our ordered desserts to our table...with my coconut ice cream! What a perfect cap to a such a delectable and superb dining experience!
My compliments to Daniel, the kitchen staff and the serving staff. You have made my family one of your regular customers from now on. Keep up the good work...and thank you for making our Christmas night-out a truly special one!"
A Surprise Find - Superb Dining experience,"We stumbled on this gem as we went on the hunt for a place in CHIJMES for drinks and dinner with no reservation.
They didn’t have any tables for us but we had the option of seating in front of the chef / kitchen.
Ended up being a fantastic evening as the chef and the owner (who was there that day coordinating service) gave us excellent recommendations. The food was sublime and delicious. Service was equally good.
The advantage of seating in front of the chef?
1. You get to see the food coming out to the other tables so you may choose what appeals to you.
2. You get to chat with the Chef and get his recommendations based on your likes and dislikes.
3. Although you are full, you get seduced into having dessert ( which is not a bad thing) :).

What a great experience.
Will be returning with our spouses / families on the next occasion.
Thank you."
Awesome dining and drinking experience,"We had celebrated our friend's birthday and it was really an awesome night to remember. Not to mention it was our first time trying this place and eating pan-asian food. But definitely it's highly recommended as food, ambiance, cocktails were fantastic! Indeed a good value for money.

Special thanks and huge commendation to Chef Iskandar and bartender Frederick for a good dining experience. Will defo come back and reco to friends."
Yummy lunch at Coriander Leaf,"Frederick and his team are attentive and provide good service. Despite short of manpower, Frederick maintain his professionalism with his friendly attitude, and effort to check on our food. Food was served promptly Thank you."
"Good food, Great Service","Our family of four had dinner here while on our staycation in the city.

James Nasution, restaurant manager, accommodated the many changes we made to our reservation and looked after us very well during our meal.

We liked the braised spicy prawns, crab cakes, red duck curry and soft shell crab. And dessert platter A afforded a lovely ending to our meal. The craft beers and cocktails were great too.

We were amazed at how well the chef managed to fuse the various cuisines; no tacky combinations.

Will recommend."
Nice restaurant with super good food,"Had my lunch here and it was so good. The restaurant was clean and spacious, plus lunchtime wasn’t busy so we got to take lots of photos. The manager was super friendly to give us a quick tour after the meals and explained the menu. All the staff was very polite also."
Delicious preparations & great dining experience,We loved the food and the ambience - very innovative preparations and delightful dining experience. Lamb chops were perfect and flavourful. Best crispy naan we have had in years! Watermelon mint salad was so refreshing as was the chicken main course in yoghurt. The restaurant manager Clovis was very friendly and helpful with recommendations. I am gluten free and absolutely loved the variety - both vegetarian and with meat! Well done for a wonderful dining experience. Thank you Clovis!
Excellent experience,"We expected the food to be delicious but it exceeded our expectations. It was a great fine dining experience that made us travel across Asia and it's different spices and flavours. From the ""mise-en-bouche"" to the dessert it was a very pleasant discovery journey through a variety of dishes. The device was warm and welcoming and very responsive. We loved everything. Thank you"
Excellent Food and Service,Had a great time at Coriander Leaf. Menu was interesting and if a rare demonstration of fusion done right. Great ambience and service as well. Will be back again!
Delivery 1 hr late,"We ordered online at 4 for the delivery at 5, which didn’t come until 6.
They said the system crashed and they didn’t realise, we had to phone up to check where our order was at 5:15.
However lady delivering food seemed nice enough and food was delicious.just the wait time."
"Thai, Jap, Indian, Chinese tapas all in one place. Highly recommended","Our 1st visit to Coriander after reading positive reviews and we were not disappointed! The portions are just right, there is so much variety - Indian, Jap, Thai... We had the Burmese curry tofu, grilled brocoli, garlic naan, lamp chops and miso cod. Curry is perfect with the naan, lamp chops are sooo tender, and we get 2 large cod fillets. My friend had wanted to try the jackfruit dish but the waiter was v kind and advised it would be too much for 2 ladies. He is right, we were so full after we finished everything, really appreciate his honest advice. We will be back for sure to try the other items.
This place is like attas zi char, u get variety of cuisines, in a v nice environment, at reasonable prices. Hope to bring more friends and family here when dine-in is not restricted to 2. Then there can be alot more sharing."
Our first visit...and certainly not our last!,"It was our visit. Just my wife and I to celebrate her birthday. Loved the ambience, food, and attention to service. Frederick was spot-on with his recommendations. The surprise-at-the-end was memorable. A sincere shout-out to Frederick. We will be back."
"A nice option in Chimjes complex - quiet, stylish, delicious","A lovely, casual restaurant in Chijmes complex. A bit difficult to find, on the second floor around a couple of corners but worth the journey. We enjoyed a small business lunch as Singapore opens up more restaurants. The restaurant put everyone in one room which was quaint and not too noisy. Staff were particularly kind and helpful. Menu had many options but we all went for the set lunch and we’re all pleased. I had an Arabian set lunch of some short which was tasty, featuring lamb kabobs and vegetables. All around, a very good choice. Upscale restaurant, reasonably priced."
Simply Wow.,"Had dinner at the Coriander Leaf at CHIJMES and was not disappointed but was wow from the time we arrived. Was greeted by James and Fred sited us. They were very welcoming and put the letter H and S one Hospitable and Service which is hard to come by this days.

The recommendations the James suggested we order was careful plan and all the dishes we perfectly seasoned and the flavours were simply beyond words. Watching the kitchen team at work was like watching an orchestra.

We had the following dishes
- impossible kebab *****
- Lamp chops ****
-Jack Fruit curry*****. (First time trying this dish)
-spinach parcel *****
- tandoori chicken****
-crab cakes ***
- dessert sample *****

Fred was responsible for creating some nice and tasty non alcoholic cocktails and they were awesome. The wine list is just right and the price is also very reasonable.
We Can’t wait to be back soon and thank you all for the wonderful experience.

Wow!! Such amazing food and service,"Wow!! Such amazing food, ambience and service. Staff were super friendly and jovial. Food was Devine sending taste buds wild!!"
Excellent fusion at the heart of Chijmes.,"Excellent fusion at the heart of Chijmes. beautiful creations, nice atmosphere. Perfect service. Enjoy Chijmes at its best."
"Awesome food, great vibes, and excellent service!","It was just a simple dinner affair with my ex-colleagues but the restaurant really exceeded expectations. The flavours in the food was really on point, and great for sharing. The menu has loads of different items and if you’re someone who likes variety, you’ll be happy see the menu! The best part is the staff there are really friendly and approachable - we even had a laugh or two with them. Will definitely be back!"
epic vegetarian Asian fusion dinner with great service by James,"the selection of food for both vegetarians and non is fantastic, so much choice and innovation from Impossible kebabs to chickpea ""tofu"" curry your taste buds will be tingling

and I don't know why people are complaining about the service, James who served us is a rock star, was very helpful on the menu and very friendly, forever smiling and we built up a great rapport very easily and he couldn't have done more for us. outstanding service!

they also have an extensive wine, whiskey, cocktail and beer list to satisfy everyone

overall a wonderful occasion and we'll definitely be back, highly recommended"
The food is so good here I,"The food is so good here I actually came 3 nights in a row when I was staying in the nearby Carlton hotel. The ambience is chic, the staff attentive, the menu is varied and the food quality exquisite at a very reasonable price. If you are near Chimjes this is an absolute must"
Excellent food!,Excellent food! You should try this fusion dishes! It’s not so pricey but not so cheap.. Great for special occasions! Service was excellent too!
Terrible Service,"Excellent food but the culinary goodness is completely lost by the bad taste the terrible service leaves you with.. no one to look after you, we were a group of 6 and were placing our own orders (the portion sizes do not warrant sharing) and we were told sternly that we should place all our orders in one go else the the kitchen gets jammed up.. this is the first time i have heard of such a lame excuse from a restaurant, the chef is expected to make the food a the orders come in, its in-comprhensible what does 'kitchen getting jammed up' means , if the restaurant cant handle the crowd, perhaps they should think about taking less reservations or investing in an automated ordering system. , the individual who was supposed to take care of our table was too busy, when we ordered the main course together for all 6 of us (we were simply so terrifief after the comment) , there was no repeat of the order taken , so we didn't even know until our food arrived that what we had ordered was correctly noted. We ordered water and had to remind twice (across 30 minutes). It will do good to the owners if they either cycle out the current staff or atleast increase the numebr of people waiting at the tables."
Horrible!,"My wife & I visited this restaurant on 5 Jan. They served us Chicken Momos while we ordered veg Momos. Before we placed our first order, we informed the waitress that all food on this table has to be Veg. Only after we enquired about the momos that were served, they told that its chicken and was served due to some confusion between the waiter and cooking staff.

Would never visit again or recommend it to anyone else.

Shameless, incompetent and unprofessional!"
Why don't you invest in service?,"I will start with kudos to the chef... She is awesome, food tastes amazing... The combinations are creative. But if you charge guests for higher end restaurant, please invest into basic service and not have a few teenagers running around trying to figure out what to serve... Our example, the server puts our order in, wine is nowhere to come, 20min later (after reminder) the head chef brings wine, serves it (same wine cellar different wine, I let it go... I guess any white on the list for the serving stuff is the same)... So while we didn't enjoy the chosen wine, on the invoice there it was - 30% more than the wine we drank...we corrected them and... Ekhm... Not even sorry for our mistake?? Honestly, it's SAD you are destroying the good things chef does with bad, bad, bad service. Anyone else - hope it's better for you or maybe just don't care or order anything that is nor basic :)."
Interesting Indian Fusion Cuisine,"Very interesting fusion cuisine. There are some hits and some miss among the dishes.

I am not a fan of coriander and was not keen on this place because of the name but was persuaded by my colleagues to give it a try. Surprisingly, none of the food had the coriander taste that I dislike.

Overall, an interesting and enjoyable dining experience but a place I will yearn to visit again."
Service could be better!,The food was okay however the staff was not as friendly. I enjoyed the food however the services staff may require some training. They were not very polite.
A must to return,"Restaurant Week 2020 has taken our culinary experience to the next level and dining at the Coriander Leaf certainly exceeded our expectations. Its 4 course set dinner showcase tasting portions of its creative menu. We like the bite size crab cakes with tangy mango salad, the soft naan with tomato paste, fluffy coriander rice with steamed sea bass with flavorful dressing. The perfectly fried banana balls served with gula melaka ice cream tops the dessert I have had in last 4 dining sessions. Coriander Leaf’s service is first class, their well trained staff are friendly, accommodating and professional. At the table they welcome you with a paan platter (betel leaf & condiments) and serve complimentary iced water throughout. The ambience is lovely with a lovely window view of Chijmes from the window. Coriander Leaf certainly tops the restaurant week’s list of amazing dining experience. We felt so relaxed, took our time to enjoy our meal and we look forward to returning with our friends to try more of the other fabulous food on their menu. They have an open kitchen so you can see the magic happens."
"Great food, poor service","We arrived at the restaurant at 1:45 just before kitchen closing. We did order quickly as we didn't want to inconvenience the staff. After having our food we were pretty much rushed with the waiter asking if he could clear when there was still food left on our plates. There were people around us still having a slow lunch and chit chatting but they didn't seem to get the same treatment as us. The body language of the waiter also seemed to be snobbish. Though the food was great, we wouldn't be going back owing to how differently we were treated."
Pleasantly surprised,"Went there with another couple and tried many dishes to share. Really nice, it's good food and good atmosphere. Will be back for more. The guy talking to customers is also good. Overall, good score. Will be back soon."
Must Try Restaurant at Chijmes,"My wife and I had dinner there a couple of nights ago. The menu is unusual, something like small bites or tapas however all the items are Asian. One selects food options from various columns on the menu. All items are meant for sharing. The foods we picked were mouth wateringly excellent, full of flavors and spices (not to spicy, just right). We did wines by the glass. It was nice to see quality wines available by the glass at reasonable prices. Services throughout dinner was perfect; great recommendations on the food options and wine pairings. This is on our ""must return to"" list of restaurants when we visit Singapore."
A memorable meal at a memorable location,A good choice restaurant with good food at a historic building in the city centre. Rest assured the waiting service is excellent too. Already there are too many good reviews hence will not repeat again. Do give this restaurant a try if have not done yet.
Finally Tried and Very Satisfied.,"Been wanting to have a meal here.
Glad we finally made it.

Ordered 3 starters.
Really liked the kale and goma.

Mango salad was good and spicy.

Wing bean salad wasn’t my favorite but my husband thought it was ok.

Steamed sea bass very very good.

Curry tofu was unique and surprisingly good.

We ordered both the chicken and vegetarian momo Dumplings. Pricey for 5 pcs but it’s good.

Servers were all helpful and friendly. Thank you!"
5 star food!,"Second time here. However, this time round there were a few customers making a little scene towards the friendly staff and hurling vulgarities.

All in all, Love the food and ambience here. Tried the lamb chop, red curry duck, grilled broccoli (recommended), steamed seabass & olive rice. Super delicious and suitable for asian taste!

Great for gatherings and food sharing. Did I mention about the awesome dessert? Yes! The white rabbit ice cream is to die for!"
Valentines Recommendation!,"Great food and great service! The Valentines Set they had prepared was delicious. But the highlightable note goes to James, who was responsible for entertaining and serving my wife and I. Not only did he occasionally check on us on whether our dinner was going well, his charming persona and light-hearted humor made our experience even more magical.
""If you enjoyed yourselves, don't go onto Tripadvisor, and don't talk about it. And don't mention me ;) ""
Touche James Touche!"
Amazing!,"The food, the venue, the staff, the wine list.,. all simply superb. Had hoped to do a cooking class here, but regrettably it was not available (too few - maybe due to COVID-19). Highly recommended .."
Another super meal,"As always, great food, excellent service, buzzy ambiance and great value. The staff always make an extra effort. Even when really busy, they are unflappable. Rock on!"
"Interesting Menu, Great Ambience","Enjoyed our family dinner thoroughly. I would say it’s a fusion restaurant leaning on the Indian palate. Tried the stir friend eggplant (DELISH), momo dumplings (lovely), the watermelon feta salad (excellent touch with the saffron water on melon), and a bunch of desserts (liked the crem brûlée), the lava cake came highly recommend but I didn’t find it to be anything special.

Overall, great ambience for a special occasion dinner. Wine selection is good. Open kitchen is a fun thing to watch."
Great food and service.,Great food that was full of flavours and matched nicely with wines. Awesome service too thanks Dylan.
Good service and awesome food,"Had a good chat with the manager, James. Food was awesome and a nice ambience for a date. The manager went the extra mile to help me print out my voucher, which I should have done myself."
Last Minute Delight,"I booked here a the last minute online with no issues. Upon arrival we were seated but decided to sit at the pass which ended up being an amazing decision. We watched with delight the chefs work their magic. The food was all prepared fresh and everything we had was amazing.
We definitely recommend this restaurant and will be back next time were in Singapore."
This place was amazing!!,This place was amazing!! Exiting and really tasty food! À must order is the dumplings. The staff was really friendly and professional. A resturant that I will remember
A Place For A Fun Team Building Experienced,The location is just nice and the ambiance was great. The menu for our team building cookery was excellent. All their service staffs and chefs are awesome and friendly. They even prepared for us some awards at the end of the day! Totally recommended!
Great Dining Experience,"Went over for dinner to celebrate girlfriend's birthday. Food was amazing, service is great and they were attentive. Highly recommended place with great ambience too. Highlight of the dish was the soft shell crab with salted egg yolk! Love 'em! Received complimentary dessert (Pavlova) as the lady in doc martin boots (sorry didn't manage to get her name) told us there is always space for desserts. Hey, she's right after all!"
"Food excellent, servers attentive","This restaurant serves Asian cuisine. The food was lovely and the servers were so attentive and interested in what we thought of the food. It is on level 2 of Chijmes, which was exceedingly convenient to our hotel (Raffles)."
Dinner,"Ambience - cafe
Food - cafe
Service - cafe
Good for a visit. Lost my reservation. Sad.
Food:
Dahi Chaat Puri - acceptable
Rice noodle salad - the duck wasn't discernible, the tamarind dressing over powered the dish. The toasted rice was like granite chips.
Nepalese minced chicken dumpling- chicken over minced, no texture. The dumpling skin was too, too thick. Sauce was alright.
Soft shell crab - crab lost in dough, part of dough still uncooked. Crab was good without the flour.
Grill bulgogi Angus beef shoulder - beef overcooked. Too sugared, hence taste of beef was lost.
Grilled baby lamb - overcooked. Many spices but all over taken by the chilli paste. The butter naan was charred, and the kitchen managed to leave parts uncooked.
Spiced lava cake - good

In general, the kitchen and chef needed more training."
Nice food but too smoky,"Lovely food with nice mix of tastes: lamb chops, cod, Burmese tofu curry, naan all yummy. But ambience was spoiled by smoky atmosphere from cooking-I smelt like I came from a barbecue after dinner-my clothes and hair all smoky! The open kitchen concept works only if there is good ventilation. So expect to come out all smelly after paying a lot for dinner!"
Didnt bother to call back,Tried calling and wrote an email for reservation. No reply on email. The person on the phone said someone will get back to me and no one did. Probably they do not need the business as they think that they are already doing so well. What a shame.
Two Questions,"Just two questions (and this is after me bringing a total of 20 customers to this restaurant over three weeks): 1) why do we get scoffed at by waiters for asking for and ordering from the set menu? 2) why do we get obnoxious eye-rolls for choosing tap water instead of still/sparkling and then get told that “NEWater is actually recycled water”. Thanks for the information, buddy, that doesn’t change my choice and nor does that mean that you are doing me a favor by taking my order. And to have multiple overseas guests comment on how, while the food was spectacular, the god-awful service is what they remember from their lunch hosted by SMU at Coriander Leaf, is lamentable. And deeply embarrassing for all of us. You, for having atrocious waiting staff, and me for constantly being convinced about how good your food is and thus subjecting all my guests to deplorable service at your restaurant"
Hits & Misses.,"Inconsistent service. Food was ok and potentially interesting (didn't manage to try some as intended) but will reconsider another visit, as service is sporadic, with the best service staff focused on the more tourist crowd."
THANK YOU!!,"Had a Baby Shower dinner gathering for 12 people. Recommended by Mr Faraq. We had watermelon salad which was tasty, momo dumpling, Falafel, salt and pepper squid was a good choice to start with, tandoori chicken, seabass fillet was fantastic, fried eggpant was delicious, tofu, love the naan and the coriander rice was just right. The one that I LOVE the most is the Baby Lamb Chops. It was Amazing. From the taste to its texture. Definitely will come again for that and would like to try the Duck. Service was OK. If I am not mistaken there's not many staffs around. The area that we got with a picture of a Tiger on the wall was quite dark for a photo taking. I guess we can understand that we are in a group therefore we did not get the one with a nice interior. Overall my friends love the food and the service especially to Mr Faraq and his colleague who was kind to get us a proper place for photo taking after our dinner."
Superb,"There is a separate vegetarian menu with over 20 dishes on it, spanning multiple cuisines. I eventually narrowed it down to three: the broccoli, momos and jackfruit curry. All were so delicious, I wish I could go back and try the rest of the menu and see what I missed out on.

Service was excellent. Food was prepared quickly, and was hot and fresh.

I will be back."
Not recommended,"Very poor service and substandard food. You can find better, tastier food at hawker centers and a much better service where the stall people serve you with smile.
The moment you enter Coriander leaf, you're made to be felt like you're next bunch of loads on the staff members coz they got more work to do.
We made a reservation 3 days in advance but still were made to wait for good 10 min. We're told table is getting ready and I was watching the dining area sitting at the bar, nothing changed. Nothing! Unnecessary wait, then taken to table and then? Forgotten. Kept waiting to orde. Finally managed to after calling in the waiters 3-4 times. Food was served quickly but they forgot our drinks. After we reminded, it was served when we're almost done with our food.
Food was below average and my main course was just full of pepper! Couldn't taste anything else. For a moment, I got confused if their name is Coriander leaf of Black pepper! Drink on the other hand, was just flavoured water and soda. I had ordered Ginger rogers. Avoid that
By then, my opinion was of a 2.5-3 star rating but then, something horrible happened to the next table and they found a LONG HAIR in their very first item served! I just hope & pray our food was clean atleast.
My rating is 1 star but my husband liked his food (mine was vegetarian and he ordered non vegetarian) so adding in 1 more star here
Avoid this place if you want to have a good experience and enjoy good food with some warm welcome and get nicely served"
Another Win for Coriander Leaf,"Once again, Coriander Leaf delivers amazing dishes and outstanding personal service and attention. We tried a couple of their seasonal items (paneer and puri puri (sp), and flavors were so fresh and layered. Love this place."
Amazing Service best food we have tried,"This place has the best service we have encountered in Singapore, on the main street you can eat and enjoy china town at its best. The host is a great guy and we enjoyed every moment we were here"
Will definitely visit again!,"Went for a family dinner on my sister-in-law’s birthday. It was a nice ambience - lively but not too noisy. We sat in a more private area behind the main restaurant. Despite that, the service was impeccable. It was perfectly timed for us to enjoy the food. The server recommended dishes as per our taste and gave us a Thai dish to try. Helped us serve the b’day cake at the end of dinner and clicked pix for us.
Overall, a great place, delicious food and amazing service."
A delicious lunch,"We wanted to have lunch at Chijmes, there are so many restaurants to choose format we liked the sound of the Coriander leaf menu. We took a punt and went up the stairs, not sure what we would find. Well it was a lovely looking restaurant, which happily had food, wine and service to match. We shared several small plates, which were all delicious."
Exquisite,We had the pleasure of dining at Coriander Leaf as a business group. The food dishes and the service were excellent. the flavors in the food dishes were amazing. The staff dealt with a large group very well and participated in conversation professionally. Very memorable
Great food and friend staff,"We came to this restaurant which was recommended by a friend of ours. We were skeptics at first as we have read mixed reviews on the place.

We were greeted by a smiley female staff, Monica, who assisted us in detailing explaining the menu. Every dish which she had recommended was a hit and we kept wanting more however we were too full and would have needed to roll out of the restaurant.

They did get busy during the night however staff constantly did check on us to ensure that we were comfortable.

We look forward to visiting this restaurant again soon."
Great food & good service,Could not fault the staff! They were very attentive & the food was fabulous!! We like spicy hot food & were not disappointed! We had several dishes to sample. That's the best way.
Spectacular flavours,"My husband & I visited for dinner early in our week long stay in Singapore. The Asian tapas-style menu was comprehensive and all the 5 dishes we tried were interesting, delicious flavour combinations. We were so impressed by the experience that we visited again this evening and were not disappointed. The food was excellent both in flavour & size. Service was attentive with a dash not humour.
The Tokyo mule is a good after dinner cocktail."
"Interesting food, underwhelming experience","The Asian fusion approach of the kitchen at Coriander Leaf is adventurous and interesting, though hit-or-miss. Our Burmese tofu curry was excellent, but the ""specialty"" frontier chicken was pedestrian. The spicy eggplant was good, but the jackfruit curry was one-note and the tamarind was overwhelmed by the black pepper. The service was also a little off: our server kept squatting next to our table, which was disorienting, and he weirdly kept questioning us about whether we found the food too spicy. Also, the lighting was *way too bright*. All-in-all, not the fantastic experience I was hoping for."
Ms Borooah,Have made multiple visits earlier and have had great meals but rather disappointed this time. We had a lunch reservation but when we got to the restaurant the hostess was indifferent and distant. We were kept waiting for about 10 minutes and when we were shown to our table without an apology ir explanation. It was also difficult to catch the attention of the staff during the meal. There was however a marked improvement with the arrival of the Captain (European gentleman) and the rest of the meal went well.
Fantastic fresh tapas style good,I had a fantastic dinner here last night. Wait staff were attentive & pleasant. I booked on the same day and went at 6.30pm. I had the water melon salad and lamb chops with coconut icecream for dessert. Every dish is as delicious. I look forward to coming back on my next trip!
Amazing!,We ate here on our last night in Singapore and it was amazing! It was some of the best food we tasted and we ate well during this trip. In particular the lamb chops and the beef brisket were excellent. The staff were attentive and friendly and in particular James made our evening special by making us feel really welcome. I would definitely eat here again if I return to Singapore.
"Excellent food, better service","The food was exquisite. We ordered the softshell crab, the potato cakes, spinach parcels and the momo dumplings. Each dish was superb. James was the most welcoming host and provided a great experience. 5 stars is not high enough."
Special honeymoon meal,"Beautiful food, exceptional service - really went above and beyond. Made the last part of our honeymoon very special with a truly memorable meal. Thank you!"
Wow - Singapore,"I booked a table at this restaurant as the New Zealand Herald had written a great food review. Felt a bit silly booking it 6 months ago approx knowing we’d be in Singapore at a set date and time. So glad I did, uhthe food is amazing, especially if, like me you love chilli, fabulous! Staff great, especially James, who made our night!"
"Great food, nice concept","We loved the food here and the location. Set in the old convent makes for an imaginative concept with lots of eating options. The the Coriander Leaf itself is nicely designed with a good view of the kitchen. The staff are very friendly, the service is quick and the menu very interesting. We liked the small plates; not cheap but well prepared and presented and the food was very tasty."
Decent Asian delicacy,Great presentation and satisfactory tasting of all dishes that we ordered. Host was very patient in explaining the menu and made good recommendation of choices catered to our family. Location is also prime and easy access. Recommended!
Excellent experience,"Very enjoyable meals, incredible service, good range of gluten free, definitely recommend for coeliac"
Amazing Concept and service,"I have been in the Chimes many times. Never saw this restaurant. We followed the TripAdvisor with my family. Couldn’t get on yesterday as it was so crowded. Came back today with reservations.

Beautiful environment with open seating and comfortable chairs. Unfortunately no outside seating.

The staff was extraordinary service oriented. Super recommendations. When the food was too spicy they brought milk free of charge. The waiter explained every dish with its origin, content, and preparation.

The concept of shared local cuisine is very nice. We ordered noodle pasta, kebab, lamb, briskets, naan, and red curry. All very delicious. The pasta was on the spicy side. The briskets we inhaled.

We would come back as a family."
Excellent food experience,"Fantastic service, incredible food and plenty of gluten free choices. I really enjoyed the palate cleanser of the edible leaf filled with herbs, spices, nuts and etc, it was a taste explosion and loved the duck salad and other meals, even the brocolli was delicious. Best food in Singapore, worth the money."
Excellent food - great variety,Had a great dinner with great flavours that were excellent. Food is excellent - recommend this place for sure.
Excellent tapas style Asian fusion restaurant,"We ate here as a group. It is upstairs in Chijmes which is a lovely courtyard with several eateries. Coriander Leaf had an interesting menu in tapas style. We chose 2 dishes each and they were all lovely.
Nice decor. The cost was about 100 Singapore dollars each with wine."
Delicious sharing plates,We came here on the great recommendations made on TripAdvisor and were not disappointed. We were given some help in choosing our different plates and they were all delicious. Chijmes is also a beautiful setting to walk through with other options of places to go for a drink before or after dinner.
Small plates with big flavors!,"Lovely fusion food, creative, interesting, flavorful. Presented in a ""tapas"" or sharing style, but quantity is on the smaller side so I would recommend ordering 1 more item than people at your table."
You’ll enjoy this one.,"This is one of those terrific restaurants where really good food is only the start of a memorable dining experience. Our lunch started with a very warm welcome, followed by tasty food from a varied menu, and throughout we enjoyed friendly, attentive and engaging service. You seriously couldn’t ask for a better dining experience. They’ve even changed my opinion of ‘purple’ foodstuffs! Go there. You won’t be disappointed."
Awesome Atmosphere & Food,We visited the restaurant on a Saturday evening and were abit pressed for time. We were warmly welcomed by James who got us settled and gave us some time to browse the menu. He even sat down and we had a conversation with us about his family. It was a very wonderful way to get the evening started as he made us feel right at home. The meal was served promptly and we could feel the flavor and freshness of the ingredients in each bite.
Lovely food but staff made us feel uncomfortable,"My daughter and I visited the restaurant on 7/6/19. We were 'welcomed' by a member of staff who opened the restaurant door by about 2 inches and whose first words to us were not 'welcome' or 'good evening' but 'have you got a booking'? This was not the warm welcome we had expected but we persevered.

For some reason, both my daughter and I got the impression that we were not wanted in this establishment. The waiter's attitude towards us made us feel most uncomfortable. There was no smile or general warmth towards us. It was quite bizarre and certainly put a damper on a night out with my daughter.

The food was delicious. I have no complaints at all about that.

However as we were still eating a waitress tried to remove the plates from the table. My daughter finished eating before I did and even though I still had food on my plate, the waitress removed all the other plates from the table, completly spoiling the ambience. When the guests on the table next to us had finished eating, their plates were not removed for some time and they were allowed to linger. I'm wondering why we were treated so differently.

I won't be visiting this restaurant again. I don't want to feel unwelcome and be treated as an inconvenience. Such a shame."
Service inadequate food is ok,"My wife came last night and they said they didn’t have a reservation but when we tried booking it online yesterday one was available; regardless we made a reservation for today. The main server was inattentive and rushed us with our order, our food was okay at best. The lamb chops were good and the naan was good but the soft shell crab was smothered with this overly rich salty holodinase sauce and the eggplant dish was undercooked. I would suggest to go to Anglo Indian where the service is unbelievable and so is the food"
Good is good but a little overpriced. Service -leave a lot to be desired,"Was recommended by a friend for the food. Made reservation for 3 paxs today for lunch. Couldn’t find the place and walked for awhile in Chijmes. When I called the restaurant to ask for help as I couldn’t find the place, person who picked up call merely told me they will hold the table. When I said I am lost in Chijmes and asked for exact location eg which cafe/restaurant/shop I should look out for in order to look for the stairs to go up, person over the phone was totally unhelpful. I told him I walked up to level 2 and ended up at a Watabe wedding hall and he insisted that there is no such place when I was right in front of the hall. Lei Garden hostess was most helpful to direct us the way instead. When we reached the restaurant, the host was not welcoming and did not even greet or smile. Almost felt like I was in a black and white silent movie. There was no introduction or recommendation when we looked at the menu for awhile. When asked how much time we have for lunch, we were wondering why as he didn’t explain the reason for asking and we were the 3rd occupied table at that time (means not busy). Really it’s a shame that the food is good but service was very poor. Even when we walked out after our lunch there was no thank you and farewell. What a shame and will not introduce anyone here."
Second Visit,"Absolutely stunning. Service amazing. Every member of staff is at the top. Our favourite. Can not recommend for modern, incredible food from across parts of Asia. Loved the champagne Blanc de Blancs- very reasonable. Served flawlessly. Best place in Singapore. Will be back soon."
1 week anniversary dinner,"My husband booked here to celebrate our first week of marriage. We were greeted by James who took us to our table, best table in the place in my opinion beside the window in the corner. It's like a tapas style eatery all small plates but good sized portions. The service was good, James was very funny, informative and helpful. The food was delicious and beautifully presented. We ordered a bottle of wine which was extremely expensive but was a lovely bottle and we felt it was a good option to celebrate. Its quite an expensive restaurant but we believe its worth the cost. Would recommend it for special occasion."
An amazing meal!,Bringing together the diverse flavours of Asia into a surprising yet delicious and coherent meal require extraordinary culinary skill!
Great,"Really enjoyed the service and every dish we ordered, especially the lamb chops - absolutely superb. Give it a try"
"James is one of a kind, Food was fantastic","Good job to coriander leaf for impressing us with amazing food, aesthetic plating, and especially the really refreshing and unique appetiser. Our favourite was the beef brisket kimchi buns! But the star of tonight was truly the service provided by our waiter James. His humour was funny, on point and made our evening extra memorable! Kudos for going the extra mile in service!"
