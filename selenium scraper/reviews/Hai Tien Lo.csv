Birthday Celebration,We enjoyed a wonderful lunch at Hai Tian Lo with great service and good food. Thanks to the friendly John/ Michelle / Genevieve for their excellent service.
Exceptional,"Had dinner with family of 10 at Hai Tien Lo. Food was great! Attentive service. Kudos to John and Wei Jian. Despite that there was a wedding, Wei Jian was attentive and responsive, in particular to the needs of my elderly in laws."
Wedding Lunch 26/12/22,"I created an account just to leave an excellent review for my experiences to commend on the impeccable services and food.

I had wedding dinner ceremony at Hai Tien Lo on 26/12/22.

Carmen and Frankie has been the point-of-contact months prior to the wedding and they have a superb respond rate. They are also very helpful to accommodate to our special requests. Kelly and Apple were assisting us in the tea ceremony and their arrangement was immaculate. I sincerely thank the team for the great work.

The food is extremely tasty. All my guests left the place feeling satisfied and full of praises. Not just the normal menu, the rest of other menus like no pork, no seafood and vegetarian menus are all tasty as well!

If you are reading this to check for wedding venue, I would strongly recommend this place. My spouse and I knew that this is the place to go from the start and were right.

Once again, thank you Hai Tien Lo's team for the perfect wedding."
Favourite Chinese Restaurant in Town!,Coming back to our favourite Chinese restaurant in town for family dinner. Food was good and delicious as usual. Love the Beijing duck very much! Personalise and warm service given by Apple and Kelly.
GOOD CANTONESE FOOD,"My wife and l were invited to a family dinner at Hai Tien Lo in level 3 , Pan Pacific Hotel,
The last time l patronise HTL was a long time ago when they were located on one of the top floors in same hotel. It was a set dinner in a private room. The menu included an appetiser cold platter,live fish,budda jump over the wall. The prawn dish had 2 types of prawns. All the food were very good. Service,as expected was also very good.
Parking was not easy,had to park ""illegally"" in one open lot without obstruction."
Excellent,"Fourth visit, the grouper fillet in fish bone broth served in treasure pot was good, fish very fresh and soup was tasty, probably my best ever bowl of fish soup.
The stewed lobster with lnaniwa udon in superior stock was almost very good, fresh lobster meat and delicious udon. This same dish was ordered on my first visit and it is one of the two dishes that can repeat order out of the seven different dishes that I ordered during the first three visits.

Nice ambience and good customer service.
Left the place with a full tummy and that kind of shiok shiok feeling, quite a while didn't get this kind of feeling."
Very enjoyable dim sum buffet,We enjoyed almost all the dim sum items especially the truffle char siew buns. The steamed chicken and mushrooms was the only item that was lacklustre.
Getting smaller,"The dishes are shrinking in size. The barbecue trio combination used to be $32 is now $38, and the jellyfish was also not included anymore. Except for price increase and smaller servings, quality is still very good and service staff tries their best to attend to your needs."
Wedding dinner,"Hosted wedding dinner at this restaurant, the private room has 8 tables that can fit 80 adults comfortably. Frankie was our point of contact, he was responsive to answer all our questions during the planning period so we did not have much trouble with the planning right up to the actual date. Guest feedback of the food was good, oriental deco of the restaurant makes the ambience very classy. Well done to Frankie and Apple!"
Fantastic Food & Service,"Good environment and food here, is very good place for gathering. Strongly recommend to try the Truffles Siew Mai and Seafood Dumpling Soup. Definitely will come back again. And staff Mr.Samuel Lee service is very good & friendly."
Patrick Tan Hai Tien Lo dinner,We had a wondeful dinner at hai tien lo. thanks to your experienced waitor Mr Patrick Tan who knows how to recommend very delicious and unique dishes for our dinner. Patrick even shared your new chef new dishes which we enjoyed very much.
"Disappointing, not as expected","We book through Chope and the site stated a 15% when book through them but it didn’t happen. It was meant to be a dim sum buffet but so many restriction and limitations with the menu. Food was only average, selection very little compared to the so many others we went. Over priced. Overall we didn’t enjoy and will not go back again nor recommend others."
Wonderful ambience/Tasty Cuisine With Superb Service,"Wonderful Birthday celebration with mouth-watering dishes and very personalised service.
The standout dishes were Nutritious Sliced Grouper in Fish Bone Broth served with Treasure Pot $48/- Hai Tien Lo Special Peking Duck $68/- for half and Stewed Angled Luffa with Crab Meat and Vermicelli $ 28/- .
Thanks to Ms Paulyn who gave very good recommendations we had a very satisfying dinner. Special commendation to Ms Paulyn as the restaurant was super busy yet she gave her level best service!!!"
Very good return visit!,"We had not been to Hai Tien Lo for a few years and we decided to return to celebrate my Mum's Birthday!

The food was very very good and kudos to the chef! The mini Buddha Jump over the Wall soup was very tasty, the Char Siew and roasted duck was exquisite, sliced grouper with onions was heavenly and the list goes on and on! The menu was extensive with both Dim Sum items and Signature dishes. However, for such an exquisite restaurant menu, the dessert menu was a BIG disappointment.

I was also bitterly disappointed when we had to wait for 1 hour+ for some dishes to be served as we were told that there was a wedding happening in the same restaurant and the wedding took priority!

I would have given a higher rating had it not been for the dessert menu, the wait for certain dishes and the shockingly poor attitude of the staff in-charge of my table!

I think the food is very good and I think it maybe worth another return visit some time in the future."
Great food and service!,Food was great. Particularly enjoyed the seafood as it was very fresh! Excellent service by Paulyn. Will definitely patronize again!
"Superb service, delicious food","Service was superb, allowing and helping us to refrigerate our own cakes and packing what we couldn't finish after! Shoutout to Paulynn and Tian Tian who took care of our table, and Jocelyn for our reservation!

Food was delicious and portion sizes were just right for us. Lovely vibes with our table facing the hotel's centre court so you get quite a nice view from the top down."
"Good food, excellent service","Celebrated my friend’s birthday at Hai Tien Lo and their food never fail to impress.

We ordered the $118 set menu and all the dishes were delicious.

Service was good too. One of the server Wei Jian is very attentive and helpful.

We will definitely be back because they have the weekday dim sum lunch buffet that seems good and reasonably priced too."
"Friendly staff, good food","My parents wanted to come here and relive the good old days, but didn't know the restaurant had shifted down from the top level to the 3rd floor. Ambience has obviously become average. We were seated near a family with a baby who kept crying, so that was quite annoying. The view was also not impressive as we faced the hotel atrium which looked so barren when looking upwards. The lounge music and all kinds of noise echo easily through the building because of its circular design.

That said, the food was great and it's obvious that Hai Tien Lo does not scrimp on its ingredients. Service staff were also friendly and provided a complimentary slice of cake when we told them that we were celebrating a birthday. However, the dishes we ordered through the set menu were served pretty slowly."
Lunch,The roast duck is one of the best in Singapore. Meat is succulent and juicy.Even the bones are tasty. Menu is more skewed to individual portions than sharing portions. Service is attentive especially from Pauline who pre-empts your needs. A wonderful experience
"Good Food, Great Service","Overall, food quality was good and the food were above average. The ambience is perfect! The service was so friendly. Thank you Huiqi and others crew for serving us."
Dinning At Hai Tien Lo,"Among all premium hotel in Singapore, Hai Tien Lo serve the best food Chinese food among them, All the famous traditional dishes of Chinese dining can be found here and the cooking is excellent and consistent thought out at all times. Never disappoints, service is of excellent standard.
Good place for family and business gathering as it offer one of the cosiest environment for family and business partner discussion. Great service by the crew team, Wei Jian, Patrick, Paulyn, Apple, Kelly, Lee Mei, Hui Qi, John Frankie, Jia Jia, Michelle and Mabel made us feel so welcome."
Incredible Dining Experience,"My business associates and I had a great dinner at your Chinese Restaurant -Hai Tian Lo this month.

Food was delicate and service was impeachable.
In particular, we come across Apple, John, Frankie and Kelly. To us, they have flied Pan Pacific flag high through personalised service and great personalities. Honestly, they are the dream team there.

We truly appreciate the whole dining experience and will certainly revisit soon.

Kudos to the team and keep it up!"
A very sumptuous dinner ❤️,Food and presentation was awesome and service was great! I loved every dish and would definitely come back! My personal favorite is the soup and fish! Nicky went out of the way to make up for our celebration. She is really an asset to the hotel.
Great Chinese restaurant in town,I would say this is 1 of the best Chinese restaurant in Singapore. It is suitable for all occasions and age but it is quite pricey. Menu is wide and good quality and service.
"Unbeatable service, great food, wonderful experience","Ambience is perfect. Specifically, John & Apple are super accommodating, friendly, knowledgeable, tip top service, me & my family enjoyed both of them professionalism too.
Beside that Lee mee, Patrick & Huiqi was very helpful, friendly with excellent recommendations. I can't think how our dinner could have been improved.
Food quality was very good especially the soup & black pepper beef, well done to the culinary team, keep it up.
All in all, once again a great experience and of course, we're planning to book our dim sum lunch."
Average,"Third visit, the lemon deep fried crispy prawns a bit rubbery. Mini Buddha jumps over the wall was okay, above average. The last time I had this was more than ten years ago, truly a suaku!
Three visits ordered seven different dishes only one or two good enough to repeat order next time.

Nice ambience and good service but unfortunately quality of food not good enough for me to visit regularly. Visited three consecutive weeks due to 20% off for all dishes."
Nice Pleasent Dining Experience,"Nice Pleasent Dining Experience, GHA member accorded discounted rate for dining, private dining area for GHA members."
Average to Good,"First visit, the signature trio of treasures and wrapped stewed fish noodles were just average, although they are their signature dishes, but the stewed lobster with inaniwa udon was good.

Second visit, the wok-fried lobster with scrambled egg whites and wok-fried rice with crab were okay.

Nice ambience and excellent customer service, if quality of food can be as good then it would be a 5 star dining experience."
Excellent Service and good food,"Food was good but service was excellent considering!the Restaurant is so busy.
Special thanks to staffs Kelly and Apple for making sure our food was served and that our teas and water are top up. Will come back again.
Highly recommend if you have not tried to visit this Restaurant."
Top Notch Cantonese Restaurant,"Very elegant settings makes for an elevated dining experience. Dishes were well executed and scored highly on color, aroma and taste. The stir fired dishes encapsulates excellent Wok Hei, a testament to the skill of the chef. Round it off with friendly service from Patrick, Francis and Samuel, its a dining experience to remember."
Excellent as Usual,"Food was delicious as usual. Kudos to the team who always serve and take care us well. Special thanks to Lee Mee, Wei Jian, Kelly and Mabel."
Wedding Dinner,"William, ex business development manager, and John, restaurant manager, were very friendly and helpful to my endless demands. Even after William had left his job a few weeks before my wedding, he was still very concerned about my wedding dinner.

My wedding was successful due to the both of them.

The guests, especially the food critics, commented the food were excellent and nice.

Thank you"
"The service personnel were really service oriented. Above, Kelly and Frankie. Foods wise equivalently great.To reserve a table w","Great food Friendly serviced . The service personnel were really service oriented. Above, Kelly and Frankie. Foods wise equivalently great. To reserve a table wasn't easy. It's worth it"
Wedding Lunch Reception,"Had my wedding lunch reception at Hai Tien Lou. I was blown away by the services provided by the team consisting of John, Apple, Kelly, Paulyn, Wei Jian, Xiao Liu, Mabel, Lee Min and Tian Tian. Top notch service is even an understatement. They are so friendly to everyone and professional at the same time. The team made my guests and family felt so welcome and they have nothing but compliments for the team.
And of cos, the food was awesome. The menu was led by Chef Ben Zeng. Honestly, i was so worried about the food jus cos everyone has really high expectations. But my worries went down the drain the moment i took my first bite. And subsequently, all i heard from the guests were the food is so delicious, the food is great and yummy. And if you think you will not be full from the 8-course menu, you are wrong. Many of my guests commented that they didn't even eat dinner because they were so full from the lunch. Food was really really delicious. So if anyone is thinking about wedding reception in Hai Tien Lou, dont even think about if already, just book with them and you will not be disappointed.
Special mention to William, who assisted me from the beginning to the rest. William's professional services is really of another level. He is not only helpful and friendly,his advices to newlyweds to be is awesome. I had trouble deciding on a minor stuffs ( but for the bride everything is major) and once advice from William and everything is resolved. I honestly felt that it is the experiences he gained from being in this business.

Thank you to the service team, Chef Ben and William for making my wedding memorable and satisfied by each and every guest."
"Great food, great service","Went for the weekday dim sum lunch at Hai Tien Lo. Great ambience, great food and service. Perfect for a business lunch or just catching up with friends."
"Great service, great coordinator for our wedding luncheon","Had our solemnisation and wedding luncheon at Hai Tien Lo in Dec. Food is awesome and special shout out to William, our coordinator. He has been extremely helpful throughout leading up to our big day. He is quick to make certain arrangements and ensure everything is in place on our wedding day. My hubby and I were thankful for his help and he would often tell us not to be nervous, just be happy and enjoy the day. He is attentive and proactive in providing us with suggestions throughout the planning and on actual day.

As for the food, presentation is great, taste is awesome and even the vegetarian food was also highly recommended by my relatives. Thumbs up for the food!

Just a note that the hotel was used for SHN so probably not ideal if you need a room for your brothers, sisters or yourself. And may not be convenient for some as you would need to take the escalator (due to SHN) so lift is not available but if you have tons of stuff to carry, you can still request from the hotel to take the lift up and they will gladly assist. However, William has provided a function room for the makeup touch up and to rest so it's still perfect for wedding couple."
Great for smaller wedding receptions,"Held our wedding dinner at Hai Tien Lo in end-October. We had a great time!

Venue - We used the private room for our dinner. Under current regulations, it can fit up to 50pax comfortably. It is quite suitable for couples who do not plan to have a large reception. Ambience is very traditional Chinese. We were provided a reception table with a pretty flower arrangement, which was a nice touch.

Wedding manager - William is a very friendly and approachable person who we felt very comfortable with throughout the whole planning process. While there were many areas that we were initially unsure about, he helped to clarify all our doubts. He also takes the extra step to give his own personal suggestions to liven up our event, without coming off as pushy. On the actual day, he was always contactable to ensure that we had all we needed.

Service - Staff were always cheerful during their interactions with us. Thank you to Apple and her team - Kelly, Wei Jian, Patrick, Lee Mee, Mabel and Fang Mei for a great dinner service. Our special thanks to Kelly for her wealth of experience in guiding us through the tea ceremony, to make it a success.

Food - we went with one of the more expensive menu selections for the reception, but it was money well spent and our guests only had good things to say. Personally, our favorite was the Sea Perch fillet - they gave generous portions and it was smooth and sumptuous! Many thanks to chef Ben Zeng and his team for a job well done.

Do note that Pan Pacific is designated as an SHN hotel at the time of writing, and hence our wedding stay had to be postponed. However, we were allowed to use a separate unused room as a resting area, which was much appreciated."
Hai Tien Lo wedding lunch,"We had the ruby lunch and it was terrific! Especially the suckling pig. Was the star of the show! Down side is just that it’s too little. Also, the duck was quite dry and the dessert trio was quite of a let down. We felt that the dessert was taken from the edge buffet.

The service crew was very good even though they could be more attentive after the second March in, to prepare the champagne for the couple to drink. Still, a job very well done! Very efficient in clearing off the plates.

The AV Staff Alvin, was very nice to help us with the setting up and music to be played throughout the wedding.

Last but not least; the business development manager, William who has coordinated all this! He has made every request from the couple possible! Keep it up!

All in all, The wedding went smoothly! The decor was very oriental and pretty for photographs.
Will be back to order their suckling pig next time!

Chef Ben Zeng
The service team is led by Apple. Her team comprises of Kelly (tea lady), Wei Jian, Mabel, Lee Mee and Xiao Liu. AV was Alvin.

Note: this package comes with a 1 night bridal suite but due to pan pac being one of the SHN hotels, the bridal suite staycay got postponed to our anniversary date next year."
Wedding Reception and Tea Ceremony at Hai Tien Lo (Dinner),"My husband, Joshua and I held our tea ceremony cum dinner reception in mid-September and we were very satisfied with the service!

The service staff who was led by Apple with Kelly, Lee Mee, Wei Jian and Michelle were very prompt with serving the food and clearing away the dishes amidst the programme we had planned for the guests. And our guest and ourselves enjoyed the food prepared by Chef Ben and his team, the pipa duck was especially raved at by many of our guests. We also appreciate Alvin from AV who helped ensure the sound, music and video could all be played properly.

And we definitely couldn't have had such a smooth programme without the effort of William, the hotel coordinator. Really appreciated how he was so prompt in his replies and answered our queries to his best, especially with all the changing guidelines that were taking place. He was very patient with us for the 2 times we met him face to face and really helped us to arrange the venue and transition from tea ceremony to reception well, even with the change of wedding reception date.

It was the little gestures of service and details that really touched and impressed us during the whole programme, from bringing in a mirror to the makeup room they gave us to ushering the guest to the separate venue for tea ceremony to personalising our slice of wedding cake. Thank you William and team.

Highly recommend couples who want to enjoy an intimate dinner or lunch setting for their reception to give HaiTienLo a try.

Best Wishes,
Sophia and Joshua Fong"
"Excellent meal, blend with great service","I had the privilege of attending a wedding luncheon at Hai Tien Lo on 19thSeptember2021. Impressed by the food served. I really enjoyed the sumptuous lunch. Not to mention the excellent service extended by your service officer. Namely Ms Kelly, Apple, William and a few of the other crews. Very impressive and polite. Well done, keep up the super service. Really enjoy my time there

My Wedding Luncheon @ Hai Tien Lo,"I am very thankful and grateful for the support and service provided by the service team today consisting of Apple, Michelle, Lee Mee, Wei Jian, Kelly, Mabel, Paulyn, the culinary team of Ben Zeng and the leadership of William for their exceptional standard in terms of service, planning and delicious food. If not for this wonderful team today the wedding luncheon would not be as smooth, as great, as joyous and happy as it has been. Thank you all once again and I shall see you all for my family weekend lunches soon! Do keep up the good work and continue making the magic happen!"
Wedding solemnisation at Hai Tien Lou,"Me and my partner had our solemnisation night at Hai Tien Lou and was served by Pan Pacific Singapore's manager William. During the entire journey from the planning of event, liaison with vendors, securing of our solemniser in short notice, and following of COVID guidelines, William provided impeccable support and guidance throughout up till the actual day. He was also extremely responsive and did his best to accommodate to our many requests to make our special day as smooth and memorable as possible.

Special thanks to the HTL service team led by Apple and her team, Kelly, Paulyn, Yann Ling, Michelle, Lee Mee, Wei Jian, Mabel for the great dinner service, as well as Executive Chef Ben for serving the sumptuous Chinese cuisine that HTL is famed for.

We highly recommend couples to consider HTL as a venue for a small and intimate wedding dinner with family and loved ones. The decor in the function room is traditional yet classy, great for Chinese families."
Wedding Dinner,"First of all, I would like to thanks all the staff who serving us on my wedding dinner. You guys are really awesome! Other than that, I want to express my gratitude and thankfulness to my banquet manager William. I’ve been liaise with him ever since 2019 for my wedding dinner in 2020. He always reply my message promptly when I’m in doubt, and guide me the way to plan for my wedding. He always told me don worry abt anything, just be the beautiful bride on that day can do!

However due to the unexpected pandemic, my reception forces to postpone. I understand how difficult the situation is, especially for hotel industry due to the gov restrictions. There’s so many updates from time to time, and William will always be the one who contact me & find a best solution to fit into the situation. The things wasn’t go well, my reception postponed again on May due to heightened alert. I felt so sad & disappointed, William is the one who giving me assurance & encouragement when I almost want to give up and cancel the wedding.

His attitude & professionalism giving us the confidence to move forward. Finally we made it for our receptions on Aug 2021! Without him, I will not have the chance to capture all these beautiful memories in mind. Me & my husband very satisfied & enjoyed on our reception!

Thanks William, u make my wedding perfect! :)"
Wedding Dinner Ceremony 28/8/21,"I had wedding dinner ceremony at Hai Tien Lo on 28/8/21.
Before I start to write, I would sincerely thank the staffs who served us, Apple, Kelly, Michelle, Wei Jian, Paulyn, Lee Mee, Mabel, Patrick and Yann Ling.
Firstly, their services were better then 5 start hotel service. Its not like an ordinary service level that you go to Hai Di Lao or fine dinning. They are so friendly and kind, like an aunty or uncle from a family member cares for you. The moment we step in for makeup and preparation, they get all kinds of drinks for us. Which we were there on their break time. Because of us, they did not even rested. Check PA, arrange table bla bla bla.I tell you, once your guest comes in like a tsunami your mind will be blown away. You wont even have time to go toilet. But the staffs consistently asked my wife and myself ""are you hungry?"" and ""i can get a food for you, have a quick bite ok?"". Can you imagine or have you ever heard or seen the staffs care more then anyone else in the wedding ceremony? They are just wonderful people. Thank god I choose Hai Tien Lo for the wedding ceremony. Secondly, as you know, its Pan Pac Singapore. Which has multiple best restaurants in Singapore. And again, its Hai Tien Lo, best Chinese restaurant. So dont come and compare Hai Tien Lo's standard of food with other restaurant. Also I had 3 guests are vegetarians. Before i even ask them how was the food, they walk to me and said the vegetarians meals are so delicious and thank me instead. Hence delicious is their symbol. Lastly, with surprise, chefs will come out to floor and check how is the food and situation. I really didnt expected it. All the staff are so professional. Again, I sincerely thank all the staffs from Hai Tien Lo for my wedding dinner. And whoever reading this, you wont regret choosing Hai Tien Lo for their service and food."
Wedding lunch,"Had a memorable Wedding Luncheon Hai tien Lo on 31 July 2021 and we would like to drop a note to compliment Hai Tien Lo for the amazing service and delicious food making this day a memorable one!

The manager, William was really supportive to arrange and accommodate request even at the very last min. William is always there to share his advice and provide his assistance to us whenever we need help. William is also stationed at the venue throughout our wedding lunch to ensure that everything is going smoothly. A big thank you to William for making our special day so successful!

We would like to thank the executive chef Ben and his team for the 8 course lunch and we have to agree that all dishes are so tasty and fabulous in terms of quality and presentation! We received compliments from our relatives on the food as well.

We would also like extend our appreciation to Apple and her service team, Wei Jian, Paulyn, Kelly, Yann Ling, Patrick, Lee Mee and Mabel! The service provided was par excellence and their service is always accompanied with a big bright smile from the beginning to end of the lunch. During the lunch, the staff are quick to make necessary adjustments for tea ceremony and last minute special request from our guests. I will strongly recommend Pan Pacific - Hai Tien Lo as a venue for wedding and meals."
Wedding Lunch in July,"Firstly, I would like to comment on the superb service given by the management, especially to William who is in charge of the wedding banquet. Through this tough period with the regulations changing every few weeks, I’m sure it brings a lot of stress to couples who have booked their banquet with any F&B. My wedding lunch was just after the heightened phase when the government announced that after July 12th it will be kinda back to normal. Throughout End June, William assured me that my booking will be confirmed and was flexible on the initial deposit as I had doubts about it.

Secondly, D Day was smooth as William managed to secure a wonderful Chef Ben, and his on the ball team which made the whole process seamless. Everything was on time and the team was so prepared and friendly with smile on their faces.
I ordered the Ruby Lunch menu, I have to say, the Roasted Suckling Pig and the Roasted Pipa Duck’s taste it out of this world. I’m someone who frequents Cantonese restaurants and I can say that they brought their game to the next level.
Special thanks to Apple, Kelly, Yann Ling, Paulyn, Wei Jian, Lee Mei and Mabel for bringing this special experience to my family and my wife on this occasion.
I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is planning their wedding."
Wedding dinner at Hai tien Lo,"We had our wedding dinner banquet on 17 July 2021 at Hai Tien Lo @ Pan pacific. We must say it’s a fantastic night with all the help we received from the team at Hai Tien Lo.

Especially thankful for Manager William who is very responsive and flexible in terms of meeting to our needs. The coordination, even with the covid guidelines, was smooth with William’s help and guidance.

The service team headed by Apple and her team- Kelly, Wei Jian, Ruffian, Lee Mei, Mabel, Yann Ling, Patrick and Paulyn, we’re attentive to our needs. They were friendly and service is commendable.

The food served was one of the best we have tasted at wedding banquets. Kudos to Hai Tien Lo Executive Chef Ben and his team for preparing such exquisite dishes. In particular, my guests raved about the double boiled chicken soup with abalone and scallop. The double boiled osmanthus soup with maltose and black sesame glutinous rice dumplings, which was served during our dessert, was a pleasant surprise too!

We are definitely looking forward to our next dining experience at Hai Tien Lo!

Yina, SL"
Great dim sum great place,As usual never disappointed with their service and food quality. The price is a little high but worth paying for its service and food quality. They have changed and created more menu packages since covid so we can have more options too. Love the signature black charcoal truffle char siew bun and the Mao San Wang rice roll.
Excellent Service and Food,"Had a staycay in Pan Pacific, and our family decided to dine at Hai Tien Lo. We made the reservation last minute and the restaurant gladly made arrangements to accommodate us. Thank you for the flexibility!

We would like to express our immense gratitude to Apple from Hai Tien Lo. She was every attentive to our needs, and especially to my father who came to the dinner late. She offered to keep the soup (we ordered a set menu dinner) in the warmer first till he comes back. She then proceeded to get the chef to reheat the soup to ensure my dad still has his food served hot.

I mentioned we were celebrating my dad's birthday and the restaurant prepared a slice of cake. My mum checked if it was possible to get Longevity Buns, and Apple was very efficient in making the arrangements and patiently informed us we would have to wait a bit for the chef to steam the buns.

Such hospitality really wowed us, not to forget compliments to the chefs who made this meal so unforgettable.

Would definitely be back and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a delectable dining experience."
Poor service,"Poor service and bad attitude by Ms. Apple - have wrote in to feedback. Food was salty, inconsistent. Dont bother. Go to Peach Blossom (parkroyal) much better."
Wedding,"William is friendly whereby he guided us with detail information when we are sourcing for option to host wedding. He also advise us on what we should do, what we should not and how we should do it.

Apple, Yann Ling, Kelly, Wei Jian basically is efficient on making sure food is serve up on proper timing. They even advise us on how we should arrange the food when there is extra food as some quest did not turn up.

Chef Ben and his team, their food tasting is excellent. All my guest commented that they enjoy the food and it is so filling comparing to other wedding food elsewhere. It's full of praise for Chef Ben and his team. Most of the guest and myself love the ""double boil Chicken soup with whole abalone, dried scallop and Chinese mushroom"" & ""chilled mango pudding with fresh fruits"". If possible I would love to return to Hai Tien Lo as a guest to eat the food prepare by Chef Ben and his team.

Regards
Shawn"
Perfect end-to-end wedding service,"Decided on Hai Tien Lo restaurant after meeting William. Took care of us and our needs every step of the way. Dinner by Chef Ben and his team was excellent too and services were on point. A big thank you to William, Chef Ben, Apple, Kelly, Yann Ling, Wei Jian, Lee Mei and the AV team. You guys made the wedding perfect! THANKS AGAIN!"
Dim Sum,Siew Mai & Har Kar serving not warm. Xiao Long Bao & hong Yu Zhao Shou dumping skin sort of too thick.
From Excellent to Good,"1st Visit Dinner - 5 Star:

Very refined Cantonese cuisine. They excel in both traditional style cooking like sweet/sour pork and innovative dishes like roast duck with clavier. A delicious treat of premium ingredient executed with matured/crafty cooking talent.

Service and ambient were at very good standard.

Hotel standard pricing.

Update for 21Mar lunch visit - 4 Star:

The ala carte dim sum was very good but took a bit of time to serve. Service was noticeable slower than dinner. It could to due to buffet dim sum high frequency of ordering.

Cooked dishes was disappointingly quite average as compared to our dinner experience few weeks back."
Impeccable service and food,"Went there twice, one for dinner one for lunch. Both time was brought to the table by Ms Michelle Siao. Props to her for manning the reception during such a busy period, she maintain a professional and smiling attitude. When I wanted a last minute slot for lunch, she did her best to accommodate that and she didn’t disappoint. Other service staff like Ms Paulyn and another short hair lady(didn’t get her name) deserves recognition as well. All the servers who served us during 15-16 March were really so patient and accommodating. A plus service.

Food wise, deserving of its reputation nothing to bad to talk about.

Will come back again!"
Solemnisation dinner,"Making arrangements for your own solemnisation dinner can be extremely daunting. William was a friendly guy who made the experience smooth and easy. On the night itself, I was impressed by the commitment to deliver amazing and prompt service by Weijian and Kelly. William kept a watchful eye and ensured that everything went smoothly. My guests gave great feedback about the dishes prepared by Chef Ben and team. Highly recommended!!"
Excellent wedding venue,"With the help of william, apple, kelly and weijian, we were able to hold our wedding lunch at haitienlo. They were very responsive to all our requests and was always around to help us when we needed.

We had been requesting for a dim sum menu from many other high end hotels, but none were willing to work with us. Only william and executive chef ben was willing to work around our request and crafted us the perfect dim sum menu that we were dreaming for.

They were also able to accommodate our request of lowering the number of courses to 6 courses as we wanted to reduce any food waste that is highly prevalent in the fnb industry.

Needless to say, the food was fantastic and all my guests raved about the choice of food to us regarding the dim sum choices. It got compliments from all ages and even the toddlers who were normally very picky loved the food as well.

My wife and i would like to take the opportunity to thank the hai tien lo and pan pacific hotel team. They made everything very smooth and the whole wedding was very fuss free. We were able to thoroughly enjoy our wedding despite being sleep depraved and had so much fun with our friends and families.

Great job team and we look forward to going to hai tien lo for more exquisite cantonese food cooked by chef ben and his team!

Regards
Jacob and pamela"
Wedding Lunch,Thanks to William and his team for managing my wedding smoothly at Hai Tien Lo and accommodating to our request. Food served by Hai Tien Lo was marvelous and tasty. Probably one of my favourite and one of the best few restaurants in Singapore!
Great wedding experience,"Had my bro's wedding banquet here. Special thanks to the team - William, Weijian, Apple, Kelly, Kenneth for the excellent service, attentiveness and flexibility in accomodating to our requests promptly. It was great working with William who coordinated the banquet event well with everything going smoothly. Nice, cosy ambience in the private room. Food quality is great too! Highly recommended!!"
Dining at Hai Tien Lo,"Great choice for dining at the restaurant, excellent environment with friendly service. Big thanks to William Koh, the restaurant manager who took care of my multiple reservations and various diet restrictions for our guests.."
"A under-whelming dimsum experience, which is a true pity given the chef’s potential","I last reviewed a dinner here a few weeks ago and today I review their dimsum.

We ordered about eight items for two of us and it wasn’t filling enough for me. That’s because the dimsum menu didn’t have a carb dish. Pity. Is it that difficult to whip up something?

Clearly the dimsum tries very hard to be “exquisite”. Of note:
- Charcoal char Siew buns with truffle - bad match unfortunately.
- Prawn paste dumpling - the paste didn’t come out chewy enough; its probably best left for steamboat!
- Pan fried Rice rolls with dry scallop sauce - too much sauce on the side; the rice rolls are quite nice but I’d prefer those with fillings, and there was none in the menu, which is pretty disappointing.
- Deep fried mango roll with scallop - trying to be innovative, but prawn would have been a much better filling (sorry, sometimes you can’t deviate too much from the time-tasted way of doing things).

The others like dumpling soup and dragon Pearl etc were ok. Oh, they don’t even have tarts?!! Cutlery was really lovely, though.

This visit has reaffirmed my earlier comment about spacing and location: place appears cramped, and we were made to face the entrance/exit of the kitchen staff (bad orientation). Why on earth the hotel shifted this restaurant down from the top level (where the name of the restaurant is most suited) to level three still baffles me."
Never fail to impress,"Had our CNY lunch at the restaurant and as usual, they never fail to impress me be it with their food, service or ambience. William Koh, the Business Development manager, ensures that all our requests are catered for. All my guests had nothing but good comments on the whole dining experience and gave the thumbs up. Great food, great service and great ambience!"
"Very good, not so memorable though..?","This is a lovely place for dinner. I’ve always enjoyed coming here for dinner, particularly in the past when they were situated on the top floor.

I also observed several semi-private tables with tall transparent partitions, so it didn’t look “private” at all but at least people could converse a little louder inside. I was the first to arrive as the restaurant opened, and I asked for a private table but they told me it came with a minimal spending of $800. I wasn’t sure if I would chalk up that amount for our table of five so couldn’t get it. (In the end we spent $722 only.) When we were leaving, the restaurant was very full and only a couple sat at a private table inside - maybe they overflowed into it. I mean, how do two people spend $800 eh? Since the “rooms” were transparent and came without doors, I wondered why can’t they allow us to sit inside - first come first serve would be a good way to get into customers’ good books.

The food was excellent Cantonese cuisine. But then, it wasn’t particularly outstanding that other similar and nearby premium Cantonese places couldn’t achieve. Everything was great but I can’t think of something that tugs me to HAVE to go back to eat again.

We ordered the set menu for five, but strangely many dishes had to be physically portioned out by the staff. It would have been neater to just apportion in the kitchen. I found that puzzling.

I see they have an interesting ala carte buffet menu for lunch so perhaps I’ll consider coming for that."
Great Service and Food,"We recently placed a order for Hai Tien Lo's bento sets for an important event. We had a wonderful experience with the BD manager, William, when we held our wedding at HTL the last year. We approached him to assist us with this and he was once again extremely helpful and provided top-notch service.

Our dietary needs were accommodated, and William also went out of his way to personally deliver the bento sets as we were worried about delivery delays. We really really appreciated his help with our extremely last minute order (it was placed for next day delivery).

The food arrived in thermal bags, and was very well packaged. The food was warm and every item tasted delicious despite the long journey to our location. Would highly recommend the takeaway bentos!

Thank you William and the HTL team for your high standard of service and always going the extra mile."
Wedding During Covid Times,"Believe this pandemic wouldn't be going away any time soon and Phase 3 is only starting 28th December, that said, only 8 per table seating.

Thus, we would like to recommend Hai Tien Lo if you're thinking of hosting your guests for wedding!

My husband and I had a very bad experience with (**) and then we decided to call three venues and try our luck. To be honest, HTL is our last choice because they could only sit 88 guests.

The manager (William) received our email and contacted us IMMEDIATELY the next working day and we started to communicate over email. We went down to HTL, saw the place and paid our deposit - NO further qnx asked.

It's a perfect place for two zones of crowd - so you don't have to do it another day / time. At the time of our event, they allowed up to 100 guests.

There's no food tasting - if more than 6 pax, against the law. (but if you're thinking of hosting your event phase 3, can consider) so William and I planned a surprise for my then-fiancé to celebrate his 30th and we sampled the quality of food at HTL; not the exact wedding dishes, fyip.
It wasn't salty, food was fresh, served hot and AWESOME!!!

Actual Day:
We had an issue with our wine consignment - but William briefed his staff and handled the situation well. Everyone enjoyed the wine.
FOOD: EXCELLENT - all of our guests commented that the food was great, (except for the canopy chicken, which we were disappointed too)
But ALL else were great, food were well portioned, served hot.
The prawn dish - crunchy, fresh.

We also had our tea ceremony in the restaurant. Kelly (the waitress) was extremely helpful too.

Only thing: I think they forgot our cake-cutting which we were promised on our first visit to HTL but on a positive note, they gave two slices of cake to our birthday guests.

They also gave us the VIP flowers to bring back.

MARCH-IN was interesting to walk through the zones. :)

Staff were helpful in reminding guests not to inter-mingle: VERY IMPT not to get into trouble with the law.

SPECIAL THANKS TO: WILLIAM AND HIS TEAM:
APPLE, KELLY, YANN LING, PAULYNE, CARINA, WEI JIAN, LEE MEI AND MABEL

Great place to host a lunch,"Great place to host a lunch or dinner. The service is excellent, the food is great and you’ll be well-looked after by the staff. We hosted our post-ROM lunch here and was not disappointed.
Have also been here for dinner on a separate occasion and enjoyed the meal too."
"Unchanged set menus, unmemorable food.","I’ve been here a few times for business because of its central location, but the set menus have not changed a bit in the past two years, as far as I can remember. While the food is not sub-par, it’s a shame there isn’t any dish that is outstandingly superior nor memorable. The menu needs some help."
Dim sum lunch,"Our first visit here did not disappoint us:
- we called the night before and managed to get the last table for lunch
- warm welcome at the hotel entrance
- ambience/decor were very nice even though we were seated away from the atrium
- dining wares and teapot/cup were very nice
- excellent service throughout our meal from placing our order to food recommendation and the food serving
- we only ordered dim sum as we had a heavy breakfast from staycation at another hotel, but the food quality was very good, compared to other restaurants that we had visited. In fact, we were having dim sum 3 days in a row, and what a wonderful experience here.
- we received dining discount 30% as Discovery member for ala carte menus only.

Overall super great customer experience and a good place to host guests.

We will surely return again & make advance reservation."
Great service- Mother’s Birthday Celebration,"Brought my mother here to celebrate her 56th birthday. We received very good service from Apple, Kelly and Wei Jian, who went out of the way to make us feel very at home. They were very helpful, for instance they recommended and explained to us dishes that we should try, when my mother was struggling with the e-menu. The portion that they recommended was just nice for the 5 of us. Food was fantastic too, overall a very enjoyable birthday celebration."
Fantastic food and service,"I have visited this restaurant many times and I am always impressed by the food and service. Today, I really appreciate the attentive and sincere service provided by the team especially by Yiihang & Michelle"
Hai Tien lo,"My first time there. The majestic red pillar greet me. Opt for the dim sum buffet. Every item is quite tasty. However , I am not sure the ala cart menu and buffet menu differs so much. May come back for the ala cart menu"
Great appreciation for the service at restaurant,"We frequent hai tien lo with our family and love the food and service. Specifically, Apple is always providing good service with a smile and attentiveness."
Horrible service.,"Intended to celebrate my wife's birthday but they ruined it. Restaurant opens at 11:30am but we were told staffs are on break when we arrived and food will not be prepared till they're back.

Then we were told to place our orders earlier because kitchen is already in a rush after staffs were back. After placing our orders earlier as advised, waitress passed a remark saying that we were greedy. It was a buffet and we were advised to order earlier, that same waitress called us greedy.

One of the dishes we ordered didn't taste good, the waitress said out loud ""what's wrong with the food"" in an interrogative manner and said out loud again that we need to pay for food wastage which gave us unnecessary negative attention. She created such an embarrassing situation out of a dish which we said wasn't good. We answered her question with the simplest answer, that it did not taste good. What else does she want from us? An analysis?

Summary:
A ruined birthday lunch and shall not return in future. Never ever recommend friends or anyone to go there. At least on special occasions, don't risk it!"
Fantastic Food with Average Service,"Family dinner on 3 October 2020, we have been very impressed by the fantastic dishes prepared by Hai Tien Lo's culinary team, it deserves at least 1 Michelin star from food presentation to taste.

Service standard on the day, however was only average at the best. Waiting staff kept the services at the minimal level, lacked warm hospitality compared to other fine dining restaurants in 5-star properties.

To make things worse, there was a table with 3 noise kids beside us, the kids were yelling loudly and running around, parents were rude enough to ignore it, service staff didn't make any efforts to inform the ill-mannered table to be considerate for others diners on the night."
Excellent food and service,"We had Combination of Pan-fried Scallop and Sliced Crispy Barbecued Suckling, Wok-fried Ribeye Beef Fillet with Red Wine Sauce and Steamed Silver Sea Perch Fillet with Preserved Vegetables. Excellent food. The service was good and the staff very friendly."
Super Dim Sum ever!!,Great place for dim sum and Cantonese food . Price valuable and staff are friendly and attentive. Will visit again soon.
Friends gathering!!!,Superb quality of food and service. The dim sum are tasty must try. I enjoyed it so much with my friends. A wonderful weekend we ever had!!!
Love the service and the space,"We had weekend buffet ala carte Tim Sum. There were plenty of dishes to choose from, a wide variety of dishes than Tim Sum. We love the buddha jumps over the wall soup and most of the items listed on the menu. The braised Tim sum chicken feet and the cute carrot Tim sum didn't meet our expectation. We hope they have more regular time sum item for the buffet. The service was prompt and lovely staff."
"Best venue, best service, best memories for guests and family","With the help from William and his Team, we are able to plan a small private wedding of 8 tables with family and closed friends with less than 3 weeks of wedding planning. The restaurant is able to fulfill our request eg. individual serving to all guests (not only to main table), temperature screening etc. Although there is no food tasting, the food served was delicious and well presented. Fish was very fresh and i love the desserts. The photos of the food were taken by our guests as they were amazed by the presentation and We occupied 4 private rooms, there are still room for kids to run around, private 2 piece band with all the speakers around and photographers.

We even specially ordered the oneh oneh cake as a wedding cake. Was so nice and no regret we ordered that.

Lastly, we really appreciate and grateful. William and his Team have been very professional and extended a lot of help which make the whole wedding so smooth and pleasant.

We wish the team all the best and hope we have chance to hold our future baby full month, birthdays, anniversary with our love ones and other celebrations."
One of the best Chinese restaurant in town,"Me and my wife had our ROM at Hai Tien Lou on 1 March 2020.

Before this, we never thought a restaurant in a hotel have this standard, but from that day onward, they proved they can do it.

Their food is super nice including vegetarian, all our guest are happy with the food.

Secondly, the staffs are very helpful, the waitress who served us, named Kelly, she delivered a best service for us.

Besides that, William (Manager) also help us a lot from the day we decided to held our ROM here. He attend to whatever questions we asked, our ROM will not have this smooth without him.

I will definitely going to visit Hai Tien Lou in future."
Best office lunch I ever had,It was really a nice treat for me. Very polished look yet delicious. many places have great looking food but taste is not up to it. On the pricey side but the pretty look and the refined flavors of the ingredients justifies the price. Will visit again to treat myself a good meal here!
A wonderful experience,We arrived at this restaurant quite late at night and were welcomed by staff. Staff were extremely helpful and happy to serve us. We had a variety of food but the duck was a standout! The skin was crispy and the meat succulent! The decor is beautiful.
Special Dinner in Singapore,"We were staying in the hotel and decided to try one of the Prosperous Reunion set menu dinners for Chinese New Year. We chose the Meteoric Sucess menu. It was six courses including various seafoods, pork and duck finishing with dessert. The variations in the flavours and textures was a wonderful experience, with strong mushroom flavours in the soup. Subtle lobster and udon noodles. The first course salad was sweet with a touch of ginger, chilli and crunchy carrots, sesame seeds and wontons. Roast duck and pork had their own sweet and fruity sauces. The dessert refreshed the palate with mango dessert, lychees and jelly. The jasmine tea provided a lovely complement to the rich food. Lovely experience."
"Limited Dim Sum Buffet Menu, Overpriced","Was there with 3 other friends for a birthday celebration and we tried the weekday Dim Sum buffet. Nothing was done from the restaurant despite leaving a comment that the reservation was for a birthday celebration. (Not a negative point, but also no wow factor considering many restaurants these days have a lot of other value added specials for occasions like this)

Food was so-so, but the dim sum menu was a little limited in terms of variety. The special dishes were only limited to 4 choices per table, which was a little disappointing and I wish they removed this criteria to make the buffet really worth it. Although there was 4 of us and this being a buffet, we could hardly eat a repeat dish of any of the items because they were all savoury dishes and it would be nice if they added some sweet fried dim sum items. (e.g. red bean pancake, banana prawn fritters etc.)

Service was good and average considering the expectations of a hotel restaurant. We were not advised that Chinese tea would be charged separately from the buffet cost so I have to make payment again having already pre-purchased the buffet vouchers from Chope.

Lastly, the QR redemption could not happen as the machine at Hai Tien Lo was faulty and I had to manually email the voucher to the hotel to redeem it. Not a big issue but just a little inconvenience to add on to the overall experience.

In summary, we will not return for the Dim Sum menu as we did not think it's really value for money for the price paid. For the same price, we could have endless options at other restaurants with more variety in their Dim Sum menu."
Lovely ambience and generous portions!,"The restaurant overlooks the main atrium at the Pan Pacific Singapore. Be sure to try the roast duck, claypot tofu, fish noodles, and soup served in coconut. The staff were also very friendly and attentive! Will definitely be back again!"
A cantonese gourmet's paradise,I ordered a mixture of dim sum dishes and ala carte ones. The result was truly yummylicious. Everyone enjoyed the meal. The dim sum was exceptionally scrumptious as the items were unique and tasty. The dumpling soup was also delicious. Truly an amazing gastronomic experience.
Fantastic Chinese Food,"We eat very well, The chinese food was fantastic and Lisa , The waitres Director, was very professional, speaking english and served us nicely"
Food is good but service is....,"The food created by Chef Ben taste great. Great taste comes with a price. It's
Pretty oily. As it's our 1st time, will remind the chefs to cut down on their oil. Would expect better service. 1 had to ask for 3 times and even had to walk personally to the counter staff to get a bowl of chilli. One of them even rolled her eyes and walked away. We would usually tip their staffs after our meal. For such service we decided not to.
The restaurant does serve excellent food. Perhaps the manager should look into their service staff in order to provide better dining experience."
good food - very nice staff - bit overpriced,"it tries to be fine dining and it achieves that goal but not for everything.
the best point is the staff, courteous, nicely mannered, smiling and very available.
The restaurant by itself is rather pretty but the view over the lobby is cold and plain modern which is not very cosy feeling neither romantic.
the food is overall good to very good - all is extremly well cooked (as well executed) - the only downside is that is lacks a little of originality... although the pepper beef plate was a nice surprise.
the overall feeling is that we could have the same meal in a much simpler place for way less money (230SGD for 2)... still good overall"
New improved menu,"Went for weekend ala carte buffet lunch on a Sunday. New improved menu from our last visit. Have some interesting pairing of black truffle infused Chinese buns, meat now. Service seems to be a bit slow during our visit (maybe due to weekend crowd). Overall a good experience once again at Hai Tien Lo. Go check it out."
Durian Dessert is a Must Try,"Went to this restaurant for lunch and it did not fail. Started with some dimsum, a double boiled seafood soup (very rich - to my liking). We
also had some salted egg prawn, roast duck, Tofu, seafood fried rice and veggies. Food is great thus worth a visit. The service was amazing. Thanks to Dennis who had been very attentive and impeccable in attending to us from serving the food, portioning, cleaning up the used flatware and silverwares. Well, i’m going to share the pictures, else, it did not
happen."
Great food and professional service,"Hosted my wedding dinner on the 28 September 2019 here at Hai Tien Lo. The food was amazing and my guests give praises to the food. Not only does it does it taste nice, it also uses quality ingredients. Definitely worth the money. Hai Tien Lo is a sort of modern Chinese Cantonese cuisine with its own unique set of dishes that you can’t find it elsewhere. It was the main reason I pick this restaurant to host my wedding.

No only the food is great, the waiters and waitress were well trained. Whenever I need any special requests, like additional vegetarian meals, the staffs were very fast to respond and they are very friendly. Even when the staff are busy, they won’t be irritated if you approach them for service, very professional.

Overall I would recommend their food and their service is great."
Nice food,"First time back in many years. My last visit the restaurant was on the top floor!

Interesting takes on quite a few dishes. Stuffed suckling pig with scallops. Peking duck served with fried beancurd skin, avocado and caviar!

The other dishes were well executed too: double boiled lotus root with chicken, minced pork with mushroom on mushroom, sea bass fillet, longevity noodle with shredded duck meat.

Worth a visit."
Making new friends over a nice meal,"First meeting with clients over dinner. The food and service did not disappoint at all. Started with mix platter of 6 types of appetizers which included roast meat. Followed by soup, steam fish, baby abalone with veg and toufu, fried noodles and tang yuan. Had a beer to ""clear"" away the haze that was affected the weather in Singapore...:) The quantity was just nice. Hope there is no MSG in the thick gravy used for the abalone dish. Overall, the restaurant is quite good place to entertain and had a quiet and spacious environment for all the guest. I think our clients like the place and the food as well."
Excellent dim sums,Love the dim sums here. Everything was very refined and delicious. But what surprised me was the charcoal bbq pork bun with gold leave. So soft and fresh.. we ordered another serving even though we were so full!
Great food topped with excellent service,"Organized a business dinner cum meeting at the private Ruby room. The Hai Tien Lo team of Apple, Carina and Kelly, led by William, did a tremendous job in ensuring that the dinner was served smoothly, with minimum disruptions and noises. Kudos to the Chef for helping with preparing special dishes for a guest who informed at the last-minute that he could not take shell-fish, as well as a special vegan meal for another guest.

Looking forward to working together with Hai Tien Lo for future events and confident that the service standards will be maintained and even surpassed in the future!"
Great service and nice food,"Im having an amazing night in Hai Tian Lo. The food was amazing, and the service was good as well. The environment was clean."
Cost-Performance is poor,"We came for the Weekend Lunch Buffet ($68.80++ w/o drinks) and it was an a la carte buffet. Chinese tea came at an additional $6++ per person. You can opt for unlimited drinks at a much higher cost.

The meal had started well. The wait-staff was pleasant and our table was fine even though most of the other tables were placed along a walkway overlooking the hotel lobby. We ordered the following:-

Three Treasures (one time order only):

There were 1) Buddha Jumps Over the Wall, 2) Abalone with Beancurd and 3) Prawns with raspberry sauce. These were good but our Buddha Jumps Over the Wall did not taste the same - one bowl was obviously not as good as the other.

Appetisers & BBQ specialties:

Combination roast meat platter - was not bad but the roast pork was 70% fat.

Note: from here it went downhill.

Deep Fried Crispy Cod - recommended by the waiter but we didn't like it. The cod was mushy and the batter was too oily that it overpowered the fish. The sauce (pomelo? but tasted mango) on top of the dish was too sweet and it didn't complement the dish at all.

Dim Sum:

Truffle Pork Bun - came wet and soggy. The pork smelled.
Deep Fried Beancurd Skin with Prawn Paste - we didn't want to have a second bite. They were over-fried, chewy and laden with MSG.
Deep Fried Prawn Dumplings - see above.
Prawns and Asparagus Dumplings - Just okay
Crystal Dumplings - Just okay

Signatures:

Spare ribs - don't know. Wasn't tempted to try.
Steamed fish with chilli and garlic - I like this. It was fresh. Wouldn't mind repeating the order.

Dessert:

Traditional soup - was bland yet tasted awful.
Mini mochi - was overly chewy I imagined two persons playing tug of war with it and it won't break.
Mini cakes - mediocre.

My advise for anyone going is: avoid the deep fried items. Not many places do it so badly.

And the tea? ... Too expensive for the quality.

."
Good food mediocre service,"We went for our wedding anniversary dinner, which I had specified in our reservation. However, no notice was taken. The food was excellent, but the service was mediocre."
Wedding Lunch,"Good food with nice plating, function room decoration was great, as well as nice service. Especially the dessert mango pudding with fruits were delicious."
