Unique and Outstanding experience in Singapore!,"This place is really fantastic !

The food, the drinks, the ambiance, the people involved in the service … we were so, so impressed!
Gives you the vibes of a sky bar, but at the same time, keeps you connected with the modern and unique concept that they have.
Perhaps that is why they have this name “Neon s Pigeon” :)
Hats off to Duke and to the entire staff that made our experience so very memorable! Well done.
Looking forward to return."
Cool bar,"Cool popular place. Prices around 50EUR pp with some drinks. Service is good, food is quite nice. Good for Sunday dinner and drinks"
Worst Service Ever Experienced in a Restaurant,"Food was pretty good but unfortunately negated by the worst service I have ever had in a ""restaurant"". Was never sure who our server was and sat for most of the time without drinks and a glass a water that was only filled once. Had the tasting menu which had some delicious dishes but we were never served one of the dishes and some of the items were served out of order. But honestly, by that point, we were full and had frankly had enough of the non-existent service.
They had a special event (on which I get), but if you're not going to pay any attention to your guests who are willing to pay, then don't accept dinner reservations, or at least have wait staff who will work instead of partying and taking shots."
Great service and atmosphere ut high prices,"Entering Neon Pigeon is a good experience.There is a vibrancy and buzz to the place and the staff are helpful and friendly.We had a table booked but the staff were happy to move us to one in a corner which we preferred.(Incidentally the staff all seemed to be non-Singaporeans and certainly Singaporean themselves do not have a good service culture).
The much heralded cocktails were good and the knock-out we had heard about.
The food is interesting (we believe the chef from New York was there that night) and tastes good.However the pricing is high:for instance Miso black cod at $39 and smoked leek at $20.
For me the biggest negative was the wine-list.The cheapest wine was $95 and the rest of the small selection were very expensive and very uninteresting.It's a bugbear of mine here where many Singaporean restaurants do not allow corkage but offer only ordinary wines at very high prices.It is rapacious price-gouging as there is no value added by themselves.I'd recommend diners to stock to the cocktails and forget the wine.
We left feeling well fed and with a good buzz, but not feeling we got value for money."
"Impressive customer service, and creative, flavourful food","My friend and I had a fantastic dinner at Neon Pigeon last night!

I was most impressed with the service, including Belinda and JP in taking the time to reply to my emails beforehand, and for someone who took the initiative to share my requests regarding the beef short ribs with the chef, who went out of his way to prepare us a smaller portion of the new Japanese beef short ribs now on the menu, knowing we wanted to try this dish but were worried about the size being too large for two people. It blew me away, that level of thoughtfulness and customer service is truly impressive and one of the reasons I will keep returning. The service was great throughout the evening, we loved that the chef took the time to come out and explain the dishes to us, and make recommendations about the size and number of dishes to order (spot on too, we had just the right amount of food). The rest of the servers were equally attentive and helpful, refilling our water, checking on our drinks and clearly plates promptly.

We also weren't rushed out at 7:30 when our table was meant to be returned. Even though we knew we had a 90 minute dining limit we only noticed at nearly 8:00 that we'd been allowed to stay longer as the table wasn't yet needed at 7:30, which we really appreciated, to have that extra time to visit.

And the food! So good! I've always loved the food at Neon Pigeon, and once again it was fantastic. The pork and langoustine dumplings were awesome, stuffed full of meat with thin, tender wrappers and that amazing curry sauce, and the truffle mushroom rice was incredible, so rich and absolutely packed full of so much umami mushroom and truffle flavour. And the highlight was undoubtedly the beef short rib galbi. The beef stole the show, it was a great cut with just the right amount of marbling, and cooked to perfection, unbelievably tender. The sauce was divine, with just the right amount of sweetness which worked perfectly with the pickled veg, and the steamed buns were warm, fluffy little pillows of goodness, which your chef happily topped up for us when we asked. The drinks were excellent too, my friend enjoyed her cocktail and we both enjoyed our wine.

So once again, Neon Pigeon has lived up to my expectations. I will be back again soon!"
"Good food, even better cocktails","Visited with a group of girlfriends in April for lunch. Enjoyed all our cocktails and lunch dishes! Recommendations given by the server was spot on. Lively ambience, great music."
Amazing staff and drinks,We did the brunch and the staff were so accommodating. The drinks were delicious and the food was great. Would highly recommend!
"Portion was small, average food","Staff seemed confused when we asked about the sake taste, all he answered was ""good"". Food was pricey and portions were small. $24 for 2 scallops? Mask not worn properly (below nose) while grilling our food. Overall not worth the money."
Lovely nice place in carpenter street,"I have been here few times, super friendly staff and lovely cocktails and nice Japanese food. Few rounds of free drinks, nice cozy ambience. Not many vegetarian dish though, asparagus something is must try"
Hip restaurant with good small plates,Fun restaurant with good food - we liked every dish and loved some - good cocktails and a friendly staff. Enjoyed our evening and would go back!
Dinner with friends,"Had a fabulous dinner here with friends. Food, ,floor and bar service on point! Keep up the good work Team Neon Pigeon!"
Outstanding experience,The food was the winner. Amazing service. Ambience took you away from Gloomy Covid times. Loved every bit!!
Let down by Mediocre service,"I would score higher if neon pigeon were to position itself as a cocktail bar with food services as the atmosphere was spot on and conducive despite COVID restrictions. The cocktail was good and I would recommend neon pigeon for its cocktail. The service has much room for improvement as even with two servers to one table at the time (we were the only ones there). The back of house had to prompt the front of house to attend to me after a few failed attempts. This together with forgetting my order and not informing me to put the lemon bitter into my cocktail were some of the areas that could be improved. Otherwise, the food was average apart from the hummus and curried chips, which was excellent."
"Great atmosphere, food and service","We'd been to the old restaurant and this new venue is much better! Even with no music, there was atmosphere, the service was great and food delicious."
Brilliant evening,"Fantastic food, great cocktails and stellar service. Came here for the first time, and found it to have a great vibe, really nice food and a great mix of cocktails. Nicol made sure we had a great evening, making great suggestions and not steering us wrong. Happy to come back again soon!"
Very cool.,"Really enjoyed all the small plates ( we ordered the Bao, Tataki and Bone Marrow ). Large plates ( Cod and Duck ) were just a tad overcooked ( in my very uneducated opinion ) but curry pumpkin puree with the duck was delicious. Cocktails were awesome. I can only imagine with some music and a few more people ( were came in "" restricted "" times ) Neon Pigeon would be a lot of fun and very cool indeed. Service was excellent."
50 birthday celebration,"The food and drinks were unique, though it was expensive. The service topped our experience. Thanks!"
Nowhere near as good as I remember at the previous venue,"Nowhere near as good as I remember at the previous venue. Food was average at best, completely overpriced for what we received.

Was my favourite restaurant in Singapore prior lockdown, wont go back"
Hands down top 3 restaurants in SG,Small plates so that you can enjoy a spread of variety? Sign me up! Was pleasantly surprised that some presumed staples can taste so elevated. Will be back to sample more! The only small issue is that wines are priced a little too high for its value.
"Hip and happening, good social vibes but...","Great place for a Fri evening or to hang loose after work with colleagues...the party vibe and game is strong! Food is good, but nothing struck me as out of the ordinary or with a unique signature to pull me back again for a food experience. Service was very rushed too due to the large crowded venue. We got the bar seating (in a corner with our back to the rest of the restaurant) which was not really conducive for us as a family to have any conversation over a meal or get to enjoy the vibe inside, wish we had known during the reservation that it was bar seating and I might have changed my plans (or at least drop us an email to let us know). Drinks are also super expensive. It's a nice place for a casual social fun party evening though but not for a nice dining experience in itself."
Love this place,"It is amazing, great ambiance, amazing drinks, food is super creative and yummy. Just a bit pricey, but worth it."
"Good food, somewhat overpriced!","We went for brunch. Nice place to chill with friendly service staff. The food was also different from most other brunch places and we appreciated the interesting menu. Food was above average. However, there are better places for brunch/lunch at that price point ($140 for 4 persons)."
"Loud music, food portion little","Although we only had drinks and desserts, the overall food portions seemed to be small. For example, our dessert of bonsai 3.0 came like a handful. Quite shocking. We had 4 people . We ordered the yuzu brulee which was slightly better in terms of size. If the mains are of that size, then i would this place is not worth the money.However. cocktails are probably the ones worth coming for . Great concoction and funky drinks name"
Trying too hard food,"I was very excited to try Neon Pigeon. The food looked promising, with a fusion japanese take. The interior decor is fun with lots of grunge and graffiti. Service was attentive and helpful. The menu had a really good selection of drinks and food. However, the food was a letdown. Everything was either overwhelmed with sauces or overly salted. Their togarashi monkfish had so much gochujang, I could barely tell if it was fish I was eating, likewise for their fried chicken rice. The codfish katsu was so salty, I needed to rinse my palate after. Even the dry sake we ordered could not wash out the heavy flavors. Best dish of the evening was the bone marrow, it was nicely done, flavorful and balanced. So much promise, but far from potential."
Good but could be better,Table was taken by someone else under my reservation but I was seated eventually. Some hit and misses on their menu. Tokyo hummus is spectacular! The misses for me were the white miso eggplant and Korean fried chicken rice.
Bird feed with killer music and cocktails,"Neon Pigeon is minted in the cool kid dining and cocktail lexicon. The new venue boasts a bigger space, more visually exciting with the usual suspect old-time favourites such as Toyko Hummus which is everyone’s first choice. So popular it is that there is an army of dips lined up at the counter. We ordered plenty – tamagoyaki omelette, cauliflower, roasted white miso eggplant (so good), wings and from the coveted raw bar – salmon sashimi and scallops. It’s Japanese gone trigger-happy fusion. Cocktails are really the reason why you’re here. Matching the killer looks of the dishes, the IG-worthy ones are Boshi Maker, Negroni tears (presented in that J’dore lookalike perfume bottle), Samar sen and Kosupure – sparkling green cocktail served in a glass pigeon flute (Koma has the same trick pony incidentally). As it was my birthday, we had a complimentary dessert which looked like pigeon poop and tasted like bircher muesli – totally unimpressive and the real letdown. We had free rounds of sake which made everyone ruddy-red-faced merry as we celebrated the killer music selection of music not for the millennials. Neon pigeon does dish out bird feed portions but it’s all in all a good spot."
Dinner,Cozy place. Goods are nice. Services are good n we are serviced with a free cup of sake. But I have to pay for my warm water. Indicated “unlimited “
Dinner and Drinks Neon Pigeon 2,"Service was excellent, waitstaff were very attentive and proactive.
Had a whisky sour which was good.
Food was so-so for the price point. We have starters which were good but the mains fell short."
V 2.0 = Utter Rubbish,"Was super excited to try what USED TO BE one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. WAS MASSIVELY DISAPPOINTED. New location is lame. Food is nowhere near what it used to be yet seems even more expensive. And the service sucked.

Dunno what happened but Neon Pigeon Management if you're reading this. DO BETTER PLEASE!!!"
Worst table in the house for my friend’s birthday- thanks (booked 6 weeks in advance),"There was much hype about our first visit to neon pigeon as we loved the original one at Keong Siak. To ensure a nice table I booked a table over a month prior to our dinner, put my card down and asked specifically for a nice table as we were celebrating a girlfriends birthday.
I get to dinner and see that I have been allocated the table next to the washroom (worst table). I asked the wait staff if I could be placed elsewhere and I received a comment along the lines of “oh this is on of the best tables here!” Erm okay, not really when mid-meal we are being greeted with smells from the washroom. We were a small group of 3, it wouldn’t have been too difficult to move us off a 5 person table. Food was 5/10 and the Tokyo hummus was nice the Korean chicken was ok but not nearly enough for us service wise. Will not return, thanks."
It is always excellent service as always!,"This is my second visit to Neon Pigeon in 3 months. Cocktail is always good. They try to throw up a few surprises every now and then on the food offerings. The only dish that sort of not meet our expectation is the monkfish. Definitely a place to chill with you friends, or just your lovely other half!"
"Overpriced food, consistent violation of COVID regulations","Was excited to revisit Neon Pigeon in their new locale. This turned out to be an extremely disappointing visit on the whole.

Food: over-priced, and overall drop in quality:

1. Their hummus has always been a winner. Only 5-6 super thin chips (VERY thin toasted bread) are provided with the hummus, which pretty much forces you to purchase more. Extra chips are charged at $3, and the $3 more gives you 5 -6 more super thin pieces; which is really not enough to consume the remaining hummus with.

2. Baby back ribs were waaaay to fatty. Had to bite in to each rib several times just to bite off and spit out chunks of fat. Super greasy, and gross as a result.

3. The absolute rip off is the Hokkaido scallop. When we asked whether it would be enough to share among the three of us, we were happily told that there were 3 servings. Indeed... for $22 there was one scallop... cut into three pieces.

Let me say that again: $22 for ONE scallop. See pic attached

Drinks:
Not too bad. They've always had a great drinks programme.

Service:
General staff are ok, but are under pressure to remind you (repeatedly) that you only have 90mins.

COVID violations:
We were there at Neon Pigeon's Keong Siak Street closing in 2019. Even then they were violating COVID mask wearing rule - more than one staff member was wearing their mask as a chin strap. I thought perhaps they didn't care since they were closing down, but apparently this lackadaisical attitude has been extended to their new restaurant.

At the current Carpenter street outlet: the music was very loud! I don't think that is allowed in SG restaurants still, as part of COVID-related precautionary restrictions. This forced our table to shout at each other while eating, also also required us to raise our voices when talking to the wait staff.

Unfortunately, in addition to the loud music, I also noticed that one of the main waitstaff, a lady who has short blue/green coloured hair was walking around half the time wearing her mask on her chin; with her nose and mouth completely exposed.

Worse still, I noticed two chefs - working at the open kitchen - not wearing their masks either for the entire time we were there.

(I would not make such claims if I did not have video evidence of this. )

Fat Prince with their new management and staff, got everything right, and this sister restaurant has got everything wrong.

Too bad."
Ticks all the right boxes!,"We were here yesterday for dinner and were impressed by the immaculate service equally matched by scrumptious food (try: Crab bao, Pork ribs, Chicken wings, Tokyo hummus, Kosho Cauliflower) topped up by several Negronis and an infectious vibe to boot. I would eat here everyday if I could.

Special thanks to all the staff for running a slick operation."
Live up to their expectation,"Well known in the F&B industry as the hipster bar and “tapas” place, decided to give it a try at their new place. Been always a fan of how their marketing team market this branding. It really intrigued me and would really like to see if it’s worth the “noise”.

Ambiance wise, so much better than their previous location at Keong Saik, as this is much more convenient to come over via public transport and there’s plenty of nearby parking place.

Food wise, came with not much expectations but the food is decent, no complain about it. The hummus, recommended by the bartender Andy as “life changing hummus” blew us away. Simple food, but they executed the flavour perfectly. Bone marrow was “orgasmic” (lol). Tried other small plates and bar bites but these 2 plates captured and stood out in our tastebuds.

Drink wise, as expected of a hip cocktail/sake bar. Told Andy to recommend some drinks for my partner whom like fruity drink and I like sour and strong drink and he have kindly did something off the menu. And we definitely can’t stop at just a glass. Thanks to the 10:30 curfew, we couldn’t ordered more than we would like. Could get drunk all night at the bar. Lol. Not forgetting the complimentary shots of sake they keep giving all night long, I guess the benefit of sitting by the bar counter. Well, like any typical Singaporean, I love free goodies, so I’ll take it anytime. Nice gestures by the bartenders!

Service wise, well well well, what more can I say. I love the approach of the staff. Very very friendly and welcoming from the moment the greeter greet you at the door and sit you at your table. Outstanding service by the 3 bartenders, particular Andy and Adam! Truly a gem in this industry, cause afterall, a good service makes an unforgettable dining experience no matter how “decent” the quality of food are.

Price wise, totally worth the value. Will definitely come back again whenever we crave for the drinks that Andy make and hopefully the next time we come, Adam (whom we assumed is a trainee, but still giving awesome service) would be able to let us try his off the menu drink invention!

Kudos to Andy and Adam for the amazing service. And kudos to team Neon Pigeon for giving a wonderful dining experience. Give yourself a pat in the back and continue to be awesome!

See you again! Till next time."
Excellent Service but perhaps not for vegetarians,"The staff was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. However the person delivering the food did not highlight the dry fish in the seasoning, in spite of specifically having asked for vegetarian food. Could do with a more vegetarian friendly menu"
Spending big money to appreciate simple is a new way of living.,"Great vibe, great food and drinks. But will I pay that much money for the experience I could get in any other hipster bars again? Probs not!"
"Food ok, felt rushed, inconsistency with bill at end","Food ok, constantly reminded of 90 min sitting. Extra charges at end plus paid cash/card and charged extra on card"
Family dinner,"Food is good, service is good! Service crew is very helpful and friendly! Can't wait to try again! Do visit their shop!"
great times! good vibes!,"all my French friends love that place! Like every time were asking to go there.
SO it a very popular place near the center!
Service is nice and food was good to go too!

A bit expensive in my opinion but Always a pleasant experience!

check it out!"
Cannot figure out why everyone loves this place,"After reading the positive reviews, we decided to try out Neon Pigeon. I’m sad to say that it was a total disappointment.

The food was extremely over seasoned and salty. We had several dishes, but the hummus was the only one that was very good. The scallops, beef dumplings, and tuna ceviche were all disappointing. The rump steak was okay but nothing remarkable (and also over seasoned).

Moreover, I was really surprised by the poor service. I waited at least 15 minutes for a classic margarita, despite my companion having his drink already (twice). They are very strict about the length of time you can have the table, which is totally fine since communicated upfront. However, the way they approach you about it borders on rude. Several times, we were approached with a reminder that they needed the table back at 7pm (this was around 630pm). When the table next to us was seated, instead of saying “enjoy your meal” it was “don’t forget we need the table back at 9pm.” It gives the feeling that they don’t actually want you there.

All in all, a very mediocre and disappointing experience!"
Great night out,Verdict: Awesome food and cocktails Great atmosphere. Very nice staff Area for improvement: extend the wine list
Sunday lunch - perfection!,"We ordered the Sunday lunch from
Neon Pigeon and it was D E L I C I O U S. So much so that I didn’t have time to take any photos! Both the kids and adults loved the beef and chicken yakitori - cooked to perfection even with delivery which is no mean feat! - hummous and yuzu puffs.

The icing on the cake was the incredibly easy order process and the excellent customer service by Eddy. Thanka again for making our Sunday so special!"
Pure delight!,"Amazing restaurant with the best atmosphere in normal times and a great delivery in COVID19 times! Food is always perfect, the drinks innovative and tasty and the Sake just rounds up the Japanese fushion dining experience! Must-go/-deliver!"
Great food delivered to your door during lockdown,"We recently wanted something a bit fancier than the average delivery we'd been eating during the lockdown to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Normally, we'd want to dine out somewhere nice, but due to the Covid-19 lockdown in Singapore, we decided to have the fine dining come to us. We have eaten at Neon Pigeon before, and loved the food and the vibe of the restaurant. Luckily, we have found that they are doing island wide delivery with their sister restaurants (Fat Prince and Sumerlong). I'm glad to say that the food is just as delicious delivered as it is in the restaurant, although of course the vibe wasn't as good at home! I can definitely recommend the pork belly, short ribs and the marinated mushroom from Neon Pigeon. The other great thing is that you can add food items from the sister restaurants, so we also had some delicious kebabs from Fat Prince. For the quality of the food, I felt that it was completely affordable, and much less than what we would have paid if we'd gone out to eat at a restaurant. Needless to say, my wife and I really enjoyed our anniversary dinner, and we'll be sure to order from Neon Pigeon again when we get bored of the usual boring delivery menus again!"
Awesome Night Out ...... at Home.,"Had delivery from Neon tonight and the food was incredible. My wife devoured the hummus and I the wagyu beef dumplings.

One of my favorite features was that the meal came with a soundtrack to play while we ate. It brought back to the. Fun and delightful atmosphere of the restaurant. I can not wait for the lockdown to end so I can visit soon. In the meantime I will be ordering again this week. Thank you!!"
Amazing takeaway experience from Neon,"An amazing experience! You can make your Circuit Breaker evenings an amazing experience when you order from Neon Pigeon. Eddie makes things easy and smooth and all you need to do is to enjoy the Beautifully presented, deliciously surprising tastes and textures melting in your mouth.
Don’t miss the Korean crispy chicken - it is amazing how it arrives and stays so fabulously crispy. The wagyu beef dumplings have an amazing texture. The asparagus is the best we’ve had and we love this vegetable so we’ve had hundreds of versions of it all over the world but Neon Pigeon wins the price for the best. The vegetarian option (tofu bento) was also delicious. The dinner ended with the fabulous desert which comes with the bento box meals. Don’t miss this amazing opportunity to make your dinner tonight special.
Thank You, Neon Pigeon!"
Great delivery service-just like being there!,"I’ve been to Neon Pigeon a few times - always enjoying their fantastic Japanese fusion food and cocktails. The staff are friendly (especially Eddy), the music is great and the atmosphere so much fun. With the current restrictions on restaurants unable to have dine in customers I decided to order from their takeaway menu. Ordering was so easy and I was given a few options on how to pay. I was also advised when the delivery was on its way (so I was ready to receive my food!).
As for the food it was the same quality and taste as the restaurant. We had the bento boxes (steak and Korean chicken). The steak melted in your mouth with it’s beautiful mushroom sauce and the Tokyo hummus was soooo good! The wagyu dumplings were also very meaty and a great size!
They are also going cocktails which come in a bottle with instructions of “pour me over ice”. To make it really special we were also given the QR code to their playlist...so it nearly felt like we were there! All that was missing was Eddy’s charm and laughter and the odd sake shot!
Thanks for the care and attention of this delivery-we really appreciated it and can’t wait to have it again (second delivery already in the last two weeks!).
I also have a few photos to share so you can see how good the food is!"
Fun vibe,"Bit pricey but if you’re a foodie it’s worth it, sensational flavours and great cocktails. Great night out!"
Great food with a twist -,Great food with a twist - good value too at $50 per person for the feeder menu - Wednesday night treat 😁
Love the food and ambience!,This place is so cool! The food is so good! Love the bacon fried rice and Korean Fried Chicken! Staff takes care of you and makes sure you have a good time👍
Awesome,Best service ever. Had amazing food and drinks. Would 14/10 comeback and say hi to the amazing people who helped me and got me my drinks. Thanks a lot everyone much love and much thanks.
Great time at Neon P,"First time to Neon Pigeon with my best friend. We were seated on the couch near the entrance and it was really comfy. We ordered a bunch of dishes and my goodness, the hummus was amazing! So was the soft shell crab buns. The bartender also made us drinks according to our preferences and it turns out delicious. A shoutout to Don, who was such a sweetheart with a great personality. Thank you everyone!"
Looking forward to our next visit,"Awesome food, drinks and atmosphere. 2nd time we have visited Neon Pigeon - after been recommend by a friend. Won’t disappoint"
20/10 would recommend for everyone,"Chill vibe, great people. Love their Tokyo Hummus, wonderful Soft Shell Crab Bao, delightful Charcoal Fire Rump, that beautiful Pan Seared Scallop. Ooh la la~ 10 out of 10 would recommend. Everything in that restaurant speaks quality and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Thank you Neon Pigeon."
"Excellent Food, Great Ambience",Not my first time at Neon (food is always 10/10) but I was surprised that they continued to have great service even on Valentine's Day. There was two of us and we sat at the bar. It was more crowded than usual but the bartenders still managed to entertain us and get drinks out in a speedy manner. My glass was never empty - kudos to the bar crew for keeping an eye on that ;)
Fab food in a trendy atmosphere,"Loved the food here! Small plates of Japanese food. Recommend the Brussels sprouts and the beef tataki alongside the soft shell crab Bao buns. It’s a trendy, dark restaurant and very noisy so don’t go for a quiet romantic meal. Must go!!"
Great atmosphere,"Really cool ambience once you walk into the space! And was recommended the teared negroni and Tokyo hummus by Tracy, definitely did not disappoint! We’ll be back soon:)"
You have to come here before you die,"The atmosphere at this place is impeccable, with lots of food options and great drinks. Try their signature drinks!! Also BK, the bartender, is a great host. 10/10"
"Great service, nice drinks",Bartenders were very friendly and attentive. Location is great and drinks were great. Thank you Eugene for the great service!
Simply amazing!,"Visited the bar on a Wednesday night. What can I say, I absolutely love the ambience and decor. Totes digging the music selection as well. Totally my vibe. And I'm the sort that loves to drink at the bar and chat with the staff. I was tended to by Rachel and BK behind the bar that night and they did well to keep me engaged and kindly offered me drinks that was suited to my palette. It was quite a joy to watch them work as well. The rest of the staff were super friendly in their engagements as well. I felt very at ease even though it was my first time there. Overall it was an evening well spent and I look forward to my next visit to Neon Pigeon with my new friends there."
Yummy cocktails and Great vibes!,"Celebrated my birthday here with friends and it was awesome! Cocktails were yummy and innovative. Food was also delicious, I loved the bone marrow and the bread with the soft shell crab. Staff attentiveness and helpfulness was superb. A really cool place with cool vibes!"
Wow! Our last night in Singapore,"Wow! Our last night in Singapore and what a fantastic meal! The food was a great fusion of influences from Japan, Asia as a whole and Europe. The Tokyo Hummus and Smoked Potatoes were delicious and beautifully presented. We followed these delights with the Duck Tonkatsu and my favourite, the Smoked Baby Backed Ribs. The meat was so tender!! The service backing up the food was exemplary. Thank you Don and team for a special evening! A definite reason to return to this wonderful country!!"
A Singapore gem.,"What am amazing find . A truly magical food experience.Lovely atmosphere and Don provided great service.
The Tokyo Hummus was yummy and so too the Smoked potatoes,followed by Duck Tonkatsu and melt in your mouth Ribs.
One of the best meals we have eaten in a while.
A must on your next trip to Singapore."
Second time was a miss,"I felt s need to review because this was my second visit and I was so excited because the first visit was phenomenal! Sadly this one dissapointed. Food was bland, the staff tried their best to keep up on such a busy night and I applaud that! But I was unfortunately dissapointed."
"Great food, great service!","Came here for late dinner, as I was recommended by some friends who work nearby. My wife and I shared the following dishes:

Hummus
Crab Bao
Curry Rice (my favourite!)
Donburi
Meatballs

The bartender was very helpful in recommending us cocktails. Service was very attentive as they made sure to clear empty plates as soon as we finished, because the tables were small

We will definitely be back again, thank you!"
Awesome place,"Great food and awesome drinks. Must try items are the hummus, the soft shell crab and the unagi rice!"
Amazing Food Bar and Atmosphere,"I always make sure when I travel to Singapore every few months that Neon Pigeon is at the top of my list to visit.

Their food is always so delicious and my taste buds always come away feeling amazing

The Bar is great with amazing cocktails and a good Wine and Sake selection.

The staff are always attentive and polite and always remember me

It has a great atmosphere and its a must for me"
Excellent vibe and delicious food.,We love neon Pigeon but unfortunately this time that staff were over run and the restaurant was operating on manic energy. We had booked a table for 8pm But weren’t seated until 8.30pm. We still had a lovely time though!
Buzzing atmosphere,This is a really buzzing restaurant where the service and food are really good with generous proportions. If you want to avoid the obvious tourist places then this should be on your list.
Best hangout place,Always be my first choice of hangout place to get my cocktail fix with friendly bartender that match with my taste.
Valentines days and casual visits,"One of the best bar and restaurants in town!! Food is top notch, staffs are super friendly and creative. Bar tenders make nice custom drinks cater to your style and interest. Overall a very pleasant experience."
Best place ever,"Ambience is amazing, food is fantastic and well worth for it's pricings. Strongly recommend for anyone looking for great food and experience."
Highly recommended !!!,"We were all impressed with the food, atmosphere/ambience, highly recommended. Especially their soft shell crab bao and roasted bone marrows are so amazing. We will definitely be going back as this place is one of our favourite restaurants in Singapore!!! They had the time when the staff goes around and pour the sake into our mouth and it was an unique experience.

Thanks to all the staff, they were so friendly and helpful. It was flawless, great value, and a perfect night out for us 4:)"
Coolest Vibe in Singapore,"Had the most amazing time with my friends for dinner. The vibe is great with cool graffiti on the wall. The staff are friendly and attentive and the the best part, the food was amazing. I am not sure what they put in that hummus dip, It is addicting and we kept reordering! The soft shell bao was tasty and the Bone Marrow melted right in our mouths. They have great cocktails that had us ordering more than we wanted. At one point, their friendly staff would come by your table and pour sake right into your mouth! Overall we had a wonderful time and will return!"
Best hummus and cocktails!,"Combine quality food and drinks with a stellar team and fun environment!

Their take on hummus is the best ever. Sit by the bar and get a cocktail while youre there!"
The reason why you put up with the din is the knockout food,"There’s a reason why this is so highly raved and still packs a crowd despite having been in the extremely finicky restaurant scene for a while. It’s a true doyen for the ultra-hip trendy diner. The innovative experimental culinary plays with Japanese food pay off with exquisite creations that are daringly tasty yet clean in presentation. Hail to dishes such as Tokyo Hummus (my fav of the lot), eggplant and snapper.

Deceptively simple looking but explodes with flavours is what I can think of. The underground vibe reaffirms the modest vibe. Wall murals, loud music and neon touches meant this is a world for the young and hip. You might be annoyed at the din and your rising voice levels required to have a decent conversation but that’s the whole concept so get along with it. Oh, get the cocktails. It’s whimisical unconventional fun."

Cocktails,"Best place with cool drinks by the bartenders here. Customize drinks with personal liking. A place that can hang over with friends, colleagues & couple for date night."
"Great Ambience, awesome Bartenders !!!!!","Must visit when you’re in town, their smoked negroni is a must try! Look for Corbin when you’re here."
"Top food, remember to book in advance, and also confirm your booking from the email on the same day (peeewh!)","Booked this one week in advance of the trip to make sure we got a table.
We had a rough start with this restaurant... They apparently send a email you have to confirm to keep your booking, and this is on the same day of the booking (I think the email was sent 3 hours before show time)! This did not work as I do not not read emails in weekends!
Since I had missed the email, we arrived at the restaurant (a few minutes past the booked time), and they had given our table away! It is also expected that you keep the table for 15 minutes as you state in the reservation details!
Not impressed by that, I booked a week in advance because I intend to eat here on the time I booked. We were told that it will be sorted, just wait in the bar, 1.5 hours later we got a table to finally eat!
I do understand this is a hip and trendy place, and they can easily maintain business regardless of the few that get dissapointed because of their inconvenient reservation system.

Anyway, lets talk food instead, which is why we were here.
The food had very nice twists to the classic dishes which they are based on. The dishes are balanced and surprising flavors. All respect to the chefs who have reinvented the izakaya style.
The dishes are sharing type, and will give you a option to try many of them!
The combinations of food are awsome, and goes well with your drink of choice, handcrafted cocktails from their top bartenders is recommended. The cocktail list is exciting, and surpirsing, was not expecting some of the combined ingredients to work so well together :)

The waitors and waitressess are professional, and is not the reason for the bad service score! The reservation system is the one that kills the service score."
Place was super good and Ashley,"Place was super good and Ashley as a bartender was amazing! Definitely recommended as a nice place to hang out in Singapore,amazing cocktails and good food!"
Good vibe and interesting menu,A small restaurant for drinks and fusion food. Good vibes. Good for gatherings with friends. The portions are small but the sauces are very tasty. A busy place that needs booking in advance. The drinks are relatively expensive but overall it’s a place worth trying.
Amazing place!,"One of my favourite places to go in Singapore, loving their modern urban Izakaya style! food is amazing and very creative, Tokyo hummus, hamachi tartar , the soft shell crab bao and the Bonsai dessert are the ones that I always get ;) Cocktails.... Negroni or G&T always, great selection on Japanese sakes too, the team is really attentive and well managed By The GM Eddy, a french dude with a lot of knowledge and stories to share. Worth getting to know him/them."
Fun restaurant,Really fun and cool restaurant with a lot of energy and vibe. Great cocktails and food. Fun place to go with a group or as a couple.
Great drinks and service but food needs to step up,"Attentive mixologist and service crew - they changed my drink even without me asking when I mentioned it was too sweet - high five for that

I was on my own and ordered:
Chicken wings - too sweet (perhaps better to leave the sauce on the side as a dip?)
Bone marrow - toppings ruined it as it was too sweet
Snapper - the same sweet base was used and there’s just not enough balance hence the sweetness overtook the flavours
Hamachi tartare - perfect

I seemed to remember food being better previously"
in need of value,"Foremost, the value of dining here is an issue: without sounding like it is acceptable to pay excessively for ""fine dining"", how am I to stomach an average 15$ for a tiny plate and 32$ for a large plate of tapas when:

1) the service doesnt quite cut it - we were almost sidelined by the 'host' over a bunch of 'expatriates' even though we were clearly first in line. AND your staff needs to be properly trained to receive guests in a manner apropos to the perceived value of the Neon Pigeon experience- ie, if you've asked for a glass of warm water, i'd expect topups to be only warm and your service staff HAVE TO MAKE NOTE OF THAT (but hey, i kept getting a generic refill of cold water) and that's not quite the service standard i'd expect vis-a-vis the price of dining here.

2) regardless of how wonderfully your dishes are received on our palate, dining is a holistic experience, ie a decent table size and decent table ware and NO DISPOSABLE WOODEN CHOPSTICKS. Come on...."
Friend bday celebration,"Everything is perfect, just that the seating arrangement is very cramp. Food is delicious though it is very pricey. Services is fantastic though they forgotten to serve a complimentary bday desert as mentioned through email. But overall is recommended. Will come back again"
Great night!,"We visited as a group of four and ordered the feeders choice. We enjoyed fantastic service, unbelievable food and awesome cocktails! Highly recommended. We will be back!"
Divine.,"Highly recommend this place. The food was brilliant, featuring a contemporary fusion menu. The hummus, the ribs and the miso eggplant are all standout dishes. The cocktails were creative, without being OTT. Service was warm and attentive."
It's simply a must do!,"This place never fails to deliver on great food, fun atmosphere and wonderful service. This is my Singapore go-to and one place that I always take visitors to. I'd be putting this at the top of your list if you visit or if you live here! Enjoy :)"
Amazing food and Service,"The food is a asian fusion style and was lovely. It is similar to a tapas bar in that you order a number of small plates per person.
As there was 2 of us they suggested 7 small plates but I could have eaten more after this so they aren't massive portions.
The service was excellent and very efficient. Part way through the meal one of the waiters came round with a huge bottle of sake and proceeded to pour this in our mouth for 5 seconds. He did this to everyone in the restaurant and it is a thing that they do apparently.
The total bill was on the expensive side but I put this down to drinking imported white wine rather than the food.
Overall, loved the food and the atmosphere so would definitely recommend a visit."
Amazing,"First thing first is the service, Amazing so efficient and polite. Second is the drinks, they do it with passion and it taste so good. Food is amazing. The hummus is the best appetiser to start off with. We tried most of the food there. It’s so good and fresh not forgetting it was made quickly as we ordered. Will definitely come back not just for the food and drinks but for the service as well!"
Lovely evening,Me and my boyfriend had a wonderful time in NP. The staff are all attentive to your needs. The food is just amazing. Its a good place to just unwind and relax.
Not As Expected,"We made reservations on recommendations of travel bloggers and we left so disappointed. The food is overpriced and the food is not freshly prepared and came out lukewarm which brought down the value even further. The tables are so close you can follow the conversations of fellow dining guests. This restaurant is a tourist destination and if you are into that, this place is for you."
"Fantastic Vibe, Fantastic Bartender!","Love it so much here. The drinks are beautiful and super tasty, the music is excellent, and Corbin is fantastic at creating drink creations that meet just what you describe. Also edamame hummus- you need it."
Food heaven,Trendy place with peculiar drinks and wonderful choice of small portions you can share. We tried 7 different dishes and loved everything! Reservation recommended especially on Fri and Sat.
