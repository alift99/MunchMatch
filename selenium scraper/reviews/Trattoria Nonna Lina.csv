Delicious Italian food,"Our 3rd visit here, and never disappointed. Fresh, generous portions. Pasta, meats, seafood; limoncello- all delicious"
Hearty Meal at an Italian Home,"Dining is an adventure that engages all senses. Part of the excitement is discovering new tastes and textures of food, and another part is like a mini travel to a new place and immersing oneself in it. And at Trattoria Nonna Lina, I get exactly what I'm looking for: enjoy a good unique meal at a place like no others in Singapore. Yes, the place feels like an Italian home, super cosy and full of personal touches.

Frittura di Calamari is served in very generous portion, perfect for sharing, but I have no problem finishing it by myself since deep fried squid rings are easy to bite. Tartar sauce is thick and creamy, more nuanced in flavours, going very well with the calamari.

But the real highlight is the arrabbiate sauce, yes, that red sauce. I seldom get arrabbiate sauce served with calamari at other Italian restaurants, so this is quite a new experience, and a good experience at that. With tomatoes as base, this sauce has the refreshing tangy taste that balances well with the seafood flavour of the squid. What makes this sauce special is spicy element from the garlic and red chilli peppers that really kicks things up a notch.

I never knew just chopped tomatoes with herbs and spices on bread can be so good until I have them here at this restaurant. Definitely another unique experience and the spread being handmade really gives that homely feel. The toasted aroma of bread accentuated by the zest of the tomatoes and the pungent flavours of the herbs + spices. The refreshing juices of the tomatoes also goes very well with the crunchy, crispy texture of the toasted bread. This is so good. I also like the pretty tongs that come with the bread and also the calamari, giving that ""Come help yourself to these treats"" vibe.

Lots of Italian restaurants serve spaghetti but not many serve gnocchi. And this restaurant is one of the few that do. Actually I love gnocchi due to its slightly chewy texture of potato starch. So when I see Gnocchi Mare e Monti on the menu, I immediately order this. Again, this dish has that homely feel where the chef adds in lots of goodies such as large prawns, smoked pork jowl, porcini mushrooms and special secret spicy sauce, which is like wanting the family enjoying a yummy and nutritious meal. I also love this dish a lot. It is so full of flavours and the spicy flavour makes the taste exciting.

Panna Cotta comes in pretty generous portion. The milk pudding is full of milky goodness and is of perfect consistency, being soft and jiggly smooth. The alcohol within adds a kick and refreshing taste to the milk. A very nice dessert to complete the meal with.
Checkered tablecloth, Italian memorabilia and collectibles, quirky quotes and Italian posters, this place is full of personal touches and really feels like a cosy, rustic, comfy Italian home. The service is very welcoming. The young service staff is very efficient, friendly, knowledgable and quick to response to requests. One special noteworthy gesture is that he straightaway pull out a chair to place beside me to put my bags. That's so thoughtful! the Italian guy will serve the dishes with lots of gusto, livening up the atmosphere to make it feel like, well, a home gathering.

Dining here is an experience like no others. This place is definitely worth a trip for that unique experience and the good food, of course.

Thoughts: Loving the Heart-warming Homemade Food here!"
Best Ever Gnocchi Gorgonzola,"Came here for dinner with a friend and we experienced the best Italian food restaurant in Singapore and with the tastiest and most irresistible Gnocchi Gorgonzola dish ever. We also had other classic and typical Tuscan dishes that were magnificent, like the ""poor man dish"" tribe - just wonderful. Not to mention the home made Tiramisu - to die for!
Tuscan food is undeniably delicious - and the ambiance and vibe of Trattoria Nonna Line is top rate too. Will for sure be back - SOON!"
Brilliant restaurant,"If you are visiting Singapore then this is a must place to eat. Run by two brothers - one is the chef and one is the maitre d'. Food is outstanding and not expensive. Wine list is vast, not expensive and great wines - as we found out!!! Will visit again in a heartbeat. The only problem we had is that we found it too late in our journey and couldn't return!! Thx to all."
delicious,food is scrumptious and waiter come strait away i like the beef the best the spaghetti is very nice too
Authentic Italian Cuisines,"food is perfect, but its quite pricey if you order the steak. The ambiance of the restaurant is very italian trattoria."
"Excellent service, spectacular food",Third time I’ve been back and it’s superb as always. Food is very worth it and true to it’s Italian heritage. A must try if you love Italy
Fabulous,I think it was one of the loveliest pasta places that I’ve been in Singapore so far. Food was lovely and I totally recommend it.
Truly italian!,Both the food and service were excellent though a tad pricey but definitely worth it! Food also arrived pretty quick! Would highly recommend!
Excellent!!,Excellent food and wine The staff is friendly Will visit again Will also recommend to my friends and family
Perfection,"It was nothing short of spectacular and perfection - we had been searching for our go to Italian restaurant for a long time and so glad to have chanced upon this gem! The decor is cute and cosy, makes you feel like you’re in Italy + food quality is amazing with generous portions. The bill comes out to the same place as if you dine elsewhere but this is SO much better!

Not sure about why others gave bad reviews on service as everyone in the restaurant were friendly and accommodating to all the guests on a busy Friday evening.

Would give 6 stars if I could! We will be back soon and often!"
Will be back,"Good food and service, and the place was really clean and nostalgic. Loved the story/ intro to the restaurant which is written on the first page of the menu. Felt cosy!"
Food is very good,"cosy and nice ambience to dine in. We had the burrata, bruschetta, meat platter and crab meat pasta. Everything was on point. Very decent dinner."
A corner of Italy in Singapore with authentic Italian cuisine,"From the typical Italian trattoria decor to the menu and the food itself, a truly authentic Italian experience. Excellent service, atmosphere and food!"
Marvellous,Enjoyed my Birthday Celebration at Nonna Lina. Feels very much cosy and at home. Food was tasty and I ordered Carbonara di Mare and smoky bacon enhanced the flavour. Lamb rack is never on my list but I thought let's give it a try and never regretted my bold choice. Perfectly done with great fragrance and tasty.
Usually reserve this hotel for last evening of Singapore Business trips,Restaurant came recommended by friends and is one of the best Italian restaurants I've eaten in anywhere. Food and service is excellent. Looking forward to next SG trip so I can experience once more.
A hidden gem where you feel at home,"We had a great experience at Trattoria Nonna Lina. Loved the decor, the fresh ingredients, authentic and delicious cooking. Highly recommend the clams and mussels for starter, the tagliatelle with tomato and beef sauce and their chocolate rum pudding. A place where we’ll return again and again. :)"
Excellent food in a small cozy restaurant,"Love this place so much. Excellent food, great service and a very nice ambience. Pity no music is allowed due to the restrictions or it would have been perfect. Highly recommend the grilled seafood. Came in a mix of crayfish, prawns, scallops, squid and vegetables - all grilled to excellence.
Maybe one tip for the restaurant is to tone down the spotlights as it can be a little glaring.

I would definitely be come back."
Fave Italian Place in SG,"3rd time visiting this place in a span of 6 months coz the pasta is just soooo good. I love the homely feel of the restaurant as well. This place reminds me of my trip to Italy with the vibes of the restaurant and the taste of the food. Service is great as well.

will definitely go back again. and again. and again. PREGO!"
Definitely worth a visit!,Nice and lovely place with great food and great ambience! Such wonderful and friendly staff members. The pastas are a must try!
A bit of Italy since we can't travel,"Since we're all trapped in sg now, been on a gourmet exploration trip around the country and I must say this restaurant is one of the best we've had. It's such a wonderful experience! The warmth and the atmosphere and the passion and the food - it was like we were back in Italy. Not a surprise when I peeked into the kitchen and saw the chef, he and another guy (who was so polite while serving us) speaking in Italian. AND THE FOOD. Dear god. I never had pasta this good. Seafood carbonara was such a rare sight (or rather, ive never seen that combo b4) and it was gobsmacking delish. It's as Italian and legit as you can get. Will revisit again!"
Mamma Mia! Loved it!,"Like an authentic little Italian restaurant with great food and service. Fresh made pasta and the Italian duo - front of the house and in kitchen, with exceptional warm hospitality makes this place a must visit for all Italian food lovers."
Good but not great,"It's a quaint little restaurant, styled very much like an authentic Italian trattoria.
The menu looks good & has some very unusual traditional Italian dishes.
Sadly the service was sorely lacking as we had to chase for water & then bread on arrival & every subsequent request required us to chase for service.
The food was good, but not great, which was disappointing considering the high prices. And the wine list is hugely over priced.
As someone who has lived in Italy & loves Italian food I was excited to try this place but ultimately disappointed by high prices coupled with food & service that was okay, but not exellent."
Home cooked brilliance,"Great food and service, decent wine list. I’d def visit again but in the evening, we had gone at lunch previously and were the only cover. Great we had the place to ourselves but lacks atmosphere."
"Authentic, Handmade Pasta, and Hospitality!","Very authentic, freshly made pasta and most importantly the host is the epitome of hospitality. We had a bad experience from another restaurant and stumbled across this Italian gem!

1) Even though it was fully booked, he was flexible to move things around to squeeze us in. (A lot of places would’ve just turned us away)

2) White truffle fresh pasta was one of the best found in Singapore.

3) I had ordered Gorgonzola pasta, and found it did not suit my taste (totally my problem) but the host graciously changed it and cancelled it off the bill and said it’s okay, next time I will know i don’t like that type of cheese! That is what you call hospitality, which is extremely rare these days.

4) Homemade Tiramisu is heavenly!

Definitely made our day, and will come back again in a heartbeat"
Excellent food and dining experience,"Went to TNL for a birthday celebration. Totally enjoyed the warm service, ambient and awesome food. Surprised by a free cake on the house."
Feeling at home,"Every time I enter in this family owned restaurant I feel in my homeland in Italy. Authentic and delicious Italian Dishes prepared with absolute care and premium ingredients , friendliness and the courtesy of the staff completed an overall positive experience during my lunch there.
My favourite dish is mix grill with succulent tenderloin , pork sausage and lamb rack. Thank you guys!!!!!"
Truly authentic,No local flavor compromise . This little trattoria is truly Italian . Service was excellent and we had a wonderful birthday celebration with a tiramisu cake specially prepared by the chef and owner himself .
Slow cooked tripe....heavenly,"It's hardly an adequate gauge when one does a takeaway in the midst of the Singapore Circuit Breaker - but the tripe was heavenly...rich and luxurious (tender enough yet had texture) with a very more-ish sauce which I mopped up with some gorgeous pita bread...

Also got a spaghetti aglio olio which was perfect (sighhh)...

Carefully presented despite being encased in the takeaway boxes and a total treat!

Looking forward to eating on site, when it would be possible to share stuff including a dessert...."
Cozy and Yummy,"Home style Italian cooking

Superb!

Place looks a little run down but it’s not a big deal.

Service was great!

Ordered the homemade parpadelle, requested to it to be a vegetarian dish. Pasta was a little too overdone but the taste was superb.
We usually prefer ours al dente.

The fish was perfectly done. Even the veggies and tomatoes were delicious."
Yummy seafood stuff and starters.,"Wow the service was awesome, the staff are engaging and fun. Food is superb. Ordered spaghetti, ravioli, cream mussel and clam. Moscato was also very nice. Had a great experience. Very nice ambience too. Highly recommended."
It was great,We love Nonna Lina. The food is consistently great and the hosts are always super friendly. It’s our favourite Italian in Singapore
Quiet Place for Catching Up w Friends!,"We ordered a bottle of red house wine, Squids ink risotto, a crab meat linguine and also a slice of pistachios cake & everything was delicious! Tho we feel that the crab meat linguine can be less “dry” (due to the cheese). Will definitely come back to try other food! :)"
Best Italian food in SG,"Love all the dishes from Chef Simone, especially the seafood ones. So good. The staff are friendly as well."
Needs more heart,"We liked Nonna Lina.

Good food, good portions, good wine and cozy vibe

We were regulars, visiting at least once a month.

One day we came in (I think it could have been in May but I can’t really remember), and we asked before ordering if we could buy Chope vouchers - because we forgot to do the usual buying beforehand.

They allowed us to do it after some back and forth with the staff saying that “pls don’t do it again, it is a one-off”.

Nothing unreasonable on their part, we should be grateful they allowed it. But given how we are regulars they clearly recognize, was shocked by the coldness.

We never returned thereafter: good food options are aplenty, but... regular customers would appreciate a relationship that is less transactional."
Awesome,"Awesome. Super nice people, food was brilliant and a great variety to choose from, definitely going back. Look forward to our next visit"
Great dining experience for the family!,"Trattoria Nonna Lina is charming, cozy and authentic. Needless to say, we felt right at home. Not only is the food delicious ... Chef Simone went the extra mile to offer more than what we saw on the menu, to make it a delightful experience for us.

We'll definitely be back for more."
Best Italian restaurant in Singapore!,The dinner was over all expectations! Recommending the lasagna starter. Chef Simon was a joy and service was excellent. I am definitely coming back. -Helene and family
Great evening!,We had a great evening at Nonna Lina. The food was amazing and we loved the italian brothers! We will be back for sure!
The place in Singapore,"The Place

A Toscanaccio (Hardcore Tuscan) restaurant. The owner- cook- entertainer Simone, is indeed a character: lively, loud and predisposed to chatter, like the Restaurant Manager Francesco on the other hand, whom I later discovered to be the brother.

Small restaurant, perhaps 15 tables, very welcoming, reminiscent of the sea. Kinda cosy!

Well-stocked wine list and also good choice of artisan/craft beers (Otus)!!! Finally an Italian restaurant that doesn't offer Nastro Azzurroo or Peroni!!! I had a beer first (Otus IPA) along with a Bruschetta and then we went for Valpolicella (Zyme 2013)

Value for money: honest, in the sense that the place is not cheap, but the quality of the food and the spontaneity of the management make the price just right..



The Food Experience:

Since I'm from Milan, talking to Chef Simone, he proposed me a Cotoletta alla Milanese (Milanese cutlet). Well to be more precise: he dared offering me the famous Orecchia d’Elefante (Elephant Ear, this is how we call the authentic Cotoletta alla Milanese in Milan, it is basically the one with long bone coming out of it).

I was like, wait what? A Toscanaccio guy, from the Argentario, that proposes me an Elephant Ear? Ok let’s see, let’s go for it

Right after my choice I turned doubtful: all dishes people were having around me looked delicious (Tagliolini with Lobster, Ribeye Tomahawk) and people seemed to enjoy them very much, and I had chosen a dish not from Tuscany!

Result? Well, I was just amazed! Thousands of miles from Italy, a guy from South Tuscany (seaside village), gave me one of the best Elephant Ear I ever had. No regrets at all!"
Perfecto!,"After 5 years, finally visited Trattoria Nonna Lina again! Hopefully Chef Simone recognized me~ From its humble abode at Tanjong Pagar to the Cantonment Road, one thing remains constant - the wonderful taste of Italian yumminess~"
Quaint restaurant with peaceful atmosphere,"Good italian restaurant at the corner of the shophouses stretch at outram, wasnt crowded and noisy, perfect for an evening out
Had the Zuppetta Argentarina(we cleared the sauce) and some homemade pasta mains.
However, felt that the tiramisu did not have enough rum for my personal liking."
Great lunch,"Visited for lunch. Great for a meeting as it’s very quiet. Ambience is homely but nothing special.

The set lunch menu is good value (38 for two courses) and has a great selection. Had the tenderloin for the main which was really good quality.

The a la carte menu though seems rather expensive compared to comparable Italian restaurants."
Loved it!,The arrabiata pasta was simply amazing! Proper homemade Italian food! The tiramisu was also really tasty! Would definitely recommend!
Delicious,"This is the second time I have dined here. The service is fast, friendly and efficient. The food is delicious - recommend the beef carpaccio, squid ink risotto , crab penne and gnocchi. The lemon sorbet with alcohol was divine. Will definitely visit again."
The best Italian in town!!,"Almost perfect score except the service! The waitress should have more attentive and change the plate before main course! They would deserve 5 stars! Probably one the best Italian I have had in Spore. So authentic Italian Italian cooking. From the appetisers of burrata cheese and ham, the mussels and clam in white wine sauce, mussels cooked in creamy truffle and mushroom sauce is a must to try. Lots of varieties of pastas flavour , ordered penne crab meat with light tomato cream sauce, the seasonal seafood with Italian fish roe and white wine sauce - the best ! It comes with 2 large prawns and is tasty. The squid ink risotto with 2 large prawns is very different! The mix grilled meats with combination of beef tenderloin , lamb rack and pork sausage are perfectly grilled.. finish with lava cake with pistachio ice cream! The house pour wine is reasonable price at $65 to enjoy very good blended Italian wine ... the price is not cheap but worth paying for the quality of the food. The Chef is from Italian and probably understand the Italian food authenticity! Superb and enjoy my lovely Italian dinner !!"
Great Italian food!,The gnocchi was excellent! Loved the generous amount of Truffle! We enjoyed the salad and cheese too.
Great Hangout with excellent service and value,Great location for a quiet afternoon (at the time of writing) chilled lunch. Homely atmosphere like Grandma Lina's kitchen.
We love Nonnas,We love the authenticity of Nonnas. The food quality and presentation is much better than trendier restaurants
Very very good,"This was a dinner on a Friday evening with good friends and they had recommended this place, which is located very near Chinatown. The place wasn't crowded whenever we arrived at 7.30pm, which suited us perfectly as we wanted a less noisy environment to catch up.

Ambience was comfortable and service was very prompt and friendly. We ordered the Florentine steak to share and they so very accommodating by cooking half of it medium rare and the other half medium well to please us.

The penne Al granchio and pappardelle pastas were also very good. Accompanied by a superb red from Tuscany and we had no room left for dessert unfortunately.

Although pricy given the neighbourhood we would return on special occasions and when we have guests in town."
Great food and wine for a lovely and casual date night,"My husband comes from the food industry and I am a lawyer; we are also parents so we only get to go out together once in a while -- so we want whatever we do have out to be DELICIOUS -- and nowadays we tend to choose comfort food made with care over fussy cuisine as we've eaten out at many top restaurants all over the world over the years. The seasonal seafood pasta for two persons absolutely hit the spot. The aluminium pouch it came in was opened up in front of us at the table and it was steamingly chock full of mussels, lobster, prawns, clams and squid in a lovely tomato-y broth with al dente pasta. The mixed grill was a very generous portion -- enough for the two of us -- and had barolo-marinated meats and Italian sausage cooked to perfection. Even the roast potato was super lovely. The house Tuscan wine was excellent value and went perfectly with our meal. Highly recommend."
Excellent food and nice service!,Second time to this restaurant! The food remained the excellent standard! Surely will visit this again!
Birthday celebration,"Very good Italian restaurant. Cosy ambient n satisfying taste. Must try the tenderloin, pastas & their many other dishes."
The best,"This is the best Italian food in Singapore. Completely authentic because it’s run by an Italian family so they know what they are doing - my seafood spaghetti was divine - cooked from scratch using fresh tomatoes, not the tinned ones you get in lease places . The set lunch is a good way to sample their menu. I will become a regular visitor!"
Best Italian Food,"Very nice and cozy environment, with 'nonna' style of Italian home cooking, very good services and tasty food, our fav Italian place"
Awesome Italian tiramisu,"Love the homemade tiramisu, taste like what I previously enjoyed back in Italy. The beef pasta is great too. Price is bit expensive especially for drinks, otherwise will be perfect."
Great French Good. Cozy dinner place for business dinner n Lovers' Date,Cozy place. Good n attentive service. Great French Food. Will come back agaim. Order their steak..seafood/clams/cod fish/squids.
"Disappointing experience, go somewhere else","The moment we entered the restaurant an impolite chef greeted us, asking if we had a resvervation ( wandering around the restaurant was empty! ) we asked him if we need one since there is nobody, he asked us to seat and order fast as they were closing, was dumbfounded by his attitude. After seating we noticed some people coming for lunch as well, nobody asked them for reservations, I guess is the way this chef is treating the guests. The food is ok nothing special, classic italian food can be found anywere in Singapore. Definately wont go back."
A small corner of Tuscany in Singapore,"When I crave for authentic Italian food there only one place where I go and is Trattoria Nonna Lina. Authentic Italian food with a grandmother touch that makes the overall experience as memorable.
A generous menu with all the typical Tuscany dishes and an extremely complete choice of the best wine of the Italian region.
Service is always extremely friendly and you always feel at home.
My personal suggestion is to try their signature meat with original gorgonzola sauce. Just amazing.
the kindness of chef Simone and manager Francesco is the culmination of a great food experience.
To try (and try again and again)"
Excellent Experience,"As soon as I stepped I have found a cozy environment and warm welcome.
I immediately found myself at ease with a staff always polite and ready to fulfill every customer request. Excellent food , high quality and clean . A ""must try"" is the mix grill with juicy chicken , beef and sausage. Price/service + food ratio is very good.
It is definitely a place where you feel at home where every detail is taken care of.
See you again!!!!!

Paolo"
Excellent choice !,Do not miss this true Italian place in Singapore. Great food. Amazing staff. Nice place. Lovely experience. We will come again.
real italian food,"Real italian cooking!
my wife and I went here for our anniversary, and ordered steak, a pasta dish and to start with we shared a cheese and parma ham dish (sorry i forgot the exact name of the dish we ordered)
The best thing about this place is that it is not pretentious, and has true italian flavors. The place is small enough so that each table gets good service as well. You can really tell the chefs brigade loves their work!
The best italian restaurant in SG."
Solid food,"Solid food- nice, authentic Italian which manages to surprise. Has great wine options to accompany the good food. Overall nice ambience and ok service. Have revisited several times:)"
Scrumptious Italian food in SCP.,"Trattoria Nonna Lina
Located at 61 Cantonment Road, Singapore. . Banking on Tuscan heritage flavours, Nonna Lina serves up a menu of Tuscan classics augmented with pan-Italian favourites of appetizers, pastas, fish, meats and desserts. All dishes are served to the table were, scrumptious, some of the tastiest Italian food I've eaten in SGP. Would highly recommend Trattoria Nonna Lina to any-one who enjoys great Italian food & hospitality at fantastic value. For the Staff very attentive, professional and friendly, absolutely faultless. The prices are definitely high, but I guess that is the way in Singapore everything is quite inflated. However with such an exquisite experience we are looking forward to going back soon."
Hidden Gem.,Classic Italian food and great service. They have gluten free pasta as well. The only downside is how quiet they are which is surprising given how great the food is. We’d definitely go back. This restaurant is good for date nights or group dinner.
Great soup and salmon main,We took the Lunch menu. Starter with a clear seafood soup which was fantastic. Followed by the main I chosen was salmon and was very well done with great taste. The dessert was tiramisu and I loved it. My sister had the lava cake which I think is second best. Overall nice place to visit and great food. Will try the pizza next time.
Delicious fine Italian dining cannot be missed,Really enjoyed all the dishes from appetizers to desserts:D Great dining experience with friends in a cosy n conducive environment for catch up n hearty conversation. I find it's a really welcoming atmosphere and would certainly love to return with friends to try on their other dishes too!
Highly recommend,Had a great time on Christmas eve. Simply love this cosy restaurant. The food was delicious (enjoyed so much from starter all the way to desserts) with great portions. Wine taste so so great🍷🥂 Go experience yourself😘. Will definitely return!!!
Friends gathering & party time,I love the food and desserts that serves in this restaurabt Though can't remember the menu of them which i always cant ..but the taste of them still deep in my mouth heart. Good ambient too for gathering with friends Oh.. the wines ..wonderful selection for us . Will certainly be back to the restaurant again & again
Spectacular!!,Visited Nonna Lina for the 1st time last night. Service was great and food was spectacular. It’s not cheap but worth every bit of quality. This is the best Italian in SG and one of the best restaurants in town. Can’t recommend it enough!
Best Italian Restaurant in Singapore,"I have been to many Italian restaurants in Singapore but this one was hands down the best! You don't need to travel to Florence for Florentine steak, Nonna Lina's Bistecca alla Fiorentina is even better than the ones I had in Florence!! My Friend and I really had an amazing amazing dinner! Grandissimo!"
Authentic and great food,Great food and good dish size. Raviolis were excellent. Good ingredients come with a price. Well worth it.
One of the best restaurants in SG,"Visited this place for the 4th time tonight. Service is always great and food is always spectacular. It’s not cheap but worth every bit of quality. My friends all agree this is the best Italian in SG and one of the best restaurants in town. Can’t recommend enough, would say make sure to save room for tiramisu - you’ll like the plate (I did)."
Sorry Nonna Lina - Not the best of experience,"I went to the restaurant with high expectations and have had the intention to visit for some years now...finally the day came and I left quite disappointed. Not that the food is bad, but neither was it is very very good - which was what I was expecting, given the reviews and the price you pay. The pasta texture was good, and the tiramisu was really really good - but that was all I can state of the food...sorry...

Service wise, nothing to be wow'd about. The Italian's service was lukewarm (there was only one other table occupied) and he seemed more concerned about being behind the counter then at the table, the Asian-looking guy (sorry, I did not get both names) was much more attentive - thank you.

Would I return? Probably not, but if I am in the area and craving for Italian, I don't mind giving it another go..."
Italian homely dishes,"Tastes authentic, but the price can be rather steep. Cheese baked eggplant is to die for. Spaghetti was a little hard – not sure if undercooked or al dente, hope its the latter. Overall pleasant dining experience though I would only go back if on days I feel richer!"
Flavoursome Italian food in a relaxed setting,"We came with a friend having not eaten Italian food for several months.
As we used to frequent the now closed ""In Italy"" previously, we didn't know what to expect despite reading reviews.

Between the 3 of us, we ordered Parpadelle, Gnocchi and a Risotto.
The homemade pappardelle with Italian sausages in creamy gorgonzola sauce was a great start, it was just so easy to eat.
Next was the handmade potato dumplings with prawns, clams and pine nuts, this was also a hit as everyone likes seafood and all the flavours combined so well to make this a refreshing pasta dish.

The risotto was probably the third ranked of the 3 but was still delicious nevertheless. The Italian name is Risotto al Nero di Seppia - Italian rice with mixed seafood in squid ink and this was worth the black teeth at the end.

Would happily return to try the other offerings and it also helped the service was friendly and efficient."
An Excellent Dinner!,"I've heard great reviews about this restaurant, and I was not disappointed! The portions are generous and the service was great. The seafood pasta with truffles was out of this world! I enjoyed the meal completely! We were too full to contemplate dessert."
Continue to improve,We are frequent visitors to this restaurant. The best valued Italian restaurant in town and they do not stop to improve their menu and their culinary presentation of each dish.
"EXCELLENT FOOD, SERVICE AND AMBIENCE","This is my husband's favorite restaurant that has become my absolute favourite. We make it a point to come here every once or twice a month to reminisce our first dating moments. The food has never failed us especially the bruschetta. THE MUST TRYS ARE:- mushroom and eggplant rissotto, bruschetta, seafood soup (to share), pepperdelle, chicken dish, calamari (to share), PANNACOTTA (musttttt) or the pistachio lava cake fantastic meal. The staff are so friendly and very fast. Despite only being one main chef if i am not wrong we got our food in a reasonable time although during peak. MUST MAKE RESERVATIONS."
Tasty food and great service,Surprising tasty and authentic Italian dishes and great service. Worth many visits. Only flip side is the difficulty to get parking.....
Trattoria Nonna Lina Dinner,"Welcomed with reservation. Services are excellent, polite and helpful. Food are tasty, fresh and well prepared. Making conversations are good with relaxing atmosphere."
Pasta,"I was there fews week ago,had some pasta and starter,was ok,traditional Italian trattoria,if I pass by I'll try again"
Cosy quaint italian diner,"This place will always be my special go-to italian restaurant when i need to bring close friends and food business clients. Cosy, quaint and such good and heartwarming italian meals."
Excellent service and food,"The service was great and the chef actually came out to serve the guests whenever he could. Price is quite on the high side but overall, nice food except that the squid ink pasta was more salty than usual for us."
Simply delicious!,"While in Singapore on a short trip, I found this restaurant and have eaten here three times in 8 days. I haven't eaten Italian food this delicious since visiting Italy several years ago. The food is authentic and not to be missed! If you have room after your main course, try the tiramisu - it's perfect! The staff, chef and owner are very friendly and take the time to come to my table for good conversation. If you haven't been here yet, you've got to try it!"
Superb quality of food,"We came here a week ago with my family and kids. The food was super fantastic that really fulfilled our hungry tummy great ambiance and service which can easily approach....my kids very love the stracchino which they serve with cooked ham! Planning to visit once again soon for the new spag aglio olio with anchovies which is recommended by a good friend can't wait to try that one soon....
Forza"
"Quality Italian food, but pricey with sub-par atmosphere","This Italian restaurant serves Quality Italian food, but pricey with sub-par atmosphere. Do not expect a quiet and romantic place as the place is filled with a loud and noisy crowd. Expect long waiting times for your food, waited ~1 hour before our mains were served."
Awesome eggplant risotto,Went to Nonna Lina to celebrate a friend's birthday. We had a pretty big group. They were kind to accommodate a cake we brought and served it on a turntable to a birthday song over the sound system. Great surprise! They also served the cake for us. It was a great meal - the eggplant risotto was the best. Bottarga was pretty good too.
Great for family,"Came on a wednesday evening with family. The food was excellent, especially the burrata and cartoccio. The trippa (cow stomach) is also fantastic, provided you're a bit more adventurous with your gastronomy!.Service was good too, as long as you respect the food. Will definitely come again!"
Excellent food that never disappoints,"We came by on Friday evening and this was totally unexpected. We didn't have a reservation and was half expecting to be turned away but thankfully the guys gave us a small table. It was pretty packed that Friday evening and it did get a little noisy due to the mainly local crowd so it wasn't exactly a romantic date night.

We had the lobster linguine and the gnocchi with truffles. Both excellently done. The linguine came with a whole lobster and had so much meat in it. The gnocchi came with a generous amount of shaved truffles and just tasted heavenly. We paired it with a moscato but looking back, a nice sharp Shiraz would have complimented the meal better.

Reasonably priced and one of the few places you'll get genuine Italian food that gives you that home made feel to it."
A gem!,"Unpretentious and classic Italian dishes you will be able to find here. Pasta and the seafood stew are the best in town. No fancy plating, this place just allows for the food to speak for themselves. The kind of food that makes you feel that you can eat it again and again. So if you really don't want to miss the food in this restaurant too much, I would suggest you not come."
Very good.,The kitchen is beside so can smell the food cooking before serving. Honestly I don't mind it as it feels like home cook Italian meal which I enjoy very much. But picky people will mind the smell. Hope that the starters are way cheaper but too bad it is right at a high rent place which I understand. Really enjoy the food :)
Homely Italian Dinner,"The food here is excellent. This small Italian is down to earth. Nothing fancy or pretentious, and it doesn't have to be. The food speaks for itself. The specials included a dish with ham and cheese, soft, milky, full of flavour. And that was just the appetiser. Honest good food."
Good food & Big portions,"Love the calamari and buffalo cheese with parma ham! Squid ink risotto was nice too! Nice family restaurant, great environment and happy with the service."

Cozy Italian fare in Singapore,"Very homey atmosphere with terrific food and attentive staff. Despite it being a busy night, the chef came out briefly to chat and ask about our meal. Starters are enormous and delicious - the calamari were more dusted than breaded allowing the flavor to shine through and big enough to share with the table; the mussels and clams in a superb broth with homemade bread are terrific as was a burrata appetizer. The fisherman's soup could be a little soupier but the fish fillet was amazing. The homemade pastas are very authentic. It's a small restaurant but when crowded can be a tad noisy. But it's a lovely place to unwind and settle in with friends; there's no sense of being rushed; the owners want you to feel at home. It's not cheap but the quality of the food is very high so it's good value. With wine and dessert, our table of 6 adults spent around $125 per person."
"Welcoming, authentic Italian","We tried Trattoria Nonna for lunch as we were looking for an authentic, homestyle Italian restaurant. From the welcoming reminder text message to the warm service, we felt like guests in someone's home. And to an extent that's what Nonna (Italian for grandmother) is all about. Nonnas own recipes made and served with love in the restaurant.

The food was good value with generous serving sizes and very fresh - there don't seem to be any corners being cut in terms of preparation. Fresh crusty bread had good chewiness and the complimentary bruschetta was a well seasoned ripe tomato and EV olive oil fusion.

The seafood stew was something you rarely see on menus, and was a hearty mix of mostly shellfish, very tender and fresh in a thick and richly flavoursome napoli sauce. My colleagues were very satisfied with the whole lobster linguine (not for the fainthearted of appetite! ) and the lamb cutlet/sausage combination. The dessert-lover swooned over the home-made tiramisu (again a fairly decent portion) and the cheese selection was adequately sized but would benefit from some Italian hard rind inclusions.

The wine list is extensive with a good range from $70 upwards and plenty of Italian as you would expect. The menu overall was very traditional as we hoped, but probably a bit too long - it would benefit from some focus. The specials should be written down or on a blackboard for reference.

We will be back, probably to try the $45 set three course which looks like very good value."
Great italian food at reasonable prices. Try before the rest of Singapore catches on.,I have been to this restaurant several times. Great flavourful italian cuisines without being pretentious. Great service too.
Lovely food!!!,"If you're looking for something different from the regular Italian fare, this place is for you! Love the lobster linguine and the fish with Parma ham and uni sauce"
