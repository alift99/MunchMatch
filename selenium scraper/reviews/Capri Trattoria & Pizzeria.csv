Excellent,The food and service was great. The staff is very at tentative to their guests and their kids. Reservation was a breeze and the restaurant even checked up front whether kid‚Äôs seat were required. Highly recommend!
Amazing food and excellent service!,Strongly recommend the place - the scallops and mushrooms AND the aglio olio AND the al granchio are to die for. Amazing service too!
Wonderful evening!,"What a pleasant evening we had. Good food and wine, excellent hospitality and service! We didn't catch the name of the gentleman who served us but he certainly made our day! He provided good advice and recommendations on food and was extremely attentive throughout our dinner, making sure we are comfortable and we have everything we need. The boss is also extremely friendly and nice. We were given some Parma, on the house! We will definitely be back again soon!"
Excellent service Amazing food,"Had an opportunity to dine in at Capri second time with friends, it was a busy Sunday lunch but the server Mike was friendly good at giving recommendations and attentive to our table. Food was amazing, tried the Home made pasta in truffle cream sauce...simply delicious. This place has become our favorite restaurant to dine in."
Mysterious positive reviews,"Decor is sad looking. Ingredients were not fresh. Cooking was poor. The only redeeming factor is the friendly, hard working, single server in the restaurant. Are those recent positive reviews genuine?"
Food Amazing,"Good service,food Amazing& delicious I love the pizza tartufata and calzone .Also recommend salad insalata Di Capri,lava cake nice! highly recommend."
Cozy little place with great service,Had family dinner here with my hubby and 6 year old. Food is really nice! Service is really great and the service staff are warm and friendly! Very at ease and feel like having dinner in one‚Äôs own home! Cozy place!
Great Pasta n Pizza,Love the place. Great pasta and pizza. It was really good to see them still following the traditional home made pasta and traditional thin crust pizza. Keep up the great job Capri.
Hidden Gem in Bukit Timah,Bit of a hidden gem in Bukit Timah. Had never heard of it before visiting with work colleagues. Amazing and authentic Italian dishes. Wine list is incredible and worth being guided through by the staff to match to meals. Will definitely be back to try more of their dishes.
Italian restaurant at Binjai Park,"Visited Capri Trattoria recently after a long break. It‚Äôs a small cosy restaurant off Bukit Timah Road, in a residential area.

We had a spaghetti vongole and a calzone to share for two persons. The calzone was really hot - we could see steam hissing like some escaping gas as I cut the dough. Tasted well with the tomato sauce.

The spaghetti vongole was quite average.

The staff were friendly and overall an enjoyable meal."
Great view,The view is amazing. Nice open feel to the restaraunt. Food comes out quick and is yummy. Service was slow and just ok. But worth going for food and view.
great place for family,"The staff at Capri were attentive yet non-intrusive with refilling our cups with warm water, providing additional napkins and with replacing our plates for the next courses. When we arrived, our reserved table was already set with the high chair, cutlery and utensils that were required. The recommendations were good as well. We enjoyed the garlic tiger prawns and the calamari as starters. Because it is a pizzeria, we went full on and ordered 4. Our favourites were the 4 cheeses and the one with dried beef (which was phenomenal). We enjoyed the special which was the squid ink pasta. It was a well-flavoured but a tad salty. Desserts were a treat of tiramisu and the lava cake which all of us unanimously enjoyed, sans the child. Overall, we were glad we had our meal there!

Thank you to Capri staff and chef for making our meal such an enjoyable one!"
Excellent Italian food and great service,"Real gem, just off of Bukit Timah Rd. Real nice Italian pastas and pizzas. Have tried their vegetarian pizza, lasagna, and pasta, and each dish had its own unique taste. It is obvious they are using authentic ingredients and the chef knows what he is doing. On top of that, the lady who served us both the times (Oct 21 and Jan 22) is real nice. Highly recommended."
Delicious freshly made pasta with great service,We enjoyed the evening with great food and service. Highly recommended! Next time we‚Äôll be back for the lava cake.
One of the best Italians in Singapore,"Returning customers for over 7 years. One of the best pasta in Singapore. A real small gem, very friendly and attentive service and a wonderful atmosphere."
Could have been better,"Pork chops were over cooked and chewy, while the Pasta with Clams was a disappointment. Only pizza bread was delicious."
Best Lava Cake in Singapore!,"Was looking for stress reliever meal within the area and Capri Trattoria & Pizzeria came up and it didn't disappoint.

Had Pizza & Lobster Linguine for main, then we were recommended the Lava Cake for dessert, top that with Gelato Vaniglia, it's an awesome combo! I highly recommend this place."
Best Food Best Service,I went Capri with my family first time. The food was so good and service was excellent. vana was so good her service was excellent. Specially the pizza tartufata is so good. We will come back again
Horrible experience- Arrogant owner,"Terrible service and arrogant owner Ravi, who was violating COVID rules and when questioned said we could leave and yelled at us! Not going back there ever! Italian place run by Indians!"
Cozy place for dinning and friendly staff,Very cozy place for dinning.. the steak was great.. please order medium rare! The staff were very friendly and takes feedback constructively
Antipasto Trap,"If the waitress recommends an antipasti platter to start‚Ä¶ ask ‚Äúhow much‚Äù. 48$ for pizza bread, few cold cuts, mozzarella seems stiff?"
Wholesome and delicious Italian meal,"My family and I enjoyed our dinner at Capri.
The calamari was nicely done and the taste of the batter accompanying it tasted unique. Bruschetta and the burratta cheese were excellent as well. The pasta dishes were all done al dente; the way it should be. Though it‚Äôs a little pricey but it‚Äôs worth it. The service staff were also very attentive and food was served rather promptly though about 70%of the tables were filled."
"Amazing food, amazing service.","Pizzas were the best pizzas I‚Äôve ever tasted. The crew were also so friendly and nice. Place is romantic and cozy! Price is just fine too. If you are ever looking for a great pizza, this is the one that sells it."
Excellent tasting Italian food,"Our family enjoyed the experience, the food was great, the portions were great. Price was a bit on the high end though."
Great Pasta & Risotto dishes,"Mainly came here for the fantastic pizzas previously.
The pasta and risotto dishes were very delicious as well.
Nice ambience and impeccable customer service. Such a joy to dine here.
Recommended to make reservations (even on weekdays) - as I was turned away before trying to do a walk-in for dinner"
Highly Recommended !!!!!,"My first visit to this Italian restaurant. The atmosphere was great and their staff are very attentive, service was excellent. We ordered a starter Bufala Caprese, follow by a Scialatielli Pasta and Manzo. Everything we tried was amazing. I would say this is one of the best Italians restaurant in Singapore. Will definitely come back. Highly recommended!!!!"
Birthday,"Excellent food, wine, service and ambience. This was the 2nd time we are celebrating a loved ones birthday here. Highly recommended!"
Great place for Pizza üçï,"Went here today for lunch at around 1ish pm.

Ambience - very cozy and have the Italian vibes. Love it, though they have only tiny space for outdoor seats. Could‚Äôve been nice

Menu - great variety of dishes from appetiser, to salad, main course, and pizza. Along with drinks and desserts. Don‚Äôt have fresh juices though which we‚Äôre looking forward to order.

Quality of Food and Portion - we‚Äôve ordered
Pizza Diavola - my husband and I love the Pizza thought that the texture, the size, the thickness of the pizza was just perfect and taste was great. Recommended this one.

Scialatelli Di Capri - I personally didn‚Äôt like much the pasta itself. Was a bit disappointed how the pasta stuck together or being clumped. And the seafood didn‚Äôt taste fresh for some reason or perhaps it‚Äôs the sauce. Though the portion of the seafood I would say pretty generous.

Price - was okay. Above average price. But a great place for Italian place to explore or try. Would like to visit again and order other type of Pizza.

Overall was good experience"
Average quality Italian food. Fairly good service.,We were a group of four. We ordered two starters (both vegetarian) and we each ordered a separate main. The vegetables were well cooked but the olive oil and burrata were both grocery-store quality. My wife's pasta was overcooked. My risotto was well-made of average but not outstanding ingredients. Honestly we have better Italian food at home. For the price the food could have been better.
"A Must Stop By Eatery Outlet, Italian restaurant Base in Singapore.","A great dining place with promising good quality food serves to pleasure the hungry tummy. Welcomed in from the door step to your seat. Food is cooked upon order, eat it when its just out from oven. Pizza is handmade on the spot and freshly baked in the pizza chimney oven, so cool. And A MUST TRY, Flaming Lava Cake, Drizzled with orange liqueur. My all time Must Have when i dine in. A small cozy ambience to chill in. My meat, cooked medium rare, never went wrong. Will definetly come by again. Wen comes to tummy dont think about money."
Tortellini Truffle Burrata Pasta is amazing,"Always a good and satisfying meal here. One of the best Italian places in SG. Good pizza and great homemade pasta. Thank you, Capri and it‚Äôs a friendly team for a great dinner. Stay strong and we are looking forward to the dine-in time at your venue soon. Thank you Vana for your recommendation of special of the menu. The tortellini truffle burrata pasta was amazing. See u again next week."
5 STAR Lobster Pasta.,Been craving for the lobster pasta but with CB we are unable to dine at our favorite restaurant so decided to call in for take away. The pasta was so delicious and perfectly cooked to perfection. Thank you Capri Team for the amazing dinner and we can‚Äôt wait to be back to dine in very soon once CB is over.
Ordered risotto seafood and,"Ordered risotto seafood and risotto mushroom through grab. Fake Italian food. The seafood risotto became paella and the other one is like a mushroom rice. The rice is not even risotto. Lack of proper risotto was over compensated by too much mushroom. Not even close to basic risotto, let alone the authentic one. Not worth the price. Never ordering again! Yuck!!"
Great Dinner,"While strolling along Binjai Park me n my girl saw this Italian house n decided to have an early dinner...as we enter, the ambience n the welcome that we received was soooo comforting...we both shared a pizza n a wine each and later moved on to Capellini Pasta & Squid Ink Pasta respectively. The food was great coupled with the wonderful friendliness of the staffs is making me wanting to visit again. Our bill was slightly less than SGD100 but it was worth every penny. Keep up the good work guys...will surely make many more returns."
"Overpriced, mediocre food , lousy portion size with an extra large Attitude!",One of the overpriced singapore restaurants serving mediocre food .Not at all authentic. They charge 24 dollars for a portion of Gnocchi which had 5 exact peices (delivered thru deliveroo) and when I called asking about it they instied that they sent 6 pieces! This is an adult portion size and not kids menu.I lodged a complaint with deliveroo who refunded my money but never ever this lousy place again! Oh btw the food is horrible! Had to use the refund to reorder something else.
"Good atmosphere, excellent service and great pizza","I went for lunch with a friend of mine and we really enjoyed the food. We got gnocchi, scialatielli pizza and tiramisu. Everything was well prepared and taste like in Italy.
I really appreciate the kindness and the good service of the manager and the staff working there.
I will be back for sure."
Anniversary,"My husband brought me here after a long thought and YES! It was perfect for our anniversary. Simple yet Delicious! The ambience was right for both of us!
I don't fancy an expensive dinner when the food has no quality BUT this restaurant serves good quality of food which suits my palate! Don't forget their desserts!! An amazing dinner to end the night for us!"
Great romantic dinner,Went to capri last weekend with my fianc√©e for a romantic dinner. It was great. The food & the ambience is just right. We ordered burrata con prosciutto crudo & vellutata di funghi for starters. Tagliata di manzo & risotto con funghi for main. It's worth the price. The staffs was nice & helpful to reccomend us nice dishes. We enjoyed our night there. Definitely will go there again.
Birthday dinner,"Recently went to capri for dinner as it was my dad's birthday.. Everything is nice.. Authentic italian food.. I personally like the pizza bread,lasagne & ravioli caprese.. My dad liked the carppacio di manzo & calzone pizza.. Oh the spaghetti pesto gamberetti is to die for.. We loved all the food that we ordered.. The ambience at the restaurant was great too.. The staffs are nice & friendly.. For sure me & my family will come again.."
Quality has dropped,"This restaurant used to be our go to casual Italian place. They had a delicious seafood pasta and one of the best mushrooms risottos we've had.

Unfortunately, our dinner here recently was a bit of a disappointment.

Even though there was only one other table dining when we were seated, we waited nearly 40mins for our mains (2 plates of pasta), and the taste and quality has definitely dropped. The service also used to be a highlight with a Filipino gentleman being a lovely host, but the regular staff were no longer there this visit.

Our total bill for a shared starter, two pastas and two non alcoholic drinks was close to $100, which is expensive considering the poor quality."
"Expensive in price, mediocre in food quality!","The place is dated and is in need of a makeover. The lime juice is $6 per glass and taste like what we bought at NTUC drink section.
Vellutata di Funghi(mushroom soup) is freshly made but is on the high end for $15 per serving.
Impepata Di Vongole(clams in wine) $26 is not spectacular, just decent with few clams.
Fettuccine Alla Nocerina $28 and Linguine con Granchio $26 pasta are delicious. But we can get similarly good pasta at half the price elsewhere.
Tagliata Di Manzo(Ribeye steak)$38, i request for medium rare but is serve well done. Can hardly chew the tough meat. The meat taste just like what you paid for in a hawker center.
Overall I will say the place is overly price and serve mediocre food."
Great Service,"The service provided by Ms Verma was excellent. Her recommendations on the choice of food for my family of 5 was excellent. She even recommended the sequence of serving. Throughout our meal, she was very attentive, always a step ahead in anticipating our needs.

The good was exquisite and the portion, especially the T-bone was huge.

It was a little expensive but we came prepared for a good meal before the end of the year.

Forgot to thanks the Chef fur a wonderful meal and beautiful evening. Cheers"
Perfect Xmas lunch!,"Read the many positive reviews and I have to say....""Ditto to that!!"" Service is friendly and impeccable. Food....Yummers!

Who would have thought that turkey, brussel sprouts, roasted pumpkin, pomegranate and drizzle of balsamic vinegar would make the ultimate and tastiest pizza? Well, it absolutely was a slam dunk in my books! The Ravioli Caprese was excellent. My youngest thoroughly enjoyed the pizza bread and margherita pizza.

The star of the lunch....the whopping juicy 1kg T-bone grilled at medium to perfection!! A must order if you have at least 3 to share.

Thanks to all at the restaurant who made this a delightful xmas family lunch!! Cheers to you!"
Great food authentic Italian,"I was surprised to find the owners of Capri had left and worried the food would not be the same but we were not disappointed! The pizza bread to start was delicious as was the sausage pasta according to my son who is very fussy! Mushroom risotto was very flavourful and the red wine perfect, if a little cold! Thank you for bringing a sweet treat with a candle for my son‚Äôs 16th- we will be back!"
"Very good food, but pricey",Everything from appetizer to dessert is nice. But the appetizer platter is too ex! The lava cake is a must try!
Excellent service and great pizza,"My wife and I wanted to try out Capri as she had a craving for some traditional oven baked pizza and Capri did outstanding. Ravi, our host, was very attentive and absolutely helpful in helping us pick out food choices based on our preferences, and we saw him equally as helpful with the other guests as well. We had a really good monday evening here, and if I had to be nitpicky, I would say that the negroni I had could do with a touch less sugar. But other than that, a dinner date at Capri really is a good choice."
Quality food & homey feel,Authentic Italian restaurant nestled in a quiet residential estate. Low-key gem of a place for good food with close friends. Tried their calzone as it‚Äôs rare to find in Singapore. I generally prefer pastas and the menu has a sufficiently wide range of options. Their food is always yummy!
Go if you love waiting for your food!,"Had my son‚Äôs birthday dinner there on Saturday night and waited close to 40 mins for our food to come! The reason we were told by the waiter was we did not order appetisers. At time of ordering, the waiter did not inform that it was compulsory to order appetiser before main course and in fact the waiter did say it was a 15 minute wait for food to be served. And it was so incredibly noisy inside the restaurant when the tables were full that we could hardly hear each other talk. The food portion was very small for the price. Not ever going back to the restaurant again."
"Good food, Nice ambience",The mushroom truffle pizza was excellent! So was that day's special- seafood angel hair in prawn sauce. Service was prompt and good too!
Unpretentiously delicious,"Enjoyed a beautiful lunch here in this quaint trattoria. The food was genuinely delicious: from the antipasto to the pasta to the desserts. The wait staff were also knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. Will certainly be back when I want good Italian food!"
Quality of food was good,"Enjoyed the food very much. The quality and portion was good. However, the waiter was very impatient and rushed us into ordering quickly. He handed out the menu and came back every 30s for our food and wine order. We expressed displeasure and he backed off."
Delightful Lunch with Best Service,"First experience of trying out Italian dishes. The waiters are so well equip with knowledge of the cuisine and they could recommend food based on yr taste bud. The Manager , Mr Ravi was so friendly that he welcomes us and gave his suggestion on must try dishes ! The food here is so heavenly taste especially the pasta,lava cake and pork chop. Generous amount of seafood topped in pizza ! Definitely will return back ! A perfect place for celebration,eg : candle light dinner. You will never regret your visit here ."
Birthday party for my daughter,"We visited this cosy restaurant on my daughter‚Äôs birthday. We ordered the lasagna, fettuccine alla piemontese, pizza napoietana and calamari. The food was one of the best Italian food we have tasted. All of us said we‚Äôll come back again for sure. The service was also excellent. Kannan was friendly and made us feel at home in his restaurant. Thank you!"
Good food and friendly service,"We were going for Peranakan food at Binjai Park, but decided to detour due to the long queue. Chanced upon this South Italian pizzeria and decided to give it a try.

We enjoyed the pizzas though the servings of parma ham was deemed insufficient.

What was greatly satisfying is the fish soup with its rich broth and fresh seafood. So good that we ordered another Vongole in white wine sauce to savor the freshness of seafood here.

Service is super friendly and good ."
Enjoyable Dinner,Great place for quality food in a relaxed casual neighbourhood restaurant. Enjoyed the handmade pasta and homemade desserts. Friendly service.
Great food,"Came with my daughter today. Pizza, pasta and lava cake. All great and amazing taste. Recommend. Will try fiorentina steak next time!"
Velly lice,"Very nice place. Food was excellent, service superb, prices reasonable full of locals so it must be good"
Best Pasta thus far,Visited Capri a little under a week ago.! Blown away by the Fettucine Ala Piemontese and the Rib Eye steak which tasted like butter with a good bite. The Fettucine was creamy with white truffle shavings and so flavourful that I wolfed down the whole plate with ease!!!! Their Tiramisu was forgetable though!
Twice in a week!,"We've been here twice in a week as we loved the food and service.

The crab pasta is delicious (even though I usually prefer something a bit more creamy, this was a pleasant surprise!) and the mushroom risotto was amazing (probably the best we've had!) The only thing we've had on the menu that was disappointing was the tiramisu, which was a shame.

Otherwise, the service is always super friendly and welcoming, it does feel like going to a someone's place for dinner. The two gentlemen who are always there are very lovely, and the boss seems very hands on.

It's a little bit pricey for a neighbourhood cafe but the food and service do mostly make up for it."
Pasta nice pizza average,Overall pasta nice but pizza special menu not worth price for 28 dollar just average pizza nothing special. Burrata platter is good dessert ok. Price is on the step side for a neightbourhood restaurant.
Suburban Italian,"We (two) turned up on a Saturday evening, early but with no reservation. Luckily, we could find a table. We were looking for a light dinner, and pizza in particular, but we shared a burrata and prosciutto starter anyway. It's just as well that we shared, because it was huge: a plump burrata the size of a cream bun, surrounded by a large serving of prosciutto and arugula - as ample as it was delicious. Our pizzas, Neapolitano and classic Margerita both were good, but not outstanding. We drank an Aperol spritz (good) and a glass of house red (undistinguished). The place was crowed by the time we left, and I can understand why. In spite of the poor parking facilities, Capri offers good, standard Italian fare at reasonable prices, served cheerfully and promptly. I can imagine that it's the local diner of choice for many who live in the area."
Dinner,Fantastic hospitality from the boss! Great place to come if you want a comfortable setting with awesome italian food
worth another visit,Had high expectations given the reviews. Overall a very pleasant first visit. Service was very good. I'd have like the pasta cooked more al dente - it was a bit mushy. The disappointment was the bread. Although warm (big plus point) it was very dry. Nonetheless well worth another visit.
The worst T-bone steak and Pasta,"The T-bone was lousy and expensive at $168, it didn‚Äôt give me any kick at all. Even the cheaper steak at Tony Rama tasted much better than this.

The crab tomato based pasta has a strong sugar taste, the worst pasta I ever had. The Pizza was just ok. This will be my first and the last to be here."
Great homemade pastas,"Enjoyable place, chef is always kind to greet us at the table and suggest dishes. Scialatelli is a must, if you love pasta, especially homemade one, you must try this place."
Great food let down by poor service,Really nice food at reasonable prices. Evening was almost spoiled by very poor service until the restaurant owner‚Äôs son stepped in and redeemed the evening.
A lovely lunch at Trattoria Capri!,"We have been to this Italian Restaurant several times - it is time I write a review. Service was super good right from our entrance. This visit for for a simple lunch as I was under the weather for 2 days - for the past 2 days the smell of food gave me a nausea. But I landed up having a delicious meal today. There were 5 of us and we ordered Vellutata di Funghi, Bresaola della Casa, Brischetta, Pizza Tartufata, Insalata di rucola, Risotto ai fungi porcini for starters and main course. I had the Pizza Tartufata - that was deliciously made. Now with the Downtown line King Albert Park Station, this restaurant is easier to get to without a car."
Hearty authentic Italian food.,"Enough has been written about what Capri's like, so I'm gonna just focus on what I ate here. There's a lot of good Italian food available in Singapore, but I feel that Capri is one of those little gems that's a cut above the rest.

Pizza Tartufata - I'm usually more of a meaty pizza person, but this mushroom rendition is really good. Only grouse, and I'm nit picking here is that I would like it a little thinner, maybe a little more crispy. But that's a minor minor thing.

Fettuccine alla piemontese - To die for. I have to come back and eat this again.
So much pasta to try, so little stomach.

Cacciucco alla livornese - really really good tomato based seafood soup. So so tasty.
Might be a bit much for one person to finish, especially if you are having a main/pizza also, but it's a must must try."
Best pizza in Singapore,"Walked past Pizza Hut and had a hankering for pizza...decided we could spend a bit more than we would have in Pizza Hut and we had been meaning to go here for a while. The chef was clearly passionate about the food he prepared and was very eager to discuss with us. We both had pizzas and great homemade desserts. The pizzas were the best we‚Äôve had in Singapore, no contest!"
Classic and innovative Italian cuisine,"With the quantity of mainstream Italian restaurants we can find in Sing City, I was getting bored of their cuisine. I thought I had seen everything, tasted every main and wine there is in latin menus. I was proved wrong with Capri. Not only did I enjoy the versatility of the offer, but also its originality. You can taste traditional Pizza, Pasta or Risotto, which are all of top quality, but also enjoy regional mains you could only find in small Italian villages. Notable specialities include the Ndjua, a spicy and spreadable pork paste that is indigenous to Calabria in Southern Italy, and the Cacciucco alla Livornese, a typical Leghorn‚Äôs delicacy; a zesty fish stew with Mussels, Cod Fish, Clams, Squid, Crayfish and Mediterranean herbs served with croutons. I was pleased to be proved wrong in thinking Singapore had no more surprises to offer me, Thanks Capri for your unique dishes!"
Good Italian Food,Decided to have Italian this evening and did not want to travel far. So I decided to swing by Capri which was literally 5 minutes away. Ordered a pizza marinara (they did not have it on the menu but whipped it up for me nonetheless). Liked the crust and the also they were generous with the seafood ingredients. I also ordered the seafood soup - again I could not find it on the menu but I saw the soup being served on many tables! It was delicious - a thick tomato broth with lots of fresh seafood. It was so tasty that I kept dipping my bread in the soup!
Loved the food!,"By far the best Italian food I've had which is authentic and doesn't pinch the pocket. Had the pizza, mushroom risotto and penne arrabiata. Also loved the cherry panna cotta. Highly recommend it! It is definitely my new favourite. It's small, cosy and homely. The service is super and fast. Great ingredients and warm hospitality, it cannot get more Italian."
Couldn't have asked for a better evening..,"Followed up on a recommendation from a girlfriend, and dropped by Capri last night for dinner. We were met at the door, given excellent food recommendations, service was prompt and pleasant. We can feel the care given to the food prep and execution. We started off with scallops and button mushrooms, and couldn't help but smile when the dish arrived: the chef had reconstructed a mushroom using scallops and mushrooms. The sear on the scallops was perfect with just that bit of char flavor, and the mushroom was nice and juicy. A sprinkling of flavored breadcrumbs added a nice texture and smokiness to the dish.

There's something special about the way the mushrooms were prepared for the creamy porcini mushroom pasta because it melted in our mouths, but still had a bit of bite to it. We were intrigued, and polished off every, little bit of that dish. I have a soft-spot for stews, and was impressed with the fish stew served here. My BF also had lots of good things to say about it, and he is usually quite reserved with his comments. The stew was thick but not heavy, very comforting. Every bit of seafood in the stew was cooked just right. It is so nice to bite into a tender, juicy bit of seafood. I am certain all of us have had our share of chewing-gum like calamari! We rounded up our dinner with the chef‚Äôs recommendation of tiramisu and homemade lemon cake. Made with almond flour, the lemon cake was moist, and was all about the lemon flavor, minus the usual overwhelming, sourness from it. An easy favorite. Tiramisu was lovely too, but to me, it would have been perfect with a bit of liquor ;).

There's nothing shi-shi about Capri - it is a cosy neighborhood eatery, with pleasant service, serving absolutely amazing, well-made food. What really added to our experience was the interaction we had with the owner, the chef and the wait staff, talking about food, beer, wine, life experiences... Thank you for a great evening. We will be back for more food and banter :)."
Delicious Lemon cake,The lemon cake is one of the best I hv tried. The grilled cucumber & egg plant was good too. We also enjoyed the large ‚Äòpizza puff‚Äô
Came for the pizza and it didn't disappoint,Read about this restaurant in blog that spoke about it's authentic Italian pizza. I ordered a Verdure and it was yum! The beer (that came in bottle that looks like wine) was a perfect match for the food we ordered.
Real Italian pizza,Authentic Italian pizza with an amazing beer never tried before : ‚ÄúBirra artigianale Collesi‚Äù. The staff is very kind and the place is small but comfy. Strongly recommended.
Quality,"I have reviewed Capri before and given it the maximum stars possible - it really was a great place to have home cooked Italian food in Singapore in a relaxed jovial atmosphere.

I think it still is - but during my last visit, I found couple of items that were not up to their usually great standards.
On the positive side, they have expanded their menu with some new items and that‚Äôs always good news.
The not so good item for me was their baked egg and cheese with truffle oil appetiser. Their was no integration in the ingredients - I was just eating baked egg in one bite and then baked cheese in another. Also, the dish was over baked making the egg extremely dry in taste.
The next one is a matter of taste - my Wife found the dish delicious and fine, but I found it delicious and a bit salty(seafood squid ink ravioli)- I was less upset about this as the dish was definitely a great idea and the crabby stuffing of the ravioli was awesome.
Overall I think Capri is still one of the best Italian restaurants in SG, however, they should keep an eye on QC to retain their impeccable quality and taste.
Best,
Abhisek"
Sunday's lunch,"Amazing, outstanding, super!!! These are the 3 attributes to describe our sunday's lunch at Capri:pizza for starter was wonderful and later a fantastic risotto porcini, a delicious risotto agrumi, wonderful gnocchi and turbot fish...and finally a sweety tiramisu to a real happy end!!!...thks Fabrizio and Marco!!!"
Average Italian,"Came with high expectations but was let down. Only dish that stood out for me was the burrata with parma ham which came at a costly $40. My fish stew was very average and, for me, rather bland."
Fantastic dinner experience,Food quality was excellent and the service level by the owner and the servers were also very good. The restaurant has a nice cosy ambience which we enjoyed very much.
Good food good service,The food was good and came promptly.. Service was great.. Server was pleasant and awesome throughout.
felt like home,tranquility and ambiance of the place is superb! felt like i‚Äôm at home and the food is absolutely delicious!
A great Italian gourmet lunch,"Restaurant named after the enchanting island nestled in the Gulf of Naples. Cosy venue, friendly service, outstanding Italian cuisine featuring freshly homemade pastas and main courses from both Northern and Southern Italy. Wines are excellent but reasonably priced."
Nice Italian in Bukit Timah,It is a simple restaurant with warm ambiance. There is a touch of Italian authenticity here. We enjoy its pasta and pizza here. It offers a decent wine when you do not feel like having a bottle fro your table.
Very good Italian food,"This is my second time there. The first time was very good, this time was excellent. Some dishes are great, service is good and the Italian manager is very warm and nice. One of the best home made Italian food in Singapore for sure."
What a surprise,"Top restaurant even if it was in Italy. Great quality, simple but effective combinations. And, last but not least, fair prices (cheap for being in Singapore)."
Great ambiance!,"This restaurant is convenient and easy to access as it is a few bus stops away from King Albert Park MRT Station! Had the crab meat linguine and the seafood pizza which was great. The restaurant is not too big and there was a homey and great ambiance to it. However, service can be improved as servers could have been more cheerful and friendly to make the dining experience more pleasant. However, this is still a good place for couples, families and friends to dine at."
Average,Recommended for Family / Friends / Solo. Food: Very Good. Value: Average. Service: Average. Atmosphere: Average. Overall: Average.
A true Italian place!,"This restaurant is an Italian island in Singapore! Not only the food is very authentic Italian, but also the owner and his team. The atmosphere makes you feel like with friends and the food is more than delicious. The restaurant is not too big, but not too small - just nice for a dinner for two or a group lunch with friends or business partners. I can absolutely recommend Capri!"
Pasta with love,"Had the veal ravioli and truffle sausage tagliatelle, as well as some pizzas. All were done perfectly, especially the handmade pastas which were wonderfully al dente. The owner was also very friendly"
Excellent italian food!,Food is delicious! A little jewel gem in the neighbourhood setting. Had a great time with my friends.
An exciting family & friends Italian fiesta,"Last night I celebrated my wedding anniversary at Capri's.

My 15 guests and I, we were treated to a smosgarbord of Italian culinary delights freshly prepared a' la minute by the two Italian Chefs helming the culinary team: Mr Fabrizio Anzolin from Milano and Mr Marco de Cecco who hails the North-Eastern Italian region of Friuli Venezia Giulia.

This cosy and welcoming venue is located at a stone throw from King Albert Park MRT underground station and right close to a famous Singaporean historical landmark reminiscent of a bygone era: the World War II Bukit Timah Railroad.

Live North Atlantic Boston Bay lobsters are served with freshly homemade pasta, all sausages and most cold cuts such as the Northern Italian ""bresaola"" are entirely homemade while Chef Marco's citrus risotto with fresh prawns tartare was simply perfect.

Service was quick and attentive despite the huge crowd on in-dining regular guests and walk-in by-standers waiting for their own table.

Will definitely come back!!!!!"
Great meal and Lovely Service,"The restuarant is tucked in a small lane near Binjal lane. It‚Äôs family owned Italian restuarant. Restuarant decor was very much simple and gives the Italian ambience. Service was attentive and crowded on a Saturday evening. Book in advance but worth the wait.
We had Scamorza del fornaio as appetiser. It was smoked cheese baked in a crock with button mushroom, egg white, topped with Parma ham and a sprinkle of white truffle oil.
We ordered red wine by the glass.
For mains I had Fettuccine alla Piemontese
with cream, truffle sauce, porcini mushrooms and dried beef. This was simply delicious! My hubby kept picking at my dish. The mushroom was really good. They made their own dried beef cured for 3 months. The Truffle sauce really came together nicely with the pasta. Exquisite.
My hubby had the Linguine con granchio which is Linguine served with a delicate sauce of crabmeat in light tomato sauce. It was a simple dish but very well flavoured with plenty of crab meat and sauce. I also couldn‚Äôt help picking at his plate.
For dessert we took their recommendation and had Lava cake. This is their own homemade flaming chocolate cake with orange liquor. Get ready for some fire as when they serve it.The chocolate serving was rich and plenty, unlike most cakes that had flour , this was filled with chocolate.
We had a good chat with the family, such a lovely family with two sons. The owner came from Milan 25 years ago and settled here. We had the good luck of trying some Italian cognac.
Totally a lovely night and money well worth!"
One of my favorite Italian restaurants in Singapore,"The last time I wrote a review here was about 2 years ago, so I thought I should write another one.

Capri still consistently delivers the best Italian meal experiences that I've ever had in Singapore. Pretty much the entire menu has something special to offer and we've found it worth going out of one's comfort zone to try different things.

One thing you can say about Italians: they understand the quality of bread served, and the difference between European and Malaysia tomatoes.

Atmosphere and service is great (can be a bit noisy on busy weekend evenings) and if you make the effort to be polite and friendly you'll be rewarded.

Word of advice: the best time to visit is during weekdays (lunch or dinner)... the place can be busy on the weekend and it's not unknown for certain popular dishes (*cough* burrata *cough*) to occasionally sell out if you are a late diner."
Tasty Italian Cuisine,"Ordered a folded pizza and linguine for lunch with the family. The folded pizza is really unique filled with cheese, pizza bread was baked til very chewy. The linguine and the sauce was delicious as well. Pricing is affordable and worthwhile for the food quality we get."
Homely Italian joint with great food,"Visited Capri for a birthday celebration and will go back again! Although it was really busy that night, the food came reasonably quick, was delicious and service was pleasant. Their risotto with citrus and prawn tartare was a great choice too that was refreshing and light o bathe palette! We also had their homemade gnocchi which had a fresh springy texture to it, generously coated with cheese making it a strong and tasty dish.

After telling them about the birthday celebration, the Chef also prepared a homemade panna cotta which was a sweet (and delicious) gesture.

Will be back!"
great!,Good food and service. We will return and recommend to friends and family. Ordered a pizza and a pasta that was not on the menu. No problem to accommodate.Thank you.
Great Pasta!,"My friend and I were craving for pastas and Capri Trattoria's pasta were authentic flavored, freshly made and of good portion. We enjoy every bit of our pasta and left truly satisfied. Will be back again soon."
Amazing service and superb food,"I've read about this restaurant on different blogs - claiming it to be one of the best places in Singapore for authentic Italian food. After visiting a Friday night I must agree. By far the best service we've experienced in Singapore. The owner - Italian but has lived in Singapore many years - was extremely friendly. The food was superb. We had the home made Breasola as a starter then pizza for main and Tiramisu for dessert. The Breasola was amazing - melted in the mouth. Perfectly seasoned.

The pizza was very good tasting (the ingredients were if very high quality) and with a perfect dough.

Finished with an awesome Tiramisu and double espresso which also was very good.

You might think I was paid to write this review but that's not the case - me and my wife genuinely thinks what I wrote above.

We will definitely come back and recommend anyone who wants superb Italian food to come here!"
Tasty Italian Food,Quaint restaurant that serves tasty Italian fare. Ordered an assortment of items but I liked the Fettuccine alla nocerina (pork sausage pasta) the best. It was al dente and the pork/sauce was not overpowering. Will come back for this. The Tartufata pizza was pretty yummy too.
