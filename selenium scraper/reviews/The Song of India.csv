What a find - amazing.,What a find. Loved the great service and wonderful food. We chose a ‘journey through India’ meal from the menu and it was absolutely fabulous. The service was exemplary and the recommendations were spot on.
"Excellent service,high quality food.","A warm welcoming,followed byan excellent service,with a lot of attention to details on order to please u.thanks Rohit for your lovely service."
Friend Birthday,We celebrated Bday their. Its awesome indian food. Feel like in india food. Speacilly garnish part is very nice. The person serving us Mr Rohit very kind and served all dishes in well manner also thanks All staff. Keep it up.
Below average for a Michelin Star,"Always looking for Michelin stars restaurant and loving Indian food our expectations were high. While the food was good and the server friendly, details were lacking such as dirty menu, bright lighting, and service not to standard for a Michelin star restaurant. I guess it would be a good restaurant if not Michelin."
Authenticity and luxury,"I have been to The song of India twice, both times I enjoyed my time. The staff is very helpful and attentive. The food is delicious and authentic. If you are looking for a luxury experience and excellent Indian food this is the place for you. I would like to thank the staff from The Song Of India for making my Valentine's day very special. I am very much looking forward to trying every single thing on the menu. Keep up the good work."
An amazing experience!,"Brought by my Fiancée for my birthday. Every dish and the accompanying sauces had a very distinct taste. Rohit, who served us, came across as someone who is very warm and hospitable. He took the time to explain the different courses to us, even how they made it. Even though we did like a tasting menu, they were very generous to offer more of the meat curries that we liked. The birthday photo printed on the spot was also a nice touch. The 2.5hrs here went by very quickly."
"Great place, amazing hospitality!","We chose to dine at ‘The Song of India’ on occasion of my wife’s birthday. Amazing hospitality, great food, loved the way Mr.Rohit treated us throughout our dine time. It was a pleasant surprise when Rohit brought a ‘cake with candles’ to celebrate a special day. Got a memorable gift, We loved it!"
Service By Thina,There is no words for me to explain how good the service was carried out by this man called Thina. He was so polite and kind and was answering all sorts of my questions regarding the food since it was my First time there. I would like to visit often because of his service
COMPLIMENT,The food was fine and was served by Thina and he was friendly and has excellent customer service quality
Great service,I was there with my family to celebrate my parents wedding anniversary . The food was good . And the service was totally amazing by Thina . Great experience
Birthday Dinner,"Awesome Service and food, Staff is very polite. And Welcome dish is thanks for making us a memorable celebration."
Song of india,Food very good services very good all good chef mural is very good food world no 1 food Singapore very good
Grate food at 'song of India',"I visited with my family for Singapore on vacation,we had lunch at song of India was grate specialty lamb shank,which was so well cooked,
With authentic flavour.
One must visit here for sure!
Thanks to 'chef mural'"
Booked Lunch buffet but there was no lunch buffet,How did Song Of India get a Michelin star?? The food & service was mediocre. Ops Manager never bothered to revert to me after I shared my experience. Will not recommend this over-priced restaurant to anyone.
Proper Indian food in elegant settings,"A wonderful, first class restaurant; with none of the pretense. Despite it's Michelin star, the food here is not 'stuffy': it is hearty and delicious. The restaurant itself is beautiful. Staff are so friendly and warm and chatty. Dina in particular really looked after me. The chef (Manjunath) also came out and said hello which was a nice touch. Highly recommend this place."
20 February,"Heard about the song of India is a Michelin restaurant. Book a reservation today n went to try it out. Really like the ambience and the food was great. Anita was really attentive to us. Clearing the plates n replenish our water once we r done, even notice my friend was feeling cold n handle her a shawl. Overall we enjoyed our lunch there."
What is wrong with Michelin reviewers? Definitely doesn't deserve a star,"When you go to a Michelin star restaurant you expect a very unique experience in terms of service, food, wine, etc. They don't have a tasting menu, only big dishes, so we could only try two dishes, the Tikka Masala which was ok (7/10), and Chili Prawns which were good (6/10). The service was like a regular restaurant in the beginning, then they said that kitchen was about to close and then they started to clean the tables, and no verbal description of the dishes, no Sommelier coming to the table, no contact from the Chef, etc. No Michelin Experience at all, and at 350 SGD that is what you are expecting. Definitely not worth it"
Excellent Valentine's Day lunch,"We had a quiet corner and were served by Rohit. He made us feel welcome, showed good knowledge of the dishes and obliged readily when asked to take photos. Food was excellent and portions were just nice. We had the set menu Journey through India and the items were tasty and jsut right
All in all, a perfect lunch"
Good experience,"It was a our first visit to this restaurant. Overall good experience.
Food and service was excellent"
Worst Michelin experience ever!,"Never have I been so disappointed by a ""Michelin"" starred restaurant. My husband and I decided to dine at The Song of India as a pre Valentine's dinner but I wished we would have walked out like some of the previous reviewers had...the decor was ghastly and outdated, the service was non-existent, the entire restaurant smelled like something was burning in the kitchen and the food was absolutely not up to par to deserve a Michelin star! We have been to various Michelin starred restaurants and this was an insult to the dedication and innovation of the chefs from the other restaurants. I don't know how this restaurant achieved a star...the presentation of the food was loveless, we had to keep the same cutlery for the entire set menu (aside from dessert) and the food (though ok) was dull without any surprising twists. We could have gone to any Indian restaurant and gotten the same for less money and probably in a nicer setting. Never again."
I was there with my best friend and brother,"I was there with my best friend and her brother to celebrate his birthday.
The place was beautiful and the food was delicious from the buffet spread.
Though it was not an elaborate spread, the quality and taste were wonderful.
The servers were friendly and professional.
Especially Prasad who was always smiling and he helped to take a picture and the postcard given was so memorable.
He is a good listener and helped to cut the cake as requested and he showed his professionalism in the way he delivered his service and good situational awareness.
Thumbs up to Prasad and the rest of the team!
Please keep up the good work!"
Worst service experience in Singapore,"The two stars are purely because we didn’t try the food. The service is AWFUL! We had made a reservation at least a month in advance for my boyfriends birthday - 9pm reservation. When we arrived , the front of the house was fantastic but the minute we got seated it was game over. Our waiter was really rude. I asked for tap water instead of bottled water knowing that we would spend heavy on a nice bottle of wine and the waiter took the water bottles away rudely- we then asked for the set menus (he had only given us the a la carte menu) and that was the last straw , he got them for us and borderline thru them on the table
For any Michelin starred(or any) restaurant - I expect the waiter to be friendly , introduce themselves maybe. Just make us feel comfortable when I’m about to spend $600 on a dinner . In this situation, I can’t even tell you the waiter name- he never introduced himself . We were so excited about trying the restaurant out... we ended up walking out and leaving before ordering anything. service killed our experience"
OCC Review of The Song Of India December 2019,"This review of ‘The Song of India’, located at 33 Scotts Road, Singapore. 228226 is the latest by the Oakham Curry Club (OCC). Singapore branch.

The Song of India, is the ultimate in luxury fine dining for modern Indian Cuisine in Singapore. Located just a stone’s throw from Orchard Road, in a classic black and white heritage bungalow, it forms the setting of grand opulence and sophistication with its stylish interiors and lush green surroundings for a gastronomical journey through India with its award winning cuisine. Since opening its doors in April 2006, The Song of India has established itself as one of the iconic restaurants of Singapore and has garnered numerous awards – will it add the much sought after, the fashionable, the sensational OCC sticker of recommendation?

The OCC is a well-respected Institution with multiple international franchises. The OCC takes pride in searching out the finest Indian restaurants and providing impartial reviews of Curry Houses all over the world. Members vote anonymously without being influenced by other members (we call this “no swaying”) on 5 categories, and an average score out of a maximum 10 is given to each restaurant we review. Restaurants must score an average of 7/10 or above to receive the OCC sticker of recommendation. All OCC members have been through a rigorous selection process to gain entry into the Club. In short, we all know our curries.

Do we enjoy appointing the club to judicially appoint the scores? I’ll let you, the reader, be the judge of that!

Quality: 7.73
Customer care: 8.82
Value: 5.8
Service: 8
Atmosphere: 6.83

The Song of India like my friend who was run over by a steam train, should be chuffed to bits with an overall score of 7.44. Congratulations on being awarded a coveted OCC sticker of recommendation to put next to the Michelin star.

The night of the 12th was a rainy evening. The OCC that night were like coconuts - Hard on the outside but sweet once you crack us; also full of alcohol and holding an umbrella

Note – I am writing this review whilst watching the film 12 Angry Men (a 50s courtroom drama with Henry Fonda. A jury of 12 deliberate the conviction of a youth accused of moider* - it’s a lovely film) which aligns nicely with the 12 dish menu we were treated to in the restaurant’s private dining room. Feedback on the private room and atmosphere from the group was mostly positive; commentary however on the “cavernous, yet sad and empty restaurant” nods to the fact that it was pretty much empty.

Dish 1 – a tempered chicken and almond soup with a crouton stick. Just like Juror 1, the jury foreman, it set the scene well. The first soup many of us have dipped into at an Indian restaurant, but nonetheless a “tasty and unremarkable” number.
Dish 2 – Mustard enhanced smoked salmon & tandoori chicken with mint chutney. I liken this to Juror 6, a tough but principled bloke. He offers a bloke out in the film… the chicken was tough. Lets just leave it there.
Dish 3 - Lime sorbet laced with truffle oil. Juror 3 stands out here. He’s a cuss word. Truffle oil is a cuss word. Snazzy sorbet though, but the group couldn’t get past the truffle oil.
Dish 4 – Coastal prawn curry (opposed to the inner city prawns that I prefer) – Juror 2. Proper meek bloke. No real zing and a solitary prawn, a curry doesn’t make. Meh
Dish 5 – Bhuna Lamb Ghost – Juror 9. A solid dependable old bloke. A Bhuna lamb is a staple of any good curry house. The Song on India didn’t disappoint here.
Dish 6 – Dumpukht chicken in potli masala – I don’t know what these words mean. Juror 4 is unflappable and looks European for what it’s worth. Thin glasses. Anyway.. It was good chicken to be fair.. echoed by the group.
Dish 7 - Garlic enhanced spinach and cottage cheese. Vegetarian. Juror 11 a lovely European fella who makes watches. Nice, very nice but you would never order him in a restaurant.
Dish 8 – Black lentil delicacy – Juror 7. My favourite juror, he just wants to go and watch baseball. Who wouldn’t. The ‘delicacy’ was more of a ‘plop’ but it was delicious. Very very delicious.
Dish 9 – Rice. Solid. Juror 5. Just nice in the background. Need him there
Dish 10 – Naans & YogYog – Juror 12. All style, changes his mind a lot… Not a comparison but I’ve made my bed and I’m lying it in. The naans were great by the way.
Dish 11 – Pudding. Alphonso mango kulfi & Gulab jamun as well as fresh fruits – Juror 10. He’s an idiot. This pudding reminds me of 2012.. I couldn't get tickets for the Olympic synchronised swimming so instead I watched a woman drown through a kaleidoscope. Drizzling random stuff on a plate with a bowl in the middle is not my idea of a pudding. Personal preference here, but if it’s not something clean to finish the palate or chocolate, or indeed something you can have with custard, then what’s the point! Speaking of sneakiness, I wonder how many chameleons snuck onto Noah’s boat…
Dish 12 – The wines and the service – Juror 8, Henry Fonda. Top notch, held the whole meal together.

The above reads negatively, but I do love a good moan. Feedback on the value was prominent, whilst the food wasn’t quite thimble sized, it wasn’t far off. We’re not tight, but when I bought a dishwasher recently, I sorted by lowest price first; i ended up buying a sponge. Additionally, a lot of commentary on whether Indian food suits the fining dining set up done this way which is curry for thought... A look back at the scoring suggests that OCC sticker is given on service and customer care; I would ask future restaurants to bare this in mind..

Sadly, I have to go, I’ve accidentally booked myself onto an escapology course and I can’t get out of it.

Never apologise, never explain. Sorry, but that’s my motto.

Ps. The OCC’s door is always open, so if you know how to fix hinges that’d be great. Check out our other reviews and check back each month for the latest on the Singapore curry scene!

*RIP Taggert. RIP."
I wonder where is the Michelin star coming from,"Mediocre food , meat over cooked and not fresh , poor service .
Moving table and chairs around with lot of noise during dinner time .
Location is vey nice but the dinner ruins it"
Awesome North Indian Food and great service,"We enjoyed the food, We had Dal Makhani, Dum Aloo, Naan, Rice, Veg Platter, all items were tasty, delicious and authentic.
Portions were decent too.

The service was great. I would like to mention the special efforts done by Anitha, she served us a cake because it was my birthday, and clicked our photo too.

On our way back, she handed the Gift card (with our photo) too.

Thank you ""The Song of India"" and Anitha :-)"
Awesome experience at Song of India,"When we arrived at Song of India for lunch, we were greeted by a team of very friendly service staff and were ushered to the table.

Rohit, who attended to our table was extremely attentive and gave good recommendations! Food is very authentic.

Our overall food and service experience was great and is a Must visit."
Excellent!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and service! We were wonderfully looked after by Rohit who always made sure our drinks were filled up and happy with our dining experience. The food was really nice, be ready to spend a little more than usual for Indian food but very well worth it for the ambience, quality of wine and I would definitely recommend the vegetarian platter to start. Very happy and will be going back definitely!"
Birthday dinner with family,"The ambience is nice (a colonial residence converted to a restaurant)

First things first - its not wheelchair friendly. To reach the restaurant there are a flight of staors to climb, so keep in mind.

The starters were nice and the presentation was commendable.
We had orderes fish n chicken and both were tasteful.

The main course however let us down with both Dal and chicken tasting just about average.

We did not order any dessert due to our mid course let down... But then to our surprise, since it was our birthday dinner and we had already told them in one casual conversation.. They got small pastry cake for us and snapped a pic and even gave it as a souvenir ffom the restaurant...

All in all a sinusoidal experience.
Our table assistant was Prasad and he took goo care of our needs!"
A Michelin Star restaurant.,"We were pretty excited about coming here. It was a restaurant with a single Michelin star. That was enough reason for the built up anticipation and the reason to look forward to the visit.
It is in a nice location. The leafy walk upto the restaurant from Scotts road, the building itself. The first impression was one that left you looking forward to the rest.
We went in pretty early on a Monday afternoon. Around 12 noon. Understandably there was nobody else in the restaurant. One of the service staff came up and allowed us a choice of seating.
He offered us a choice of different kinds of water and went off to get our choice. His first offer for food was to direct us to the buffet. Only when told that we were not too keen on the buffet did he offer us the menu for the a-la-carte choices. Still no desire to push the set menu options. Wonder if this is standard practise or if this was just on account of being a quiet Monday afternoon.
After giving us the menus, the a-la-carte and the set ones we realised that a couple of choices available online are not available in the printed copy of the set menu choices. When quizzed about this, the staff member did put forward a convincing story about the set menus being changed from that day on and that the marketing team had only managed to provide the printed options of the new menus without having updated the online ones.
I wanted to try the set menu option of Journey through India, the vegetarian option. The boss was having a bit of stomach issues and settled for a kebab tasting platter.
It was only after taking the food orders and relaying the same to the kitchen that we were asked about any drinks choices. Should have been the other way around.
Both of us were served an amuse bouche. Am pretty sure the service staff said it was Puchkar Chaat, but could have heard it wrong. The flavours were a bit bland. Maybe a little more acidity and some more seasoning would have lifted the whole thing. But thought that it was too early to start criticising the food and let it be.
The soup was a tomato and capsicum soup. This was wonderful. There was a slight hint of the caramelised capsicum along with a bit of the smokiness. The soup was just the right thickness, not too gluggy and not too thin. The crostinni accompanying it was crisp. Don't know the reason behind the roasted cherry tomato along with it.
Entree was served after this, along with my wife's Kebab tasting platter. The paneer option on the entree had a lovely spiciness to it. Not enough to burn either the front or the back of your mouth. The two papdis on the entree plate tasted a bit similar to the amuse bouche. Again these could have done with a bit of acidity and seasoning. The presentation of the plate also left a lot to be desired. It was as if a first or second year cookery student had tried their hand at it.
The Kebab tasting plate had a couple of chicken kebabs, a lamb option, a salmon one and two prawn choices. I had to eat the seafood ones since she does not do seafood. The salmon was beautifully done. It was moist on the inside and had a lovely flavour filled crust to it.
My main mean was preceeded by a sorbet. This was I think the best part of the whole meal. A lemon sorbet with a nice hint of truffle through it. It really went down well and cleared up the palate for the main meal.
The main meal was a stylised take on a thaali. The ideal Indian repast. A couple of choices of breads, some rice and a choice of three/four/five veg preparations.
In this case (refer the photo) just above the rice was an okra dish, a shot glass of flavoured yoghurt, a palak paneer, a Rajasthani potato dish, a Kerala styled veg moilee and a dal. The rice was supposed to be saffron rice. Accompanying this were a couple of rotis/naans.
The okra dish was the best of the lot. The crunchy okra and the rich sauce it came in were great. The palak paneer was really just a run of the mill affair, nothing special can be said about it as nothing stood out about this. Same goes for the potato dish as well. The moilee was by far the worst of the lot. I have travelled through Kerala and have eaten better versions of this dish in roadside stalls. The sauce was just too gluggy and did not have any much flavour to it. The dal was definitely great. It was rich and well cooked, well tempered and was great. The rice had a hint of saffron through it, but barely.
Dessert followed this. Again the presentation of the plate could have been much better. There was a few berries on the plate and either the plate was a warm one or the plated food was left under the heat lights for too long. The berries were pretty warm. Did not get to taste the mini macaroons as they were scoffed by the boss.
The gulab jamun was a bit too hot for my liking. Warmed through, not heated through would be better. The kulfi was amazing. The taste of the mangoes, the creaminess and the crunch from the nuts through it was great.

The experience was a good one.
Service was spot on. The staff was not too obtrusive. They were observant and knew when it was time to clear and when it was time to get the next course.
The food, well, for the price that we paid, I would tend to see it as a bit of an extravagance. There was nothing overall in the food that said WOW. It was definitely of a high standard. But a Michelin star and the price should have justified a certain noteworthiness to the meal, which was missing."
Nice experience,"The restatuarant interior and setup was saying ""welcome"" when you entered the door. The waiter's and the owner were extremely focused on the customers wellbeing from the 1st second.

I tried the menu named ""a tour through India"" that had a variety of traditional Indian food but served with a modern look. The taste experience of this menu and the layout was not disappointing.

One of the best Indian cuisine meals I have ever tried.

Thanks to Romit"
"Good food, great service","Visited Jan 19th for our anniversary, splendid food. Our server, Prasad was very attentive and good. Would definitely visit again."
Splendid Service- Anitha Martin,It was indeed a memorable & pleasant experience havinv celebrated my mother's birthday this evening. The dishes which were recommended by Anitha Martin was remarkable. They paired so well with our staples- rice & garlic naan. Her recommendation for Panneer Taka Tak is a must try. We loved it! Thank you for the decadent chocolate cake. So delicious! Lovely ambience- perfect for dates and family gatherings.
Amazing food and friendly service!,Authentic taste of Indian food. Great ambiance and service. This restaurant really was amazing and I would say 100% deserved the michelin star.
Birthday buffet,We went to celebrate my wife’s birthday We were provided good seats The spread of buffet was good though not very large The food was just tasty though could me more spiced up We were given bottled water in spite of requesting normal water Surprised to get a photo snap after blowing the slice of cake provided by the restaurant Ambience is now dated and requires refurbishing
Not worth the money or the Michelin star,"On arrival we only got the À la carte menu with no mention of the possibility of a set menu or the buffet (I knew about these options thanks to checking the Web page prior to our visit). We had a vegetarian and a non-vegetarian Journey through India set menu. Most of the dishes were very underwhelming. No richness of taste characteristic to Indian cuisine. The service was decent but not engaging in any way. Overall the only aspect that was on the Michelin star level was the high price :-(. The restaurant should be avoided, especially in a city with such a rich culinary scene as Singapore."
Great meal,"This place lives up to its Michelin rating, great service, great meal. The mixed vegetarian starter was average, but the lamb chops were fantastic. Overall we really enjoyed."
Not worthy! Very average meal,"We booked a reservation here for New Year Eve. Since this is a restaurant with one star Michelin, I thought it would be a great experience. However, the buffet style did not live up to our expectations (there was a set menu when i booked but somehow it was not available when we arrived). The service was definitely not Michelin standard so i dont think we will come back here anytime soon nor recommend to anybody else."
Excellent service at The Song of India,We had a birthday lunch at The Song of India. The food was excellent and the service provided by Prasad was fantastic. A great place to go celebrate a special occasion.
Food and ambience,"The service was good as usual , but we found Ala-Carte ordered meat & seafood ( Prawns ) overcooked than normal."
A memorable 81st birthday celebration,"We were exploring where to celebrate our dear friend and teacher’s 81st birthday. Having dined with our teacher at numerous Chinese, Thai, Indonesian, and Peranakan eateries over the years, we decided to have Indian cuisine this year.

The restaurant we chose was Song of India along Scotts Road for the birthday celebration.

For a wider selection of food for this occasion, we decided to go with the delectable lunch buffet. The outstanding dishes which stood out for us were the Butter Chicken, Fish Tikka, Paneer Masala, Aloo Jaipuri, Dal Makhni and the lovely assortment of naan & roti. The most unforgettable dish for us was definitely the Dum Biryani.

Apart from the lovely food, despite the busy lunch crowd, the service team was simply wonderful and attentive to our needs. Special thanks to Rohit, for making our birthday celebration a memorable one."
The worst experience ever,"I don't know how this restaurant got a Michelin star. There are better street side restaurants in Singapore which are way better and way cheaper than this.

The experience started with a waiter saying that you can't order any starters as we are closing - this despite us making a reservation with the restaurant and reaching on time. He said the restaurant is about to close so I can't have the chef tasting menu as well. Then when I spoke to the manager he said that I can order starters as well as go for the chef tasting menu.

The whole exchange was a huge turn off.

And please stop calling your black lentil as Dal Dumphukt. It is a disgrace to the name. Please go to India and try the black lentil at original Dum phukt.

Please avoid this restaurant if you can. You will for sure find better ways to spend your money."
Great service pretty good food.,"We had Rohit as our server, he took care of us well, 5* service!
The food was pretty good, not as good as you come to expect from a michelin star resturaunt, nothing mindblowing.

7.5/10"
Great food in a nice setting,"Had an ala carte lunch and we thoroughly enjoyed both the food and the service. We ordered soup, 4 mains and naan. Portions were generous and Rohit was a great host."
Great food and wonderful service,Great food and wonderful service from Rohit !! Nice environment too. We love the chicken tikka and yogurt especially.
Service and food,"We visited this place twice once for dinner and the lunch buffet, both times we were served by Rohit who provided an excellent service. As for the food
During dinner as it was very creatively presented but a bit overpriced. For lunch the buffet had decent spread."
Wonderful fine-dining experience at The Song of India,"It’s my first fine dining experience at The Song of India and it was wonderful. The restaurant is so beautiful and it’s constantly filled with the fragrance of freshly made and roasted poppadom and naan. The food is certainly delicious too!

Despite it being a complimentary tasting session, we’re not shortchange of the food quality and the pleasant service experience of our table host, Rohit. Great food and nice ambience! Will certainly recommend anyone who’s considering to try to just go for it :)"
Buffet,"Excellent spread. Delicious food
We were attended to by Mr Prasad. Very courteous !!would highly recommend this place for lunch ."
Nice and Quaint restaurant with great food !,"We heard about the restaurant from a workplace friend. We were pleasantly surprised to see an nice quaint stand alone place. We took the buffet but next will take the ala carte. That way we can enjoy the plating of the delectable food as well.

Great food
Good ambience
Very good staff who ensure the guests are well attended to and engaged.

Special mention for Rohit who ensured our experience was first class."
star studded dinner & service,"Visit to a Michelin starred fine Indian cuisine restaurant. Good food is expected but a pleasant touch was Prasad's warm hospitality and service to feel at home and welcomed for special occasions. The fish curry and garlic naan in particular are outstanding. Situated on a classic black and white bungalow just 5"" walk from Newton train station makes this a accessible venue for tourists and locals alike. Do admire the art pieces around you!"
Indian vegetarian restaurant,Amazing service by Anita and delicious food. Vegetarian and Jain dishes. Excellent service and food.
Dishonest waiter,"Waiter was not keen to take ala carte orders as he said the kitchen was busy, though I mentioned that I would like to use AMEX platinum privilege. He told us a lie that buffet is $50+ per pax & will be cheaper than AMEX privilege. In the end, its $60 per pax before taxes. Ala Carte is only $30-$50 per dish and its 50% off for 2 main courses ordered. What a lie."
Very pleasant experience at Song of India!,"We celebrated my wife's birthday there and was surprised that they not only gave us a surprise b'day cake with a lit candle, they even took a pic for us, printed it and presented it on a card before we left!

The food was really good too, and we enjoyed the quality and spread of the food!

I recommend this to anyone who wants a nice dining experience and quality Indian food!"
"Delicious food, superb ambience and excellent service","It was long due on our list to visit this famous Michelin star Indian restaurant in Singapore and we were glad that we finally visited this place. The food was absolutely delicious and authentic. What impressed us more was the service from their manager Prasad. Hard to find such great service here specially in fine dining restaurants. Thanks Prasad for your lovely service, we look forward to come again soon."
Enjoyed My Birthday and the Service,"This was the first time my wife and I went there and we enjoyed it. Their ""Journey through India"" veg and non-veg set meal was good and trust me,you should go there with an empty stomach and a big appetite. I was really amazed by the service that was given by their staff, Rohit. He always ensured that after each dish was serve, we were satisfied with it and even offered us to refill the dishes if needed. After knowing that it was my special day today,he arranged a mini birthday cake and took our photo and even got them printed for us on their special card.I'm sure those who go there, you will definitely want Rohit to serve you. Thanks Song of India for making my day even more special."
Good but expensive,"Visited this restaurant on a business trip.
Location: old style building in a leafy garden.
Food: large portions of very tasty North Indian food. Nice presentation.
Staff: friendly and attentive
Value: overall too expensive. Main course above 40$ on average. Rice etc all extra."
Great experience on my Wife’s bday,"We wanted to go to a fine dining place and chose song of india also because it is an Indian Michelin star. I chose the basic set menu. The presentation of the restaurant and the subtle fusion in the taste, the wine collection everything was at par with the name and our expectations. But beyond my expectations was the extremely friendly jovial and polite service. We were very pleasantly served every time we requested. Prasad went over the signature dishes and the chef details. He in fact, knowing that it is my wife’s bday, took multiple pictures for us from various angles and later printed one which my wife really adored. They also complemented us with a small and cute bday cake. Hence it was a great experience."
Excellent Ambience and service,"Great ambience and service, especially our server Rohit. The desserts and main course was pretty good. Starters could have been better."
Great Experience and Great Service,"The service staff were excellent and our host, Rohit, was always attentive and helpful! The portions were a little big, but were all very tasty and flavourful. The tandoori chicken was excellent!"
Unimpressed,"We were there to try out the Michelin degustation course but to our surprise, we were abruptly told there were no ala-carte lunch. No explanation and we went for the buffet brunch instead. They shouldn't even bother to have asked sparkling or distilled. There is iced water accompanying the buffet. And then, there was a few tables with degustation menu served and upon queried, it was only through pre-booking. We were taken aback that no impromptu order of the degustation menu allowed. Is this the norm? Aren't you supposed to be readily available to serve that.

But luckily, we never ordered the degustation menu upon observing how the rest had their meals without any introduction. Not a very professional way of serving a degustation menu. If I were to have paid more than S$100 for that kind of service, it would be a very sad meal.

I would say luckily we went for the brunch instead. All the traditional standard Indian meal is present in the buffet. The butter chicken curry was great but could get it anywhere else at a lesser price."
The song of India,"My friend and me went to this great restaurant almost is our last day in singapor. The food was great we took as starter a soup and for the main dish we took 2 lamb. Fantastic .

We got excellent service from Paasad and all the other waiter.

For sure we will return to the song of India in our next visit with more people."
Excellent,"At first I was a bit nervous because I read some bad reviews, however the experience was excellent. The quality of the food is remarkable, the service was professional with kind personality. My friend and I ordered two different degustation menus and his included a lime sorbet before the main course, mine didn’t but the waiter brought me one without an additional cost nonetheless. The chef respects traditional Indian cuisine in every aspect, but gets more creative in the desserts and presentation. In summary: worth a stop!"
Excellent food and service for the Gastromonth lunch,"Visited on my anniversary. Had booked the Gastromonth lunch, which is a specally curated menu of 15 items. The service was great; the server explained each and every item as it was brought out. The food is excellent as always. Our server (Rohit) did an excellent job, including taking a photo of ours (and printing it on the spot); the restaurant also served us a complimentary dessert (a mini-cake) with a candle. The appetizers and dessert was especially nice in this menu. The only downer was a group of 15-20 people who were rather noisy as if they were dining in a food-court and not in a classy restaurant, and spoiled the ambience that day."
Food and ambience,"Delicious Taste , very friendly customer service. and great ambience.
Everything made our day and met our expectations."
Fantastic food and world class service,Prasad explained each dish passionately! His service was superb and overall a great experience ! Strongly recommend !
My humble suggestions to improve what u have !,"Hi

We were a group of 7 people and I was celebrating my birthday. The good part first :
Reservation team was very professional and prompt
The complimentary small cake served at the end of the meal was lovely and really appreciated ! The presentation of food was nice.
Some of the main course dishes were nice too!
The starters were average.
We were served a complimentary course of onion or potatoe pakora But was cold and tough to bite into.

My main comment is about the room itself and servers.

The room was rather small or maybe the table is too big. There was no space for the waiters to pass thru and our guests had to squeeze and adjust their chairs a few times for the staff to move thru . This was very embarrassing for me as a host

I would expect much greater style amongst the staff in a fine dining place. Plates when being cleared should not be stacked up in an unsightly manner like people do in food courts . For example when we finished the main course , the staff picked up the small plates and stacked them on top of the main plate right in front of me and then picked up the whole thing. It is not very appetizing to see. They should rather clear one at a time . And due to space of the room and waiters squeezing thru, sometimes a spoon or two will fall from the plates and onto the floor disturbing the discussions we were having.

The room entrance is rather uneven . Most of us tripped while coming out.

We are widely travelled people and eat at Michelin starred restaurants around the world and there is a certain high standard of food , decor and servers. Overall I feel you have a lot of scope to improve .

Tks"

A MICHELIN STAR ?? Its OVERRATED,"The food is nothing to write home about , its basic Indian food .. I had gone here a couple of years back and had promised i shall 'never' return again but i had to on one of the saturday's noons. Its just 'NOT' a Michelin from any angle .. its a joke !! i think this brand is way too tired here and there is no 'finesse' or quality in the food !! Atleast i have really high end clientele .. certainly not going here again !!!"
Poor table service and average typical Indian food.,"Visited on 13 November 2019 to celebrate my partner birthday. Food was extremely horrible. The service really left us a negative experience. As a Chinese myself, the other table full of Indians received better customer table service individually. From the time we step in and till we finished our dinner, service was not professionally delivered. There was a gentleman service crew on the floor giving us a black face throughout. Perhaps he has a rough day ahead. However, the lady service crew was pleasant and nice in personality. Critically, the in-store manager did not ensure service crew are doing their job and neither are they properly trained and guide. Fault lies with the management and store manager of the day. Requested for a birthday cake with ‘happy birthday’, but they failed miserably. They had ensure me via message that the plating has limited space and only ‘happy birthday’ can be in place. However still, they didn’t deliver their trust and message. If you cannot ensure things as accordance, please don’t give a assurance to us. If you’re here for an occasion, don’t bother. If you’re feeling rich, price isn’t an issue but don’t expect good service and food. And if you’re on a budget, this place is a cut throat location. Dine in to experience yourself. They expect us to know their style of service. A simple ‘happy birthday’ request can led to such poor service. This place isn’t a place to celebrate occasion, and definitely not a photography place. Background is dark and seats are not comfortable. Looks nice on the outside, but when you step inside, it’s full of darkness."
Very good but not great,"The nicest thing about this place is the stylish yet cozy dining room. The food is good, although several dishes tend to be a bit too salty, and in my personal opinion is not as succulent as Punjab Grill or Rang Mahal. Service is professional, although I was surprised that the staff had to be reminded to close the door of the private dining room where we dined several times throughout the evening. Why this received a Michelin star and not the other two restaurants is yet another example of the fact that Michelin are not equipped to rate Asian restaurants."
Horrible experience - Do not go!,"I took my family for lunch to song of India with hopes of celebrating my mom's birthday - worst decision made.

The food was mediocre, the decor average & the service, horrendous. We ordered a bottle of wine & after having asked multiple times for a refill (& not getting one), I resulted in topping up the glasses myself. Requesting for some water couldn't be more difficult - it seemed they had to trek down to orchard ion to get some as it took 25mins + multiple requests before we got any water. The staff were not attentive at all - finished plates remained on the table long after it was clear (as the plates/dishes were empty) that we were done with them. To top things off, the restaurant wasn't over 50% full either which might (just might) explain sloppy service standards.

Overall, a horrible & overpriced restaurant that's, personally, undeserving of a Michelin star.

Recommendation: DO NOT GO"
Wonderful food,"We loved the food, it was an explosion of aromas. Portions surprisingly big (too much for us). Aircon was too cold and table next to ours remained dirty after previous diners had left"
Freezing restaurant!,"Super freezing cold. Aircondition was much to cold. Service was very poor. No attention from the stuff. Was sitting 20 minutes before ordering the drinks. Food is excellent, but much too high priced.wont come back."
Great tastes - variable service,"Food was great tasting, but the service was inconsistent. The tasting platters that my husband and I were of the same things on the plate, but the quantities were different. Service was inconsistent from being rude, to being fine - different servers all the time. The specials wine list had 5 or 6 white wines on it, only one of them was available. The airconditioning is strong, bring a jersey or jacket or long sleeves."
"Nice Restaurant, Good Location",Atmosphere and food all good. Maybe my expectation is a bit high considering the price. As tasty as any other Indian food.
"Great food, great service and good value","Went for gastromonth.
Menu was great. Really good value.
Good attentive staff.

Recommended.
Will go again."
Wonderful gastro lunch experience,"Tasted the Gastro set from Song of India. It was a wonderful experience. The food is delicious with the right amount of spices which suit my taste.
Not to mention the service and ambience was great. Compliment to Prasad for the great service."
Parents’ wedding anniversary dinner,My parents enjoyed themselves at The Song of India featuring Indian cuisine at its finest. They were treated warmly by the staff who knew it was their anniversary and were given some complimentary starters to celebrate the occasion :)
Lovely place for an Indian meal,Had a lovely lunch with the family here. The presentation of the food was very nice and the food tasted as good as it looked. Service was also attentive. Highly recommended.
Our wedding anniversary lunch,"We had been planning for The Song of India for many years but somehow we couldn’t make it earlier. This time we were able to book for our wedding anniversary and we are glad that we chose this restaurant for the occasion. The place has a nice ambience and lighting which makes you feel good and pleasant. Very limited customers so every guest is given due attention. We were hosted by Mr Prasad who took extra care to ensure that our anniversary was memorable. Food quality was good especially Bhindi Tomato curry and Peas Pulao. Special mention for the dessert - chocolate mousse which was as good as found anywhere in the world. Overall the 3 factors - Service, Food quality and Presentation was top notch and that’s why the Michelin Star rating for this restaurant is justified. Lastly, the price is extremely reasonable and we would definitely be back for more occasions and recommend to others as well."
Shame on you Michelin,"How does this restaurant have a Michelin star???
Dated decor complimented by awful service, never mind the restrooms where you have to hold the tap to extract water. Followed by very average Indian food and a pathetic wine card made for an awful experience. I don’t blame the restaurant I blame Michelin shame on you! Time for Gault Millau to expand so that people actually get honest reviews!"
Lunch,"Delicious food by Chef, attentive service by Prasad and his colleagues; and nice ambience. Good introduction to Indian food."
Excellent Indian food,"Finally decided to try this place as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. The staff service was excellent. The lunch buffet was actually quite affordable in comparison to their normal menu. Special mention must go to the naan, very freshly made, nice and fluffly. The lamb curry was also very good and interestingly, the vegetarian based food was of a high quality. Kudos to the staff for making an effort to take our picture as part of the small celebration and the chocolate mousse dessert complimentary"
It’s no surprise that this,"It’s no surprise that this is the first and only Michelin Star under the classic Indian restaurant category in Singapore and south east Asia for four consecutive years since 2016. The food is phenomenal. We visited during my husband’s birthday getaway and this certainly did not disappoint. The crispy fried okra served on a bed of cumin and cashew gravy is ideal for vegetarians. It has the same texture as a good butter chicken. The chicken morsels in roasted dry chillies and coriander, cooked in kadai is tender and practically melts in your mouth. My favourite? The blue cheese naan! The service too was fabulous and they even surprised us with one of the best chocolate cheesecakes for the birthday! Thank you song of India for a wonderful experience !"
Golden Oldie,"There is something quite magical about walking into The Song Of India. Perhaps it is the superb decor, which pushed all the right buttons for the delights to follow.

The Bhuna Ginger Lamb was packed full of flavour, while the Samosas were a pleasant departure from the traditional vegatable wrapped in filo.

The Non-Veg Kebab Platter was a standout. It’s a great way to sample a diverse range of flavours.

The portions are very substantial. But the staff is very accommodating with packing up the leftovers."
Nothing Changed. Still the best.,"It's been quite long since I have dined here. And as always, it never disappoints me. Their food quality at its best. This time I really loved their dhal mhakni. I loved the flavor and goes well with my nan. I would still recommend this place to my friends who loves Indian food.

Kudos to Chef and the Team! :)"
Bias and poor service,"I brought my wife and my 1 year old child to celebrate my wife's birthday. Firstly we were quite impressed with the place but slowly it changes. As we were the first customer, they welcome us well but once other big customer comes in we were totally ignored. Worst part my child was crying abit due to uncomfortable then the waiteress came and told me to bring my child out as the there is a business meeting and it's distruptive to the customer. I was so pissed I am also a customer and you ask me out in the middle of my meal coz you prioritize your other customer. After that we made the complain to the manager and he can say that they don't cater to children below 5. I was like why the hell you didn't tell me when I book and indicated there is a child below 5. And best they have a baby sit. Don't understand the logic. Better don't go there if you gonna be treated a lower caste despite paying the same."
Superb dining experience at 'song of india',"Been to Singapore on vacation with family was amazing dining experience at song of India restaurant,
Kudos to 'chef Mural' for elevating the indian cuisine

Poor customer service,"I had visited the restaurant, Song of India, on the 20th of October 2019,at about 6pm. I had made a reservation and had requested a baby seat as well for my 1 year old. My reservation was accepted and we had gone to have our early dinner. The food was a 30 minute wait which was still acceptable. But when my baby was making a bit of noise and started to get restless, I was requested by the waitress to bring my kid outside as there was a business meeting going on. I truly find this act really appalling and as a Michelin star awarded restaurant, the customer service has to be at excellence and they have to accept all customers at every level. And for a business meeting to happen, they should be particularly allocated a private room. We were clearly not attended to once our food was served and till we finish."
"Nice restaurant, delicious Indian food",The restaurant is in a good location near Orchard Road and a really nice place to end a busy day in Singapore. It was an excitable experience; we would come back for sure.
Flavours at Song of India,"This was my second trip to Singapore with my family.. Had lunch at *song of india* was delicious,so well balanced with the flavours, even the staff was quite prompt on service

Kudos to 'Michelin star Chef Mural'
For upgrading the Indian cuisine to next level

Shaky star dining experience,"It was a quiet Monday night. As a couple we have dined at a few MICHELIN star restaurants in Singapore in the last few weeks. This place doesn’t come anywhere near the others, nor other Indian restaurants either here nor in other countries.
Our waiter mumbled and did not engage and seemed to want to be somewhere else, though he was obviously enjoying the company of other waiting staff.
We shared a vegetarian taste plate and dahl dish that were quite bland. However,the rogan josh was tasty but unremarkable.
The food alone cost over $160 for one shared starter and two mains. Better value and better food to be had elsewhere in Singapore.

Terrible food,"We went there for the Sunday buffet. We paid sgd 50 per person approximately. We are a family of vegetarians.

The day we went to eat the options were one soup, one paneer appetiser, palak paneer, dal makhani, one eggplant dish and one potato dish.

The palak paneer was so terrible. Its sad to say we make a better version of it at home. The paneer was chewy and over cooked. The spinach gravy had water separating from it.

The paneer appetiser was so sour. The daal makhani also was equally sour but still palatable.

The other appetisers that included the aloo tikki chaat almost seemed like leftovers from the previous night.

The desserts were pretty decent and probably the only reason the review has a one star.

We have been here once before. At that point, the food had seemed OK but not as bad as it was this time. Also we had asked them to take photo of the family which the manager had done so and then told us to write a review on TripAdvisor which seemed fine at that moment. He also then managed to harass my husband for 7 days after as we had not submitted one.

We made a cash payment this time. The turn around time was 20 mins to get our change back.

I would not return to this Michelin star restaurant."
Below expectations,"I was expecting a delicious enjoyable fine dining meal but was disappointed. The outside of the restaurant was impressive but the interior is not fine dining. We went for lunch and did not have the buffet. We ordered a la carte. The best dish was the lamb which was tender with very delicious sauce. The eggplant was tasty and I could taste a lot of herbs. The amuse bouche was interesting. The roti was a bit oily and the worst dish was the king prawn which was served lukewarm and drowned in a thin sauce. When the nice waiter asked me how was the food, I gave him my feedback and he looked at the prawn dish and said that the sauce was indeed thin and usually it would be more gravy-like. He did not offer to change or replace the dish. Another thing is that you must be prepared to wash your clothes after a meal in the restaurant because there is a very heavy distinct smell of herbs and food absorbed in your clothes after you leave the restaurant. I think the air filter or air circulation could be better."
Great Indian Food,"Had a company workshop here, which ended with a dinner at the restaurant. Food served was from the 1 Michelin Star menu, was pretty good, though not sure would come back again"
Birth lunch with my friend.,"Lunch buffet with a birthday cake.. Prasad organised it very well. Amazing job Prasad. Food is great , nice ambience.
Except for the part where the other staff were busy clearing up towards the end. I guess,they can be mindful that guests are around."
Dark doorway and hard to find no welcome or front of,No front of house or welcome food excellent service very poor lack of management and training certainly a very nice curry but not a dining experience
Song India,"I came with 33 VIPs from Europe , Asia and etc , very happy with Prasad and team for their kind service .

This is a Michelin Star restaurant , without the Michelin’s star price . Very affordable .

Will recommend to all my friend"
Very Disappointing,"Unfortunately nothing was up to our standard in this restaurant except atmosphere.

Atmosphere- nice. Very beautifully decorated and clean.

Service- BAD.
Food- Okay. Nothing exceptional.
Price-affordable after Amex platinum card discount.

Our experience:
I booked this restaurant to celebrate my Husband birthday as i saw good review on trip advisor. We arrived restaurant on time but the guy in the entrance was very bossy when he escorted us to the seat which spoiled entire mood . The way he speaks, the way he welcomes us was unacceptable. I went to so many high class restaurant but this was one of the first time that i was shocked to be welcomed in such manner.
My Husband told me he is not in the mood to celebrate his birthday in this restaurant before even ordering food.

Food was just okay also. Nothing exceptional. We ordered Butter chicken, cheese naan, peshwari naan, tiger prawn curry and 2 chai and rice.
Butter chicken was good. Cheese naan was acceptable. Peshwari naan was weird as i tasted garlic inside (i have never had peshwari naan with garlic inside) Tiger prawn curry was not nice. Chai was good but it took 20 minutes after we ordered. Desert came first and we had to wait another 20 minutes for just chai.

I honestly wonder why it ranked Michelin star restaurant. We went to so many high class Indian restaurant around the world and we know what the standard is.
Unfortunately i have to say that this restaurant disappointed us a lot.

I still give two star as one of the waiter Prasad was very nice, by noticing I’m celebrating my Husband birthday he offered to take photo and came to ask how we are doing while we were eating.
Plus price was very affordable after Amex discount.
But again, I went to the restaurant to celebrate my Husband birthday. If it were normal day, i would not be so upset but since we were there for celebration, i wish i could have better experience as I do not care how much the price cost but the quality time and memory."
Large portions .. bit tasteless,"For a venue which says it’s up there in the ranking in Singapore the food taste was totally disappointing. We focused on appetizers and glad we did as what you get is enough for 4 people. We also focused on vegetarian food. The food lacked any kind taste, it was bland. The service is attentive and they make an effort.
The decor needs an upgrade, you feel like you are entering the 90’s.

It’s a pricy place, for two of us for 4 veg dishes no alcohol we paid over $150usd

Really not worth it"
