Order the octopus!,"The best octopus I have eaten in a long time, good wine list with great service. Outside seating is great for a date or sit looking into the kitchen!"
I will return ... but with much less enthusiasm,"This used to be one of my fave restaurants. I remember when I managed to book a table for a small party during the Covid, everyone was so excited. It was so difficult to book. (Then someone in the restaurant got Covid...)

So I managed to book. 6 pm. Which is early for me. But what to do? Beggars cannot be choosers. I got a nice table inside. Surprisingly not so noisy. And I saw empty tables in the place. First time ever.

The menu had shrunk. The baked cauliflower was replaced by deep-fried. The baked cauliflower was S-O-G-O-O-D. But it was not there.

The bag of bread was as good as ever. The humus was below its previous peak--which was possibly the best humus in town. The eggplant was all right. The beef cheeks were an unexpected highlight. The grilled fish was blackened. We did not order dessert.

We had got out of the car at 6.09 pm. (We were late.) We were at the cashier at 6.42 pm. In the past, we had to wait 30 minutes before the food came. Maybe it was the shrunken menu that enabled the cooks to deliver the food in time. Here, we were all done in 30 minutes. Fastest $200 meal for four ever.

There may be another reason.

It may be an unfair judgment based on a sample of one evening. But I counted 9 empty tables, mostly for 4s. I had never seen two empty tables in my previous visits. The smaller crowd may have enabled a faster food delivery.

Singaporeans are an incredibly fussy lot and vote with their feet and seldom their reviews.

We will return. Amped up Middle Eastern food is always interesting. But we will return with much less enthusiasm."
Disappointed don't feed Phil,Hard to find. Very average food. Hummus not special in any way. A bag of bread is five small pieces of warm Turkish bread. Big deal what else will you eat the sloppy hummus with? Kebab comes on it's own with sauce no bread. It is over priced mince. Nothing exciting or exceptional. Don't bother. Service fast and polite but just to get u in and out.
Super tasty food!,I love this place! The food is great quality and very very flavoursome. The staff are professional and friendly. Have some dessert to finish off your meal‚Ä¶Date Pudding V2!!!!
Always a great place to entertain guests,"We love the uniqueness of the Middle East inspired cuisines and dining in a garden setting. Dishes are good for sharing - hummus, roasted eggplant mash and yoghurt, with exceptional home baked bread. Sides were fried cauliflowers and falafel salad. Mains was green harissa sea bream. Desserts were equally delicious- date pudding and black sesame pie."
Awesome!,"Very delicious, the service was awesome. The staff is very attentive. You can taste the quality in every dish. We‚Äôllcome again! üòâ"
Ordinary,"We tried the tasting menu. My favorite was the hummus and we had prawns with avocado and dill, the avocado was not freshly cut, looked like it was sitting there for awhile. Grill platter was also quite ordinary and I think for me, it lacked a bit of seasoning and taste, but the grilled tomatoes in the platter was really smokey and sweet and it balanced the dish of heavy grilled meat. Dessert was an eclair. My favorite part of the dish was sitting under the eclair, these chocolate flavored noodles - tasted like deep fried vermicelli chocolate without the the sweetness and was crunchy, like cereral, this was better than the eclair itself - the filling was not right. I think I was expecting too much and the hype of it all was just a let down."
HEAVEN,Hands down the BEST restaurant we ate at in Singapore. The food is impeccable delicious generous and full of love. You absolutely must do the chefs tasting menu it was Perfect. Bjorn and his team have nailed the mix of chill vibes but delicious food and the fusion of flavours was giving me LIFE. Highly recommend
Unique culinary experience!,"The culinary experience at Artichoke was indeed unique and special for us. The location itself took us a bit of time to find. We went there at 7.30pm. By 8.30pm, the whole restaurant was full.

We went for the 'Chef's Tasting Menu' priced at $68/pax (it must be ordered before 8.45pm). First the starters arrived. Hummus, stuffed capsicum and poached tomatoes with cheese. I am very very particular about hummus and I must say this is one of the best hummus I had, comparing my experience against many Middle Eastern restaurants here and abroad. The capsicum and tomatoes tasted awesome too.

The mains arrived in a set of about 6 items. Apparently, their baked cauliflower is their signature dish. Then, there was chicken, fish and cuttlefish, rice and caramelised onions with fried cheese dish. All the dishes were unique and okay.

Finally, the dessert arrived - a pudding. I actually like the pudding and the sauce very much. Final bill came up to about $170 for 2 pax. A bit costly but it was a special treat for an occasion. So, can do once. Overall, I liked the unique array of dishes and the outdoor ambience set in a lush greenery."
Our Artichoke experience,"You read reviews. You see a place on TV. You get a bit excited. And then you get let down. Quite simply, Artichoke did not live up to the hype. The ambience was so-so and the staff were OK, but the food was hit and miss. We didn't hang around for dessert or coffee."
Cozy corner at middle road,"Had heard about this place but finally visited, right at the middle road but still very quite and away from noise, nice indoor and outdoor seating Drinks menu are okay, we tried chef special and it was lovely"
Excellent middle eastern food,"The food was excellent! Authentic and all dishes including desert have depth of flavour. Service staff was good too, they know their food and drinks! Will go back."
Great for Mediterranean taste,"Tucked in a small corner with a cosy outdoor seating area, Artichoke does a good job with food, service and ambience. I remembered to take food pix once I ate it üòÖ Gives an authentic taste of Mediterranean food and can be tried."
Great Middle Eastern Food,Chance upon this lively restaurant even it had been around for a long time. The setting and surrounding caught my eye. Great tasty food and great service. Every bite full of flavours. Rustic setting and furnitures gave this place an offbeat feel.
Catch up with good friend over Dinner,"This was my 1st visit to a restaurant that's classified as funky middle eastern cuisine. We went with an open mind, and we're very pleased with our orders which were hummus, beetroot borani, chipotle babaganoush, grilled cauliflower and swordfish kebab. All of this was accompanied by a few bags of home-made pita bread. It all went well together with their cocktails. We were there from 6pm to 9pm and we couldn't get enough of the place. The service was very good and the serving staff were warm & friendly. Check this place out.

I definitely plan to go back again with family & friends."
Great place,"Found this place by chance, being vegetarians the choice was limited but it was so full filling, the bread and hummus were so fresh. Excellent service and courteous staff, we dined outdoor and it was a pleasant experience. Worth the money."
A happy Belly!,"We enjoyed the dining experience with Artichokes. This is a very cool n hip restaurant in the heart of singapore. We were greeted warmly by the team, good table services! This is my first time and all their food looks so seductive, it was a difficult moment to make a choice! However, there is a Special Menu for 2! To us.. it is a Wow menu. From the entree, main n dessert! Each dish is presented with very detailed herbs, fruits, spices and green. It is the best Middle Eastern meal I ever had. For sure, we will come back again. Great place to chill n have a long conversation over a meal."
Roast Lamb shoulder,Never disappointed whenever we visited this cafe. Awesome outdoor atmosphere and friendly staff. Roast Lamb shoulder melts in your mouth.
Good experience,"Chill atmosphere. We love the prawns, breads, and date puddings. Roast chicken is too pink for our liking."
Good food but small portions and bad service,"This is my 4th visit to the restaurant. A friend and I visited Artichoke on a weekday evening. We did not make a reservation and walked in at 8.15pm. The manager was unfriendly and did not appear interested in serving us. We politely asked if seats were available and were curtly informed that there was a table but it was outdoors and not sheltered. We responded that this was okay with us and he responded by saying ‚Äúlater of rain, cannot change, you all don‚Äôt give me problem later‚Äù. We were shocked at this response as it was completely uncalled for! Nevertheless, we said we were ok with that table and were informed that we had to wait till all those with reservations were ‚Äúhandled‚Äù before being seated. But there was no one else waiting to be served, just us! We were told to wait in the dark alley behind the restaurant until they were ready and did so for some time. They could not even allow us to wait in the lighted area near the counter! We were definitely not blocking anyone as barely anyone was walking in.

We got fed up with the manager‚Äôs attitude and approached one of the waitstaff for assistance, but she clearly deferred to her manager and repeatedly told us ‚ÄúI think you let my manager serve you, ok‚Äù. The manager was clearly refusing to serve us for some reason. Perhaps too busy tending to large groups of Caucasian or expat customers and turning down Singaporeans? Or only interested in serving big groups with reservations? We refused to wait in the dingy alley and stood beside the counter until the manager deigned to serve us a few minutes later. I don‚Äôt see what is wrong with seating customers at an available table and serving them when you are ready. Very disappointing service bordering on discriminatory!

Food was good but portion sizes were smaller than they used to be. Dips were barely enough for 2 to share. We had to repeatedly gesture and wait a long while to be served. Waiters seemed more interested in clearing dirty plates than serving us although they saw us gesture to them. Altogether a terrible experience, would NOT recommend!"
Nice hideout,"My second visit after several months. Awesome lamb! Great atmosphere and is well hidden. Lamb was perfectly done the way I wanted, goes very well with sauce and chickpeas. Fish was okay."
Def be back!,"Delicious middle eastern food, all dishes were presented beautifully and tasted as good as they looked. To die for especially their grape pie dessert just yum! Highly recommend."
Great food and Service,"Visited Artichoke for early lunch on a Saturday. Quite a few choices so went with sampler and was delighted by what we saw and tasted.

We were served the a Bag of bread, hummus, chipotle Babaganoush, Crab Borani and we were blown away. The tastes were simply delighful, well rounded and balanced with good use of lime or lemon. Next came the salad, grilled pork jowl, roasters cauliflower Mandi, Harissa Prawn & fried Chicken.

The roasted cauliflower was finely charred with settled on basmati rice. Don‚Äôt miss the other ingredients inside the rice.
The Chicken was moist and succulent. The Prawns were tasty mixing well with the green split cream & lemon.

For desert we had date pudding and cots & cream. The smoke taste matches extremely well with the nuts and coffee. The yuzu-chamomile pudding was light, refreshing and complemented well by the apricots.

The staff were also attentive and we did find some time to have a conversation them. (A note to those who find restaurant staff unfriendly or unapproachable- smile more and be nicer to them. Some of them had a long day)

Will we come back again? Certainly and will bring friends and family!"
Delicious Huge Portions,"I came here with two friends for lunch and ordered the $68.00 chef's tasting menu. There was so much food included inlcuding dips, mezze, shakshouka eggs, fried chicken, prawns and the highlight which was the slow roasted lamb.

The location is a little oasis in the middle of the bustling city, you are walking next to anonymous grey buildings one minute and turn a corner and you are in a green courtyard that makes you forget where you are.

Looking forward to returning to try more of the menu. Ate so much at lunch here that I was too full to eat anything for dinner."
Delicious balance of flavours with lots of textures,"Had the Chef‚Äôs tasting menu as it was our first visit.

Our favourite definitely the Harissa Prawns. One of the Best prawns I ever had... up there with Cervejaria Ramiro‚Äôs Carabineiros

Other dishes we really love were the hummus , crab tzatziki, grilled asparagus & date pudding. The salad dishes were really tasty and full of textures too considering it‚Äôs vegetables

Somehow the beef and lamb were not mind blowing which was a bit surprising as the other dishes had far exceeded our expectations..... the thing about beef / lamb I still like the quality of the meat to be the main star and shine through

Overall.. excellent experience and will definitely go again to try other dishes and some of our favourites as well. Watch Netflix Somebody Phil Feed season 4 Singapore episode and the restaurant is featured towards the end"
"A couple of highs but really, the food isn't great at all","The hummus, the baba ganoush and the date pudding were all DELICIOUS! Really, really good but sadly, everything else was only ok at best and the lamb and beef dishes were simply badly cooked.

The wine list is useless and the bottled cocktails, well, there's nothing to them and we had to add spirits to them to make them taste worthwhile.

It's a shame as the location is pretty nice but I certainly wouldn't recommend having dinner there, perhaps popping in for some dips and a beer alone would make sense when passing (yeah right!) but given the way Singapore is nowadays, it really isn't likely that we will ever return to something as mediocre as Artichoke."
Romantic Dinner in an Exotic Garden,"Off the beaten track, tucked behind an artsy photographic studio is this idyllic haven serving exotic Middle Eastern delights with an updated twist! Must try the falafel salad, Syrian egg skillet, 12hr cooked lamb, date pudding & roasted grape pie."
"The ambience is great, the food not at all!","The ambience is great, the restaurant is super cute and chill, but the food isn‚Äôt good at all... I wouldn‚Äôt go back... :("
Nice place for a hangout meal,First time to Bjorn Shen quirky restaurant. Great ambience for a hangout. Meals are more Lebanese. Good won't say great. As its a fusion on Lebanese meals. Recommended. Pricy thou.. Good service.
Mediocre food & TERRIBLE Service!,"Booked a table in advance for my wife‚Äôs birthday with her close friend who is heavily pregnant. Had asked for a comfortable table and a cake/dessert with a candle.

Table given was poor with seats lacking back support for my wife‚Äôs pregnant friend. No attention paid to my request that it was my wife‚Äôs birthday.

Very mediocre food and unfriendly service.

Can NOT recommend. Many other good restaurants such as Beirut Grill etc. This place is completely overrated!"
"Good food, could be better","Love middle eastern food, especially after a short stint in Dubai. Was finally craving some and I read about Artichoke, so here‚Äôs a summarized review

Hummus & Baba Ganoush - Very good, flavorful and simple, bread goes well with it although their bread was nothing to rave about - Came cold in a bag.

Roasted Cauliflower - Slightly charred on the outside with spices sitting on kale and topped with chermoula yogurt, it was very delicious. The taste completely overpowered the kale though, couldn‚Äôt taste any kale, but still one of the best dishes of the meal.

Haloumi Shakshuka - Nothing to shout about as it wasn‚Äôt very tasty, will not order this again.

Charcoal Chicken - Arrived looking like the cantonese soy sauce chicken. Had a nice smokey taste to it, and it was well cooked- the breastmeat was juicy.

Slow-Roasted Lamb Shoulder - Very tender and cooked to a crisp on the edges for some added texture. Apart from the typical ‚Äúlamby‚Äù taste, nothing much else do it, simple but delicious.

Green Harissa Prawns - Was recommended this but unfortunately the prawns were overcooked, the flesh sticking to the shell, wasn‚Äôt very juicy on the bite either. The sauce was incredible though, what a waste of prawn!

Roasted Grape Pie - Incredible! The whipped and light labneh on top of the crumbly pie was such a complement. Best dish of the entire meal here."
Love this restaurant!,"I have been working in Singapore for almost two years and it was one of my fav places to have dinner with friends and colleagues. Easy place and very well cooked dishes, nice location."
Pretty cool little joint,"Had a group dinner here recently which was also our first time at Artichoke. Will definitely be back. It‚Äôs a bit of hidden gem in Singapore, tucked away in the city with a low key vibe, solid menu and drinks list. Great for groups out on a night in the city. Worth adding to your list."
Fantastic food and flavour in a funky setting,"There is a great range of food, however we had to try the sharing meal, the lambgasam.....with name like that how can you say no. It was fantastic, perfectly seasoned and tender. So many of the dishes looked amazing so ther would be something for everyone"
Creative Middle Eastern food :),"Decided to try Sunday brunch at the place after hearing so many good reviews. Love the place: big and spacy and relaxing, a good place for chilling. Ordered Cauliflower Kushari, Crispy lamb floss and Shakshuka with Haloumi cheese. Really enjoyed the refreshing taste of Shakshuka, love the hummus that come with crispy lamb dish. But the one impressed me the most was the Cauliflower rice. How can rice+veg taste so good? Changed my perception of middle eastern food! Price is on the high side, as indicated on their site, expect $40-$60 a head. Suggest to try at least once"
Great food. Terrible attitude of servers.,I was going to rate this excellent. But the billing process and booking process totally made my blood boil!. First they said they didnt have the reservation which was clearly presented on my phone. Anyway after an unpleasant 15 minutes we did get a table and all was forgotten. We enjoyed the food. But when the bill came we realized we were overcharged by almost 100 dollars! But when we tried to clarify the servers were so arrogant and started counting glasses on our table . It was the most humiliating and disgusting restraunt experience of my life. They realized they had made a mistake but were totally not apologetic. So much arrogance. Never coming back here. !
Chef's Tasting Menu - superb!,"Delicious food, great value! The fact that it has been around for nine years show in the quick, seamless presentation and the beautifully done items. Bread, hummus, lamb, prawns, haloumi, all delicious. The chicken was a tad dry could have been more moist.

Lovely malabi and date pudding provided a nice ending to the meal."
One of our favourite restaurants,We love this place - the atmosphere is nice and relaxed and the food is always delicious! Well worth a visit!
Stunning food. Really tasty,Stunning food. Really tasty and authentic. In a tucked away but great location in a busy neighbourhood. Staff really friendly also. This was our favourite place to eat during our time in Singapore for 3 days. So fresh and healthy also.
Amazingly delicious Mediterranean Food,"Celebrated my husband advance birthday here last night with my Mum in-law we enjoyed the food, very delicious food and love that Date pudding that I ordered as surprise for my husband as his cake Thank you! Chai Yi for your excellent service. We will definitely go back next time. Highly recommended!"
next level Mediterranean,"Every dish here from the meat dishes to the cauliflower salad was amazing. Great, fun service staff. The lambgasm and beefgasm were heaven! We had our holiday work dinner here and could not have picked a better place."
Nice food in beautiful atmosphere,The food is very good and fusion. The atmosphere is pretty. But it is quite warm inside and outside. Cannot stay too longer if you want to chat more.
Flavorful and fun,"Located in a courtyard behind an old church, Artichoke is a casual, excellent restaurant. We ate outside on the patio on a beautiful tropical evening, with the outdoor fans providing a welcome breeze. The hummus, lamb, curried prawns, and cauliflower were so flavorful I wanted to keep eating even after I was full. A bag of bread is literally a brown paper bag of warm bread absolutely necessary for sopping up all the intriguing sauces. The waiters were friendly and welcoming. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and the comfortable ambiance. I highly recommend this place."
"Great Middle Eastern food,","Great Middle Eastern food, sat outside in the courtyard, Ronnie looked after us and recommended the chefs tasting menu which was superb and the food kept on arriving. Ronnie also recommended a great Shiraz that wasn‚Äôt on the wine list. Great food, service and atmosphere"
Good food in [ almost ] hidden place near Bugis,"I love the food selection in this restaurant!
YOU MUST BOOK this place in advance if you want the best seat.

I will go for their hummus and the quails as well as the pink beetroots items.

You may want to ask first if they are lactose free for lactose intolerance like myself.
Worse case you will have to provide your own medication before you come to this place like myself so I can enjoy everything.

It was raining so some of the table do get wet.

I am just hoping they were more lactose intolerant friendly menus next time!"
Good service & ambience. Portion wise a letdown,"Service and ambience was great. There was a change in menu items since I visited in July 2019. Taste of food ordered was great, unfortunately, big letdown by the portion sizes and price. For example, S$38 for four medium sized Harissa prawns is just too pricey and around S$28 for 2 crab paste on toasted bread, which were smaller than the palm of my hand."
A gem,"Have to confess first visit for me.

The indoor seating is limited, so if you need aircon, you need to book early. The service staff was friendly and helpful.

The bread was excellently in mopping up all the sauces. Hummus was excellent, the cauliflower bowl was really good. Hard to be tasty and good for you. prawns not Mediterranean but coated in great sauce with caramelised onions. Slow roasted Lamb was also excellent. The haloumi cheese was great paired with jackfruit, now that‚Äôs really fusion. The menu was full of interesting options, will be back.

Parking is doeable on Waterloo street but also easy to get to by MRT."
Fine dining quality in a relaxed setting,"We went on a Saturday night. Very busy restaurant, book ahead. We went for the set menu which I would highly recommend. Very creative dishes served in a timely manner. Definitely will be going back for more. Staff were excellent."
Creative Middle Eastern fusion food,"This restaurant serves middle eastern food with a twist. We orders four dishes: sea asparagus with labneh, hummus with mushroom, grilled halloumi cheese and lamb. The food was mostly good. Not the typical middle eastern food taste though. The hummus was a letdown because it was a bit watered down. The food was a bit pricey."
"Always good, great value.","The perfect environment for a casual meal in the heart of Singapore. Listen to the staff as they provide excellent information for a well balanced meal. Whether it's a full dinner or a casual shared meal, Artichke is the perfect solution."
Modern Mediterranean,"After a weekend of eating deliciously authentic Lebanese in KL I visited Artichoke. Initially I was annoyed by the menu as the menu advertised traditional items (hummus, shawarma, etc) with non-traditional ingredients; however, I was pleasantly surprised and satisfied by the flavours of what we ordered‚Äîgreen Harissa prawns, fried cauliflower salad, and hummus with spiced mushrooms. I‚Äôd say be open-minded and give it a go."
"Amazing Food, Even Better Service",I continue to return to Artichoke for its delicious food and friendly service. This is one of the top restaurants in Singapore.
Awesome supper !,"I rarely leave reviews despite all my best intentions, but after our meal today I felt it would be a shame not to share this gem. Food was way beyond our expectations, from tasty duck hummus to light and tangy tabouleh and decadent date pudding. Sure, as other reviews say, not the cheapest, but one of our favorite places in Singapore so far. Great friendly service, cool atmosphere with the lighted seating outside. Great vegetarian options if that‚Äôs your thing. Highly recommend !"
Incredible food,"My husband and I went to artichoke expecting good food but we were pleasantly surprised to find it surpassed our high expectations. We found it fairly reasonably priced, the atmosphere was social and buzzing and the staff were eager to help and knowledgeable. I would go again and again. I only regret not buying the cookbook. An absolute must if in Singapore for even one night."
"At last, service","I have to admit I have become slightly jaded eating out in Singapore. Overpriced food that is underwhelming, ideas and concepts poorly executed or identikit menus and shoddy service. Artichoke was a refreshing change. Service was quick and observant - it was always easy to get someone‚Äôs attention and the follow ups were swift. The ambience was great, people seemed happy to be there (and working there). We hovered up every bit of food - it was all delicious.

Sure, it‚Äôs not the cheapest. But I don‚Äôt mind that if I am enjoying all of the above!"
A hidden jewel,"Had an amazing dinner w friends there . We had a selection of appetizer and mains and JSU couldn‚Äôt decide which was our favorite . I would go for hummus and beat root dip, couscous salad, Arabic rice , ribs , beef and fish. And the icing on the cake was the blood orange ice cream . Can‚Äôt wait to come back"
"Heavy, oily",If you like really heavy food this is for you. We eat Lebanese all the time and this is a weird interpretation. Very busy as well.
Best meal we‚Äôve had as a family in Singapore,"Unbelievable- just so impressive, authentic and delicious. Owner is heading to Sydney for a trial with this amazing outfit, we hope they receive the accolades they deserve. Sensational"
Amazing food,Very well served and the service is probably the best we‚Äôve had in long time. The details provided and even stories to the ingredients and recipes is amazing. The food is comfort food and one to come back for. Definitely recommended
Wonderful tasty food,"The great atmosphere, tasty veggie food to share. It is quite expensive ($155 for 3 adults), but we so enjoyed our meal. Thank you"
Excellent food and great service,"We were lucky to get a table late in the evening, the service was fast and very friendly. Loved the food."
Nice !,"Very tasty modern Middle Eastern dishes ,beautifully presented . Service is friendly and personal. We went for dinner and the ambience was cozy. A nice place to bring someone on a first date , you won‚Äôt go wrong üòä"
Very disappointing and expensive,"The food isn‚Äôt good. Hummus, Babaganoush, Beetroot Borani starters were all ok but boring. Serving 4 pieces of haloumi to a table of 5 diners was a small oversight, compounded when the only solution was to buy another plate of haloumi for $22 when we asked for one more piece. Use of samphire was innovative but hard to taste as the other ingredients overpowered the subtlety of the plant‚Äôs delicate flavor. The Jerusalem salad was drenched in a sweet thousand island like dressing and inedible.

We specifically asked for nothing deep fried, so were surprised when deep fried ribs were served. I suspect the fried cauliflower was also deep-fried. The host graciously took the deep fried food off the bill, thank you, but seemed quite annoyed about the feedback.

The host wouldn't allow us to split a bill between 3 cards and said we should have read the restaurants T&C‚Äôs was a bit rude. It felt like our feedback on the food was not taken in the spirit of helpfulness that was meant.

I‚Äôve posted photos of our mains that we didn‚Äôt eat. Our food looks very different to other pictures so maybe the restaurant has changed hands or chefs.

Also, the wine list is very short and every wine we had was the ‚Äòlast bottle‚Äô.

I think the mistake we made was having the host select our food as it didn‚Äôt feel like we had some of the best this restaurant offered and that‚Äôs in the other photos here on TA.

I would not recommend this restaurant - it's expensive for poor food - and will definitely not be going back."
It was ok middle eastern food,"I had office party here and i just knew that i‚Äôm not much a fan of this restaurant and their food. Tho the service was excellent and their caramel ice cream is saving the day that time. The food are just not my favourite things, i don‚Äôt know what else to say."
"Extremely unpalatable, almost inedible food","The place is done up well and has a good vibe to it but the food was not good, to the point of being inedible. The menu was extremely limited and within those limited options also the food was so insipid."
I would definitely go back again!,Food was good! Price is reasonable!!!! Great ambience for families and friends. There are so many other dishes that I want to try out!
Definite Drop in Quality,"I'd been to Artichoke a couple of times before and totally enjoyed the food then. This time, however was very different. We had a Shakshouka, Fried Eggs with Dukkah, and the Pistachio-Pesto Pizza. The Shakshouka was truly dreadful - there was an extraordinary overdose of Cinnamon and whole spices, which masked any semblance of taste or texture. The Pizza was just about tolerable, but again, barely any flavour. The only saving grace was the Eggs with the Dukkah - the spice blend was just right. Very, very disappointing in all."
4th time at Artichoke,"I love this place - relaxed vibe, cool staff, great drinks menu and the food ..... wow the food! I‚Äôve now bought 2 sets of friends here and they‚Äôve both independently said it‚Äôs the best food they‚Äôve had in Singapore!"
Was expecting better,"With such a small weekend menu we were expecting to be blown away by hearty, tasty, original food. But sadly we had over cooked, tasteless fare and less than adequate service. Such a shame as I was really looking forward to loving this place, but we won‚Äôt be going back."
EXCELLENT,This is my second visit to Artichoke. Food served are very innovative. Reasonable Pricing. Staff are friendly and attentive. We love the ambience of the eatery and is situated in a good locality. Will not hesitate to recommend friends to patronize.
"Great hummus, fried chicken & green machine pizza!","Loved the fried chicken drumsticks with za'atar honey - sucha great complement! Burnt miso hummus was great at usual.

Special this week was the green machine pizza - packed with herbs, with za'atar, mint, dill, spring onions & abalone mushrooms. Lived up to its name; a refreshingly different pizza & would recommend.

The Jerusalem salad and the pork ribs (w/ mentaiko yogurt) was a bit of a disappointment though. Loved the ambience; I kinda miss falafels - can we have these sometime soon?"
"Great Mediterranean cuisine, in a casual setting","Had an enjoyable dinner , which started with hummus & bread. The pork sampler & cauliflower salad was very good. Finished with a baklava pudding which was delicious.
The place is busy , but has a nice casual vibe, as the restaurant opens up onto a cosy courtyard. Service is friendly, especially the manager , who is knowledgeable & ever ready to recommend beers & wines.
Recommended."
Quality Mediterranean,"Good experience from food to wait staff. Our fave - fried cauliflower, the hummus and fresh homemade bread"
Price doesn‚Äôt meet the quality,It was taste food but prices are too high for that place and that raw materials of food. Staff was not that friendly that they could be. Nice to visit but I would not visit twice.
Yummy!,"Food was good, portions abit small although they were meant to be for sharing. Staff were friendly and attentive. Haloumi is good we ordered it twice"
we love artichoke!,"FANTASTIC FOOD. Artichoke breaks the gastronomic mold every time. Singapore's cafe scene is thoroughly saturated, restaurants pop up every month. This means my girlfriends and I rarely visit the same place twice. Artichoke, however, is the one place we return to year after year. We love your food and your take-no-nonsense attitude, chef bjorn!"
A different experience,"Located within walking distance of Bugis or Bencoolen MRT on Middle Street, you can miss it easily unless you look slightly inside the sidewalk. Please make reservation (we had to wait an hour). It is not the swanky type of restaurant. Seating outside and inside. Inside also it is not cool. Old furniture. Service slow (because they are very busy). It looks more like a bar and cafe. But all drawbacks are made up by the excellent food. Beer is very expensive and small mug. A variety of drinks are available. But for the excellent Mediterranean food, pita bread and falafal are not available. But good in-house made bread is served. Portions are small and shareable. Go to this place only if you have plenty of time on hand."
One of the worst service I experienced in Singapore,I lived in SG for 3 years and this was by far a shocking experience. I asked for the steak and when it came it was unchewable. I called the waiter to him and he asked me ‚Äú well how big did you cut the pieces?‚Äù I was shocked since I obviously had meat before and thankfully know how to eat. The rest of the food was ok but there was no effort to make our experience pleasant and no apology for tge waiter‚Äôs attitude. It used to be a nice place but no the service bad
"Good food, lousy service","As always, the food is great. It used to have great welcoming service. It's gone down a lot however. Picture groups of service staff chatting amongst themselves or playing on their phones rather than looking to service customers. Even when they do come to you, it feels like they're doing you a favour. Pity because the food is good."
Still as good,"First visit was several years ago, and quite refreshing that the 8year old restaurant has maintained its standards. service is well above Singapore average, pricing is decent. We pre ordered the Lambgasm, that is a LOT of meat but well worth it. The dips were excellent as usual but overall just love the ambience of the place, warm, welcoming, unpretentious. great place for friends to meet overgood food and better conversation"
Good food but pricey,"The environment are good. I like the limitd choice of menu, it make the customers have a chance to try all. The food was great just too pricey especially for the vege type. The resto is seem like hiding behind the church so try not to miss it."
Best brunch in Singapore,"Awesome seasonal food, completely unpretentious yet incredibly flavourful. A highly curated and playful menu with generous portions. Coffees were perfect, food was fresh and baklava pie for dessert had the perfect ratios of pastry, pistachio and honey. We will be back. Many times."
"Good food, a bit expensive","Nice selection of food, most of the dishes are amazingly tasty. It is however a bit overpriced (e.g. 40 dollars for a dish with 5 shrimps). Drinks are not that amazing neither. But overall, it's a very good restaurant!"
Excellent as usual,"Fantastic food, service with a smile - plus now with an extended bar and drinks options. Artichoke beats out the competition as usual."
Seriously yummy,"The food was outstanding, not a big choice but it was great! The place is quite hidden from the main street so it makes it even more romantic."
Good food but pricey,"Dips, hot fresh bread, salads, and mains were all really tasty. The wait staff was attentive and professional. However, I still can't get over the prices here in Singapore for a casual dinner. $38++ for four prawns. Really?"
Quality Food,"There's something for everyone at Artichoke. When our table of 8 was asked what everyone's favourite dish was, everyone pointed to their own favourite.

[SHARING PLATES]
I'm not someone who usually focuses much on appetizers, but this Fabulous Four were quite divine. Anti-clockwise from bottom left:

The Teriyaki Babaganoush ($8++) was my favourite - slightly smokey yet creamy, I couldn't stop swiping it with the awesome hot bread that was served together with our appetizers. #buaypaiseh

Me having a favourite isn't to say that the rest aren't good. They are. & so is the bread. It's so dangerous when the bread is good because you can't stop eating it with everything. & by you, I actually mean me.

I also loved the Iraqi Spiced Mushrooms ($12++); the heap of juicy mushrooms came piled on a bed of fried egg puree (interesting eh!), topped with a bit of shaved parmesan. This was one of the lighter flavoured appetizers, but the earthiness of the mushrooms made it very enjoyable.

I grew up eating homemade Spinach dip, so the Ispanak ($12++) was nostalgic in a somewhat familiar way, even though the one I grew up with wasn't specifically Middle Eastern. Its slight tangyness sets it apart from the other 3 appetisers on the table. The Spinach was chopped finely enough to not choke you to death, but retained enough texture for a good chew.

Last but certainly not least - the Burnt Miso Hummus ($8++) is a lovely twist on the traditional chickpea hummus by with miso, blackcurrants & walnuts, but still staying true to what it is.

The Mentaiko Taramasalata ($18++) is a luscious cod roe dip with a side of delightfully smokey charcoal-fired garlic bread. To my uneducated self, this was expectedly very fishy (because of the roe) but still enjoyable. However, I learned that traditionally, it's supposed to be even fisher! You learn something new every day.
[MAIN COURSES]
The simple, unassuming Shish Taouk ($24++) is a traditional chicken kebab that looks quite ordinary. But damn, when I bit in - the chicken was tender & flavourful, which is how meats should be done, really. I get annoyed when chicken is too dry; this was anything but. Yum!

BJ‚Äôs Favourite Steak ($36++), a plate of 300g of lean Australian beef flank, looked super delicious, & it was. Unfortunately, the texture was a little too chewy for my liking, but thumbs up for the great flavours especially with the za'atar butter & huge soft cloves of garlic.

The Iberico Pork Collar ($34++) surprised me with its perfect meat-to-fat ratio, & the Coca-Cola caramel sauce was a balanced level of sweet. I liked this grilled spanish pork dish very much because it simply just melts in your mouth & makes you so happy. Not something you'd hear often from me about my least favourite meat. This is really special.

Artichoke's signature slow cooked lamb shoulder, cheekily called The Lambgasm ($220++), feeds 5 or more. It's a whole roasted bone-in lamb shoulder that is MASSIVE & requires a 48-hour advanced order. While the meat was tender & fall off the bone, I felt that this dish mostly all about the theatrics; in terms of flavour, I preferred the Lamb Adana, which had a stronger lamb flavour. This, of course, is personal preference, seeing as to how many people don't actually enjoy the lambyness of lamb. But if you are looking for a show & you have a good number of people to split this between, you could give it a shot.

The Lamb Adana ($28++) is definitely in my top few favourites - a Turkish lamb kebab so juicy & moist, paired with Pistachio yogurt & mint that calmed the explosion of lamby goodness in my mouth as I chewed on with a smile on my face.

Surprisingly, despite the red meat galore in front of me, my favourite dish was the Hot Skillet Prawns ($38++) - in my opinion, this is pricey. BUT the plump prawns & delicious green harissa flavours more than make up for the splurge. We used the extra bread we had left to greedily soak up the delicious zhup. Very drool worthy - I would order this again on a fancy night out.

[DESSERTS]
Chocolate is not my go-to flavour, but the Chocolate Pie ($5++) impressed me. Everyone's face lit up upon tucking in to this oozy chewy goodness, & ended up raving about it It was recommended we pair this with the Sea Salt Burnt Honey Soft Serve, which was excellent because I felt the soft serve was too icy on its own to enjoy, but with the chocolate pie, it was a party in my mouth.

We each got a Baklava Croissant ($7++) to take home, which was such a thoughtful gesture by Artichoke because it's like they predicted, wait no-- they ENSURED we were super well fed. Baked fresh daily, if you are afraid this will be crazy saccharine sweet like actual baklava, fear not. It isn't! Not even after Bjorn drizzled some orange blossom honey over it & then a bit of powdered sugar.

I honestly don't know about eating this as dessert, but I had it with a good cup of coffee for breakfast the next morning"
Interesting Middle Eastern food,Really nice meal here and a change from Chinese food. The owner paid us a lot of attention and explained how they operate - often visiting other countries to seek inspiration for new dishes. Small menu but everything is tasty.
Great food - eat where the locals eat!!,The dips are really good a great place to eat and the service was excellent. The restaurant is rustic with a comfy feel. The lamb was delicious as was each dish we were served. Booking is essential for this spot and definitely worth a visit.
Service can be improved,Food is great but service is meh. Waitress refused to change seats for me when i didnt want the table with the sun shining directly. Tables under opaque shelter were mostly unoccupied. Left without ordering
Middle eastern delight!,"Great food - all the dips - baba ghanoush , hummus, Mammarara , beetroot were delicious. Cauliflower fatoosh was interesting . The lamb was outstanding . It would be great if they could add a few vegetarian mains. Wonderful cocktails too - had the East side - a gin based cocktail. The $60++ min charge per person for a table of 10 is on the higher side as we struggled to finish it. Overall a delightful meal and would come here again"
Nice enough,The food here is good. Drink options are also good. Service ranges from good to just okay. The place is not very comfortable though. They can probably do with a bigger place.
"Nice venue, good food",Great quiet spot to meet up with friends or go on a date. Its a great spot for alfresco dining. Food was very good.
Consistency is key,"Artichoke never disappoints. We have been here at least 4 times and we always leave feeling satisfied.

This time we had the crispy kingfish collar and it was yummy-licious! We also had the kale salad, Turkish bread and a couple of other dishes. All was great!

What draws us back again and again is the chill out environment. When the weather is cool, it‚Äôs really nice sitting outside enjoying the evening. Indeed, if you still have room left after the meal, a proper lollipop is in the order!"
Fab food in chillaxed cool environment,"A place to eat with friends, if possible order many dishes to share. Must make reservation, and its a lunch / brunch place.
I love the atmosphere, the service and attitude of the people working there, as well as the yummy food and drinks. It really has it all. Its that comfort food in a way, yet its discovery of tastes and presentation. Its art on the place. Its your place after a big party. Its your place to chill with friends, Its your place to get a nice brunch with mimosas. I've been twice, and a place to return to. Also got the cooking book last time, just to remind me of the place! Keep it up!"
Good atmosphere excellent food,"Great atmosphere here, along with a good food and drinks on an innovative menu. Really nice place for a evening meal"
Fabulous food in a fun atmosphere,"Invited by a friend for dinner here, my husband and I were delighted at finding this gem of a restaurant! Given that we love middle eastern food and that we are vegetarian, this place was very well chosen for us.

Situated in an ""off the beaten track"" garden several meters off of the street, the outside seating is made up of picnic tables, providing a casual and relaxed feeling. Service was attentive and pleasant, always on the ready to refresh drinks or take more menu orders.

And then there was the food. Oh my! We ordered a variety of dishes, and every one was perfection. Special mention go to the muhammara and hummus dipping sauces, and our hands-down favorite, the tabbouleh. All were excellent but don't give the tabbouleh a miss.

The only potential ""downer"" was that we found the portion size of the dips a bit small... not really enough for four people. So, we had to order more.

Drinks menu was nice, too, although the quantity of cocktail you get for the price is a little lacking. A nice wine menu made up for it, though.

We would go back again, for sure. An excellent choice!"
Great food as always,Love their appetizers and salad selection. Wished the grilled sea bass was still available but it wasnt as they change their menu regularly. Other favs include the grilled prawns.
Always a good option,"Consistently delicious and great service. The cauliflower is great, the music is great, is an all round winner"
Arty shiok!,"Artichoke is definitely an unusual and unique restaurant in Singapore worth visiting.

First, it is situated at an interesting part of Singapore: junction of Middle Road and Waterloo Street or heart of, not just one, but three arts schools! It is tucked behind at a courtyard of a former small church and now Objectifs Gallery. If I recall correctly, they don‚Äôt even have a signboard such that you may not even know there‚Äôs a restaurant there!

The venue is very rustic with both indoor and courtyard seating; under trees if you wish. They say they are a funky Middle Eastern restaurant. I don‚Äôt recall funky music and surely, they don‚Äôt smell funky. In fact, the food smells and tastes very good. Their food plating‚Äôs rustic in keeping with their surroundings and hence fashionably funky I deduce.

My colleague and I had the smoked salmon dip and caramelized cauliflower to start. Then continued to share mains of fried brussels sprouts (I love it when they do interesting things to vegetables besides raw salads) and grilled chicken skewers.

The other meat dishes sound really yummy especially if there‚Äôs a larger group to share with. Speaking of which, what caught my eye in the menu was the Lambgasm: a whole lamb shoulder for five to share, 48 hours‚Äô notice needed and costs $220. So next time you are looking for a feast for a large family or office outing ‚Ä¶ but remember to order the Lambgasm in advance.

The service was very friendly and attentive. I do wonder if some of them could be arts school students to add to the funky if not creative atmosphere. What was also eclectic was the waitress serving us was from Taiwan: a Taiwanese working in Singapore serving Middle Eastern food!

I must add that the only disappointment I had with Artichoke was the absence of artichokes in their menu."
