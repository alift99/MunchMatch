Love the food and great service!,Appreciate Vanesa and Ji Hong who attended as when I had dinner with my friends ! They were efficient and very accommodating !
Great place with splendid food and service,Great Food. Every dish from starter through the main course to dessert was an unforgettable experience. The waiter was absolutely caring to each and everyone and the service was timely and excellent.
Wedding anniversary dinner,"Came with our lil one and service was great, colour pencils given to entertain our lil one! Food was great and we truly enjoyed our experience! Our server Razif and all the other servers were helpful and made the experience even better! Our wedding anniversary was lovely thanks to the hyatt!"
Disappointing,"Our visit to the the restaurant was utterly terrible. The customer service at the entrance to the restaurant was handled poorly. Despite having a 4 seat table available, he provided a confusing explanation as to why he could not just add 1 more seat for our family of 5. Certainly expect more from a 'high end restaurant'."
Precious Family brunch time! ❤️❤️❤️,"Great food, great surrounding and friendly staff and excellent service by Samuel one of the staff assist Us all the way through, this is not the first time we visit Grand Hyatt Mezza9 however every time we are here, Samuel service is the best. He’s very friendly and love the way he showed his hospitality. ***** ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Thank you very much Mezza9"
Brunch,I had brunch with my family and my girlfriend and the waiter Asif provided us with excellent hospitality! Thank you Asif!
Wonderful,My family of 6 had dinner at Mezza9 to celebrate husband’s birthday. Great ambience and nice food. Pleasantly surprised with a treat of a mini birthday cake and a tiramisu. The dessert platter that we ordered was elegantly presented with dry ice. Great service from waiter Razif which made our dining experience wonderful. Will return for future dining. May try their private dining room next.
Good and bad,Good: The food and the accommodating allowing to use the table even after over time. Bad: Staff champagne pouring skill need to be improve.
Brunch,The service by the waiter Shah was great. He really took care of us and made sure that we felt really well taken care of. Good brunch!
Dining time too short,Service and food was okay. The seafood platter for 2 was abit small and only half a lobster given. Dining time was only limited to 1h 15mins which was too short! We couldn’t even enjoy the expensive bottle of wine that we bought. Staff kept on hinting to us to leave for the next dine in slot which really hampered our experience.
Great and wonderful experience,Have a great and personalised service from Rizafi. He is so welcoming and try his best to use dialect to communicate with my mum. Great service staff. The food are great too. Love the wok hey hor fun and the sashimi salad!
Standard has dropped at Mezza9,"It has been a while since I last visited Mezza9. Sad to say, the standard has dropped. Food is pricey, including charging $2 for warm water?! We had to remind the waiter a couple of times for mustard. The steak we ordered was average (portion is quite small), more lukewarm than warm, and caused us $40++ including an appetizer of 3 small crab cakes. The best food was the french fries. Otherwise, this place is overly hyped. Will not return."
Compliment of Staff- Loges,Compliments to Staff Loges who was most attentive and cheerful when we dined there. Loved the ambience too.
"Mezza9, singapore","The food and service is excellent at M9.
All the staff there are very polite and well trained.
The staff that served us was Mr Shah. He is extremely knowledgeable on wines and recommended the wine did an excellent selection.
We all enjoyed our dinner on 02Mar2022."
Good food and service,"The food was good, service was excellent as well. We were served by Mr Vesalan and he was very helpful and gave us great recommendations for our party of 3 and was attentive throughout! Had a great experience overall."
Perfect Sunday Brunch - wonderful service!,"Excellent Sunday brunch with huge choice of dishes for all tastes. We loved the seafood choices including lobster, shrimp and oysters. Deserts to die for too! Bottomless champagne and excellent white wine made it a great fun Sunday afternoon. Special thanks to Anthony for the excellent attentive service and for making our celebration brunch very special!"
Good service,Excellent service by our waiter Shah who was keen and knew our taste for dinner and drinks. One of the best lava cakes and desert
Sunday Brunch,"A great chilled Sunday brunch, food was amazing and i liked the fact you can browse within Covid rules the food at each station rather than just a menu order.
Staff especially Andrew gave great service, I would recommend for people to chill eat and relax."
Best service by Rasif,We had our dinner at Mezza9 and Rasif was very attentive. He was also very cheerful and crack some jokes too. It’s a pleasant to be served by him. Of course the food and ambient was great too.
Excellent service at Mezza9,Excellent service staff Shah (Mezza9) who gave good advise on selection of wines paired with meat platter.
"Great food, ambience and hospitality",Food was great - especially the crab cake and oysters. Even the mashed potatoes were delicious. I went with my family and we were all very well taken care of by Razif our waiter. Will definitely be back!
Must do brunch,"Went for bottomless brunch, and it’s totally free flowing. Food is fab, can’t say enough about the sushi/sashimi and, specifically, the dessert which was unbelievably good. Thanks to Shah, Loges and the team for looking after us so well. Despite us going during covid times we loved this gem."
Wonderful lunch on 7th Feb,"It was wonderful lunch , we had beef steak and fish burger Food was nice but service was even better Thanks to Mr Shah ☺️ he was very friendly and attentive"
Good lunch visit,"The set lunches were great value for money and the service was impeccable. Special shout out to the server, Razif who was warm and friendly, and attended to our every needs! Will not to hesitate to visit again."
Good CNY meal,Excellent meal - great service by Vesalan. Very attentive to our needs and helpful. Good recommendation of dishes too.
Best Dining experience in Hyatt being served by Vesalan,"It was truly an amazing dining experience in Hyatt being served by a waiter named Vesalan.

He first asked what my friend and my specific diet was before he went on to introduce what was the specialties in the restaurant.

He also went the extra mile to ensure we were comfortable in our seatings and came by to make sure our meals were to our liking.

The personal touch he gave made the entire dining experience perfect. I strongly suggest dining at Hyatt’s mezza9 coz not only the food was great, the service was awesome.

Thank you Vesalan for your attentiveness and Hyatt for you having such a great staff around."
Excellent Service by Vesalan,"Mezz9 waiter, Vesalan, offered very professional service and offered good advice on menu choices. We truly enjoyed our lunch and with such excellent service, we will surely be back"
Dinner at Mezza9,"We had dinner at Mezza9 and was served by VESALAN. He was a wonderful waiter and helped us in our selection of the menu.
He was well versed in the dishes on the menu.
He was patient and polite and kept checking on us and making sure everything was ok.
It made our dinner at Mezza9 a joyful experience."
Excellent Buffet,"I have visited Mezza9 on several occasions before and during the pandemic. The buffet is managed extremely well while still maintaining COVID safety. The highlights of the Sunday Brunch was the seafood and sashimi, always a highlight of this buffet.

There were a few downsides when I compare it to the past. The free flow option used to include a gin room and cocktails which was pure heaven. Why are these wonderful drinks no longer possible? I'm on mourning for the gin room. That place was a vision of my heaven.

Also, free flow soft drinks are not part of the buffet which does not make sense. Orange juice and other soft drinks are not expensive, so why not include them in the buffet? They'll also fill people up and you'll save money on buffet.

Also, why not offer everyone a complementary glass of wine on arrival? Then, you're sure to get some converts to free flow! These ideas make money sense and you'll give customers a boost when they come to the buffet."
"Great Food, Great Service","Superb food, and great service. They served us a wrong dish, which was still cooked very well, let us have the dish, and continued to serve us the correct dish thereafter. No questions asked. Loved the service, the food, and the attention to detail. Will come back again."
Average,"Average service and food ! Mapo tofu was tasteless. Restaurant rung couple of times but unfortunately when i pick up call, line was dropped. When i finally call them back ; was totally surprised that restaurant mentioned that my reservation would b canceled if ive not call them back. Restaurant did not leave voicemail that if they didn’t hear frm me reservations will b cancelled. Totally unacceptable!"
Gr8 food & service,"Food was great and had great value, especially with DBS card. Most importantly, our waiter, Shah, had the best customer service - he was fast, attentive and had contagious joy. Would visit again! p.s. Shah very handsome ;)"
Christmas dinner with friends,The experience was good. The staffs are friendly and accomodating. Food is good but on the pricey side.
Dinner at Mezza9 - great as always,"Came for dinner and as always, the food was excellent, and the staff very attentive.. they made us feel very comfortable and we had a great meal... special mention to Ravi and Sam for impeccable service."
"Great food, great service","Hyatt never fail us. Food was great, had a steamed soon hock with jasmine rice for family and 4 course meal for myself. The server's service was excellent. Highly recommended ."
Family lunch,Special thanks to Sam for his wonderful service this afternoon. He was very patient and attentive to our needs. We had the 3 course set lunch and i particularly enjoyed the lamb with mint jelly and selection of desserts.
50th Anniversary Menu - Twice in 48 hours!,"The 50th anniversary menu at Mezza9 certainly triggered memories of yesteryears. The crafted combination of oysters, crab bisque, tenderloin (and definitely not missing out on the boston lobster) was a highlight. To join in Hyatt's celebration, we actually dined at Mezza 9 twice in 48hours!

On both nights, we had the pleasure of being waitered upon by jovial Sam. (We later learnt that your name was Sammy Octavio). Your efforts at ensuring guests are at ease and remembering our (or your regulars') preferences certainly did not go unnoticed. Your approach to exemplary service speaks volume of your dedication and hard work.

Here's wishing Sam, and all at Mezza 9, a happy and fruitful festive season ahead.

P/s. We are looking forward to your Festive 2021 menu"
Dinner with Family,Food was delicious. Sam was very helpful with the menu and recommended the dessert extravaganza. Did not disappoint. Service is top notch.
Excellent dinner,Came here for a family dinner. Ruby was the one who served us. Her service and knowledge of the menu were excellent. Well done Ruby!
Great thanksgiving experience,Been here twice for Thanksgiving dinner and always enjoy our dinning experience. Food was great and the staffs were friendly and attentive.
Excellent service,"Staff were very patient and friendly, special mention to Mr Mike for the extra hospitality and kindness he’s shown :) really made my family’s day ♥️"
Excellent service with delicious food,"Had the 50th anniversary special menu. Each course was served in portions that are just nice.

Fresh oysters to start the meal, rich lobster bisque, tenderloin/lobster prepared in the right doneness, and date pudding was well-matched by the accompanying cream and soft serve.

Very attentive service to attend to all needs promptly.

Must visit!"
Good Service,"The food is excellent, generous portions and great prices. Sam was very professional and friendly we were very happy with his service. Will definitely go back again."
Lunch for 2,"Good service, nice ambience, naisse desserts. We had lamb as the main, it was average. Water was at $2/pax and pot of tea was $5 for 2 cups. Reasonable. Lunch was good value at 50pct discount!"
Lovely lunch,"Good service and always nice atmosphere. The waiter recommendation was really good. I couldn't choose between pork ribs asian style or beef steak and he recommended rib which I really enjoyed. Lamb for my friend was too tough but it was the shoulder part.

Good value lunch with several sets to choose. There was also chope set to choose too with good deal."
Excellent food and service,Great steaks and good service. Especially liked the sourdough dip. Would come back again one day. Romantic atmosphere
"Come here hungry, left with a happy belly!","Was here to celebrate my birthday,
Got a steal using some dining vouchers from Grand Hyatt!

The 3 course lunch set was amazingly valued, had a USDA Ribeye steak that was perfectly medium rare..
(What is in that sauce for the fries, chef????)

And the deep fried barramundi had such a crazy good sauce, so much so we finished all of our rice!!

The service was great from start to end, everyone greeted with a smile and with the safety measures, it was great to see a full restaurant on a weekday, just like the good old times!
The lady even gave me an extra birthday cake on top of the ones from the courses!
Will definitely return!!"
Consistently High Service Level & Value for Money,"I’d written a review for Mezz9, Hyatt Hotel before and am compelled to post another review. We’re regular patrons and notice the consistently high level of service and value for money. It’s not the same with many F&B outlets, where the first visit sets high standards—usually because of an exceptional service staff/team—but subsequent visits prove a disappointment. But it’s not the case with Mezza9.

Today, Sunday 24 Oct 2021, my partner and I tried Mezz9’s brunch, which is available on weekends. This is our 3rd visit for brunch (we’ve dropped by for lunch during weekdays). The receptionist (unfortunately, we did not get the young man’s name) was attentive and set us at our table of choice.

Then came along Ravi—always lovely to have the staff remember us. He even remembered by partner’s favourite wine—Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand’s Marlborough country. He and an intern, a Singaporean lad from Temasek Polytechnic — his name was difficult to pronounce, but he gamely suggested with call him JQ—attended to all our needs. Excellent! Ravi and JQ.

The food—a semi buffet that came with a choice of main course—spoiled us with the quality, choice, and quantity. We went for the standard fare, which cost S$98.00 ++ per pax and also ordered a glass each of white wine—the Sauvignon Blanc—that went well with the seafood (lobster, sushi, and sashimi, and more). The lobsters were so fresh and crunchy; I went for seconds. LOL.

For the main course, we ordered Angus beef, which came complete with a selection of sides, for two to share. Be warned—the helpings are large. We ordered a glass each of Pinot Noir—our favourite red—that paired well with the beef. I’m sure Ravi has noted the wine. LOL. Then came the desserts. I went for the chocolate fondant and it is simply gorgeous and my partner ordered the cheese platter—it was a large cheese platter with generous cuts.

If you’re a wine drinker, you might consider the buffet brunch with free flow of wine, which costs S$158++ per pax.

A wonderful experience. We’ll be back!"
Excellent Service,It is a wonderful and pleasant experience... I have beenb a member (Club @ Hyatt) since 1996... their staffs have good knowledge of their food... excellent services provided by Loges and Ravi. Keep it up!
Thanks Sammy!,Food was great! Despite the increased prices! Service was awesome thanks loads Sammy for the great night!
Great Experience,"We dine in last Saturday for lunch and 
was amazed by the good food & also the terrific service provided by Andrew. He took good care of us & also willing to go the extra mile to ensure we had a good time. Gratitudes to Andrew and to the kitchen crew for the great overall experience. Well done Hyatt Singapore!!!!"
Excellent services by Loges,"Excellent services by Loges to go out of way to make a delightful dining experience. Attentive and not intrusive at all.
He also go the extra mile to delight my kids with the following
- providing a small cake for my elder boy when he know the birthday was just last week
- decorated my younger boy ice cream with candy floss and marshmallow to sweeten the treat"
Good service saved the day,"My friend and I visited the restaurant for lunch last Sat. We were crazy for their toasted sourdough with their special condiment. The first obstacle we faced were the staff at the reception who insisted we download the HealthHub app to prove our vaccination status (we were both Sinovac vaxed) although the MOH ruling was ‘produce hard copy of vaccine cert for those who were locally vaccinated’ if not using app. For elderly folks like us, we were fumbling and fidgeting with the download and accessing the cert. no help from the young staff who could help us navigate the process. In spite of showing the press report about vaccination acceptance by hard copy, they insisted TTS ‘MOH ruling’. We don’t want to go down that path so we’d complied. We had half the mind to go elsewhere but NCCC we soldiered on nonetheless.

Eventually after 15 min or so we successfully ‘cleared’ the obstacle and sat down but our mood were affected already. Then this young man by the b as me if Andrew appeared and pampered us with good service and our gastro mood were restored. Andrew was polite and accommodative throughout helping us with the menu and pandering to our numerous requests for this and that.

So kudo to Andrew and a message to the management: be kind to your elderly guests, stretch out a bit more to help them navigate this digital process and not just standing by and watch with disinterest. Plus, check the rules please"
Good food and Service,"Excellent food as usual… good selection of appetisers with caviar, sashimi and lobster. Our servers were friendly, competent and professional, especially Loges. All around, a good experience."
Excellent Service and Food,"A young boy by the name Andrew served us last night with an impeccable attention to detail and service throughout our experience at mezza 9. He is humble,sincere and approachable despite our numerous requests. A rare gem to have in any service industry and hope to have more staff with attributes like his!
Kudos to the chefs for the excellent food."
Lovely Sunday brunch for family!,"Decor was muted but elegant, so that the ladies could shine with their lovely outfits! Service by all staff was excellent. Food was value for money. The sashimi was fresh & delicious. Disappointed that the oysters couldn't make a show but my teenaged children enjoyed the replacement - caviar. The heritage tomatoes starter paired well the hummus base. The cold lobster and prawns were over-cooked unfortunately. The steaks were perfect and plating was delightful. Dessert-combo presentation was a lovely surprise with the dry ice effect.

Mr. Loges, our server was attentive, friendly, knowledgeable and helpful in recommending the main course and desserts.

Highly recommend this experience for families. There were vegetarian options but the stars were the seafood and steaks."
Thursday Lunch (Public Holiday),"I last wrote a review on 03 Jan 2021 – our first visit to Mezza9. Since then, my significant other and I had visited once. Thursday 13 May was our 3rd visit. Pleasantly surprised because not all F&B outlets live up to the expectations they create on the first visit. Consistent level of attention and service. Well done to Loges who took good care of us. As usual, we had a bottle of wine. A refreshing and subtle Sauvignon Blanc from our favourite wine country: Marlborough, New Zealand. I had a steak, done medium. Perfect and juicy. He had a chicken dish. The serving was a bit too heavy for him, as he is a weight watcher and long distance runner. I helped him to finish. LOL. He likes me fleshy and huggy. No pressure on me, and I don’t own a weighing scale. LOL. A great sit-down meal. If you want good value for money coupled with a lovely ambience and excellent service, head on to Mezza9 at the Grand Hyatt. BTW, if you drive, parking is free. Just ask for the complementary ticket."
Suggestions,"I lunched with my spouse, who is a vegetarian. The mains options for vegetarian is somehow limited.
The chef obliged with a serving of stirfried vegetables. I expected a colorful platter of a medley of vegetables with a serving of tofu for protein. The serving was a plate of only green vegetables."
Wonderful Dinner Celebration,We had a memorable dinner celebration in this restaurant. Sam who is our server was very attentive and helpful to us and even entertained us during the night and help us take photo. Wok fried lobster noodle and crab cake were our favorite. We got a cake in the end to celebrate the occassion.
Simply Amazing Evening,"Our waiter Sam was the star of the evening. We were here to celebrate our mother's birthday, and he made the evening a truly remarkable affair. He had such amazing energy right from the very start, making us laugh throughout the night, and was incredibly attentive and an absolute delight.

We had trouble deciding on a wine -- because we all had differing tastes, and he solved it by not only making excellent recommendations, but by bringing out tasters of the ones we had picked out to help us along. My 9 year old daughter was feeling left out, and he took it upon himself to bring out a sparkling strawberry mocktail so she could join in the toasting. I think he became her hero in that instant.

He remained attentive throughout the evening, checking on us constantly and replacing cutlery we had dropped before we even had to turn around to ask for one.

He was so patient in taking the perfect photo for my mum and surprised her with a cake and a candle!

The food was amazing, but the service made it truly stellar. We were were truly glad we had chosen Mezza9 to celebrate my mother's 64th birthday."
Always fabulous!,The set lunch is such great value for money and the selection is so big. It is a great place to go where you know the food will be great and the service is always warm and friendly.
Mezza9 @ grand Hyatt,"Went to mezza9 on 08/03/2021. I specifically want to praise the services of this waitress by the name of Su Jeong. She made my first visit not only a pleasant one but an unforgettable one as well. It was my birthday celebration and my friend specially booked this restaurant to celebrate with me. The moment I stepped in to this restaurant, I felt so comfortable with their atmosphere but hey that’s not all. Su jeong was accommodating, she helped us to change a table to a less noisy area and she was a very attentive person as well. She never failed to lend her hands out whenever we needed help or maybe i should said we never even have to call her for help and she spotted our needs with her sharp eyes. I have never been to a restaurant with such an attentive waitress and I will definitely be back because of the services and food. Thumbs up for mezza9 and keep up the standard!"
EXEMPLARY SERVICE BY ASIF!,Good service made a huge difference to a dining experience. We were gladly to be served by Asif. Attentive and friendly. Food was excellent except the sautéed mushrooms which were insanely salty. Everything else including still/sparkling water is free flow except the mains. Juice/soft drink/coffee/tea is limited to 2 servings per guest. I especially loved the roasted potatoes. Simple yet so good.
Mezza9 Champagne brunch buffet was amazing!,"The food was great and the ambience wonderful. Service was great and our waiter, Loges was very attentive and friendly. Was a nice Sunday afternoon."
Delicious Luncheon,Sam took very good care of us. Very enjoyable & slow paced-no rushed ordering. Food very fresh & delightful.
Hapoy Wednesday,"Best lunch ever, excellent service, Ruby and Nino are equally great in giving service, very accommodating and friendly Service from the heart, Thumbs up!!"
It could be better,"Just had Sunday buffet brunch here. Excellent service as usual but sadly the buffet menu has shrunken drastically. While I can understand the options would be reduced given the COVID situation, the limited food options led to a so-so average dining experience. It was not the Mezza9 that I remembered so vividly and looked forward to for a Sunday brunch.

Will be awhile before we come back. Do hope things get better. Realised I didn’t take much photos as I wasn’t impressed with the food."
Great Seafood Platter,"We have visited a few places for ""Sunday Brunch"" during the Covid19 period and I must say Mezza9 has got the best one by a mile. This was the second time back here. The ""Brunch"" is of course very different from the traditional ones before all the Covid restrictions but the Mezza9 menu and concept works. Good selection of food, well presented and delicious. Add the excellent service from Kevin and the rest of the staff to top of a perfect Sunday dining experience. We truly enjoyed our brunch and will for sure be back again."
Sunday Brunch Treat,"Went to Mezza9 in Grand Hyatt Singapore for a Sunday brunch with my significant other. Full house but with careful/hassle-free social distancing. Felt safe. Food and ambience were great – nosier than most joints we frequent but the bustle added to a great festive meal before Monday/work year starts for us. Though hurried, the staff attended to our every request. Especial thanks to Ravi (professional and knowledgeable) and Su Jeong (charming – and I hope I got her name right). Complimentary parking – an imperative for us – was an icing. Added Mezza9 to our “must revisit” shortlist and signed up for free membership."
Best service by Kevin,Amazing service by Kevin. He was so attentive and kind and I appreciate it very much. I felt so taken care of. Perfect for solo diners
Great value 2 or 3 couse lunch!,"Plenty of space for safe distancing! Selections of 2-course lunch at S$35++ or 3-course at S$45++. Starters included delicious fried crab cake, sashimi salad and raw yellow crude carpaccio. Mains were steak, grilled salmon, crispy barramundi and vegetarian burger. Desserts were Belgian chocolate fondant and green tea ice cream. All very good!"
Bad service,Service and food has dropped. They need to train the staff to manage the locals. Bad attitude from some waitresses. They dont even want to look at our direction....thats why i am deciding to write this....hopefully the team will look into better service in future. I believe i am not the only one writing about the service at mezzanine. Ruben had the best attitude...if i may add
Affordable price for decent set lunch,"(lamb steak+beef steak+half lobster noddle) Though many restaurants offer complimentary cake for birthday visit, it is still heartwarming to receive a lovely one. Open kitchen concept with QRcode a la carte menu The staff is attentive and welcoming."
Simply average at best,"Bought the 1-for-1 2 course lunch set on seeing the good reviews from the internet reviews. Went on a weekday and the restaurant was quite fully occupied. The ambience is nice. We both ordered steak for the main dish, sashimi salad and, duck and pork terrine for appetizers. The steaks tasted average, but were pretty small and tough. We felt that the appetizers were better than the main dish. The servings were so small that we were hungry in about 2 hours later. Also, the restaurant seemed understaffed, as we had some difficulty getting their attentions."
Lunch at mezza9,"Back to mezza9 after an absence of many years, so many that I can't specifically recall when I last visited. Returned for lunch in Oct with a friend. Surprisingly busy, but fortunately we had a reservation. Service was a little slow due to the high number of customers, but still friendly and efficient. Opted for the sashimi salad, seared yellow fin tune and the chocolate fondant for dessert. Very good quality and well worth the visit."
Would have been a great experience if not for curt waiter,Hubby and i went for a leisurely Monday lunch and all was really nice and good until a rather unfriendly PRC waiter served us a few times. He was curt and blunt in his replies to our menu queries and took a very long time figuring out applying the Chope code for our bill and was not particularly apologetic for making us wait so long. There was another PRC service staff who was much nicer as well as 1 other Filipino staff whom we would have preferred to have served us thru the whole meal. The food was great. Kudos to the chefs.
Bad experience,"Bad experience dining in mezza 9. First and last time going back. Came in for my reservation at 1230pm, food only came at 140pm. It is an hour wait for my food, even so many staff we approach to check on our food but no one get back to us how long more we shall wait. Kitchen was so slow...however dienes is very empathy and apologetic after lunch."
Wonderful flexible service!,Worthwhile lunch sets. Lamb was surprisingly good! starters were memorable especially the crab cake and sashimi salad. What i was more impressed when the service manager acceded to my request to improvise an off menu fried rice item for my helper.
Negative experience at Mezza 9,"We received a Chope gift voucher for this restaurant however, our experience was not positive. We waited about 35 minutes for our mains to be served to us. The waiter did not inform us that our dishes would take longer than expected when we made the order. If he did, we would have expected it. The couple from the table beside us arrived much later but were served their dishes first. The poor service towards us could have been because we used a deal or because we belong to a minority racial group. The staff appeared very cold to us, but charming and friendly towards others.

We expected more from a hotel as established as Hyatt. Truly disappointing!"
Poor Service,"- Very long waiting time for food.
- Placed in a room and we always have to walk out to try to get hold of waiter’s attention.
- Did not inform us that the buffet comes with juice/coffee until I ask. And drink is only limit to 1 juice and 1 coffee.
- Desserts also limit your 1 per pax.
- The only free flow is appetisers.
- Not much varieties as compared to other hotels and the amount we paid for.

Not highly recommended for a 5 stars hotel standard."
Wonderful Care & Consideration,"I took my Mom and aunty, both vegetarians, to Mezza9. Mr Loges looked after them so well. He spoke to the chef and got them an awesome variety of vegetarian dishes not seen in the menu. The other staff we spoke to didn’t bother and that was shameful.

Their food and mine were simply delicious. I hope the hotel hangs on to Mr Loges and looks after him well. Good staff like him are extremely difficult to come by."
Commendation of waiter,"Waiter was friendly and helpful. Always smiling. Ambience was top notch. Food was fantastic. If you're looking to pamper your taste buds, you should definitely come here."
Excellent Service - 28 Nov 2020 - 1200-1430h,"Kudos goes to Andy who was attentive to every single diner. he worked at top speed and it was almost as if he carried the entire restaurant (dessert section) on his own. he was fleeting table to table; cleaning, serving, taking orders, et cetera; no query was ignored even when one family had many questions and was not ready to order. I can't say the same for the Manager who did very little beyond looking around and presenting a couple of bills. Not hands on at all. Andy ought to be promoted."
Disapointing dining experience,"After the recent visit to Mezza9, i felt very disapointed with the service as well as the overall dining experience. Not only all items that were used to be complimentary (ice water, bread, xo sauce...) were now chargeable, but also the service were not as good as it used to be . The staff were less friendly, less attentive. Empty plates were left on the table without clearing for a long time.

But thats not the main issue. Honesty issue is what I wished to highlight. We ordered lobster crispy noodle (de-shelled). However we realized the portion of the lobster meat wasnt like the usual amount when it came with the shell, hence we checked with the staff. They say they will check and get back but return with a plate of top-up portion of fried lobster with vege with no apology and explaination. Some of the small parts of the lobster could now be seen.

Nowadays its really sad to see alot of restaurants cannot maintain their standard."
Great service & amazing food,"We went there for lunch on the 25th November and it was super amazing, Rosanna was really nice with us very attentive and checking our table like time to time , she is fabulous staff . We would like to thank Arriane as well for a wonderful service and also big thank to the chef for the delicious foods ."
Mezza9 won’t take you to Cloud9,"The main advantage of this joint is if different members in your party have different preferences in terms of cuisine. The lunch menu is not that long but adequate if you don’t visit the place often. The food is ok, nothing to write home about. Service is polite and much better than pre-Covid where it could be downright unprofessional (like spilling hot water because of casual attitude, and no apologies and no effort to clean up!) However, expect the wait for cooked food to be long."
Good service. good food. Ease reservations,Good service. good food. Ease reservations. Really Enjoy table service by Asil who attentive service encourage our frequent visit.
Fabulous brunch!!,"Dining @ mezza9 is really awesome from ambience,food and quality of service shout out to rossana, arriane,vanessa and oliver for taking care of us❤️❤️ highly recommended 👍"
Challenging boisterous guests taken care of,The waiters did their utmost to offer us food options despite our challenging dietary needs. Nothing seemed too much trouble and the extra vegan ice cream was a real bonus!
Excellent service,Food was good and service was simply excellent. Oliver took good care of us during lunch and my parents enjoyed greatly.
1st Visit,Good food and service but seat was not comfortable. Chair is curved from left to right making one completely caged in and restrictive in movements. Probably intention is so that one does not linger too long there!?! ;o)
Do we need to worry about Mezza9?,"When hotel restaurants start to charge for tab-water (2.35 SGD per carafe) I wonder if this is the beginning of the end. I understand the constraints for restaurants due to COVID-19 restrictions but considering the prices being charged for food and considering that 1 l tab-water costs 0.0027 SGD in Singapore, not more needs to be said.
A pity, because the food is still fantastic and the service professional."
R.I.P Cake,"I bought a cake for a friend on 29/10. It turned out to be one of the most embarrassing blunder Hyatt did. On the cake, it was decorated R.I.P. How could a branded hotel make such a boo-boo? This taught me to check in future!"
Mezza9 Sunday Brunch A La Minute buffet,"Went to Mezza9 Sunday brunch semi buffet for daughter's birthday celebration (party of 5). Was super impressed with everything of the restaurant. Checking in and seating process were prompt and hassle free. Excellent table allocation (almost like a private room setting), ambience was spot on. Top notch food quality, seafood on ice was very fresh especially the Maine lobsters which I ate without any sauces to go along, same goes to the oysters. The beautiful plating of the seafood makes a very ""instagrammable"" pictures actually. The mains were marvelous, a must have ordered item is the Black Angus Beef Prime Rib (if you are a steak goer), grilled to perfection and with doneness consistency throughout the entire cut of steak. To finish off the lunch, you just need to order the Mezza9 Extravagance to satisfy all the sweets cravings. A special shout out to Rosalina, our server of the day whom has been the highlight of our dining experience, she was very attentive, sensibly thoughtful and giving excellent advice when comes to ordering our food and clearing used plates. One minor feedback, beverages like hot coffee and tea are to be ordered as separate a la cart items (not a major issue since Starbucks is just across the street though :). To sum up, We left the restaurants full of praises on the quality of food and services provided by Mezza9 and definitely looking forward to our next visit or visits....Keep up the excellent standard Mezza9! Highly recommended to everyone and this is one good local restaurants that deserves our support in this difficult time."

Birthday dinner at Mezza9,"Was disappointed with the service especially from a 5 star hotel and Mezza9 was once known for its quality of food and professional service. The birthday cake which i have informed the hotel was not served & forgotten. You have to wait for 2-3 minutes before we were ushered to our table. In the past, there will be Restaurant Managers and 2 counter staff to greet you promptly with a warm welcome the moment you enter the restaurant. Worst of, they do not give complimentary coupon but expect the guest to bring the receipt to the Mezza9 counter to claim it! This is not what a 5 star hotel service that anyone expected. Also the restaurant has lost its ambience!"
Food and service is good,"Food is good. Waiters are helpful and well trained. Atmosphere is good too. Purchased chope voucher during Chope Birthday sales, 1 for 1 3 course meals at $52.97. Worth it."
Excellent Service,Rosanna was very attentive from the start and had a great sense of humour. The restaurant was packed but we didn’t have to wait long for her to be by our side either that huge smile in her eyes (mask on)
Set lunch in Hyatt,"Came here with my friends for bday celebrations and we asked many requests and this fantastic waiter have served us well, service by Loges! Keep it up guys!!"
