Memorable Wedding Banquet,"Our solemnisation and wedding banquet was successfully held at Fu Lin Men NSRCC. Initially we shortlisted this venue due to the awesome golf course view seen from the restaurant. We finally settled with this venue because the rapport and staff engagement was very pleasant.

From reserving the date to planning the menu to ad-hoc changes, everything was well accommodated without hassle. The manager of the restaurant, Mr Ruel, was very prompt in replying my messages and saw readily to every request that I've made. He also waived off the corkage charges and threw in a couple of freebies to boost up the overall dining experience.

The dishes prepared by the Chef was very delectable and received a lot of compliments. It was one of the best wedding cuisines we've had.

In summary: clean environment, fantastic scenery, seamless coordination, delicious food and awesome services. Kudos to Mr Ruel and his team for providing such a memorable experience. Heartfelt appreciation from us!

A very cosy place to have your ROM,"If you're looking for a place to hold an intimate solemnization, this place is perfect. Not only is the staff very friendly, but the food is delicious. We tried the 88+ per pax menu and liked it. This place also has a minimum of 10 guests (1 table), so for those needing somewhere that can hold less than 50 pax, this is the place! The golf course outside the restaurant (NSRCC branch) is also a simple yet beautiful place to take some couple shots. Ruel who was in charge of communications with us is super friendly and will help you to make your special day go smoothly. Highly recommend! :)"
The BEST service we could ask for during our wedding banquet,"Due to a hiccup at our original banquet venue, my wife and I were scrambling to find a new banquet venue 1.5 months before our wedding day (19 Nov 2022). A friend of ours referred us to Ruel (the manager at NSRCC Fu Lin Men) and from the first moment we spoke to him until the end, he has been nothing but flexible, professional, and helpful in our dire time of need.

He was prompt in responding to our queries over WhatsApp, and expedited a lot of necessary preparations because of the short timeline. Throughout this intense period of preparation, Ruel always made sure that we were at ease and assured. On the actual day, he was on the ball in working with us and our coordinator in giving us updates to make sure everything was running on schedule.

Beyond the great atmosphere, very reasonable pricing, spacious venue and delicious food, it was Ruel's professionalism and his heart to help us as best as he could that makes this 5-star review an understatement of how good a place NSRCC Fu Lin Men was to us."
Luncheon,Held the company luncheon here and the staffs and manager were very friendly and helpful. Food was good and everyone enjoyed their time. Thanks for the great service!
Great place for wedding or ROM,"When I first came to NSRCC Fu Lin Men, I was in awe by the spectacular golf course surrounding it. It was beautiful and I knew that I wanted to have my wedding held here. In a short notice of less than 3 months, we consulted and discussed with Mr Ruel the manager. He was very helpful in the planning and met our requests well. During the event, he made sure everything went smoothly and was there to help out the couple and guests. Thank you Fu Lin Men and Mr Ruel for helping us plan and execute our wedding dinner well!!! Highly recommend this place for beautiful scenery and amazing service."
Unbelievably Wonderful Food and Service,"On 04-Nov-2022, celebrated our company’s 25th anniversary at Fu Lin Men NSRCC.
We choose NSRCC Fu Lin Men once again cause this restaurant left us unbelievably wonderful memory from the food to service.
Our CEO who travels widely and ate Chinese cuisine at many restaurants. He had nothing but praises for the Chef since his first dinner at the restaurant in April this year.
Our Australian team were so impressed with Chef that they put Chef into their wish list in Australia.
Chef was given a standing ovation when Chef served the first dish personally, Lobsters Salad. The team was very touched and happy to meet this Awesome Chef who dished out food that touched every heart.
I also like to express my appreciation to Restaurant Manager Ruel. Ruel had make this evening unforgettable for our team."
Fantastic location for private event,Booked the function room for an event for 50pax. Ruel has been most helpful and accommodating throughout the entire event. The food was great and my guest thoroughly enjoyed themselves.
Best Venue to have your Solemnization/ROM,"Thank you to Mr Ruel, from the Low Family

Our first visit to NSRCC Fu Lin Men was on the August 2022, we were warmly welcomed by Mr Ruel. We wanted to enquire on the ROM Solemnization lunch package that they offered.

Even though the restaurant was quite busy during lunch hour, Mr Ruel still entertained us and patiently explained the myriad of dishes that they offered, the service and packages that are included and helped assure us that he'll do whatever he could in his capacity to make this the best wedding we would have while still staying in budget. Mr Ruel offered us packages that best fitted within our budget as well as alternative dishes and special requested that we had.

We were then offered a discounted taste test 2 week later where my family enjoyed the scrumptious meal prepared by Mr Ruel and the team. Throughout the taste testing, we were able to give our opinions and changes on the dishes served. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there taste testing my dishes, and even dishes that are not available on the menu itself.

A few weeks later, we also had requested Halal, Vegan and Vegeterian menu. Mr Ruel and his team managed to help us with it while many restaurant had turned us away. I'm amazed by the service and afterthought that Mr Ruel and team had provided.

The arrangement of seatings and function room was amazing Mr Ruel and his team helped make the room look extremely well done and fitted our theme, yet we didn't even fork out a single cent for it. Seats were arranged by what I've planned and meal dietary restriction are marked by the color of handkerchief, amazing way to make it subtle. Mr Ruel also provided tips and tricks on how we could better improve the layout while also keeping in kind my requirement. Mr Ruel also came down on his off day upon my request to finalise the plan a day before the wedding. Such commitment towards customer is really commendable and I could see why Mr Ruel and his team has such high rating over many sites.

On the wedding day itself, everyone enjoyed themselves and praised the food many of my guest even said they would come back to the restaurant because the meal were perfect. Mr Ruel came numerous time to the function room to make sure everything was going smoothly and that the guest was happy. Mr Ruel even went out of his way to help me MCee the event when our MCee could not turn up as she was sick. We ended our day with a happy note.

Thank you Mr Ruel and the team. We appreciate and thank you for making our wedding day the best day of our life.

Low Family"
Solemnization Lunch Banquet,"The setup for the room was beyond expectations and the staff, especially the manager Ruel has been accommodative and patient! I noticed that Ruel took the initiative to take away the chair when I was having difficulties maneuvering around and he graciously accepted our request to emcee. The food was delicious and they took the effort to remember our requests for some of the dishes. Thank you to the NSRCC team for your quality service!"
Our special wedding banquet,"Mr Ruel & his team has given us their utmost professional experience in managing our wedding banquet. All our friends & relatives enjoyed their food, especially the seafood. They are so fresh.

Thank you so much for making our special day so amazing.
We are very pleased with everything.

Good value premium seafood set,"Very cosy restaurant with professional service & lovely Cantonese style dishes. The 6-course set is a great deal: baked lobster was very fresh, collagen fish maw broth was yummy & flavourful. The abalone sauce was not overly salty. Overall the cooking was more healthy than most Chinese restaurants - not overly salty, oily or seasoned which suit our palates. Loved our additional order of prawn Chee Cheong fun. The sauce was not salty & the roll was freshly made with succulent plump prawns. Very pleased with our lunch. Worth the money paid & efforts made to travel to this rare gem!"
Wedding Banquet,"Highly recommended Ruel & his team for their professionial experience in organising our banquet with timely updates and rehearsal for our wedding.

Covid has definitely made challenges to business such as resturants hosting banquets. As covid rules easen out, they updated us on the pax size and how the plans would change to made our wedding better.

Ruel never fail to give us an updates on the progress, timeline and request we gave and will find ways to help us out on the requests made by our in-laws.

Definitely if anyone wants to host a wedding banquet, do look for Ruel and his team!"
Wedding Lunch,"My wife and I had hold our ROM/wedding lunch at FuLinMen at September 22.

Ruel is our POC for the event. His service given to us was top notch. He guided us based on our requirement and recommended the best package for our milestone/lifetime event.

As a newly couple abt to tie the knot, it is inevitable for tons of “unreasonable” requests, he had tried to accommodate all our requests even if the request is last min.
For the food wise, I have gotten tremendous feedback from my guests that the food is one of the best as compare to other restaurants of the similar tier.

As for their AV system, Ruel noted that we will be displaying our PWS photos.. he told us to send to his email and help us project using their 2 existing projectors. To amplify the ambience, he had also instructed his staff to control the lightings/volume to suit the various programme of the day.

As a whole, We were glad that FuLinMen was chosen to hold our ROM."
Great Rom lunch session at nsrcc fu lin men restaurant,The best choice indeed to conduct our simple rom lunch at src outlet. Mr Ruel Camu provided us with tip-top services and help to set up everything. He even allows us to test the sound system and our video before the event. Very spacious room with an awesome view of a nice garden with beautiful flowers. The tables were well set and all our guests felt comfortable and cosy. It was a great experience.
Creative Asian fusion food,Special invite to the restaurant for a ad-hoc fusion food tasting and it’s an extraordinary effort and attention to details of the chef to produce quality and exquisite standard cuisine. Thanks
Lunch Wedding Banquet,"My wife and I had hold our lunch wedding banquet at Fulinmen in start of July 2022 and had the assistance of Ruel to help out us on it.

He had given an excellent service to us and also to assist us in getting the best package that suited our needs. There had been multiple last minute requests given to him but he had dealt with all of them and we are very glad with it..

With the relaxing of covid regulations, there had been more banquets, events and inquiries which no doubt had a little bit of delay during peak period but in the end, all of our concerns were answered.

Sound system wise was more than sufficient with multiple speakers for the entire dining hall. Deco wise, if you are not picky, it would be sufficient. There were 2 big screens for projectors which was good and clear. Overall ambience is definitely better than normal restaurant as it is similar to a ballroom setting. Down side would be that there is no public transport in, only free shuttle bus from tanah merah, so it is slightly inconvenience.

Good feedback on the food from my guests and the pricing is definitely worthwhile. There are definitely more pros and cons but I'll strongly recommend it!"
"Great food, generous portions and excellent Service","Been to FLM three times already and held my wedding dinner there.

Food has been excellent with authentic chinese cuisine, service staff are polite and prompt.

Price is very reasonable for the quality and portion; all times that I've went, never once I left without a happy belly."
Birthday lunch,"Had a birthday lunch at Fu Lin Men NSRCC last Sunday to celebrate my mum's birthday. As usual, FLM didn't disappoint us in term of service & food. Food portion was big & good. Especially touched when the longevity buns was served. Told them in advance we wanted longevity buns & effort was made to present it so beautiful. Thumb up for the great service"
Booked But Cannot Go In,"Mother's Day, all restaurants mostly lijely booked. But, you never know, give it a try. Google Fu Lin Men and clicked on ""Book a reservation"", Quandoo pop up, book for that day dinner. Confirm! So happy!
Drove all the way there and was told at the reception that my booking was not valid. Said that they have inform Quandoo not to take booking as tgey are booked out.
Now, all I know is that as usual somebody screwed up and I end up being affected and I'm sure I am not the only one."
Worst dining experience ever,"Are all the 5 stars review here paid for?

Most horrible experience ever. Made a reservation on Quandoo, went down and they told me Quandoo made a mistake because they are fully booked. Our booking was for 7pm and we arrived at 655pm. There were 3 big tables empty at that time. Told me it was for 730pm reservation. If they had let me in at 7pm, some other tables would have been done at 730pm. A family came in later than 730pm and apparently knows the manager. Manager ushered them to the empty at the front. They seemed to dislike the table or for some other reason wanted to change their table. Manager moved them to another empty table inside and suddenly we now have a table. What kind of reason could it be that when a family switched seat there was suddenly an available table? It means that there was a table available all this time? And they waited 45 min to give us a table?

So we finally sat down and ready to place our orders. Waited 15 min to have our orders taken by apparently only the managers can take order. But at this point all the managers suddenly disappeared.

There were flies flying around and I even killed one on the menu. We saw someone’s Peking duck getting served and they dropped the cracker on the table. The waitress picked it up with his bare hands and put it back on the plate. That was when we know we had to get out of there. We waited 45 min for a table despite having a reservation, 15 min just to have someone come to us to take order. 1 hour for nothing.

Overall a very bad experience and will never be back without even trying their food. They blamed the app but it is on the restaurant to at least have the courtesy to call the patrons and let them know? It is Mother’s Day and everywhere else is fully booked. Where do they expect us to get a table?"
Unforgettable Pre-Mother’s Day Dinner,"Restaurant was extremely overbooked, took in so many bookings and a wedding that the staff and kitchen were totally unable to handle. We Made reservation for 4 pax at 6pm and we arrived early at 5.50pm. Ordered 4 dishes, restaurant served 3 dishes in 3 hours, we had to takeaway the last dish as it’s almost 9pm. It’s utterly embarrassing when you bring your old folks out for a pre-mother’s day dinner and they end up waiting for hours, hungry and angry. Management is too greedy, taking in so many bookings and the poor staff have to run here and there trying to find out where the food is, if the food has been prepared and dealing with angry hungry customers. Don’t have a big head don’t wear such a big hat."
Birthday Bash for a friend,Our group of five had a lunch date in Fu Lin Men as a birthday venue for our friend. The food and service here is so magnificent. Had a lot of meal choices that would satisfy your palate. The area is also decent. Would like to return if ever.
"Great & Fresh Seafood, Great customer service","May Yee took the initiative to call one day prior lunch for the menu for my guests. This has saved a lot time during lunch and we can focus on our lunch dialogue.

The seafood is very fresh, my guests really enjoyed each dish.

2 feedback for improvement is
1. the Aircon at the room can be improved. We are facing the warm glaring sun and the heat is pretty unbearable.
2. The dining is small for 4 person given the crew needs to shift in to serve the food."
Excellent food and service,My company hosted our CNY lunch at Fu Lin Men. The service rendered by Ruel is excellent as he able to accommodate on our food choices and table arrangements.
"Nice food, Great Service!","GM was accommodating to requests, seating was spacious, area is well lited by natural sunlight which bring up the ambience.. Food is flavourful, portion is about right and service is splendid! Will definitely recommend and return!"
Good food and ambience for a cosy meal,"We had an enjoyable lunch experience with the serene ambience and good quality food. Ruel, the restaurant manager and his team were excellent in service and gave us a good seated table facing the golf course. Peking duck, razor clams and the beancurd are the dishes we enjoyed most. Will not hesitate to visit again in future. Parking is convenient too. Highly recommended !"
Christmas and Birthday celebration lunch,"It was a pleasant and pleasured family lunch. I used the word “pleasured” because Ruel Camu and his team and the VIP Room settings made it very pleasant for me to have a private time with my children. The special Lobster Set Menu and the additional Peking Duck was more than sufficient and sumptuous for the family.

Immediately after the meal, I had gone ahead and made booking for the 2022 Chinese Lunar New Year family reunion lunch."
Held a wedding at this venue,"I am heavily impressed by the wedding package which I signed up with Fu Lin Men at this branch. The restaurant manager, Ruel, has been exceptional and experienced in terms of catering to our needs, providing wonderful service, and ensuring that the wedding was smooth and well run.

Kudos to the team!"
Solemnization and Wedding Dinner,"My husband and I just had our solemnization and wedding dinner at Fu Lin Men (NSRCC). Even though we only engaged Fu Lin Men about 2 months prior to our wedding, Ruel was very patient with us and accommodative towards all our requests. It was a worry-free and fuss- free experience as Ruel helped us through the whole banquet process, including details like banquet hall and stage decoration, wedding card design and printing, and door gifts. Ambience was great for an intimate wedding with our families and friends. Service rendered by staff was excellent."
Lunch meetup with Friends,"Make a reservation With Mr Ruel Camu (Relations Manager)for 4pax on 9-12-21 Thursday for lunch at NRCC branch.Greet with a big smile by Mr Ruel
Nice ambience and sitting facing a golf field. Thanks for the arrangement

Staffs here are friendly and nice. In addition, ambiance is nice and quiet. Good place for family and business dinner. Will come more often."
ROM Lunch: Amazing personal service!,"My husband and I were looking to hold a small, intimate solemnisation together with lunch for 10 pax. Fulinmen NSRCC was the only restaurant that offered us a private room for this, with no extra venue charges or minimum spending. We also loved the scenic environment of the restaurant, overlooking the spacious golf course.
Right from our first recce visit, Ruel has been easy-going and extremely helpful. He is very responsive over text to any questions I have, and goes out of his way to fulfill some of my requests (e.g. having access to the room from 10am onwards for preparations). On the evening before my solemnisation lunch, he even took the liberty to send photographs of the room setup, to assure me that everything is ready and in place (as attached).
On the day of the solemnisation, Ruel was in the private room at all times, together with a helper. Once we arrived, he served us coffee and tea, and was on standby to offer help whenever he can. Once he saw that the solemnisation was wrapping up, he also took the initiative to start getting the dishes ready for service. The entire event flow was seamless due to his attention to detail. Of course, the lunch proceeded smoothly. Each dish in the 6-course meal was individually plated, and every dish was delicious! We especially enjoyed the lotus leaf rice, which was packed with so many ingredients and super satisfying! For the dessert, the portions of peach resin was super generous too. Ruel also took the effort to check whether each of us wanted the dessert warm or chilled.
Overall, it was a super pleasant experience with Ruel and his team. My husband and I are super glad we chose to celebrate our special day at Fulinmen NSRCC, and our family has nothing but praises for the food and service as well! Highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion, especially for brides-to-be looking for a fuss-free experience for your banquet/solemnisation!"

Value for money - Premium seafood with great ambience,"Ruel and his team made sure that my family and I felt comfortable from the point of phone booking till dessert.

Great place to hold small weddings,My wife and I hosted our small wedding lunch there and was pleasantly surprised by the level of service delivered. We had a dedicated person helping us clear out plates and dishing out the food for our table. The Fu Lin Men team also helped us to prepare the tea for the tea ceremony even though they initially said they were not able to and help me with the washing of the cups. The food was also very decent and reasonably priced. My guest and us had a great time there. I would definitely recommend them for casual meals or for important occasions.

Happy times!,1st visit to Fu Lin Men @ NSRCC. Food is great n place is clean n friendly! Excellent service as well. Good dining place for family.
Great and awesome lunch,"The Peking duck is really crispy and succulent. We don't live nearby but worth travelling the mile to eat the yummy char Siew bao and other dishes like fried prawn roll.Unlike other dim sum restaurants, the dishes are really unique and fragrant. Highly efficient service as well."
Was there for lunch on 6Nov.,"Was there for lunch on 6Nov. The dim sum and shark fin soup were great. The restaurant manager, Ruel, and his crew were attentive and nice."
Good taste & great service.,Staff were very friendly and service was good. Price is reasonable as well. Ordered the peking duck and it was delicious. Came with buns too which was a good surprise. Crispy chicken floss with fried brinjal was great too. Very aromatic. Requested for food to be less salty and everything came out perfect. Would go back again to try out their dimsum.
friends gathering,"was at restaurant for lunch with 2 other friends, ordered quite a lot dim sum but finished everything!! The charsiew bao was particularly good: very soft with very juicy and tasty charsiew infills. Recommended!!"
Dinner,Great service. Reasonable price. Food is delicious. Good and cosy environment. Very friendly and attentive staff.
Great Place for dinner,"Situated in a corner at NSRCC Resort, this restaurant is a nice quiet place for after golf or just family dinner. The service staff are very friendly and attentive and prices are not exorbitant. Food wise it's what you would expect from a good Chinese restaurant. A must try dish is the Beijing Duck."

Hidden Gem at NSRCC Changi!,"Received really good service from Ruel! He was very attentive to our needs, and elevated our dining experience at Fu Lin Men.
