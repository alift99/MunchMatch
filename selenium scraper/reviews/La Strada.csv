Good Dinner,"The food continues to maintain with excellent quality, eg. Mushroom soup, Maine Lobster Linguine, Japanese Seabream & the Souffle. We had the dinner as celebration for my son's birthday."
Awesome food with good food,"We went there for my hubby birthday dinner which was recommended by my friend. Food is awesome, Service is excellent. Both of us enjoyed the wagyu beef (500g) pairing with their fruity house wine. That is tasty and perfect match"
"Great food, recommend!","Although restaurant has been around for years, this is our first visit for friend’s birthday celebration.

Attentive service but was disappointing that restaurant did not offer/ go extra mile by offering something complimentary despite my reminder to waitress that it’s for a birthday celebration. The only “service” was putting a candle on one of the desserts we ordered.

The tables we were seated were looking a little tired (some spots on table top scraped) , no table cloth covering the worn top. Table cloth shouldnt be out of place given the restaurant’s decor and ambience. That said, we weren’t able to tell the brand identity of La Strada.. The senior service staff was suited, suggesting more formal setting( definitely not a cafe) but we saw male diners in bermudas at dinner service.

Overall the taste and food quality is great, pleasant ambiance so I’d still recommend."
Great quality of Italian cuisine,"Have been to La Strada before and it did not disappoint. The quality of food is great, with sufficient portions with no food waste. Love the beef carpaccio, lobster linguine and the tiramisu. Will come again, but then the restaurant is rather pricey for regular meals."
Disappointing food,"Part of Les Amis group and you will expect much better quality of food. The Carbarona is pretty standard and not worth the price. Some of the hawker stalls selling at a fraction of the price is way much better. The lobster pasta is also disappointing and pretty tasteless. Sad to say that for that price, a lot of proper Italian restaurants prepare their own fresh pasta and you have those pastas you can get from the supermarket. Tiramisu is pretty standard and nothing to shout about. Totally not worth the price."
Average food. Don’t expect anything special because of the Les Amis affiliation,Disappointed with the vongole as two of the clams were off. The fish was nothing extraordinary. Tiramisu was good. Had to top up $4 for latte instead of coffee for the set lunch
Skip this,Had business lunch here twice and both times were equally unsatisfactory- the 3 course set is nearly 70 in total and always leave hungry. Desserts are not appealing and the salad/fish is passable at their prices. Will not come back
Magnificent,"Everything is nicely done. Not too much and not to little. Just nice and to the point. Especially the wagyu steak, one of the best in my life."
La Strada on Chu Er,"Service at Les Amis group is usually top-notched. No exceptions for La Strada. Food was tasty and nicely plated. They changed out utensils and plates for every course. Nice, cozy meal for a chill day. Will visit again!"
Expensive with little,"Went there for dinner at 8pm after a movie. Atmosphere was dead, restaurant wasn't busy, service was not great and food was ""OK"" and expensive for what you got"
Dinner with friend,"Fantastic dinner! Food was great! Like the asparagus appetizer! And the beef, soft and juicy on the inside and firm on the outside, just the way i like it! Great!"
So average,"Was going to give 2 points, but the service was ok and the food nothing more than ok.

For me the huge disappointment was the lasagna. Great description on the menu but so small, tasteless and drowning in tomato sauce.

The description on the menu should be a pond of tomato sauce with thin tiny strips of pasta split with the occasional bit of beef ( certainly not a Ragu) and a sliver of sauce. This was awful and cannot be described as s lasagna.

Will not be going back."
Great food and service,"We have been fans of this place ever since the little pigs were still a decor item in the style of a rustic bistro. The food was great back then and we were so delighted that presently, with the muted modern decor the food is still just as good as before! Great service too, very attentive. We had the 3 course set lunch. Good value for money too."
Outstanding Italian Restaurant,Always a pleasure and a great dining experience here. We had the Caesar Salad with tuna and smoked pigeon as starters. Followed by the Maine lobster linguine and the Hungarian goose breast (quite chewy unlike duck breast) for mains. The limoncello desert was the best we’ve ever had. Beautiful dinner was accompanied by a beautiful Amarone wine. Total cost S$365.
Birthday Celebration!,The tiramisu is to die for. The best I’ve had in S’pore. The Burrata cheese & tomatoes were freshest I’ve had. The lobster linguine was delicious.
Perfect date place,"Was a bit disappointed that the Crystal Bread wasn't available, so we opted for the Foccacia, which was acceptable but not value-for-money.

Starters for sharing:
Pan Seared Hokkaido Scallops - so beautifully seated with the right amount of char-ness while remaining succulent.

Joselito Ham with Melon - good but not wow

Grilled Octopus - a little disappointing, was abit too charred and chewy

Mains:
Beef Ragu Tagliatelle - flavourful, delish. My favourite dish for today.

Seafood Stew - didn't try it but looked good

Desserts:
Chocolate Cannoli with Pistachio Ricotta Cream - dark chocolate coating was perfect, a dessert that's not too sweet but sweet enough to wrap up the meal.

Honey & Pine Tart - unique, but can pass.

Overall, an excellent meal, food quality is generally good, just the scallops and tagliatelle alone were enough to make the experience worthwhile. Service was excellent and attentive too."
Fantastic Service and Food,Been there a few times and their service never fail me. Simply like their wine and food are excellent. Thumbs up to the manager and his team there. This is a restaurant that you should never miss trying .
First & Last time,"Found it really difficult just to get the attention of the servers to take our orders. Got the Obsiblue prawns, scallops tagliolini and carbonara. No wow factor in the dishes which distinguishes them from other italian restaurants. Plus, the hokkaido scallops was poorly done. Al Forno restaurant executes their Italian cuisines better. Ordered an additional Veal Milanese, tasteless, slightly bitter undertones. Didnt finish that dish.

Servers only bothered to explain dishes to another table of VIPs but not to us. Probably can be more consistent in their service delivery.

Ended our evening at Les Amis and that really elevated our experience.

Will be back to Les Amis, definitely not La Strada."
Better Value with Set Lunch,"Food are hit and miss! Pretty good value for set lunch relative to ala-carte! Nice atmosphere, quiet."
Excellent Food - mediocre decor,"Lunch menu was great with many options to choose from. Quality and portion size were great. Not sure about the decor, and music choice for the restaurant. Lacks warmth and got a canteen feeling. No clear head of front of house, all working as individuals."
Food was sooooo good!,"Nice casual ambience. Small yet cosy. Simple deco yet tastefully done.
Food was yummylicious n service was great. Very attentive staff.
One of the best grilled octopus with garlic n aged balsamic, Wagyu was not available tonite but the replacement was great too. Love the tiramisu. Perfectly done. Sauvignon Blanc was ok. Highly recommended"
Exceptional Italian Cuisines,"Not the typical Italian restaurant. Dishes are not commonly found in menu of most Italian restaurants. We very much enjoyed our starters of flavorful grilled octopus and roasted Maine lobster, followed by fresh sea bream with clams in a soupy base and perfectly roasted Hungarian goose breast. Last but not least, one of the best tiramisu we’ve tasted. Total bill for 2 including a bottle of red wine is S$353."
A night to forever,"I had the most memorable service by the service team ! Everything from the food and service was on point. I left the feeling very satisfied. lm looking forward to my next visit !!!! 5 stars level of service ! Kudos to Mr Rajoo, the the best of the best !"
Not worth,"Had grilled octopus which was good. But the cold angel hair uni pasta was bad and not worth the money for $68. The pasta was tasteless and could taste the pasta wheat instead. Rather top up $20 for uni pasta at da Luca instead.
Ravioli foie gras was okay but filled with oil and not much foie gras. Wouldn't recommend their pasta dishes."
Birthday Lunch (Love the Porterhouse Steak),"Recently visited this place for lunch with some friends. We did the ala carte menu for lunch as this was a special occasion. Overall we all love the food we had especially lobster olio, vongole, porterhouse steak were the more memorable choices. I like the octopus and the burrata cheese and lastly the risotto was so so only. The soufflé was huge and superb. Service was very attentive. Definitely will return."
One of the best Italian Restaurants in town,Fresh ingredients. Professionally cooked. Cosy restaurant. The largest Chocolate Soufflé I’ve ever seen - they suggest 2 persons to share but it’s good enough for 3.
Part of the Les Amis group,"Part of the Les Amis group this Italian restaurant serves up a nice 3 course meal for lunch at $42. Had their Burrata with Parma ham and peas, Carbonara and Tiramisu lemoncello. The dessert was the standout. Coffee or tea is included. Overall the taste was acceptable. The ambience was simple overlooking Claymore Hill Road and the HSBC branch opposite. The restaurant closes at 3pm."
"Great place for lunch, cosy, great food","Had a small family lunch for 4. We were given a lovely corner table in an enclosed and private area. I have been to La Strada many times in the past when they had little pig figurines and wooden shutter windows. Now the decor is modern and while it’s nice with its elegant muted fabrics, I missed the character of the previous decor. The food did not disappoint I’m so glad to observe. The set lunches were still offered at very reasonable prices for this quality. The carbonara is wonderful, vongole pasta very tasty, lamb shank very tender, chicken stew was ok. Starters were delicious as were desserts. Would definitely be back again!"
beef was good. service not so much,"Had dinner here for my husband's birthday. Brought my 5 yef=ar old along. As my boy's kinda a fussy eater, requested to bring in french fries from another place as La Strada has none. Was denied this request. .. Other restaurants, eg. Garibaldi has always graciously allowed us this small concession. I guess I wont be back.

The beef was good, carbonara so so, sea bream.. ok.

Overall, not worth it for the lousy service"
dinner,ordered dinner takeaway of minestrone soup and chicken cacciatore. food quality is decent. service warm and friendly though its a takeaway.
Awesome set lunch,Very delicious and good quality foods. The staff is very nice too. The environment in the restaurant also good for business meeting.
Gals dinner,"First visit there,loved the atmosphere.It was a small & warm atmosphere,foods were delicious. Staffs were efficient & polite."
Value set lunch,"My friend bought me lunch here. 5 of us ordered 5 set lunches to share. Each set lunch costing $42 comes with a choice of starter, main, dessert and coffee/ tea. There were both hits and misses. I love the Caesar Salad. There was something crunchy inside but I couldn't tell what it was cos it didn't taste like croutons. The Ravioli with foie gras filling was nice too. I found the scallops a tad too chewy even though the center was done just right. I didn't like the cream of pea soup either. Maybe it's because I don't like the taste of peas. The Wagyu striploin was disappointing. Even at medium rare, it wasn't tender. The rib eye was way better. I love that even though the surface was charred, the tenderness of the steak still remained. The lobster aglio olio was nice than the spaghetti vongole. Both were dry pastas without sauce but the aglio olio was tastier and more flavorful. I could also taste the aroma of lobster in the pasta. My favourite dessert was the Lemoncello Tiramisu. Tangy and zesty, it was not too sweet and ended my meal beautifully. Will definitely return again"
Earnest Italian Fare,"The set lunch represents great value at $42++ although expect to supplement this basic price if you choose more pricey options, such as the scallops with white asparagus, which was worth every penny.

Tried the carbonara for mains and it was executed with authenticity. Its not easy to get a good carbonara these days.

Desserts are excellent here and the tiramisu was very satisfying."
Hearty portions,"The 3 course set lunch was served by friendly staff, it was tasty and portion size was big! Very satisfying indeed."
Attentive Service,They gave me a corner table for our anniversary celebration. Was thankful because the later crowd was a little loud. Came to us frequently enough to check whether we were done with our meals. Loved their lobster with pasta. Was delicious.
"Good Food , Poor Ambiance","Excellent table service, good food though cold cuts were mediocre but ambiance is poor (no table cloth & layout like a cafe) given that this is a reasonably high end restaurant where one has to budget at least $100 per person. Will not return!"
Delightful Italian,"On the actual day of my birthday I had to eat Italian as I overspent at modern French the night before.

The pastas were great even though cooked by a non Italian.
Not so much the mushroom soup.

The reinterpreted tiramisu and the ice cream looking thing hit the right spot too.

Had a cheaper but decent Margaux thanks to my staff.
Chateau Malescot St Exupery in place of Chateau Margaux.

Always a pleasure to visit."
Carbonara to die for,"Visited numerous times and I will always order the carbonara. Incredible dish, probably the best in Singapore.

They do their seafoods well. Had a clam linguine and it was amazing, the clam taste was intense and the pasta was done al-dente.

Had a burrata + caviar combo and it was great, the saltiness of the caviar complimented the creamy and light burrata well."
Splendid!,"Date night again! And place did not disappoint.

Servers were really helpful in recommending vegetarian dish for my husband.

Mushroom pasta! Perfectly done!

I had the 5 fish platter and it was just of a right portion for one person. My favorite among the 5 fishes was the Tuna.

The burrata was really good too!

Might not be the best restaurant I’ve been too but is definitely a good place to return to."
All good - just pricy for my taste!,"Wait a minute! This place can't be the same I eat and rated just last year?!!! The decor is different, the menu is different, and so on ..... still very pricey as well. I had their Ribeye dish and mixed salad plus desert and a beet and the total was above 100 SGD! Very good service and the taste was good. But too much money overall."
Pleasant lunch and great service,Nice lunch with quiet atmosphere. Special thanks and appreciation to the staff for helping with birthday celebration.
All round fantastic,"My friend and I had a fantastic experience at La Strada for dinner.

The pastas we ordered were absolutely delicious; very well seasoned with depth of flavour. The wine we had was great too.

Service staff were extremely pleasant and polite; our waters and wine were refilled and topped up frequently without us having to ask, which was a nice show of initiative and attentiveness.

The ambience was quite nice as well, with the restaurant being tucked away nicely in a corner of Orchard Road, there wasn't a huge crowd, and it felt more like a place for people in-the-know. The restaurant was nice and quiet, and we really enjoyed talking and having our dinner peacefully.

The only downside was the price of the dishes and the wine, which we found to be slightly on the high side. However given the quality of the dishes and the great service, we were happy to pay a small premium. I'll be back! :)"
Family Luncheon,"Overall, family enjoyed the afternoon at the restaurant. Good experience. Price tend to be on a high side. Restaurant tend to be small in size becoming very ""squeezy"" while eating."
No longer the same truffle carbonara,"I remembered I fell in love with la strada carbonara back in the day as 1 of my favourite pasta......the truffle scent was intoxicating , it wasn’t too creamy and relied more on the egg to give its creaminess and the pasta they used was of a thinner sort which went perfectly

Sadly a lot has change... I couldn’t smell the truffle, it was really creamy with the sauce instead of the egg, the pasta was thick and just didn’t blend well overall

Wish Fratini sold his truffle pasta ala carte
Without the need of paying for degustation menu to eat it"
Average Food with Great Service,"This restaurant served decent Italian dishes, but failed to live up to its price tag and the name of the Les Amis chain of restaurants.
I took advantage of the 1-for-1 weekday lunch set voucher provided by my Standard Chartered VI credit card for my birthday celebration with my wife.
+ Service was great from the moment we stepped into the place. Kudos to the service team.
+ Menu was decent with plenty of varieties to choose from for starter, main and dessert.
- The meatball tagliatelle had great handmade meatballs, but failed to impress with a mediocre sauce.
- The dessert Sfogliatelle (traditional Neapolitan pastry with multiple layers of leaf-like dough wrapped around ricotta chees) was a total miss. The dough was baked to be very hard and difficult to cut through, and even hurt my mouth and tongue.
Overall, the food was decent but didn't live up to its price tag of SGD 40++/pax. I wouldn't complain too much given that it only cost me SGD 20++/pax with the voucher, but will very unlikely return to the restaurant."
Good food and service,Food was good and service was excellent. Staff was attentive yet not intrusive. Was given a free desert as the soufflé had sunk and they had to redo. Overall experience was excellent even though it’s a little pricy.
Great experience,"The services was awesome, the waiter and waitresses are attentive and quick to attend to customer’s requests."
La Strada - lost its way,"La Strada part of Les Amis - has been part of the family for many years - relaunched last year the cuisine was exceptional, excellent service and nicely presented. Returning recently having been away for 6 months - it has changed. Although the ingredients are still of high quality - the Burrata and Tomatoes excellent - but the mushroom/Prosciutto special was over cooked. Main courses - Veal Milanese - oily - and the squid dry. Service was excellent but only a handful of guests - whats going on in the kitchen? Whoever is cooking is not up to standard. Maybe an off night - I hope so."
"Great service, great food","I had come here with my family for their lunch set. For the appetizer, main course and dessert set, the price was definitely worth it. Especially compared to the ala carte prices. In my opinion the appetizers were the stars of our lunch. The buratta was delicious and a must try! The main course was good but lacked the wow factor that was present in the appetizers. Yet my wife thoroughly enjoyed the lamb shank. For dessert the best was the truffle ice cream. A suprising delightful combination. From the second I entered the door the service was exceptional and friendly. Highly recommend trying for a lunch."
Must try,"@TheKuoknows

This is modern Italian cooking at its best. The Osso Buco made with Lamb Knuckle rather than Veal Knuckle was perfectly prepared. The meat just fell off the bone. The lamb ju was delicious.

The Caesar Salad starter was fresh and crispy. The Limoncello Tiramus was delightfully light. A great finale to an impeccable three-course lunch.

A special mention for the highly-attentive waiting staff. They knew the menu back-to-front, and answered questions expertly.

This is definitely on my list of go-to restaurants."
Our go to place for a fabulous meal,"We have dined at La Strada at least 10 times. Every meal is an experience where we enjoyed delicious appetisers, mains, sides and desserts. It offers a good selection of wines. Benedict and Raju’s suggestions never fail.
La Strada’s ambience is warm and pleasant.
Highly recommended."
"Great food, a bit on the expensive side","Had a Sunday lunch here last week. Tasty food, well presented and good service. Would definitely come again when we visit SG."
Excellent food,"We like the food there but the menu seems to have changed and we can’t add on thing like foie gras and bone marrow. Small and cosy, good service."
Good food but can be better,"Been to La Strada when it was a fine dining place then a few years it decided to cater to mass market. Glad to see that the food has improved. But my guess that the chef was not Italian is proven right when I googled.

The burrata and parma ham were okay. Hardly any truffle purée. Maybe I am biased but burrata at La Bracheria and Gunther’s taste better.

The tagliatelle with scallops and swimmer crab was light with chilli and pecorino. But I don’t think the tagliatelle was handmade.

The gnocchi with Spanish pork ragu was quite good.

Both pastas were decent, but they didn’t pack a punch like Garibaldi.

Tiramisu was good both the traditional version as well as the limoncello version.

Service staff need to be more polished with topping up sparkling and wine. They failed to remember who ordered what, which is expected for fine dining.

The staff that introduced the daily specials needed to learn to speak more clearly and confidently.

Worth a visit.
But won’t be my regular haunt."
"Small, Intimate, Authentic","Small and intimate restaurant, with truly authentic Italian cuisine (I had worked as a cook in Italy and am very picky about my Italian food). They offer pasta in tasting as well as full portions. To my disappointment, they did not have clams for the spaghetti vongole when I went. I ordered the burrata, which was among the best burrata I have ever had (surpassing any burrata I have ever had in Italian restaurants in the US). The service was friendly and courteous."
"Standards are dropping fast, and badly","I remembered my lunch being very memorable the first time I ate here earlier this year. However, I went back today again and the standards for the food dropped so much!! We had the dried beef antipasti and the prosciutto with the burrata. Portions of the meat to lettuce ratio was so pathetic!!!! There was barely any pecorino too? It was sliced so thinly it might as well not have been there. It just felt like a balsamic lettuce salad. Very disappointing. Even the prosciutto with the burrata portion was terrible. The portions were so measly (so little prosciutto) compared to what we had earlier on this year. The rest were just subpar as well to earlier standards. Don’t think I would like to come back again or recommend this to anyone."
Still as lovely after the renovation...,"I have been dining at La Strada for the past few years, and I have been back a few times after the refurbishment.

La Strada has a different vibe these days. It's now more cosy, peaceful and personalized... Be it in the little private table or open dining hall, we felt very much at ease.

On my last visit with my family, we were very well taken care of by Amber. All our dietary facies and different requirements were definitely met. The revised menu caters to a wider range of diners whilst retaining its unique flavours and preparation.

I will be looking forward to my return to La Strada and am salivating even thinking of the breads! Of course, we would be most delighted if we are to be tended to by Amber again!"
Awesome food!,"Loved the place after their renovations - went from rustic to something more posh and fitting of the food at the place.

Menu has grown too since my last visit and everything we had was great - Wagyu carpaccio, burrata, foie gras and tasting size of their pastas.

Ambience was great, staff were awesome, friendly and attentive despite it being a busy night.

15/10 would go again!"
Restaurant with the WOW! Factor,"As part of the Les Amis group. Yet another fine restaurant serving Italian cuisines. Swift and friendly service, excellent tastes and fresh ingredients. Recommend the Australian King Prawn starter and the Grilled Sea Bream for the mains. My husband had soup and the Ossobucco for main. These dishes including a bottle of Italian wine amount to S$221"
Excellent Value!,Lovely restaurant serving very tasty Italian food. Have eaten there on a number of occasions. Excellent value and good service from staff like Raju etc. The set menus provide excellent value for money. Hope they keep it up!
Very good food and services,"Had lunch with my wife at this restaurant.
Had a great time and enjoyed a very nice 3-set lunch menu. Everything was good from appetizer to dessert.
The best is the grilled rib-eye. Carbonara pasta was also very good.
Very good services and worth the price."
"I like la strada, consistently good but prices getting steeper","I want to like la strada, i think its one of the most consistent and better italian restaurants in singapore, even more so than some of the more famous ones.
the bill set us back to a little over $100 for 2 starters 2 pastas and no mains and a glass of white..
the price is now more expensive after their renovation which means i might visit this place less and less. also carbonara seems like to be a little lesser version from the previous version at a more expensive price tag."
Delicious food in quaint setting,I went here with a friend for a dinner on a Friday night and we had a lovely time. It reminded me of a restaurant in NY - small and quaint with excellent food and service. The wine list was abundant and we ended up with an French red that was affordably priced. We started with an amazing plate of tasty pork charcuterie. My entree of saltimbocca was incredibly delicious. Then we finished with some tasty gelato. Overall a very nice experience.
Yummy food but a little pricey,"This is one of the restaurants that I come back to every time I visit Singapore. The carbonara & limoncello tiramisu is absolutely fabulous. We tried the other dishes (e.g. salmon) but found that is was not exactly to our taste - the fish smell was too strong for us.

I miss the old homey deco but the new swanky look is quite nice too. A little on the pricey side but for my faves, I’ll still come back on my next visit to Singapore."
What happened to one of my favourites?,"La Strada used to be one of my favs. Decor was v homely and old-school, service polished and sincere, food was good (the burrata with ham oh my) and I was willing to pay.
We visited the newly renovated restaurant and I missed the old one so much. Don't think I will go back anytime soon.
1. Decor lacks.. positioning. Is it trying to be a hipster bar-counter sort of restaurant? An Italian food court? A cafe? I can't tell. It is just.. not classy, not ugly. Just food court-ish. No table cloth even, at this price range.
2. Service is v sincere but where are the polished staff? Staff looks blur. Polite, efficient but blur.
3. No more complimentary bread (I used to love their bread dipped with olive oil. Now pane goes for $8)
4. Our food took a very very long time to come, we almost cancelled.

What was good:
1. Food is good, that remained. And so were the wine options. Good variety good wine. Pity that prices seemed even higher (but there are smaller tasting portions vs full portions to pick from now - I just find it weird. Food seems more upmarket but the whole setting is really just a foodcourt)
2. They gave us complimentary tiramisu to apologise for the long wait in food- that was a very nice gesture.
3. staff tried, so we appreciated that.
So three stars."
Eviva italia,"It took my a while to find an Italian restaurant in the area here that got my excitement!

La Strada became a pleasant surprise and for sure my favorite Italian Restaurant here.

The Vongole in white wine sauce with the poached egg made a perfect start. The main course excelled with the ossobucco with the saffron rice. The lobster spaghetti was equal nice and tasty.

The perfect closing made the wet tiramisu exactly in the consistency it had to be.

Grazzie Mille e a presto"
Fabulous dining experience!,"We have eaten lunches and dinners at La Strada many times. Food, wine and service have always been great. Often, we would ask Ben, Restaurant Manager and Sommelier to bring us food and wine... he knows what we like and then find out if our friends have any dietary restrictions or preferences. We do not have to fret over what we want to eat or drink... we just sit back and enjoy our meals. Dalton, Executive Chef and his team do whip up amazing dishes. La Strada is our go to restaurant in Shaw Centre, Singapore."
A good place in Orchard Road to enjoy quality Italian fare,La Strada has constantly dished out good Italian fare. It recently closed for renovation for a couple of weeks. The quality of food has not dropped.and its regular patrons have returned again. Service staff are very attentive and helpful.
Nice Italian testo,"Nice Italian Resto. Salad, steak, ice cream that i try is very nice. Recommended to try with colleague or family."
Great deal for a set lunch,"We went to La Strada for a Sunday lunch. Their menu is big and different from other Italian restaurants. For $42 you get antipasti, main dish, dessert, tea or coffee. Great quality of food. Lamb chop (agnello) was excellent, very soft, and my friends all agreed it was the best dish on the table. Their pastas are quite nice too. And desserts - yummy! Try the cannoli with ricotta cheese, they are delicious!"
Great food!,"Celebrated my husband's birthday at this restaurant. I must say, this is one of the best Italian food I ever had! Great Burrata, great Gnocchi, their pasta was good. All 5 of us in the family enjoyed the food very much! I guess the only concern is the noise - it is a rather small restaurant so the acoustic is a bit of issue - we could hardly hear each other talk across the table! May be it was a crowded night and may be it is just a typical Italian restaurant which is supposedly to be loud and noisy? Whatever it is, you want great Italian food and willing to pay a bit more for good quality food, that's where you should go! Definitely will go again - once a while since it is quite expensive. Great location though - easy access! My husband was happy! :)"
Great value set lunch,"Small cosy (noisy and crowded when full!) Italian restaurant with an amazingly good value 3-course set lunch even on weekends at $35/-!
There’s a wide selection of appetisers and main courses. The servings are generous and the same as if it were ordered from the ala carte menu.
We loved the carpaccio, vegetable soup with garlic bread, burrata for appetisers and the linguine alio olio, lobster pasta and risotto. The crab meat pasta from the ala carte menu was pretty good too.
The limoncello tiramisu was a lovely and unique end to an excellent meal.
Service was prompt and responsive despite the full restaurant. Would highly recommend reservations."
Consistent and authentic,"My wife and I enjoyed coming to La Strada for the Italian fix from time to time. It continues to produce consistent and delicious Italian dishes over the years. It's reliable.

Atmosphere was relaxing and service was friendly. Wines were appropriate. We also liked their specials written on the blackboard.

It's a place for Italian comfort food."
Authentic Italian with a very good-value set lunch,"La Strada at Shaw Centre– along the street called Claymore Hill; hence named The Street I reckon - is a restaurant in Singapore I would recommend for a full Italian meal. It is not a very big restaurant but rather a cosy trattoria and yet the food speaks volumes.

It is more than pasta and pizzas (actually I don’t think they even serve pizzas). Their carbonara is authentically made with eggs confit and not thickened with cream. I saw other interesting pastas with lobster, octopus and even truffles being served to other tables.

I have been yearning for an escalope and so tried their turkey scaloppini (cant remember what they call it in the menu). It was nicely flattened, tenderized, breaded and optimally fried without tasting too oily nor dry. It comes with a Pomodoro sauce on the side and well complemented with Brussel sprouts, slightly charred on the edges.

Eating this reminds me of a full sit-down dinner during my first visit to Italy years ago: a refreshing salad, then a plain (sans meat) but hearty pasta and then a simple piece of meat followed by dolce. Of course, with lots of vino and family and friends on a long table.

What is of very good value at La Strada is their set lunches at S$35 for three courses with coffee and tea thrown in. If I’m not wrong, most of the menu items are offered as part of the set lunch with some variations such as additional charges for the expensive items. I say good value too because the portions are not down-sized as with other’s set meals. One should also check out their daily specials on the board.

Service is consistently good as with their other Les Amis group of restaurants. I like it when the waiters know their food and are attentive. The first impression is also good when they don’t merely offer water as sparkling or still but rather iced or warm water too."
Amazing restaurant and amazing service,"Went there to celebrate friend's birthday. Food was above average with a good selection of appetizer, pasta, mains and drinks. We had the grilled octopus for sharing. She ordered the veal and I had the lobster pasta in pomodoro sauce. What was outstanding was the service. The wait staff were very friendly. They topped up the water the entire evening without being asked to. Prior to my friend's arrival, I enquired if they could help to prepare a slice of cake or dessert and the friendly manager recommended two different varieties of tiramisu and asked for her name. We had the tiramisu with her name spelled correctly next to it. When I asked for the bill, I realised the tiramisu was not reflected on it. The wait staff explained it was on the house! What a delight! Thank you very much La Strada! The restaurant was packed, so do remember to make a reservation before going."
Small rustic Italian restaurant. Above average prices. Normal service. Ok food. Small portions.,"A friend recommended me this place. She had delicious scallops, carbonara and tiramisu dessert here recently.

So another friend and I decided to go there to celebrate her birthday during lunch time.
When I arrived there I was abit surprised at the oldish small place. Let's call it, rustic.
I wasn't quite pleased with the seating arrangement as it's facing the kitchen and all types of flavors were emitting from it. Maybe they should have a door / curtain to block that and better aesthetics.

The set lunch menu supposedly is $35++ per pax but if you select certain items, it's an extra cost of $3 or $4. Which I felt it's unnecessary to charge an extra fee for these so-called premium selections.

Set lunch for two. We ordered Beef carpaccio (+$3), scallops appetizers (+$4). Saltimbanco veal (+$4?), carbonara as mains. Chocolate salami, lemon tiramisu (+$4?) & coffee/tea dessert. I can't really remember the extra fee for certain items but total bill for 2 with taxes was almost $95. No exactly cheap or value for money.

We ordered different items to share for taste since it was our first time there.
I enjoyed the appetizers. The scallops were tasty and juicy. Very nicely done, with crispy garlic and mushrooms + I think cauliflower purée. The beef carpaccio was yummy too. Fresh arugula leaves, creamy salad sauce and Parmesan shavings on top of thinly sliced raw beef. Nicely done.
The mains disappointed though. The carbonara was tasty but not WOW. Maybe I expected too much. The portion was not much.
My friend's veal, she was quite disappointed with it. It was a ""naked"" thin piece of meat on a plate with a bowl of salad on the side. The meat was quite tough and hard to cut. I thought the taste was ok but kinda tough. I thought maybe a couple of roasted potatoes on the side would have even better.
The desserts were ok. The chocolate salami was rather nice. Like a chocolate truffle with nuts. The lemon tiramisu was abit of a disappointment. It wasn't bad. But just like a bowl of soaked sponge cake with cream topped over. Nothing impressive.
Would I be back? Nothing really wowed me. I'm not sure if I would go back anytime soon. Not a bad meal but I'm sure I can get something superb for $100/ 2 Pax."
Great set lunches & value for money,"We come to this outlet regularly where the food is consistently good. The set lunches are very good value.

As regulars; & not to be bored with their menu, they have seasonal specials as with my luncheon today.

Starters: Seaweed pasta with caviar & uni. For mains: a crispy duck leg, followed by a Black Forrest tart by Janice Koh which is adjacent to La Strada.

But be warned, the seasonal dishes are not cheap. You need to consider these items as a treat !

Self pampering solo dinner,"It was meant to be a dinner for 4 but it became a solo dinner when the other 3 friends couldn't meet because of unforeseen circumstances. I took the brave step to proceed with dinner alone because I've read good reviews of this restaurant. It was a fulfilling one for my palate and tummy. I can't give the Italian names of the items I ordered. In simple words, the breadsticks as starter was a treat (I bought some home for my kids as after dinner snack), clear soul with vegetables and clumps of melted cheese (comfort food) and the main which was a seared sole fish (I had mine deboned) with pine nut pesto. See my photos.
The only regret was not having company to share any desserts.
I will be back again for more!"
Fabulous food and service.,This restaurant is the best you will find in and around Pitesti. Large extensive menu great large servings of healthy food. Also large extensive news and wine menu. There salad are full of fresh fruit and veggies and their spaghetti bolognaise ia to die for. Try their lemon drink. Freshly squeezed lemon with honey and mineral water. Look doe the sign in the street and there is parking out the back. Lovely outdoor deck that has a lovely beeeze
No regrets !,"Made reservations for a lunch at La Strada, specifically asking for a quiet table to celebrate friend's birthday. Restaurant confirmed my booking too. We ordered mussels and salmon for starters, gnoochi and beef for mains and the desserts were all good. The two servers were prompt and good (they worked hard). They even remember to add a little candle on my friend's dessert for good cheer even thou' I didnt ask for it. Hope the management will pass along my appreciation to both the servers and kitchen staff !"
Good service marred by dissapointing food,"Read quite a bit of good reviews on La Strada. Decided to have lunch.

Positive :
Staffs are extremely friendly and service orientated.

They did a pretty ok job on service recovery.

Negative

Ordered the set menu. May be that's the mistake I made. The price at $35 for Soup, main ,dessert and Coffee was a steal for this place ..

Alas the food was very disappointing .

When u get each course within the next few minutes you know it's not well prepared. Or it's readily available.

The tuscan chickpea and kale soup was different. Felt it was diluted. First time left a soup not finished.

Then came the clams and spicy sausage linguine.. It as just aweful. There was no flavour and the clams had not been cleaned well as I was biting into alot of sand. .Looked like the sand was not purged well. I practically left it untouched.

The dessert Limoncello tiramisu. Was a wrong choice for me . Very sweet and little of the tiramisu. My bad on the choice.

Overall

Not sure if I had gone for ala carte the food might have been different. But a pricer choice.

Might give it another go on ala carte..and hoping it will be better.

Not the experience was hoping for."
Delicious,"Good value 3 course lunch that we could choose from the menu. My hot appetizer was mussel with light tomato sauce, so succelent. Main was braised lamb shank, tender and tasty sauce. Finished with cheese platter. My son chose braised sausage and lentils then spaghetti carbonara and finished with chocolate cake. Friendly staffs and efficient services."
Best value set lunch,"La strada. Nice little italian resto by famous les amis grp Singapore.

We tried their set lunch menu.

Everything were very good. From appetizer to desserts.

Prices was ok. We spent sgd 200 for 3 people with @ 1 drink

Their tiramisu was great

Will come back again"
Nice Italian,"They usually have branzino, and the rest of the usual Italian food is good too, one of six places right next to each other all owned by same people, all very solid and good."
"Lovely service, average food","Went to try this place out after reading positive reviews about the food here, including a couple of reviews stating that this restaurant offers the best carbonara in Singapore. Sadly, that probably set us up for disappointment.

We were there for the lauded set lunch. The service is the best part about this place – attentive but unobtrusive, among the best in the business. The ambience is very traditional, giving a distinctly Italian home feel, which would be reflected in the food we ended up eating.

The appetizers were really good, and turned out to be the best part of the meal. The shellfish were all incredibly fresh and plump, and a great deal as part of the set lunch, although we would've preferred the clams to be in a clear white wine, rather than marinara, sauce. The mains were generally let down by a lack of imagination. The lauded carbonara turned out to be underseasoned and did not tickle our tastebuds, despite its fresh ingredients. The side salad accompanying the veal scallopino, while generously portioned and featuring fresh greens, tasted heavy and uninspired, owing to the balsamic dressing. A zestier, lighter dressing would have helped to alleviate the heaviness of the meat dish. Desserts-wise, the lauded limoncello tiramisu ended up on our table looking like an indistinct dollop thrown onto a bowl, tasted pretty much the same, while the panna cotta was alright, with a generous sprinkling of walnuts.

The freshness and quality of the seafood and produce, as well as the warm service, would probably be the biggest draw if we were ever in need of a place to eat in the area again, but it's hard to imagine this place drawing in new diners without much creativity evident in the dishes."
Definitely 4 1/2 stars...fantastic,"Fantastic dinner & excellent service. Both of us started with the seasonal special of white asparagus, prosciutto and poached egg, followed by the T-bone steak...beautifully prepared. Plus truffle mash, greens. And a bottle of 2007 Teroldego. Looking forward to going back!!"
Cosy Ambiance & Great Food,"Came in here last night without reservations. Place was almost full at dinner time, thankfully we still were able to get a table. We shared a starter salad, and tried the carbonara and crab pasta, and white wine. The pastas were delicious, and the service was friendly and prompt. Would come back again!"
Great Little Italian,"Great little place with warm friendly service and very nice food. Burrata and ham was delicious and fresh, and the Ravioli and the Carbonara were equally good. Fresh ingredients well prepared in a lovely ambiance... I'd highly recommend the place."
decent,"it is a small restaurant off Orchard Rd. the place is nice, service is good. The food was little disappointed. It wasn't bad but neither too good. I just had a pasta, and there are better place around there were to eat."
Fantastic Italian set lunch,"Had a wonderful lunch get together at this venue. The place was small but the service and food was good. The set lunch was an absolute winner. We had 3 courses with well portioned entree, main, dessert and coffee or tea at $35++ each.

The steak at an additional $10++ was unexpectedly large, lightly salted and chargrilled to medium. Beef carpaccio was generous but with overly creamy dressing.

Mussels swimming in a rich tomato-based sauce were plentiful but generally small. Clam were succulent without being overcooked and tossed with al dente linguine.

Braised lamb shank was off-the-bone tender but lacked the meaty flavor. Panna Cotta was light and milky without being too sweet. Cheese plate was quality accompanied by honeycomb.

An excellent venue for Italian lunch without breaking the bank."
Birthday celebration,"Cosy place. Went there to celebrate a 9 year old birthday. Service was efficient and pleasant. Portions were decent. Had the pulpo and jamon to start. Good size portions. Mains were risotto (both options) and the t-bone steak. Only feedback was a tad under-seasoned. Sampled the barolo by the glass - exp. Too full for dessert. Good ambience, food and service but not great."
Cosy with great dining options,Visited this restaurant a few times and it didn't fail to impress. Good selection of wines and the carbonara is definitely the best in town!
Tasty and flavourful,Good Italian place - very flavorful and fresh - the burnt butter sauce was especially nice. They were very accommodating with us being vegetarian and made us whichever pasta we wanted. Definitely worth a visit if on orchard street.
Italian,"Go for set as its cheaper. Steak is standard, salad is good, spaghetti aglio olio is well cooked. Water is free."
"Good food, friendly service a definite must go",Was there to celebrate 2 of my friends birthday..1st for all of us..staffs was attentive right from the start recommended us some dishes to share and it was superb!!!..love the fact that the staffs are cheerful n always helpful makes the small restaurant like it's a family gathering and to top if off they even gave slices of birthday cakes to my 2 dear friends!!..a definite must go if u want to entertain people...love love!!!.. will definitely be back!!.
Loved this nice little Italian joint!,"As part of the les amis group, is expecting something awesome from la strada. Well, wasn't disappointed at all. Nice little place with my favorite spot by the semi circular topped windows, I love digging into the carbonara pasta and burrata salad. And ending off with the tiramisu. Flavors here are authentic, well can b on the strong end as well but perfectly suited for my palate. I loved that every flavour is accentuated to excite the senses and revigorate the palate however dull it was prior to savouring the food here.

TOP it off with a nice bottle of red. Service is better if u ask and be nice to the staff here. Not the most exciting Italian crew but certainly proud of the food served."
Buzzing Lunchtime Venue,We came across this ristorante quite by chance. It benefits by being off Orchard Road. Judging by the customers in it it is a very popular lunchtime venue. We just wanted something very quick as we were time limited. I chose Spinach ravioli and my husband had some gnocchi. We followed this with the traditional tiramisu. All the food was well presented and the service was excellent. We will definitely go there again next time we are in Singapore.
"Good food and wine, albeit pricey","We had carbonara, crabmeat pasta, Sauvignon Blanc and honey tart dessert, all good, one of the best Italian places I have ever eaten here in Singapore. Authentic Italian decor ambience.

Be prepared to pay more at this place, total bill came up to $173 for 3 pax plus 1 glass of wine only. food is good but small portions.

Service is fantastic, maybe it's because we were the only customers there."
"Fabulous food, very poor service","We had fabulous food at this restaurant. The gnocchi with beef and pork ragu was amazing as was the meatball special. We had thoroughly enjoyed our evening until we asked for our bill. On receipt of the bill we noticed that we had only been charged for a glass of wine rather than a bottle. Because we are honest we informed the wait staff of this error. Unfortunately, rather than being grateful for advising of the error, it seemed like a huge inconvenience to the staff. No ""thanks for being honest"" only annoyance at having to rectify the bill. I wouldn't do so again at this restaurant- it seems it wasn't appreciated that we were honest. Shame, we have just moved to Singapore and thought we'd found a great new Italian eatery. Disappointing that the fabulous food is backed up by such poor service."
