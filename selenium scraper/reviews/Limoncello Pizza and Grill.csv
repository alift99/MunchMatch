Delicious food and attentive service,"Went with extended family of 22pax to celebrate my mother’s birthday. Everyone enjoyed the food, pizza is really good, the thin crust type that I love. The pastas were on point too as was the steak. The bread basket is more like thin crust pita and it’s very good too. Appreciate the prompt service despite us being there on day 3 of CNY. They have two cakes available - both of which provide the perfect ending to a great meal. We ordered the 1 kg chocolate cake as a birthday cake. Everyone left with a full belly and good mood!"
Authentic Wood-fired Pizzas,Amazing Italian food inspired by the tastes of the famous Almafi Coast and beautiful decor facing the river. Our party of 4 shared the baked eggplant and the deep fried Italian baby squid and prawns. We then shared 2 large pizzas - Meatlovers & Prosciuto plus 1 linguine with fresh crabmeat We had no capacity for desserts.
Wonderful meal and excellent service,"Had a great meal here for our anniversary, was recommended burrata+Parma ham along with other dishes, all excellent. Was served by Shen, who was excellent in making us feel comfortable and made the occasion feel special"
Excellent service,"My friends and I really enjoyed our dinner here tonight. Egg plant & pizza was fantastic.
We also want to highlight the best staff award for the night, Peggie. I casually mentioned we came here for a birthday celebration and she surprised our birthday girl with a cake after our meal!
Service provided by the other staffs are also excellent! Will definitely come here again!"
Great food and efficient service staff,This is our 2nd visit to the restaurant and glad the quality of the food remains excellent - the service staff were very efficient and they thoughtfully brought a slice of cake with a candle for my husband’s birthday. Thank you for wonderful meal.
Best Italian I’ve tasted in a long time!,Dined with my partner and baby. Staff were nice enough (the man behind the bar was lovely) and the food was incredible! We dined at another Italian place further down the Quay the night before and it was more expensive than Limoncello and terrible!! Wish we had come to Limoncello earlier - absolutely delightful experience! Their draught beer on tap is pretty good too! Recommend the Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli!
Awesome Food & Ambience,Awesome ambience and food. Attentive waiting and great chef. Had a wonderful dinner with Family. Everyone loves it.
nice meal,"This is a very nice restaurant with attentive service. Very nice veal- a really good meal with good atmosphere near the riverfront, Robertson's Quary"
Great pizza and great service,I had made a reservation for 7pm on 3rd October. I had mentioned in the reservation that it was my wife’s birthday. She was surprised with a slice of cake after our meal. Great service and superb pizza. Limoncello signature pizza was outstanding and we will visit again. I would like to mention the Italian gentleman that served our table was extremely polite and attentive please inform the restaurant of this compliment.
Simplicity at is Best!,True Italian restaurant can be recognised by 2 ingredients: good food and friendly service. Lemoncillo have both. Outstanding al dente pomodoro pasta at perfection. Good balance of sweet and acidity. Friendly and welcoming service as you will find in a topical Italian restaurant on the Amalfi coast. I will be back
A great dissapointment,"A total rip off.

Appalling service and presentation by uninterested staff.

Iced water on arrival, No ice. The water was warm and at 8pm it was 29degrees C! Asked for iced water, they brought a glass of ice.

1st starter, Insalata Rucola. $12
Should be fresh rocket, shaved Parmesan , cherry tomatoes and balsamic dressing. I got enough rocket for 5 people, 5 cherry tomatoes, 4 shavings of Parmesan with no balsamic dressing. It was all soaked in olive oil.
2nd starter. Caprese. $19
Sliced fresh buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes in olive oil and basil. Mozzarella sliced and dumped on the plate with a pile of cherry tomatoes, (not sliced beef tomatoes as is normal), and no basil

Main course of Lasagne. $24 Home made Mamas recipe (using prime beef). What we got was seven empty layers of pasta with one bottom layer of minced beef. Not even hot, it was barely warm!

On top of the appalling service they wanted to add on a 10% service charge which I refused to pay. This was supposed to be a good quality restaurant, we got better service and food at the local food halls.

Save yourselves som money, DON’T GO THERE!"
Great experience,"Food was great, especially enjoyed the limoncello antipasti and steak! Outdoor vines were very chilled and not hot. Service was also prompt and friendly!"
Kudos to the service crew and delicious food,"Kudos to the service crew esp the young Chinese girl whom we chatted and unstd she’s working part time and studying, she’s really a good host and a true gem to the service industry ☺️
and delicious food as usual. Thank u for the lovely birthday cake for my friend too."
"Terrible, horrible place!","Terrible place!! It allows Google and other platform to list them as pet-friendly restaurant but it's actually not! I made a reservation on Monday for the Thursday evening dinner. and I added a note very clearly to inform them that I would bring my puppy. However, no one ever reach out to me saying the place cannot take pet until I was there! horrible service! Of course my puppy and I was rejected. I asked them why no one told me before I came here? there was a note. guess what they said? ""Oh maybe we never read"".. hello?! is that my fault that you never read my note??! The restaurant sent me sms to apologise and to explain that they cannot take the pet cuz they don't have the license. Why should I care? The problem here is that you don't have a pet license but you allow the web to list you as the pet friendly store! secondly, you never read your reservation note! Aside from that, they even argued that ""we called you in the afternoon but you didn't answer the call"". Excuse!? If that's about the cancellation of my appointment, does it hurt you to drop a msg??! if you wanna say you don't send customer msg, then why do you SMS me afterwards?! Not to mention, they call me in the afternoon just 3 hours before my dinner booking!? even if I got the call, so do you expect that I manage to get a booking at other pet-friendly place just within 3 hours?! What a disaster restaurant! cannot do their job properly and still wanna blame the fault on others! this type of place should not exist in Singapore!"
Every time a good choice,"The food is always very good at Limoncello! I love it because it is authentic Italien food! I often go to Italy and think that I can compare it! Lovely Pizzas and Pasta, but also the meat is fine! I love the antipasti pamigiana there!"
Outstanding food and service,"Thankyou for an outstanding dinner. The service and care of the staff and manager was above and beyond. The food was exceptional, especially the profiteroles."
Lovely family dinner,This is the second time that I’ve been to the restaurant the food never fails you and their service is always excellent.
Great Food. Great Place,Our first time at Limoncello. We love the location and the food. The lady who waited on us was great with her recommendations.
Had an enjoyable time!,Had an amazing time at Limoncello for a birthday celebration! Delicious food and lovely ambience! ❤️
Yum Italian Food,We picked Limoncello as a last minute option and were really impressed with the food. Loved all of the items we ordered and it was super value for $. Thank you for the super dining experience
"Good authentic food, poor service","Borderline rude staff who had no issues expressing their displeasure at normal customer requests. Other service staff looked as though they were unhappy - definitely affected our dining mood. Food was good- pizza, home made ravioli and pasta was good. May give this place a miss next time solely on poor service experience."
I book at chope from 630. They send email the day before and ask me to finish my meal by 730pm.,I book at chope from 630. They send email the day before and ask me to finish my meal by 730pm. Called me on a friday afternoon n ask me if 730 i can finshed my meal..is friday where to look for alternatives...getting more crappy
Value for Money,"This place has become one of our regulars now, since we love the food and even more, what we find missing in many places these days is good wines at reasonable prices .Recommend the Burrata cheese and Veal Millanese."
Limoncello at Robertson query great discovery during our staycation,"We walked by the restaurant that was very crowded on a Saturday night. We try our luck and approach the small desk at the entrance, the waiter staff was kind enough to find us a table even if for a short time.

We are impressed by the quality of the fish. We tried this imported Italian seabream, delicious!
We will take the time to come back even if we stay far from the area."
Worst experience in Singapore,"1 if there were zero I would have put zero. Bolognese was inedible. The waitresses saw that it wasn't eaten and didn't even ask the reason but asked if we wanted to pack it home??
The sea urchin pasta had nearly no sea urchin, and the tenderloin ordered was presented like an airplane meal. Definitely not worth coming back."
Great,Great return. After years- same great pasta and beautiful atmosphere. Very good service and very reasonable value for the money
Good Food and Atmosphere - But terrible Head Waiter,"The visit started off bad. Head Waiter at the door was rude and thru C-19 regulations in our face. We tried to explain we all were from the same household/family hence in line with regulations. He did not allow for discussion but we managed to get a table as per our booking in the end.
Once inside the waiter and food was great but the first impression left an mark in the experience."
Almafi in tiny red dot,We love the authentic Limoncello crispy hearty pizza and the beef tenderloin fettuccine. Service is excellent.
Ambience is classy. Price is reasonable,Love almost all the dishes here. Ambience is comfortable and classy. Food and wine are excellent. Definitely value for money and is my family favourite restaurant
Authentic Italian fare by the riverside!,"When we chose ‘ Italian’ as our cuisine of choice for our 46 th Wedding Anniversary, my son was clear that Limoncello was the place to visit for some authentic Italian fare in a classy yet friendly busy ambience! Having visited Italy multiple times, authenticity was key from our view point. When after a 20 minute wait we finally got our 4 person table on a busy Friday evening, we were glad to settle in and order. Mind you, all this after a firm booking in the non-AC sit out area. The ambience was friendly with a bustling atmosphere of a busy full restaurant. The waiters and staff were helpful though and our orders served at a brisk pace. For Starters, we opted for wholesome Burratta, Insalata Sophia Loren and Parmigiana Di Melanzane. For drinks, we had couple of good Italian reds. Main course consisted of Pizza Margherita and Calzone. Both were truly mouthwatering! We closed with the incomparable Tiramisu. The restaurant went the extra mile to greet us for the Anniversary with chocolate writing on plate! How very thoughtful a gesture on a busy busy Friday evening!"
Great place,My 1st visit to the restaurant n was recommended by my colleagues. My family enjoyed every bit of the food and we will definitely be back again.
"Inaccessible, profiteroles was normal, truffle pasta was too oily, Mediterranean seafood soup was great!","Would love to try more food. Service was lukewarm, decent but not fantastic, profiteroles was nice but not fantastic either. Truffle pasta was average and too oily. Mediterranean seafood soup was yummmmmy. We would love to try more variety of food"
Business Dinner,This is the second time we have eaten here and another repeat performance - food is Tasty but the service is shocking again
Limoncello Pizza and Grill,Great food and wine. Atmosphere and customer service are excellent. Have dined here multiple times with friends and family and always find ourselves coming back. Love the gnocchi and crab pasta here!
Casual sexism/racism?,"I seldom write reviews but felt compelled to write this as I am still very uncomfortable about what happened when I went to Limoncello a few weeks ago. For context, I am a Singaporean Asian female and my husband is Caucasian. There was a Caucasian (I think Italian) waiter who served our table, and it didn’t take long for me to realise that each time he addressed us, he would make eye contact and spoke specifically to ONLY my husband. For example, he would say “Enjoy your wine, Sir,” “How is the food Sir?”, “Sir, let me explain to you about this…”

Just to be clear (and fair), he did serve me too, and was polite at that, but he would never think that I was an equal to be spoken to, somehow. I finally decided to ask if he could only speak to my husband for whatever reasons towards the end of the meal when he was explaining something ONLY to my husband. After that, there was a marked difference as he came back to our table once to ask ONLY me about how I felt about the food. Despite that token move, he continued addressing only my husband (“Sir”) in further corespondences but it improved in the sense that he would also give me some eye contact after that.

Given my situation, I started to observe how he treated other people. We noticed that he similarly did not speak to the asian woman in another table with a asian-caucasian couple and he was at times uncomfortably flirtatious and close to this young Singaporean girl, although I’ll let her speak for herself.

This waiter’s behaviour made me feel very small, like I was lower in status next to my husband. My husband was also very uncomfortable to be the only one spoken to during the meal, as he knows that this is not the kind of dynamics that we have between us. It also made me wonder about what kind of assumptions did he have about women, or about Singaporeans/Asians. Or was it both? Would he have treated me the same way if I were a Caucasian woman?

What I felt was casual sexism/racism or both, and it is really not ok to disregard and disrespect a human being like that. I do want to make it clear that I did not have negative experiences in my previous visits and it was only this one particular waiter that I had a bad experience with. Service was always good before and the food was quite good, though it can be a hit and miss at times. Nevertheless, writing this as I hope that Limoncello can be more careful in this regard and I hope that no other woman will ever feel the same way that I did in this restaurant.

Thank you."
Nice food if u can keep to 2hrs dining,"Been to this place for the longest time. Nice wine, food and family friendly. Prob due to Covid, they keep their dinning strictly to 2hrs. They even told me that no matter what even if you have not finished your food you will need to go. Will probably return if they change policy"
Good Italian food,We went in for vegetarian Italian. Spinach Raviolli is really good. Four cheese Pizza & Burrata is also good.
Limoncello,Perfecto service! Appetizer was yummilicious. Seafood marinara portion was good although prawn was not very fresh... to improve seafood.. Ice cream great. Love the ambience.
The food was Great and the ambience was perfect.,"The location is great and the fold was awesome.The ambience inside was nice .Food platter cost around 30 $ average but then I say again ,it was totally worth it..we went in a group of 5 and we have wine and bill was around 370$"
Makeshift table next to door.,"We got a makeshift table that was higher than the rest of the tables in the restaurant, which made it an uncomfortable height to eat. The table was also just next to the glass door to the outdoor dining area. There were people who just stood there to chit chat and people who kept walking in and ou, which made the dining experience rather unpleasant."
Outstanding italian food with super service,"Limoncello is always keeping is standard high for a truly traditional italian food, burrata, prosciutto, seafood pasta are amazing"
"Attentive service, lovely setting, delicious ravioli","Limoncello is a great Italian restaurant. Have ordered their gnocchi.amd ravioli w burrata, both very good. One of the few restaurants in Singapore with good service too."
Superb,"Food is delicious and excellent service, will certainly come back for more. Staffs are very accommodating."
Reservation mess,"Reservations were a mess, got a table right facing their cutlery and store. Service and food was good."
Stuck with SHN? Dream Italian takeaway will put a smile on your face,"Imagine ordering from Australia for delivery to a hotel in Singapore so that a friend could be surprised with a delicious dinner while serving 14 days of SHN. This is what the restaurant manager Alessio was kindly able to arrange and the kitchen delivered a stunning meal. I was told the risotto with porcini mushrooms arrived piping hot and the burrata with vegetables was delicious as I always know it to be.
I am unable to go to the restaurant or order takeaway as I am overseas, stuck with travel restrictions, but I would encourage all SHN people to continue supporting local restaurants and none are better than Limoncello Pizza and Grill. It is all in the detail, in the personable service, in the willingness to help and to please, delivering outstanding quality Italian food. Not just pasta, risotto and pizza, but also great beef, fish, seafood, salads and desserts. Be supportive, be kind and above all be fair as they work tirelessly against all pandemic related odds, lockdowns and restrictions. There are so many variables in times such as these, like the delivery service, but I know excellence is always the aim at Limoncello, and they have always delivered. Whether in a hotel or at home, if you are serving SHN and can't get out, try Limoncello restaurant. Thank you Alessio. Well done."
Always good!,"We have been coming here for over 10 years now and they’ve never let us down. Food has always been good and very nice staff, good ambience too."
Great food. Great service.,"Staff were excellent, very conducive ambience inside the aircon section although 90% full, it wasn't noisy at all.
Burrata, Prosciutto Di Parma was yummylicious. We wiped the plate clean. Limoncello pizza was good n quite a big portion. Seabream fillet was good too. The tiramisu was one of the best in town. Surprised with the generous servings of wine. Will be back."
Consistently Excellent,"Limoncello is one of our favourite Italian restaurants and one that we visit pretty regularly. The food is consistently very good, unpretentious and authentically Italian. The service staff are very welcoming and helpful, and the wine selection is good and affordable. Overall highly recommended."
Good portion,Their food portion is big enough for two people. Squid starter is tasty and the mushroom dish very flavourful. Will come back to try their pizza.
Delicious Food with A Nice Ambiance,"A restaurant tucked away in the heart of Robertson Quay along the Singapore River. May be a little tricky to find because you’ll have to park your car and walk a little. But once you’ve located it, its pretty worth it. Not only is the food tasty, but after a heavy meal you can take a nice leisurely stroll down the Singapore River and for those of you who are into photography, the Alkaff Bridge is within walking distance to walk off the calories.

Lobster Linguine (SGD 39)

A nicely cooked lobster with a fair amount of crunchy fresh meat. Seasoned well and went along perfectly with the Linguine cooked al Dante drizzled with olive oil. Really couldn’t get much better than this to be honest.

Rocket & Parma Pizza (SGD 29)

Very generous amount of toppings and pretty sizeable. Absolutely dug the thin crust.

All in all a very nice and homely place along side the river.

A hidden Gem,"Thanks for the COVID 19 lock down. I must say this. I found this restaurant just by luck. the place of restaurant is not very easy accessible. Due to the lock down, packing food to eat at other places or at home become unavoidable. To me, I do not like grab food at all. So I pack and take away personally. During April 2020, I just packed something at M Social. the restaurant was just next door to Limoncello. I saw foreigners packing pizzas from that place and also waiter is also talking in Italian accent with them. I have been to Italy so many times, I am very alert to their accent. Looks like the place is genuine Italian restaurant.

So, I tried to ordered a pizza. Fantastic. then starts to order pizzas and when stage 2 go their for lunch/dinner, I have been their /pack food for more than 10 times during last year. I also broadcasted among my friends. All of them has a very positive comments on the restaurant.

I love their Pizza - Margarita / Fongi / Limoncello - Seafood very nice.
I love their lamb chop very gentle.
I love their calamari
I cannot say as good as in Italy, but at least 90% good.

Oh, forget to mention, they have wines bring to Singapore by themselves. Good ones, not costly but taste good.

If you want to taste Italian food, this is a genuine one. and price is good not expensive."
Best pizza in town,"Limoncello is a sing of quality and high standards.
Never disappointed, proud regular customer.
Best pizza in town try the wholegrain base, very special indeed.
Service is diligent and professional. On the week end expect a bit of rumble.. understandable as they are always fully packed."
Excellent Food,"My wife ordered Pasta Frutti di Mare. It was excellent. Can really taste ""the ocean"" in the pasta. Calamari Fritti and Calzone are equally excellent as well."
Solid Italian Restaurant,"We visited Limocnello during CNY. I invited my friends as I hear a lot of good feedbacks about this restaurant. Food was very authentic as you expect from a traditional Italian restaurant. They have some special out the menu and the waiter recommended miyazaki tartare and it was exceptionally extravagant.
Service was fast and attentive, they even brought us some antiseptic tissue before commencing the dinner, It was a very thoughtful gesture and well appreciated especially during this difficult time of COVID. Kudos to Limocnello."
Amazing experience as always😊,"I did not visit limocnello for a few weeks now and I still wonder why..:)
They have done a beautiful renovation and the bar area, now very fresh and elegant.
I have tried their CNY special this time, duck confit and it was sublime.. crispy and juicy.
Service staff is always attentive and fast.
We always feel home as they recognise us every time we go."
Opened for business during the first day of Chinese New Year,"We were happy to see that this place was opened during the first day of Chinese New year. We did a booking via chope app for 8 pm. It was running full house. Staff members were prompt and tried to accommodate to everyone. We had the burrata with parma ham- this was a major surprise. The amount of ham was more than what we expected. It was tasty with the burrata and tomatoes. The duck confit was well done. The sauteed vegetabled at the sides was done well too. We opted for gluten free pasta, crab meat. That was a light tomato sauce base. Prices are reasonable. We spent a total of sgd120 for 3 dishes and two glasses of wine"
"Food Ok, Service Frustrating!","Food ok, Service Frustrating!

We have been to Limoncello four times in the past month. We were beginning to like it. Probably won’t go back there after last night’s experience. Although the food is ok and the atmosphere nice (when there isn’t a huge wall blocking the river view), overall service is pretty bad and frustrating.

First I tried to call and change my existing reservation time and the man on the phone had no idea what I was talking about, seems they didn’t have my reservation and didn’t really understand what I was saying. No reservation even though I booked through Quandoo and received a call from them asking if we wanted indoor or outdoor seating and confirmed the booking on Jan 26. Finally, they acted like they found my booking and changed it. This didn’t fill us with confidence.

We called again to reconfirm our booking on Jan 30 to ask about corkage and again it was a struggle communicating with them. The woman on the phone said corkage fee would be $35 for wine and $50 for champagne. I asked about prosecco, totally confused her, she put me on hold and asked her colleague what Prosecco was and in the end they said $35 corkage for Prosecco since it’s “sparkling wine”. Great.

My husband arrived early and they didn’t seem to have our reservation and the table wasn’t ready. In the end we got a table. However, when we asked them to open our bottles we brought, our waiter said Prosecco is champagne and they will charge $50 corkage. I reminded them I called at 1:04 pm and spoke to a woman who told me it would be $35 corkage for Prosecco. So we brought a bottle of wine and Prosecco. However they changed their mind and proceeded to tell me I didn’t call and that no one ever talked to me and said $35 for Prosecco. Essentially calling me a liar. Why would I make that up? And clearly we knew about the corkage fees. They need to understand and get their policy straight among their staff and improve their communications skills overall. Sadly we’ll probably never go back there or recommend Limoncello again because of this bad experience."
Authentic Italian Food,Amazing dining experience with authentic and fresh Italian food served. Service was very professional and as per usual the manager’s recommendations were perfect. We will definitely come back Bravo
Review,The food was good and flavorful. The aglio olio was amazing. The service could be better and improved..
Very good,"We have been going to Limoncello for over a year now. Everytime we are craiving for pizza and to have a relaxing dinner this is our place. Table always outside by the river, the staff is good and attentive, warm welcoming everytime we go there. Food and pizza is amazing. I have been racommended this place even to my client and all of them where delighted about the food and the good wine. Good job guys, very well done"
Great Food. Great Service.,Had a pleasant time with my partner as we ordered the Limoncello Pizza and Burrata Ravioli. They were also accommodating with my request of surprising her with a cake at no charge.
Poor service,We were looking forward to our second visit and arrived after a very heavy rain. They could have offered us some extra napkins as we were obviously soaking but did not...then a waitress spilled our beer on the table and to our surprise provided no apologies. We immediately asked for a change of table which she reluctantly went to check the next booking to inform us that it was not available and started to change the table cloth without again any apologies... I thought I could expect better service here so was shocked and saddened by their standards.
Wonderful food and really fast service,Every dish we ordered was tasty and generously portioned. Prices are really awesome and service was fast for a packed Friday night. Me and my friends had an enjoyable meal and time there. Thank you!
Lobster pasta,"Lobster pasta as always is great (I ordered 2) but service is pretty dismal. Booking was for 2 adults 1 kid (high chair requested at time of booking) but no high chair was provided, had to request for it 4 times with different staff before given the chair. Bread basket was not served (and I had to ask for one as a waitress walked by with 3 baskets) - so the bread basket was served 10 secs before my pasta arrived and before I could eat any bread it was taken away as the pasta was served! Very messy service - you could see the wait staff milling around but sometimes looking very confused or unclear what they are to do or which tables to serve."
"Awesome food, great ambience, great value","It has one of the best pizza i've had in SG. Staffs' service are one point, helpful and always there but never intrusive. Ambience is fantastic, can even go for a nice long walk after your meals."
Wonderful Service & Good Food,The food was great for the offer that the restaurant is offering. The service was friendly and attentive too! The only thing was that I was seated too near to the door and it became hot after a while since the door was open.
Nice restaurant and decent food quality,"Everything was good except for the location of our table. Probably because we only could get a table for a limited fixed time for dining (7.00-8.30pm), we were allocate the table right next to the door to the kitchen, which made the already limited timing dining experience felt like a rather functional affair. It is a pity as the whole restaurant is actually nicely setup."
Atrocious service,"We frequent this restaurant every couple of weeks. Tonight, we were sat at a tiny table, just a few feet from the toilets. Not what you would expect for regulars customers.
Our entrees, a pizza and a pasta never arrived. During our wait, which was over an hour, we enquired 3 times with the waiter who kept insisting it was coming right out. We watched tables around us that arrived after us, dine receive their starters and main courses.
We ended up walking up to the counter and asking to pay for our starters as we didn’t want to wait any longer. The manager offers a perfunctory apology. He clearly didn’t care about losing regular customers."
Good Italian restaurant,Their lobster pasta and squid ink pasta is fabulous. Service is excellent and plenty of bars nearby to grab a after dinner beer.
Italianisimo!!,"Nice place in front of the river with an area to walk along the river. The restaurant quite nice place, comfortable, white color with a nice light inside. Very good quality of food and very Italian flavor. All good, the pasta, the salad, the pizza. Very good and friendly service"
Food and service are good but...,"Hygiene is an issue. The wine and food menu were so dirty I wish they wouldn't put them on our table. The restroom was quite scary. Only 1 toilet for the ladies and certainly make me want to drink less water. Read so much good reviews of this place but end up feeling disappointed. Asked the waiter for a good bottle of dry wine, he told me the SGD 88 bottle was good. Unfortunately, it taste more like a SGD 8 happy hour drink. As my partner eats fast, I was not even halfway into my whole fish, the waiter promptly took away the plates of my partner like in the Chinese resto. Our starter and main course are good but otherwise I really can't rave about this resto. I won't go back again till the restroom situation is better."
Italian masterpiece by Limoncello Pizza and Grill,"Absolutely amazing food splendid service and food comes quick, this place is one of the many Italian masterpieces. I recommend highly the Al Grancio pasta as well as the calamari. The ice cream melts in your mouth. If you get the chance to go here don’t turn it down."
Simply PERFECT...!,"Went for dinner with my family, everything was perfect, from A to Z. Professional and attentive service , nice recommendations from Managers and quality of food was over the TOP. We will come back soon Bravo"
Love the food and the view.,"Best italian restaurant. the pizzas here are sumptous and delicious. Fresh air, river view and lush greens just outside the restaurant. Perfect for a dinner date or celebration. See you soon."
Excellent restaurant,"Food was yummy, service was impeccable & ambience was comfortably cozy! It's an excellent venue for family bonding & special occasions!"
Best Italian Restaurant in Town,"Amazing dining experience Food was delicious and extremely fresh, especially the Canadian Oysters, Pizza and Beef. The service was very polite and friendly. Highly recommended, most authentic Italian food in town with affordable prices. Bravo"
Disappointing,"A restaurant CAN NOT call a bread base with cheese a PIZZA! Extremely disappointed for the misleading information on the menu!
If you want a PIZZA, DO NOT come here. They serve bread base or more accurate Indian Nanna base and cheese. Guys it’s NOT a PIZZA."
Overpriced misery that will make you sick,We ordered two pizzas and both my wife and I have spent the night suffering. I am still in bed the next day it’s so bad. They call their food a “pizza” but I call it overpriced misery. Absolutely will never eat here again.
Close to perfect birthday lunch treat,"I believe that first impressions do matter, and when I receive warm genuine smiles and pronto service as soon as I enter a restaurant (helping my mum in a wheelchair through the narrow entrance and adapting an appropriate space for her to sit), I am close to being sold; fingers crossed that the food meets up to expectation. The location of this restaurant along the Singapore River at Robertson Quay and its elegant white and grey decor make for an absolutely charming setting. We chose to sit at a big, bare wooden table, which contrasted with most of the more elegant white linen covered tables. It offered a lovely view of the outdoor scene through the glass wall. Service was very prompt as drinks and bread were served while we pondered on what to order. We decided to share a pizza for a starter and chose the Limoncello pizza with beef sausage, porcini and button mushrooms with white base, mozzarella and parmesan, freshly prepared in their own stone pizza oven. This turned out delicious with well-balanced flavours, something worth coming back for. For mains, we had two orders of the Veal Cutlet Milanese, one Grilled Lamb Chop (2 pieces) and two Grilled Angus Tenderloin. Although all dishes were tasty, we felt that more creativity could have gone into the sides to make them a little more unique rather than something one could easily whip up in a home kitchen. On the other hand, some people may be quite content with the simple vegetables offered with more focus on the quality and preparation of the meat. To round off the meal, we ordered Tiramisu, which was served in a glass. This was delicious, and one of the better ones we have tasted. We also ordered a portion of Profiteroles for sharing. This was also good, but could have been a tad more moisty soft. For private functions, there are two rooms to choose from, the B&W room for up to 24 diners and the Wine Cellar room for 10 to 16 diners. The restaurant, which fronts the Robertson Bridge and the shady tree-lined riverwalk, also offers alfresco dining. As it is separated from the row of cafes and restaurants further along the river, it has a quieter and larger private area that works well for us. My husband and I are looking forward to celebrating our 35th anniversary at Limoncello, and if dine-in is still not available by then (post circuit breaker), we will still order their pizza for takeaway."
Great experience,"As Italian I have to say that this restaurant serves a great quality Italian food!
I’ve been there a couple of times already and I managed to try many items from the menu. Pasta is always a great choice, and pizza is even better than in most restaurants in Italy! Fish and meat are delicious!!
The atmosphere is great whether you decide to go with family, friends, business, and with your partner.
I personally highly recommend this place"
Lovely service and amazing pasta,"My boyfriend and I spent our anniversary night at Limoncello - which was quite a good choice. We had such a fantastic dinner, having lovely pastas coupled with their in-house signature pizza. All's good, the restaurant manager was super accommodating and nice to our request to move to a private spot as well. Had a nice time, plus they surprised us with a cake - with happy anniversary written on it! Thank you Limoncello :) Would love to come back for the pastas again!! Definitely recommend the lobster pasta."
Walked in without a reservation,"Walked in without a reservation @6.45pm on Sat 29th Feb 2020, able to accommodate but it was very busy, now know why. We ordered the Risotto (as good as can be made at home - no higher praise) and the Seafood Linguine. One of the most tasty dishes had in a long time. We only had two of the many dishes available, but based on this sample you should be more than OK."
Birthday Dinner,Service was not too bad. But cause it was really packed. Pizza was amazing 👍🏻 Overall would recommend this place

Quite good for a beer and pizza!,Only had beer and pizza but very good with wonderful customer service. Group of 5 was quickly accommodated and offered a free dessert!
"Fabulous restaurant, great setting, service and delicious food","Fabulous restaurant, great setting, service and delicious food. Perfect for families and great outdoor area!"
Authentic Italian Food,"Visited this restaurant with family members for lunch on a Saturday. Ordered risotto, lobster pasta, pizza and lasagna, all of which were authentic and delicious save for the lasagna, which needed improvement as it tasted bland. Service was good. Very attentive staff. Keep up the good work.

Other cons: car park space is limited. Access to and from restaurant is troublesome as you required the staff to open the door for you."
TOP CLASS,Lovely restaurant situated close to the river. We were seated outside for our meal. My wife had the sea bream fillet and I had the calzone pizza. Both meals were excellent and so was the wine. Good friendly service with a smile. Well worth a visit.
Pizza was Amazing!,"I almost felt like I was in Italy when I ate the pizza at Limoncello, it was fabulous. The restaurant was awesome, the drinks were delicious and the service was excellent, what more could you ask for?"
Excellent italian,"Pizza top, pasta top, appetizer top, location top ...all great! Best italian in SG and management very kind, all very good! Impressive place !"

Came here with my wife, and we strongly recommend:

And don’t forget to order Aperol Spritz!
Make sure to ask for Alessio upon arrival, you’ll get the best service!"
Best italian in Singapore!,"Best italian in Singapore! We often come for dinner to Limoncello. Definitely the best italian (and real) quality food in Singapore.
I love la scamorza as “antipasti”, ravioli al branzino as “primi” and cotoletta alla milanese as “secondi”. Best ever is the tirami su! Just love it! Last but not least is the service! You feel like at home, and a special thanks goes to Matteo! He secures you get the best italian touch! Italy is not so far from Singapore with Limoncello around!"
Amazing Italian,"Had dinner last night with friends! The owner Mr. Fabio and his Manager Alessio are really attentive of the business and we had a great italian pizza with fresh Antipasti. The fish in acqua pazza was amazing along with Portobello mushroom. Great place, great ambiance, all perfect!"
Really Enjoyable Experience!,"Excellent pizza, great wine and great service. Thanks for a great dining experience! Will visit again soon."
Excellent,The staff were very friendly and efficient. Our pizzas were generous in size and very tasty. The restaurant was busy and there was a pleasant atmosphere.
Always a Great Experience at Limoncello,"I've been frequenting Limoncello for the past 10 years and it has been consistently good!

The food is never a let down, and it is as Italian as it can be, cooked just like how they do it in Italy.

I strongly recommend Limoncello for a hearty, genuine Italian meal."
Awesome food and great recommendation from staff,Love the mushroom appetiser and fish main course. Had the room to ourselves and service crew is attentive.
Very good,"I went a few days ago with some friends and all very well, the food very good and the excellent treatment especially of the waiter Carlos who was friendly and attentive at all times"
Great authentic food,Fantastic pizza by far the best made by Chef Emiddio. The crust and base - right chewiness and not dry. Highly recommended. Food is not salty which is great as it allows one to manage the salt quantity.
Like it so much,"I really like parmaham pizza and also the rib eye, its taste so good, i will come here next visit to Singapore"
