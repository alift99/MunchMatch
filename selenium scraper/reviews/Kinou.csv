Great experience with food and service,"Great place for a romantic dinner and also with group of friends. Food is awesome, and generous in the plate!"
Surprised it’s not more crowded,"So surprised this place isn’t more crowded on a Saturday night! Have been to other places more crowded than this one but with worse food. The food here was consistently great - every dish was good. We ordered the tartare, baby squid, duck bao and pluma. Drinks were also great. Had the margarita. Really a hidden gem!"
Exceptional Basque cuisine experience! will come back for sure,"We booked for a casual Tuesday dinner, and it was awesome! We ordered padrons - green peppers charred with black squid ink, the charred flavour with the ink gave an amazing umami taste; with cold cut platter - great selection that you can rarely find in Singapore, xipirons (baby squids), followed by the best dish of the night: octopus leg with mashed puree and foam of prawn bisque - this was the highlight of an already great dinner.
Great service as well, very attentive and friendly.
We will come back to try the other dishes!"
Chef owner Ben is creme de la creme!!,I had the pleasure of getting to know Chef Ben in Montreal and his taste for high end foods and drinks are uniquely refined. This restaurant only shows that he has grown to become even greater as a driven connoisseur in the wold of fine cuisine! Congratulations Ben on building an dinning experience that everyone can and should enjoy!
Below expectations,"A Saturday night out with husband. Food was good, but a quite pricey for the portions and quality. They apparently change their menu from time to time, and the one we had contained some errors (we speak French), which made the ordering process rather confusing. Atmosphere was nice, but same can be said for a lot of restaurants in the area, who are unfortunately more worth it."
Fantastic Kitchen and Team,"Fantastic staff who were unpretentious and warm. Food was excellent, 5 star service and 5 star food. Nothing more you could ask for! Worth every penny. Look forward to coming back... Pssss... ask for the terrasse"
Excellent. Great deal!,"Family brunch. Thank you @kinourestaurant the tartare, carpaccio and ceviche was delicious. Will definitely come back again and recommend to friends and family. Best to pair with prosecco on a rainy Sunday afternoon.. Happy hours are such a great deal. Will come back again to try the other dishes for sure."
"Yummy food, great wine, great service",Felt like being tele-transported in Basque Country… Just a perfect atmosphere to share yummy food and great wine with friends. Staff was friendly and efficient. Looking forward to my next visit to explore further the menu.
I feel in love - With Kinou.,"Kinou, named after the Chef‘s mother, makes you feel like coming home. A bit hidden in the corner of Teck lim road, it can be easily missed, - luckily there is a big sign at front.
Because missing out on this culinary germ in Singapore would be a big regret.
I love the Open Kitchen design, the buzzing vibe behind the bar and the hidden outdoor table at the back patio.
- where to start?
As a woman I feel welcomed and never uncomfortable, I actually quite enjoy sitting at the bar or table alone, finishing up some work and having a light dinner and a glass of wine, accompanied by small talk with the bartender, or with Ben, the chef - or Chris, the sommelier.
I am a big fan of the ravioli, the beef tartare- best in town, the ceviche, the home made foie gras, a experience in it self. The service is professional, fast and the staff knows about the menu, the ingredients and can advise you on your dietary restrictions or preferences.
- but remember; there is nothing to argue about the cheesecake. Jokes aside; it’s how it’s done and it‘s plate licking good till the last crumble.

It’s the sort of place you catch up with your friends after work, having drinks and some nibbles, - ending up late at night, as nobody felt like going home.
Or you come on a Sunday for a long, delicious brunch with your family and friends. Your stomach will be full, -
so will be your heart and soul.

Kinou feels like home. Entering the door, being greeted by my name, the staff remembers my favorite wine , - discovering every time something new on the menu combined with the old classics I always order, - this place is welcoming, warm and a refreshing experience in Singapore. Come and experience it yourself. Say hi to Ben for me."
Wonderful dinner,Service was spot on. Staffs were friendly. Thanks for the experience. Chris was amazing! Food was definitely worth going back second time!
Perfect meal,"Came here spontaneously and couldn't have been happier. Great food, great wines and great service. Definitely coming back!"
Excellent Birthday diner,"Warm welcome, outstanding meals: lamb and pork both slow cooked and grilled absolutly delicious. Don't miss the Basque sauvage for apetizers as well as chipirons. We'll come back to explore the carte of this elaborate and generous cuisine ! Thanks to the team !"
Great experience!,"Absolutely great food. The Basque influence makes this a true French gem in Singapore. Down to earth place with very friendly and passionate staff, definitely ask them for recommendations on food and wine. A must visit in Singapore."
Dinner with my husband,"Wonderful place wonderful dinner! Food is amazing, basque French cuisine like if you were in St Jean de Luz! Run to this restaurant before it’s fully booked! We will be back very soon for sure! Bravo!"
A Basque restaurant in Singapore!,"Being from the Basque country, I was so delighted to discover this jewel of a restaurant in Singapore. Not so often does the succulent Basque cuisine export itself to other countries and continents. It's a must-try for anybody who likes French food and wants to discover a traditional and original cuisine from the Southwest of France.
The food is delicious and authentic (go for the xistorra!), and the staff super friendly and mindful. 100% recommend"
Absolutely delightful experience,"We went for dinner and the food was absolutely delicious, even though some of their staff was not working that night, the service was fabulous. We tried different wines by glass and all of them were very good in quality and taste. Thank you for making our evening delightful!"
Fantastic find!,"Kinou is a small French/Basque restaurant on Teck Lim Street. It has quickly become one of my favourite places due to the quality of the food and the friendliness of the staff. The menu isn't overwhelming and has some incredible dishes with a twist - the duck bao is excellent. The more traditional dishes, like coq au vin and the steak tartare are also a must!
There is also a good wine list, with Chris always on hand to make recommendations as well as some reasonably priced cocktails.
The chef, Ben, is also a delight and his team are welcoming and unpretentious. If you want high quality food and a fun night out, this is the place for you!
Thank you for looking after us. Maria :-)"
A Night of Good Conversation,"What more can one ask for. Good food., good service and reasonably priced wines. The perfect recipe for good conversation with friends and associates."
Incredibly Memorable Experience,"We visited Kinou for the first time to celebrate our engagement with our closest friends and Christopher and Ben went out of their way to make our evening one of our most memorable since living in Singapore.

What started as a late lunch finished at close. The food and the wine was absolutely incredible but the service/interaction with the staff was one of the best I’ve had at any restaurant. No request was too difficult, they treated us like family, we were laughing and joking together the entire time we were there.

We’ve been back multiple times since and have been made to feel like we are real friends of theirs.

Won’t be long until we are back again."
A Must,"Thank you for the warm welcome !
The chef and the Maître d’hôtel are amazing! The diner was amazing with a true authenticity of the French Basque cuisine ! Well executed with fresh ingredients! The wine carte has a large variety of French selected wine! The atmosphere is very friendly . Highly recommended to everyone who likes authentic cuisine."
"Such a lovely discover, Kinou has left the best impressions.","This authentic Basque/South of France restaurant is one of my absolute favorite restaurant. The food is authentic with some twists and no matter what we order we are always delighted with our meals!
To name a few XIPIRONS, PULPO, PADRON, DUCK MAGRET, COQ AU VIN...
Chef Ben and Service Manager Chris are extremely knowledgeable and make great recommendations. Amazing wine, food and service. Can’t wait to return and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for something really special to eat with awesome vibes and ambiance. Ben and Chris are hospitable hosts and will certainly make your experience unique."
"Excellent French Basque cuisine, great hospitality n exquisite French alcohol with nice ambiance","If u are tired of any other food out there, this is a must try cuisine! We did not initiate the order, we left it to the boss cum brilliant chef Benjamin to decide our menu.

Every dish he prepared for 4 of us was a just nice portion n we enjoyed the food so much! The alcohol he offered taste real good,

Indeed a nice ambiance restaurant with delicious food, tasty alcohol n excellent hospitality that u won’t want to miss! We’ll definitely be back for more!"
Awesome Pre-Xmas dinner with friends,"Booked for a table of 5 and we were happy to discover their new menu and new 2021 location.

Great food, plentiful portions, awesome wine selection and very attentive service with a crafty selection of songs we rarely hear in Singapore! Well done Ben and team!

Highly recommended"
Bruno s review,Very friendly of mixed basque and Brittany atmosphere Tournedos Rossini a must Magret de Canard from well know region Quality price excellent The right table for the right ambiance
Lovely food and staff,"Very nice experience at Kinou. French authentic dishes from Pays Basque but revisited and refined with gourmet products. The service was great, we’ll come back!"
Wonderful French Basque Food,"Booked here as a last minute booking after seeing excellent reviews on Trip Advisor.
What an excellent decision, we had a wonderful evening with great food and ambience.

Chef Benjamin was a sight to behold working on his own cooking all the covers, but still every plate was delicious and beautifully presented. He even took the few minutes spare he had to check on guests!

Christophe was the perfect host, explaining the food and it’s Basque French roots…and keeping our wine glasses full !

Overall - a must visit restaurant in Singapore and we have rebooked for New Years Eve!"
A must go !,"great place, great food, great staff and chef. it is a welcoming place where you feel like home, with amazing food, in a simple and authentic atmosphere. A must in Singapore!"
A lucky find.,"From the days at Tras street to the current trendy Teck Lim road , Kinou seems to remain loyal to the design of a few visible concrete accents, open fire and good vibes.
The name first triggers association with Japan (or is it just me?..) however fast-forward and dozens visits later, I quickly came to realise that their Basque take on grilled seafood and land ingredients is equally mouthwatering. My personal top of the menu list are Gambas and Pulpo
As for the choice of what best quenches one’s thirst on Friday eve, after a full-on week ordering bubbles always looks like a natural choice. For those out there who are less complacent, take no shortcut and up the ante by asking Kinou’s staff to match your dish with a wine from their wine list - they have it all covered!
Such a friendly bunch and good fun always!"
"Friendly place, excellent food","The place is super friendly and the staff too ! The products are fresh and excellent, I strongly recommend this restaurant!"
Great dining experience,"Had a great dining experience at Kinou. Every dish was delicious, from the Gambas to the octopus to the gâteau basque. The setting is cool and relax. Even the bathroom trip is a full disco session. And to top it all, the chef and the staff were beyond friendly and welcoming. Will definitely make this my new go to place for dinner with friends."
Thank you Kinou!!,"To the excellent bartender “best” and service manager “Chris”; you guys made the evening a night to remember. The gambas “prawn” starter is a must try! Nice ambience, nice music, great vibes! Will be back!!"
Dinner at Kinou,Definitely one of the best restaurants in SG! The staff is really nice and friendly with a lot of good recommendations (on wine and food). I went there with some friends and we had a nice afternoon / evening. I highly recommend the place!
Favorite restaurant in Singapore,"Kinou feels like home, every time we are received like part of the family.
Food is tasteful and amazing. Ambiance is great and the toilet is worth a visit.
Favorite things on the menu are xipirions, scallops are melting, meet always perfectly cooked,basque cake is a delight.
Run there and bon appétit!"
Amazing food and service,"First visit and was impressed by the food! My friend and I had the Duck Bao, Squid Stuffed Pork Trotter and Basque Mac & Cheese. A pity we were too full for desserts. I'm looking forward to the next visit to try other dishes on the menu.

I love that House music was playing in the background."
Great Basque Food,"Great flavours and Amazing service and friendly staff. Went there for brunch, space had good day light."
Great place to celebrate special occasions,The staff had been so kind to recommend their menu and the food was amazing! Have to keep coming back for more! The ambience was also great to celebrate any special occasions. Highly recommended! And thanks to the staff for making our night great.
Dinner at Kinou,"Had an amazing night at Kinou! Amazing food, chef, staff and would definitely recommend my friends to Kinou Singapore! Worth it!"
Best atmosphere /food,"Fantastic welcome, place very chill, the manager was very helpful, very professional, I tryed the beef it was probably the best in town, the chef came to say hi to the table. Will definitely come back"
Basque menu was fantastic!,"Very affordable 5 course menu - $70 for my upgrade to filet mignon with foie gras! $58 if with duck, which looked great to anyway. Negroni was yummy, and service was great. Definitely recommend!"
"Fabulous food, fabulous service","Came here for a dinner with a friend. They’re doing set menus now for the 2 pax rule - but the set menu is so worth it! Great pinchos, starters, mains, dessert - the whole dining experience was fab! Especially loved the squid starter… must try!! Service was great too, chatty and entertaining. My friend and I will be back!!"
"Wonderful service, great set menu! Lovely ambience","Came with a friend and thoroughly enjoyed our time here from the moment we stepped in. Drinks and food were wonderful. Restaurant offers a 4,6 or 8 course set menu. We chose the 4 course set menu and it was well paced and delicious. Highly recommend for date night or night out with friends!"
"Excellent Basque food, service and ambience",Went a couple of times with friends. The food is authentic Basque with good quality products and great taste. Service was excellent. Really recommend for lunch or dinner with friends.
Great atmosphere and food,Authentic Basque cuisine and we absolutely loved everything they served. Great food and staff is very helpful with selecting the perfect wine. Been there several times and will definitely go back again soon.
Beautiful Flavours!,Had the Basque tasting menu for two. We were treated to such beautiful flavours - Xipirons were fresh and the Basque ham soup was tasty! Duck was great too. 10 outta 10 would come back here again :)
Basking in Basque Region in Singapore,"With all the travel restrictions, nothing like hoping into a short cab ride to the (Singapore) Basque region at Teck Lim Road for amazing Basque cuisine and awesome wine collection.

To add to the experience, Ben (Chef) and Chris (GM), both French, will enhance your dining session with the French/Basque feel.

A must from the menu, the GAMBAS A LA PLANCHA, BASQUE MAC & CHEESE, XIPIRONS & FRENCH DUCK MAGRET (my personal favorite). Of course, if you are a meat eater, the TOMAHAWK!!!

And don't forget to wash it down with the fine wine collection. Although some may be on the high end, seek Chris to recommend something with your budget, which I always do!!

Enjoy (BURP!)! I did."
Amazing experience!,Thank you so much for the Kinou team for this such great night! The food and service was perfect!! I will definitely recommend and come back
Birthday celebration,"Food was absolutely delicious, friendly staff and nice ambiance.Highly recommended.Will be back soon with other friends."
Lovely wine restaurant,"It is the place you need to look for when you have to date, gathering with colleagues, friends and family.
CHRIS is super helpful for suggesting wine from different part of France regions and explanation of why you need this to pair with delicious food and xipion and tomahawk is my favourite."
Ms.,It has a great Value set menu good to chill with friends. Food was awesome and crew is friendly. Will defo come back with more friends when its open for more.
Good experience,"Good food, amazing waitress. The whole vibe of the restaurant is good. And the food is also vey good! I recommend the xipiron and the rossini, super tender. Owner of restaurant also really nice, good conversations! Selection of wine also very pleasing"
Excellent All Rounder!,"It was a birthday celebration and we took a chance of going with Kinou, relying purely on the rave reviews they’ve got on Google. And we are glad that we did that! Not only was the food great, the service was beyond our expectations. We are a bunch of fussy eaters and the staff did not even show any displeasure when any feedback or out of menu requests were made. This really impressed us as we have dined at so many similar restaurants and they have mostly failed at the service. So kudos to the team at Team Kinou!"
Good idea with the kids too !,"Kinou is always a good idea ! This time we tried it with the kids, had a pleasant table and even borrowed some electricity for a last minute work thing ! Staff is so friendly and the food so delicious!
We had the “egg perfect” which was indeed perfect ! The txuleta was delicious too !
See u next time Kinou !"
"Great atmosphere, great food and drinks and awesome service. Just felt like home","Great atmosphere, great food and drinks and awesome service. Just felt like being back home Always with great advices and trying to accommodate your requests"
Amazing service and food,A very cool and interesting interior design topped with very good drinks and food. The familiar and yet sophisticated setting in the middle of Chinatown is one of my favourite places to go for late afternoon drinks and cold cuts. Highly recommended!
Great place to go out with your friends,We celebrated my birthday at Kinou yesterday. The chef and the team were amazing and so attentive. We ordered the tapas sharing starter that was delicious and then we shared the piece of beef with duck fat fries. Finished off with some gateau basque. The wine list was extensive and price were reasonable. I would highly recommend this place.
Great,"Love the food, the atmosphere and the great service! Both wine and drinks selection is awesome and the food is amazing."
Great taste of Southern France and Bask Country food !,If you’re looking for a lovely dinner or a tasteful takeaway for a great pic-nic with your kids in the area Kinou is the place to go ! If you are French and missing the great southern/bask country food it works too!
"Best food, super service","Welcome from the hostess was impressed, they really respect the new rules and safe distancing, food was fantastic, generous portions, tasty, good quality, service top, manager come to you table to make sure everything it's perfect, ricard are of course the drink to have. And the sicret drink . Super place to enjoy with friends"
Great food,The food was excellent and the staff were great. The location is also amazing and we will definitely be back.
"""FUNTASTESTEAK""","Kinou is a must to go place for dine-in/drinks either your chilling alone or with friends. Wonderful place has a great vibe of music, food is superb! Must try the tasty juicy steak, u gonna loved it. They also have a variety of wines/liquor to choose from! Friendly staff, good ambience, FUNTASTESTEAK!"
Hidden Gem in Keong Saik,"Amazing Basque cuisines with warm hospitality. Recommend the baby squid, slow cooked pork/veal and signature Kinou Txuleta.

Choose the counter seat at the open kitchen to watch the chefs in action.

Look for manager Chris and chef owner Ben for some serious wine recommendations and have the real Kinou experience!"
Kinou is always a good idea !,"French people missing home? Foreigners willing to experience the Basque friendliness?
Stop searching, this is the place you're looking for in Singapore !
Is it for a few delicious pitxos or for a juicy beef prime rib (or both :)), Ben will always receive you and put a smile on your face. Merci encore et à très vite !"
Fantastic,"Dinner, wine, atmosphere 10 out of 10. I will be coming back. We were lucky to be right in front of the chefs and watched all the action and the delicious food being made."
Excellent!!,Amazing food and excellent costumer service. Loved it and will be back for more. Definitely would recommend the Ribeye Steak and Cauliflower. The desserts were lovely too.
"Awesome food, drinks and staff","Went already several times at Kinou. Love the place, the ambiance, the food, the drinks and the staff is just amazing...."
Fantastic business Lunch,"I went to kinou for lunch with my business partners.
We arrived there and were warmly welcomed by the staff. The place is beautiful.

The basque menu they serve is traditional and innovative at the same time.
I strongly recommend the kinou’s special txuleta tomahawk. You can die for it. And need to finish with the Gateau Basque.

I also find the set lunch price very affordable.

Ben the chef-owner and Chris the Manager straight away made us feel at home

Strongly recommend this place."
Delicious food and amazing service,Been here twice but first time after it's moved to Teck Lim (used to be at Tras St). It's a lot more upbeat at Teck Lim and more happy vibes. We ordered 4 dishes and they were all really good - especially the beef tartare. Service was great too despite there being a lot of people. It did get a bit loud towards the end of our meal though - lots of shouting back and forth between the chefs and those sitting at the bar lol.
Amazing food,"The food was amazing. Got the tomahawk and no regrets what so ever. Enjoyed the banter with the chefs. If you enjoy smth like that, recommend sitting by the chef's counter."
High energy place with good wine & amazing duck rillette,"Refreshing mix of wine bar and gastro menu. Good vibes supported by interesting food, very long wine list and friendly stuff. Perfect for Friday night catch up with friends"
Great Ambience,Love the food and ambience Basque cuisine makes it all interesting in the flavors and choices. Great place for a casual dinner with friends
Enjoyable evening,"I went to Kinou to celebrate my birthday and I was not disappointed. Food was good (the duck rillette and pan foie gras was an interesting combination!)
It was appreciated to be able to stay sitting with our glass of water after 10:30pm and not being kicked out like most restaurants do since Phase 2.
I liked Kinou @Trast street I’ll come back at Kinou @Teck Lim road!"
Room for improvement but worth a visit,"Starting with the positives : Mo - the front of house, took ownership for the issues we faced and solved them without a fuss ; the food - was nice, different and all a repeater; the atmosphere - while we sat outside we could have sat at the bar and there was a good buzz about the place ; the bar man - dealt with our delay with an aplomb.
The improvement part : new venue this week so they had teething problems with logistics - certain things were not available on the menu ; service - this is what needs to improve the most. Even though the food was nice, if isn’t was for Mo, we would not return, but we will coz of him alone. We had to wait far too long, our order got lost, drinks too slow/forgotten. But once someone realised we were unhappy Mo sprang into action and saved the night.
We will return. The food, the atmosphere and for Mo makes this a place to give a second chance too. They will get better. Give them a shot."
Hopeless,Most unorganized place in Singapore Food ... Not worth to comment Truly kitchen does not know how to manage the food and order
Disappointed,"I was disappointed with the food at Kinou. We had the yellow ceviche, bruschetta, duck rillette & foie gras, cauliflower steak, French duck magret, and cheese course. One of the things that really stood out was the overwhelming salt in the ceviche and foi gras. In general the flavors weren't distinct, but muddled together. The duck rillette & foie gras was very rich and needed some ingredients to balance it.The cauliflower was just a grilled slab with an uninteresting red sauce. The duck main course was the best dish. It was good quality and cooked well. I didn't feel like this was not haute cuisine. I would definitely prefer to dine at Merci Marcel over Kinou."
Not recommended,"Pardon the long post.

I once came here for lunch about two yrs ago and i recalled I loved their ceviche but today’s experience was honestly downright atrocious and mostly because of the lady service staff who obviously has less than neutral intentions (despite her seemingly polite outwardly portrayal but you know when you can read the hearts of people through actions they display) and her attempts to push us to get more expensive items on the menu.

Came into the place at 845pm with absolutely no one in the restaurant on a Thursday evening.

1. We heard very clearly the minimum order for steak was 200g and also ordered 200g but it was keyed in as 300g and we were also charged that amount. If the steak had been good it would be fine but the steak came out half rare and completely bloody (we ordered medium) and the other half full of impossible to bite tendons and literally chunks of fat. And we paid $54++ for this. Staff insisted that 300g was minimum but I would trust both of our ears more. Also, if this is the standard of wagyu beef, I’m better off eating at cheap Chinese hotpot restaurant with better quality free flow beef than this.

2. Showed a Remy Martin voucher to redeem for 2 drinks, was handed one only and when asked for the other, lady staff then probably wanted to get away with it but then decided to be mean and replied the voucher was meant to redeem until 8pm (yes we didn’t see the fine print for this part) but honestly, when there’s zero customers, couldn’t you just allow some leeway? Also I bet it’s Remy Martin company paying for the drinks and it was a gesture extended by them to me, but yet the fulfillment is subpar. I eventually received no complimentary drinks which I’m entitled for, and had to pay for that one drink.

3. Ordered “fries” stated on menu and it came as sweet potato fries. We asked a couple of time and even upon checking were told it’s definitely just “regular fries”. Unable to comprehend with both of us knowing and eating so many types of fries and can recognize a rather over burnt bowl of sweet potato fries, was still told it’s otherwise. Granted they took it off the bill, which we are thankful for. But we were charged everything else.

4. The only saving grace is that the chefs are genuinely nice people and offered some free desserts to make up for the beef experience. The dessert are nice and done well, but probably due to the lack of customers they didn’t manage to serve it thus probably better to have us eat it than throw at the end of the day. However honestly we would rather just have our drinks that we came for to be redeemed and have a proper quality steak.

Oh also, their gambas prawns are grilled well and has a great garlicky taste. Ceviche as what I remembered is good also.

But all in all, sorry but I’m unlikely to be back again."
Just ok.,"The service is good I have to say. This is their saving grace. As for the food, it is ok but nothing to shout about. Not French/Basque food to be honest. The price is on the high side for the quality and quantity of food. Wine is expensive. Average bottle price is $150 with more than 100% mark up. Music is too loud and a bit too club-like when the place is not a club. Strange."
Disappointed,"As Singapore foodies we wanted to try this french restaurant. Even though the food is ok.. (I had the yellow ceviche followed by a veal stew).. the veal stew was more of a pulled veal but the taste was fine. My husband had the kokotxe which is pulled pork, in a way very similar to my dish.Price is ok BUT as french people we enjoy our bottle of wine when we go out but here.. no way. Prices are extravagant. The cheapest bottle goes for 90 dollars which is ridiculous compared to all other restaurants we know and there are a lot. If you are a water drinker then it's ok. Not sure we patronize again."
Great experience,"It is always a pleasure to go there. The food is really good starting with some tapas to share followed by a meat platter. Really great experience and the music selection is always nice. I will for sure come back with some friends. The staff is kind, a great moment there."
"Great food, fun atmosphere !",Starters were delicious and we had a huge platter of meat to share. Amazing food ! Really fun atmosphere with good music ! Will definitely come back again and again !
Never again...,"For diners who want to talk and catch up go somewhere else as the music is to loud to talk.. the wine list is very limited... For the price the food isn’t at the level your being charged, the service was ok and the team really tried to make the night. I won’t go back."
"Good food, great location, but service needs a lot of work","We really liked the overall food and drinks, however it feels like the staff are not all experienced and still 'panicky' the minute the restaurant got busy. We also got a bit uncomfortable when every 5 min a staff would come and offer us to order a bottle of wine - wondering if that was the hot item on their sales goal for the day? But as mentioned, food is good so worth trying!"
Average food and pricy !,"Very casual style of French restaurant.. Ordered the pull pork which was really good but the grilled meat like the ribeye beef was rather too dry! The bbq such was actually good. The grilled octopus is kind of overly done, the meat is kind of hard! The fried bun with fish with special sauce kind of unique. The wine selection is not that exotic and the serve ice is attentive .. very casual dining place and the food quality can further improve . Not a best place in the prime location I would expect.."
Amazing food with good vibes,"Well nothing much to add, the food is on point with very good product that were well prepared by the cooks, the wine is good, service is nice and the playlist is fun. Definitely a place where I want to go again!"
Xuleta,Went for the xuleta promo and it was so good. The promo came with a bottle of red wine. The chef recommended medium rare for the beef and it came with very mild blue cheese sauce on the side that blended well with the meat. A cosy and lively place that is suitable for couples to relax and for friends to gather. The staffs are also very attentive. Will go back to try their other Baskin fare.
How to make this place a pleasant experience,"This place is lively, the staff do their best to welcome you, the best is to go on Saturdays as they have a good deal on wine+meat dinner. Otherwise it is quite pricy and portions are not large.
If you don’t prefer noisy places, ask for a table which is not near the kitchen.
You may wait for the menu and order to be taken and served"
A disappointing experience.,"The place is full of promise. A nice spot in Tras street, friendly staff and an interesting mix of french and basque influence in the menu. Unfortunately the food doesn’t live up to the expectations, especially given the price - baos overly oily, the grilled prawns tepid and watery, could hardly finish them. Maybe we chose poorly but in the end we were left disappointed."
Kinou: when Epicure lands in Asia,"I’ve discovered Kinou for some time now, I loved it at the first sight, I kept coming back, over and over again to finally call it my feel-good one spot in Singapore !

With all the cool places shutting down lately (strange times...), it’s nice to see this one still standing strong !
Kinou, it’s a name and it’s a face, Benjamin, French from the Pays Basque (south-west region). This big bear welcomes you with his cap on his head, black chef’s apron on his waist, a pencil wedged behind his hear: he cooks, he serves, he pours golden liquids and tannic delicacies, he smiles, he jokes, he’s all out there. Like he said, he’s home.
And with, a great dedicated team to assist you all day long, kudos to them!

Ben is proud of his region and he shares his origins and his Epicureanism way of life in his menu: Tapas, Pintxos, Plancha. At Kinou, wood is the plate, food is to share (or not?). It reminds me of these nice cosy restaurants in the French South-West where you will just pop up with a bunch of friends, without plans or ideas, you just knew that you will be warm-fully received by a friend, eat good and typical food with a glass of wine, a beer, a special cocktail to cap it up!

My favorites: the duck rillettes, the basque Bao, the goat and chorizo, the Txuleta ribs and of course, the basque burger !!

Trouble is on the tap, wine is in the fridge, food is on the grill, friends are in the place. and a good time is in the mix.

Like they say, real food, real people.

The venu really cracks, and you haven’t yet seen the rest of the house !
Come and try!"
Meat wine $ cocktails,Saturday night Beef ribs Meat with wine positive and great team Music atmosphere Art decoration and spices cocktail Nice evening to celebrate an special avent or only to chill around with good food and nice people Must do in singapore
Great food/ Great ambiance,"Kinou is one of these restaurants that you fall in love with.
The food is fab and the chef is fun. Good wine.

Don’t tell the chef but my favorite part is the French 90’s playlist"
Really great vibes,"Went there for a birthday celebration and enjoyed every bit of it. A little more on the pricey side but the quality of the drinks I had and the service of the staff made up for every bit of what I spent. Very lovely place, already missing it and definitely coming back much sooner than later."
Great Ambience,A little on the pricey side but the quality of the food and drinks and the service of the staff explains it all. Would recommend for date night or celebration with friends!
Amazing Ambience and Great Vibes,"Overall a great experience, a nice bar with amazing food to pair with the drinks. Little on the fancier side so do dress up a little. Stuff on the menu costs more than your usual bar but it’s 100% worth the money spent, the effort in each drink by the bartender as well as the food by the chefs is worth every cent spent at Kinou. This isn’t just a place to have a drinks, their food is also amazing. Still thinking about the Creme Brûlée I had that night. Great place to celebrate a birthday, anniversary or any occasion if you have a little bit more to spend."
Excellent service,Love the ambience and the staff! Everyone was so friendly and welcoming and the drinks were amazing! Definitely a great place to celebrate and have a good time with friends :)
Must try in Singapore,"A place in Singapore where you feel like home, super curated wine list and great food and quality meat. Definitely a place to come back and have a good time."

Amazing food and service,"My friends came here for a birthday dinner celebration and the food was AMAZING, perfectly cooked and seasoned. The fries blew my mind knowing that it wasn’t seasoned at all but it tasted so delicious. Recommend the txuleta, kinou bao platter, bruschetta and the duck!! Loved the experience and would be back!!"
Expensive. Drinks underwhelming.,Expensive. Drinks underwhelming. Food ok. Not really worth it. So many better places to visit in this area.
Very good dinner,"We have just tasted Kinou and were amazed by the kindness of the staff. We loved the tapas, and tasted all the pixoas. The bao were too greasy for us and too spicy. Creme brûlée is amazing! One of the best I had in my life (sorry mum).
Definitely recommend the place. Thank you !"
Great night out,"Great tapas and great service. We enjoyed the food very much and wished we went with more friends so that we have more variety, this place is good for getting together with friends over food sharing and good wines. We will return again 😋"
