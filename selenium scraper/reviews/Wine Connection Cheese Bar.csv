Good good & wine & service,"A perfect location at the center of Singapore.
Beautiful surroundings and always a good wibe.

You can choose the seatings indoor or outdoor, at the resto or the cheese bar.

Food is good.
Wine is tasty.
Service is lovely.

I was coming to wine connection for quite some time and still looking forward to finish their wine list one day

See you soon"
Chilled and fun,"My wife and I visit Wine Connection Cheese bar on a regular basis and we always have a good time but this last Saturday was especially good. Cindy, Eunice, Zhi Wei and kuok Wei were fantastic and made sure everyone had fun. Nice to have music back and it was obvious all the staff were out to enjoy the evening and make sure customers did too. The food was also first class, I would strongly recommend the Raclette !! Thanks to the team for a great night."
Empty tables but not for us,"The outlet facing UE2 has 2 sections, one is full the other empty and not in use... it seems to be open but for whatever reason we cannot sit there. That's alright but then close it and don't let us wait for 5 minutes before somebody tells us that area is not in use... for whatever reason. Disappointing"
Filipinas staff being unfriendly,We came around 8:30pm Filipina staff Came to us at 9:30 and told us it‚Äôs the last order. After 5 minutes she came back and giving us our bill and she stand there waiting for the payment. Never had this experience that we still eating and waiting our payment already. 9:37 pm the manager came to our table and asking if we are done with our food. This is the food still we trying to finish.
Need cheese? Look no further for your fix,"Wine Connection is a multi outlet brand across Singapore but in this one location are two bars next door to each other: one serving the regular formula and the other offering an excellent cheese-themed menu. Along with the wine, critically, the cheese stock is well maintained and they know how to serve it. Exceptional Raclette is available but you need to get one of the tables where the heaters plug in."
Favourite wine and cheese bar ever!,Love this place. Will always come back. Very well taken care of by the outstanding staff. Lila Ensured me and my friends were well taken care of With her excellent service.
Raclette wonderland,"39S$ per person and you get a huge amount of cheese to melt, accompanied by a cold cuts platter, salad, bread, potatoes. A full and delicious dinner. You will not want to see any cheese for a while afterwards."
Awesome as usual,"Best service still after 8 years of coming here. Quick, professional and great prices. Cheese platter was great and the waiter was very knowledgeable on the different cheeses. Love the wine here. Will always come back."
Attentive service,"I visited the cheese bar to have dinner with my friend. The server, Peter is very attentive and friendly. Very accommodating and patient with our request. The meal is delicious too. I will definitely be back."
Disappointed,"I'm felt really disappointed with Wineconnection. I used to bring my family there to enjoy the best cheese. Ordered total 3 cheese platter. We requested to change our bread to crackers as usual. I don't really like the bread there as we love to eat crackers with cheese. This time round I'm not sure why is it not possible to change. The bread cost is $7sgd , crackers $3sgd yet I can't change? I hope that the option can be flexible as the past time."
One of my favorite places for friends gathering! Indoor cheese Bar rocks!,"ITs quite a few branches of Wine Connection is Singapore but that one is still number one for. They have a lovely indoor seats and It is always a good times and vibes!

Wine is awesome! food is highly recommended too ! Service is even better!

looking forward for the next round!"
Always a great experience,"I try to experience different restaurants but Wine Connection is one of the places I keep coming back to. The service is great, the food very fresh and there is a great selection of wines by the glass and at reasonable prices.
I love the fresh seared tuna and had it in a salad but yesterday on a baguette and it was beautiful. It went well with plenty of red wine from Malbec."
I called a week in advance,"I called a week in advance to get a reservation specially for the raclette as I had heard so much about it. When we got there we were seated in the corner outdoors, it took 25 minutes to get attention of the staff after which we were told we can‚Äôt have the raclette as there was not enough power plugs. The staff told us to wait till something cleared up; meanwhile we ordered a cheese board where they missed a few items, which took more time to replace. Someone followed up about the raclette being available almost after we got the bill. Im so disappointed by this experience."
Our Sunday gathers at the,Our Sunday gathers at the cheese bar. My first visit here. Impressed by their service here. We ‚ô•Ô∏è the Raclette üßÄ. Thx to Neil and Peter for their hospitality.
Raclette chillax,"Best raclette experience in Singapore...on a lazy rainy Sunday afternoon...with friends or alone, good spot for chillax..."
Good choice for wine and cheese,Came here last night for wine and cheese. We arrived around 6:30pm and were lucky to be able to get a table: surprisingly busy. Good selection of reasonably priced wine. We opted for a Chilean Shiraz for $32++ and then selected various cheese plates to compliment this. Very tasty and friendly service too.
Racalette was exceptional!!,"Good to see this restaurant open again after circuit breaker. Half the seating capacity as normal but wasn‚Äôt a problem as it was Sunday evening. I imagine a reservation is essential for Friday and Saturday evenings.

Racaltte was excellent and is really the highlight of the menu. An excellent selection of cheeses added to a delightful evening. Food and service were both outstanding.

Great ambiance, good air conditioning and excellent free WiFi. We had a wonderful evening here."
Great cheese!!!,"The service has been fantastic, amazing food and such a nice vibe. Will definitely come again!! Thank you!"
"Great wine, lovely ambience,","Great wine, lovely ambience, great service especially Tam. excellent value and a shop where you can purchase the wine to take home!"
Tam the man,"Great food, ambience and service from Tam. We ordered the raclette which came with large helpings of meat and potatoes and of course cheese! Thank you for a great dinner!"
Amazing selection of cheeses with interesting mocktail choices.,"We ordered the raclette, which came with salad, bread, meat and potato. The raclette was so tasty, and perfect for 2. The service here was amazing, they came to check on us every once in awhile. We also ordered the chili strawberry and the pineapple kaffir made by Tam, which were both interesting and refreshing!"
I always love this place.,I always love this place. They serve good food and wine. And I am especially thanksful to Tam who always provide the best service. If you didn‚Äôt experience this place please visit right away!
Lovely spot for after work dinner & drinks,"After recently moving to the area I was finally able to stop by and enjoy a meal at a spot I had been eyeing for a few weeks, the Wine Connection Cheese Bar. Being a lover of charcuterie boards and wine pairings already, the ambiance and attentive service (especially from Tam) was the cherry on top of my experience. Relaxing, lively and such a treat. Keep up the great work, team!"
A great surprise,Found the Connection Cheese Bar a little off the Clarke Quay hustle and bustle. Wine and cheese selections were fun as was the various side items. Service was excellent --- attentive and informative. A special find for an evening for conversation with excellent food.
Great Service,"Our waiter, Jude, was so friendly and attentive. The dinner was delicious and I also loved the mango/ginger drink! We had a great time."
Good place to drink and eat cheese but bad service!,"Me and my boyfriend decided to celebrate our late Christmas celebration here (26-12-19). We ordered a bottle of sparkling wine. They have many choices and affordable prices so I love going here to drink. We also ordered a platter of cheese to pair with our drink. We like it so much. Yummy cheese, nuts and grapes. The thing is we ordered for certain kind of cheese but they still gave the wrong one. Then I asked for butter instead they gave me a margarine. The Chinese looking lady who's serving us is not friendly and attentive. She kept talking to her colleagues. We've didn't complain we just wanted to enjoy the day. But on our third bottle of sparkling wine that we ordered they gave us not cold bottle. We refused to open it instead change to other brand but this lady insisted to put our glass to bucket of ice. And we cannot change the bottle. She also said she can show it to us. And the way she talk is very rude and proud of herself. They still open the bottle and serve the sparkling wine with no bubbles at all with is very disappointing. We called the manager and his really sorry. I don't have problem with the place or the other staff, only this lady who's very rude to us. ""Is this the way you handle your guest we know that it's not very expensive to dine in at Wine connection but treat our guest right. And no one drink a warm sparking wine! """
Great Service,"This place has great service! I spilled wine all over myself, and lovely Kati was attentive and very quick to help."
Cheese heaven + awful service,"Raclette was amazing and so were the accompaniments although amazing quality doesn‚Äôt take much skill to put together.
However, the service was not so amazing. We had booked weeks in advance for a special occasion and were seated in the shop section on the restaurant which is actually a different building with no ambiance, cold and customers walking through. We then moved after a wait to the normal restaurant which is very pleasant. You would have thought booking in advance would guarantee a nicer seat in the first place.
We placed our order and we only received the wine to find that whoever took our order had never placed it with the kitchen so we were left waiting for quite a while before someone new came to take out order.
We asked a member of staff for a menu and he simply passed it over his shoulder without even looking at us which was very rude. We didn‚Äôt feel like we were very welcomed here. And all staff looked very stressed even though it wasn‚Äôt very busy at all.

All together lovely food, awful service. So I wouldn‚Äôt recommend going for a special occasion."
Wonderful cheese and wine,"This is a great place to have a glass of wine and a selection of cheese. Not expensive, but they have the greatest wines from all over the world sn cheese: mmmm delicious!"
Cheese selection,We are recommended a very nice selection of cheese by Loges. And Kati was attentive in serving us for the evening.
"Chill Atmosphere, Yummy Wine and Great Service!!","Visited to catch up with a friend over drinks and didn‚Äôt know what to expect. Bottles of wine were very reasonably priced considering the location and the vibes are perfect for chill conversation.

More than anything, the front staff were great especially Prem who was extremely warm and welcoming! He put in the effort to bring on a little tour of your expansive cheese collection and to tell us more. I didn‚Äôt get a chance to try your cheese collection but I DEFINITELY will come back to do so soon. Thanks for a great time and keep it up Prem!!! (:

-Jacky"
Chill,"It‚Äôs is a nice place to have wine, cheese and cold cut! Some of the staffs there are friendly, especially one of the staff, Kati. He is very helpful and friendly. Have been going to this outlet quite often."
Amazing service,"We had an amazing evening here! Delicious cheese, friendly staff,good prices for everything, overall really impressed and would definitely return"
Disappointed,"We've been frequenting this restaurant several times over the last few years (specifically for the raclette) and have not been disappointed.
However, our latest (and possibly our last) visit dissapointed us as the amount of raclette cheese provided was significantly less but at the same price."
"Cheese, meats, wine... what more could you want!",Had a lovely afternoon (light!) snack here. We went for the two meat and 5 cheese option and it was absolutely delicious!! We also ordered a bottle of Sav Blanc which was so tasty - I would definitely go back!!
Great Raclette,2nd time back at this place for a good serve of Raclette. At $39 for 2 pax and a bottle of sparkling wine at $44 was alittle on the pricey side. More than enough food for 2. Place was warm despite the aircon and fan. Service staff were not attentive enough. Overall just enjoyed the Raclette and the company of good friends.
Lovely sunday!,Lovely to be back at this place. Service was top notch and wine and cheese were outstanding! Both inside and outside are nice places to relax and enjoy food and drinks!
Food Great Service Average,"Nice wine and cheese bar with a great selection of both. Located in a pleasant area with indoor and outdoor seating. Cheese platters and Raclette well worth a try. I have to agree with others though, the service was average. ‚ÄúWhat do you want mate‚Äù was how my order was taken. I was over charged also, but this was quickly rectified once I pointed it out. This place has potential to be really good, just needs the right people with great cheese and wine knowledge serving."
Services dropped extremely,"Little bit disappointed with services and very poor knowledge of stuff. Ordered food, women and beer but almost impossible to get all in order."
Worst customer service stabdard!,"They've lost a loyal customer in me, have been visiting them over 5+ years! Those high quality of customer service is not there anymore! Last three visits have seen a consistent lack of customer service, longer wait times, even basics of providing water is missing. Staff looks nonchalant, as if they're doing you a favor. Buck up guys, don't take your customers 4 granted especially in a hypercompetitive environment."
"Wast aware of this area ,fab","A friend took us here,it‚Äôs an area we weren‚Äôt aware of,such a nice classy place.we sat outside and had squid very good,I don‚Äôt usually like squid but this was battered and was delicious,so I‚Äôm converted now.lovely setting very popular area shame we are going home today or I would be back again"
Average,"Was a reasonable experience but lacked punch. A good location, and good atmosphere, very nice wine with reasonable pricing, but I found the menu unimpressive with limited options. Service good but needs to be more creative with the cuisine."
Cheese indulgence; disregarded service,"We opted for the raclette for two which was very enjoyable. They serve french raclette with bread, cold cuts and potatoes, which to our surprise really works well. However you would expect more wine pairing advice from a wine & cheese bar. You would also expect the servers to top up your wine instead of all hiding behind the bar or looking on their phones. We have visited many wine bars, where service is stellar and you feel the love about the wines and pairings. Unfortunately that was not this evening."
Must visit - Love it here!,"Whenever I am in Singapore we always visit the wine connection cheese bar! The restaurant has a good vibe in a great location, the food is amazing and the champagne is great!

Would definitely recommend getting the Raclette to share - it is delicious!"
Popular Place - Great Find,"We were in Singapore for four days, came across your bar on day two.Great find,really good value as well,found other places very expensive for wine,we came back the following two nights, myself having a lovely chilled Sauvignon, my husband drinking Merlot,both really good,our last night tried your mixed platter as well, nicely presented.This place was always busy,friendly staff.Wine you can try and buy.Many cheese choices, if your a wine drinker, this is the place to be."
nice wide range of cheese available,visited there as they always have a wide range of cheese choice for me to try. found a few of my fav and its at a reasonable price for ones who wants to find out what one would love eating or their fav. got a good recommendation on the wine range they had too so its quite an enjoyable time
Great concept,"Visited here twice during our recent visit for the F1 Grand Prix.

The cheese selection is great and they have many wines to pair them with.

Staff are friendly, efficient and knowledgeable too.

Extremely relaxed environment ~ casual dining / drinking at its best."
GREAT PLACE FOR CHEESE INDULGENCE,"I am in Singapore and goes to your Cheese Bar often. At least 2-3 times in a month for social drinking. Your staff Peter offers exceptional service and follow up. He is friendly and gives good recommendation. I would like to suggest if your establishment could offer wider choice of bread instead. As a consumer, I fully understand the cost, however I would like the normal french Baguettes since the cheese consist of french cheeses. Plain crackers might be another option as I am rather traditional when comes to cheese. Overall, the dynamics of this cheese bar is fantastic."
Bravo!,"Thanks to Cheese Bar, our disappointment to Wine Connection Cuppage Terrace was replaced by satisfaction in this outlet. Cheese selections are great with accompaniments as well. We had three cheeses and a bottle of Moscato. Prem was attentive to our needs, and even gave us a truffle brie in house. We found a new place to relax with a good pair of cheese and wine."
"Racletten, very nice!","We spend the night with racletten, really nice! never done it before, so it is a really cool experience. The wine over here has really nice prices, you get the best quality wine for normal prices! And they recommend you the perfect wine for the cheese! Excellent."
Great Venue for drinks and cheese.,"Me and my business partner had had a large day and wanted a quality finish. This place was not disappointing at all. Electric atmosphere (was a Friday but suggest it would be most nights) and cheeses were spectacular. Knowledgable and friendly staff , quality drinks and just generally a pretty good place to enjoy life. Wines and cheeses were first class. Recommended"
Exceptional service,"Had a nice baked Camembert and cold cuts and cheap, lovely, smooth wine with my husband last Saturday, 9Th of June. We really appreciate and enjoyed the service. Thank you Patrick Lai for the exceptional service. You are such a cheerful and jovial person, as much as we enjoyed our wine and cheese, it was really a great night! Will spend my birthday soon in the cheese bar!"
A gem in the city,We sat here and had a stunning platter made up of self selected cheeses and meats and beautiful wine. What a fantastic place. Loved it.
wonderful if you love wine and cheese,A great place if you love wine and cheese. A great selection of both and reasonably priced. A great manager who knows his stuff and is warm and friendly too. The service is great too.
VERY BAD EXPERIENCE!!!!,"Very BAD EXPERIENCE WITH CHEESE BAR AND THE NEW MANAGER!!! They forgot our reservation after we had booked and gotten confirmation emails from them. Booked Friday 13th April for 7pm and when we arrived they didn‚Äôt have it noted down and asked us to come back at when they called us. They never called us so we called them and they said table was ready and we didn‚Äôt get to sit down until 9pm!!!
2 hour delay into our evening and we didn‚Äôt even get an apology, free dessert or wine - no customer service at all! Very bad aftercare and after speaking with the manager the next day they said they can‚Äôt do anything to make up for it. Very very bad treatment from them and highly disappointed. Don‚Äôt expect much they have been the worst experience I‚Äôve had in terms of customer care."
Great raclette and wine,"So amazed to find this place in Singapore. We actually booked for their bistro but ended up at their cheese restaurant, no regrets at all. Had a great raclette platter for three which includes their meat platter and salad. Had a good bottle of wine to with the cheese and was a perfect evening. If I have to say something negative then I would say that the price for the additional bread we ordered was over the top. Should be enough bread served with the Raclette and if extra order at no surcharge."
Delightfully cheesy,"Went here for dinner with my Son last night.

Waited a while before being noticed that I was waiting for a table. Staff not particularly observant - or enthusiastic if you arrive at 9pm, which is the time of last orders.

We settled for raclette - the molten cheese. Absolutely delight. Being a Tuesday they have a promotion of wines at $20 a bottle - Chardonnay without too much flavour.

Great meal but service a bit hit or miss."
Good vibes,"Was invited here for a social event. This is a good place to meet up for a drink and some cheese. The staff are always around to serve but not intruding, there sufficient space to move around and mingle with the ground and the food is good. Till next time ..."
75 cents per cracker?,Went to buy a take out cheese plate today from Wine Connection. Asked for an extra portion of crackers as the plates never come with enough. They put 10 crackers in the box for extra $3.50 + tax. A beautiful cheese plate otherwise ruined by the lack of generosity and service.
The BEST raclette,"It‚Äôs a major recommended restaurant, we had the raclette and it was very delicious at such a cheap price also. The place is nice and clean with very nice staff"
Most of the staff were nice except one bald and arrogant employee,"My friends and I were there for Raclette and it was not a bad experience despite the heat and the lack in comfort of the bar stools and small table. Most of the staff was able to help us out very well except a bald Indian employee who might be in a supervisory position was very rude to us from the onset.We reserved a table for Raclette and when we approached one of the staff, he went to ask this arrogant employee to attend to us. He walked out with a scowl on his face glaring at us and asked rudely about what he can help us with with no ounce of politeness at all. I mentioned that I'd reserved a table and his face turned into one of suspicion as though we were trying to dupe him into giving us a table. Soon after he realise his mistake, he told someone else to bring us to our seats. When we were leaving, he gave his death glare at us again and said nothing.

Seriously, spending money on such an establishment is fine, the wines are reasonably priced and most of the staff are great. The heat is something to complain about but all of those wouldn't be as bad as that bald Indian employee."
Cheese and more,"After a long flight, we visited this restaurant for something to eat. We were impressed by the selection and by the customer care and attention. We returned several times, lunch and dinner, during our stay in Singapore."
One of the best wine places in town.,Awesome service and good value for money. Its a good place to chill with family and friends. Just shout out to Prem!!
Best place to chill with friends,Fantabulous place!!! After a Long day at work best place to dine and chill out.. best customer service and great wine in town!!!
When bad things happen to good places,"I can only echo the review of Matieu from October 2017. As a regular patron (and fan!) of Wine Connection for the past several years I have also noticed this unfortunate drop in standards, which is even more prominent with delivery orders. As well as having a minimum of 5 items (for a higher price) the portions of the cheese platter are tiny and not of good quality. Last order was so bad that by the time I had cut the stale edges from the cheeses there were mere morsels left. Sad times."
Reasonable Price for Good Wine and Nice Tapa Style Bites,"There are two of them, I prefer to sit at the counter, have a nice glass of wine and taste some of their cheese and charcuterie selection. Staff is engaging and efficient enough price is super reasonable and the sort of place you go with a long standing friend to have a nice talk and meaningful evening. The wine connection that is the bigger one is also good and suited for groups of friends and families. The menu is well done and tapa style food is certainly a nice compliment to the wine. Actually the food is so decent that you do not always need to order wine and can just have one of their creative mocktails/juices and enjoy a nice lunch. Will go back. The one in VIVO is also very nice and well run"
Good but what is happening guys ?,"We‚Äôve been there for more than 2 years now, almost every month or two.
But since few months we can clearly notice a step back on food quality ( very old raclette cheese, rotten salad) and poor service ( sometime rude waiters or waitress)
It‚Äôs sad because it use to be so perfect, friendly staff and delicious food.
Hope it‚Äôs just temporary..."
Cheese Heaven,"Outstanding! The whole ""experience"" was amazing and the food was divine. They slowly melt a huge block of cheese on your table and you incorporate this melted goodness along with your bread, meat and vegetables."
Mum's birthday,"Took my mum to the wine connection cheese bar at robertson for a raclette lunch. Ordered two sets and it was just nice for 3 people. The server (cant remember who, was a lady) however did not have good product knowledge at all. I asked for a wine recommendation to pair with the raclette and her reply was ""my preference is different from yours so i cant really recommend"". What?? At a wine bar? Strange! Perhaps some kind of training is needed.
In all, good food, mediocore service."
Becoming an old friend,"Every time in Singapore we come here at least once. Cheese plates with a plethora of choices, and interesting wines. Wines are some of the best value in Singapore. A good pour at a pretty good price. Staff are very nice, friendly and attentive. Very good prices on buying cheese to take back to hotel. Coolers full of some of my favorite stinkies."
Pathetic service,"Had been there today for dinner to celebrate advance birthday meal for my daughter. Ordered the raclette set and was served without the mixed salad although it was stated in their menu and advert board. Told the service staff and nothing was done and not even a sorry.

I was thinking maybe they run out of vege for salad and continue with our meal. After finishing the meal and I asked for the check. It took a whole 15 minutes for them to process the receipt.

While waiting for my receipt, I saw the next table ordered the raclette set and they were served with mixed vegetable salad. I started to look around and saw other tables that ordered raclette set was given a mixed salad.

I was wondering is it because I am local and the next table sits a Caucasian that is why he and his partner was served with mixed salad.

Is this the way businesses is being conducted? Feeling lousy."
"Great food, but bad service","A friend too me here and asked for a table of 3, the waitress asked us out to wait (while the restaurant was 80% empty). Then initially we got a table of 4, but along the way she kept asking us to change table if our friend is not coming. Then finally she moved us, but didn't even move our wine and left it there. Very arrogant service. But honestly speaking the food/cheese is pretty good."
A pleasant Sunday afternoon retreat,Lovely and quiet setting to relax on a Sunday afternoon enjoying good cheese and sipping a wine. Reasonably priced and good selection of cheese (50g serves). We had Beef Pastrami accompanied with four cheeses (Brillat Savarin Gorgonzola Igor Livarot and Roquefort) washed down with a bottle of Wolfberger Pinot Gris
Great place for wine & cheese,"Really enjoyed our dinner here last week. They have a decent selection of cheeses (mainly mainstream and a few less common ones) and a large range of wines in different price points. As with the other Wine Connections the wines are a lot cheaper than other Singapore restaurants but the food quality in this place is better than in the other Wine Connections. You pay a bit more but it's worth it.

The tartines are priced at $20 and are fairly large. One portion would be sufficient for two people in combination with a cheese board and a salad for example. We didn't try the raclette as we felt it was overpriced at $42 per person with minimum order of 2 people. The service we had from all staff was very good.

Including wine you'll likely pay between $40 and $80 per person. We'll definitely be back."
Wine and Cheese...perfect,Quite nice bar on Robertson Walks with a solid wine and cheese selection. Good place to start the night.
Pocket friendly place with an array of wines to die for,"If you like wines and need a place to hang out with friends, this is it! Awesome variety of wines from all over the world at prices that won't burn a hole in your pocket... ambience is good too... tapas offering can improve but I will still go back... spirits choice is limited (cause it's a wine place I Guess) and priced on the higher side"
Very bad experience,"We wanted, my friend and I, to eat a raclette at a reasonable price. Ahah, 72 dollars gone because the waiters put 2 raclettes in one without saying anything. A small glass of wine almost empty at 16 dollars. Ridiculous!!"
Awesome place with excellent service (by Mr Prem),"A big thank you to the staff of this lovely place, and especially to the lovely supervisor of the wine connection cheese bar - Mr Prem.
Despite being away for 6 months, he still remembered me and we had a good conversation.
He's knowledgable and very approachable, always smiling and ready to assist me with my needs.
If you are looking for a place to chill and enjoy some good wine, accompanied with a good cheese platter I definitely recommend this place!!!
‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Exciting dinning and amacing service,"At This place we had cheese raclette, it really was a new dinning experiance - you should try it. People's was really Nice. We had a botle of red Wine AS Well."
Denied indoor seating after 23h15 despite 2am closing time on Saturday...,"We have been regular guests to this restaurant for cheese & wine supper in the past. We tried to go again yesterday (saturday night) and were denied indoor seating at 23h15 despite a 2am closing time and at a time when the indoor seating was busy with 70-80% of the tables occupied so we were clearly not alone, and there was space to sit...

Instead we were told to sit outside - which we really do not like because of the heat and the humidity.

We tried to explain to the staff that we are fast eaters and would be out before the other guests, but were told that ""everybody had already asked for their bill and was finishing up so they were closing down that section."" (Author's note - I am just repeating what I was told)

Given that sitting outside in the heat is not pleasant and because we do not want to argue and make a scene, we took our business somewhere else. After our dinner (which was nice), we passed by the restaurant at 12h15 (when we walked back to our car) and it was still crowded indoors. Obviously, they could have easily accommodated us - I guess the people that had asked for their bills more than an hour earlier were lingering longer than expected...

Anyway, don't get me wrong, Restaurants can absolutely refuse to accept guests, I do not pretend to be a VIP, neither do I think we deserve to be rejected either because I happen to believe that we are very unremarkable guests that do not bother anyone and are respectful, pay our bills and appreciate the food.

This being said, I am writing this review for two reasons - One, because I really do not like to be treated like this and secondly because I am just not sure that the owners are aware that their staff is actively managing down their workload which is costing them revenues. As a owner of several businesses, this is a point that I feel very strongly about.

I am sorry to say that you have lost us as customers - your restaurant was quite nice, but we deserve a minimum of respect and politeness...

So in summary - two stars because the food used to be nice and I have no reason to believe that that has changed, but highly negative marks for unfriendly staff who refuse to allow you to sit inside even when we asked very politely, when there was space and when it was 2.5 hours before closing time.

As a special favour - if the management of the restaurant reads this, please do something about your business instead of writing me one of these dishonest ""thank you for your feedback"" notes. If you accept this behaviour from your staff you will very soon not have a business anymore. The choice is yours."
A must when you visit Singapore,"Delightful food, ambiance and a great wine selection at your fingertips makes this place a must visit when in Singapore. Well priced for amazing food and great wine and good service."
"Wine, Cheese and Wine","Nothing else than enjoying the Wine and Cheese Platter, while having a chat with some friends here, it just simply relaxing."
It was ok,"Food was average, air conditioning didn't cope with the the the humidity too well. Staff kept hovering. Won't return."
Nice drinking place !!,It's a nice place to hanging around with friends. The location is ideal n around wt lots of restaurants n other drinking places.
Wonderful cheeses,"You can't fault the cheese. I've been living somewhere you can't get French cheese and I forgot how good they are. 3 cheeses come with bread and fruit so you could get a decent meal for $19. Plus a big range of wines. Service tries to be snootily efficient but isn't very good - sometimes you have to shout to get their attention, which is unseemly in a place like this."
Worth a visit,"We first saw this bar on a Friday night - it was buzzing and had a great atmosphere. We called in the next day for a quick lunch. The service was very slow..... in fact we had to ask 3 times for a drink and then chase up to order the food. This aside the goats cheese salad was excellent, as was the Riesling its was paired with. We saw lots of delicious looking sharing boards going out of the kitchen along with a fondue. Overall I'd suggest going here if you're in the area, best in the evening when there's plenty of staff and a great atmosphere."
nice space with very good quality,Try wine & cheese and also tapas bar Best sausages and beers I tried it in Singapore unity street. don't forget to reserve for best sit. happy hour for only 18$ a main course and a salad or soup
Great cheese place,"We always come to this place very often, always enjoy the service, on this day, a Saturaday evening, we didnt make reservation and wanted wine and cheese impromptu. Understand that its crowded, we saw an empty space with laptop and papers on the bar counter near facing the cashier, able to accomodate for 2, though it was just nice for us and as the lady at the counter that we are ok to seat, drink and wait for the person beside to finish at the bar counter. Immediately the reply from her was... NO! No more seats available. Shocked by her reply I pointed the area with laptop and papers on the counter, she said no. Lucky another staff, in black shirt and pant (regarding not knowing his name) I told him we are ok to wait and order our drinks first while waiting for the person at the bar counter to finish she had finish, billed jus sitting there looking at her phone. This wonderful staff deserved to be recommended, he replied, no problems jus let me clear away the laptop and papers. this place still never disappoints me, the service is still excellent, thank you for getting us a seat with quick response."
Raclette cheese!,I love all cheeses and raclette cheese is one of my favourites. This restaurant does a mean raclette set that comes with bread cornichons and everything. It was quite good value and especially since we were given a table right in the cheese room itself. Fabulous fabulous choice!
An alternative to the nearby Wine Connection Tapas Bar,"Would usually move to the Cheese bar if the Tapas bar nearby is full. As with the Tapas bar, the wines here are relatively cheap. Good selection of cheese. Recommend the raclette cheese."
"A great place to relax, with some good cheese and wine.","I have been here a couple of times now in the past few weeks and I must say I totally enjoy the place. There are many different ways to select your cheese, but my favourite is to get a couple of cheese and meat selections. The cheese goes from the normal cheddar type, through the soft cheese up to a good selection of blue. Mind be careful as some are certainly smelly. Add to this the selection of wine from the shop / bar next door and your in for a great hour or more. Just one word of advice, it gets busy so get there early"
Great value wine and nice cheese,"I visited twice in one day, for lunch and dinner. The wines were the cheapest that I'd seen at any restaurant in Singapore with good New Zealand Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc ranging from $35- $40. This was less than half the price charged by other mid range restaurants.

The lunch range is good and reasonable with an average price of $19 and a daily special of $19 for a set lunch.

For dinner I tasted the excellent cheeses and this is something I would recommend if cheese is your thing.

The only slight negative is the average service which was the same for both of my visits. The staff are not welcoming, engaging or attentive enough to the customers. This dilutes the experience and is something which prevented a 5 star award from me."
Great little wine and cheese bar,"This little wine bar has a huge collection of wines at exceptionally good prices. Many bottles starting around the S$30 mark (about ¬£17) and terrific cheese list. We went for a bottle of Valpolicella Ripasso, excellent value at S$41.

House specialty is raclette - a type of melted cheese fondue. This was widely ordered and seemed to be going down well.

Joe and Fizz went for the cheese board, selecting 5 cheeses from an impressive list of European cheeses. All 5 of our selection were delicious. Nicely soft Brie de Meaux particularly worthy of praise.

Friendly and helpful service from Yumi.

We're going back tonight"
Good visit,Popped in one afternoon for a quick glass as only round the corner from our hotel the have a good choice of wine with various prices also a great selection of cheese from all parts of the world a great visit
"Great wine, bad service","Ordered a bottle of wine for myself. The wine itself was great. However, the service wasn't as good. But am I supposed to pour the wine to my own glass when the glass is empty? I don't think so. My glass was empty for quite a while, and there were staffs standing in front of me, or were walking pass me, but they didn't seem to care. It was around 15 minutes later when a staff coming from the other side of the outlet came to pour for me, instead of the staff standing in front of me. And another thing, although I didn't order any food, I didn't think that the staff there bother about hygiene. It is food and beverage, but the ladies staff there aren't tying their hair. What if their hair fliea to the food. Where is the hygiene level there."
Now a Sunday night ritual,An excellent place for a wind down weekend meal and very reasonably priced wine of great quality. The ambience is good. I perfer outside but you can enjoy aircon as well.
"Outstanding cheese, great wine great balue","We were very impressed with the cheese plate we ordered, very good quality from various regions. Red wine was delicious and served at the correct temperature, despite the searing heat.

Staff were friendly, some a little strange though.

Definitely recommend this place."
Wine and cheese; what more to say,"Sitting outside here is a bit strange; at the roadside on the side walk. However, this is more than made up for by the excellent, and well priced, wine selection, but especially by the cheeses and tapas. The bread is perfect, the cheese soft, stinky and running; heaven!"
Great value wines and cheeses,We love going there each time we visit Singapore. Usually choose a bottle from the boutique and then ordered a few cheeses to eat it with. Reasonable prices.
Cheese heaven,"We were craving a bit of cheese on our trip and this restaurant did not disappoint - the waiter was super helpful and recommended us a great soft cheese, delicious!"
