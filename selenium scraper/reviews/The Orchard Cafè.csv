Helpful and efficient staff,Everything was great! Food spread was great and tasty. Staff were constantly checking on us and helping us to clear plates/refill water. Special mention to Yuva. He was very friendly and helpful with my family and ensuring that we would have an enjoyable time. Will return again for sure :)
Prosperity buffet,"The variety of food offered was very extensive and the quality and taste was pretty good as well! Foo was constantly replenished, especially the BBQ station. Deserts were unique as well, such as burbur cha cha, chocolate pudding and osmanthus jelly.
We were also offered a sample of what seemed to be a dish not included in the buffet, fried fish and mint(?) sauce which was much appreciated!
Staff was also quite attentive in terms of clearing the plates and offering to help take dishes like the hot fish maw soup.
Overall a pleasant experience and would recommend!"

Orchard Cafe - slide in standards,"Had buffet lunch. Spread looks about alright, but pale in comparison. Stranger were ‘station chefs’ who are not taught to man serving stations!
On display in Chinese kitchen were 1 duck n 1 slab of roast pork. The mid aged staff mumbled no,no when asked for a cut of the roast duck - pointed to the plate of shredded meat meant to eat with popiah roll.
The surprise was elevated at the salad stand (just a bowl of lettuce n a bottle of premixed oil n vinaigrette). In melodious China Chinese, this lady “station chef” asked that I do not use the wooden salad bowl to toss the greens. When told this is a salad bowl, she retorted no, you mix in your plate.. ???
CDL - owners gotta take note."
Monday lunch by buffet,"Monday lunch. Small spread but food was well executed. I especially like their little morsels of dessert, ice cream... Will be back for more. Service staff were attentive.."

Collected cake and turkey from hotel restaurant.,"You dont hear much about orchard hotel but the service is really good. Staff greeted me promptly, knew who I and got my stuff really well packed, I think her name is Catherine. Very nice and professional lady, got me to take a seat before checking and siging forms.

Helpful and cheerful chef Balan,"I am really appreciative for being serve with a helpful and cheerful chef Balan from Orchard Hotel from 20 Dec to 21 Dec 2022.

Chef Balan went the extra mile to assist me whenever I am at level 1 Orchard cafe as I am a vegetarian and some cuisine might not be suitable. There is some vegetable cuisine which might not be suitable for vegetarian. He showed me to the cuisine suitable for vegetarian. He even assisted me for meal like fried rice, as the routine vegetarian available is of Indian cuisine. I can feel his sincerity and pride of being a chef to assist a normal customer like myself.

I hope that your hotel can have more staff like chef Balan to make our stay here more enjoyable."

Need Improvement,SeaFood not fresh.. Food is Too salty... Service is moderate. Need Improvement overall .. quite disappointed.
Very Disappointed for the services we received.,"Went there for a buffet dinner. Trying to had a happy birthday buffet dinner but… disappointing. I had been to so many hotel restaurants.

MBS, Conrad, Westin, Shangri-La Orchard, Four point by Sheraton, Hotel Miramar, Grand Copthorne waterfront, Swissotel and many more. This is the first time in my life I met a table that empty plates was not cleared and didn’t even bothered to ask if we need a jug of ice water to start with when we enter the restaurant or if we want to order any drinks.

“M social” restaurant services are way better than here.

Since the table was small as I brought some food back to the table and guess what empty plates still there. I had to cleared my own empty plates by handing them it to the waiters??? Lol oh wow?! Didn’t even realise me holding dirty plates standing infront of them hmmm… Poor host was so busy had to shout at the waiters to get the empty plates from my hand.

(From the image you can see dirty plate stacked and as for the second time it wasn’t even cleared) that I had to stand up and cleared my own table. Attention wasn’t even given.

1 host, 2 upper head, 4 staffs this is not under staffs, and is not as if the area was as big as the Royal Caribbean cruise. Each waiter could have just handle each table areas.

So disappointed.

5 stars rate to all the Chefs who’s paying attention to all the guests. I was just walking pass the Chefs was really sweet to ask if I want to have it. At least the Chefs make my day feel good."
Compliment for Mr.Thiva,Everything about this restaurant was great. The place was clean and smelled good. The staff greet was very welcoming. The staff name Mr.Thiva was awesome. Very patient and kind to us. He recommend us some delicious food. Even I notice about him that's he personally go all the table and asking about the service and food. Really appreciate it. The staff also worked as a team in bringing and cleaning up our food. The food was fresh and awesome. Then we also had dessert and that was really good as well. Great atmosphere with really nice people. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

A return to my Fav,"After 50 years of travels that always bring me back to Singapore, I always stay at the Orchard Hotel. The Restaurant does a superb job with ‘comfort food’ from probably 15 ethnic origins. And I love the family atmosphere of the buzz in the air. Remember “Cheers” where ‘everybody knows your name’? It’s like that … and I live 12 time zones away. Thank you Chef Pang for the Penang Quayteow."
Good food. Good service,"This is my 2nd visit in the month. Impressed with the service and the spread is very good

In particular I would like to commend Chef Shafiqual and Chef Ah Chun. They were attentive to the needs of all customers.

In particular i would like to make special mention of Chef Shafiqual and Chef Ah Chun. Both paid special attention to make sure my aged mum who is 80+, could enjoy her food.

Thank you Chefs.

We will be back"
