Great food,"Dined together with my friends.
As were unsure of the portions we ordered few dishes at first. Once the food arrived we realized that the portions were actually generous and good for sharing.

From all the dishes that we ordered we all agreed that the pork ribs were great and even ordered another portion
7 cheese pizza were nice as well.
Highly recommend to try these 2 dishes.
The Sangria was good as well."
BEST PLACE TO HANGOUT WITH FRIENDS,I love the pork ribs and 7 cheese pizzaüòç indeed a good place to hangout.The staff are friendly and accommodating. Will comeback again to bring my fam!
SHARING IS CARING,"The food and the ambiance are all great plus the service staffs. Hats off!
The price was worth it and the food was all good for sharing, large portions.
My favorite was the pork ribs..
Super satisfied with everything.
Will definitely come back again with other friends"
Great place to chill with friends,"The food was very good, especially the 7 cheese pizza and the pork ribs. We had the happy hour 1 for 1 Sangria. The service staff were nice and helpful in redeeming my tripleplus voucher. Would come back again"
Customer Service,All the waitresses offered excellent service during our dinner. They were friendly and professional.
Great service great food,"Wonderful service. Good food. Great tasting and the staffs were all very attentive. Quick responses even though full house. Coffee is damn good even my younger kids love it! Except as it was a PH, the tripleone 1:1 cannot he used even though you are a member. We were told to sign up and after I did, the other staff shared to say not useable because it‚Äôs a PH. Should have told me in advance so I don‚Äôt need to pay for the tier 3 membership."
Tender pork ribs and delicious garlic prawns,"For this meal, I am delighted with both mains We ordered. Love the flavourful and tender ribs and prawns with melted cheese on top."
"Coffee by day, bar by dusk","This coffee and bar has three missions - great coffee, great food and community. House poured wines, beers and cocktails are available at dusk with savory Cafe classics."
Nice to chill on a Friday evening,Loved the concept of a cafe + bar! Sat outside on a Friday evening people watching and enjoying iced cappuccinos and truffle fries after dinner. Service was attentive and friendly!
Gorgeous gorgeous ribs,"Went there for brunch, the portions were big & the food was good. Quick service too. I had the ribs which were absolutely fab!"
Good service nice food but Airc√∂n leaks,"Went for tea at 3pm, service staff very friendly and helpful. Only complaint is water dripping from aircon duct and we had to shift table. Also chicken wings very salty"
Nice place to chill out,My to-go place for Kronenbourg 1664 Great service crew. Ask Jey for recommendations and he will help you with food and beverage pairing. A nice chap for a chat.
Awesome Service by Spectacular Team!,Every year both my wife and me celebrate our birthdays here and the Oriole Team never cease to dazzle us with their impeccable service. Special mention goes to Jey for his superb service with a smile. Kudos to Jey and Team! Keep up the good service. Thank you.
Great food & nice place to chill,It was a great night out with my friends & the food was great! If only the happy hour can be extended longer for weekdays.
"Food alright, place awesome, people okay","Staffs were alright at the start & during our meal, only towards the end, a young lady was really nice & friendly as she opened the door for us and said thanks & good bye!

We ordered truffle soup with sour dough toasts, Mac & cheese and a pizza with an egg in the middle (forgot the name). Truffle soup was awesome, pizza was good, Mac & cheese was disappointing. Ain't as cheesy as we thought.

But I strongly recommend to come here if you're looking for a place to chill over a cup of coffee."
Good food and nice vibes,"Food was great, every dish was delicious. Seems to be short-handed though, as it was still fairly occupied on a weekday night. Appreciate that service crew was trying hard to meet all customers' demand."
MISSIE is the reason the reason i came back to this place,"since ownership changed a few years ago it has been in decline this place but some of the staff make it worth returning as it's such a great location for evening drinks and bites.

Missie (Missi).. is so great ,she was so helpful and attentive and just made us feel like we were the only table there and nothing was too much trouble.,"
Lovely spaghetti and tiger prawns,They changed the penne to spaghetti and made the dish so lovely. Tiger prawns with bacon and sweet potato fries make our day
Interesting but...,Food was good really. There was a 1 for 1 offer but nobody told us that you can only claim for 1 order - perhaps this could have been clearly stated in the menu? May go back again as the food is good. Servers were great.
Excellent Service by Syed and Jeyüëçüèª,"Great service, attentiveness, and cheerfulness by Syed and Jey, whole team assisted us very well, and felt at home on every visit üíï Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Excellent Service,Syed was helpful throughout our dining experience. Jey was kind enough to offer us water too. Enjoyed the food and ambience.
Wonderful service for big group,Reservation was made promptly and our special request was also readily accommodated. Service was excellent when we dined. Orders and payments could be made individually and this was excellent especially in a large group. Thank you!
Father's Day dinner!,"First time at this place. Great food, good quality latte and the best part - not too noisy/crowded when seated indoors."
Review,"Food and atmosphere was good, but on the pricier side. Would be good if the reservations can be extended beyond 90 min. The app was not user friendly as there was a need to keep keying the credit card details for additional orders. Perhaps the codes should be unique to each table so that the process of adding orders can be made more user friendly and also easier for staff to track. Thks"
Impeccable Service.,The staff here simply awesome as they provide first class service. A special mention goes to Jey and Jeff who took good care of us. These guys are an asset to the establishment. Thank you.
Excellent service,"Staff‚Äôs service was excellent ! We had good time for casual dinner in town. Food was delicious, location is good just linked to train station. Suggest u to make reservation cz we couldn‚Äôt get in few times:)"
Nice ambience,"If you like to some people watching, ask to sit outside along the mall atrium but note no aircon. Otherwise, you can eat in more serene environment inside with aircon. Service was not too bad and food is okay."
"Very tasty food and okay coffee, but service super disappointing & terrible atmosphere!","Went there for lunch on a Sunday with a friend and overall the experience was poor.

On the positive side was the great quality, taste, freshness and overall presentation of the food served to us. We had the fish & chips as well as the ""Juicy Lucy"" plant based burger - both served with fries. The dishes were very well cooked and tasted great. Also, the coffee served was of good quality - though not really outstanding when compared to other specialty coffee houses. We had several coffee drinks - including a Latte, an Americana, a Piccolo and an Espresso - all nice, but nothing special.

On the very negative side was the non-existing service and an overall dining experience that did not match our expectations at all. Our visit started off with having to wait outside the restaurant to be seated while for several minutes no one showed up to do so. When a staff finally came by, he was actually late to work and passed us uttering a ""half serious"" apology in the form of an ""I'm so sorry..."" thrown over the shoulder in passing. Not a great first impression! After another minute or two the staff came back to finally seat us, and we realized quickly that Oriole doesn't value smaller dining parties: all tables for 2-3 guests are placed in ""forgotten corners"" or busy corridors. This place clearly focuses only on large groups to frequent their restaurant.

Given this bad first impression, we chose to order via the QR codes, and received our food within 15-20 minutes after confirming our order and paying. Unfortunately, our drinks were nowhere to be seen - and we had to stop a service staff rushing by our table. We asked to check our drinks order and were immediately ""told off"" with a ""You have to pay for water, sir"". To which we replied that we actually already had paid and ordered water and coffee - and quite a while back. Only then, did the staff check - and it was clear that our drinks simply had been forgotten to be prepared. We received them with another rather listless ""I am so sorry"" comment thrown at us.

Meanwhile, we could clearly see that all larger dining parties who had been seated well after us had received their drink orders extremely quickly. For our final Espresso order the staff forgot to bring spoons & sugar. We again had to ask for these basics and again greeted with a monotone ""I am so sorry"" when served. For more than SGD 80 for 2 diners the ""service"" was unacceptable, and the great food did not make up for feeling unwelcome. Best to avoid!"
"Don't order from here, they'll waste an hour of your life and then cancel","Order delivery from this restaurant, which they accepted. After waiting for an hour, they cancelled the order 10 minutes before it should have arrived, leaving me without alternatives due to the late hour."
Great Atmosphere and excellent service staff.,"Staff are fun, friendly and chatty üòä. I will definitely come back again with family and friends. Was not noisy which was important for me for my business lunch"
Review of the food,"I ordered the sweet soy pork ribs but the meat was dry. There also wasn‚Äôt enough sauce on it. I also ordered the spicy crabmeat capellini and it lacked flavour and was oily. Overall, the food was a disappointment."
"Good food, good price for voucher used","We had sweet soy pork ribs and chilli crab linguini. Personally like the pork ribs as its easily separated from the bones and well marinated. The linguini could be less flavourful as it feels heavy after a while, nevertheless the taste is good too üëçüèª"
Friendly Server,"Took advantage of the 1for1 promo on Chope to try out this place. Glad we did, 10/10 for the service & food. I have to compliment the only 2 server - Syed & Jeffrey, for their attentive and patience, makes my dinning experience a happy one. Definitely will come back"
Awesome üëè F&B services,"Awesome F&B services Lovely services from Jey, Emma, Ivan and team‚Ä¶. Their services are awesome and fabulous‚Ä¶ professional advices and recommendations from them‚Ä¶ please head to the restaurant for chilli crab pizza and fried chicken waffle‚Ä¶. Absolutely perfect üòçüòçüòç"
Must visit!,"Highly recommended! Amazing food especially the tacos ! And truffle fries! Good hangout spot for a Friday night! Shout-out to Jay, extremely friendly!"
Never again,"Who in their right mind charges for singapore water? No notice. Just appears on the bill. (Illegal in most western countries) been here several times in 15 years today was the last. Mediocre food, consistently bad service , but decent people watching place. Sad. Never again"
Food quality,Relaxing atmosphere & food was great. Staff was helpful. Impeccable service. Would love to visit again
With Entertainer discount,Great service but very limited selection for the Entertainer 1for1 mains. Couldn't choose burgers as burger buns have not been delivered by supplier. Very good coffee. Would return to try the other dishes.
Food and Service,"The food was indeed tasty and yummy . On top of that, we had 15% discount using master card. Will arrange a return trip the next time."
Awful service Again,"Oriole seems to have recurring issue. No one greets you at the entrance , does not matter if the restaurant is busy or not. We always had to wait for quite some time before someone approached us. This last time it was so hot and we just wanted to seat first. When no one approached us after some time (like always) we initiatively walked in. And then the waiter appeared out of nowhere being aggressive towards us ( for walking in). He raised his voice and i just had to reply the same. Then he aggressively said its holiday have patience. Well honestly, we always had patience every time we ate there. Services were always so so. But food was good. We enjoyed the food and the place. Very unfortunate. Definitely management issue. You keep having the same problems and nothing changes. If you know its holiday then employ some more. You really want your guests burning outside under the Singapore‚Äôs heat and just don‚Äôt have the simple courtesy to at least let them walk in and have a seat first whilst you served other guests. How hard is that? It is basic manners. You can serve them a bit later and apologise for the slow service and guests will try to understand. The manager approached us and he just said they are trying to hire some more staff. But really? It has been many months with the same problem?. Will be our last time as Providore is a better option over the road and the staffs value guests better. Not just for the sake of keeping the cash coming in."
Gotten food poisoning and service wasn‚Äôt prompt,It appeared that they were short handed hence service was not prompt. Ordered Bacon Truffle Mac & Cheese paired with Piccolo latte. Gotten food poisoning from the food. The food was rather greasy as I thought the need more oil to be in the food to avoid it from sticking onto the serving pan. Couldn‚Äôt finish my food toward the end and felt stomach was churning even before leaving the restaurant!
Impeccable Service,Both my wife and me had dinner here last Saturday and we were overwhelmed by standard of professionalism displayed by the staff. Well done.
Tasty Food & Fantastic Service,"Staff were very friendly & accommodating. Also very patience & helpful. The food & drinks are tasty as always! We had their Spaghetti Aglio Olio & Spicy Crabmeat Capellini, generous portions. I also had the Long Black, very good! Our favourite restaurant of all times"
Lunch,"The food was great. It want to comment on the excellent service provided, it made alot of difference. The staff explained and recommended and provided her opinions. Keep up the good work and we really appreciate the effort."
Impossible Burger is really good!,"The impossible burger was really delicious! If you‚Äôre a beef lover, you should really try it! They offer happy hours too! Value for money :)"
Oriole Experience,"Dined in once before CB and had such a good experience. Food was great, cafe was clean and well furnished. Kubos to their manager Jey who served on both occasions. Very well mannered and attentive, ensured diners abide by the safe distancing. Highly recommended, esp when there‚Äôs entertainer 1 for 1!"
Delicious,Beautiful experience at Oriole. The wait-staff (particularly Wati) are impeccably attentive and make sure your every need or want is met. The food is delicious- particularly the fish & chips.
"Didn't disappoint, coffee was excellent as usual","This place is famous for coffee and fish & chips. Saw something new on the menu, lobster roll. Had to try! Portion was good size and we were ambitious and over ordered. Ended up had to pack the chicken wings home. The lobster was pretty succulent, definitely enjoyable. I will always come back for coffee, tried the Death Cream this time. Didn't disappoint at all. Definitely enjoyed the meal."
Nice place to chill out.,Food was nice . A pity the lobster roll was sold out . Service was good. Waiting time was not long . Ribs was awesome . Burger was nice . Sweet potato‚Äôs fries a great finger snack !
Very terrible experience,"I brought my boyfriend for lunch on his birthday to the Oriole Coffee and bar. Prior to visiting this restaurant, I made a reservation with a special request to order their banana cake in advance so that it can be brought out after our meal as a surprise, but that did not happen. I had tried calling a few times earlier that day to confirm and inform them about my request, however, no one had answered the phone. Assuming that it must be crowded and they were probably short-staffed, I arrived at the restaurant to find at least 6-7 staff available in a not so full restaurant with no one to attend to the phone. After being seated, we ordered and were looking forward to try the impossible burger. After portioning the burger into two on serving plates, I noticed a small strand of hair on the plate which was initially under the burger. Upon informing the staff, she took the plate back and offered to give us a free dessert. As the portioned burger (on serving plates) was still on our table, we told her we were not going to eat that burger and requested for a new one. It was then when she told us that the free dessert would then be cancelled since we are getting the burger replaced. I was appalled by this and the manner in which they conduct a service recovery. Especially since it involves the unhygienic preparation of food (finding hair in food is just unacceptable). Furthermore, the service from most of the staff there was utterly disappointing. I must say the staff there have mastered the art of looking at people and pretending that they did not see them getting their attention. And out of all days this could happen, it happened on a loved one's birthday. Overall we had a horrible experience and will not be coming back again to have mediocre food at a higher than average price."
cool place to go for a beer (but not when it rains!),"cool place to go for a beer unless it rains when it drenches the outside table even though they're covered!

only a couple of draught beers and outside of happy hour they are $17, need more variety

staff were polite and quick at serving

nice strategic place for a beer in orchard/313"
Nice chill spot in town!,"I always enjoy my experience here. It's conveniently located nearby my workplace, offering a perfect ""chill spot"" with family or friends. This food is a tad expensive but otherwise decent. We can never go wrong with pasta! And the white wine is always great. Thank you!"
Never again,"I had a horrible experience. Oriole did not have a decent alcohol option. Also, the premises looks a little old and not maintained - I was seated outside."
Pigeon PooP!,"Came for lunch 2nd time in a month while the food is still good, this time round am utterly disappointed with the ambience and service.
Unfortunately pigeons flocked around, feasting over leftovers, resting on the overhead speakers and window ledges.

Pigeons flocked over heads. And
Eventually the moment we hope don‚Äôt happen came, the pigeon poop came close and landed on my shirt and jeans. (it could be easily landed into the food/drinks!)

All the waiter did was to give an extra serviette, not much empathy shown, the manager did not even bother to say anything.

After we voiced our disappointment, the waiter finally asked if we want another table that has less pigeons, ???!! (We attempted asking earlier but was not possible. )
A nominal 10% discount was given that‚Äôs the cost of a coffee here and as if to say you don‚Äôt need to pay service charge as it‚Äôs not been up to good standard.

Does the management not know Pigeons can be quite unhygienic to be flocking around especially in the food and beverages industry?

Well after this saga, I contributed to the fashion industry for a new clean shirt, before I continue rest of my day in town.

Depending on what LUCK u want, here is one place you can try to get that!

On hindsight , We should have tried to cancel our orders and left seeing these pigeons at act. hope this matter and the customer service are looked into seriously by the management."
"Pretty good, but may be a little pricey","A little on the pricey side but overall food was ok. Dessert was good, and my fav was the frangipani tart

The soy ribs were good, but I felt that the crab meat capellini was so so. But overall, the experience was still a good one. Would consider coming back again:)"
"Great service, good food","Food portions were generous, Chilli crab linguine and snapper tacos were nice, barramundi was okay. The service of the staff was excellent, very friendly and were happy to help, thank you!"
Really enjoyed my time there,"had lunch with a friend there. excellent service, i've especially appreciated the staff offering to switch us to a better table - it was a pleasant surprise. the food itself was really good too. like the chilli crab pasta and salmon pizza. will be coming back in the future!"
Service needs improvement.,"The location of the cafe is convenient as it‚Äôs close to Somerset MRT station and located beside 313 Mall. Food selection is good. The coffee was great.

Service needs to be improved. We arrived early when there weren‚Äôt a lot of customers yet but we waited endlessly for someone to get our orders. We were waving to the wait staff but they were either looking down on the tablets they were holding or rushing in and out of the door. I had to approach the counter to ask if we were supposed to place our orders there but was asked to sit down and someone will attend to us. It happened again when we requested for water as we kept waving and raising our hands to be acknowledged but it took forever."
the Assistant Manager,"Aravin saved the game! my initial impression of this cafe wasn‚Äôt good but the assistant manager, Aravin is very professional and provide excellent customer services. He‚Äôs a great asset to the cafe!"
Great Food and Coffee,Staff is very accommodating. Food is great.. good for sharing with friends and family. Will be back again üòÅ
A must place to visit,Highly recommended! The food are superb!!! nice choices and the perfect/friendly service. I will definitely back!!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ special shout out to MILA (server) for a friendly service.
"Food was nice, service sub par",Great place to eat with unique coffee to try out however service crew were serious tunnel vision. Felt like they would purposely hurry off ‚Äòto service‚Äô on nothing just so they can ignore you.
Excellent service and quality food,"We had an enjoyable dinner at Oriole. The service staff were attentive and when my friend was looking for her napkin, one of them came up to ask if everything was ok and what they could help with. We were very impressed with the level of service here, very professional. Will definitely dine here again."
Reasonable brunch in a central location,"It was okay for the prices. I only had the pancake so can't really comment on any of the other food. It was just one pancake, but thick, more like a cross between a cake and a pancake.

Coffee was quite good.

Ambience was quite nice - rustic, lots of wood and glass, and lots of space so it was very relaxing for a tete-a-tete.

Service staff were very nice but I had to ask twice for everything before I finally got them - water, butter, check."
Worst service,We had reservations but had to join the main queue .meaning those without reservations got tables before us. What's the point of making a reservation. Also the short Malay waitress- called her 3 times for the bill and she ignored us. In the end a nice Indian waiter heard and came over. Nice food but will never go there again due to the bad service. They must be so popular. Time for us to support other businesses who really need customers.
Sunday brunch,"Tried to make online booking for Sunday brunch but no slots avail so we decide to just walk in. We were there around 11am, the inside seatings were full but we had the outside tall table seatings which were still shaded so it‚Äôs not that hot. Nice to have brunch as we watch people, pity that Orchard is not as crowded as before without the tourists. Food and service were ok."
Food ok. Staff attitude is poor.,"Food is not bad. However, the attitude of a few staff need to be improved as they sound a little rude. When the tax amount is not correct and asked to clarify, without explaining much, staff only keeps saying this is correct and mentioned other customers also asked and we are correct"
Good place with good ambience,Went there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Food came quick after placing our order. Proper measures in place to separate the different groups of people.
Chill Place,"For me, it's one of the best places to hangout in Singapore. The vibe is relaxing and cozy. Good lighting, nice interiors and of course good food!

We tried pork ribs bbq, carbonara and mac & cheese. The food is really delicious and for the drinks, you can also try their tea if you're not into alcoholic drinks.

Another thing that I can commend is their service, really have a good service team. We were assisted by David from reservation and also when we dined-in. Will definitely visit this place again, if you need some time to relax and chill with your friends."
Ambience + Great Food,"This was my second visit in this restaurant. First was sometime in September with my husband.

Suprisingly, outdoor seating at high tables gave us an overall great ambience, even though it might not look like it from the outside as it's relatively along the high foot traffic area.

We were served by David, who also accommodated our last minute reservation at around 12noon. I just sent a message thru Facebook then he called me to confirm after few minutes. During the dinner, David provided us with an exceptional service from order taking to checking out. We're really glad he served us.

We ordered Prawn aglio olio, back ribs, carbonara, truffle mac and cheese, and truffle fries. All tasty with decent portions. We also ordered tea by pots at around 10pm, and they happily accommodated our orders even though it's supposedly served until 8pm. That's a plus for customer experience."
"first visit in a few years, food quality has improved","used to come very often in the past, but then the chef and menu changed so i stopped for a while. but was pleasantly surprised this time as food quality is really good now (since my last visit). great vibes to the bistro too"
Dine,love love love their homemade banana cake! Recommended by crew Jey and it never fails us! Service was tip top and need not say their foooooood! Delicious and highly recommend! üëçüèª
Good Location but inconsistent service,The location is very convenient as its next to an MRT in Orchard. Hence there is no lack of foot traffic and business is good. However the quality of service is very inconsistent as they are lack of staff/ manpower resources. Waving endlessly till i had to walk up to the wait staff to get their attention. However one of the servers (Lady) was extremely friendly and helpful. whereas some of the others does not have service mindset.
Birthday celebration,Today we visited oriole for my mum birthday. A dinner with lots of great foods and wonderful coffee. Good job to oriole team. Everything is excellent. We enjoyed our celebration here.
Orielo l,"We visit oriole regularly for their excellent cold brews, capellini pasta and relaxed ambience. They have good service too. Logen was our server for quite a few of our visits and he never fails to impress us with his attentive and cheerful service."
Friday at Oriole,Great food! Great service! Special thanks to Logen! Will definitely be back here. Keep it up! See you again Oriole!
"Lovely place, very nice staff","Logen was amazing, food was great. Nice atmosphere, good music. Definitely will come back and advise everyone to check this place"
"Logen, Logen, Logen, Logen!!! Power!",Thank you Mr. Logen we had a fantastic Brunch. Beautiful avocado sourdough and Caesar salad ü•ó (tbl 17) Will be back soon. Cheers!
Casual Brunch,"I reserved a table here for Saturday 1 pm, online (Chope) and usually, they would hold the table for 15mins but we were running late and I called them several times to let them know but no one answered the phone. Finally, when we arrived they told us we were too late, we let them know that we tried to call them and then they had only 1 available table at their outdoor seating area and gave that to us (it was very hot outside) but we took it anyway. They charge 50cents for water. The food is average, we ordered the Haute chocolate, coffee taster trio, waffles & chicken (came with coleslaw & maple syrup), chilli crab dip & waffle fries (this is a must-try, it was really good), seafood capellini & bacon truffle mac & cheese.
The waffle chicken was very crispy but lacked flavour and the portion was a bit big (for me). The coffee taster trio was ok. Overall I would not come back here, I have nothing to recommend and nothing to remember about this place (except the 50 cents we paid for water)LOL!"
Avoid this place!,"The service was extremely bad, they didn‚Äôt bring all our dishes at the same time, so every person at our table ate cold.
My friend ordered hazelnut coffee and it had no taste AT ALL as an extra flavor. And when we asked about the coffee flavor they ignored us and were very sure it has hazelnut..

Our husbands ordered the Negroni with shot of coffee and no one tasted the coffee at all...

the waitress said that the coffee isn‚Äôt a shot but an infusion (different of what the menus said)

I ordered macaroni and cheese with truffle and no truffle flavor at all...

After taking over 25 minutes to bring the 4th dish, they forgot to bring the cutlery despite we asked them 2 times for..

The service was extra slow and the food sucks...

Don‚Äôt waste your time here if you enjoy good food and good service..."
"Cozy restaurant, value for money",Pretty good quality food. House blend coffee was superb. Could appreciate bigger portions or lower prices.
"Lovely service, great food","We had a lovely brunch with our baby in a high chair. Staff were so nice and friendly, especially Marje, we had a lovely time! Food & coffee was delicious, the Caesar Salad was fantastic!"
Average,"The coffee and pancakes were good. We ordered scrambled eggs (2 eggs). The portion definitely did not look like a 2 egg portion. Was really small and it didn‚Äôt taste like scrambled eggs. Just regular fried egg that was mixed a bit. No dairy added or seasoning. We ordered the avocado toast as well. My mum doesn‚Äôt eat eggs so we asked if they could replace it with either tomato, mushroom or potatoes (which were veg options from another brunch option). The staff said those options were more expensive than eggs so it could not be done. So they could only add more salad leaves. Okay that‚Äôs fine as well. But again there was not much added. The truffles fries were not bad. But the truffle taste wasn‚Äôt as pronounced. I guess I would come again just for the coffee."
Birthday Celebration with Friends,"A far cry from my 2nd visit for a weekend brunch in late 2019, whereby the food served was cold and greasy, and waiters were not attentive and were busy talking amongst themselves despite the lull brunch time. We were very certain twe didn't want to come again.

However, we decided to give it another try and came back last night for a birthday celebration, and was impressed once again.

The food was served promptly upon ordering, and delicious!! We ordered a few recommended dishes and our favourite has to be the pork ribs, crabmeat pasta and mac and cheese!"
Best I've ever had.,"Was highly recommended by my closegf for the best coffee in SG. Upon my arrival at the counter, a staff name, Marje attended to me patiently.
I am 100% clueless what to get.
So I got all three types. The taisho, in house and nitro.
My GF loves the Death cream in house so much. I feel so welcome every visit even though I take away.
Look for Marje some times she isn't there and Mila helped me too with my order. We need more staffs like them. Amazing and blessed."
Tasty brunch and ambience,Dined with my family for brunch. Enjoyed the friendly service. The usual brunch food items but done extremely well. Pancakes were excellent!
Casual lunch,"We had the impossible burger, Cobb salad and Salmon rosti. The food was yummy, service by Logen was attentive and prompt. Great spot for people watching. Loved the coffee too."
Dinner,"Went there on a Sunday night for dinner. Used the 1-for-1 mains for the entertainer app. Ordered the Oriole Truffle Burger and the Caprllini Crabmeat Pasta. Would recommend both dishes as they are good. The pasta portion is reasonably good and it tastes better than the burger. Ambience is nice, very chill. Overall would be an average for me but I‚Äôll definitely visit this place again as the 1-for-1 mains voucher goes on :)"
Good,food was really good! especially the truffle burger. food was served very fast and the ambience was good despite it beinf a little small
Fake advertising,"We went there for lunch with entertainer application. I ordered the ribs and despite the picture on the app of the dish with the ribs, they refused to give us the appropriate discount. Waiters were not really kind."
Waited ages for someone to,"Waited ages for someone to acknowledge us waiting. Waited ages for someone to take our order. Ordered 2 glasses of wine, a juice and some chilli calamari. Drinks arrived no glass ever turned up for the juice, calamari was inedible as it was overcooked and chewy. Ordered 2 more glasses of wine but they never turned up so got the bill and left. Staff seem uninterested and sad. Maybe it was us? Maybe it‚Äôs their employer? Best bet is to find somewhere that cares and spend your dollars there."
"Food was FANTASTIC, service was not the best","Will definitely come back for the chicken waffles and truffle burger, blew my mind away The service was poor with the exception of 2 staff, he was probably having a bad day"
"Great food, place and Logen was helpful!","Great food, place, and Logen was helpful! My friend and I enjoyed the chicken and waffles, and the coffee as well."
Nice ambience,Try the crab cappellini. Good portion and tasty. Recommended! Nice ambience and music. I am trying so hard to squeeze the 100mim words.
Good lunch spot,"Had a great Ceasar salad with happy hour two for one wine. Good size portions. Service started great but then slowed down. Friend had fish n chips which was really good and another had the baked fish which was good, but came after the rest of us were finished. So, food and ambiance were good - needs a little work on service (but that‚Äôs Singapore eh?!)"
A great meal,Logan was great in helping us ! He was efficient and friendly . Good food and service . I recommend this place .
"Second time here for breakfast, perfect!","I like to come here for breakfast before Orchard gets overly crowded. Sitting at the Al fresco area, it‚Äôs perfect to enjoy a beautiful morning. The handcrafted coffee is recommend. Breakfast here is delicious, good portion and affordable. Services here are great too, Logen always serve with a smile."
Great food and excellent service,"Visited Oriole Cafe on a Saturday evening for dinner. It was our second time here, and we came by because we knew we could expect good food. Logen brought us to our table and took our order, plus served the food very promptly. Very good service! He's also very friendly. Ordered Fish Tacos and the Soup of the Day (Mushroom Soup) which came with sourdough toast. The food was so delicious that we wiped our plates clean. Would definitely come back for another visit. Plus point is that they have good music playing over the speakers!"
Wonderful food,Chicken and waffle was delicious! Enjoyed our meal. The hot cakes were a bit disappointing. Recomemnded
Dinner with family Oriole,Service (waiter‚Äôs name Logan) was great. Food amazing. We had the beef and truffle burger and chicken burger. Both my boys loved their meals. Highly recommend.
