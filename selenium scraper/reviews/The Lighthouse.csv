Excellent service provided by the service crew.,"Abigael, charmaine, edgar and the rest of the crew provided excellent service sincerely and with passion. They serve all of our requests timely and we could see their sincere smiles through the masks. Menu were explained thoroughly and the membership for the fullerton club was introduced. A truly enjoyable breakfast experience made by the service crew! We will come back just for them!"
Lovely dim sum lunch,"Had a lovely dim sum lunch at Fullerton. We were attended to by Yvonne, Amy and Alson, and service was impeccable. Food was great too, and 15 dishes is definitely more than sufficient! Will be back again for another occasion!"
Worth a visit!,"Great food and service. Ordered the Michelin Guide set menu and every dish that came was surprisingly good and refreshing, especially the wagyu beef and fish! Service was tiptop as the restaurant staff will explain the details of each dish and make sure you’re okay with the food."
Anniversary celebration didnt disappoint,"Can't beat the view and atmosphere and the service has really improved past couple years... we tried the Merlion and Temasek cocktails, worth a try"
Amazing service!,We managed to finally booked a table at The Fullerton Lighthouse Restaurant during our stay. The view facing The Singapore skyline was just perfect for the evening drinks. Rey and Andy were so friendly and attentive to our need. Definitely will come back for the view and the happy hour!
Great Experience,"Loved how friendly and professional the staffs are. Justin was at the door during our entry and when we had to wait as the staffs at the check in counter were busy, he rushed over and served us immediately. Detailed explanations and assisted with booking of the rooftop bar - The Lighthouse.

At the Lighthouse, we had a lovely view of the entire Marina Bay, we especially loved the day to night transition (~6:30-7:30pm). We also had a few great chat with Ray! The food was splendid too! We will definitely be back again.

The only things which bumped us slightly was that the washroom in our room had a light stench and the standing shower wasn’t working. But these didn’t really mattered much for us as we were using lush and it perfumed up the washroom. The bathtub also had a separate shower head which we used. Overall, a great experience at the Hotel."
Last meal before circuit breaker.,"We visited The Lighthouse on 3 April just as Singapore was stepping up it's COVID19 measures. On 7 April restaurants closed.

There were very few guests the day we visited and the staff were amazing. The were implementing safe distancing and other measures in a subtle and friendly way.

The food and the service were fantastic and the view is really special. The restaurant is quite small and feels exclusive and luxurious. The staff make guests feel incredible special. We look forward to returning when the restaurant re-opens."
Our delightful dining experience here was the perfect ending to our wonderful 40th wedding anniversary Asian adventure.,"From 28 December 2019 to 14 January 2020 my wife and I organised an interesting private 18 day tour, best described as an Asian smorgasbord of familiar and new places, to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary. Beginning with Hong Kong then Macau, the adventure continued to Taiwan and Laos, and then culminated with a three night visit to Singapore staying in the renowned Fullerton Hotel for our anniversary proper.

Our three nights in the Fullerton far exceeded expectations and the Hotel lived up to its huge reputation as one of the truly great Asian hotel experiences. On the afternoon of Sunday 12 January, our actual anniversary, we had just enjoyed a most fabulous Sunday Champagne Brunch in the Hotel’s Town Restaurant and we decided we wanted to follow this up the next evening with a trip farewell Dinner at the Lighthouse Restaurant and Rooftop Bar and check out their Italian fare.

I am always particularly interested in understanding the history of places we visit. How fortunate then that this Restaurant’s printed menu gives the genesis of the Lighthouse Restaurant making for interesting reading. It has been aptly named because a Lighthouse was installed on the rooftop of the Fullerton Hotel, 50 metres above sea level, which was turned on for the first time on 14 December 1958 to guide ships ashore from more than 18 Nautical Miles (33 kilometres) out of Singapore. It replaced the then 103 year old Fort Canning Light on Fort Canning Hill which was gradually being blocked by the City’s High rise buildings. The Fullerton Light sat on a small concrete structure which today is the Lighthouse Restaurant.

The Lighthouse Restaurant and Rooftop Bar is located on the 8th floor and the rooftop of the Fullerton Hotel. Prior to having our meal in the Restaurant we went up to the Rooftop Bar for a pre-dinner drink, my wife choosing a French sparkling wine while I had a very robust red Italian wine. The “picture postcard” views from the Rooftop Bar of Marina Bay and the waterfront were simply stunning. They left an indelible impression on the mind. We arrived in time to see the transition from late afternoon to evening and as it got dark so the lights of the city began to emerge in all their colourful splendour. Complimentary nibbles were provided with our drinks.

The meal in the Restaurant was a real treat. We felt privileged to have been given a table by the window so we could continue to enjoy the Marina Bay waterfront by night throughout the evening. The food was beautifully presented and well cooked. For main course I chose “Giancia Di Manzo Brasata All’aglianico, Purea Di Carote, E…Liquirizia” ( Slow -Cooked Beef Cheek, Campania Red Wine, Carrots Purée, Liquorice) and my wife enjoyed “Spigola Acqua Pazza Indivia E Agrumi” ( Orbetello Sea Bass in Seafood Broth, Endives, Citrus Fruits). Instead of a dessert I had their “Formaggi “(Cheeses), one of the very best cheese boards in my view I have ever experienced, The variety of Italian cheeses and condiments provided was amazing. My wife’s choice of dessert was a very delicious and very colourful “Meringata Di Frutti Di Bosco” (Wild Berry Compote, Meringue, Vanilla Chantilly”. Complimented with a glass of French sparkling wine for the wife and a glass of Italian Rosé wine for me, this was a very lovely meal indeed. While waiting for our mains we were given very nice complimentary bread as a more than tasty meal starter.

The waiter service throughout the evening was first class with attention to detail and a friendly manner very evident. The décor in the Restaurant is pleasing and overall we had a very pleasant dining experience.

As we were heading home back to Brisbane, Australia, the next day, after 18 glorious days “on the Asian road” our dining experience at the Lighthouse Restaurant was the perfect ending to our wonderful 40th wedding anniversary adventure."
"Delicious food, with amazing views over Marina Bay.","After aperitifs at Raffles, we called at the Fullerton, & The Lighthouse for dinner, our window table overlooked Marina Bay & also gave us the chance to watch the evening light show. We enjoyed the lamb & lobster pasta with an excellent bottle of Sauv Blanc. Our desserts were delicious, & the serving staff could not have been more attentive, all in all a superb evening. We visited the roof top bar for a cognac & to further admire the incredible views. A wonderful evening & we shall certainly return in the near future."
Fantastic experience,My wife and I where so lucky to dine at a window table with an extraordinary view of Marina Bay. We asked the waiter for recommendation regarding the food and it was all VERY delicious. We where served by assistant manager Rey Zaldivar who made a great job making our evening very special.
Good view but food not good,"We like the environment of the restaurant, but the food quite expensive and tastes not meet our expectation."
Dinner with stunning views,"Ate here one evening for a light dinner, great music and atmosphere. Food was good and the wine excellent. Service was good and the place was busy. Would recommend"
"Nice venue with great views, good food and attentive staff","Went here for my birthday celebration and had a very pleasant evening.

Staff were friendly and welcoming, the actual space itself is nice - feels more initimate and not like a hotel restaurant (which can feel a little sterile at times).

Views are great, and you can go and appreciate a full 360 from the bar above too.

We went for four courses, starters were good (I went for burrata), followed up by angel hair pasta (wtih lobster) which was also a decent portion and with good flavour. The mains were quite small portion wise, I ended up eating two quite easily, the lamb was the pick of the two. Then a nice moment with a birthday cake at the end.

Service very good, and a decent wine list. Cost overall not that bad (in Singapore terms).

Will be going again!"
Great view and very friendly staff,I visited the rooftop bar as I always enjoy the view. The staff Giri is very friendly and recommended some wine. Good place to spend some leisure time.
"Amazing view, staff, and food","Amazing view, staff, and food in a historic location. What else could you want? Anna, Ray, and Khalid went out of their way to make our anniversary dinner special. We especially appreciated the cake and the photo and card. Such thoughtful touches.

The upstairs bar also shouldn’t be missed."
A special day made more special,"Celebrated my bday with a friend. They took our pictures and printed it as a remembrance which was a really nice gesture apart from the usual complimentary cake.

Food 8/10 (was looking forward to eat pasta however not part of the menu during that day)
Ambiance (9/10)
Staff (10/10) special shoutout to the Asst Manager helping out that day from The Lighthouse"
Evening drinks with a beautiful view,"Came here for post dinner drinks and really enjoyed the harbour/bay views and ambiance. Warm weather makes tropical Singapore an oasis. Drinks were nice and staff were friendly, lively and professional. Giri and Albert were classy and fun."
"Beautiful view, good food, and helpful staff","We visited The Lighthouse (restaurant)
for the first time, and Anna and Khalid were great with their tips. Be sure to look out for them to get good table and food recommendations. Along with the view, the seafood dishes and the desserts were especially delightful.

After dinner, we made our way up to the rooftop bar for a nightcap. Unlike from within the Lighthouse, the view of the bay is unobstructed thanks to the al fresco style of the bar. We enjoyed the cool breeze while taking many shots of the night time city view. Special shout out to Giri for knowing the best spots and angles to take photos at."
Wonderful!!!!!!!!!,Giri & Albert are magnificent!Best place to have a drink and catch up with friends here in Singapore! ❤️
PERFECT ROMANTIC DINNER - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,"Being one of the most highly regarded intimate Italian restraints around, I decided to make a reservation with plans to celebrate my partner’s birthday & do my proposal on the same evening. Mr Rey was very helpful with the arrangements before the actual day.

We arrived at dusk hence had a chance to appreciate the magnificent view of the skyline before sun set while enjoying our drinks at the rooftop bar first.

Over at the restaurant, we were brought to a table by the window allowing us to again enjoy the spectacular views while dining. We had a 4 & 5 course dinner & the food were of quality, it did not disappoint. My partner couldn’t help but sing praises of the dishes served which were mostly recommended by Mr. Khalid. Despite being served in sizeable portions, we were quite full after finishing!

We would like to praise & thank the staffs on duty that evening of our visit - Khalid, Giri, Josephine & Jay
for their hospitality shown to us & assistance given during my proposal. It was a success! We had an excellent dining experience & is our honour for being able to create unforgettable memories at The Lighthouse.
Once again, thank you!!!"
Great food. Fine dining and excellent service!,Had a 3 course business lunch and arrived at 1230. Not many people. When we left at 2. Restaurant quite full but still cozy. Good food and excellent service. Will be back to visit the Roof top bar. Thumbs up!
Would have been a nice visit apart from a very patronising gesture,"Singapore is one of my favourite places in the world and blessed with a multitude of eateries from Hawker stalls to top end restaurants. I like to eat at both and everything in between. For a special treat for my recent visit I decided to book a table at the LightHouse restaurant (Not the roof top bar I should add which would have been unusable in any case due to the torrential rain that day). The weather meant no nice views that evening. I was warmly welcomed by Khalid. Before I was served my Lamb and I was sat enjoying the bread and a glass of Prosecco, the female waitress on duty suddenly came over to my table and unexpectedly placed two fashion and jewellery magazines on my table. I didn't say anything but I will tell you this. I fly all over the world solo and have eaten in hundreds of restaurants and eateries all over the world on my own and never before have I felt so patronised by a gesture. It's 2020. I don't need to flick through a magazine to save me from the perceived embarrassment of a female dining on their own. Ridiculous. When my Lamb came , it was adequate but rather under seasoned. I would have stayed longer at the restaurant for more wine and a dessert but frankly I was still feeling hacked off at being patronised in this sexist way. So I left. Not before I had a word with Khalid telling him how I felt about this matter which he appeared to take onboard."
Fantastic Italian food with awesome view of Marina Bay!,Food did not disappoint. View was spectacular. Service was impeccable. Thanks to Josephine and Khalid for your outstanding hospitality shown to my family. Service provided was first class. All these made it a truly memorable birthday dinner. We’ll be back for sure. Kudos to the team and keep up the good work!
Beautiful view. Ok starter,Beautiful view. Ok starter & not that tasty main course. The main course came very late & cold. I was not happy with my dish so they didn’t make me pay. I rather eat good food & pay than what happened. Not to forget it is a Michelin Restsurante. Really?? Even the presentation of the good is not that appealing. Service is ok. 2 stars just for the view.
Grossly overpriced and bad food,"Grossly overpriced and very sub par meal, was expecting a nice Italian dinner and instead we got under cooked veal, over cooked tenderloin and spam filled pasta."
A lovely evening,"I love going to this rooftop bar. It is a wonderful location and very atmospheric. Fantastic views of Fullerton Bay, Marina Sands and the Civic District as it gets dark. Good range of drinks. Friendly staff. Service can be slow. The height means it can be breezy, but not unpleasant."
Excellent dinner service!,"I would like to commend Mr. Rey, Mr. Khalid, Ms. Anna and Mr. Giri for being so accommodating during our dinner last night. They were perfect! The food was perfect! The ambiance was gorgeous! Excellent service! ❤

Mr. Rey, thank you for the comolimentary drinks for my friend's birthday ❤"
PERFECT ANNIVERSARY DINNER ♥️,"We chose The Lighthouse at the Fullerton before we arrived in Singapore based on positive reviews on TripAdvisor for our 50th wedding anniversary dinner. We were give a wonderful table by the window..spectacular views, wonderful food and great service. Could not have chosen a better venue for our special evening."
Lighthouse,The view is great. The seats were not comfortable and the music was too loud specially the bass.I found it a bit pricy for finger food.
Awesome experience,"3 things make a visit memorable to a restaurant. The food, the ambience and the service. The Lighthouse scores highly on all 3. Of the 3, I think the service leaves the best memory. Flexible, friendly and amusing. Great night out at this restaurant."
"Great food, service and views of Marina Bay","I took my wife to The Lighthouse for a birthday dinner in mid-January and I am happy I made the right restaurant selection. The food was superb and we especially loved the Italian ones such as the ravioli. We were also attended to by Khalid, one of the supervisors there. He was friendly, cheerful and provided great service, making our dinner at The Lighthouse a delightful experience. We will be back again for another special occasion!"
"Very good food, but not up to the mark overall","We went for an early Valentine's Day dinner - after all, these are not everyday prices! In short, we wouldn't go back.

Pluses:
- The food was very tasty and generally well prepared and served
- Prix fixe at SGD 108 for four courses is certainly not cheap but not out of line
- It's a small and relatively intimate setting, with pleasant views
- Staff was friendly

Minuses:
- Decor hasn't been updated in 20-30 years
- Lighting is too bright for a romantic dinner
- Chinese New Year music is inappropriate for an Italian restaurant
- Service was not fully professional. Some was good, but in this kind of restaurant it's absolutely not OK for the wait staff not to be able to explain the menu (which isn't long), to forget to bring the milk for the coffee and then have to be reminded, to forget to refill water glasses . . .
- Main course portions were a bit small
- The chunk of crab leg as part of one of the appetizers was a little spongy, as if it had been frozen or defrosted wrong
- The tarte Tatin was cold, which was odd
- Wines pricey - $25/30 per glass is really quite high.

Net: Doesn't really hit the target for a romantic, Italian restaurant; there are better choices in Singapore, especially at elevated prices."
A little hard to find,"Wonderful food & service with a river view! fIxed price menu a good buy. A little hard to find, but well worth it. Hotel & nrestaurant have a nice, personal & friendly vibe. This is a repeter & I would definitely return."
A Big THANK YOU!,"I would like to compliment all staff who were serving us during our dining last night. Firstly, Anna who did a very warm welcome upon our arrival at the front desk. Secondly, Jay who give us that feeling of luxury and provided with an excellent service. And thirdly, Khalid very kind gentleman,who found a very nice approach to us and thereafter had a nice/funny conversation with me and my partner."
Fabulous views and great service,"We stayed at the Fullerton so had to try out their rooftop bar. Obviously there are fabulous views and we enjoyed authentic Singaporese snacks (crispy fish skin among them) with our drinks. Service was impeccable. Drinks are not cheap, but then that's Singapore for you. Worth doing."
"Incredible Evening for Dinner and Drinks on Chinese New Year! So good, we went back!","Our first night we headed to the Lighthouse restaurant on the 8th Floor. Incredible views over looking the Bay and MBS. Partner chose the Truffle tasting menu which was incredible and myself the 4 course dining. The food was out of this world! Service made you feel warm and welcome and I would certainly recommend for a date night venue!

** Roof Top Bar **

We booked the following night a table on the roof top bar to watch the fireworks and celebrate Chinese New Year. Our hosts on for the evening were Raffy (Supervisor) and Rey(Assistant Manager) - they made the evening so much fun! Their welcoming hospitality and passion really made the whole evening for us! 100% recommend heading to the Lighthouse Restaurant and Rooftop bar!! WE WILL BE BACK!"
Birthday celebration,Quite a pity that even i request sit to view Singapore flyer; i was even to next to the kitchen. A gentle way to celebrate guest's birthday
StelTanRestaurant Review,"Food: recommend the 4 hour slow cooked beef. Melts in your mouth
Lamb: too gamey. Asked for medium: still bloody. After recooking it was so hard. Not good

Ambience: quiet and cozy with a beautiful view

Thanks to: Anna and Rey for attending to us. Very friendly and professional. Anna also gave us a photo to remember last night. Thank you for the special touch

Thanks to mr lim at the rooftop bar for taking very nice photos for us.

To Fullerton: unnecessary stress on employees to 'gain points' on TripAdvisor for the sole advertising advantage of Fullerton. This translates to customers having to write reviews on this platform just to thank employees.
Please review this method of employee promotion by Fullerton."
Lovely bar to sip a Singapore Sling,Lovely relaxing rooftop bar to sip a Singapore Sling whilst watching the nightly Marina Bay Sands light show. Staff very friendly and helpful especially Giri. Thank you!
Relaxing,"Giri and Liam, wonderful service with a smile. Great with great people. Nice view and good atmosphere."
AMAZING,"The most amazing bar, incredible 360 views of the city. Giri and Lim make the best Singapore Slings in town ❤️"
The Fullerton--Best Rooftop Bar,"The Lighthouse @The Fullerton has the best rooftop bar un Singapore! Bartender Giri is a wonderful mixologist with a personality to match. Try to visit around sunset for fabulous views of the Bay and the city. Their signature drink, The Beacon, is delicious. If you go make sure you try both styles of bruschetta!"
Fantastic food and sevice,"My wife and I celebrated my birthday with a lunch here in January 2020. We chose the restaurant because of the excellent value (3 courses for a set lunch with numerous options, for $49 per person) and the amazing location with stunning views, but our experience far exceeded our expectations. The food and wine were superb, beautifully presented and good sized portions. The service was outstanding, particularly from our waiter, Julius, who was friendly, professional and very attentive. Very highly recommended and we will definitely be back."
Watch the setting sum,"Great spot for an evening cocktail or a drink after dinner. At the top of the hotel there always seems to be a cooling, gentle breeze. Bring your camera and take night photos of the city or the laser light show at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel across Singapore Bay."
Excellent dining experience,"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here in late December and enjoyed a memorable dinner. From out greeting at the entrance until our meal was completed and we adjourned to the rooftop, it was an exceptional experience. Excellent food and wine, great attentive service and views across to Marina Bay Sands.
And we were surprised at the value offered and presented with a personal photo taken by their Ukranian staff member.
We highly recommend the Lighthouse Restaurant."
Spectacular view,"We were staying at the Fullerton hotel and stumbled upon the lighthouse rooftop bar and wow what a treat. The bar is located on the rooftop of the Fullerton hotel. You are able to order meze/tapas style food which is delicious. They also serve amazing cocktails, be sure to have a Singapore sling. Try to book a table in time for the lights show on the bay which takes place at 8pm and 9pm. The bar has a really laid back feel and the staff were great."
Must see spot in Singapore!,"Staying at the Fullerton Hotel,and my wife and I went upstairs to the Lighthouse Bar to watch the light show across the water. Beautiful view fantastic service from Giri and Raffy - Giri took fantastic photos of us with the skyline as a backdrop and the Singapore Slings were the bomb! I fyou're ever in Singapore highly recommend!"
"Great views, tiny portions","I dined late and got a window table. The view was great. Despite having a reservation at 9.30 and arriving on time, I was sent upstairs to the bar as my table wasn't ready.

I took the 4 course fixed price menu (SGD 108++ food only) which was a better deal than a la carte but the portions were TINY. The antipasti seafood trio was miniscule: tasty, but more of a canape than an appetiser. Luckily there was a pasta course too and the open ravioli with beef ragout and mozzarella spuma was very good..

For main I selected rack of lamb. This was slightly over-cooked and came with a quarter of an artichoke as vegetables. The jus was tasty but over salted. The lemon delight dessert recommended by the waiter was small and underwhelming.

Not a special fine dining experience and I cannot recommend this restaurant. There must be better places in Singapore for a special dinner."
Best views in town,"The Lighthouse is an exclusive dining experience, often having well-reputed guest chefs. Its Rooftop Bar sports some of the best views in town. Order a pre-dinner cocktail and look down on the Padang! Recommended."
Superb service and delicious food in a luxurious place,"Our group of Filipino doctors in Singapore held our annual christmas party in this restaurant. The food served and helmed by Chef Carlo did not disappoint.The four course gourmet meal consists of Burrata di Andria e Prosciutto di Langhirano which stimulates our appetite , enough to be excited to the Capellini All’astice which is a taste of sea, we had 3 choices of entree (beef,cod fish and pork), I had the Braciola di Maiale e Timo which is rich in flavor and very tender perfect blend with the somewhat sweet puree with it and capped by the Meringatta di frutti di bosco perfect with coffee. The wait staffs checked with us regularly, pouring champagne and wine everytime they see our glasses are near empty, kudos to Jay, Ian, Anna and Khalid for their attentiveness and hospitality. After our sumptuous dinner we went to the rooftop bar and the view is mindblowing- the stark contrast of Singapore modern skyline and the old boatquay in one round about while enjoying the company of good friends drinking the bar’s mocktails and beer. This place is sure to impress their guests."
Excellent Service,"The staff, service and food was just superb. We ordered the degustation menu and it was more than we expected. Thank you"
The best !,"Our group of 9 friends celebrated early Christmas dinner last night. Everything about this restaurant is simply the best. From the food, location, the view and definitely the staff are all deserving tof compliments. Ian the guy who attended to us was great, he was attentive and patient did his best to accomodate our requests with a smile. Superb service."
Food and service,"We got a late notice reservation for the Lighthouse for a dinner without kids. Special evening.

We started with a wonderful drink on the roof, with beautiful view, and then an amazing dinner.
The Lighthouse offers a la carte, or a 4 and 5 course menu options. And the fun part, is you get to pick the options. This is something i have not seen much before, and makes it fun to customize your own Michelin menu.

We cannot say thank you enough to our waiter Jay, who was excellent. He recommend some favorite food items, and wine. He took down two drink orders and two five course (different) meals by memory. Maybe he was recording it, but it was impressive.

Jay made the meal more fun with great conversation and wine recommendations. We asked again for individual wine pairings, but instead Jay recommended a great bottle of wine to start, and when we moved onto the main courses he upped the game with a very nice bottle. In fact, during the night, he returned to notify us another table wanted the same bottle, and they have one left, but we have first option if we wanted.
I thought that was very unique for someone to do. Instead of waiting for us to maybe order it again and have to say ""out of stock"", he was honest and gave us the choice.

Only grumble I can think of, in my opinion (not my wife), was the food came out at different intervals. I got the impression the delays were not typical. But between first course and second was relatively quick, and second to third, was long enough for me to look at my watch twice, and then start counting the minutes. And between entree and dessert, was so quick we couldn't get our dessert drinks to match.

Another great aspect with this restaurant, considering all the menu options, you can go five or six times before you have to start repeating tasting menu dishes.
Conclusion: Amazing restaurant and will definitely return with family and friends and highly recommend."
Fullerton's Hidden Gem,"I have been living in Singapore for the past 3 years, and never have I heard of this place. So when I was invited, without hesitation, I said yes. The staffs are very welcoming, and their produxt knowledge is topnotch. I would like to commend Ian and Raffy for their hardwork and their warm hospitality. The Lighthouse is my new found friend for my barhopping activity. We'll be back soon... and oh, only Fullerton offers Fish Skin as complimentary snack."
The Lighthouse rooftop bar,"Everything about The Fullerton Hotel Singapore is superb.
The rooftop bar is small, but delightful. Barmen Giri and Ian really know how to make a cocktail. The Mojito is one of the best I’ve had. And the Singapore Sling is yum! Highly recommended"
Lovely meal with fabulous view,"A wonderful restaurant although quite expensive. My husband took me there as a birthday treat and we were not disappointed. We requested a window table with a view of the Marina Bay Waterfront and what a view it was. We even got to see the laser show from the Marina Bay Sands (However, the laser show is even better from the top of the Marina Bay Sands). It is an intimate restaurant and we felt really relaxed as we were taken through the menus by our server Ian. He was very attentive always arriving at the right time to top up our glasses with wine. We also had a good chat about Singapore. We chose from the Degustation Menu which allows you to choose a dish from each of the 4 courses. The food was excellent and we would definitely go there again if we return to Singapore. A tip – you can book online up to 3 weeks before so you are assured a table. It can get booked up very quickly.
After dinner we went upstairs and had a drink in the rooftop bar and once again, fabulous views."
Marvellous view even from not so high above!!!,I have enjoyed a delicious fresh white wine at the Lighthouse Rooftop Bar at the beginning of my holiday which was a terrific start. The views and the friendly and attentive staff have made me forget the fatigue from travelling and the next day I went up again to enjoy those great views by daylight.
A great experience! 😊,"We went for dinner and to enjoy a good drink here, with a nice view of the Marina Bay. We also had the pleasure to enjoy the LED Light show from here. The staff is so kind! We got an excellent dinner here. I am a vegetarian, and I really enjoyed the food I got served. The greens were so fresh and tasty, also my starter and the main was so good. I’m definitely coming here again, next time I visit Singapore I’ll highly recommend you to go for a lunch or dinner here. The atmosphere is great, and you’ll enjoy it for sure"
Fullerton Lighthouse,Fabulous view of Marina Bay Sands and CBD with an intimate seating area. Giri and Raffy were very attentive and personable. We absolutely love it here!
nice Italian restaurant with oustanding view,everything in general is authentic portions are very small though I found it expensive for the quality of the food (which is still high)
Enjoyed our G&T’s the Lighthouse bar,"Enjoyed our G&T’s the Lighthouse rooftop bar while watching the light show over the Marina Bay, staff were excellent (Giri & Raffy), good job guys. Great job Fullerton Hotel."
Great location to watch the,"Great location to watch the evening laser light show in the harbor. Great view of the Marina Sands Hotel as well. Service was awesome thanks to Giri and Raffy. When things got busy, Jay Nair (Manager)hopped behind the bar as well, to reduce wait times. A real team effort. Food is available off the Italian Restaurant Menu (one floor below. Also stunning views). The food was very good. Do try a “Singapore Sling”. After all, you’re in Singapore."
"Water, water everywhere.","This is a great place for a good view of the water and the Marina Bay Hotel. If you get there before the light show begins, you’ve gotta great position.
Water, water everywhere, also refers to the Dry Gin Martinis ordered. Duly came - tasted of water, complained. “Terribly sorry”. Another two were served. Again, tasted of water! Barman came to the table and doesn’t know how we think it tastes like water. Then serves us neat gin from a Tanqueray 10 bottle and it still tastes like water! Because it is water!! At no time time will he taste the drink and he still insists it’s Gin. Eventually, he says there’s been a mix up. Someone’s put water in an empty bottle of Tanqueray 10 Gin as a display bottle and he’s used that by mistake.
So, we’ll give him the benefit of the doubt. Eventhough, it took us three attempts to tell him he was serving us water and nothing remotely alcoholic."
Brilliant service,"I visited 9th November 2019 with my husband, teenage son and 9 month old daughter for my birthday.
The food was brilliantly cooked and presented, the ambience in the restaurant itself was great with subtle background music. We was attended to by a gentleman called Julius who was very professional, friendly and polite. We was also looked after by a gentleman called Jay who was also on the front desk. Jay went above and beyond looking after us. I had forgot to pack bottles in the baby bag for my daughter and Jay fixed the problem by getting us a baby bottle for my daughter's milk. Without this, dinner would have been ruined! Jay was also very friendly, stopping to chat and play with my baby which I found lovely as babies can be overlooked in high end restaurants like The Lighthouse. The view was wonderful facing MBS and being able to watch the light show from our table. We went upstairs to the rooftop bar also where we managed to get some fab pictures. We will definitely visit again!"
Everything was perfect except the freezing A/C,"The beige-tuned soft decoration makes the dining room calm and cosy. The view is awesome on Merlion and Marina Bay Sand. We chose a 4 course menu. Every dish was good and properly cooked. Classic table and dishes dressing. Good professional service.
Please bring a jacket and a cap because A/C is very cold.Much too cold. After one hour under the iced airflow we wanted to leave ASAP. Locals and Chinese tourist like it? Not me."
Loved Lighthouse Bar!,"Beautiful night & gorgeous view! We were not hungry for a meal but enjoyed a delicious charcuterie plate & drinks. Raffy & Giri we’re attentive, delightful servers!"
Perfect View,i guess people are there for the amazing view...it is definitely worth to go...just a bit trouble to locate the bar...overall is find...maybe next time i will try the food at the restaurant...
Best view and best Singapore Sling,Mega ambiance with cool drinks and cool stuff. It’s how a nightly rooftop should work. Thanks to smiling Raffy who is the born barkeeper. Perfect site to watch in direct distance the laser show over Marina Bay
White Truffle Menu was Amazing,"Outstanding evening - service, ambiance, cuisine and wine. Go and enjoy the white truffle menu! The white truffle tagliolini was amazing"
"Classy cocktails, good vibes, fun service and a stunning view","We went for a drink and the panorama of Marine Bay, but stayed for snacks and wine in spite of the rain, mainly because energetic host Raffy made it such fun - his own cool 80s disco mix included. Cocktails were well made and the awnings provide enough shelter under which to enjoy the terrific bay view. Great spot."
Singapore at night,"Fabulous service, food and bar! The view was amazing! We ordered an antipasto plate and it was fantastic! Great way to have cocktails with the backdrop!"
Friendly staff and lovely view of Marina Bay,"A friend was staying at the Fullerton which gave us an opportunity to catch up over drinks.
The bar is one level above the restaurant. The selection of malt whisky is limited but they have the top malts. The staff is very friendly and recommended some good finger food.
The view of Marina Bay is simply awesome!
Needless to say, you pay a pretty penny for the experience"
Amazing and a Wonderful Anniversary Dinner,"Lighthouse is small, around 15 tables at the most by my reckoning but the staff and setting are top notch. There is a small rooftop bar above the restaurant proper that gave a great night view of Marina Bay. My wife and I visited it for our anniversary dinner and we had a great time. Table changes were done with minimal fuss, the manager made small talk but respected our privacy. I was even offer a complimentary cake for my birthday which was around the corner. And the bread rolls served for table service to die for. Thank you for making our visit special!"
Roof top bar,"We had an amazing stay at the Fullerton.
Our many hosts in the lighthouse restaurant and the bar were wonderful especially Giri who always made us feel so welcome.
The food, drinks and view were stunning and really made our 25th wedding anniversary very special, thank you."
Amazing views and service,"Had a pre-meal cocktail here. Fantastic service, amazing views of Singapore and well worth the visit. We were not residents at the hotel, but wanted to have a drink in a classy bar. Amazing bar staff and prices very reasonable. Would visit again."
Excellent service along with excellent food,It was a pleasant dinner with nice food choices. The ambience was warm and cosy. Highly recommend for any mini private celebration! Will definitely to return.
Friendly staff & romantic ambience,"Had the 5 course meal at Fullerton lighthouse w great sceneries. Staff were really attentive to make sure our water is refilled, if we need more bread and when to clear our plates for next course. They even prepared additional cake to celebrate my birthday! :') Thank you khalid for making our dinner an enjoyable one!"
a gorgeous place to watch the sunset,"this is a lovely spot to watch the sunset, on the rooftop bar, great view of marina bay....Ian and Giri were waiting on us and were fabulous hosts."
Exquisite from start to finish,"Took my family here for a dinner treat for a special occasion. It was just an amazing experience from start to finish.

Food was lovely. As a party of 5, we tried quite a few items on the menu and everything we tried was really delicious. Even the bread basket and fried cheese snack they served before the meal was divinely addictive.

Ambience is cozy and very private. The restaurant has a great view of marina bay sands. We happened to visit on a Saturday that had an NDP preview and were treated to a truly impressive fireworks show!

Best part was definitely the wonderful service. The waiter who served our table was thoughtful, timely and made us feel at home. Truly seamless service without being the least bit intrusive at all.

Had a truly memorable time at this restaurant. My family members kept talking about it for many days after. Thank you for such a lovely experience.

If you are looking for a place to celebrate a special occasion, this is the perfect place. It is pricey but truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience."
Wonderful dinner experience at The Lighthouse Fullerton,"We had a birthday dinner celebration at the Lighthouse Restaurant during the Formula One race weekend. Unforgettable experience. The food quality and taste are fantastic, the view from both the restaurant and the bar are amazing. The staff are very attentive and the service were superb. Thank you Jay for specially arranging window table for us, and thank you Anna for the surprise birthday cake :)"
Wow,This restaurant has one of the best views in Singapore. It’s a small intimate restaurant with only a few tables which makes the experience all the more special. I had a wonderful degustation here for my birthday and the food was amazing and very reasonably priced. I cannot remember the name of the lovely hostess looking after us for the night but she made the experience great. If you plan on heading up to the bar just be warned the spiral staircase is tricky in heels but the view is worth it. If you want more than just one drink before dinner then I would suggest booking a table. The bar area is small and the staff seemed a little overwhelmed. Will be back for sure.
Excellent Service,"Service was excellent, in particular Supervisor Khalid, was extremely attentive to our needs and engaged us constantly with a smile and utmost sincerity. His warm service delighted our evening.

The chef was also excellent as we were served gluten-free and dairy-free dishes even though we were supposed to be on a standard fixed menu from the Citibank's Prestige promotion."
Excellent service and food,"Best views of mbs, the city landscape and night lightshow. Food is very good. But the most impressive is the very attentive top notch service standards. Especially from supervisor Julius Cabanos who wowed us with his excellent service and recommendations!!"
"Great view, food and experience.","This place is a gem. Although a business function I would return on a personal basis. The bar on top and the views it provides are excellent....then the food, It was well presented, served and tasted exceptional. A great experience."
Celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary,"As soon as we arrived at the restraunt, we went up to the rooftop bar for drinks, enjoying the sunset, the view of the city as well as Marina Bay Sands. For dinner we had the 4 course degustation menu. Plenty of choice to suit our tastes. At the end of dinner,they even brought out a slice of cake for our anniversary.

Rey looked after us through the night, was very attentive and friendly.

Even though the reservation was made literally at the last minute, Jay was able to fit us in and get a table for us."
Birthday dinner,"Nice ambient with magnificent view of Marina Baysands. Staff are attentive, friendly especially Jay, Rey and Anna. Foods are tasty and well presented. A small cake is given for my birthday as a surprise. All these make our night memorable."
Proposal,"The staffs(Anna, Alexandra) were very helpful with the planning of the proposal and I am very thankful. (She was really shy, but she said yes) There was another male staff (I am sorry I forgot your name, I remembered that you are married with 5 kids), he was really friendly as well and the food was awesome.The scenery was superb and the ambience as well. All these little experiences made our dinner a really wonderful one. Thank you"
Fabulous dinner with great views,"I took some colleagues here for dinner and service, food, wine selection and views were excellent. We especially loved the desserts! I would highly recommend. You can also get a peek of the light show at Marina Bay Sands."
Great bar,Visit the Lighthouse Rooftop bar at The Fullerton and be well looked after by the wonderful Giri and Raffy . They’ll serve you drinks with a smile and fun chat while you enjoy the most spectacular views. (and you don’t have to be staying at the hotel).
"Spectacular view, wonderful food and service","The lighthouse restaurant has a beautiful view of the Marina sands hotel, the food was delicious and the service was second to none. If you are lucky enough to be seated near the windows on the Marina sands side you can watch the laser show although you do lose some of the details. You can also go up upstairs and watch the laser show from the rooftop bar."
Great views and drinks for the Lighthouse!,"Amazing panorama views from the rooftop bar! Good drinks as well as great service from Giri and Julius. Margarita and Mule cocktails on point. Couldn’t stay for the epic light show, but I’ll be back next time!"
"Great place, nice environment.","Booked the table via email a week in advance as i was proposing. The staff were very helpful over email asking if there was anything i needed, but there wasn't much except for my request for a corner table overlooking the beautiful view at the rooftop bar, and a window seat in the restaurant where we ate dinner after.

To start:
-Burrata Di Andria E Prosciutto Di Langhirano
-Parmigiana Di Melanzane Siciliane

Mains:
-Agnello, Carciofi E Aglio Rosa, Fondo Di Marsala
-Guancia Di Manzo Brasata All’aglianico, Purea Di Carote E… Liquirizia

Dessert:
-Lighthouse Espresso Tiramisu.

AMAZING FOOD. I cannot stress that enough, the meats were so soft and almost flakey melt in your mouth like. The tiramisu at the end was excellent as well. Incredible, worth every cent spent.

Thank you Giri & Raffy at the rooftop bar for the great service and being so friendly. Always checking if I needed anything and ensuring my proposal went well.

In the restaurant great service by Jay and Khalid. Extremely attentive service staff, polite and professional.

Thank you for the wonderful time and making our experience worth it."
Rooftop Bar - Great view and relaxing spot to view the Marina Bay lightship,"A great spot to watch the Marina Bay lightshow (at 8 or 9 pm). Take the lift to the 8th fl from the main Fullerton building main lobby, then another side lift on the 8th to the restaurant, then up the stairs.
We were there after seeing the 8 pm lightshow from the Clifton Pier square (another part of the Fullerton complex) and having a couple of drinks awaiting the 9 pm show. The bar was a much better view point and not crowded (it was a Sunday night and a private party at the restaurant had just finished). Staff were attentive, but the prices hefty (S17++) for a tiger beer. It was also a tad disappointing that they had a smoking table but it was on the far side of the large fans and smoke wasn’t an issue. The night was still, as expected, hence they had fans creating a cooling breeze. We also enjoyed a Singapore Sling.
The view was spectacular for all of Marina Bay and 270 deg view. We saw many more features of the lightshow than the 8pm viewing at the square. It is only about 10 stories high but seemed higher.
I expect it would have been busier if the private party hadn’t blocked entry until after 8 pm.
Definitely a return visit the next time in Singapore."
Exceptional View matched by exceptional dining,"We had booked the restaurant for lunch before leaving home. Most other diners were business people but we were made to feel very comfortable despite our more ""tourist"" attire. The 3 course meal was delicious and the view of SIngapore a great accompaniment. After our meal the waiter offered to take us up to the rooftop bar one floor further up for an even more spectacular view. Great service all round. A truly memorable part of our holiday."
bad service,"Very disappointed with this famous 5 stars hotel. even Andaz service win them big times. food and services we encounter all gone wrong. best part, it's my girlfriend birthday."
A hidden gem of a bar,"What a fabulously romantic place to have a drink and watch the spectacular Singapore light show across the bay. The Hotel itself is pure class, a lovely building and a place my husband and I vowed to return and stay on a futute visit. The lighthouse bar is a real find. We originally thought we were going to the Lantern bar but this is in the Fullerton Bay Hotel across the road. How glad we were that we made that mistake as this is a best-kept secret. It was quiet and had an amazing view of the bay. The bar staff were attentive and friendly (they used to work at Raffles). So a high five to Raffy, Lam and Giri (if I have spelt your names correctly!). A real hidden gem."
The beacon of Singapore's night light shows,"The Lighthouse Rooftop Bar is an exceptional place to enjoy and experience the atmosphere of Singapore's evening night light show in an open-air venue. The hospitality, friendliness and freedom from the professional staff to view, photograph and capture the cityscape is marvellous, and I highly recommend a Singapore Sling cocktail from Raffy the bartender - totally top shelf !!!"
Charged extra drinks in the receipt,"Hi All,

I went to the lighthouse for my bf's birthday celebration. The food was alright and staffs were nice and friendly. It was a disappointment because they charge extra champagne and Singapore sling which we didn't order during the dinner.

I called back to ask for the refund and their mistake on the bill. They promise to do a refund in 5days from the first call on the day itself on 7aug, another call in to ask for refund. The lady promise to refund within 10 days from 7aug. Till now, 22aug I still haven't get back my refunds on the two drinks.

I would like to share the story here to remind you to check the receipt if you choose to dine in this restaurant. Thank you.

Attached receipt and photos from that night."
Impeccable service with a really hospitable bartender,"We were here for a birthday celebration and had a pleasant experience. Will recommend others to try this place at least once.

Ambience / Service: A small cosy restaurant with tables strategically positioned for sufficient privacy for the diners. Service was definitely impeccable. We had Khalid who waited our table, and he was very proactive in checking on our dining progress, clearing the crumbs, topping up our water and even assisting to take photographs. And thank you for the surprise birthday cake at the end. That was certainly a lovely gesture.

View: Splendid view of the Esplanade Bay & MBS. Come around 7pm to catch the sunset and subsequently the lightshow from MBS. Do reserve in advance for the table with a window view. Apparently the middle table (best view IMO) has to be reserved months ahead, so do try asking for that if its a dinner for a special occasion (birthday, anniversary etc).

Food: Food is generally above average to just good (there isn't an option for ""good"" or ""above average"" in the rating scale; its about a 3.8-3.9 out of 5). We had the cheese platter, 2 pastas and a main (lamb rack). The best item was the cheese platter, which ironically doesn't need much preparation work. The lobster capellini was probably 2-3 minutes overcooked and hence not aldente. Lamb rack was more towards medium-well and not the medium we wanted, making it a tad hard to cut. Nonetheless, the 2 sauces complimented the lamb perfectly while the Raviolo Aperto was well-received by my girlfriend.

Post-dinner drinks: Make your way up for a cocktail or 2 after dinner. Giri was a rather charming bartender who showered us with much hospitality. Ask him for a recommendation or 2 if you don't know what to drink. He might surprise you with off-menu mixes. Thank you for the surprise birthday shot of alcohol."
Great Service,"Great service, friendly staff, prompt responses and very very customer focused. The view and the drinks are just great. The staff makes it even more entertaining.

Thank you Giri, Raffy and Ian."
