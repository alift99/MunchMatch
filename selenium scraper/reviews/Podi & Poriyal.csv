Lunch Set for 2,"We visited Podi and Poriyal as we had heard good reviews. The food was disappointing the prices were steep. The rasam and sambhar are much better is nearby restaurants. Definitely not a meal where the customers are made to pay 89 dollars ( taxes included) for a meal for 2.

Understand that price is stated upfront, but the taste of food was no where near fine dining. Soaked moong dal was served on the starter dish with no flavor, medu vada was decent. The carrot payasam was a mix of condensed milk and carrot juice with little to no flavor.

Would prefer to go to Murugan Idli , MTR or Swaadisth for wholesome South Indian meal over splurging 90 dollars on a purely conceptulized meal."
Diwali lunch,"Absolute finger licking tasty food. Trying innovative ideas and still maintaining the traditional authentic taste is an art and Podi Poriyal has mastered it. My family thouroughly enjoyed the great hospitality of the entire team except the lady in the team who I found was indifferent towards her guests. My banana leaf was torn and when I asked for a change she just asked me to turn it the other way round where less food will be served! However little food is served over the slit, still the food would be in direct contact with the table through the tear and that's unhygienic and poses health hazard. I do not know why I accepted her unfriendly suggestion but I did. This is very disappointing as I do not expect such lapse in service from a restaurant of this standard over such trivial issue, when charging over $200 for 3. I also feel if I had asked any of the other team members they would have replaced my banana leaf. Nevertheless, not allowing this episode to dampen my festive mood, I continued eating. The food, and the service from the rest of the team was mindblowing."
Each sip and bite has a story to tell,Every dish & drink taught me something new and did something unexpected. All of the cocktails are incredible. The Jeerige is the most unique and flavorful twist on a Moscow mule I’ve ever experienced.
Extraordinary!!,"This is not a typical culinary experience. The owners and staff are innovative, welcoming, very well informed in what they serve, attentive, and provide a very thoughtful, delectable experience. A must visit for anyone seeking a very different yet enjoyable culinary experience."
Proof behaviour by employees,Visited podi & Poriyal restaurant at Singapore the experience was very poor from its employees. Attitude of the employees are very poor. They are showing racist behaviour to customers. Blaming the customer. Not polite in the approach. When ask the owners need to give feed back. They refused to give the employees names who misbehaved. Higher charges. Even we have better restaurants in Singapore then this.
Disappointed,"Terrible food - all cold! Given the emphasis on presentation, expected the food to be top notch as well. Very disappointed with the quality and value - very expensive for the quality of food. Hope onto MTR right beside instead"
Best authentic vegetarian food,"Undoubtedly one of the best South Indian vegetarian restaurant in Singapore! I had their full course lunch. The starters were amazing- fresh carrot salad/ kosambari, crispy deep fried spinach fritters/pakoda, healthy millet balls/urundai and the highlight of the starters were the vadas! Omg, the vada was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and pillowy on the inside! Was also served a yumm sweet and sour pachadi! The main course were authentic and delicious rice and gravy dishes! Sambar(lentil based gravy), mor kuzhambu (yoghurt based ), tamarind rice, millet, potato fry, parupu usili (lentil with a veg)and rasam!! Had crunchy vadams as accompaniment! The dishes were simple but tasted great and prepared in a traditional way- The way these dishes are prepared in any South Indian vegetarian home kitchen! Ended the meal with a lip smacking millet payasam! The portion size is good! The service was wonderful with courteous and pleasant staff! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to savour authentic South Indian vegetarian food! Must try those vadas!!"
Traditional South Indian experience,We enjoy the food and Cocktails here. It's nostalgia when it comes to traditional dishes and fun experience with the cocktails made using some of the ingredients that we didn't know can be used before. Staff are very friendly and happy to get feedbacks.
Absolute gem,"The food is authentic, not over spiced, and portions are just right! Probably my 4th visit here and it's always been as good."
A unique experience not to be missed,"A unique experience of a South Indian vegetarian breakfast. Singapore offers a huge variety of South indian breakfast n brunch. some popular Indian chains exist here as well. But you must visit Podi & Poriyal to experience a very different and unique palette of vegetarian south indian brunch. First up, minimal confusion due to myriad choices. 4 items to choose from, with 3 sides to choose from. accompanied by coffee or Chai. simple. if u r a gang of 4, go for variety so u can taste all of it. some combinations offered are unique, not to be found in any other restaurants. most unique, the preparation is as close to ""home made"" if u r from the south of India. there are Dosa, idly, vadai n pongal, so well covered variety. the sides are classic south indian and must try.
it's definitely priced higher than the neighborhood outlets, but as you step out, you will feel every bit worth. in short, not to be missed"
Never Disappointing - Always a gastronomic trip,"This is the sort of restaurant one feels hesitant in reviewing, not because it isn't good but because one fears the descent of the hoi polloi into this (my) culinary shrine and the misunderstanding it inevitably brings, especially in a country where low price trumps taste, and particularly in vegetarian food.
In short:
1. The title says it all.
2. Trust your maître d'
3. Share your food.
4. Leave room for dessert.
5. The drinks, alcoholic and non-alcoholic, are excellent.
Oh btw, I spend <$100 for 2 each time, always having the time of my life."
Overrated,"Completely disappointing experience. When we entered the restaurant at 7 pm, the person at the door tried his best to dissuade us from entering the restaurant despite having empty tables because he was expecting guests at 8 pm who had booked in advance. I failed to understand his selling and commercial acumen of an opportunity loss when the restaurant is vacant and a customer is waiting to occupy a table. We had to convince him we would finish our meals in 50 minutes and he was convincing us otherwise that they would take a long time to prepare the food. So much for customer experience. I did not rate the food very high to justify the premium we paid for dosa and paruppa vadai. The Panaham tasted less authentic than their claims. More than the price, what was more disappointing was the attitude and the absence of authentic hospitality."
Outstanding,It’s a wonder why this bar is not on the top 100 bars in the world. The cocktail fusions by bartender Maestro Gajendran transported us to a celestial palace somewhere in a madras of the eras gone by. We felt like royalty. Keith the manager guided us on this gastronomic intergalactic adventure and Kalai ensured we tasted the best of what the kitchen conjured.
not a great place,if you have to go Podi and Poriyal you have to be a AngMo .. or cannot eat meals there.. we had this weird looks since we opted for Meals ( it was lunch time by the way ) . The guy who served our table was not caring and was kind of showing a lot of attitude ( may be it was running in his mind that we opted for meals in a fine dine place). We have been to this restaurant many times when they had started initially and we always loved the food. But now since they have all whites coming to their restaurant they find it more pleasing to serve them and look down at us.. so please dont go if you are planning to eat a nice lunch there but you can go if you are going to eat Dosa varieties for lunch and you will have all the respect in the world there.
Awesome TamilNadu fare “with a difference”!,"Truly impressed on our very first visit here! Highly recommended by those resident in Singapore, we certainly walked in with high expectations. And those were fully met, May I assure you. The ambience was culturally rich with lots of ancient Madras pics on display. With limited tables all fully reserved weeks in advance, the setting was indeed ‘exclusive’. We settled for the ‘ Set Meal’. For Starters, we got cauliflower bajjis,exquisite vadais served with various chutneys and ‘ panagam’ as the drink. For the Main Course, we got capsicum Sambar, piping hot rasam, raw banana vegetable with beans ‘paruppu usili’ and very nice rice. We also ordered Manga Margarita & tender coconut mock tail. The servings were super-tasty “with a difference”. Accompaniments included fried ‘ vethel’ & assorted podis. Dessert offering was ‘payasam’. We wrapped the meal with piping hot filter coffee which was 100% authentic served in brass tumbler -dabara! A truly memorable meal with a difference!
Will definitely return"
Simple but Serene,"Focussed on simplicity in taste , Great service and brave fusion ideas .
Loved our visit on special day and a great ambience to celebrate special occasions. Desserts and Drinks were just outstanding.
A little high on price for some commodity south indian dishes but try other things will be my suggestion"
Fine dining south indian amazing,Amazing fine dining experience. The food tastes very good and the service was very good. Rich south indian flavour and nice environment and seating.
Awesome service,"Awesome attention to details from the time we arrived till we left. It is hard to get good service in Singapore.
Presentation wise, I have never seen anywhere in Singapore done by South Indian restaurants.
Common to see that in Northern Indian restaurants.
Well done, and please keep it up. Moreover, the story lines by each dashes served by the staff are great. There is so much nourishment in each dish."
Great,Awesome vegetarian food. The taste is on point. Did not try drinks. The mango Curry and beetroot halwa with ice cream is really good and must try.
Fabulous lunch,"Visited for lunch and had a great experience as always. The customer service is fantastic, the staff are so welcoming and passionate about the food. The set lunch was delicious. Will be back again!"
review,Good fiod and service..food presentation and the style is creative. The cost is high and not justified.
Exceptional food,"We totally loved our meal at Podi & Poriyal. TBH I wanted to have the set lunch but they had taken it away as part of the revamp and renovation of the restaurant. But it worked for the better as there were more options like Dosai & Ooothappam.
We had two set lunches, and a dosai and oothappam.
what was absolutely awesome was:
a. I have almost never had a parangikai pacchadi - maybe as part of a wedding so that was brilliant.
b. we also had the allepey curry which as superb.
c. instead of papad which is what is provided in every other indian restaurant, they gave us vadaam
d. garlic pickle was to die for.

The dessert - the vegan coconut ice cream with fresh brewed coffee was yummy and the masala chai ice cream stole the show. that is not to say that the payasam that came with the set meal was not great - but kadala paruppu payasam is something that we eat at home as well so while it was absolutely delicious i have to give my vote to the ice cream.

If we could, I would definitely try to have had to coffee as well - the fresh brew smelled divine.

we were very well taken care of by Kalai.

Overall, we loved the experience definitely homely home cooked South Indian food - which cannot be found anywhere in Singapore. very tasteful decor, and great service. This is not something that we would have seen in other restaurants other than the extreme high end restaurant."
Authentic,"Different to other restaurants, and truly authentic. The food and the service are both like you have been invited to someone’s home. Additionally it is so nice to know that profits are distributed to worthy causes. Definitely recommend."
Amazing food and lovely staff!,"I came here with my partner for his birthday and I'm so glad I chose this place!

The food is so good, and the desi twist on the cocktails is to die for as well. The podi idli was definitely the standout, I cannot stop thinking about it.

On top of that, the staff was incredibly friendly, and did everything they could to make our visit a pleasant one. A must visit!"
"Classy ""home ""experience","We had lunch as a group of 3. We normally are a group of 5 or 3 . We found the food delicious , of high quality and pure ingredients .
We have always enjoyed the friendly service and nice home style cuisine we get at this restaurant as well as the innovative cocktails during the evening service."
"Great experience, food, taste service","Love the enthusiasm, vibe and great experience this gem of a restaurant offers! Good food, high-quality ingredients, and passionate service staff who will go all out to ensure that you have a great time! Love it!"
Good food and courteous staff,Their menu is always interesting. Good is good. A relaxed evening out with the family. Very helpful and courteous staff.
Wonderful!,"At first, I always thought it will just be a mediocre experience as always on certain restaurants. Always, there will be ""The food is excellent"" and you will go back there again just for the food.

But, it's different in Podi & Poriyal. The reception by the boss is warming, just like old friends coming back to a house for a meal. With good hospitality by the staff of Podi & Poriyal, the food recommendations was instigated by the boss himself who wanted to suggest a ""omakase-style"". They are always having conversations around, checking up on you whether if you are comfortable with the setting. The restaurant was not a very big restaurant. Very intimate but wholesome!

Food-wise was beyond expectation. It was like, a grandma giving you her home-cooked food made with love. And it was definitely well-spent treating a birthday dinner to my boyfriend who is from Tamil Nadu. He highly compliments the food as it reminds him of a home-cooked meal back home. There's where you know the food at Podi & Poriyal hits the spot!"
Lunchtime bliss!,I had an absolutely wonderful experience at this excellent restaurant. From entering the restaurant to leaving there want a thing to complain about. The food was divine! Not at all heavy and greasy like many an Indian restaurant I’ve been to.
Authentic and delicious,Outstanding authentic food in a lively location where the staff treat you like family. Equally great for taking out of towners or a weeknight dinner with friends.
Over charging,"I had booked a table for 2 for 21 Nov. 2021 and while booking they charged my credit card SGD48/- as advance fee which will be adjusted in the bill. The charge was in the account of ARPANAM PTE LTD. +6590178404 SG.
On 21 Nov. when we visited the restaurant I had to pay a bill of SGD 124.76. I informed the waiter that I had paid SGD 48/- while booking and requested them to adjust in the bill. But I was informed that cannot be done.
I do not know the reason. If the restaurant cannot adjust during final payment then why do they charge the customers before. Till today i.e. 24/11/2021 the restaurant has not credited back my money. I really do not know if I will get my money back.
When the restaurant want collect a deposit for NO SHOW in advance, why don't they adjust with final bill?"
An Excellent South Indian Meal,It’s been several months since I was in Singapore and I took the opportunity to visit here again. The meal was as delicious as I remembered it and the service was as polite and well informed as ever. Highly recommended.
Fantastic Food and Excellent Service,"Awesome food and very friendly staff. Drinks, ambience and helpful staff explaining each dish made the experience wonderful. Will visit again for sure."
One of the best restaurants I have ever been to,I have been several times to Podi & Poriyal and the menu is always fresh and equally delicious. The high quality of the food is only matched by the wonderful service you receive from the staff. You feel like the staff genuinely take great satisfaction in delighting you as a customer and always willing to go the extra mile. A very special place.
Unique treat with excellent service not to be missed,"This was my first time at Podi and Poriyal and the food and drinks were excellent and unique infused taking health into mind. The staff there are knowledgeable about the dishes, friendly and engaging. Would like to thank Kalai for the excellent service."
A delightful find.,"Was walking along the street and happened upon this place by chance - unfortunately at that time it was fully booked, but the staff and atmosphere looked great.

Reserved a spot and went back a week later, and it was magnificent, the food and drinks were unique and delicious (thank you to our server, kalai for they’re incredible recommendations and great service) and the service was impeccable.

Thanks to the staff, will be back again."
Dinner is over priced and not worth it,"Small portion size of meals, condiments (sambhar chutney ) we had to ask again and again for it,Dinner is not worth the price. I won’t recommend going for dinner. Their lunch is better experience"
Family gathering.,"Restaurant
Ambiance was good.
Decor decorated tastefully.
Food overated with limited choice.
Lunch did not have a choice beside Thali.
Rasam and curd was inclusive in the 6 side dishes we had.
Will not return."
Nice ambience and service but disappointing food,"The restaurant is welcoming with personal attention by the staff. However, we found the mains in the set meal to be bland for a traditional south indian eatery. The sambar and rasam were served luke warm and vegetables could have been tastier. The medu vadas were excellent. Quite expensive too."
Nice but way overpriced,"We were a group of four. When we arrived on time, our table was not ready and was asked to wait outside the restaurant (we booked 2+ weeks in advance).

The service was nice with recommendations, some interaction with waiters and cocktails were also tasy (but expensive). The food taste was quite ordinary to me. Our bill came out to approx $70/head, we were only just about full.

The lotus root dish was ok but a bit too fried. Really didn't like the sweet potato pepper toss. The bana flower vadai was nice and was our favourite dish.

The podi masala flavour was a bit the same on everything.

I would only save the money and go to a regular South Indian, have some podi idli and dosa and spend only $10-15/head.

Fine dining probably works better for cuisine from other parts of south india."
Not worth the money.,"Rasam had no aroma neither salt
Price is very expensive not worth the money.
Two person meal with coffee is 83 dollar
What a waste"
Simple but homely meal.,We had dinner at P&P. It was an ala Carte menu- pretty good variety. The appetizers were fresh and really yummy. Good quantity as well. The cocktails were very nice too. We enjoyed our meal!
Wonderful experience with authentic taste,"Had a wonderful experience with the special Onam thali for lunch. We were greeted with welcome drink which was very refreshing in taste. The food was authentic and most items were unlimited servings. This is an absolute treat for the vegetarian food lovers. I will definitely come back to try out the other dishes.
The staff is very friendly . We really enjoyed our fist visit to the place."
Reminds me of home cooked south Indian meals (saapadu)....,"We ordered lunch from Podi & Poriyal many times during Circuit breaker. It has been great most of the times and consistent and great experience. we have also had lunch in person - lovely hosts and they make you feel welcomed. All podis, chutneys, condiments were excellent too. It was something closest to home made food. In terms of price, it is expensive - comparable to Rang Mahal/ Tiffin room/ Fullerton Indian buffet from past etc - but food is indeed authentic south indian samayal. Before they came up, only had Greenleaf cafe, New Woodlands, Komala Villas etc as options for real ""sapadu"" experience in Little India. Ambience at Podi Poriyal is definitely much better than other places in Little India from above names. That also explains the premium pricing - though I wont classify them as fine dining. Given I grew up eating this kind of food, this cuisine beats them all ""5 star"" resident south Indian desi food options in terms of getting value for money! I just wish, they expand and have one more branch maintaining same quality some where closer to Vivo City/ Alexandra road! I wish the team more luck and success, and yes - I wont do justice if I don't request for a little competitive pricing model. If someone can taste parupu usilis before getting it packed for delivery - it will also be good. somesitmes seriya cook aaghala, this happened twice - but still a fav of mine ;-)"
Perfect showcase of good South Indian food,"Impressive presentation, friendly crew, tasty well made food and choice of dishes for a few South Indian states Non alcoholic drinks could be priced a little Low. Would be great to have coffee post dinner"
Simply not good,Very average food and service. A couple of dishes were inedible while the others were just ok. The waiting staff didn’t care that 2 plates were left almost untouched. The place decor is nice.
Great food. Brilliant stories,"Not only is the food exceptional, its the service that stands out. The staff interacts, explains and is truly passionate about the food and the mission. Definitely a must visit when in singapore. And did i forget to mention the amazing cocktails !!!"
Indian Restaurant for Non Indians,Courteous staff and different cocktail menu. Pretty pricey and very limited options. Honestly after paying so much we felt hungry. The portions were less and nothing different to order.
"Surprise birthday dinner, at a hidden gem around where I stay","This place is simply excellent! service was friendly and warm, atmosphere was relaxed and, ambiance was relaxing. I am genuinely impressed, very different from the normal Indian eaters that one is used too.

The food isn't heavy and too filling hence it is a good place to bring friends to, for dinner or supper and have conversations.

They also have a bar behind the restaurant, you could go there for drinks too.
Their drinks are unique too. I personally had the THENGA BAANAM
MILLET PIDI KOZHUKATTAI was quite a favourite especially when mixed with the 3 different dips.

10/10 would recommend"
Excellent experience,Had an amazing time at Podi & Poriyal. The 'sharing portions' suggestion was a great tip by Kiran. They also had a 'guess the fruit/vegetable' game that made the outing more interesting. We always have a good time when we visit the restaurant!
A meal with a difference,"A dinner in an ""excellent"" atmosphere with ""excellent"" advice on what to eat. Again an ""excellent"" way to keep the diners engaged with ""excellent"" conversation about the dishes served.
It was sheer bliss with two good hours of fantastic food, even though we are not from the part of world where the food comes from - Thank you Podi & Poriyal"
Very yummy food,"Excellent food, cocktails, mocktails and service. 4 of us went for dinner. It was a very good dining experience."
"Nice vibe, clean, fun bite sized food","Nice vibe, clean, fun bite sized food good for sharing. Nice way to spend an evening with friends or a loved one."
"Good home style food, but very slow service","The restaurant offers unlimited thali only.
Food is simple and tasty. It is typical home fare.
However the service is extremely slow, which takes away immensely from the overall experience.
We dined here on Sunday for lunch at noon.
We had to wait for around 10 minutes for rice refills (requested once per adult), while the dal/ vegetable refills took even longer and required several reminders to 3 different people, before we got it.
There were 4 people serving the 10+ tables which were occupied. This seemed fairly manageable at a glance, so we could not fathom the reason for such extreme delays in service.
Given this, we would not look to return soon, even though the food was good comfort food, albeit on the steeper end of the price scale."
South Indian vegetarian,"If you are looking for some incredible South Indian home style food served with a twist, look no further. Love the incredible variety and their ever changing menus.. the surprise packet has to be the podis and the pickle.. had tomato powder and lemon leaf power today... that I asked for the podis 3 times and they gave it to me gleefully says it all! Love their set lunches"
One of the best vegetarian restaurant in SG,"Fabulous South Indian food, Great service. Highly recommended. Special thanks to Mr. Srikiran Ragavan."
Podi & Poriyal lunch,Been there a few times. Food quality is superior. Simple and authentic tasting. Love the ambience...transports me to Chennai. Very creative cocktails.
Food is good but service is bad,"The food has an interesting twist on Indian spices and has a homemade taste. Waiters are friendly but the service is terrible. you have to call multiple times to make a reservation (because they have limited seating) and would possibly only be able to make a booking weeks in advance. A challenge is that the team hardly answers the phone so its difficult to get through.

This is such a pity because the food is actually quite nice!"
"Home Recipes, warm and outstanding service !","Very good food, home recipes, fresh ingredients with outstanding service ! The staff made us feel as if we had come for dinner at a dear friend’s house instead of a restaurant !"
An amazing find,"Fabulous food, great cocktails with a South Indian twist and friendly service. Would highly recommend"
Authentic tasty south indian food!,"The welcome drink (panagam), the various podi (coconut and jackfruit), as well as each item on the thali set lunch was exceptionally good. They have some interesting cocktails - must try! The filter coffee deserves a special mention. The staff was very warm and friendly. Highly recommend the place!"
A disappointing afternoon Meal,"The ambiance, decor and the well pitched menu drums up one's expectations; unfortunately the experience leaves one feeling cheated -
We were among the first to walk in for the noon booking. Once the place is full, the noise leaves you wondering, why the hype.The restaurant needs some curtains and adjustments to ensure that the noise level is contained.This was only the beginning, more follows when the food arrives -
1. The portions were small. Wonder if we came in to taste the food, or have a lunch
2. The food was 'cold"", mind you, we were the first to be served. Imagine the plight of the others
who followed at the second booking at 1;30.
3. The sambar bland (god know if the spices were 'shown' to the sambar (like neivadhyam), or was it
really added to it.
4. The Rasam which should be served 'hot' like a soup, was at room temperature
The saving grace was the ""PODI'S"". As far as the Kootu a& Poriyal, there was nothing great to write home about.
The lunch which used to be served at the Old Komala Vilas, years back, on a plain Plantain leaf for SGD 5.00 (those days, do not know what it cost's now), was far, far better. I came out longing for the ""Old Komalas meals"", when there were very few alternatives in Singapore.
The experience and the food was definitely not worth the SGD 28 ++ that is charged.
Well, one learns, not to get carried away. Happy that it kindled the thought of the""Old Komalas"" - any I will not be surprised if I go back to try it again."
Food too bland and overpriced,"A friend of mine loves this place. Hence I wanted to try it out. I found food too bland, choice of menu very limited and $28++ for a set meal in Serangoon is way too over priced. For south indian set meal my comparison is with evergreen Komala vilas. For $11, they offer more variety and food is really tasty. For another comparison of how pricey is P&P, Shahi Maharani in Raffles City offers three starters, three non-veg and vegetable choices and three desserts for $31."
Most authentic South Indian meals in Singapore!,"A great place for those missing South Indian food to get a taste of home, as well as to introduce others to South Indian food. Pricey, but a good treat once in a while! Don’t sleep on their cocktails too."
Loved it!,Everything on the Thali was excellent. Food was very fresh. The staff were really warm. Will be coming more often.
Satisfying vegetarian meal,"Enjoyed the thali lunch! Brought home the ginger pickle and Jackfruit podi that is being sold now, which absolutely delicious."
Good ambience and decor but EXTREMELY over priced.,Good ambience and decor. Service was mostly prompt and courteous. Food was alright but EXTREMELY over priced. This food maybe in a restaurant in a hotel and in a fancier location could have demanded a higher price but with none of that the bill just leaves you gobsmacked!
Great vegetarian food,"Great space, great service and delicious food. I had the Chef’s Platter for lunch. Slightly pricey for vegetarian food, but it’s all-you-can-eat so go hungry!"
Delicious South Indian tapas & cocktails to die for,"One of the best places for South Indian tapas and amazing range of cocktails. The place is founded on the principle of supporting charity / social causes- high end boutique restaurant, with a very unique menu of tapas and cocktails. Very well trained and hospitable staff, who explain the minute details of the food preparation."
Baskaran,my personal opinion is to improve service and food quality. Honestly it is not really worth for money
Best in Little India,"Fabulous food and wonderful attentive service from our hosts who guided us through the food and cocktail menu. We ate most of the menu items and they were absolutely delicious! We came with friends for dinner and definitely coming back for the thali lunch. One of the best meals we have had in Little India, and all veg!"
A lot of positive feedback,"A lot of positive feedback from friends made me make my first maiden trip .

What I liked was
1. Staff was welcoming and friendly
2. Very nice and comfortable ambience
3. Very tasty podis
4. Awesome desert

What I did not understand and this can be very personal is the value for money quotient . Am happy to pay premium prices but the quality of the food and thali was simply average . This made me personally feel the food was overpriced. Also would have been good to have piping hot food and the sambhar and rasam were lukewarm."
"Great food, very well priced too!","Really enjoyed the food. Very simple, yet delicious! Loved the assortment and variety of everything!"
One of the best South Indian Restaurants in Singapore !,Visiting Podi and Poriyal for the 2nd time. Very nice in all aspects. The food was very easy to digest and quite comfortable to my stomach. This is especially important to me with my age.
Delivery at home,"Great taste and lovely food. Enjoyed it thoroughly, delivery at home. If some one likes authentic south indian food, good one, try chef's plate it's really good!"
"excellent service, hygiene and food!","The restaurant is being very careful in phased reopening to protect the safety of staff and patrons. We appreciate how punctually they honor their two lunch seatings, being sure to empty, clean & sanitize the restaurant in between seatings. Staff were welcoming and knowledgeable, politely but firmly enforcing SafeEntry, social distancing, temperature screening and appropriate mask wearing. The food was absolutely spot on with every dish having the expert flavors of South India. Surprisingly food arrived quickly as well, which is quite a feat for the kitchen given that the entire restaurant is seated at once. We will absolutely be back. Thank you!"
Exorbitant price with just 1 spark of brilliance in food,"First let us talk about the positives:

Ambience - 4.5/5
Payasam (dessert) - 5/5
Sambar (dish) - 4/5

The restaurant has a lovely traditional interior and offer a Thali with Rice, Sambar, Rasam, 2 Vegetables, Yogurt, 1 Medu Vada and Payasam. The dessert being the sole dish that reflects brilliance.

The staff are friendly and the service good.

But thats where it ends.

Prices - 1/5 At SGD 28++ for a Thali, a South Indian meal for 2 costs an exorbitant SGD 85 with a soft drink and coffee. To top it, they want you to pay extra for an extra medu vada or a bowl of payasam!. This to me was shocking. Mind you, they give you just 1 vada and a small bowl of payasam.

Other dishes eg. vegetables, Rasam - 3/5. Under the pretext of being home kind of cooking, I found the vegetables to be quite ordinary in taste.

Variety - 2/5 there are 2 vegetables and yogurt

Overall, good experience of ambience however the value for money is low enough given Ok-ish food, for me to decide that one visit was good enough. Prefer MTR any day!"
Treasure for culinary explorers,"We serendipitously stumbled on Podi & Poriyal and it made a lasting impression. Incredibly warm welcome followed by friendly introduction to the menu. While the range of foods and drinks was very limited, it was more than compensated by quality of each item. The food had a really authentic home-cooked feeling to it and at first sight we wouldn’t have known how to eat them! However this was an essential part of the charming experience and we were quickly introduced to each delicious food and shown how to eat them according to proper traditions. If you’re looking for a wide range of mostly familiar foods, this is not the place for you. But if you’re looking for a culinary adventure with new experiences, definitely worth a stop!"
Exceptional food and service.,"Exceptional food and service.
Very carefully curated authentic Indian ingredients with new amazing flavors for me.
The service is great, they really take care of every detail and they serve quite fast given the complexity of the dishes.

They also have a bar with tasty cocktails and again, new amazing flavors

Loved it!"
2 thumbs up : ),"My 2nd visit. Service and food were superb. Had idly, vadai and filter coffee. Can't wait to try their dinner menu : )"
Traditional South Indian Vegetarian Food,"Went there with my husband & sons on Father's Day. All of us truly enjoyed the thali set meal which had a authentic homely taste. The staff who attended to us was friendly & courteous & she also explained a bit about the dishes that was served. Their vadai was the highlight, it was very tasty. Lastly we had a cup of masala tea which was just right to end the meal. Overall it was a good experience even though the price was a bit expensive."
Disappointed,"We had heard a lot about this restaurant and went with high expectations. While the ambiance is nice and the staff helpful, the food is not up to the mark. It was pretty tasteless except for the lentil dosas they had as special that day. We ordered most of the menu which is limited to about 10-12 dishes. There was nothing green in the menu and much of it is fried. At a third of the price, perhaps it would be acceptable but not at 150 SGD for 4 people."
At home,Thoroughly enjoyed the meal as it felt like eating at home. Ambience was good and staff were friendly.
Healthy and fresh for a change,The place was a refreshing change in little India. The hosts explained their concept very well with a smile. We had a set lunch. Every item was of high quality. Taste was ok. You feel light and satisfied thereafter. They could do with a little bit more spicy. Will certainly visit again and recommend to others.
Over Priced with below average food,25 sgd for a meal with very few options and insipid food..there many better sapaad options at 1/5 th price
"Sincere service, amazing food.","The staff were very polite, sincere and engaging. They constantly checked on us and explained the food to us. It was more than we expected, it was a complete treat for 2 chinese who did not know much about Indian food. I will go back again."
Not worth the price,"The food was very average. Very disappointing for the price I paid ($37)! I didn't know that the Chef's plate did not include a drink. It's only after I paid that I realised it was $12 more for a drink! Well, okay, I should have checked. Even otherwise, there are very few items on the Chef's plate - 2 curries, sambhar, rasam, curd and kheer - for a whopping SGD 25. And that too, for quality that wasn't great.

Whether it is truly authentic South Indian food (as it is promoted to be), I wouldn't once again rate it highly. The potato curry had deep fried diced potatoes - not authentic at all. The decor and ambience are good but these will not make up for the very average food that was served on the day I went."
Delicious food and very cozy ambience,The food was fantastic! Love the attention the serve gave to us in explaining the story behind the restaurant and the food. And we absolutely love the ambience and decor too! will definitely be back!
South Indian Homely food,"South Indian food at its best. We had a delicious meal of Vada, Vathalkuzambu, Rasam and 2 veggies. Carrot payasam is absolutely finger licking good."
Authentic Veg South Indian (Tamil) food in Singapore,Podi & Poriyal is one of the authentic veg South Indian restaurants in Singapore. They started last year and are now one of the popular joints for us. We visit this restaurant frequently for lunch with work colleagues on weekdays or family on weekend. Now they've started dinner service with new menu. We'll try that soon. I highly recommend this restaurant.
Homely ambience,Simple and tasty South Indian food. The staff were very courteous and explained how the restaurant was started. The restaurant had a homely ambience and our family had a great experience overall. A tad bit expensive at $25 per meal.
Awesome lunch,We had a homely healthy lunch . My first visit was with my friend and then I took my whole family to enjoy the food
South indian food,Food is good but extremely expensive. 25 sgd for a meal is not worth it because we are talking about vegetarian south india meal and definitely not worth the money even though how much organic it may be..
High End Quality South Indian Meal,"Been here for lunch as I loved the name & ambience.
The owners are good host & they personally take care of serving you & making sure you Know what you been eating .

I would say it is one of the finest South Indian meal I have tasted with lot of natural & Authentic Flavours.
Singapore is full of South Indian food but this is if Special with focus on quality ingredients & healthy recipes.

Would try to visit them soon again .

Thank you"
Delightful experience,"This was my 4th visit here since the opening of P&P, the place has very nice vibes,lovely ambience,homely food,awesome service.If you miss your mom and her South Indian dishes,head staring to Podi & Poriyal"
Delicious South Indian Vegetarian food.,"Lovely restaurant just north of the hustle and bustle of the main Serangoon eateries. The chefs plate was delicious, service was attentive and price reasonable for the fresh ingredients served. Authentic South Indian at its finest."
i would lunch here every day if i could,"what a wonderful discovery. everything about podi and poriyal is delightful. we had the set meal—a thaali with an assortment of south indian vegetarian dishes, yoghurt, dessert. the selection changes every day (every day meaning on each of the five days that the restaurant is open for lunch). the fixings were yummy and (for a non-south indian maybe) exotic—curry leaf powder and another powder (forgotten what but equally exotic), gingelly oil and ghee, amla pickle. even the fixings change periodically. the thaali comes with a choice of rice or millet or both if you prefer. the decor is lovely - the walls a deep, welcoming yellow and brass utensils hung on one wall. service was impeccable and podi and poriyal certainly lives up to the promise on its website of offering a fine curated culinary experience. it is only open for lunch and only wednesday to sunday. i will certainly return to sample future delights."
Great Food! The authentic experience!,"Enjoyed the food and the service and P & P! If you dont make a reservation and walk-in, you will not get a place. Get there hungry!"
Food for the senses,"Excellent ambience, good food presentation and best of all the preparation was kept simple but was flavorful and satisfying. Please try the thali with Millet option for low carb, healthy vegetarian meal. Do try the ghee, podi mixed with the millet or rice. Divine."
Unique Restaurant Serving Traditional Vegetarian Tamil Food,"We had a very satisfying experience at P&P which is located slightly further past Joy Alukkas and Mustafa on Serangoon Road. The main stay is their set meal although they serve a few ala carte dishes such as pongal, vadai and idli. The menu changes every day so don't forget to check the website.

The food was vegetarian, very authentic, felt that it had been made home style with a lot of care. Unlike some of the other places, food was very light yet filling. We also got second and third servings of our favourite dishes.

The ambiance was fantastic and everyone at P&P was very courteous, polished and proficient. We got a brief history of the place and the founder right at the outset which was very interesting.

Do take note that this is a lunch only restaurant which is open 5 days a week. Please check their website and don't forget to pre-book your table before setting off..."
