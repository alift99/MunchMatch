CNY Luncheon,"The reservation for 8 paxs were made very early, so we got a VIP room. There was a waitress, Nicole assigned to our room. She was very attentive and meticulous in her job. Food at Jumbo Seafood were very good especially the Signature Chillies Crab and Sesame Sauce Prawn.
Thumbs up for the excellent service and high quality food"
Highly recommended,Came here on the 2nd day of the Lunar New Year without much expectations. Everything turned out massively well. Food was of high standards and service was wonderful. Thank you!
Best food for wowing guests from abroad!,Best food for wowing guests from abroad! Chili crab is excellent as always. A bit pricey but worth it.
Poor,Restaurant was grubby and service non existent or surly. No smiles or welcome from staff. Food was disappointing. Chilli crab tasted overly sweet as if it was just crab with ketchup. All food was greasy. An extremely unimpressive performance.
Jumbo? Rather mini! 😰,"The Jumbo, Dempsey Experience! And it wasn’t good more like Mini!

Service amazingly slow! From sitting down to first dish, 40 minutes! Excuse: sorry sir we have big party!

Hey if you can’t handle, then don’t take reservations! Even some guests despite seeing the situation, still take 15-20 minutes to choose! Kiasu at its very worst!

Nicole stood out for her service, observant, and responsive! A star!

Meanwhile food as fairly ok only, really felt let down a bit! We didn’t have too many dishes, and started off with a long time favourite of ours, Crisp Fried Baby Squid, frying ok, crispy yes, but tasted weird, my buddy thought squid not fresh, and seasoning not as per original famous of Ref House!

The Baby Kailan however was perfectly cooked and we enjoyed it, just the right amount of garlic!

Steamed prawns, surprisingly large, were good, but you can’t really do much wrong there! The accompanying dark soy with Chili kinda didn’t fit, needed to ask for red Chili sauce!

The Tofu with seafood was just ok, a tad meagre on seafood & prawns over cooked!

But the big let down was ultimately the Black Pepper Crab, too dry, not enough Pepper Flavour, so we were disappointed! Red House does a much better job at that!

Overall not a great experience, and if I was asked to go back, I doubt I would, sad to say!

Seafood not so fresh this time. Some with typical smell.,Food not very fresh compared to before. The crab is good but the soup and shrimp ones were smelly and non-fresh considered by my friends
3.5 stars type rating,"Food and ambience (safe for the restrooms cleanliness) were good, but the service could have been better - requested pretty early on (through Chope) for indoor dining for celebration of a special occasion but assigned outdoors seating. Thankfully it didn’t rain and the weather was good, so we ended up not minding the outdoors seating. Service was not all that friendly though the waitresses were hardworking. Prices used to be more value for money for Jumbo, not sure if it is an industry wide problem."
We ate perfect Singapore Chille (mud) Crab,"We had a perfect dinner of mud crab in Singapore Chilli crab sauce (S$118.80 for 1.1 kg). The sauce was velvety, spicy- but not too spicy, thick and copious. The crab was perfectly cooked and delicious to the last morsel. With our crab, we had rice (S$1.50) and the asparagus in garlic (S$20). It was our favorite thick and crunchy asparagus; very tasty. Our server was attentive and very nice. We chatted with him and we enjoyed it. The outdoor patio area was great for us and the hostess found an area without a ceiling fan to bother us. For dessert, we had the Cheng Tang hot double boiled peach resin (S$6). With our meal, we drank Pu Er tea (S$3). We even bought some Chille Crab Paste (S$8.60) to take home. We spent S $ 185.61/US $141.60 and were very happy."
Superb location & food quality,"Missed the original seaside location of Jumbo Seafood but the raw forested location of Dempsey Hill made up for it. Coupled with excellent food quality in their chili crabs, cereal prawns, fresh fish and vegetables."
Enjoyed our New Year's Lunch at Jumbo!!!,Great food! Great service! Great atmosphere! Located in a very peaceful community. My family really enjoyed!
Fresh and tasty seafood dish but a little far from public transportation.,"The food is too sweet for me, but the overall taste look okay with the good portion.
I highly recommend the cereal shrimp, this is the best dish I ever tried at here.

Anyway the rest look too normal to me when compared with the price.
The parking is available but for the public transportation,you need to walk up to the hill around 400 meters."
WAS MUCH BETTER AND MORE POLITE,"Not friendly, quite uncaring, a bit rude behaviour and poorly served food. Not as good as I remember this restaurant."
Superb food and service,"Jumbo never fails to please, and how! Great food: no need to list, everything I've had over the past 15 years has been outstanding."
Must visit,Fantastic restaurant with great menu but really the best thing to have is the black pepper crab. It was so good we went back 2 nights in a row! It's a short taxi ride away from the main hotels but worth the 15 minutes.
Review,Attentive service. Good quality food and nice seats in the small side annex so perfect for us as a couple
Great place to try Singapore Chili Crab,"The atmosphere was cozy, the servers are all friendly, and the dishes excellent. Definitely going back again"
Disappointing hısting this time,"We have made the reservation 2 weeks in advance as I wanted to reserve an outdoor comfortable seating for my elderly parents. When we arrived they didnt have the table and the welcoming staff has led us to a small square table for 2 and put a 3rd chair aside to squeeze us to that small table. As I didnt accept we have been redirected to the back part outoors again a very last table next to cutlery board. Again I have not accepted indicating that I have made my res well şn advance and want my parents to have anice dinner and after so many talks we have been seated at a huge table that time, where it was impossible to dine comfortably for the elderly. We lost 10-15 min waiting for this final seating. And on top we were warned that still the 1,5 hrs limit is there and we have to leave by 8pm! I said OK no problem.
In short, very disrespectful, unprofessional attitude and I am asking: what is then the meaning of a reservation with special note??
My last time in that restaurant although the food is good and usually the waiters are really good. But welcoming staff is a disaster."
"Good food, terrible service","Food was good (had chilli crab, mud crab). The service was at the level of a bad diner in the US. It also had the feel of the diner service."
Room for improvement,"We had a delicious lunch. The food was good though the portion for the first few dishes of our set menu for 6 pax was rather small. The service can be improved. I had to ask for the plates to be changed during the course of the dinner. Also waitress servicing the food nearly dripped the soup on the clothes of my wife that was dripping from the ladle as the waitress turned around to talk to one colleague. The phone reservation using their given number was bad. I made a reservation on the phone at 8.45pm the day before my lunch indicating the date, time and no of pax. There was an auto reply asking me how they could help me. I repeated my message in my reply. Didn't hear from them until after the lunch the next day at 3.36pm. Their message was ""23 Nov?"". Anyway, i took to making my reservation on Chope which was received by the restaurant."
Very small portions,Very small portions for all dishes. Getting smaller and smaller. Very slow service- poor attitude of most staff. Like they hate to work there. Very disappointing.
Black-Pepper Crab Tasting,"All round good to very good, worthy of return and recommendation to others. Wine corkage at $30 high, should drop to half."
Bad Experience,"Upon reservation, I wasn't informed that I've to return the table after 90mins. Had I been informed I definitely would not have confirmed my reservation. It was a business dinner. We're planning for several upcoming events & we thought of seafood & most especially Jumbo after recommendation. First disappointment was when we arrived at the restaurant, it was then that we were informed we've to finish our dinner in 90mins which was pretty much embarrassing. The food came speedily one dish after another giving us no time to appreciate the taste of it. The staff were not friendly & welcoming at all. They were extremely super ""EFFICIENT"" in clearing our utensils, brushing us through dinner indicating we've to gallop our food real fast. How would one enjoy seafood dinner in this manner????? The restaurant might want to consider letting patrons be aware upon reservation that dining time is strictly 90mins. For us i guess JUMBO will not be in the list for our future dining be it business or family."
Rubbish service,"I have been a big jumbo fan for last ten years my fav place to go for comfort food .
Last night I was disappointed with the service, there was a gap of forty minutes in the dishes served which ruined our meal .
Thanks had ordered five dishes. By the time my main three dishes arrived I had lost the appetite during the waitin.
The severs were asking my 13year old if she wanted to order another coke, if would want my kid to order them I would place it ."
Bit disappointing,Booked through the website but at the restaurant was told there is a time slot of 90 minutes. And if you spend more than S$ 200 for two you would like to take it relaxt.
Chilli crab delight,We had the world famous chilli crab w man tou.. and excellent as usual n the beef steak was out of this world though prices increased quite dramatically
That one reliable place you can bring your family and kids,"Brought my family of 8 (2 kids), they gave us the VIP room without requesting and we were so thankful as it rained later. Service was 100%, the kind server even told us to watch the kids when they ate the fish and avoid the bones. Service was super attentive and my family was well taken care of. I would say everyone went the extra mile and we felt it was a great experience, which is rare these days."
Sept 24/22,Food was delicious and services was excellent. Atmosphere was cozy. Is a great night we enjoyed and we have fun.
Lunch with US visitor,"The service of the waiter hat served us have room for improvement. I bought visitors to have lunch there in VIP room and would expect to have basic service standard, change of plate maybe after 2 dishes, top-up of drink and most importantly a face showing he is happy to serve us, I don't see that nor feel it. That was disappointing."
Reservation time,I had a reservation at 8am but had to wait 20 minutes for a table to be available. We want our appointment times to be punctual.　We demand improvements. This made the start of dinner very late.
Jumbo seafood Dempsey,Jumbo seafood @ Dempsey Hill is always my family the go to place for chili crabs. Good service as usual and best thing is free parking at Dempsey hill.
Over price average resturant,"Generally speaking, the food was average and have lost the ""wow"" factor as compared to the past. Do not get me wrong the seafood is fresh and of good quality. However, there is nothing on the menu that one could not get elsewhere in another similar restaurant. Very likely because of being highly commercialized. Service is a bit lacking and probably because they have a hard time looking for quality service personnel post COVID."
A place to bring your foreign friends,"I am going to compare this with my family’s gold standard, which is Long Beach Dempsey - so you will only appreciate my review if you also have been to and/or like Long Beach Dempsey. We came here to try because Long Beach did not have a table for twelve people.

I don’t think there is much to say about the ambience, tables, service - these are comparable. Food wise, i like the mini scallops in yam baskets - for one person each - they look so adorable on a large plate. There’s also a delectable prawn with mango and pomelo salad (more prawn than vegetables). These are stuff I didn’t see in Long Beach. The highlights of the evening for me, apart from these appetizers, were firstly the steamed lobster on tang Hoon in gravy - It was superbly done and the sauce was rich. However, they failed to provide the appropriate utensils for us to pluck the tang Hoon from the serving plates; and secondly the dessert of steamed yam with pumpkin and ginkgo - traditional but extremely delicious. You know it’s that good when you can still happily slurp this after a heavy dinner!!

Now, you must be wondering about the crabs. OK, the chilli crab is inferior to Long Beach in the gravy department. For the longest time ever, jumbo has relied on its tired formula of augmenting chilli sauce mixed with some black bean or something, while Long Beach essentially gives its eggy spicy sauce a super-boost of sorts. The latter packs greater oomph. Secondly, the white pepper crab of jumbo is powerful, and i think it’s a viable alternative to Long Beach black pepper crab. Steam crab is similar. Buns are about the same.

NB. Jumbo Dempsey is superior to Jumbo Ion, and Long Beach Dempsey is superior to Long Beach IMM. Same same, but not same same."
Rude Attitude,"Had diner with my family reservation at 5:30pm. The confirmation mail clearly said that we need to return table at 7:30. When we arrived the restaurant reception lady told us that end time us 7:30. But near 7pm , during dinner floor lady suddenly come to us and insist that we have to return table by 7pm. We were very surprised and explained her as above but she did NOT accept and push us to get out again.Terrible."
Dining at Jumbo Dempsey,"The Chilli crab and pepper crab is a must eat, and both my oversea guests are in praise. They like the chilli paste with the deep fried bun. The serving time was good just after we finished each dish, and they was very minimum delay. The staffs was accomodating and helpful to our requests."
Relatively pricey,"When you bring a friend from overseas here, you want to try the signature dishes such as chili crab. Unfortunately, there was only a minimum 1kg crab available. It was too big for the 2 of us, and we wanted to try other dishes also. So the bill came up to a high amount for just 2 of us, and we had quite a lot of food leftover. Jumbo should think about how to better cater to small groups also."
Dinner at Jumbo (Dempsey Hill),The quality of food is good and place is clean. Good for people who drive to enjoy the free parking. I couldn't get a booking at ION so no choice but to change to Dempsey. Didn't regret the choice. I would like Jumbo to revise their membership to be more attractive like having discount vouchers for us to buy and use.
Some service/food great but overpriced and lacked some basics.,"One of the waiters Judy Ong, hope I got that right, was amazing! So kind and helpful. Food was yum but the price was huge for what you get. Asked for a small chili crab since it was just for one lady. They delivered a 1KG. We questioned this on the receipt before it came, however ended up paying over $110SGD! Outrageous! It was nice but she couldn't finish it and we paid double what we should have. Ordered wine but the white wine came warm ... yuck! Their solution was an ice bucket but it would take 30 mins to chill in there and you only get a certain time before they need the table back. In the end had to order red wine but it was quite the process. They just couldn't understand that in no way should white wine be served warm. That we shouldn't have to wait 30 mins and then only have a short time to finish a whole bottle. Overall the food was yum, some good service mixed with some lack of understanding and overpriced."
Excellent,Managed to make a reservation at the last minute and they were able to fit us in. Food was excellent and so was the service.
Food,"Nice and clean place, Good service. The promotion for lobster was good. We enjoyed baked cheese lobster very much!"
Delicious,All the dishes we ordered were delicious and as good as I remember Jumbo to be. They were also very kind to change the wrong salted egg prawns that were served to the cereal prawns that we had ordered. Staff were nice and attentive.
Decent food with okayish service,"Booked the sole private room for 7 of my clients on 14 Jul (Thurs) evening.

Booking: Very smooth, I called earlier to confirm a room. No deposit needed, which is great as my company does not allow claiming of deposits, which unfortunately more restaurants are doing so since COVID period. The private room is quite small, with a glass door that you can see the other guests eating at main dining hall and vice versa (Did not give us a sense of privacy). Thank god the restaurant allowed my team to bring in a projector & white screen as we needed to do a presentation.

Food: Ordered the 10 pax set meal C10 at $998++ which was ALOT of food, so much that my clients each could take away boxes of food to feed their families (Thank you to the staff for allowing this & not just waste the food!). Rest assured that food portions are generous, I noticed several tables who had to takeaway the remaining food too. This set menu consisted of Chilled Shredded Roast Duck Salad, Scallop Wrapped in Yam Ring, Seafood Bacon Roll Tossed with Salad Cream, Fish Maw Soup with Cordyceps Flowers and Conpoy, Live Boston Lobster Braised with Superior Stock, Live 'Soon Hock' (Marble Goby) Steamed with Soya Sauce, Mocha Pork Ribs, Award-Winning Chilli Crab with Fried 'Man Tou', 'Hokkien' Noodles with Seafood and Mango Sago Pomelo as desserts. Food was not overly complicated, with great taste for each dish. Seafood was fresh and the crabs & lobster meat were easily removed from the shells, making it a easy experience.

Service: I suspect they are short-staffed as service was notably slow after the renovations. Firstly, even though I told them 15mins earlier to serve the food 15mins later, the food was only served 30mins later. Secondly, my clients order aloe vera drinks but they took 10mins each to be served, and my clients were not too happy about it. At least the servers helped us portion to 10 bowls for certain dishes and continuously poured tea for my clients.

Location: Just drive in sua. Thank god the restaurant is right smack in the middle of Dempsey Hill, you can't miss it. Free parking yay! In fact car enthusiasts come here on certain nights to show off their cars. It just recently reopened after renovations and thank god the appearance inside looks more modern and clean.

Will probably be back with my clients, but likely not in private rooms (Can't keep bringing the same clients to the same restaurant ya)"
Delicious,"The food is delicious and seafood is fresh, crabs are huge. Will definitely come back for another round of feasting."
Excellent quality but initially overcharged for weight of the crabs,The black pepper crabs are amongst the best we have had in Singapore. We were overcharged however for the actual weight of the crabs. We had to complain in order to have the bill reduced so this was rather disappointing and something to be aware of.
1.5 Kgs crab was not really fresh,"We ordered Jumbo's Signature Chilli Crab with a 1.5kg crab under the impression that the bigger crab is better n the meat much fresher than those under 1kg. Unfortunately, the 1.5Kg was not really good and fresh up to our expectation n requirement. Quite disappointed."
Average,"Came here to celebrate father’s day dinner. I believe they are under staffed as service was disappointing. While serving the chilli crab, they didnt serve gloves, bibs and crab tools. Ordered desert before the main dish came and surprisingly, the desert was served even before the noodles were served. This is not what i expected for the price paid. Overall a disappointing experience."
Jumbo dinner review,Ordered Chilli crab w mantou Drunken Prawn Sotong Youtiao Special mention to the award willing chilli crab. Dotter chomp down more crab than she ever did despite the dish being spicy.
A must have meal in Singapore. Chilli crab at Jumbo,"First time at Jumbo in Dempsey hill (first time to Dempsey hill). Been to Jumbo and eastcoast and clarke quay over the years.

Of course this was the same quality as I've had from the others. The great debate between pepper or chilli crab goes on. We prefer chilli crab.

But the must have with the crab is not the buns, although we had them of course, BUT the seafood fried rice. The perfect way to soak up all the chilli juice........."
A little on the sweet side.,Extremely helpful staff. Food was great except that the chilli crab was a little on the sweet side for my liking. Nevertheless we have enjoyed the experience.
No longer worth the price,"Mediocre, no longer the same good food Jumbo used to serve. The atmosphere (outdoor Dempsey) also needs a overhaul"
"Great food, good location",Fast and efficient service. Seafood was fresh and done well. Good proportion. Definitely recommended.
Farewell Lunch for 20 Years Service Colleague,"As always the team members are always serving with their best especially compliment Ms. Joanna Huang and Meng. Well done, good job and keep it up."
Our experiences at Jumbo Dempsey Hill,"We ordered the signature chillies crab with deep fried buns, mee goreng, boiled prawn, asparagus with scallops and etc. As always, the food and services are really good!"
It’s not just for the Chilli Crab!,It’s not just the Chilli Crabs that are excellent. The mocha pork ribs are awesome! Also enjoyed the orh nee.
Food was bad ... overcooked fish and lobster,"I have been there many times, but my last visit was shocking. We ordered lobster cooked two ways. Lobster was overcooked and rubbery. One of the dish was cooked with glass noodle and it was greasy. We ordered steam fish and it was tough! Inedible to me. I cook fish better at home. The restaurant was quiet for a Friday evening. So sad how the quality has deteriorated so badly. I gave feedback to the manager, only meek apology was offered."
Family dinner,"Booked a table for 5 on Chope, however was given an outdoor seating, granted that during the booking it did not allow me to choose either an indoor seating or an outdoor seating.

Order a couple of dishes which were honestly not great. We ordered the Donut with seafood paste, Beef fillet, broccoli with scallops, chilli crab, fried fish in soy sauce, and Hong Kong noodles. Jumbo is famous for the chilli crab but it was nothing short of a disappointment, the chilil sauce was blend and taste like cheap ketchup. Albeit the crab was really fresh and sweet. The other items were comparable to coffeeshop tze char food with a heavy price tag.

Jumbo used to be a go to place for chilli crabs but I guess not anymore."
Food delivered out of order.,"The waitress who served is was top notch! Patient and very helpful. But the food we ordered arrived so randomly ie tofu first, followed by kangkong and then nothing else for a while. I said it should come with the fried rice which came altogether with the chilli crab as well! Wish there was more sense in their food service order. Besides that it was all very delicious. It would also have been nice if they changed the messy tablecloth when they cleared the dishes like some restaurants do, before the dessert."
Super unhygience good prepration.,"It almost gave my whole family food poisoning.

Nephew found a almost 9cm cligwrap insides in the award winning chillie crab while eating. He vomited througout the nights and few days after that.
Feedback to Jumbo, Jumbo took back the dish, a week later, they called to confirm cling wrap has dropped into the dish while cooking, but do not know how had that happened.

Jumbo advised they wont be giving a full fund. After weeks of discussion, they increased their settlement from $200 to $300 dinning voucher plus refund of one chillii crab."
2021 NYE's dinner at Jumbo Dempsey,"My family and I have a tradition of eating at Jumbo at Dempsey Hill the past few years. That night, only the Dungeness crab were available and we ordered the black pepper flavor. It was disappointing as we found it rather bland and not as tasty or spicy as before. The baby squids were tasty although the portion was on the small side for the price charged. Our favorite dish of the night was the Coffee Pork Ribs which were succulent, tasty and delicious. Sadly, the Scallops w Yam was a huge disappointment. The scallop tasted like fake meat, chewy and tasteless. On the plus side, the service was very good. Our waitress, Judy, was very attentive and accommodating, responding to our requests very quickly and always with a big smile."
Better locations elsewhere,"We got outdoor seating though we requested indoor, it was rainy that day so a bit damp and moist. The food was expensive but the service was good. Food taste overall not bad though, consistent across JUMBOs but just didn’t like the location."
Jumbo Seafood Dempsey has not disappointed so far,"This is my 4th visit to Jumbo Seafood at Dempsey Hill and it has not disappointed us so far. Seafood has always been fresh and sweet. Definitely must eat the Australian lobster and Mud Crab. The meat for the lobster was sweet and has that 'crunchy' bite to it which tells me the lobster is really fresh. Lobster was huge. Think it was close to 2kg which was enough for 4 adults. They are having a 50% discount promotion now so it was worth the price. They also have a 30% discount for their live crabs now so we choose the Mud Crab cooked in Jumbo's famous chili gravy. Very shiok to eat the gravy with a warm mantou. The pincers on our crab were super big and the meat was really juicy and sweet. Don't forget to try their stir fried broccoli with scallops. One of their dishes I must always eat when I'm there. We also have the steamed Soon Hock(Marble Goby) which was really good and a very meaty fish also. The staff there were professional and service was good. Gérard, who I think is their manager, has always been very professional and service-oriented. Planning to visit the outlet again for a 2022 Chinese New Year meal."
Experience at Dempsey Hill JUMBO,"Food was good, service was good. There was a fly on the plate when I arrived, but once the waitress spotted it, she switched it out for a new one immediately without me even asking her to. Overall a great dining experience."
Strange that I could not book for 7pm when the restaurant was not full,"I tried at least 3 times over different days to book a table for 2 at 7 pm 3rd Oct but always unavailable,
However when my wife and I arrived at 7:15 pm (for 7:30 pm booking) the restaurant was far from full, presumably due to sudden imposition of 2-person rule."
Lovely dinner on a Thursday night!,"Think we chose the right dishes….scallops in yam nests…. Chicken with stuffed fish paste, green dragon vegetables, prawns in dried chilli noodles,…and the highlight got to be the chilli crab/mantou! Good promotional Sauvignon Blanc!"
A Wonderful Family Evening,"We had a good time bonding over dinner. Staff was attentive and polite. We tried steam for crab and it’s was fresh and delicious. Unfortunately, we couldn’t get a bigger one. Kitchen staff recommended us to separate the coconut source from the orni."
Average,"Not worth the money. Standard has really dropped. Tasteless chilli crab, mushrooms beancurn was average. Only good was the fried rice, fish and sambal Kang Kong which can be made from any restaurant."
Good service and food.,"I have always like Jumbo as it’s service and food have a certain standard. This time my husband and I went for its Australia lobster promo. We had the claypot lobster tang hoon. The lobster is about 800g, it was perfectly cooked. The flesh was juicy, meaty and so succulent! Worth every cent and calorie!"
Jumbo Seafood,Good food and nice ambience. Highly recommend to those who love to eat crabs and seafood. My family enjoyed our meal there. Thank you.
Best chilli crab in town,"I have been a loyal customer of jumbo for over 20 years, have never been disappointed, my go-to place for chilli crab."
Good service and food quality,"A little pricey side, but worth it as the seafood, especially the crab, is evidently very fresh. The staff is very accommodating and attentive to the needs of the customers."
Unhurried Lunch - good food and service,got the table in aircon area as requested. quiet and unhurried lunch as tables were well spaced out. Food was good and great service staff. thank you for keeping yr standards consistent.
Great Food..........Fast Service,Sat outside and the area was very cosy. I was worried that a windy/rainy day would spoil our meal but the outside are is well protected from both wind and rain. After initially ordering our food we didn't have to wait long for the service. I'm not a great fan of seafood but the quality was fantastic and I'll certainly be returning for more.
Great-tasting seafood - a befitting end to the weekend,"Good recommendation from the restaurant staff for a sumptuous seafood meal - try the clam sashimi, Australian lobster and fish maw soup. The best part was the soon hock fish - on the house - as part of members' special promotion :)"
Nice items but more expensive than expected,Items are pretty good but the value is not great as some of the items like the pork is more expensive than expected. Plus the dishes were more sweet than expected as well. Too sweet.
You can never go wrong when you go to Jumbo!,"Best seafoods in town! Service was as par as excellent as the food. Fresh air dining lets you feel relax. The vicinity was quiet and nice, far from the busy city streets of Singapore."
"Environment and weather hot, insufficient fan or aircon","Environment and weather hot, insufficient fan or aircon. Food so so only. Service is good. Atmosphere very bad."
Dining experience at jumbo,Overall it was wonderful except that it was really hot when only al fresco seating was available. My toodler could not stand the heat ! 😅
CNY lunch on 18th Feb at Jumbo seafood Demsey,Hi.. we were very pleased with the customer service during our lunch there recently. Will surely recommend friends and families to go there for gatherings. thank you
Mum birthday n cny reunion dinner,"Waiting tiime more than 40mins despite booking confirmation n arrived 15mins before actual booking time as advised but turned out elderly have to wait for 40mins outside with poor holding or waiting area!
Upon seated, ordered some plain waters for kids n elderly n yet didnt served tilll 3 reminders!
Pressed the service bell for food ordering n at least pressed for more than 10times n only came over to take orders after 15mins later."
Good food and service,Food was great - ordered the chilli crab and black pepper crab and salted egg prawns. Although staff was busy they were reachable and helped us top up tea every now and then- overall good service.
"Great food and service, as always","Had a great time enjoying the delicious food, a unanimous thumbs up from all of us. We will be back soon."
"Good Service, Food is Disappointing.","We ordered fried rice, vegetable dish and steamed crab with chinese wine (not the signature crab dishes because we have our little one with us), its quite disappointing actually as the meat was pretty bland, lacking the freshness and natural sea sweetness. Surprisingly, the Chinese wine (Hua Diao) doesn't complement the flavor of the crab. Fried rice was a let down too, lacks the wok hei. Service quality is good which aligns with their brand. Unfortunately not the food. Really not worth the value."
Quality of Food,"The quality of the food had gone down. I had always enjoyed my meals at Jumbo so it was bumper as it was a dinner with my family. Most of the food came cold so I don’t know where and how long it must have been sitting before it was served. The crab, beef and crispy squid were lukewarm and the taste was below expectations compared to what I have tasted in the past"
Always good for crabs & more,"The sea food was delicious as always. Jumbo does not disappoint. However, the service was lacking. We booked a table at 1 PM and were 10 mins early but had to wait till 1:15 PM to get the table, after the Manager intervened. Other than this, a very pleasant experience."
"Good foods ,good service","We loved Australian lobster and glass vermicelli braised with “ Sha Cha” sauce in Claypot, delicious dish. Chilli crab is famous"
Yummy fuss-free crab set meal,"The fuss-free crab with mantou was yummy. Recommended: deep fried baby squid and mocha pork rib, horfun (nice wok-hei)"
Excellent good and service,"Decided to have dinner with the family at Jumbo Seafood Dempsey outlet. The food we ordered was really good like the Malay style mee goreng, lobster salad and the other dishes we ordered. Service by Gerard Ooi, the staff attending to us was also very good and professional. We so happy with everything that we made another reservation for 2 weeks later."
Great Customized Service,I brought my wife to celebrate her birthday over lunch at JUMBO Seafood at Dempsey Hill. They adjusted the menu and suggested an alternative way to cook the JUMBO crab since my wife has low tolerance for spicy food. They also agreed to prepare a simple birthday bun with candles for my wife to blow. The kind staff also agreed to take our pictures :)
Lunch,Staff were friendly and helpful. Attended to us even though we were much earlier than our reservation time. Space in the restaurant was excellent. Food was served hot and it tastes great.
Very average black pepper crab,Service was fabulous as very friendly. My friend enjoyed her chilli crab dish. But the black pepper crab I had was very very average. I asked for more sauce as it was quite flavour-less and was told they don't give extra sauce (they do at Long Beach). Long Beach crab is far superior.
Chill! ✌🏻,"Great service and fantastic food! Had the lobster 2-way. Sashimi then followed by salt & pepper. Yummy! It was a little salty but very flavourful. However, I hope they will provide fresh wasabi instead of those from tubes. Gave the same feedback to the staff, let’s see."
Great place for chilli crab,"Excellent place to enjoy quality seafood at reasonable prices, especially chilli crab. The ambience was nice, service was efficient and welcoming."
"5 stars, undisputedly","Nov 2020. I had come here umpteen times for birthday dinners, i could not believe i had not written a review here.
I had to comment that Jumbo's reservation and rewards systems were organized. The restaurant was full but we had 0 wait time and we were whisked to our table despite being early. The eVouchers, J$ and transaction history were clearly listed with a fuss-free login to their rewards system.
We ordered a 1.7 kg mud crab, fried rice, mee-goreng and coffee pork ribs. I still thought Jumbo had the best chilli crabs in Singapore. The freshness of the crabs was given, the pincers were huge and packed with firm flesh.
The pork ribs were highly recommended. That smokey, bitter-sweet taste would overwhelm the palate first, then followed by the tender fatty meat fragrance around the soft bone. Heavenly.
The waiting staff were attentive and friendly. We were treated like royalties the moment we stepped in.
5 stars, undisputedly..."
My lunch experience at Jumbo,Overall the lunch meal set was good for the price paid . The appetiser was tasteful. But would be good if the crab has other optional choice as I am really not a chilli crab fan.
Jumbo at Dempsey,There currently a set lunch promotion till end of Dec. the foods was good and the atmosphere has something different compare to those usual restaurants in a mall
Lunch at jumbo,Ordered the set for 3/4 pax. Food was served promptly. Taste excellent. Every dish was top notch. Service was really good. Staff were very friendly and polite.
"Consistent in quality, never fails to disappoint!","There's a reason why Jumbo has been priced at a higher tier compared to the other seafood restaurants, and that is the consistent standard of the food, as well as the customer service.

Ordered a Chili Crab, Black Pepper Crab, Mocha Ribs and Sambal Kang Kong. As a person who prefers meat over veggies, I was decently surprised that the kang kong was the first dish that our group cleaned up!
Unlike most kang kongs that we ate outside, it seems that the kang kong with thicker stems were removed, and what was served was a rather uniform and consistent sized kang kongs. We didn't have any of the nasty experience I often get when chewing through those thick and inedible stems. The spiciness of the kang kong could be upped a notch though.
My first impression of the mocha ribs was the pleasing aroma wafting under our noses as they served it, and that was even before we could see it. At first glance, the unseemly plate of ribs did not look like much, but just the smell of it was tantalizing enough for us to reach in immediately for one. The sauce was thick and evenly coated, does not feel greasy nor overwhelming. The balance between the sweetness of the sauce and the slightly earth coffee taste was nicely done
Both of the crabs were succulent and full of meat! Rather than spending approximately $40 to $50 ordering crabs from your local zi char store and rolling the dice, hoping that you'll get a fat and juicy crab, I would think it to be more valuable to spend a bit more, to get a quality guarantee!
Might be personal preference, but the chilli crab could be upped a notch if you're into spicy food. Feels like a ""小辣“ if you're looking a comparison.
The servers were great! Taking the initiative to clear our plates when the shell was piled up and they were hospitable and explained in detail with regards to the choices of crabs that were available."
Excellent service,The food maintains quality and taste. The staffs are very friendly and helpful. Had a very nice dinner experience.
OK To Visit Once In A While,"We ordered the 4-pax Set Meal.
Service was excellent but the Signature Chili Crab is not very authentic. Tasted more like chili ketchup crab, unlike the original. If you like your chili crab more on the tomato sauce side, you might like this.
The coffee ribs were fantastic! Fried soon hock was meh. Yam and scallop cups were meh. Lobster Bee Hoon was so so. Lobster was really bland but bee hoon was very salty. Yam paste (orhni) was weird - had sweet corn sauce over the yam paste - an unusually spin on a traditional dessert."
Goold old fashion chili crabs,Sumptuous meal. The crab is meaty and firm and the chili crab is the original Singaporean variety with the fermented soya beans in the mix. Everything is yummy. Cost is on the high side but that might be expected for the freshness of the ingredient that came with the food.
Great place !,"Went during dinner time, was pretty windy. Since it was outdoor seating, there was a stray cat roaming around. But other than that it was alright! Lots of option for seafood but not many for meat ( I guess cause it’s a seafood restaurant )"
