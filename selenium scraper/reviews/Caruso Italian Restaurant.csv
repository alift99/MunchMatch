Enjoyable Puglia cuisine,"Friendly and rustic. Good Puglia food and friendly service. Amazing Vitello Tonno. Most delicious Pasta Marinara without tomatoes. Roast lamb was awesome. The chicken, prosciutto and aubergines good. We enjoyed their desserts of Pistachio gelato with Baileys, and Affogato and Tiramisu ."
We scheduled a long layover just to come back!,"This is our favorite Italian restaurant in all of Singapore. Fantastic staff starting with the owner who makes sure every guest gets first-class service. We have always felt welcome and treated very well. The food is authentic and tastes amazing. Easy to get to as it is just a few steps away from the 6th St MRT station. If you love Italian food,this is the place to visit!"
Genuine Service,"Usually when the servers asked if everything is ok, they hope it will be fine and nothing needs to be done. In our case, the Vongole pasta ordered was a bit too salty for our taste. Hence, upon knowing our feedback, the kitchen redo the Vongole pasta and it was just right for our tastebud. Appreciate the extra mile the restaurant took to take pride in their food and ensure the customers are happy."
Great food at Caruso Italian,Had a great lunch session with local team and visiting colleague from US. Food was great and service was prompt. Its true value for money.
Dinner,"My wife and I had a very nice dinner. For starters we ordered ‚ÄúLa Burrata‚Äù and ‚ÄúCarpaccio Di Salmone‚Äù both are amazing! Then as mains we had to share (then both can test all) ‚ÄúPolipo Alla Griglia‚Äù (that‚Äôs also amazing) and ‚ÄúGnocchi Al Gorgonzola e Noci‚Äù (the gnocchi dough itself is just ok! nothing special on it! but the sauce is what makes it good! The sauce of Gorgonzola cheese white and toasted walnuts is really nice!). Also to mention a small basket with a nice test bread before everything.
The service is good and place is nice!
Will be back to try more things for sure."
Authentic Italian food,"Caruso have a good variety across their appetizer, pasta, mains and pizza. Especially love the dough of the pizza and it‚Äôs well fired. Best to inform the staffs to serve the food progressively as they tend to serve everything at one go and the food tends to get cold when servings is not staggered. Staffs are not as attentive (conclusion based on several visits) but they generally do a reasonable job."
Outstanding food,Simply excellent - we had a range of starters and main courses. All were first class. Thoroughly recommended !
Coming back up to speed...,"We'd eaten at Caruso pre-pandemic and had left with fond memories of the same, so we were excited to come back after all this time for another visit. Unfortunately the restaurant feels a little like it's getting back up to speed at this stage - the service was a little rough and a number of the items we ordered weren't great to be honest. However the manager was great and we really appreciated the complimentary desserts to make up for the misses - we would go again, but maybe be a little more careful which dishes to order next time - very much hope they're able to get back to their former glory!"
ALWAYS good!!,Love this place for its great food and awesome service!! Best Italian in Singapore and very seasonable priced!
Family dinner on a weekday,"Caruso never failed me with their food. We have been patronizing the place ever since it had opened. We know their food so well that we will usually call them to prepare and we‚Äôll just go, eat and leave. This recent meal was kind of disappointing as I realized that their shrimp has shrunk! I would think it‚Äôs the inflation! Though the shrimp has shrunk, the taste remains the same. Caruso is packed nowadays. Do remember to make your reservation before going."
We Love Caruso,Leonardo is always on the scene which makes a huge difference to us. Seeing the owner involved in all aspects of how the restaurant runs is why the quality of the food and service remains so high and so consistent. ......Veronica & Ken
Italian restaurant near Sixth Avenue,"We had a delightful dinner recently at Caruso. Our last visit was quite some time back so we decided to re-visit this popular restaurant in Bukit Timah.

It was quite pack on a Saturday evening but we didn‚Äôt had to wait long for a table.

We ordered a bruschetta for starter, a spaghetti marinara and pizza Mamma Mia. The marinara sauce was a little spicy but otherwise it tasted really nice. We asked for a thin crust pizza and the Mamma Mia pizza did not disappoint.

Staff was friendly and service was prompt.

If you are driving the best place to park is Guthrie Centre which is off Sixth Avenue."
Hidden gem,This restaurant is out of city centre and its worth the trip for the real authentic Italian pizza. It also have excellent pasta dishes. Staff very attendive and helpful ambience is also very cosy. Dishes are reasonable priced. Thanks to Leonard for looking after me.
Family dinner,There were only two waitresses for upstairs and down. They did an amazing job but food was quite slow. Not quite as expected. Pork belly burnt on one side. No rocket but chopped lettuce. This was also put on the side of saltimbocca which was swimming in gravy. Food was not quite as good as usual. We have been to this restaurant many times so this was a little disappointing. Mains took an hour
Good Italian food,"Had a great lunch at Caruso as usual. Service is ok. Staffs are generally friendly. Food is good and wholesome. Only had a small issue with the pace and timeliness of the food serving. We had a small table for five pax and there‚Äôs no order of serving the food - mains were served together with appetizer. I asked to send back the mains as we haven‚Äôt even get started with the appetizer and two orders of appetizer had already filled up the table. In general, the pizza should be served between appetizer and mains but it came more than 20 minutes later after we finished our mains. The restaurant definitely can improve on the pacing of serving the food as it ruins the dining experience when food is just served randomly. But otherwise, food is good and I‚Äôll still recommend this restaurant."
"Great Service by Jeia, Great Food & Ambience","We were well taken care of by Jeia, she‚Äôs really got all it takes to make us feel at home. Attentive, polite, prompt and very friendly. It‚Äôs our first time here and the house pour pinot grigio was awesome! Angus beef was so gd, better than lawry‚Äôs!
Cosy, real Italian ambience and food which is rich in flavour."
Love it!,Really love the vibe of this place! Made me feel like i‚Äôm in Italy ü•∫ Food was delightful and service was great. Will definitely visit again!
Good for family dinners,The orecchiette is something I would return for and pizzas were reliably good. Grilled octopus and vongole were nothing to shout about‚Ä¶ Overall the place is a nice find in a central but not too busy location.
Excellent Food and Service,"We are a regular diner in Caruso and the food quality and service is always constant.
If you are looking for authentic Italian food , please come by. This is a family friendly dining restaurant and they have wide selection of food menu and Italian wine to pair with your food."
Great Ravioli,The porcini and tartufo ravioli was very good. Ordered a second portion immediately. The porchetta was also good but the ribeye steak was average.
Dinner for two,"Walked in and found a table for two in this small family restaurant. The boss comes from Pugalia- on west side of Italy, north of Rome. Ordered their caprese- mozzarella plus tomato slices, spaghetti marinara which tasted great and veal Milanese- with bone and tasted wonderful with tartar sauce. All the above for sharing. Portions was good to share. Friendly staff and price is mid to high dependent on what is being ordered. Cosy little Italian eatery."
True Italian flavor,"This beautiful restaurant along Bukit Timah, is a hidden gem. The food quality was exceptional, and the portions are quite generous. The Orecchiette pasta was the star of the night, and all other pasta looked great!"
Friendly little place with good food & service,"It's a small unpretentious place with a traditional family feel.
Nice ambience when reasonably full.
Owner/manager is Italian but serving staff aren't (although they're very friendly & helpful & appear well training in the menu & names).
The food itself was very nice, flavoursome & more akin to Italian home cooking.
The wine selection is pretty good too."
They are so short handed,They are so short handed that you can never be served properly. The table was not set up properly and the waitresses have no time to attend to the problem.
Excellent set lunch,"Amazing hole in the wall Italian place in Bukit Timah. We prefer sitting upstairs as it's less noisy. Frequently here and it has never disappointed. Set lunch provides excellent value. Tried the creamy tomato pasta special a few days back and it was really good. The pork belly and ribeye are great too. Spaghetti Marinara was good, but not as good as the other mains. Will definitely be back!"
Homely Italian setting,"We have enjoyed our meals at Carso the few times we have come here for lunch and dinner. The family setting, homely atmosphere and friendly staff always made the experience good. We sat on the upper floor of the restaurant which was cozy.

The food was good. I enjoyed the burratta, bruschetta and the lamb. .The rest of the food including the dessert were tasty and well-portioned.

We‚Äôve been to a number of Italian restaurants around Singapore. It is comparable to the best in its category. The price range, quality of food and overall dining experience ranks it amongst our favourite dining places."
A neighbourhood beauty!,"The service is what sets this place apart from most restaurants in Singapore. The burrata is a MUST HAVE, and the pastas are great. Love the Italian guy who makes me feel like I'm back in Italy! What a delight."
Spaghetti alle vongole to die for!,"My Italian husband Michele and I like to come here at least once a week with our kids to satisfy our spaghetti alle vongole fix! It's delicious! I would also recommend the carpaccio as a starter or the mozzarella di bufala. If you are very hungry, go for the tagliata steak which is excellent. The owner is very hospitable and friendly and the location is convenient. A taste of Italy for those who are faraway."
Amazing experience,Great value for money and the service was impeccable! Every time we visit we are greeted with a warm friendly smile and a wonderful conversation
Great family friendly place,Great family friendly place that has lots of regulars who live in the neighbourhood. Staff are friendly and there are good wines available at reasonable prices. Look out for the specials on the blackboard. Veal Milanese (not on menu) is great (they only serve if not too busy).
Great local find,"Fantastic service, food, and just a cute little spot. Everything was delightful, would definitely visit again!"
Great food,"Great value for money. The pastas were esp. tasty, though I hear the pizzas are great too. Restaurant prices are off the charts in Singapore these days, but Caruso is a reminder that you don't have to pay top dollar for good grub."
Best pizza I had so far in Singapore,we visited for lunch and we had two pizza.... simple: Napoletana and Capricciosa. We are Italian and we found it really good! I will go back
"Delicious, authentic Italian","Delicious, authentic Italian food with excellent service. Their lava cake is mouth watering. Will highly recommend."
I mean why?,"When you order over $100 in take out pizza, why is the pizza not cut properly? I think they pre-cut it before cooking - all the toppings were intact... bizarre. Food is authentic Italian. Service isn't,"
Wonderful meal,Had a great meal in the restaurant. Cosy vibes and relatively good food. Had the Vongole and it was not too bad but wish the clams were not so ‚Äúsandy‚Äù. The puglia pizza was delicious . The bolognese and marinara was good too.
Super food in a comfy unpretentious surrounding,"We had lunch, taking advantage of a EatIgo offer which rewarded us for an earlier time booking. The staff were really pleasant and the restaurant was just so casual and comfy to be in.
The menu was much more extensive than we expected and the food was excellent: the Burrata is a must, the lasagne wonderful, and the vegetarian pizza had the most yummy crust -- the rest was good too!!
We will definitely be going back to this touch of Puglia in Singapore!!"
Italian casual dining,It was a great and enjoyable Italian casual dining experience for my family and friends on CNY day. The boss was very kind to ask his customers to vacate a ground floor table to accomodate us as my wife was on crutches.
lunch,"had lunch here, soup, tagliata manzo and pistachio bailey. food and service are decent. will be back for more soon."
Mangiamo @ Caruso,"Back again to savour the gourmet food and wine!
Caruso's set up is typical of the Italian culture - a place where frequent gatherings to enjoy spending time with family and friends.
The presentation was simplicity but the foods were packed with qualities and fresh ingredients.
The set dinner (4 courses) was a safe choice if you can't decide what to select from the cibo menu. But the star of the evening has to be the linguine tartufo!
The recommended vino was fruity and flavoured and complemented the foods.
Had a good meal and will be back again!"
"Brilliant, as always!","Family favourite. Authentic food, great host and service. We think this is one of the best value, authentic Italian restaurants in Singapore."
Very nice surprise,"off the most glamoured paths, Caruso is a very nice surprise for both the quality of their dishes, and for the friendly/warming atmosphere that the owner Leonardo brings to the table. Being suggested Vitello Tonnato (veal in tuna sauce), and Parmigiana (eggplant) as starters to share, both outstanding and very well managed in term of ""reasonably"" light cooking, with no added oil or butter. The Pappardelle al Guanciale di Manzo we had as main was superb. Good wine from Puglia (a Primitivo, full bodied). $ damage is reasonable for Singapore. Few meters away from MRT station makes it easy to be reached by public transportation fanatics like me."
Cosy diner for Italian food,"Thanks to a friend who wanted to have his birthday dinner at this place - otherwise, we would not have discovered it !"
Vote the best pizza,Simply the best in Singapore. I tried many pizza places in Singapore . Caruso to me would be the real authenic italian pizza cooked to perfection
Lovely Italian,"Simple and delicious Italian food, authentic service and a nice wine selection. Highly recommend for a cosy dinner."
"If you are Italian, save your money and don't go!","if you are home sick and you look for a cozy restaurant with authentic food and warm hospitality, with reasonable prices, you end up in the wrong place here :("
Family dinner to celebrate don‚Äôs birthday,"Food is awesome especially pizza and steak ! Service is prompt, ambience is relax , wine was great too ... overall we enjoyed our dinner very much üòç"
"Good main courses, terrible cigarette smell indoors, ok service","The appetizer was a let down. I would say it was horrible. The caprese wiyh mozzarella and tomato just tasted wholly of onions. Did they cut it on a board that was just cutting onions? Terrible.
The tiny bit of purple cabbage on the side was the most bitter thing I‚Äôve ever eaten. It shouldn‚Äôt be. I‚Äôve had purple cabbage before. It was never this bitter. Horrible. $21++ wasted money. Only 4 slices of cheese and 4 slices of tomato. Doesn‚Äôt cost that much...
That‚Äôs Why the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù rating instead of very good which I initially selected.

The main courses were good. Salmon pasta was just the right amount of creaminess. Can do with a bit more sauce and salmon. $25++
The sausage and cheese pizza was good. The crust was abit on the hard and chewy side but on the whole the taste was good. Rather authentic Italian style. $27++
We were recommended the cannoli dessert. $13++ there were 3 rolls of it. It tasted fresh. I would say it‚Äôs tastier than the one I had in an authentic proper cannoli shop in London.
We also had a bottle of red wine $80++ and the total bill was around $200 for 3 people.
Not exactly cheap. Are there better Italian restaurants for this price? Definitely.
But if you‚Äôre in the area and you yearn a pretty authentic Italian meal, this could be the place to go to.
Bustling during meal times. And full house on a Friday night."
Very Good,Tasty pizzas. The bruschetta was great. Menbrea is always a winner. Family friendly. Italian owned. Will go back.
Most Authentic Italian in Singapore,Love this place. You can tell it is owned and run by Italians and they care about food. Really good cold cuts and cheeses. Great italian pastas (including the less mainstream ones such as squid ink) good lamb and if you go on a sunday the SGD 58 four course is hard to beat for value and quality. Even wines by the glass are lovely. I used to live in Italy and this place makes me feel nostalgic.
Not bad,The food was ok service not bad the only thing the space to small and very noise.But we‚Äôd great night although we are really not familiar with the foods and wine‚Äôs choice.Will come back again soon
Pasta and Pizza,"food was good as expected. calamari was just the right crisp and tenderness. pasta and pizza we ordered was also very good.
need improvement and probably training on some staff to handle reservations as one who assisted did not even ask for our reservation and when we asked which table, she just ushered us to sit down anywhere."
Very pleasantly surprised,"Arriving for dinner, we found a cozy restaurant with walls painted in orange stucco. The nice ambience was suggestive of a good dinner which turned out to be the case! As we arrived early, there was a good selection of available tables on the ground floor as well as on the mezzanine level.

The Bruschetta Al Pomodoro on toasted bread was an appetising start. We shared an order each of Tagliolini Alla Marinara seafood pasta, Prosciutto E Funghi pizza with mozzarella, ham and mushrooms, and Galletto Alla Griglia grilled spring chicken with rosemary, rocket salad and roasted baby potatoes. Well prepared, the flavours were good and we enjoyed our meal.

Dinner ended on a sweet note with tiramisu, chocolate ice cream and strawberry sorbet.

Service was good. Lovely dinner."
"Very good, yet again",We gave been here twice. The steak and pizzas are fantastic. The grilled octopus was very good. I would thoroughly recommend this to those wanting a genuine Italian meal.
Italian ambiance,"It‚Äôs a nice cosy place and has really some Italian ambiance. The menu is typical for an Italian restaurant with lots of choice, pastas, antipasti, etc Except for the long waiting time to order, although it wasn‚Äôt even busy: we really had a good time. The chicken is definitely a good choice and also the tiramisu was really nice as well. We definitely give this place another try."
Love the linguine vongole,"We visited Caruso on a Sunday evening. The restaurant is situated on the main Bukit Timah Road, quite close to the Sixth Avenue MRT Station.

We‚Äôd ordered a linguine vongole and a calzone for the two of us. The linguine vongole was probably the best that we had tasted so far - the white wine sauce was flavourful with a generous spread of clams.

The calzone was a bit disappointing - we like the ‚Äúskin‚Äù but the dish was a bit dry. The centre part of the calzone tasted nice with the ham.

The house red that I‚Äôd ordered went well with the two dishes.

For dessert we had the walnut tart with Lemoncello. I think it will taste better if I had asked for a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Overall it was an enjoyable dinner."
Excellent choice for lunch with friends,This restaurant offers very good choices of starters and main courses. The staff are friendly and they even allow you to make changes to the menu.
Authentic Italian Food,"Tasty italian food place to try, coupled with friendly warm smiling service team , making the Saturday lunch really enjoyable. Highly recommended"
Amazing,I have eaten here a number of times and have always had an excellent meal with the unusual Italian influence of Puglia. But tonight we lucked in. They had fresh white truffles from the Piedmont region and the tagliolini e Tartufo was beyond belief!!!! We asked for extra Truffle and were more than willing to pay and they willingly did this for what I thought was a small amount. The taste and flavour - wow!!!!!!!!! I shall remember this meal a very lot longer than most Michelin or Top Restaurants of the World list. It was out of this World....
Sunday Dinner,"Love this place. Family oriented. Very friendly boss. Always Prego, Grazia...love their Pork Belly, Pizza, Pasta and Tiramisu. Try it!"
Pretty average,"Read some of the reviews and was looking forward to a nice casual Italian dinner . Have to say the atmosphere isn‚Äôt nice when you sit upstairs (highly lively as downstairs is very small). We had two appetizer (fried calamari were excellent) and three pasta and two bottles of water. Pasta was ok but nothing special, the bread basket was a bit pathetic and very average bread. At the end we paid 165.- for three people for a casual Sunday evening dinner. Sorry that‚Äôs too expensive especially when the good was nothing special. We won‚Äôt come back"
Disappointing Service,"We were at Caruso on a Friday evening at around 7:30pm. Reservations were made for 4 through Chope. We were ushered to our seats upstairs. There were 2 staff who served the upper level who seems to be totally out of syn with one another. One took our order, but the one who served it kept on getting the orders wrong. We were served the wrong pizza, and were told only after we had eaten 3 slices. We were asked if we wanted our original pizza order, and when we said yes, we were served it, but the half-eaten pizza was taken away. Another restaurant would have just left the remainder of the pizza and said that it was on the house. Who would eat the half-eaten pizza!?! Risotto was served instead of our ravioli. And our spaghetti carbonara went to the other table who had come after us, and after the rest of us had finished our pastas, we were told the missing spaghetti carbonara was still on its way. After we asked for it to be cancelled, we were then told the next minute that it was here, and it was thereafter served. This is an abbreviated version of the screw ups with service that night. I would have thought the staff would have been more apologetic but they seemed so out it that we didn‚Äôt bother. Food was average and certainly not enough for us to overlook the sloppy service."
Definitely my love,Certainly will go back again! This time we tried the dessert. Fantastic! The service crews are quick and efficient.
Set lunch - Good value for money,"Food is good especially the set lunch is good value for the money. Restaurant location is convenient, near bus/MRT station."
Good food and service,Generally food‚Äôs good across the board. Pizza & pasta are excellent if you don‚Äôt know what to order for lunch.
Very expensive,Ordered lagsana. Extremely average. Very pricey. Also ordered pana cotta which is $12 bucks for a pathetic serving. Very disappointed
Gluten Free yay,It‚Äôs hard to find Italian restaurants that cater for gluten free options even if it‚Äôs just a single choice of pasta. It‚Äôs now my favourite restaurant since I discovered the place. Yummy food and great service. Wish they have longer happy hour though.
"Authentic cuisine from Puglia, Italy",My favorite Italian restaurant in Singapore. The amazing seafood linguine in white wine sauce with a touch of chilli padi is absolutely out of this world. This is the only restaurant serving authentic dishes from Puglia. The sea bass baked in sea salt is a must if available. An excellent selection of Italian wine is available. The charming hospitality of Leonardo always makes the dining a wonderful experience.
Quality food,Good quality food and service to match. A little on the expensive side considering portion size and atmosphere.
Authentic hearty Italian,"Located in a shophouse before 6th Avenue, if you drive you need to park at Guthrie House.

The owner is from Puglia and the chef is Italian too.

The burrata Parma ham and rocket leaves not as good as the one from Rubato, mainly because it could do with more salad dressing and the burrata mainly salty and less soft.

The prawns in bacon were average.

The ravioli with mushrooms and truffles was good.

My order of pappardelle was meant to come with pork sausage which was served with a traditional Puglia pasta, which was interesting to try. Not commonly available.

The tiramisu and walnut almond tarte were both good.

Corkage is $35."
Relaxed Italian home-style cusine,"If you are looking for a delicious family-friendly Italian eatery, Caruso is a highly recommended stop away from the bustle of the city center. Helmed by Manager Leonardo and his friendly team of Italian and local chefs, Caruso recalls the understated small-town kitchens that might feature on a relaxed road-trip across Italy. Service is always warm and welcoming. Well priced home-style lasagna, pastas, seafood, pizza, grilled meats (charcoal grilled!!) and authentic home-made tiramisu round out a tasty menu, with something for everyone. Nice wine list too!"
SOLID SERVICE AND THE FOOD WAS AMAZING!,Love the ambience of the restaurant! Not too crowded! The food was amazing! Service was really good! Thank you!
Seafood soup!!!,I love the seafood so muchhhhh. It‚Äôs flavorful yet not too creamy. They made sure the seafood are fresh and nicely prepared. Highly recommend!
Good place for family,"The restaurant is located near Six Avenue MRT which makes it quite accessible.
I felt the dishes are Southern Italian style which was very delicious.
Their burrata cheese was very fresh, and I recommend their Pizzas.
Pastas also nice but you might want to say to add less salt when you order them."
Excellent Food and Ambience + Value for $$ too,Will definitely re-visit the restaurant again with friends and family members. Great varieties of Italian food !!
Standard Italian - Good food and service,Nothing outstanding .. in fact a little pricey but it was good. Octopus salad was good. Slow cooked lamb was OK - perhaps a little burnt on the outside. Tiramisu was also just OK - not amazing. Overall its OK if you just want something good and local - wouldn't suggest you travel far to get there. Again bottom line is good but overpriced.
Friendly Italian Eatery on Sixth Avenue,Conveniently located next to MRT station. Food good but not outstanding. Papardelle dish recommended. Service is good. Price moderate.
Brings out South Italy authenticity,"Visited three times and it's always as good as my first. Quite affordable price considering the portions of the food. Authentic Italian dishes which I very much enjoy, especially parmigiana. Personal service from the owner himself, Leonardo. This restaurant is a great choice whether for couples or big group. Wall arts are nice too :)"
Excellent Italian restaurants.,"Caruso Located at #01-01 791 Bukit Timah Road, Singapore 269764, Singapore Been of an Italian background, I am always on the watch for good Italian restaurants. This restaurant offers authentic southern Italian food. The environment is relaxed and you feel like you are dining in a friend‚Äôs home. Food is very well presented and nice portions too. We tried several dishes that was on offer, all delicious with the real Italian taste, the highlight for me was antipasti, several type of pastas, and off course all were outstanding. Unfortunately after all that food we were just too full to try the desserts, which I'm sure they must be delicious, anyway I must confess it was the tastiest Italian food I've had for a while & it didn't break the bank. About the Service and atmosphere also get really high marks! Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night, beautiful ambience, exquisite food and great wine selections. I truly recommend this place if you want high quality Italian cuisine."
Not bad,Went there with a group of 18 people who all seemed to have good food and no complaints. I had the Sunday brunch SGD48++ which gave a flavour of several dishes and no complaints. Service was good and friendly. I will go back..
Comforting,My third visit to Caruso was as good as the first. Food has been delicious every time. The warm reception and good service only adds to the overall experience.
A Delightful Experience,"It was my second time at the restaurant. The first time was a wine pairing dinner at a fabulous price of S$88++ per person. This time I went with 3 other friends, one of whom was gluten intolerant. But it didn‚Äôt matter because the waiter was very aware of which of the dishes were gluten free. For the quality of food we had, the price was very reasonable. The list of wine were very affordable and well selected. Embience and service were a delight"
"Best food, Bad experience","Visited caruso for our dinner. The Strascinati pasta and Pollo arrosto was best in industry.
The place was very hot. I wondered that the restaurant was very busy but only two servers working. Our order was delayed for long time and I was looking for a superior but unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt find anyone. I feel pity for the service people but somehow they managed to handle the pressure with smile. Anyhow thanks to that Indian guy (Kumar) who made us feel comfort from starting to end. My only complaint is why don‚Äôt hire more servers for better service."
Dinner at Caruso,Very family friendly atmosphere. The rocket salad and mussels were delicious. Pastas were also really good. We are definitely visiting again to try their pizza and other pasta dishes.
Caruso brings you to Italy without a flight!,"Probably the best Italian food that I have enjoyed outside Italy.
Nice pastas, big portions, great antipasti, really good pizza... and the grill beef rib eye its top class.
Very good wine list not overpriced, and friendly service.
Top Restaurant! Surely one of my favourite now!"
Authentic Italian food in a cosy restaurant,"Little and cosy Italian restaurant in bukith timah rd.
Teh interior are very warm, great family styled personal service. Food was simple yet very tasty and authentic... great tasty southern italian pasta and very good grill meats.
Wine selection very good and won't kill your wallet.
Recommended for a weekly friends and family gathering."
Pretty good authentic Italian food,Been to this restaurant before.Good service and food. The Calamari was excellent. So was the beef cheek
Best italian,So nice to have a restaurant like this as your local. Very warm friendly atmosphere backed up by superb authentic Italian. Often has a weeks special. Parma festival on this week. So hard to decide what to choose. Have never been disappointed.
Family dinner,"Service was decent .my rissoto with ham and porcini and foie gras was very good . But my wife and younger daughter had the scallops . It was very disappointing to say the least , The scallops were rubbery and overcooked . That spoiled the evening somewhat. The tiramisu while decent did not have enough liquer but the panna cotta was good . So overall some what variable in quality and hence experience."
Average,"Ordered calamari rings , rib eye steak, seafood marinara. Calamari was good, portion was generous..steak was average . Seafood marinara was very average, tasted much better elsewhere."
Outstanding Italian food,"The food was a positive suprise: fresh, authentic italien cuisine that tastes extremely good. The owner is Italian and that clearly shows. The only minus was the service: not very attentive. It looked like it was a burden to work there...
We made the mistake to take a taxi from city center. Better us to use MRT / blueline. The station 6th Avenue is right around the corner."
Very good southern Italian food,Great place to taste something different from the usual Italian... The owner from Puglia is a great host. Orecchiette pasta are delicious! Must try
"Beautiful, beautiful authentic Italian","Caruso's is the epitome of Italian. Fabulous fresh authentic food. Using the freshest and seasonally available ingredients this restaurant never fails to deliver. Welcoming to all, great with kids, there is always something interesting to try. Just at the top of 6th Avenue."
Great Italian Food at Caruso,"We happen to come here after unsuccessfully locating another Italian restaurant and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of all the dishes...fresh mozzarella, salads, and pastas.
We enjoyed the mushroom stuffed ravioli and beef lasagna.
The wine selection was also good and we enjoyed the Primitivo red wine.
We would highly recommend Caruso for some fine Italian food"
Always yummy,This cafe was an incidental discovery for my husband and I some months ago when we had time to kill before our spa appointment. But since then we've been coming back for yummy pasta and pizza. The ambience is authentically Italian and the waiters are knowledgeable of the food they serve (always a plus).
Always well,"The food, service, the ambience. It isn't like other restaurants with too much of social media publicity but the food never fail me/ anyone that I brought. Absolutely authentic. I like to stay at second floor. Oh yea, I ordered sea bass, my friend ordered pasta and tiramisu. They were just so fine."
Brilliant little authentic Italian restaurant,"Absolutely delicious pasta, pizza & burrata.. Warm ambience, quick service & really welcoming feel. This will become a family regular !!"
Great little find,We were happily surprised at the quality of the food at Caruso. The cannelloni was particularly good. Reasonable range of wines too
Worth your visit!,"An authentic Italian restaurant. Such a hidden gem (perhaps for me, without realising it). Love it so much for the fresh pasta and pizza. I believe I will become one of the regular customers!"
Best pizza I ever had.,Amazing fresh tasy pizza's. Real Italian atmosphere with a Italian owner who loves to see you in his restaurant. Nice wine and good desserts. Cosy place close to MRT station Sixt avenue
