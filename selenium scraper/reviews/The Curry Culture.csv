Average food at high prices,"Nothing wrong with the food…we had a small meal of butter chicken ( good), sag ghosht (good) and Kashmiri pilau rice (too sweet) with tea on the side. Bill was S$ 106.
It would have been half that price in our local in London and similar or better quality.
Singapore has got beyond itself in pricing levels. Singapore no longer offers good value for visitors."
Great Indian food gluten free,"Great staff, friendly service, knowledgeable about gluten free options. Tasty food, bit on the pricey side, worth a visit though."
Unnecessarily Expensive!,"The two of us ordered two veg starters, two veg mains, two breads, and a salad and paid $110 for the pleasure. The food was just okay ... not awful but not memorable either, just very mid-grade. Subsequently we ate at two truly classy and gourmet restaurants (Peranakan and Chinese) ... we ate our fill of mind-blowingly delicious dishes at these two places and each time paid just around $75 for two people! This tells you that even in today's Singapore (and today's out-of-control inflationary environment) it is possible to eat well for a reasonable price. But not here!"
Quality Indian dining in lovely outdoor terrace setting,"High quality Indian food in lovely outdoor terrace setting. The prawn malabar masala and paneer makahnwala were both exceptional. I’ll stick my neck out on this one and reckon that was the best garlic naan I’ve had outside India too. The complimentary starter was also delicious.

I booked this for my husband’s birthday and was so glad I did! He was spoilt with surprise cake and bubbles by the lovely staff - such a nice and unexpected touch. Apparently the outdoor area has just been renovated with new furniture - it looks great. It’s covered so no issues with rain. Highly recommend for top-notch Indian food."
Authentic Indian cuisine!,"Authentic Indian cuisine in a hidden walkway. Super friendship staff, all dishes were fresh, well seasoned and good sized portions. Certainly not inexpensive ($150 CDN for 2 people for 3 fishes and 3 drinks), but the location is fun and the staff really make you feel welcome."
"Best around, good service, but food average","Hi, found this place while staying nearby on a business trip….. friendly and welcoming service, decent menu selection, convenient location.
I have to say that probably gets a 4/5, but the food was quite a disappointment. Nothing wrong with it but it was very bland and average. The flavours were not stand-out and it was just a bit boring, the lamb was a bit on the tough side.
I did actually go back another day because the location was good and I have to say same experience, good friendly service but food was just average. The fact I went back another day shows there really wasn’t anything bad about the food, but it wasn’t a meal I will remember.
If I was in the area I might go back, but I wouldn’t travel any distance or time to go here again."
not disappoint.,Came across this lovely indian restaurant on a recent trip to Singapore. Great customer service. Friendly and attentive staff with the added extra personal touch from the owner. Highly recommend this place.
Excellent meal & service. I will definitely be back,"Excellent Indian restaurant, great location too. Plenty menu variety and wide variety of selection. Reasonable pricing, excellent service overall. I will definitely return on my next visit to Singapore."
First visit and totally impressed by the service and food.,"We were randomly walking around seeking dinner and chance upon Curry Culture. Warmly welcomed by the manager Amar and we decided to give it a shot. So glad we did.

Great food recommendations by Amar when we weren’t sure what to order. Food is so flavorful, super delicious! We polished up our plates. That’s the best testimonial. (We had chicken tikka masala and clay oven fish, along with some Naan)

Will definitely be back to try another house’s favorite - Butter Chicken. ❤️"
"Good food,good behavior, high price","Location: Good, Cuppage road, 10 min walking from orchard road.
Sitting: Casual, open area, with other restaurants sittings around, seperated by low height temporary partitions, music playing around.
Food: All dishes ordered were good in taste.Potion sizes were less.
Price: High. We got exactly similar bill in other Indian fine dining restaurants.
( Awadh is bad, and, not fine dining).

I have mentioned Awadh because it is very near to Curry culture. If you want to dine at Orchard/ Cuppage, then Curry culture is much better than Awadh.We did not put in effort to locate other Indian restaurants in this location."
Superb (again),"First time here for a few years due to Covid. Not a lot to say other than it has maintained its quality in all respects.

I’ve been away too long….."
Another Great Experience at The Curry Culture,"Another trip to Singapore and another great experience at The Curry Culture

Having dined here previously, expectations were high and we were not disappointed

The menu remains very interesting, with lots of choice for all kinds of tastes and preferences

The food was once again brilliant and the hospitality and service afforded to us was extra special"
Not Worth even a try,"We went in for Valentine Dinner, even before we could think of ordering mains we wound up and left. We just ordered two dishes and both were not even worth tasting. Worst Paneer Tikka, you can ever find in Singapore and that too for exorbitant price of $22. It was so hard and tasteless. When we gave feedback they just didn't even bother.

We got duped by TV Advert, just another lesson for us not to follow the TV adverts.
Every item is pricey and food is tasteless, service non-existent.

We had go in search of decent food @ 10am, what was supposed to valentine dinner turned out to be food hunt exercise."
Was it an off day for the chef?,"We are big fans of The Curry Culture, but the last visit was a surprising disappointment. It was as if the chef was ill and replaced by an inexperienced trainee! First, it seemed they almost forgot one order, and the food took a long time to come. The sauce accompanying the Kale Channe Ki Tikki was extraordinarily salty, the vindaloo was too sour, and the rice in the biryani quite mushy. In fact, if we had not experienced The Curry Culture before, we would have given a 2-point rating. Maybe Mr. Sandeep might have been surprised at the quality of the food too."
One of the best Indian Cuisines in SG,"I think one of the best cultures I have witnessed so far?
I was with my wife and we wanted to try some new Indian restaurant and we found this place. Here is my take on this beautiful restaurant.

We ordered Kale Chane ki Tikki (basically black chickpea patty). The tikkis came with a garlic sauce that was so unique in taste - the hotness, spiciness and tanginess all in proper proportions. The combination was mind blowing.

Then my wife ordered April Lady in drinks - it was a blend of coconut, mango and and mint. The drink was so flavourful, blending all three in right proportions. It was not at all overdone. Thumbs up to the drink

For main course we ordered Paneer Makhani (Shahi Paneer) prepared in Delhi style. While placing order for this dish, the waiter would ask the style of preparation - Delhi/Mumbai. We asked for Delhi style - masaledar and spicy. Along with Paneer Makhani, we ordered Masala Khulcha.
Boy oh boy, the best Paneer Makhani I have had in Singapore so far. And that khulcha, prepared in tandoor - stuffed with their signature masala preparation. Both of them tasted delicious individually. And when had together, I then could not stop myself until I finished it completely. It left me asking for more.

If you are searching for this restaurant in google and reading this review, do one thing - just go to this restaurant and munch on their dishes. I am sure, you will not be let down.

P.S: They provide complimentary pappads and their signature sauces as well - Mint/Corriander Chutney, Sour (tangy) Chutney and Spicy (Momos?) Chutney."
Curry Culture Set Lunch,First visit here last month to meet up with a colleague for lunch. The set lunches are really very good value for money: we paid $34 for 2 set lunches. Good quality Indian food and attentive service. No need for a reservation as it isn't busy on a weekday lunchtime.
Catering by Curry Culture for our family event,"We catered food from Curry Culture for a family function. The food was great, quantity was more than sufficient. Sandeep was very helpful from menu selection to delivery. Everything was fine. However, if planning catering from them and want door delivery, specify and get confirmation. Else, you may need to rush to car park to collect food leaving the function in between."
The Pearl in the Crown of Cuppage Road,"For a wonderfully authentic Indian meal, cooked to perfection, pay a visit to The Curry Culture in Cuppage Road, Singapore. Smiling and friendly, the staff will guide you through the contents of all their excellent dishes. And although all are to be recommended, I especially enjoyed the Keema Matar: a minced lamb dish with peas and spices. My guest's Chicken Jalfrezi was also delicious and perfectly spiced. Unlike many good Indian restaurants, the portions are moderate in size, not overwhelming, and served in small copper bowls. The Daily Special today, 22 March, offers Lamb Jalfrezi, Chicken Bhuna, and Kadhai Paneer. And do try their Flutini: Bombay Sapphire, ginger and turmeric, or their Herbal Ginger Turmeric tea. Sandeep and his staff are charming and efficient, which makes for a delightful experience at The Curry Culture, Singapore."
Good Curry in a Central Location,"While there are A LOT of great Indian restaurants in Singapore, there aren't many at all in the Orchard Road area. The Curry Culture is in a group of a number of restaurants/bars on Cuppage Road and as far as I know, is one of only a few Indian restaurants in the area.

I've been a handful of times and the place is always buzzing but you can usually get a table straight away. There is proper indoor seating but also ""outdoor"" (actually it's covered to the elements but outside in the sense that it's open air and un-airconditioned). The service is always quite good (though they might forget the water when you ask but someone always comes running if you need to ask a second time). Every dish I've tried is very good.

It *is* a little pricey in my view for Northern Indian food but most of that comes from the neighborhood the restaurant is in.

Now that I'm writing this I feel like going and getting a curry this evening."
A fun night out.... excellent food,"In the Cuppage outdoor restaurant area. Bars and restaurants much like a food court. Indoor and outdoor seating. Good curry, friendly and prompt service.... a fun night out with excellent food."
Superb Indian Cuisine,"Been to this restaurant many times but not for about six months. Food and service was just as it was - excellent. Chicken malai kebab was not on the menu but was cooked for us. Which made for a great starter. The baby eggplants cooked with ground peanuts was truly wonderful, and although I’m not a vegetarian this is my favourite on the menu here, butter chicken was delicious also. Nice quiet dinner with my two children.

The staff are extremely friendly. I prefer to sit in the air con inside than outside , which we did. I love the food here. Would return anytime."
"Excellent meal, great service","I ate here while visiting Singapore and very much enjoyed my meal. The staff, particularly the owner, were lovely and very accomdating to me needing a gluten free meal. As Indian is often gluten free I eat it often, but would have to say that my meal was very good, better than many I've tried. Will definitely come back the next time I'm visiting Singapore."
"Friendly service, lovely curry","My wife and I visited the curry culture as it had good reviews and was near our hotel at orchardgateway: I love Indian food and it was my choice. We got a friendly welcome and also some advice on our food order when we asked. I ordered vindaloo and after some discussion was advised to go with a heat rating of 4 out of 10 which was pretty much perfect - I was red in the face by the end of the meal but in a good way and easily managed to eat it all. Thanks to the friendly owner/staff thry discovered through conversation it was our honeymoon and brought us complimentary dessert and wine to finish. We also recommend trying the Kashmiri naan, it is similar to peshwari but has no coconut, instead it is cheese and dried fruit which gives it the same sweetness - I was dubious but it was lovely. Highly recommend this place. 5/5."
Delicious. Authentic. Friendly.,"Delicious. Authentic. Friendly.

My coworker and I had a great dinner here. The owner (or manager?) visited with us for a buy recommending dishes and discussing travel and life. The food was exquisite and unique."
OCC SGP review of Curry Culture,"On Friday 19th July 2019 – The OCC visited Curry Culture; Cuppage Road

For full transparency, see below scores (out of 10). Restaurants must score an average of 7/10 or above to receive the OCC sticker of recommendation.

Quality: 7.74

Customer care: 8.21

Value: 6.7

Service: 8.01

Atmosphere: 7.44

Overall: 7.62

Curry Culture IS awarded the much-coveted OCC sticker of recommendation in meeting the required 7/10 average

Curry Culture a terrific curry house mixing an old school Indian menu with a top notch al fresco dining area AND a cracking atmosphere befitting of the big personalities of the OCC. The prices are slightly higher than we normally find but that is easy to absorb given the flavorful dishes from authentic Indian Chef – Rajiv, great location and great service from the staff who are willing to go the extra mile.

The authenticity of this joint is unmistakably reinforced when you go to the indoor portion of the restaurant where you are transported back to an amazing traditional curry house in 1970s UK – complete with brown wall paper décor.
The only let down for our evening was the daft American School teachers insisting they had never heard of the OCC college. “What school did you say it was?”

PS. If you are trying to figure out how to get there don’t use google maps. Pls contact OCC’s Jessy he will add 10minutes to your journey and give you a tour of car park."
A good find,"Like many others we chose this place due to the previous reviews on here. The charismatic owner makes you feel valued by helping you select the dishes best suited to your palette. He toned down the hotness of the lamb special so it didn’t blow my mouth off! All in All, good service and tasty food."
Very good Indian food!,"Very good Indian food here. We came after trip advisor recommendation and did not regret. Enjoyed our food immensely and the staff, especially the manager, were so attentive. Would recommend."
Delicious,"We chose this restaurant after reading the reviews on trip advisor. After our arrival we were seated inside the restaurant (outdoor seating is also available) This is not a fancy restaurant, it is in quite a touristy area and the toilets are a bit sad. That aside, we had a fantastic meal. We met the owner Sandeep, he was very friendly and informative. There is a heat level from 0-10 and he advised us on which level based on our tastes. We ordered the butter chicken which was fantastic, Mutton curry, saffron rice, sizzling chicken and okra as a side dish. We also had bottle of chardonnay which was good and reasonably priced. All the dishes were delicious, in fact as we told Sandeep, we have been travelling in Europe and South East Asia for the past five weeks and this is the best meal we have had so far. If that's not testament enough then what is? Give it a try, if you like genuine Indian flavours you'll love this place."
Curry,Great food and friendly service. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a decent curry / Indian food in Singapore
Fantastic Indian - Highly Recommended,"We have absolutely loved the two meals we have had here during our visits to Singapore. Friendly, and attentive service and food to die for! Highly recommended."
One of the worst Indian meals ever!!,"Very average curry,poor quality chicken and lamb.Onion bahji tasteless,will not be going back,I exspect a lot better after reading other reviews"
Another great meal,"We have been to Curry Culture many times, this time again did not disappoint. Meals are great, extremely tasty and plentiful. Service is very prompt and efficient.

All up, another really great dining experience."
Excellent indian food,"Sumptuous food good vibe.
If u into indian food it's a place to eat.Situated just of Orchard Road.Will definitely be worth a try."
Dinner at the restaurant,"Very high quality of food and service. I was together with a friend, and during dinner, we had a web meeting. We tried a variety of food from starter to dessert. I must emphasize the rich taste of the lamb and lentils they have served, the best lamb I had so far in my life. Also, I really liked the garlic nan bread. All in all a very pleasant experience, and I would recommend to anyone who is into Indian cuisine. Top choice! Thank you, Mr. Mathew and Mr. Sandeep for arrangements and excellent service."
Great place for dinner,"My husband & I had dinner here and were both really impressed. The food was amazing, the service was professional & the staff were really friendly. We will definitely head back next time we are in Singapore."
Excellent again,This restaurant never fails to deliver consistent very high standard food and service. The staff are helpful the food fresh and very tasty. Highly recommend.
Good food served with a smile,"Cuppage is a bit of a tourist, normaly not the places were the best food is being served.

However the dishes here are really tastefull. Staff is friendly and the boss comes for a friendly chat.

When looking for a nice meal in the Orchid area this place is worth going!"
We had a lovely surprise.,"I would like to give this restaurant more than 5 stars. The food was very tasty and extremely good quality, the guy serving us stopped us from over ordering rice and bread and they served water unasked. We felt we were being very well taken care of. But, the lovely surprise. They had asked us why we were visiting Singapore and we said because we had been there on our honeymoon exactly 30 years ago. After we finished our meal they presented us with two glasses of sparkling wine and a dessert with Happy anniversary written on the plate. We were absoluteY blown away by their kindness and it made a lovely evening even more special."
Love the curries,Passion by the bucket loads. This was my first visit but for the rest of my family a firm favourite and you can see why. The food is exceptionally good and plenty of choices whether you are a meat eater or vegetarian and Sandeep a fabulous host. You have the option of eating in or outside too
Great place for Indian Veg Food in Singapore,We visited on two consecutive days. It was so good. Offers great Indian food. God sent for vegetarians. Very hospitable host and offers great service. Convenient location; just off Orchard Road. Must visit.
Excellent Indian... very authentic!,"We made reservations at The Curry Culture for dinner one evening on a recent trip to Singapore. The food was excellent! Extremely flavorful and much more authentic than the Indian we get here in Alaska. We stuck with our two favorites: Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Korma. The flavors were extremely bold, while not being quite as spicy as we are used to, but at the same time being just as spicy as we would like given the hot weather! The garlic cheese naan bread was amazing and was perfect to eat alongside the curries and rice. The staff were very friendly and efficient, and the owner was very kind and a pleasure to chat with. Will definitely return in the future!"
Excellent authentic Indian cuisine,"We visited on our last night in Singapore and although we were staying in Little India made the decision to give Curry Culture a try.
We were made extremely welcome on arrival and given more than enough time, without interruption to chose our food.
The choice was excellent. Old favourite, onion bhaji and the never seen (or tasted) before, Papdi Chaat were picked along with the Butter Chicken and Bhuna Gosht.
The starters were a revelation. The bhaji's were super crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside with just the right element of spice. However, the Papdi Chaat is something I'll remember for years to come! Served cold, smooth potato in a crisp piece of poppadom with a sweet, spicy chutney sauce.......... absolute heaven.
The main courses were more of the same. Sweet butter chicken and incredibly soft and buttery lamb in the Bhuna Gosht, which was just spicy enough to make me sweat a little more.
All in all this was a great choice. Superb food and staff and clean plates at the end of each course. I recommend thisvestablishment to anyone visiting the country."
Excellent authentic Indian food,"Benn there with my friend to get some high quality Indian food in Singapore, food and service were both excellent, even tough we arrived closed to closing time
Of course it’s not the prices of food courts, but definitely worth it!!!"
Great Indian off Orchard,"Had a really fantastic curry with a business mate On a recent trip to Singapore.

Situated very close to Orchard Road it’s a great spot for dinner after a spot of retail therapy.

Service was extremely snappy and food came quickly.

We started with onion bajies Followed by a paneer tikka masala and an amazing goa fish curry. All washed down with a Stella beer.

I’ll definitely be back"
Lovely food and very good service,A very good indian restaurant with delicious food and the staff is very friendly. Dont miss this restaurant only a few footsteps from Orchard Road.
A Taste of India in the Heart of Singapore!,"I Googled where I should go for Indian food during my very brief stay in Singapore. I'm glad I avoided Little India and headed straight to this restaurant, located in the trendy shopping area off of Cuppage Road. It took some doing to find it, being unfamiliar with the city, but when I did I was impressed that I had a choice of in or outdoor dining. I chose to dine inside and immediately got the attention of the owner, who couldn't have been more friendly. He shared with me a brief history of the restaurant and his expanding list of other locations. As I find typical with any great restaurant, the owner's presence really does insure top level service and high quality of food.
This restaurant proved to be just that type of establishment. I had samosas for an appetizer, followed by. traditional Chicken Tikka Masala for my entree. The basmati rice was very tasty and light. The chicken had just the right amount of heat, without burning the top of my head off. And the service was 'on point'. The restaurant was packed and another clue I had chosen well was the high proportion of Indian diners enjoying themselves.
So, if you're in Singapore, and have a hankering for Indian food, head straight to Curry Culture. You will NOT be disappointed!"
Great food and service but not cheap,"Good food and quick service, butter chicken was very good as was their garlic naan.

Really nice friendly service from the waiters, a nice location whilst being close to Orchard Road."
Nice Indian place @Orchard,"We went their with some friends from Uk. Wanted a decent sit in place which is quiet difficult to find in Singapore when it comes to Desi food. The place is nicely setup. You can sit outside or inside. We chose to sit inside. Ambiance is nice, food was a bit pricey but great, service could do a little better. We asked for water two or three times but did not get it until we asked the fifth time. Food portions are also very small, but that’s something that we have noted in Singapore that most restaurants have small portions. Overall it’s a good place to enjoy some good curries."
Nice,"Nice India restaurant
Positives
1-Tasty
2- The Staff was friendly
3- cheaper
Negatives
1-Bad atmosphere"
Good food and a bustling atmosphere,Restaurant is located in a strip just off Orchard Road. Food was well flavoured with decent portion size. Enjoyed the meal even though it was quite noisy in general due to the close proximity of all the restaurants
Excellent - could teach a few places in the UK about flavour,How curries used to be - with intense creamy flavours and heat to match. Excellent service - would recommend to any visitor of that part of the island
Food & Environment,"Location being Near to MRT and off at end of Orchard Street ... the place is within a lively environment of multiple restaurants.. it has both indoor plus outdoor seating.

Food is authentic Indian and one can request for non-spicy if travelling with kids or on demand.

Enjoy !"
Fun friendly and good food!,"Great place! Good atmosphere. Fast and efficient. What’s not to like?

Tikka masala truly excellent as well as the bhajji.

Would I eat here again? Of course!"
excellent food and service,"I was here a couple of years ago and found that the building was under renovation so restaurant closed , I came back last year 1918 and found the area was open for business but the curry culture was not on site ?"
Rhodri,"I was visiting Singapore on my own and was on the look out for a nice Indian restaurant. I found it in the Curry Culture. I was made to feel very welcome by the staff working there and Sandeep also showed an interest in my custom and background having the opportunity to discuss my curry cuisine experiences across the world.
Will definitely recommend the place to anyone I know visiting Singapore and will definitely be back there when I am here again. Thank you for taking very good care of me guys!"
Lovely place to go with friends & family,"Loved the Ambience. Food was good. Service is quick. Complimentary papad is served.
Prices are fair enough. Will definitely like to visit again."
Great first meal in Singapore,"Curry culture did not disappoint. My dinning companion went with the all time favourite of butter chicken. He loved it, together with his serve of naan and saffron rice. I always look for something out of the ordinary. I went for a prawn stuffed with crab, cooked in tandoori oven. Very nice if you like seafood. We also had cauliflower and potatoe curry ( which I’ve attempted to make at home) and eggplant and green pea curry which is an unusual combination and more of a sauce than actual vegetables holding their shape. Delicious all up.Pricier than I would have liked but certainly filling. Service was friendly, attentive and welcoming. Good start to our three days in Singapore. Love this weather too."
Good Indian Food,"Best was the Daal served in small Balti. Roti, Naan choices are good. The restaurant is all sides open with a roof but provides air conditioning. Did not try . their happy . hours. Enjoyed the Indian pure taste from Punjab."
Curry and Culture did not disappoint!,Came across this lovely restaurant on a recent trip to Singapore. Great customer service. Friendly and attentive staff with the added extra personal touch from the owner... Highly recommend.
Delicious!,We randomly propped at this restaurant. Samosas were the best we’d ever eaten and main dishes were crispy fresh and delicious. We would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for fine Indian food in Singapore.
"Good service, good food, smallish portions","Good service, good food, smallish portions. With the current fx rates a glass of wine is around £10 as is a pint of local beer... so with the10% service charge added a one dish meal cost 128 sgd about £75"
Fun spot for first Singapore meal,"We found Curry Culture just a 5-min walk from our hotel after arriving from Bali. Good choice! Lively atmosphere in courtyard, friendly waiter, very tasty food. S$158 for parents and a 13-yr-old girl felt a bit steep, but otherwise a lovely spot."
WOW,"My wife and I travelled to Singapore for our 25th wedding anniversary and we had decided to try and find an Indian restaurant. We looked at all of the reviews available and decided to give The Curry Culture a try, as one review’s we read had mentioned that they used breast of chicken at the request of a customer. When we arrived at the restaurant we were shown to our table by the very friendly staff. We had already pre booked via online and placed our request for chicken breast which the staff discussed with us. We looked at the menu and had a “one bite” snack then ordered a chicken tikka starter and a chicken tikka masala for the main.
The starter and main was amazing, so much so that we returned the following day. All of the staff were excellent, the owner and the chef took time to come over and talk to us, making our time at the restaurant very memorable. 5 star service, 5 Star food. Anyone visiting Singapore and wanting Indian food must try The Curry Culture.

Ian and Tracy"
Great food and even better service,Food is great but I would highly rate the service. They serve food with all smiles and such passion that makes you feel really good. We ordered a dish on the servers recommendation. However we didn’t like it and ordered another dish. They saw us not having the dish they recommended and were courteous enough to change the same without us even requesting it. Something that is not so common for standalone restaurants. Only thing that I didn’t like was that Zomato showed they are open all day . However they have their limited working hours so should get it corrected online. Highly recommended Indian restaurant in Singapore!!!
Great Indian Food.....I am still licking my fingers,"The food at Curry Culture is just too delicious.I am still chewing the wonderful taste which is still on my fingers.The staff including the owner of the place are all very warm and helpful.The service is good.Food is awesome.
There is a smoking corner just before you enter the row of restaurants.
Lovers of Indian food , The Curry Culture on Cuppage Road is a must visit"
Great curry,"Love the food here, and the curry is totally different from expected. Relatively priced and affordable, good to come here and eat with family"
"Great food, location and nice people",Wonderful restaurant. The owner came by and chatted with me and made me feel welcome. The lamb biryani was perfect as was the naan bread. You'll love the location being on a cute side street off of Orchard. Also the restaurant is very attractive in a casually elegant way. My photo is messy but the food was great.
Excellent flavours from India,"Came here based on TripAdvisor reviews and highly delighted. Great atmosphere sitting outside in the shared communal dining area. Bucketed down with rain but we were kept completely dry. Eggplant dish is outstanding as was the chicken dish from the specials board. Fabulous service. Well done guys, highly recommend."
Best Curry Ever,"I’d be lying if I said this wasn’t the best curry I’ve ever eaten. It was so goo I re-ordered. A great selection of options, the staff was both helpful and eager to offer suggestions. Highly recommended."
Really good and tasty food!,"Again a very good experience! Really good and well-made Indian food, very tasty, and very good service all around! The tandoori chicken was moist and juicy! After 9 years in Singapore, this is definitely one of my favourite Indian restaurants."
Good food,"One of the famous Indian cuisine restaurant where the menu is typical North Indian and so is the Ambience, the murgh malai tikka and seekh kebab were succulent, butter chicken was different from what one gets in Delhi, bhuna gosht also same the breads were good, service was slow but courtesy levels were good, at lunch time it was only having few guests though."
"Tasty, original and fresh dishes","Friendly, well run restaurant in popular foodie area with lots of people out enjoying life. Menu caters for wide range of tastes and all dishes are well prepared and tasty. Good selection of Lamb especially. Even has a decent wine list too unusually."
Hidden Gem,"Just off Orchard Rd is Cuppahe St, half way down this street packed with restaurants is Curry Culture. It has indoor and outdoor seating. We sat outside early evening and thoroughly enjoyed the food and service. Highlights were the Ginger and Curry Leaf Lassi - very refreshing, Prawn Malabar Masala and the Papdi Chat.
Well worth deviating off Orchard Rd."
could have been better,situated in the area where there are lot of restaurants we visited this place only based on the ranking as we wanted to eat Indian food and this was the nearest to the place where we were > nothing so special about this place the food was good > the cocktails not at all good the names were so exotic we felt we will get something good but were just ordinary and we can make better ones at home even > they close early and gave us information that we will not take any more orders after such time could have been politer would have been better even their service was not so efficient > the toilets were awful
Lovely authentic Indian food,"We loved our meal here - the authentic Indian food, service and the vibrant atmosphere when sitting outside. Definitely recommended!"
Great dinner,We had after a long time a great dinner in Curry Culture. The food is still delicious and the service extraordinary. Mixed meat and vegetarian platter plus plain nan and butter chicken and mutton were our choices today. Would always come back again!
Dnner,"Newish style restaurant here to repack the old trusted
Not sure it’s worked
They grade the heat of the curry 1-10 which I’ve never seen before
5 should be a middle but it’s not it’s hot
4 is still very hot"
Great Authentic Indian,"Spotted the curry culture on trip advisor and thought it should be worth a visit. We were certainly not disappointed. We were not sure of the curries on the menu so we asked the waiter to pick a curry to match our tastes and wow. The curry had excellent flavours and perfect heat. The best part was at the end, they take out a tray of seed etc, which will freshen breath and settle stomach. Have never seen this before and is a great idea."
Very nice curry,We went for a walk to Cuppage terrace and weren't sure what we fancied to eat and ended up here. It was very nice and the manager was very helpful with the menu. It was a little on the hot side spice wise but very enjoyable all the same .Worth a visit.
DELICIOUS INDIAN FOOD,"This is a small casual restaurant on a very busy street offering excelent indian food and
service. We really enjoyed every dish that we ordered.
I dont like very spicy food, yet enjoyed every bite."
Saturday lunch,"Extremely good variety of curry. I took a Bhuna Gosht and it was heavenly. It was spicy but not too much and same time very tender and some sweetness on it. Just how it should be. These people really know how to make good curry.

They have also some vindaloo and other dishes which are marked as spicy and I am wondering how hot they will be. Watch out before ordering those."
Great food and atmosphere,"The food was delicious!
I absolutely loved the Butter chicken.,, and unlike some restaurants in Singapore where the butter chicken is spicy.. not here!
It's creamy and delicious!!!"
Classy spin on authentic Indian,"Excellent option for Indian food within the hustle and bustle around Orchard. I originally went over to Little India in search of dinner, but was less than thrilled with the lack of cleanliness in that area. I made the right choice to skip over to The Curry Culture. Highly recommended, and tons of choices for vegetarians. Customer service was wonderful, and accommodating. They even split the curry dishes for my solo dining. Be weary that even “mild” spice can be intense."
You want it hot? You get it!,"Coming again and happy, even my tears falling down. excellent curry, excellent veges. And very kind and helpful service."
Lovely curries and most of them are gluten free,"We went here twice on our trip as the curries were delicious and most of them were gluten free. The staff were all very helpful and gluten free aware. We enjoyed the chicken jalfrezi and prawns stuffed with crab.

Tip for restaurant - put gluten free on your website and menu to help us coeliacs who are trying to find safe gf places to eat"
Indian food at its best.,"The service was professional, friendly and swift. The price was reasonable enough for Singapore. The setting was cool and relaxed.

Now for the food. We had Butter chicken and chicken Jalfrezi with garlic naan and some rice. It was easily some of the best indian me and my husband have ever had. The butter chicken was alittle mild for our taste but smooth and bloody beautiful regardless. The Jalfrezi was superb, no other words needed.

Go during happy hour which was 5-7pm for 2 for 1 alcoholic beverages."
"Lovely food, friendly people, but the service needs a tune-up.","I visited Curry Culture this evening with a friend after reading its excellent reviews on here.

We were greeted by the friendly owner and our order was taken quickly. This restaurant is outdoors in a lovely busy area, with lots going on, and had a really nice feel.

I ordered a jalfrezi and my friend ordered paneer tandoori, with rice and a naan each. I was surprised by how quickly my meal arrived, along with my friend’s rice and naan. But his main dish didn’t arrive, and the waiter said it was just coming.

We waited a bit, until I unfortunately had to start my meal before it went cold. It took a full ten minutes before his meal arrived, with him having to watch me eat mine in the meantime, which I felt bad about. The waiter said he was sorry it was late, and asked if we would like a hot naan to replace the one that had gone cold. This seemed a reasonable gesture to make up for a very late meal.

It’s fair to say that once we had it all, the food was delicious - we both enjoyed it very much.

After a nice chat with the owner as we paid our bill, we walked away and I looked at my receipt... to find we had been charged for the extra naan.

We paid $120 dollars for this meal, which is not cheap. For that price I expect good food and efficient service. It just isn’t good enough to bring meals ten minutes apart leaving side dishes to go cold, then bring a fresh naan to replace the cold one and add it to the bill! Rule one is to bring meals out together. Rule two is to make up for mistakes. We left disappointed."
"Great Place, Great Atmosphere!",Delicious food in an al fresco food market with a real buzz about it. I liked it so much the first night that I went back a couple more times during my stay. Excellent service and a great vibe. Be careful with the vindaloo though - you can have a heat strength choice of 1-5. I chose 3 but they served up a 2 and I'm glad they did as even this was searingly spicy! The rotes are so light that 1 just isn't enough and there are such a range of vegetarian dishes I will be certain to go back when I am next in town to sample more of their offerings and wash it down with some more ice cold Tiger beers. Recommended!
"Excellent, excellent curry at reasonable price.","Ate here by myself on a recent business trip and the manager helpfully suggested I take small portions so that I could enjoy a wider variety of flavour. Enjoyed a chicken tikka and a lamb dish...plus a small dhal.
Couple of beers plus naan and the bill fo S$85 was reasonable for me...given the high quality of the produce and the curries themselves.
I will defiantly return on my next visit to Singapore....and next time take some Singaporean friends.
The beers incidentally were ice cold...just perfect."
Good food but a bit expensive,"Great location near the shops on Orchard Road. We sat outside were happy with the setting. For starters we had the vegetable samosa (highly recommend, this was amazing) and chicken pakora. For mains we had the butter chicken and lamb korma which were both good and reasonable portion sizes (sized properly for one person). Although we enjoyed the food it is overpriced."
Fab curry in the outdoor,"Met a friend of mine for dinner and chose here, we were revisiting the past, when Cuppgae road was a road with a huge market building on one side. The service was good, we had to move twice due to fans and lights, but the staff were great with it. The food was really good, some of it was Punjabi and it was so nice to be able to try a curry from a different area, and not done in the Uk. The only down side was their wine was really expensive, followed by football starting on the screen in the pub next door. So time to leave. The next visit will be mid week no sports. Not their fault but does detract from enjoying the meal."
Quality Indian fare in a bustling area,Menu was varied however was hoping for more vegetarian options. I ordered the paneer curry which was very flavorful and delicious. Along with that I was very appreciative of the vegetarian mushroom basmati option. The cheese naan was a nice treat as well. Wine list could be expanded a bit by the glass. Service was in point. The outside dining area is quite the hustling and bustling area. Lots of energy around.
Authentic Indian Food with great service,"Visited the restaurant today for dinner. One thing very positive about this restaurant, is its location next to the Orchard Road. So you can finish shopping and then head straight to this restaurant for a good sumptuous dinner or lunch. Walking time from Takashimaya Mall is about 7-10 minutes.

Food here is great in taste and you will never miss the Indian masalas. What was also awesome and commendable about this restaurant was, that if in case you are solo, and you cannot eat all that quantity of food served to you, they also serve you half plates and charge you the half amount as well.

It's location is in a food court and service is prompt. The restaurant charges you service charge as well.

Cheers."
The best!,"We have had Indian food all over the world, and this is the best yet. Service was good, and we enjoyed the outdoor seating atmosphere. I had read a couple reviews complaining about the location? The food is amazing! I love spicy food, and the chicken vindaloo did not disappoint. My wife had chicken tiki masala, and we had raita and saffron basmati rice. We also had the crispy battered mushrooms to start, and homemade mango ice cream for desert...everything was excellent. It is a little pricy, but from what I’ve seen, comparable for similar in Singapore."
good food but,good food and average prices for singapore. two complaints. i ordered a glass of water and it never came. secondly after my meal even while reading my book at good 20 minutes passed with empty dishes sitting on the table. only when i asked for the check did they take dishes away. pet peeve of mine from working in restaurants.
good food and service,"we stopped in last night ... service was attentive and food was tasty and appropriately portioned. inside seating was a bit dreary, outside is in a food court atmosphere. overall, only comment is price is a bit high, comparatively speaking. resto is one block off orchard st. between the holiday inn and hotel jen orchardgateway in the middle of a food court."
Excellent food,"Their food is so delicious and mostly they served nice curry with medium price. But unfortunately, theirs space too wide. Also nice place to discuss with friend and I recommend that you come to this place !!!"
"Location OK , Good taste , Expensive","Pros :

1) Good tasty Indian food ,

2) location is ok , near to orchid road ,

3) good variety of food

cons

1) ambiance is not pretty comfortable , as it exist near bars etc , (so not really family place) ,

2) Hell expensive ,"
Ordinary food that’s overpriced,"We ordered home delivery from this restaurant after reading good reviews and expecting something great considering higher than the price of similar restaurants. The food was ordinary (not bad) , but not worth the price given every other Indian restaurant in Singapore offers you similar food at half the price."
Regulars.. they changed the menu,"Still good but some of my favorites are no longer available on the menu but if they can, the chefs will make them.

The food is good, the service is excellent. If you want an easy, casual curry it’s a great choice. There are options for carnivores and veggies and if you like your head blown off with the heat of the curry just ask!

I’ll be back here again next time I’m in Singapore."
