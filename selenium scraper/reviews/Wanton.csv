Noodles and drinks!,"I frequent this place because the owners here are cool (you have you look for Benson for his easy laughs and chatter). You gotta try the basic noodles, and order the side dishes!"
Wantan Seng express at Guocoland,"The ingredients and presentation are more ‚Äú high end‚Äù looking than the ones at hawker centres. Quality of char siew, mushroom and wantans is good . Worth paying a little more. Starting price from sgd5.80."
For the ultimate pig üê∑ lover,"Amazing quick quality service, exceptional value for money! Super yummy üòã piggy üê∑ dishes. Our food was so good our table was bare! üòÑ"
Delicious wanton noodles and tapas,"Their wanton noodles were delicious and not too oily. Great atmosphere if you want some clean, local Singaporean food!"
GREAT FOOD,"I went to try the wonton noodles here and had a very pleasant time. The food was extremely good, it wasn‚Äôt too oily or fatty which made it very enjoyable. The atmosphere and service was great. I would certainly recommend."
Wanton,The food was not bad but a little pricey for the portions given. The chrysanthemum vodka was the best!
So good you cannot miss !,"Got a table at this funky little noodle bar for a friends gathering and it blew our mind! Noodle texture and bite is fantastic, char Siew is sinfully awesome and each and every dish we tried is a unique, funky and modern take on good old traditional local food that absolutely delivers. You have to try it for yourself! Staff were friendly and it does get really busy during peak hours and get there early to snag a table!"
Layover feast,Just having a few hours in Singapore we decided to stop by the little noodle bar. Really pleased we did. Delicious food and friendly staff it was the perfect stop for us to enjoy a respite between flights
The best wanton and budget friendly in SG,"We ordered egg and rice noodles, roasted pork, kimchi, wanton and we LOVE it. The soup was so tasty you can drink a lot if it. Service was good and ambience and resto is clean. Super recommended and delicious food"
Oodles of noodles,"A filling and hearty local option if you're in the area. Each noodle bowl comes with a good amount of noodles and ingredients, a soup flask on each table, and lots of condiments. It was a bit warm in the restaurant so not super comfortable when eating hot noodles and drinking hot soup, but worth it! Make sure to head down early to snag a table, as it can get crowded during lunch."
I have to leave a review each time I visit!,"Cool place, cool staff - I probably say the same thing everytime. But here's the catch this time they've got a new menu (more towards the platter side of bites, value for money) but it's still made with love!!!"
Not what we expected,"We saw this restaurant featured on Delicious Destinations so thought we'd try it while we were in Singapore. The food was good enough, but not memorable. The service was definitely lacking. It was like they couldn't care any less whether we ate there or not. We might have had a second drink or ordered more food had anyone ever asked or even looked our way.."
Hawker-fast AND delicious!!,"Great meal and every dish was expertly executed! We loved the char siew, kai lan, fried wantons (the chicken wings were a wee bit ordinary next to all the outstanding dishes!) and of course The Noodles, which were delightfully springy and super tasty ... exactly how they used to taste back in the good ole lardy days. The help-yourself crispy lard bowl is genius. Even though it's packed, you feel like you're in a modern izakaya in Tokyo, taking in the great vibe, music and attentive service."
"Cool vibe, great menu idea","I also enjoy myself when at Wanton! I love the bar vibe (and small seating capacity), the staff is always no-nonsense. The menu is also a great idea (to order a bowl of noodles and you pick all your meaty, veggie, dumpling sides). Good intro to the wanton noodle for SG newbies or tourists - deconstructed wanton noodle dish!
My last trip was made better with Jeff‚Äôs playlist and kindness of the only waiter in the place (you know who you are and what you did)!!! every trip at Wanton Sengs get better every time!"
Fun dining experience,"Family friendly, attentive staff, great music and a really good atmosphere. BTW - the food was also delicious!"
Singapore Hipster at its best!,"We had the noodles, soups and plenty of sides and it was awesome!! Great atmosphere, great cocktails and great food. More pricey but well worth it. The pork belly was amazing and the noodles and broth were out of this world!!"
Flavorful dishes,I've been waiting to visit since I saw this place on TV in the US. Was the first one there so I could avoid the lunch crowd. Tried the combination char sure and roast pork noodles. Was quite flavorful and worth the visit. Will try something else when I return.
Good fusion food,"Went there for dinner and drinks! Dishes are served in slight more than bite size, if u fancy drinks with local bite size food then this is the place for you!"
Too Oily,"Got the combination bowl with char siew and roasted pork. They had a special chilli sauce on the table, with another container with fried pork lard.
At first glance, it seems the wildest dream come true with free flow pork lard and special chilli sauce... but it ended real soon when you add everything into the bowl, it became too oily.

I took a look at my friend's bowl with lesser chilli, but it didnt look anywhere better.

We couldnt finish the noodle. I dont understand the hype and the queue, but the Dumpling darlings few stores down, is way better.

This is a shop with the burpple one for one as well, but i will not return. There are much better way to spend your money, and the Amoy food centre has much better REAL wanton noodles which can really satisfy your cravings."
Delicious small plates...,"Had a couple of meals here over my week in Singapore and both times the food was excellent. Really delicious char siu and green veg, the fried wanton dumplings were great as were the crispy chicken wings.

The menu is small but perfectly formed and this is a great place to grab some dinner before, after or during your night out of drinking in the area. Definitely recommended!"
Good Find,Went to try this restaurant after reading the reviews and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. Great value. Two mains and two sides alongside the noodle bowl that comes with the meal is a plentiful amount of food for two. Will eat there again next visit to Singapore.
Still great.,"Visited Wanton with my SO as we were in the vicinity. Having visited the restaurant many times now, it was great to realise that the standards haven't dropped at all. The open kitchen concept has a casual vibe while still retaining some seriousness at the same time. Sitting along the bar table allows you to look into the inner workings of the kitchen and watch your food being prepared.

We started with some cocktails namely, JuHua and the other drink that my SO ordered that was made with Pandan infused vodka or smth, my drink was tasty AF and so was the drink ordered by my SO.

Foodwise, between the two of us we shared the Kailan, XO Wanton and the Crispy pork belly. Nothing to criticize here except that all dishes were great. The $1 wanton noodle is actually q brilliant if you think about it, allowing the customer to control how much noodles they want to eat prevents over-ordering.

Not to mention the service staff, who were friendly and welcoming. Definitely will come back again!!!!"
Good value quick lunch,Short rib neef noodles were great as were the wanton. Buzzy atmosphere at lunchtime but be prepared to queue.
Hipster wanton noodles Lunch,They always have long queue. So we decided to try. Verdict: Pork belly char siew is nice. Roast pork and wanton is mediocre. Noodles is terrible. Over cook and soggy. Quite disappointing.
Superb!,"Was there with my partner on NY eve, truffle-filled chicken wings were the best bit, followed by szechuan wantons and of course, outstanding noodles! Get there or be square!"
üëçüëçüëçüëç,Amazing and best wanton dish .... u can never stop in 1 visit trust me ...more variety too for u go long with the wanton
Mediocre,Had high expectations as I ordered this via the Meal Pal app. But I was quite disappointed in the taste. The noodles were really bland - not even abit salty. The roast pork & char siew was dry. The bowl was too small to even stir or eat properly.
Nice Twist To A Familiar Taste,A local delight fuse with a western bar concept twist. Noodles were springy and broth was flavourful. A tad disappointed with the roast pork and cha siew which could‚Äôve been more flavourful and packed with juiciness.
Great meats,"The char siew and roast pork belly were really delicious. Love the casual atmosphere and friendly service too. We had 1-for-1 happy hour drinks, which turned out really diluted though."
One of my favorites,"I'm always a little embarrassed to admit I love these hipster wanton noodles more than any other wanton noodles (when everyone seems to have their particular hawker centre favourite) but I do! I think they are delicious, and every side dish they serve for lunch or dinner is top notch, too. Highly recommended."
Fantastic Food and Atmosphere,"We had a great meal here. The food was excellent, tasty and served quickly with little wait time. The drinks were also good. For lovers of pork, this is the place for you."
Cozy little restaurant with well thought out dishes,"Visited Wanton for the third time and I'm really pleased to find that the standards have maintained consistent.

We really enjoyed the open kitchen concept and seeing how the food is being cooked in real time was really amazing.

All the dishes were well cooked and the pork belly stood out the most. Service was really prompt and all our needs were addressed."
Good food! Value for money,"Good food, especially the Kai Lan dish. Very reasonable prices. Unfortunately we only got bar seats even with a reservation so that wasn‚Äôt too comfortable."
Char Siu Noodles for Lunch - Andrew Zimmern reviewed,"Went to Wanton for lunch after seeing it on Andrew Zimmerns show.
For $12.50 SD , we had the Char Siu Noodles kicked up with 3 Fried dumplings , soft boiled egg, and a Drink.
It is just a smal place with maybe 5 tables with sharing and a bar for maybe 20 more.
Food is flavorful and good portions.
The bowl came out with ramen, wontons, char siu -yummy!, and egg. A pitcher of miso soup is nearby to add to the bowl or take in a soup bowl separate, condiments of soy sauces, peppers and chili sauce.
Favors are very good.
Ambience is shabby and quirky. Nice combination.
Place is busy and crowded."
Classic dishes served contemporary with the feminine touch of a flighty,"Ate all the signature dishes ($50 total for 2 of us), washed it down with a pint of Asahi ($9, draught) and the Kona (expecting something very different, this was a rubbish fruity beer made for people who don't like beer, $8), watched a randy couple make out on the hood of someone else's car on beautiful Amoy St, and had great service from Ms D'Souza.

Customers: sit outside - Amoy has some of the most beautiful shophouses downtown.

Management: ditch that Hawaiian beer and go for something that matches your cuisine, Chinese or local (maybe Archipelago would suit, don't you think?) and give some love to your waitress. She's gooooooood."
"Tasty, hipster, pricey for dinner","How do you make wanton noodles hip? By serving it in a bar (dimly lit), with hip hop playing in the background and charging about 6 times more than you would at a hawker centre. Don't get me wrong though, the food is good. The noodles were fresh egg noodles, the char siew were nicely caramelized and charred and served with crunchy and subtle pickles and the wanton was slathered in xo sauce. But alas, you could only order a la carte for dinner and with the char siew and wanton at $10 a serving, dinner came up to $24.72 (incl gst, no drinks). May be a better idea to come for lunch."
Char siu noodles for lunch,"Lunch deals here are reasonable value, but the place can get quite busy. Last time I was here for dinner but the lunch menu seems to be different, and significantly cheaper. I opted for the char siu noodles - quite tasty but the char siu was too fatty for my liking. Otherwise no real complaints and the service was efficient too."
Contempt for customers,"Not going here again. This place doesn't care about its customers. After ordering a full lunch set, with extra wontons and beverage I asked for a glass of water while I waited for lunch as I had just walked a fair distance and was parched. The answer - ""no, we don't provide water during lunch, only during dinner"". ""I just bought a full lunch set, surely you can give me a glass of water?. ""No - It's the rules"". wtf? I won't give my business to places that are purely transactional and have no real regard for the customer."
Great service!,Interesting concept. Paying for atas wanton mee ingredients. Food is good. Portions were small but surprisingly filling.
Did not disappoint...,This is my 3rd time at Wanton and they did not disappoint. Springy noodles with great wantons (tried both versions). And the mushrooms (although a little steep) is simply the best dish.
Interesting,"Decent food! The noodles were about $1 for a small portion, order about 2 is sufficient. Enjoyed the free flow of soup. Other food wise were considered slightly expensive for the portion, but food is above average. Tried the fried wanton and roast pork and fried kailan. Enjoyed the service too."
Very nice restaurant,"Service was great!
Noodles were delicious and several meals to go with it as well (wontons, pork, veggie mushrooms, scallops...)
Price is a bit high but quality is there !
Don‚Äôt hesitate
In addition this is a really nice area of Singapour to walk around and have drinks"
Amazing as usual,"Been here for lunch and decided to drop by with my friends for dinner. It wasn't too crowded and we were seated at the bar where all the action is at.

We ordered the Chashu/Roast Pork Belly/Wantons and 3 bowls of noodles each. All of the dishes were well prepared and the service staff were courteous and helpful in helping us decide what to order.

Will drop by again real soon."
Food is thoughtfully made but not that much better than hawker fare,"I love the concept - $1 noodles and then add on your dishes like roast pork, veg, etc. Soup and deep-fried pork lard are free flow.

First - the good. Food is good - noodles are al dente, the roast pork was succulent and tender, the soup was a little on the sweeter side but hey, free flow soup and free flow pork lard (traditional wanton noodle trimming)? Good stuff.

However - I can get a good wanton noodle from a hawker stall for $3-$6, and that's the noodles, pork, soup, and maybe 2 slivers of veg combined. I don't think that Wanton is so much better than hawker centres that I'd pay >$10 for roast pork alone to go with my $1 noodles.

I think it's a great place to go for date night or with a small group of friends, or if you want to introduce out-of-town friends to local food. It's not something I'd go for all the time though."
Good food,Food is very good. Good food and good place. Good people and good ambience. Will come back again many many times
Awesome food!,A lot of people will take offense with the fact that you're charging upwards of $10 for something as simple as wanton mien but you'll change your mind once you sink your teeth into the char siew and pork bellies these guys have taken such great care in re-creating. The noodles are also neither al-dente (if you get a lazy hawker) or too mushy (if you get someone who doesn't care about his food). It's a Goldilock's just-right. So why not 5 stars? The cocktails left much to be desired and having to wait 10 mins despite making a reservation doesn't bode well for the restaurant neither but I will definitely keep coming back for my love of their char siew (and their awesome lunch menu).
Interesting concept but it is pricey,"The concept of the restaurant + bar is good and the food generally taste good. But the star of the menu is the char siew!! It is a good place to be when you are feeling a little rich and feel like having wanton noodles and other dishes with a fusion twist. We used the entertainer app as well, so it was slightly less pricey for us....."
Interesting concept. Food portion too small for price,"Taking traditional wanton noodle and giving it a fusion twist. The concept was interesting and the taste was good. More of an once off experience, no desire for return. Food portion is too small for price (i.e., $50 for wanton noodle for 2 person)."
Great contemporary twist on a local favorite,"I love coming to this place - it‚Äôs chill, has nice modern decor, good food, good music, good drinks. Especially nice at night with the chill atmosphere at Amoy Street. Great place for groups, and to bring visiting friends to Singapore.

Service is always great - quick and effective. Sat at the bar today - even personalized service from the chefs!

Food is great - a modern twist on wonton noodles, or ‚Äúdeconstructed noodles‚Äù as the staff calls it. Innovative menu, nice execution and presentation.

Keep up the great work!"
"It was good, but a pricey","I was here january for dinner, the place was easy to find, it looks like a bar with bar table and bar stool. The noodle was good, the chasiu and the spicy dumpling also good, but the size wasn‚Äôt that big, so at the end i order another noodle only, the extra noodle will only charge you 1 SGD.
The total price for 1 person including extra spicy dumpling was 31.8 SGD."
Good Dinner,We finally visited Wanton Seng after being recommended by our friends and the food did not disappoint. Loved the char siew and chilli fried wontons!
N trip,"Came here n times, standard is quite good. Only the plating for some dishes changed. Other than that ambience and service is great! Enjoyed ourselves üòç"
Very good food,They gave us free Kai lan on the house. Very nice of them to do so. Food was great. Noodles were great. Salted chicken wings were awesome.
Feedkback,"Overall, the food was quite good except for the chili that is not fiery enough and was quite salty after adding a little more to the noodles. Service by the waiter was good despite being so short handed."
Not bad but expensive,"Lunching at this place as my colleague highly recommended. It tasted average for me and i feel the price is high end for a wanton noodles, probably because it is a bar like place."
A pork lover‚Äôs dream come true,"Order the char siew, you won‚Äôt regret it! This restaurant has a small seating capacity so be sure to make a reservation before going."
The treat-yourself version of familiar eats,Always love going back to Wanton for the pork belly char siew. Even greater value now with the Entertainer app.
"Great experience, ordinary food","Came here for dinner last week and found this restaurant to be serving local wanton noodle with a twist. The noodles were ok, the side dishes (e.g. the torched pork belly char siew was juicy and flavourful, the fried dumplings with XO sauce was just very ordinary). Ambience wise, it‚Äôs like a bar. Overall, it gives me a good dining experience."
Unpleasant experience,"Went there for the sake of using the Entertainer‚Äôs App as they offer 1 for 1 for both food and drinks. During the order, staff is aware that we will be using the app, but didn‚Äôt mention that we can ONLY redeem EITHER food OR drink because we have less than 4 pax. So we were only informed in a very unfriendly manner while making payment. Not to mention that their ventilation system is so bad that all of us walked out smelling like roasted pork. Food is okay but I will not go back for that service again."
Traditional food with a modern twist,Our local wanton mee when done right is full of flavour with noodles cooked al dente. This venue has done it perfectly with a modern touch.
Tasty noodles,"Came here for dinner last week with a friend and opted for some noodles and beers. Really very tasty food. Only downside is that you sit next to the kitchen so end up stinking of cooking smells. But the service was friendly, the food decent and the beers cold. Worth another visit."
Excellent!,"I have been here more than 3 times, all for dinner. I love the music and hip ambiance, the staffs are cool an good at recommending great dishes. The noodles are freshly made and the side dishes are original recipes with a slight twist."
Amazing food and service!,"Hole in the wall find. Amazing find with good food, drinks, ambience and service! One of the best wanton mees around."
Tender and juicy meat,A good place for both lunch and dinner. The char Siew is really good. I will definitely come back to visit again.
great atas wanton mee!,"great atas wanton mee! the boiled wantons (9 for $6) are my favorite! and nudles at $1 per bowl. we got bar seats and got to see the chef prepare our food before our eyes. if you're around the area, you should try"
Love this place,The food is really good and service is warm and friendly. Also the pint-sized cocktails are my favourite highlight of their menu
nice noodle,the portion of the meat actually is quite big... suggest shared by 2 ppl and can order 2 bowl of the noodle
Hipster twist on your regular wanton mee,"If you are looking for something different than the usual wanton mee, this is the place! Love their XO fried wanton and the pork belly dishes. Soup is free flow from a warm flask; so is chilli and pork lard if you are a fan of those. Am always impressed by their service - the crew is always unobtrusively observant and quick to react."
Nice take on wanton noodle,"Like their meat and wanton, nice take on the traditional dish. The drink portion is generous!! Recommend"
Atas Wanton Noodles and lived up to quality,"This is definitely a place that i‚Äôll be back again in future! Star of the night was the pork belly and springy wanton Noodles. I just can‚Äôt get enough of the noodles - cooked perfectly to what the Italians would say al dente! For the quality and location, I think price was reasonable. Must try!"
The Best,"I have been in Singapore for two weeks, stumbled across this place by accident, or maybe not, I followed my nose. Has to be the nicest place, Brendan and his team made me feel very welcome, explained all the dishes, then left me to make my own choice. The chefs were very attentive to my ignorance of what goes with what. I have attached some photos of my couple of nights there. Not to be missed and very reasonable."
Noodles With Friends,"Local friends suggested this place for a lively lunch and it turned out very well. I had the chrysanthemum jasmine tea ""brew"" to drink, which was refreshing (served cool) and different, and we had fried wontons and boiled dumplings to start--all tasty and freshly made. The rest of the table had char siu noodle for mains (an all-around hit), while I went with the crispy duck noodle. It was great--very flavorful--but a little tough. We shared an order of shiitake mushrooms as well, another tasty treat. In all, so much food that the four of us couldn't finish it all, and very reasonably priced. The place was crowded, so I'm glad our friends had called ahead--we were seated right away. Fun place!"
Yummy wanton place in CBD,"Love the SOUP, the NOODLES, the service and the MEATS! This place is simple yet satisfying, highly underrated if you ask me. Definitely going again :)"
Super satisfying meal,"Found this place by accident and turned out to be a very happy accident. Interesting concept to have noodles as the main to go with the sides. Ordered the char siu and ribs which were superb. Moist, perfectly seasoned and marinated. Can't say the same for the wonton. They're just wonton with different sauces. The chili wonton was a tad too hot and the XO wonton was better. The soup wonton was the best of the 3 wontons we tried. The salted duck egg chicken wing exploded with flavours. The service was top notch and they took the time to explain the concept of the place to us. (we were treated to two dishes on the house which we appreciated very much but am still wondering why....). We would return for sure and have even recommended the place to many people so they can try next. Definitely coming back again. One of us left her pair of glasses when we left and the owners were nice enough to call and remind us."
$1 per bowl of Watan noodle,Location near Tanjong Pagar MRT (5-8min walk) Food are delicious except for XO fried watan abit salty.
Wanton noodles glammed up,Love their concept of serving the wanton noodles as an accompaniment rather than the main dish. The noodles are very fragrant and the chicken wings is awesome! Must-go!
3.5 stars would be more accurate for this,"Char siew pork belly was tender and delicious. The XO Pork dumplings were really good too. Noodles weren't great. Wish dishes were priced lower, and that the place would be quieter."
2nd trip to Wanton,"Springy noodles and flavourful soup. The ala carte dishes are equally delicious. However, the prices has gone up considerably. Still a good value place for good food."
More local cafes like this ...,I'm looking forward to having Lor Mee in this kind of atmosphere üòΩ Simple local food that I don't have to compete at busy hawker.
Great food and better service!,"Service was good and I really liked the food they served for dinner. Although the side dishes were a little expensive, the cheap noodles made the overall meal very affordable."
Atas Wanton noodle & sides,"While the char siew, noodles and wanton were nicely done and presented, I felt the price was a little too steep for such average mod-Asian food. Drinks to pair with and ambience were a nice touch."
Not too bad,"Atas version of hawker wanton mee. We ordered 2 bowls of noodles, which was cooked al dente and delicious even on its own. We also ordered the char siew and pork. The pork was a little too fatty for our liking though. And we loved the soup! Best of all, it's refillable and unlimited! Good to try once but will probably not return. Nothing spectacular."
"Good attentive service, interesting people!",Good attentive service and the food is not bad. Well prepared food with love! Going for dinners on weekends or would be good to book on Chope first!
Great food,"Love the wantons and dumplings here. Not to mention the noodles! It's a great place in Amoy to have fulfilling dinner before heading to the many bars nearby for drinks. Only gripe was that the music was too loud! it's a dinner place not a bar/club, the music should be a tad lower in volume then people won't have to shout to have conversations over dinner."
Rustic Wanton Noodles,Great restaurant! Food was decently priced and service was as usual excellent. Love the style of this restaurant - $1 noodles with mains
Awesome noodle and sides,The noodles is rather small portion but still filling. The pork belly is nice and portion is quite big. The cafe is pack thus have take the seats outside which is also alright just abit hot and noisy.
Fried wanton,Loves the springy mee and the wanton! Will be back for more to try other dishes. Location is convenient
Good food with cosy trendy environment,"Taking traditional dishes and giving it a modern twist. I like the free flow soup at the start before ordering your meal, the aburi char siew is soft and flavourful, salted egg chicken wings is nice without the bones in the mid wing section."
Great,"Delectable mix of comfort local noodles with well-done side dishes, all washed down with piping hot soup straight from the flask. Especially love the fried wantons and aburi char siu. Missing the yam croquettes though."
Overpriced Noodles,"The noodles are basically a version of Kuching Kolo Mee (where I'm from). In my hometown, kolo mee to the locals is similar to bak chor mee for SIngaporeans. Hence, I was quite disappointed to find that their ramen was actually just a repackaging of Kolo Mee which I've had much better before at lower price points (comparing dollar-for-dollar).

Apart from that, their other dishes are not too bad but nothing I would go back for. Atmosphere is nice but a little cramped.

It might be just because I came from where this ramen is based on but I wouldn't recommend for those that have been to Kuching before and tried the local kolo mee."
Great food,"I've been there several times for lunch but never for dinner . We enjoyed the salted egg duck wings, and the boiled wantons . Price wise quite reasonable and best of all the one dollar nudles ! Only gripe was table was a bit small"
Good food,"food was not disappointing. We ordered soup wanton, aburi char siu and the signature char siu! I like especially the signature char siu! The noodles was perfectly cooked(not too soft). It was so good till we finished everything! Not to mention, the pork lard taste damm good too! Wil definitely visit the place again as the team makes me feel welcomed!"
Too pricey!,"Food was ok, quite smokey and we smelled cuz we sit near the counter. Super disliked when they took away my phone for quite Long when I wanted to claim for my voucher."
Not as good as the past few times,Just felt the noodles weren't that tasty this time and didn't impress one out of three of us in the group. Tried the new XO Wantons on the latest menu which was not bad with some belachan on top. The new lor bak was a tad dry and lacked flavour.
Satisfying noodles,Came for lunch and had char siew noodles. The noodles were tasty and servings are good size. Plenty of condiments to add including pork lard. Soup was good too. Bit pricey but its in the CBD. It also has limited seating so have to be patient to get a table.
Shiok,"We ordered plain noodles and side dishes to share. The ""plain"" noodles are quite tasty and decent serving. Each bowl of noodles is SGD1!!! The side dishes - roasted pork, salted egg yolk wings - are yummy. The restaurant also has an interesting way of self-service. There is free-flow of soup. A flask of soup is placed at the table for you to pour as much as you desire to drink. All the condiments are also placed on trays beside the table for you to help yourself. This restaurant is also located in happening Club Area and you can go for a stroll or cuppa after dinner."
decent wanton mee,"wanton mee was decent, though a little pricey. the highly recommended pork trotter dish was a little dry. loved the other sides though. service was very friendly and prompt, and interesting ambience."
Average wanton noodle,"Had read a lot of good review about this wanton noodle cafe, has came down to try it. During dinner, you will have to order the side dishes separately. Noodle is cheap though, but the other main and side dishes like Char Siew, vegetables, lor ba etc is expensive for a portion of wanton that shared about 2 person. We have ordered the wanton and salted egg chicken wings together with 2 bowl of noodles. The noodles don't really taste springy and lack of taste. The wanton is normal while the salted egg chicken wings is very small with just a bit of meat. Not really recommended as there are better wanton noodle out there and it is over priced."
Unique and Great tasting Wanton Noodles!,One of my favourite places to go to for Wanton noodles! Less than $15 for a sumptous meal. Service was really good too - staff were attentive and helpful. They love their food!
I'd be back for many more times,"Excellent food, dedicated service, and affordable for a CBD location. Just looking at how each dish was prepared was satisfying. Thank you for the great experience. Food: 7.5/10 Atmosphere: 7/10 Service: 9/10"
