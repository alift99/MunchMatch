"Amazing open air market , busy, lively . Great grilled stingray dishüòã","Close to Newton station , we came here around 9pm and the atmosphere was great. Very busy , lots of food stalls. Tried the Stingray for the first time and it was delicious. Highly recommended itüíØüíØüíØ"
The place to go to try authentic Singaporean food,"A Singaporean friend took us here to try authentic Singaporean dishes and it was a delight.

There are several small food stalls serving all sorts of food you can imagine.

My friend assured me that the food was fresh and that we could trust the place.

I tried the chilli crab, as you should when in Singapore. It was fresh, sweet and not very hot. Delicious.

As a suggestion from my friend, I tried the black pepper crab and it was even tastier.

The dinner menu also included grilled sting ray , cockles ( a shell fish similar to clams that are found in Singapore), chicken wings , calamari and fried rice.

There were no room left to try the white pepper crab and the butter crab. Maybe next time!

Most booths only accept cash payment.

As for the drinks, well beer is the best you can get ."
Stanley at Stall 66,"Watch out for Stanley the old b@stard tout @ stall 66 and his attempt to fleece the unsuspecting.

Grilled King prawns advertised at 16 each, but informed us they are by weight, and the price now is $22 each.

He soon changed his wayward thinking when he received some good old-fashioned verbal abuse

I didn't think people like this existed...

His english is very good and very skillful at luring you in.

You have been warmed..."
"Food, food and good at affordable prices","Close to the Newton SMRT is this busy market that oozes with the fragrance of spices and yummy food. Prices are reasonable too. Just have to find a seat and what you want to eat as there are many choices. Lots of tourists and locals , so that‚Äôs a good sign. Browse and don‚Äôt be discouraged by some of the pushy staff enticing people to try their delicacies."
Frosty cold beer & amazing food.,Had three evening here sampling the delights of this place. Loved the icy cold beer bottles that offered coolness while deciding which of the many foods we should sample. Highlight was the bbq grilled tiger prawns with serve of rice and yummy chilli-lime sauce.
Don't Come Hungry,"If you're coming here on a peak period like a weekend evening or as in our case the eve of a public holiday, best have something in your stomach. We arrived at 7pm and the place was full. Took us half an hour to get a table for 4 and another hour to order and get the food. A measly plate of chicken wing and assorted satay. The food was ok but was it worth all that time and effort? Not in my view. People come here for the vibe but I think there are other places where you can get a similar atmosphere. If you've never been then I suppose it is worth a visit but best come early or prepare for the long waits."
great street food various cuisines,"open air food court and one of the places for food in singapore , however prices are bit high as compared to quieter places .."
Vibe on point,Ok so this place is definitely cashing in on being in the spotlight a little more thanks to its appearance on ‚ÄúCrazy Rich Asians‚Äù and good on them. The food is a lot more expensive than your usual hawker hall in Singas so if you want the deals the don‚Äôt go here. However the food is just as delicious and the atmosphere is AMAZING. When I say expensive I‚Äôm talking 15-20 dollars for a main which for those of you on holiday there is probably not a lot. Highly recommend the dumpling place it‚Äôs next level. Don‚Äôt be fooled by Michelin man signs here it doesn‚Äôt mean they have a hat. Definitely recommend you check it out and live your best Crazy Rich Asians fantasy.
Local Recommendation - Awesome,"Friends ours who live in Singapore recommended this place. It was a short walk from our hotel Grand Hyatt in Orchard. There are many stalls serving seafood, meat, drinks and deserts. It is super cheap and the seafood and fish was by far the best. It is relaxed, and very covid safe."
poorly managed,"This used to be one of my favorite places to take out of town visitors to explore the Singapore food culture, but not anymore. I understand that seating is limited during covid, but the way it's handled is poor beyond words. There is no crowd control or table management. They let people flood in even with no tables available, and it's a squid game kinda fight when a table becomes available. The management of Newton Food Center should be ashamed."
Great Cheap Food,Really good variety and quality. Price can be alittle pricy but worth it. Definitely would recommend
"Cockles, Satay, Oyster Omelette!","Newton Food Centre is my favourite food centre in Singapore. It is always clean and a popular choice for people wanting a large feast with their friends and family. I like that majority of the tables are outdoor which means all the smoke from the food stalls do not affect the dining experience. My favourite dishes are their pork satays, cockles, chicken wings, chilli crabs and oyster omelettes. Yum!"
Lots of variety and buzz!,"We came at 6 pm on a Sunday and found the carpark getting quite full. There were many families eating alfresco together, ordering a range of their favourite dishes. Certainly a popular outdoor dining place with lots of space and open air. There were many stalls serving Satay, Hokkien Fried Noodles, Popiah, Oyster ommelette, Seafood, Char Kway Teow, Fish Ball Noodles, BBQ chicken wings, Otak, Chicken Rice, etc. We tried Stall 51 for their Hokkien Mee - moist and good enough. We bought BBQ chicken wings, Satay and Otak from TKR stall- all good."
Excellent place,Excellent place to stroll around and grab a bite from several different restaurants. It's located right by the water. Definitely adds to your experience.
Good atmosphere and the best mango juice ever,I visited at lunch so not all the stalls were open but there was still a good selection of food . My vegetarian biryani from vendor 01-44 was very good - bit too much coriander for me - but the mango juice around the corner was the best ever - see photo ... I'll be coming back @fishtaleswithtim
"STALL NO 32, AL RAYYAN FRUITS JUICE","Stay away from this stall. I ordered 3 local coffees and got 3 coffees diluted with water!!! Unfortunately, paid them without trying the coffee and it was the worst ever. We took the coffee back to them only to find out they made 3 in 1 instant coffee packets instead of what we ordered. As we questions them, the Indian lady pretended not to understand and just said ‚Äòsorry‚Äô . Don‚Äôt EVER buy anything from them as I feel , they just do not deliver what they advertise and are out to just take your money."
Last of the Best Hawker Place for a Beer,"Lively hawker foor centre with a great beer atmosphere has been vanishing in Singapore. Newton since decades ago had been a well known touristy hub for hawker food, beer sessions with friends and a down to earth Singapore street scene feel. Through the years renovations and trends changed the many stalls here. Today, it still feature quite a few stalls offering bottled and craft beers, many grilled seafood vendors, nice satay and charcoal grilled chicken wings. Still a great place to chill for a beer and some local beer food, though seats are now quite limited, no thanks to social distancing. Teochew Fishball Noodles, Heng Chai Tao Kway, Guan Kee Grilled Stingray and TKR Satay and Chicken Wings, or Michelin recommended Alliance if you're up for some chilli crabs. Lastly go for Asahi Black or 1664 Blanc by the tower for $50 to wash all that down. Great value eat!"
Fantastic!,"We came here on a Monday at lunchtime. It was quiet and quite a few of the stalls were closed. However there were still a lot of delicious options to choose from! Not the best place for Satay, go for some of the other options. Prices were a little more on the expensive side compared to some other hawker centres. It's a short walk from the Newton MRT station, easy to get to. A must when visiting Singapore!"
SEAFOODS!!!!!!,this is where most tourist go to have a sumptuous meal of any local food and seafood you like. Just be careful with the price mark!
"Really good food, but yes it's a tourist spot and expensive","This place is a super popular spot among tourist to visit and have they local food fix. Honestly, as a local I would really drop by this place to eat as well as there are really legit local food around here. Just that I will really do it once in a blue moon and if I am coming with a big group of friends.

Some of the common dishes that I will order:

1) Hap Kee Fried Oyster omelette- It is really very cripsy and there is really wok Hey within the dish. Waiting time is always between 15-20 mins but personally I think is really worth the wait!

2) Satay- This is a corner stall, located nearer to the washroom area, like how the Satay was well balanced with the charred ends and the juicy meat areas!

3) BBQ Seafood - Basically I am not really very picky with exactly which stalls because it's really hard to go wrong with BBQ seafood. Although yes sambal plays a huge part to a dish but I feel that I tasted better ones, so usually I will just order to get a complete Newton Food Centre experience!"
Alive and Vibrant!,"What a great food crawl experience! So much to choose from so we got a little bit of a few things from different stalls---satay, fried rice, veggies, noodles, soup, dessert! There were also a few people who tried to help get you food at no extra charge. We loved everything that we tried. The drums and dragon dance entertainment was a bit loud but definitely delightful and enjoyable!"
Overpriced tourist trap,"This is a place that tourists go to. Or office workers nearby. Everything costs 20% more expensive here. And parking is pretty crowded.

You're better off going to local places like old airport road food centre, bedok North, kaki Bukit, Adam Road food centre, or Chinatown!"
NICE PLACE TO GO,"Very nice food area mostly for fish, a little bit touristy but high quality of food. Easy to reach and recommended."
FOOD GLORIOUS FOOD !!,We were introduced to this food delight by our nephew who lves in Singapore. It was so good we returned for a second visit. So many places to choose from and the food was just amazing. The satay chicken and tiger prawns were delicious. Will definitely visit again in the future. And it's location a short walk from the Newton MRT station makes it a breeze to find.
You have to do this,We weren‚Äôt sure which food market to visit but as Crazy Rich Asians was filmed here this was where we chose. It‚Äôs mad inside with everyone fighting for your business. As a vegetarian I did struggle to find some food but in the end I found the Indian stalls to be most suitable so I enjoyed an amazing curry with paratha bread and they ask for your table number and bring it over. My husband said that the chicken satay he had was the best in the whole world. It is a fun place to people watch too as you get a good mixture of locals and tourists from all over the world.
Must visit!,"Absolute must! Came here when visiting Singapore, absolutely brilliant food market could eat here everyday! Try Al-Noor biasi stall. Amazing indian/Pakistani food. Full of flavour and punjabi speaking waiters. Tried this recommendation which blew me away! If your a foodie try the Murtabak!"
Dissappointed,"Came down to buy take-away food with hubby because after so many years we haven't eaten BBQ stingray, so we went to Newton Ffod Centre. Came the man from stall #43 offering us to buy from his stall. We ordered prawn omelete $8, kangkong belacan $8, chud chud (siput sedut) $12 & BBQ stingray $15. The man was very friendly. Telling us that he was from Sarawak & already a PR got blue IC long ago, we also never asked him anything. Once everything packed & we paid the amount total of $43, he also said ""Wow! Same as my stall number!"" We just pay & go never check what has been packed. Go home by Grab as we stay in Hougang area.
Reached home unpacked the foods we bought BUT! one item missing!!! The $15 BBQ stingray!!! Really really dissappointed! In the end just eat what we've got! Was he really purposely or really wanted to cheat us??? Service like so tip-top but left out by purpose or not. The chud-chud was salty, can't finish it. Not going to this stall #43 (stall just beside ATM machine) anymore (first & the last!!!)"
Lots and lots of choices of local food,If you are a visitor it‚Äôs good to know that the city has this all kinds of local food in one place. Lots of local and tourist come to this place. If you try to find halal food there are some restaurant with halal sign too. It has open air seating area. This place has been old time favourite eating place. Must try.
Newton Food Centre - a little too popular with tourists,"After 31 years away, I finally make it back to S‚Äôpore to visit family members. We visited the Newton Food Centre. You can get all the great eats here however at an inflated price. Being that it‚Äôs not too far from Orchard Road, you get a ton of tourists visiting this location hence you pay more. My suggestions is to take a trip to numerous hawker centers throughout the city to find equally good or better food. Examples Adam Rd food Centre or Holland Drive Market and Food Centre. Each hawker Centre is well know for its food, Holland Drive for chicken rice for example. So ask a local or taxi driver where they would go for satay or nasi lemak, chili crab etc... or just pull up a map of S‚Äôpore on Google and find a hawker Centre and go explore! Beware of hours as not all hawker centers stay open late.
I‚Äôve included some pics from Newton and the chili crab was a let down but the Satay from this stall was very tasty"
Nom nom,Great variety of food. Plenty of seating. Busy atmosphere. Vendors were friendly and not too pushy. Make sure to try the crab and pippies at Alliance Seafood #27. Tip: BYO toilet paper as none is provided in toilets.
"Good atmosphere, but over-priced food","We came here at night because ""Crazy Rich Asians"" was filmed here.

LOCATION is lovely:
Outdoor Hawker center near to the MRT Newton Sta. .
Festive mood was good. I liked the vibe here and I felt cleaner.

FOOD is average and over-priced:
There were lots of food stalls, but they sold almost same things. So don't expect variety here. We ordered medium size garlic prawn. I was stunned to know the price SÔºÑ16. (Other stalls sold this menu at the exact same price. )
Fresh sugar cane juice cost double compared to one at Maxwell in chinatown.

My local tour guide told me to be careful not to be ripped off at Newton.
I had pleasant experience overall because I was a big fan of Crazy Rich Asians. But.. next time I'll visit SG, I'll try somewhere else."
We won‚Äôt be visiting here again.,"Whenever in Singapore, it has become a tradition to visit Newton‚Äôs at least once.
We went this New year, and were very disappointed. It was very busy, but we felt buldozed into ordering without any discussion, and the quality of the food when it arrived was not up to its usual standard. Tasteless noodles, and very little meat on the curried skate wings. Very disappointed."
Good food court,"We tried a variety of meals from different stalls. We liked the salted egg chicken, the pork soup, sugar cane and mango drinks. We went there for lunch before it got very busy. Pleasant experience overall."
Busy!,"Came when there was heavy rain so packed in a small area - made the place more enjoyable. Heavy focus on sea food, which we don't go for. However, there were more than enough choices of other foods and these were great. Enjoyed the wonderful experience!"
Late night eat,"Some food is cheap and some are over priced, so be aware of prices before you order! Still quite clean and open late :)"
Food Center Famous for its Seafood,"Came to Newton Mrt station, exited b, passthru an overhead pedestrian bridge toward the food center about 500 meters. The food center was full of people. I looked for seafood with table near the food stall. Found stall 49, ordered chili crab, barbeque stingray and fried rice. Also got water and coconut juice from another stall. The food were so fresh and delicious and paid 58 sd for 2 person, well worth it. Tip, pay after you finish eating. Make sure you have lots of drink as food are spicy. Client are mostly foreigners. Compared to previous stay, now it is cleaner with facilities to wash hands. Highly recommended."
"Stall 41 is bad . Be careful, don‚Äôt paid anything first when u order.","Stall 41 is bad . Be careful when u pay, old man and women have bad memory. Don‚Äôt paid in advance. Bad experience ."
Nice local food but can be,Nice local food but can be quite expensive if you are foreigner (I guess...) The seafood taste was not bad and my family enjoyed it.
With bapo,"Had sting ray, fish ,kang kong and fried rice for 50 dollars ish. Was a little expensive but all in all worth the experience with popo and brobro."
Dinner with friends,A place full of different hawker stalls so there is a great variety of food.Our Singapore friends treated us to range of nice dishes. We enjoyed tasting different things- interesting what carrot cake is in Singapore- a nice vegetable.
Average,"This has always been advertised as one of the best ever since, but it hasnt improved ever since, all food are common, nothing special and stands out, lots of choices for beer and drinks, thats why maybe people stay here til late, had the stingray and mantou, was good, but other hawker centers have more choices"
Would have given 5 stars but you have to go to each booth to order,"Wow, what. Terrific treat for dinner. I am guessing, they must have at least 100 food vendors. You eat open air on picnic type tables. If you are just a foodie, this is your place. Very inexpensive, you can try out many food options for not much money. Food was absolutely amazing. All you have to do to pick the right place to order, is see which ques are the longest! Definitely not a fine dining experience, but the food and buzzing atmosphere is great!!"
Overrated!! Pushy vendors!!,"I recommend visiting the Maxwell Food Centre for a better variety of food at a more decent price.

The only good thing about this place is the ambience at night. The food was mediocre.

Be careful of people haggling you to make you buy food from their stalls. Very pushy. When we entered we were greeted by an overly friendly man trying to direct us to our seat. Little did we know he cornered us into buying something from their menu (we assumed that he worked at the centre and was simply providing some guidance).

Also, even though some items were advertised as 70c or $2 there is a minimum purchase (i.e. minimum 10 satay sticks or minimum 5 prawn skewers). False advertising...the fine print is not even legible till you stand close enough to order. Why not just write ‚Äú10 for $7‚Äù or ‚Äú5 for $10‚Äù instead?

Would not recommend, don‚Äôt be sucked in by all the hype!!"
Tasty Curry,"We visited this venue last night. Initially I was concerned as it really is a giant takeaway food court but my fears were allayed once we received our food. Hubby had the butter chicken and I had Paneer curry. Tasty, piping hot and the young Indian lady serving us was charming. We sat chatting with her whilst we ate.
Standard of food was lovely and the freshly baked naans were hot and fresh.
We ate at the Indian Palace outlet and we would return for these dishes alone. Not expensive at all."
Will never come back!,"The only advantage of the food court is that they open late in night. And that's all it has.

The terrible part: They are expensive, but not tasty; they are not even edible. I spent $6 for a dish of spicy noodles that I could barely eat the second bit literally. The people who stood outside of the booth for calling people in just glared at us like some aliens.

Will never come back for my own good!"
Terrible!!!!,"overpriced, overcooked, greasy lacklustre seafood for tourists only!! Go to Jumbo Seafood restaurant"
It‚Äôs ok...,Standard hawker food but not as much variety as some of the others. Clean and easy access to taxi or Uber.
Overpriced and bad attitude,"Overpriced for the quality of food. I think it definitely got more ""touristy"" after the crazy rich Asian movie. There's a few stalls out of the 100 stalls that are more honest but I think Maxwell food centre is much better in terms of price and quality. And I got yelled at when I walked by a stall, looked at their stall but didn't order. Not very pleased with the attitude."
Beware!!! Obscene prices for a hawker centre,"This Hawker Centre has turned into a tourist trap because of Crazy Rich Asians. We came here simply because it was the closest food center to our hotel, and were surprised by the prices. Everyone told us that hawker squares were cheap, but a mid-sized plate was about $15 at every stall. At stall 29, lemon chicken, fried rice and mixed vegetables cost us $40 SGD which is about how much we would pay in the states at a mid-range restaurant. We thought it was ‚Äúcheap‚Äù for Singapore so we just went with it. It wasn‚Äôt until we went to multiple other hawker centers did we realize we got duped. At the China Town center, the same meal would have been around $10-$15. The Maxwell center was also reasonably priced with a fantastic chicken rice stall that was under $10 for a plate.

Stay away! Don‚Äôt let the vendors get away with jacking up the prices. It‚Äôs saying something when it‚Äôs cheaper and just as good at the airport."
Highly recommended by all,Highly recommended by all my family and friends who have been to Singapore. I went towards the end of my stay and I was a little disappointed. It was not the best food. It was not the cheapest food in Singapore. The food in shopping centre food centre were cheaper and tasted better. Chinatown is a far better option.
A Go-To when in SG,"For a authentic Singaporean food, this place is a go-to. A lot of food choices from different vendors. Chili crab was a hot pick and truth be told, it was impeccably tasty. Fun dining experience in a fun and lively place."
Avoid stall 51,"Came here with friends and ordered bigger portion from stall 51 to share. When I asked for extra plate, the Malay lady was rude and insisted to give me super small plate. The plate was so small, I can‚Äôt even put my food. And food was spilled out of the plate. It‚Äôs so insulting. The food not even nice. What I want was just a decent meal in the nice evening. It‚Äôs totally spoilt my mood."
Stall 31 you won't go wrong,"There are many great vendors here and I think you would be hard pressed to find a bad meal, but if you don't know where to start or only have one night, you won't go wrong with stall 31. Chili crab, grilled giant prawns, and the BBQ sting ray are the bomb. Prices very reasonable. Staff great. This is coming from a big foodie."
OMG,Simply spectacular. OMG this place was fabulous. Try alliance seafood just amazing. Chilli crab to die for. Oyster omelette from no 28 was fabulous and the fish ball soup amazing. This is definitely my fav place to eat in Singapore
Fun night out with friends,"Great, lively atmosphere on a Friday night. Food was delicious - even the stingray I was slightly hesitant to try was excellent. We were well attended by the nearby stallholders and the beer kept flowing while we chatted over a few hours. I loved it, and will definitely be back next time I'm in Singapore."
Juice after Dinner,It‚Äôs near Newton MRT . Around 80 plus food stalls with all varieties of food . Sitting for around 350 plus in a huge compound . Good for food and Gossips & fun time with friends / Family or alone too . Best time is Evening onwards . The shooting of Crazy Rich Asians movie was done in this complex.
Great Hawker Centre,"A great Hawker centre in Singapore, full of stalls selling a variety of seafood, satay and beers! A great indoor/outdoor seating arrangement too. It‚Äôs well worth a visit to experience the atmosphere and smell of bbq cooking."
Good Seafood and Cold beers,"Ate here a couple of times during our stay, close to the MRT.

Seating is at a premium at times, no need to order from the stall closest to where you sit, plenty of options, plenty of stalls selling similar foods, don't feel intimidated or guilty about not ordering from the first vendor. We didn't find the vendors rude or pushy.

Prices for a hawker centre on the high side, but we did find the quality and size of the seafood to be better than other hawker centres we visited. Crab, shellfish, noodles, veggies, 3 ciders, 4 large Tigers for approx. S$110

All washed down with an icy (frost on the outside of the bottel) cold Tiger from stall No 41. Life is good."
The Cleanest Hawker Market,"Crazy Rich Asians depicts this place faithfully. The food is good - and very similar across many of the stands. It is impeccably clean. There is a parking lot with a taxi drop off point. It couldn't be more convenient. I especially liked Denmark Seafood. The owner is very friendly and honest. I accidentally overpaid, and he corrected me, giving me the correct change. If staying on Orchard Road, it's a nice 15 minute walk."
Great local dinner - like a national monument,"My local friend told me it is for tourists and recommended us to go to The Food Republic. But i still can't resist the food there. The best hawker center for dinner though it's always crowded, and most of the time you'll have to wait for or share a table.

Food: you must try chilli crab, sambal stingray, crispy pork.. grab a few cold ones, that's a decent and pleasant dinner.

Service: total self-service. Choose your favorite, order, tell the vendors your table number, wait for your dinner, pay on delivery, enjoy.

Bring your own wet wipe or nakpins."
Great ambience,Excellent food and friendly service..fresh seafood washed down with Tiger Beer...what more can you want. .will be back
Wouldn't waste my time,"We found the vendors to be very pushy and when we finally sat down the vendors talked us into food that could feed an army - couldn't even finish half. A total waste of money and food was acreage, they also tried to hive us food that was a substitute for what we ordered as it was obviously cheaper. I well never go back to Newton. In the picture you will see 3 shops that work together- try to avoid them"
Good variety of food al fresco,"This is an al fresco hawker Centre as in there are many different stalls selling different kinds of local specialties and drinks. How busy it is depends on what time you are there. If you are there for lunch and dinner, suggest you go and look for place to sit first, then take turns to purchase your food while one person remains at the seat to ensure no one else take your place. It‚Äôs good to co me me in a group and then share your food to taste varieties. We went for breakfast after gym around 9am. There wasn‚Äôt many stalls open but enough to choose for breakfast. Only a few people were eating there. We had some good Malay food - rice and curry for breakfast. It was tasty and reasonably priced. Make sure you clear your own plates and return the trays to the stall you bought from after your meal. There are wash basins and wash rooms in the food Centre."
Newton food centre,"Bec of the hype which is the crazy rich asian movie, i need to be here since i am already in sg for short visit. The food are reasonably priced. All type of satay is great. I love the hokkien mee and fruit juices."
Hawker center for dinnertime!,"The best hawker center for dinner. Gets super crowded on weekends but you will eventually snag a table, otherwise sharing is caring.

You have all the usual delicacies on offer, chilli crab, seafood, sambal stingray, malay and indian delicacies and the like. You won't be wanting for choice for sure."
Local food stalls,This food court seems to be high on the tourist guide lists. Maybe it's the proximity to Orchard Road? It's a bit more upmarket than some similar places but the food is good and the full selection is available.
Fantastic even at lunchtime.,"Though we didn‚Äôt manage to make it here after dark, this was still a great destination for lunch nonetheless. The char kway teow (noodles) and weirdly original take on roti that we tried were both delicious. Really good spot to enjoy a meal when in Singapore."
Great sensory experience,"Wasn‚Äôt quite sure what to expect - think food stalls with lots of different options, big open area in the middle to eat (it‚Äôs still very humid), super cold beer and lots of hustle and bustle. Difficult to work out which one to pick - so random choose one (stall 35). Egg/seafood omelette was super fresh and delicious. Sit, relax and take it all in (very close to the metro and 5-7 minute walk from Sheraton Tower)."
Wow totally overwhelmed,Visited this wonderful food centre having seen it on crazy rich Asians. Totally bowled over by the people and atmosphere. Number 49 is the man to visit. Completely satisfied by the delicious fresh food. Definitely recommend
Our favourite hawker centre in Singapore!,"We‚Äôd been recommended a few different hawker centres to visit on our trip to Singapore but each time we visited a different one we ended up wishing we were back here. It felt a lot more authentic and local than Lau Pa Sat or Satay by The Bay. Everything we tried was delicious!

Some food and general tips.

Bring tissues or wipes as the food is messy mostly and the stalls aren‚Äôt overly generous with the napkins. Find a table first, then go order and remember your table number (one person stays at table).
Here are the local traditional stalls/dishes we recommend:

BBQ Stingray and Chilli Crab from Alliance Seafood (Stall 27)

Fried Oyster Omlette from Hup Kee (Stall 73)

Satay from TKR Satay (Stall 33)

Chai tow Kuay (Carrot Cake) from Heng (Stall 28) (this is nothing at all like a western carrot cake, it‚Äôs a savoury fried dish)"
Good food but painful on the pocket,"Singapore is a place of good food as it combines multiple cultures and cuisines. Famous for different hawker places and this one stands out as a lot of tourist come here. They serve a variety of options from laksa, chicken rice, chili crab, cereal prawn, sting ray and many more. Since it is a tourist spot prices tend to be more expensive than your local hawker places."
Excellent Food,As much as this is one of the 'tourist' hawker centres in Singapore there is much to love about this place. Try the chill stingray or the BBQ'd chicken wings.
Cheap and plentiful,Attended on a monday evening and plenty of empty seats around. 3/4 of stalls open for business. Definitely not a flash place to eat but the food selection is good and the meals delicious. Very cheap compared to most of ordinary Singapore restaurants. Highly recommended when visiting Singapore
Went on a Friday night... loooong waits,"I should know better. Friday nights there are long waits.. No queue at the drink stall but still long wait. ""So many in queue ahead of you."" Satay took about 25 minutes to get our order. Baby Kai Lan 10 minutes. Vegetable fried riice 15 minutes. (very few veggies... about 10 peas, 6 or 8 carrot chunks in a 'medium'. Expensive for so little. Been going her on and off for 30 years. Don't expect to go back unless midweek and just for tourist friends in town because it's open air. Otherwise, food court next to our home is better."
Average experience but value for money,"I visited this place after the recommendation that the locals dine here. This was quite true.

- food was value for money
- the cleanliness was 7/10
- service is done on the table (when you go to a stall to order; just tell them your table no. and pay)
- beers also available
- portion sizes are nominal
- once finished with your meals; you are expected to put away your plates on shelves where all the dirty crockery and cutlery is left (nice gesture)

The food court is very close to the metro. It is open till late and provides ample options to choose from; although there is a fair replication of the dishes.

A great place to dine with friends and family and it does not cost much."
Good but not great,"A lot of food stalls sell the same thing so don‚Äôt expect variety here.
Almost all stalls sell seafood, oyster omelet, chicken wings, or satay sticks. There are a couple of random other stalls but for the most part they all sell the same thing.
Thought I‚Äôd love it here, but it didn‚Äôt really do anything for me.
Food was average, although the oyster omelet and BBQ giant prawn was excellent!
Much more expensive than Maxwell food centre.
Just a single bbq giant prawn here is $18. It was very nice but not $18 worth.
Glad I came here but it‚Äôs not worth the hype in my opinion.
For a much better meal at much better prices head to Maxwell food centre."
Original hawkers market that is now tired ..... try the Lau Pa Sat Market instead.,"Whilst in Singapore with our family of 4 for 5 days we visited this outdoor food centre for a casual lunch on a Sunday. We were recommended to visit here by the concierge at our hotel, to experience local cuisine in a local community.
It was the first hawkers centre established in Singapore 1971 & it was upgraded in 2005, however the buildings & the precinct are now showing signs of wear & tear.
Given the standard & diversity of 'street food' in other parts of Singapore, we were quite disappointed that many stalls were closed at 1 p.m. on a Sunday & those that were trading offered very similar dishes.
The lady clearing the outdoor dining tables after the patrons left was very impressive with her bossy efficiency!
No argument about the value here, as its possible to lunch for SGD4.00.
Suggest visitors to Singapore give this suburban hawkers centre a miss & instead eat at the larger Lau Pa Sat Market Centre, located a few minutes walk back from the Marina Bay .... it has a far better range of offerings with similar low prices & a lot better standard food. Its also in a high roofed building that handles the heat far better than the Newton Food Centre."
Great Place!!,My husband and I visited Newton Food Centre on the recommendation of friends and based on previous trip advisor reviews. We are so glad we made the trip there. Spoilt for choice and everything we decided to try was delicious. Will definitely come back here again!!
Crazy Hungry Asians,"Have not visited the place for over 25 years.

In my opinion, food standards have gone down. Most stalls offering almost the same dishes.

Service excellent and now have areas where you can clean ip after chili crab.

Prices very affordable.

Watch Crazy Rich Asians and you will want to visit and try the food."
Good time at Newton,Many different options for food and drinks. It‚Äôs a great place to fuel up before heading out on an evening.
If sit there need to order the stall,In front of it? The saleman has a very fierce face. But the food is nice. Yet I am not sure you can eat from other stalls if you sit in front of other stall. But it is nice food court to try
Late night feast,"This is a good old hawker centre open late into the night. It has a stall that was made famous thanks to a Hollywood film - it‚Äôs good is good, just as it is at most of the stalls. Only reason its not five star is that the prices are two to three times more expensive than at other place (granted the ingredients purport to be a little grander, take grilled tiger prawn for example). If I was in the area or wanted a late night eat would certainly make my way to the fun. However, its likely that there is a great hawker just by you, so the journey across town for this set of joints may not be worth it."
The Biggest Food Court,Recently I visited this food court and found it to be one of the biggest food court I have ever seen. Apart from all south east Asian counters you will find few Indian options also. You have to block your table yourselves and inform the food counter about your table number. Apart from food there are several drinks options available. The most attracted drink here for teetotaler is Nariyal Pani (Coconut water). The size of coconut is really huge both clod and moderate options are available . You can enjoy your food with favorite drink alcoholic or non alcoholic. The location is very prime it is not very far from Orchard road or Novena. A must visit food court if you are nearby.
"It‚Äôs a circus, but I loved it","We ended up here based on a recommendation from a manager in a Michelin-star restaurant and that was a truly great tip. I‚Äôm a vegetarian and the Singapore food scene is surprisingly poor for a vegetarian. Here you can, however, find e.g. great Indian vegetarian food, which also tastes good (unlike the Chinese veggie food in downtown places). It is a hawker centre so be prepared for that, but it is pretty clean even for a Scandinavian. Only cash accepted, but the prices are pretty low (more expensive than in other hawker centres, but cheaper than in the ‚Äùsterile‚Äù downtown restaurants). I and my family are no ‚Äùexploreres‚Äù or bagpack travelers, but we all loved this place. We ate on the same day lunch at Michelin-star restaurant and dinner here and they were both great. Very different places, but both great in their own way."
"a great place for ""street food""",many many stalls offer a great variety of different foods. This a good way to sample Singaporian fare!
Food Food n more...,"Well this is one place which I can never forget Right from the first time I set my foot in Singapore I was introduced to Newton Food Centre (Newton Circus earlier)

    It has some really good seafood at your disposal First take a walk around the whole place and see and digest the fact that there's so much to eat and there's so little we know (Well not all but just saying) I was taken by surprise there are live crabs looking at you to have them (I guess) 

A table with a picture of Himalaya products specially made for Singapore locals and the tourist as well pasted on it welcome me It was a little treat to see it and quite interesting not to click a picture with it Colorful and Adventurous to the core 

We started out eating adventure with the very lovely Baby Kailan Stir Fry it's something I can swear by and it's love love love kind of a feeling with the very first sight of it You have to grab a bite to believe it. 

Followed with some mysterious looking Bloody Cockles some people love it and some can't stand the smell of it One has to develop a taste for it or else they are just rubber like and chewy My take on it avoid it if you are the safe eater and if you not then go for it You will love it for sure.

Next came String Ray BBQ well the sauce on it was to die for and the fish is so nice it feels like it gives it's flesh too easily to you to hog on it Simple and tasteful to the core I loved it for sure 

We did try our hands on Prawn  Fired Rice that we ordered for our low of adventure friend who was in for a shock with every dish we ordered This one was for him  but to his bad luck it was very plain and tasteless I would like to add I still loved it pawns which were well cooked, juicy and soft

The star of the night for me was Oyster Omlette very common in Taiwan and places in love to eggs and oyster. It's wonderful and easy on your palate to eat We have a repeat of the same As one wasn't enough (for the bukhads that we are) 

So the next time you are in Singapore and hungry for some serious seafood (you get chicken as well) head straight to Newton Food Centre don't look left and right as that's the place to be LIKE it's said When in Rome be like the Romans....When in Singapore eat like a Singaporean and keep me posted if you liked what you eat at Newton Food Centre"
Definitely visit,"Ate here a couple of times during recent holiday - highly recommend a visit here. Easy to get to via MRT, and plenty of food choice. Cheap beers too. Seafood from Alliance Seafood was fresh and tasty."
"Yummy, Clean, but more Expensive","We had an older taxi driver tell us to stay away from Newton b/c it's expensive. Well, it's also bigger and cleaner too. We liked coming here. The 4 stars is because it is expensive. After gorging at Maxwell Hawker Centre, we came here because we wanted Indian Food, and we were not disappointed! Went to the Indian Food Stall (I think that's litterally what's it's called - INDIAN FOOD), and ordered a butter chicken (S$9.50), two garlic naan @ S$2.50 each, and a plate of jeer rice @ S$5. Not cheap, but we ate every bit of it. The water here is 50-cents more expensive, but honestly, I liked the vibe here. It felt cleaner and more open. Lots of seafood options, which we did not try, but were told that if you do come here for seafood (e.g. prawns, crab or stingray) to always ask for the price before you order. Otherwise, they'll get you."
Great foodie experience.,Arrived early at Newton (5:30'ish) to beat the crowds and take some time to look around. I would recommend having an idea of what you want to try before arriving. I had the Barbequed Sting ray from Alliance Seafood and Fried Oyster Omelette from Hup Kee. Both were very good. It is very easy to over order and spend a bunch of money. Having a plan is highly recommended!
Great Food when in SG,"Enjoy local dishes in this hawker center. A great place to go and try out especially when you have tourists with you. Food are always fresh. Just be very careful especially when you‚Äôre ordering crab and other seafood and ask the price.

Today we had Roti John (highly recommended!) cant remember the stall name but its next to table 190. And the sting ray too was awesome!"
Disappointed.,"We visited the Newton Food Centre this evening (family of 4) and we were disappointed. The food was okay - but you can‚Äôt help but feel you‚Äôre being ripped off. For example you‚Äôre paying between SGD$80 - $90 per crab and $9 per 100 grams for the Tiger Prawns, the bill blows out in no time. Ours was $187.00 until we trimmed it right back, not including any drinks. Also it is cash only but there is an ATM in the ‚ÄòCentre‚Äô to draw out more money, that you will inevitably need. Like our taxi driver said, ‚ÄúThere are cheaper and better places to eat in Singapore.‚Äù"
Great Hawker Center,Really excellent hawker center and easy to access with a covered walkway from MRT. Endless excellent choices. All the seafood and indian food (I think India Palace) has been excellent. And as others have noted a scene from Crazy Rich Asians was indeed shot here.
Hawker food center,Didn‚Äôt get to experience other food markets in Singapore but our time here was excellent. Clean and they bring you the food to your table. Lots of choices and all delicious. A must try experience. Chicken satay was amazing as was the bbq seafood.
One of the more tourist-friendly food centers outside of downtown,"The open-air (in the center), triangular layout is pleasing enough to help you decide what kind of food you want. I noticed that there is a dominance of oyster omelette, but still some kind of variety.

It is also mostly clean than most hawker centers, organized somewhat like Lau Pa Sat in Telok Ayer."
Great place,This a an amazing open air food court with loads of choices for everyone. Indian chinese malay food was overflowing. The crowd was good and all very well organised.
Large choice for dinner,"We made the trip with a GRAB and were able to sit out side and enjoy the atmosphere with plenty of food options There is an ATM here and almost all vendors take cash only. Plenty of cold drinks to enjoy, and food is brought to your table once you order remeber your table no* when you go to order. The sun was still setting when we went so were in the sun for a bit."
Over-rated & over-priced!,"90% of vendors sell THE SAME food items: cooked the same way, charged the same fees; basically a center with very limited food choices. Supposedly famous grilled fish is over-rated, over-priced and in our case OVER-COOKED. Highly NOT recommeded food center."
One of the best seafood I have ever tested.,"Those who love seafood, its the place for you in Singapore. You will find all your favorite items like crab, squides, mussles and its comes with spicy flavor. The food court is consist of 25-30 shops, which offers varity of continental and asian dishes. Halal foods are also available. Besides all sorts of fresh fruit juices and other drinks are in the menu. Best part of the place is its Not Expensive and taste of the food is AWESOME!"
Amazing choice!,"This popular hawker center has been delighting locals and visitors to Singapore since the 70s.
There is an amazing variety of cuisine to pick from. The atmosphere is great and the aromas are mouth watering. There‚Äôs are dozens of restaurants catering to your hearts desire including an array of desserts and beverage.

There‚Äôs a huge seating area at the center where you can grab a table and then order the food from surrounding restaurants. The food is then brought to your table including plates and cutlery.

The tables are promptly cleared of leftovers and cleaned for the next round of customers. The entire place is amazingly clean considering the hundreds of food lovers who come here.

The seafood we had was very fresh and delightfully prepared. Tasted stingray for the first time which was simply prepared and delicious !

There‚Äôs enough parking in the vicinity and also easily accessible by public transport.

Hope you don‚Äôt miss this place when next in Singapore!"
Crazy rich foodie!,"Beautiful food court, lots of rush and energy going on. Food selection are amazing. Good food as well!. Been here multiple times."
