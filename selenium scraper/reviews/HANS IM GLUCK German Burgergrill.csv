Lunch set meal,"Visited the Vivo branch following positive feedback on the chain. We ordered two set burger meals, can within 5min the burgers had dry bread, the meat was dry and tastless with no juice. Never expected such standards.

When speaking with staff on payment, fell on deaf ears"
Delicious Burgers in a lovely setting,The settings is so pretty that it has become our regular joint. The Vegetraian burgers is a big bonus Love the taste & size offerred. Beers are very good too
Just dont go,"This has so much potential, and when you go in, you know why it is sad, and not at all well patronised. Everything is done at third hand, there is no customer service, no one actually looks like they are glad that you are there, and all the ordering, any interaction with wait staff is through your phone.
Doing the math, that means that I have to pay for the meal, AND for the IT to actually eat there.
After 25 minutes of no service and no interest, not even a drink offer, we (a party of 5) left"
German Burgers,Great German Burger restaurant with diverse combination for meat to vegan lovers. 4 choice of sauces. My favorite is Orange . And their mint flavored non alcoholic drinks.
After work gathering with colleagues,"After a hard day's work, my division head bought dinner for the team to thank us for all of our hard work put in thus far!

The ambiance is really nice and had that feeling of being in Germany!

The food was excellent and really had the taste of Oktoberfest! Portion wise is just nice.

The pricing of the food was not that expensive.

My only gripe is that the time it takes to serve the food once ordered was a bit slow. Maybe because it was dinner time as well."
Eco-friendly deco and big burgers,"On my two visits to this joint, my experience is similar. The burgers are good. I personally liked the crispy sweet potato fries and the dips. Drinking water comes for a price which makes me wonder why since the tap water is available. The grilled chicken breast burger that I ordered was chewy and lacked the texture. May be the kitchen was in a hurry-mode.Von Der Rolle (dessert) was fantastic. The ambience is done tastefully. The wooden benches can get a bit uncomfortable if you are seated long."
Worth visiting again,"Friendly staff & good service. Nice deco & the burgers were awesome! Gave us a complimentary waffle for the birthday girl; pleasantly surprised as fine dining restaurant don't even do that. Kudos to Chad, Lillian & Andre, thank u for the happy experience."
"Great food, awesome service",Had a wonderful dining experience at Vivo outlet. Great ambiance and tasty burgers. Food was served hot and service was efficient. Love the onion rings! One of the best ever! Kudos to staff members Gadha and Chad for their brilliant customer service. Both are very well trained and handled the busy restaurant well. Will be back again!
"amazing food, staff, & ambiance",Thanks to Chad who served us over & above. Delicious food and good ambiance. A must-visit resto when you are in Singapore!
Good burgers,"We've been to the outlet before, but this time we ordered takeaway. It was a bit disappointing, especially after eating Impossible burgers in recent time. But still ok with a good variety of vegan burgers."
Burgers & the friendly Ms Jenny not to Miss!,"We went for dinner at the Vivo City outlet and the burgers were top class. There is a wide range of options, even for vegans. If you ever visit this place, look out for Jenny. She was really helpful and took her time to explain about all the options available, and even helped us order efficiently. She was also really friendly =)"
Excellent Service by Sophie & Jessa !,"We had placed a big corporate order last week. Delivery was punctual and the food was amazingly tasty! we all loved it! Special thanks to Sophie and Jessa for their wonderful service, taking in our order without a hassle! They went the extra mile to ensure the food was delivered on time! Will definitely place our order with Hans Im Gluck again! Thank you once again Sophie and Jessa!"
Excellent service and food,Thank you Ivan and the team. They are a wonderful crew who gave this place a magical experience. Food is also great !
Excellent service and food!,"We are first timers on this restaurant and i would say it was excellent value for money! Great service, quality food and good ambiance! 10/10!"
Unpleasant service restaurant Manager - Chad,"Have been a frequent patron of this establishment and recently had a terrible experience with a manager named Chad at the vivocity branch.

After ordering our meals and awaiting our food to arrive, I was having a few bites from a packet of opened chips and chatting with colleagues, when we were very rudely interrupted by Chad who instructed me in a very unpleasant tone not to have outside food in the premises. After telling him that we had already placed our orders and were awaiting our food to arrive, and I was snacking due to hunger, he was still extremely rude and adamant about the policy.

He also interrupted our conversations a few times to instruct another colleague to put on a mask ""properly"".

As I could not tolerate his rudeness further and asked for his name to make a complaint, Chad also provided his name unwillingly and had to be pressed twice for it, finally revealing that he was the ""manager"" and challenged the table to submit a feedback.

Whenever he walked past our table thereafter, he was continually giving dirty looks at us.

This is the first time I've encountered such unprofessional behaviour from a management level staff from an establishment. The junior service staff in black however, were very much more pleasant and service oriented.

It's very hard to recommend this place after such a terrible experience."
Bad service,"I brought my son for dinner. Waited in the queue for sometime. When reached our turn the waitress serving at the front who appeared quite rude told us there is only counter seat. As my son was really eager to have the burger so I agreed. After walked in I was told it is a outdoor seat. They didn’t apologise for their mistake yet argued I heard wrongly. Even my son heard what waitress said was clearly counter seat few times.

Real disappointment with the waitresses not only the one serving at the front and the the other waitress as well!!!!

Will not visit this place anymore!"
Bad,We have been there to eat as people suggested to us. Service was horrible staff not attentive and takes log time to take order. Food it is ok but not worth it for the price for sure. I think is to expensive for what you get.
"Good food, but terrible service","It was the first time I brought my family as I have come before with friends and enjoyed their food. However, it was also my first time using the online ordering system which was terrible.

There were 5 of us, and it would not load on any of our phones as the network was very poor inside the restaurant. When it finally loaded on 1 phone, we had a hard time going through all the options on 1 phone among 5 people, with so many options with unfamiliar names. Throughout this, we tried to get help from the staff, who gave very condescending responses about our IT skills.

When we decided our order, and were halfway through ordering on the online system, it suddenly hung. We could not click anything and asked the staff for help again. Once again, we received very condescending remarks and finally she agreed to help us by using her own phone. However, even when helping us, she was very impatient and rude. We don't have the menu memorised and took some time to recall the 5 different orders with German names and the many different meal options. She kept rudely rushing us and made the experience very unpleasant. We were there to celebrate a birthday and this ruined our moods.

I understand that the use of online systems is new for everyone, both customers and staff, during these unprecedented times. But the least we could do is be understanding and patient towards each other.

I really enjoy the food and ambience here. However, this unpleasant experience will make me think twice before choosing to come here again."
Good Food & service...,Have been there multiple times with family .. Always had good food and value for money. My kids also love the place. One of the very few places for repeat visits...
over hyped .. not worth going,"the ordering system on app is a nightmare and they dont even bring what is ordered. good comes at different time whenever suits kitchen.
staff service in general is very poor and it takes 10 minutes to get attention when you want something. some tables very small.
the beef patty is bland and no better than McDonalds ... for the money go there, service better and quicker.
i have no idea how people give 5 stars unless they never been yo a good place
over hyped .. certainly not worth money or effort"
Great vegetarian food but a terrible ordering process,"Why oh why oh why have an app that doesn't work and then have to include all the staff in the ordering process? I know what you could do, have staff take the order and cut out the middle man or app in this case!!!!

Apps don't make you more productive when they don't work!

Every table around us had the same problem, one table's entire order for 5 people was taken by the waitress because they gave up trying to work the app!

The app doesn't remember and kicks you out all the time so you have to start from scratch all the time and it doesn't let you exclude more than one ingredient so you have to ask a member of staff, half the time it just freezes and you need reboot it.

Just don't have it!

I do love the vegan burgers and the vegetarian options though and that's why I came and why I order on FoodPanda too, the best range in SIngapore.

The staff are also all very friendly and fast, well they have to be because the app breaks down so much!

Love the burgers though!"
Worst Service ever,"I've never been to this place and thought, with a media colleague, I will hop over given its central location.

My, was it a bad decision.

Started thankfully with a host who walked me in. After which, I wanted to use the chope exclusive deal but have no clue what the burgers are, where it is on the digital menu and whether to order through the app.

It appears that they are badly understaffed. No one attended to us. And when this Indian girl does, she was grumpy, barked at me, and hardly paying attention to our table.

The worse was calling for a bill. Motioned to a young boy and saw me. And waited 10 to 15min, no sign of him coming over. So we both walked towards the bar and during that walk, a few servixlce staff just ignored us.

I could have just walked out without paying. But I was nice to stop the same boy and asked if he is keen to present the bill to me. He performed that transaction with no smile, no thanks. And I'm totally disgusted with my media friend.

I think even if i walked out, no one would notice or even care."
Nice decor & value for money drink,"They had a value set with burger + cold drink + hot drink + sides. Quite a good deal. Had 1 of their cocktail but it taste like cough syrup. They also have discount for beers. The burgers are quite big. Good to share. One of their manager is really friendly and kept checking in with us. However, there are some misunderstandings when we are paying the bill. One of the lady is so rude. She gave us attitude when we are clarifying some mistakes in the bill. Another guy came who is friendlier and he is more easy going. He managed to amend the mistakes for us. The lady is really rude to us and inflexible."
Best burgers,"While I am saying that these might reasonably good burgers, I am finding them very expensive with single burger costing $16-18 and set costing $22 with only fries added.

I will give them 5 points on ambiance and location but it more than offset this by very high pricing..."
Overpriced bad food... nice decor only positive,"I've eaten here twice. Both experiences were identical. Only went the second time because a friend wanted to go despite my attempt at discouraging her.

Your first impressions when you walk in are good. The place is decorated to look like you are in a forest of small trees. You are seated by the host. Both times we waited until we were about to ask if somebody was going to take our orders when at the last moment somebody did arrive and introduce themselves.

The first thing you notice is that the food is pricey for basic fair. Almost double what it should be for the burgers, their focus. (They do have a nice selection of juices on the menu.)

After ordering is done, you'll get your drinks and then you wait. And wait, like 20'ish minutes, long enough that you are beginning to wonder if they've forgotten. (We just ordered burgers, right?) But don't worry! The food will arrive... and it looks good!

Extra hungry now, you bite into your burger... and, if you like the taste of cardboard, you'll love it! Or, if you are actually into burgers, you'll endure when of blandest pricey burgers you ever had. The only saving grace is the sweet potato fries were an excellent side both times.

Oh, and if you want another drink, both times I waited with empty glass before having to flag down staff. And if you want to check both times I had to flag down staff.

Overall, this is an overpriced restaurant. If you'd subtract the decor, which is nice but nothing extraordinary, it'd have no saving graces."
good value on drinks,"besides the food, the place has great value on drinks we ordered the set offer of 2 pints of beer at a steep discount"
The Naked Burgers,"After a client meeting we were wondering where to have lunch, and luckily stumbled upon Hans. I love the burgers here and don’t mind coming again and again.

After being seated we ordered for the Non Alcoholic sets that came with A burger/ A side dish/ A thirst quencher and A coffee. Total value for money I would say. I ordered for Kraftpaket and my friend Birkenwald (both beef burgers). Initially the sides were served, Thick cut fries and Sweet potato fries (first time tasted the sweet potato fries and they were good). Along came the thirst quenchers, lemonade with forest berries (the berries made the taste quite exotic). Finally they served the burgers, I had chosen for the naked one that comes without the bread, served with more greens (go healthy). The Kraftpaket, which came with a black pepper crust, elevated the taste and made my day somewhat better . Overall enjoyed the food, and not to forget the ambience (a mini forest), definitely a recommended joint."
Very good burgers and good value,Nice spot on the water with nice views. Very good burgers at good value with good drink prices as well with relaxed atmosphere. Would recommend.
Wir sind zufrieden and .. We were definitely in Luck!,Had a nice lunch with my cousins and I at Hans Im Glück - a German burger restaurant and the interior looked like a being in a Forrest. All of us took the lunch sets. Only 1 ate beef. 2 vegans and 1 vegetarian. Grünes Gold - was nice BUT the beef patty was dry. The 2 Naturbursche vegan burgers were yummy and with the sour dough bun. I had the Wolpertinger. Overall good experience and food was good. Worth another visit for sure: this is my 5th or 6th visit but the 1st time I am reviewing it.
Rude Filipina server,"Foods and drinks were so-so (beef patty was hard) but the service is extremely bad, specifically the rude filipina server that catered to us yesterday at the vivo branch, 6:00 pm onwards. Asked her a question nicely and she responded with an attitude that was seriously uncalled for, to think the resto wasn't packed yet then. She kept that rude attitude and unprofessionalism all throughout dinner, she didn't even try to hide it. I hope you know that you have honestly ruined our dinner :)"
"Burgers can be meat or veg, and still delicious","I've been to the Scotts Road place a couple of times, but this was our first visit to the VivoCity outlet. The location is great and we took a seat outside, facing the waterfront towards Sentosa.

The service was prompt & warm as usual, although they forgot one item on the order. The burgers were tasty, with my HORNTRAGER (Walnut patty, feta cheese & fig jam) had the right balance of flavors, to not make it too creamy or salty. The KASE & SPECK ordered by my wife was equally good, with the beef patty well done which went down very well with their sweet potato fries. There's also a wide variety of options for vegetarians/vegans, so that's a big plus for burger lovers who don't eat meat.

I'd recommend you try it, if you haven't already."
Yummy Burger & Fries (Sweet Potato and thick fries),"Went with a friend to this new place. We ordered one BIRKENWALD beef burger and sweet potato fries. The beef was juicy and yummy. We also ordered the 1 PFUND GLÜCK
One pound of signature HANS IM GLUCK thick cut fries or sweet potato fries or mixed served with sour cream-scallion sauce. It was awesome.
After we had refreshing drinks of Mint-Elderflower & Mango-Ginger Limonade, both really could quench our thirst.
Would go back again as ambience was good."
One of my favorite place,"One of my favorite place to get gourmet burgers! Firstly I love the deco of the whole place which just contributes to the whole experience.

They have quite a wide variety of burgers for you to choose from and offer a set menu for a top up of $6 to include a side, hot and cold drink.

They also provide a lot of German sauces to go with your dish.

What I really appreciate is that they do have baked burger options which are filling."
Good food but bad service,Food is good but first impression was horrible. Front of house hostess at Vivo City outlet had an attitude and did not seem interested in welcoming anybody into the restaurant.
Nice seating among birch trunks,Good German beer is especially appreciated after the Tigers and Heinikens... My hamburger cover with a thick layer of black crushed pepper was so good that I had a second one
Burger Heaven!!!,Love gotta live this place !! Just looking from the outside of the place you cant help but be drawn inside ! Love the look and feel of the place! The burgers ate to die for 🤗🤗🤗
Good Service.,Jerriek service is super good. I love coming here to eat not just because the food is good. But the services is good. He made me and my family felt welcome and enjoyed alot over here. Jerriek was very patience to take the time to help my mother on what to eat as my mom is very picky as she don't really enjoys western food. She was very happy with the food chose by Jerriek and customer service by Jerriek was excellent.
Best burger ever!,"The burger I had was thick and delicious, with very fresh ingredients.
The atmosphere is very chilling and unique with a forest vibe. The service is excellent especially Jerriek who really go out of the way to ensure each customer is satisfied.

This place is 5/5, recommended to come!"
Great choice of burgers with,"Great choice of burgers with a good selection of salads , we had 3 different burgers and all were excellent, the food was served promptly, the Set Alcohol option was super value ."
Horrible Service,"Absolutely disgusting service. Went there and they told me I had to wait half an hour for a table. Fine. Left and came back half an hour later and had to wait another 15 mins before someone attended to me outside the restaurant. They ended up putting me at an outdoors table even though when I first came, all the outdoor tables were available. There were many empty tables indoors but they were”reserved” according to the waitress. I even saw some of the other customers who were in the queue behind me get a table indoors but apparently there’s some special priority seating I didn’t know about. Great.

They sat us down and I immediately told them we were ready to order. I’ll be right back. Ok. Did not come back. We had to go inside and tell another staff member that we were ready. Give me a moment. woohoo. Did not come out to serve us. Final time, we had to go call yet another staff member and waited there to make sure he came out. The server ended up asking someone else to take our orders. What amazing hospitality.

The server took the orders as if he did not care whatsoever about his job or the customers (which he probably did), especially with how he took my order. I asked him if instead of a bun if I could have a lettuce wrap. No. I asked him if he could inquire with the kitchen on this. Did not move at all. No. wow.

I’m writing this before my food has come and I am already writing this establishment off. The low standard of service here has already spoiled my appetite so much that I don’t expect the food to be much better than the service here.

Buck up or you’ll not survive that long in Singapore’s F and B industry."
Great tasty burgers,"Dined here for an early quick dinner. Very accommodating, staff were attentive and burgers were great. Will recommend."
Everything great besides the burger,"Nice place, good service, good toppings, side dishes and drinks BUT the burgers are bad. Meat quality is very poor, MacDonald's instant burger style.

If you wish to eat good burgers - this is not the place to go"
"Nice burger, good service.","Went here for a quick meal, had the set deal with drinks. Service was efficient and polite, when i asked for no sugar in my cocktail, initially this was not actioned but a request to replace it was quickly attended to. Nice burgers, tasted fresh cooked and great thick cut chips."
Slow and Poor Service,"Writing in particularly for the outlet at Vivo City. This is the 2nd time that my team is having lunch here.

It seems like their service has been constant. We waited 20 mins for someone to come over to take our orders despite hurrying them.

In my last experience, We have to wait 30 to 45 mins for our burgers to come. It seems like it is gonna be the same wait this time judging from the duration they took to serve our food.

Quality of food is so so and not worth the wait. You will be better off at Carls Junior. :)

Update: My salad came in 30 mins but vegetables were not fresh, you can tell when its not crunchy. I ordered the Baveur."
Go here if you hate yourself,"Reallly reallly disappointed with the service level. Firstly, it took ages for someone to come to our table and the service lady was too rude throughout at vivocity. Food is average. Wont be going back."
A salad burger -not an oxymoron,Would recommend especially if you like healthy tasting burgers. Will not leave a greasy leaden lump in stomach after eating. Thoughtful European combinations rather like a burger salad - think blue cheese/walnut/roasted pear with juicy beef patties. Yum Drinks are refreshing especially the lemonade stills
Great Burgers with Nice atmosphere.,"Well.. In Singapore, There are so many brand restaurants. but also, It is difficult to finding restaurant with good dishes. and really hard to finding also has nice mood and good servers.
At that point, HANS IM GLUCK prove their excellence themselves.
Nice interior decoration, Really good and juicy burgers, dishes, Beers. and great staffs.
If you are hungry at Vivocity, than don't hesitate."
Great place. Great service,"What an interesting layout. Loved the decor.
We had two burger sets. Unfortunately my husband was a little taken with the heat and we were unable to have our hot drinks. The staff were so kind and generous and gave us some drinks tokens for our return. A kind gesture.
Thoroughly enjoyable meals. I really liked the orange sauce."
Amazing burger and wonderful atmosphere,Modern decorated restaurant yet cozy and relaxed atmosphere. Great to sit and eat the best burgers and drink good beer with a view of all the passing boats. It is also nice to walk along the promenade with all the nightlife around.
Awesome Burgers,"The food was lovely, the burgers were superb. The selection of dips on the table were very interesting and delicious."
Dinner,Best German based fast food restaurant taste of burgers are “Ma Ma miya “ amazing beers amazing ambience.
Wonderful Vegan and vegetarian options,"No Impossible Beyonds needed - and arguably much healthier for it. Taste and mouth-feel wise not quite there but stands out amongst its vege patty peers. Brilliant place to debate on worldly climate matters with meat-eating family or friends, and share stories on Greta."
Excellent place to dine,"Good food with beautiful decor. Staff are nice too. Food taste great, prices are reasonable. Will definitely want to go back again and again."
Awesome Burger,My first visit at Vivo outlet. Love GESELLE burger! Quality burger with fresh ingredients. I had the evening special and upgrade my drink to draft beer. Love that they actually let me taste the beer first when I was uncertain about it. I am also entitled to a hot drink which I do not feel like having it that day. The staff gave me a Hans Im Gluck gold coin and told me I could redeem my drink any other day when I wanted to have it. Excellent!!
Milestone Birthday,"Fantastic experience in Hans Im Gluck especially with their staff Han for taking very good care of my whole family, some of them have come from overseas, when we came here to celebrate my Milestone 60 Birthday. We spent such a good time here. All my family members we completely overwhelmed. I must say all the staff were just great very nice & helpful & the most outstanding one was HAN! Thank you again & again for I really spent a great birthday in Hans Im Gluck with my Family; an unforgetable day!"
"Great taste burger and fries, good portion at this price","Came for office lunch. It is great to have a location to hang out with all colleagues (some whom are vegetarian) and the price is right for everyone.

The set meal came with fries and 1 cold drink and 1 hot drink. My colleague's sweet potato fries were fresh and crispy which usually isn't the case in Singapore, so kudos for that.

Plants behind my seat were long and not trimmed, kept getting in the way and brushing against the back of my head making it really uncomfortable to chat."
Don’t even bother going there!,"Service is bad and there are much better burgers out there, don’t bother spending money here! Nothing is good..."
Great food,"The food here is great and the servers are friendly. However, they are always very crowded during lunch (at Raffles Place). Hence, best to make a reservation before heading down. I made via chope and chope also allow you to purchase $50voucher (you pay only$45) to be used at the restaurant."
Beer and burger,"They have bamboo kind of decor ... nice and dim light ... you need to select bread, burger, side - fries or salad, drink - beer / cocktail/ mocktail ... food comes fast. Reasonably good food but got lot of variety. Worth it !"
"Staff needs training, mediocre food and dinning experience (AVOID)","For a weekday dinner experience, the food was mediocre and the service, sub-par beyond what you would expect of a restaurant. Food was cold and unappetising for a $17 burger.

I wanted to use my dining voucher only for the waiter to get defensive and tried to hustle me out of using it. They forgot my girlfriend's order and his colleague brought us the wrong order of beer, only for him to swear the F world in front of us, how rude and unprofessional!

The highlight of the evening was that they couldn't figure out how to use their e-voucher system, only for the manager to gather the entire service team to gather at our table for ad-hoc and impromptu training experience, it felt embarrassing and idiotic, to say the least.

There are plenty of burger grills and bars in Singapore, I reckon you can give them a miss."
Great lunch by the riverside,"Thought it was well priced for Singapore. Had a burger lunch deal that was really tasty and well worth it. Beer was great too, would go again."
Food lunchtime,The food is amazing however I can not believe that with an empty restaurant there is a hostesse making people wait for at least 10 minutes to seat you!! The queue was longer than the amount of people in the restaurant ;( extremely annoying and off putting
Excellent,"Thoroughly enjoyed our burgers at HiG. Burgers were tasty but not salty. Beer was chilled to perfection. And, their in-house sauces were a great compliment to their foods. Service was good. Would highly recommend HiG."
Yummi Burgers and salads,"as a vegan/vegetarian you have many option at Hans im Glueck. Especially the lunch set is a good bargain. I love the interior of the restaurant and the food of course. A burger of your choice, one side, a drink and tea or coffee for a set price. Guten Appetit"
Interesting place to chill out,nice deco. we ordered burgers and platter to share. burgers were not bad but the platter was not as good in my opinion. friendly staff.
Pathetic Burger Poor service,"I had the Klassic Beef Burger with pepper topping, it was pathetic, very oily, heavy, not at all what I had expected from a well known joint. The service is poor too, had to wait for ages to get our food served (with reminders), we had ordered water (they charge Sgd 1 per glass), that never came even after we finished our meal, finally two reminders and got us served. Bad experience. Try at your own risk."
Good Food Great Service,"Had a wonderful lunch with my family at Hans Im Gluck at VivoCity two weeks back. The food was good, especially the chicken salad and chicken burger. The chicken was succulent. Still thinking about it now. I enjoyed the great service and beautiful ambience as well. Nice place to be for a social gathering."
Nice Ambience + Excellent Service + Yummy Food & Drinks,Lovely experience with our team building being held here. Special shout out to Jerrick and his team (Sheryl & Thashanni) for being attentive and sweet in making sure we enjoyed ourselves. We will definitely be back for the awesome food and superb customer service. Kudos to you and your team Jerrick! Thank you for making our team building fun and memorable.
Great Burger - £££,"Tried this German Burger joint. Not too bad.
Bit on the expensive side, with a hint of saltiness which I like. Worth a try definitely.
Like the onion rings (S$10). Like the three types of dressing for the burger."
Dry hamburgers. Had to flag down the waitstaff repeatedly for service.,"Had passed by their outlets several times and saw them packed, so tried them out with a friend. It was mid-day and this outlet only had 4 tables occupied. In Singapore, that's a hint!

Generally pleasant environment inside, but cramped seats, made inconvenient by the trees. Dry hamburgers with a lot of filler in them. Waitstaff varied in friendliness and spent a lot of time looking at their phones since there were few customers.

Prefer Burger King hamburgers. Would come back for a mid-atenoon coffee given the great location, otherwise, Din Tai Fung!"
Great food,"Friendly staff with very good service , great quality food and big portions . A nice bar too for drinks and cocktails Family friendly restaurant"
"Great atmosphere, Great food","This was seriously an amazing experience and the price was average. I ordered the regular normal burger and added the barbecue sauce served at the table. All of the condiments were delicious and added so much flavour to the burger.

However the real star of the show was the AMAZING INTERIOR. It was very hipster I felt like I was in a forrest described in the Hans im Gluck folklore tale. There were “Trees” everywhere and every a well!"
The Sweet Potato Fries and Beef Patty is sooo sooo soo good!,"The interiors and ambiance of @hansimglueck_singapore is so well thought and impeccable, we were teleported straight into an enchanted woods the moment we stepped in. I would highly recommend getting their Sweet Potato fries which you can get it as a side dish as a set. We had GEISSBOCK and AVOCADO which both comes with flavourful 100% Beef Patty. The way they dress up their patty, its liks a party in the mouth. Simply yumz. There’s also a whole lot of meatless choices for vegan friends or just for days when you don’t feel like having meat."
Good food but Appalling wait time,"The food here is consistently good. However, Don’t come here on a Sunday unless you want to wait 50 min for your food. Besides serving the food only 50 min after ordering, they also messed up my order - I ordered chicken breast and not beef. While I waited, saw several other orders being taken back to the kitchen because of errors. Some of the wait staff are more attentive and others are incompetent. There was also plastic in one of the burgers. Sigh"
Just a drink? NOT,"I had intentionally make a pit stop here at HANS IM GLUCK along with my friends for just drinks. We all changed our mind when staff Han approached our table to take orders.

I admired how patience and knowledgeable he was to have recommended us food too that makes it convenient for us to place orders though we all have so many questions.

He makes our early dinner perfectly marvellous. As he make an effort to come over to check on us to ensure everything is okay with the food and drinks.

At first i thought he was the Manager, with his professionalism and ways of his work pace. Despite being very busy, he doesn't lose that smile when serving his guest.

I definitely come back again to dine and say ""Hi"" to your charming and most friendly staff ive ever experienced, staff Han.

On behalf of us all – thank you for making our evening such an enjoyable one! Your service were very much appreciated."
Are we buddies before??,"It is not often that I will write in a compliment to acknowledge the good services rendered. But for this case, I have to because the service provided was excellent.

This staff made me absolutely comfortable, which made choices more easier. He portrayed professionalism and made me feel like a friend.

Service industry is tough and competitive. As much as there are tonnes of complaints, we must also encourage good services and award this type of action. I hope the company can look into this matter. Overall, I will like to thank your staff and the company and continue your business.

Oh yes! Look for him in future should you ever visit this restaurant at Vivo City. I called him, Han."
Average German Burgers?,Expect to pay about an average S$17 for a beef or chicken burger. quite under whelmed with the burgers as they were quite small given the price. Paid $1 for a mug of water as proceeds were to a charity. we were recommended the promotion which was S$45 for sweet potato fries and chicken wings. seemed expensive so gave it a pass. did not feel like it was a german grill given the portions and also the taste of the sauces. they did not have sauerkraut normally associated with german food.
Great value for money lunch!!,Very pretty place with imported tree trunks to create the forest atmosphere. Burgers are juicy and the lunch deal is very value for money! Food is catered for the vegans as well with their vegan burgers. Big restuarant for event. Would love to hold my kid's birthday there. Will visit their other outlets as well now
Vegetarian burgers,"Dinner @hansimglueck_singapore with the parents. They loved the experience. Last night we had the wolpertinger and the kasebor. Both were good but the wolpertinger was the favourite because the taste of the aged cheese with the patty was perfect. And the beer battered onion rings were so good that a second round was ordered. From my previous visit would recommend the Gluckskind and Trumpfblatt salads. Also, the walnut patty is is a novelty. And the sweet potato fries are popular too. Very yumm and very hearty servings. If you enjoy, burgers and fries, for vegetarians in Singapore, this is the best option. They have vegan options too. Made the reservation through @chopesg."
A Burger Story,"First of all, I love how they include a storyline in the menu.
Even without ordering the food yet , I am already intrigued !

All that’s said and done, we had the burgers and they were awesome.
Just as awesome as the staffs who waited on our table.

One in particular, a Mr Han was exceptionally patient with us. My fiancé has the habit of asking every single detail of every single detail before deciding.

Thank u Mr Han and team. Our dinner went really well."
Sweet Potato Fries and Metal Straws!,"If you head to Hans, you have to try their sweet potato fries. Simply the bomb. The restaurant paints a picture of their dedication to the environment by offering vegan options and metal straws. Interior design is stunning. 5/5"
Great ambience & Friendly staff,"If I’m honest; I wasn’t quite sure of what to expect with German Burger... but mind you; sourdoughs, the patties and overall burger there was just Delish! Love that they offered cocktails & German beers to go with their burgers. Friendly staffs especially Jerriek; very helpful and cheerful, the music was seriously a throwback and we loved it! Will definitely be back again!!"
First time visit,"It was the first visit with my significant other. We was serve by Han. Very bubbly and friendly server. As it was our first visit. We had no idea what to order, or whether will the portion be too big. However, Han was being very helpful and he recommended on various dishes that we could share. One we can try different dishes and Two we didn’t over order that evening. Overall the food was good. The beef burger was juicy, the sharing platter we had was crispy and not the usual overpowering flour. Everything was serve on time. A very good experience and would definitely recommend this to all my families and Friends.With such great food and Han who has made our experience easier. We will be back for more...Keep up with the excellent services Han...."
A Burger in Singapore,"I'm not a fan of Burgers or the like but, honestly, I enjoyed one in this place and thanks to ""Hans im Glueck"", hwoever he might be, I could also enjoy German wheat beer."
Love the Bread,Always love sourdough and the choice of bread for the burgers includes sourdough! Definitely delicious! The beef patty was also well cooked and juicy with their delicious sauce. For weekdays lunchtime you can top up your meal to include a sides and a drink and a coffee! Definitely good value for money and nice environment to dine in with all the greenery. No complaints for such good value food.
Great Burgers and Mocktails,This place is located in Vivocity and offers great burgers. The mocktails were also amazing. I would definitely recommend this to people who love burgers. The service was also good.
Good dining experience,"Jerriek is very friendly and helpful. We had a very good dining experience and will definitely go back there again. Love the vegetarian burger, cocktail and desserts."
Great service and good food,First time in Singapore and was a good dining experience for us. Burgers were delicious and service was good.. waiter Ivan made a good dining experience by his humor and impeccable service. Team was very helpful and friendly great job guys. Hope u guys open up in Spain.
Excellent Service!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time celebrating our friend's birthday at Hans Im Gluck, all thanks to the team, especially Maya! Maya was extremely friendly and kept us entertained. He made great food and cocktail recommendations. The food was delicious and portions were large enough for sharing."
Dinning experience,"Went there on monday 13/5/18, around late afternoon. I wanted to place order but the cashier staff and a manager(Jessa) just stand there. I keep wave my hand to ask the manager over but she ignore me and continue laughing and chatting with the staff. She saw me keep waving at her and ask another staff (joyce) who's on her way delivery burger to the customer to take my order. I was so piss off as she just stand there do nothing and command others to do things when she's busy delivery the food. What kind of management is that? Does all the F&B manager act like that? Like the girl service who serve me, polite and also let me know the duration that i gotta wait."
"value for money, big burgers, really nice ambience, my go to burger joint","Every single burger was gouurmet standard, filling and priced at $16-17, beats all other chain burger options out there bar none. They dont stinge on anything. Pay extra $5 and get 1hot +1cold drink + appetizer (its big) = can be shared amongst 2 persons, really worth it."
Family friendly with great vegetarian options,We visited the boat Quay restaurant. Food was amazing with great vegetarian options. They also gave our 2 year old a coloring in book. Great beer deal but sadly could not partake.
Compliments to the team,"This is our 2nd time to this outlet and I would say you guys are amazing! The 1st time me and my husband went, we were greeted by this nice lady by the entrance you guys have a unique horse display outside your outlet we asked her to help us take a photo with the horse she said sure only if we agreed to come in for lunch... And which we were sold! And we have to say amazing food and interesting burgers you guys have! The 2nd time was few days back we came down to the outlet in hoping to get a reservation but unfortunately you guys were full due to the holidays, the same lady assisted us saying just come back and she do her best to assist us. Which we did to our surprise you guys were really full! And theres even a wait list since we were a family of 9 with kids we thought we shouldn’t wait but the lady by the entrance said let her at least try to accommodate us. While waiting there’s a group of 14-16 we believed they are families were shouting and uses rude remarks on her in front of other guests for a while i can she was turning red and held back tears due to such abuse but she handled them professionally and turned to us and apologised saying that she will get back to us, she came back to us and got us a table while the group of gentlemen continued harassing her demanding to be seated. When she sat us we offered her to join us as we like to say thanks to her but she declined her reply was “it’s ok I’m just doing my job” I felt so sorry for her then i saw a oriental gentleman with glasses finally saved her! Who I believe could be the manager I would like to say thank you for accommodating us because that night was when my family members were leaving the country. Couldnt imagine how is it like for her on the weekends it’s best to book ahead if u planning on going there... This is for the receptionist lady by the entrance before we leave the restaurant we try to look for her to get her name but she wasn’t around anymore, She has this real cool short hair, beautiful smile and a very funny laugh! Thank you! I will definitely come back to this outlet again!"
Delicious,"This was a pot luck stop off for dinner.
We were seated by the bar, the seat was a wooden & a little high & I found it to be uncomfortable, cushions would of been ideal.
There’s a great selection on the menu & enough vegetarian & vegan options which is always a big bonus with me.
The waitress was friendly & we didn’t have to wait long to order.
I wanted the walnut patty with feta & fig jam but unfortunately this wasn’t available. I decided on the spicy patty with aged cheddar cheese & avocado cream, hubby had beefy burger with aged cheddar cheese, bbq sauce & fried onion & some chips. We had a choice of bun & we decided on the multigrain.
The food was well presented & tasted absolutely delicious, there was a choice of different sauces.
Another big tick from me is that the drinks were served with metal straws.
We have a great meal here & would definitely eat here again, price is a little on the high side but it was well worth it."
Gonna try...,"It was a hit in SG when it arrives here 2 years back, so must-try for us.
HANS IM GLÜCK elevates the humble burger into a never-boring, healthy, nutritious and delicious meal .
We dropped by the Vivo City branch on a Friday evening. About 6:30pm and it was ½ filled. Very interesting setting; Cosy yet casual resembling some fairy-tale like forest-setting completed with wooden picnic benches haha!
There’s the promo of ‘After 5 special’ which included a burger of your choice, a side, and a cocktail for the price of the burger you choose plus $15. This seemed like good value and the cocktails were lovely. We were here for a quick bite so ordered something lite; a Klassik, a Henne and a Original thirst quencher
Burgers were good, Tastewise, it is well balanced and juicy without being too oily. The parma ham, beef patty, rocket leaves and balsamic sauce goes well together. Would be better if the beef patty is a little moister..
The drink was refreshing, I am not a fan of mint but the aftertaste concocted with elderflower made it … ahhh. Just well!
Really nice place with a comforting atmosphere. Would be back to try the other beef burgers or even the chicken burgers. Our experience of the service is ok, not excessive and they gave you privacy if you needed them.
Posted this in my FB earlier and garner much interest when pals saw the burgers, the drinks and the setting. lolz
Indeed worth the Accolade the “New Restaurant of the Year 2018” in SG. Will return"
Prompt service and excellent vegeterian burgers,I must admit that I've been very pleasantly surprised by this chain of restaurants. The choice of vegetarian burgers is impressive and they are really tasty. The staff is really helpful.
Great ambience and helpful staff!,"We had recently held our company event at the Vivocity outlet and was pleasantly surprised by the delicious food and stellar service by the staff. Prior to the event, the staff were enthusiastic and understanding in proposing packages that fell within our budget. Special mention goes to Jerriek and Ling who were quick to follow up with our questions and were accommodating to our requests!

On the day itself, Jerriek, Andy and Joyce were attentive in managing our food and drinks. Food was quickly refilled and we really enjoyed the hot food served!! Jerriek was also extremely helpful in providing updates on our orders and was great in entertaining some of us. The team was very friendly and polite despite our numerous requests too.

Really appreciate and big thanks to the team going out of the way to provide top notch customer service, which left my colleagues and I thoroughly enjoying that night's event. Will be back again for more!!"
"Great Food, Great Ambience, Great Service",Came here with a big group of friends and family. The staff are very well organised. The food is great and the service is excellent! The assistant restaurant manager Jerriek took great care of us and made our dining experience really enjoyable!
"Great Ambience, Friendly Staff, Great Burgers and Good German Beers","Cosy, casual setting, family friendly place to have meals with an enthused staff that are friendly and on hand to help with your orders. Burgers and their starter platter (sweet potatoes, fries, onion rings and chicken wings) and their sauces were absolutely finger licking good. They may not have a wide range of German beers but they do go well with our burgers which are as good as Carl's Jr Burgers (cost more though but the ambience makes up for it!)."
Food was ok but customer service was horrible,"visited for the first time on the 27th and to my horror the service was horrendously bad. i came from the same line of industry and understanding the fact that it's dinner crowd but I just can't believe how long i have to wait just for a service staff to attend to my simple request. it was really hard trying to even get their attention when one was just standing there staring into space.

I gotta say, Joyce was really nice even when the other service staffs attitude was so bad, they are so arrogant and rude. while I merely made remark on the service staffs when Joyce served me, she was really kind and was apologising for their mistakes which apparently wasn't her fault. managed to catch her name while she was busy handling the crowd. it was really nice to be at least served by her instead of the others, she was really helpful and patient to me and my friends' requests.

would be much appreciated if you have more staffs like her rather than rude and obnoxious service staffs."
