"Nice ambience, average food, tiny portions","Lovely ambience. Pity that the food was average, and the portions tiny and unsatisfying. For what it is, it's terribly over-priced. We ordered kroffles (over-rated) and the pork wrap (not bad but $27 was too much for such a small portion, I was disappointed). Unfortunately, I won't go back or recommend it. For that price, one could have a very decent and huge meal at a proper Korean restaurant."
Dinner on 28 Dec Wed night,"Fish & Chips was nice. I didnt want the potatoes chips and asked for mashed potatoes. The restaurant offered me sweet potatoes fries instead. And it was nice.

The truffle salmon angel hair salmon was nice. But the Korean style chicken had too much ketchup taste in it.

The seafood pancake is not nice. Lack of seafood and lack of taste and aroma too.

Hot mocha was nice and i had 2 cups."
Some hits and misses,Made a reservation but still had to wait a while before the table was ready. Had to wait a while for server to come over to take our orders too. Food was a mix of hits and misses. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend their kroffle.
Great hideaway with fresh food,"Lunch date with wife. The ambience is really well done.
Food selection is vast. I tried Luke‚Äôs salad and the salmon was cooked perfectly. My wife had another salad and portions are really good.
Drinks (Ginseng smoothie was good, Buttercream Latte - so-so hence the 4stars)"
Great food and fantastic ambience!,Really enjoyed the food and the drinks were equally good! Will definitely be back! The kimchi fries was very value for money. And the prawn pizza blown us off. Definitely worth a visit even if you are not in the area. üòä
Wonderful atmosphere but portions and ingredients are a bit misleading.,"Went here for a girls lunch. Food was great however we noticed the lunch portions of the meals on the menu come out significantly smaller than the dinner portions‚Ä¶ But charge the exact same amount. We paid more to get less which did not make sense. Also, some of the photos on the menu did not reflect the ingredients that actually came with the dishes we had ordered. The atmosphere and quality of the food was good enough to make us want to go back again but we were just a little disappointed with the non-transparency of the above."
Disappointment,"Disappointed to learn their signature souffle is not available on weekends only after having main course before ordering that dessert which was our main purpose for visiting. They should have indicated it on mnenu so we could decide to visit on another day. Bulgogi pizza was not bad but meat was salty. Krofflers were unique and delicious though.

Service and"
Great Service,"It took me awhile before I located this restaurant. All that did not matter when I saw where I was going to dine. I love being surrounded by all that lush fauna. Ordering was simple. Scan a QR code to peruse the menu and press the buzzer to order.

Dinner was the Chicken Pizza and a Banana Shake. I was thankful that the kitchen could make the pizza without the spicy chicken meat as I would not have enjoyed it much if they could not. Dessert was their speciality, the Krouffles. My dinner companion chose the Honey Butter Krouffle with a scoop of ice cream on the side.

No issues about the food, and the service was wonderful, given they they were busy. The crowd was managed well."
Birthday dinner,"It‚Äôs quite peaceful and not very noisy.
But the food were average.
Fusion of Western & Korean.
No impression of any food we had to attract us coming back.
1 of the lettuce have soil, so not the sure the rest of the lettuce we had, were washed cleanly.
They did replace us with more and clean lettuce, so we need to be careful when eating."
"Terrible as the food took so long to come, and when it came it was not hot. also, there was a broken toothpick inside th","Terrible as the food took so long to come, and when it came it was not hot. also, there was a broken toothpick inside the chicken which cut my tongue a little. staff did not check on my well being but just went off . no apology and nothing."
Long wait and very average food,"Waited slightly more than 30mins, pressed the bell twice but no one attended. When I told them I have waited a long time, I was told they were very busy (even to respond to the bell). When I said I would like to cancel my order, miraculously they told me my food was actually ready. Indeed, I was served in a minute's time. The pasta was cold and salmon overcooked. It looked like my food was prepared but they left it in the kitchen and had forgotten to serve me and it turned cold. Just before serving, simply re-heat the salmon. Unforgettable indeed.... but still I'm generous enough to give 2 stars because of the lovely ambience."
Unprofessional service,Visited the cafe on 7 Oct. For 1-1 Kroffle stated on their official website. Staff claimed promotion ended in Sept. They will not honour the promo coz it's a gimmick. What a joke! Such a waste of time!
Poor service,Wanted to try out his cafe with excitement. We went there today and ordered our food. Waited for 45 mins and no food was served. The waitress went back to check and found out that the system did not take our order. Was utterly disappointed with the service!
Hangout with Friends,"Had a good time hanging out with friends at the cafe for dinner. Ordered the salmon pasta, the food is nice. Great ambience."
Feel Like Dining in the Garden!,"Nice ambience with a lot of green plants surrounding, like dining in the garden. However the food is just so so. Bulgogi beef panini is ok but Korean style fried chicken with yangnyeom sauce is disappointed as the chicken is overly fried, hence it is dry inside and hard outside."
Beautiful place to dine and relax.,"Love the place, you feel like in a garden but air conditioned. The menu has variety and food and drinks we had was also very good. The staffs was friendly and very helpful to recommend us food choices."
Service was okay...,"Went there cuz my mum was curious and wanted to try it for her birthday but disappointed with service, aircon was leaking and yes it‚Äôs the mall‚Äôs fault but they kept faulting the mall and not fixing the problem by either moving us to another table or something... they mentioned it was reserved but until we checked out, the table was empty while we just had our meal with an annoying dripping aircon... the food was tasteless except the fries and the aglio olio pasta. The drinks were superb though, if you would like to go there maybe go for some drinks and dessert instead of a meal !"
üëç,"Went there to celebrate my friend's birthday. Excellent service and excellent food, will definitely be back the 3rd time üòÅ"
Nice little oasis in the city,Ambience was lovely and staff were friendly though service language could be further improved. The only down side was a little over pricely for the food quantity and quality.
1st visit,The experience was good and the ambience is very cozy and friendly. Staff are accommodating and very pleasant too.
Unique Atmosphere,The place atmosphere is very unique unlike any cafes. The staff are very friendly. The foods are awesome and I love the Green Tea Latte. I did even tried on Butter Scotch Latte and it's really nice!
Recommended,"A welcoming ambience, nice food & coffee. We have tried the crab & kimchi pancake, king prawn truffle with angel hair pasta, and mocha. Both are highly recommended!"
Nice place and delicious dessert!,We went there for dessert and is superb! We dessert portion is generous and the ingredient is fresh. We plan to go back to try their lunch. Highly recommend.
The places is ok only too noises for it and the sitting area is too close,Hope next time I come again will be better and the foods can do it more variety. The noises will be less the service is quite good
Wonderful place,Like the place. Have quiet corners/ bigger cube area for family or bigger groups. Like the flora that act as partition.
Great Food and Amazing Service,"Located in the Heart of Orchard is this Korean salon and Cafe. They offer all day breakfast, lunch, dinner menu.. got lots of variety to choose from and it‚Äôs really worth the value of your money. They have lovely staffs that provides amazing customer service. And lastly the nature ambiance is one of a kind. It‚Äôs Instagram-worthy!!!"
Such an instagram-worthy place! :),This is my 2nd time there & I came back just because the food is too good & I love the ambience! Satisfied with their service as well! Will definitely come back again & again!
Good service,"Good service and the food very tasty, the restaurant environment also very beautiful. The staffs very friendly"
"Overall venue, food was pleasant.",Food consider average but with good location except for the sofa was uncomfortable that require to change the cushion. Shall consider to improve or change the sofa cushion since dining was limited to 1.5hours only.
Casual Lunch,"Had lunch over the weekend, the setting was vibrant and really enjoyed plants deco. The service was reasonable. However we must say that the food was below-par, we had BBQ pork ribs which was dry and tough, the fries tasted frozen. The truffle prawns pasta was great, just that the portion could have been bigger."
Sweet service.,"Me and 2 friends mentioned that we want order a cup of smoothie to share and asked for 2 additional cups. Then three small cups of smoothie with straw (each with 'deco') were served to us, very thoughtful and sweet service. :D"
Nice ambience,"I was really mesmerized by the decoration and flowers. Also, staff were super prompt and friendly. Food was good too! Would definitely come again."
Greenery Restaurant!,"This is my second time going to Walking on Sunshine. I totally in love with the restaurant design which the restaurant is filled with plants and flowers. The greenery just makes me feel so refreshing...

The food is a korea-western fusion style which we seldom find it in Singapore. The food i tried so far is yummy and am still trying other food on the menu."
Very attentive service and good food,"3 of us enjoyed ourselves celebrating bday there! Great food and nice service, very attentive! Beautiful deco and romantic ambiance! We will come back again soon!"
A good place for gatherings,"The ambience was good, place is unique and comfortable. Food is superb. Signature dishes are really good! All my friends loved it!"
Food soso but nice environment,"Honestly i was impressed by the greeneries and ambience of the cafe as it kinda look cosy and nice .. food setting was great as well and totally super instaworthly looking. Buttt , tasted soso .. not looking like what it was expected.. it was really normal .. so i thought maybe for a chit chat with fren was fine.. not if u are expecting a very good meal"
Bad reservation system,"Called earlier to make a reservation, they said they don't do on day reservations. Told us walk in and said it will be a slow today. It's fine. After 1 hour journey from home. Arrive at the cafe, told us today reservations fullly booked at least 1 hour more before walk in available . Could had told us earlier on the phone. Disappointed"
A comfy and relax place to enjoy,Everything was good! Suitable for friends meet up ! The healthy food with salmon and poached egg was amazing ! But the spicy pork nacho chips was quite disappointing because of not really spicy as my thought and the sauce not too thick too . I had tried the medium rare steak which is their signature also no bad and value for this price! And also the butter coffee and avocado shake is great !
Nice ambience and food.,It is a very nice ambience and has good variety of delicious food. The service crew is also friendly. will surely visit this restaurant again
Great Service,"Great food, service & ambience .... only setback was we could only have 2 hours there üòí ... maybe due to full bookings and the cafe had to operate on half capacity because of the pandemic"
Wonderful service! üòä,"Wonderful service!
My girlfriends decided to try this cafe so it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs first time. The team was very accommodating coz we accidentally cancelled our reservation but we still managed to get our table back when we arrived. The service was great especially from Martin and Shirlyn who made our experience memorable. Thank you for your wonderful service and Kudos to the Chefs also for very delicious food. We wanted to try more food but it‚Äôs really filling. We‚Äôll come back for more"
Good service,Wonderful service from Walking on Sunshine and such a lovely place with the plants and greeneries in air-con. Will definitely visit again.
Nice ambiance,A great place to hang out with friends! Nice ambiance and good food but price on the higher side. Overall satisfied and had a great time!
Dining in the garden,"My first time to this cafe~impressive deco and definitely a good place to meet up with friends. With great setting like dining in a garden, this cafe offers an interesting menu of Korean fusion, served by friendly staff at a reasonable pricing. I must say that their food were all delicious, from their drinks, pizzas,pasta, light bites to their desserts. Especially the fruity souffle pancake,is a must try. They have got many more food selection which looks pretty interesting too. Will be back to try more. (Reservation of table is recommended especially for bigger group.)"
"Superb dining experience in the garden, can even buy their potted plants!!","Great dining experience, was fully immersed in their nature-themed experience that they promised. My kids was in love with the plants, they loved the experience and we even bought a potted plant back home! Would definitely come back again with my kids as they loved it!"
Dining in the garden,It's a hair salon & cage. Service was good despite of the crowd. Was surprised there is no time limit. Everyone was comfortably seated & eating.
Dining in an urban garden,"Was highly recommended so had to check it out personally. Great location & easy to locate. Seated in an enclave of plants, we were next spoilt for choice by the massive selection of fusion food & drinks. Picked the ginseng kale salad for starters & loved it 100%. The Apple tea was not only pretty to look at but tasted refreshing & invigorating. We decided to open a bottle of red & it came with a tantalising beef pizza. What‚Äôs not to love?"
Definitely will visit again!,"The ambience & the service are excellent . The food are instagram worthy although , there is room for improvement for the steak . AND OMG , THE LAVENDAR CHOCO MOUSE CAKE IS TO DIE FOR ! Good for coffee and wine buddies to dine in at ."
Overall average,Staff weren't very friendly. The food and atmosphere are good though. My credit card was used to pay for another table's bill and they didn't even notice it until i highlighted. Maybe they should be more focused when it comes to payment. Overall vibe was average.
Its ok for food and drink,"Food and drink wise it was ok. Just that i made a booking via chope at 12.30, but the restaurant told us that our reservation was at 1pm. We had to wait for 30mins."
"Great place, good food",Beautiful cafe decorated with plants. Food is good and nice presentation. Great service from the staff. High recommended!
Perfectly instagramable but good needs flavour upgrade,"This most-instagramable cafe has nailed the business model for the social media generation. Every serving of food and drink, as well as the indoor garden decor, is picture perfect - but unfortunately falls short in the flavour department. It‚Äôs not bad, but the chefs can hardly be faulted for trying to deliver on such a vast and diverse Korean-inspired cafe menu. Food-wise, ‚Äúdo less but do better‚Äù would truly take this stellar cafe to the next level."
Pretty cafe to chill in,"Love the garden theme, gels well with its name. F&B was also pretty creative and delish.
We had the Iberico Pork Jowl, Kimchi Fries and Salmon & Avocado Rice Bowl. We thought the Pork Jowl would be a Western-style dish, but it was presented with a unique Korean twist, where there was lettuce slices so we could wrap the meat with. That made us feel we were enjoying Korean BBQ (without the fire)! :)
I also enjoyed my Purple Sweet Potato Latte very much as it tasted like the real thing (and not just artificial flavouring), though I wish they could have used a bigger cup for the beverage.
Overall, an awesome cafe to chill and enjoy with friends!"
Lovely~,"Second visit here with my friend. Awesome food, ambience and service! A good place to unwind anytime :-)"
Suprising,"Would have never dropped by if not for the trip advisor page. Looked appealing, but I was skeptic, did end up visiting however on my last visit to Sg, and it was a great experience! From the internal deco to the food presentation.

The staff could be more knowledgeable about what is served so that customer feels more connected. As a Ginseng enthusiast, this is not bad, but some of it we‚Äôre still abit too much~

Satisfied overall"
Very therapeutic place to chill out and have brunch!,"As per my title, this is a very therapeutic place for me when I was dining here. Lots of nature and greenery to see when you are here and it is located in a very quiet corner within Orchard Central. I made prior reservations so the waiting time was minimal- so diners who are keen might want to take note of this!

What's really nice here is their pancakes (which takes about 20 minutes to prepare) my personal recommendation is you can get some snacks as well while waiting for your food to be ready. I got Sweet Potato Fries, as well as the popcorn chicken with korean spicy sauce which were really tasty as well.

But the star for this cafe is their Signature souffle pancake! The Vanilla Cream goes really well with the fluffiness of the pancake, and the choice of fruits were really refreshing for the palette :) Strongly recommend this dish and it goes really well with black coffee or tea!"
Wonderful garden cafe/salon experience,"Amazing cafe! Friendly and warm staff enjoyed the cafe, salon and gel nail services. Definitely will return"
Very Unique Cafe and Refreshments!!!!,"I was welcomed by friendly staffs and I really liked their new menu, ginseng smoothie and the fried ginseng. It is really unique as I haven't seen any food and drinks like this before. I will come again."
Best services and food ever!,"Their king prawn truffle Spaghetti, Iberico Pork Jowl & Striploin Steak is the besssst!!! Definitely will come back try their different dish"
Beautiful Garden theme cafe,Having a wonderful time with my friend in garden theme cafe! Best dessert souffl√© pancake & their tea is so refreshing!! Highly recommended!!!
Highly Recommended,"Great food, service and environment! We are spending quality time at this cafe. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
AWESOME Western Food,"Salmon Aglio Olio & Fried Egg with Garlic Mushroom are super nice, excited for the next visit. Great services as well."
Nice food nice hair,Always have lunch with colleagues there... Food is fresh and delicious... Their environment is superb! Friendly staff and my favourite stylist Preston always did creative colouring on my hair!
amazing cafe,went there to have my breakfast and tried out their american breakfast dish. it is really amazing! a reasonable amount of portion with amazing taste.
Garden theme cafe in SG,"Barbecue pork ribs, $24.50
Korean style fried chicken with yangnyeom sauce, $23.50
Waffles and ice cream, $12.50

The barbecue pork ribs came with pork ribs (duh!), salad greens, barbecue sauce, mashed potatoes and fries. Pork ribs was tender but I would liked it more if it was more tender; and flavourful (barbecue sauce was on point). Not sure how they mashed their potatoes but I loved it - it melts in your mouth (I only gave buddy a spoon of it and the rest was m i n e). Fries were crisp and thic' - yum!

The fried chicken with yangnyeom sauce wow-ed us with it's serving size - we were served 4 B I G pieces of Chicken. Buddy was soooo happy about it (he judge each dishes by their size ). Tastewise, glad that it did not disappoint - Chicken was served crispy (& hot) and the sauce was bomb af with its spicy and sweet flavours!

How can we leave a cafe without having desserts~~ We were contemplating between their toasts or waffles and we decided on their waffles with matcha ice cream (after a game of scissors, paper, stone - who else make decisions like us? ). It was okay - wasn't the best that we had (in comparison to the others we had before) but it ended our meal on a high note.

Walking on Sunshine Cafe is probably one of the nicest (most instagrammable) cafe in It's a garden-themed cafe and you can expect lots of flower in the cafe! Remember to bring along a friend/other half to help you nail your ootd shots (unfortunately for me, buddy didn't take any photos of me here )."
Great atmosphere,Went there last weekend with my friends. Had a really great time in this cafe as they provide excellent service and food
Great cafe,Excellent food and service and provided here ! The atmosphere is really calming and soothing. HIGHly recommended for anyone who is thinking of coming
Great cafe,Had a really great conversation with my friends in this cafe because they have such a relaxing environment and a really cool ambient
Best food!!!,"I like to hangout with my friend in walking on sunshine , and they even have a salon together !!! Amazing"
The environment of the cafe,The environment of the cafe is very comforting and relax. The food is also excellent! Will definitely become a regular customer here!
The souffle pancake was so fantastic.üëçüèª,"The souffle pancake was so fantastic.
I loved the combination of soft pancakes and vanilla creams. And fresh fruits and mixed nuts felt healthy eating dessert.
I also liked jazz music and the interior as if it were in the garden.
Next time, I will try wine with steak at dinner."
Great Experience,The food was really good. Recommended if you love korean and western cuisine. Great ambience and staff!
Best cafe,I enjoying the environment with my friend and also the food are awesome !!! Highly recommend for this cafe !!!!!
Delicious food with a view to match,"I met up with an old friend for brunch and I decided to pick somewhere different for a change! Came across this beautiful place, so we sat down. The menu choices were far beyond my expectations of variety, but I settled on American Breakfast because it was of their signatures. It definitely did not disappoint me because I was thoroughly amazed by the portions they gave, from the sumptuous mushrooms, to the rightly puffed and creamy yet not too watery scrambled eggs and even guacamole on bread. This brunch kept me full till my next appointment at 6, which is a good and healthy 7 hours!! Recommended many other friends to try and they were not disappointed too! Some of their other signatures include their Souffle pancake and they also have a special Breakfast Buffet menu that only costs $15/pax (from 9am to 11am, which we sadly missed by an hour...)! Am tempted to go back and try the Breakfast Buffet... if I wake up early enough! :‚Äù)"
Comfortable Cafe,They serve best dessert in the cafe. Very comfortable space which i can chill with my friend together!!!!!
A Cozy Cafe Your Family Will Love,"Upon having arrived on the 3rd floor of Orchard Central, we were pleasantly surprised to be surrounded by the breathtaking atmosphere of the cafe filled with lush forestry - right in the middle of a mall. After having been guided to our seats by the friendly staff, we ordered our food hassle-free. The food itself was a feast for both the eyes and the mouth and my grandparents were very happy to try the korean-western fusion food. Lastly, we ended our night by taking photos at the designated phototaking area, allowing us to remember such a great night. Overall, this cafe offers a one of a kind cafe experience suitable for everyone and I will definitely visit often :)."
Wonderful place!,This place has good ambience and would definitely come again and introduce to my friends and family :)
Delicious Brunch & Relaxing Ambience,Stumbled upon this cafe during my vacation to Singapore last week. Had a lovely time with my local friend enjoying the earthy ambience & delicious brunch. Will be back the next time I visit Singapore again! :)
Cafe,Very nice cafe with very good atmosphere. The food is also very delicious. Will recommend my friends.
Great experience,"Went there for haircut and was really surprised that not only they provide amazing cut, their food is surprisingly good. I am really satisfied with the services as well. Would definitely recommend my friends and family to visit this cafe/salon!"
good food !,food and drinks were very good and service was fast and efficient. a good place for gathering with your friends and to take nice photos too with the decor and flowers. highly recommend this place to anyone in the area.
Really Charming Place!,The place was super cute and charming with a lot of flora everywhere! I like to go there to study on my free time and the ambience is wonderful!! The food was really yummy as well and the staff was helpful. Will come back soon!! :)
BEST Environment Cafe & Salon !!!,Good customer service. Best environment suitable for meetings and events too. And Delicious Food !!!
Great Environment and Excellent Services,This salon cafe is well-decorated with lots of plants and flowers. I‚Äôm very impressed with excellent services üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª I will be back for sure!!

My visit at there,Professional skilled staff and nice services. Definitely will be coming back again next time üòçüòçüòçüòç
Super pretty cafe!,Super pretty cafe! Went there to drink the coffees and chat with some old friends. I love all the glasses they use for the coffees and they have some unique coffee option. Please go try it :)
Wonderful Lushful Garden Setting!,"This is great cafe with a beautiful garden setting. It's very well decorated and a good place to meet up with friends in a quiet setting since it's located almost by itself on the 3rd floor with little

The service is attentive and the food is fine. But you should come to this place for its ambiance and you'll even get a free pedi/mani to boot.

Definitely a great place to grab a bite and meet up with friends!!!"
Long waiting time,"Went on a weekend. The place is done up very nicely and certainly is a heaven for those who love to post Instagram pictures online. However, the service is another thing altogether. After waiting for close to 30minutes, only 1 out of 3 items was served. it was another 10-15minutes of wait before we finally got our entire order. This is 1 aspect that needs improvement."
Excellent Evening with Colleague,"Nice atmosphere, with drinks and food. I visited with a colleague and we had reserved a table for two for the free flowing beer. it was nice to know you drink all you can for SGD 20 for one hour.

Pure value for money. i also understand you can get your manicure done for free while you drink. I did not try this out, but i sure would next time."
Will come again,"Food are generally nice, servers attentive. Opening hours are early as well. Will definitely visit again."
Value for money breakfast buffet,Value for money breakfast buffet in a garden. Beautiful place and love the food. It will be great if can provide free flow of water.
Integrated cafe!,"Beautiful place where you can eat, drink, do your hair & nails all under one roof. Interesting concept. Presentation of food was appealing and the taste was great! Service was friendly & efficient. Atmosphere was relaxed. Good for sort of settings."
Place nicely done up!,A nice concept to have the salon and cafe together. Cafe is nicely done up with alot of greenery. Not wowed by the food though.
Need to improve,"Visited on 6 sep. Reached there earlier than reservation time but need to wait till reservation time then have table. Food get cold easily due to the air con. And food selection I felt that it can be improve. Pork Jowl dish is delicious and dessert souffle is yummy.
Suggestion: when serving the drinks at least should inform the customer what drink is been served.
Overall, the experience is good. Will go back again for dessert (:"
Disappointing service,"Actually I have been wanna to visit here and I forgotten about it until this recent dinner meet up with friends.

It is a beautiful & cozy place however we were disappointed by their services. Imagine when you're ready to order the food, the server snapped at you regarding one of the orders. This was felt by everyone at the table. We understand that the server may have a bad/long day, however it is not caused by us especially we were at the cafe not long ago. It was really a spoiled moment.

Food wise, it is not too bad however the selection is limited and is difficult to make a selection when you have little or no food preference. Therefore is best to check on the menu before coming and the food is on the slightly pricey range, perhaps due to its location. However this place may be ideal to hang out if you wish to be away from the crowds.

I would give Excellent on Atmosphere but not so good on the other factors"
Behold avid Instagrammers of the kawaii ilk!,"Sunshine you don‚Äôt find but you‚Äôll find yourself walking into a cute foliage where you can get immaculate and well fed. WOS has a cafe, nail bar, hair salon and a florist rolled into a lovely flowery bunch. I was here for the $15 free flow weekday breakfast during housewife o‚Äôclock, the bewitching hour where it‚Äôs not crowded and you still get decent IG angles. Last order was at 11 am, the time I sauntered in so I got to do a big spread at a go. There‚Äôs a western and Korean selection, all in small portions so you get to sample to your IG heart‚Äôs content. It‚Äôs oh so pretty here and if you‚Äôre here for the beauty services, they hand out generous discount coupons so you‚Äôre held hostage here all day. Which really isn‚Äôt too bad an idea. The only snag was paying $1 for water when you‚Äôre dining here. I saw patrons nursing that one coffee for hours. Surely free water for those who dine? #eatstylishtravelstylish"
Birthday brunch,Great ambience. I love the decoration. Food was good too. Staffs were friendly. One of them sang a birthday song for the birthday girl.
"Good Environment, Good Tasty Food","Extremely high standard of cuisine. Excellent environment, friendly service, great menu choices and good tasty foods & beverages at affordable prices. Will recommend this restaurant to my family & friends. I will return!!!"
"Good food, Good environment",Visited here with friends last Monday. Really lovely meal and very warm welcome. We would like to recommend this lovely place and will try to go back again.
