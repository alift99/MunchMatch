Birthday Celebration,"Celebrated my brother's birthday! Everyone was friendly and soft spoken, especially Rhodora who tried to make the day special!

Nice food and service,Everyone did a really great job. Food was fantastic. staff are very attentive and friendly. Thank you! will be back.
YOU HAVE MY 5 STAR!,"I have been coming here almost everyweek. And I would say that lobby lounge is my comfort place to go since im staying nearby. Chicken rice has always been my favourite! and have been ordering it everytime I visit. One thing I love the most is whenever I come, Dora would recognize me and make sure my table is taken care of. She would always take time to have small conversation to me and my friends to make us all feel welcome. The level of service and friendliness of staff are excellent! On my next visit, I would love to try the High tea that Dora has recommended. See you soon!"
Dinner at The Lobby Lounge,"While the food was decent, what stood out during this service was the warmth & care shown by Mr John Tan. He made thoughtful suggestions, was extremely attentive but never intrusive. By the end of the meal, we realised he wasn’t the only shining diamond. We wanted to make a repeat visit on the spot & even though he wasn’t working during our next visit, he took the initiative to asked his colleague Ms Dora to follow up. She shone as brightly as Mr Tan & made us look forward to dining in again at The Lobby Lounge (Intercontinental Bugis).

They have shown me what true hospitality is and will go far in any service industry."
Amazing staff and great food,"Great staff for being friendly and attentive, especially to the manager (DORA) who gave food recommendation and made our day extra special. Wagyu beef burger was amazing! I will definitely recommend and bring my friends again."
Exceptional environment with soothing services,"Ask for water, ask for power point to charge laptop, ask to change seats, ask for clearing of tables, everything is done with good services!"
Feedback on service rendered,"We were served by a senior hostess named Hani Lee tonight. She was very friendly and we had a wonderful conversation with her. We would like to thank her for her insights and experience about life as a foreigner working in Singapore.

We would like to add that one of the additional services she could perform is to serve as an ambassador to promote cultural understanding between guests and foreign service hostesses like her.

We would like to thank Hani for the service she rendered as well as for her friendship. We think she is a great asset to the hotel and would like to wish her the very best for her career.

Regards."
Great place for coffee and meetings,The Lobby Lounge is a great place for business meetings with a wide range of coffee selection and pastries as well as other dinning options. Compliments to Hayden Lam and team for the excellent service.
Refined Elegance,"The Lobby Lounge at the IC Singapore is one of the most elegant, refined and spacious eateries in Singapore. We visited after evening drinks in the Club Lounge. Hayden, the manger, has perfected the art of greeting and caring for his guests, as have the other staff who demonstrated the best standards of hospitality - gracious without being stuffy, warm while not crossing boundaries. A young Korean staff member had just started working in the Lobby and his enthusiasm added to the service we received. The Lobby Hamburger is not to be missed. The Negroni was expertly mixed. The atmosphere in the lounge allows for conversation without others listening. We visited twice during our recent stay and enjoyed the added celebrations to mark Chinese New Year."
Best service in the world!,"Have stayed at hundreds of hotels around the world, have never experienced such elite service anywhere.

Intercontinental Singapore is a level above, beautiful hotel and the staff take the experience to a whole nother level.

Hayden Lam in the lobby bar is an unbelievably friendly host, who makes your stay beyond anything you could imagine.

The check-in staff (especially Nora & Karen) make sure everything is perfect, and everything runs smoothly.

These people genuinely care, and it makes any stay very special.

Can’t wait to stay there again"
Thank you Hayden,Absolutely beautiful thanks to Hayden never had such good service anywhere in the world. Our son absolutely loves him and made our stay at the intercontinental hotel.
Enjoyable lunch,"We really had an enjoyable lunch at The Lobby Lounge. The food and service was excellent. Definitely will return again. The staff, Hayden, provided us great service with a smile. Thanks."
Fantastic experience of high tea in the Lobby Lounge,"I had a really beautiful and very personal experience at the Lobby Lounge on Chinese New Year 2023. The staff were so gracious and helpful, always attentive and pleasant, and the quality of food and tea was of the highest standard. The manager, Hayden, made me feel like a longtime friend and showed me the highest caliber of Singapore hospitality, explaining all aspects of the high tea menu and their cultural significance. I could tell that it had deep personal meaning to him as a local, and I absolutely loved it. I am eager to return. The hotel's signature heritage blend of tea was magnificent."

Nonya High Tea at The Lobby Lounge,"Great service and ambience at The Lobby Lounge. For those who wish to experience a uniquely local-themed afternoon tea, this would be one to consider."
A great catch up with friends at Intercontinental Bugis Lobby Lounge,"“DELICIOUS FOOD! We ordered the Hokkien Mee, Club Sandwich, Lobster Bisque, Hot Earl Grey Tea and Hot Cappuccino . All were absolutely delicious. Hani, our great host, was super attentive, on top of it and provides personalised service by showing us around for table availability for selection. She made the experience perfect. She brought out our surprise flower arrangement to my friend and brought us anything we asked for. Would definitely come back to such a wonderful prestige hotel intercontinental well manage by IHG!” Cheers - Jason Yang"
Fantastic Experience!,"We tried the high tea: kids, vegan AND classic. All were delicious! The atmostphere was fastive, fun and relaxing. Hayden was really helpful, dealing with all our needs in a kind an generous way. Kids loved it, we loved it, can't wait to come back!"

Excellent service from Haris,Excellent service provided by Haris. Special made cocktail and tasty foods. Kudos to Haris and service team. Definitely will be back again.
Perfect,the most delicious oysters and in general all dishes in the restaurant! top notch service! highly recommend
Impeccable experience for the family,"I arranged for a family afternoon tea to spend time with parents and relatives. Found the process very commendable, first the hotel responded promptly to my email queries, and helped confirm my reservation via email and text. Super organized! Then we had our afternoon tea experience today , trying both the vegan and classic (non veg) sets for our party. Very good spread of food items and free flow of delicious gelato and scones. My family were very happy with the experience and had commended on the attentive service from the Lobby Lounge staff too. Thank you very much for taking care of us and for creating such a nice experience for guests!"
Dinner,"Love the hotel and come often for meals at The Lobby Lounge. The food is great, the ambience is good and the service is excellent especially John, very attentive and helpful. Highly recommended to come and chill at the place for lite bite or meal."
Excellent service,"The hotel staff made it really special for us! Thank u
Food was alright but could have more vegan option perhaps"
Christmas tea catch up,"We highly like to comment that John Tan is so
attentive to our request and friendly as well. Display such professional attitude towards his work and we
were delighted to have him assisting us ."
Hani from The Lobby Lounge,"I went to afternoon high tea with my girlfriend for our catch-up session. Hani was the one serving us, throughout the whole period she was being very attentive to us, making sure our drinks were full and food is being replenished. She is also very knowledgeable and able to give me recommendations when I asked her for tea selection. Overall we enjoyed the high tea and we would love to come back again."
Inferior in everything except the decor,The good thing is the atmosphere - peaceful and visually serene. That's all. Scones were really bad -- cold and bland with hardened cream and ordinary jams. And very poor presentation. Staff were not intelligent and service was cold. Not worth the 5-star prices at all.
Nice afternoon tea set,"I’ve visited there few weeks ago and the afternoon tea set was really great. Especially, staff “Hani”’s attitude and service was really great I was so impressive."
Great service from Hani,"Came directly from the Raffles, which the service was shocking…. My day became much better after walking into the InterContinental next door. From the doorman, to the Lobby Lounge Hani, their friendliness and welcoming service - despite the room/rate/building and other hardware, InterContinental gave me a much more luxurious experience than the Raffles."
"Great ambience, ok food (tat overpriced for the serving) and ok service","Great ambience.

Food... Some hits and misses.
We ordered the burger , hokkien seafood noodles , nasi goreng (so so) and the laksa

Service... A couple of great service staff but quite a few that clearly require training."
Amazing Afternoon Tea,"Had a really chilled and pleasant Monday afternoon tea with my sister. The cakes and food was delicious. Great customer service by everyone, especially Dora. Would highly recommend to our friends."
"Dinner @The Lobby Lounge, Intercontinental Hotel, Singapore.","My friend and I have a dinner on last Friday (28 Oct) @ Lobby Lounge. We were served by a friendly Ms Hani when we reached the Lounge, and she has ushered us to a table, however we found that the table were too near to the stage and we requested to change to another table, Ms Hani has no hesitation to look for another table for us. When we asked for the billed, Ms Hani again was patiently explained to me about the charges in detail and she even helped me to redeem a cake from the app on my phone as member of Club Intercontinental is entitled to redeem a complimentary 1Kg of cake during the dinning.
I would like to thanks Ms Hani for her friendly, joyful, helpful and patience toward the customers, as she has made us a day especially after a stressful and tiring work day."
Hightea,"We just had lunch and were only thinking of having drinks but were tempted by the hightea description. The teaset is beautifully presented in a birdcage like tiered rack. My favourite items were the scones. Our service staff, John, is professional, polite and welcoming. Very nice ambience."
Review,"Served by bartender staff Yong Xiang, had a great night and good experience! Will come back! Good work!"
Passion pie,Very unique creamy sweet taste cocktail recommended by mr Haris from hotel intercontinental Singapore. Excellent service by Xiao Jie who offered to help us take beautiful photos during our chill out at the lobby lounge. ☺️ we will definitely come again
Is really a great night with friend to drink at lobby lounge with the service that they do,"Cheryl,darry and Yong really make our night happy by serving us the correct drink will be here back for it. Will recommend friend to came here as they came for business trip"
Early coffee,Excellent service by the team again. Good coffee and presentation was beautiful. A shout out to Praveen and Ang Mo guy for a beautiful early start of the day.
Phenomenal experience,"Deepest thanks and appreciation to Praveen, Noel & Haris for really making me and my friends' day by being so helpful and understanding of our needs and concerns.

The food and atmosphere are wonderful too! Team members are very attentive and you are sure to have a great time here.

Looking forward to returning in future!"
awesome and friendly service,"Thank you Debbie for rearranging in the midst of a packed tea time!
Super happy that she managed to get a seat for me and my business partners."
Thank you Lobby lounge team.,Once again. Excellent service by the team lead by Mr Praveen. Love the cocktail. His team Josh and Haris were attentive. Thank you again.
"Thank you Haris,john & praveen the excellent service ;)","Thank you Haris,john & praveen the excellent service & praveen creative the cocktail for me. Highly recommend this place.Definitely will come back again"
HY,"Great hospitality by Raj. I requested for a coffee with more milk (latte) from the waitress, but she didn’t understand. Raj was nearby and he heard and quickly presented me with a good cup. Although he mends the bar counter, I noticed that he didn’t stop at helping his colleagues. Excellent training and initiative from him. High tea quality is average I find. Too little savoury items. I’ve had high tea in London and it came with free flow of finger sandwiches. And honestly, it’s hard for one person to eat 3 servings of it. So do consider offering something like that in the future."
Good Service,"Had our pregnant mummies get-together yesterday and special mention to Praveen, our relationship manager of the day, who gave us very good and nice service. He gave each mummy an additional cushion to support our back and took effort to concoct special mocktails for us, considering we couldn't drink alcohol. He also checked in with us from time to time to ensure we well taken care of and our food requests are met."
Excellent host and party,Excellent and personable experience. Praveen made sure everyone’s need was catered and we are all comfortable. The food and drink was quite yummy!
Ovwrwhelmingly good service,"Had a gathering at the lobby lounge and Praveen was so attentive and accomodating to all our request.

The best service I ever had.

Food is delicious and drinks are great too.

Do ask for Praveen's special mocktail concoction as well, super yummy end to a beautiful evening!"
Great night out @ Hotel Intercon,"Had a fantastic night chilling at the Lobby Lounge. Really enjoyed the ambience, the music & to top it off, a very special drink concoction by Praveen! Many thanks to Praveen for the special touch"
@ Lobby Lounge hotel Intercontinental bugis,"Whether you are here for Business or Pleasure, you are in for a good hospitality & F&B.
I have been at lobby lounge for atleast 12 occasions for business or just chilling out, & at all times treated with good services & courteous crews.
Ayush Avlani , Nelson Raja & Matts are commendable crews.
Hotel intercontinental bugis,
do keep up with your hospitality & f&b.
Thankyou."
High Tea,"The ambiance was great,the service was top notch. They have a good balance of tea. The desserts were absolutely delicious,tried both vegan and classic. With more variety of food.
Praveen was very nice and helpful and assisted to take orders and gave clear explanation of which is which is on the bird cage. Yong Kang and Raj services was exceptional as well. Great place to visit for high tea."
Dining and chilling at the lounge,Praveen and Andy is just absolutely creative whilst reinventing the drinks you have in mind! Best service and environment at this lounge.
Good service,"He was prompt in refilling our drinks and snacks, was kind and patient with us when we were ordering as well"
Curated Off The Menu Drinks by Praveen!,"Never met someone so interesting who just comes to your table and ask you your taste palate in the drinks you you want. Favourite base, citrusy, sweet or dry etc. Gin, Whiskey and Vodka based cocktails and an elevated old fashion. Praveen for one made our afternoon a great one. My favourite is still his IGINYOU and Man’s Bestfriend. There was a story behind it. Funny ones! Amazing work by Praveen. He took time, went behind the bar and made us our drinks. Bespoken Drinks! Be sure I’m going to have his drinks and we’ll be back again for more."
Afternoon High tea,"Praveen, Harris, Raj and Steve are wonderful and attentive.

The high tea was excellent and will definitely come back"
Top Class Serivce,"I would like to comment excellent service serve by Ms Kristee, Mr Yong Kang and Mr Andy. They are so professional, efficient, friendly and polite. I visited Lobby Lounge occasionally because I enjoyed their food and serivces. If you want to have nice food, nice ambient come visit The Lobby Lounge"
Praveen’s singapore slings,As good if not better than Raffertys’!!! The perfect way to end a tropical trek around Singapore before climbing into bed.
High tea at the Lobby Lounge,"Came with my in-laws for Mothers Day high tea - we ordered the classic set, with their signature cocktail as an add-on. Our main service staff, Praveen, asked me how the cocktail was and I gave feedback that all I tasted was Gin, which was disappointing as I could not taste the essence of tea amongst the other ingredients. Perfect service recovery was provided, thanks to Praveen and the team (Kristine and Yonghang), they provided our table with 2 complimentary cocktails (one whiskey based, one vodka based) to make up for the bad drink. Thank you for the thoughtfulness and awesome service recovery. We really appreciated it! And the flower too for my mother-in-law :)"
Out of the green martini,"I was gladly invited into the the lounge after my dinner by Praveen. He brought us in and told us he would make off the menu drinks for us. I wanted a martini but not the regular dry ones. He told me he will come up and make a twist to it there and then. He explained the drinks and to my shock I received a green sweet tasting martini. Vodka, Midori and lychee liquer! To my surprise, it tasted so good and the colour was sublime. Cheers Praveen! Will be back again for sure for that martini!"
Mr Loh,Friendly Staff and great drinks. Would visit again. Stay for the final drinks. Always a great ending
Afternoon tea,"Great afternoon tea with my girlfriends. Enjoyed the free flow ice cream, scones and classic high tea set. Thanks for the good service Kristine!"
Lovely afternoon tea with my daughter and her best friend,We had a truly lovely afternoon tea at the lobby lounge. The food is so cute and well thought through and the service is second to none. The inclusion of the two lion soft toys and colouring pens and paper were a nice touch. The a la carte menu is also well priced. The staff are also so obliging and friendly. The girls really enjoyed themselves!
Bad quality high tea set,"Food was not impressive and honestly not very nice. The texture of the food felt like it was left out there in the open for a long while. Some tasted quite bad too. I couldn’t even point out which was my favorite among the set.

I had a cafe latte which was watery and tasted milky and I couldn’t finished it at all.

Ice cream was melted when the server was scooping it. But no, she didn’t stop. She tried very hard to make a nice ball with melted ice cream. By the time I took it to the table, it was just cream.

Service could be better. When I was ordering for my group of 5, it was emphasized to me several time that $55 is FOR ONE PERSON and TWO PEOPLE will be $55x2; as if we couldn’t read the menu saying “$55 per adult”. When I nodded and said YES, I want 5 sets, it was emphasized again that it will be $55x5.

And one of the friends were late so we told them to serve 4 sets first. But no, they served all 5 sets and just left one set by the empty seat. Very terrible service.

Overall, I felt it was not worth it and was very disappointed. We went straight to another restaurant in the area to satisfy our tummy as we only managed to finish about half the high tea set."
The sparkling tea is horrible,"it's a good looking place and the set looks alright.
Even so I made a mistake to book it with a sparkling tea.
food and drinks.
food was rather cold or slightly below the room temperature.
it would be alright for the sweets only but it was in general. seems like it was coming from the fridge directly with the stop by somewhere to increase the temperature.
the sparking tea was horrible to be honest. I can understand abit sweet but it was like a sugar syrup. so it was a 0.2 glass full and sweet. maybe it was a sugar for the coffee lol
the coffee was alright.
service.
the service was ok.

so please, try to avoid the sparking tea unless you are crazy about sugar otherwise, it worth a try."
High Tea tasted terrible,"We were guests at the hotel and made a reservation for high tea for two adults and one child at the Lobby Lounge one afternoon. The ambience and service was great. But the food was beyond horrendous. We, the adults could barely eat anything served. It all tasted odd, old and cheap. The pastries were quite gross. The scones were all mushy when you put it in your mouth. Our child could barely eat anything from the kids high tea. I tasted the tuna sandwich and it was not edible. If I could give this place a 0/10 I would. Our high tea for 2 adults and one child costed $197. Please put your money elsewhere where it deserves to be. There are many places offering great high tea at the fraction of what we paid for at the Lobby Lounge at Intercontinental."
