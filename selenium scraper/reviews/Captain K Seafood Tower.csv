Great Seafood,Best seafood experience in a while. Food delivered within an hour to the hotel. Still hot and plenty of food. Great experience will recommend highly…
Bad Experience,"The service is bad, the food is serve without turning on the heat until we notify them. and the waitress/waiter just chit chatting there and look at their phone without concern with the customer request."
Overcooked Lobster,They cook all the seafood before bringing it to your table because “customers don’t know how long to cook it for” yet a ‘seafood specialist’ managed to badly overcook the lobster. The prawns and clams were ok. A huge pot of stock is left at the bottom to make congee/porridge but there is so much that you are left with a watery consistency. There were only 4 tables on a Saturday night from 8pm until we left at 9:30pm. They didn’t bother to bid us farewell when we left probably because I pointed out to them that the lobster was overcooked and questioned why they would cook everything before bringing it out.
Worth paying the price! Fresh seafood and good service!,Wasn't expecting much but read about Captain K. The food did not disappoint. Waiters were good manners and provided good service. I'll definitely go back again to try the other items in the menu!
Server is dreaming,"After telling the waiter what I want, he only serve me my starter.
After finish my starter for 10mins, I asked how long is my main dishes coming and they can still tell me 5-10 mins, after 20 mins I asked why is it taking so long, then they tell me my main dishes was not ordered... Really.............. Dreaming?????"
"This is our first experience to this restaurant, the experience was good . It would have been better if the waiter was a","The experience was good , seafood was fresh .it would have been better if the waiter would have provide proposal base on the food we ordered, realize too many repeated items like clams and other shells."
Highly recommend,We enjoyed the Christmas dinner with my friends over there. The seafood tower is so good and the white chicken soup base is delicious too . We love so much and definitely will go again .
Disappointed,"Maybe my expectations were too high as I thought this would replicate another meal I had.
The main disappointment was the food was precooked and as such less of the essence went into the porridge.
The prawns and scallops were nice. The mussels and clams were not.
Service was decent. They give you a bucket to throw the shells."
nice food nice service,the food is nice and fresh. i go with my friends and the environment also not bad suitable for friend gathering. the service they provide is good.
tracetogether APP needed,"they won't let you dine in if you don't have the app. tokens are not accepted. probably due to this the place is mostly empty for the entirety of my visit. I saw a group of walk-ins were interested but they eventually left for reasons unclear.
food is average. its just steamed seafood. they are however very clean. no sand in any of the clams. it was supposed to have the juices from each layer drip into the soup below but maybe because of the induction stove not hot enough there's hardly any juice dripping anywhere. the soup at the end is warm at best"
Dining experience marred by false advertising,"We celebrated my son's birthday and enjoyed the experience. The service was great and the seafood was fresh except 3 oysters were found with bad taste/smell, but the restaurant was fast to make replacement so no qualms about that.
However the overall good experience was marred by false advertising by the company on ""Birthday Special"" that stated if it’s your birthday month, you get to enjoy 1 free Chilean King Crab with purchase of the Atlantic Seafood Tower. When we were there at the restaurant, they simply told us no Chilean King Crab would be given free if we order the Atlantic Seafood Tower and meeting all their stated terms and conditions. We felt ""scammed"" but did not wish to make a scene as it was my son's happy occasion. The only thing etched in our minds after our dining is not to support such scheming restaurant again."
Crab in da pot,"The white sauce is absolutely delicious. The set also comes with ramen noodle, which goes well with their sauce. Good for sharing and their delivery is fast. Will recommend this to others."
Fresh and Value for money!!,"We had the Crab in a Pot in their Signature White Sauce as our main dish together with other ala carte orders. The seafood were very fresh. Great ambience to go with the food and spoilt for choices with the wide variety. Not to mention that they are reasonably priced.

Enjoyed it and will definitely be back for more!"
Seafood in da pot,Yummy seafood in da pot. The size is generous and fresh. The udon goes well with their signature white sauce.
Delicious Seafood Boil,"Order their seafood boil for delivery. Their white sauce is really good with their fresh seafood. Add on with udon makes it even better. Thank you, Manager Danny for the recommendation. Will order again for Father’s Day."
Good service,Crablicous salted baked crab. Had our mother’s day celebration at Captain K. Their service is prompt and attentive.
Excellent for everything,Very very absolutely great dinner I had last year! Food was extremely nice and service was top class. Love every single bit that I can remember.
Family dinner,Had an enjoyable seafood feast at Captain K. Seafood is very fresh. The essence of the seafood at the bottom tier is the best together with the hotpot items.
"Seafood tower is great , expect the free king crab too dry, can’t tell it’s freshness","Order >$200 seafood tower to entitle for birthday treat of king crab, seafood are fresh and delicious, except for the free king crab. I would rather they don’t provide such quality free gift , it will effect the return rate, what a waste the seafood serve at normal price is really good quality , but overall experience affected by the Unpleasant Free treat."
Overall,Freshness normal taste normal value terrible not a place for gathering overall the place and food is just like coffee shop
Mis Information by Waiter,"We had Hot pot dinner to celebrate my wife Birthday . The food over all was good,
We was excited as before we enter the restaurant there was a Poster about free crab for Birthday Month.
I check with the waiter about the promotion, I was informed that provided my bill have to be more than $200 we will be entitle to the free crab.
We than proceed to order through the same waiter - when the food was serve half way - I check with the same waiter again about the Crabs - this time I was informed that the free crabs promotion is only for the Steam Tower - feel so cheated by the waited about such that the least he should explain that the promo was only for the Steam Tower and for me to decide.... am wondering now if I will to order the Tower will he say the promo is for the Hot Pot ...LOL"
Hotpot delight,Interesting concept to have your seafood first followed by hotpot at the bottom of the seafood tower. The soup is indeed flavourful with wide variety of hotpot items to choose from. Do try their salt baked crab.
Price misleading,"Quite disappointed. website menu shows $8.80/100gm for mud crabs. But when we get there, they don't even have options for 100gm and instead only serving over 800gm options which is over $80.00 min.

People tend to go there for seafood tower so not really looking to eat just crab. clearly for smaller groups, you don't need 800gm for crab since there are other seafoods on the tower.

Why advertised such portion and price if you don't serve it anyway. At least give customers options to order smaller quantity either 100/200/300 gms etc."
Interesting seafood dining concept,"The seafood was fresh and presented in an interesting tower concept. The chili dips were spicy and adds to the flavour of the food. A bit pricey, but I suppose it's similar to other K cuisine"
Fresh seafood and nice ambience,"Seafood is fresh and lobster was very well cooked and not chewy. Prawns, shell fishes without sand and good food prep. 5 stars."
Worth trying,"Seafoods are fresh and good. If you love seafood, it worth going. It is recommended to go at least in group of 4 which can order Atlantic tower of which the variety is wider.."
Seafood tower,The seafood we ordered were very fresh. Recommend 100%. Good for ordering for business. We ordered 3 tower
Good Seafood,Great food and great staff here. The seafood tower was eye catching too. Would recommend trying this place out!
Fresh and good quality seafood!,Fresh and good quality seafood! The chicken soup right at the end of the tower is yummy too! Great place for dinner with friends!
Excellent service,Service by the staff was excellent. They took the effort to explain the menu to us and continually refilled our drinks and cleared our plates and dustbin when necessary. Very polite. Great service ! Thank you
Great seafood place,Newly revamped menu and ambience. Had 1 dozen of fresh oysters. Mentaiko lobster is delicious. Service is impeccable.
Take your hard-earned money elsewhere,"My last dining experience on 18 July 2020 was a far cry from when I last dined here in 2016. The prices have sky rocketed astronomically but the quality of ingredients have remained average and their quantities have gone down! The service was mediocre at best. They dangled a free Alaskan King crab for spend above $200 if a dining guest was celebrating a birthday. So that made us go for the $188 tower (but which we later found out to be little more than the $108 tower for $80 more). Lo and behold, the crab was absolute garbage. Tasted dry and stale from being frozen for too long. Then we noticed every other table was also offered an Alaskan King crab. Were they all celebrating their birthdays as well?? They were clearly trying to clear old stock! For a $200 tower, we really expected more. It was extremely disappointing. The menu for the towers were designed to be unclear so it was difficult to determine the differences between the towers and prices. My party of 4 left wholly unsatisfied. We will not come back. There are plenty of much better options out there for your money. This is a total waste of money and time."
Very fresh seafood,Simply a guilty pleasure! Affordably priced as well. Seafood very fresh and tasty. Will definitely come back.
Awesome!,"Customer service was awesome. Staffs are friendly and helpful. Ordered 6 tiers (Atlantic tower), managed to get 1 free crab due to birthday month. Seafood are mostly fresh and juicy. Had surprise celebration by the staff there, all thanks to my friends!"
Original and great service,"We discovered this restaurant by going to their upstair neighbours, en sushi, with whom they share the kitchen. This restaurant offers either hotpot or tower fish dishes. They fly the food over from all over the world. It is not cheap but the quality of the food is top(important with oysters,lobsters, shrimps etc. We good a very patient staff member explaining us all options. Chef came to greet us at our table. Unfortunately they don’t do wine only limited beer list. A list of white wines & champagne would increase this place’s revenue a lot."
Great restaurant to celebrate my birthday,Had a wonderful meal with great service by Crisystel Jen who helped us in picking out a sake to go with our meal that was first class. Hope we can return before we move on in our travels.
Not fresh enough,"For a seafood place, I find the food not fresh enough. We had the 3-tiered tower, cold crabs and kimchi soup base. Only the prawns were fresh, the scallops and oysters were passable but the clams and crabs were not."
Unique Dining Experience,It is a joyful and fun way to eat your seafood in a tower. The soup base is rich in seafoodie taste. Thumbs up !
Good for gathering,The staffs are helpful and friendly. The food is quite nice. Will recommend to friends if they are seafood lovers.
Seafood heaven,This is the place to find fresh and affordable seafood. Mentaiko lobster is a must try. Service and ambience is good.
Mixed family review,"The four of us ordered butter garlic lobster, cheese baked lobster, calamari and shrimp. On the menu, they list the price per gram which was really deceiving because I was shocked when we received the bill and realized how expensive each lobster was. The cheese baked lobster was not to our liking. I want to taste the richness of the lobster and not be overpowered by the cheese. The calamari was adequate. My husband thought the meal was superb. The three of us did not enjoy our meal and basically just watched him eat. He will be overruled to ever return."
They do the right thing here,Nicely presented and delicious fresh seafood. What else I need to say. Prices are affordable and they seem to take good care of you
Gathering,Great place to eat seafood! Food is fresh and service was quick. Interesting concept and will definitely visit again! Highly recommended!
Sumptuous seafood,Had a sumptous seafood feast at Captain K. Definitely excite all seafood lovers. YUMMY! Will be back during CNY again.
Crablicious,Very fresh seafood at affordable price. GREAT place for gathering. Do try their salt baked crab. Good service.
Seafood and hotpot venue,"Fresh seafood and a variety of hotpot ingredients. We ordered the recommended seafood tiers with other ala cart hotpot ingredients to enjoy, as recommended. As it was a birthday celebration, we learnt that there is a complimentary crab. Be sure that the birthday person brought along his/her ID for verification. This is a nice gesture and good marketing coming from the restaurant, however the complimentary crab given to us was overcooked/from an older batch (compared to the same crab we ordered additionally). It was really quite tough. I also want to mention that you are not able to change the default seafood in the selection. One of us were allergy to oysters. Waiter did not try asking Chef is we can change it to something else. Nevertheless, service is good. Staffs were attentive. We enjoyed our ginseng chicken soup base. It was splendid."
Fresh Seafood,"Had 9 tier seafood tower, quality steamed seafood, good services vegan wife stay at the hotel, I didn't see vegan & vegetarian options but that's okay because it's my day!"
Not bad,"Fresh spread of seafood, but very pricey for the quantity you get, and just steam fresh seafood.. nothing amazing."
NYE Steamboat,The overall is not bad. The price is reasonable. The food portion is reasonable for 5 people. The soup is not bad.
Quality Steamed Seafood! Highly Recommended.,Everything is right at this restaurant from customer service to food quality. Price range between $70-$150; depending on your orders.
Family dinner,Easy to find and it is located near MRT and there is public car park nearby. Good place for small family gathering. I skipped the K seafood tower going for just the steamed prawns and ordered the crabs and baked lobsters instead. Steamboat was included which allowed my family to chat and catch up with one another.
Seafood Delight,Fresh grilled seafood was delicious. The mentaiko lobster is a must try. Kudos the service staff for making the dining experience wonderful.
Food came abit too slow.,We waited for quite a while for our tower. Quality was good though. Would still visit again. More appetiser dishes to keep customers occupied while waiting would be good.
Complimentary,"It was our very 1st visit to celebrate friends birthday. Its the best choice ever for the 13 of us. The ambience is plesant, service is excellent, the food is fresh & presentation is appealing. Every layer of the tower is so full of surprises.
I would strongly recommend this restaurant to all seafood lovers... And for the quality of food & prices we paid, its value for every cents spent.
Tips of the day-you get a free crab if your birthday falls onto that particular month. Just present your ID.
Would also like to thank all the friendly staff especially Albert for their service. Albert was attending to our table... From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, he greeted us with the most sunny smile,recommended the menu, even teaches us the techniques on how to handles the crab. We are so blessed to have him providing such personalised service.
We all left the premises with a great memory!"
First time experience at Captain K,The seafood was fresh and staffs were friendly and detailed in their explanation on how to place the order. It was our first time there and had enjoyed the meal.
Crab Feast,Great place for gathering and seafood feast. Good food and ambience. Try their baked crab and grill squid
Good congee,The congee is good for the seafood tower. Only downside is the lala got sand for mine. You can consider coming
MUST TRY,It is first dish I tried in Singapore. The meal is really delicious. Highly recommended for all people.
Captain K,Thank you Captain K for the awesome food and service. My family enjoyed the fresh seafood. Will be back for the grilles crab
Fabulous Seafood Korean style,Captain K is located at the suburbs of the city district at 112 Middle Road Singapore. The ambiance is simply comfortable and the serving crew were young and pleasant people. Service is good and the place is not too noisy like other venues. Music was played but at a decent level where you still enjoy your meal and talk without having to shout. Food was really good and delicious.
Birthday celebrations at a price,"We walk-in as it’s weekday. My Friend recommendation to make reservations on weekends and lunch hour.

We didn’t try the tower since only two of us. We ordered 3 river prawns, 1 mud crab, 1 fried drumlets 5pcs, 1 bamboo clam, 2 barley Korean tea charged by per person but it’s refillable. Due to its my birthday so I get a free Chile king crab (I think it’s about 800g). We paid close to s$200 include GST and service charge.

Food - pretty good but price pretty high end. I love their presentation of food. But the carrot is kind of dry and hard. My Friend said it’s for display not meant to be eaten.
Service - A+ as the guy help to deshell the king crab and also even got his kitchen Chef to heat up after the deshell.
Environment- only 2 tables occupied so the noise only for our tables.

If you have the Budget and like seafood. Worth trying. Go for the layer type of seafood steam tower. But price isn’t cheap. Good news is you can choose what u want to steam beside the fixed set types unlike in Korea (fixed layers so can’t choose what u like)."
Awesomely fresh seafood and clean eating style,Very very fresh seafood. Definitely a great bargain for the price! Greeted with very good service and smile from staff. Kudos to the service team!
Captain K,I am impressed with Captain K's fresh quality seafood. Make sure you pre order their grilled BBQ crab or it would be sold out. It's a seafood lover favorite place. Will be back for more.
Grilled BBQ Crab,"I’m impressed with their grilled crab which is rich in roe. The sauce is delicious. After trying the first crab, we ordered another one. It’s definitely a seafood place to go for."
Great dinner!,"The seafood was very fresh. Wide variety of condiments and sauces; the sweet chilli base and soy sauce base condiments went very well with seafood. I was pleasantly surprised to find a whole chicken in the ginseng chicken soup!

Their staff was attentive, knowledgable and flexible with the menu. No greasy smell on clothes. Fantastic experience."
Great experience,"first time trying the seafood tower.Is very attract and great experience for us.Fresh seafood,especially the crab.Do try their new bbq crab,is very delicious and tasty.Good service of staff.We will back again and recommed for my friend."
BBQ crab,Do try their bbq crab. Very tasty and rich in roe. Good service too. Definitely recommend to my friends.
Delicious steamed seafood,"First time trying seafood tower. It was an interesting experience, layer after layer of delicious fresh seafood, especially the oysters, prawns and scallops. Finish off with hot pot (priced separately). We had a free Chilean crab for birthday and it was a good surprise. Staff were attentive and constantly changed our plates. Nice touches like having little baskets to hold shells which are constantly cleared by staff. Worth mentioning is that the stools are used to store your bags. Though the price is rather steep, it is worth a visit!"
Great steamboat place !,second time there with my friends for the steamboat! we love their quality ingredients and i like that their sauce is free flow!!!! The ginseng chicken soup base was memorable for me.
Great Experience and Food,"Really enjoyed the food here and my 2 boys (8 and 3) loved the experience of the seafood tower. We had the steamboat for 2 and a couple of other sides and each was excellent.

The service was also very attentive and helpful in guiding us through the menu."
Nice seafood,Its a must try for their BBQ crab. Every table seem to be enjoying their crab. The ambience is great for dining. Attentive staff and the service is good.
Bbq crab,Great fresh seafood with great service. Do try their new bbq crab. Definitely will recommend to my friends!
Nice seafood and experience,"We had a booking for two, had the arctic tower (2 tier) and drinks. You need to add a soup base, so its around $50 per pax on average. But the food is great and just about right."
Superb crabs,"True to its word, the crabs are amazing. A gem in Bugis, the seafood variety are impressive and just so delicious. Absolutely love it."
Yummy crabs,Great place for gathering. Had a birthday gathering and its a must to try their baked crab. Great service too!
Seafoodlicious good,"This intimate and cozy restaurant is located in Middle road area, by the Bugis MRT. It sits about 80, with round tables and hipster stools for seats and has an extensive menu for seafood items. The service is quite good, with about 3 servers who are polite and efficient with cleaning up the empty plates so more can come.

This place is so good, that I've been there three times in a month. Each time we go, we always order the different assortments of seafood and side dishes,from fresh river prawns, mudcrabs to oysters, mussels and clams. Cooked dishes are seasoned with it's own recipe which come out smelling savory and appetizing, unlike other places that use the same seasoning for all dishes. Seafood are either steamed or baked to bring out the natural sweetness and freshness.

The latest in menu- chicken wings are one of my favourites. The wings are seasoned with their in-house seasoning and done just right, with the skin a bit crispy and the meat juicy which makes for a heavenly delight. The baked mudcrabs are also very delectable and mouthwatering. All the flavor is kept and goes well with a cold soda drink. One of my new favorites is the watermelon soju as its refreshing and brings me back to korea for an hour.

The prices are extremely reasonable compared to similar places in town or seafood restaurants and just as good, if not better!

Remember to make an reservation as they are always full during peak hours."
Hassle-free seafood,"This was a great place to get hassle-free and high quality seafood! I booked online through Chope with no problems. They made an automated phone call a few hours before the booking where I just had to press 1 to confirm. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The seafood towers were a bit much for just two people, and didn't have the things I specifically wanted, so we ordered a la carte instead. It came to $280 including a $100 bottle of sake (very nice sake!) and we had 6 oysters, 12 tiger prawns and a crab. I think this was great value for such fresh seafood. Will definitely be coming back again in future."
Must-try tower seafood,"The seafood was fresh and I got a free crab for my birthday month. Service was good, especially by a staff by the name of Ah Yee. Water was not provided, so we ordered a mocktail and a soda drink. Both the drinks were expensive and not nice. Plenty of seafood but should have vegetables in the menu. For those who do not like seafood, there is only a beef steak or pork belly or chicken cutlet to choose from."
Fresh seafood,"Prawns and clams were very fresh. Scallops were soft and nice. Mussels were a tad too salty, saw the next table put them into the soup, it was a good idea."
Captain K Seafood Tower,Great experience seafood dining place. Do try their 4 kind lobsters. Fresh and affordable seafood. Will be back for more.
Fresh Seafood Tower,Affordable and fresh seafood. Seafood tower is great for sharing. It is a must try for their salt baked crab. Great service and ambience.
"Love the food, but could have been better","I have ordered one of seafood tower combo. The food quality is good, the ingredients are fresh.
But for the crab, I think it could have been better as the crab doesn't taste sweet at all. It doesn't have any favour. I was basically just chewing meat only.
Tried yogurt makgoli, the apple flavour is awful. Others flavours are ok.
The kimchi taste is a bit different, my friends liked it but i find it sweet..
Would recommend to taste their kimchi side dish first before ordering kimchi soup base."
So delicious!!,Very unique food. We ordered 5 tiered seafood tower. Every layer has a different range of seafood. The juice from the steamed seafood will drip into the bottom which is the ginseng chicken soup. The soup is just awesome.
Fresh steam seafood,"We have the 7 tiered seafood tower with additional salt baked crab for 6 of us. Friendly atmosphere, nice staff and fresh seafood. Many choices of different sauces too!"
Worth to go again,Service was prompt and food was fresh. Good place to gather with friends. Ordered 5 tiers and the kimchi soup base was good to go with instant noodles.
Awesome food,Repeat customer. Always love going back there with my family. Comfortable atmosphere and good food!!
Fresh seafood,Fresh seafood and great service from the staffs. A good place for gathering with friends and family celebration.
Greatness!,"Celebrated Valentine with my wife at En Sushi. Great food and wonderful service! The staff was very welcoming and gave us good recommendations. We ordered a good spread of sushi and grills, fresh and nicely curated. We’d like to compliment on the plating (see photo & u will know), nicely set and not over-doing. We’ll definitely patronize again and recommend to our friends & family! Well done!"
First timer,"I saw your advertisement on the web and decided to try your restaurant. My wife's birthday was on the 11 May and so was our anniversary. I booked a table for 3 with my daughter along. I was hoping to try your promotion for the free King crab with the 4 tiers Seafood Tower but the selection of the seafood choice on the menu does not seem to suit us. Out of the four tiers, 3 tiers appeared to be too lavish with mussels, clams and prawns. Only 1 tier is appropriate with 4 scallops and oysters as there were only 3 of us. As such we did not order the 4 tiers seafood tower.

As we were already seated, we decided to try on the hoppot instead so we selected the Ginseng chicken soup base and some dishes from the tick menu.

The service was a little bit long to wait with the beef steak served first. The beef steak was very good with great smoky flavour on the surface and rare tender texture on the inside. We finished the steak but the hotpot was still not ready.

When it finally came we thought the wait was worthwhile as we didn't expect to be served with a full chicken in the soup. We ordered the Sri Lanka Mud crab and the flesh of the crab was really firm and fresh. The bean curd skin was good as well and other dishes we chose were fresh and crunchy.

Overall, the experience was good with the hot pot but just disappointed for not being able to benefit from the King Crab promotion. We hope the next time promotion menu would suit us for 3 if there is still one."
It’s expensive but fresh seafood,Overall I think the seafood is very fresh but the price is very expensive and the bottom soup is compulsory add on should be complimentary because the seafood tower is costly. The chairs is not clean but food is acceptable. We receive a free Chilean King Crab for our parents birthday.
Fresh food and great service,"Recommendations by staff was great. Food was fresh and taste is great. Overall, a happy family customer"
Freshest seafood and excellent service!,"Visited with a group of 8 and had a 9 tier seafood tower, which was nothing short of awesome. The king crab, lobster, prawns and oysters were extremely fresh.
Soup base was Korean Ginseng Chicken, a must try!
The service staff were great and attentive. Food was served fast.
Price was reasonable per pax.
One of the finest seafood restaurants in town. I can't wait to to come back here again :)"
Birthday celebration,"Love love love the food! Fresh seafood, every layer have the wow factor, the soup at the bottom was fabulous! All the service staffs sang birthday song for our son. Their service is marvelous! Definitely will recommend to friends & family!"
$2 Oysters,Went on a Tuesday evening for their $2 oysters promotion. The oysters are really fresh and juicy. Their baked crab is a must try too. Will gather more friends to go for oyster days.
Excellent steamed seafood,"Seafood was fresh and delicious, loved the giant juicy scallops. Wonderful place to enjoy fresh seafood with friends and family. Order the mud crabs! It is a must try. Price was reasonable too. Will return."
Fresh seafood!,"As a seafood lover, I always actively look for nice seafood restaurants in town. I tried Captain K seafood Tower with a few close friends recently. Seafood is very fresh and service is good! I especially loved the concept - revealing the food layer by layer. We couldn't wait to see what was in the next layer! After finishing all the seafood, there were also variety of ingredients to choose to add into the soup base. Great place for group gathering! Difinitely will come back again!"
Fresh and high quality ingredients at very reasonable prices,"Came here over the weekend to have a go at the steamboat and seafood tower. Absolutely loved the ginseng chicken soup base, the Angus beef strips and the fresh seafood that we had with it. We also ordered a watermelon soju which came in a huge carved out watermelon, and there was more than enough between the 4 of us to last the entire meal.

They only provide fresh and high quality ingredients and at a very reasonable price. Will come back without hesitation."
Mentaiko lobster,Had a birthday celebration at Captain K. They served quality seafood. Their mentaiko lobster and baked crab are delicious and flavourful. Commendable service too. Will be back again !
Good quality fresh seafood,Not crowded at all in midweek and a good quiet place to catch up with friends. Will visit again in the future.
Amazing place for hotpot and seafood,"Besides the impeccable service of their staff, the seafood and hotpot was really fresh and delicious. Must try ginseng chicken soup. $2 oyster on Monday and Tuesday also not bad"
