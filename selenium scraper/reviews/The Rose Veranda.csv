Beautiful place,"Rose Veranda has always been our favourite for a leisurely family weekend brunch and for birthday celebrations. Being vegetarian, am impressed with the spread they have . They have done away with the buffet now and it’s a set menu which makes it easier actually . Staff is very helpful and friendly too."
Flavours not great,"You’ll enjoy the October menu to commemorate Breast cancer awareness if you like beetroot and rose flavours. Mains were passably good. Steak was good albeit small. The tiger prawn main consists of 1 medium sized prawn and something similar to risotto The desserts weren’t great. Looked pretty but didn’t enjoy the flavours. The scones that were cold, hard and dry."
Saddened,"Having read such raving reviews of this high tea spot, we decided to host our overseas relatives there on 23 July 2022. Sadly the staff were obviously shorthanded and the inexperience of the new or temporary staff was pretty obvious. Service standards were inconsistent with requests forgotten e.g. milk for tea etc. Even more upsetting was that a significant number of teas (those from Sri Lanka) were unavailable. It would have been professionally courteous, I reckon, if the restaurant pre-informed guests of the shrinkage of the tea repertoire before seating the guests as some discerning guests especially epicurean tea lovers have their strong preferences! Service was at times tardy and sadly the strict end-time after 2 hours meant that guests felt 'chased' away with not too subtle offers to pack unfinished dessert away. All in all, a disappointing afternoon tea experience!"
Thank you everyone! Highly recommended,"The rose veranda’s high tea set was amazing. All of the food really delicious and staff’s serve also perfect. Especially, Our lovely servers Christy and Allie. They’re really attentive and friendly. Thank you for making my mother on her wonderful trip to Singapore."

highly recommended!,"Friendly staffs, nice food and love the vibe the most! one of the best places to spend time with families and friends. Highly recommended!"
Enjoy good quality food in a relaxed surroundings,"Always enjoyed the high tea here as it includes a main course. And the main course is always delicious. There is an equal number of savoury and sweet items which makes the afternoon tea experience a balanced one. There is also a wide variety of good quality tea to choose from. And service at Shangri la is always impeccable. It has a view of the pool, surrounded by greenery, which makes the ambience a relaxing one."
Best Service Ever! Especially cheers to Christy,"We’ve been here for friends lunch. Service was top notch. Especailly Christy was taking care of our table with warm smile and service.

"Special thanks to Hani, Christy, and Allie for their excellent hospitality!","Immediately we were warmly welcomed and seated by Christy, followed by a short and sweet high tea menu introduction as it was recently changed.

It’s a fantastic place to host a casual business meeting in my opinion over high tea here following their wide selection of in-house blends and recognisable Asian tea choices.

What kept the fire going was after several minutes of being indecisive while looking through the tea menu was Hani, who managed to narrow it down for us after sharing some desirable flavour profiles with her.

We really enjoy our time spent sipping tea and sweets accompanied by Allie’s comforting hospitality!"
Wonderful experience!,"Great food, made better by the excellent service from Allie and team! Allie always makes me feel very welcomed and taken care of throughout the entire time I’m there. Special shout-out to chefs Fritz and Shobit, Allie, Christy, Hani, and Eunice!"

Chef Ganesan came by to chat and gathered feedback.he was very welcoming and extremely hospitable.As our friend was having his birthday Chef very generously came by with another main(butter milk chicken) as a birthday treat!!

Birthday Celebrations @ Rose Veranda,"We have had an amazing lunch cum high tea at the Rose Veranda in Shangri-La Singapore. The food is spectacular that deserves a Michelin star. My friends had the beef ribs that was cook to perfection and I had the chicken which was just so amazing.

Chef Ganesan puts great pride in his cooking. Each of the main course was well presented and from the mash potatoes to the carrots and meat is cooked just right.

We were offered a starter followed by a main course then came a 3 tier desserts with scones & even chocolate in a shape of a koi. I forgot to take a photo of the 3 tier desserts.

The service from the staff at Rose Veranda was excellent. They were there constantly to fill up our tea & water. I would highly recommend it and suggest you make a reservation as it’s quite busy and it’s great value for money."
Fabulous visit to The Rose Veranda. I love it! We will be back!,"It is my bday, I googled for a high tea with lunch combo and found “The Rose Veranda” that fits my need.

I made a wrong booking but luckily the manager Khemika Utoskahti assisted us.

We order an adult and children set. It was so delicious . The manager is so thoughtful, she gave us extra cakes for my 3 kids and a bday cake!

The food is valued for money and the service is awesome! My kids like it very much! They say they want to be back again!"

Nice ambience and great place for couples and friends. Had additional surprise for the Birthday Cake. Highly recommended and will be back for next visit!"
Excellent food and service,"A great place to relax and chill. The food and service is excellent. The servers (Allie, Hani, Christy, Mika) were attentive and friendly. Every dish brought to our table was introduced clearly and that made our experience more memorable. The most unique part of the hightea was the inclusion of a main dish. This elevated the experience of the hightea. We throughly enjoyed ourselves away for the hustle and bustle while we sit back, tuck into the fine bites and sip our tea. Best to go on a weekday which we did (less crowded). They are also child friendly and we will consider bringing our little girl for the next round."
Lunar New Year Hi Tea @ Rose Veranda,"Excellent service as always! Kudos to the team Hani, Christy, Allie & Mika for the awesome job well done! Be back for more!"

Afternoon tea highly recommended quality food servings,"Great value for money afternoon tea. $98++ for a set of 2 which gives you appetizer, main course and desserts to the point you can’t eat anymore!! Excellent quality and 5* for value for money. You can order take away for the same food with fab xmas packaging that’s works perfectly as a gift too! Well done Shangri-La!"
Excellent high tea set n customer service at Veranda,"The set is delicious. It's a Christmas set including a glass of champagne. Love the ambience and also the service.

Would like to compliment Eunice for her wonderful service on food recommendation and explanation of the high tea set. She remembers all our orders and serve the food promptly. Excellent service. Will definitely come again.
Thank you."
Rose Veranda Afternoon Tea,It has been quite a while since I have had afternoon tea at the rose. The main course was divine. Braised short ribs. The sweets were lackluster. Wishing for more choices. Perhaps ala carte buffet.
Pleasant dining experience,Definitely a pleasant dining experience. Have always love their high tea n friendly staff. Food portion is just nice for high tea
Christmas themed High Tea,"Fabulous high tea experience at Rose Verenda. Both savory and sweets were tasty and beautifully presented. Highly recommend the short rib for mains, and the macaroons. My child especially enjoyed decorating the tiered cardboard set for the holidays. Special thanks to chef Ganesan for the smiles from my kid."
High tea at Rose Veranda,"Our first time here and we were pleasantly greeted by the team. The ambience was great and quiet. The food was delicious especially the main courses. Customer service was excellent. A great team here at Rose Veranda. Thank you Hailey, Eunice, Mika and Chef."
Wonderful Service,"I had high tea there this past week and the experience was fantastic! Our server Hailey was brilliant in her attentiveness and promptness. She was also a very pleasant individual to interact with, always smiling and genuine. We were also served by Allie and Mika on occasion and they were very pleasant as well. All in all a wonderful experience."
kalai,"we had a great time . the service of Eunice, Aille and Khemika was extraordinary. They were constantly on the move taking care of every customer’s need.the warmth, ambience and food was very good."
The Rose Veranda High tea,"Fantastic service by Hailey, Allie, Mika and delicious food by chef. Great ambience and atmosphere too, well done"
Awesome High-tea Experience,"Impeccable service, great food, attentive staff with abundance of knowledge in tea, all adds up to give the ultimate in high-tea experience.

Best of all, it is a fulfilling experience with not just the usual small bites, but there's also a choice of mains to fill your stomach up.

We chose the halibut for mains & senior sous chef Ganesan did not disappoint. The skin was fried till crispy golden brown & remained crispy till the end, with succulent tender flesh, accompanied by his own citrus enhanced beet root sauce.

The team of Hailey, Allie, Mika & Eunice, did not disappoint once again, with their patience, attentiveness, & cheerfulness to offer us a super VIP treatment & dining experience!

If an indulgent High-tea experience is what you are looking for, look no further, the Rose Veranda is your best bet IMHO."
An AWESOME place for relaxing lunch and high tea.,"I always like to bring friends to Rose Veranda for lunch with high tea.
Is really a great place to have a relaxing afternoon with nice ambience, excellent service and quality & quantity of food.
Chef Ganesan Ashok, always come to the table for feedback and concerns on our food likings. Is a very nice personal touch. Thank you chef.

Thank you to All the beautiful ladies: Hailey, Eunice, Khemilla & all, For all your excellent & attentiveness service with sweet smiles.

Looking forward to see you all again in Dec when I'm back from Canada.

Take care and stay safe."
made an unforgettable experience in Singapore RV,"I was the first guest that day.
All the food was delicious, but the cream cheese and handmade strawberry jam were especially delicious.
Even the scones were fantastic. As main, I chose octopus, which was an excellent choice. The chewy texture was so good. I can't forget the special taste of the sauce. And the chef who comes out with a special dish and explains the dish... I can't forget that. Sorry i don't remember him name...
Anyway all R.V service was great, Especially, haily, Allie and their manager, Mika, really touched me.
Kindness and delicacy are the basics, and they caught my favorite food and what I felt uncomfortable about it, so I felt like I received really good service and energy as a gift.

Thank you for making a happy time with my friend! I'll visit you again next time.
Luv R.V"
Hi Tea for Birthday Celebration,"Wonderful experience during high tea. Complimentary birthday cake. Staff friendly, polite and helpful especially Hailey."

Birthday Celebration,"Chef Ganesan, thank you for the awesome steak and menu! Not forgetting ur hospitality! Will definitely come back again 🥰.. simply amazing 👏"
"Good service, nice ambience and quality food",Chef Ganesan is amazing and his menu is delicious. He took the time to each table asking if food is ok. He is definitely an asset to the company. Thank you Chef !
Rose Veranda,"Had a really great time with mum(s) at Rose Veranda this afternoon. Thank you to the awesome team on shift today. Thanks ladies :) (Eunice, Khemilla, Hailey & Aille)"
Good food & friendly service,As expected from Shangri-La. Food is good and service is great. Great ambience and a nice quiet place for high tea.
5-star Rose Veranda in a 5-star hotel,"Friday, 1 Oct 2021, my partner and I went to one of our favorite hang-outs: Shangri-La Hotel, Orange Grove Road, Singapore.

We’ve been visiting Rose Verandah since 1992 and their level of service, quality and quantity of meal offerings, and ambience and service remain pleasantly unchanged.

We had high tea. Great value for money.

Ganesan Ashok, senior sous chef, came over to check on us. Nice personal touch. Three wonderful ladies—Hailey, Colleen, and Mika—impressed us with their high level of attentiveness, pleasant disposition, and prompt service. All is all a wonderful experience .

If you have an afternoon to spare, pop over to Rose Verandah, Shangri-La."
CHILDREN’S DAY HIGH TEA!,"We decided to on a early Children’s Day celebration by starting it off with the Children’s Day High Tea!
Ambience, Food and Service was great! We had Mika, Colleen & Hailey who served us and attended to our needs!

The set is for 2 kids, however for us it was more than enough with 1 adult and 1 kid, The high tea set comes with 2 main courses as well. The food was very tasty!
My daughter had hotdog and pasta, I had the salmon with potato gratin. Main courses were big portions too.

We even had the Chef Ganesan Ashok coming out and checking up on the guests to make sure we were happy and satisfied with the food! Along with HighTea Set came along lots of colouring activities.

Definitely will recommend it to anyone else looking at celebrating Children’s Day!"
Birthday celebration!,"Had an excellent family birthday celebration here! Absolutely wonderful food and generous portions with interesting flavour combinations. The high tea set is so worth it for the price and you can really take your time. Outstanding and courteous service from Colleen, Eunice, and Hailey who handled my daughters peanut allergy expertly, replacing items she could not eat. The ambience and service are simply the best! Would recommend this high tea for a special occasion or just a treat for yourself!"
Super friendly and attentive staff,"We celebrating our friends birthday having high tea in Rose Veranda, since we all can't take alcohol the manager Mica making sure that the food is well prepared according to our needs. I was so happy about it but I was more amaze when the chef come out and tell us how he amend the food without alcohol chef Gan explain it's so professionally. Allie also is sweet making sure our table is clean up and check if we have everything that we need. Surely I'll be back to Shang for high tea again. It's all worth it."
Hi tea at Rose Veranda on 4 September 2021,"Had a wonderful hi tea today. Good, quiet n clean ambience. The quality of food is awesome n plentiful. The service staff is very friendly, attentive and meticulously helpful.... thanks so much to the gorgeous team of Allie, Khemika, Hailey n Colleen. It is a steal for the price to pay. Well done and Keep up the good job."
A lovely place to unwind over a leisurely tea,"I've been to the rose verandah a few times but before the pandemic. I decided to take my family for tea, but was a bit wary how the usual sumptuous tea buffet would be served under the table service conditions and pandemic guidelines.
I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the menu and the lovely spread. Great service by the ladies. Beautifully calm atmosphere. And chef Ganesan's personal touch - he was so friendly and made some extra goat cheese sandwiches for us.
Shangrila's rose verandah has not lost its charm. Keep it up!"
Japanese Summer high tea set for takeaway,"Unbelievable flavours from the Japanese Summer high tea takeaway set! It came highly reccomended by Chef Ganesan. The plating was amazingly beautiful and really impressed my dinner guests. Everything was thoughtfully wrapped for easy transport!

I really enjoyed the rich matcha scones (if you are a macha lover its a must to try!!), the yuzu macaron was adorable and bursting with citrus delight, the miyazaki mango tartlet was artfully arranged to look like a rose.

The eel press sushi really stood out in its elegance and flavour, and the teriyaki chicken sandwich was so tender and light!

You can tell that alot of thought went into planning such an exquiste menu utilising many japanese elements and blending it harmoniously into such an amazing high tea set!!

Chef Ganesan, I truly enjoyed it and will be back for more very soon!"
afternoon tea,What a pleasant experience! My frd decide to celebrate my birthday over here at RV. He told that what he made the reservation the staff is very attentive and also offer us a small cake when they found out that I am celebrating my birthday. Overall experience - Since reaching I was usher to our table. Haley offer us some water and patiently explain to us about the menus and it’s related charges. When serving Eunice serve me the food she introduce all the food and it’s ingredients. When my main course was serve the chef actually come to us and suggest us the best way to consume it. I am very satisfied with the way Colleen and Ailee leads the team and what a wonderful birthday lunch I have. Although it’s limit to 2 person due to “COVID-19 HA”. The RV team make up my lose for others friends and I felt that my birthday lunch was celebrated with lots of friends. To the RV team job well done and I look forward to come back when the HA policy eases. Meanwhile Stay Safe! :)
High Tea with a view,Nice and quiet ambience .. attentive service! Interesting to have a main included for the high tea ! Will recommend and will return!
Afternoon Tea at Rose Veranda,"It was a very pleasant experience having our afternoon tea at Rose Veranda...in fact it was our 2nd visit. Serving crew were very friendly and attentive to our special requests. Kudos to Hailey, Eunich and Colleen!"

Excellent service and high tea experience,"Took my mother for a Mother's Day afternoon tea and it was a delightful experience. The food was varied and I loved the options of mains, which essentially meant the afternoon tea can be lunch, if you arrived early enough for that. Chef Ganesan and Chef Friedrich came by and asked whether our food was up to our liking, and they also shared about their plans for Father's Day menu. My parents were so impressed that they are now saying they would like to return next month for another visit. Special thanks to Colleen who recommended teas and dishes according to our individual preference. Social distancing was strictly observed and there was ample space between each group."
Fantastic High Tea experience,"I went to The Rose Veranda during Christmas season. The Location is very beautiful.
I was amazed by the quality of the food. Not too salty, not too sweet. The best High tea experience I had so far in Singapore. The dishes were beautifully presented to Michelin star level.
The chef did prepare special treat for children, which they loved too.
This place is a hidden gem well known to local Singaporean. I really recommend to visit."
Excellent food n service and a great and friendly chef Ganesan Ashok.,we always come Rose Veranda for hightea. its always our 1st choice. cosy n wide variety of nice tea and awesome food. highly recommended! The new menu is awesome with 3 course. super filling. The beef was soooooo GD!
Best Tea Experience,"Post VDate with my friend since our boyfriends are not around, but of course with their consent! Pastries and most esp the main course - angus fillet and black cod, are the best. Chef Ganesan is even very kind to walk around and share his recipe. Even the staffs are very accodomdating! Will definitely recommend this place to our friends!"
Excellent high tea experience,We brought our dad here for his birthday celebration and our family had a wonderful lunch and high tea experience at The Rose Veranda. We had a 3 course meal and we especially liked the mains - honey marinated black cod and grilled Angus fillet. Both were very well prepared and left us extremely satisfied. The staff even gave my dad a complimentary birthday cake to complete the celebration! The relaxing and luxurious ambience was complemented by the excellent service from start to end. We'll definitely be back again!
Lovely RED-themed high tea,"Third time here. Exceptional service and hospitality from the heart as usual from Khemika and the team- thank you for the lovely bubbly white wine. Also, the food was palatable and ‘morerish’, you will want to eat more and more. All dishes were beautifully plated like a stunning art piece by the talented Chef Ganesan- Thank you for making our lunch a most pleasant one! Highly recommended for cosy lunches, you just have to come and dine at The Rose Veranda at least once."
Roseveranda finally reopens! Best hi tea,"#RoseVeranda finally reopens. Though we missed the salad selection but We simply love and enjoyed the elegantly presented new 3 course high-tea - Experience in Red. Icing on the cake.. Come dress in Red and you get a glass of complimentary

Highly recommended for hi-tea lovers

We are so happy to see Chef Ganesan Ashok again and can’t wait to come back to try his Cod dish on Set A menu. Am sure it will be a superb dish just like his other creations.

Also Kudo to Ms Colleen for her impeccable service which made the whole afternoon even more wonderful."
Good Service,"Chef Ganesan Ashok was great explaining the ingredients and cooking of the meal. High tea was nice, not too sweet. Mains were splendid. Highly likely will come back."
Super yummy food and excellent service!,"Went for high tea at Rose Veranda with my cousin, sister and best friend. The service was excellent and the food was amazing! The starters were so unique and delicious. The mains were delicious and I dont even have to mention the desserts : Out of this world! They had apparently just introduced a new concept with the colour red and everything was so attractive and delightful. The staff were so polite, jovial and attentive. Chef Ganesan Ashok personally came over to speak to us and to all the other tables too and explained the different dishes. Hats off to the team at Rose Veranda! Our first visit and definitely won't be our last!"
Yum!,"New concept by RV, super worth it and most importantly it taste superb! 68++ per set for 2! Includes an appetizer, a choice of main course, followed by a 3-tier tea stand to be shared among 2! :)"
Excellent service,"Visited the restaurant for high tea with a friend.
(+) Great buffet spread with a variety of cakes, ice cream and a chocolate fountain, along with some savory items including salads, sandwiches and a selection of meat and cheese. Warm scones were also served to us at our table upon request - loved the scones!
(+) The high tea buffet also included a welcome drink (refillable) and 2 choices of tea. There was a wide selection of tea and other drinks - ordered the lychee and chocolate tea which were delicious.
(+) Service was excellent and the staff were very attentive and prompt in responding to our requests.

(-) While the dessert spread was decent, there could be more interesting and unique flavours.

Nevertheless, the high tea buffet was worth it and the ambience is conducive for meetings with friends. Glad that I managed to visit this place before the circuit breaker started but overall, I recommend this restaurant for fans of high tea buffets!"
On my “Revisit” list,"Earlier in February, I stepped into The Rose Veranda and was immediately welcomed by a staff who ushered me to a table beside a row of floor-to-ceiling glass windows. I sat alone at the table, with perfect acoustics for people watching. The staff attended promptly whenever I had a request and all of them were knowledgeable about the menu. I am especially impressed with the dessert selection near the main entrance of The Rose Veranda. It is absolutely the bomb. I spent the day with a good buffet spread and time went by so quickly. However, if I am to select just one aspect about my Rose Veranda experience, it would be Chef Ganesan - his hospitality and the mastery of his specialty. He took the time to present his creation, explaining its origins and conception. All in all a gustatory delight."
"I'm here so often I have ""a table""","I love this place. I'm always warning welcomed not when I step into rose verandah... but the minute I send in my reservation to the LOVELY ANGEL SONG :) she always makes my day. I first encountered angel when I needed to make special arrangements as I was using a walking stick.. she ensured the lovely ladies took good care of me.
I love being there when ANNA, LINA, JOYCE, and JULIA are working. They are absolutely lovely. :) and you can always tell that they are as happy to see me as i am to see them working.
Chef JACK is lovely too and shared some personal stories when my mom and me went down some time back. :)
One of my favourite people is CHEF GANESAN who never fails to move around table to table and he recognises me too.. ok I do come here often I reckon. His specialties are REALLY specialties..
What a wonderful crew.. my reason for my regular rose verandah visits!"
My favorite all-you-can-eat buffet in Singapore,"After five years in Singapore, I still consider the Rose Veranda as my favorite place to enjoy a buffet (and I have tried a lot).
The combination of great food of various origins, service and atmosphere makes it a great place to relax and please ourselves my wife and I.
This is why we go there twice a month.

Special thanks to chef Ganesan for his incredibly delicious cauliflower or mushroom soups"
Brunch...Lunch...Hi Tea,"This place is open from 12.00pm to 5.00pm. So whether you are here for brunch, lunch, hi-tea, you can have a buffet spread. The ambience is wonderful. The seat are comfortable sofas. Food spread is good. It's a mix of Asian and Western fusion. Wish they had self-made rojak. The sashmi was very fresh and the main roast was fantastic. Dessert section is a joy to watch. Some of the desserts made had intricate details. Insta photo worthy. Overall, a good experience and a beautiful place to treat a friend to his/her birthday party. They even give a free 1/4 kg birthday, which they will pack for u nicely if you can't eat there."
Fantastic personalised service from Chef Ganesan,"We were there for a leisure high tea, 4 adults and 2 kids. We were very happy with their service and am especially impressed by how amicable Chef Ganesan is. He personally served my 2 year old and 4 year old nieces at the ice cream station. When I commented that my mum wanted chocolate ice cream which was not available, he immediately went into the kitchen and whipped out the nicest dark chocolate ice cream ever! What a professional! Thanks! I would go back again."
Lovely place and staff,"Yesterday I went to rose veranda. Welcome drink was very nice I have very good time in Rose veranda Service was kind and so nice I appreciate to them♡(Lina, Julia, Joyce, Arianne) I want to visit next time also"
First visit at Rose Veranda,"02/06/20 I had a first time visit at Rose veranda.

Birthday celebration,"Very cosy and peaceful surrounding.
Staffs and chefs, Jack & Shobhit very helpful and cheerful to serve us. Chefs even baked salmon fish specially for our birthday celebration.
Thanks for making us feel very special."
Nice place and good ambience,Nice place to chill. I love how fresh the prawns were for the Laksa and the cheese platter is great but can be quite hidden away
"Great food, even better chef!","Decided to give rose veranda a try for my friend’s birthday and the experience turned to be a really pleasant one. The staffs were polite and helpful, changing the cutlery and refilling our drinks promptly! Also, Chef ganeson was exceptional and wowed my friends and I with his yummy dishes and hospitality! I will definitely be back!!"
Great service and delicious food!,"We have been regulars at Rose Veranda at Shangri-La Singapore . This time we came with my parents to celebrate their anniversary. We requested for pure vegetarian food and an eggless cake .
From the moment we entered until the time we left , we were given amazing service by the staff.
A special mention for chefs Shobhit and Jack who made sure we have enough variety of vegetarian food . They had prepared so much food for us that we were more than satisfied . Both the chefs were very friendly and helpful and made my parent’s celebration very memorable.
They make it a point to accommodate all kinds of dietary requirements and send everybody back home happy !
Thanks so much !!"
Excellent service from the team at the Rose Verandah,"Birthday celebration at the rose verandah was wonderful. The food there is always of excellent quality and the variety of dessert is excellent. What makes this dining experience even more special was when Chef Jack offered to cook something for my mum who has alzheimers and cannot take regular food. I was pleasantly surprised as i had called earlier to ask if there is the alacarte option and they had said no. Later on, the waitress also asked if we wanted some scones as the chef can bake some for us. Warm scones freshly baked! Really wonderful. The Rose Verandah really stood out when compared to other high tea places!"
Hi,"Came here for afternoon buffet with my friends. Staff Joyce and Lina ,Anne taking good care of us. Nice food selection. Especially fresh warm served scones."
Great food and service,"Chef Shobhit's food is really delicious, the staff were really attentive too. Joyce was often bringing us cutlery and topping up drinks before we even asked for it. Fantastic experience."
5/5,The food and service were very good as usual. Special mention to Ganesan for the awesome service! :)
Good variety and friendly staff,"Great food, wide selection of teas, and excellent service. The staff were helpful and friendly but we were especially impressed by Chef Ashok. Chef Ashok is very dedicated and passionate about his work and it shows in how he interacts with the guest. We were very satisfied that he goes the extra mile to ensure that our dietary preferences (vegetarian) are being accommodated for and that the choices were sufficient for us."
Birthday Celebration with High Tea Buffet,"Good ambience and great service.
Has a wide variety of desserts and main course as well. Would highly recommend the chocolate truffles that are handmade (the chef that made it has 2 Michelin stars btw) and also the different types of tea that are very unique.
Also many thanks to Chef Jack and the staff at Rose Veranda who were very helpful and prompt. Would definitely come here again :)"
Lunch at Rose Veranda,"Superb services rendered! Great ambience and food is good as always. Chef Jack preparing his specialty dish for us was definitely way above and beyond. Restaurant also arranged a birthday cake for me without me mentioning! I wondered how did they know! Definitely caught me by surprise!!
Will come back again soon!"
Great?,Is it a great deal? The cost of the high tea is just a little less than what you needed paid for a lunch buffet so go for the lunch one. But nice environment.
The food and servers are nice,"The food and ambience are nice as well as the servers are very friendly and also very attentive like Lina, Allie, Joyce, Julia, Ann, will definitely come again!!!"
Very nice experience,"The sashimi is very fresh and all the staff Allie, Joyce, Lina , Julia, Ann very nicely and friendly also, me and my friend we all have very good experience at Rose veranda"
Exquisite High Tea Spread,"Had a beautiful high tea afternoon with friends in a lovely setting. Though a buffet, there were no crowds grabbing for food. Rather, a small intimate atmosphere prevailed throughout with impeccable service, attentive detail and outstanding food. Brilliant!"
Feedback,Great ambience!! Friendly and polite staffs. Food is a little limited in varieties but it's still of great quality !!
Best High Tea Hour,Rose Veranda is a great place to catch up with friends and relatives as the buffet lunch cum high tea period allows longer sitting as compared to other places.
