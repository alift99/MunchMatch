Great ambience & service!,"Ambience & service are great. Food is decent, on pricy end. Food wise - Shoutout to Hamachi & Sashimi platter which is really good, tempura & Maki is average."
Wedding Anniversary dinner,"Celebrated our wedding anniversary this year at Sen of Japan after my wife couldn‚Äôt stop raving about the freshness and quality of food when she last stumbled upon this gem in MBS.

She loves the Hotate sushi whilst my favorite had to be the A5 sirloin steak which was soooo good.

service was also exceptional with the service staff constantly topping up our green tea refills and making sure to clear our plates and check in on us.

Would definitely be back! - for sure!"
Great variety of quality food. Generous servings.,"The lunch menu were very reasonably priced with generous servings. However there were some hit and missed.

Terayaki chicken was seasoned well and was a family favourite. Beef steak was well season and cooked with a subtle smokey flavour.

Black cod was slightly overcooked and underseasoned. Beef slice (gyudon) was too mushy, sweet and saucy. Family member who had pork (butadon) had a tough time chewing.

We also ordered ala carte vege tempura (very crunchy and nice) and wayu beef purse with potato (very unique and delicious creation - will definitely order again).

Staff service hit and missed. Manager was thoughtful and noticed that the sun was shining onto my kids and offered to close the blinds. Another was also friendly and kind towards the family. However, maybe it was lunch crowd so finished plates were not cleared as quickly and refill for tea was not done promptly as well. Staff who 1st recieved us also had some attitude / confusion - we were 1st in Q, she had confirmed my name and number of pax, took the menus and was abt to bring us to our seats than she and her partner suddenly decided to serve the next customer in the Q (maybe a VIP? She was very well dressed and there seemed to be a fuss among the staff) and showed her to her seat instead and gave her the menus (similar group size). In the end, after we were shown to our seats - we ended up having to get a menu from the counter ourselves as we couldnt get anyone's attention. Managed to get more menus after we finally got the attention of the staff but she seemed a bit annoyed as if we had disrupted her while she was doing something important.

But nevertheless, would strongly recommend this place. We really enjoyed the food! Make your reservations early!"
Best Japanese food at MBS ! ü§©,"Totally worth the money, the unagi , and the staff so good especially Olivia go try for yourself"
Highly recommended japanese restaurant! The taste is excellent.,"Highly recommended japanese restaurant! The taste is excellent. Love the scallops, blackthroat fish, salmon, chawan mushi,etc."
Yummy,"One of the best Jap food in Singapore. Must visit. Try the aburi salmon maki, uni pasta, sashimi platter"
Wonderful dinner,The wagyu don is fabulous. Highly recommended on the mekajiki steak as well. Great and friendly service. Reservation to avoid disappointment.
GOOD VALUE LUNCH SETS AT MBS,"The iconic Marina Bay Sands MBS is a must stop for all travellers visiting Singapore. MBS is well established as one of two resort styled casinos in Singapore. MBS has all the big brands for high spending individuals. What perhaps,not so well known, is the fact that the place has many food outlets to cater to all food enthusiasts from budget to michelin starred.
If you enjoy japanese food in Singapore,you should try Sen as this is one place to go for value for money japanese food in Singapore. Reservations is a must if you are planning lunch. The place is on Level 1 and has a good view of the City landscape.We ordered the lunch set of black cod, sushi & sashimi and chicken terriyaki. All the three sets were really good value for money."
Gem of Marina Bay Sands Singapore!,"I can't say enough about the service! You do need to prior reservation because this restaurant is extremely popular!
The whole experience was pleasant given that covid rules are relaxed. I would like to praise their staff Ivy & Olivia for their politeness and attentiveness. It's been awhile since I had such a lovely experience.

Last but not least, do order the Black Cod! It's out of the heavens!"
Best Japanese Food in MBS,Food and services are nice. Sushi is fresh and immediately melt in your mouth. End with with their signature dessert Yuzu Cheese. Must try if you visit MBS.
Good for lunch break during working hours,Customer service was prompt and quick. High quality food and wide selection. Ambience is definitely one of the better ones with outdoor viewing from the glass window.
Good visit,"Food is great, fresh and tasty. Came here with my family and had a memorable time. The staffs were also friendly and attentive."
Dinner at Sen of Japan,The Uni Pasta was delicious and black cod soy was nice and tender. Recommended to visit and the service is good too
Good Jap Dinner on the bay,"Lucky to get counter seats without reservation. Order a few items but was a bit disappointed when 2 of what we wanted were not available. Nigiri sushi in the 9 pc set were nice and of generous size. Worth it. I love the tempura which was fluffy and crunchy. Ikura chawamushi is good too although the wait of 20min is a bit long. Upon settling the bill, Redi was really nice to remind us to clock our Sands reward card! Had a good dinner and will be back more often!"
Nice maki,Nice dining environment with a great skyline view of singapore cbd area. Will come back for more :).
Lunch,The lunch hours is crowded reservation is essential. The sushi is niceeeee. The hot green tea is smoothing.

World class food,"This Japanese restaurant was incredible. The food was innovative and amazing. The chefs are fantastic and so are the gorgeous girls who work there, they were so kind and cheerful and remembered what I liked. It was so good we went there 3 days in a row. Big thank you to you all, especially for my green tea ice cream. This restaurant is world class and I would give it 6 stars if I could!"
Great service and food,It was our anniversary but my wife was not fully vaccinated. They allowed us to take the food away and packeted it up nicely and gave us a free dessert for our anniversary. The food was really good even though we traveled home with it. Would highly recommend
Staff need training to make dining here a positive experience.,"Staff need professional training.
We waited in the Reservations queue outside while people in the walk-in queue were given their table first. This wasn't a great sign of things to come.
Eventually we got to our table and the waiting staff just ignored us when we tried to get their attention. We had to get up from our seats and go over to the staff to get their attention.
The staff and the whole front- of- House needs some serious training if they want to take themselves seriously as a premier dining establishment.
The first course arrived but there was no explanation of the various dishes as it was plonked on the table for us.
The food overall was very good but the whole experience just wasn't an experience. There were no small touches that could make the very good food a spectacular experience.
Staff are poor and the management are absent as they don't notice.
There will be no return visit."
Yummy food and excellent service,"Love the food in this restaurant n the ambience . We had black cod and Makijiki swordfish steak . Both very tasty n beautifully presented . They presented me with a surprise birthday cake too

Special Thanks to Colour for her smily n warm service recommending us dishes so yummy

Thanks colour . You have pride Sen for such service every diner world want to come Back again . Good job . Even the green tea she takes effort to brew it well

We will be back definitely.

John & Judy"
Seafood don seafood are frozen seafood.,"The service is good. But the set lunch, seafood don, is not really good as the fried seafood seems to be from frozen food rather than freshly fried."
dinner at sen of japan,"the restaurant atmosphere is superb and the chef Yow Mun Fei take a very good care during our dinner. Nice food, superb Japanese cuisine and the quality of ingredients"
Food was amazing will definitely come back again!,"Went to lunch a couple time at sen of Japan MBS, food was amazing and never disappoint, we sat on the sushi bar and have a small talk with the chef, especially chef Fei, very friendly and full of knowledge of the ingredients, it was a great lunch definitely will come back for more!"
Go for the set lunch bento,"Good value for their set lunch bentos. Menu also catered for a variety of diners - there were a chicken, pork, beef and sashimi/sushi options. Hmm... not really vegetarian friendly though! But will definitely go again for the bento set lunch!"
One of the best Japanese restaurants in Singapore,The food was incredibly yummy and the service was excellent. Thanks Color (very unique name) for the great service and recommendations on food. Will definitely visit Sen of Japan again‚Ä¶..soon!
Non-existence queue management,"Non-existence queue management. Everyone was just crowding around and squeezing their way in, and felt just like a market."
Best Japanese Food on town,My family celebrated my 26th anniversary with Sen of Japan on 2 Dec. Kelvin and his team impressed my family with his recommendation on the varieties of food they provided. The service was good and the food is so delicious and unforgettable . My wife and I have been thinking of the food after days from our visit. Strongly recommend Sen of Japan for your special event and do look for Kelvin and his team to recommend the wonderful food to complete the celebration. Best Japanese restaurant in town.
Overrated,Restaurant didn‚Äôt meet expectation. Service was average & the portion of food is not enough considering I‚Äôm a small eater. The price for the set lunch could be lower.
Great Japanese Food with Excellent Service,"Dining here was a memorable experience. This is definitely one of the go to spots for Japanese food in the Marina Bay Area. The food exceeded my expectations. The sashimi was amazing. The fish was extra fresh. The drinks were a bit pricey but they‚Äôre well worth it to partake with the food. What stood out was their exceptional service, with a special mention to Ellie, one of their staff who was extra hospitable and explained their dishes thoroughly and who made us feel cozy and comfortable in dining there."
Great food! Great service! Great ambience!,"I was here with my hubby for our Wedding anniversary dinner. Sen of Japan is by far the best Japanese restaurant in Singapore which we frequented the most. We are always greeted by their friendly staff. Especially Color. She always has the best recommendation for us that suit our tatse. She will make an effort to understand our taste and that make us feel appreciated.

We especially love the udon here. I love their cold udon as the udon is very springy. My hubby and daughter love their hot udon.
Their sashimi, Carpaccio, carbless maki, pizza are definitely a ‚ÄúMust‚Äù order items when we are here at Sen of Japan.

Overall we feel very comfortable and happy dining in Sen of Japan. Highly recommended!"
Great time - great food,"I was there with a friend to celebrate my birthday. The food was amazing, very fresh products. The service was superb. The staff gave a good recommendation and very friendly. They even gave me a piece of cake with candle.
Highly recommended if you want to enjoy fresh product, with a good service."
"Friendly team, delicious food, valuable price!","Sens of Japan is by far the best Japanese restaurant i had visited. First, their staff is super friendly, especially Colour. she has the best recommendation for me everytime. repeated visits are always comforting as she knows my preference and always prepare hot tea for me before i even need to order. lunch deals are super worth it and the gyu don are the best in Singapore. no doubt!
Chef are friendly too! chat with them when you have a chance to sit on counter seats,

Denise Tan"
Lunch,Good and efficient service. Food was excellent. Servings were of good portions and adequate. Quite a relaxed ambience.
"Great ambience, attentive staff, amazing food!","Staff were amazing, and were attentive to the needs of the table! Simple things like topping up the water when we are done, or in my case, waiting till my friend arrives before serving the starters."
Warmth service,"The sashimi was great! Apart from food, the service was excellent too! Definitely recommend people to try it!"
Terrific Experience at Sen of Japan,"Booked this place last minute for Birthday celebration due to sushi craving, managed to only secure counter seats (best thing ever) - Mr Fong the sushi chef is very knowledgable and chatty with our short encounter and recommended various different sushi to us. Quality of food is great, the conversation was great.
To top things off - they gave us a complimentary dessert to celebrate birthday !

Thank you Chef Fong and team!"
"Awesome Experience, Superb Service and Excellent Food Quality","Service:
Have been here countless times and would say that the quality of the food and service has been very consistent. The staff was very friendly despite busy hours and even take the initiative to get to know the customers personally. I recall dining with my sister at the bar counter where the Chef has made the extra effort in engaging us, sharing interesting insights about Japanese food and culture.

Food:
Some may be of the opinion that the food is on the pricier end. However, in comparison to the high quality and variety offered in Sen of Japan, one would regard this as Value for Money. The portions may not look as big in the photos, but they sure are enough to make me get a food coma.

Atmosphere:
Great place for family dinner, dinner with friends, and even dates! Perfect place for a cozy meal with high-quality and authentic Japanese food.

Overall:
One reason my family and I re-visits this restaurant so often is because of the consistency in high-quality food and services, where the worry of quality food is taken away. Go give it a try, you won't regret it!"
Delicious Japanese Food!,Visited Sen of Japan the moment dining in was allowed again. I was thoroughly delighted by my meal there. The sashimi is fresh and delicious and I enjoyed my entire experience there. The chefs are friendly as I opted to sit by the counter in front of the chefs. The service by the service team was also friendly and good. Overall a good Japanese restaurant and one that I would recommend to my friends. Can't wait to be back!
Great service and experience. Excellent food,Colour gave us great service and recommendations that made us so delighted! Food and sake were excellent! We will be back. Thank you!
Happy experience,"Invited my 2 frens for lunch. Their first at Sen Of Japan....very delightful lunch - yummy Oishi meals, calming ambience ( despite the depressing pandemic news and Heightened alert of no-dine starting tmw ) and happy cheerful service from staff. Will definitely come again."
Refreshing menu with good service and location,"Made impromptu plans and the staff was very cordial to accommodate our request. Had a great lunch with excellent Japanese menu - scallops were fresh and beautifully presented, minced Wagyu Panko was something new and loved it, Salmon Aburi Maki was melt in the mouth and Wagyu steak is a must have. Staff were very pleasant and attentive to details. Overall a lovely experience and was left wondering why we haven't been here before."
Great Japanese restaurant with nice ambience,"My sister and I love to eat here because theyre really genourous with their fish portions and the quality is always so fresh and reliably delicious(LOVE the carbless maki). I also really love the great service and friendly staff here. Big shoutout to Redi who recognised we were Thai and struck a conversation with us. It was really refreshing to speak with someone who could understand my native tounge, and also she gave awesome recommendations for things we should try. My only issue is the cold green tea seems very think and concentrated, but i think thats a personal preference because my sister doesnt mind at all. After all the chaos of covid Im so glad we can dine in again and cant wait to come back again soon!"
Business lunch with nice view,Our lunch set and sashimi moriawase were great - fresh and delectable! Made a note that it's a business lunch and the restaurant arranged a very suitable table for us. The staff were attentive and the service was prompt. Great restaurant!

Review: Sen of Japan,"1st visit to this small gem tucked in the left wing of Marina Bay Sands shoppe. 1st impression of the place was good as they have this appealing modern Japanese restaurant vibe. Went straight to ordering and it took around 15 minutes or less before our 1st bite. We ordered oysters, sashimi, nigiri sushi, and maki. The food was amazing. I had good sushi before and this was easily in the top 10 list. I would definitely recommend this place if you‚Äôre craving for Japanese food and you‚Äôre in the vicinity. I always pay attention to the service staff. Our service staff for the night was Eille and she was really fantastic. She made us feel very comfortable and checked on our food every now and then. After our meal, she checked on our experience and what we liked and disliked. All in all, a very satisfying experience. Would recommend this place but do make reservations to avoid having to wait for seats as it gets pretty crowded as dinner time approaches."
First Day of Dine In!,"Right after dine in was allowed we came to Sen of Japan. We were seated in a beautiful table with great views of the Marina Bay. Food was delicious but the service was flawless. We really love the friendly and warm service from Color, Feng and Ivy. Dining here always makes us feel at home. Will definitely come back again just for the service!"

Excellent foods & service,"Excellent foods with wonderful service . Sashimi was fresh with good cut. Omi wagyu beef melts in the mouth. Disappointed frozen prawn was used for the Ebi Tempura , feedback to the staff and they apologised and immediately canx the order. Looking forward to returning soon to try the rest of the menu !"
Exquisite Food with Wonderful Service,"The food are all amazing. Didn‚Äôt manage to photograph all the food we had. (P.S. it‚Äôs too irresistible till I forget to take photo)

Best recommended dish are the Omi A4 Wagyu steak and the fish of the day (I couldn‚Äôt remember the name of it) .

I will definitely visit again."
"Nice value, high quality food","They got several stables that we crave from time to time, the place is conveniently located and reasonable-priced. The ingredients are fresh and can cook to your customised requirement. The staff are easy-going and attentive. We like this place."
Best Service and Great Food !,"One of the best restaurant in MBS. Great food & Drinks! Esp the oysters. It was super fresh and delicious. Top Notch Service by Feng, Redi & Ivy! Good job!"
Fantastic food and top notch service,"Food are extremely fresh! The service of Ivy, Redi, Colour and Feng always make me feel at home! My favourite japanese restaurant in Singapore."
Excellent food as always along,Excellent food as always along with awesome service. Staff always friendly and accommodating - the food is just amazing (selection of dishes shown).
Gorgeous fresh Sashimi & great maki combinations,"Knocked off a star for the frumpy waitresses but if you overlook that, you can't help but be impressed by the fusion cuisine here.

It's still inherently japanese but they've brought it up a notch with their inventive seasonings. It works on the palates for sure.

We loved the thick-cut sashimi as others have pointed out here and we've sworn off Wheelok Place 'Sun with Moon' after trying their maki.

The wagyu is a winner, the meltingly buttery cod will blow your mind and the tuna tataki seals the deal. Just avoid the aburi sushi platter. Ours was served dry and overdone. Probably a noob in the kitchen having a kick out of the blow torch at our expense.

We haven't yet had a go at their desserts in any if our visits. Perhaps one day."
WHAT A DELIGHTFUL DINNER!,"Everything we ordered were outstanding. The sashimi (14 pieces for $98) was extremely fresh with some literally melt in the mouth. I wasn‚Äôt exaggerating. The uni pasta ($38) infused with truffles was da bomb.

The missing star is due to the ambience which in my view is lacking."
Excellent food and excellent,Excellent food and excellent service. Thank you Chef and Staff employees for taking care of us. Nice presentation food and I will definitely come again next time. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Amazing food and service,Amazing food and service from the team!! Chef Mun Fei was good in recommendations !! Definitely will come back again!
Fabulous dinner!,"Fabulous dinner! Food was great, ambience was great. We were served by Dolly - a wonderful hostess. Highly recommend the Maguro Pizza and Black Cod Fish. Extremely delicious! Will definitely come back again!"
Perfect dinner experience!,"The food was super nice, very fresh and beautifully displayed. Overall the service was excellent, special call-out to Color who took super good care of us. Thanks for making the evening a memorable one!"
Overall Good,Quality of food is good. Price is reasonable. but the location of the shop is difficult to find. It too me almost 25 mins to find the location.
"Amazing food, even better service",Food is amazing. Tried the Maguro Pizza that was recommended and was blown away. The servers made us feel comfortable and was very accommodating. Definitely will return again!!
Great Jap food,"Sushi was very fresh, felt like we were in Japan. Great service from Tze and Color. Sushi nigiri moriawase, maguro pizza and black cod were all amazing. Good green tea too!"
Yummy and friendly !,"Sen of japan , quality sashimi and extremely friendly service team members . Highly recommended for people who loves Japanese food ! Great place to be!"
Never disappointed! Highly recommended Japanese restaurant,"Thanks Ivy recommended this restaurant to having dinner with my friend. All The products were fresh and the dishes had the warmth, Especially I like their tuna pizza, suitable all the person who don‚Äôt like eat raw food, won‚Äôt feel that fishy smell. Thankfully the waitress (Feng,Ronald and Redi) great service to serve all night."
Excellent Food. Exceptional Staff.,"I have been here several times, and I have never been disappointed. The food is consistently outstanding as its staff."
A Different type of Japanese Cuisine,"Apart from the usual Japanese food like Sashimi (which were very fresh)/Sushi/Maki and Tempura, this restaurant has fusion food such as Maguro Pizza (which is a must try), Chicken Teriyaki (which sounds normal but tastes super delicious), chicken gyoza and chicken karaage which were surprisingly good as well.

Something special would be the mekajiki steak which was oozing with fish oil and their A5 Wagyu and Omi A4 which were really tender and well marbled.

Ending our meal with their special pumpkin ice cream (another must try) and their yuzu cheesecake which was sour and sweet at the same time was really refreshing.

Special mention to the chefs who deliver such great and fast food consistently despite the restaurant being packed and all the amazing staff who provided great service.
Definitely worth a visit."
Good Service,"Recommended by a friend to try Sen of Japan and the food turn out to be real good especially the teriyaki chicken and another favourite dish is their maki. Not forgeting the dessert, personally I love their yuzu cheese cake! Sweet & sour and so appetising! Thanks to Charleston recommendation!!"
Must order maguro pizza,"Had an early Christmas dinner with my good bunch of friends. I must say food was pretty impressive especially maguro pizza. Its bluefin tuna, mayo with truffle decorated with gold flakes. The combination with the perfectly sliced thin crust was just pure tasty. Truly impressed. We had many other dishes including sashimi, mala maki, aburi maki, swordfish (both sashimi and grilled), teriyaki chicken, karaage and desserts. With all good food comes with a good bottle of sake (Hakurakusei) brewed by Niizawa Japan which is extremely smooth. All in all, happy with the food and service!"
Outstanding Service,Went there for dinner with a few friends and the food was amazing and most importantly outstanding service.
Wonderful experience,Staff service is brilliant especially Charleston. He has been really helpful and friendly. Food quality is good and fresh. Will definitely come back again.

"Good food, excellent service!","Friendly and attentive services makes me feel like I am dining at home! Walking in to Sen of Japan at MBS Level 1 with my colleague, we received a very warm welcome from a young lady with smiley ‚Äòeyes‚Äô - staff Ivy. She came forward to introduce to us the seasonal items and various ongoing promotions we could benefits from dining at the restaurant. We heed to Ivy‚Äôs recommendations and ordered Mala-Maki, grilled salmon & braised pork belly and we wrapped up our lunch with pumpkin ice cream with puffed rice! The ice cream has a unique taste and not too sweet. We love it! Food is good and freshly prepared by the chef at the counter. Separate cutlery were served without asking (that‚Äôs why I said excellent service!). Dishes were collected after we finished our meal to give us more space and comfort at the restaurant, thumbs up! Overall the food and service are good, we will definitely come back again!"
