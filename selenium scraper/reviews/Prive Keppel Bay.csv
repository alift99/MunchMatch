Prive@Keppel,"Excellent service, great ambience. Great food but a tad pricey. The cakes were food too. Too bad it was raining. Would definitely go again."
Much to be desired,"It rained earlier before we arrived, however, it stopped and the rain never came back.
Though on booking, I asked for outdoor. I was ushered indoor( there were people sitting outdoor and also empty tables were available).
I requested for outdoor and also stated that through my booking, I specifically asked for outdoor. They were most hesitant and told me they will have to go through their manager.
Upon a nod from the manager, we were seated outdoor.
There was this huge ugly looking plastic draped all over. Mind you, the rain has stopped for about 1 hour already.
The food was mediocre. We knew that as we have eaten there before.
We went there for the ambience and that was also gone. On top of it, I asked them to check on my prive perk card and they said it‚Äôs not on the system.
I message them through Instagram the next day and was told my membership was still active.
This goes to show, if you hire staff that is not knowledgeable, you infuriate customer.
A infuriated customer is almost a lost cause.
With high competition in the food industry in Singapore. My advice is treasure every customer you have, especially the returning customers.
Hang on to them with your dear life because if things do not go well, you will lose them forever.
As much as you need to lure new customers, it is the existing ones that are most valuable.
They are your invisible talking advertisement.
By the way, I‚Äôm still waiting for them to come back to me on my membership number.
Let‚Äôs see how long it takes"
Lovely Evening - beautiful location,"Good food, lovely weather, decent service(though seemed understaffed). Drinks menu could be better. Enjoyed the evening."
Lunch @ Kepple Bay,The ambience was awesome coupled with the fact the we were blessed with such good weather. However the standard of food has dropped. Especially the local delights like Laksa and Chicken Rice. It did not taste close to the actual dish.
Out of Singapore for 90 minutes,"It is the perfect environment and great service that took us 'out of Singapore' for 90 minutes. Tasty and well-presented food with a service that was faster than expected, made our experience complete. We will be going there again."
The food is not hot enough,The food is not hot enough. In fact I ordered a mushroom soup and expected it is hot. But turn out it is just warm. it seems that it was prepared for long time. The other food I ordered has the same problem.
Nice Brunch time,Able to do brunch in weekday before 11am and we enjoyed it with great atmosphere & service. Will love to visit again.
"Gets the trifecta right - food, service and diverse options","Good restaurant with decent food, good service and many vegetarian and vegan options along with meat dishes."
Average but pricey food. View was alright,"Food tasted average at best and portion was also alright but does not justify the price. If i hadnt ordered the half and half pizza, i would have thought it was a reheat if a frozen pizza. The view was also nothing to shout out about."
Great service,"The manager was kind to allow us an outdoor seating (limited due to public holiday) when I explained that my father in law has difficulty breathing in air con room.

When we accidentally spilled a latte, they gave us a new one at no extra charge. Awesome service!"
Service,Good service. Staff were attentive. Food is good. Plus another place to bring my üê∂ü§ó besides the Botanic Garden. Will visit again.
Unusually bad service at Prive Keppel,"Took ages for my glass of wine to arrive....nearly 15 minutes after a reminder. The pizza was awful. Soggy, undercooked, wayyyy too much cheese. It was like a bad frozen pizza. The wine was dreadful too.The service was really poor. Extremely slow and inattentive. We had to wait ages for the bill and there was an issue with our membership points. Also, the fan by our table was extremely old and noisy, so even though I was hot I had to switch it off as I couldn't hear what my husband was saying!! I had mentioned that it was my husband's birthday on the notes section of the online booking form and I have seen on other occasions people getting a little birthday cake for this. However, nothing appeared so I was quite disappointed in this, especially as we are members and quite regular customers. All in all it was a very disappointing experience. I have been to Prive and enjoyed myself there on so many occasions; I have recommended it to friends too but on this occasion it fell far short of expectations . Very sad!!"
fantastic host,Umi was just the right 10/10 staff to make my son's birthday celebration a memorable one. She was accomodating and understanding in every aspect. Even gave my boy small toy to keep him busy.
Great food,"Love the environment; fast service . Food tasted great ! Love the salads ! So amazingly yummy ! Wished there were more options for small bites though like more soup choices ; things like mozzarella sticks, seafood gambas , nachos (can‚Äôt recall if that‚Äôs on the menu ); grilled veggies .. things like that ."
Dinner,"The staff were all so accommodative and so kind. We enjoyed our dinner so much. The food was fast too, lucky, cux we were all famished"
Favorite restaurant,"Priv√© is one of our favorite restaurants in Singapore because of the quality of the food, setting and service. Kids love their impossible beef pasta, while us adults love their salads. They have great desserts too!"
Great food and view!,"Love the food, especially their truffle wings! Sat at the outdoor with a view. Brought my Mum there and she loves it too! Will definitely come back again!"
Good ambient!,"The ambient is good just that the layout a bit messy.
The food is fantastic and served in a very nice presentable manner.
The wine though it‚Äôs price is a bit stiff was good.
The waiter & waitress are not attentive and must constantly be catching their attentions for services."
Nice location but below average food,"The food was below average. I asked for no chilli in the pasta and it came with chilli but they did replace it with another one. The beef steak was the worst. Initially, they served me a steak that was almost raw. The replacement steak was so hard to chew. As for the pizza, it looked and tasted like frozen pizza you buy from supermarket."
Birthday Celebration,"Thank you for accommodating the birthday request! We had a nice view for dinner (outdoor) and everything is perfect! The sea breeze with delicious food in our tummy definitely makes our Christmas night memorable~ Without a doubt, we will come back next time for special occasions :)

The staff are friendly and efficient too!"
Priv√© Keppel Bay for a different experience!,Good food. Service is prompt and attentive. Highlight was the ambience and quality of food! Highly recommended. Parking is easy and charged per entry - hassle free.
Poor food.,"Food was disappointing, ambience spoilt by fan too strong.

Steak was tough when it was supposed to be medium, parts were of it were well done. Side salad looked like it was dumped onto the plate and fries were wet.

Gula melaka cake was dry. Options for happy hour were limited.
Fan blew the salad off the plate."
Nice view of Keppel's Bay,"Overlooking the sea allows you to feel as if ur relaxing at a beach resort's restaurant. We had the truffled field mushroom madness pizza which is definitely a great match given the ambience. Besides that, the service was fast and efficient. Overall it is a place I would love to return to again to enjoy the other foods as well."
Poor food quality,Casual business dinner Spaghetti was over done and meat was hard and tasteless Dessert Tiramisu was badly prepared Not how tiramisu was supposed to made
Great Ambience and Friendly Staff,I went to this outlet for my Wedding Anniversary. I love the atmosphere with the restaurant overlooking the yacht bay. Food was good and staff were friendly extending their recommendations.
Great first time!,"It was my first time here with my partner for her birthday and was warmly welcomed and serviced by an excellent waiter by the name of ‚ÄòChee Yuan‚Äô who was very thoughtful and did his best to get us a nice seat as well as make it a fantastic experience. The steak was also exceptionally delicious, would definitely return again!"
Dinner,"Breathtaking view at keppel Bay with good service and surprised us with slice of cake .. Very relaxing , clean dining place . Food presentation was good and taste good."
Great visit,Great customer service who assisted in my large booking of 16pax. Food was good and great service which brightened up the rainy day.
Always a winner,"We love coming to the Keppel Bay location - such a cool vibe and buzz. Food was great, and whoever that young woman was that was serving (small lass, loads of curly hair tied back) she was brilliant - someone give her a pay rise."
Team Lunch of 14pax,We had a good time. Pre-ordered the food and all served swiftly. Waiter was awesome! Should have noted his name. Food was really good. Dessert was even better. Thanks 4e wonderful experience
Good Ambient and tasty food,went there to celebrate birthday. very good ambient and the pasta is tasty too. will come back again.
Great atmosphere,"It was a farewell dinner for my colleague. The environment was great! Service was attentive, patient and responsive!"
Beautiful View but food is not as delicious as before üò•,"Food was not as delicious as last time. Brought family and friends to celebrate friend birthday. All said the same thing, food was so so only, nothing special. In fact, quite disappointing. Only the view is great. Service was good too."
Not so good,"Had a birthday celebration at the restaurant and unfortunately food didn't turn out to be expected. My colleague had to return her fish and chip as it was not thoroughly cooked.

The mushroom soup which I ordered was rather watery but I guess taste us subjective to individuals. Feedback from my the other colleague on his beef burger was rather dry as well. Only positive feedback was the chili crab pasta."
Nice view,The view is nice you can see many boat stopby. Near to vivo city can go by bus or grab. The food is good~ Recommend to make reservations before go. Sometime alot people.
Food quality is horrible,"I was there on Sunday, 20 November 2022 for late lunch with my friend. Ordered Hainanese chicken rice, quality of the chicken is horrifying and the taste is horrible. Quality and quantity. Paying $19.50 for it, it's really so not worth at all. I did not eat much of the chicken. The colour of the chicken skins is very yellow, and the meat is not white in colour. The meat was tough to eat. The chicken meat is not fresh. I will never order that again."
Excellent service,It was a nicely pre-arranged table with sea view. Much Appreciated. My first date and I had a great time.
A Hidden Gem,"Brought my overseas friend here for her birthday celebration. She adore the view and appreciate the great hospitality/attentive staffs. Thank you for a wonderful experience, will visit again!"
Great ambiance but Salads not worth it,"I have been to Priv√® several times. And I have really enjoyed their dishes.
I love their service and ambiance at Keppel Bay with beautiful yachts in the backdrop. Mains and appetisers are pretty decent. However, the salads are totally not worth it. The humus has this zing taste of staleness and most of the ingredients seem to come out of a tin can. Not worth the money to spend on it. I have tried quite a few times hoping for a change but always disappointed.

Rest all is good. Deserts and coffee pretty nice.

Thanks"
"Great food, amazing staff and a nice view","Visited the place for the first time, to celebrate my first wedding anniversary. They had a great selection of vegetarian and vegan options. Everything that we ordered tasted great and the quantity was sufficient. The staff was hospitable and provided ample information when asked. Would definitely go back again.

Only thing that can be improved is introduction of some sort of electronic call button. Being a big place, getting attention of staff was a bit hard, at times, but barely affected our experience."
Awesome service with an Amazing view,"My family's and my go to place for Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner, rain or shine ! Whenever we think of a Nice place, Great service - it's Prive @ Keppel Marina! Henry & his team provides Top Notch service at all times, even on busy days with Awesome Attitudes and Caring Service. Keep up the great work team ! And many thanks for all your thoughts and assistance !"
Horrible cold poached eggs,"Went for brunch while parents visiting as setting is really nice.

A few of us ordered dishes with poached eggs. Arrived stone cold, like they had been in a refrigerator. Horrible horrible taste.

Sent them back. Came again, same thing so sent back. Third time, still cold. Asked how this is possible. Staff informed that they poach the eggs beforehand and put into refrigerator then tip warm water over outside to prepare them. Never heard of this before, they were just inedible, I don‚Äôt know how anyone could eat them. Worst eggs I‚Äôve ever encountered. So disappointing."
Nice place to chill,Great environment and atmosphere. The service staff were attentive and helpful in recommending dishes. We were seated seated is s corner but never faced any problem getting the attention of the service staff.
Lunch,We visited over lunch and the food was well prepared. Outdoor seating facing Keppel yacht made for pleasant lunch for my guests.
Friendly staffs and awesome dinning environment,"Was there for a friend's birthday celebration. Greeted with friendly staffs and they are super attentive througout the dinning session. Foods generally are ok but prices are quite expensive. Try the Happy hours cocktails and they are good.
My friend was given a piece of complementary red velevet cake together with a giant birthday card from the team. We also order another piece of mud pie cake and they were very tasty. Will definitely go back again for the cakes and drinks."
"The food was terrible. But the environment, service, and drinks helped make it bearable","The food was terrible. But the environment, service, and drinks helped make it bearable. Brought my working team of 22pax there. It cost me more than $2,200. The food used to be good. But it was very disappointing today. Everything tasted like oven-cooked food. The drinks (including beer) were good but expensive."
Nice staff,Nice and attentive staff. Particularly the Chinese uncle stationed near the door/outdoor area. Very friendly and helpful. Sorry didn't get his name. Very kind and warm service. Food was served very fast despite coming on Saturday noon. Ultimate breakfast looks good but was average. Laksa pasta (new item) and Mushroom swiss burger was good. Overall very happy with visit. Free birthday cake (red velvet) was dry but nice gesture nonetheless
"Lovely environment, Good service and Amazing food","Wow!! By the food options, wish I have more tummy space for it! The environment was lovely, like a secret sanctuary away from the crowd. The staff were attentive, which makes the experience pleasant."
Very average,"Food was not tasty, only the view was good, staff were very friendly and provided good service but the food was not worth the price and most of it was tasteless"
"Nice atmosphere, especially for those with kids","Came here together with kids to celebrate our anniversary.

Nice indoor place with a cosy kids corner and love the playground outside.

We took the indoor seating, but seem like the kids prefer more outdoor.

I would have seated outside and probably let the kids have more of their playground time.

The Homestyle Pancake was one of my favorite.

Nice and friendly staff that tend to our needs.

I would also like to thank the staff who served the cake for our anniversary."
Great views and atmosphere with disappointing food!,"Great views and atmosphere with disappointing food and cocktails was just ok. My slipper lobster linguine was a very small lobster with linguine swimming in a tomato soup almost. Hubby's carbonara was also swimming in a sea of cream sauce which is definitely NOT what carbonara should be! Expensive prices with just average quality. They definitely need to get better chefs there for where it is! Bloody Mary was over peppered and certainly weak and diluted! Awful dining experience, we won't be back!"
Nice place,"the place is great. worth to visit ones in a while. the food was ok. i hope they have medium-rare doness for the steak coz the medium was just hard and not nice.
the caesar salad is superb, not a fan of salad but this is just great. The price is a bit on the high side with GST and service charge is just....... the staff are helpful and service is quite fast nonetheless."
Impeccable service,The service crew is great. Friendly and attentive. I left my hat on the chair and left. The manager went all the way to the carpark to wait for us to pass it back to me. Thank you so much.
Wonderful dining experience for a birthday celebration!,Lovely team you have.. the whole dining experience is awesome! From call reservation to restaurant serving team.. everyone provided excellent customer service to patrons which made us feel so good! Keep up the good working attitude and will visit your restaurant again soon!
Bad Customer Care.,"Service was bad. We were walked -in customers for dinner. Cafe not fully subscribed, plenty of vacancies. Waiter simply not attentive, customer courtesy was not there. Showed us to a barren weather beaten wooden table with a two seater bench. Expressed our annoyance with the table choice and the lack of attention. The waiter apologised and gave excuse that he was preoccupied. We decided to change our table and saw no reason to put up with the offered table. The waiter, realising his negligence/attitude, became more cautious and attentive serving us."
Exception experience,We were sad that there was no outdoor seats available due to ths rain but was glad that the experience had made up for it. The food arrival was prompt after ordering and the waiters were friendly and helpful esp the one who was attending to us. (I forgot to asked for his name). He was friendly n helpful and cheeeful.
Family dinner,"The food is delicious , so fast to serve. We received a complimentary cake for Our Anniversary. Thank you"
Fried Rice,Fried Rice was a disappointment. The rice seriously not sure what rice did they used. Please look into it.
Good location. Rest all is just Average,"It's a restaurant for the view and location. Not definitely for the food. Food was just average and definitely costly.
Roasted chicken lacked in flavor and tasted like chunks of meat with salt. Apple crumble served was dense . For kids pasta only frozen vegetables were used . Overall experience was and ""No"" for another visit or recommendation"
Disappointing,"My husband and I ordered the chilli and lime salmon and breakfast platter. My kids had carbonara. Everything we ordered tasted really bad. The food was not even hot and looked pre cooked. I booked this place to celebrate my daughter‚Äôs 8th birthday. Even my 8yr old daughter was questioning why I chose this eatery as all the food tasted bad.

We did not finish our food. Everything was left half eaten. Left the restaurant disappointed, dissatisfied and hungry!
Wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone else."
Breakfast served cold,"Nice ambience but food was disappointing. Ordered their All Day Breakfast- Eggs Benedict & Eggs Royale, both were served cold, taste below average and definitely not worth the price. Not sure if we would go back again.."
Very disappointing,"I can only agree with the previous person who wrote a review: it was the 3rd time we ate at Prive Kepple but it will be the last despite the amazing setting.
Our starters and main courses were served at the same time, nothing was hot enough, the burger was tasteless, and I could have prepared the salmon better myself‚Ä¶ they certainly need to hire proper chefs in the kitchen and not dish out food that‚Äôs been waiting to be reheated. And it‚Äôs not even good value.
The staff was friendly enough though not very attentive but was very surprised to hear that the food was pretty awful, when asked.
Very disappointing."
Terrible food at a prime location,"Disappointing food quality. Skip the burger, steak and cakes. Service was passable. Will not recommend."
Breakfast at Priv√© Keppel Bay,The view is only reason why we go here. Intially the food was good but since 2020 the food standards have dropped drastically. Some staff make a genuine effort to make your experience a memorable one while some staff will scar you for life. The kitchen needs to get some qualified people to cook. The food was cold & sugar sachets was given in our hand (not sure of the hygiene given that Covid is still lurking in the corner) The hostess at the entrance wasnt wearing any employee tags so it was hard to say whether she was dining there or working.
Great brunch and friendly staffs,"The staffs are super friendly and considerate. Food is great and quick to serve as well, family are happy dining out here."
Nice and cosy area to hang out,Very friendly staffs but the roasted chicken that we ordered was not fresh. Quite disappointed. Not really worth it in term of price wise.
Lovely,Ambience was lovely. My kid loved the playground. Celebrated my spouse's birthday there and the staff gave us a very lovely bday card ‚ù§Ô∏è will come again.
Night out,"Ambiance is nice
Pizza acceptable (hawaian pizza)
Fries - 1st order was perfect but the 2nd one was soggy
Drinks:
Daiquiri : 7/10
Mojito: 2/10 it's too strong, not refreshing as it should, all you can taste was alcohol and mint like toothpaste
Lychee martini: 2/10 too strong as well, might as well order a shooter and not cocktail
Gummy bear margarita: 5/10
Long Island tea: 4/10 super weird after taste
Singapore sling: 7/10"
Fab!,Delicious food away from the crowd and with wonderful services. The standard of the food here is so much better than the other branches.
Food is very nice,"Overall the food is yummy, it's value for money. Atmosphere and ambient is good. Staffs there are polite and acting fast."
birthday celebration,had a wonderful birthday celebration at Prive. they gave us a cake and huge birthday card! highly recommended. thank you Prive
Good for Families,"Prive Keppel Bay is fantastic for families with their outdoor seating and playground and great kids menu. Their adult menu, however, can be greatly improved, especially for those prices. Overall taste is average (below for some items) for the main courses and the only saving grace the delicious desserts. We keep coming back as our daughter loves it there but we do hope the dishes can be improved, or at least the happy hour prices reduced ($14++ for a pint!)."
My go to place for food and service anytime :),"My family and I had a 1pm lunch yesterday,
17Jul, at the Keppel Bay Marina Prive.

The overall customer experience was good fr the smiling staff who came to guide us to the table (she was smiling behind her mask as her eyes it up) and the staff who was attentive to our orders and requests for cold water. We had an outdoor sitting. The staff who served us also topped up our water without asking.

I told my children I‚Äôve been going to Prive as far back as 10yrs ago as my office was in Depot. We used to go for casual lunch, with our colleagues from overseas offices and for celebrations big and small.

I‚Äôm comfortable with the place, service and food though I hope the portion can be bigger :)

Keep up the good work!"
Happy Hours,"We were surprise that the restaurant only had 1 type of beer for Happy Hours, Heineken. The consolation was the lovely views of the yachts and ships which were docked nearby."
Birthday breakfast,Had a lovely time here with family! Service staff surprised me with a birthday cake and card. And food was fine as always.
Absolutely disappointing,"Food was horrible and service was provided only if you asked for it. Ordered a few dishes, one of which was the laksa. A few minutes after taking the order, the server told me they're out of the usual noodles they use. There was only spaghetti or linguine. Pasta for laksa anyone? I asked to replace it with chicken rice which they forgot to put in. Ended up waiting for 40 min for it to finally arrive after I enquired about it. There was a strand of hair on it.
I decided to look past it. The chicken was tough and cold. Ordered a kids set meal for my daughter. The orange juice only filled half a glass. Yes, it's for a child but the presentation was wanting. I literally thought that was a glass the server had just cleared from another table. Dessets were awful as well and we had to ask for basic things like cutlery and plates. We were really looking forward to the meal but the only thing we got out of it was a nice outdoor view."
Fun evening with friends,"Great place, good food and excellent service. They even presented my friend with a birthday card. Will return again."
Birthday Celebration,"It was a wonderful birthday celebration with the family...Ambience and food was FAB!! The asian menu dishes were heavenly - Hainanes chicken rice, laksa, nasi goreng, spicy arrabbiata penne with fresh prawns & don't even get me started on their desserts!! Each desert had a unique taste to them. My family and myself had a great time. Thank you Priv√© :)"
Dinner at Keppel bay,"Make a reservation via Chope, simple and easy. Went to Prive at Keppel Bay early to enjoy the nice view and breeze. Was given a seat with amazing view, the service was good and food was excellent! Will come again soon!"
Nice place and ambience,"Nice food, repeated visits. Nice playground but it‚Äôs a little difficult to get the staff attention. Recommend to sit outside"
Great family friendly venue,"Great location, food and ambience. Staff were friendly and attentive and we liked the playground area for the kids."
Prive,We reserved a table for a birthday celebration. Food was good and service was excellent. Special thanks to Zul for ensuring our cake was served with finesse. Thank you!
Disappointing food quality,"The quality of the food has really deteriorated. None of the item we order is worth the value of the food. The satay for eg is miserably small in quantity. The parmesan chicken wings is quite mild in taste, nothing worth 3 wings for $14. The fish n chips was disappointing. The fish was dry with thick batter , fries were very small portion n taste ordinary too,

D chocolate milkshake $13 came in a small cup n tasted too sweet.

Overall , only the ambience n staff service attitude were good. Please improve on the quality of your food."
Casual dining,"Tried the Pasta Chili Crayfish, I love the sauce a lot. But for Pizza wise, I find it very hard to eat. The pizza is not hot enough. As for the customer service, the service is very very bad. I will not come back again."
Limited menu for breakfast,"Wish they have an Asian selection. As there are many visitors to the area in the morning for strolling or exercise, it‚Äôs difficult to find good breakfast available at 8am. The location is lovely but no pets allowed sadly."
Good food and lovely ambience/view,Had a great lunch with my family at the Prive Keppel Bay. Staff were accomodating and food was served well. We got a nice view aswell. Thank you.
Waited 50 mins for my food to arrive and it was still wrong,"The service there wasn't as good as the other outlets that I've dined before. Went with a group of friends to celebrate our birthdays. I ordered the lemon and thyme chicken (preparation time indicated on the menu was 20 mins) but I didn't get it after 30 mins. Checked with the kitchen and they told me they burnt the chicken -.- and asked if I would like to order something else. By then my friends were almost done with their food.

So, I got the Ultimate Breakfast set and requested for poached eggs. When I finally got my food another 20 mins later, the egg arrived scrambled and the manager wasn't apologetic at all."
Noisy indoor environment,Guests were already too loud and the worst was the staff cleaning and drying the plates and cutleries right at the dining area. Wished I could enjoy a nice breakfast with the family. Totally ruined the father‚Äôs day celebration
Our dinner experience.,"Was very pleased with the service, every request was attended with a smile. Food was great and great value for money."
Was alright,"First time there. Beautiful scenery, average food, average service, good coffee. Relevant department, is time to purchase new high chairs!"
Nice Ambience but unsatisfactory food,The half chicken is dry. Fettuccini carbonara tasted like chrysanthemum somehow. Patty of beef siders is tasteless.
Excellent food and location - staff could more pleasant,Excellent vegan food options and drinks. Amazing location in lovely part of Singapore with all the yachts. Would be 5/5 if staff were a little bit more pleasant
Wonderful dinner as always,"Visit Prive regularly, it is always nice atmosphere and friendly staff around. Highly recommended. Bring friend for a bday celebration, it is a wonderful evening here at Prive üëç"
Dinner,Food was good. Staff are excellent. Attentive to my 2 kids. Kids had a great time too. Thank you !!!
Romantic dining experience,"The food was tasty and healthy (low in salt) and the steak was tender, the way we like.
There's room for improvement on the cakes though.

The service crew was superb, busy they were and yet they were attentive to us.

Overall the dining experience during sunset by the bay was special and thoroughly memorable, thank you Prive."
Prive Keppel bay,Calling main line took ages for anyone to pick up your call and still no answer to make changes to your reservation. Email response was fast and good.
Vegetarian friendly,"We visited Sunday lunch and had a Happy positive experience. It wasn't very crowded and we requested and were given a bigger table to fit all the dishes. The portions are huge and generous. We ordered salads, pizzas, green curry and burrito wrap (all vegetarian) . They food was good, arrived promptly and so did the drinks. The weather was nice, not too hot to sit outdoors. My elderly parents enjoyed themselves."
"Great location, terrible service","Priv√© at Keppel Bay is going downhill. The staff are rude and incompetent. On our last visit we waited 10 min to be seated and there were a dozen free tables. It took them another 10 min to take our order as they were busy cleaning empty tables. Drinks came tepid as they clearly had been forgotten at the bar and came with our food, which was also barely hot. We had to ask for everything: water, ketchup, kids drinks. Very disappointing experience. The place is always full so management are complacent with training their staff but a little investment in basic manners would not go amiss. Real shame."
"Great atmosphere, excellent service","Even though they looked understaffed and really busy at lunch time (12.30pm), they still served us very well, and very quickly. Atmosphere is great, have been coming often so would keep coming back üëçüèº"
Friends and kids outing,"Our table was right in front of the playground which was awesome. Adults could eat and chat while kids play. Food was ok, but crab cakes were too hard, not recommended. Pizza ought to have choices for less dough. Would recommend for families if u don‚Äôt really mind the taste of the food. But there are many choices so I might not have ordered their specialities"
