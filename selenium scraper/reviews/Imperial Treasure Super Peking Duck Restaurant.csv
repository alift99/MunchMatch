low value service with an exorbitant price tag,"first and last visit. would have adjourned to a different location if it wasn’t for the parents. pre-dining reservation (for table and food) was not exactly easy as more than 1 attempt was needed before the phone call was answered. wait staff was only interested in selling the high end dishes with a super non-chalant attitude. she wasn’t interested in understanding our eating habits and preferences and continued suggesting all orders in ‘L’ size when the 8 of us at the table belonged to the ‘S’ size. She only gave, perhaps, 50% of attention on taking our orders as she couldn’t even get the items right the first time. It was almost like she had a pre-programmed menu in her head and any deviation becomes a challenge. She actually suggested for all dishes to be served all at once, when ordering was completed, which we of course rejected. When the last dish was served she asked if they can serve the noodles and dessert at the same time. Plates were cleared regardless if you’re done with the food on it or if you’re having a conversation with the person next to you. Her uniform actually had tatters that were hard to miss. She was like silently saying “i have a job to do so just get it over and done with; everything else don’t care” Other than the Peking Duck which was executed precisely, almost like a piece of art, none of the other 6 or 7 dishes impressed. One would expect the sea cucumber with minced meat @ $55/piece to have a little more bite but it was stuffed with so much meat (probably to make it look more presentable) the thin sea cucumber was lost. The eefu noodles done with the duck meat was salty, echoed by half at the table. Asparagus witn minced garlic was literally it. At $100/pax for lunch, a little more attention, customer-oriented service and a little more impressable quality food would have made for a happier spending. Neither the service nor the food was worth the $100/pax price tag. It felt like they were only interested in keeping their tables’ turnover kpi. It was our first visit to this restaurant and will be the last. We will gladly take our spending to where we will be more welcomed.
**The saving grace, actually, is the petite aunty in a black-colored uniform. She quietly serves and clear plates with genuine smiles and pleasantries and sweeps up debris without being instructed. She seemed happy to be doing what she’s doing."
Excellent food quality and,"Excellent food quality and taste. Very exquisite Chinese food with fresh ingredients. Had a room to ourselves, thanks to my VIP buddy here. Service without a doubt was one of the best, VIP treatment!"
Excellent Cantonese cuisine,Thoroughly enjoyed a muli course extravanza with friends -- Peking Duck good but not as good as the Shangri La in Colombo
"Great Duck, Authentic Chinese Food","This is restaurant is worth visiting if you are in Singapore and like Peking Duck. The duck is outstanding, and so are some of the other dishes. Service is good as well."
Good Service,Service was very good. They are known for non-veg food so it is not a place for veg people. But my friends who liked Duck enjoyed it a lot here. Liked the Service by them.
Lovely Duck,"Situated in the new Asia Square development in Downtown (there is another of the same name in Orchard Street,) the restaurant seems quite posh and formal: not a place for flip-flops I would say. The most courteous staff showed us to our table where the only complaint, and a common one in Singapore, was that the seating seemed to swallow one (despite a height of about 1.87M.,) so knees were rather too close to chin. I was taught to sit up to table and not slouch. The Peking duck (one has to have the signature dish,) was superb: crispy, non-fatty skin, the pork belly sublime. Throughout the meal the Jasmine tea was kept flowing and a good time was had by all."
2 days Singapore escape,"We’re staying at the mandarin orchard hotel and it’s just the next building to us. I made reservation through the concierge and by 11 am the concierge sent me an email to confirm reservation for 9 pax ( 3) children. Service was excellent. We have a corner round table and English speaking stuff took our order. Opkors we ordered 1 whole Peking duck, prawns in red duck sauce, hot and sour soup, krispy squid, assorted dim sum, salted fish fried rice. All are excellent. A bit pricey but it’s a real CANTONESE Restautant."
Excellent service and delicious dishes,We were thoroughly impressed by the quality of the Peking ducks as well as the other dishes we ordered.The Crispy fried chicken were super nice and the sweet and sour chicken was sublime.The service was very professional and yet friendly.We ordered too many dishes and the staffs realised this and asked if we would like to leave out the final dish.Definitely we will recommend and will revisit.
Braised Crocodile Paw,We happened to be in the area and decided to have our lunch @ the Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck. We ordered 5 dishes and the highlight was the braised crocodile paw. The portion was pretty decent and the dish tasted good as well. Looking forward to our next makan @ Imperial Treasure.
Exellent food,"The must eat - Peking duck and pretty authentic compare to Beijing. Here to celebrate the CNY occasion , ordered claypot cooked abalone, sea cucumber and dried oyster is out of the world. Very well done! The Maine lobster , the shark fin soup are great. Enjoyed the service which is excellent. Get to waive the corkage charges for wine is a plus. Location a bit hard to find for first timer but overall experience is great!"
Over rated,"The meal certainly was over rated. I felt extremely thirsty after the meal. Service needs some improvement as well. For the price, I will visit somewhere else."
Peking Duck - delicious!,"A great meal at decent prices. This won't be your cheapest dinner in Singapore, but it won't break the bank either. I recommend that a reservation is made and pre-order the Peking Duck, which will be carved table-side. We also tried the abalone as an appetizer - very good, if a bit pricey."
Exquisite food at premium price,"My wife and I were hungry and looking for some high quality food for dinner. The deco of the entrance for this restaurant screams posh! We ordered the sweet and sour chicken, fried rice and winter melon soup and the standard is way above the Chinese restaurants of the normal shopping malls, at least a class above if not two. In addition, we ordered the Turtle Jelly and hashima desert and it did not disappoint. However, this meal costed us SGD91 after all services charges factored in, quality comes at a price, a price well paid! =D"
Ducky!!!,"I ate this awhile ago, the duck there is really nice. The price haha maybe once awhile , not every month for sure."
Buddy catch up,"Restaurant is as packed as ever during weekday lunch and friend booked the 1pm slot (iso the 12pm-1pm slot) so that we have more time to chitchat till 2:30pm.
Tim Sum is excellent and a simple pleasure to have with friends. Customer service is good with great hospitality. Service staff are attentive.
Highly recommend for quick bite on a busy day in Shenton Way area..."
Superb Peking duck in business district,"There are several Imperial Treasure restaurants. My colleagues and I went to the Asia tower in the business district. Very well prepard peking duck for the 4 of us. The also prepare a plate with only the upperskin which cracks under teeth, this you wil not get in every restaurant. Also the pancakes and duck are a wonderful combination. Not cheap but tastefull. Not 4 stars due to ever changing staff waiting our table, which seem to be very busy and not so much interested in their guests."
Awesome food and service,"Excellent food with very good service. Amazing duck preparations, lots of choice for veggies. Steamed fish also very good"
Over priced,Make sure you know where you are going. Good meal and service but overpriced. Not the best Peking duck experience
Birthday celebration Dinner,"My Indonesian friend recommended me to visit this restaurant because I love Peking DuckI went last Tue with my nephew and his parents. I brought him there to celebrate his birthday.

Indeed it is really Super Peking Duck . Not only the food is yummy, the service provided by Miss Tracy Ng is excellent❤️ She recommended a cod fish belly dish that was yummy and really value for money. I decided to visit the restaurant again in June to celebrate my birthday. My Nephew also made a reservation to
being his parents, sister, Brother-in-law and nieces on 17/6/18 to celebrate his father’s birthday."
Premium price for Westerners or inflation on duck price?,"The Peking duck is simply exceptional. This was my second visit within a year. What irritated me is the discriminating price policy this place practices. Check the pictures, same dish same place. With my Austrian girlfriend, I paid substantially more and got a lousier service than accompanied by my brother and his Chinese girlfriend."
Best Of Peking Duck,"This is the place if you love Peking duck. It has a few outlets in Singapore. The chef will cut the duck right in front of you. The skin is really crispy. The tahu is so soft and nice to eat. Most of the dish are well arranged and displayed. The staff are courteous and friendly. So far most of the dish we order are recommended, please refer to my photos."
Fabulous Business Lunch,"Booked private room for business lunch. ordered ahead, 10 course meal, fabulous dishes and service. Peking Duck always excellent. Crispy prawns were very good. Steamed fish amazing, highly recommend."
Great Peking Duck,"My wife, 4 yr old and I went to this Imperial Treasure the next night after being at the one in the Paragon on Orchard just to see if the level was the same. We were pleasantly surprised when we ordered the Peking Duck it was just outstanding as was in the other restaurant, the level of service was also of a high level so it doesn't really matter which one you go to they are both great."
The Best Peking Duck,"We loved this place. We had pre ordered the Peking Duck when we made our reservation and was not disappointed. We have tried a number of Peking Duck over the years in Singapore, Hong Kong, China etc and both my wife and I agreed that this was the best we have ever had. We had two ways so the traditional with pancakes etc then served as a San Choi Bau (sorry for spelling) It truly was amazing. Washed down with a couple of ice cold Tigers on tap I could not have asked for more. Staff were friendly and attentive. Highly recommend this place."
Good dim sum,Had a great dim sum meal. Got to keep up high standards. Peking duck is a must to order. Service so so.
Staff attitudes need adjustment,"When you ring up to make a reservation for lunch on a weekday, this restaurant has a strict 2 seating lunch policy and we were told we could only have a reservation for the second seating at 1 pm.

At 1 pm on Thursday 22 March 2018, our party arrived and the assistant manager who was manning the reservations counter told me that the table was not ready and she would call us when it was ready. I then requested for a menu so that we could make our selections while we wait for the table to be ready - she responded that there are NO menus at the reception. I then had to ask for her to please retrieve one when she seats the next table. She rolled her eyes, sighed and ""tsk-ed"" very loudly but she eventually brought us a menu.

At 1:10 pm when I again went to check on the availability of a table and was told in a very unpleasant manner that the patrons were paying the bill and that I would be told when the table was ready.

We were finally seated at 1:15 pm after much eye rolling and unpleasantness - where I actually had to tell the assistant manager that (1) despite my even tone throughout our interactions, she was being very impolite to me and (2) our guests were now waiting for 15 minutes and this was getting to be unprofessional. She responded with the least heartfelt apology one could possibly expect.

The food quality has always been good, but the ridiculous seating policy at this restaurant has been a constant issue, which clearly has taken a toll on the staff that man the reservations counter - but instead of being apologetic for making you wait, they're impatient with you. Incidentally, there were about 15 people waiting in the entrance between 1 - 1:10 pm, testament to the failure of the system.

FYI - We had a table for 8 and unlike other dim sum restaurants, they do not allow for pro rating of orders, so if a serving comes with 3 items, you can't order 8, you can only order 3 sets of 3 (aggregating 9 and leaving you with an extra portion).

Suffice to say, we won't be back unless we find we can't make a reservation in the Marina Bay area at any suitable lunch establishment."
"Delicious,","The food was delicious, very well cooked. The waiter who served me, Ron Cheah, was exemplary, he recommended dishes and took time to explain why they were complementary. Highly recommended"
Superb Peking Duck - Cant wait to return,"Enjoyed this restaurant over the Chinese New Year Period. The service was excellent and every dish ordered good perfectly and tasted great.

Peking duck was a highlight, one of my favourites.

We previously enjoyed the Paragon restaurant location as well, and would happily recommend both."
Just average,"Personal review of this restaurant:

Food: Average
Price: Acceptable
Quality: Average
Service: Could have been better but friendliness good, product knowledge good, service standard average
Ambience: Above Average

Frankly, I expected better. Its like any other Chinese Restaurant, nothing special.

What I would recommend is Peking Duck and that's about it. The staff can assist you with your order if you have no idea what to fill your stomach with.

The restaurant is kind of cramped and while the staff are friendly, the service style is kind of 'not cordinated'.

I'd give this place a miss. Its not a must dine restaurant.

*the only picture available."
"Excellent Beijing ""Peking"" Duck!","A new friend that we met in Indonesia told us that we should try this restaurant for a great Peking Duck dinner. I had wanted to try this dish since hearing it raved about on an Anthony Bourdain episode years ago. Well, my husband and I were not let down. The duck was perfectly crispy on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. The presentation of all of the various dishes that are made from this one dish was amazing. My favorite was the lite ""tortilla"" like bread that you place the thinly sliced slivers of duck in along with scallion and cucumber slices and the dark brown sauce just make it delectable! Mind you this dish is enough to feed easily four adults so, if it's just two of you, you will have leftovers. Oddly enough, even though this restaurant is situated in the Marina Bay Sands hotel complex, there were not many westerners there at all eating. Most of the wait staff speak very little English as the bulk of the patrons are Asian and they know where to find the best Asian foods. If you found this review helpful, please give me a helpful vote. Thank you for reading and ""chiah hok"" (eat well, enjoy good food)."
Business lunch,"The food are great, service of the waiter and waitress are good, the waiting time to be seated is just ok.

Most of guests made reservations but the way the restaurant handle the waiting list could be done with a better and professional way

Overall still a great place with good food to visit"
restricting the number of pieces of lettuce,"Came to this restaurant because it was touted as serving the best peking duck in Singapore. I was not let down. The Peking duck was good. However, the experience was marred when they restricted the number of pieces of lettuce leaves that we could have. There were 4 of us. When the san choy pow (from the leftover duck) came, it was accompanied by 4 pieces of lettuce leaves. when we finished the lettuce leaves, I asked for more lettuce as there were some more minced duck left. We were told we can only have 3 more pieces. I was rather shocked at this. It seems rather petty to be restricting the number of lettuce leaves that I could have. The restaurant categorised itself as fine dining. Surely it should have some confidence in its diners not asking for more than necessary! What was it thinking? That we were going to ask for a whole head of lettuce and bring it home?
Another incident was when it came to desserts, the girl who took our orders simply shouted our orders across the room to her colleague to key in the order! Not the proper behaviour for a fine dining restaurant."
Duck...,"I have been three times now and have very much enjoyed the duck each time I am in Singapore. Tasty, well prepared and expertly served.

The food is very high quality (if unimaginative). The setting is quite nice but a little generic. Go here for the excellent duck - probably appropriate for a business meal than a place I would choose for going out with family."
Amazing Peking duck in downtown Singapore,Be sure to book a table here for either the 11:30 or the 1 pm settings. Get the Peking duck. You will not regret. They wrap individually for you so you don't even have to spend the time pulling the servings together. Who would have thought that in the main financial district in Singapore you can have a real Chinese lunch or dinner and not some expensive tripe that business restaurants offer.
"Average food, concerns with hygiene","Food was average, peking duck wasn't as tasty as those served in other Chinese restaurants like Crystal Jade. What was more worrying was the level of hygiene here, my friend's tea cup had a lipstick stain and when we informed one of the waitresses she laughed and said ""some people put on lipstick which is too red"". It wasn't funny or pleasant to hear about this joke, and no offer to change the cup was made."
"If a duck has to die, at least here it would give lots of pleasure","In my opinion, the ImpTreas Peking ducks are the best in Singapore. A meal at the original location at Paragon is somehow more satisfying, not so much in terms of the food - which is similar in quality- but the décor is warmer and service much more personable."
Delicious tender Peking duck,"The best peking duck we ever tasted. The skin was so crispy. The meat was tender and soft. We had the claypot brinjal which is soft and flavourful. The balance of the Peking duck meat was fried with noodle - we love it!
The prices at this restaurant is quite pricey but if you want good food, then you shouldn't miss out on this restaurant."
Dim sum with good service.,"Came for dim sum rather than Peking Duck. Menu included usual prawn dumpling, siu mai and char siew buns, steamed bean curd rolls, and steamed rice rolls and others, and there was also the baked and deep fried variety. Excellent quality and taste for most of what we ordered. We particularly liked the steamed beancurd rolls, the steam rice rolls, and lotus leaf glutinous rice. The egg tarts has very good filling whilst the pan fried water chestnut ""cake"" was really nice (the latter is not often offered in other dimsum restaurants). The price was not higher than other similar type restaurants.The service was very good. We were there before it got really full, and it was a weekday. We managed to get a table without booking for lunch time, but please book, as we tried to ""walk in"" for dinner once on a weekend, and it was fully booked."
AUthentic and delicious,"As others have stated, the dim-sum and Peking Duck are outstanding. We tried a variety of dishes including carrot cakes, dumplings, and a variety of fish and meat.

It's very busy, but you don't have to wait long to be served."
Very Good Bitter Gourd dish,"The restaurant is very famous for her Peking Duck. It was good but I personally preferred the Peking Duck served by The Peking Restaurant in Hong Kong Star House. The latter is with slightly more fat while Imperial Treasure had hardly any fat on it. The latter is also with slightly more juicy and slightly more tasteful.

However, I liked 2 of their dishes that I had tried this time in Imperial Treasure. Firstly, it was the Bitter Gourd fried with Pork Neck. The taste was excellent and with excellent ' Wok Hei '. The second dish was congee with crispy rice - a modified dish to the old northern China cooking using overnight burnt rice that was dried under sun for days."
Authentic Chinese Food,"My family comes here almost every weekend to avoid the weekday lunch crowd.

Apart from the crispy Peking Duck this is as authentic as you can get in Cantonese cuisine. Quality cooking with good ingredients. Very very light MSG that I can react to. Dim sum choices are limited but they are very well made."
Tasty duck,"Came here for lunch today, having pre-ordered a duck between 3 of us. Service was very efficient and the duck arrived quite quickly. Decent quality without too much fat. Not particularly cheap at $170 all in including a side dish, tea, extra pancakes and cooking up the duck bones. But still one of the better choices for Peking Duck in Singapore."
The duck never disappoints,"Was really amazed at the consistency of the standard of the peking duck. Had it three times and all three tasted amazing, with the necessary crispy skin and tender tasty meat. Can't go wrong recommending this place for business or gatherings."
A little disappointed,"I was here for a business lunch, everything just felt rushed with the food all arriving before you have finished. The food was good but not fantastic, the service was good. If doing a lunch pre-order and get them to slow down. Not sure if I will be back to this one."
Great service and food!,"Had lunch at the restaurant and the food and service was impeccable! The Peking duck is really fantastic, very authentic. Worth visiting."
Outstanding duck - reasonable prices / cold atmosphere,"Really great Dining - one of the best imperial ducks. Atmosphere and Furniture is cold, nothing Special surely not cosy. Staff professional"
Reliable Peking Duck,"We are familiar with Imperial Treasure in Orchard Road. A friend told me about this branch which was close to our hotel. I made a reservation by email before I left for our trip. We ended up eating here twice, for dinner and lunch the following day.

Good Peking Duck. We had a dumpling soup which we thought would be like Xiao Long Bao. It turned out to be a broth with a big dumpling but it was delicious. We had carrot cake with XO. We thought this was a dessert but it was cubes of yumminess, neither tasting strongly of carrot or XO.

On my next trip to Singapore, we will be back."
Warrants the SUPER in its name,"Order the Peking duck in advance, balance it out with a side of honey BBQ pork and you are onto a winner. Enjoyed every bite."
Really excellent choice for business lunch,"I loved coming here for lunches especially sitting at one of the benches. Though it can be a bit cold at times as the air conditioning around the benches area tended to b stronger but it's private, quiet and very nice for business talks.
Service is extremely good if you know the crew onboard. Led by Erica the manager, the staff are knowledgeable, service oriented and very very good with customers especially the regulars.
Food here is great in particular the Peking duck; and dim sum is pretty good too. I love the carrot cake in XO sauce and the Chee Cheong Fun with you tiao and shrimp. I think they serve one of the best here. Also great are the 'fruit fish' and chicken breast covered in grounded ginger and the rice soup with seafood.
I have had dinner here too and each time, me and friends were never disappointed."
Best Peking Duck in Singapore,"One of the best Peking roast duck in Singapore. Nicely done with crispy skin. Minimal fat which makes this a healthy choice. $88 per duck sufficient for 4-5 pax if ordered with other dishes. Although it is not necessary to order a day in advanced, may be a good idea to call ahead if you are entertaining guests. Their wasabi prawns is also recommended. Attentive service staff however the restaurant is usually very crowded weekday lunch time."
Best Peking Duck Ever,"Around the world searching for the best Peking duck (Beijing, Shanghai, New York, San Francisco,Malaysia, Australia) and this is by far the best restaurant I've tasted and named it right ""super "" cos it was what we tasted and enjoyed. We did not 1 day advance order for P.Duck as suggested by the menu.We told receptionist that we really came for the duck and told us to come back after an hour since we did not advance order it. (Or was it that day most Chinese ( about 50,000 people) went to see the festival of the rooster lighting in Chinatown.
Bar up on the front and two private rooms along three table booths (choose the booth if you are 2-4 person) then another open space with groups of tables.
Table settings tidbits, sugar coated walnuts with sesame seeds
Chef brought duck, hot and steaming.He cut 4 small sq pieces of crisp skin for us to dipped into the sugar bowl already on the table.
Then came the breast meat, steaming moist meat with crispy skin done to perfection. that came with the usual scallions /cucumber /hoisen sauce. Hot thin rice pancake rolls in steam basket.
You can order the duck in different ways ( soup, stir fry with veggies or noodles) But we kept out just plain cut up came another round from the whole duck.
Tofu with stir fry veggies is great to order. One Peking duck is too much for two people.
Great service as well and attentive staffs that looked out if we needed anything."
Dinner,"The Restaurant look very good frim outside giving the sensation of a fine Chinese Cusine....
We request e pan fried Cod fish the come e deep fried Cod fish deep in derty oil..
We ask for crab confit and come crab jelly..
Then we decide to go for vegetables but the was more garlic then veges ...we ask for truffle nudles at28$ come a watering dish with no test ecxpet for a water truffle test i could not eat at all..
My worst Dinner and an insult to the table.
Very expansive and not value ...
Service as usual attentative but i just wanted good food and i didnt get..."
"Good food, good service","Great peking duck with crispy skin and meat. I also ordered spinach with 3 eggs and a daily soup (herbal seaweed). The food was tasty. Attentive service staff - Maggie was very helpful and friendly. I came during dinner time on a weekday, so it wasn't crowded."
Above average Cantonese restaurant,"We had good Cantonese food in this restaurant and the service was good. The best thing is that each dish you can order small,medium or large in quantity so its ideal for 2 people wishing to sample more dishes. Unfortunately our entree of stuffed crab shell did not arrive until we have finished our meal. overall its not a bad dining experience."
"Horrible , unfriendly , .....poor quality","Super Peking Duck ...you would at least imagine to have the chance to get it there ,,,,NO ???wrong ...we came there on December 28th ...asking for a table and were told by an rather unfriendly lady that they are fully booked and only could have a table at 13,45 ...we accepted as the restaurant showed its Trip Adviser award winning label and we thought that in that case it MUST be good :...
Coming back at 1.45 pm we were again received by an other unfriendly lady ...it looks that whole service and friendly behavior are not necessary ....

We ordered Peking duck as we came for that dish and were informed that now they were running out of it !!!???

So we ordered dim sums and other stuff ..mainly sweet sour pork ...

Whole food and service were extremely poor and we decided to do the best out of it ....

Staff continued to be very low professional , food average or poor ...prices high ..too expensive ....

Sure that we will not get back there !!!"
Family dinner,It's a great place to eat. Enjoy the ambience. We come here regularly to eat. The Peking duck is very nice.
Food was fantastic,The food portion is alot and the peking duck was great. The service from the staff is fantastic. The price is reasonable.
Excellent Food,"I dine there quite regularly as they offer, in my opinion, some of the best Cantonese dishes in town. Their signature Peking duck, wasabi prawns, salt-baked chicken and three-egg spinach are not to be missed."
Consistent experience,Had an excellent and consistent experience again on the weekend which is usually less crowded. Kudos to Tommy Tan who is always cheerful and helpful with recommendations for new dished!
Oh so fantastic Peking Duck!!,"Okay. To be fair Peking Duck is one of my most favorite dishes. I simply love Peking Duck. With that said, I am also and obviously quite picky with the quality of the duck and subsequently the steamed pancake wrapper. Oh yes, not forgetting the sweet bean sauce too!

Upon arriving at the entrance of the restaurant, you just know you are going to be in a for treat. Or at least you expecting it. After all, it isn't just Peking Duck. They are confident enough, brave enough, daring enough to call themselves SUPER Peking Duck.

And let me say they did not disappoint!

We had ordered quite a few dishes, aside from the Peking Duck. This place also served dim sum for lunch ( I am sorry I don't think serve dim sum for dinner though). The dim sum I will say was otherwise good, as one would expect of the restaurant such as this (Ambience/deco/reputation).

I will add that among all the dim sum I had eaten there, the chicken feet was one of the best ever. The only other place that served such fantastic flavored braised chicken feet dim sum was in one famous restaurant in Ipoh, Malaysia. When I come back here, I will most definitely order this dish again.

Now comes the duck. Like most specialized Peking Duck restaurants, the finished roasted duck will be presented to you for a visual inspection. This is the part where the diners will see if the duck is properly roasted, fat enough and a simple nod of approval will send their service staff to begin slicing the skin and fat of the duck.

The duck is presented in to forms. One with the fatty parts and the other just the skin I think. I ate both. And I can tell you, the sauce, the steamed pancake wrapper was just perfect!

The taste was not too salty but yet full of flavor. Needless the say the sweet sauce and the cucumber was a perfect blend. I think I can safely say I ate my fair share of duck that day. None was left behind, we had to order another duck for that matter!

All in all, I would say this is by far one of the best Peking Duck's I have eaten and that my overall dining experience was Excellent! They do live up to their name: Super Peking Duck!"
Excellent Peking Duck,The name is the game but also tried a lot of other very excellent and chinese authtentic dishes inclduing prok belly but alos some stunning steamed sweet dumplings filled iwth poppy seed and simmered in a ginger broth for dessert!. Great place to discover chinese cuisine and very crowded and loud!
Very good convenient location for CBD,"Traditional duck was well prepared including serving of the 'seconds'. Quick service, once we got seated..."
Traditional style Peking Duck!!,"Great place! I've tried a lot of Peking Duck in my life and this is one of the best outside of Beijing -- surprisingly the best I ever had outside of China was in India, but that's another review. You don't go for the ambience (which is fine) or view, you go for the duck! Give it a go if you like Peking Duck!!"
"Very Good Peking duck, wouldn't rush back though.","The duck skin was well rendered, crispy and the meat delicious. Wrappers were very good and the scallions and cucumber sliced perfectly (nice and thin, I can't stand it when these are cut chunky style). Hoisin tasted a bit to commercial, we prefer one where the restaurant has tweaked it.
We were able to byo wine for $30 corkage, which was a good thing.
The frustrating part of this restaurant was the noisy loud families that have no regard for other diners. Their 2 yr old had the high chair laid out on the floor sideways and was pretending it was a bus and her sibling climbing in and out and shrieking and pushing it around. Parents oblivious and staff couldn't care less. So it wasn't relaxing and it was very distracting. To be fair badly behaved and unsupervised children seemed to be the norm in Singapore restaurants, hotels etc."
Awesome but very pricey,"We patronised the famed Peking Duck restaurant after much persuasion. Other than the awesome duck to savour, the rest of the menu aren't that magnificent for the high price to pay. Staff weren't too attentive either, and didn't bother to tell us they run out of dessert after order was placed."
Best Peking Duck ever,OMG the Peking duck was absolutely to die for. We had the entire duck the first was peking duck and the remainder of the duck was whipped into gorgeous fried rice. A must visit in Singapore if you love duck
Delicious Peking Duck!,We came here on a business dinner treat given by new colleagues. Convenient location in the CBD area. Ordered the Peking duck and was not disappointed. Good ambience and food quality!
Amazing Peking duck in elegant setting,"Visited said establishment last week, pretty much everything was very good - from the decor to the service to thee food. I ordered the Peking duck, family is vegetarian so ordered assorted dim sums & noodles for them. Since I was the only non vegetarian, Peking duck was too much for 1 person but after reading the reviews I ordered it anyway & was not disappointed. Very juicy, flavourful duck not gamey, and excellent crispy skin made this duck the best I have experienced. Family enjoyed their food as well, particularly the mushroom dimsum. This restaurant also has a big menu for vegetarians. Service was attentive inspite it being lunch rush hour.
I will Definately visit again on my next trip to singapore.
Disclaimer: have not eaten the Peking duck in china."
"If you like Peking Duck, eat here","I totally enjoyed my meal here with friends - despite the typical ""Chinese"" service (let's say you have to know what to expect). The food was amazing, the peking duck simply divine and the other dishes all a triumph. You can generally tell the standard of Asian restaurants by the clientele, this was full of Chinese, definitely a good sign!"
Yummy Dim Sum,"Enjoyed the Dim Sum today especially the Salted Egg yolk custard buns and fried carrot cake with XO sauce .

Felt as though we had not enough to of the Salted Egg Custard Bund until we had to 'Ta Bao' （meaning to take away) more of it.. Just Yummy

Worth to try the Hong Kong Dumplings.
Not sure of the name of this exact dish as my friend was the expert in placing the food order.. You got to emphasise it's the Hong Kong Dumpling and you only get it during this Dumpling Festival period..

Found the century egg pork porridge rather diluted . Overall a satisfying lunch today . Thanks to Maggie who took care of our table .
Looking forward to going back again in August for our next Ladies Gathering."
The best Peking duck!,We went for dinner and had the best Peking duck ever! I can only recommend this place to anyone who likes duck and Chinese food! Excellent!
Dim Sum Lunch,"Reservation of table and advance order of peking duck needed to avoid disappointment. Nearest MRT (Downtown Line) will be Downtown Station.

It was a dim sum lunch with 1 peking duck for 4 persons. Restaurant located at the business district, there were many working class there. Nice cosy ambience.

Few trays of dim sum were fresh and tasty. The peking duck was very good too. Everything went well with jasmine tea."
Wonderful Peking Duck,Probably the best Peking Duck I have had in Singapore. Very nice restaurant with good service and very tasty items on the menu---would recommend highly
Lovely and private lunch...,"Met with 2 colleagues from Singapore on a recent trip and they'd booked this restaurant for lunch. My first time.

A wonderful setting - we didn't have a private dining room but they managed to find a very quiet table for 3. We ordered a number of share plates including wonderful dim sum and possibly the best Peking Duck I've ever had. Very efficient service and prompt.

Only reason they didn't score maximum is it took more than 20min to finally get our bill...."
Dazzlingly Delicious Duck,"@TheKuoKnows

All you can do is to call it as you see it. And from the many return visits that I have made to Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck, I consider the restaurant to be somewhere between superb and excellent.

The Peking Duck cannot be faulted. It certainly beats anything that I have sampled anywhere, and particularly in Beijing. Imperial Treasure's duck is moist and not at all greasy, which is the downfall of many a wannabe establishments that purports to serve the iconic duck dish.

Ask for the duck to be chopped after the skin has been removed. When served as a second dish, it helps cut cost and cut wastage, which is never a bad thing.

The restaurant is adept at steaming fish. Soon Hock, which comes in a wide range of sizes, is ideal. The fish can taste better than some of the more expensive exotic varieties on offer.

Steamed vegetables are a must. The Hong Kong Kai Lan stir fried with Ginger Juice makes a refreshing change to the more traditional oyster sauce.

Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck is a vey aptly named. The duck is dazzlingly good. But man cannot live by duck alone. So it is a good job the restaurant is also super at other dishes too."
Disappointing,"My husband and I visited here with our Son who lives in SG and he had recommended the Peking Duck. The duck was delicious and certainly one of the best we have tasted the service unfortunately was disappointing, our wine waiter was really good and the lovely wee lady waitress who attended our table was an absolute delight. However, the surly man with the Mohican style haircut, who I assume was Head Waiter, was downright rude. When we arrived we were given the a la carte menu and a dim sum menu, we had preordered the duck but were going to choose some dim sum to accompany this, the head waiter literally snatched the dim sum menu from us saying ""no dim sum"" and walked away. When we chose a bottle of wine he said, quite bluntly, that it was no longer available we had to ask if there was a suitable alternative and he turned and walked away without a word. The wine waiter came over and quickly and efficiently resolved the issue. During our meal, Mr Rude came over and topped up my Son's wine, topped up mine dripping wine down the side of my glass and onto the tablecloth then sat the bottle on the table completely ignoring my husband's near empty glass. Our visit to Imperial Treasure was a very unpleasant experience all because of this horrible man, I certainly won't be back and would recommend that anyone considering booking a table look elsewhere, there are so many lovely places to eat in SG that this rude service doesn't have to be tolerated."
"Amazing Duck, restaurant understaffed","The Peking Duck is amazing.
Pricey, but worth it. The service is not. Staff can't be blamed as they are running to keep the guests satisfied.
We had the crab in aspic. Tasty, but not worth the money.
The pork belly was delicious and the wines were not that crazy priced.

Nice for a casual dinner with friends and family. But if you have a business dinner or want to impress I'm afraid the service will be problematic."
Amazing,The best peking duck ever and the service is very good. We will definitely be back to try out some other dishes.
"Good BBQ and duck, average dim sum","If you are looking for Peking roasted duck or Hongkong BBQ Char Siew, this is one of the top choices. If you are looking for dim sum, the level here is average or a bit above. Of course, it's not bad, it's good, but not a Wow place.

Reasonably priced, good service and environment, suitable for family gathering. Good."
Best for peking duck,This is one of the best Peking Duck that I have eaten. Better than the famous places in China. The skin is crispy and the duck meat is succulent and juicy. Must try. May be a bit expensive but worth getting fat over it. Must make reservation.
Service lousy,"Had this CNY dinner with my inlaws and family. Took so time to finalise the restaurant to go and finally decided on this. What a mistake.

The manager who took our orders don't really pay attention and floating her eyes around when we place our orders. She keep mentioning ""enough right"" a few times when we order our fifth dishes onwards. It's weird that she is limiting our ordering numbers.

In the end, there were missed ordered dishes. I can see she is paying attention to a table which I think is her regulars. A table which is infested with more than 3 people to served.

So if you guys must go please be a regular before otherwise your money is no good to them"
duck and seafood,"This was the best peking duck we had in Asia. Of course, the atmosphere was a bit upscale due to its location in the Paragon. Everything about the way they do duck will make you scream in joy. The roasted duck skin was perfectly crisp and meat was sweet and juicy. We also devoured their shrimp dish in particular. In East Asia (China, Hong Kong, Singapore) seafood is cooked with much more precision than in Europe, you can't go wrong with it. We look forward to come back soon again."
The Best Duck Ever,"If you're a duck lover and visiting Singapore, you're in for a treat! The best roasted duck ever to tease your palate. The skin is so delicate and roasted to crisp without any trace of fats. The meat is moist, juicy and soft wrap in thin pancake. The rest of the meat can either be fried with rice or noodles.

Make this the centrepiece of your meal and you can have dim sum to give variety. You will not be disappointed.

However, do make reservations as it is fully booked even on weekdays."
Nice Environment and Good Service,"My partner and I was there to celebrate a friend's birthday on the 16th January Evening. The booking was made with 50 people and we were arranged to be in a private room setting.

It was beautifully set up and the service was fantastic. Servers were proactive in topping up our drinks and food service was just so prompt and unobtrusive. I love it.

Although the place was a little cramped, most of us were happy to mingle around.

Food was good but not fantastic, dishes can be a hit or miss. Go with the signatures like Peking Duck, it's a safe choice.

Lastly, we stayed till late, past 11pm, and i am surprised to see that the service was still professional till the time we left. We didn't felt like they were chasing us out even though it is already so late. The place and people is definitely one of the reasons for visiting this place again."
Good duck poorly cut,Very good peking duck but unfortunately (realized too late to ask them to do differently) only 4 pieces of crispy skin served before the most of the remaining part of the duck is cut with skin and meat together - still good but misses whole idea of peking duck with crispy skin...
Best peking duck,"I am a big fan of Peking duck and tried it in many places in Singapore and Beijing, this place has the best peking duck. Service is a hit or miss; often times it has been super fast and other times they just missed an order. Must have the wasabi prawns."
"Great food, great service!","Been twice to their restaurant at paragon and on our second visit, it was really a great one. We were in such a hurry cause some of my family members are rushing to catch flight. The staffs were all very attentive and understood our situation that we need all food to come out fast, including the Peking duck!!..really appreciate their great service and their food is great as always.. Will definitely come again for their Peking duck!:)"
Excellent Peking Duck,"One of our extended family members treated my family to this branch in Paragon for dinner on Thursday night (X'Mas Eve).

We had a lot of dishes. Sharks' fin, fish, shrimps, beef and noodles which were all so well cooked.

We also had their house Signature Dish the Peking Duck, which by far will have to be the best we have tried throughout all the restaurants in Singapore. Its skin so tender and crispy, the oil is just right. Actually when we finished the duck, we wanted another half duck, but were told by the waitress that we could only order one whole duck, and not half. Unfortunately, the restaurant sold out of ducks.

The dessert was good too, not too sweet. Shou tao was being served too, as the next day was gonna be my mom's birthday. It was just made right, not too sweet.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is definitely cosy, and we had to share the room with other people too, and was crowded, but we still managed to hear each other's conversation in the room, so it was good.

My mom commented that likely that our family of 3 will visit this restaurant in the near future, though must order one whole Peking duck. However, one duck after being sliced into pieces, also did not seem a lot, so still worth it."
Great value Peking Duck in Chinese banquet hall setting,"Great value Peking Duck, set in a surprisingly upmarket setting at the top of Paragon Mall. It is definitely set as more upmarket than the prices suggest. I also suggest trying the Suckling Pig. And at only about $24 per shot, throw down a Johnnie Walker Blue as an aperitif."
Delicious,"My friends and I was there for the dimsum. It was very delicious. Service was good. The environment of the restaurant was cosy. In Singapore, it is always advisable to make booking before hand, because the restaurant can be very crowded during busy hours, especially on the weekend."
"Awesome service, great tasting food!","We had dinner at the restaurant on a Thursday night to celebrate a birthday and the entire family was thoroughly impressed with the service and the food quality.

To summarise the pros and cons here below...

Pros:
Awesome service! The lady, I do believe her name is Patricia Chan, who was attending to our table had been the most thoughtful through the evening. Just to name one instance, we probably over ordered for dinner and she was really thoughtful to help us reduce the size of the last dish (noodles fried with the peking duck) without our request and that really helped us avoid an episode of over-eating. Furthermore, when it was time for the birthday cake, the restaurant even prepared the candles for us and lighted them before bringing it to the table while most restaurants would not have offered this special service. Overall the experience has been very pleasant and the food is of top-notch quality as expected.

Cons:
Perhaps due to the fact that it had been a weekday, there were many tables entertaining guests / holding post-work dinner parties. It did get a little rowdy at the table beside us with profanities spewed across the table (though that is totally beyond the control of the restaurant). The echos can get a little loud in the area. In addition, make sure you do make a booking before heading down. While waiting to be seated, we overheard a party of 3 being rejected at the doors simply because the restaurant was fully booked. Do make sure you order your peking duck ahead of time as well so you do not miss the main attraction!"
Imperial Meal,"The name says it all- the duck was an imperial super treasure! Super crispy skin, succulent moist meat, cooked perfectly. Service was wonderful. The fried rice was also really delicious (my nephew's favorite) The best part is still the name though, I mean seriously"
Peking duck to perfection,"Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck Restaurant, Singapore
Famed for roasting the Peking duck to perfection, Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck is a traditional Chinese restaurant run by chef Tong Yuk Sing and his team from Beijing.
The authentic restaurant serves the famous dish in line with centuries-old methods taken from the Emperor’s imperial kitchen, in which each duck is roasted to perfection before being sliced on the platter before diners’ eyes. Good service and great ambiance. It as also a good menu apart from the duck. Well worth a visit"
Excellent Peking Duck -- recommended!,Don't forget to order your Peking Duck in advance! It was in fact as Super as the name of the restaurant boasts.
I wasn't impressed,"I read the huge menu over and over, trying to find any mention of Peking duck, and I failed. When the waitress came to take my order I asked if they did Peking duck, and she said it was a whole duck. I was eating on my own, so I just ordered some roast pork as a starter, and chicken with mushrooms as a main, but neither did much for me. Everyone else around me seemed to be enjoying the Peking duck. What a pity I missed out. I was never given a wine list, so just had a couple of beers."
Best Peking duck ever,"This restaurant specializes in Peking duck - glazed shiny red and succulent. Served traditionally with pancakes and dressings. Some of the whole duck can be re-served as a rice dish but you don't get the other half of your duck, only small dice inside the rice dish. Scallops are S$20 each! Pricey and not soooo delicious. They have a spectacular wine list and chilled wine room. Huge prices. Maybe you'd like a 1999 2nd growth Bordeaux? Dig very deep and you can..."
Very very good lunch,Had lunch at the Paragon branch recently with colleagues. Duck as naturally very good.. and the dim sum quality is awesome. Will definitely return.
"everything is good, duck is especially good","All their dishes are great, but their duck is absolutely amazing. You can't go to this restaurant and not order a whole duck. They bring out the roasted duck and cut it right in front of you. The skin is so crispy, the meat is so tender and flavorful, you almost want to order a whole duck just for yourself. Even the plates have ducks -- very adorable! Besides duck dishes, I highly recommend their tofu, spinach, and mushroom dish -- it's just a beautifully integrated dish with so much flavor and texture, even if you're not a tofu fan, you should still try it and be converted."
Family Dinner,"As the name suggest this place is excellent in making Peking duck. Typically it is meant for 4 people.
The duck skin is very fragrant and tasty. The Chinese thin pancakes perfectly moist and fresh. All the small condiments match the flavors. It is a great meal.
The left over meat would be good in a fried rice.
In the past we could order lettuce wrap or salted duck vegetable soup...but not available anymore.
The dim sum here is also very good."
Lunch,Average place with average food and average services..I would recommend the other outlet at paragon shopping centre.
