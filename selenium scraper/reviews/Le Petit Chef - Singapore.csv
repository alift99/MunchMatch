Unique dining show,"This was an absolute blast! The food was pretty good but what really elevated the experience was the whole projector show and the host with his crew.

It’s on the pricier side but a good experience nevertheless. Would definitely recommend to try out at least once for perhaps a celebration."
Becoming a little elite chef @lepetitchefsingapore,"My luv treats me to an immersive culinary journey with Le Petit Chef on my special day❤️ @ the Grand Hyatt Singapore . I was totally charmed by the smallest chef in the world along with his theatrical performance throughout the experiential dining.

My lu v pampered me with a elite 5 chapter courses with elite leverage wine pairing . I must say the selection of wine pairing was one of the highlight for me .. Great food Great wine Great entertainment and Great company

Special thanks to the host of the day Mr CJ and his team Asif and Mira. They have further elevated the dining experience with their top notch customer service and friendliness. They were fun and yet attentive to all details throughout the evening. Please extend my sincere compliment to CJ and team as they are the right people for your customer service team that lovely evening."
Unique expeirience,"It was a fantastic experience. The experience can be good for you too if you remember 'it is not fine dining, it is fun dining'.

The food was good, not great, and certainly not commensurate with the check later. I knew I was paying for the show and hospitality,

Sometimes felt a bit rushed, especially with 1 4 year old in tow.

Remember to mention special occasions. I did not as I felt that the paid cake was too big for us. But for others, who did not buy the case, a smaller cake was provided nonetheless."
"I felt like a child again, and loved it!","It was entertaining, food awesome and the MC made the occasion an extremely memorable one. We went there for my birthday and got to enjoy an awesome evening"
Another success in Singapore,What a great way to spend an evening! Super food in the most interesting setting ever. Le petit chef is a chain of restaurant with the same amazing theme: Cartoons on your plate and table tells the story of the food you eat. Bot interesting for children and adults. And the food was also great.
Propose to my spouse here,"The dinner at Le Petit Chef was terrific, the animation and the food taste are worth it. As they said, this is not fine dining but fun dining. Been to many such dining experiences, and this is one of the best to date.

The team at Grand Hyatt were very friendly and fun.

On top of it, I emailed the team hosting this event for assistance in proposing to my girlfriend. With their amazing coordination, she said yes and did cry a little cause the whole experience was too romantic for her.

Thank you again Le Petit Chef and the team at Grand Hyatt."
Bravo Le Petit Chef ! Grand Hyatt excellent effort ! Salut !,A delightful fun dinner ! Interactive ! MC Cheng was excellent ! Wonderful service staff ! Also witness a wedding proposal ! Wonderful format !
its really good,"the food was great, especially if you get the elite menu, the ingredients is just * chef's kiss *. The host was very entertaining, engaging the audience with quick stories and cool cosplays. The service was really good, after the end of each chapter food instantly arrives. It was actually fun dining haha, a great first experience i'd say i hadn't seen before. Definitely would recommend especially for first-timers who hasn't been to this show before."
10 Stars for Service but poor quality of food spoilt experience,"Overall verdict:
Go for it if you have kids & would love to experience an interactive unique (& loud/high energy) dining experience. Skip it if you are expecting fine-dining or good food or something romantic.

Details:
The service staff was excellent! CJ was a great host who managed to encourage good participation from the audience. The captain and team on duty were also extremely friendly and attentive. When my children dropped their napkins or cutlery, they were immediately attended to. They were very observant to the needs of the guests. Would have given 10 stars for their efforts! Entire experience was seamless and well executed. It was very interactive.

Had really high expectations for this dining experience and was looking very forward to it. Unfortunately, the experience was not suited for me.

There are altogether 5 chapters - with a story telling segment before food is served. Animations were cute but resolution was poor so it was a strain on the eyes. Storyline / storytelling between chapters were slightly awkward and difficult to make sense. I was over stimulated and couldn't enjoy the meal as the characters continued to move around my plate when food was served.

What totally killed the experience for me was the food. I had read some bad reviews on food quality and had adjusted my expectations before coming. But even with the adjustment - it was hard to give any stars for the food. Almost every dish was too salty or too rich or too bland (in terms of texture). e.g. Chap 1 Tomato was all mushy - could have some nuts or contrasting texture or a bigger chip; Chap 2 scallop was not fresh/ couldn't taste the usual sweetness of scallops; sauce for Chap 3 (Chicken) and Chap 4 (Beef) was too salty/ too similar - I felt sorry for the chicken and beef as the sauce for both overpowered the dish, the beef was very dry and overcooked.

Chap 5 dessert was fun and interactive - you build your own dessert using a ""garden pot"" made up of chocolate.

I was disappointed and will definitely not attend another such session. But I am glad I brought my children along who enjoyed the experience (but they also did not enjoy the food)."
Great Fun and Unique!,"Was among the first to try out the new Le Petit Chef show – How to Be The Worlds Greatest Chef - which just launched on 15 June 2022. I had previously attended the Marco Polo show as well - which apparently closed around 5 June 2022.

Overall - very different show from the previous one – this one has much better graphics, the themes are more developed – for example, we see some history between the great Aztecs and the Spanish invaders, and a run through of great artists like Van Gogh, Andy Warhol etc. I’d say it’s a good show dining experience that everyone should try out!

There is still the entertaining and cheerful host during the meals.

For the food, I had the Elite menu priced at $288++ since it was a special occasion. The main difference between this menu and the other option at $188 is that the Elite is the same as the Master but it also has some great additions – champagne jelly, full lobster (whoah!), truffles, caviar and prawns.

We were full by the start of the 4th course (I’m not known to leave any dessert behind but this time there was quite a bit of yummy chocolate and blueberries left on the plate as it was cleared). Satisfying and fun.

If you are keen to try something very different, entertaining and Instagram worthy, this would be a fun choice for you!"
Awesome experience,"Totally loved the experience ❤️

Blew my mind off with the great interactive fun and of course it was my first experience with my best friend
Travelling in a different form with her

Host CJ made a difference too This is fun!!!
Will definitely come back for a different experience with my guy one day. Love how interactive and spontaneous this is"
Unforgettable Great Journey,"Attention to the Singapore Grand Hyatt management! my wife and I had dinner at Singapore Le Petit Chef yesterday. A Thank You to Serena, CJ, Andrew, Lucas for hosting and the chefs in the behind scene. The dinner wouldn't be completed without the great services! Very heart felt service where CJ constantly checked on everyone at the table. The service crews always asked for the permission to remove the plates. No words can explicit the experiences my wife and I had. And may the management give the service crews a big raise!"
Great Experience!,"The service was amazing, including Eastern, Indian, Himalayas and Chinese themed food with a dessert to finish. The animations kept everyone entertained, the staff were friendly and the host was very inclusive. All in all, in was a thoroughly enjoyable experience."
Dinner at LPC. Hosted by CJ,"A pleasant night with different varieties of food (Indian, Chinese and Middle East). The whole experience is made even better with the host - CJ. Loved his energy and humour."
"Vegans rejoice, you’re not forgotten at Le Petit Chef! (Don’t worry carnivores, you are well looked after too)","Everything about this experience was amazing. I would rate it 10 out of 5 if I could. The customer service of the venue was incredible, following through with our booking and going out of our way to make sure we could visit during our stay in Singapore.
CJ, the host was just so full of energy and really brought the Le Petit experience to life - it really was fun dining and not just fine dining with his assistance. Andrew did a great job with the wine service and Helen concocted such delicious creations!
I had the vegan degustación with the wine pairing and it was perfection. I could not fault a thing. The vegan butter chicken was the best curry I have ever tasted in my life.
Just make sure you go with a big appetite because you will be extremely full at the end of this incredible experience! I"
What a night,"I didnt expect much. Just a great meal with Animation....what it was in the end was a night of Jjoy, laughter, wit, excellent Service, funny Animation from Le Petit Chef and the perfect Execution of each course. Thanks for this outstanding experience. Anytime again."
Eat and have fun,"This is a new trend for restaurant i guess, we eat and there is a show with lighting, video and service at the same time, it tells a journey of a petit chef, very fun!"
Had a great family time!!!!! Thank you CJ,Was a great fun show. Went with my wife and 4 year old son. CJ was a great fun host. Was a very filling meal
Overwhelming visual dining experience,"Five stars for the unique dining experience as the 6 course meal follow a well thought out and presented storyline.

Food taste wise is mostly average in terms of execution even though they are all very well presented visually. Some interesting combinations of food ingredients that surprise you and is to its theme.

What makes this dining experience is really in the “immersive dining experience” as its website says - sensory overload, visually captivating, participative/interactive kind of dining experience.

The host hyped up the diners, presented the storyline smoothly, and engaged diners with witty and charming presentation.

Two hours flew pass quickly and we all left with very full bellies.

However, you are paying a very premium rate for the Marco Polo Expedition menu $288++ as compared to the Marco Polo Journey (Standard) menu $188++. I would recommend to pay for the experience but not the premium for better ingredients in some of the courses as the money can be spent on better cooking elsewhere."
Amazing experience with terrible food,"Amazing experience with a fun host! Btw we say santé in French not salud (that’s Spanish) but the food was a complete disappointment. The tabouleh was tasteless and it was the worst falafel I ever tried, it was so dry. The best part of the meal was the cleanser lemon sorbet with Chili oil.
Le petit chef digital experience was wonderful but he needs to learn to cook through his travels- not worth the $$$"
Other-wordly!,"A night worth remembering. It’s not very often that you’ll have the kind of dining experience that you do with Le Petit Chef. Even just entering the room felt other-worldly. Our favourite part of the night were definitely the personable interactions we had with our host CJ and his team - Samsuri, Sri and Jin Hong. CJ was engaging, charismatic and really entertaining!
They were not only warm, but the service rendered were top notched - They even remembered our names!

We did not have high expectations for the food after reading reviews. However, we were pleasantly surprised! All 6 dishes throughout the course were well thought out and well executed. Each dish was tasty and generously portioned. Our favourite being the starter, the butter chicken and the himalaya. Grand Hyatt’s food chains have never once disappointed us which is quite telling! They catered especially to our dietary needs as well, which was a nice touch. I’d say come on an empty stomach as the portions can be quite substantial for small eaters like ourselves.

To the staffs that served us that night, thank you so much for the memorable night. We’d love to be back again, this time on empty stomachs! :)"
Good Food & Excellent Service,"Had dinner yesterday at Le Petit Chef Grand Hyatt SG. Good experience. Food is good, portion is enough, i fact, we were so full that we could not finish some of them. Kudos to Alfi, Sri and Ethan for the impeccable service. Although it is a little pricey, I think the money is well-spent. I love the food, especially the butter chicken. I would recommend it to friends. Go and try it if price is not an issue!"
Dinner at Le Petit Chef,"Our host CJ was extremely entertaining and presented the story during the dinner so well with his introductions and toasts. The animation and the explanation for the origin of each dish made the meal much more special and each course was a delight for my family and I. The staff was also very sincere and attentive to the diners' needs during the meal, and provided excellent service through the night. We had a wonderful experience with Le Petit Chef, and hope to see more similar menus in the future.

We were having the vegan course for dinner, and one comment would be that the portion for the India and China courses were a tad large for guests to consume after having had several courses before. My suggestion would be to reduce the portion of papadum for the India course, and having a smaller serving of glutinous rice (brown rice, yam, mushroom on lotus leaf).

We would like to sincerely thank the staff at Le Petit Chef for an excellent dinner and being wonderful hosts, and would recommend it to those interested in participating in an interactive and delicious meal."
One of the most delightful dining experiences for the family,"I booked a table for my family of 3 and we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly! The food and service was excellent and reasonable for the price.

CJ, our host was hilarious without hamming it up to much and being in-your-face, which honestly, can be irritating. CJ was fun and encourages everyone to participate and have fun a good time. he checks in with us to make sure everything is going well and he comes across as sincere and highly likable.

We enjoyed almost all courses of the meal, well, except for the desert, which was a saffron and cardamom rice pudding that came with a layer of caramelized sugar, similar to a creme brulee. I'm personally not a fan of rice pudding so that was my only minor issue there.

To wrap up, they brought out a small birthday cake for my wife, which was a really nice touch to round off a great meal and experience.

I'd highly recommend anyone to give this a try!"
The food is not worth the money,"The food is not worth the money, quality is bad and cold...even the sweets like chocolate and creme brulee...the animation is quite cute but you can watch it online for free."
An overall novel dinner experience.,"An overall novel dinner experience. My family and kids enjoyed the journey (having read Around the World in 80 days helped). CJ, Sri and team also did well to enhance the ‘live’ interactions. The ambience within the private dining area/cellar was also a treat. Recommended."
Not worth,The food is not nice. Hawker food nicer. This is only a cook. Not a chef. Price is too much for this kind of food and show
Extraordinary experiences come in small packages,Le Petit Chef was amazing! Definitely a once in a lifetime experience. Service and food were great and host Iggie really took us on a culinary adventure. He was amazing. My little girl was thrilled
Exceptional!,My family loves it! Iggie was really entertaining and staff service excellent! Thanks the chef for the yummy food too. Looking forward to the next voyage 😀
It was a great night for myself,"It was a great night for myself and family. My children were thrilled and entertained entirely. We didn’t expect the food to be great but it was. Host CJ was wonderful from the start till end of the session. He was funny and humorous, we all had lots of fun! It would have been better if wine can be served but surely it isn’t for good reasons. Looking forward to experience another theme in near future. Highly recommend to families with kids 5yr above."
Refreshing Dining Experience and Awesome Host!,"Interesting concept that weaves 3D animation with finely crafted cuisine, making the dining experience feels like an adventure. Have to compliment on the Host we had for the evening, Iggie, who made the whole experience ALOT more fun and interactive! Food wise, in all honesty, is only average."
Great experience. Kids love it!,It was a great experience. Host CJ definitely made things more interesting. Kids enjoy it a lot. And the staffs and Cj are very attentive. Their service is perfect! The only thing is I feel the whole dinner we r rushing to finish up the food. Will be good if the time given is longer
Wonderful birthday experience,"My wife booked le petite chef as a surprise for my birthday. We went with our 3 little children and it was a fantastic experience. The 3D entertainment and host were excellent, as was the drinks and waiter service, and certainly entertained all of us (my daughter wants to go back!).

We had the vegan menu and it was absolutely delicious, especially the butter chicken.

I would highly recommend the experience and the food."
Le Petite chef,"Terrible experience. Over rated. We paid a total of $750 for 3 adults and a child. The video experience is good but the food was horrible. The worst I had ever tasted in Grand Hyatt. All in, I would never recommend even with the video experience. They should get a decent chef to command such price point. Total let down."
Le Petit Chef - Singapore,My wife and I enjoyed this immensely. The experience was lovely and we were lucky that the other diners were a good time too. Iggie and his staff were awesome and treated us well. Keep up the good work Iggie.
Wonderful service and fun,"My husband and I enjoyed this immensely. The experience was lovely and we were lucky that the other diners were a good time too. Iggie and his staff were awesome and treated us well.

My only quibble is the food. We had the vegan package and the food was not that great (for the reputation of the hotel). I would call the food mid-range but also heavy. It didn't detract from the fun that we had and the nice experience but can't help but feel that nothing on the menu was super exciting or a star dish.

But we had a good time nonetheless.
:-)"
Le Petit Chef Singapore - Amazing Experience,"I learn about Le Petit Chef in Instragram and it was before it came to Singapore. I was hoping that I could make the trip to London/Paris to experience it. Then Covid19 happened and we got stuck here in this island. Lo and behold, I didn't realised that LPC was already here. So once CB was lifted, I booked a slot for me and my husband to celebrate our anniversary and it was such an amazing experience. The food was good. Grand Hyatt's team of chef intertwined their menu with the setting and story with such joy and creativity. Love it. Can't wait to experience the next story, dahlings!"
What a show!,Everything was just perfect that night! Iggie did an amazing job from start to finish along with the services of the crew that night. Thank you for making this experience memorable!
Magical experience,"Wonderful, entertaining, great service and presentation. Food was good, could be customized further for children. Overall, loved the interactive aspects and visuals."
Immersive Experience,"The use of multimedia to enhance the dining experience was novel and interesting.The content/dialogue was skewed towards younger diners but i can understand as its meant to cater to as large an audience as possible. However if I was to come back at another occasion, i would want it to be a bit more sophisticated; given what I have already experienced. Food quantity was a bit too much and i would have preferred to have higher quality ingredients given the price. All in all it was something unique and a good experience."
An absolute delight!,"Lunch was in a very intimate setting in the restaurant's wine cellar. Due to Safe Management Measures, there were only 10 diners, including my husband and I. A very cozy size.

The host, Iggie, was very entertaining! The 3 service gentlemen were very attentive, filling our glasses up ever so often.

The theatrics was amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed watching LPC's whole ""journey"" through the different countries and tasting the flavours of the world at the same time.

The portions were small but don't judge the food by its size. I was bursting by the time we got to dessert. I could not finish it!

One suggestion I have is perhaps to include the smells of the world too. That would be a very immersive experience.

In all, I'd strongly recommend this experience to everyone!"
A fun filled night,It’s a fun filled 2 hours dining experience in Grand Hyatt Singapore. Every dishes are delicious cuisine from around the world. The host Iggie engaged his guests with his humorous wit. Highly recommended.
Amazing lunch journey,"It was a very interesting and unique experience. The dishes were delicious, especially the Himalaya dish. Will definitely do it again if there’s a new menu."
Awesome Experience!,It was a good and memorable experience we had as we “tour” around the different parts of the world and tasted the different cuisines. My eldest daughter and I had fun and would highly recommend this for those who wants to try out something different especially during this trying times due to travel restrictions imposed globally.
The 5 stars are for Iggie,"The 5 stars are for Iggie and the service staff, they made it a super enjoyable, fun filled, memorable experience! Whoever designed the menu/food should be shot, it’s an abomination."
Disappointing food,"My family and I enjoyed the theatrical experience and entertaining host, Iggy. However, food was utterly disappointing for the price we paid. Most were served cold, and knowing Hyatt's standards on food, they could have done way better. A few dishes tasted very strange, especially rice in creme brulee. With the bad variety of cuisine we had, we were borderline to term it a gimmicky experience."
Fabulous dining experience,"We enjoyed Le Petit Chef Singapore for the lunch session as a birthday celebration at the Grand Hyatt. Overall we thought the whole experience was really well executed.

We arrived at 12.05 for the 12.30 start as they ask you to do so on the confirmation as well as text message reminder, I can appreciate this and followed the request, we were surprised other diners came late and missed the first part, This is a show so do be respectful for other diners/staff and come earlier.

Iggy the host was fabulous, he was engaging, passionate and attentive, I can imagine this is a tough job to be on like this all the time so hats off to him as he really did an incredible job.

The animation and the story telling weaved into dining was creative, I did not have high expectations for the food to be honest, however I was most impressed. The presentation and the thought process to create this culinary journey was certainly appreciated.

This is not a cheap dining experience, however it really is like going to a show so it cannot be compared to just another restaurant, it is the whole experience.

Well done to all the team, we really enjoyed it and would certainly recommend."
Food can be better,"The experience was good - but for that price paid the quality of the food can be better. And be Early (not just On Time, but be Early) because we were literally standing outside the room at 1230hrs & they’d started the session."
Over-rated Dinner,The 3D effect of the animation is over-rated. The food is average and it is not worth for the price we have paid for. Luckily the host is good and he 'save' the session. He is funny and knows how to create the atmosphere for the diner.
Really nice experience for my birthday,"Dinner experiences in the past usually were lacking either really good food or the experience was dull. Le Petit Chef actually made good on their advertised promises. As I have a background in events and show I was hoping but good food with some okay-ish entertainment on my birthday the whole experience was great: really good food, a well chosen wine tasting menu and a really enjoyable AV experience. To make the whole thing really good was the lovely host/actor. The only down side is that they forgot we had a wine tasting so when I mentioned this after the first course we had to step up the drinking pace as we got 2 glasses with the second course. And the wine glasses are filled up as we do at home but I hardly ever get those amounts in bars and restaurants. I absolutely recommend Le Petit Chef and our host!"
"Excellent experience, great food and great staff!!","We really enjoy our experience. The staff was really friendly, the atmosphere was perfect and the food really good. We recommend it to anyone!!!"
Superb,Food was great and the host CJ was excellent! Entertainment value was awesome! Defiantly worth the money.
Reimaging dining experience,"Truly an eye opening experience. The food is great, the theatric is awesome. definitely worth every penny."
Awesome Experience!,The cocktail session was great for a good catchup time prior to dinner. The dining experience was one of a kind and the birthday celebration went well for my friend.
Happy family time,It was entertaining and the food was pretty good as well. Great host and nice venue. All in all it's a guaranteed happy family time
Was not able to enjoy the food and entertainment,"Food and service was great but it was VERY RUSHED. I had wine pairing with my meal and I had to literally shovel the food down and bottoms up my wine as they are very strict with the timing of each course serving. Wouldn't recommend. Spent more than a thousand SGD, would ask for a refund if I could."
In the footsteps of Marco Polo,"A fantastic experience for both children and adults! Our girls loved it! A variety of food from different corners of the world - well, you really travel here! Definitely worth trying!"
"Entertaining, Great Service and Great Hosting, Exotic Food","The host was very entertaining, made us all feel welcome and had a lot of initiative to freely render his help & support"
Special Place for All Occasions,"Had an amazeball time at #LePetitChefXGHS with my perfect partner-in-crime. Much needed mid-week break from #WFH and it was truly a treat for our sensory, sound, visual and taste. Iggie was truly a delightful host, as we embarked on the Marco Polo journey on the Silk Road with the talented Le Petit Chef! Bon Appetit!"
Best way to celebrate a birthday!,"Not being able to travel overseas freely, this is indeed an excellent way to enjoy new experiences. This is my first time at Le Petit Chef as I did not like the menus previously offered but the menu this time round revolving Marco Polo journey is exactly what my palate is craving for! I was more excited about the special effect treat but even the food, the wine, the presentation, the attention to details all far exceeded my expectations! Emcee Iggie was also super entertaining and really further enhanced the entire experience for us. fee-saha-tec?!?! The birthday celebrant also received a special cake and birthday song sung by the service crew. We really had a wonderful time. Thank you so much!!"
Fun Dining at its best with host Iggie,"Had a wondrous FUN dining at Le Petit Chef, Grand Hyatt Singapore this afternoon. Visually appealing and entertaining, highly recommended, the kids enjoyed it thoroughly. Thank you LPC team Iggie, Sunny and Kevin. #LePetitChefxGHS"
Great dining experience,"I brought my family to enjoy the dining experience fro Le Petit Chef, it was mind blowing. Iggy was our tour guide bringing us around from Paris..Middle East.. India..Himalayan..lastly China. The food prepared by Chef Koh was delicious and we were served by Dienes. Everything was perfect! I will definitely visit again if there is another adventure with Le Petit Chef."
Le Petit Chef Experience,"My partner and myself celebrated our anniversary at Le Petit Chef. Iggie was our host for the night. It was a truly wonderful experience. Engaging entertainment, excellent service with amazing attention to detail while still affording guests their own personal space. In my partner's words - the best dinner experience in Singapore ever had! Thank you Iggie and team for making this day so special for us."
Awesome Show,I love the way the whole presentation of the dining experience. How Iggy makes us feel that we are part of the whole show. and the whole experience was very personal even though there is a group of us. Good job! keep it going! I love it
Good experience,It was a good graphic and dining experience. My daughter really enjoyed the journey with the little Chef.
Very interesting and captivating dinner,"3D technology, theme music and story telling level up the whole dining experience. Very different from the usual fine dining restaurant. The service was excellent too. If only they can improve on the food, it will be perfect.."
Great Dining Experience,"From the setting, ambience, staffs all the way to the food and beverage served was excellent. Safety distancing was also well considered."
Awesome experience,What a great way to engage a three years old for 2 hours! We enjoyed the entire experience. The relaxed ambience of the restaurant was very pleasant. Totally recommend!
Excellent experience from food to drinks and the host,"A wonderful memorable experience based on food from different countries on The Silk Road. We enjoyed the delicious food and beautiful presentation, using dishware typical pf each country. The wine matching was excellent. Set in The Hyatt's wine cellar, Le Cave, which creates lovely ambience. Two children were enjoying lunch as part of two different groups and they had a children's menu. The host, Iggie, was fabulous fun and changed his attire to clothing from the country of each course. An interactive fun experience. Thoroughly recommend."
Magical,Incredible dining experience!! Quality of Food was ok but dining experience was very different from the usual fine dining. The visual production from Le Petite brings a wonderful 3D mapping performance over the dining table which is magical.
Entertaining Dinner,"Nice performance, friendly staff, but average food. Good event to attend since travel is still not possible!"
Great entertainment but overall too pricey.,The kids absolutely loved the animation and the service was excellent. We really enjoyed ourselves but the cost is too prohibitive for us to recommend to others.
Entertaining & Fun,"Great experience, cool visuals and entertaining host. Ambiance was lovely, the wife and I enjoyed it very much"
A Great Evening!,"A great entertaining evening with yummy food and superb service! The ambience was great and the ""travel"" was creatively done with our super guide Iggie! Highly recommended to go through this experience!"
Great Fun for entire family,host Iggie was amazing and made the experience such a memorable one. Friendly and knowledgeable. Staff were friendly and professional :) Thank you to kevin and sammy. Was my birthday and got complimentary cake. 10/10 experience
Amazing experience!,went there to celebrate my son's 10th birthday. It was an amazing experience! My son enjoyed all the cuisine and was totally immersed in the show. Host Iggie was very entertaining and brought lots of laughter for all. Would definitely recommend my friends to try Le Petit Chef :)
Amazing experience Dining,"It was an amazing dining experience.
We had a fantastic dining experince surrounded by 1.3Million dollars very best wines and champagnes.
Special thanks to :
Our Private Host - Iggie
Our Private Chef - Kristi
Our Private Buttler - Gary
We have the whole place for us.
Highly recommend"
Great experience but....,The missus (was her birthday) and I forgot to take a photo with the Le Petit Chef wall feature as backdrop :(
Worth a try,I think is a nice dining place for couple. Im sure your partner will enjoy the dining experience. The environment is nice.
Awesome Experience,Great Food. Great Services. Great Plating. Great Theme. Great Ambience. Great Crowd. Great Location. Couldn't think of anything bad to comment. I hope there will be new theme coming soon!!
Quitr disappointing,The whole process wasn’t that captivating. Food was so so. Proceed was rushed as there are other seatings.
Fantastic service and presentation of local cuisine,The best animated presentation of a gastronomic journey for Asian Cuisine! its really a good experience and the service crew are simply awesome!
Too much rushed theatrics and not enough focus on food,"It's a novel experience, just for the experience. Food is average and you're not given time to savour each dish before the next one is rushed in so that the number of seatings can be maximized over an evening. Overall, do it for novelty once if you're keen but I would not recommend it if your intention is culinary focused."
Experience at Le Petit Chef,"The service was excellent, food was up to expectations. However the whole experience could be better, didn't feel that it was interactive enough and quite different from what I see online."
"Nice visual, ok food","Good experience as a whole, since I have never tried this. But food is just ok, and they charged an extra 2% for foreign transaction or something , Becos the parent company is in Malaysia although I paid in sgd, dine in Singapore and paid thru a Singapore hotel. Rated 3 as the extra fee was not visible at booking and only reflected in the credit card statement"
Exceptional Experience,"We love every single thing about the whole experience- the food, presentation, host, servings, settings etc, everything was done to perfection! It's like going through a wonderful culinary travel that invokes our 5 senses without having to leave our seats. May sound pricey at first but it's well worth it, a special memory for lifetime indeed!"
Great show average food,"One of a kind dining experience with mesmerising projections onto the dinner table. The show projected was entertaining and done with precision. Host was great and engaging. The number of tables weren’t too many so it felt private and exclusive.

The only downside was the food - it was average and nothing really special. Presentation was good though."
AMBIANCE! EXPERIENTIAL! Food soso,"The overall ambiance and experience is definitely once in a lifetime. It is interactive and upscale in the fashion they deliver each dish with a theme, short video, and according props for visual effects.

The host was superb, friendly, and absolutely accommodating. I'd definitely recommend at least going once if you have the opportunity, but due to price and '1 time & done' type of experience I would only go once."
Best Dining Staff and Butter Chicken,"It was a great experience. Food and pairing aside, the 3D story-telling and staff theatrics added an entirely different dimension. The host was very engaging and his humor was spot on. The course intros, backstory, and cultural trivia were good additions. Food and wine pairing was top notch, my favourite was the butter chicken course. Given the number of courses and pairings I think the duration could have been longer. Will definitely recommend to friends or try their new menu if they come again to SG."
"Great show, but unfortunately very so-so food","Having seen the Petit Chef on YouTube before, it was intriguing to actually secure a dinner reservation. The show is fairly similar to what I'd seen on YT. Very impressive production. So special.

But what let it down was the food at the Hyatt restaurant. Nothing much to speak about and I can't remember even 1 dish that was impressive enough to catch my interest. For e.g., for the Indian ""course"", I would prefer to go to Little India to ear.

Perhaps the Petit Chef needs to choose another restaurant to do this at. One with a higher level to food offered, more intriguing and more delicious."
World class experience but not world class food,"The media experience is amazing and worth going for that alone. I found the food too rich and was ill immediately after. It didn't help that I am not a seafood eater and the restaurant pretty well ignored my request convincing me that just because it comes out of the sea, it doesn't mean it's seafood. Peer pressure forced me to eat it but I would have been infinitely happier just eating bread and lettuce, paying the same and just enjoying the overall experience. The non seafood was OK but if you are interested in food, then you should go to restaurants that focus on this and not audio visual."
Experience with Le Petit Chef,"My husband and I enjoyed throughout the journey. An amazing experience, the ambience and food were great!"
Lots of fun!,"I think the marriage of tech media, live story-telling and food really came together wonderfully here, and if you haven't experienced this before, you should do this at least once. It wasn't cheap, but you can really lower the cost of the dinner if you pick the wine-free options, which did not in any way impair the quality of the experience. Highly recommended! Bring your teenage kids for a family outing or go with friends, or have a nice fun outing with your date."
amazing experience,"This was a birthday treat for my better half. We also took three children (5/11/16) and our helper. It was perfect for everyone. Entertaining. Educational. Fun. Delicious. Friendly and cosy.
The food was as varied as Marco Polo's journey, which was parodied in an audio-visual way that involved everyone in the journey. Each dish was first rate in presentation and taste. The choice of beverages was as good as anyone might expect. It was hosted in the hotel's wine cellar after all. Access for wheelchairs would be possible but not so easy. We felt it was good value for money."
Nice experience but average food,"We wanted the experience and that was really nice. The hosts were very friendly and attentive - excellent experience from that angle. However, the food was not up to par for an event like that. We are still happy we attended, but for us to do that again, we need the food to be part of the excellent experience."
A unique dining experience,"It’s not just about the food, the drinks or the venue - it’s the entire unique experience that’s worth trying at least once. Very interesting being immersed in the digital show, participating as an element of it, watching the Le Petit Chef story unfold through each course, complemented with engaging digital effects and equally gorgeous serving plates that match each theme. Ambience 7/10; Food 8/10; Host: 9/10; Experience 9/10; Bragging Rights: 10/10"
Lovely experience,"I was fortunate that I had a conference in Singapore at the time Le Petit Chef was also on going. We had a fun and extraordinary experience. The food, the ambiance and the concept was just great. Lovely, lovely experience"

An unforgettable experience,"My kids and I were awed by the journey taken through the different countries and this experience was enhanced by the narrator who had a sense of humor and was warm and welcoming to all of us. The service, was, without question, exceptional and the food was amazing while tantalizing our palette."
Great experience with entertainment.,Had a really enjoyable time dining with Le Petite Chef. It was really entertaining as there was a host throughout the whole dining duration and it really brought us to different part of the “world”.
