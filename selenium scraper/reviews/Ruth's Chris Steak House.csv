Simply The Best,"In Singapore for the F1 and there was a grill in the Hotel we were staying in . The Park Royal Collection Marina Bay and I decided to book a table for four.. To say we were impressed was not the word, the steaks were the best I have ever had,and I have been around . We were from Australia and although the price was up there the produce was to die for..
The service was fantastic, the whole experience was one I won't forget .The best ,like they advertised!! steak I have had in my lifetime and would not hesitate to recommend...

Raw and burned steak. Unprofessional service.,"I had high expectations when placing a booking at this steakhouse. I ordered a porterhouse for two, requesting for a medium rare. What arrived is a burnt steak on the outside and rare meat on the inside.

The manager had the cheek to tell us that the steak is medium rare. Please review the attached pictures for a laugh.

The manager then proposed to recook the steak, and claimed that it was normal for his restaurant to cook their steaks a bit rawer, as they cooked steaks based on colour. Perhaps they had x ray vision to see the colour of the steaks, but anyway, their x ray vision was rather suspect based on how they cooked their steaks. With their price tags, I would expect their chefs to use a food thermometer if they cannot judge the doneness of their steaks via appearance.

Will not recommend"
My first visit to Ruth’s Chris steakhouse,Was greeted by Ezan at the front desk and directed to our table. The location of the restaurant is not the best but I must say the service is one of its best! The quality of food and service is enough to keep you occupied. Was served by David and he’s someone who will make you feel at home! He ensures that you are satisfied with the food and drinks. Check in with you occasionally to ensure you are self suffice. Loved the beefy…..yummy in my tummy and was amazed by the dessert portion! Incredibly big and it’s enough to serve a portion of 4. Kudos to the amazing team!
Birthday Celebration Family Lunch,"Wonderful family lunch with great food and friendly service. Ribeye, petite filet and tuna steak which we ordered were excellent."
Very good but very expensive.,"Excellent steak however very expensive (coming from Australia) that I don't think any steak could be worth that price. Having eaten there will probably not spend that money on a steak again. However it was very nice, service excellent and staff friendly of course."
Great steak and lamb!,We ordered porterhouse steak and lamb. The food's great and service is good also. The wine that the waiter suggested wasn't good though and we paid 200$ for the so so pinot noir wine!
Great service,"Had a delicious lunch here when we arrived. Great steak, spinach salad and scallops. Scallops were perfectly done."
Very expensive steak,"I had never heard of this chain, but having been poorly organised for dinner, we had little choice but to eat here whilst staying at the Parkroyal Marina.

The staff are friendly and the service is good. We opted for chicken breast, ribeye steak and some sides, with tap water to drink. The steak was nice enough, but certainly nowhere near the quality that I have had elsewhere. The chicken likewise was nice enough, but with the bill being near on £150, without having alcohol, the value for money is simply not justifiable. If prices of this chain are similar elsewhere, I would definitely not visit again myself, nor recommend it to anyone else unless you had more money than sense."
Unhappy dining !!,We booked dinner for 7:30 pm for a birthday celebration with friends. We ordered our food at approximately 8:00 pm after initials drinks etc . We were flabbergasted to be told by our waiter during the main course that the kitchen was closing at 9:30 pm. This was a shock as we did not have time to even consider or order dessert !!! Extremely disappointed in the lack of notification when we initially made booking or informed upon arrival. Then to add injury to insult the reason given was that a corporate customer was dictating service for that night and hence affecting all patrons dining !!! Very unprofessional and will not recommend to anyone if seeking good service ! Very expensive lesson learned!
Poor steaks quality and slow service,Very disappointed from the service - we waited 1:30 hour just to get the first course. Food quality was bad and below expectations
Subpar steak. Poor service. Overpriced.,"Ordered 2 steak at medium and medium rare, but the medium came as medium rare, whereas the medium rare came as rare. When we informed the manager, he sent the steak back to the kitchen and got us replacement. BUT, the supposedly medium came as well done and the exterior was very charred. As we didn't want to wait further, we accepted it. There was no apology.

In addition, the quality of the steak was way below average. Even their ribeye was tough and not flavourful. Other side dishes were normal too, nothing great at all. Definitely not worth the high price tag. We didn't finish both steak - more than half of each were left. But neither did the staff nor the manager bother to find out why. They simply cleared the table and left.

We paid more than S$350 (2pax) for such a horrible fine dining meal. There are so many other steakhouses in Singapore that taste much better than this and provide great services. Certainly the most terrible experience we had in a steakhouse. It is that bad that I am willing to spend time to leave a negative review. Avoid at all costs!"
Amazing time,We had an amazing birthday dinner over there! I had Petite fillet it was just amazing 🤩 service was superb. They even give us a pic of us printed out as my bf present.
Ruth’s Chris in Singapore,"If you want a good steak anywhere in the world, find Ruth’s Chris. The one at Singapore did not disappoint, nor did it surprise. It served warm bread with a generous dollop of butter for the table, a decent lunch-sized filet minon done right for the main course and an excellent side order of sautéed asparagus, with a glass of Pinot Noir. For those who didn’t wish to eat beef, we had also ordered a chicken with a side order of cream spinach. The vegan amongst us had portobello mushrooms and a salad. The meal was ended with a cappuccino.
As stakes go, while it was good, it wasn’t the best I’ve had at Ruth’s Chris. I preferred the one I ate at their New York restaurant. But, it was a delightful experience."
Time for Celebration,"Call for celebration, where else but Ruth’s Chris Steak House.

Lovely ambience, Ribeye Steak and Lamp Chops. Perfectly grill, succulent and flavorful. The asparagus with Hollandaise sauce was authentic, the Creamy Spinach was to my taste.

Lovely wine pairing as recommended by Ezan Ishak, the restaurant manager was spot on. Excellent service. In fact we were well pamper ed by him and his team.

Oh, the Blue Crap Cake was superb."
Quality was not good and service was poor,"The meat quality was not up to par for the prices they were charging. When we left some feedback, the manager himself basically said that it was their quality and we were not ""sawing"" the food correctly with the knives."
Good Steakhouse for Family Celebration,"Had the Crab cakes and tomato cheese salad for starters, the Porterhouse Steak and Barbequed Shrimp for our mains with sides. Finished with a banana cream pie. Everything was really good, will definitely return to try other items on the menu."
"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!WANTED TO CALL TO CHECK, BUT STRAIGHT TO MACHINE. THEN STRAIGHT TO PICKED UP CALL. already picked up c","WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!

wanted to call and check, but link straight to machine. Then straight to picked up
. already picked up call.

BUT! BUT! BUT! you can hear people at back ground. But nobody bothers to pick up! THE PHONE. LAZY PEOPLE WORKING AT THOSE PLACE!!!!

CAUTION!

AVOID! AVOID! AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!"
The steak was puuurfect!,Ordered a medium steak and was recommended medium rare. It turned out just right! The plate was hot so kept the steak cooking till the moment it entered yr mouth and it melted. Would visit again!
Great food and service,"3 of us shared a tomahawk, prawns and crab cakes. The employees were attentive and we were impressed by the hot plates. We could ask them to heat up the plates."
Lunch at Ruth Chris Steak House,"I book the table at this restaurant for lunch during my stay in ParkRoyal Collection Marina Bay.

I plan to have nice steak and restaurant specialty drink.

After I check out of hotel at 12 noon. I went to this restaurant, telling the staff that I had booked the table at 1 pm . I was allowed in , the female staff led me to table,

I scanned thru the menu, and found that Ruth Chris specialty drink was not in the menu.

I ordered soup of the day, and Petite steak with prawns.

I asked the male staff whether this restaurant served Ruth's Coffee..

He replied yes,,

Few minute later, I was given normal coffee.

I said no.. not this coffee

I wanted Ruth's Coffee

He said sorry , will serve after main course.

I had soup of the day (Onion soup with half bagutte )

Then main course came,,

It was 1 fillet mignon, cut into half then topped up with 3 prawns.

Meat taste nice

After meal, I requested for Ruth's Coffee

Again, I was served normal coffee.

The wait staff don't know how Ruth's Coffee looked like

Ruth's Coffee is actually mixture of coffee , Bailey Irish, and brandy, then topped it up with whipped cream.

It was featured in online menu in Ruth Chris Steak House Singapore website.

Okay never mind,, I realised that Ruth's Coffee is not probably served in lunch , only during dinner when bartender start work in evening.."
Disappointing sub standard for Ruth's Chris,"Having been to countless Ruth's Chris restaurants in NA we were excited to find them in Singapore.

Firstly the service was faultless.

Very child friendly too.

The price is very expensive but that has never concerned us as other venues it has been worth it.

Sadly the food just was sub standard here.

The filet wasn't rested properly so blood on the plate and a little tough and chewy.

The Mac and cheese is over powered with parmasen cheese.

Mash potato was good.

Fries good.

BBQ shrimp lack flavour vs other venues, just bland.

Over all just disappointing steak and not worth the high price at all.

I think we'll wait till be are back in the U.S vs returning here."
Excellent service!,Went to celebrate our daughter’s 11th Birthday & they prepared a piece of cake for her. Food & service was excellent!
Food below expectations,"Food quality was disappointing. Ordered their signature Petite Filet and Ribeye steak. Medium rare for the filet turned out a little cold in the middle. Had to send back to the kitchen. Ribeye was a little dry and veiny.
I expected better food quality for the price they commanded.
Staff were friendly and attentive, so that helps a little."
"Great Service, Good Food","This is my 4th visit to Ruth Chris, always receive personalised services, friendly staff, flexible on requests, great food and steaks, we will continue to support Ruth Chris"
Always good value & service,"3rd visit - goos steaks, done exactly as requested, attentive service. Crab cakes need a review but all in all the sides, mains etc are top class."
my favourite steak house in spore!,"Never fail to satisfy. Love the hot plates, and you can request for fresh hotplates too. Keep those steaks sizzling. The sides are so good too, esp love the creamed spinach and onion rings."
Must go place for steak!,Was able to try their steak last April 16 due to lots of reviews in social media and i must say that everything is top notch! I enjoy the steak as well as the crabmeat . The servers and this girl thessa assisted our dining experience by suggesting and letting us know what to order . Would like to commend the food and everyone who take care of our table to get the best experience possible!
What a good dining experience!,"We are fun of eating steak and we went to this restaurant with no expectations at all. They are known for their steaks and so..... So we give it a try to dine. When we had taste of their steak that was so hmmm good. It’s a mouth melting steak for God’s sake and steak was so tender well seasoned and cook to perfection. They are really above to our expectations and the crab cake was superb the taste was great you can really taste the crab. To the service wise from reception to dining was flawless, you will be greeted by the young beautiful lady Ms. Thessa service is excellent with attention to details. Overall was excellent. Thank you so much."
For beef lover.,Although the pricing is a bit high but the beef quality is good. A good restaurant to have food therapy. The service is Excellent. Strongly recommend.
Birthday Celebration,First time dining there. Good experience. The staff were friendly and nice. Food was good. Enjoyed every bit. 👍🏼 yum!
Value for money steaks and more,"Brought some valued clients to Ruth's Chris for year-end dinner. Tried out a few appetizers, of which the crab cakes and carpaccio were the most commendable.

We ordered Porterhouse and Ribeye. Both were excellent, my personal preference would be the Porterhouse given the size, taste and quality. The Creamed Spinach and Mac And Cheese were perfect complements to the meat.

A pleasant surprise that awaited us at the end of the meal were the yummy desserts. We ordered the creme brulee, chocolate bread pudding and the Cheesecake. Cant pick which one woukd be the best among the 3; i'd probably recommend you try all of them.

Kudos to the warm and friendly staff. Kudos to Chef KC who dropped by our table to check that everything was in order."
"MY BIRTHDAY,, MY FRIENDS <3","I heard about this restaurant and finally decided to come ,, my friends are bragging about the steaks with the portions really to share. To my surprise they even get me a birthday cake not knowing few more days before my real birthday. I wanna thank all the staff who sing for me with all their hearts ."
Birthday Meal - Excellent !,"Booked this prior to leaving the UK as a birthday meal and we were not disappointed with the atmosphere, service and food - if anything to criticise it was a bit expensive but you get what you pay for and the steaks were divine !!
A very good wine list to choose and large menu - something for everyone !
Highly Recommended Restaurant"
The most expensive wine list in Singapore!,Great menu and reasonably priced but the wine list was so steep we left the restaurant - cheapest bottle I found on the list was $175!
1800 F broiler still cant produce that NY flavour,"I love steak and where else but New York. But being in Singapore and reading about Ruth's Chris 1800 deg broiler , I felt it just has to be the same as they do there. It wasnt.
Probably because of the ageing . Most N York chop houses dry age the beef about 28 days. Firstly, moisture is evaporated from the muscle. The resulting process of desiccation creates a greater concentration of beef flavour and taste. Secondly, the beef's natural enzymes break down the connective tissue in the muscle, which leads to more tender beef.

The Ruth Chris NY cut still had moisture in it, and was also a bit oily, perhaps they buttered the steak before serving . There was no doubt the meat was tender and had flavour but it cant get my ""top steak"" vote.

My side was a Caesar salad, but sadly the 1st attempt by the chef didnt have the proper mayo dressing, no bacon bits ...lets not worry about anchovy. The accommodative head waiter ensured it was done to standard with the repeat.

I was very happy with the service , which could be because one of the diners was previously senior management of the hotel chain, but nevertheless service was good.

Did not order any wine as I found the pricing for wine exorbitant. $28/- for a entry level glass of Torbreck Australian Shiraz was just ridiculous.

I guess with the pricing on the steaks like $80/- for a 350 gm NY Sirloin the sides and wines have to compensate. A similar size steak in NY is US46/-.

My hunt for that NY taste continues......

For dessert I would say the cheesecake is the saving grace for the restaurant . It was excellent."
My wife's birthday celebration,"I had a wonderful hosted lunch by Chef Farid, he came to our table to check on our food,which was amazing,and beautifully executed with precision.

Special thanks to Mr Teody and his team, especially a shout out to Mr Mohan for attentively looking after our table. Always checking in on us and offer assistance. Also to note Miss ika who is very cheerful and enthusiastic in taking out picture. Truly a wonderful experience that I would reccomend anyone who would be treated well and well taken care off. Kudos to the team!"
Awesome steak here but wine list pricey,"For food I would give 5* always and it's backed up by attentive service from the team, even though one item was missed from our sides order the kitchen recovered it well.
Steaks were awesome, we went for the tasty 12oz rib-eye but shout outs for the tasty sides and dessert.
Never any issues on food quality at Ruth's Chris but a couple of areas I feel could be improved is:
1) the wine list (entry point for reds is near to $200 a bottle and knowing the RRP I'd say their mark-up is on the way too high side). One bottle of red accounted for more than 30% of our final bill making this a place for special occasions only, which is a pity as I'd like to go more often but I like a glass or two with good food. They could offer some entry points at <$100 and increase turnover I feel.
2) While the veg sides were nice, for $20 I would would have liked to see the the corn side dish piled high with corn - there wasn't enough for 3 to share and I'd say only enough for one if you like corn - so for such a low cost vegetable this was disappointing. Contrary to this the mushroom side was piled high, some some inconsistency from the kitchen here.
Banana cream pie and Creme Brulee deserts both hearty and decent size, good enough for sharing."
Disappointing food,"Large and spacious, this elegant restaurent offers an interesting menu. I enjoyed the bright and bold paintings on the walls. The service was good but food disappointing. We tried a few appetisers and side dishes plus the mains. The Barbecued Prawns with Creole Butter was overly rich for me. The Brussel sprouts were tough. The grilled asparagus was good. Our ribeye steaks were tough and served in a plate of oil. The best part of the meal was the dessert! We enjoyed the cheesecake and the chocolate cake with molten centre."
Fantastic staff!,My wife and I made a spur of the moment decision to eat lunch here. I booked a table via my mobile for 1415. We arrived in time to be told they had last orders at 1430 and closed at 1500. The staff were excellent. They took our orders and the food and wine was delivered promptly. My steak was delicious as was my wife’s. They made a point of telling us we were not under pressure to eat and depart. I didn’t realise my wife had been chatting to them but after we had eaten our main course we were served a surprise anniversary desert. It was our Wedding Anniversary but I had made no mention of it. Ruth’s Chris Singapore should be proud of their staff. They certainly made our visit memorable.
A steakhouse chain,"A steakhouse chain not unlike morton’s , with a few differences. The bread is nicely toasted , but the onion bread from morton’s is better. The chicken is cooked differently, the steaks are similar. They put more butter in everything and you can ask them to go easy on that if you prefer"
Buttered goodness,The experience at Ruth’s Chris is very different from most steakhouses. The use of butter adds a special touch and flavor. Atmosphere is wonderful for dates and small groups!
Wouldn’t seat a single woman,"I was staying in the hotel where the restaurant was located. I had been traveling nonstop internationally for a week. My association booked a conference at the hotel. I was so exhausted that all I wanted was to have an early meal in the hotel and then go to sleep. The easily half empty restaurant would not seat me until 9:30 pm even in their internal bar area where men were eating their meals and there were 4 empty high top tables. I watched for an hour and saw no one even arrive at the restaurant, and numerous empty tables remained as well as all the ones in their internal bar area, yet they still refused to seat me."
Lunch,Excellent steaks and side dishes like crab cakes and salads at reasonable prices. Attentive service throughout the lunch.
Steak,"Food was bad, petite beef fillet turned cold pretty quickly. Rib eye was huge but not enjoyable at all. Side dishes was ok but dessert (cheesecake ) was too sweet and too much. Paid sgd300 for two set dinners. Was a total waste of money. Suggest to order ala carte and go for specific dishes. Service and atmosphere was alright."
Delicious steaks,"The restaurant is quite easy to find and once inside, the ambiance is really nice, with soft and soothing music in the background. The staff were extremely helpful and approachable and really enhanced my dining experience.

For appetisers, I ordered oysters, and they were fresh. Really good. For my entrée, I ordered the 310g filet and it was really amazing. The plate was sizzling hot and the steak was a perfect medium-rare. I think that the portion was just right for me as my appetite is quite big (haha)! For dessert, we ordered the chocolate lava cake and apple crumble. They were both really delectable and the portions were quite large. We ended up sharing both of the dishes among the 5 of us.

Overall it is an amazing place. Just note that their website may not be up-to-date with regards to the availability of wine."
Perfect steak,"Fantastic experience at Ruth’s Chris Steak House in Marina Mandarin. Went for crab cakes, then fillet with the most amazing shrimp, fabulous corn and mushroom sides. Perfectly cooked and excellent service. Will return and can recommend!"
great night,"great great dish of steak(ribeye steak)and salmon were delicious,good location with a live music out of restaurent but we enjoyed and also crab cake was special but abit expensive"
Great place for that special occasion,"Been there 3 or 4 times now and each time the steaks are fantastic. Be careful if you don't have a large appetite, as the steaks are BIG. Had the petite fillet and it was so tender and very tasty and complemented by great side dishes . Nice elegant atmosphere. It was a friends birthday and we thought it strange that they asked to take a photo of the group, but then they presented the birthday celebrant with the print of the photo they took....nice touch !"
exactly as you would expect in the US,"when you simply must have a fantastic steak - and all the expected accompaniements - look no further! Very attentive staff, reasonable wine list, not too crowded. reasonable value. you will leave satisfied!"
The steaks are very good!,"The steaks are very good, choose Medium done as it will still be sizzling and cooking on the 500 degrees plate. It was our first visit and went there to celebrate a birthday. Other than the staff wishing us a happy birthday, there was nothing else being done. If you ask 3 times (once on the reservation, twice onsite), I thought I should at least expect a little gesture. Anyway, I did the reservation through Chope. Take note that the chope vouchers can only be used on a-la-carte menu and not the lunch menu and not the Ruth Classics menu. The coffee or tea ($9) from the lunch menu is about the same discount from the Chope vouchers so no big deal. The only thing is that this info is very valuable as they do not share the details and was evasive when I called to enquire if I could use the vouchers. I was trying to decide if I should buy but not much difference unless you are going to order from the ala-carte menu. Their 2 plus points are that the steaks and the service was good. The sides are on the expensive side with a mashed potato at $18 and creamed spinach or spinach au gratin at $18. A 6oz fillet is at $65. Portion was good for me with a small appetite. Overall, if it is a special occasion or you are happy to splurge a little, its still a good experience. Reserve through Chope for $100 Chope dollars as reward."
Nice dinner,I went here on a Wednesday night. It was pretty empty. The food was great. I have the shrimp cocktail and the ribeye. It’s a pricey place to eat but the food was very good. I didn’t like getting charged 15 dollars for the water but that seems common in Singapore. Overall the really good food makes the place.
Wonderful quality for deep pockets!,"I was there with my whole family and plus ones. Came up to 10 pax. We ordered a la carte. I brought my own bottle of wine, but they waived the corkage as we also bought a bottle of champagne from them.

The portions are big and we ordered the Porterhouse for Two. Technically, it is supposed to feed two, but it fed 5 of us. So for the 10 of us, we ordered two portions of that.

We had starters which we also shared, and the sides to the mains. Finally, also 3 desserts we shared.

Total bill? Just $12 shy of $1,100!"
Great steaks,Watch out for the plates.. can be very hot.. I highly recommend Ruth's Chris.. I not only go here for business but with my family..
Great food with even better service!,"Came to celebrate hubby's birthday on national day. Knowing it's our first time here, the friendly staff Mohan started off with highlighting the signature dishes and gentle reminder of the hot plates. He stayed attentive yet non intrusive throughout our dinner time, and even came over in between to inform us of the fireworks and where best to see it from the patio. Food wise, the crab cake, seared tuna, steak and cheesecake are all our favorite dishes. Overall a great experience second to none."
Impressive and good choice,"We had lunch with overseas guests and it was a good choice of location. Restaurant was quite during lunch hour that weekday. We had full attention of wait staff.

Ordered the fillet mignon steak small. Requested for medium and it was cooked as requested. Before that we tried the lobster bisque. Had some break served to us. Instead of eating with butter, i dipped into the soup instead. We orderes 3 sides to share: asparagus, mushroom and potatoes. All good. The meal was filling and we skipped dessrts and just had coffee. Its a good place to entertain clients and very quiet during lunch sessions do we could really talk comfortably. The friendly service just made the dining and meeting just so much more enjoyable on top of the excellent food."
Perfect,"Very good, quick service, nice ambience San Pellegrino SGD 30 Bottle Luigi Bosca Malbec SGD 140 6oz filet SGD 65. perfect! Onion soup SGD 23 Ahi Tuna SGD 30"
Excellent food as always,i took my 12yo son to Ruth's Chris on one Sat afternoon. Excellent food and my son absolutely enjoyed it. Great service as well. Keep up the good standard!
Amazing lunch,"It was amazing lunch at Ruth Chris steak house, taste and smell, made us very hungry, and service was very good."
The best steaks and more!,"My favorite steakhouse in Singapore. I don’t just come here for steaks - I come here to enjoy fantastic service and delicious southern style cuisine. The crab cakes are perfectly cooked, crispy outside, juicy on the inside. They have gumbo! This is such a rare dish in Singapore - so you should ask ahead when making your reservation. For the main course, go with the cowboy ribeye. The bone infuses so much more flavor into the steak, you will be blown away. I’m not normally a fan of mushrooms but in this case, I order mushrooms because the way they do it is delicious. There’s no overpowering smell, it’s perfectly balanced with a hint of acidity. The desserts are so surprisingly. With main courses this heavy, they put a twist on every dessert so you can actually enjoy it despite the heavy meal. Try the cheesecake or the chocolate chip bread pudding (with orange liqueur custard).
It was such a wonderful experience and the service made me feel like I was being fed by friends."
Excellent meal and service,My husband ordered a medium ribeye and we were impressed with the steak as it was juicy and tender. Any plus point is steak was still warm by the time we finished it. The ambience was cosy and service was very good.
Standard has dropped,I went about two years back and more recently. We noticed that the wait staff were not as attentive and quality of food has dropped.
Highly Recommend,"We chose to eat at Ruth’s Chris Steak House on our last night and we were not disappointed.
Great selection of steaks to choose from with the waiters teaming them up with great choices of wine to compliment the meal.
They also have a delicious array of desserts if you have room left after your meal.
I will definitely visit this restaurant again"
Fabulous steaks,"We had a birthday celebration in the private room that seats 10 very comfortably. Service and food were impeccable.
Would highly recommend the oysters Rockefeller, crab cakes, tomato mozzarella salad, mac and cheese, grilled asparagus, creamed spinach and lyonnaise potatoes.
The meats were terrific esp the lamb chops and cowboy ribeye. They were juicy, succulent and very flavoursome.
Must also have the signature cheesecake. It was smooth and creamy with a perfect crust.
For those with toddlers and young kids, there’s a nice playroom that our 2 year old loved."
Service with a smile,David who was assisting our table was very accommodating and attentive. Steak & Shrimps and broccoli gratin are my fav two.
Worst Ruth’s Chris out of 3,"My wife and I had previously dined at Ruth’s Chris in Houston, Texas and Hong Kong. Both were fabulous, so when celebrating 30 years married, it seemed sensible to reserve a table at this restaurant. What a mistake!

We arrived promptly for the time shown on our reservation confirmation email. Our reservation couldn’t be found on their system. Had I not shown front of house our confirmation email, we were not getting in! We were guided to a table in a corner of the restaurant, which had the feeling of being placed on the naughty seat. Plenty of free tables in the restaurant. Why were we placed at this uncomfortable table?

The server took our order and repeated back to us incorrectly. When we questioned this, the server read from the same order and this time reiterated our order correctly. When the order was delivered to the table, it was wrong!

The food was poor quality. My steak was overly fatty. Marbling I expect, but not large sections of fat dominating the meat content. The vegetables were over cooked, therefore dry and inedible.

We are not complainers, but it was very obvious that all was not well. No-one asked us about the amount of uneaten food being picked up from our table.

As we were leaving, I asked front of house for an explanation about the missing reservation. She replied “wrong date”. Again, I retrieved the email and pointed to the correct date. She then said “on our system”. No apology and the most incredible lack of Customer Care.

It’s our opinion that Ruth’s Chris Singapore is different to the others we visited because it is located within the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, whereas the others were standalone restaurants where the staff believed in Customer Service.

Ruth’s Chris Singapore is also overpriced. Also, likely due to its in-hotel location.

We will not return to Ruth’s Chris Singapore and suggest to anyone thinking of going there, to give it a miss. Not worth the money and terrible Customer Service.

Wish I could have scored it zero!"
Great Steaks but....,"Ruth's Chris is among the best of the premium franchise steak houses
but it is NOT cheap. I do enjoy the steaks there but today there is a lot of quality competition serving great beef with very high quality service. Whereas in Ruth's Chris it is efficient service without the passion. For instance their dessert pie is huge but with a miniscule scoop of ice cream-hardly enough for a quarter of the pie. When I commented on this the server took my plate away and came back with an additional miniscule scoop and charged me for it (as I found out later). That cheesed me off a bit. Great steak, nice environment but maybe not again....."
"Good steak and service, but...","...it doesn't seem as good as last time (which for me was four years ago).

The service is very good. Almost to the point of being annoying - I often wonder if waiters deliberately monitor your eating then as soon as you have a mouthful of food they ask ""is everything OK here sir?"" It drives me crazy. But at least they are looking after you.

As many others say it is very expensive. My set meal with three beers set me back nearly SGD 200. That's way over the top but I wanted to go back after some amazing meals years ago.

Steaks are very small, or at least much smaller than I remembered. The carpaccio starter was OK, however while I realise the meat is cut thin, this was razor thin - hardly worth a bite. The bread is nice and fresh but was too much for me.

Dessert was great but again, very small. I'm not a big eater (and I did order one of the smaller steaks but it just seemed lacking).

It's handy if you're staying there and can afford it. It's a nice night out but and expensive one."
Not worth the price,"Went there twice, once in Jan, the other in Mar. Service is pretty fine, just that the food is average. Taste is a bit more to the salty side. The value compared to many steak house are not worth it."
Best Steak & Soup,"This was one of the best dining experiences we've had. Brought my partner for a belated Valentine's Day dinner with obviously high expectations due to the price point.

The staff were very attentive and well informed. I think it's important to listen to their expertise since the steaks are served on hot plates so if you usually like Medium you should order one down, Medium Rare. They explained everything in detail and we followed their recommendations. Thank goodness we did. The steaks served were perfect. You could smell the steaks as they came out the kitchen and it was just lovely. Our favourite was the petite fillets. So tender.

We also tried the Lobster Bisque soup and it really started the whole meal on the right note. Will definitely be back for that!

We used Chope Vouchers and saved 10% off but even without it I think the food was worth it. Our bill came up to $220 for 2 people without the discount and we had soup, steak, sides, and dessert. So full."
Don’t judge a book by it’s cover!,"Was out sightseeing in Singapore and decided to try this restaurant which was on our way to see the Light and music show at the Metal Tree Garden then the Bayfront water and light show, closer to where we were staying. It was 6pm, well before ‘fine dining’ hours and as children are welcome, assumed our shorts and shirts would be okay. Was asked if we would like to go upstairs and change by the restaurant concierge. Well, won’t be eating at this restaurant in Singapore, or ever stay at the Mandarin hotel, or the restaurant in Toronto again. Restaurant just became second rate."
A let down for high end restaurant,Several items on menu were unavailable. The staff were polite and professional. Service was excellent.
Nowhere as good as it should be!,"Very disappointing overall. Horribly expensive and the steak simply wasn’t up to standard for the price. I ordered my steak medium well and it was cooked right through and was dry. Staff were pleasant and service was ok but the restaurant was virtually empty so lacked any atmosphere. Maybe other people knew what we didn’t, and avoid it! Wouldn’t have minded the cost if the steaks had been excellent but they weren’t.
Because it was my husbands birthday they served up a free dessert to him which was quite nice but other restaurants do the same so although a nIce touch, it’s not uncommon."
Lunar New Year Celebration,Decided to have western food for lunar new year. Food was good portion was generous. The service was ok in general but some of them were a little forgetful we had to remind them a few times before we get what we wanted. A little disappointing considering that this is a famous steakhouse.
Cowboy Steak,Steak was good and the Au gratin was flavorful. Will definitely return to try the steak and other sides.
Will be Back!!☺,Dine in with my family and the food is really delicious. Especially the top 2% USDA steak is great. And our server David`s service is so good. Compliments to him*thumbs up*
More than meet the ribeye,"Much better than Wolfgang ( without the puck ). Good quality steak , well grilled , great and attentive service. Just the way steakhouses should be ! On par with our visits in the USA"
Review,The waiter was inexperienced and the ribeye steak was poorly done. It was for my husband’s birthday and it’s the first time he did not finish his steak as the steak was tough
Great time as always,"Always a great experience in Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. For this visit, we went back to our favorites (crab cakes, ribeye, potato au gratin, creamed spinach, and my ""must-order"" cheesecake and bread pudding).

Special shout out to the staff for making our dinner a relaxing and enjoyable one. (Chef KC, who even went out of his way to check on us, Heydee, Ezan, David and Farid.)

Will definitely be back."
Expensive but best steak (and bread) in town,"I’ve been to all the main steak houses in Singapore from Morton’s to Bedrock but Ruth Chris is by far the beat steak I have eaten in years, not just locally, the cowboy rib eye was amazing. The sides were merely ok but that’s not why you visit. The bread here is out of this world and when added with their home made butter (and a little salt) it’s almost worth coming here just for that :-)"
Birthday Dinner,Ordered the rib eye and foie gras to shard. Fantastic food and service! An enjoyable birthday celebration
The food is really awesome than most steakhouse,"Having living in Singapore
The number of steak house prices are getting ridiculously expensive and the quality is getting bad.

I asked a friend for recommendation and this restaurant name was highly recommend

Tuck away in a 4 star hotel on the 4th floor ... be ready for extremely tasty steak!

There are 6 of use and we order a porter house and ribeye (portion was perfect for 6)

We also order some starters and sides ... my recommendation would be to give the hot vegetables sides a miss and try other stuffs

This will be my favorite joint for a while ... really good steak ... oh the price is comparable to the 4 major steak house in Singapore ... be prepared l!"
Dinner at Ruth Chris,Spend about SGD$150 per pax with a glass of wine. Great service and food. Except no complimentary parking.
Just perfect,"Food was great and service was so genuine (none of that pretentious stuff you sometimes find in fine dining establishments). Our server Jinlong was attentive without being intrusive. We really enjoyed the experience and we are Ruth chris first timers. Before, we were going to Mortons but i have told my husband we will now come here instead!"
Excellent service and food. Perfect date,Petite filet and ribeye were on point. Appetiser crab cakes were a delight. Very good service and waiters were extra helpful seeing I’m pregnant.
Excellent Steak but service can be improved,"We were there for dinner on a Saturday night and the place was perfect for a romantic date. Tables were nicely spaced out and chairs were pretty comfortable. The steak was awesome but the service staff failed to inform that the plate was so hot and my partner burnt his thumb when he touched it. I think its an important reminder as it was our first visit and we didn't know that the steak would be served on an extremely hot plate. The server did apologise and luckily it didn't escalate to something worse. During our dining time, there were also a few instances where we had to walk up to get service as the staff were nowhere to be seen. For a fine dining establishment, I think its important to be attentive to the guests at all times and be available when guests need help. Nevertheless, the food was great, dessert was great, which made up for the lapse in service."
Miserable,"Have been there a friday for dinner and will never go in this place anymore. Was expecting at this level of price and reputation of the brand much more. Waiters/manager unable to serve a water at a good temperature.. 4 time asking, and each time wrong. Steak medium rare was rare, could have asked to change ... but no time unfortunately... patatoes gratin , 20 usd very average. Total bill 158 usd... should be perfect at this price. And i didn t feel that they apologize at least .. a real terrible experience.
I strongly recommend not to go there except if you have time and money to waste. JF."
Best Steak Restaurant in Singapore,"Excellent service. Waiter offered ways to order with good suggestions. For eg, I couldn't finish even a wine by the glass he split that into 2 glasses to share with my wife and added a bit more......"
Steak Treat,Great Steaks and side dishes. Crab cake starter excellent. Good atmosphere for a steakhouse. Staff friendly and efficient
"Awsome meal, 5 stars steakhouse","Visited Ruth's Chris Steakhouse located at level 4 of Marina Mandarin hotel on 21 Sep 2018 with my wife to celebrate her birthday. Informed the restaurant during booking that it will be birthday celebration. Arrived at our reservation time at 700pm. The restaurant interior is classy, service staffs are professional and welcoming, tables are well-spaced, lightings tend to be slightly dark with a romantic atmosphere. We were seated next to the window facing the hotel bar & main lobby.

Food that we had:

1) Bread with butter (Complimentary): This bread came warm and taste great! what a way to start our dinner.

2) Sizzling blue crab cakes (S$35): We informed the waiter that we are sharing this appetizer and he kindly helped us to separate into our own plate (each of us get one). The Cakes are made up of fresh blue cheese on sizzling hot plate, yummy & juicy goodness into every bite

3) Barbeque shrimp (S$35): 5 fresh and succulent large shrimps + 1 nicely roasted garlic bread in reduced white wine, butter , garlic and spices sauce. We slurp up all the sauce.

4) Ribeye steak -12 Ounce (S$80): One of their signature cut, the custom-aged midwestern beef is lightly seasoned in pepper and salt and presented in a sizzling hot plate. Every bite is juicy goodness with great beefy flavour

5) New York Strip - 12 ounces (S$80): Also served on a sizzling hot plate, this cut is firmer than the ribeye steak but provide a good well-bodied texture, very tasty and satistying steak

6) Au Gratin (S$20)- Potato baked in cream sauce topped with cheddar cheese, it was great but we didnt finish as the portion is huge

7) Creamed Spinach:(S$18) - We enjoy this side dish, a good side dish for steak

8) roasted wild mushroom (S$20)- The best side dish out of the 3,the mushroom are well cooked and tasted very fresh

9) Complimentary birthday cake (bread pudding)- Ruth's Chris staff had prepared a compimentary birthday bread budding for my wife. Thought this is complimentary, we aprpeacite their effort and thoughtfulness, also it is a generaous portion. Nice and not too sweet

10) Cheesecake (S$24)- We were so full after the savory food that when our waiter presented us the ""dessert samples"", we almost rejected him but upon seeing Ruth's chris signature Cheesecake, we ordered. The cream filling is very smooth , silky and the portion size is huge(enough for 2-3 pax). We only managed to finish halt and packed the left over home

11)Drinks we order: Shirley temple (Mocktail)(S$15) , blueberries mojito (S$25) , still bottled water (S$15)

Staffs/ table service: The staffs are the core greatness of this steakhouse. Our waiter serviced us all the way with a smile, gave us the appropriate recommendation, provided immaculate & professional table service without instruding our privacy. Even assisted us to take photo a number of times during our visit

Total Bill: S$432.05 (for 2 pax- dinner)

Verdict: We had tried Morton's the steakhouse before in Mandarin Oritental Hotel. Ruth's Chris certainly live up to its name and is easy to see why they are as popular in US. Ruth's Chris gives us a different perspective of what a US steakhouse is. Ruth's Chris provides a more ""homey"" feeling with equal high quality & tasty steaks, the steaks are worth every penny of its price and the portion is huge. Their sides and appetisers taste great too and it is overall a near perfect experience.

Will I be back? HELL YES when I dream of being in a beefy heaven!"
"Great meat, great atmosphere","Impeccable service, beautiful paintings and most important wonderful meat and side dishes on the table. Good choice in wines. So all good!!!"
Expensive.,Butter steak and lamb were nice. Expensive though. There are places where you can get better steak for lower price.
"Great steakhouse, quite expensive","I had an excellent cowboy ribeye, tender and well prepared. Paired with a glass of red wine, good not outstanding. Fast and friendly service. So, everything good. But really expensive..."
"Great cuts, amazing meat",Amazing big steaks from lots of different cuts. Great service. Quite expensive. 4th floor of marina mandarin hotel
Best Steak in Singapore,"Came here for my anniversary dinner and my wife and I throughly enjoyed the meal and the experience at Ruth's Chris. Having tried some other highly-rated steak places like Mortons and Wooloomooloo before this, I'd like to say that Ruth's Chris is the best I've tried so far.

We are small eaters so we shared the T-bone steak as well as a starter (the Ahi Ahi Tuna, nicely seared). Sadly we weren't able to try more but I'm sure it would've been amazing as well.

Loved how the Tuna came without the usual fishy smell that you find in most Tuna in Singapore, signifying that it was really fresh. Seared to perfection, with the char and crisp on the outside and still raw on the inside.

T-bone was the highlight of our meal. Firstly the steak was served sizzling hot, and we were also given two heated plates to ensure that our food stayed hot throughout the meal. Waiter was kind enough to inform us how we should be consuming the meat - taking the fattier part first before consuming the lean meat to get the mouth juices flowing. Quality of the meat was top notch, every bite full of flavour and meat wasn't too hard (we ordered medium rare).

Ended off the day with a nice mini dessert - the bread pudding."
A great surprise,I was visiting Singapore for business and I was pleasantly surprised to find Ruth’s Chris steak restaurant in my hotel (Marina Mandarin). I have eaten before in 2 different different Ruth’s Cris restaurants in Canada and it was great to have steak of the same excellent standards in Singapore. Service was good and attentive. A recommendation for steak lovers.
Always Impressive,"Not only is the service excellent, the food and dessert menus are extensive and delivers on their promises. The starters that must be ordered are the incredibly crunchy delish onion rings, The carpaccio, and, the Caesar salad with the crunchy bits of cheese. For mains, we always have the porterhouse steak. Although it says for 2, it usually feeds 4. The meat is juicy and tender and melts in your mouth. But a big wow must be mentioned for the banana cheese pie and the cheesecake. They are simply delicious and must trys. You won’t regret it."
Superb Steak House Experience,"Ruth's has everything you want in a steak house - nice ambiance, excellent service and of course, great great steaks. Everything we had was good and our steaks were done perfectly."
Schoolmates Gathering,"Fantastic beef...all cooked to perfection...medium...we had the ribeye, Fillet mignon, New York strip, cowboy ribeye, Porterhouse....desserts were also heavenly"
Disappointed Diner,"The steaks and sides were great - and they should be for the price (Steaks start at $80 and you need to buy sides as the plate is just the steak).

What really let this restaurant down was the last of any real warmth and responsiveness from the service team. The request for another bottle of wine wasn't complicated but took a couple of requests to get it delivered - not expected at at this level of fine dining.

The atmosphere (or lack of) was not helped by the crying baby at the next table - really????

Just as well that we had great company catching up with old friends also travelling through Singapore when we were visiting - but next time I'd save the cash and go to one of the excellent alternates that Singapore offers."
Birthday dinner,"We haven’t been to Ruth Chris for ages and this is our first time visiting the one in Singapore.

The decor is fancy but a bit cold compared to others we have been to previously. Service is great as always.

We were presented half a loaf of warm bread as soon as we ordered our dinner.
The bread isn’t worth the bite if you don’t have a big stomach for a big dinner!

We ordered the rib eye with blue cheese crust. The steak was well cooked and the crust tasted great (but anything with cheese is mostly good anyway!)

We had the Brussels sprout and mushroom as the side dishes. I thought the mushroom was good but the Brussels sprout was rather average. I had the bbq shrimp starter portion as my main which was also average although it’s a signature dish of Ruth Chris.

The cheese cake however was to die for.
The cheese cake is really the main reason we come to Ruth Chris. As it as a bday celebration, the staff brought out a bread chocolate pudding as a complementary cake. I had one bite and left the rest untouched.

All in all, it was a good dinner. We will return for sure even just for the cheesecake!"
