Dinner,"Dinner with family for CNY. It was a bit confusing prior to the visit as a la carte menu wasn‚Äôt available which was different to what was advertised. However, the staff were very accommodating and able to change one of the dishes on the set menu. Excellent food and would definitely go back!"
Wonderful,Excellent meal. I love their dim sum brunch. Great value and lots of choice. Visited over LNY and whilst busy they left enough gaps between reservations and tables to feel personalised.
The service ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,"Food is nice, location is good...but the service is so terrible that it ruins the whole experience. We waited for ages for our drinks, every time we ordered water they would forget it, the poor waitress did not speak a word of English (and i feel for her, but how are we supposed to interact with her?)
It's sad because we had been at empress before and it has never been this bad"
Excellent choice for upscale dumplings.,If you want to try upscale dumplings and very tasty gyozas this is the place for you. I tried their impossible gyoza and it was delicious. Will return when in Singapore.
Thank you for the good food and great service!,"We were impressed by Timothy's service! He did the food ordering, cutting of our duck, serving our dishes, clearing our plates, photo taking and close our bill. Best part was we didnt have to wait too long at any one point of time."
The restaurant has aged badly,"The restaurant is apparently not well maintained. There are badly stained rugs and a chair that leaks (yes, water was literally gushing from the chair, as though someone was wringing a wet towel, when my spouse sat on it! ). We ordered the $63 per person set lunch, only the soup was good, the rest of the food just tasted of MSG."
Nice venue and good food,"Rave reviews amongst my friends. The spicy tofu came in a hotpot. So tasty! Good to have it with rice. The peking duck skin is crispy . Half duck is about 10 to 12 pieces of skin . The meat is used for the fried rice. Option of noodles.

Overall we enjoyed the atmosphere and friendly service"
Not for real dim sum foodie,"The atmosphere was wonderful, it's a great place to have cocktails and relax, catch up with friends over a nice evening / weekend. However, the food quality was absolutely terrible. The triple roast platter, was cold; the roast crackling pork had such a rubbery texture, it tasted awful. The spare rib was so overcooked that it was impossible to bite / slice off. Congee was tasteless, pickled cucumber was a joke that it shouldn't even be on the menu. We ordered almost everything on the menu and sadly, nothing deserved any recommendation."
Perfect except the service,"Empress, Asian Civilisations Museum: Farewell dinner for with our darling @ and thank you for dinner (you sure grabbed the bill fast before I could!) Chinoiserie Empress is so beautiful, elegant and stately. You‚Äôll love bathing in the lush soft glow of the lights and the tastefully curated furniture. A panorama of the twinkling lights and the Singapore river soothes your eyes. Then there‚Äôs the impressive food to match all the good styling and view. It‚Äôs vegan and vegetarian friendly, the impossible versions taste like meat. Were opted for all 6 appetisers - the award-winning pan-fried Impossible gyoza (thumbs-up the best), crispy eggplant with mushroom floss (love the play of textures and the eggplant was soft and played with crunches), crispy beancurd ‚ÄòPeking duck‚Äô (my least fav), deep-fried salmon skin, tofu and salted egg sauce (my 3rd fav, the fried tofu was so juicily soft yet fried so perfectly), Sichuan steamed dumplings, crispy cod ‚ÄòBi Feng Tang‚Äô style (bit-sized cod morsels that are perfectly fried and so tasty) and stir-fried king prawn for fun (gravy was perfect, the noodles silky and the wok hey sauce so smokingly wow). It was all in all a perfect setting, perfect food but marred by bad servicing. Once seated, they left you to your own devices. I had to scout hard for service. It was happy hour and they didn‚Äôt seem keen to keep up the service. Our waitress also didn‚Äôt know that the appetisers had vegetarian options. I pointed it out to her in the menu. She also got the dish names wrong. Service was good enough for cafe, let alone a swanky spot of this ilk. Thankfully, we had great company for the evening. #eatstylishtravelstylish"
Great vegetarian options!,"Great location and service. A surprising number of fabulous vegetarian dishes to complement the meat dishes. Finally, a modern Chinese restaurant that caters for vegetarians AND meat eaters.Well done! I'll be back for sure."
MUST VISIT FOR VEGANS and NON VEGANS!,I really enjoy the hospitality and the food and setting. I feel we need more of such concepts in Singapore
"Great food, great service",Spent my 1st wedding anniversary over at empress. Crusine here was awesome and surprisingly filling. Staff Eunice service was prompted and delicated.
Overrated,"Staff refused to let us dine indoor even when there were plenty of tables indoors. When we finished dining at the outdoor area, the indoor tables were still empty. Food was so so, for the exorbitant prices charged ($200 for 4), I had expected better quality. Dim sum were disappointing, fried brinjal normal, gongbao chicken was lousy. It is like the hits and misses mentioned by other reviewers. Pork ribs is ok, only good ones were fried rice and mapo tofu. Extremely overrated restaurant"
A Delightful Time Always,"This is my third time back here with my wife and this time our young son; we had our ROM dinner right here and so it's really special to us. Delighted to have an evening served by friendly staff with very special fusion cuisine, and a sweet little dessert to commemorate our anniversary. Thank you!"
Horrible food!,"Pathetic food and the staff was in a hurry,they served the main course before the appetisers! Don‚Äôt waste your time And money"
Very Nice Restaurant,"This restaurant is beautifully decorated along ethnic themes and yet manages to be cozy and welcoming. There is nothing subtle about the cooking. Strong, bold flavors front and centre. Not the place for the culinary purist or the faint of heart. The delicious food and innovative recipes mitigate the rather brusque and cold service."
The Empress impresses!,"Beautiful ambiance, good service, matched with quality Asian cuisine. Their lunch and dinner menus are great. My friends and colleagues are always impressed when I bring them here. It‚Äôs a gem"
Wonderful wonderful evening!,"Visited with my parents and had a wonderful time. The restaurant was in a beautiful setting, lovely interiors. The food was outstanding, service was also tops! Felt very well looked after. Tip: come early, see the sun setting, get a table indoors but at the end of the restaurant so you can also enjoy the outdoors!"
Great quality authentic Chinese Restaurant,Great view and ambience. Nice place to enjoy sunset by the river. Surprisingly super authentic Chinese food. Awesome peking duck!
Highly recommended,Great place at the water front. Nice to sit outside. Stylish to sit inside. A bit more posh. Lovely food. Big portions. Not too expensive.
Awesome vegetarian food,"We had vegetarian set dinner. The food is simply awesome. My parents are amazed by how they can make the vegetarian food to be so flavourful. There‚Äôs countless of wow every time we tried the dish that served. I must say, food is really good, and good service too! We would definitely go again!"
"Great food, ambience, and service","Visited with my sister. I am vegan and she is vegetarian, and there are ample options which are not just decent but really good dishes in and of themselves. I'm willing to say that Empress is one of, if not the best, special occasion restaurant in Singapore if you eat plant-based. Aside from the excellent food, the ambience is also fantastic.

Also want to mention the excellent service - we were seated on the far side of the restaurant from the entrance and were served by one male and one female server (pity we didn't get their names). They timed the courses perfectly and we never had to ask for anything (e.g. water refills, etc.) throughout the 2 hour meal. I had indicated that we had made the reservation to celebrate a birthday, and at the end of the meal they brought over a cake, took a picture (polaroid) for us, and presented us with the developed polaroid in a 'happy birthday' card. Genuinely top-notch service, super impressed."
Great Dim Sum brunch!,"Great Dim Sum brunch! We always enjoy the brunch selection here, especially the plant based selection. Service good also. We will be back, thank you"
Lunch set not as good as before,I think they might have recently changed their menu. Soup was on par. However the current mains were lacklustre. Desert I think they removed some items. Probably won‚Äôt visit again as there are other better choices at this price range.
Luxurious way to see the city at night,The overall decor and atmosphere is very inviting and modern. Its located in the heart of boat quay however feels upmarket and pleasant. View is of the river and you are surouded by city views. Reccomend to go at night when it is cooler weather so sitting outside is more pleasant!
Great dining experience.,Food was great. Staff were friendly and helpful. Dining atmosphere was nice. When we were leaving it was pouring outside and we didn‚Äôt have umbrella. The staff member kindly offered an umbrella for us too.
Birthday lunch,This is my second time visit your restaurant. A bit disappointed to the foods. The Peking duck is different from the first time I ate. The skin is very dark it look like overnight one. Taste n texture also different from the first time I eat. Some of the foods a bit salty. Overall disappointed as I bring my family along for birthday lunch.
Terrible,"No one served us, not sure if it‚Äôs the waitress told us there‚Äôs no table inside, didn‚Äôt even check our reservation ... worst experience ever"
Good ambiance by the river side but food so so,"The sesame chicken seem like microwave...the peking duck is good , the ee fu noodle is super good. the mapo tufu is very ordinary. the server out at the outdoor is very good and attentive."
A really good choice and worth the money,"The whole experience in this restaurant was very good. The service is very kind and helpful, food is really delicous and the ambience is comfortable - inside and outside at the river. We had a great dinner there and will be glad to come back."
Eh,Overall CNY menu was small and food came Luke warm and altogether the meal was underwhelming. Could get better elsewhere.
Dim Sum Brunch,Food was good. Was not very pleased with some of the steamed items. Could have been better. Overall 3.9 stars.
"Great food, nice ambience and prompt service","Had my lunch at Empress. Order triple roast, lamb loin, lemon chicken and fried rice. Overall, meat are tender and flavourful. Presentation is good. Portion is nice for 2 pax. Will visit again. Will recommend Empress for dining."
not so goodi,"i made reservation, but the empress didn't have my reservation.And then our table was so bad and asked change the table but couldn't."
Weekday set lunch,This is my fourth visit to Empress and I am always impressed with the food and ambience. Definitely a restaurant worth coming back for more!
Nice food!,The food is good but the air-con can be more cooling during lunch hour. The service for food can be slightly faster!
"We can't find a restaurant to top EMPRESS for value, service and stunning food","Every time we go to Empress it is amazing. [Oh I should mention we're vegetarian but I imagine from all the 'oohs' and 'ahhs' around us that this is true for meat eaters too.] The setting ‚Äî whether indoors or out ‚Äî is beautiful and the food is the kind of food where, at the end of the evening you want to go and embrace the chefs to thank them for their skill. Oh ... the wines and drinks are great too and they even have a 'Happy Hour'. Simply a great restaurant."
Excellent Food,"We over ordered, as usual, but the food was excellent in terms of flavour, presentation and portion size. I look forward to returning, especially for the fried kway teow with beef!
The availability of impossible meat substitutions to most dishes with meat was a nice touch."
Great Service,It was such a wonderful lunch! The friendly staff arranged cake and birthday card with photo for us as we were celebrating birthday!! Super sweet!
"Great ambience, great service as always!","My husband and I return to celebrate our wedding anniversary after having our ROM here one year ago and we're as always very pleased with everything at EMPRESS! We've been missing the food since we tasted it during our solemnization last year and our guests were all raving about them as well. Staff who served us today (unfortunately we did not get his name but we think he's Alan) was really helpful and friendly and they gathered to sign off an anniversary card for us (with a polaroid of us + cake)! How sweet!
The staff always gave us umbrella as it was pouring and gave us the liberty to return on our next visit. Thank you so much for the great experience. We are sure to be back!"
Good,"We‚Äôve been here a couple of times before and really enjoyed the food, hence coming back. We particularly enjoy the vegetarian and vegan options, really good.
As with most places nowadays, need to book quite far in advance. On the last day, they wanted to change timings‚Ä¶ in the end, we got our original timing, but this is something that could have been managed better. Overall service was good, so I hope this type of issue can be fixed quite easily."
Amazing Wedding Experience,"We held our solemnization and wedding reception within this beautifully decorated establishment with rave reviews from all guests on the food.

The ambiance has a good balance of traditional Chinese elements with a modern finish, making it an ideal venue right by the iconic Singapore River. Their signature meats, and soups are highly recommended to set your menu apart from the typical.

A special mention must be made to Bryan Yap of the team, who coordinated with us for the event from start to finish down to the last detail. Amidst the peak of the COVID situation which created a lot of changes and issues beyond anyone‚Äôs control - he was prompt, clear, and never failed to go above and beyond in multiple occasions. No doubts that his professionalism and attention to detail was THE key factor why our wedding went so smoothly from planning through to the end of the event.

Nothing but praises for Empress, and a strong recommendation for anything from a business gathering to your wedding events."
Friday Lunch,"Old friends reconnecting - 1st time at Empress. Overall good experience, tables not so close to each other, food was excellent, no corkage on our wine. 3 other wines we tried to buy on the wine list not in stock so they reduced the total bill 10%. Good outdoor smoking spot too.
Definitely will return"
Impressed with Empress,"It was my 2nd trip , and I was welcomed with very friendly receptionist.
She was so friendly and got one of the best place . I was happy to see my SG newbie friend to enjoy beauty of Singapore , She was so happy with great taste of every dishes and wonderful ambience.
Thanks for warm service and wonderful food . Especially we loved the dumping soup.
This can be my most favorite restaurant in SG from now on ."
Lunch Experience at Empress,Good food and service was great. No heavy crowd during lunch hours which makes it rather conducive if you prefer a quieter time.
Princess Birthday party,Awesome food and ambience the location is great. a lot of vegetarian options so all of us were able to enjoy
Great dimsum brunch on a Sunday,"Great dimsum brunch, good variety to pick from, hubby loved the black bean ribs! They also have good vegan menu for guests witl diet restrictions. High recommended place for group brunch or couple brunch."
Outdoor seatings are too hot for lunchtime. But generally food are good.,"We made a phone reservation one week before and received a wrong number of pax in SMS. Furthermore, the day before the actual day, we were told timing has to be changed which affected our plans. Too last minute notification. Quite disappointed in the reservation service."
Lovely Lunch,"Location, Service & Food was great! Sichuan Dumpling is a must to try!! Pumpkin soup too! 4th visit and still loving it!"
"Average food, quiet ambience","Food was average, and we had upset stomach after dinner‚Ä¶ was not served fresh. We had the set with the signature dishes."
Great experience,Had an enjoyable dining experience at Empress at ACM. We had the vegetarian dim sum brunch and it was awesome. Food Presentation and taste were all so good. Staff members were very warmth and celebrated my bday for me too. Thanks :)
Nice Vegetarian menu,"Food was good, Staff was helpful and offered us Umbrellas to leave when it started to rain outside ! Thanks a lot guys ! A really great night there"
Elegant & polite,"This place has an old world charm. Though I'm a vegetarian & they don't have that many veg choices, Empress is still its one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. The staff is very friendly & the atmosphere is elegant & charming."
Good food,"Was a good place for a peaceful meal.
The location is not visible from the main street and need to walk around before able to locate.
Not a good place to go during rainy season as not shelter from any carpark nor from anywhere.
For couples with stroller will be challenging as the handicap walkway is being corden off."
Good plant based food at empress,Good food and would recommend the plant based 3 course set lunch! The soup starter nice! Main course mock fish with pomelo brings out the taste and the rice is healthy and delicious
Wedding Dinner At Empress,"I had the privilege of hosting my Wedding dinner at Empress (ACM) and was greatly assisted by both Jack Sim and Bryan Yap with the preparation and execution. Despite our many questions and requests, both of them were quick to oblige and often made constructive suggestions to improve the flow of events! The venue was decorated beautifully on our actual wedding evening and the food was superb. In fact, many of the dishes were highly raved about amongst our guests. I would highly recommend Empress for Weddings or even a special dinner for their exceptional atmosphere and friendly staff!"
No Words,Fantastic food and atmosphere by the river. Roasted platter is a must try. Top quality. Bring your family and friends who like Chinese food
Dinner,This was my 1st visit and I will def return. Very nice ambience. Service was excellent despite it being busy. And the food was great. Chose the set meal but they have many choices. I would recommend pre booking as by 7pm it was very busy. Overall very enjoyable.
Thank you Joy & Team - Wonderful Weekend Dimsum Brunch,"I celebrated my birthday at Empress Weekend Dimsum Brunch. I am very satisfied with the quality and variety of dim sum - but what the experience so memorable and to-be-raved-about is the service quality. Our waitress is Joy and she was sincere, nice and extremely thoughtful. Knowing we are celebrating a birthday, she arranged for a birthday card and a polaroid picture - I was very touched and very happy. Highly recommended to enjoy a nice weekend meal here!"
Dinner,"This was my second visit back to the restaurant within 2 months. First visit was to attend my nephew's wedding and most recently was dinner with friends. Food is fabulous but service was a little underwhelming. They served 5 bowls of spoons, whilst short of 2 which didn't come till we asked.
After table was cleared for desserts, the waiter did not bother to clean up the little spills till prompted."
Bff birthday celebration at Empress,Great ambience (dim lights) as their staff are attentive n helpful. Their food are yummy n gd selection for small eaters too. Will b better if it could be cooler inside their restaurant. Gd place for couples or any celebration for friends/ family.
Anniversary Dinner,"Food was excellent had 6 course and it was very very filling. 5 course option may have been just right. Service was great. Staff was young, energetic, and the one who served us had a good sense of humour."
Cozy,Surprisingly cozy and airy at the same time. Great place to enjoy a relaxed meal and a conversation right by the river. Can have a nice stroll afterwards and enjoy the view.
Birthday dinner,"Love love loved the service! Dumplings were amazing. Staff were amazing. Menu was so good.
Honestly it was just so good, where you feel quite taken care of. The staff was so knowledgeable, explaining the diff things- being patient with letting us order at our pace. Giving good advice and not just tr6luing to sell. Always nearby and yet not creepy close. Food was so good . We ate a LOt for 2 ppl I think. Lol. Also we were given a complimentary dessert since it was my husbands birthday. Very nice touch.
At the end the staff also look a Polaroid picture of us and gave it to us in a card. Very nice touch!

We had a great time. I always love the service at all of Prive group restaurants. Also love the rustic decor and the whole vibe. Everything feels eco friendly (atleast to the exten possible) which makes me feel good too.

Had been trying to get a reservation for months and it was always booked. I'm glad we saved it for the right occasion. Was very good."
Birthday Disaster,"If I could give negative stars, I totally would. I came here for a birthday dinner with family and ordered a bunch of food and there was not one item on the menu I enjoyed eating including gyozos, soups, cod fish . My family was disappointed and I was extremely sad. It would be different if I would come on a regular day, I came here for a special occasion dinner among the many options to eat in Singapore and I was extremely disappointed. I walked away even before they could serve me complimentary dessert. I refused to experiment with food anything more. I also sat outdoors. The food served was cold and tasteless. I still ended up paying for my dinner :( I would not recommend anyone go to the restaurant."
Nice venue,Nice venue and hostess who very warmly welcomed us to the restaurant. Food was mostly good except for the ha gao! Maybe it‚Äôs because we ordered a la carte and the items were prepared in such that the prawns were much more skimpy for the majority of people going for the buffet.
Wonderful experience,"Had eveeything on the evening dim sum menu n they are all yummy . Impeccable service, beautiful setting. A very comfortable n relax ambience for catching up with friends or loved ones. Highly recommended"
Great dining experience,Food was great and superb service!! Staff was really warm and friendly too. Will recommend for a chill and relaxing dining experience.
Birthday dinner.,The restaurant has a nice ambience by the river with the city overlooking it. Its located in the Ancient Civilization Museum which makes the setting very charming. The food though was ok. Some items very good but some lacked taste. The kung bao cauliflower was just too spicy and not the right balance. It felt like steamed cauliflower with a pungent sauce. The impossible gyoza and dumplings were good but the kwayteow was difficult to finish. It was also expensive.
Bad experience with food allergy,"We went with a group of friends and placed our order with the waitress. When doing so I me ruined at least three times that one of the guests had a shell fish allergy. I specifically said to mention this to the chef and the kitchen to ensure that the dishes didn‚Äôt have any shellfish.

When we recovers the dishes, my friend served himself to some vegetables. When taking his first bite he noticed that something was wrong. Luckily he saw the small shrimps in the dish and ran to the bathroom. The menu had no mention of shrimps. My friend didn‚Äôt touch anything for the rest of the evening.

Such sloppiness and non-understanding can end up dangerous."
Great service & amazing view!!,"Visited on Thursday evening with my girlfriends for a birthday celebration. Was served by Jonathan (we hope we got his name right, as we just overheard someone calling him. Tall Chinese guy wearing specs). His service was really immaculate and he even injects his own personality while serving, cracking jokes throughout the night. It was really a breath of fresh air. He even showed concern to his colleague when something happened and it just shows how genuinely caring he is, not just to the customers.

Though, the food is forgettable, the service and view of the Singapore night skyline really made up for the overall experience. I think the best dish for that night would be the char siew puff. Buttery pastry with the right texture for the char siew. Also, wished they had chili oil/ XO chili sauce for dipping or mixing into my fried rice. They only had chili padi or the western type of chili sauce.

Oh, the scallops with XO sauce & asparagus was really yummy too! Well seasoned and cooked to perfection. Will visit again, not for the food though, but for the service and view."
Nice food and customer service,"Had the vegetarian set meal. The vegetarian peking duck was very much alike to the real peking duck, worth to give it a try. Customer service was great as well. There is a photo taken by the restaurant and you get to bring it home. They also provided a piece of cake for the birthday celebrant. Overall a fantastic visit, just that portions a bit small."
Good Review of service at Empress,"Joy was very attentive and provided good service. She was also observant and sensitive to the needs of the customers. The service at Empress has always generally been good and consistent being my third time patronizing the place. Even though many opted for their set menu where fine dining service is required, their team will always make sure that they serve the dishes promptly and clear used plates while giving customers the privacy they need while dining. Place is also kept clean and has a good atmosphere :) I see that many like to hold their celebrations there as they have a nice touch of a personalised birthday cake and polaroid photo for guests to bring back. Good service in the F&B industry is hard to come by and Empress has done a great job in its staff training and branding :)"
Great restaurant for contemporary Cantonese cuisine,Great service and super underrated Cantonese cuisine. Dishes served have their own creative flair without sacrificing quality
Would return for Vegan dim sum,"Jonathan and team arranged for a cake for my friend's birthday celebration, we had a great nice evening thank you so much,"
Wonderful evening at The Empress,"Really enjoyed the food there. Had half peking duck, dimsum platter, seafood spinach beancurd and 2 desserts. Was really surprised by the staff with a complimentary dessert and a polaroid photo as is our anniversary that day. Really love the ambience there especially in the night looking across the river and skyscrapers. Would come back again next time."
Dinner,"Prefect location for a sunset dinner experience by the Singapore River. Food is amazing as always, the set dinner gives a variety of food to try out. The impossible gyoza is a definitely must try!"
"If you're looking for an intimate wedding with delicious food and great service, this is it (:","We just had our wedding event at Empress on 27 Feb (: The planning process was tiring for us but Bryan and the events team handled it well despite the venue being very busy during the CNY period.

The entire event went smoothly and the staff were friendly and attentive to the needs to both indoors and outdoors. Some of our relatives even asked if they were our friends! It was a tiring day for them but they've continued to serve every table's needs and also assisted a lot with other wedding items like tea ceremony, grabbing photos, providing directions in and out. The covid 19 restrictions made things tougher, but the Empress team was accommodating and made us felt at ease.

Food was pretty delicious! Even better than several hotels I've been to; it was served hot, is visually appealing, and definitely tasty and filling to leave the guests satisfied. While it is very similar to a typical traditional chinese banquet, the food at Empress has a modern twist. We especially loved the dessert (sticky date!) and our vegetarian guests felt very pampered too (:

Atmosphere wise, the ambience was elegant and intimate and it was great for pictures without much decor effort. The only downside is perhaps that it could get really hot in the afternoon for the outdoor guests but they did provide fans and recently, air coolers too to ease the heat! Venue can be a little tricky to find for the elder folks so do prep some directions or guides for navigating them here :)

Thank you team for the hard work!"
You get all 3 important factors in one restaurant,"Beautiful restaurant, attentive service staff and most important the food is delicious.

We had CNY set menu, quality of ingredients is great, serving is generous for the price we‚Äôve paid.

Spotted the men in white shirt ( Manager ?) walk around to make sure dirty plates being cleared, drinks being refilled, etc. This small action made very enjoyable dining experience."
Try this vegetarian CNY set lunch,"This is the second year that we have tried their vegetarian Chinese New Year set lunch. Once again, we were not disappointed. This year, the restaurant incorporated Impossible Beef into its offerings, and we loved every item on the menu, from the starter platter (steamed mushroom and corn dumplings, Empress Char Siew, Wok-charred Broccoli & Brocollini) to an interesting interpretation of cold Burbur Cha Cha for dessert (one could also opt for the Sticky Date Pudding with Ice-cream). We will be back!"
"Good service, good food","- Very attentive service staff - Great dimsum, soup and desserts - Mains were bad (trio platter meats were hard, roast duck was bland, salted egg prawns were too salty) - 68++/pax too pricey"
"Not impressed with Empress, Overrated","Prior to our visit to Empress, we had really high expectations of the food at the restaurant given the tons of good reviews that it had received. My fianc√© and I even wanted to hold our wedding banquet here as we thought that the ambience and food were nice. HOWEVER, it was such a disappointment!
Ordered the sharing set menu for two and we find that the standard of the food were just average. The triple roast platter was a huge disappointment despite it being one of the top 10 dishes that it‚Äôs recommended by the restaurant - Charsiew was tough and seemed to be overcooked, Roast pork was fatty and bland, Pork ribs were unpalatable. P.S. I feel that even the hawker centre standards are way better than the ones at Empress Lol. The rest of the dishes are just SO SO, nothing special to rave about. The service was okay though. I indicated in my booking that it was meant to be a Anniversary celebration dinner and the staff gave us a dessert - Pandan panecotta(?) for free which I thought that it was a nice gesture. But it didn‚Äôt taste nice also, it was too ‚Äújelat‚Äù and creamy for our liking. Overall, we will not visit again as the quality of the food is not worth the value. We were so disappointed with the food here. thank god that we decided to head down to the restaurant to try and ‚Äúverify‚Äù the food and reviews first before proceeding to book the restaurant for our wedding banquet."
Chinese New Year Reunion dinner,"This is not our first visit to Empress.
However this was the first time we had Chinese Nee year reunion dinner with Empress, we are disappointed with the Chinese New Year set menu (Dinner).

The presentation has to be improved and the portion of the triple roast and duck were not presentable for such occasion event, 1 pc of mini roasted meat each guest when you charge $108++ each guest.

We are very disappointed with the messed-up pre made arrangement for 1 guest Gluten-free CYN set meal. As I was being told before early reservation that the chef has a special gluten free CYN set menu (I even kept the menu soft cpy given by the restaurant). But ended up we were being told there is no gluten-free CYN menu available.
Ended up with no choice he has to order from regular Gluten-free menu for our family reunion dinner.

However, severs were helpful and friendly.

The call-in hotline can never ever get through; no one will ever answer the call. I tried calling to make reservations for a few days!
Since I can‚Äôt get anyone the answer, we used Choppe application for reservation, BUT the restaurant system did not have any records.
But we still received email confirmation for our bookings.

It was a mess for our family‚Äôs reunion dinner last evening.

I hope to feedback to the management.
The worst experience we had for a family reunion dinner."
Excellent food and Service,"Service- Excellent. The service staff went above and beyond expectation. No lack of attention on details of their customers. Offered a cake for my wife when they found out it‚Äôs her birthday. Lovely gesture.

Food- Deliciously cooked and well presented. Comparable to a Michelin star restaurant. I am very impressed with the quality of food served."
This became one of my favourite dim sum places in Singapore!,"The atmosphere was lovely- modern chinese/ cantonese cuisine. Set across from boat quay. Short walk across the bridge from Maybank towers and fullerton hotel. The menu was extensive. We had lunch here. Two opted for 3 course executive set lunches . I had the

PLANT-BASED
DIM SUM PLATTER (4pc) (Vegetarian) Pan-Fried ImpossibleTM Gyoza, Deep-Fried Vegetable Spring Roll, Sichuan Steamed Plant-Based Meat Dumpling, Vegetable dumpling

EMPRESS DIM SUM PLATTER (5pc) (Had
Pork in it)
Har Gau, Siew Mai,
Seafood & Spinach Dumpling, Steamed Shanghai Soup Dumpling, Mushroom & Corn Dumpling

Beautiful presentation! Staff service was polite and helpful ."
Solid modern Chinese food,"A beautiful setting overlooking Boat Quay, and very attentive and pleasant staff make this restaurant a great go to for Modern Chinese food. They have a great range of veg options too - serving impossible dumplings, stir fries, etc. Would have only liked for the food to be more staggered so that the evening was elongated...felt a little rushed with waiters coming to clear everything every couple of mins."
"Great food, great ambience","I always bring friends to Empress when I want a relaxing, sophisticated and intimate setting. I love the food and service is always amazing"
"Great atmosphere, great food",I'm a vegetarian whilst my girlfriend is not. We both love the food and the atmosphere was really classy as it sets up the mood for our evening really well.
Nice embience good Service,This is a nice place to dine. Food is pretty good. No shelter if u are caught in the rain like I did good luck. Was there to celebrate a friend's bday. Line was hard to get through when I called a day earlier to make sure they prepared a cake for my friend. Jonathan was extremely helpful n Gave great service. Happy to find young service staff these days this enthusiastic n takes pride in his work. Would recommend this place
Nice setting,"Located along Singapore River, it's one prime location both for tourists and locals. With Covid 19, the atmosphere was dampened. Restaurant was not crowded but decently booked for indoor and outdoor dining. It also has a full bar service some may prefer. Food was average and it's the peaceful setting that the restaurant excels. A nice place to mingle with friends."
Amazing food and great service!,We came for dinner last Friday evening to celebrate my husband's birthday. We ordered new dishes that we never tried before - the food was served very quickly and they exceeded our expectations. The service was great and they were aware when we needed any water top-ups. Will visit again.
"Good food, service oriented, vegan choice","Was there yesterday with a friend for vegan dim sum brunch the food was awesome especially the Impossible Gyoza! A must to order.

Was served by Jonathan he is very service oriented, very meticulous as he knows we are vegetarian he even check with us if we can take garlic which is a plus point making our dining a pleasant experience. Thank you very much!"
Enjoyable chinese food,"We went to Empress to celebrate my mother's birthday and enjoyed ourselves. Did not manage to make reservations online but the restaurant found us a slot after sending them an email. We went for lunch and ordered from the ala cart menu, which included dim sum dishes. A few standout dishes were the peking duck, steamed seafood and spinach dumpling, and stir-fried king seafood hor fun. Dessert was quite interesting, and the restaurant managed to find a candle to put on the dessert for our celebration. Service could be a bit faster, but was not too big a deal."
Chinese restaurant in western style,"The food was all on standard (although I was more impressed by the banquet food previously). The Heng Hua Bee Hoon was really good. The service staff were generally well trained and polite. just one note on the ""urgency"" to keep the plates. Can be slightly more relaxed. We were there to celebrate anniversary and the restaurant was kind enough to offer free dessert and take a polaroid photo for us. Thank you!"
Poor service and food,"Booked a table thru Chope and stated a indoor seat but get a outdoor table instead without any advance notice. The worst the dinning table was not a proper dinning table and have a ceiling blowing to us directly.
Request to off the fan but rejected than request to change table but the staff raise his tone to my friend.
Having the vegetarian brunch menu
The food was average not value for money.
Definitely not visit Empress in the future, shame for Prive group"
World Class Experience,"absolutely loved the ambience of this place, modern and classy. service was also was top notch. the staff at empress were so attentive and constantly looking out for us and seeing if we needed anything. one of their male staff also joked around with my family and that absolutely made our night. the taste and quality of their food and drinks were just excellent. i would definitely highly recommend this place to everyone."
Excellent service and food,We had a 5 course sharing menu which was very nice food and great value for money. The view is awesome and the service excellent. Highly recommended!
Lunch at Empress,At Empress we experienced a lovely ambience and good food to make our lunch totally enjoyable. We are vegetarian and as such we were pleasantly surprised to find so many delightfully presented vegetarian dishes. We chose one 3 course meal and alacarte for the rest of us and we had enough to eat from the choices that were available.
"Very nice location, service perfect","Very relaxing atmosphere with perfect service team and good food. You can directly sit on Singapore River, so good view as well."
Food and service are both fabulous!,Had the imperial set lunch and it was really good. Was served by Yao Ming who was attentive and friendly!
