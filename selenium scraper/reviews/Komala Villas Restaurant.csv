Poor Service,The cahier guy started to grumble when there was some issue with the ordering of food! He is the one down there most of the time! Stressed maybe but cannot show anger towards the customer.
Superb take away - so much food!,"Got a few dishes to take back to the hotel. Freshly cooked wonderfood - and so much of it! The meal was delicious and were it not for the queue outside, I'd have gone back for another meal that night"
Still good over the years,"Old school and authentic - Always the best over the years for smaller bites and thosais etc; though maybe can get better biryani at some others, but still decent. Really just the best i feel, and get some sweets and vadai after too."
Authentic south indian food,"I had my dinner in this restaurant. I had ordered for a paper masala dosa and filter coffee. The food was excellent, ambiance is just alright."
Brilliant vegetarian food,"Visited this restaurant twice - dinner and lunch during our honeymoon in Singapore. Easy to find on the main road and a short trip from the MRT. Very good value as our 2 mains came to less than 20 dollars.

Would definitely recommend if you like authentic Indian vegetarian food- you will have to queue and it’s popular with the locals too :)"
Komala no more,We have been visiting Singapore for over 25 years and always pop into this restaurant. Previous visits have been great and it's been a marvel to see the changes over the years. However this time round we were appalled by the service and the quality of the food. Our food arrived cold. The curries and sambols tasteless. The waiter even forgot our drinks. Take our advice and go to Tekka centre and look for the Sri Lankan and Appam food counter. You will not be disappointed and will even save yourself some money.
Very bad service by new staff members,"As a Singaporean who has patronized Komala Vila for generations, I am proud that it is one of our Heritage eateries. It has weathered the test of time and continues to provide high-quality meals even while other restaurants have sprouted, prospered, and vanished. I'm submitting this review as a fan of the restaurant who hopes to see Komala Vilas maintain its high standards in terms of food quality and service. I've seen a reduction in service quality in Komala Vilas, which I believe is due to the recent hiring of some new workers.
To emphasize my issue, I'd want to expound on an incident I experienced on, June 11, 2022 at 5.30 p.m. I was getting Thayir vadai to go from the cashier, who graciously instructed me to wait while my order was parceled. She then directed the parceling of the Thayir vadai to a little female standing at the door with a name that sounded like Alisha.
Despite the remark, the tiny girl continued to stand at the entryway.
Following that, the cashier became preoccupied with managing the orders, flitting between the sweet/thayir vadai section and checking on the ready takeaway orders.
It was a busy evening at the restaurant, and I could tell the cashier was doing her best to juggle many responsibilities. The tiny girl strolled over to the sweet counter after a few times of the cashier calling out to her, to have a pleasant conversation with a European couple who were looking at the sweets. They hadn't made up their minds yet. She then moved on to another European couple seated in the far end corner, with whom she was having another informal conversation.
It became clear to me that this female was attempting to avoid any task involving parceling food or checking take-out meal orders, preferring instead to network with customers and strike up informal discussions.
Finally, exasperated, the cashier packed the thayir vada for me. I felt sad for the cashier and could relate to her situation. I'm astonished that such restaurant worker service behavior is tolerated in Komala Vilas, and I'd like to propose that the management use their CCtv cameras to monitor how the service employees perform throughout the day. This will ensure that such employees are identified, admonished, and, if necessary, terminated in order to maintain Komala Vilas standards. I must say, I've received excellent service in the past from a North Indian lady who stands at the entryway, but she wasn't there when I went yesterday.

Here is a photo of a more pleasent time when I had the same item in the restaurant"
Nice vegetarian meal,"Visited this restaurant today for lunch. There was a queue outside the restaurant. If you have a rice meal you go up the stairs to an air-conditioned area otherwise you sit downstairs that has a longer queue. The masala thosai meal came with three vegetables and four chutneys.
The idling mea also was also delicious. I always visit this restaurant when visiting Singapore"
Good old restaurant,"Usually packed and glad only vaccinated guests are allowed to dine in. Thosai meal was great. Fish mocked curry was good. Prata was not something, I was expecting. Brew coffee with fresh milk was really good."
Mother of all dosai’s,"The mother of all dosai’s, arguably can be chowed down at Komala Vilas. Perfectly thin and crispy rice dosai with 3 deeply-flavoured vegetables and a techni-coloured line-up of dips make this such a satisfying meal. Palak paneer is so rich, it’s such lip-smacking finger-rolling delight dipping your dosai in there. Archaic Interior harks back to the yesteryears. Only the NETS machine is the only new. #eatstylishtravelstylish"
chanced upon,we had a staycation nearby this area and chanced about this restaurant. very good vegetarian indian food. skeptical at 1st (the restaurant looks very old) but like they say do not judge a book by its cover. they do delivery too!
[Hungry Lah!] Eating in the OLDEST Indian Vegetarian Restaurant in Singapore,"Deepavli just ended last month.

We visited one of the best Indian Vegetarian restaurant and the oldest vegetarian restaurants in Singapore. Komala Vilas located in Little India Singapore was opened on 1947. They have kept the food traditions from Tanjore District, Tamil Nadu, South India. When you stepped into the restaurant, it will be like stepping back in time. It is a family run business. The restaurant was also visited by many dignitaries.

We ordered: 1) Thosai set meal ($9.50): it was a huge meal and very filling 2) Coriander Masala Thosai ($6.50): spicy and delicious 3) Indian coffee and masala tea (around $2)"
Single n Casual Dressed Diners Are Ignored!,"I arrived at the restaurant and was told to queue by Dimple (hostess) and right infront of me a couple walked in, check in, checked temperature and was guided to their table. When i asked Dimple, i was told that they came much earlier than me. The couple walk in infront of me and did registration as they just arrived. Fine, i was okay with it as i dont mind waiting as i was not in hurry but as time passes by i became invisible to Dimple standing right infront of me. The lady from the counter, direct to 2nd level for table.
The food and the ambience is nice. The place is clean and you are not rushed to vacate the table for new diners.
Im dissappointed with Dimple's customer handling skills. I will definitely return to try their other dishes."
Excellent food in an old & chaotic restaurant,"Located in the middle of Little India, there's often a queue as it's very popular. The restaurant is quiet basic & old, with friendly & helpful staff, if a little chaotic. The food is excellent, spicy & flavoursome."
value for money,"tried plain/ cheese naan, paneer butter curry, and fried cauliflowers (don't remember the exact name,but this tastes really good!) The total bill is approx.20 SGD. Overall, the taste is good for the cost. If you are looking for cheap eat, I would recommend this place."
Authentic South Indian Restaurant,"The best place in Singapore if you want to try a proper South Indian unlimited vegetarian meals. Taste, quantity and quality were awesome. Service staff were so courteous and kind. Service was excellent. Must try if you are around this place."
Sheer Brilliance,"A legendary restaurant (not to be confused with Komalas, which is awesome in its own way), Komala Vilas has evolved with time but retains its character & charm. We've been to this eating house twice - the first time in 2000 & then again in 2019 and i can vouch their interiors hadn't changed (or aged) and we were taken aback, pleasantly, by the sheer quality & taste of their food.

Located in the Little-India, be prepared to wait in a queue for some time to get a seat here (and you'd still probably have to share the table), but once it all seems worth it - the smell of fresh filter coffee & masalas, the sight of fresh idlis and dosas make the wait worthwhile. Once the food is on your table, the joy increases multi-fold - esp. with their elaborate, sumptuous & filling, but yet incredibly healthy rice plate (served on a banana plantain leaf; my wife who generally isn't fond of set meals replaced her dosa order with a rice plate upon seeing mine). Even their South Indian snacks, the North Indian dishes, and hybrids such as Gobi Manchurian are brilliant.

All-in-all, this is an institution and their food (Indian) probably the best in the entire city-country"
Lunchtime visit,"Went today. Very tasty. You are seated but go up to the counter to order and pay. Wife had the biryani, which appeared almost immediately, it was delicious (and huge). i had the semolina dhosa, garlic nan and pea and aculiflower curry, again, all delicious. Highly recommended"
A haven for sweets,A haven for sweets ...only place for three kinds of ladoos...my personal favourite is the one with cashews though the jaggry one also quite good . Their Imartis and Balushahi also are good
Best butter Dosa,This place is absolutely should be on your list to visit if you like south indian food. I tried butter dosa. but even that simple plain butter dosa tasted really awesome.
Wonderful taste,I think people should come and try here. Coz the reviews only not enough to do the job. Simply wonderful. The taste of the food is marvellous.
"Good food, ambiance can be improved",Been going there since last 20 years..they have been consistent in their food& beverages. Overall decent south Indian food with few fusion items popped up recently.
Really delicious Indian food.,Really delicious Indian food. Enough vegan options! Recommendation for a proper meal. And it’s cheap.
Good food but served in plastics,"Disapprove of serving sauces and drinks in plastics: cup+lid(!)+straw(!) for eat-in option. Guys, aren't you really following global trends on the protection of environment?"
Favourite,"Great Indian food and well priced . Love the dosa, paper, naan, samosas. Been here many times and will always come back. Service is good, people complaining About ir haven’t been in many Indian restaurants in their lives"
"Good Food, Mediocre Service and Drab interiors","Food is good, but very old furniture which they need to change urgently. They would not provide us with their wifi password so we couldn't order a grab taxi. No taxi would stop for us outside their restaurant and we waited for over an hour, Finally, I spotted another Indian restaurant (Kailash Parbat) who's manager Amit gladly ordered a grab taxi for us."
GOOD VEGETARIAN FOOD IN FAST PACED ENVIRONMENT,"When you enter they ask are you there for snacks then you sit on ground floor. If your there for meals you go upstairs. As you enter upstairs quite hectic, people leaving and coming. They give you a menu and you need to order right there and pay. Then you get to sit,usually shared table. Food comes out like a thali plate with plenty of choices,hot, spicy and cooling. Worth the visit if your looking for quality vege foods. They have been around for many years."
Tasty vegetarian food,"I was advised by my Taxi driver to go to this wonderful south Indian vegetarian restaurant. Also, one of the few restaurants open early in the morning. They have seating on two levels. The service is prompt and friendly. They have a menu. I ordered standard idli plate and a paper dosa. The taste was authentic and coffee was pretty good too. The prices are pretty cheap here. The decor is not much to talk about. It is a restaurant you go to have a quick snack or meal and be done with."
Good food,Wanted vegetarian food so ended up here.Best choice ever.Loved the food and the friendly staff.Pretty busy at all times.
Good service,Very reasonably priced food and with good service as well. We just had couple of coffees to take away. Coffees were good and delivered with a smile. Will recommend this place to anyone visiting this area.
Food could be better,"I had Idly and Vadai for breakfast but the quality of food could be improved. Idly was not what I expected, sambar and chutney were mediocre."
Delightful eaterie still going strong 70+ years on,"Old is gold. A local friend suggested this place as I was craving veggie food. Delish South Indian curries served with the softest, melt in your mouth chapatis all fo 9 Singapore dollars. The place gets crowded around lunch times, be prepared to scoot up and share a table with strangers - there’s a blessing to be found in this! Authentic eaterie with the friendliest staff keeping this impressing heritage going, bringing people together through honest and delicious food. Wish they would open a branch in london!"
"Affordable, reliably good, vegetarian, Indian food","Finding a suitable place to eat in Little India can be a challenge, especially when many restaurants rely on unappetizing bain marie presentation. I've eaten at Komala Vilas (correct spelling) on several occasions and always found it good to excellent. In particular, I recommend Bhattura, Dosai Rawa or Dosai Masala."
Singapore holiday,We had early morning arrival in Singapore and reached hotel early so as our rooms were not ready we decided to go for breakfast. After searching on trip advisor we found this komala Vilas restaurant . We ordered masala dosas and idly both were delicious. Good place for breakfast.
Mr,"We visited this restaurant to have a masala tea
The tea was very nice , we looked the the menu and saw the food others were eating and decided to return for lunch.
When we returned we were very lucky to get a table .
The restaurant is very popular with the locals
We had a rice plate , it was rice with several dishes
All very different but very nice . Very cheap our dish was about $9 . Great local atmosphere .
Enjoy"
Go only if you need vegetarian food,"The place is located in Little India and is among many Indian vegetarian food outlets there. The food tastes good. Service is quick but average otherwise. Ambience is average. One should go for this only if one needs 100% vegetarian meal. For other vegetarians, who don't mind eating at outlets which also serve non vegetarian food, this isn't the best option."
Resting on its lorals,"Komala Vilas restaurant on Serangoon Road in Singapore has seen better days. I have been a guest at this well established and highly recommend restaurant for many years. Sadly it seems to be resting on its lorals so much so that I believe it is now lapsing into a deep coma.
The restaurant always used to look a little shabby, but that had its own charm. Now it looks grubby and unhygienic. The 'open plan ' sink area looked dirty and unloved. Hygiene wise the water containers on the table looked risky and threatened some form of water born contamination.
The menu is and always was basic. No problem with that. On this occasion many items were unavailable due to time related issues. Never the less once seated I plowed on. Eventually I managed to select item's available to me at that particular time of day.
The food was just.... OK. The vegetables all had an overpowering taste of cinnamon and very little else. The dosa was fine as was the presentation , but with so much good competition in little India it's about time that Komala Vilas spruced up the restaurant. A little home improvement would be welcome."
We Eat Here Every Time we are in Singapore,Delicious vegetarian Indian food. We come to this restaurant every time we are in Singapore and are never disappointed. The food is delicious!
Working around little india - SG,"Looks like a very authentic place, full of locals (indians) inside, so it's always a good choice. The food was amazing, all based on veggies but soooo tasty I couldn't believe."
Average,"We had one night only in Singapore and had this place recommended. Food is ok, good value but not special. We ordered lots of dishes. Shared a table with some people which was fun. Service is great. Wouldn’t say you have to try it though"
Wonderful Indian food.,If you are staying near little India and want to have a good Indian food then this is the best choice. Very good for breakfast lunch and dinner too. give a perfect homely feeling of having a good food back in India.
Great Vegetarian Indian food,"The meals are delicious, very popular so be prepared to line up for a table, well worth the wait ...."
Authentic Banana Leaf Traditional South Indian Veg Food,"This restaurant has been running for many decades. As far as I know, my family and I have been patronising this simple shop for the last fifty years. It serves snacks and tiffin dishes on the lower floor and lunches and dinner meals upstairs. Though the prices have gradually escalated to meet the increasing cost of ingredients and labour cost, food quality has never been compromised. The second generation is running the restaurant chain locally and overseas. Its a food haven for vegans and vegetarians. For vegans, a small note: please ask the staff which products has milk so you may wish to omit."
Indian food in Singapore,Typical south Indian foods with north Indian dishes also. Neat ambience and faster serving. food is tasty and delicious
Awesome South Indian Cuisine!,"Komala Villas Restaurant located on the Serangoon Road serves mouth watering South Indian cuisine which is a treat for any visitor. We enjoyed a perfect dinner with family on a Sunday. The place was crowded and we managed a table after a wait of 20 minutes. We ordered Dahi Vada, Masala Dosa, Filter Coffee and Rosemilk and we thoroughly enjoyed the dishes. They were perfectly cooked and not too spicy. They also serve a variety of Dosas, Idly, Upma, Pongal, Sweets etc. The staff were friendly and helpful. Service was prompt."
Great Indian food in Singapore,"Probably the best South Indian food outside India! Great value, always fresh and tasty. Service is prompt and friendly. Try to sit upstairs as it is a bit quieter."
Reasonable Priced Food & Service,"Reasonable service & there is a variety of Food to order from. Both Restaurants has been upgraded over the years but within a few months, it looks tired again with the heavy patronage!

Average 5 to 10mins wait for food to be delivered (depending on what you Ordered & the Crowd situation). Sitting can be challenging during peak hours and be ready to share your table if there are vacant seats available!

Have been patronising their outlets for the past 45 years and on average, 2 to 3 visits per week for the last 20 years when I become a semi-vegetarian.

Hoping they will add a few small rice dishes with 2 to 3 side curries to choice from besides their standard Rice Set Meal which can be overwhelming if you are not that hungry!

Will definitely return as the food quality has been maintained over the years & prices adjusted accordingly."
Excelllent indian food,"This little place is a bit of a institution in and around little india. small place with a old world charm. the food is amazing. must try their dosa,idly and pongal. very affordable compared to singapore standards. the owners are very friendly and even Prime Minister Modi had his meeting with his singapore counterpart here so it speaks volume about this place. its been around for 60+ years and still going strong."
Cikgu Latta,"I've been going to this place whenever I find myself in Singapore for 40 years. Introduced my kids to South Indian food when each was just 10 and they both loved it right away. Dosa and paper dosa both great, but try out their onion dosa as well. Or idli if you are looking for something a little different. Don't forget to get tea as well; pour it from cup to cup for your own teh tarik. After 5:30 go upstairs for the rice plate on banana leaf for a filling dinner. You can't go wrong at Komala Vilas."
Delicious dosa,"Nice and clean place with air conditioner, friendly staff, good service and the best cone dosa I have ever tried.
The only problem is that it is very crowd and you may need to share your table with some strangers. It is better to avoid 12 to 1 pm.
But still worth it!"
Average food,"We went there based on recommendations in TripAdvisor and elsewhere, but were somewhat disappointed. The food was ok, but not great. You can get better tasting vegetarian food e.g. in Newton hawker centre. Prices are low and the staff was very friendly, but I must admit that the cockroach running on the floor did not improve the experience. It was obviously a surprise also for the staff as they tried to catch the cockroach, which escaped under the furniture."
Superb,Amazing food! We ordered South Indian meals. I didn’t expect it to be the level of amazing that it was. Very happy.
FANTASTIC,"Veg restaurant with great local food around little India. Although outside it is not the most modern and cool place, you just have to see the line of people waiting for a table to know that it will be worth it.
Congrats for such a authentic place where food is the most important.
धन्यवाद"
"Great value, friendly service and lovely atmosphere","Guided by the TripAdvisor review we ventured to try this modest establishment. Busy for very good reasons. Food was lovely, servings were generous and the place, as were its clientele, unpretentious and down to earth. If decor matters to you, maybe this isn't the place to go. But if you want something reminiscent of its Indian roots, treat yourself to a wonderful experience. Highly recommended."
"""Average food,crowded,cleanliness must be improved""","Went for breakfast at his place with mum,place is really crowded at all times.Meals are average and nothing to shout about.

Overall the sink and floors have to be cleaned up.Still worth eating here as meals are served hot and fresh and cow milk bru coffee is simply the best."
Really authentic food,"It would be all too easy to overlook this restaurant but it serves wonderful vegetarian food in a really down to earth setting. Clearly popular with locals and always busy. Portions are really generous and curries taste just like my mum used to make !
Can recommend the North and South Indian meal deals and the samosa.
Unbelievably cheap to boot."
South of India in all of Singapore!,"One of the most fantastic food joints for delectable South Indian Food. If you enjoy authentic food, do pay a visit here.."
"Authentic, tasty, amazing value","Took my mum here whilst on holiday as I heard it was good for Authentic South Indian Cuisine. WOW! The dosa was delicious, we also had Palak Paneer and Mattar Paneer, both were perfection.

Serving sizes were generous and the food was so reasonably priced I will be sure to head back every single visit to Singpore from now on."
Excellent Veg option in Little India,"If you are a South Indian travelling to Singapore and staying in Little India and you are a vegetarian, then this is a very good restaurant option. The hotel is close to the Veerammakali Temple on Serangoon road, Little India. Service is quick. Food was tasty and of good quality. The restaurant is in demand and during tourist season, almost all the tables are occupied. Staff are friendly. Recommended. There is an AC hall while most of the guests occupy the non AC in the ground floor"
More than five stars!,It just doesn’t get more authentic! The flavors transport you to Mylapore instantly. The thalis were excellent and unlimited. The poondu kuzhambu was outstanding. The paper dosas were delicious and even my picky eaters ordered seconds! A family of five could easily have a scrumptious lunch for under 30sing$. The best Indian food ever period !!
Komala Vilas Restaurant,"A gem in the heart of Little India. A restaurant which opened its doors in 1947. Also, was mentioned in the Lonely Planet books way before we had insta blogs / travel apps. Value for money food and quick service. It may not be the best in ambience, but it makes for it by being a wallet friendly place which serves tasty South Indian food.

Our favourite is the unlimited vegetarian thali at sgd 9. We have paid sgd 6.50 for the same when we landed in Singapore. The price with inflation has increased but the quality of food has been maintained. The vegetables change every day. After so many years we know our favourite day is Sunday . The portions are extremely generous and we normally ask for half rice and then take more if needed so as to avoid wastage.

The dosa and idli varieties are tasty. The mini idli sambhar is small baby Idli’s swimming in a pool of sambhar and ghee.

Strongly recommend a visit to this restaurant. The fact that the Singaporean PM took the Indian PM there for a meal says a lot about its age old quality."
south indian restaurant,south indian restaurant. masala dosa and also north indian food really good quality. they also provide different variety like paav bhaji and chole bhature. quality also good.
Great South Indian Food,Did the dosa making class here. It was great fun and I'll definitely make dosas when I'm at home. Came back for dinner later and had masala dosa and masala chai. The chai here is amazing.
Budget friendly,"We were here for breakfast on our first day in Singapore. It’s old , but the place has a charm to it. Moderately priced food, wallet friendly. Food could have been better, but no complaints. Recommend this place when on a budget and convenient if you are touring Hindu temples and Buddhist shrines around Farrer Park MRT."
A real institution,"Komala Vilas is the oldest and still one of the best South Indian vegetarian restaurants, notwithstanding the arrival in recent years of chains from India. The dosai meal, combining three vegetable dishes (different everyday)with a paper dosai, is my personal favourite."
South India in Singapore,"Komala Vilas was a perfect place for Indian to have South Indian food. The chutneys were amazing with the hot, crispy, crunchy and tasty dosa. The food was delicious and although the environment and ambience was not good, a person will have a joyful meal. The curry was mouth watering and spicy, it became irresistible to not have one more. There is a magic in the food that gives a whirpool of happiness in your stomach. The staff was courteous and friendly. I would fully recommend this for South Indian food lovers."
My Break fast choice in singapore,"I had been visiting Singapore since 1997 and almost continuously my stay will always be in the close vicinity of Little india as I am very choosy about my break fast until otherwise have to be in some hotel with colleagues, The food reminds of India and the thanjavur belt type of Sambar and crispy Vada, Pongal and dosa are good , however compared to other veggie joints is slightly more priced, but worth the money for singagpore."
GET PREPARED TO WAIT OUTSIDE IN QUEUE,"Good South Indian Food. Opens early in the morning, earlier than other neighbouring eateries. and that suited us. The service was ok, nothing exceptional. But one has to be prepared to wait, as it is always crowded."
Nice South Indian Food,"Variety of south Indian as well as Punjabi dishes, Nice taste, Value for money, Too crowded, Overall nice hotel for lunch, dinner and breakfast. Must try Masala Tea"
Still bad service -- customers have to wait and watch seated customers eating...,"I had a breakfast appointment with someone. All the tables were taken and my friend realizing that there was an upper floor, and was thus on the verge of going upstairs, beckoned to me ""...let's go upstairs there should be more tables free upstairs..."" . As I followed him, we were stopped by a male waiter who said we could sit at another already occupied table. There was a person already seated at that table..

I had never shared a table with a stranger and was not ready for that. I asked my friend if he would not mind to which my friend said that the waiter has suggested that we sit alongside the man. The man said ""it's OK!"" My friend suggested that perhaps we should have PURI -- see picture. I agreed. We also ordered tea.

More people came into the restaurant and they were not allowed to go upstairs. They all stood outside or alongside the wall, and to the right of the payment counter, away from the entrance, watching our backs and the faces of those facing them. Not a nice experience at all, being watched! I cannot understand why the upper floor was not being used when there were so many waiting customers. Perhaps it is the Komala Vilas logic.

I turned around to look back at waiting customers behind us as my friend facing them suggested that we hurry up. I counted seven people of whom were two children.

Tea was delivered first. Then, after a wait of about 8 -10 minutes the Puri we each ordered was delivered on steel plates with recesses holding two sauces. We asked the male waiter for cutlery and they were delivered wrapped in some flimsy obviously low-quality tissue paper, to serve as servette. The cutlery consisted of a fork and a spoon... we would rather that the spoon was replaced with a knife and then cutting would have been much easier than trying to tear up the PURI with the spoon.

The PURI was not unacceptable in taste, but one of the ""chutneys"" was really piquant - see the red-coloured sauce on the right of the picture. The PURI while appearing to look like an interesting bloated flour ball cooked in oil, was rather bland in taste if I am honest.. The yellow-coloured sauce lifted the flavour a little but the red sauce did the opposite rendering the puri spicy and too hot on the tongue and mouth.

I doubt if I will ever order a PURI again, and much less taste the red-coloured sauce if I should ever visit an Indian restaurant or eatery.

Komala Vilas continues to provide unsatisfactory service -- it will never change -- bad customer service is in its genes. Great pity indeed!"
Excellent South Indian food,"Excellent South Indian food available as early as 7am!! During my stay of 6 days, had breakfast on all six days. You will never feel out of place. Very well maintained restaurant with no compromise on taste. Food for five would cost within SGD 40. Do not miss to drop in when you are in Singapore"
Awesome South Indian Food,We visited this place for dinner and they had all the south indian options available. We tried full meals and it was too good. It was Indian taste in Singapore
Great Dosai and Masala Chai,This is a great place for a quick brunch of Dosai and Masala chai or a more substantial meal. If it's busy you may need to share a table but that's all part of the fun. One of our favourite places to eat in Singapore.
Necessary return,Great food - a must for future visits to Singapore and Little India. The set meals can help take the guesswork out of ordering.
Authentic Veg Indian Brilliant Food,"What a great experience.

This place has to be seen to be believed.

For vegetarian Indian lovers like us this place was brilliant.

Always packed out, tables are turned over every 30 minutes. It’s incredible how busy the place was. Which meant we new the food was going to be good.

Someone from our hotel recommended the place. Situated in the heart of little Indian we are here twice during our recent stay in Singapore.

Both times we had the same dish which was rice with paneer and a paratha. Everything was tasty, very good quality. Service was brilliant and food came super quickly.

And best of all the place is super cheap. By Singapore standards that is.

Will definitely be back on my next visit to Singapore.

This place deserves to do well."
"Dirty wash basin, crowded",I had food thrice here. Very dirty place. Crowded. Much hyped. Wash basin in the second floor looks terrible and the hotel management does not care. You cannot eat food after seeing the wash basin. A slight for Indians. Toilet is inside the kitchen which is totally wrong. A big thumbs down. I can see many first timers feel unhappy. I will never go again.
Delicious,"They offered us a seat upstairs but we opted for the street level. It was very busy but worth the bussle for the food and atmosphere. The food was delicious and affordable only $4 a plate. I wish I’d found it sooner in my trip.
Must try!"
Best South Indian in Singapore,Very basic restaurant. Home cooked food. Best South Indian in Singapore. Have been visiting for last 9 years and will continue to do so.
Great food at affordable price,"Four of us had lunch here for SGD33 and it's one of the best meals we've had without doubt.

We had 4 Mains, 3 starters & 3 comes and we couldn't finish it all.

We had 3 Masala Dosai, 1 Mysore Masala Dosai, 1 Kotho Parotta, onion bajji, Samosa set, all were extremely tasty and all cooked fresh.

I've never eaten in a Vegetarian Restaurant before and I have to say (being a devout meat eater) I would do it again.

Eating with your fingers was quite refreshing in a funny sort of way.

Service was very prompt and good.

Please don't be misled by popping your head in and thinking 'mmmm' I'll give that a miss, if you do your missing something very special."
Simple but effective,"@TheKuoKnows

You must be doing something right if you have been around for 70 years. And Komala Villas gets most things right.

Don’t expect silver service because that is not what this place is about. Instead, it is about a taste of South Indian vegetarian food at its simplest.

The Dosas are outstanding. I had mine with Palak Paneer, which was beautifully prepared. I mopped up every last drop.

The table arrangements are cosily arranged. Great if you don’t mind socialising with adjacent diners....

.... In fact, my dosa encroached on someone else’s table. I’m comfortable with that. But not everyone might.

Fantastic place for a taste of South India."
Deliciously flavourful,"The food was incredible and amazingly priced we both got a set meal which was way too much for me but I wanted to try a bit of everything so it worked.

It was a little hectic with a few too many people standing around but part from that I would definitely recommend."
Homely food,Visited for lunch today Very good South Indian food Suggest that quantity should be little reduced and price also marginally It will help wastage of food & money both
Disappointing,"Having read such positive reviews, we were keen to have lunch there on a visit to Little India but sadly left disappointed. Both my husband and I had the dosas, consisting of dosa with potatoe filling, Sambhar, chutney. Whilst the Sambhar was tasty, the dosa lacked the essential crispness and the potato filling was tastless, missing seasoning and spiciness. We are both of Indian origin and have had dosas previously."
Excellent Food; Excellent Value,What a treat. All around exceptional food. Waiter was extremely helpful guiding us based on what we like and made sure we had just enough. And get this... Totally satisfied for under 40 dollars for the three of us. Only wish they sold beer.
Fantastic Food!,"We stayed in Little India during our trip and knew we needed to find an Indian restaurant to eat at, and we were not disappointed. This place is amazing. The food is so inexpensive, and the food is extremely delicious! Make sure you head here AFTER 6pm, as a lot of dishes aren't available until this time. Our absolute favorite was the Gobi Manchurian!"
Normal Chennai type,"It’s good for people who wants to eat veg south Indian food. The quality is good and the cost is reasonable. But if you are from India and a tourist, may be the average ambiance will disappoint. It’s a very regular type."
Excellent Place to Dine for Indian Vegetarians in Singapore,"They have excellent lip-smacking Indian Vegetarian food options. This strictly vegetarian restaurant stays open till pretty late (10:30pm Singapore Time) and serves extremely reasonably priced large portions of meals.
We selected their ""set"" menu options and take-aways only as we were staying at Orchard Road. Each ""set"" option was much more than just sufficient to fill-up 2 average gobblers.
I believe, just like me, most will visit the place repeatedly for a wholesome, fresh & healthy Indian Vegetarian Meal and be charmed by the affectionate owners who happily help tired travellers as if we are just family to them.
Definitely recommended."
Too many choices!,"We were worried about finding good vegetarian food in Singapore but we were wrong about that. This was walking distance to our hotel. Get the big dosai especially if you have kids, so fun. The tea was delicious and loved to eat with our hands!"
Great find and well worth a visit.,We searched trip advisor for recommendations and choose KomalaVillas and wow! The dosas were amazing and the sambals were really really tasty. We took a dosa and tali and shared and were not disappointed. Nor did we go hungry as the portions were generous. Don’t walk by!
Call me a regular,"What a gem! Wish we had these in the states. Yes, it's clearly a fast food ambiance, but we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of food. It was on par with the other fine/mid-range Indian restaurants nearby."
Excellent and authentic,"The restaurant really feels like you are in Tamil Nadu in India. It has that authentic feel with the efficient waiters and super tasty grub. If you want to et an experience of india outside of india, go here. The food - the usual staple South Indian fare dosas idles and the like, all tasting as they should, but most importantly with the correct chutney and sambhar."
Connecting to the Tamil speaking population in Singapore,"Komala Vilas is one of the best place to enjoy typical Indian vegetarian food in Singapore. Located right on the Serangoon Road of Little India, it probably has seen growth of Singapore from India point of view right from the time it opened doors in 1947. Everything here tastes so so good, that it makes it difficult to call out. During lunch hours I prefer their full meal during. If you are looking for a great luxurious place, this is not the one. But if you are looking for great vegetarian food, there is nothing better than Komala Vilas. If your a group that cannot fill all seats of a table, be ready to share your table with others. Treat that as opportunity to connect with a new set of friends."
Nice dosa varieties,Went here with a friend and tried the masala dosa and rava dosa. Was good and fresh with sambar and coconut chutney. We wanted to have the butter Milk but wasn’t available. Nice place with reasonable price and pure vegetarian.
Comfort food and easy on the pocket,"On our last day in Singapore we decided to check out what all the hype is about little India. Tbh just by entering it you start feeling the Indian vibes, their rich culture and not to miss the Bollywood music in small shops and restaurants.

You just can’t miss the aroma of Indian food when you are there so we thought why not just get into this tiny restaurant and give it a try.

I was quiet hesitant as I’m a complete meat lover and this is a total vegetarian restaurant. We ordered the palak paneer, paneer butter masala and daal with lots of plain and garlic naan.

To my surprise when I food was served it was so yummy. The paneer butter masala is a must try and the daal was the best I have ever had in my entire life. By far the best Indian veg food I have ever had!
Just a tip not to miss their Indian tea at the end of your meal. The way they serve it is a wonderful experience.

Considering how expensive Singapore is when it comes to food items this was the most reasonable out of all. Totally worth every penny. Just make sure your stuff your self as later you will miss it badly :("
Very nice restaurant,I went for lunch and had the masala dosa and a lassi. All was so good! Very crowded at lunch time. Have not had a good masala dosa since my years in Chennai. This was very nice. If you get to Little India give it a try. Sharing tables is good !
Always visit when in Little India,A great value meal.No frills just good honest food visited by locals and tourists alike.Dosa’s always a favourite with us.Always busy as very popular.Sat upstairs on this visit.Usually end up chatting with locals who are dining.A very Friendly atmosphere.
Authentic South Indian meals !!!,"Komala Villas restaurant is the place to go if you want to enjoy authentic South Indian meals in Singapore. It is probably one of the oldest Indian restaurants in Singapore. The place is quite small and interiors are basic. However, food is awesome and authentic South Indian. Loved the dosa, vada and idli. Pricing is very very reasonable as compared to some other places that we had Indian meals here."
Authentic Indian restaurant,"You could easily be in Delhi, the service was friendly and warm, the food was outstanding, the price well you could of easily been in Delhi, a must visit for anybody who is a lover of traditional vegetarian Indian food, A must visit for me when visiting Singapore"
Simply Delicious,Went there for lunch with my family and the food there was simply delicious. everything was perfectly spiced and it was very reasonably priced.
Great food and experience for a 2nd time,"Went here for a 2nd visit when our cruise ship stopped in Singapore for the day. Took my mum (who generally avoids Indian food) and her partner as they missed it last time we visited and they both loved it. The food is great, the place is clean, staff are lovely and helpful to anyone who needs help. Very good value or money. If you want an authentic experience of Indian food while in Singapore this is it. ensure you pop next door for the Indian sweets when you have finished!"
