Superb food at value-for money prices,"Despite living nearby, and despite its lofty reputation amongst the locals, this was my first visit to this 75-year old restautant. We visited as a group of friends during a recent public holiday for breakfast. We got to the restaurant, housed in a modest two-strorey building, in time to be amongst its first diners of the day. That early in the morning, the restaurant was filled with frankinsence-scented smoke which was part of the staff's daily prayer ritual.

The restaurant's menu was fairly comprehensive although some items were not available until 11 am when the lunch service proper starts. Nevertheless, there were still plenty of both northern and southern Indian dishes to choose from. As a group, we had a variety of dosa (flat crepe), idli (steamed rice cakes) and uttapam (a thicker form of dosa) combinations for our respective mains, with a few vadas to share, all washed down with several cups of hot masala tea each. Portions of mains were reasonably large enough to make breakfast a filling and satisfying one. Best of all, prices were very reasonable and affordable."
Best kept secret,Amazing value for money and authentic taste. Sambar was to die for and the food was amazing quality. It’s a shame that the kind of food served here is still so niche and not more commonly available in larger establishments. I wish the world could get a taste of this type of food and really get to appreciate its wholesomeness and taste.
Iconic restaurant with great food,"This restaurant is one of the iconic Indian restaurants in Singapore, so we visited this place for brunch. As usual, there was a queue for table, but we got a table within 10 mins wait. We order the traditional dishes, masala dosa, puri and aloo sabji and idli, at the end some tea and coffee. Tasted authentic south indian and divine, lived up to the reputation. Will def visit again, if we are visiting singapore."
Excellent,Fantastic dosa for breakfast. Good friendly service. Very good vegetarian options. Clean and spacious settings. Excellent value.
Great vegi rice meals and Dosa.,"As an expat in Singapore and a lover of Indian cuisine this is our go two restaurant for our Sunday lunch.
We head here about twice a month.
I recommend the paneer dosa, biryani rice plate and the paneer butter marsala.
Ask for a table upstairs, it's quicker to get in."
Crazy rules,"Good food quality, however staff were not too friendly, sometimes rude. When we order curd rice, they did not have it as a dine-in option but allowed only take away. However, when we say we can buy the take away from their own restaurant and have in the restaurant, they rudely refused. Strange rules - why force a take-away for an item that we want to have at the restaurant. Crazy !!"
Best Dosai,"My son and I stumbled upon Komala Vilas when we were walking around Little India. We saw a queue mid morning and immediately thought that it has to be good and decided to join the queue. When we got to the front of the line we went through the menu displayed on the stand. Since, it would be brunch for us, we decided against the banana leaf rice and settled for the dosai.

Had the normal masala dosai and the mysore masala dosai. Both were so tasty. The best dosai we ever had. These were washed down with the standard tea and the masala tea we ordered. Surprisingly, it was also very filling and cost us only SGD14.60. Should we ever visit Singapore again, I would like to try their banana leaf meal."
Value for money,"If you are visiting Singapore and love authentic south Indian food, Komala Vilas is the place to go. Did I mention its really economical.
We stayed near the hotel and had breakfast everyday and 1 dinner from this place. Dosas, Poori and Idiappam are really awesome and they provide 3 types of chutneys with dosas along with Sambar. We had a wholesome breakfast for 3 people under SGD 20."
Still great after all these years,"First came to this restaurant in 1989 as a fresh faced backpacker and again in 96 with my young family.

I’m pleased to say that apart from the obvious changes to the decor, the food and service are still the best.

I recall that upstairs it had stainless steel tables and a sink in the corner to wash your hands but it’s been modernised since but not too much to lose it’s character.
I have been twice in two days as the first visit reminded me of how good the food really was!

First time around Biryani and marsala tea, 2nd visit Masala Dhosa and tea again. Excellent quality and the staff attentive as always. You could get cheaper but why compromise? a Dhosa meal was 11 Sing dollars.

I would recommend this restaurant without hesitation as it’s been doing something right since 1947!! The queue outside should tell you all you need to know.
If your looking for authentic Indian vegetarian food this place is for you

I just hope I don't have to wait another 26 years before sampling the food again!!"
Well known name,"I was amazed at the long lines outside KV every morning for the morning cuppa and breakfast , however inside was a normal udipi type restaurant , the layout of which was not so impressive .. really dont understand why the long lines as the food is at par with other restaurants ... the owners can do a makeover of the same to improve or do they want to let it remain the way it is ???????"
Overhyped,"I had heard so much about this restaurant. Walked all the way from downtown. Average food, and below average service. Sambar was bland and upama was like lump of semolina devoid of any taste. Missing Sagar Ratna and Naivadyam . Avoid"
AMAZING food but poor service,"This place serves such delicious food, even the plain dosai dish was amazing. I really recommend the Bhattura it was incredible. Also masala tea is lovely. But be warned, the staff are not friendly, personable, or attentive."
Disgusting Experience at KOMALA VILAS ( Upper Dickson) - MANAGER,"My experience with Komala Vilas Restaurant at Upper Dickson Road was disgusting.

Upon reaching the restaurant, we were offered a place to sit inside (behind the doors). All the tables were occupied and people having their meals (which means they came before us. We ordered one mock mutton biryani set and one south Indian vegetarian meal.

Just like any other normal human being, we wanted to have a cup of coffee after our meal. Unfortunately, there was no waiter watching over the place. So, after waiting for about 10 mins, I went up near the cashier to place my order for coffee. Just then, the people seating around me left. (Note: 6 people left and they were one family). As my coffee arrived and we were drinking the coffee, MANAGER SUDAHKAR (South Indian man in grey shirt) started closing the door and left abit ajar. It was okay for me as I thought he was trying gesture to the upcoming diners that the place was not open.

A while later, I realised that the Aircon was shut off. When I asked the manager, he rudely snapped at us that they have to start cleaning the place at 3 pm. (Note: It was not 3 pm yet) He is a liar. We told him that we are still having the hot coffee and would like to have the Aircon on.

Again, rudely, he snapped at us that about 20 - 30 people who came after you have eaten and left. Now, this is completely unacceptable.

How can MANAGER SUDAHKAR even say something like this to a customer who is still dining? It's not like I am taking my own sweet time to complete my food 11pm. It was about 2.30 pm. Even, if I am having my meals and they want to close the place/restaurant, any trained and professional manager will tell us nicely that the place was going to close in 15 mins and if we would like to shift to another place etc.

If anyone who know if I could escalate this matter to anyone, please let me know. This MANAGER SUDAHKAR need to be taught how to run a restaurant and speak to his customers. He should learn from his waiters (people in yellow and white shirt). They are 100% times polite, respectful and kind than MANAGER SUDAHKAR. Instead, they should be the managers.

Best part, MANAGER SUDAHKAR did not even check our vaccination status. I thought it was mandatory.

It will be my last trip to any KOMALA VILAS RESTAURANT."
Cashier experience 3rd May 2021 5pm,I visit this restaurant often including with family. The service is extremely poor. Today I just thought to get some ready made snack to take away after having the food there. I didn’t expect the price of those snacks to be so high so I requested the cashier to cancel the two snacks. She was extremely rude and told already billed and cannot cancel. I told her I am a regular customer and I am still in the shop. Why is it so difficult to cancel ? They don’t care a damn about service. My previous feedback few years back was not replied to.
Excellent Indian food joint,"The beauty of this place is the balance between authentic good food, right price, and good ambience.
Both north Indian and South Indian food are authentic and good to taste. The price is very reasonable.
The ambience is just okay actually much better considering the price."
Great indian,If you come to this restaurant for the service you will be greatly disappointed. But the food was absolutely delicious. We found this restaurant by chance looked inside and it was very busy so thought let’s give it a try. We both had the Dosa and like I said it was delicious. I also prob wouldn’t look to closely at the cleanliness. But hey give it a go.
Best for South Indians to enjoy Vegetarian stuff,This is a nice restaurant at little India area and has specially all south indian specials and we enjoyed after Bali visit which was not a that good experience for veggies.
pure Little India experience,"I am veggi, so for me this place was heaven on earth just around the corner. The food is authentic and really good. Evenmore I loved the atmosphere, a good mixture of locals and tourists. The place is always packed, always busy, always noisy. Sometimes you are just placed with other people. Staff is friendly, not pushy and helps with the menu. Prices are really cheap, especially for Singapore."
Great Vegetarian Meal,"Komala Vilas is a nice Indian vegetarian restaurant in Little India that satisfied our hunger around lunch time.

Space can be a little cramped since it was busy and we ended up scaring our table with another patron.

The food was delicious. I'm normally a guy who needs meat in his meals, but the wife was craving vegetarian. I ordered garlic naan with mushroom mutton and she got the onion uttapam with three sides.

The garlic naan has visible bits of garlic covering it, but surprisingly not overpowering with flavor. I wouldn't have minded a stronger punch of garlic, but I do love garlic. The mushroom mutton was also very tasty and not overpowering as far as flavors go. I probably could have ordered another set of naan bread to finish the mutton with.

The uttapam was a pancake-like food which we ordered the onion version of. It’s like much thicker dosai with a topping of your choice. The sides were really good and my wife especially liked the curry one. I personally liked the spicy one. The white one reminded me of a cole slaw.

We finished the meal with a mango lassi which was refreshing. Not overpowering with the yogurt flavor which I appreciated.

You can tell a lot of locals cane here to eat which was a great sign. Thankfully they also had a sink with soap to wash your hands since the meals are eaten by hand.

Overall really good experience and we would come back again"
Good Indian Food for Reasonable Price,"The food was pretty good. We ate from the Lite Fare and so we were seated in the lower level dining area, which was pretty close quarters. We had the lentil doughnuts; the Kothu Parotta; and the samosas. I also had the gulab jamun. Everything was tasty and well spiced. The restaurant is right in the heart of Little India and very easy to find. Overall, nice visit."
Excellent food - typically Indian,"It can be difficult to find authentic Indian food outside of India but Komala Vilas is the real thing. We ate there three times recently on a short visit to Singapore and would thoroughly recommend a wander round little India followed by a stop at this restaurant.

Both the dosa and puris are excellent and so is the samba - I don't think I should go on - my mouth watering just thinking about the place.

Basic but good with helpful staff."
Best Indian Food,I visited this place around 10:27 and there closing time is 10:30 Pm still they took order. The staff is very cooperative. Not only they gave take away as well. After reaching my hotel when I ate the food I was amazed with the taste and quality. Cheers to Team Komala's.
"Good, cheap Indian Vegetarian food","Really good (and cheap) Indian Veg food. We went a couple of times and the Dosa was great, along with the Chapati Thali. Was very busy every time we went and there are a couple (we counted 3) of these around Little India."
"Superb Elai Sapadu, but the Biryani is Brinji Rice",We ordered Veg Meals and Veg Biryani. Veg meal was superb and we were little disappointed with Veg Biryani (it is Brinji Rice severed in the name of Biryani)
The best south indian food in Singapore,"This is one of the oldest vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. Their dosas are awesome, especially the cone dosa. Restaurant is crowded always. They serve north indian veg food too."
Authentic Indian Vegitarian cuisine,"Saw this restaurant when visiting Little India the other evening, It was completely full always a good sign. Went back and was not disappointed, extensive menu and all served fresh. Can recommend the banana bajiss and Biriani served with 5 different vegetable side dishes all finished off with natural sweet lassi.

One Biriani adequate for two people if having a side order."
Really nice Indian food,It was my first night in Singapore and my hotel was close to little India. I walked by this restaurant and it looked really authentic. I decided to give it a try. The food was really good and full of flavour. It was busy and I shared a table with two other girls and I had a great dinner. The curry and the chapati were really delicious. I recommend this place to everyone who is in Little India and who likes Indian food. (I forgot to make a picture before I started to eat :) ).
You must eat here,"Wow. I'm not a vegetarian but I was blown away by the food here. This is the absolute must go to restaurant in little India. Don't expect 5 star luxury. Expect a shock to your taste buds and healthy, flavoursome food.
Simply the best Indian restaurant in Singapore"
Best Dosa in town!,"After hearing so much about Dosa from fellow travellers, the second I got to Singapore I had to try some knowing that little India was there, and Komala Vilas most definitely showed me what everyone was talking about! I had the masala Dosa with an onion baji and it was absolutely amazing! I could have quite easily ate another. Will definitely be coming back again before I leave Singapore."
Excellent Masala Dosa,"Great lunch! We ventured upstairs instead of downstairs, reminded me of being in India. Great food. Highly recommend the Masala Dosa."
So good!!,I ordered some naan and Chenna masala as a snack and I’m so glad I did! It was delicious and super quick. They offer communal style tables so I was able to sit and meet people I didn’t know previously which was nice as a solo traveler. Definitely recommend as a spot to grab food before or after visiting Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple!
Tasty south Indian food,"No wonder it is always filled with people, they prepare simple and tasty Indian food at very reasonable prices. The thalis and dosas were were good and the Thali was more than adequate.

Although we did not order, a lot of people were ordering Chai and seems to be popular here"
Peerless,"We make it a point to make this a mandatory stop whenever in Singapore. The food comes out unbelievably quickly considering the volume of guests they handle. The food is tasty and wholesome. The place is teeming with tourists who no doubt have come to know of this place by word of mouth. In fact we were seated at a table with two tourists from Australia who made their journey to this restaurant whist there were in transit in Singapore for a few hours.

In my opinion the food at this establishment is the benchmark for vegetarian cuisine, with selection from both north and south India.

Can't wait for my next visit."
Vegetarian friendly,One of the oldest Indian vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. Both south indian & north indian cuisines are available. Taste is also nice.
Authentic delicious Indian restaurant,Had a delicious masala and cone dosa at Komala Vilas. Hosts were very welcoming and helpful. Excellent value for money and we wish we had the chance to return
Top notch South Indian food,"A colleague told me that this was a must-visit for a meal in Singapore, and she wasn't wrong!

I had the masala dosa meal, and every last mouthful was simply wonderful.
(One of the vegetable dishes was so extraordinarily delicious that I've since been trying to extract a similar recipe form my colleague's mother!)

Straightforward service, great prices, and hardly any tourists."
Great food,The best vegetarian indian food in singapore -friendly staff and reasonable priced. We ate here for three days and really enjoyed authentic indian food.
Excellent South Indian Vegetarian Restaurant,"After walked all day at the Orchid garden, we went to Kolavilas in Tamil. The restaurant was full, have to wait few minutes. My wife ordered Masala Dosa, I order Poori Potato, Massala Vadai, nephew ordered Bhatura and Cholai. We finsihed off our dinner with Lassi and Mysore Pak desert. a soul fulfilling lunch for a Tamilian."
Terrific casual vegetarian Indian restaurant,"Was walking around the touristy Little India neighborhood looking for a place for late lunch. I noticed that this place was full, with mainly Indian customers which is a good sign. So I stopped in, was seated promptly and given the menu.
I'm not vegetarian but in my opinion Indian cuisine is the best vegetarian food due to the flavored.
I had a great, reasonably priced meal, the service was terrific. Would I go back- absolutely."
Very poor service 😡,Very bad service😡 Im very disappointed with the Service . Even they don’t know that how to make the tea . It’s was worse and worse.. need to improve more..
tasty fresh and wholesome,great value vegetarian south Indian restaurant in Little India. Singapore is notoriously expensive but for less than fifteen dollars you can eat remarkably well here. busy at all times but tables move fast so definitely worth waiting for a few minutes if there isn't a seat available right away!
The food is really tastes good,"This is a very good place to have some Authentic South Indian food, I love the food here. It’s just that it’s always crowded. But the wait is worth the quality and the taste. I just don’t like the way they organise guest. They don’t help getting seats we have to find our own and most of the times or at Least this is second time I was waiting but others who came after us just went in and took away seats.

The service seemed a bit slow may be this person serving us was having a bad day. But as its said what ends well all is well. The food was amazing."
Value for money,"This restaurant is in the middle of Little India in Singapore. Quite an old one and is thriving since ages. Crowded place, congested but then once the food arrives you forget everything. Had yummy masala dosa, idiyappam and coffee. Highly economical and tasty food. Now I know why it's crowded all the time. One of the best South Indian restaurant in Singapore."
"Hands down, the best South Indian vegetarian restaurant in Singapore",I've been going to Komala Vilas (including the main branch on Serangoon Road) for over 20 years and I'm amazed by their consistency in quintessential Tamil vegetarian food.
udipi restaurant,"This is restaurant in Little India in Singapore. People who like south Indian food can visit this restaurant. The restaurant is very simple like Udipi what one finds in India . One can have Idli, Dosa , Wada etc at very reasonable prices from 3 to 8 singapore dollars.The location is on main road easy to find. Mustafa market where one can visit for puchases of various things when in Singapore is just half kms from here."
Cheated by Komala Vilas in Buffalo Road Singapore,"I bought Idiyappam one packet from Komala Vilas Restaurant at 12-14 Buffalo Road, Singapore. The restaurant charged me 5 singapore dollars. I thought it is a good price. when I moved to other shops nearby they too were selling the same Idiyappam packet. When I enquired the price it is SGD 2.50. I felt cheated because I was charg05.10ed higher for the same stuff. Please do not visit the restaurant or buy anything from it. I am still having the receipt with me Bill No 480. 05-10-2018 05:02 PM"
Bad experience. Disappointed with service. Lack of humanity. Job is just earning money.,"If there is any negative star I would have given that ranking now. Worst service I experienced in this restaurant. Not suggested to go with family even alone. We not even wanted to seat for one single minute in hotel after experience. Because of hotel staff and owner behaviour, we lost our interest in dinner and left half stomach from table.

I entered in hotel by 10.30 p.m. with my family and ordered for unlimited meal and puri bhaji set as we three ladies and one girl child was in trip. Unlimited food took by my sister and I took puri set for me. My mother was not hungry so she choose to share with me.

In unlimited meal no chapati or puri provided so, I wish them to pay more for it. When asked to staff they told as kitchen is closed so, In front of manager I shared my puri from puri set with unlimited meal person (my sister) and took four bite of rice from my sister in exchange.

When we asked waiters for rice for 3 yrs old child from unlimited meal got reply Kitchen closed , No more food, food thrown.

First negative star for, When the unlimited meal customer is already eating food how could hotel throw food or refuse to give food? We are paying for it. If you cannot serve then don't take order.

Second negative star for, at first time when they said as kitchen is closed then I responded back with showing understanding of sharing my food then what is wrong to share food from unlimited meal?

Third negative star for, I asked food for 3 yrs old child there no such humanity to think about child food? When they pointed out about sharing I stopped eating a food at that moment and return the food for child. When last time my sister asked for curd for child as she likes to it then too got same answer as it's thrown out.

No use of taking unlimited food as food served ones. Waste of money, waste of time waste of food."
Tasty Tiffin,"Visited Komala vilas restaurant in Serangoon road on 3rd August for mid afternoon late lunch. The restaurant was full even then. There were a lot of south Indian dishes available. We had dosa, chappathi, poori, bajji and filter coffee. Needless to say the food was delicious. It's a shame we couldn't go back as we only stayed for 3 days."
"Good food, terrible waiters","While the food is good, all of the staff working there was treating us as if we were their worst enemies."
Very good - hard to fault at this price,"Great vegetarian restaurant with very affordable prices ($3-$5) a meal food; dosa (pancakes) and naan like breads with tomatoes and excellent accompanying sauces (curry, tomato and yoghurt dressing) bursting with flavour: definitely a place for locals but you won’t feel estranged... Recommended!"
Gem of a restaurant in Little India,My wife and I found this restaurant by accident and we ended up visiting 2 more times during our short stay in Singapore. This venue serves excellent vegetarian Southern Indian food which appeals even to meat lovers like myself. It opens up early in the morning which makes it a great spot for breakfast too. Prices are very low and the quality is top notch.
Extremely good food,Located at little India The place is simple but the food is home made and very tasty... Clean vegetarian food...
"Good food, friendly staff!",Quality of food is great. The portions are pretty good. The staff at the restaurant are very friendly and eager to help. The prices are affordable. Value for money.
Food is cheap and good,The prices are really reasonable for their portions and quality. The food is tasty and appetizing. Service is fast too. Only thing is that the waiting time to get a seat is rather long.
The first meal will be here when we return to Singapore!,"We got a hint from a local guy and are still grateful for the great advice. His promise about delicious butter chicken come true and I really liked the Palak Paneer. Actually, we ordered few other dishes and all were really tasty. The service was nice the food was delicious and the price was reasonable. I highly recommend this place, it is nice to sit outside, right next to the Indian heritage center and enjoy the Indian cuisine. As traveling foodies, we visited few places in Singapore and gave them more detailed description on our blog page. Maybe you'll find something interesting, so feel free to check it out."
Look for alternatives just down the road,The food is acceptable; especially when one compares the fare to what used to be available in this restaurant over the decades. Customers expectations are higher.The owners have perhaps taken to complacency bearing in mind the large tourist crowds that frequent this locality. Cleanliness and hygiene is another sore point. It is indeed sad to see an establishment well known for its quality vegetarian fare performing poorly. The waiters and other staff need to be more courteous and attentive to the needs of the customers.
Great vegetarian food,Came here looking for vegetarian Indian food.You go upstairs for set meals.Meal chapatti was really filling and delicious
Cheap and (very) nice!,"Located in Little India (close to the Metro station). There are three premises, all serving excellent purely vegetarian food, we visited two of them and found the same quality in both. Specialising in South Indian cuisine but also offering North Indian too. They are extremely busy with mainly local clientele and offering a wide menu of choices, idlis, dosas, uttapams, etc. It’s not fine dining with food served on banana leaves or patria plates (you can eat with your fingers if you wish). We particularly enjoyed the Rawa Mysore Masala. Large and filling and rather hot. The bill coming out at $12 for two people, including tea. Great!"
Fantastic cheap south indian food,"I viistd the buffalo road location but all sites have similar menus. The dosai is nice and crispy. I enjoyed the rava dosa which was perfect. Rustic seating but for S$7:50 had 2 filter coffees, rava dosa vada sambar. Wish I could have tried the bhaturas which looked delish but had no foom in my tummy"
Great south Indian Veggi Food !,"If you are a vegetarian and looking for south indian options, this is the place for you. Its always crowded - difficult to get a seat as they are bang in the middle of Little India and visited by locals too !

We had most of our lunches and dinner here during our stay in Singapore. The food is awesome and prepared well - but the only downside is that as tourist - you will need to pay in 'cash only' they accept the local debit card tough. Surprising for a restaurant with so many customers. I suspect that the margins are low and want to keep the CC charges away.

This apart - the food was awesome. On the day we arrived in Singapore - I went to this place and took 2 rice meals as parcels to our hotel as the kids did not want to come post travel. The quantity was huge and was enough for close to 4 people and too many items (curries, samabar, rasam, etc) - had to throw out lot of stuff.

Highly recommend this place - don't miss it."
Great veggie indian food,Loved this Indian vegetarian restaurant in Singapore's Little India. Felt very authentic and had an extensive menu. Loved the dosa and the ginger tea. A great cheap-eat in Singapore!
Good Indian food,The South Indian food is good here... they have some thing called dosa meal which comes with three vegetable dishes apart from usual chutneys and sambar. The bhaji for poori reminds me old time tamilnadu Enjoyed
Avoid if you have choice,"Non smiling crew; pathetically tasting vada ; tourist crowd; decent taste food ; tissue paper for foreigners and only spoon and folk for Indians; avg tasting coffee ! Price is good for Dosa, idly and Pongal !"
"Well-Balanced Spices, Full-Flavoured, Absolutely Yummy!","It's been around 13 years since I last visited this restaurant. I ordered only a simple Masala Thosai (a wrap with potato fillings) the last time, but this time round, my dinner mate was equally adventurous and appreciative of Indian food that we ordered several dishes which we had no idea what to expect...
Everything turned out to be delicious! (See pics)
My favourite was the Gobi Manchurian. Looking at its name, I believe it's a fusion innovation.
It's a special item on the menu and available only after 6pm. Made entirely of vegetable, go try it and figure out what it is. Hoho"
Delicious authentic food .,"Absolutely delicious vegetarian Indian food . We ordered a selection of dishes mainly by pointing, including the Rawa dosai with dips which we ended up ordering twice. I washed my dinner down with a cup of sweet milky ginger and cardamom tea, which I can't imagine drinking at home but tasted perfect with the meal. Loved the authentic taste and feel of the place and wished we had had time to make a repeat visit . Definitely a highlight of many delicious eating experiences in Singapore. Nice story of the founder of the now chain arriving in Singapore from India in 1936 with just a suitcase."
"Local, Cheap, Fabulous, Vegetarian","While friendly to tourists, make no mistake, this is a local joint. The food is delicious, cheap, and vegetarian. I highly recommend breakfast at the Komala Vilas Serangoon Road location (one block away). It opens at 7am and the dosa are to die for!"
Excellent south Indian food,Wiah you had infinite apetite to try their dishes. Authentic south Indian dishes. Must try their wada-sambhar. Dosas are excellent too. Must eat place.
Good for cheap and tasty eats,"We visited the outlet at 76-78 Serangoon Road and sat upstairs. The staff were friendly and helpful although some have only rudimentary English. The kids loved the thick mango lassis and fresh coconuts. We tried the peas masala and aloo gobi masala - the grown-ups found everything delicious although the food was generally a little too spicy for the kids (this is not the establishment's fault, of course). Prices are very low. A great place for cheap and tasty eats."
Most amazing cone dosai,"This vegetarian restaurant has been renovated recently. The service is quick and the food is tasty. Just love the dosai that comes in various form. The cone dosai is particularly my favorite, crispy outside and moist inside. It's perfect to end the meal with a bru coffee.

Highly recommend."
Excellent vegeterian food,"This restorant was full downstairs and they told us to try upstairs. Upstairs we had to wait for few minutes for free table. Behind still was long cue.
We ordered 4 smaller vegeterian foods but they have run out of 2 already. Likly we shared our table with kind Indian gentlemen who suggested special rice meal which was delicious.
Good was reasonable prices and I can say one of the best I ever had. Would love to come back to taste more delicious food."
Good Vegetarian restaurant,"Hi,
I have been to this restaurant couple of times and found the food to be very good.
This is a south Indian cuisine restaurant.
I usually order dosa meal and marsala dosa...
Price is on the lower side. Staff is very polite.
Do try it once.
Regards,
Prakash Matuwani"
Decent restaurant,"Hi,

Been here last week with my wife for lunch. Ordered ""thosa meal"" and ""poori set"".
Thosa meal was around 7+$ if i remember correctly which was nice but expensive for its kind. Oil usage was bit high compared to other komala vilas restaurants. Overall a decent restaurant."
worst service,"We visited last sunday about 16.00hrs and waited few minutes next to the cashier at second floor. As there was no one to guide us, I asked from the man who is appeared to be like chief waiter ""can I order?"" Then he angryly shout back to me commanding to order from the cashier. Then, without arguing with him I asked from the Cashier "" why he is shouting?"" and left from the resturant as we wanted to enjoy our meal not to be humilated. Whole evening was spoiled. Will not visit any Komala Vilas again."
Awesome!,"You will get amazing south-indian dishes (I tried only south-indian dishes), mostly better than what you get in India. Authentic Tamilnadu dishes, very good taste and quantity. If you like South indian food, I would say this is the best you can have in Singapore. Just go for it.

All dishes are tasty"
Excellent meal for a cheap price,Very good food I recommend. One of the best Indian restaurant I had except for the mango Lassi too much yogurt.
Busy vegetarian restaurant,"We visited this very busy Indian vegetarian restaurant for an evening meal. Arriving at about 8pm we were shown straight to a table but by the time we left at about 8:45 pm customers were queuing to wait for a vacant table. We chose a Vegetable Biryani and a Gobi Manchuria ( lightly battered cauliflower in an Indo Chinese sauce.) It was a good meal and we enjoyed all the different flavours. This restaurant does not serve alcohol but we had a refreshing cold lemon drink. The bill came to S$20for two. We feel that this is a restaurant to go in, eat and leave rather than spend time chatting over a relaxing drink following the meal."
Delicious,It's very old restaurant in little India Singapore. Serves excellent n delicious south Indian food. It didn't miss my home Mumbai to have authentic food here.
Amazing value for money. Excellent vegetarian,"Two of us visited and we chose from the ""light meals"" menu. We had Bhattura and Paper Dosai, plus a cup of Teh Tarek each. Meals were delicious! Total bill was under $14!! What a steal!"
Excellent Vego S.Indian food - as usual!,"Coming here has become a pilgrimage every time my family visits Singapore. It is reliably cheap and delicious :-) Don't expect anything fancy or well plated, just go in thinking of the authentic flavours of South India and that's exactly what you'll get. Good hearty, well made and delicious. Couldn't ask for more."
Family favourite great Thosai,We come here frequently as the food and service is very good. My children love the masala Thosai here. Great value and great food.
Delicious food,"The food was absolutely delicious! Only thing that let it down was the service. The staff were quite rude and forgot my meal, I had to ask them for it which was a shame. The food really is good though."
"That sambar was really really awesome! Good vegetarian, cheap, casual eating!","Sometimes you get a dish and you are in awe of it! The sambar that came along with my Kid’s Dosa was out of the world. Probably the brinjal was nicely cooked and all its flavour were part of the sambar. It was full of flavours. Though we tried north Indian this time, I had two bowls of sambar just to drink. Drooling again as I am typing!

We tried - Tandoori roti (okay type), Panner Butter masala (amazing), Dal (nice) and Allo gobi (nice with low texture). Jeera rice was okay, I did not like the texture. I also did not find Cheese Dosa interesting as it was not crispy and less cocked.

It is unusual to eat North Indian cuisine in a South Indian specialty restaurant, but we tried it on recommendation. It was good.

The food was surprisingly cheap. Servers were courteous. No frill, basic ambience, good for casual eating out."
Cheap vegetarian food!,"Ive been eating here with my family since i was a kid.

Though the prices have increased and the standards have dropped slightly, we still do visit when we are in the mood for south indian vegetarian food.

I would recommend the rice set meal though the other tiffin options like bhattura and thosai are yummy too.

I love their vadais! Can be eaten with or without chutney.

Give this place a shot if you are looking for cheap south indian vegetarian food!"
Very good south Indian food,"We have dined in this restaurant many times whenever we visited Little India. The food is awesome and authentic South Indian. You will get good hygenic, tasty south Indian food here."
Still the best food,"We've been visiting for over twenty years and I'm happy to say it's still the best South Indian food in little India Service has improved, ambiance and decor are the same. It gets the Narendra Modi tick of approval-praise indeed. Good alternatives are MTR1924 and Woodlands."
"Simple, affordable, delicious vegetarian restaraunt","I first tried Komala Vilas several years ago when I was staying in Little India for a couple weeks. I was immediately hooked and go back whenever I'm in Singapore! The fully-vegetarian menu is pretty simplistic but has plenty of options. This location in particular gets very crowded, but for good reason. The food is delicious, the service is quick, and the prices are right."
Overrated Indian Food,"The legend of Komala's reaches everyone and you would eventually end up there. However it failed to live upto the name. Service is pedestrian but thats not the major concern. The dosas were ordinary and had to contend with Coffee to feel better about the place.

Hope its a better experience for others."
No fuss cheap food.,An excellent South Indian vegetarian restaurant inexpensive.But can get very busy. Masala Dosai and Samosa is outstanding.
Great food,Lovely location and excellent food.. Vegeterians delight and quality was amazing.. really enjoyed our dinner...
Perfect South Indian food,I tried their chole Bhature masala dosa idli vada Perfect taste. Very nice masala tea One tea / coffee can b shared by two people
Best place for Indian food: especially south india,"The Komal Vilas Restaurant has a few outlets centered around Little India. The food is authentic Indian vegetarian, All the outlets are always crowded, The managers are extremely helpful and the staff courteous and efficient. Best place to get the favouirite soth indian IDLI/DOSA. Value for money. Great food for my family consisting of children and senior citizens . Would certainly recommend it to all Indians visiting Singapore who prefer indian food."
Pure Veg Restaurant.,"Great place to go for south Indian fare, not too expensive and clean. The only drawback is standing in a queue for the payment and also for the self service ..."
paradise for vegetarians with South and North Indian food at reasonable price,"This Resturant is part of the same Komala Vilas onwers which have main resturant at Serangoon Road and where recently the Indian Prime Minister Visited with the Singapore PM and made it famous. Pure Vegetarian and very reasonably price resturant. The Race Course Branch is usually quiter and a table is easy to grab during peak hours.
The place is located right outside EXIT D on the NE Line (Purple Line) of MRT and is therefore very convienient access.
The South Indian fares are remarkable with must try IDLI + DOSA and DOSAS.. The Chutney and Sambhar are exceptionally good and understand that all the food is delivered from their central kitchen at Serangoon Road hence quality is always consistent.
They also have a North Indian menu which has excellent Bhindi Jaipuri (a fried Bhindi dish) and very nice Yellow daal.
The Rice Meal (Sappad) is the most exceptional Indian Thali they have which has 3 vege, raita, sambhar, sweet dish and some condiments making it a complete meal for $8.50"
Just as you'd expect,"Best place to go for South Indian vegetarian food! What more can you ask? But I'd say, it's time to move up the convenience scale. Many Indian restaurants back home offer more space and convenience. Standing in queues for billing and then again at the food counter for self service takes time, especially when you have a bus load of Indian tourists landing at the same time as you. And then you don't have enough clean tables to sit and have a peaceful meal. Food is alright, but space and service can be improved!"
Consistent food,The Race Course location has A/C and is a welcome relief in Singapore unlike the original branch on Serangoon road. Tried breakfast and elai sappadu (banana leaf meals). All breakfast items are tasty - not too oily or salty. Elai sappadu is heavy/filling. There is a reason Komala Vilas has such high ratings and that is consistency - we tried eating several days here and food was consistently good.
Authentic Excellent & Tasty food,"We visited the place number of times during the trip to Singapore and we felt the place to be an assurance of availability of authentic, good and tasty food at any hour of the day."
Typical South Indian food,"Unlike other South Indian Restaurants in Singapore, the setting here is just ok and If you're looking for a great dining experience it may not tick all the boxes .
If your are looking for typical South Indian food , this is a good place to visit . If you are hungry and would like a proper meal , the plain dosa meal is a must have . It has a good combination of curry and chutney and a payasam. Vadas are ok not as crispy as one would expect as they are made and stored in traditional style wooden boxes with glass windows. They could do a better job with th Mysore masala dosa. Idli is good with chutney. The onion chutney needs a bit more spice.
The chola batura is awesome, must try!
Other goodies are filter coffee and gulab jamun.
Enjoy

Tasty South Indian food,"We had our breakfast and dinner in this restaurant in Little India . Authentic South Indian food especially Pongal , vada, dosa is very tasty here . Small restaurant and always crowded but food at reasonable price ."
Authentic indian,Very authentic Indian restaurant with very little tourists. I was brought there by an Indian Friend and we had nice breakfast. Good food and very cheap.
No wonder it rates so well!,"If you want an authentic experience you can't pass Komala Vilas. Had read about this in a AA Guide City Pack book as to the best Indian Vegetarian restaurant to visit and can see why.
Wandering down Serangoon Rd to find this place the brilliance of colour, smells of spices, fruit, vegetables, and so many lights like a fairytale. Have visited at Diwali, even better!
Nothing fancy inside, do as the locals do, great choice of food, much of this never seen before, friendly, reasonable, quick, and so tasty. Served up on banana leaves.
Love the fact we were the only ones who weren't Indians here!
To end the night wandered round Little India, talk about a sensual experience."
