Conchinillo for the Win,"A Romantic Feel when you enter the restaurant. We came here Lunch time so not much people, no kids and very few guest.
My stardish are the Conchillo and the Paella. The beef tartar also good maybe for me its lacking of something. We will visit again soon to try other dishes . Thanks to Alex for taking care of us."
Delicious authentic Spanish food!!,"Binomio has wonderful Spanish food and delightful service. Some dishes that must be tried are their prawn confit and spinach and cheese croquette, as well as their paella. Would definitely return again!"
Wow where has this been ?,"Its been there ages but I had never heard of it. That is a real shame as I feel I have missed out.
Firstly is VERY good value as the tapas portions - (select 5 or 7) are easily big enough for 2 pax. The food was tasty and well presented.
The waiter was exceptionally helpful and attentive but not intrusive.
The wine list was excellent and I found a gem from Ribero Del Duero
I want to return to try their paella ."
Big than usual portions of Tapas,Two of us went there on a Friday night to start the weekend. We had the 5 tapas set @$139++ with a chorizo appetitzer and had to take 2 of the entire tapas to go. We were lucky to get a table at the cellar portion of the restaurant in spite of no reservation. The bill came up to $229+ with 2 glasses of Sherry. We were billed $299+ instead. Luckily I always check my bill and told them to fix it. It could very well be an honest mistake but do remember to always check your bill.
Nice vibe let down by disappointing food,"Me & my friends were given a nice long table towards the back of the restaurant. We found the food underwhelming, especially the Paellas: salty & oily. Service was intermittent. Place had a nice vibe but was noisy"
Tapas and more,Another lovely evening at Binomio. The tapas were amazing-- we took the set of 5 and all of them were great. Already planning the next visit.
"Friendly staff, nice food","We had a lovely Friday night at Binomio. Very friendly staff, pleasant buzz and enjoyable food. We enjoyed the cured ham and bread, the chorizo was a little oily, the sauce with the frittata had too much garlic, the paella was good. The staf LF and atmosphere made the experience"
"Great food, service and ambience.","Great food, service and ambience. Went for a pre-birthday celebration for my husband and loved the place. The restaurant has a great mix of a casual bar on 1 side and a formal set-up on the other. The tapas selection was wide and loved the pork and egg tapas. The crowuets were ok. The squid ink seafood paella was outstanding and the spring chicken was refreshing and juicy. What needs special mention is that the place has erhaps the best churros!
Service was very good - they were patient and advised well on food and wine and finally they were kind to arrange a small cake and candle as last minute request."
Delicious tapas,"After a hiatus, I have been back to Binomio twice in 2 weeks. Tonight was with the family. We had peppers, ham and chicken croquette, gammas and octopus and shared the main course of Angus beef, which was a chunky 500g portion. Also a carafe of sangria went well with the food. A dessert of churros to end an enjoyable evening"
Good Quality Spanish,"All of the food was excellent in quality and brought out looking beautiful. The pork especially was delightful. Mediocre wine list, but not a deal breaker. Some great value bottles in there."
Very Ordinary Tapas,"Not been back for ages but always like the chairs that are near the windows and you can look out rather than the boring white table cloth. I booked the table facing the small road. Ambience was nice and service staff Darren is very attentive. Unfortunately, the Tapas are a dismal. We ordered 4 tapas and they are very very ordinary. The last Tapas Tiger prawns took ages to arrive, we thought they forgot. And when it came, I wish they don't call it TIGER prawns.
Wine half bottle have only 3 types but they're good enough and price is very reasonable.
Overall, we will come back here for pre-dinner drinks but will head elsewhere for a better meal."
Burnt overpriced chicken and seafood paella,"My Spanish friend and I went for lunch. We had an artichokes and peas starter that was heavy on the peas with a few swollen artichoke pieces. It was okay but not anything particularly notable except the one note pea flavor. The paella, sadly, was burnt. I thought maybe it was supposed to be the style but my Spanish friend confirmed it was burnt. It did not allow me to appreciate any other flavor. In fact, I wanted coffee and dessert to wash away the burnt flavor but it took so long to get the waiters’ attention. Instead, we got the check and I nearly cried when I realized I paid $84 for a mediocre, bordering on bad, lunch. I heard the tapas were good, but I will not risk it again and will atone for my mistake by eating a $10 fish or chicken biryani."
Tapas tasting menu at bar area,"My previous visits were always to the main restaurant, but I now know that bar seating is much more intimate and quiet. Perfect for date night!

Had 6 tapas from the tasting menu for $79 and almost every single dish was well executed in terms of seasoning and presentation. The only miss was the Squid Ink Noodle Paella that was too wet and soggy.

Service was generally good although there was a slight hiccup with a delay in our last four orders.

Reasonable prices for wine and quite a decent selection.

Overall, was really pleased with our dinner and will return soon."
Overrated food,"I love spanish food and have ate countless times in singapore and overseas. This is one of my least favourite. We were surprised that the paella was served in under 10 minutes, as expected it was warm and not well cooked, no burnt base and some of the rice tasted sandy. The garlic prawns were a disappointment too. Overall, can’t say it wasn’t fresh but the taste was average. Can definitely get a better value spanish meal elsewhere"
An old favourite really delivered,"Eduardo and his team made us feel so welcome as always and the restaurant last night had a real buz. Whatever electricity was in the air clearly came from the kitchen. The team was on song last night. The foi gras, sardines and octopus were fantastic. The highlight for me however was the oxtail. So tasty. All accompanied by a great house wine. I really appreciate a restaurant that has good quality wine at reasonable prices.

We are looking forward to our next visit."
Excellent service and really,Excellent service and really yummy food. A bit expensive but extremely good value for what we ate. Such a good experience. I would recommend it highly!
Lovely Spanish food !,"Food is not too bad but slightly below my expectations. Been to many in Singapore like Olivia , Ola .. the food here is just ok. However the price is kind of expensive compare to the other place. Overall food quality is good. The squid ink paella is a little salty and the squid kind of over cooked. The grilled octopus was great but the fried broccoli kind of mediocre. The suckling pigs is not too bad but the meat has strong smell.. probably this is the way how the pork being prepared in Spain. The garlic prawn is so so as the meat tasted mushy than crunchy ! As usual the Jamon was great and the deep fry pepper was so good. The wine selection was great and attentive waiters!"
"Great Tapas, paella and stews.","Great Tapas, paella and stews. Service was good and a very cozy ambience. Very popular among expats and locals. Reservations is recommended. Has a bar side and dining area with limited private rooms available. The selection of tapas was extensive. We had the octopus with potatoes was tender and tasted awesome. The foie gras with scallops, veal cheeks, sardines and pork chops were all tasty and delicious. The black squid ink paella was served andante. Yummy! The seafood stew was rich and delicious. Price was on the higher end but the food was awesome. Will have to come back to try others in the menu. Extensive Spanish wine list with affordable to highly priced wines."
Tapas,Thoroughly enjoyable evening made better by the service from Darren. Nice Atmosphere. Great tapas. Fantastic service. Thanks
Friendly service and great food,"Everything was great right from the food to the service. Unfortunately, service staff didn't ask about my special request which I had indicated (if there was gluten free dishes and birthday celebration). Hence my rating of only 3 stars instead of 4."
Gorgeous Tapas. Perfect service.,"Gorgeous Tapas. 7 Tapas meal ( free choice) serving well 3 persons. Top professional service, extreme attention to detail, competent assistance with wine choice. Oxtail tapa: simply a dream!!!"
Genuine Spanish Food,You can tell that this restaurant is actually Spanish by the food and the atmosphere. The staff are also lovely!
Unbeatable Tapas Galore!,"Restaurant layout designed for fun parties with friends (bar area) and private romantic dinner (dining area). We are a family of 3 and we chose a 7 tapas menu of razor clams, mackerel with sea urchin, grilled broccoli & vegs, organic egg omelet, lamb chops, foie gras with scallops, veal cheeks meatballs - all dishes were delicious and reasonably sized - S$188++ for 7 tapas."
Great tapas and paella!,"There two sections to this place: the bar and restaurant side. The bar certainly has a casual feel vs restaurant which is fine dining.

4 of us ordered two appetizers, the 5-tapas tasting menu and a paella, and we were just right now.

The service was great and food was even better!"
Good traditional Spanish food with good service,"The decor & ambience is okay, nothing special but great by Singaporean restaurant standards. The food is good quality traditional Spanish food & the service is generally very good."
SUPERB,"I always pass by and the place is full. I finally decided to go and I was not disappointed. The service from the moment I was at the host stand to the finish was friendly, classy and knowledgeable. The food was good and well presented.

What more can you ask for ? My hat off to Binomio !"
Nice food at reasonable price,Both of us had 5 tapas plus 1 dessert and it was all we could eat. I love the tapas set as we get to try a variety of food and we feel full and satisfied. Every dish is tasty including the desserts. Wines are not overpriced. I’m a happy customer!
Probably the Best Spanish Restaurant & Tapas Bar in Singapore,"My colleague and I discovered this authentic Spanish restaurant and tapas bar while strolling in the Outram Park sector of the Tanjong Pagar neighbor in Singapore.

The indoor/outdoor seating of the tapas bar caught our initial attention and upon entry, we could not resist sitting at the tapas bar which enabled us to observe and experience the preparation of the delicious bar tapas.

We were especially delighted when one of the tapas bar attendants, encouraged us to taste the red wine Sangria with fresh fruits, which is exceptionally tasty.

We selected several items for the tapas bar menu to accompany our red wine Sangria; the ambiance and collective tastes of the Sangria and bar tapas is so authentic, we thought we were in Barcelona, Spain.

The dining area was completely full on a Friday evening, and we noticed the mouth watering paella being served to the dining guests.

This is an exceptional venue to take a special friend, colleague, partner or client to celebrate the joy of life, special special occasions and enjoy the culinary delights of Spain."
Spain in Singapore,Fantastic! Fabulous!! Michelin star presentation and service. Spain in Singapore! 4th visit over three years.. consistently excellent!
Great ambience and selection of food,"Three of us friends had dinner there on a weekday evening - vibrant lovely ambience, packed with customers, felt like a weekend evening (despite the overwhelming range of restaurants in the area). We had a sharing platter of cold cuts, croquettes, Gambia el aljillo, squid ink paella, lamb steak, and a pitcher of wine (3 glasses). Finished off with desserts: churros, almond tart, and a house social creation of ice creams. Chefs came to chat with us (we had a friend working there), friendly and warm atmosphere. Heard the dessert menu will undergo a great revamp soon!! Looking forward to the revamp."
Dining pleasure!,"Great service staff, great food esp the gambas and paella worth a try, had good reccomended Cava and wine."
A real Spanish restaurant!,"A real Spanish restaurant whose key staff are Spanish, serves authentic Spanish food cooked by Spanish chef, paired with wonderful Rioja wine. All a winning combination! Must try the Veal Cheeks meatballs and truffle potatoes and the wet rice ‘Rioja style’."
"Fairly priced, good quality food",I found the pricing of the restaurant pretty fair. Quality was high and food was tasty. Ambience was relaxed and homely.
Quality not commensurate with cost,"Felt the seafood was cooked poorly, rubbery, the construction of the tapas plates was not thoughtful for sharing, and there was nothing remarkable in the flavours. Some of the meat was well cooked but overall we were very disappointed- the reputation seems overblown."
Great food and great service,"We are planning to hold an event here, so came to try the food and wine. Every dish ordered was delicious, but I would especially commend the tiger prawns, the octopus and the squid ink paella. I wasn’t too excited about the fish & seafood stew, as well as the fried baby calamari - they were good but not great. Special shout out to Bertha for great service!"
Great food & service,Great food and excellent service! Thanks for keeping my 3 year old entertained! =D Oh! And I love the decorations at the restaurant too!
Excellent food and service but certainly pricey,"Our first visit to Binomio after several years. An evening here is expensive so make sure you go here for a special occasion. Service was excellent and we particularly appreciated the waiter suggesting that we had ordered too much.
All the dishes were great with the exception of the lamb shank which was a bit disappointingly and not particularly Spanish we didn't think. Loved everything else."
Real Spanish atmosphere!,Excellent location! The restaurant really pass you the true Spanish atmosphere. The food was delicious (we have chosen the convenient tapas menu) and the service has been perfect: fast servings and very kind personnel! We’ll come back!
Lunch dining,"Per serving too small for the price paid.. overall experience was great, staff were friendly and attentive."
Excellent,"I am obliged to write this comment after the wonderful dinner I has yesterday in this restaurant. I never ever go to Spanish restaurants out of Spain and I was utterly surprised by Binomio. Everything was delicious and perfect. My customers chose it and it was success. The idea is sharing all plates as Spaniards often do, so you can taste many things. The menu is extensive as it is the wine list with options and prices for everybody (considering a restaurant in Singapore). There is also a bar area if you want tapas without formal dinning settings. The staff was extra kind and helpful and the evening was just perfect. Bookings advised. It was fully booked.Congrats!"
Great food,"The food here is great, but the intense service, spoils the enjoyment of the whole experience. With staff, constantly walking past and peering at the plates and glasses and removing said, before drinks are finished and while people are still eating. This goes back to the way they have been trained. I assume it is to turn over the tables quicker, but makes the food become secondary."
They forgot my birthday!,We had arranged to go there and celebrate my birthday. It even showed up on the booking system but they completely ignored it and forget it. Won’t be going back again
Binomio,We had a wonderful experience for our 13th wedding anniversary. All chef’s created dishes are fantastic. The staff arranged the card and a surprised gift to us. Thank you so much.
Excellent tapas,The place to go for great tapas. We particularly enjoyed the octopus and prawns. A must eat each time we are there.
A very good dining experience,"We found this place while wandering about the Tanjong Pagar area. A beautifully styled restaurant, with white linen and friendly staff, we thought we should give it a try. The service was friendly and efficient and they have some good and interesting tapas options. They also have good knowledge of what is coeliac friendly and even had gluten free bread which was a bonus."
Highly recommend!,"Creative dishes, yet stayed authentic to its real roots.

Between the 4 of us, we ordered 5 choices of tapas and the squid ink with clams paella (45min to prepare so order it as a priority if you are keen to have it) - and two bottles of red wine. Then finished off with one the best almond tarts I've ever had and a plate of churros. All the dishes were excellent - well prepared and presented!

They have a good wine list that satisfied our very selective French company.

I can not fault any of it - and this is saying a lot too, as I love to cook and my family are published cooks internationally and we travel a lot and enjoy food.

The service is also very good - attentive and made sure our glasses are always filled with wine and we had water; served our dishes with a smile and answered any questions we had with a warm welcome.

The atmosphere is casual chic and comfortable. They also have a private room for groups if you want to celebrate a special occasion.

A must visit!"
Binomio never disappoints,"We were regulars at Binomio between 2014 and 2017 when we lived in Singapore. Went back last week as we were in Singapore and it was as splendid as we remembered. Outstanding hospitality, superb food (had the extensive tapas tasting selection) and the best value wine list in Singapore. Highly recommend Binomio if you are looking for a unique dining experience"
What a gem of a place!,"Had a dinner with some friends from overseas at Binomio and had such awesome experience. The staff are attentive and friendly and the environment warm and inviting.
The food though, is incredible!!! What made it even more special is that the Chef came over to greet us and take us through some of the plates. The prawns in butter .... just WOW!
Can not wait to return again.

Thanks Binomio for a wonderful evening, we will be back."
Delicious food,"Came here for a business dinner. We ordered a few tapas and also the squid ink paella. The paella was really really good and so were the tapas. Portions were also quite big

Staff were super friendly and very cozy atmosphere. I would come back for sure"
My favorite Spanish tapas,"I went to Binomio many times and tried a variety of dishes. I always sit at the bar and it has a very good atmosphere. The bar is an open-air but also they turn on the AC and fan for you so it isn´t hot at all also it not left the smell from the bar on your clothes. The decoration of the restaurant and music was nice and not too loud.

My favorite dish is Fritura Pescado (15$) which is Andalusian fried fish serves with lemon and aioli. The fishes always fresh and it was a perfect combination with lemon.

The second dish I would recommend is Gambas al Ajillo (16$) which is Prawns saute in olive oil, garlic, and parsley, serves with crunchy slices of bread which I love so much as I am Thai and we do not get used to it with the salinity from salt because we use fish sauce, I would recommend asking the chef for less salty. But if you like it that way then it is perfect for you.

The chef at the bar and staffs are very nice and friendly. You can also ask them about the ingredients of your dish or talk with them about their food and services. They are very kind and enthusiastically to service you.

There also have Spanish beer if you want to try. My friend said it was good. I am not a fan of beer but sangría was very good.

Good place and good food,"Binomio is one of those restaurants that you know it will not go wrong. Good food, good wine selection, good service. The overall environment is down to earth, and it’s a perfect option if you want to sit by the bar area and see the chef in action, by the open space window area if you want a drink or two or inside the well air-conditioned area with sit down tables if you want to have an intimate night.

Food wise, it is definitely value for money. Portions are big too! do order a 6 course tapas and it’s more than enough for 2! Their lamb cutlets are amazing! Must order."
GOOD ENVIRONMENT,"My second visit here, this time with The Lover’s family. The environment is cosy and warm, staff are friendly.

Food is not bad, average standard for tapas. Personally, it could be warmer. The roast pork took way too long to serve after being presented to us. I thought it was being sliced but turned out it was only hacked into 4, which couldn’t have taken long. This meant the meat was cold by the time we get to eat it.

Still open to try other tapas items :)"
Wonderful Experience,"The fact that Binomio has outlasted many restaurants in Singapore is testament to the professionalism of their team . Service is faultless, you are always made to feel special when you dine here. The Ambience is elegant . The food is consistently high quality ,simple and classic dishes .. The wine list is varied and is probably the best value in Singapore."
Best Spanish in Singapore,"I’ve been a few times in this restaurant and I love it. Food is consistent, very tasty and perfect for sharing.
Specially I love the “pates” selection with a personalised pate can with Chef face!
For my the best Spanish in town!
Big selection of wines not overpriced.
Staff well trained, very friendly, and helpful! I will keep coming back for sure!"
Dinner at Binomio,"Food standard has dipped compared to the previous visit. Staff were not attentive to the needs of customers. When we realised that they have a dessert menu and politely informed the waitress who handed us the bill to let us have a look at the menu, she irritably walked off without acknowledging our request and handed the desserts menu to another staff to pass to us. We understand that the restaurant is busy but that does not mean that we have to endure service that is below the mark."
Binomio,First time experience for chef creative dishes. It was really amazing! Highly recommend smoked mackerel.
Great evening with loved ones,"Binomio has never failed to satisfy me, my friends and family for the past 6 years. Always my number 1 option to recommend to friends who are looking for authentic Spanish food and wines. The venue is versatile that it is great for date nights but also comfortably accommodates small to medium sized private gatherings. If you book early enough for a group of people, they can also create a set menu for the group and cater for the special needs like dietary restrictions and all. I have tried it and the price was very reasonable for what we had. The portion was as always very generous and the presentation of the dishes adds extra happiness for foodies like me."
A——mazing food and excellent service,"There is one thing i enjoy the most living in Singapore is going to different restaurants to explore new menu and good food! Binomio was one of the best spanish restaurant i visited so far!

We had course meal and all of them tasted so gooood!!
The most important part i care about for food is the fresh ingredient (i wanna have my food worth my time and $$$ haha) and i could tell that the ingredient was super fresh because it’s seafood otherwise it wouldn’t have tasted this good...and not only that each course was visually amusing which i think it’s a big yes...you eat with your eyes too right? I recommend two dishes out of all which was quite a hard to choose tho - Smoked Mackerel with seaweed....topped with caviar and uni ❤️ How good is that!! Everything i love is in one dish! And the other one is seared foie gras with scallop decorated with good amount of truffle slices and cute edible flower...! I must say the chef has artistic talent as well!!

And the last one i must say that complete the meal as a whole food experience was the staff service. The chef came to explain each meal and even tho we were the last customer to leave the restaurant the staffs didn’t hurry us until we didn’t realised it was almost pass the restaurant closing time.

I would definitely will go back with my friends again!"
Well represented,"A Spanish treat that will not disappoint. That’s the overall take I had after walking out. The only criticism I felt was the hot food could have been hotter. Manager, Chef, and Service crew were friendly and attentive."
Lovely set meal for a large group,We were able to secure a private setting. The food was tasty. The service was friendly and attentive.
Binomio,"The food was good as always, but we are seated by the kitchen door and came out full of food smell. 7 tapas menu with additional dishes, where 7th was apparently forgotten till we checked. If it came out earlier, we’d have enjoyed better. The order was not right."
Binomio Restaurant - 6 stars Fantastic,"This restaurant was fantastic on all levels, quality of food, service, pace of service, wine list The ambience was great - the quality of the food was excellent maintaining the true roots of Spanish flavours and dishes with a modern twist"
Wedding Anniversary Celebration,"We decided to do a Spanish dinner to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The waiter gave a fantastic a 5 course tapas and we enjoyed every single item thoroughly. Each item was delicious and generously portioned. Our fave items were the crab and cod caviar , and octopus with potatoes. The ambience was semi formal. We are thinking of returning."
Nice food,"Very tastey food, customer service is very friendly and helpful but food make take up some time. Portions are pretty good and above all delicious."
Food is still good although the squid ink pasta seemed better first time round!,"Bustling as usual, the food spelt wonderful even as you walk into the restaurant! We had a nice corner table for 4 however, it was hot...probably the down lights and not enough ac reaching that corner, so it felt uncomfortable for me throughout! Food was good, service was a little careless and not as attentive as before, and the hostesses have forgotten the charm element - service with a smile :)"
Great dinner,"Came here on recommendation, and we were certainly not disappointed. The tapas were all delicious and had a real authentic spanish flavour. For main we all decided on the Paella on also here we were excited, just perfect! Service was fast and attentive."
Authentic with great taste and service,Great place with a wonderful long bar when you come in and a beautiful setting inside . Perfect service and a great team that pays attention - food really really good and with taste - definitely a return !
Repeat visit not so good,"Not great. Really need to ensure that dishes are executed better, go out hot and are properly seasoned. Would not return after a visit where definitely more misses than hits. Was disappointing after having a positive experience in the past."
Nothing not to love,First time here and love it! Celebrated my friend’s birthday last night and there was nothing we can find fault with. Love the tapas which have generous portion and the seafood paella was so yummy! I already made plans with my friends to go back again to try out the rest of the menu.
Best tapas ever!,I went to this place yesterday evening with some friends and had the best tapas I have ever had!!! I often eat tapas and go regularly to Spain ( mainly Barcelona and San Sebastián) and I must say these tapas were fabulous! The desserts were really good as well. I will definitely come back and will try the restaurant menu next time.
Fancy place but food was under par,"We ordered the octopus and calamari which were large portions to justify the price the tag but lacked seasoning (under salted) and were not that impressive in taste. The squid ink paella was once again large in portion size but series lacked flavor.

Not what we expected at all. Going to FOC would be a better option"
Consistently Excellent,Tapas bar last night. Binomio never fails to deliver. Been coming here since it opened and it still remains one of the best all round eateries in Singapore. Authentic Spanish food in a vibrant atmosphere. Excellently managed by Eduardo. Binomio is faultless.
Binomio,"excellent as usual....great service, wonderful staff......always a joy to go back there The food quality standard has been great ever since i visited the place 3 years ago"
I’ll have nice a nice memory of Binomio,"Great both service and authentic Spanish food, I went with a vegetarian colleague, and we ended up very happy to have chosen Binomio."
Enjoyable dinner!,"Food is good, service is good! Our group totally enjoyed our dinner. The tapas set is value for money whereby we chose 5 tapas out of the tapas list. Ambience was good and nice selection of Spanish wines."
Excellent Spanish food and service,I am so impressed with this restaurant. The food is AMAZING! One of the very best Spanish restaurants in Singapore. Great for a big group or just for 2. Will definitely be back.
Business Lunch,A nice Spanish restaurant in a central location Tanjong Pagar. A good menu which will satisfy your appetite for meat and paella. Acceptable wine list. During lunch time there is specific menu that enable you to enjoy a set menu at reasonable prices.
Authentic Spanish on the island!,Absolutely incredible! Best Spanish in Singapore especially as the head chef and the head waitress were both from Spain - super authentic.
Sensational Dinner with friends,"Exceptional service, and the food was even better. We were at the restaurant for over 4 hours on Saturday evening and everything was perfect. They were closing the restaurant around us (where did the time go) but we were never rushed out the door.
The food really was exceptional, the garlic prawns an absolute highlight, raw tuna with avocado a close 2nd. And the wine was really good too. Perfect service from the staff made it a night to remember."
Good service and good food,The restaurant staff was very nice. All dishes were delicious. The paella was too big to two persons after having three tapas.
Tapas Night to remember,They have a good selection of tapas and wine to go with it. Reasonable price for the tapas pairing set! Good service from the crew too
Decent Lunch,"A impromptu lunch with friend at Binomio. We both had the set lunch which cost $101. The set included a starter, a main and a dessert. We ordered additional coffee. We had Sirloin steak for the main course. Overall, pleasant experience and the portion was just perfect."
Tapas at the Bar,"Met a friend for a bite and sat at the bar, enjoyed some glasses of quality wine, together with a couple of very nice and freshly crafted tapas from the extensive tapas menu. None of our six dishes was disappointing. Price, as is in Singapore, wasn't cheap, but good value for money."
Excellent food and service,It was our first visit for the special occasion of Valentines’ day. We got a good table and service was polite and warm. We had a wonderful dinner with well-prepared food and wine.
Very good Tapas although service needs improvement,"All the tapas were delicious, we ordered the 8 tapas for $95. Croquettes, Atlantic octopus, and fried baby calamari were all very good. Service was a little slow as it was busy/ we had a corner seat so it was hard to get the servers attention. Overall a good experience and would go again!"
Great meal,"Had dinner yet last night, service was efficient and fast service too!! Place was busy! Food was great and very well made by the chef!! Will be back soon!!"
Great Dining Experience,We visited with some friends whilst working in Singapore.Food was excellent and we had great service.Food was on a modern take on tapas and was tasty and well presented.Good choice of Spanish wine. Will visit again next time we are back in Singapore.
Nice but too fast,Even after requesting for slow pace the food still arrived very quick. It was nice but hot food could have been warmer especially the paella
Binomio,"Binomio is perhaps the best Spanish restaurant I have ever visited in Singapore, considering quality and value of both the food and the service"
Weekly evening dinner,"We had a dinner at Binomio during the weekday and it was very very good.
Very tasty , size of the tapas is not small , far from that.
Perfect service.
Large wine list with reasonable prices but limited choice for only glasses.
Better to book in advance."
Beware of over ordering and indulging on the richness.,"This was a last minute option for our date night and it was a little bit of a mixed bag. First of all the service, ambience and atmosphere were all great. We were recommended a pretty nice bottle of red with our meal too. The problem was that half our dishes were terrific and the other half was a combination of weird, too rich or just too much. It's a good place but considering the amount you get for their 5 dishes option, better to make it a group outing."
Monday Lunch,"Ordered the jamon, grilled chorizo, clams with artichokes, veal meatballs, bone marrow and churros for dessert. Admittedly we over-ordered but was keen to try out the various dishes. I like that the jamon came with a side dish of chopped tomatoes to compliment. Really enjoyed the clams with artichokes too, very clean and fresh. The meatballs and bone marrow were heavy dishes and started to fill up at this point but they were delicious. Atmosphere was relaxed and service was good."
Very nice Spanish food dinner!,Very good recommendation from the manager on both wine and food. Authentic Spanish food and delicious! Service is supra! Will go back for dinner next tine in Singapore.
Overpriced and tasteless paella,The paella we had wasn’t flavourful enough. The portion for the tapas was also rather small. Overall we felt it’s overpriced.
Best spanish food since I lived in Spain,"Easily the best spanish food in Singapore, and for me and my wife it has now become an all-time favourite.

We absolutely love it.

Best advice i can give is to be aware that if you book in the restaurant/dining part (as opposed to the bar), they limit how many Tapas you can order. I guess to maximise the dining room revenue/use.

But if you book at the bar then you get Tapas to your hearts content.

Booking is now via the website Chope FYI"
Exceptional dining experience,"We were well looked after by the Bionomio staffs during our team Xmas lunch yesterday. They put us in a room and kept the alcohol flowing even after the kitchen and restaurant had closed. We eventually moved to the bar area and they were so generous with platters of cheese and nibbles for us.
Food was exceptional, and we were blown away by the service. Needless to say this will not be our last visit there :)"
Good Spanish food with extensive premium Spanish wine list and sherry,"First off, the place is upscale dining restaurant. Prices aren't cheap but they focus on fresh ingredients and letting the produce speak for themselves without over doing the dish. It isnt the most spectacular Spanish food and tapas I've had but it's pretty standard and brings all the tapas dishes you'd get in Spain like the croquettes, the padron peppers, octopus on a bed of potatoes dusted with paprika, suckling pig and the hams.

Their wine cellar and wine list is quite impressive. Its Singapore so expect to pay double if not triple for the same bottle you'd have in Spain but they do seem to keep it under good storage conditions in this hot and humid Singapore.

Pretty good dining experience for Singapore and takes you back a little to Spain. But you do pay a premium on everything here. It's worth it if you want a classy, white tablecloth table side service type of evening out."
Fantastic Spanish Restaurant,"There's a couple of reviews talking about the food being pricey and expensive. I think the point is that in this area of Singapore the restaurants are proper restaurants with good service. Eduardo the manager on the night served our table and recommended the order and quantity and suggested the wine.

I have to say the wine recommendation was excellent and the portions and choice of the tapas selected for our table was good too. Everyone had a great experience so we could focus on our business discussions. Nice easy ambience as well.

For 11 people we paid about $800. Again, it's a full service restaurant so this is not a place for cheap eats."
Brillant Spanish Restuarant,We chose to sit in the bar area and it was an excellent decision as we got to relax by the in/out windows enjoying superb tapas. And I have lived in Spain and can can guarantee the authenticity of the cuisine.
An eternal favourite,"This is one of our favourite restaurants. We love to sit at the bar, chat with the chef and have some tapas and drink some wine. Food is great, presentation is beautiful and we are never, ever disappointed."
