Breakfast at Prive ACM,Enjoyed the environment as it was quiet and not too many people. Waiters were attentive and fast. I like that the name used for reservation is written on a plate and placed at the table. Liked the Açai Bowl. Still thinking about it after 2days!
Good food and fantastic service,"My husband and I celebrated our 35th Anniversary at Prive ACM on 17 December 2022 with a group of friends. We really enjoyed ourselves, helped by the good food and attentive service of all the staff at the restaurant.

Our requests for additional items of food or additiinal cutlery and plates were attended to promptly. We were also impressed by the patience of the staff when we initially took some time to decide on what items to order.

Knowing that it was our anniversary, the staff of the restaurant also took a photo for my husband and I, which they gave to us together with a card saying ""Congratulations"", signed by the staff.

Thank you, staff of Prive ACM, for helping my husband and I have a really pleasant experience at dinner. The food was good and the service was excellent!"
Breakfast visit,The food is amazing and the service was great. The eggs were perfectly poached and the muffin fresh. It’s a beautiful location with good views. The ACM is also worth a visit as it is so well curated.
Great location right at the Asian Civilization Museum,"Great location, beautiful ambience, ACM is always great to visit. Food and beverages were good and value for money. Very relaxed and chill place"
excellent service,I was very impressed with the service from the restaurant... the team go out of their way to try to help.
Ambience and Food,We were there for brunch. Is a great place to have breakfast and brunch. Nice ambience and good food and coffee.
seafood not fresh,ordered the slipper lobster linguine which was not fresh. they offered me another slipper lobster which was equally bad- meat was soft and mushy. i changed my order for a salad and thankfully it was a lot better. kudos to them for service recovery as they did not charge me for the replaced salad.
We'll definitely be back,Pleasant family dining experience with kids-friendly menus and option of dining indoors or al fresco. Food is generally good. Though we had 1 pasta dish which was overseasoned service recovery was immediate and the chef promptly replaced it.
Dreadful- even for terrible singapore service,"Only gave it 2 because its a nice spot on the deck outside, But honestly , how terrible was the service ! No cutlery, no water- had to go inside three times to get attention (as the servers were careful to wonder by but not look our way). The food choice is terrible ( I had leathery chicken rice with stale, dry rice). Crap wines at ludicrous prices."
Prive ACM is best avoided,"I have been a regular to Prive; this was one of my worst visits in the last 3 years.

1. The table we were given had sofas with dirty cushions (stains all over them) & uncomfortable (too low for the table). Luckily the staff changed the table for us.
2. I asked for draught beer as stated in the menu, and asked for the HH options; there was no draught beer available !
3. The staff gave me Tiger crystal beer bottles instead. He had said S$ 10 for a 750 mL bottle; i thought that was a good deal. Imagine my shock when he gave me the small pint bottle (330 mL). That is nothing but misinformation and cheating.
4. We had guests who got what they wanted. However, the food was ordinary. I had nasi goreng. It tasted awful.
5. Our guest wanted a scoop of chocolate ice cream; we were told after a few minutes the stock had melted since there was a power disruption. Really ? So we went for an alternate item (tiramisu), but didn't like it.

For sure I don't plan to go there again."
A mediocre place,"By the Singapore standards this place is mediocre. The service is slow, and not particularly friendly. In Singapore you expect the staff to smily and be super polite. Not here. The food is mediocre. The drinks are not bad, but overpriced. The location is good, in the ACM, and on the Riverwalk, but within short distance you can easily find better places."
service needs improvement,Food wise all as expected. Service wise either hire experienced servers or invest in training. It was difficult to understand the server.
Dinner at Prive ACM - Lousy Dinner,The food was bad. Tasteless. It was not worth the pricing. Outdoor seating area was dirty. It wasn’t a good dinner experience. Unlikely to visit again.
Very Dry Nasi Goreng.,We truly expected better when we placed our order. The Nasi Goreng was extremely dry and we left most of it on the plate. I had to share my Mediterranean salad and milkshake so my husband would feel like he had eaten.
Cockroach central,"I ordered chicken rice, finished most of it and out of my tray (the timber veneer had cracked at the base of the tray and was lifting off) crawled a cockroach almost onto our table. At the screams, it fled back into the cracked veneer of the tray. Disgusting. They did not charge me for my meal, but at the end when my friend was paying, the manager then gave her the wrong (and much higher bill) from another table, before this error was spotted by our third friend.

Never again. ACM should get in a better run and far more hygenic restaurant"
Venue & food,"Food was poor, the satay was dry and in different proportions, some sticks were half the size of the rest. The nasi goreng were tasteless. Premise were unkempt, not a comfortable place to dine in. The service staff who served our table couldn’t understand a word we said in English"
Good food and great riverside view,Salad was fantastic and generous. A little more sauce would meet the mark. Nice exclusive riverside view if you choose outdoor seating. Perfect if you could put in a little bit of care on furniture.
Ambiance is great,Ambiance of the place is really great and the food is decently good for the price paid. Service can be a bit better but it was still acceptable.
Lovely breakfast,The decor was quite grand and I liked that they had a lot of vegan and vegetarian options. Had breakfast here and chose the granola with fruit. It was very nice and had a decent portion of fruit and was ample. Right by the river too with an outdoor setting.
Dinner,"The burrito was cold, the steak was tough and overcooked. Great view and nice drinks but poor food. Service was fine - polite staff"
Overpriced + disappointing,A disappointing experience. Food was overpriced and disappointing. Felt like a “takeaway” lunch served on a plate. Service was poor - wasn’t busy but found it hard to get attention.
"Good ambience, great turmeric finger Soy Latte.","Turmeric GINGER Soy Latte was great. Super ""gao"". No diluted stuff here. But, I was disappointed that I was not allowed to buy the delicious looking cakes at half price just because I already paid for my latte."
Impossible meat!,I like to eat just before the dinner time. Food is well prepared and meet expectation. Both impossible meat meal is good.
Disappointed experience,"The portion of the laksa was very disappointing, it was so much less than pre-covid time. When we asked the service staff, we were told that the portion has always been like this since pre-covid - this is certainly not true as we were regular customers prior to covid and laksa was always our favourite. Ordered 2 pieces of cakes too, the cake was so thin that it looked like it’s going to fall anytime. Nearly half of the size of precovid time. We definitely appreciate the difficulty of restaurants due to covid and inflation, but we would rather the restaurant increase the price by say 10%, 20%, instead of just cutting the portion like this and yet still told the customers that the portion has always been like that. Overall disappointing experience and hope that the restaurant will take customers’s feedback and make some improvements going forward."
Disappointing Lunch,Nasi Goreng was bland & tasteless. Satay & chicken were not flavorful at All. Egg was not looking pretty & runny. My Kopi was served spilt on the side. My Friend requested for Extra Spicy for her Pasta & Waitress say it could Not be done. A Real Let down.
Wonderful,"We've been to Privé @ the ACM several times. This time though by far, the service and food were excellent. A small celebration was catered to with great attitude."
Poor service with an attitude,When we waited for a very long time for our (simple) drinks the waitress did not acknowledge that but told us with an attitude why we were wrong. Unacceptable behaviour.
Cakes,"Very nice ambiance, specially at the terrace by the river. Excellent selection of fast dishes and sandwiches. As well as cakes and fruit juices. I made my stop to enjoy some dessert Carrot Cake and Lemon Merengue Pie. Both were delicious. I recommend either if you visit ACM or during a walk by the river."
Delicious Pastas and great view of the singapore river,"This the second time visiting. Now on total, me and my girlfriend had 4 pastas. They are so savoury. Dining good food with a great view with your loved ones, I would definitely recommend price acm"
Great service and view of Singapore River,I really enjoyed the service and view at the restaurant. The staff is very friendly and accommodating to our seating request. Great al fresco area with direct view of Singapore River and Boat Quay. The food is nice as well.
Nice lunch,It was my friend’s birthday and the restaurant gave him a delicious chocolate coconut cake. Their salads were nice & service staff were helpful and obliging.
Good place for a lovely lunch,"The restaurant was quiet when we first arrived, we stayed there for nearly two hours. the waiting staff was polite and easily available, and didn't rush us for anything. Food was generally okay, portions are quite big."
Chillax with friends,We celebrated a birthday in a memorable way from Prive ACM. May all your dreams come true with PriveACM.
Nice location and atmosphere,"Very nice, calm atmosphere with a riverside view. Breakfast options are all good and tasteful, with very welcoming and good staff."
Interesting dining experience,"Came here on a recommendation. Ordered nasi goreng, salmon and a burger. Portions were a good size but taste of the dishes and the overall experience was a little lacking.

We were given seats near the entrance which was a little hot, plus overall service was rather slow. Maybe would have been better to come in the evening."
Excellent - food and experiencce,Really enjoyed lunch at Prive ACM last weekend with friends. Great food and helpful service. The vegetarian options are a delight. Thoroughly enjoyed the vegan Hainanese chicken rice.
Visit during CNY Feb 2022.,Visited today for lunch and service level was acceptable even though they’re short of staff. Reservation was definitely required as the cafe was fully booked (aircon area) with some customers sitting at the open-air area. Mgr Beverly is courteous and running the cafe well.
Wonderful food and ambience,Visited the ACM outlet for the first time and it was very pleasant with a quiet and calm ambience with delicious food and a view of the Singapore River. Will definitely return again!!
Chilled Evenings at ACM,"Relaxed, calming, pretty settings - good food, decent wine selection. This place always leaves us feeling ….. Aaaahhhhh :-)"
Pleasant dining experience,The staff are polite and friendly. Made our dining experience a pleasant one. Nice ambience. We also enjoyed our food.
"Excellent service ang beautiful environment, we were there early morning, the view and sunlight are fascinating","Quiet and spacious, good for two to chat, i love the view and sunlight in the morning in the resturant, staff is friendly and helpful."
Perfect evening,"The outside area of Prive ACM is one of my favorite spots to enjoy the sunset in the Business District. The vegetarian options on the menu are plenty, and omnivores also can be easily satisfied.
Tonight I felt that the service was understaffed right when we arrived, but soon there was help coming from a manager or a staff from other area.
This didn't impact our great experience.
Thanks for the great evening."
Nice ambience with delicious food,"Had my New Year Eve dinner here and really love the ambience, delicious food and friendly serving staff. Highly recommend this place."
Vegan options are amazing,Vegan friendly place! Parents who loves Asian cuisine loves the burger. Christmas special is good too! 6 stars friendly service crew
Pasta and Salmon dish were too acidic,There was too much lemon taste in the Salmon dish. It was a pity as the salmon was cooked really well.
Good service from Janice,"Despite the crowd and the inclement weather, Janice remained patient and accommodating to our requests. She continually checked on us and apologised for the long wait for the food, which we requested to be replaced due to the rain. Thank you Janice :-)"
Food was bad,The crayfish pasta was salty and the seafood was not fresh. Cabonara was terrible. The food really sucks and no worth the money
Pleasant river-side dining,"short walk from Raffles Place mrt, if you are going by public transport (walk across Cavenagh Bridge). service was prompt. requested outdoor seating and was at the mercy of the evening sun for a few minutes althought it was breezy throughout. quite a number of vegan choices on the menu but i wasnt going for those. steak was good, house red was good (HH $6). can give the desserts a miss. wish they have more small bites."
Nice ambience Yummy Food,"The food is yummy. Great selection of vegeterian food. Service is top notch. Brought my 10 yrs old boy for lunch, he enjoy the fries n dessert. Nice ambience too"
Friendly and fun service!,"Visiting Prive after so long and their service has only gotten better!

One of the staff, William, who is also the captain, attended to us all the way, cracking jokes, making us laugh and making our whole dining experience pleasant.

The absence of music did not bring down the friendly and approachable vibes Prive always has"
Perfect place.,Perfect view. Less crowd. Quite and intimate place. Food are nice as well. Superb. Waiters are very accomodating.
So many vegan options!!,I’m vegan and rarely get much choice at restaurants. I could eat over half the things on this menu and so many desserts were vegan too!! I had the Mexican salad and it was great. Staff was super friendly as well.
Good food and friendly staff,"The food is pretty good, and the staff very friendly. Ambience is good too. Perhaps one detail to add, the water given should be iced instead"
Dinner with friends,Good food n good service from William the captain. It would be great to have special discount on cakes after 8.30pm
Great staff despite busyness,Food was alright but staff were awesome and made the best out of a challenging service in the hot outdoors. Mad props to William for being proactive and professional
A most wonderful lunch,"We came here for lunch after taking the DUCKtours as a continuation of our rediscover Singapore tour. Even though we had to sit indoors as it was a blistering hot day, we still had a decent view of the river, and some doors are open for ventilation with ample social distancing. Food is great, with a good selection of usual brunch fare, Asian and vegetarian. I recommend the Nasi Goreng as the satay is authentic. The most wonderful part about the lunch is when Captain William gave my mum a birthday surprise that surprised all of us! I have made a note under our lunch reservation and clean forgotten about it, but apparently the restaurant did not. The way my mum’s eyes lit up when Captain William sang her the birthday song is something that money cannot buy. It is a tough time for mum as she is currently going through cancer and you have done something really special. Thank you so much, we will be back."
Good food & service,"We were there with two little ones. Despite their mischief, the staff was very patient and friendly. The breakfast was delicious."
"Great food, service and ambience",I really enjoyed my chill birthday celebration here at Prive ACM. Thank you for the great food and excellent service. Hope to visit soon!!! 🥰🎉
Awesome Birthday!!!!,"The entire Prive ACM team is very warm, accomodating and super friendly bunch! I always have fun coming over for dinners and drinks! To the Prive ACM Team, thank you so much for the sweet birthday gesture! See you guys soon!"
GOOD DINING ENVIRONMENT,"Very good environment for business meeting and social gathering, highly recommend. Staff are also friendly and approachable, they take care of your needs and are able to make good recommendations when we were unable to decide what to eat."
Birthday Celebration,"We sat by the beautiful Singapore River! Impeccable service by Captain William and his Team. We had Pulled Pork Burger, Roast Pork Aglio Olio and Grass fed Beef Burger. It was amazing. We will be back (-:"
Cosy and excellent service crew,"Nice Ambience with yummy dishes… We love the satay, Yakiniku Bowl and many more. Also great service by the service crew who always come and check on us for our food and drinks"
Excellent food excellent service,Warm smiles amazing vegan selection! Prive make my transition to vegan easy. Next favourite place for breakfast lunch and dinner
Dinner and Drinks,"Lovely Atmosphere and can't go beyond the hospitality of William, who is the captain here. Felt like part of the Prive family and have already booked to be back with other friends in 3 days time."
"Nice staff, great service, good vibes","The atmosphere was nice, and the staff was really helpful. The food was quick to arrive too! Overall, a great experience."
"Excellent food, service and ambience","Food were very flavourful, fresh and healthy... Captain William was super attentive, kind, humourous... The ambience was romantic and calm... Perfect for family gathering, it was mother's day and they provided a mother's day card template for kids to colour and then gift it to mothers... Very thoughtful..."
Love the place,Great place and super combination with the ACM. Love the happy hour from 18:00-20:00. Had the impossible gyoza and the Cesar salad.
Excellent service,"Went to Prive at ASM on 4/05/21 and the food was great. More importantly, the 2 gentlemen that served us were very professional, attentive and attended to all our needs. Overall, we would like to extend our thanks to them and will definitely be back at the Prive ASM branch!"
Great service!!,"Went there for a birthday celebration w close friends and family. The staff was really friendly, got birthday cake slice, candle, card with a Polaroid photo as well!! I was very touched! And ofc as usual the food was great! Love their plant based options :)))"
Never disappointed,"Love Prive ! The staff are warm, friendly and super professional. Love the healthy food options including lots of vegan options. Our favourite place to go out as a family. Thank you Prive for leading the way by offering plant based food and showing the world that plant based food can be varied, delicious and even include lots of sweet treats. Keep going and spread the brand as much as possible. How to see some outside Singapore soon."
Great service,Service staff were super accommodating and such a a sweet gesture to present a birthday card for the birthday boy too
Great ambience and setting.,Great ambience and setting. Attentive and efficient service. Special shout out to Janice for being so patient and understanding with our noisy kids!
"Food is tasty, ambience is good.","Thank you Prive ACM for the pleasant dining experience - was a hot evening (after rain).

Chilli crab spaghetti was good, though the Impossible Marinana balls could be served hotter? Salmon fish was grilled till crisp but the meat was slightly on the tough texture.

But overall was a pleasant/romantic dining experience. Thank you again."
Amazing food and Atmosphere,"Came to this Cafe/Restaurant after visiting the ACM, it’s a. great place to sit down and enjoy a meal after a long walk in the museum. Staff are very friendly and the place has very quick and good service! I came with my mother who is allergic to Cows milk, and was pleasantly surprised to find many of the items on the menu were vegan. this is quite rare so it’s lovely to see diversity in the foods. I ordered a linguine mushroom carbonara and it was amazing! It was vegan too! they use soy milk instead of creams. everything is clearly marked on the menu of allergy or dietary restriction info so it makes it easier to see what you can and can’t eat. my mother ordered the Impossible burger and it tasted amazing! Pulse it was HUGE! You could tell it was plant based but it tasted awesome! 10/10 would bring friends here!"
"Excellent, impeccable service..","We made a reservation via chope, a change of booking to a slight later time was easier updated via chope.. service was immpeccable, staff was really friendly and was checked in on us a couple of times during our meal. Food looks and taste awesome, we are really pleased that they accomodated a request to change one of our sauce.. looking forward to another trip there soon! Just a note if for people who are driving, the carpark is at Parliament House, it was a 5 - 10 mins slow walk distance away. It didn't bother us even though we were there on a stormy rainy night.."
Lovely service and delicious food at Prive.,"Very happy experience, delicious food at Prive! Our fav is the pork belly Aglio Olio Spaghetti. Must try! Service is prompt and friendly. Very chill vibes at this cafe. Highly recommended!"
Best anniversary dinner,Thank you Beverly and her staff for making the most memorable anniversary dinner for my fiancee and me. Really enjoyed the wonderful dinner and I would gladly come back here again. A+++
What a Lovely Way to Start Our Weekend!,Great hospitality from the manager and staff. A superb variety of both vegan and non-vegan selection! Sunlit and airy interior. What more can we ask for ? Loved it here 🥰
Excellent food and service,"Excellent food and service. Love the Tracy’s favorite salad a lot and it is really a large portion, good for sharing."
Menu has been thinned down - ACM location nice,"Menu has been thinned down and plates watered down. No more satay’s (as a dish’s or as part of nasi goreng) or fish & chips and a few other ones.
Waiter managed to take my plate and cutlery while I was still eating and grumbled when I asked it back.
Prive has decayed in just the last year to a point that there is nothing special to go for."
Birthday Dinner,"Staff were friendly and service was superb! Appreciate the birthday card with group photo, and special message from the staff!"
Amazing service,"My second time here after visiting ACM. Friendly staff, amazing service, awesome ambience, great music too! The food selection is pretty good as well. Though the kopi can be slightly stronger;)"
"Nice place, good food and service",Nice place with good ambience. Good food and attentive service. Good for family with kids. Worth a visit.
"World's best salad, great burger, great service from Captain William!","Always been a favourite place for afternoon kopi when we worked in Maybank Tower and good happy hour deals too but wanted to comment today after Captain William looking after us and enjoying a tasty burger with delicious salad and the show stopper, Tracy's salad which is one big bowl of joy! I've had this a few times at various Prive's and it's an absolute winner. Got to be the best salad, full of so much variety and goodness, in the world!!!"
Good vibes on Sunday Morning Breakfast,We came here to our pre hotel check-in. The staff were friendly and nice. Food portions were reasonable. Only sense good vibes :)
Disappointed pre theatre dinner,"On 13 Mar 2021, my friend and I decided to dine at Privé ACM as we were going to catch a theatre performance at Victoria concert hall.

We were severely disappointed with the food that we ordered and below is my feedback:

1) Chicken satay was very dry and lacked depth in flavour.
2) Chicken rice had too much moisture and came to me all in lumps.
3) Ice tea hardly had any flavour of tea.

I would have expected more from a restaurant like Prive as these are simple basic hawker fare food. I short, I could feel the lack of passion from the chef."
Amazing vegan food!,"They have a lot of vegan food, which is so good! The service is excellent and we will visit again for sure!"
Savouring Each Bite,"I was looking to get some lunch after browsing through the exhibits and as this restaurant was in the building, I thought to myself...why not? I have eaten at their other outlets so the brand was not new to me.

Outdoor tables are available, so one can enjoy the scenery and people-watch, if you can deal with the humidity and would like to get out from the cool environment indoors. I was led to a table that was relatively shaded by a huge tree. Water was served immediately without me having to ask and a physical menu was presented, quite different from some restaurants where QR codes seem to be the norm.

The menu has both Asian and Western dishes. I chose the tried and tested Hainanese Chicken Rice. In my haste, I forgot to mention my preferences. Luckily, though the meat was served with its skin, which I had to remove, the portion was from the part of the chicken I liked, so I need not have to deal with the bones. The list of desserts are plentiful, unlike some restaurants with a limited number. Tiramisu did the trick for me, but I felt it was slightly runny, perhaps due to it being served outdoors or to the fact that it had been sitting at the counter for awhile, waiting to be picked up. As a matter of fact, there was a delay, and I thought my order was forgotten.

I like that the staff made it a point to swing by constantly, checking up on me. Often, one sits and rushes through our meals, not allowing ourselves time to savour each bite. I spent almost an hour there, all well worth it, I must say."
Good vibes!,Delectable food and drinks with friendly and kind servers. It was a delight and a fun experience! - the coke float couple
Good Service & food,"Outstanding service and food catered to us. Will definitely visit this outlet again, thank you for transferring us outdoor despite us booking for indoor table. Very accommodating team from the managers to the service staffs."
Good for anyone who wanna have a good meal and chill-lax,Lovely location with great ambience. We love the selection of both western and local dishes that are made with quality. Happy Hour in place till 8pm and we enjoyed the genuine and attentive service
Nice ambience and wonderful steak,Brought my wife to spent the evening to celebrate Vday and was a great choice. Enjoyed the nice ambience and the steak was fantastic. Recommend to go with your loved one.
Decadent,"In your best interest, Owner and Cook should change job. Try anything else but hospitality. Also, according to Chope policy, this review should be at least 100 characters long but better not to further interfere."
Delightful,Great food. Nice ambience. Friendly staff. By the riverside on a nice day. Vegetarian friendly and great desserts.
"Beautiful views, good alfresco dining vibes",We came here after visiting the ACM. Make a reservation in advance if you can and ask for a table by the river. The staff were kind and we enjoyed our food.
Excellent Service and food,"Had a wonderful experience today at Prive thanks to Janice. My family came down for a dinner this evening and was met with an emergency as a member was unwell and nearly fainted! Without hesitation, she immediately attended to us with patience, care with utmost professionalism. We are extremely grateful to her. In addition, all other staff were extremely friendly, food was also of high quality and catered to our vegan diets. As frequent patrons of Privé, we will definitely continue to support this chain. Thank you once again to Privé group and Janice especially for making our evening such a lovely one!"
Beautiful ambience and wonderful staff,The staff service were really wonderful and attentive. Food was great as always. Was surprised to receive a handwritten birthday card from the staff Thank! Thank you for the complimentary birthday cake too.
"Pretty, quiet weekday afternoon visit",I love how this area along the riverfront is quiet in the offpeak hours. I came in at 430 pm for a snack and coffee. Only two groups were present. The food and coffee came promptly. First time trying the plantbased muffin. Hushbrowns and musclun salad at the side. The patty tasted like juicy sausage patty!
Outstanding Service,We visted the outlet after a museum tour and was delightfully greated by yani who ushered us to our seats. The brunch was outstanding and the service given by jessica and beaverly were nothing but exceptional. Beaverly even went out of her way to check up on our comfortably midway. 5 stars from us to the team.
Good service and food,It was a busy night but the service staff were prompt and friendly. Our steak and salmon main dishes were nice. Very happy.
