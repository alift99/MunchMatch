Best party place in the east,"Amanda, Shaun, shafiee, and phil were amazing! Never had a better time! Will definitely be back! And so should you! Xoxo"
Disappointing experience,It’s my first time at the Lime House East Coast; heard quite a bit of review and decided to try it. Greeted by a moody staff that doesn’t look or sound enthused to served! Totally disappointed by the attitude!
Great service and ambience,"Folks are very friendly, service is great. Drinks are awesome as well. Would definitely recommend this place."
Great food shame about the service,Food was fantastic. Management of staff was poor with them looking lost and confused. Getting service only when waving and shouting and getting drinks about 20 mins after being ordered. Could be a real gem with the right staff training and management.
"Great Service, Very Nice Food","Pleasantly surprised by the excellent quality of the service, first and foremost. Uniformly good across 3 different servers - a rarity in Singapore. Pleasant, quick, efficient!

As for the food, also uniformly good - we tried the Curry Goat, Jerk Chicken, Shrimp starters, and a couple of others which escape my memory. What I do remember was that they were all good. Portions were a bit small for the price, but hey, guess you can't have it all.

Overall, well worth a visit."
Fair and decent,"Had an unexpectedly lovely dinner here. Had been to Lime House a very long time ago. It’s still very much the same - really decent, well prepared food and lovely, attentive service. I also command them for having kept their prices at a fair level. Some outlets are now asking up to SGD 30,- for a cocktail. Here you can have a really good one for SGD 18,-. Food wise, we had a selection of tapas which were all very nice. Will definitely be back!"
"Food is good, service is appalling","Great food quality and flavour. Service was horrendous and appalling. Waiters were rude and unhelpful. Refused to give us a table even though there were many. Made me wait for my table although I was there on time and someone else was seated there. Also, they were unpleasant."
Caribbean experience in heart of Singapore,Stumbled upon Lime House when looking for lunch options with a friend. Decided to try the food and so glad that we did. The spices and taste was amazing and really enjoyed sitting on the deck at the front. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for something a little different from the norm in Singapore.
Tingled Tastebuds,"its the second visit to Limehouse and the food is simply fantastic. Not the usual Asian cuisine that my tastebuds are used to so the Carribean style food really set my senses on fire. I highly recommend the Fish Tacos. At around $9 a pop, they are a tad expensive but when you pop one in your mouth its really a little slice of heaven! They are also not stingy with the alcohol in their cocktails, which is always a good thing, Book ahead to avoid disappointment."
"Food was great, service not so","The food was delicious, but service was pretty poor. When we got in, we ordered food and wine. The food arrived, non alcoholic drinks arrived, but the bottle of wine did not. We reminded the staff multiple times - which we got a glass of wine - and after some reminders finally got the bottle we were waiting for. I ordered a cake for the birthday boy, but we had to wait a while for that too."
Outdoor table without enough fans to cut the heat,Was given a table outdoor without proper fans. It was so hot we had to leave just after starters as we couldn’t stand the humidity. The ambience was so good but we couldn’t enjoy our food due to heat. The restaurant could have informed us that the reserved table was non-aircon.
Not a great experience,"I brought a guest who was visiting Singapore. The air con was not working, and therefore, we had to sit outside..in fact, all customers had moved outside. It was hot and humid - not enough fans for everyone outside to be comfortable.. we did two rounds of drinks and some food and moved on to a much better place..."
Superior Caribbean Cuisine,"My fiancé and I stopped by this restaurant after finding it on the internet. I am Jamaican - American and I wanted my fiancé to experience a little piece of the home I always talk about; I must say Lime House did not disappoint. From the moment we walked in, the service was impeccable, the decor was welcoming and the food? Delicious! Being Caribbean I appreciated the how the menu tailored to the culture and cuisine. And the rum? Let’s just say, we had to buy a bottle. 100/10 ! This is must try when you visit Singapore."
"Great vibe, food and service","A really nice experience, with great vibe/music, tasty food (BBQ beef ribs are awesome) and excellent service... Thomas was super attentive and friendly (and we got to enjoy some amazing rhum tasting). Recommended!"
"Atmosphere, Music, Decor, Food and Drinks - All Excellent!","Our evening at Lime House last Friday evening was delightful to say the least.
We were accommodated at a table downstairs and indoors by the welcoming host.
We ordered and received our drinks and meal in great time by our friendly server. Considering it was a very busy evening, we felt well attended to throughout our meal.
The atmosphere, music, decor, food and drinks were all excellent.
We ordered a variety of food as we are always impressed with the quality of each dish every time we visit or order from Lime House.
The selection of rum is marvellous also.
The owner Chris introduced himself to my husband and I, and we had such a wonderful conversation about how he began the first Caribbean restaurant in Singapore. It truly is a gem to visit if you have not done so already. It is full of charm, tradition, and culture, and honestly makes me feel like I’ve truly stepped into the Caribbean again."
Beautifully decorated restaurant with bali vibes,"Known for their rum-based cocktails. Had 2 mains and 2 tapas: seafood stew, Jerk chicken, dhal mushroom and salted fish croquettes. Portions was small and price was on the high side. Was served water immediately from a glass bottle upon seated and we only found out that water cost $1.50 per pax when footing the bill. It would have been courteous of the restaurant to inform customers of this charge instead of being served water immediately upon seated."
Quality is decent but food used to be better quality,"Still great experience overall, even though the food tends to be less qualitative as in the past... Greasier, sweeter, saltier, slightly lower quantities... sad. Maybe due to opening of the new outlet in the east. Staff is nice - quite busy."
Vivian,"Amazing service! Always smiling bar tenders, and delicious food & drinks! One of my fav restaurants/bars in SG!!"
Great food!,The Oxtail with Eggplant was exceptional. Really surprised the whole family with the texture and flavour. Another memorable dish was the Seafood Stew. Great flavours. Chicken Skewers were cooked excellently too. Only had space left to try 2 desserts (Chocolate mousse and Banana cake) which were both delicious too. Overall great value for quality of food and cook! Definitely a place to revisit.
Limehouse is a MUST DO experience in Singapore,"Limehouse is unique. While Singapore has ALOT of venues with massively overpriced Western food that is badly cooked, and absolutely ZERO atmosphere, Limehouse bucks the trend by a) offering a totally UNIQUE menu of Caribbean food and equally amazing collection of the world's best RUM b) having a superb atmosphere with authentic and friendly staff. The new branch in Joo Chiat is amazing and the team has done a great job of launching the second branch against the odds at a time when hospitality and F&B is feeling the pinch. If you want to have fun, and remind yourself that Singapore is a global city then try Limehouse. Special shout out to Dillon and Thomas! I am going to spend my birthday at Limehouse soon and I wouldn't want to spend it anywhere else!"
Great experience despite small portions,"We loved the atmosphere at Lime House Caribbean. Staff is attentive to details, friendly and will make sure that you are well attended.
Wait time is very decent after ordering the dishes, especially the tapas and sides.
I would only say that for that price, portions are not very generous... maybe food for thoughts... more quantity without compromising the quality?

Overall, I would recommend this restaurant, without a doubt."
Wonderful place,Super attentive and knowledge staff. The food is excellent and the cocktails are amazing. We’ve had a couple of nights out here and it’s been great each time 😊 We will be back again for sure
I love Lime House!,"I have been to Lime House a half a dozen times. The food is consistently amazing every time. And better yet, the wait staff is always warm, friendly and very attentive. Every person I have taken, teens, adults, family and friends have enjoyed it as much as I do. I was a little sad to see the drink menu recently reduced, but they bar staff was wonderful to accommodate a request off the old menu (used IG to refresh my memory). I eat primarily off the Tapas menu. Fish tacos, an absolute must have. Had two rounds this time. Plantain nachos and eggplant, all so delicious. For dessert, we had the Panne Cotta which was amazing."
Good but overpriced,"Food was good, but not good enough to justify the steep pricing. The serving sizes were really small for price. Drinks were good though. Recommend to come here for drinks and not for full meal."
Amazing food and vibe!,"The food, cocktails and the overall vibe of the place is amazing! The service could be better. Would definitely go there again."
Flavorful experience,"Very chill place, with good service and amazing flavorful food and unique COCKTAILS.

As per recommendation, we went for the GOAT CURRY, and we were delighted, but by far, the best dish we had, was the GUAVA PORK CHOP.

Twist: can have the FRIED PLANTAIN as dessert"
Great Food for Veggies and Carnivores,"The food is absolutely delicious. Great service too. The Bajan fish tacos, spicy shrimp and ribs really stick in the memory and for veggies and non-veggies the doubles and mac balls were among a number of tasty plates."
It was a great and memorable first visit to LHC,"I had not eaten caribbean food before. The dishes we ordered were just fantastic! Unique, tasty and rich with flavours! Highly recommend you visit. Caribbean rum based cocktails were superb. Great environment and gastronomical experience brought together by the chefs."
Chic Restaurant with Tasty Vegetarian Friendly Food,First time i tried out Lime. The vegetarian dishes were surprisingly good. They also had a few good dishes that were unique and tasty. Overall Lime is definitely one of the few restaurant I would recommend for couples or friends to hang over a hard day of work.
Amazing Jamaican food!!!,"Coming from a Jamaican, i was skeptical of how good Jamaican (Caribbean) food in the middle of South East Asia would be. However I was blown away from moment we entered, the service was excellent (we were given free shots by our waitress), the ambience was alive and the food...took me straight back home. EXCELLENT JAMAICAN FOOD!!!
From the Rice and peas, to the curried goat and the jerk chicken, I will be going back!"
Great Christmas dinner,"We had a great time with Thomas and Jarek! The food and the drinks were amazing, especially if you are like the island vibes! Much love from Mauritian crew. We will definitely be back!"
Awesome food,Great tasting food using fresh ingredients and impeccable cooking techniques. Portions on smaller side for the price.
Triple booked and very disappointed,"I've had Lime House delivery during the lockdown and really enjoyed it, so my friends and I were really looking forward to visiting the restaurant last week. During the day, there was an automated call from the restaurant (via Chope) to confirm our reservation, which I accepted. Thus, one can imagine our disappointment when we arrived (after struggling through massive traffic problems due to a relentless downpour) that the restaurant had triple booked our table. When we arrived, the table that was meant for us was occupied and there was no other table that the restaurant could have offered us. The poor server was flustered, tried to find a solution though in vain. She ultimately offered us a $100 voucher for another visit, which we declined. It was also particularly disappointing that the restaurant owner and manager were in ear shot during the entire episode but did not offer to step in to help their staff who was obviously struggling to rectify the situation. As much as I felt bad for the staff, the lack of support the owner & manager gave their staff left a very bad impression. We walked off quite upset, but managed to get a table at Firangi Superstar around the corner instead (which is not bad compromise at all). Sadly, we will not be returning."
Amazing Trini food!,"Just moved to Singapore and was looking for comfort food. When I saw 'Caribbean' I assumed it would be Jamaican and was astonished looking at the takeaway menu, to see doubles and stew chicken. Proper Trini food (the best food on earth). It could only be better if roti and shark n bake were on offer! I will dine in in person next time."
"Spectacular food, great ambiance, and awesome staff!","Absolutely awesome experience. Loved it! The staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and make everyone feel welcome."
Happy Birthday Mom!,Got the waitresss to recommend food for two small eaters who cannot take heat. The food was just right in taste & portion! Lovely restaurant & delightful experience. Will go back again
Below expectations,"Came here for dinner with my husband with high expectations of an enjoyable evening. The dining hall was empty when we arrived and was ushered to a table in the middle of a walkway. Requested for a change of table but the waitress was reluctant, citing various reasons. After awhile, we got moved to another table. The food menu has limited selection but the cocktails were great. We ordered the goat curry and jerk chicken as mains. The food was ok. The chicken and plantain on the side were slightly cold. There’s limited ambience on the 1st floor - a few fake plants. We will not come back again."
Nice venue,We stopped by to have a few drinks while we were waiting for our table at another restaurant nearby. We really liked the ambience and the service staff was friendly and attentive. I can’t say I enjoyed the Rum Old Fashion to be honest as it wasn’t quite what I expected it to be. I guess I’m more of a Whiskey connoisseur. The martini was nice : We would like to come back here to try out the food and enjoy the friendly service and lovely ambience.
Delicious and great ambiance,"Visited for lunch this month and was very impressed with the range of options and quality of the food. Good mix of meat, seafood and vegetarian in their smaller and bigger dishes.

Also an amazing and well curated rum list including several tasting flights.. The owner is very knowledge and enthusiastic about the rum business so I can't wait to come back and explore new rums."
"Great food, vibes and rum!","An excellent restaurant in Singapore's historic centre. The Caribbean food is excellent, as are the drinks and staff!"
Absolutely delightful place!,"Starting from the decor of the old shophouse restaurant, friendly service to the delicious Caribbean cuisines - it was a delightful experience! We had the Spicy Shrimps and Okra Octopus for starters, followed by the goat curry and pan-fried snapper. Finished with guava cheese cake and banana cake accompanied by a variety of rum. Total cost with one bottle of red wine is S$340"
Trini Approved!,"I took my teenage boys to Limehouse since we have not had good Trini food for over two years! The plantain, macaroni pie, doubles and stew were just like my Mom's ( : And we found new favourites in the Bajan tacos and guava cheesecake! Why did I wait so long?? Thanks Limehouse, we will be back. PS. Let me know if roti, bake or coconut sweetbread make it on your menu!"
Great place!,"Heard good things about Limehouse from a friend, and it didn't disappoint. The fish tacos and chicken skewers were bomb!"
Will definitely visit again!,"Amazing food, awesome & friendly staff and cool ambiance. I'm looking forward to my next visit there and am getting excited about the food just thinking about it!"
Great Food and Fantastic Service,"Excellent food and fantastic service. Have eaten here a few times now and enjoyed immensely every time. Can safely say they have some of my favorite food dishes in Singapore. They also have an impressive rum collection which is worth sampling!

Overall a very fun place to get food on a Friday or Saturday night with friends."
Pleasant experience with delish authentic Caribbean food,"Great service, friendly staff! Natasha and the cool bartender (sorry didn’t get your name) made our experience memorable. To make up for the wait, they went the extra mile to make us feel warm and welcomed. Thanks for the birthday cakes. We enjoyed them so much. My partner and I love the new menu so much. The foods were authentically Caribbean. The crab calaloos and the chicken doubles were superb! A little more calaloos serving portion would be great. Planters punch was well mixed. Everything else is great!"
"Good food, Great service","I was initially apprehensive of trying out Caribbean food, but the menu at Lime House was interesting enough for me to make the reservation. We tried the fried eggplant, prawns and chicken skewers - everything was deliciously spicy (just the way we like our food). Cocktails were good as well. I loved the Negroni with Rum.
Dessert was so-so. The Coconut-Mango panacotta with fried ice-cream sounded promising but didn't impress our tastebuds.
Service was AMAZING. Food arrived on time, servers and the manager were super attentive and friendly. Overall, it's a great place for a casual dinner. Would love to come back when more people are allowed to dine together,"
Viva la Vida Loca !,"great easygoing atmosphere, fun and knowledgeable staff, super cocktails and great food! Be sure to try the goat!"
"Chilled evening, great flavours of the Caribbean.","Having not been able to travel there for a couple of years, Lime House took us back to the Caribbean. From the laid back atmosphere to the authentic flavours in the food and a huge range of rums.

Thomas and the team looked after us superbly; we really enjoyed the range of tapas style starters, the goat curry was melt in the mouth tender and the desserts were the perfect end to the meal. All complemented by a varied selection of cocktails.

We have to come back, so many more dishes and cocktails to try! Thank you Lime house."
Love the flavour & ingredients quality. Nice place.,"Ordered the baby back ribs and super like it. The ribs were not big, which I like, but it tasted heavenly. Super rich in flavour. We ordered a fish (maybe barramundi) taco & liked it too."
Great service and super delicious food,"My title says it all. The spicy shrimp, the crab dumplings, the nachos, the jerk chicken, the nachos, the cocktail...will keep you going for more. Definitely will come again and again and again!"
fabulous food,"i loved everything about this place! the food was amazing, especially the curry goat and the spiced banana cake. it is pretty pricey when you consider the portions, but the taste is worth it! service was quick and friendly, and the atmosphere was chic and cute. i will absolutely be back."
Nice evening with friendly staff,It was a very pleasant evening. The food was very nice and very extraordinary in preparation. Same for the cocktails. Very nice and flavourful
Great dining experience,"Service was excellent, food was delicious (try the jerk chicken), ambience was great, definitely recommend!"
Good food! Great Rums! Would return if it was not for payment issues,"Amazing ambience and nice selection of food. The Banana Chips Nachos are a must have if you visit. The bread with chick-peas & chicken curry is also nice. What I liked the most was the choice of Rums to select from. I am new to Rums (a whisky person) but the manager took keen interest in introducing me to the range of rums based on my choice that night and it was all amazing. Nice service.

The day we had made reservation, the restaurant had some issues with cooling system and promptly informed us. That allowed us to cancel one of our bookings. Really appreciate them reaching out proactively.

What left a sour after-taste was multiple billing disputes I had after the visit which could not be resolved for several months. After going through all of that, I would say -
1. Great for walk-ins (reservation cancellation can be a bit tacky).
2. Use cash. Don't pay with a card.

If it was not for the payment experience, I certainly would have returned to this place - at least a few times every month."
"5 stars service, unique taste","Was recommended by many of my friends to come here. I enjoyed the foods very much, though the taste is unique and not familiar to me. They have good vegetarian options for appetizer abd main dish. What stood out was the exceptional service from the team, and the cocktails were pretty good as well. The vibe was chilling with great music playing."
A must try!,The food was good and the service was so good! They even gave us free shots and attended to our queries swiftly and the recommendation on the menu is all good:)
"Great vibe, Excellent Food, Fanstastic Service","We had a wonderful evening with amazing food and drinks. Our waitress Mellisa was fabulous, she deserves a 10! Lovely setting and a great evening with friends."
"Delicious, warm and cosy atmos, great cocktails and rum menu","The food was without exception really good, and totally without pretension. It was warm and welcoming inside, the service was not faultless but it was good enough, there is an amazing rum list and the cocktails were awesome."
Overpoweringly boozy,"I've been meaning to check out this place since finding out that they have a rum specialty bar.

I'm well-boozed, but their cocktails are killers. Supremely overpowering in the rum, that you can hardly taste the blends of cocktails or other ingredients. I shudder to think of getting another but I did, and this time, I can taste mildly of the coffee in it, but its still as overpoweringly scary.

This may be a place for those of you looking for more of your base alcohol in the cocktails, but it's definitely a little too strong for my own liking. And not in a good way.

Prior to Lime House much to say, we're pretty well boozed up with a nice buzz, and I would have thought it would be good to finish the night with rum base cocktails.

Scary boozy end.

P.S. Water is chargeable, at least it should be noted before you see it reflected in the bill. We weren't told even if we are much willing to pay for it should we know before hand."
Gastronomic Delight,"Quality of food is superb . Had Spicy Shrimp which was well seasoned , Guava Sofrito Pork Chop , L.H Jerk Chicken , Tribajam Curry Goat and Mango & Coconut Panacotta which were delight to the palate. Food portion is small giving customers an opportunity to try new dishes ."
"Great customer service, good food","Just as the title says. The staff went above and beyond to entertain and serve us (notable mention: Thomas). The food was prompt, full of flavour and great. We'll return again."
Amazing food!,"Absolutely love the food! Chicken doubles are absolutely delicious for a starter. Oxtail, granny’s stew, goat curry, jerk chicken I mean there’s nothing you could go wrong with. So delicious, flavorful, and something different in Singapore. Wish they had a better draught beer selection l though."
Delicious and Different,"I've eaten at Lime House on numerous occasions in the past year, both dining in and delivery, It is probably my favourite restaurant in Singapore. Food is different to anything else you can get in Singapore, and the location is set up very nicely to feel like you are in a caribbean beach restaurant.

The food is flavourful and plentiful (recommend the jerk chicken, curry goat and mac and cheese balls in particular) and the cocktail list is expansive.

The waitstaff is friendly and attentive and special mention must be made of the manager Jarek who is passionate and knowledgeable about rum and provided us with many samples of his rum collection.

Highly recommended for a casual dinner or a special occasion, looking forward to my next visit"
Great hospitality,Mentioned that it was a birthday celebration and had a surprise desert and candle! Warm service and attentive. Food was delicious!
"Amazing food, warm service","Have no idea how authentic Caribbean food tastes like, never been. But this is without a doubt a place that will surprise your taste buds. Went for spicy shrimps, chicken skewers for tapas and curry goat as a main. All amazing. Drinks seem to have a generous amount of spirits.
In terms of service - you will be looked after."
Delicious food and vibrant ambience,The good is great with Caribbean influence. The décor and ambience is alive and vibrant. The staff is friendly and efficient.
Excellent Food & Experience,"Absolutely loved my meal here. where else can you find some Caribbean food? The food and atmosphere was really My favourite was the Oxtail & Eggplant ($16++). The crunch from the breaded eggplant paired with the rich braised oxtail was a banger start to our meal. The Caribbean Nachos ($14++) made from plantain chips also had a good balance between the spicy salsa and guacamole. Goat Curry ($32++) was tender and had a good level of spice. Would've appreciated if the fried ice cream in our dessert came hot instead of lukewarm as it would've added an extra layer of texture to the dish. Long story short, will definitely be back for more!!!"
First time and not the last,Really cool feel about the place and was clearly very popular. Tasty starters and some great mains - would definitely go back.
Caribbean,Nice and easygoing Caribbean restaurant. Suitable for families and hanging out with friends. Food was good. Price reasonable.
A great dinner option,"Having seen this place pop up a few times as option for dinner, we finally made it in. No expectations ahead of the visit, hadn’t checked the menu beforehand. SO GOOD! Will absolutely be back.

Cool vibe inside and the ribs were absolutely delicious. The flavours in all the dishes were excellent. We ended up ordering more (pure greed) and left feeling very satisfied."
Nice,"The place is cute, the staff was very nice, the food was good but I think it’s pricey for what it is..."
Best takeaway of my life,"Ordered takeaway as my wife and I really fancied a Caribbean, which is hard to come by in Asia. The food was sensational, the Jerk Chicken was tender and flavoursome. The Dhal Mushrooms were amazing, the chickpea “Doubles” were to die for. I rarely leave reviews, but I want others to experience this. Food was amazing. Also they left a personal hand written note with the delivery. As soon as lockdown ends this will be my first meal out."
"Delicious, healthy and beautiful!","Over the years, we have visited Lime House often - both the downstairs restaurant and the chic upstairs cocktail bar - as well as attending and organizing multiple events there. We have always been fans of the friendly owners, managers and team, as well as the welcoming atmosphere and great cocktails. I have to say though that with the revamp and the updated menu, the highlight of our most recent visit was the food itself -- delicious, healthy and beautiful. The ribs were scrumptious, and the classic hits are not-to-miss - Jerk Chicken and Curry Goat were especially yummy. Obviously we didn't forget the cocktails and wine to pair with the Caribbean flavours ;)... We'll be back soon!"
Family meal experience,"Tried this restaurant with a young family group. They serve numerous rum based cocktails using some of their extensive range of international rum producers. There is a good choice of tapas style dishes that work well as starters and sweet potato chips are an excellent choice. The goat curry was quite spicy and very tasty. Cod as a main dish is also a good choice. The panacotta is a must served with battered ice cream.

The service was very good from polite staff who were very attentive. Not very expensive by Singapore standards."
Great restaurant - unique in Singapore,"We really enjoyed our meal here. The Caribbean food was awesome and they have a cool rewards system that is worth signing up for. It's a fun atmosphere with very attentive service from the partners. The only slight disappointment (but not a surprise for Singapore) is that the cocktails were just ok, very weak. It would not prevent us from returning, which we look forward to."
"Great drink, food and vibes","A really nice place to eat and drink. We've been three time for drinks. The bartenders are great and they have a good knowledge of all the rums on offer. The cocktails are awesome. We have not had a main meal there but have tried the bar snacks and they are terrific. A must go to place if you want good drinks, food and vibes"
"300 Bottles of Rum on the Wall, 300 bottles of tum","A surprise packet: upmarket laid-back Caribbean Classic. Trinidad Tapas was gourmet and a welcome departure from the ubiquitous (though fun for different reason) rum shacks . Trinidadian Chris the founder is The authentic host and his team have eyes up ready to engage, superb product knowledge and a not-too-serious disposition. Great for groups with turntable in the courtyard and a great party space upstairs. A real find!"
Great Taste of the Caribbean,"I am a Jamaican living in Singapore. I am a serious foodie and Lime House delivers the goods. The Jerk Chicken and curried goat has outstanding flavor (not exactly like back home but with appropriate local seasoning adaptation). The rice and peas is good (even if it is basmati rice). The doubles is one of the best items on the menu. Ambience, service, and the bar all well worth a visit!!!"
Sooo good!,"We had dinner here on Saturday and were awed by the quality of food and drink available.

From the bar, we had the Planter’s Punch, Limehouse Punch (I think), some vodka cocktail and a mojito. Thomas (the handsome bartender) prepared each drink impeccably - we loved them all. They all packed a great punch and were so yummy.

And the food... omg. Divine! We had the spicy shrimp, calamari, goat curry, and a full rack of ribs with sweet potato chips. They were ALL delicious. Jarek and the crew took such good care of us and made awesome recommendations.

We’ll definitely be back to try the rest of the cocktails and food - Jarek we will try the desserts next time!"
"Fabulous, Again","Our first opportunity following their refurbishment, and a great job by Jarek and his team. The place is lighter and brighter, the cocktails are still fantastic and the food is still wonderful. The ox-tail on crispy eggplant is awesome and the goat curry is still the best. Bring back the epenades please.
If you love your rum, this is the place get your fix."
Great Spicy Caribbean fare,"Visit with friends for second time round and waited for this visit for review. Now I’m sold. Food was delicious, spicy and well presented. Service very good given it was busy and restaurant offers great value for money. Definite return with friends soon."
Spices from Caribbeans,"Amazing food and amazing cocktails. We were 8 so we've had a bit of everything, most starters and shared main course, there hasn't been one that disapointed. Highlight goes to the spicy shrimps. Highly recommended with friends or for a date."
Amazing vibes,"Food was fantastic and of great quality. Definitely veers on the pricey side, so it helped that we got stuff to share. The jerk chicken and goat curry are especially recommended. Waiters were really friendly, and the overall vibe was really chill. We had a wonderful time."
Interesting food nicely cooked,"Had never been before so was very intrigued to sample. Wasn't a disappointment .
Had the jerk chicken skewers and the Caribbean seafood cakes as tapas starters, they were both very good, the fishcakes were not at all greasy and very tasty the chicken succulent and very tasty and packed a spicy punch.
Mains were the glazed cod and the goat curry both were exceptionally tasty.
Service was quite prompt and attentive. The wines by the glass were not so good but I suspect both the red and the white were overwhelmed by the ample spices. Wasn't too impressed with the Daiquiri and Old fashioned rum cocktails. thought both tasted like cough syrup !
All in all good."
As authentic as you can get,"I’ve lived in the Caribbean for a few years, so am usually disappointed by restaurants that claim they serve Caribbean food. This place is legit! Fried plantain is the best I’ve had since leaving Antigua, the goat curry was familiar to my palate and the meat fell off the bone, as it should, and the variety of rums took me back. Love this place!"
Fabulous offerings,"This place just gives you great cocktails - try the punch, great Caribbean food - ox tail is to die for, a small range of beers, and over 170 runs. The atmosphere is very welcoming and the crew are great. They will undergo a re furb next month and we can't wait to see it.
We'll be back soon."
Cant wait to go again .,"We have been meaning to go here for ages, and now sad we didnt before. Great atmospher, great staff, and awesome food. Lefi was really attentive and engaging - nice guy. The goat curry and jerk chicken kebabs both delicious - not sure which one best but will have both again. Ok, the goat curry. The chickpea starter delicious too as were the ribs, fishcakes, prawn starter etc. So great to go somewhere where you enjoyed and can sing high praises for all the dishes. Great cocktails too! Thank you Lefi and team!"
Highly recommended!,"Thumbs up for the amazing food and great services. Seafood cake was our favourite, while the spicy shrimps were cooked to perfection, both are not to be missed. Great ambience and excellent dining experiences."
Authentically Caribbean,"We loved the delicious tapas, funky decor and the cool atmosphere. The Jamaican bartender and waitress who served us the food are friendly and attentive. Ribs are delicious excellent. Flavors of the Jerk chicken and goat curry are wonderful. The drinks are nice. The fig ice cream goes really well with the delicious banana bread. Service is quick. A nice place to chill and taste the food.

However if you would like to enjoy the 50% eatigo deal, please get the entire group to come on time to be seated, finish and not linger. They are popular so a reservation is recommended."
Last minute perfection,"Having eaten and had drinks here before with friends, I selected Lime for a work function. I had reserved a space for 15 people for drinks and with less than 24 hours notice I had to turn that into dinner for 30-40 people. Can’t praise Chris and his crew highly enough for reacting and adapting fast to our ask. We got half the restaurant all set and ready for us and the crew turned around the drinks and plenty of fabulous food super quick. Everyone enjoyed it and our event went off without a hitch. Huge thanks to the team at Lime."
Below average food with high prices,"Drinks were nice but pricey.
Food was below average. Ambiance was nice with caribbean vibes.

Will recommend this if you want a quiet and relaxed place for grabbing a few drinks. Avoid the food."
Nonchalant personal who cheat,The cheat about the sixe of the beer. We have to prove its not rhe size we order. The food was good but very small portions. This place is not worth the price
Five star,Food is absolutely fantastic. There were also lot of vegetarian options. We had ordered two cocktails and both of them were excellent. Never had such amazing cocktails ever. And the food is just too delicious. The portions were perfect for 2 of us.
Fantastic Everything,"A really great restaurant, good quality food, service, ambience, cocktails and wine. The menu is a little different but a very pleasant surprise, have already been back once and plan to make this restaurant a regular. A hit with all the family!"
Great event venue with yummy food and cocktails,"My husband and I hosted a party for 60 of our friends at the Lime House, Bago Rum room which is located one level above the restaurant. Jarek and team did everything they could and more to ensure our guests felt welcomed. There is a bar situated in this private room and our guests were treated to yummy cocktails. The food was amazing and the portions were very generous. Everyone of our guests commented on how much they enjoyed the food. We could personalise the music by streaming our play list and there was so much space to dance and have lively conversations with all our friends. It was a successful event by all standards. Jarek and team were amazing and so attentive to our every need. Thank you Jarek!

I would certainly recommend this venue to host a group of friends or for a lovely evening out with friends and family."
Really good!,"Went to Lime House for dinner last night, we hadn’t booked but we were in the area and had been planning to try it for a while. We were greeted with a warm welcome, ordered some fab food and experienced great service. We shared sweet potato fries, crab cakes, doubles and some slaw and everything was cooked perfectly and really tasty especially the slaw and the dip that came with the fries! We each had a glass of house Sauvignon which was also nice, overall great experience and would certainly considering going back if I’m in the area!"
Delicious food,"We had a wonderful evening at Lime House with the most amazing dishes. Although the restaurant was housing 2 big corporate groups upstairs and our cocktails took quite a while to arrive, the staff went out of their way to make sure everything else was ace. Our drinks were not charged when they did come out. Our starters and mains were equally good and staff did a great job hosting us. We will be back."
Great experience,"We were there on 30 April with some friends after dinner friendly staff, fast services and the rum old fashioned was very nice. we will go there again for lunch this coming Sunday.."
