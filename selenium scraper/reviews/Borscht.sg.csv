Unique experience!,Tried Russian cuisine for the first time recently at Dumpling.Ru! It was a unique and pleasant experience and was really surprised at how good the dumplings were! They were really juicy and flavourful and super worth it at that price. Would definitely visit again!
Very good food! Worth more than one visit!,"Great service, very friendly staff. Food was great! Very tasty and reasonably priced! The atmosphere and ambience within the place was also very lovely. Will definitely be back again!"
"Great food, cozy atmosphere!","Food was great, and the restaurant had a cozy atmosphere! Especially enjoyed the borscht soup which was mixed with cream, and the seledka that had potatoes, salted herring and rye bread. The dumpling platter was also very tasty, with each dumpling being coloured differently to signal different fillings. It made for a wonderful dining experience!"
A Unique Russian Experience!,"Located at Tanjong Pagar, this place is highly recommended for authentic Russian Food! The 2 main dishes that I thoroughly enjoyed was the Mushroom Chegureki and Oliver (Potato Salad). The Chegureki felt and had the texture of the local curry puff stuffed with mushrooms but it was much more doughy. As a potato salad lover, I really enjoyed this as unlike the conventionally big chunks of potato, it was served in diced potatoes and vegetables which really gave a good crunch. It was a very interesting experience and would definitely come back with a more adventurous friends to try out more items on the menu."
Wonderful first experience with Russia-Ukrainian food,"Would recommend coming for their brilliant food and homely ambience! In particular, the Cheese Chebureki, the multiple flavoured Dumplings Combo Set, Ukrainian Borscht Soup and the Seledka were all really exquisite!"
Great tastes and ambience,"An authentic Russian experience with unique tastes not found anywhere else in Singapore! Visit for a taste of Russia or if you’re just looking to explore new flavours! Must tries: borscht, seledka, chebureki and of course the dumplings!"
Interesting Russian Food in CBD,"For those unacquainted with Russian food, it's a savoury affair when you step into Dumplings.RU. Hot melt-in-your-mouth cheese in every bite - their Cheese Chebureki is definitely a crowd pleaser and a must try for Cheese Lovers. Well-balanced in flavour, their Ukranian Borscht is the perfect comfort food with beetroot that gives it the signature slight sweetness with a hint of sour taste and iconic red appearance.

Kudos to the recommendation from the waiter!"
Traditional mouthwatering russian dumplings!,"The atmosphere was superb and absolutely great for a catch-up session with friends or even dates. The mouth-watering food makes this venue a definite choice for diners looking for good quality food.

Had the combo platter as my main which had an array of different dumpling to try from and had a generous portion. Also got ourself a cherubeki which was very flavourful. They complemented each other very well with the soup too. Staff were super attentive, helpful and friendly. Cant wait to visit here again"
Cool place for russian food,"Wanted to try out Russian food and was excited to come here! We had the combo platter, but my favourites were the potato dumplings as they were super tasty. We also ordered the borscht and cheese chebureki based on the waiters' recommendation. Loved it, as the portions were generous and price was reasonable. The atmosphere is also super cool and felt like we travelled to europe in singapore"
Date Night,"I was amazed by the food, something really different and there's so much fun eating it due to the various colours of the dumpling skin and guessing the flavours. The owner is also very friendly!"
Must Try One-of-a-kind Dumplings!,"Stopped by this quaint little restaurant on a weekday night and was lucky enough that there were seats available! It was my first time trying russian food in general (not just their dumplings) and was extremely pleased with my experience.

Wanted to try as many dishes as possible since it was my first exposure to the cuisine so in addition to the Russian dumplings, I also got the borsch (which is their tomato/cabbage soup), salmon cheese crepe and also their stuffed bell pepper.

Was really impressed by the dumplings - the texture of the skin was amazing, coupled with the tasty and meaty filling. It's definitely very different from your typical Chinese dumplings and you don't even need to dip it in any sauce! The other sides were also rich and flavorful to complement the main star of the show.

Overall a very intriguing and delightful meal and will definitely be back to try out the other dumplings flavors!

PS: The place isn't exactly the biggest so would recommend perhaps making a reservation if you don't want to be disappointed!"
Authentic Russian cafe,First experience with Russian cuisine at this cosy cafe which was memorable and interesting. Opened my palate to a whole new variety of flavours which were rich and savoury. Had their stuffed bell pepper rice together with the borscht soup that complemented one another perfectly
Dining Experience at Dumplings.ru,"It was an interesting experience trying Russian cuisine for the first time! Really enjoyed the Dumpling Set 101 with a variety of different colours and fillings to explore! The Ukrainian Borsh Soup was tangy and appetising which paired well with the other dishes! The Kotlety (chicken patty) was not too bad! The Paneer Cheese Crepe was a great dessert to end off the meal which was also not too sweet. Overall, the food generally gave off a homecooked feel which was enjoyable!"
Russian Dumplings!!,"A very unique experience! Highly recommend trying their Dumpling Platter and Broscht Soup for starter! And for desserts, try the Paneer Cheese Crepe! Not the best but a very rustic homecooked russian meal that will statisfy your inquisitive tastebuds!"
Very interesting food!,"I have not been to Russia, so wouldn’t know if it’s authentic. But this place is very cozy, an after work hangout place with interesting food. The menu is interesting with foods I never seen before. Ordered the mix dumpling platter, the dumplings were tasty and each variety brought surprises to the palette. My fav was the lamb dumpling. The kvass drink is truly a very unique drink! Refreshing and light. A very interesting night of food exploration."
My first Russian food experience,"They have wide range of food choices on the menu, never tried Russian food before and really amazed by it"
First time experience for Russian food,First time experiencing Russian food and I will sure come back for more! Variety of Russian food available to choose from!
A Narnia Moment!,"It was a really wonderful experience dining at Dumplings.ru! The great music and great food combined to provide a brief but much needed respite from everyday Singapore. I enjoyed the Borscht particularly, maybe it was the pouring rain outside but it did wonders to warm my heart and belly!"
20/1 dinner!,"Went there on a rainy Thursday night, had the following dishes:

Dumpling platter - Was a very interesting selection of pork, beef, potato, chicken etc. Great choice for those coming for the first time! Sour cream was light and goes well with the saltier dumplings in general.

Borscht soup - Perfect for the rainy weather! Really liked this one. (:

Zharkoe - This stew will be a must order for me the next time I'm back. Really hearty dish that got me surprisingly full, and the accompanying bread was great to dip.

Medovik - Personally not a sweet tooth person so this was personally a bit too sweet for my liking but I'm sure its great for those who really like sweet desserts. Felt that the cake could be spongier in texture.

Kompot - Russian fruit punch was not too sweet, but felt it was a bit watery (maybe because it might have been diluted by ice previously). Still good though!

Overall: 4/5 stars for me - something out of the typical Singaporean foodfare for the adventurous foodie, I suppose.

Thanks so much dumplings.ru, keep up the great stuff! (:"
This place is seriously underrated. I'll be back!!,"Excellent food and very friendly service! My first time trying Russian food but this was a very delightful experience for me. The solyanka, cheese chebureki and medovik are my favourites! Their pelmeni combo platter is their signature and definitely friendly to Singaporean tastebuds - give it a try! Meal goes well paired with vodka/ kvass for the full Russian/Eastern European experience!"
Pleasant Russian food and really great service!,"Had a pleasant meal at this quaint restaurant serving authentic Eastern European cuisine. The Russian dumplings (or pelmeni/pierogi) was delicious. I would definitely go back for the potato dumplings. The meat dumplings were slightly gamey for me, but my peer enjoyed it. The salami soup was hearty and could be a meal on its own. The stroganoff was pretty good, and for someone who has not tried Russian sauerkraut, the dill made it really a good accompaniment to the dish. The chebureki was the highlight, however. This Russian ""curry puff"" is crispy and cheesy. Mark, the waiter was exceptionally pleasant and introduced us patiently to the various items. I will be back for more."
Delicious food,"The food was really delicious and came in large portions. I ordered the dumpling sample platter, okroshka and medovik. The dumpling skin was really smooth and chewy, and the fillings were very unique too.

The okroshka, which is a cold summer soup, was refreshing. It had cucumbers which provided a crunchy texture, and there were potatoes and egg inside as well. It's definitely one of the most interesting soups I've ever had, and it was really yummy too. I also tried some of the borscht which my friend ordered and that was nice too, very hearty and flavourful.

Lastly, the medovik which is a honey cake was very dense, so I do recommend sharing it with someone else! The cake was very sweet and filling and made for good dessert.

I really enjoyed myself here and am looking forward to trying the other dishes they have to offer. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for some unique and delicious Russian cuisine!"
Lovely Russian Cuisine in the Heart of the City,"The restaurant has a cozy atmosphere with a lovely Russian decor. I ordered the Combo Platter ($19.90), which featured an assortment of 12 dumplings, Borscht ($9.90), which is a hearty portion of beef and beetroot soup, and Medovik ($8.90), Slavic layered honey cake.

The dumplings featured beef, chicken, pork and lamb, and various combinations of the meats. There were also 3 vegetarian dumplings, and the platter was served with sour cream. The skins of the dumplings were thick and smooth, and the variety of fillings made the platter an interesting treat of flavours. 12 dumplings seemed like a small portion, but do not underestimate them; they are pretty filling!

The Borscht was surprisingly light despite the hefty portion of cream on top, and the light beetroot served as a nice counterbalance to the chunks of beef. The soup was delightfully sweet and sour, and it is a very good entry into Russian/Ukranian cuisine.

A slice of Medovik was extremely filling, as the cake was decadent and sweet, dense and packed with flavour. I would recommend sharing a slice of this popular Russian dessert, as it might be too much for one to handle after a filling meal.

Overall, it was an enjoyable experience to finally get to try Russian cuisine. I would definitely return to try out other dishes!"
Great food and ambience!,"Really cool decor with delicious food! Ordered the combo platter which came with 12 pieces of dumplings with different fillings, salmon and cheese crepe, the cheese chebureki (a pan-fried puff) and a slavic honey cake. Everything was nicely seasoned and tasty - highly recommend if you're new to Russian food!"
Unique place for a great date night,"Had a unique experience for a date night at Dumplings.Ru! We ordered the dumpling combo platter, fried cheese dumpling, salmon crepe and the Slavic honey cake. It was really eye opening having Russian cuisine for the first time. Some of the dumpling fillings were a little strong tasting so if you have a queasy stomach try out some of the lighter fillings first. Other than that, the salmon crepe was great, serving as a refreshing tasting alternative to cleanse the palate after we had the fried cheese dumpling (which was also great, recommended by our server). The service was welcoming and friendly, seems like a homely, family-run place. The decor was really cool too, I especially liked the Soviet era themed posters and the menu design.

Would be a really fun place to bring a date! You’ll have a new, unique experience and lots to talk about."
Unique Experience,"Loved how to place was decorated like mini Russia. It was my first time ever trying Russian dumplings so I opted for the combo platter of 12 pieces to get more variety. The dumplings came in different colour to differentiate the various flavour - the one that stood out the most was the Beef as it was was tender and flavourful. The most raved about cake was the Medovik, a real treat for the tastebuds, a multi layered honey cake recommend sharing it as the portion is quite huge. Overall a very unique and lovely experience."
Russian food experience,"First time trying russian food so it was an interesting experience! Highly recommend the combo platter so that you can try a variety of flavours. Also tried Shuba which had an interesting combination of flavours and was refreshing.

There was a variety of meaty and potato dumplings. Meat dumplings were juicy and good."
Authentic Russian experience,Great experience with good food and good service! Especially loved their mushroom cheese puff Chebureki......simply cooked to perfection
Authentic Russian food,"Great place to try Russian food! I think it’s a pretty authentic place, and I enjoyed my dinner there. Will recommend the combo platter of dumplings so you can try one of every flavor they offer, and the honey cake was a pretty unique dessert to end off the dinner. Do make a reservation before coming over, because it’s actually really popular and it can get crowded"
Dumplings for days,"Considering the wide breadth of Russian cuisine, you wouldn’t name your restaurant after dumplings if you weren’t confident they were good. They were certainly the highlight of my meal there, definitely lives up to its name and more!

Russian food typically isn't in the culinary lexicon of most locals, and the owner was friendly and explained to us the various dishes served. He was also so kind as to leave his сок (birch sap juice, an interesting Russian beverage) on the table and offer us a serving."
Unique find in the CBD,"Having never tried Russian food before (or even knowing that we had restaurants that serve Russian food, here in Singapore), I was really excited to be there. My friend and I got a total of 4 dishes to share: the shuba (salted herring salad), the chebureki (pan fried puffs, we got two— one beef and blue cheese, one mushroom and cheese), the 12 piece pelmeni combo platter (dumplings!) and the medovik (Slavic honey cake). The food was all really good and it was especially fun trying out all the different flavours of dumplings that they had. For first-time visitors, I would definitely recommend the combo platter as it would allow for you to try all the different flavours of dumplings that is available. The puffs are really good as well, though I would recommend that you eat it fast as the pastry outside gets soggy fast once you cut into it, what with the filling being so juicy. People with a sweet tooth should definitely get the honey cake as well. I really enjoyed the toffee notes and layers of cream, cake and crumbles.

All in all, I would recommend this place for people who are looking to try new things or just looking for a cosy place to grab a bite with friends in the CBD area (the restaurant is really conveniently located, just a stone’s throw away from Tanjong Pagar exit B). Would probably be back to try the other items on the menu!"
"Chewy pelmeni, hearty kvass and a novel Russian date night","Thanks to this hole-in-the-wall trip to Russia, I'm now a big fan of chewy, savoury pelmeni (dumplings), kvass (bread beer?), and various soups. Though I'm no expert on Russian cuisine, each item in our $78 tasting set felt vibrantly homemade and fresh.

The atmosphere blew us away too; the moment we stepped into this cosy, warmly-lit restaurant with eurobeats playing, various booze bottles lining the counter and a life-size mannequin in Russian ethnic garb, I could've sworn we forgot we were still in the CBD of Singapore.

Thanks for explaining each item to us too, was a lovely and novel date night!"
Interesting food and culture!,"The whole restaurant gives a Russian atmosphere (Russian decor, steam punk items, Russian songs), it was pretty cool. We ordered 12 pcs dumpling combo platter (I think just nice for 2 pax), Ukranian Borscht Soup (portion was big, quite acquired taste), Kolodets (not bad! Taste a little like century egg), Medovik (it was great, a little too sweet for me) and chebureki (its like curry puff but its fillings is I think mozzarella cheese). The portion was for 2 pax as the quantity is quite a lot. Price-wise its quite affordable. Try the rye bread alcohol (Kvass), its very unique and its sweet!"
Experience authentic Russia here,"Food was good and ambience was the closest I could get to experiencing Russia, without travelling there myself.

I enjoyed the Ukrainian Borscht soup which came with a generous portion of meat & veg. The Chebureki (pan fried puffs with meat or cheese fillings) was so crispy and delicious and the Medovik (honey cake) was the perfect desert to end the night. Would definitely recommend coming to experience the restaurant at least once."
Great place to catch up,"Really enjoyed myself here and the food was good, I especially loved their mushroom cheese puff Chebureki 10/10 would recommend this dish !!

The server was really helpful and friendly:) What I wanted to order was not unavailable but she introduced other dishes. Really yummy and left feeling very full !"
Interesting virgin experience with Russian cuisine,"For a dumpling specialist shop, the highlight of the meal was surprisingly, the desserts. Dulce de Leche crepes were thin and chewy, and lavished with a generous drizzle of creamy caramelised condensed milk. Medovic, a Russian dessert, was a meticulously assembled slice of cake comprising alternating sheets of spongy cake, cookie-crisp layers and creamy frosting. Flavour was sweet and caramelised, with distinct toffee notes.

Borscht tasted like minestrone. Salmon dumplings were flavourful and well-seasoned. The meat dumplings were filled with a beef-pork mince that was a tad too gamy. It’s also a pity that the dumpling skins were rather thick and doughy."
"Decent Dumplings, Even Better Dessert","I know dumplings are their specialty here but their desserts are surprisingly great too! Really enjoyed the Medovik ($8.90) which is Slavic honey cake, and the Caramel Crepes ($7.90). The texture of the crepe is interesting; not the thin, easy to pull apart texture you'd normally expect from crepes

As for the dumplings they have a rather wide variety of dumplings like lamb and salmon dumplings, and even fusion dumplings e.g beef + chicken dumplings. Personally felt the skin of the dumplings were a bit too thick and bland, but my favourite is the salmon dumpling"
Pleasant first experience with Russian cuisine,"Ordered the cheese chebureki, 12 piece dumplings combo platter, beef stroganoff and medovik.
Had initial doubts as we weren’t used to the flavors in the beef stroganoff, but we really enjoyed the chebureki and dumplings. The chebureki puff was nice and crispy with oozing stretchy cheese in it, really felt like a comfort food. The 12 piece dumpling platter was interesting as we got the try each of the different flavors offered, which were all pretty tasty. The medovik, a multi-layered Slavic honey cake, was gave a nice sweet end to our dinner. An overall good first experience with Russian cuisine at dumpling.ru."
First experience with Russian Cuisine,"It was a pleasant and eye-opening first experience with Russian cuisine despite some doubts at first as we were not very used to the flavors used in Russian cuisines. Had the cheese chebureki, 12 combo platter of dumplings, beef stroganoff and medovik (multi-layered slavic honey cake). Loved the chebureki as the puff was nice and crispy with nice stretchy cheese. It was interesting to try the different flavors of dumplings in the 12 piece combo platter and it was quite fun to guess the flavors of the multi-colored dumplings as well. Though a bit oily in my opinion, the dumplings were good and I do recommend having the combo platter to get to try all the flavors. The ambience was really nice and really felt authentically Russian."
Great first try!,"Dumplings.ru is an interesting find in the city centre. Absolutely loved the Salmon Crepes, it was very filling. The bell pepper was enjoyable and the Borscht is hearty. We also tried the Kompot and Kvass. This was my first time eating Russian cuisine and really enjoyed it. The restaurant had a homely feel and I genuinely feel like I was in a tiny piece of Russia."
Russian Dinner Experience,"dumplings.ru did not disappoint when my friend and I made a stop for dinner last week. We tried a few of their bestsellers, such as the salmon cheese crepes, borscht, and stuffed bell pepper. I highly recommend giving this place a try."
First time trying authentic Russian Food!,"This was my first time trying Russian food so I was really excited for it and got to admit it was really good! We got the dumplings combo, and the meat inside was really juicy and yummy. The skin was a bit thicker than other dumplings but it provided texture and chewiness (and love the variety too!)

We purchased their signature honey cake to go with it and damn was it sweet! It was slightly too sweet for my taste buds but if you share it with someone I think it's a perfect dessert addition! Already recommended this place to another friend and we are considering coming back here soon! :)"
virgin russian experience,"my first russian food experience was amazing! i loved the dumplings so much, especially the beef and chicken fusion! the cheese puffs were also amazing!"
Delicious Russian Cuisine,"It was my virgin experience trying russian food and I must say I really enjoy the food. The dumplings are very delicious and so colourful. I really like the beef + chicken fusion dumplings :-) For anyone with sweet tooth, I would definitely recommend their desserts - Napoleon cake and dulce de leche crepes."
Amazing first experience trying Russian food!,"Authentic Russian cuisine at what is probably the only Russian foodplace in Singapore. Tried their combo platter which comprised of dumplings with different fillings. Also managed to try a pork chebureki and cheese chebureki, which are pan fried puffs that are quintessential Russian street food. I was also very excited to try the Medovik - Russian layered honey cake and I am glad to say that it did not disappoint! A very unique experience that is hard to find in Singapore, I highly recommend coming to try for yourself as well. I particularly enjoyed the ambience, with many USSR posters all around, kind of traditional cozy Russian eatery vibe."
A taste of Russia in Singapore,"Had a memorable and fun dining experience at Dumplings.ru. Was amazed at the assortment of dumplings and creativity in ensuring that the dumplings can be differentiated by their skin colour. Enjoyed 12 different flavours from the combo platter. I was also impressed by the crispiness of the cheese and pork chebureki which goes well with their sour cream dip. The Slavic honey cake is a must-try, especially if you love desserts, as it has a creamy and soft cookie-like texture. Thanks for the great experience :)"
Excellent russian food experience in a quiet cosy place,"This was my virgin Russian food experience and I must say I'm extremely happy with my meal! :) My favourite dishes were the salmon cheesy crepe and the pork chebureki, and I would recommend this to anyone who has a savoury tooth! Very generous with the fillings, and not oily at all. Would definitely order these two again!

We also went for the combo dumplings platter, which was a rather interesting experience. They had different coloured skin which denoted different flavours, and I really like the ones with the meat in them!

Ambience wise, the place is rather quiet and cosy, really suited for long chats and relaxation after work."
Exotic Russian fare - borschtastic!,"Am always up to try new cuisine from around the world, so when I knew about this place and what it offers, was definitely intrigued.

The place itself was well decorated with posters and items related to Russia and Ukraine - which helped set the mood for whats to come later.

Food wise was actually quite thorough - from the dumplings to the excellent borscht, and not forgetting the salmon cheese crepe!! Pricing wise though a little steep but am not complaining because the food itself was more than decent! Must try the borscht - on a comforting night it was quite the dish

Will definitely be back to try its other items and also the Russian bees"
Delightable Russian cuisine in Sg!,"For the adventurous taste buds - we enjoyed our time talking about the food served throughout the night! We love their assorted combo dumplings, salmon cheese crepe and salted herring! These are the must orders! The dumpling’s skin is a little thick for our liking, but was surprised by the flavours of the meat inside. Also a great place for drinks to go with especially the salted herring. We also love how the staff is accommodative and good in his description and recommendation of the food. Cozy atmosphere and conveniently accessible from Tanjong Pagar MRT station."
Great place to try a new cuisine!,"Was our first time trying out Russian cuisine and it was a v fun experience! The restaurant‘s interior was rly nice and the staff was v friendly too!!

Their dumplings were q tasty and had a wide range of flavours to choose from!! The soup was quite a nice starter as well and even came with a side of bread! The pork chebureki was crispy but not too oily with pork filling inside and the portion size was quite generous!

Their desserts are on the sweeter side, we had the honey cake which came with a nice caramel-like filling! would be great to satisfy sweet cravings! Overall a nice place to try out a new cuisine!!"
"Unique experience, will recommend!","The dumplings were so good, each dumpling had a different filling and we had so much fun tasting all of it! The soup was great, light, and not too heavy despite the amount of sour cream poured over it! The pork chebureki ""curry puff like"" side was super good as well, crispy and not too oily!! The cake was slightly on the sweeter side but was unique and delicious!

On top of that, the staff was so friendly! He explained to us each dish and answered our questions patiently! Really made the entire experience so much more enjoyable! Will definitely recommend it if you're looking to try a new cuisine (especially since we can't travel now)"
First timing trying Russian cruisine,"First time trying out Russian cruisine and it was a pleasant experience! The interior of the restaurant has a very cosy feeling to it and very suitable for a nice night out with friends. The staff was also very helpful and explained to us the different items on the menu.
We tried out the combo dumplings platter and the taste was very unique and different from the usual chinese/japanese dumplings! Personally I also loved the Borscht soup and the Chebureki!"
Interesting food. Good service,"It was my first time eating Russian food. The food was very interesting, but I didn't find it particularly delicious. My friends liked it though. The kvass drink and the honey bread were really good. The dumplings were just okay to me, maybe because I'm so used to the Chinese ones with very think skin and a lot of soup.

The service was really good. I saw some complaints online about the cleanliness of the plates and the utensils. Maybe they saw those complaints, and the Russian lady was very diligent checking the cleanliness of the plates. She made recommendations of the food in details. I really appreciated that.

The price was also very reasonable for an ""exotic"" cuisine in the CBD area.

I would highly recommend to give this place a try."
Exotic and interesting,"Russian food is exotic and so dumplings ru was definitely one for the books! I tried the combo platter dumplings and on the first look it really looks like your local DTF dumplings! Except it’s not Chinese dumplings but Russian dumplings, so expect dumplings that are more to the dry side. There’s so many flavours to pick from though was so spoilt for choice that I went for the combo platter so i could have a taste of everything! From potato, cheese, beef, salmon and pork inside the dumplings it really fills you up! Not only that, I tried the medovik honey cake which was stellar to end off the meal. A slight sweetness yet not over to the top, very fragrant smelling as well. Would recommend the honey cake!"
Fun experience with good selection of Russian beer,"Always wanted to try Russian cuisine after discovering Russian folk songs from Esplanade years ago; discovered this place while dining in is still allowed. Good salad, particularly enjoyed the salmon cheese crepes, gonna visit again after COVID measures lift."
An authentic step into Russian cuisine,"Dropped by and enjoyed an interesting experience. Stepping into a cosy space with welcoming decor, the place served authentic Russian Delights: tried the salted Herring salad (Shuba) that had quite a dimension of tastes in a cup, a variety of colourful dumplings with different fillings and of course, Borscht soup. The salmon cheese crepe was also quite a delicious item to enjoy. Not to forget, this was a great place for a tipple: Russian beer, wines, cocktails and vodka! ваше здоровье"
"Good atmosphere, even better food","Have always been curious about what Russian cuisine taste like and we finally had our answer. The restaurant looks and feels so authentically Russian! We really love the food as well. The Ukrainian Borsh soup pairs so well with the rye bread and Salo, and then you have the dumplings platter that tasted as delicious as they look. Really recommend dropping by the restaurant for anyone interested in Russian cuisine!"
Authentic Russian Experience - Dumplings Galore,"Absolutely love the aesthetic of the restaurant. It was our first exposure to Russian cuisine and it definitely impressed us. The team is so friendly and welcoming to everyone that stepped in, taking the time to make conversations and explain each dish in detail. The food is also wonderful, highly recommend everyone to try the 12 piece dumpling platter, they even have a cute sign by the table to explain the flavours of each dumpling. Do drop by in the area if you’re ever interested in trying Russian food!"
Authentic Russian food,"Tasty dumplings (surprised pikachu) and chebureki and honey cake and a really nice selection of beer and vodka and various other Russian drinks
The owner is super friendly and fun to talk to
I'm definitely going back whenever I have the opportunity. I need to try the entire menu"
Russian Dumplingssss,"It was my first time trying out Russian cuisine, and it was better than what I expected. The dumpling were slightly different from the usual dumplings, the skin of the dumplings were much more chewy and springy which was kind of nice. The salmon cheese crepe was really good with a good amount of cheese wrapped in the crepe. My favourite was the borscht, a tomato base stew, served with bread on the side. I am not someone who loves tomato based anything, but the soup really hits the right spot! As for the drinks, we ordered the fruit punch and kvass; The fruit punch is not like the usual ones, it is less sweetened. Most of the food are served with some sort of cream based sauce, this makes the fruit punch a really good palate cleanser. Kvass was really interesting, it tasted like beer without the alcoholic taste. The owners were also really friendly and it makes you feel like a part of the place. Overall, I would recommend giving it a try!"
Delicious,"I ate their dumpling combo platter to try all the flavors, and they tasted great fried. At the owner's friendly recommendation since I didn't want to drink alcohol, I got a non-alcoholic can of beer of sorts that accompanied the dumplings well. For dessert, I had the Medovik which was a sweet and delicious slice of layered honey cake. All in all, it was a filling and sumptuous meal in a rustic environment with russian posters plastered on the wall."
Exciting flavours through comforting mediums,"Visited the establishment for weekday lunch with very little experience with Russian cuisine. I had expected the food to taste very rich or heavy, but it was all fairly mild yet well seasoned. My friend and I shared a dumpling platter (12 pcs), a salmon cheese crepe, a Ukrainian borscht (soup), and a pork/cheese chebureki combo (fried pastry with filling, somewhat resembling curry puffs). The dumpling wrappers are a bit thicker and more chewy than I am used to, but the combo was overall a great way to explore new flavour combinations. I particularly enjoyed the potato and bacon dumpling, and the beef and chicken dumpling. The borscht had the distinct richness of tomato and herbs without being overwhelming, and paired really well with the bread. The crepes were light and fluffy, with a decent amount of fillings. The chebureki was not as crispy as I had expected, but packed a good punch in terms of flavour. The dumplings, crepes and chebureki were all served with their own tangy dipping sauces that really enhanced their flavours and textures. I also really enjoyed the refreshing kompot (fruit punch), which was a nice palate cleanser. We also had a kvass (a drink made from rye bread, but tasted like beer without the alcohol), which surprised me with its complex and novel taste. Overall, I truly enjoyed the experience at dumplings.ru, and would definitely recommend it for people looking to explore the flavours of Russia through familiar foods such as dumplings."
Rare Russian Delight,"Had a fantastic Russian culinary experience. I particularly enjoyed the Zharkoe stew which had a pork, potato and vegetable base. It felt really homely and brought a sense of warmth, it definitely is a reason for my return in the future. Additionally, do try their dumpling and salad samplers! The dumplings were colour-coded and I really loved the mint variants! Something you don't see often.

Lastly, the Dulce De Leche Crepe was a fantastic dessert to end the night with. It was warm and sweet, coupled with a soft chewy texture which made it heavenly."
Unique and Delicious,"Conveniently located next to Tanjong Pagar MRT, this restaurant provides a unique Russian experience. Loved the rustic decor that gave a Russian vibe, true to its cuisine. Had the dumpling combo platter and the salad platter so I got to try a wide variety of their food. But the most satisfying was Zharkoe, a pork, potato and vegetable stew; very home-cooked feel. The server was friendly as well as she explained each dish to us and recommended some that will go well with each other. Overall a great and unique experience."
Russian Dinner,The borscht soup was really appetising and yummy! The Cheese Chebureki was a tasty snack to have. The puff was really crispy and the cheese was amazing.
Russian Food,"If you are having russian food for the first time, feel free to approach the friendly staff. They will be glad to assist you with your choices. I really like the cheese chebureki and medovik!"
Great vibe,"First time having Russian dumplings. So many flavours and they tasted great, especially the minty lamb dumpling.
The Russian staff was extremely friendly and explained to us the different types of dumplings and their contents.
The deco pairing with the background Russian rap music gives it a really hip atmosphere."
Russian food in CBD,"We ordered 2 sampling platters and shared the pork stew, which was hearty. The dumplings came with homemade sour cream and out of all the unique flavors, we loved the minty ram the most. Interestingly, the dumpling skin is thicker and more colorful than the local varieties in Singapore. We felt that the portion could have been bigger for the price."
Unique find in Tanjong Pagar,Dropped by Dumplings.ru to try something different! The staff there were helpful and friendly — they noted that it was our first time here and brought out a menu explaining the different types of fillings that were in the dumplings. My favourites were the beef and the lamb ones! We ordered the combo platter which had 12 dumplings ($19.90). Good for sharing and trying out the different flavours! I also really enjoyed the Salmon Cheese Crepes which had smoked salmon and cream cheese stuffed into the slightly sweet pancake ($12.90).
Friendly Waiters & Wide Variety of Food,Enjoyed my experience here! The people who served us were really welcoming. It’s cosy and has a wide variety of food. First time having russian food and i’ll definitely try again!
Russian Food Fix,"This place deserves a shoutout! Always love finding new food places and was very happy to have found this place! Really enjoyed the spread of Russian dishes here and the quirky decor! My friend and I shared a Combo Platter (the meat dumplings and paneer cheese ones were my personal faves). The Honey Cake was so sad that I had to share it :( The place is quite crowded though, good to make reservations before heading down!"
Authentic Russian Food,"First time having Russian food and didn’t expect it to be in Singapore! Apparently it’s the only authentic Russian food place here! Prices were rather affordable for an exotic experience:
- Combo platter $12 (Dumpling 12pcs)
- Salmon Cheese Crepes ($12.90)
- Ukrainian Borscht Soup ($9.50)
- Kefir ($4.90)
- Russian Flag Shooter ($12)

Dumplings were unexpectedly filling especially with the sour cream condiment! Particularly liked the Salmon Cheese Crepes and Borscht Soup as it left me feeling hearty and warm.

Our drinks were a little adventure for the taste buds and were rather interesting to taste! The Kefir is a cultured and fermented milk drink (not for the light hearted/lactose intolerant) and the Russia flag shooter is a pretty drink in the colors of the flag containing vodka that can really do you some damage without precaution!"
Russian Food!!,"Enjoyable first-time experience eating Russian Food! Loved the variety of dumplings in the combo platter, the homely borscht soup and the honey cake :) The salmon crepes were pretty good too, but they were much smaller than expected so just take note that its probably more of a side dish than a main! For drinks, my friend and I got the Kvass (rye bread drink) and Keffir (cultured fermented milk) and maybe its just our unadventurous taste buds but didn't really vibe with them, especially the Keffir which had too strong of a taste for me (but apparently, its chock full of probiotics.. healthy things always like that one lah.)

Overall, a really pleasant experience with a new cuisine! Worth a go :)

Loved the food and atmosphere!,Loved the food and atmosphere! We had a wonderful time trying the dumplings and the desserts! Absolutely loved the crepes!! Even had to order takeaway for the dumplings so that my family could try it ASAP Loved the soup too! Would recommend to my friends for sure! I will be back again!!
Authentic Russian Dining Experience,"This was my first time trying Russian cuisine and it was a really interesting experience! I especially liked the combo platter and I had a lot of fun trying to guess which flavour was which. The honey cake just sweet enough for my liking. Overall a unique experience, and I would recommend giving Dumplings-RU a try for those interested in Russian cuisine!"
Russian Food and Experience in Singapore,First time trying Russian food and it was a pleasant experience! The dumpling combo platter was delicious and had a great assortment and the medovik (honey cake) was sweet yet not overwhelming! I love the unique vintage ambience too and the posters and decor were a nice touch. The service was also friendly and quick too!
Russian Makan in SG!,This was my first time trying Russian food and it's worth making the trip to Maxwell Chambers at least once in your lifetime. Appreciate the friendly service staff as well!
Had a good time at Dumplingsru!,"Had a good time at Dumplingsru! Really interesting experience to try out Russian food, and I personally really loved the Chebureki and Medovik!"
Russian Experience,I love experiencing different food and cultures. The food at Dumplings.ru was delicious and it had lots of Vegetarian food options! Highly recommend the Cheese Chebureki!
Enjoyable experience trying,"Enjoyable experience trying the one and only Russian restaurant in Singapore. The dumplings were delicious, bought the combo platter which comprises of 12 unique dumplings.
Tried their dessert too and it was something out of this world!

They have extremely tasty crepes. Definitely recommend them for dessert"
Nice ambience and good food,"Enjoyed the music and the ambience of the space. Dumplings are good, really loved the chebureki! Recommend to come down here to try. Dessert is good but it’s too sweet for my liking, will be perfect for those who really love sweet stuff"
Great authentic Russian food,"Some advice for people who want to have a meal at Dumplings.ru: only go there with an empty stomach!

The food at dumplings.ru was really tasty and filling as well. I only ordered a few dishes, but at the end of the meal I had trouble keeping my tummy flat. I ordered the borscht, some potato and bacon dumplings, the salted herring and finally the cheese chebureki. All the dishes were pretty generous in size, and were all jam packed with flavour as well. Service was incredibly fast, and most of my dishes arrived pretty quickly after I ordered.

All the dishes were good but if I had to choose a favourite, I would say that the potato and bacon dumplings would be the winner. Never would I have thought that simple ingredients like potato and bacon could taste so good in a dumpling, and it really blew my expectations out of the water. I really had a great time here and would love to come back again."
Unique Russian Cuisine experience,First time trying Russian cuisine and I really enjoyed the food. Fresh mix of flavours for the dishes that really satisfies the palate and is really hearty! Good value!
My first Russian Dumplings experience,"I've never had Russian cuisine before in my life, so I was delightfully surprised when I found out there was a Russian eatery near Tanjong Pagar MRT, famous for their Russian Dumplings. I honestly had no idea that Russians had their own version of dumplings and I was incredibly excited and curious to try it out.

Locating the restaurant was relatively easy as it was situated at Maxwell Chambers, right beside Guoco Tower. Upon entering the restaurant, I was greeted by the friendly staff and Russian rock music (that was honestly pretty catchy)

Finally, it was time to eat. I ordered some salted herring (seledka), the beef+pork dumplings (siberian 8ights), the fried cheese puffs (chebureki), before washing it all down with a nice White Russian cocktail. Overall, I was really impressed by the quality of the food. The salted herring reminded me of smoked salmon, but it was much more fragrant and had a stronger aftertaste, making the salted herring my favourite dish. However I was looking forward to trying out the Russian Dumplings the most, and even though they were quite similar to their Chinese counterparts, the Russian dumplings were firmer and had thicker skin, which I also found out were coloured using natural ingredients. The fried cheese puff was pretty simple but satisfying as well.

To conclude, I had a pretty good time at Ang Moh Dumplings (Dumplings.ru). Excited to come back soon in the future to try more of the items on their menu!"
Wonderful Russian food,"It was an extreme delightful time at dumplings ru. We ordered the herring salad as an appetiser which was one of their recommended items to start with which was a good mix of potato, herring and beetroot.
Next up was the dumpling platter x12, cherbureki which was incredibly scrumptious and filling. Would definitely recommend for first time diners looking to try Russian food"
Authentic Russian Cuicine,"My first time trying Russian cuisine and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I’d recommend the herring salad as a starter as the sweet and saltiness of the dish helps to open up your appetite. I also had the dumplings combo platter which allows you to taste all 12 different flavours as well as the cherbureki which was my favourite. It’s a crispy puff pastry with really juicy minced pork in it.

Overall, I had an amazing time here and would definitely be back to try out the other dishes they have."
Unique and bold flavours,The eatery is definitely one with a more casual setting that is suitable for a quick catch up with friends/colleagues. The dishes were suitable for sharing between 2pax and the rich flavours were delivered with every bite. The seledka (salted herring and potatoes) was my personal favourite due to the balaced nature of the dish where the brininess of the herring was balanced out by the potatoes and rye bread. The dumpling combo platter was worth every penny with the minty lamb being my favourite. The meat wasn't over whelmingly gamey and the mint added a delectable fragrace to it. The sour yogurt complemeted the dish very well. This restaurant is a must try for those who are looking for something slightly out of the comfort zone yet not over the top.
Authentic russian cuisine,"The restaurant is in the heart of CBD, a cosy small shop by Maxwell chambers. Was initially not sure what to order but the menu was fuss free and had good translation of the dishes. We went for the dumplings combo platter in the end so we got to try all 12 flavours. I really loved the pork dumplings although some of the beef ones had a strong gamey taste. They paired well with the sour cream sauce. Be sure to pair them with Kvass, a traditional slavic beverage - it goes well with the food. The Pork Chebureki was nice in my opinion!"
Unique to the palette,"Claims to be serving authentic Russian fare, can't quite say if it's indeed authentic, my last memory of Russian fare was a VERY long time ago.

- Ukrainian Borscht Soup (never quite a fan of it in general. Though it was appetising given the tangy tomato soup base)
- Chebureki (the Russian version of curry puff / empanadas. We had ordered 1 each of the pork and cheese. The pastry crust is very thin and I enjoyed the cheese one better only because the pork filling was too salty)
- Combo Dumpling Platter (12 different fillings, differentiated by the different coloured skin. Not too different from the usual Chinese dumplings except these ones are a bit more dry. Love that they offer this combo version so we didn't have to crack our heads deciding which to try. Amongst them, the potato + mushroom was my fav)
- Bell Pepper Rice (fried rice with minced beef and veg then baked in a bell pepper; flavourful rice that didn't taste very wow at first try but kind of grew on me with each mouth until I polished it clean.)
- Dulce de Leche Crêpes (ended with a sweet dessert, I wished it was served as a hot dish rather than cold one though)
- Kompot (traditional fruit punch, a good balance to the intense flavours throughout the night)

Overall an interesting dining experience but can't say I'm a convert now."
Authentic Russian Experience,"Interesting experience trying authentic Russian cuisine for the first time!

Food were interesting and different from the usual Asian flavours we are used to in Singapore. Good variety of dumplings including flavours like Salmon, Minty Ram, etc. Tried their Chebureki (Kind of like a big curry puff), Dumpling Platter, and Seledka (Salted Herring).

If you are seeking for an authentic Russian experience, this is definitely the place to go!"
Russian dumplings,Convenient location in CBD at Maxwell Chambers. Very interesting selection of dumplings(including potato and cheese) and decided to go with the combination platter of 12 to have a little bit of each. Favourite dish was probably the Borscht soup which was big enough for 2 to share!
Russian Cuisine in heart of CBD,"Great convenient location and cosy nook! Loved the atmosphere and food did not disappoint as well. Although I really wished we ordered more foods to try while there! Had the borscht soup and 12 dumpling combo platter. Will recommend the platter for ""beginners"" as it allows patrons a taste of everything!"
First Russian Cuisine in Singapore,"It was my first time trying out a Russian cuisine in Singapore and I would say the ambience of the place were great and cosy! The staff was friendly as well and explained the difference between a few dishes and the recommendations. Overall, I am impressed by the service Kudos to the staff at Dumplings.RU!

I ordered Kotlety and Paneer Cheese Crepes. Chicken Patties served with mashed potatoes & pickles. The chicken pattie have a crunchy texture and it goes well with the mashed potatoes. For the Paneer Cheese Crepes, the texture of the crepe is really good and very flavorful! Overall, the quality of the food is excellent and would definitely come back again to try other dishes :)"
Unique Russian food at Maxwell,"the Dumplings come in so many different variations (my favourite was the beef one) but I would say that the zharkou, traditional Russian stew was the highlight of the night.

The fruit punch and rye drink complemented the food and was also something worth trying.

The staff were really friendly and nice too :)"
Tasty Russian food in Singapore,"First time trying out Russian cuisine in Singapore! Really a unique place with great ambience. The staff was friendly and even took the time to explain to me the dishes that I was contemplating between and additionally gave his recommendation. I was also quite impressed by the service in that when I was almost done with my main dish, the staff asked if she could start preparing the dessert - shows her attentiveness to the customers.

Food wise, I ordered Zharkoe (Traditional stew with pork, potato and vegetables and bread) for my main dish - no regrets this was mindblowing... I also ordered the Dumplings Combo platter which had 12 dumplings each of a different flavour to share with my friend. Although I didn't really fancy the texture of the dumpling skin, i must say that each dumpling's filling was extremely unique (defo must try).

Price wise, it's slightly on the high side but still reasonable. will defo return again to try other dishes that i didn't get to ☹"
Tasty dumplings and stew!,"First off, the service crew was really friendly and helpful with recommending the dishes. The place is quite lively and almost perpetually filled the entire duration that I was there. They seem to have a very wide array of alcohol so I'd probably come back to try them!

For my dinner, I had the dumplings platter which was a great way to try the dumpling flavours that the restaurant offered. I enjoyed the pork and beef dumplings the most. I wasn't a lamb and mutton person so maybe if I could change out the ram dumplings this platter would be awesome.

I also tried the Chebureki. However I found it a bit too hard for my liking. It was quite a mess beating through all that fried dough, and we could not really taste the filling.

But the traditional stew next up, the Zharkoe, was delicious! I love dill so the fact that this dish had dill was perfect. The stew was very hearty, I believe it would be perfect for a rainy day.

Tried the Kompot and Kvass as well, interesting drinks, not very sweet, nothing spectacular.

Would have loved to try the Medovik, unfortunately they weren't selling it that day. Prices are actually quite affordable. Overall I would gladly come back for another try!"
Nice atmosphere with good food,"First of all the atmosphere is really nice. Even down to the russian music that was playing. For food i had the Zharkoe which was a stew of potatoes, veggies and pork, as well as a kompot - a traditional russian homemade fruit punch. The kompot was really delicious in its own way and wasnt sweet, i was delighted to try it. The stew was tasty and complex in flavours because of the mix of ingredients used, overall it worked well as a tasty stew that i finished every drop of."
great food and ambience,"Dined at Dumplings-Ru for the first time today, and was pleasantly greeted with prompt service and high-quality food:) I ordered the Kotlety; chicken patties were juicy & flavourful and the mashed potatoes were buttery & smooth. Food was rather affordable as well, and I would definitely recommend it!"
Dumplings.Ru,"To me, when people talk about Russian food, the 1st thing that comes to my mind is Borscht soup. Being somewhat ignorant about the various types of dishes in Russian cuisine, I had an opportunity to visit Dumplings.Ru to savor its food.

1. Kompot (A traditional Russian fruit punch). The taste was very refreshing & not excessively sweet which suits me just fine so people who love sweet drinks will not like it much.

2. Shuba (Salted herring salad). My favorite! Just the right combo of veggies mixed with the herring makes it a perfect combo for me. Definitely a big thumbs up for me!

3. Ukrainian Borscht soup. Another 1 of my favorites! The soup was thick enough with just the right amount of shredded pork & veggies. Definitely a must try if you visit.

4. Combo platter (various dumplings filled individually with beef, pork, chicken, potatoes, mushrooms all with their own color coded skins). The skin I felt was a tad too thick & distracted me from the fillings inside. If only the color coded dumpling skins were thinner & not so chewy...

For anyone who hasn't been to Russia or tried the cuisine, this place offers it all!"
"Homey, Authentic Russian Food","I loved how stepping into Dumplings-Ru was like stepping into my own perfect slice of Russian heaven. The interior was so cosy, the staff were really friendly and approachable, and the food was overall really good. It is definitely an experience for all of us as we tide through COVID-19 together, would recommend a visit with family and friends!"
