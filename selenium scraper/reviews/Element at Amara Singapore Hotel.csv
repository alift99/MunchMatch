Welcome restaurant,Friendly staffs serve with team work üëç Clean and quiet ambiance within the private room provided which is good for bonding between the family members !
Below standard,Food quality is below average. Our hawker food tastes better. Very limited selection. Food does not get replenished. Very disappointed!!
simple yet satisfying lunch buffet,"really happy to know that Element has resumed their buffet. i used to be a regular as the spread and quality suit me and my family's taste, especially the desserts. staff is always friendly and attentive."
Ok buffet but have rooms for improvement,"I revisited this hotel cafe recently for my buffet dinner. It has been about 8 years since I last dined here and it's just reopened not too long ago.

The cafe was nice, cosy and bright.

The food spread was mainly International, with a spread of Western, Asian and local themed food and overall they were ok (some hits and some misses) though the variety of food is lesser as compared to the other restaurants within the same price range (to be fair comparison).

Some of the delicious food of the night included the chilli crabs (but on the sweet side and not spicy enough), honey pork ribs, curry mutton, bak kut teh soup, cod fish, ee fu noodles, rojak and nonya kuehs/pastries etc. The meat dishes were flavourful.

Do note that there were no oysters but only mussels, clams and prawns unlike other restaurants on same pricing that included oysters, crab legs and even lobsters! (see my earlier review for those restaurants)

Although there were sashimi and sushi maki (but very few varieties), they were not fresh and were very hard (either they got from suppliers or may not prepare them long time ago). And the egg omelette and stir fried vegetables were disappointing, bland and too watery. The stir fried king prawns were not that fresh too and even before eating them, their heads fell off ""automatically"".

Coffee, tea, orange juice, coke, ice cream and fresh cut fruits were inclusive in the buffet. However, during our visit, the coffee machines were having problems as the milk dispenser was faulty, instead of liquid milk, it displaced a whole chunk of cream! And the coke was too diluted too!

As part of the reopening promotion, they now offer 2 glasses of free beer to every diner but for non beer drinker, including children, kids and senior citizens, this promotion was not irrelevant to them and nothing was offered as a replacement. In fact, there were quite a number of these groups of people on the evening I visited. I do know of hotels that practise ""replacing"" the beer with juices or other softdrinks or some with desserts etc.

On the service side, staff were friendly, helpful and generally efficient, i.e. clearing used plates. But the manager or supervisor (in coat), an Indian gentleman. When we arrived at the cafe at 6pm, we were ushered to our table but was told that the buffet would start at 6.30pm but the website when making reservation stated 6.00pm. When we told him that, he said no and told us 6.30pm. But after about 2mins later, he came back and told us we could now take the food as the buffet had started. And throughout our dinning, I noticed a few ""miscommunication"" between staff and manager, that resulted certain tables received the beer, some didn't or sending the wrong quantity etc.

And by around 9.30pm and even before the buffet closed, staff were seemed taking and packing food from the buffet counters, of whom some were seen eating around the bar tables, others elsewhere. There were still diners around taking food!

Overall, my dinning experience was near satisfactory but it has many rooms for better improvement.

Considering on the limited spread of dishes and their quality, the services and basing on the price charged, the buffet was not that worthwhile and on the steepside. In fact, we were a little letdown as our last visit then was much better (even with lobsters then among many other better food).

As mentioned earlier, I could go to another better hotel cafe for better and more varieties of food at the same price (or even cheaper since they have online and senior citizen discounts) and so in the near distant future, will not revisit again, possibly 8 years later? LOL.

Birthday celebration with bestfriend,Superb excellent customer service we got from Jessy & Wendy.. Drinks & foods are applying to our taste & everything..
Poor service and food quality,The service quality is poor and food quality is average. The price is high and portion small. One item took a long time to serve when other diners have finished their food.
Great service at Element Restaurant,"Came Amara hotel for a staycation, if there is anything that impressed me, it is the customer service from Mr Jeffrey Goh at the Element Restaurant during our breakfast.

His customer service is great and attentive to guests in the restaurant. As I went with my parents, when he realised the coffee served is not hot enough for them, immediately replaced another cup of hot coffee for them. The restaurant is only minimally staff, great job Jeffrey! Thank you for your great service!"
"Staff Top-Notch, Food Average","The staff are pleasant but the food is expensive and sadly not too good. When we requested for slightly altered menu types, this sadly couldn‚Äôt be produced."
Amara Hotel Buffet @ The Element,"Went for the Lunar New Year dinner buffet (2/2/22), terrible food served. Food serve not hot and fish got very strong fishy smell, laksa noodles not cook enough and the abalone that came with it so rubbery. Nothing was cooked on the spot, foods served were taken out from the food warmer and they are charging $99+++ for that kind of quality. Very disappointed dinning experience. This will be the first and last time I am dining there."
Excellent Service,"The food is adequate, but the service is what drew my attention to this restaurant. The waitress was nothing but pleasant and provided excellent service to me and my friends from the moment I stepped into this restaurant. She was not just friendly, but also very clear, attentive, and knowledgeable.
I am very impressed, and I hope they continue to do so."
Not worth the price,"The quality of the food was unfortunately not worth the price (about $100 nett per pax). Most of the cooked food are too salty to our taste. Not many food suitable for small kids. Yu Sheng & Dessert were good though. By the way, there is no toilet to use within the restaurant so we had to go inside the shopping mall to use. Plus we got wet by the rain as there is no shelter between the mall and restaurant. So good luck to you if you happen to go there on rainy day or often need to go washroom."
Not as good as remembered,"This was a favourite of my mom, and we used to eat here every once every few months. With the covid situation, we had not visited for a while.

Brought the missus here for high tea and, sadly, it was not as good as I remembered. The Quintessential set looked okay but, tastewise, there was not much of a wow factor. We liked the curry sheperd‚Äôs pie, and the carrot cake was good with the excellent chilli. However, the otah toast, the mini burgers and the various nonya kueh were ordinary.

The set came with a pot of TWG tea, but there was only a teabag for the pot. The tea arrived weak, and with each addition of hot water, it became weaker. The missus jokingly mentioned that we should have brought our own teabags.

The staff were still friendly and efficient, especially the longer serving ones.

Due to Covid measures, you cannot enter through the main hotel entrance, but instead have to walk around to the entrance on Tras street. This should have been communicated when the hotel called to confirm our reservation. Instead, we had to trudge through a torrential downpour to get to the tea."
Excellent Food and Service,"Sometimes, it is not really the food the makes you come back to the place but the service provided by the staff... from the main entrance, they will provide you with warmth welcome til you get assisted to your designated seats. All staff are really nice and kind.
Now., the food.. i would say worth the amount we paid. Very festive and the taste is really good.
Each plate has its own distinct taste and plated very nicely.
I will definitely come back here again and again."
"Excellent food, fantastic service",Went with family for high tea. Food is delicious and service is really good and friendly. Special commendation to Eileen. Highly recommended!
Terrible seafood buffet,Wenthere on our last night in singapore - seafood was poorly handled and obviously old / defrosted - crab was inedible. Extremely expensive buffet with poor choices and quality - look anywhere else. Price was way over the top for what was offered.
Great for gatherings,"Had CNY reunion dinner here. Good experience from reserving (thanks Tia) to having food here. Affordable too. Pleasant surprise for festive food like yu sheng (thank Yvonne for saying the cny auspicious words), sausage rice.
- Seafood- We had the snow crabs, lobster claws - were good + fresh, we added it to the local lakes too and it taste great. Oysters could be better.
- Cooked food - Roast beef leg was good (not dry), had chilli crab with fried buns too, liked the laksa and the
- Desserts - liked the special cempadak torches pudding + mini chocolate sponge cake
- Service - staff were super friendly, greeted us at entering, cleared plates fast and also reminded us about where to get special/signature food"
Seafood that tastes as fresh water.,"One night I only ordered sushi a la carte, that was good. The second night I tried the special seafood buffet. Lobster even the shell was rubbery, the meat had hrd bits in it and did not taste like seafood at all. The Peking duck, the pancake was rubbery, the duck not crispy at all and the hoy sin sauce watery. The oysters were splendid. The shrimps were overcooked and again watery. Pity for a menu of mor than 60 hing king dollars. I talked to the chef and he just raised his shoulders. Apparently he couldn't care less."
"limited but adequate, sashimi was a disappointment","decent buffet here. selection is limited compared to other but adequate. creme brule has a surprising element cempedak! very good. hainanese chicken rice was awesome too. but i am disappointed with sushi station. sashimi is very important bcse its my favorite but the meat cut was filmsy and the station looks empty, chef seems like not engaged. much improvement needed"
Christmas Dinner Buffet,"Helen Kuo's, Margaret Choong's service is excellent, food is great, my in-laws and my wife loved the food, what else can I say ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
So so,"Buffet consist of chinese, western, japanese, korean. Abit of all. Enjoyed har kaw, fried tonkatsu, assorted tempura, beef stew, prawn, some desserts.
Seafood was not very fresh, sushi was not as good.
$60 per pax. It was an okay meal. Probably will not return unless there is a promotion."
A very satisfying diner buffet,"We are happy to choose Element@Amara for our early Christmas celebration. It was a satisfying experience considering the seafood buffet, roasted beef, risotto and desserts they serve. i like the taste of laksa and chilli crab as well. The creme brulee is also perfect. I would understand that it may seem a limited choice to some but for me that taste fills it all. It also feels welcoming that Sharon added to that warmth service they provide. For group gatherings like what we had, we are very well assisted. Other staff are also attentive on clearing up our plates and filling our glasses with water. The laksa/roasted beef station would even gently ask you what you would prefer. Service is at point and i dont expect this to a busy Singapore. Thanks so much Sharon and The rest of Element... All the best to your service team"
Good for group corporate lunches,The unique setting of Element is that their design allows certain level of privacy when you have team lunches. I find the food quite fresh and staff very friendly.
Buffet at Element - Amara Hotel,Variety is very very limited. Slow on refilling water and hardly replenish food. Service is very lousy. Very disappointed. Not worth at all to go. Will not visit again.
One of the worst dining experience I‚Äôve ever had,"My family and I recently came to dine at Element for lunch as it was recommended by my colleague. I was told that it was one of the best buffet experiences he has ever had.

When I got there, I was warmly greeted by a waiter and service was fast and efficient, which was a good impression left by the staff named Aloysius.

However, throughout the lunch period as it got more packed and the restaurant was almost full, I noticed that more manpower is needed to ease the burden of the staff working there.

What infuriated me and ruined my dining experience was when I saw a female waitress/manager, walking from the front of the restaurant all the way to the bar area and chatting with another staff while neglecting diners and helping others.

I also saw that the staff wearing aprons had a logo that says ‚ÄúTeam Amara‚Äù nothing demonstrated during my dining experience showed that the female staff was part of a team.. certainly wouldn‚Äôt want her on mine."
Terrible first impression!,"Wanted to dine in Element Restaurant as to try their buffet spread. Decided to make a call as to make a reservation and was shocked and disappointed just by the phone service!

Lady who picked up the phone call was monotone and had extreme lack of sincerity. Also had to clarify if it was Element Restaurant that I was calling as there was mere silence when phone was picked up. Conversation was short and informal. No apologies or other alternatives were given when a one word answer was responded. ‚ÄòFull‚Äô.

Overall terrible first impression. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be trying this this restaurant anytime soon."
Lack of variety for the price paid,"The main reason for choosing to dine at Element is because of the Amex offer.

Reservation online was a breeze. The system is simple and efficient.

Fast forward to the actual day. Element is located at a corner of the Amara Hotel at ground level, just besides the 100AM mall that is connected to the hotel. Other than the restaurant, it is also connected to an open air pub. Because of this, the seats near the door can be warm as the hot air is constantly let in when the doors are open.

Service is good. Plates are cleared promptly and drinking water is refilled constantly. This is one area that the restaurant has indeed done well and do keep it up.

Next is the food. It has Japanese (sashimi, sushi, rolls), cold seafood (oysters, crayfish, prawns, mussels, crabs, scallops, clams), laksa, cooked dishes, fruits and deserts. The variety is really disappointing for the price ($75++/adult, $38++/child above 6 years old for dinner). Very seldom do I need to go for the same food in a buffet. Not because its tasty, but I have tried almost all the food and I am still not full. This is really disappointing. For other restaurants, the lack of variety is made up for the quality but this is not the case for Element as the taste is mediocre. I got none of the quality nor quantity. The only saving grace is the haagen daz ice-cream (2 flavours). The photos say it all as these are basically what they serve.

Also indicated in my booking is that this is a birthday celebration. Unfortunately, nothing was mentioned by the staff from the point I enter till I left.

I have also overheard other diners commenting that they will not be coming back due to the variety vs the price paid... Overall disappointing experience."
Drinks at Friday night,"Nice ambiance, friendly staff amazing spicy chicken wings But don‚Äôt try butter milk chicken there it‚Äôs worst/tasteless. Variety of beer is good (as I am not a big beer fan) so I liked it personally."
Satisfying buffet lunch,"Attended a Sun lunch event held in Element. Good spread of international food, with fresh seafood, Japanese, Indian, and Chinese selections. Local delights include rojak, satay and a laksa station. The desserts are pretty awesome, recommend the creme br√ªl√©e, chempedak cake, and Haagen daz ice cream!"
1 for 1 dinner buffet,"Food is delicious especially the chilli crab sauce lobster and fried salmon, but food variety is too less. Not as many choices as other hotel buffet. Not worth if u pay full amount here, but 1 for 1 it is OK."
Birthday dinner,"Our first time having family dinner for birthday celebration and we were wowed by the professionalism of the service staff especially Joanne whose friendly and proactive service made our celebration even more memorable. The seafood selections were great with lots of oysters, crabs, lobsters and all kinds of sea shells. Added the meat of lobsters and crabs to the laksa tasted so good. Joanne constantly topped up our glasses of water and made us feel very much at home. She was also very good at taking well composed photos of us for remembrance. Even provided a nice birthday cake with chef‚Äôs artwork as the highlight of our celebration. Thanks to Joanne and all the friendly and very hardworking staff at Element! You all made our day / night there! We will be back again."
Great place good food & drinks !!,"I organised a team get together of 20 pax. The team of Tia, Anne, Mary, Helen & Jimmy took care of us very well. A great & helpful staff ensured that all the guests are well taken care of. The drinks menu is quite comprehensive to cater to all kinds of drinks lovers. Tapas were awesome!! Nice ambiance and quiet a easy reservation process. Overall it‚Äôs a great experience with Element!!!"
"For any hotel buffet patron, Element@Amara would the name to remember","If it is Singapore Airline premier airline you travel, then it would be Element at Amara Hotel you would like to dine at. Fantastic excellence cruise with elegant presentation. Elegant and yet comfortable dinning ambient."
Really bad service. Seems like waitress more interested to serve foreigners,"The service is right down horrendous. The Filipino waitress ignored us totally when we called for her to take orders when we were seated outside. She was busy chatting with a table of foreigners and didn‚Äôt even bother to acknowledge us despite us calling for attention thrice. She saw us walking away and again, ignored us. This is totally the worst service anyone can get here in Singapore. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone."
Dinner at element on trust,Very good service from Tia at element. Very good environment and good food. Good location. We had the tapas and it was nice . We will be back again . Service is excellent from the waiters . Food portion is just nice
Dinner @ Element on tras,"Great environment made even better with the service provides by Tia. She was friendly, made great food suggestions & we will be back for more outings here. Suggest this aa a wonderful option for dinner & there is also a great lunch option."
Excellent reception staff & concierge especially Mr. Raymond,"Reception staff is very helpful & quick in Service. Concierge Mr Raymond helped me out in a big way, as i was visiting for first time in the city. Highly recommend Amara hotel for future engagements."
Element on Tras Bar,"After a morning of sightseeing sometimes you need a nice salad with wine and lemonade. Anne found me that perfect lunch, it was great."
Dinner at Element,I had made a reservation thru Mr Westly Chai for buffet dinner on 10 of August and well served by Sharon and Lisa.. Very well spread of verities of dishes.. Friendly and helpful staffs. Will come back for family gathering again..
Sunday High Tea,"We had an enjoyable sunday high tea at Element in Amara Hotel. Food was good. Excellent service by Joanne Toh, Fock Mei Lu, Thana and Si En. They are friendly and provide very prompt service. Thumbs up to the wonderful team!! üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª"
Hi tea buffet,"Lots of varieties & widespread of delicious food. Excellent services with good team work especially the newly-appointed F&B Mgr, Mr Wesley Chai, who was very friendly, humble, attentive & helpful. Ms Sharon & Mr Thana‚Äôs services were very excellent .
With the presence of the trio, teamwork at the AMARA is commendable. A good example to follow.

At the Tea-room, Ms Jojo is very hardworking together with friendly Supv.

Will patronise Amara again."

National Day eve dinner,"Food ,ambience plus EXCELLENT service from Sharon and her fellow colleagues -fock meiling and Joan. The kitchen crews are also very helpful."
Drinks and dinner at Element Tapas bar,"It‚Äôs my first time at the tapas bar. A relaxed and chill atmosphere. I had a really good time. The staff was very friendly and service was amazing.

We had a super deal that was pretty amazing. It included a bottle of wine and four dishes. Tia was very kind to explain to us the promotions available. We will definitely be back again!"
dinner,average buffet food quality. limited variety. service needs to be improved. always need to ask them to refill ice water. dirty plates not cleared quickly and the restaurant is not even busy.
High Tea,Not great service and not attentive to requirements. Had to keep asking for type of items for high tea. Another group of young girls arrived and was attended to with even Chef coming to share their menu items.d Definitely not recommending.
Element Restaurant,"We went for the buffet dinner at Element Restaurant and it offers a wide variety of food. Seafood on ice was very fresh, main course was awesome with their black paper crayfish and chili crabs. Deserts and ice cream was super tantalizing. Worth the visit."
"Good service, great atmosphere!",I live nearby and often come to this place for a beer or some light food. Thank you for ALWAYS smiling and excellent service girls! Highly recommended!
Dining at Element,"Dinning experience is wonderful. The staff Joanne, went extra mile to DIY birthday cake for my husband. Service staff Joanne Sharon and Meiling were very friendly and helpful. Introduce Amera signature dessert creme Brulee....is Awssome"
1-for-1 buffet dinner,"Slow and miserable replenishment of fresh lobsters, like 5 to 8 pcs every 30min. Variety spread v limited. Fresh seafood on ice and Japanese corner of average quality. Definitely not worth if paying full price. Go for 1-for-1 buffet if must but wouldn't recommend if going for value for money. Cooked lamb extremely hard.
Waitering service is prompt and good."
Great food and ambiance,Food at the restaurant was delicious and there were many selections to choose from. The staff was friendly and very accommodating. Great service!
Looking for perfection ?,We are from Malaysia and we decided to try out Element's lunch buffet. Everything here is sooo good be it service or food. A big shout out to RAV and also MUN FEI for their excellent service in assisting us. The other service crews here are very friendly as well. We felt so loved and homely by their kind gesture. Highly recommended to all
dinner buffet at amara,"i had dinner with some friends at the buffet restaurant at amara hotel, the spread is delicious and plentiful, especially the seafood (fresh oysters and the baby lobster with chilli crab sauce). the service staff was friendly and responsive, especially sharon and sien, props to them and keep up the good work! i will recommend others to come here, especially with the dbs 1 for 1 offer, its very worth it! :)"
very good customer service and food,Chef came out from kitchen to the table to explain each dish that he cooked. It was interesting to be able to ask questions and have answers directly from the chef.
Wonderful Hotel & Best Staff,"Hotel is very nice. Rooms are Very spacious. Breakfast is good. Staff are really really very nice. Specially Citi , Raghu and Raymond are the best people in hotel that makes you come back to the hotel again again. Guys you made our stay memorable. See you soon. Thank you."

Excellent service with a smile!,"Vithyah and Rav made my lunch time. I only stopped by for a quick lunch and ended up having so much fun with them! Great wine and I even got a cheeky ice cream sundae!

Definitely swing by if you want some Al fresco sangria."
Excellent experience,"Although we arrived early, we were given a very warm and professional welcome. The food was fresh and delicious. There was a decent amount of variety and the staff were very friendly and attentive to our needs. They have earned a return customer!

The assistant outlet manager Mr Murugaiah was particularly helpful and took the time to answer our queries."
Good service,"I Would like to extend my thank you to Margaret Choong and all the hardworking restaurant crews for their swift working pace in clearing the tables of the used buffet plates.
The crew members are middle age and above, but they are all matured, polite and experienced.
Well done Element crews. Thumbs up to you!!!"
Lunch at element.,excellent service and tasty food! Really impressed with Mr Rav & Ms Vithyah service üëçüëçüëç Recommended for business lunch and meeting. Very convenient and 5 mins walk from Tanjong Pagar MRT Station. Worth to come!!
Element @ Amara Singapore,The lunch set is super value for money. The food is very up to standard for the price. And service by Vithyah and Rav is superb. A great place to come back for lunch. A loving place for gathering with friends and colleagues.
Nice salmon and oyster with good service!,"The salmon and oysters are so fresh! I like the cempedak creme br√ªl√©e too!

Amara Hotel (Element) - Birthday Celebration,"Overall is good, especially waitress Si En. One point to note, the cook who prepared the laksa is too calculative. He gave me 3 prawns initially but put 1 back after he pondered for awhile. I detest people who is so calculative especially I am a regular of elements. Overall the rest of the staff service is good!

Element on Tras,Dropped by for the Breakfast on High one weekend and was pleasantly suprised by the quality. Good food and fantastic service from our Captain Vithyah ! Grest value and will definitely come back again!
Quality buffet selection,My mum and I just visited Amara Hotel‚Äôs buffet. What I love about this place is the quality selection of food. Majority of items seem to be carefully handpicked and food is fresh and tastes great! I especially love the dessert selection of Lychee Cake and Creme Brulee today. The salmon sashimi is not laid out like the usual buffets and they slice it as you tell the chef. Super fresh! Thanks Mei Ling (same name as my mum) and Raj! My second time here and so far quality is consistent even though variety is not too wide.
Food and service is super üëçüëçüëç,"Thanks to Sharon, Mei Ling and cheng Si En who have made our first visit at element memorable and enjoyable. We came here first time because we are looking for good and nice seafood. Indeed this restaurant provided such. Besides we also had a surprise of a mini birthday cake from the hotel though this is not their usual practice. We are thankful for their wonderful service and we will surely come back again and recommend people to come too. With thanks from Michael & Angela Leong ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Buffet dinner with 30 members of FPAG,"Amara Element Singapore

The restaurant has good spread of dishes ranging from cold seafood, Japanese tempura to roast lamb. 

Desert is also spread with nyonya cakes to English pudding and variety of cheese to satisfied the most demanding customers from many countries. 

The staff are very friendly and courteous. 

Recommended for large groups, family or private company gathering."
Buffet dinner at Element,"Great value at 50% off on eatigo. Delicious and fresh seafood especially the lobster, oysters and crab legs. Reasonable hot food choices, salads and desserts. Also sushi and tempura. And 4 types of cheeses. Excellent service from the staff particularly Si En. We will return."
Element Restaurant,"Meal here was quite satisfying except I felt it was abit weird that there is not much drinks here, eg fruit punch or peach tea etc, the dessert bar was quite small to me too. i hope there were more cakes or ice cream flavours to choose from"
Best service on earth in Element @ Amara Singapore,"I visited Element @ Amara Singapore on 5 June to celebrate my birthday. The services were fantastic. Staffs were extremely pleasant and attentive. From the time my booking thru phone, the welcoming upon arrival, the ushering and finally the arrangement of a birthday cake with birthday song really displayed very high standard of services. Special mention are Rav, Margaret, Joanne and Cathy. Your high standard of services deserved commendation. Amara Singapore having you all are assets to be treasured. Thanks for creating such a happy and memorable birthday dinner. Thanks."
Element Restaurant,"Happy with foods n service. Special thanks to Rav, Margaret, Joanne n Cathy. Will strongly recommend to all my friends n members for fantastic foods n services. Will be support next time visit in Singapore."
Dinner at Element,"My first visit at element and it was a memorable visit. Many thanks to the staff, especially ravi, Joanne, cathy and Margaret. Will be visit soon for the food and excellent service. Took time to recommend various good food."
Excellent server,I am very pleased with this young female server who is very diligent in clearing used plates . She serves with a sweet smile . Food is awesome . Plenty of seafood ! Good job Element !
Mary liu,"Tonight we came to element on tras bar again after official hour, this bar is a great bar to have drinks and chat with friends, with convenient location that u only need 5 minutes walk to mrt station, thanks for the good service from Mary"
What a great place at element,Went for a few casual drinks and had a great time. Food was amazing and price very reasonable. Our servers Mary and Kate were really helpful and made our evening memorable. We would definitely come back
Nice food and Good service...,"strongly recommend, nice and yummy food, fresh seafood, nice environment. Mr. Thana and his staff all very friendly and helpful. Will go again . Thank you ."
Worth the price,"We visited the place last night with my group of friends. I'm a bit skeptical that one of my friend booked the place of all dining buffet around the metro, just because the feedback of my closest friend from the other group is not so good (they visited the quite sometime) Anyway, I haven't try this one so let's go and the price for the dinner buffet is like affordable.

I am surprised when I entered the restaurant the vibe is cool, its not crowded because maybe they just limit the tables. The variety it's not much but they served the best of what they have, from seafood to desserts.. You will enjoy and taste whatever you will put in your plate rather than busy getting lots of food, and end of the day you can't figure out what you've enjoyed the night.

I can recommend this restaurant if you want to have a good time and good food with your friends and family."
Element at Amara,The staff at Element bar is very friendly and always meet guests with a smile. Met Mary there when I visited a few times and she‚Äôs always cheerful no matter how busy the night was. Always happy to drink at Element!
Element @Amara,Came here many times with friends. Love the cold beer here especially Peroni. More than decent bar food with attentive staffs like Mary and Kate. Nice place for happy hour and people watch. Thanks to all staffs for taking care of us.
Lazy sunday al fresco breakfast!,"Our Sunday morning breakfast was pleasant and made more lovely by the attentive Outlet Manager Mr Rav - his service and staff was commendable! He personally saw to our orders - we ordered the a la carte breakfast sets, reasonably priced at 7:50 SGD which comes with coffee or tea - all freshly prepared! Mr Rav was so kind to prepare a small slice of cake for my godson who was turning 3 that day! Thanks again for your hospitality! Will be back!"
Nice place to have a drink,"Perfect location with 3 minutes walk to MRT , there is also a shopping mall next to this bar ,good service from Mary Liu who is from China, like her friendly smile, love nice tapas food here ,all in all, Elements on trash bar is the best place to hang out with friends, I will keep coming here! Awesome"
Worth for the price,"I went with a 1 for 1 promotion, the food overall was good. the waitress was good in service. just one thing, the dessert bar was not cold enough. the cake was melt and it spoilt some appetite."
Experience spoilt by 1 chef,"It was mother's day 12th May 2019. Everytime was fine until the chef at the seafood counter spoilt the day. Asked for oyster for 2 pax and was only given 2. Asked for more, he gave another 2. Asked if oyster was only upon request when it was a buffet. Got a straight YES from him and he walked away. Spoilt my evening."
EXCELLENCE SERVICE from Element@Amara SIN,"After viewing Element@Amara on 20.Mar.19 with help from Mr Ravana, Outlet Manager. I have decided to held my Secondary School Gathering after his patience in explaining and accommodating to my requests which 02 other hotels I had visited do not shown the same enthusiasm which he had rendered.
We just had a ‚ÄúWonderful & Memorable Dinner‚Äù on 04.May.19 with an attendance of 77 people including teachers and across the same batch (classmate‚Äôs & school mates) which we graduated in Year 1985/1986.
I would like to thanks Ravana - Outlet Manager, Sharon - Asst. Outlet Manager and Joanne - Supervisor who have been showering with their patience and care during our time there. Special thanks to Joanne who has come back for this event !

Thumbs up for them as those who turned up for this gathering really enjoyed themselves and we had a Great time catch-up with one another.

I will not hesitate to recommend to my friends and social circle.

Bravo to Rav, Sharon & Joanne once again and the team of staff for the nights !!!

You Are A ‚ÄúS T A R S‚Äù.
