Server,Polite & quick response when attend to. Full of information given & was cheerful. Explain in simple manner.
Food review,"The honey charred chicken and mushroom soup were yummy ! However, the laksa tasted stale and nowhere close to that served at Yishun blk 925 which were cheap and good. That was a disappointment to my invited guest who still missed the honey charred chicken !"

Fresh & hot dinner at your doorstep...,"Our family of 4 had our Saturday dinner delivered from Lighthouse Bistro.

We had green 4x green salad, 2x Lobster Pasta & 2x Salmon Fillet.
I must say the green salad was fresh with the perfect sauce. The pasta was delicious with generous pieces of fresh crayfish in shells. The fillet was exceptionally nice.

The food were hot when it reached our house, only shows their urgency & their promise of fresh food right at your doorstep.

Thank you Lighthouse Bistro. We enjoyed our dinner very much.
PS: Lighthouse Bistro procures halal-certified vendors for their meat & poultry..."
Good ambience,Good ambience. Very accessible as it is near to the Lavender MRT station. Food is decent and the price is reasonable.
Birthday dinner,"On Wednesday 13/11/19, I made a reservation for 2 for Thursday 14/11/19 @ 6pm. We arrived before 6pm. We were standing at the entrance waiting for someone to show us to the table. We saw a table with 2 menu on it so we sat down. One of the waiter who was attending to other customer came by I gave him the name that was used to make the reservation. When I sat down, the sun reflected on the glass windows of the building opposite into the bistro. It was quite blinding. I was using my hp to block the sun. We asked for a change of seat. The reply from the same waiter was the sun will go down in a while. The same waiter told me there are only a few tables for 2 and the sofa. A while later, a couple came in and was shown to a table that was set for 4 (which was behind us) and the same waiter separated the table from 4 to 2. We asked why that couple was given that table and when we requested for a change of table, we were not given. The same waiter said they made reservation. So did we! Such terrible service! We left and went to TWG."
A Good Dinner With Family,My family each of us ordered different mains so that we could try everything! Would say that the food is very good and the seafood are fresh Would definitely go back again
Reasonable price and warm hospitality,"My husband recommended me to this restuarant. He came once a week before with his friend and was impressed with the service and nice food ie feels like tasty well cooked comfort food.
We visit the restuarant yesterday. Indeed I was in for a surprise when i was in a very unassuming location. We were received with nice and warm service personnel in cute and clean sailor navy blue uniform. Cosy place for a good and comfortable lunch. Just feel so relax in that atmosphere. Have not eaten such nicely cooked, well-plated (clean and neat) and reasonably priced Executive set lunch (although mine has no dessert) for a long time. Just felt nostalgic at this restuarant. It brings back memories, like deja vu. I am not a mariner but feels like one, enjoying a meal at a place that brings back fond memories.
Will definitely bring my children, family members and friends there in the weeks to come. Hope they also serve set dinners ( because sometimes you just cannot find time to go there for lunch ). That would be awesome ! I can come for lunch and dinner. I am very sure they will enjoy the meal as much as I do.
Kudos to all the staff at Lighthouse. Having lunch there was a lovely experience for me. Thank you!"
Awesome dinner,The food we ordered were delicious and the service was excellent. The staff also asked if we have a union card to get 15% discount. I‚Äôm really impressed. Thank you Lighthouse Bistro!
Cosy restaurant,"The portions are big and good for sharing. Delicious food. Especially like the pasta with Sambal and the grilled fish dish.

Service is pleasant. Been going back a couple times."
Excellent place,"Delicious food, good ambience and perfect service. Waiter Andy was very helpful and attentive. Highly recommended."
Very good food,I brought my fianc√© to lighthouse and he gave me a ‚Äòvery good‚Äô for the recommendation. He said I should brought him earlier to enjoy such good food. We will definitely visit again for sure. The dessert is really nice as well. Well done!
"Feels like home, excellent service, excellent food!","Staff at Lighthouse Bistro were really friendly and attentive. Food exceeded my already high expectations, and arrived quickly. Celebrated my partner's birthday here and both of us got surprised by the complimentary cake! We definitely had a great experience and will be back again!"
Good as ever.,"Every year when we come to Singapore we make a visit to Light house Bistro. Visited it this time as well.
Thistle we had Veg pasta, Firsherman Angles Pasta, Wagu Beef Burger and Chicken Confit.
All the dishes were as good as ever, except Chicken Confit which was stringy rubbery and one had to keep chewing it on and on and on like a bubble gum. Disappointed."
Chefs let down by waiters,"Great food let down by inattentive staff - while my partner and I enjoyed our meals, the service was appalling and as we were the only customers at the time, there is no excuse. There was no urgency to attend to us for our order or reordering of drinks or even clearing our entrees and drinks. Food was what was expected at this price bracket, but we were left with a bad taste in our mouths not by the food but by the service received."
Fantastic Meals,"4 of us had lunch here with different choices of dishes and desserts. All satisfied: delicious foods, great recommendations from the staff, fast cooking time, cozy environment. Highly recommended for family and friends."
Excellent food and service .,Good place to hold small gathering. Food and service are good. Pricing are decent. Easy to find. 3 mins walk from lavender MRT.
good eating,"Having read previous reviews had an idea what to expect ,my wife and I wern't disappointed, starter of spicy king prawns, and garden salad excellent both went for seafood platter to follow and really enjoyed, ambience great and enjoyed listening to a group of young men having a discussion about golf, just a very nice local restaurant with great food and atmosphere, would definitely recommend."

Enjoyable meal,"Prompt Service
Attentive Servers
Value For Money
Chef know what he or she is cooking
Comfortable environment"
NIce dinner at Lighthouse Bistro with good service,"We had a nice dinner at Lighthouse Bistro - the food was good-sized and well prepared, and service was polite and attentive. Reasonably priced too!"
"Unassuming place, good food","When I first read the review by a regular food critic, I was skeptical. I mean... I‚Äôve never heard of this restaurant and it wasn‚Äôt even in the more fashionable part of town.

But located opposite Hotel V, it is exactly as was described in a review. A nondescript entrance makes it almost missable.

But the place surprised me. Service was courteous and attentive. Food was really good. The spicy squid in seafood board was really excellent. I liked the gravy so much I used it on pretty much everything I ate. The angel hair pasta was delicious as was the seafood fried rice. The food is somewhat zhichar meets European, but very well executed. We had a Ch. Fongaban 2016 and it was perfect! Juicy, smooth, adequate fruit....

Overall the place exceeded my expectations. You know the food‚Äôs good if the kids enjoyed it too."
Christmas holidays,"We have stayed in near this little gem 2 times and never went in. But this year we did well
wish we had done this earlier. What a great place food and service. We booked at the last minute on new years eve and the fitted us in. if you want nice food head here.
Thanks to the staff and chefs for a fantastic meal and cocktails."
Never fail me!,Lighthouse once again impress me of their service and food standard! This is my 5th time and I still love their food sooo much.
As good as ever !,"During our visit my son makes it appoint to take me to Light House. This time also we went there . Over a period of as many years this was my third visit.
I found that there is no change whatsoever in d√©cor, ambiance, seating arrangements etc. since my last visit. They all were as soothing , pleasing and good as I had found them during my last visits.
This timewe ordered. Honey Charred Chicken, Pan Seared Sea bass, Musterd Herb Chicken, Fisherman's Angle Hair, Gambas Aglio.
All of us sampled each other's dish. Every one of them was really really good.
In my openion a must visit place."
everything is good,everything is good. lamb shank was tender and the mash is infused with garlic. lobster pasta has an asian homely taste
"Great service, good food",Staff was great! Food was good. Nice ambience.. n the staff was really patient with us being the last to leave.
Elegant Restaurant in the Neighbourhood,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful dinner there on Saturday night with Honey Charred Chicken and Seafood Aglio Olio. The chicken is better than average but the Aglio Olio taste is excellent, the spiciness is the best we ever had.1 bad experience I would like to highlight. I booked the last reservation of the day on Chope app which is 21:30 but the restaurant called to inform the kitchen closes at 21:30 and asked if we could hurry. How can this be happening? However, the staffs are also polite and nice to us even though we ""are late"" for the last order.I suggest Chope to remove the 21:30 option for this restaurant."
Nice place for an enjoyable meal,"As usual, service was excellent. Staff were very attentive and friendly. Food was also of good quality."
Food with sincerity,"Nice food, well prepared. We like it very much. Nice environment, great location since near to lavendar mrt and good service."
Great food n great service,"Great appetizers n service.. other than the wagyu beef was abit disappointing, we were all pretty happy with the rest of the food."
Underrated and should be in the spotlight,"Had visited the bistro a few times and recently, we decided to hold our family gathering of 7+3. Food, service and ambience were great. Ideal dinning place for family."
Great food with great service,"I brought my wife & daughter for a late lunch today. The food was great! My daughter ordered the Fisherman‚Äôs Angel Hair Pasta, my wife ordered Grilled Sea Perched & I ordered the Tiger Fish & Fries. We are amazed by the portion & freshness of ingredients used. Besides the food, we have been very satisfied by the service provided. We will return :)"
Fantastic meal with desserts,Took my wife and son there to enjoy the free kids meal promo during June. We ordered sea perch and steak. They were good. We then ordered the panna cota and lava cake. They were fantastic. My son enjoyed his seafood pasta and ice cream too
Lunch,Very exquisite cutlery and tableware. Good wine glasses used. Attentive and friendly service staff. Fresh seafood. Tasty food. Will come back again.
"Fantastic atmosphere, fantastic food and fantastic service.","10/10 will come again... I've been to this place countless of times and back before they did the renovation. It's classier now, suitable for romantic dates to gatherings as well. The menu has also been revamped too but still as delicious (or even more if I dare say). The service was also on point as they are friendly and attentive.

My favourite would be their Asian lobster pasta. The pasta is cooked perfectly al denta and each mouth was flavourful. The seafood was also fresh. It is downright addictive and I had it 2 days in a row, even my dad who doesn't favour western dishes loves it. Other dishes that I've tried would include the Seafood fried rice and the rib-eye wagyu which is worth every cent."
Yummy platter with Rose Wine,Returned the 2nd time this round to have drinks and lighthouse platter. Asked the server to introduce us a Rose wine & the only choice in the House was good and very reasonably priced! We ordered a platter to go with our wine & that was a perfect match!
Good food and good service,We had the steak and garlic squid. Both were excellent. Great service too. Quiet place and very close to the MRT if you dont' want to deal with the bad parking situation around there.
Excellent food,Never fails the taste buds . repeat visit and we often come there for lunches. looking forward for next visit.
Nice ambience n good food.,"The tile says it all.
It was a nice place to meet friends and catch up. Food was good. N service was great."
Great Food & Great Place,Enjoyed the food with my BFF. Will visit the place again definitely. Great ambience. We enjoyed our dinner.
Lunch,"superb western cooking, never fail us whenever we visited the restaurant for lunch or dinner. There were photos taken of the food, will upload when I get it from another hp."
Cosy and friendly bistro,Every dish that we ordered came nicely presented. The food tasted just as pleasing to the taste buds. The staff are friendly and experienced. They were attentive and ready to make suggestions if they sensed that you need a little help. I‚Äôll definitely come back many times more.
Great food with excellent service,A hidden gem indeed. Ambience is great with excellent service. Food selection is mainly western but the Asian Lobster pasta is a must try.
Good food and service,Happy to discover this gem! Food and service were both good. Enjoyed the lobster pasta! Craving for it right now! Nice ambience too.
Lunch at Lighthouse Bistro,Lovely ambience. Christmas decorations already up and really put us in the festive mood. Very tasty food and good portion sizes. Seafood very fresh.
Second lunch set,"This is my second time visit, the fried tiger fish is very crispy outside and tender soft inside. Coffee americano with milk is very strong, dense and smooth. The aqua marine mocktail is a good choice to cool down."
New menu items. Good quality & service,"There are always new items available and this time, we ordered 2 of their new items, lamb shank and asian lobster pasta on top of our usual fav, fisherman's board. Lighthouse bistro has never disappoint us. Lamb shank was tender and served in generous portion. Asian Lobster pasta was flavourful. We shall return to try the desserts next time."
Glad we visited!,"We're a family of four just visiting Singapore for 1 x night, were looking for a nice meal in a good environment, this was great! Meal was excellent ( we had Lamb Shanks), and dessert is a MUST! I had the Salted Caramel Chocolate cake, others had Pisang Island dessert - both were perfectly prepared & presented, tasted superb! Recommend this restaurant."
Cosy bistro,"Cosy bistro with friendly service staffs. Excellent food especially the Asian lobster pasta. Got the 'wok hei'.
Not to be missed the spicy garlic prawns, Parmesan cheese garlic bread, Honey Charred Chicken & Salted caramel Chocolate lava cake.
A great place for good food & wine."
Great Service Great Food!,"It's my second time to Lighthouse and I still love the food as much. I brought a different group friends and they enjoyed the food so much. Service needless to say, as usual attentive and friendly. I will definitely come again! *thumbs up"
Fine dinning at budget price,"I am pleasantly surprise with the quality of food and service. The food presentation is good. There was few people that night, but I guess few people know of this little gem hidden in an industrial area."
Prefect confit chicken!!,Loved it dine there tonight the main meals were executed perfectly. But winner of the night was pisang desert amazing! And the service was very good.
The Cornerstone of Excellence Food @ Lavender,A stone throw away from Lavender MRT. A small and cosy restaurant where both the food and service is really good. The fusion ‚Äúmee goreng‚Äù is one the highly recommended dish. You will surely fall in love with it. The manager Dewy is also very attentive and helpful where she will be able to advice you on the best wine to go with your main. Do drop by if you are around this area.
A MUST try restaurant,"Nice ambience, great service and superb food. the food are of great quality. Highly recommend. Must try the fisherman's board"
Delicious mee goreng,This was excellent ambience in a setting at the fringe of the city centre. The mee goreng was delicious.
Dinner at Lighthouse Bistro,"Tried all 3 kinds of soup, tiger fish & fries, lobster pasta, rib eye steak, honey charred chicken, smoked duck breast and lava cake. Taste of mushroom soup is good but would be better if it is thicker, wouldn't recommend prawn bisque to people who can't appreciate prawn heads. Lobster for pasta was huge and juicy. Ordered medium for rib eye but it's abit tough. Lava cake is moist and not overly sweet. Set lunch is available too. Service was great but can be improved. Love the ambience, great for anniversary with the company of wine."
As good as last time.,"We had visited lighthouse bistro couple of months back. Basically there was no change. The ambience, the staff the service were as good as we had found during our last visit. Change was, this time we had gone for lunch and had moctails. We ordered Hot lime, summer kiss. I ordered Fly me to the Moon . I do not go to the moon but the mocktail was good. My recommendation to all in case you do not love extra chilled drink remove all the ice cubes. They only dilute the drink.
On the menu were Gambas Aglio Olio, Honey Charred Chicken with Sweet Potato fries, Asian Lobster Pasta and Member's special lunch menu. Between five of us we ordered all of them so we could test all. All the dishes were GOOD.
Worth a repeate."
"Pleasant atmosphere, Attentive staff","Quiet & pleasant atmosphere.
Staff is very attentive . They will clear away your dishes once u have done eating. Asking when you would like to serve your desserts.
All was perfect with exception that the ribeye was still not cook to medium rare. Have to ask the cook to re-cook as it was too rare to eat."
Warm and friendly with good food,"A very good meal here of smoked duck with lovely mash, asparagus, tomato and red wine jus. Would prefer fresh duck breast as flavour of smoke was a bit too much. Husband had lobster and pasta which he enjoyed enormously. Shared a huge plate of calamari with chicken floss to start - very yummy and the house red was just fine. The best thing - the very lovely staff with their warmth and great chat. Thanks."
Prefect place for business lunch,"Experienced waiting staff and fisherman board a good choice to pinch then talk.
Location is near to MRT"
Reasonable price with good food,Great ambience! Friends and I enjoyed! Would be keen to try other food selection next round! See you next round!
Fantastic service and food.,I've lost count as to how many times I've visited this restaurant. I have tried different dishes each time I am there. It always exceeds my expectations and have me wanting more... The price is actually very reasonable for the standard of food offered and the classy but yet comfortable atmosphere. It makes for the perfect place to hold events as well. Definitely highly recommended! The staff are also very friendly and attentive.
Best Western Food at reasonable price & Very Good Ambience,"my family is a regular at this marvelous bistro - for all western food events.

the staffs are courteous and the prices are very reasonable for a restaurant."
Saturday lunch set,"Food quality is good and portion is big. The environment is nice, very few people in the weekend lunch time. The staff is very friendly."
Everything is just great!,"The title said it all.
The serving were bigger portion than we expected Foods were well presented and tasted yummy! Will definitely go back for sure!"
Best meal!,Me and my Mum visited here last night. We are staying close by and it was just a stroll away. Our dinner was amazing! Very well cooked and really delicious. Cocktail was great also! We are hoping to drop by again before we leave back for Australia. Very well priced also.
Great Time,"enjoyed very much the entire 3 courses meal with wine, good value for money. got a discount as we live next door at Ciltylights !"
Palatable angel hair mee goreng,"It was clever of the restaurant to give their signature pasta (angel hair) complimentary in July 2017 for min. 2 diners with min. spend $35. Usually compliementary dishes will be sub-standard, but for lighthouse bistro, it was their signature. Well done."
Very good service and tasty food :),"Service is good, food presentation and taste is outstanding. Do keep up the good work. Will definitely visit again."
Nice price with reasonable price,"The food are nice and the price is reasonable. The ambience is nice too.
The restaurant was neatly located."
A Unique place,"Here is the answer as to why unique ;
Light House Bistro Bar is located in the same building as Singapore Marine Officer's Union.
It offers special privileges to members of Singapore Marine Officer's Union.
As one of the privilege,once in awhile , as a promotion, at dinner time admittance is restricted only to members of Singapore Marine Officer's Union that too only by reservations .
My son is a member of Singapore Marine Officer's Union.
Saturday the 8th July was one such day . Reservations were made for 1730 hours.
Light House Bistro and Bar is located in heart of Singapore and it's commercial district . Along with location the ambiance is under stated but pleasing..
Staff is friendly and polite.
Service prompt and efficient.
We had ordered Italian dishes from the menu , which were , Soup: Prawn Bisque Main course : Chicken Comme with pomme puree , fillet of Sea Bass with sweet pepper sauce , Asian Stirr Fried Lobster pasta with Lumpfish roe . For Dessert Chocolate Lava fondant with ice cream . For drinks Tango Berry.
Presentation of the dishes was artful and pleasing to the eye.
The food was good and tasty . Value for money.
The quality of food and service at other times and days is equally good.
Strongly Recommended ."
Great food and service,Ordered the angel hair seafood pasta which was delicious. Tasted like our local mee goreng but with better types of seafood. Beef steak was cooked as per ordered. Nutella pie was yummy!
