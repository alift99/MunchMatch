Christmas Meal with the Family...,"We booked the Christmas set dinner and we were delighted we did - 4 of us ate, 2 chose the duck whilst the others chose wagyu steak and the lamb! Portions were very generous, but more importantly it was cooked to perfection and the overall 3 courses served were excellent.
What differentiates more than the food is the setting and the service, the team are very attentive, always willing to give advice and interact - special shout out to Dora who looked after us brilliantly a good way to start the festive celebrations!"
Never disappointed by Les Bouchons,"Never once I was disappointed with their food here. The serving portion, quality and value are all top notch. The garlicky escargot serves well with the bread. The black angus ribeye is a hefty 300g served with salad and fried to perfection French fries."
So much better then the one at Ann Siang,"Firstly I would like to say I’m really impressed by the manager Helen - she was very attentive and hospitable to all the guests & I even noticed that she personally made sure the chairs were aligned and tucked in properly after people left (haven’t seen this outside of Japan ). The staff were really friendly and efficient as well!

I was not particularly fond of Les Bouchons after a rather mediocre experience at their Ann Siang outlet (service was really bad), but our experience tonight at the Robertson Quay one has really changed my mind!

Also, our steaks were cooked perfectly despite them being so busy"
Fantastic Dining Experience - Steak was Superb,"The service by Zet was top notch! Brilliant and it made the entire meal so enjoyable, welcoming and cosy The beef steak was superb and really loved every bite of it Oooh the free flow of fries was decadent Will definitely go back again and again"
-,I would just like to highlight the excellent service by the restaurant manager Zet ! Thanks for accommodating my family and adding that extra human touch that may not exist in many restaurants… we appreciate !
Still one of the best ...,Got to say that I have been going here for many years and it still performs great! The steaks were cooked perfectly and tasted good as well - we had both sauces! Their pate is still one of the best and the wine was reasonablely priced as well. All in all - still one of the best!
"possibly bad Saturday service, but a clear miss","Saturday 8pm booking post COVID. they were obviously with brisk business.
now. menu is very specialized on grilled meat (I cannot comment on the Saturday Couscous).
the restaurant by itself is OK; the terrace is kind of OKish, nothing special but frankly this goes with the location. i do not think they claim to be stylish restaurant.
In the situation, we got the snails. snail is a bit more tricky that it may be (i am French, and i love snail): here the animals were overcooked mushy and the garlic butter was strange. and it took 30mn to come.
another 30mn after removing the snails came the steak and the duck. I had ordered my cooking rare: rare it certainly was, trending raw which is luckily not really a problem with me - and the duck meat was good. but it was just so damn cold, so much so that the butter on it was not melting. my friend's tenderloin was also cold... considering the fries were hot, i guess comes from the meat being cooked and hitting a bottleneck on the fries. But we got two wasted dishes 1h30 after ordering.
wine list is OK, a bit expensive. the 2006 Chateauneuf was very good for me but the bottle was maderized. it was interesting to see my friend proofing the wine, not looking super excited, and the waiter just pouring saying ""I am sure it is perfect"". i had a good wine because i like the maderized taste which is not normally appreciated by wine connoisseurs. my friend was not enthralled."
Not bad. Steak a bit over cooked.,"Food and service were good. Steak was a bit overcooked despite ordering on the rare side. Nice onion soup, salad, and fries."
Nice place,"Service was good and attentive, food was nice and the prices were reasonable. Will visit again thank you"
Brunch,This gem of place is located in Robertson Key and close to Solomon porch- my church. The food is delicious and friendly service - recommending you visiting this spot
Good steak and ambience,"Nice ambience, good steak and friendly staff ! Would definitely come again! (Oh and free flow fries)"
Lovely chill lunch place!,"Service was friendly, polite and attentive. The food was great and excellent value for money if you get the set lunch! Will be back."
Great steaks great value!!!,Lovely little French steak place at Robertson Quay. Alfresco dining with attentive service. Go for the small Ribeye and Entrecôte and you won’t go wrong….did I forget to mention the free flow of french fries & salad?
Ryan’s Dinner,"We are here for our friend’s birthday and the ambience was great! Service was polite and quick, food was good. Would come again."
Trust broken,The steaks were great but we had a poor experience - we waited a long time for our meal and when it arrived we were told we had 15 mins to finish our wine ( a magnum of wine ) by 10.15. We informed them that the government regulations say we had to finished by 10.30. They said they had a curfew of 10.15 due to a prior infringement they had received. They should have Informed us of this and especially as the food took an hour to arrive. There was no apology and poor service.
"Awesome dining experience, wonderful service staff!","The overall dining experience was awesome, only irritated initially by loud talking diners at the next table. Celebrated my mother’s birthday and the restaurant gave my mother a surprise dessert for her birthday. Exceptional service by Selina that evening. She was knowledgeable about both the food and wines. Recommended us portions of food that was just right. Great job! The meat was awesome, cooked well and right doneness. Will recommend anyone who wants a good piece of steak to visit this place."
Will be back!,Had biz lunch. Enjoyed the food and ambience. Service was good. We had the ribeye steaks and lamb with a bottle of red. Nice and will be back.
Great Experience,"What a pleasant restaurant! Great food, nice ambience and amazing customer service. I brought my mum there for a birthday dinner but we didn't have time to stay for dessert (and give the staff a chance to bring out her birthday dessert). I wanted to let it go, but to my pleasant surprise, the manager came up to us with desserts packed specially for my mum and wished her a happy birthday. It was very nice of her to do that and I really appreciated it!"
Amazing Value,"We shared the 500g steak. It is a great deal. Admittedly not the most flavourful meat I've ever had but it was cooked to perfection (as in, on the rare side of medium rare) and along with the sides it was a sumptuous meal. The only disappointment was the creamed spinach which was over salted. This place is definitely one to keep on the short-list for steak places."
Waiter was really friendly but food needs improvement,"The entrees were okay but the steaks were bad. My partner barely finished half his steak. For my steak I ordered a medium one but it look like it’s cooked medium rare. Parts of the steak was also totally raw and inedible. The bill for 2 (without any wine) ends up being $170+. I can’t say it’s really worth the price. I don’t know if it’s because it’s new year eve and there were a lot of people, but I don’t think I will be returning again."
Bad Service lousy steak,"My friends and I have arranged a christmas lunch together on boxing day as we heard good review from our peers. However the experience was terrible that we will not be going back neither will consider their other branches anymore. Firstly we ordered 4 of their signature steak- 3 medium and 1 medium rare plus a portion of escargot.
Firstly the person who took order from us did not write down the orders and when he repeat the order instead of 3M 1MR its 3MR and 1M i have to correct him again.
Secondly he did not mentioned he has ordered for us 2 portion of escargot we only realized it when they serve it to our table but its fine.
Thirdly, after waiting for 30mins or so the steak that was serve to us were medium well to well done. We have request to make the changes to the steaks for all while munching on the fries to wait for another 15-20mins.
Upon serving the new batch of steaks the supervisor asked us to cut half to check the doneness which we told him its fine we will just eat it as we do not want to wait any longer but he was indirectly ""forcing"" us to cut infront of him which we did.
the meat that was served to us was no better as well too tough and chewy and alot of fats that my hand cramp from cutting the meat.
To be honest even aston steak taste better.

Will i be going back to them? No
Will i introduce to my peers? No"
Tasty steak but not much more,"The booking of 5 was set at a small table of 4. Not much room. The starters were not really up to much and that the cold cut starter getting forgotten was not the best start. 5 pax and all ordered steak. it was 2 med rare and 3 medium well. We got 4 medium rare - the weird thing was that there were 2 cuts of steak - 3 ordered one and all wanted medium well - should have been simple. They provided dessert of 2 creme brulee and 1 choc cake - however, in covid times sharing is VERY tough. I think the restaurant is over rated but the steak was very tasty."
Good steak,"service good.
Ambience not bad.
Chicken liver mouse was a fairly large portion but delicious. French onion soup was oookay.
Truffle sausages were average. Fries were disappointing.
Creme caramel was average.
STEAK WAS GOOD! Creme brûlée was good, and came with a hint of citrus! yum!

Overall worth going for their set lunches!"
"Nice restaurant, but slow","I made a reservation at this restaurant for my parents' wedding anniversary. The food was good, but the service was very slow. We ordered their 3-course lunch for reference.

There were long delays between each course, and this was disappointing. Furthermore, we asked for cold water and they poured some premium water from Evian which ended up in over $10 per bottle. We were not informed and since we were already running late for our next appointment, we could not really dispute it. I am unsure if there were any cheaper options available, but this was not made known to us during our meal. We always asked if the next course could be served soon but we were simply told to wait.

The atmosphere was quite casual and the food was good, so it is not all bad. However, the service was slow and it was quite disappointing. The overall experience was a little bit ruined by the slow service, and my parents were not happy due to the delays."
"Strand of hair not once but twice,ewww!","A black strand of hair found on our steak.
Decided to keep mum about it.
As we were ending it, another strand of hair found in the creme brûlée.
‘Goodness’!!
Truth be told, decided to inform the floor in charge.
He was apologetic.
We were offered cocktails to appease our experience but turn down the offer.
Do look into the hygiene factor or else there’ll be lots of complication."
Poor Service and food,"When we visited on a Wednesday afternoon, restaurant was not crowded. Service was slow, food took a long time to arrive. Had to prompt them for our bread. We ordered 3 rib eye steaks, escargot, carafe of wine. Everything was over priced and nothing to shout about. I will go back to my favourite, Bistro Du Vin at Shaws which is at a similar price point."
Dinner with hubby,"We had ribeye steak and jumbo prawns. Overall, good quality food and wine too. The service staff were also friendly and helpful."
Still Fantastic,If you just want a good steak/chips and a reasonably priced bottle of good red - this is the place. Been going here for years and it never disappoints - enjoy!
Nice setup to eat a good steak and share good times with friends,"We enjoyed our steaks, free flow fries and good wine. The service was good and staff very warm. Nice setup for a good time with friends."
"Food was meh, ambience and service wasn’t good","Steak was very chewy and not enjoyable… Creme brûlée was better.

I had booked indoor seats initially, but when we arrived we thought the indoor seats were very close to one another (safe distancing is not there) and not private, so we requested for seats outdoor since they were empty. Waiter said no as they were reserved, but throughmy dinner of 2 hours there, there were empty tables the whole time.

Mentioned that the reservation was to celebrate my boyfriend’s birthday, waiter called me up to confirm my reservation and noted this (thought the service was good at this point). However, on the day itself there was no mention of wishing him a happy birthday, no complimentary dessert either.

Waiter was super prompt in refilling my water, even when it’s almost full…

It was quite meh for the price we were paying. Will probably not revisit."
Great steak and service!,"Steak is nicely done, nice relaxing atmosphere and great service! Highly recommended! Will definitely come again next time."
"Great Steak, Nice Ambience, Good Service",Fries & Steaks were awesome here as well service is great too! Will recommend to order the terrine and the sharing steak which is good and value for money.
Chill bistro vibe,This is perfect place for any kind of dinner. We love coming here when we want a chill bistro vibe. The food is classic. Highly recommended
Great tasting steak and good service!,"Firstly, the location is amazing! But the steak was so good, and perfectly cooked to the requested doneness. At the same time, the fries and salad were a great combination as sides. The service was prompt and we really enjoyed our dinner!"
Dinner,Nice cosy dinner place to have friend gather. Service is good nice ambience. Would definitely come back again
Great place for good steak - Les Bouchon!,Great place for good steak to suit all occasions. Varied cuts to suit your palate. Courteous and helpful service. Would highly recommend Les Bouchon at Robertson Quay!
Steak Frites,"Best steak frites. The “set” comes with a salad and free-flow fries.
The steak is tender and cooked perfectly. The frites are some of the best you’ll find in Singapore – crispy. The salad is small but tasty and nutty. Bread served on the side, as is a selection of mustards and home-made mayonnaise.

We found the service on Sunday lunch better than weekday evenings. Timothy and Denzel(?) were good, but the whole team is attentive and helpful.

There is a reasonable selection of wines."
Awesome food and great service!,Awesome food and great service! The steak is very well marinated and tender! Highly recommended 😍🤤
Simply the best steak n fries,"Probably the best Steak n Fries in Singapore (and likely the region). And good value!!! Very friendly and professional team, even on busy nights. It was not the first time, and definitely not the last time!"
Food review,Good food (Steak) and service. Best steak eaten! The salmon was cooked very well. Very good ambience and setting
Good French restaurant,Escargot and steak were great. Great service too! The creme brûlée wasn’t too sweet and I’d definitely come back again!
Authentic French restaurant,"Authentic French restaurant, the steaks are delicious and perfectly cooked, and the free flow fries are homemade and tasty."
Great steak tartare Best,Great steak tartare Best in town And fries are home made! Couscous is also great Recommend it strongly
Excellent bouchon,Meat was amazing and service extremely kind! We come from France and for once we finally found something of equal quality
"Great, as usual!","Les Bouchons is a safe choice with great food and excellent service. Was never disappointed, in more than 10 years visiting this place"
Fantastic!,Great and prompt service! Fantastic food as always. It's always great returning to Les Bouchons for a good steak.
"Lovely food, lovely ambience","Lovely food, lovely ambience, lovely wine. I especially love the steak and the fries - it’s really delicious."
Good food,Super great food with excellent service! 10000/10 would come back! Ordered the steak and it came with freeflow fries!!
Excellent beef,Had rib eye for dinner and its good as usual! Definitely recommend to this restaurant! Its my third visit to this place
Reliable and consistent steaks for more than 10 years,Had lunch at Les Bouchons with a friend. Great steak frites as usual with a nice bottle of red. Been coming here for more than 10 years.
Lunch,"Very good wine selection, steak was very nice, nice setting and great serving staff. Free flow of french fried"
"Great food, great place, great service",Les Bouchons is the place to be for all celebrations and occasions. We had the black angus and impossible steak. Fantastic meat and service. Highly recommended.
Food good - but don't expect it to be a relaxed evening,"So the food is good BUT they give you your salad - then 3 minutes later they come over with your steak. they do it to EVERYBODY. which other restaurant gives you 3 minutes to eat a starter? I get they are trying to turn the tables - but it RUINS the experience. We are not stupid - so please stop this. It costs you 5-10 minutes, or you lose customers like me. One other thing the extra fries take ages - 10 minutes I reckon to come out - why is that?
With the rush factor we are not going back - makes it feel like McDs"
"good steak, and kid friendly","We came here for steak and wine as couples date , however our four year old joined us. Would like to commend the head waiter Mr Kumaran for his great help to not only include an addition seat for our son, and also provide him with helping of fries for our kid. He also provided plates and cutlery for our kid which is essentially adults date. Quote unexpected kid friendly . Will return for more"
What a disaster as compared to first visit.,"My second visit to this outlet and it was a definite disappointment this time.

We ordered the Le Grant Partage and this was definitely not our thing. The Black Angus Rib Eye and Angus Sirloin was cooked unevenly (some pieces were WELL DONE while others were Medium Rare). The whole platter was barely warm when served (I’m thinking it’s cause they needed time to put the different parts together that caused the heat dissipation). Lamb Skewer and Angus Beef Filet Skewer were the saving grace of the whole dish, albeit the fact that it’s cold and hard when eaten. DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE PRICE AND DO NOT RECOMMEND ORDERING.

Also, were there something wrong with the fries? They were fairly short ends as compared to the ones on my first visit.

Seating was a horrifying experience as well. We were placed at Table 1, nearest to the wine bottle shelves. And I’m strongly advising everyone to avoid being seated at that table. Throughout the meal, we were disturbed so many times by the host whenever someone ordered wine. He comes so near to us and our food, I’m nothing but grossed out cause really, please avoid THAT much contact. And sensibly, a table should never be placed THAT close to the wine shelves.

Really, what a ruin to a great birthday evening."
Great steak at affordable price,"Came here for an anniversary celebration. Outdoor seat is romantic but felt uneasy as it’s way too close to the other diners. Shifted indoor instead. Could have been better if there’s special surprise (small cake etc) as requested in booking app. This is what differentiate great service and elevate the experience for me for the restaurants I visit. But none the less great steak with 4 sauces to choose from, love the bread (came warm but no bread spreader) more than the salad and fries (didn’t manage to ask for second serving although free flow - too full!) Nice wine of the day too. Overall experience is not too stressful as it’s not too “fine-dining”. Would recommend to try."
"Smoky, well charred, juicy steak","First time trying this place on the 1st day of CNY since I can’t visit my family in JB. Ordered the bone marrow, French onion soup , Super Entrecôte and Vanilla ice cream with brandied cherries.

Pros:
Bone Marrow - Fatty & rich. Add a bit of salt to bring out the flavour.. for people who love eating fat

Onion soup- very good version. Wasn’t too cheesy and overpowering. Well balanced and comforting

Steak - My wife Ordered medium but it was served medium rare which is my personal preference. My wife really liked it in the end. Told her it was extra juicy cos it’s medium rare. Really well charred and has good smoky flavour. Add a little bit of salt for more beefy flavour.

Vanilla ice cream with brandied cherries - Could really tasty the brandy which pairs really well with the sweetness of the ice cream and slight tartness of the cherries.

Hope they consider having happy hour for the house wine & draft beer. Also have an option to order steak & au jus or red wine with onion & mushroom reduction sauce to pair with the delicious steak. Will definitely visit again"
Great food and service,"Service was good and attentive. We had escargot and the bone marrow for starter. The bone marrow was really good! I highly recommend the spicy beef tartare for main. It was delicious, especially coming from someone who is not into meats. My husband had the Super Entrecote which was flavourful and done medium rare just like how he likes it. Had a really memorable meal!"
Totally enjoyable evening!,"Totally enjoyable evening!

The ribeye & duck were so lovely. Better still, with the free-flow fries which was crispy & tasty, made the whole dinner so fun & satisfying.

Also do try out their brandied cherries with ice cream. It was our first try and we were blown away! (Slight exaggerated but you know what I mean)"
Les bouchons fantastic dining place,"Awesome steaks and Fries! Definitely a great place to spend our evening! Great service from the manager Mr Zet his patience, customer service and recommendations is impressive! His fellow team also did a very good Job! We had a fantastic dinner at Les Bouchons. Thank you"
Good food,"great food, ambience & service. Zet was very friendly & gave us many good recommendations. + points for the free flow fries, will be back soon!"
Excellent service and food,"I wanted to commend the staff and managers on their friendly, happy and attentive service. The steak was great and well priced and the free flow fries are the best around. We will be back soon."
Solid food!,The mains and deserts were delicious! service standards were great especially when we had 1 large portion of the steak cooked to different done-ness. Will come again!
Not organized service & Double standard,"Basically - food is good, chefs are nice people (saw them smiling to customers when they are around the dinning space)

Service, i cannot accept and will not return this outlet anymore.
I called to make a reservation and told them i wanted a indoor seat.

Day of arrival, they put me outdoor which i said NO as i already inform that i wanted a indoor seat. The manager replied “i will check” after checking he said “no record of notes”
Seriously? To me is like youre saying im lying in my face.
Oh well. So i told him again i wanted a indoor seat, then we finally said “ok,” and assigned me one.

Main point, my 2 seating table is super small and i had my bag and 2 paper bag with me.
So i asked for an extra chair for my bag and stuff. (I dont think im asking for too much)?

And the waitress told me, sorry they cannot afford to give me one as they have not enough chair (something along this line)

Okay, i understand and im fine with it i put everything on the floor beside my chair..

15mins before i ended my meal.....

Ohhh WOW. I saw that another 2 seater consumer, they lady asking for a chair and there she goes... she got the CHAIR immediately without having hesitated by the waiter.
I witnessed the whole incident myself.

To me, this is double standard? (I thot they dont have enough chair? But i saw that waiter just simply get another chair from another empty table)

Let me tell you, i felt uneasy and disgusted and i just ask for the waitess and said : “not too sure why she can have a chair for a bag but not me”

Ohhhh all the huuu haaa talking behind and discussing with her manager and co worker?

I finally gotten the chair but BYE im leaving the restaurant in less than 10mins.

Never coming back.
If i am, i will hold my chanel bag in."
Excellent steak,We had an excellent family steak dinner at Le Bouchons. The food was great. The service was also generally good. We also liked the fact that they allowed us to bring our own bottle of wine for a corkage charge (which is a little hefty). I highly recommend the place.
Good food,"Great place to chill or business lunch. They have excellent view, food and service. Highly recommended"
Good food,Great steak and amazingly crispy fries. Nice view of the river. Definitely recommended and will come again
Good Steak!,Service was top notch and food was very delicious! Would highly recommend for anyone keen to have good steak at reasonable prices.
Excellent food and service,The steak here is literally to die for and they brought my friend a free dessert! Highly recommended
Casual Dining by the River,"Good vibe, proactive service, good food. Everything is great although the onion soup was a little too peppery for my personal liking. Super fries and value for money steak."
Sharing platter,"We had a very good time at les Bouchons. The sharing platter was very rich and good. We had a table outside, good atmosphere. The service of waiter Hafiz was superb."
We’ve been here a few time,We’ve been here a few time for business dinner. Great restaurant with casual atmosphere. Food and wine list consistently good. Will be back.
Dinner at Les Bouchons,"Tried the rib-eye steak in medium rare and it was very good! Came with salad and bread which was great as an appetiser or post-steak snack and fries were free-flow as well! Overall, great experience :-)"
Awesome food & Service,Great food with outstanding service! Every dish was prepared to perfection and the staff were extremely attentive to all details and customer requirements.
Good first experience!,Waiter was very attentive and gave good recommendations on what to get. The beef fillet was very tender and was just the right amount of doneness. Will visit again!
Dinner on an evening,"Great food, amazing scenery. Will definitely return. My family love the sharing platter and the bone marrow. I had the salmon and the fries serving is generous."
Amazing meal. Loved the steak,"Amazing meal. Loved the steak tartare. Great ambience and service from the staff, especially Hafiz. We will return"
Value-for-money steak in Singapore,"One of the best value-for-money steaks in Singapore, hands down. And a great location for people-watching too. Great food, great service, good location and reasonable price. What’s not to like?!"
Excellent meal and great service,Went for steak and beef marrow here. Food was great and ambience was great also. Staff was helpful and friendly. Love the different sauces accompanying the sreak.
Great service & value for money food!,"The service was impeccable - the manager made good recommendations and the staffs were attentive to our requests.

The food was great as well - the steak was cooked medium rare as requested and very much to our liking. The free flow fries were so goooooooood."
Saturday Night,The service was excellent. the managers are hospitable and friendly. Hafiz esp did a great job! Got a complimentary creme brulee for my birthday!
Great steak,"Lovely steak and wine, in a great position along the river. Excellent service from Hafiz and the team!"
Fantastic service. Food was,Fantastic service. Food was fantastic. Highly recommended!! Angus prime rib is a must have. French onion soup is great to have during cold weather.
"Nice food, big portions and very friendly service","We ordered a 2pax set, tender and juicy beef, delicious sausage, mutton skew and a very special beef bone marrow which I never tried before. Quite big portions enough for 3 person I think :) Mr Zet and Hafiz provided a very friendly Service! Will visit again:D
食物非常好吃，特别是牛肉和香肠。牛骨髓非常特别，其他地方都没有看到过。食物的量也很足够，3个人吃应该没有问题。Mr Zet和Mr Hafiz的服务也非常友善。推荐！"
"Overall, it was a good experience.","Booked Les Bouchns at Robertson Quay via the Chope app, instead of the usual Ann Siang branch, for a change and was a little disappointed.

One of the staff called 2 day prior to ask if they could bump up our reservation from 6:45pm to 6-6:30pm because he wanted to turn the table over at 8pm. When I called back to confirm that we could do dinner at an earlier time, the same staff asked me what was the issue (nicely) and it was clear that he could not remember our conversation. So I had to repeat what happened, to which he clarified that it's either 6pm OR 6:30pm. He was not clear when he called so it was really quite frustrating.

Food was good, service was somewhat lacking - we had to turn around to find someone who would notice us and ask for bread and butter when the escargots came without them, the fries were also way too salty and they took a while to replace it. We were almost done with our steaks when the fresh basket of fries arrived (this time with no salt), we couldn't resist and ate quite a bit. Ten minutes before 8pm, the manager came to remind us that there was another reservation at 8pm. So we quickly finished up our food and conversation, paid and left.

To be honest, 1.5 hours was a little too tight for us - we had to order quickly, wait for the food, chase for the bread and also waited for the fries, I also keep checking my watch while we were chatting to make sure we don't overstay our welcome."
Disappointment Instead of Great Experience As In the Past,"Reservation Experience - On Saturday past at about 10 am I requested a reservation for 2 at Les Bouchons, Robertson Quay, for 7:30 pm, using the Google/Chope App. I received an email almost immediately indicating that the reservation was confirmed. Shortly after 3 pm I received a telephone call from the restaurant advising me there was no table available at 7:30 pm. I replied that I already had a confirmed reservation for 7:30, a table for 2, via the Google/Chope online app. He insisted that the reservation was not valid, there was no table available and it would take about an hour wait for a table at that time. I opted for a table at 6 pm, one of two times available. There is a huge disconnect between the reservation app and the restaurant itself. It took five hours for the restaurant to advise there was no table when the app indicated there was plenty of seating. This is unacceptable and inappropriate. Frankly, I felt trapped, I was depending on the commitment made by the restaurant via its reservation app.

Table Site Experience - We were seated promptly at six pm and noticed a strong unpleasant odour coming from a manhole cover not one-half meter away.

Unpublished Second Seating Philosophy - As indicated above, we were seated at 6 pm and at about 8:15 pm a staff member quietly and politely advised me the restaurant required our table in about 15 minutes. We were on our second bottle of wine, contemplating a third bottle, and still leisurely enjoying some food. I asked whether it was published on their website or anywhere for that matter that there was a time limit to seating, he replied no there was not any such indication published. I then asked him whether he advised us when we were being seated that there was a time limit on the table, he replied that he had not given any notice about that topic. To be fair, we were offered another table to which I declined. I have no intention of being shuffled about a restaurant in the middle of a dining experience, that is not a proper restaurant/dining convention.

The table service was very good, they did a great job.

My suggestion to the restaurant and any other food establishment is that their reservation system is in proper order as well as administered properly. Also, the establishment maintain full transparency in advance regarding any company policy that could affect clientele."
An intriguing restaurant,"First time alfresco dining with our teenage kids to celebrate a birthday...what a great experience after Circuit Breaker! Nice setting, steak with red wine and great company. Service is good too! The exquisite taste transcended me to another realm."
Dinner,Value for money steak and fries. Hearty portions. Cosy family restaurant setting and Great service from Hafiz :)
Great family dinner,"Visited Les Bouchons for an early dinner, my Mom loved the beef tartare and cream spinach. Escargots are especially good and authentic! Service is exemplary, we’ll be back!"
"Great couscous, great meat!","Great couscous, one of the best in Singapore - only on Fridays and Saturdays! Their steaks and meat platters are also very nice, juicy and very good. Need to book in advance to avoid disappointment as the seats are limited..."
Black Angus Rib Eye,"We ordered the beef bone marrow with toast. It was oily - I suspect too much butter.
We ordered the black angus prime and asked for it to be cooked medium. The cut was tender. I did not like the fries at all as I found them oily.

The waiters were attentive and helpful - thank you.

Overall, an average experience."
Anniversary Dinner,I had a wonderful time and meal at this restaurant. The service by Hafiz and his team was exceptional. They took note of my request for a nice table on my wedding anniversary and was kind enough to provide complimentary Champagne/sparkling wine. We had the Cote de Boeuf which was nicely done. The black pepper sauce was a nice option. Absolutely delicious. Look at the photo!
Nice restaurant,The steak is ok - not fantastic but not bad. The fries and the bread are super - it is delicious. Can finish all.
Lovely evening,Thank you Hafiz and Karan for recommending the beef and wine! We truly enjoyed the warm welcome and attentive hospitality this evening. Will come back again!
Good steak at RQ,Loved the food and the service at les Bouchons. Recommend for people in the area. Great value for money.
Our favourite steak place,My hubs and my favourite steak restaurant before and after we had kids! The standard has never dropped over the years. Loving the service by the crew and Karan!
Great Steak,"Great steak, chips and wine. Very good value. Excellent food and service. Will definitely be back again."
Best steak in Singapore!,Best steak in Singapore! Fabulous service from Mark who catered for dietary needs. Would definitely recommend. Booking essential. Can’t wait to go back.
Great food with service,Lovely place. Great value for money. Received good help in ordering and wine pairing. Enjoyable night out with friends.
Good unpretentious food,Nice steaks and duck fat fries! Located just along the Singapore River which is a lovely walk at night
