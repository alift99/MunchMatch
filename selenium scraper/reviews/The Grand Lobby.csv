Love it!,"Had afternoon tea here and loved it. Very relaxed, not rushed with great service led by Gibson. He was great and took time out of his busy schedule to talk to us. Loved the afternoon tea - we will return."
"Glorious High Tea Food, Service and Experience.","High Tea is traditionally served in the Grand Lobby. It is simply divine. The food, service and environment are wonderful; we even had a live Harpist accompanying our afternoon tea; just sublime. The 4 stars (not 5) was simply the large price tag - S$80pp for high tea and Singapore Slings (which were developed first here at the hotel) are an extra S$37. It is well worth doing, as a very special treat. Last hint: book well in advance (online) as it is extremely popular."
Very disappointed,"We visited for the festive afternoon tea on Christmas eve. The food and service were not at all up to the usual Raffles standard. This is incredibly disappointing given that the festive menu is more expensive. Granted, I have not visited the Raffles since pandemic restrictions were lifted - maybe the service was better during the pandemic? Our friends had arrived before us, we sat down to join them and waited at least ten minutes before we were offered water. Service was slow to take our order. I ordered the same tea as my friend - we only got one pot between us, and no one ever came to give us refills. Yes, it is possible to flag down a waiter to request a refill, but waiters were few and far between. My husband has to ask twice to get a second cup of coffee. Usually, the Raffles staff are attentive and would ask us for refills. I do not expect to be flagging down waiters and asking twice at this establishment. The food was fine, but nothing notable - again a disappointment. Not worth the premium prices. It seems as though the Raffles lobby is, as is the long bar, just a tourist trap. There are places in town with better food and service."
PLEASE BOOK THIS,"Wow,just amazing,the quality, choice,service,ambience,everything about the raffles is excellent,we just had afternoon tea,I have had afternoon tea in many places around the world and the raffles stands out ,without any doubt,the best.
I just want to address some of the concerns from other reviews for the benefit of readers who have not been and are considering it,first of all ,the cost,yes it’s expensive at $98 and from $30 per glass if you would like champagne,worth every cent,if you don’t want to pay that,don’t go.
Somebody was complaining about having to queue up to pay like any other cafe or restaurant just not true,you could do that,but the waiter will bring your bill to you if you ask,and they will follow up with an eftpos machine if necessary .
As I said before,without any doubt,the best afternoon tea you could have,enjoy."
Do NOT waste your money,"Style over substance. A waste of 200 dollars. Too many sweet options, not enough savoury, not balanced at all.
I would say it is extremely poor quality for the price, especially for a vegetarian!"
Afternoon tea : over hyped...overpriced,"What a disappoint!

1. Location / venue : stunning

2. Service: ordinary. We've just spent 6 weeks on a road trip in Australia and in the big cities stayed at Hiltons. The service was outstanding esp Hilton Sydney. Here we were served by kids ( ave age 18/20) who were indifferent/ distant/ robotic.

3. Food :
A. Quality : v good
B. Portions : small, and unlike The Ritz in London and The Mandarin Oriental (Bangok) stingy Raffles do not replenish tiny portion of sandwiches.

4. Value for money : 1 out 5.
You don't FEEL you've had a brilliant experience

Overall:

AVOID, unless you've got money to burn and/ or an Instagram audience to satisfy"
Nice ambience with decent food,"The heritage evening menu was delightful! Nostalgic selection of local delights like the Singapore Chili crab cake, laska, hainanese chicken rice, ondeh ondeh, kaya pineapple Swiss roll. Portion was decent. $68++/pax with your choice of tea. I had their signature tea which was the Singapore sling tea. Lovely fruity notes (could taste the pineapple) and the brew of a nice pink hue.

Plus point - the savory food (plus the coconut bird nest’s tart) served were hot. Spring roll was fried ala-minute and was still crispy when eaten.

It would have been great if they could serve individual portion, as my dining party was 3 pax, therefore the items were served 1 pc + 2 pcs and 2 sets of condiments and sauces were served for 3 pax hence was quite hard to share on the table.

Staff was attentive. The grand lobby wasn’t too packed however as there was a private event with a band, parts of the evening the private group was rowdy despite staff asking them to tone down. That kind of spoilt the grand lobby ambience."
For a perfect afternoon tea…,"…come here. It’s the best afternoon tea experience I’ve had in the most perfect location imaginable. I actually went for the (seasonal/monthly?) special ‘Peruvian’ menu and it was superb. The staff were really accommodating of us, including our occasionally screaming baby, and the setting is obviously just amazing. See if you can go for a wander round the grounds afterwards eating here too, the rest of the hotel is just as striking as well."
Best place for afternoon tea!!!,Everyone in Singapore has afternoon tea and this is the best place for it!!! The food is good...they have many different kinds of tea.
Raffles,"The evening taster dinner was excellent. 6.30 to 9 was fine, not the set and limited time stated on 'Chope'. Also it's buy your own alcohol."
Afternoon tea,"A beautiful setting, a harpest playing, outstanding service and the most wonderful selection of sandwiches, cakes, scones and teas."
The ultimate afternoon tea experience,The price is eye watering for afternoon tea with a optional champagne but every item on served was truly delicious.
High Tea but the High was only in the price,"Imagine enjoying high tea of exquisite delicacies in the buzz of a large, beautiful room beneath the lemon glow of chandeliers. Unfortunately, such was not my experience at the Raffles Hotel.

From where we were seated, the corner of the Grand Lobby looked small, unlovely and empty. Perhaps they had closed off the main part of the Lobby due to a lack of business. Far from there being any old world charm, we were required to scan a QR code to bring up the beverages menu. Does this place really need to save money by dispensing with printed menu? There was enough food but nothing very special. The petite sandwiches has too little filling and some of the cakes were too sweet. And don't expect them to graciously bring you the bill on a silver platter because you have to front up to the cashier as per normal in any common Singapore restaurant.

All these might be fine if it didn't cost so much. Maybe money is like water to you so it's just an afternoon's humdrum refreshment but if you are the type giving yourself and significant others a supposedly rare treat, you might emerge wondering why there was so little of the glamour that you expected."
Disappointing at a stinging price,"Having been to High Tea at renovation Raffles I was excited to take 3 newbies for the experience. I noted the price was much higher for what appeared less and I was 110% correct. The setting is still beautiful, the service immaculate, the napery and table accoutrements the highest quality which makes for pleasant and relaxed surroundings.
The food and value for money are the issue. Firstly, the sweets. In one way these were immaculate, but on reflection just too cloyingly sweet. I have never seen scones so tiny at afternoon tea and the sandwiches were miniscule. The filling:bread ratio in the sandwiches was just not right and I am still unsure whether I ate tuna or chicken. The tea was Mariage Frères and therefore divine. The big sting, the eye-watering price!! It is just not value for money. The consoling thought was at least my friends can say they had High Tea at Raffles before they died. My advice, go to a posh hotel elsewhere."
Disappointed - not what it used to be,"After a long COVID induced hiatus I was excited to return to the Grand Lobby of the world renowned Raffles Hotel for its famous high tea. Having been thrice before, I was very much looking forward to this return since my parents were in town and had never experienced this luxury affair.

But alas, a luxury affair it is no more. The wait staff is sparse and difficult to get a hold of. The cups of water we were delivered were warm and one had a lipstick stain on it. The tea arrived way after the food, and the champagne even later. The scones were cold and stale, and they no longer offer an additional pastry at the end.

The ambience remains grand and stunning, but the repertoire of the harpist rather dull.

While I am disappointed that I will not be returning, I am comforted by the fact that there are many wonderful and more affordable high teas on the island to delight our out of town guests."
Splendid Time,"My family and I enjoyed a wonderful afternoon tea at the The Grand Lobby, Raffles.
The service and food were excellent. We felt like royalty for a few hours!
We went for a walk around the grounds later and felt like we were in a movie.
Such a great experience if you can visit and experience. Would highly recommend."
still as beautiful as ever.,The new chandelier is magnificent and worth visiting the lobby just to see it. Not as many real flowers as in years gone by however I think is a temporary measure
High tea at the Raffles hotel Singapore,"Went for high tea with my daughter on Dec 27th at Raffles hotel. I was a bit disappointed by the service, we had to wait over 10 minutes to get a glass of water, asked 3 different waiters, so I removed my mask to accelerate the process. Why can't they bring a glass of water as we seat down so we can remove the mask? But worse was the quality of the pastries. From a scale from 1 to 5 I gave it 1. Having so much cinnamon is not to everyone taste either and you could ask if people mind cinnamon. Honestly any French bakery makes better cakes than what we had. I was glad to meet other French who were very disappointed as well. So it is not just us!"
Impeccable experience,"I went there with my wife to celebrate San Valentine and her Birthday that for my luck happen to be the same day , we enjoyed one of the best Afternoon tea and we had a memorable experience.
Both the quality of the food and the service was outstanding and tremendously impeccable, everything curated to the single detail, it was for us really un uplifting moment.
Great job everyone, keep it up and thank you for everything.
A big and special thanks goes to Mr. Syed at the Consierge that make our day even more special he spend some time with us and explained the story of that magical place answering all my wife question.
Thank you so much again and we will be certainly back soon."
Try it at least once in a life time!,"This is indeed one of the grandest high tea experience I had. Not only is the food tasty but the ambience is classy and the environment is very welcoming and warm. Although it can be quite pricey, one should still try it at least once. I will return if there is a promotion for it!"
"Excellent settings, amazing service, delicious food.","Really amazing experience, for the price, an excellent value. Perhaps improvement can be offer refill without being asked, and make the food not be delicious but also look delicious..they were not giving the impression of being refined sandwiches or cakes despite tasting super good."
Nice place for a Singapore Sling!,"I redeemed a Singapore Sling as part of my stay and it was sublime sitting in a classy colonial fancy lobby while sipping on a 'free' drink. The nuts, olives, and chips served with it were delicious too!"
Afternoon tea with a friend,"Afternoon tea with a friend whom I have not seen for a very long time. It was worth it! Service and food were great!

Thanks to Emelyne who assisted us for the reservation, her attention to detail was amazing, she even asked if we have dietary restrictions prior to the booked date. Thanks to the 2 service staff (sorry, didn’t get the chance to get their names) as well who took care of us from start to finish. Overall experience was great!"
Excellent experience,We had high tea the the lobby of Raffles Hotel. The service was excellent and the experience was fantastic. The attention to detail was great. And so was the attention given to us. Only negative comment I can share was a small insect buzzing around near our food but that was only for a few minutes. We highly recommend the high tea for special occasions.
Great ambiance and decent food,"We went to try the afternoon high tea to relive the experience from our first visit to Singapore decades back. Great ambiance, good spread and decent service. The quality of tea and coffee was great The servings are large enough for our family. In the earlier avatar, this used to happen in the tiffin room, which had a victorian feel to it. The current version in the Grand Lobby is a more 'how do we monetise a legendary product'. Surprisingly, for $ 97 before tax ($ 88 +10% service charge), coffee refills are restricted to 1.
While the overall experience is good, the price vs value experience is a mismatch. Good for a one time go to tick it off the bucket list"
Worst High Tea experience among all 5/6 stars Hotels,"Reservation:
Right from reservations, the team changed my reservation timing despite me declining to change. I was only aware of the change through email less than 24hrs to my reservation timing. Non apologetic attitude despite their mistake and they attempted to brush the whole mistake without making any effort to root cause analysis to prevent future happenings. I had to make do with wrong timing due to less ideal seating if they were to ""squeeze"" me in an earlier slot. However, upon arrival the seating was not a better one. Neither was it private nor corner as described by team.

Food quality:
Not value for money I totally agree with many others who mentioned as well.

Service:
Initially it was difficult to get the attention of service staff. Which is a common issue if they were busy. However, the situation spiralled downhill when again non apologetic attitude when I pointed out a fly spotted in the cream for scones. A mere change of cream serving was made. The worst event came about when a reminder was given to us that they need the table back. I expected the reminder, but the feeling of being discriminated seeped in when we noticed we're the only table given reminder when other tables were seated before us. Even after we paid and left, we passed by the lobby about 15 minutes later and noticed there was no diners at our table and no change to diners surrounding us. Thus, we concluded the service team indeed discriminated us and unfair service was rendered"
"Not so iconic after all, crappy service","I would like to share my disappointing experience having high tea at the hotel lobby today. The experience was lacklustre especially the hospitality by your serving team. We waited around for a while no one attended to us, not even give us a menu and i was seated right next to the counter where the waitress was. I had to walk up to the waitress carrying my infant to ask if we can get a menu and what's part of the high tea menu. I wanted to order from the A La Carte menu and asked for recommendation. The recommendation was Dim Sum and Ham sandwiches, not even a proper recommendation of your signature items. I clarified with the waitress do we get sandwiches on the high tea set as i wanted something different and she replied brusquely nothing on the la carte menu is on the high tea menu but the high tea set came with sandwiches. i ended with more sandwiches than needed. After the meal, we wanted to take a picture in front of the Xmas tree. The male waiter who walked past refuse to help and said he is busy, while heading to the counter to process a bill. It takes 2 secs to take a picture and he can't even stop to take a picture. We went to a lady waitress, she replied she need to clear the table first, she is busy. The hotel serving staff has zero customer first mentality, how can they be too busy to serve? I have received warmer hospitality at a hawker centre or even a lower rated hotel. The only people who care and made us feel welcome are the concierge team at the entrance!"
High Tea,"The food is not value for money at all. For $207 for 2 pax, it is extremely costly for high tea with just finger food. The price is essentially to pay for the ambience and service. It will just be for a one-time experience."
Service & ambience,"The service staff were attentive and really well dressed. Ambience was great; relaxing and easy to have conversations with friends. Can get really beautiful photos in Raffles hotel.

Food wise, it was average and not worth the cost. The special high tea menu (Vienna Set, same cost, $78++) has to be booked in advance. However, there was no instructions to do so when reservations were made via Chope. To ensure no disappointment, indicate in notes the chosen high tea set."
"To Vienna and back, while lounging in comfortable seating to enjoy a well-planned afternoon tea","Having tried afternoon tea once at the Grand Lobby in 2019, the description of special cocktails alongside various savoury treats and Viennese sweets for a limited period was too tempting to pass up. I did not have time to try afternoon tea during my October 2020 stay at this hotel which I have just reviewed, so a November 2020 return to RHS is necessary.

After doing my hair at the hair salon within RHS premises, I arrived 30 minutes too early and had to wait, because weekends are understandably a popular time for everyone to have afternoon tea. But 15 minutes into waiting, a table was ready, and I was escorted to my seat.

Assistant Manager Gibson of the Grand Lobby team is diplomatically attentive and helpful, and his cheerful mien brightened up this day of dull pouring rain. He suggested I try the blue tea from Waikato (pay SGD 10 extra), and it was a lovely complement with the tea menu. Smoky and sweet, it inspired ideas as I used my phone to internet-browse and figure out how to solve my current tech issues.

I ordered the Rumtopf Milk Punch cocktail for this afternoon tea, which is not to be confused with the milk punch cocktail in RHS Long Bar. That Long Bar cocktail concocted as a tribute to Rudyard Kipling is a dark rich opaque glass of delicious gut-warming complexity punctuated with the likes of spiced saffron almond milk mixed with distilled apricot sweetness and heightened with ginger liqueur. This cocktail concocted from the currently-closed Writers Bar for the afternoon tea arrives as a clear delicate golden shimmering mystery in a pretty glass imprinted with intricately patterned floral blossoms.

It was so good that I ordered a second glass. The bitter citrus and spices had been fused with the seasonal fruits in a hugely complex process that is not expressed in the simple description, and the skill required to successfully create this wonderful pleasure for the tastebuds is hugely commendable. It would make a great guessing game at a drinking party involving cigars, cheeses and fruits.

Nicholas smilingly brought some history into the mix as he presented the drink, and hearing the likes of the recipe being more than 300 years old alongside a snippet involving Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt made it even more special. I could imagine elvish royalty casually drinking this at dinner, at celebrations, and as a tribute to the stars in the sky.

With such a lofty standard to begin with, does the food in the afternoon tea match up? A very admirable attempt to scale that incredibly high bar is duly appreciated. Intense smoked salmon curled beneath a crown of salmon roe and the entire rose of salmon goodness sat upon a bed of crème fraîche, which also hosted half a boiled quail egg. The baked ham & cheese sandwich was finger-licking, and the wonderful pickled herring cosily enveloped within a baguette temporarily brought me to Denmark and Sweden, which I am familiar with. Deepfried Maine lobster accompanied prawn on rye bread, and the base plate of savouries will leave you wanting more.

Moving on to the middle tier, the slice of sachertorte may not have been the original cake that was created in 1832 for Prince Metternich in Vienna, but it was enough chocolate for me in one afternoon. I should have saved it for last. Apple strudel two thumbs up for flakiness and apple and all things a delightful strudel needs to be, sponge roulade with strawberry jam needing more of a contrast with its other 2 companions.

What would have helped this afternoon tea reach its zenith: Guests being told to start in an anticlockwise manner when dining. Starting with the salmon and finishing with the lobster, then starting with the sponge roulade and finishing with marble bundt cake (which should have been interchanged with sachertorte in terms of position), then the doughnut before the sachertorte as the top tier. A great symphony requires co-ordination.

The final tier is the marble bundt cake and a doughnut stuffed with apricot jam. If you desire good sufganiyot, this doughnut satisfies those cravings. My chief complaints food-wise were not enough of all those delicacies and wanting more but if I did so, I would not be able to eat the scones.

How do the scones measure up? It is easy to find lousy scones in Singapore, even in afternoon teas. I can find better scones elsewhere (maybe 2 other places) but as they are, these scones are very enjoyable and better than many places in Singapore that I have tried. My only complaint is wanting them to stay warmer for longer.

Rose jam and clotted cream accompanies these scones. If one wanted to nitpick about the clotted cream, it is possible if you are a clotted cream connoisseur but for the pricetag, Raffles Hotel offers a high-quality afternoon tea here. Mariage Frères is a french gourmet tea company, whereby several options from them are typically offered as choices with the food for the afternoon tea menus. I am familiar with their teas, and I have my favourites from this tea company.

I shall hope RHS Writers' Bar can open soon. If you want a quieter afternoon at the Grand Lobby for afternoon tea, choose a weekday. But even at full capacity, enjoying tea here is not difficult. The only downside might be the strict 90-minute limit for enjoying such a tea, understandable for the limited number of widely-spaced tables and popularity. If they could extend it to 100 minutes, that would be lovelier.

With an experience such as this, foreseeing a return is a pleasurable anticipation. Kudos to the service team overseeing afternoon tea!"
Afternoon Tea at The Raffles in the Time of Covid -19,"During this time of the Covid -19 Pandemic - globally - stepping out frequently is not the norm for me. If done its with much trepidation; and caution; and when I do it’s usually to The Raffles Singapore - as I’m fully confident of the high level of vigilance and hygiene there...
So it was a relaxing experience for my husband and I to partake in Afternoon Tea there - again and again - when a day time celebration is called for! As usual we were not disappointed on 30 August with the service and “ hygienic but not sterile” atmosphere that prevailed!
The champagne was chilled at the optimum temperature; the Scones warm; and the squid ink finger sandwiches absolutely delicious!
I cannot comment more - as i never go beyond the finger sandwiches! Although the petit fours etc looked scrumptious!
It was a memorable day for me and my husband!"
Lacklustre afternoon tea,"The pricing vs quality of the tea set is not congruent. The scone served were cold.

The chocolate cakes were lumpy and when cut, the cakes were falling off in crumbs.

In short, not worth the visit and price unless the menu substantially improves."
OK Only,"Wanted to step into the newly opened Raffles Hotel, so decided to try their high tea at the Grand Lobby. Reservations was pretty painless and I decided to order their New York High Tea set, which has to be ordered in advance if that’s what you would like to try. Nice ambience however on arrival, as a solo diner, was sat right at the entrance, which wasn’t exactly what I had in mind for a nice quite afternoon tea. Thankfully they were able to shift me to another table. Their orange pekoe tea was delicate and fragrant. The high tea set, which took half hour to be served (of the 1.5hr timeslot you’re given) came in a three tier plate set - classic style. The food was ok only, nothing spectacular and the brownie that was served was a tad dry. For a $100 price tag inclusive of taxes & parking, it was an experience on the side of pricey. Guess one is paying for the ambience of sitting in a nice lobby with high ceilings. Can’t say I’d be back for another experience though."
Afternoon tea is at 78++ per pax and spread is for peasants,"if it is not for the hotel credit, we wouldn't have tried the afternoon tea at grand lobby. the spread is lacklustre (without any premium ingredients) and it is totally not worth the price.
comes with
x2 scones
x1 choice of refillable tea or
refillable coffee
x4 selection of savour sandwiches
and (i didnt count)
a selection of sweets.

Just check out my picture to decide if it is worth the price.
Ambience is normal. you can people watch as it is along the aisle at the grand entrance. So i am not even sure if this can be call ambience"
A disappointment for a 5 or 6-star hotel,"The Grand Lobby was genuinely grand and classy. However, the corner set aside for afternoon tea was quite dark and crammed. There were still stains on the cutlery. The wait staff was not all that attentive. There was not much variation in the savoury - only sandwiches were served. Quite limited, although the sweets were tasty. Scones tasted more like 'bread', texture was just wrong.
The tea range looked more interesting - fragrant tea with well-balanced taste.
Unlikely to return because really not worth the value"
Tea in the grand lobby,Food is quite disappointing. For the price you pay you would expect something of higher quality and a bit more choice. The sandwiches are very basic. Overall not a memorable experience.
5-star service,"Impeccable service. Staff are extremely attentive and go out of their way to ensure I had a pleasant experience.

Unfortunately that is not enough. We ordered a classic high tea. For SGD78 per head (excluding tax and service charge), the food served is paltry. Not only that, I did not enjoy most of the items. To be honest, they didn’t taste that good. The scones are tasteless. The bread is rough. Perhaps, I had a high expectation because of the price tag and reputation. I was disappointed.

Nevertheless, the ambience is nice. People can just take photos outside. You don’t have to pay such a high price for that. Service staff are friendly and helpful. The kitchen should really look into the quality of the food. I am proud of Raffles’a heritage and hope that I can be proud of the quality of the high tea as well."
High tea at the Grand Lobby,"High tea at the Grand Lobby

This is my first visit after the long restoration in Raffles Hotel.

The grand lobby was pretty, classy and stylish .

However it wasn’t big enough or the tables are placed too close to one another. There is no sense of privacy and space.

High tea was good and service was good."
Afternoon Tea on 26th July - Service was Perfect!,"Went to Raffles Hotel on a lazy Sunday afternoon (26th July) for afternoon tea. It was supposed to be just a short one, but because it was so comfortable, i ended up extending my tea session all the way till dinner (it was off peak hours so it wasn't too busy for me to extend).

The service was impeccable. Everyone is so warm and friendly, it almost feels like you're visiting a friend's home, instead of a hotel. Don't get me wrong, everything about Raffles Hotel exudes opulence and elegance, but not over the top. And i think this homey atmosphere is all thanks to the warmth and professionalism of the staff.

Dian was the one attending to us and she was perfect. I would not have felt so comfortable if not for her warm and professional service. She has extensive knowledge of the menu and always knows what to recommend. And most importantly her recommendations are always perfect. She was very attentive as well.

Please convey my compliments to her. Really enjoyed the personalized service from Dian and I would like to wish her all the best to her career at Raffles Hotel. Looking forward to see her again for our next visit."
Lazy Saturday Noon Tea 25 July 2020,"Absolutely blown away by the gorgeous entrance. Impeccable service by the staff. Love the 3 tiered high tea set. 4 for the price of 3! Tat was a pleasant surprise as I wasn’t even aware if it before I booked. Recommended to book early to avoid disappointment. Food wise, I’m more drawn to the sweets like the mousse, apple tart, pineapple crumble, chocolate cake etc.. the savory could be better. But worth it!"
Impeccable service,"We had high tea at the Raffles Grand Lobby. Food was good, service was impeccable. Warm and friendly staff offered to help us take pictures and showed us where to pose for the perfect picture! Only let down on the 90mins dinning time which is way too short for such a wonderful ambiance."
Spending an Afternoon @ The Grand Lobby,"My wife and I went for an afternoon tea for two at The Grand Lobby. I followed the hotel's renovation and wanted to see the majestic result , the hotel looked beautiful. The harp playing was soothing and added enchanted touch to the ambience.

We were greeted by Diana, who was well informed of the teas served. We decided to go with her recommendations and we were not disappointed.

The pastries were served by staffs wearing a mask. While I understand that it is due to the virus, most of the time, I wasn't able to comprehend what was being said.

The sandwiches were substandard as the bread was dry. Pastries like the apple tart was repulsive to say the least.

Throughout our time there, Diana constantly checked on us. When she saw the untouched sandwiches, she was very proactive and asked if we wanted to have more scones or our favourite hazelnut pastry instead.

The silver lining on our dining experience was that we knew the high standards of service and reputation of the hotel which has been nostalgically echoed for years. You will be pleased to know that Diana portrayed the very essence of upholding the standards of service required to be in a prestigious hotel.
When questioned on how long she had been working for Raffles hotel, we were surprised to find out she had been there for less than a month. Please convey these compliments to her.

Overall, we expected more in terms of the food served from a great establishment such as Raffles. However we enjoyed the personalized service and wishing Diana the very best in her career ahead."
Sterile ...,"We had been recommended to visit Raffles for afternoon tea by several who came pre-refurbishment. Their description was in a different league from our experience. It was a nice traditional English afternoon tea, but there was nothing special about it. Only going as far as the entrance lobby, you don't get the feel of the history and ambience of it. The pastries were a creation, but my husband makes better scones. The service was polite, but indifferent, and I wouldn't say they were as attentive as other places we have been in London. If we are back in Singapore ever, we would not repeat this experience, sadly. We were looking forward to a treat at the end of our holiday."
Afternoon tea - it was ok,"We'd previously eaten an excellent afternoon buffet in the Tiffin Room some years ago, and went hoping for the same. Disappointingly, since refurb this was no longer on offer so we op-ed for afternoon tea.

The first battle was actually accessing the hotel as we were not residents and hadn't booked ahead. The doorman seemed very suspicious that we might actually want to go in and spend some money in the hotel without advance booking - this was a bit off-putting.

Once inside, there was a big show of trying to find us an empty table (there were lots!). Once seated the tea itself was ok but poor value at c$240 for tea and a glass of champagne each.

The hotel is beautiful and the staff generally very professional. However, the touristy nature of the experience was highlighted by one of the staff asking whether we wanted our photo taken.

Overall, I'd only recommend it if it was one of those things you wanted to tick off your list."
Afternoon Tea,We have afternoon tea whist staying at the hotel and the strawberry and prosecco jam was really good. The gluten free scones were amazing.
A lovely experience,"We visited Singapore for our honeymoon on 2018 and were so disappointed to find out raffles was closed for renovations. When we visited Singapore again afternoon tea here was top of our list. After reading some of the recent reviews we were debating whether to still go but are so glad we did.
It was a really enjoyable experience, there was a great variety of food and they kindly catered well for my husband who is vegetarian. Cherry our waitress was very attentive and we never felt rushed. The harp playing in the background was a nice touch. We left feeling very full and satisfied. Yes it is pricy but you are paying for the experience."
The best afternoon tea,"We enjoyed our afternoon tea with great service by Gibson and the team. The 3 tier stand served elegantly to pair with premium tea. The place is so relax and you feel home. Will definitely come back again and recommend to friends! Trust me, your visit is worth it."
Afternoon tea - not quite!,"My sister and I booked afternoon tea in advance of our trip to Singapore. We had heard it was a must have experience. On arrival we were shown to out table. The ambience was indeed beautiful but the afternoon tea left much to be desired. The sandwiches were cold veg in bread, the pastries were ok, the scones ( we were given 2 each) were luke warm, and despite asking for macchiato I got jasmine tea. Having had afternoon tea at the Dorchester, Langham and the RItz I had understood the practice is to continue to replenish until you stay stop. This did not happen and frankly the service left much to be desired. The attentive service expected in a place such as Raffles was sadly missing. Given how much we paid a very very disappointing experience."
Grand Lobby afternoon tea - Mediocre experience,"We had afternoon tea in Raffles hotel in 2016 in the Tiffin room and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The food was delicious, the service was excellent and the surroundings were pretty spectacular. All in all good value for money. So in 2019 we decided to repeat our experience whilst travelling through Singapore. We booked our afternoon tea and were informed that it was now being served in the Grand Lobby not the Tiffin Room. We assumed that the change of location would not affect either the service or the food we would have to eat. How wrong were we. We arrived there on the 21st December to a fantastically decorated Grand Lobby and were shown our seats. We were then given a menu and asked to pick our tea - which we all did, one of us choosing a speciality tea the rest of us had English Breakfast tea. We were looking for the delicious choices of various pastries, sandwiches, dim sum, puddings etc. that were on offer on our previous visit but were informed that we would be receiving a selection of cakes and sandwiches and that was it.

I can honestly say that the service has gone down hill, I have had better afternoon teas in ordinary hotels in London in less salubrious surroundings. Raffles has decided to prioritise its decor for service and value for money. There is nothing special about Raffles afternoon tea, they have definitely decided to pull in as many tourists as possible, using their colonial history as a hook to get people to come to the hotel. However, once there it is nothing to shout about, ordinary afternoon tea with a few sandwiches and cakes. Nothing special and no WOW factor.
When we were presented with the bill for the day you can imagine our surprise when we were charged an extra $15 for the speciality tea that one person had chosen. When we questioned the manager he pointed out that it was there on the menu. He had to point to it, written in very small letters at the bottom of the page where you would definitely miss it. The waitress did not point this out at the time or ordering, had she done so we would not have ordered the speciality tea.
I will never return to Raffles again as it is nothing special and it is using its history to pull in the tourists and then offering them a mediocre experience.
As far as visiting the Long Bar - you can forget that experience too. We could not get in as there was a cruise ship in town and the queue was around the block."
Expect to leave feeling like you were ripped-off,"The service was pleasant but inattentive — it took nearly 45 minutes to be served.

Tea: the teas are good, although the selection is limited (unless you want to pay extra). The black tea was served with room temperature milk, which is unforgivable.

The centre-piece scones were inedible: undercooked, tasting strongly of flour. My ten-year old bakes better versions at home. The strawberry jam was overpowered by something that made it taste like you were eating perfume.

The sandwiches: portions are meagre — approximately one sandwich per person. There are no refills. The fillings are good, but nothing more than you would expect from a café located in a mall. The breads appear mass-produced rather than made on site.

Petite four: each person receives five petite four. The highlight was the hazelnut choux, which was universally enjoyed. The apple tart topped with a tempered chocolate bomb was bizarre and unpleasant; the panna cotta disgusting, as it became watery due to the strawberry gel on top; and the other cakes were forgettable.

And the price charged for this abomination was extortionate compared to the offering.

On the plus side, the setting was impressive, and the champagne was nice."
Simply Elegant,"High tea was a lovely experience, even though as others have said very expensive for what you get, but for me it was more about sitting in the lobby in this beautiful hotel with a harp playing in the background, beautiful china and tea selections, lovely service and a nice selection of sandwiches and sweets. I would of loved some warm mini savories added to the selection. Just keep in mind champagne is not included up to $33 extra for the Rose' for 1 glass."
birthday treat for husband,"I booked online to enjoy high tea in December during our visit to Singapore. We were seated by a window in the grand lobby, I luckily had my back to the window my husband was facing, he continually felt like he was being stared at by people passing the window and taking photos through the glass. I had booked champagne high tea, which on the website is around $80 however the bill I paid for 2 was $259 . Never again. So pleased we chose not to stay there"
Average afternoon tea,"Very average afternoon tea, service not attentive enough and food only average. The history of the place is the only reason to visit, felt the sandwiches were very mediocre and the scones were just awful."
High tea with some history,"This was an outstanding, although expensive, treat and something I've long wanted to do - High Tea at Raffles is not to be missed. The building is fantastic, the staff are first class as is the High Tea itself. Myself, my Son and his wife all attended here on New Years Eve for a very special, to us, morning tea. I've been to many and varied other establishments for High Tea and come away positively starving. None of us could finish our ""allotted"" assortment of sandwiches, pastries, and deserts, let alone the seemingly endless supply of scones, clotted cream, jam and tea. This is an experience not to be missed."
Afternoon High Tea is an Excellent Experience,"If you visit Singapore, you'll of course go to a hawker centre and walk down Orchard Road. It used to be that you'd also order a Singapore Sling at the Raffles Hotel bar, but if you're into more elegant experiences, I suggest reserving afternoon high tea at the Grand Lobby café. It is expensive but worth it. (January 2020)"
High tea here is low tea,"While the food was good and the building beautifully restored, the service was basically non-existent. First when taking our order the staff asked the male at our table first. Ok not such a big deal but at a place like this one would expect more. To make matters worse we had to ask to refill our tea each time our cups were empty, we waited almost 45 minutes for our scones, were never asked if everything was ok, if we wanted more of anything - basically the service was terrible and definitely not what you expect from a pricey high tea experience in a colonial setting. We would not recommend when there are other places to go with better tea options and service. To add insult to injury charging for water seems a bit much."
Mixed High Tea Experience; Poor Service,"My family and I had afternoon tea at the Raffles during a December visit to Singapore, after hearing the Raffles, post-renovation, was a must-see for travelers to Singapore. The grand lobby offered a beautiful backdrop for afternoon tea and the sandwiches, sweets and scones served were very good, however we found the service very lacking. Once we received our tea and the three-tiered stands, nearly 45 minutes passed before we were offered scones and we had to flag down a member of the waitstaff to get refills on our tea on a number of occasions. No one came to ask how our tea service was, if we needed anything or otherwise to inquire about us or our experience. A male member of our party even has to correct a waiter for trying to take his order before the orders of the women in our group. Waitstaff here are friendly enough when we had their attention but we felt generally ignored for the majority of this experience, including having to ask repeatedly for our check at the end. It is certainly not worth its hefty price tag. Will certainly head to the Ritz or the Four Seasons next time."
Raffles “High Tea”- Disappointing Service,"We booked online for three adults and a child a month in advance and requested a window seat. Upon arrival on time, our table was not ready. In addition, we had to reiterate the window seat request as the host had ignored this. After some quiet words the host subsequently made changes in order to accommodate our request. I recommend that you do request a window seat (in advance) as the tea is served in the hotel main lobby. Poor seating will affect your experience as you will be watched over by people entering and exiting the venue. Solid choice of teas, however some are “premium” and come at an additional cost. The main treats consist of sandwiches, small cakes and dessert. No seconds. This is followed by plain and fruit scones served with jam and clotted cream. Ambience is nice, with quiet music in the background. The service was a “mixed-bag” with clearly some staff better trained than others. The gentlemen who introduced the menu was excellent and he offered hot chocolate for the child who was accompanying us. However when it came to the selection of drinks it was another member of staff who took the order. He was nonchalant and said hot chocolate was unavailable and offered no alternative but simply cited the reason as being it was after 4pm. We called the first staff member who reiterated hot chocolate is available and took the orders. No apology from the staff member who made the error, in fact no acknowledgement was given. Third staff member served our scones before we had finished the sandwiches and dropped a scone on the table, staff overall look nervy and on edge, it could be a management issue. Tea pouring was sporadic, sometimes cups were topped up and other times there were no staff in sight. One teapot was given between two adults who ordered the same tea blend, which caused further inconvenience as the pot was passed crossed table.

To summarise we were disappointed at the service given on this particular occasion. This is really what you are paying for."
Booked afternoon tea,Trying to book afternoon tea four days in advance we were disappointed with times we were offered. So changed date with same reply from smart looking lady. She was called away an a guy instantly gave us 2pm perfect. Lunch with champagne was special and very enjoyable. The annoying thing was there were plenty of tables unused for other time slots whilst we were there.. guessing she was saving them for residents? Stand your ground to ensure you get a good time slot.
Disappointing afternoon tea,"We visited Singapore in October and I hoped our highlight would be afternoon tea at raffles , how wrong could I be ? After walking 20 mins from our hotel in closed heeled shoes we got there to find that the dress code wasn’t as advertised and men were in dress shorts and a couple of woman were wearing open toed shoes , 1 pair I would describe as posh flip flops , a couple of ladies were shown to a table in front of us but didn’t like the look of the table (low chairs ) so we’re shown to another table , we were then shown to that exact table and I said I didn’t want to sit there and pointed to another table which had dirty crockery on so were told we couldn’t . We then sat on the low uncomfortable chairs , afternoon tea was a huge disappointment ,had to ask for milk twice , sandwiches not that nice . Asked for a cake in a glass cabinet at side of room and was told that was for the champagne afternoon tea ! Only 1 teabag so tea was weak , asked for more tea but only got more hot water no different teabag. Paid £45 each for this and I can honestly say I’ve had better at my local garden centre ! I contacted raffles by email to complain , I had to send it twice before I got any acknowledgement of the email and then was offered a free glass of champagne on my next visit ! There won’t be a return visit !honestly , save your money ! Don’t bother going !"
Afternoon tea - already missing the old formula,"Let’s start with the positive:
the Lobby is stunning and getting a chance to walk through it is a delightful experience.
The other positive: the waiter who took care of us. Adorable and took care of our dietary requirements with a lovely smile. The sandwiches and cakes were lovely. Not amazing, but lovely.

The not so positive: I got there a little early (20min), the Lobby was empty (ie half of the tables were empty) and a quite unpleasant host simply told me to turn around and wait outside for the right time. I get that the Lobby experience must not be spoiled by random wanderers, but this was me, early, with a valid booking, waiting for my friends. As I had just had surgery (not your problem, I know), it took me 5 min to walk to the sofas outdoors, waited 15min for my friends and took another 5min to walk back in, and get a table that had been empty the whole time...

Having to pay extra (15$) for my Darjeeling tea (delicious) also seemed like an overkill. It is a high tea, isn’t it? Wouldn’t you expect an acceptable selection of tea to be included? Apparently not.

Honestly, at any other hotels, I would have simply canceled the booking and left. I guess the Raffles is playing its reputation. I am also going to guess that things will improve. Right?"
High tea,"We booked a high tea to finish our holiday. As the last sitting, we got odd teapots, not matching the elegant cups and plates. large enough for 4 cups, the pot had 1 teabag, leaving the tea very weak. When I asked for low fat milk, it came in a coffee cup, not a jug. Sandwiches were one inch cubes..4 each, but they were dry edged(try a damp teatowel!) Patisserie was good BUT ...
For $93 Australian, this was a mistake. I did a better cup in my hotel"
Afternoon Tea,"Disappointed with the Afternoon Tea. Was there in 2017 in the Tiffin Room and it was quite different this time.
Now tables near the lobby and no privacy with guests walking nearby in the lobby. The value of $S160 for this just seems too extreme for what we had. Obviously paying for the privilege of sitting in Raffles. In 2017 the food was much better and more and better value. Yes it’s a treat but an expensive experience."
What a disappointment!,"We visit our son in Singapore 2-3 times each year and one of the treats was afternoon tea at Raffles.
Having missed out the last few times because of the refurbishment, we were really pleased to be going again after its reopening.
However instead of being truly memorable experience with a wide variety of traditional high tea, hot dishes and apparently limitless sandwiches it has become just like any other high tea on a three tiered cake stand, the same as is available in my local high street but at four times the cost. an extra plate of sandwiches were provided after specific requesting them but it is now a totally unmemorable experience and one we would not recommend to anyone."
Try elsewhere.,"Raffles Hotel is beautiful and I’m sure staying there would be an experience. My daughter and I went for High Tea. While everything is run efficiently, I would not describe my experience as welcoming, happy to take your money but if you’re not a guest of the hotel than you’re second class. High Tea is served in the Lobby and if you need a rest room then it’s the outside toilet. No background music and service is average. My daughter and I have had a number of High Teas on our holidays and would advise others to try elsewhere."
Only 90 Minutes High Tea,"I drop 1 star because we were supposed have that Raffles Expetience but it was a let down..

Guess when rennovated, expectations are high.

When my friend wanted to celebrate a birthday and also our years of friendship, we decided to visit this renew old lady for English High Tea.

At $80nett, for High Tea a la carte, not many working folks would consider.

We decided for our birthday girl, we really want to try.

So we emailed ahead and got a confirmation, we had checked the timing as we wanted a place we can sit and chat. The website stated 12.30pm to 6pm. Wow!
PERFECT!

So we were excited and was on time, the door man, the greeters were fantastic. Love the service of the Malay manager in a suit. Very friendly and polite. He deserves to be there.

We were seated in a neat corner and a gentlmen Raymond attended to us. PERFECT again. We did not get to see the hotel rooms as only guests are allowed but the lobby looks like any other hotel lobby but more personalised.

The tea items were ok. Sandwiches are sandwiches, cakes are cakes, mousse are mousse, etc if you had savoured English Hi Tea before. There was no ""wow"" factor. However, the creativity and effort by the pastry team is still admired. The plus to us were the attention to details by Raymond. He is an asset. Always smiling, helping us get good birthday photo.

Everything was great till a ""bald"" headed(sorry i did not get his name ) came and is nff came and gave us the bill. We were shock. We still have our sandwiches unfinished. He was abrupt, uncaring and in a stern tone told us we only have 90 minutes. OMG! We seriously did not read the fine lines that say only 90 minutes for $240.

We are aware some hotels do practise 2 seatings but they would inform us when we booked. The website did not state 1230pm to 6pm high tea subject to 90 minutes per seating.

The great experience we felt from Raymond just went down because of this other staff as he lack empathy for the guests.

As Raymond came to apologise, we did not want to give him a tough time so without finishing our sandwiches, we left with a bitter taste. That staff needs to learn how to not destroy a custome good experience. It is tough to creat outstanding service experience but you can destroy a great one in a second!

You can have a almost perfect expensive hotel but when service fails, everything else fail.
Customers may not remember all the good points but one small bad experience leaves a bitter taste.

Raffles may not bother about any reviews but we are highlighting so they can take note to inform customers ahead.

The Raffles experience we had was definitely not acceptable!

Other than this staff, the staff at the entrance is just great!"
Afternoon tea Raffles,"Had afternoon tea here for my daughter’s 21st birthday. Having enjoyed afternoon tea at many other London establishments I thought this would be
on par. It’s not unfortunately. The sandwiches were equivalent to two slices of bread, cut into 4 squares. The choice of pastries were limited. My daughter is
vegetarian but was told there wasn’t an option so she had one slice of bread cut into two. Was surprised to hear that they didn’t replenish the sandwiches unlike those in London. Apart from the beautiful setting of Raffles and attentive staff the actual event is average and overpriced."
Cream Tea,"Went for cream tea. It cost £140 for two adults and one child. The newly decorated hotel looks beautiful and is very, very clean. Staff were friendly. Unfortunately, the food was far too pretentious and not very nice. We left more than half of it. It took 20 minutes to get a pot of tea. The tea was cold! We had noticed that people around us had left a lot of their food and we wondered why they hadn't a) finished it and b) boxed it and taken it away. We realised why after! The sandwiches weren't very nice. One had curried bread, another had paste. The best was the egg and that was very bland. The sweet treats were pleasant but the jam served with the scones was infused with petals. They really shouldn't have bothered. But that is just a personal preference BUT it would appear that others felt the same by leaving theirs too. I also thought that the fact that the tables weren't cleared for over 20+ minutes was sloppy.
Again, the staff were lovely. I believe her name was Sarah, she was extremely helpful and friendly and showed great professionalism."
Afternoon Tea - very disappointing,"Whilst staying in Singapore at a different hotel (Shangri-La) - we booked for afternoon tea at Raffles with high hopes of a wonderful experience. There is no doubt the hotel is a beautiful place...BUT - do not book afternoon tea. What an utter disappointment and rip off. Similar to other reviews at no point were we offered more of any plate - when having afternoon tea in other luxurious hotels such as Claridges, you are offered sandwiches and cakes, tea or coffee for the one price until you stop. I was also very disappointed to find out that I had picked a premium tea and was charged an additional SGD15.00 - at no point was I made aware of that. I would not recommend this to anyone. I wish we had booked afternoon tea at the Shangri_La, based on our stay there I am sure it would have been wonderful"
"Terrible service and time limit for high tea, my guests were disappointed","First of all, your staff gave wrong directions to my guest, who had to ask 4 different staff for directions on how to get to the grand lobby, to which they directed her to a backgate, but she could not enter as she was not a guest at the hotel and did not have an access card. She had to walk to the main entrance in the blazing sun, and as a result arrived 15 minutes late.

Secondly, we never not told by email, or verbally, that there was a time limit of 1.5 hours for the high tea, such information is not stated on the hotel's website. We were seated from 1 pm, but we only started to eat at around 1:30 pm, as one of my guests were late from poor instructions on how to get to the grand lobby. We did not even manage to start on the last tier of dessert items, when the waiter came to chase us out of the restaurant!

Worse still, he did not ask politely, but instead bluntly interrupted our conversation to ask whether we would like him to clear the table and put the food in a takeaway bag. We replied that we were not done eating, to which he replied there was a time limit of 1.5 hours for the high tea.

We were absolutely surprised and shocked, as we had no idea of the time limit. I checked my email bookings, and the website, and there was no indication whatsoever of the time limit of 1.5 hours. We were further annoyed at the rude responses of the waiter.

We were a party of 4 people, and when we looked around, there was nobody waiting and there were other tables for 4 which were unoccupied. Was there really a need to chase us out based on a time limit, which we were not informed about?

We are terribly disappointed with such unreasonable service, and really expected more from such a classic hotel."
The afternoon tea is a waste of money,"So, as an afternoon tea lover and expert from Europe I was really looking forward to this afternoon tea at Raffles hotel (Raffles equals high expectations right?). My husband and I went with 2 friends. My goodness. This was such a disappointing experience. Here’s why:

1) The food didn’t look impressive at all.
2) The afternoon tea didn’t have a theme, so it felt like randomly picked together.
3) The taste was just normal or even below average.
4) The staff was not friendly (okay, except for the woman who showed us the menu).
5) After almost 1,5 hours we were told that it was time to go since the next slot was starting. Excuse me? 1,5 hour for such an expensive afternoon tea. Do you even understand the concept of an afternoon tea? You gotta take it slow in order to enjoy it. Btw, nobody told us we would only have 1,5 hours.
6) Also, the way the staff ‘demanded’ us to go was not friendly at all. He came twice within less than 10 minutes. I mean, we are customers! Please let the staff take a course in customers service.
7) Just don’t go here, it’s not worth the money."
Disappointing afternoon tea,"We’ve been a couple of times in the past for afternoon tea at Raffles and loved it. We raved about it to our friends who we took there this week, only to be disappointed by what was presented to us. It’s all very grand, but the tiered cake plate was brought, with four tiny sandwiches with different fancy bread for each filling, which weren’t that special, and a small selection of sweet things, including a mango mousse in a small glass with no spoon to eat it with. We had to use a teaspoon from our teacup for that! We then had to wait some time for the scones to be brought over.
They could do with putting more savouries on the stand.
Originally you queued up to select what you wanted from a buffet table in the Tiffin room and could choose from the many delicious morsels, then go back for more if you wished.
I can understand that some people do take the Mickey and eat far too much, but the majority will only eat a few things, but can have more savouries if they prefer.
The ambience used to have a special colonial feel to it, but this has unfortunately been lost. The hotel looks very nice, but we felt that Raffles doesn’t have the same atmosphere any more. We won’t be recommending it to friends and clients any more. There are other places that do a better afternoon tea, and we probably won’t be back.
The other disappointment was that we couldn’t have a Singapore Sling with our afternoon tea, and could only get them in the Long Bar. That’s all very well, and we were fine about going to the Long Bar after our tea, only to find a queue out the door, and no chance of our drink in any other bar in the hotel! No way were we going to queue for ages with families with buggies too, so we decided to go back to our own hotel for that drink.
A real shame! Whoever is responsible for the changes should rethink them."
"AFTERNOON HIGH TEA - ""VERY DISAPPOINTING""","We looked forward to celebrating our mother's 70th birthday, but were left feeling very disappointed! This was our 2nd experience, as we were there in July 2016, and really enjoyed ourselves immensely, at the Tiffin Room!!! However, our experience this time in The Grand Lobby, paled in comparison, which left us bewildered, on what was a very special occasion! The staff were extremely disorganized, and the food was average! Tea and coffee was to be included, but instead we were given a menu to select a tea, only to be charged $10 extra. If we had known of this prior, we would not have bothered! But please note, no coffee or tea was delivered to our table at any point throughout our high tea. The booking on-line, needs to be made more clear, as I thought we had paid prior to going, but instead caused great embarrassment for both us and the staff member, who was chasing us around the hotel, seeking payment. Unfortunately, we found that the renovations, have now lost the atmosphere, of what was The Raffles Hotel charm! There is a saying, ""If it's not broken, don't fix it""! When holidaying in Singapore in the future, we will be trying a different venue, for our high tea!"
"The best afternoon tea, no! but still worth doing","An iconic hotel, a fantastic city, an average afternoon tea.
The ambience was made special with a lovely harpist playing popular tunes, however the service was not tip top and you are stared at through the windows.Loved the sandwiches and bread, and did not think there would be enough food, but there was. However top layer of cakes were not enjoyed by any of us. Loved the way they brewed the tea prior to serving, but then had to ask for milk and sugar. Also had to ask for spoons to eat one of the puddings. Over piriced but if it is an indulgence you can afford ..why not. (But the Ritz London is way better at everything). Long bar completely overpriced. Just go and have a walk around the grounds and stare at the other people eating and drinking and save your money."
Afternoon tea at The Grand Lobby,"The settings are beautiful, there was an harpist playing at the Grand Lobby, very nice touch!

The afternoon party was good, only thing there was too many cakes, I would have preferred more savoury items.

One thing I was disappointed was that if you drink coffee they will not offer you a second cup but for tea drinkers they give you a pot for each person and you can ask for more.

Also what it ruined our experience was the person who suddenly came to our table with the bill saying we need to pay as the table was only available for 90 minutes, I paid over 200 Singapore dollards, when I asked if we could take the cakes away (we had 5 cakes left) he gave us such an awful look when I saw other people taking the leftovers away, it took over 15 minutes to bring us the cakes."
Afternoon Tea,"Disappointing, food was OK but took ages to arrive, had to keep chasing up coffee and service wasn't great had to ask for a refill. Grand lobby is fab decor. Expected more. Said we wanted to go for a Singapore sling afterwards but not offered the chance. Staff were not very friendky"
Afternoon Tea,"Booked afternoon tea with my family as a last treat before leaving Singapore. I travel there regularly and have been waiting for it to reopen for over a year!
I received an email confirmation for the tea which clearly stipulated ""Dress code for The Grand Lobby is Casual Chic. Gentlemen are encouraged to wear shirt and trousers teamed with appropriate covered toes footwear. Ladies may be dressed in their casual best, dresses, skirts or trousers with appropriate footwear, toes-covered shoes or heels. No shorts, open-toes shoes or sandals, pool attire is not permitted.""
As we were there on holiday and my son only had smart shorts with him, I called to check that this would be OK. I was told its OK for children, but a 15 year old risked being turned away. We therefore went out and bought smart chinos for the occasion at not an inconsiderable cost. I was then horrified to see the standard of dress allowed in the Grand Lobby. At least 4 adult men were wearing shorts. Many were in jeans and trainers. A few also in Birkenstock type sandals and t-shirts. No-one was turned away as I had been told. When I complained we were offered an apology and given extra desserts to take home. Half of these contained nuts which we couldn't eat due to allergies. I wish I had asked for the cost of the chinos bought that morning back instead. Really disappointing. Completely took the shine off our last day in this beautiful city."
Review of Raffle’s Afternoon Tea,"It was really underwhelming.. The food took forever to arrive, almost an hour. And then stuff we would ask for such as water and all, also took a long time. My parents were really looking forward, but ended up disappointed.. Hope they improve service. Coffee was good though."
High tea in the grand lobby,"The welcome was delightful. The lobby presents beautifully and really made my family excited to be there. Seating was pleasant and comfortable. The staff made arrangements very quickly for our children.
We experienced confusion regarding the charges for Children; which had the potential to be embarrassing. I was hosting my family for a birthday celebration and I didn't want the cost to be discussed openly. Use a little discretion please!
We started with champagne which was enjoyable but that meant that the tea service was delayed until we had consumed the champagne. What would have happened if we'd have taken a second glass?
I've read in reviews that the portion sizes at high tea are disappointing. I completely disagree. They were ideal. The richness of the beautifully presented food does not lend itself to vast quantities; best to enjoy the excellent fare and presentation as offered.
Clearly the staff are still getting into the swing of things. We received only one tea refill during the session; and that took so long to come that I didn't bother to seek another pot.The tea itself is delightful.
Now pls understand that I'm paying $500+ for tea. Can you imagine my surprise when workers stared using epoxy 5m away from our table and stinking up the room? They moved on quickly when I complained to our waitress BUT I SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO COMPLAIN! Fix your defects at night!
I do recommend the experience at the grand lobby but recommend you wait for some months for the processes and environment to bed down."
Closed for renovations,"I am posting this to alert visitors that Raffles Singapore is currently closed for restoration with a planned reopening in August 2019. The Long Bar will returns to its original location according to the hotel website.

We went to the Hotel to investigate High Tea options and to have a Singapore Sling. Signage around the Hotel, in terms of the renovations, as far as we could see was minimal, it took us ages to find the Long Bar (which remains operating), as many corridors are closed off. We couldn’t see any external signage about the renovation or about what facilities were available - I found out later via their website. The lack of signage is a bit of a problem as we had a grumpy security person (?) tell us, and several others, that we were in a construction area and should not have been there.

A bit of extra effort in terms of signage and concierge type personnel on the ground during the renovation period would maintain the Hotel’s well deserved reputation for customer relations - particularly as this is a Singapore icon."
Annie and Paul go to Singapore,"Fortunately we visited Raffles in Singapore for afternoon tea just before its closure for extensive renovations. We had booked well in advance and were glad that we had done so as it was extremely busy. I would suggest pre-booking is essential. Although afternoon tea at Raffles is a very expensive treat (well, we thought so), it is well worth it for the experience. We had to to wait in a long queue for our time slot but once the door was opened the experience was slick and efficient. We were seated quickly and the very experienced staff were soon bringing in the cake/sandwich stand and tea, served in very nice bone china cups. The staff were attentive and pleasant. The sandwiches and the cakes, although very nice, were pretty much what you would expect from a high tea experience. It was only after we had eaten the sandwiches and cakes that we discovered there was also a buffet. I particularly found this disappointing as my taste is more savoury than sweet and I would have liked to have had the opportunity to visit the buffet first. (It was only through seeing people on other tables eating the savouries that we learned about the buffet). So, watch out for that! The surroundings are quite beautiful and do take you back to a bygone age. Can definitely recommend, but - be hungry! Strict dress code - the lady in front of us in the queue was turned away because she was wearing shorts. Very good toilet facilities available."
Classic,"The traditional ""High Tea"" was great. Would advise you book before turning up as it was very busy. The Tiffin Room is quintessentially English, with excellent service and delights. Would thoroughly recommend."
Fantastic Experience,"What a fantastic experience. We'd made our reservation plenty of time in advance, which I would recommend as the Tiffin Room looked full once we had been seated. The Tiffin Room staff are very attentive, attending your chair, folding napkins when you get up to visit the buffet.

There were 3 of us, and our afternoon tea was exact; 3 of everything. The buffet was great too. A non alcoholic Singapore Sling is available for the children, so it was great for us each to have one- the Singapore Dling is on top of the afternoon tea price.

There is a strict dress code - gentlemen must wear a collared shirt & trousers with shoes.

Yes it is expensive, but worth the money for the experience, and after all how many times will you get the oportunity to visit Raffles?"
A Singapore must,"If you have time then Raffles is definitely worth a visit- steeped in traditions, which takes you back to that era.
We went for afternoon tea & then a few drinks in the billiards room with which had to be done just to have a cocktail, eat the nuts & throw the shells onto the floor!!!
The hotel is starting a massive renovation and parts were closed when we visited but it didn’t diminish our experience.
Yes, like stated in other reviews, it’s a tad pricey but so worth it."
A True British Influenced CLASSIC,Enjoyed High Tea at Raffles and it was so traditional you might have thought you were in a British Film with the elegant service and enjoyable foods. Well worth a meal and splurge!!
Wonderful afternoon,"I was late for the reservation, but the staff is attentive and very nice to welcome us. The food is delicious and really suitable for taking beautiful pictures! Anyway my friends and me enjoy a wonder afternoon!"
"I would have happily paid, just to sit in the Tiffin room and eat nothing at all.","Knowing that my husband isn't all that fond of high tea type food, I was a little anxious I needn't have worried because there was also a buffet available with mountains of the kind of food he prefers to eat for afternoon tea. See the menu posted by another reviewer. From the moment we arrived we were treated like VIPs. The food was absolutely beautiful and the room exactly as I'd hoped, imagined and expected it to be. The Tiffin Room was very busy so do make sure to book ahead of time. We paid $145 (two people) for a very special experience and for me this was more than worth it."
Great experience,"Great to experience the famous raffles. In places it does feel like it's not had the attention it needs and is a little underwhelming so is a bit hit and miss. It is a great place to eat and drink though, but expect it not to be anywhere near cheap."
Our Best High Tea,We were staying at Raffles and had booked in for the High Tea before we left home. The hotel staff took us straight in to the Tiffin Room and we were the first seated. The staff were very attentive and the food was extensive.
Unpolished,"For some reason this just didn't hit the mark. The afternoon tea wasn't at the level we were expecting.

Our menu had jam on it, they didn't offer us tea until the very end and we asked for some more sandwiches but they never arrived.

The building and ambience is beautiful but we felt like hens in a hen factory at feeding time.

We've had afternoon teas at other well known hotel establishments around the world and this really was a let down."
A lovely afternoon,A real treat for the end of our holiday. A beautiful hotel and delicious food. Service was excellent.
Special!,A very special treat to have High Tea at raffles. A necessity to book as the dining room fills up quickly. Enjoy a 3 tier tray of gorgeous bite size savouries & deserts full of flavour as well as a full buffet selection of pastries/pies/deserts/fruits & more. Tea or coffee & Champagne at a cost if desired.
Created to make you feel special,"The exquisiteness of sharing a High Tea at The Raffles Hotel defies descriptions superlative enough. A great selection of food includes Asian dim sum, to traditional scones and pastries. A three-tiered stand of delicate sandwiches and petit cakes introduces the course. Then you graze at your leisure on all the wonderful foods on offer at the buffet. Many choices of teas, both hot and cold, as well as coffee, and the famous Singapore Sling. What's not to like?"
Don't eat the peanuts,"Fantastic experience and beautiful food in magnificent colonial surrounds. What's not to like? As if the selection of sandwiches and sweet offerings on the tiered stand is not enough there is a buffet with dim sums and scones plus bread and butter pudding and custard to die for. The famous Singapore Sling is cheaper here than elsewhere at the Raffles but I don't think it would be a good accompaniment. Best to stick with the tea, coffee or bubbles.We had our Sling in the billiard room prior to the high tea and ate too many of the complimentary peanuts. Rookie mistake! Go with an empty stomach - there is so much and it's all very good. They will also cater for special dietary requirements with enough notice (which we took advantage of and they did it well)."
Great experience,"Raffles is a must do for any trip into Singapore. The history, the ambience, and the amazing service are all top notch. We booked in for the 3pm high tea, and arrived 1 hour early so we could enjoy a Singapore sling in the famous bar and billiards room (yes, you can still drop the peanut shells on the floor).
The high tea was fantastic, made all the better by the attentive service of Sanjay, our waiter who was exceptional. Raffles are lucky to have someone of Sanjay's calibre as a member of their staff. The bread and butter was a must (so great i kept going back for more) as was the champagne... if you're going to do high tea, do it with the bubbly.
Highly recommend"
One of the highlights of our visit to Singapore!,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Raffles Hotel for afternoon tea. Apart from the expected selection of sandwiches, cakes and scones, there was a hot and cold buffet to choose from. There were renovations going on in parts of the hotel at the time of our visit but they had no effect on our experience. Would definitely recommend it."
Fits the bill,"High Tea at the Raffles is a quintessential experience that is a must-do for travelers through Singapore. It’s the epitome of High Tea and a history of being the best.

We booked through our hotel concierge- they don’t take walk ins for High Tea- and we arrived early. Such an beautiful hotel with collonades and lazy fans. We explored the Writer’s Bar and the spied the famous Singapore Sling. It was Christmas, so the hotel was adorned with tinsel and mistletoe.

The High Tea was pricey, as one would expect. To be honest, I thought the price went towards the novelty of the experience, rather than the food itself.

Western delights like cucumber sandwiches and curried egg were a highlight. Assorted traditional teas, both iced and hot, to refresh any guest. The real winner for me was the selection of Asian morsels- tasty dim sims, dumplings among the like. The English cakes such as fruit cake, madelines, citrus tarts and praline slices were proclaimed “just right” by my partner.

Book ahead and go for the experience."
Bit expensive - but it was for a birthday treat!,"We went to celebrate a 60th. birthday as a special treat.

This was actually for the North Indian Buffet, not morning tea.

Plenty of choice and as much naan bread as you wanted freshly cooked.

Lovely ambience with very attentive staff.

Would I do it again? No, I don't think so. I got the impression that time was limited as they started to re-arrange the tables for afternoon tea."
Fantastic afternoon tea,"Great afternoon - on first impressions thought this might be a bit too stuffy as our party were 2 couples & 4 kids aged 9 to 14, but we all had s fantastic time. Service was really good & food was amazing. Only minor fault- would have preferred a vegetarian hot item on the buffet. There was a veggie dim sum but not anything else - good selection in the sandwiches."
A Lovely High Tea in beautiful surroundings,"I loved everything about the high tea experience at Raffles. The staff were attentive and the food was lovely. Drinks here are quite expensive, with 2 Singapore Sling cocktails and 2 glasses of champagne costing $128. The Tiffin room is beautiful and the sweet and savoury foods were delicious."
