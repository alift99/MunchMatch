Outstanding!,Just had the most fabulous dinner at Pangium. The food was sublime and the location amazingly enchanting. But it was the service that left such an indelible impression on us. It was totally professional and yet friendly and personable. Helen and Nelson were outstanding and Eve ry single member of the team was truly impressive. Definitely will be returning. Congratulations to all the team. Thanks again for a very enjoyable experience.
"Good Value Nyonya Food, experience could be better","Pre-ordered for pick up because delivery slots were full.
Was informed that Chap Chye was not ready at the time of pick up and had to settle for another dish instead.
Overall would say variety of dishes are value for money, but taste, quality and overall experience was found wanting.
Had a better experience with their set meals, must say ala carte not the forte here."
Authentic Nyonya Food,"Food wise is good, but the waiter Ah John is pretty bad be aware of his silly jokes n don’t tip him. Tip the tomboy waitress. Average price is about $35-50 per Pax. Try the soup bakwan kepitin and eat ur rice with the gravies it’s a melody in mouth!"
Unpleasant time,"That night we were there to celebrate a family member's birthday. There was a big group of men who occupied several tables right in the centre of the restaurant. The group was very very loud, so much so it was difficult to hold a conversation during most part of our meal since we could hardly hear one another. I wish a restaurant staff had forewarned me about this big group they were having & given me the option to chg/cancel my reservation. Although the staff apologized for the unpleasant atmosphere but damage was done.
Thankfully we were not there to entertain overseas business associates, which we have done so in the past. This incident made us wonder if we will want to consider Peramakan for entertaining our guests in future."
"Nice dishes, but rice remains low quality with some bits under cooked","Dishes are authentically cooked and flavourful, albeit on the expensive side. Disappointed by the poor quality white rice served, that had bits under cooked. In Peranakan dishes where it is typically full of sauce and with strong flavours, pairing it with good quality premium white rice will enhance the dining experience. The waiter serving us was very polite and took our feedback in stride. Hope you can improve on your rice quality."
Simply delicodel,"Tucked inside the Keppel Club (country resort) is this restaurant that sells peranakan cuisine.
Being fans, we ordered most of our favorite Nyonya dishes. Here's what we thought about their food:
- Beef rendang: A+ as the meat is tender and melts in your mouth
- Chicken buah keluak: A
- Bakwan kepiting: A
- Pork pongtay: A
- Nyonya tauhu: A
- Nyonya pork ribs: A
- Chendol: A+ creamy and not too sweet. Simply delicious"
"Reasonable CNY prices but lift broker down,",Food and served good. Didn’t overcharge despite CNY. Unfortunately only 1 lift to restaurant and it malfunctioned due to fire drill. Stairs not viable for elderly. Dark windy and slippery.
Yummy!,"I went there one week before Chinese New Year Celebration in Jan 2020. It's my first time and I had a chance to try many delicious dishes. The drink that I suggested was Honey-Lime-Aloe Vera. It's very good for heath; not too sweet, a bit sour together with chunky aloe vera jelly for chewing. Another one was a special menu named ""Yee Sang or Yusheng"". It's raw fish salad which is unique menu for Chinese New Year, symbol of prosperity, and can be found only in Singapore and Malaysia. I highly recommend!"
Homely and Delicious,"Very good and honest peranakan food, with a touch of home. Will definitely return to try the other half of dishes i didnt manage to try this time round. Picks include the lamb rendang, babi pontay, ayam buah keluak and sambal kangkong. The dessert durian pengat was very good too."
Love the food and service,The food was fantastic - taste pretty close to my great grandma’s cooking .. Remy took very good care of us and service by her was fantastic !
Homely Peranakan cuisine,"Friendly service. We ordered set dinner. Serving portion was big. Enjoyed the Otak, pork ribs & desserts. Spoilt with choices."
Good food with cosy environment,"We love the food and so is our guest from Netherlands. The environment is quiet and cosy, suitable for both families and business."
night out with friends,fantastic food and service! free flow of rice. dessert was superb! great ambience with authentic peranakan food.
Delightful,Very good service. Generous portions. However be sure to check the level of spiciness before you order. Some dishes were too spicy and hot for those not accustomed to local tastebuds levels.
Delicious food!,"Visited a few weeks ago for lunch. It was mid week so not busy. Decor is nothing to shout about but service was generally good and food was of a high standard. We ordered a number of mains and then had desserts - way too much food but worth the calories. I really liked the ngoh hiang, otak and sambal chilli. The most memorable dessert was the banana apom which apparently is pretty rare to find. The durian pengat was delicious as well. We left very satisfied customers!"
Lovely comforting food,"Peramakan rarely fails to delight. The Ayam Buah Keluak came with generous pieces of chicken in a rich and sumptuous gravy. Two buah keluak nuts are all you get though, but more can be ordered. We also had the sambal fish which surpassed all our expectations. The flavor was subtle with hints of belachan and well-balanced with the sweetness of onions and the sour contrast of tomatoes. The Chap Chye and Ladies Finger dishes were good. Nothing spectacular, but hearty Peranakan favorites. The only thing that marred our dining experience was the ngoh hiang, which really was rather disappointing. But we ended on a high note with dessert - apom berkuah and durian pengat! Yum. Service was also excellent!"
Beef Rendang or Assam Beef?,The dishes were good except for the beef rendang which tasted more like assam beef. There was hardly any coconut taste; maybe not enough kerisik & too much assam?
Unforgettable,"My friends and I travelled to Singapore from Australia for a holiday. All of us foodies, we were told we couldn’t miss Permakan, and we weren’t disappointed.

You don’t get nonya food like this in Australia - Assam fish, black nut chicken and the most tender rendang ever! Not to mention their insanely perfect kuehs and desserts!

Thanks for treating us like family and making us feel at home. This is a meal I won’t forget!"
Great genuine peranakan cuisine at affordable prices,"Came with a group of 10 and ordered the dinner set menu for 8 as well as some other vegetarian dishes as well as some red wine. We had the ayam buah keluak (recommend it!), lamb rendang (very generous portion, very soft and tender), itek tim, Babi Pongteh, Sambal kangkong, a plate of large and yummy Otak Otak and Assam fish as well as vegetarian (one of us strictly vegetarian) servings of “Ayam” kleo, sambal bendi goreng, petai “prawns”, and nonya tahu.
We also had a bottle of house wine and another that we brought along.
For dessert we had durian chendol, chendol and burbur cha cha.
All delicious and we left feeling full, satisfied and very sated.
Remember to bring your OCBC credit card as you can get a discount.
In the end we paid $443 for 10 people eating all the above with wine and good conversation in a quiet corner. It was well worth it!"
Good Peranakan food,"I do not know how Peramakan compares with similar cuisines in east but over in west side, it is one of the better ones."
Set menu portions are very generous!,Very consistent standard of foods through the years. We were filled to the brim even before the last dish and desserts. The durian pengat was GOOD!
Awesome Peranakan Food and Excellent Service,The food was awesome and the service was excellent. Definitely a must-go and must-have Peranakan food place to be at! Service was excellent and the group photo taken was splendid. Food was just simply amazing and mind blowing.
Returned visit,Standard of this once famous Peranakan restaurant has dropped. Service is also slow and inadequate with many foreign workers who doesn’t know the food employed. Food taste in quality I find has also gone below my previous experiences. The soup of fish maw is no different to a fish and meat balls soup. Terribly disappointing and served slightly warm.
Average,The food served tastes quite similarly to Peranakan cuisine. But the dishes aren’t served piping hot. The service staffs are friendly though!
Pretty Disappointed & Felt Cheated!,"Had dinner with some overseas friends recently and was pretty disappointed with their service and food.There were only 6 of us, ordered 5 drinks and they left out one. We even had to asked for 2 simple napkins as there was only 4 laid out.
The worst thing is that the food served was nothing like what was shown in their menu or website! The only thing, that is accurate in the menu is the price that we have to pay! I wonder if we have any recourse for this misrepresentation!"
Good authentic Peranakan food,Our family always enjoyed eating here. We have been inviting our friends and everyone loves the food. We have tried different dishes and it never disappoints us. Service was always good. Highly recommended!
Outstanding,"Superb Peranakan food with far more than the usual vegetarian options that allowed the vegetarian I was with to really experience the flavour of Ayam Kleo.
Good service, delicious food and interesting location in the weird colonial Keppel Club which is worth a visit in its own right."
Good Peranakan food at a reasonable price.,"Peramakan has a somewhat plain dining room and a small, but representative menu offering good Peranakan food. We selected a range of dishes including spicy chicken, beef rendang, pork and fish with garlic and oyster sauces which; all were enjoyable. Excellent local beer was the beverage of choice. The staff were attentive and the prices reasonable.
."
Horrible nonya food. Waste of calories!,"The food here used to be really good - genuine and tasty. But the standard has come down a lot... very sad. Will not be returning.

The belijio crackers and chilli were already sitting on the tables in the restaurant; not a hygienic practice.

We had the ayam kleo... too salty, no depth of flavor from the spices. Same goes for the sambal ladyfingers. The chendol is very average too.

Very disappointing... waste of calories"
"Good food, service too intrusive.","Food was very good and excellent value. Seafood is fresh. Redang was tasty and tender. Some exciting vegetarian options on the menu too. If the service could be a little less intrusive towards the end of the meal, it would make it a lot more enjoyable. We hadn’t even finished our meal yet and they were trying to clear our plate before we could finish the last bites. It was as if they were trying to rush us out."
One of the best peranakan restaurants in singapore,"If you are in the mood for nyona food, this is one of the best. All the foods have authentic flavours. The chicken in soya sauce with the nuts is probably one of the best.

They also have durian pengkat which is done very nicely.

Highly recommended."
"Great food, nice environment","The quality of the food is excellent. I have dine here a few times and they really maintain their standards. Service was great as well. The location might be a bit tricky if you are not driving, but you can always take a cab if you are visiting this place. I would highly recommend the ayam buah keluak, babi ponteh, and beef rendang. You can't go wrong with these dishes."
Ambience is nice and quiet for either family or friends get/ together. The only setback is the location is not,"Convenient. We are spoilt for Choice as There is a wide variety of food. Service staff are polite, efficient and attentive even though the restaurant is packed. Staff are able to recommend the restaurant signature dishes."
Nice environment and authetic food,This is our 3rd time visiting peramakan restaurant. It is an authetic peranankan restaurant with delicious food.
Goodt food but hope to try actual menu,Goodt food but hope to try actual menu next time.Table location was a bit obscure next to servie pantry/bar and entry to toilet. Hope I don't have such a able next time
Best authentic Peranakan food,All the favourites dishes can be found here and cooked in the traditional way of the Peranakan culture. Prices are very reasonable
Authentic Asian/peranakan food!,"Food was simply awesome,especially the desserts!Chendol ftw forever. besides that beef rendang,ikan curry were tasty too highly recommended!"
Homely Peranakan Food,Peramakan has always been our go to place for peranakan food as their dishes are very nicely done. We had a good dinner with our relatives as it was the 3rd day of Lunar New Year and was fortunate that it was open for business. Staff were all very friendly and attentive.
Authentic Peranakan cuisine,One of the most if not the most authentic and classic Peranakan cuisine around. Simple cooked for enjoyment with family and friends. Will be back time and time again for sure
A Feast of Nyonya Cuisine!,"Maybe it was Chinese New Year special cuisine but our host just went over board to treat us to a complete feast of different Nyonya dishes. We particularly enjoyed the Chicken Ayam Kleo and the Ayam Buak Keluak, the Pork Babi Pongtay & Nyonya Ngoh Hiang, the lamb shank rendang was delicious, as were the Nyonya Curry Fish and the seafood Otak Otak (reminded us of sheek kebabs) had an light spice definitive different flavour. The vegetable Nyonya Chap Chye was excellent and the Apam Berkuah was a lightly sweet idli like new dessert which we tried. All in all a terrific feast of Nyonya cuisine."
"Good food, bit out of the way","Went on a recommendation from the Lonely Planet. It was good if not spectacular food and a chance to try Perankan cuisine, as the L.P. suggested. It’s also tricky to get to, upstairs at a swanky golf club at the end of a long drive, so would recommend taking a taxi."
Poor customer service,waiters spilt drinks over my mother in law not once but twice! they sems to be in a rush while clearing the plates and don't seem to be apologetic. anyway the restaurant wasn't packed so there's no reason to rush !! food was ok not fantastic.. definitely is our first and last time going there!
Cosy venue for family dinners,Reservation via Chope app was fuss free. We ordered their 10 pax set meal and all of us enjoyed the food!
PeraMakan (Keppel Club),We manage to have a table at PeraMakan (Keppel Club). Ambience was good. Very cosy and comfortable. Food was served very fast!
It's ok... but out of the way.,"Average. Not at all busy on a Monday night. Food is served lukewarm (or the aircon is really strong in the dining room).

Traditional dishes served with rice so quite rich. Desserts were ok. Kind of underwhelmed and would not return. Good value though, around $200 for 6."
Paranankan dinner CRAVING killer,"OMG always sooo delicious and giving the taste of Paranankan after sooo many years. THANK YOU. Balualah, petal, otak, lady finger..... and Must Have durian chendol."
Good food,Food was good and very kind of them not to have corkage charge. Recommended and happy to be there. Please also consider
It was better in the past,"Ate here many times in the past & enjoyed it. This time, however, was a disappointment; not sure what happened.
The Nyonya Chap Chye was not even as good as a similar dish from an economical rice stall. The fish in the Ikan Masak Kuah Nanas didn't taste fresh. What's worse was that the dish was also quite tasteless.
The only redeeming dish we had was the Ayam Sio where the chicken was tender & tasty."
Benchmark,"This is my go to place for Nonya food, cooking is consistent for many years. House wine by the bottle was surprisingly cheap. Good place to bring overseas guest to try local fare."
Great Food,We haven’t been back in a while and we were surprise at the standard of the food. It was amazing! Currently the best peranakan food in singapore.
Always Satisfying!,"This was our third visit to this establishment in about 5 years. We started with a pretty flavourful Bakwan Kepiting, followed by the really delicious whole shank Lamb Rendang. Tried the Nyonya Pork Ribs for the first time and it did not disappoint. In addition, we had a generously plump baked Otak Otak and the Sambal Terung was very well grilled, tasty and not too oily. Ended the meal with an enjoyable Bubor Cha Cha, Apom Berkuah combo. Not the most affordable Peranakan food around but always satisfying."
Average food,"Average food for penarakan standard. there are many better one with reasonable price. Ambient is good no doubt, but again for the restaurant food is important."
Nice ambience and reasonable price,This is my first time trying out at this place. The food is delicious and the ambience is good. We enjoyed our dinner. Good for family gathering.
"Excellent Food, Ample parking, Friendly staff","Shiok Sekali. Sedap Sekali. An excellent place to eat PERANAKAN FOOD. I am a baba and if I can vouch for this, YOU KNOW it’s SEDAP SEKALI!"
Authentic peranakan food,Is difficult to get authentic peranakan food with quality and price. Recommend - Ayam Buah Keluak - Desserts - Udang Goreng Assam
good food with reasonable price,"The dishes looked heavy but tasted good. Ordered ayam (chicken) buah kelauk and beef rendang, both were tender (the beef was a little spicy but tolerable, the chicken was not spicy). We also had spring rolls, which are different from the usual Chinese spring rolls and tasted good too -- a delightful change from meat dishes. The durian cendol has a dollop of durian meat on it and was less impressive to me (still good), perhaps durian pengat could be a better choice. Overall we enjoyed all the dishes we ordered."
Nice food,Nice place with nice food. The service is good and staff was attentive as they recooked our dish when they realised they forgotten that we ordered non-spicy dish.
Excellent Peranakan food,"We were there to introduce our friends to Peranakan food We ordered the Ayam Buah Keluak which is something very Peranakan The beef rendang was tender and the gravy thick and the spices well blended Overall, we enjoyed all the dishes we ordered"
Good food and reasonable prices,"My dad likes the food here and he is usually very critical, so I'm really glad I've found a restaurant to his liking. Really takes a lot of guesswork out of meals! The prices are a little high but only because it is a mid range restaurant. There are vegetarion options too. The waiters are friendly and attentive."
Lunch,Great food great place best place to entertain business lunches. Authentic Peranakan food no where is as tasty
"Excellent food, excellent service",staff was courteous and friendly. service was very prompt. we ordered 7 dishes (including dessert) and we are done with our dinner in less than 1 hour. Food is good and reasonably priced. the appetizer (crackers with acar) is a bit overpriced at sgd6 per plate. all dishes up to my expectation. good job peramakan.
Peramakan,"The food and service was very good. The Beef Rendang (signature dish) was particularly good. The service was attentive, quick and friendly. The price was not too low but I would say it was reasonable value for money."
Traditionally appealing,"Whenever I think of good Peranakan dishes, Peramakan is the go to restaurant. I've been patronizing this outlet for many years, and the staple dishes are consistently good."
Good Peranakan food,This is a nice friendly place to go for decent Peranakan food at reasonable prices. The staple dishes are consistently good.
Good Spread and quality of Perankan Food,Good Spread of Perankan Food and the quality of the food is good. I enjoyed the food and desserts were just as good too. Will highly recommend this place.
My Favourite Peranakan Restaurant,"We had Sunday lunch at PeraMakan with family and friends. 5 Adults. The food was good, portions were large and the servers were friendly. It was a pleasant restaurant for eating and chatting, with the tables well spaced-out and a nice ambient noise level. I especially liked the soups, the lamb rendang, babi pongteh and the desserts. Highlight of the day for me was the durian chendol. Yum!"
Great servings and generous portions,"Ordered the set for 8 and it could easily feed 12! Extremely generous portions of authentic peranakan food. Service staff also let us swop some items in the set menu out for whatever else we fancied. Too bad they didn't have the durian puffs, but the durian purée was a clear winner and the best dessert would have been the banana pancakes (I don't even like bananas). Service was attentive and prompt. Definitely recommended for families!"
Decent Peranakan food at reasonable prices,"Had an enjoyable meal at Peramakan. Among the staple favorites we ordered, the ngo hiang, lamb rendang & Durian Chendol stood out. Portions are generous
The club house interiors has a non pretentious relaxed feel, & service is friendly.
Recommended, except it's in an out of the way location in Keppel Club, near Vivo city"
Quality Food with Service,"Food order:
Lamb shank rendang - decent but I prefer the beef rendang we had the previous visit
BBQ fish - star of the lunch. Fish is fresh, tender with delicious spicy sauce
Beancurd with seafood - ok. Would be better if they used homemade toufu.
Kangkong - good but most restaurants do a decent of this dish anyway."
Not bad actually,I'm not a peranakan to judge the food. But overall I'm happy with the type of food and flavour. Service staffs are friendly too.
Enjoyable experience,"We brought overseas friends to introduce peranakan food.
Food was great and dishes were served promptly.
Service was friendly and very accommodating.
Unfortunately, we were ""upsold"" and ended up with too many dishes. Wished someone would tell us if there are sufficient or too many dishes.
Overall a good experience."
Lovely Place,We all enjoyed the tender chicken and buah keluak and unique cincarok omelette and the eggplant dish.
Authentic Peranakan Food,"If anyone wants to taste authentic Peranakan food then this restaurant is a must! Fast service with friendly staffs to take care of all your needs. The place is convenient to reach if you drive, if you are taking public transport then be prepared to walk all the way to the Keppel Club."
A hidden gem ... from Keppel expanding into Food courts,"From an exclusive club to expanding their business into exclusive food republic chains making their delicious Peranakan food more accessible to most diners. At Vivo @ food republic. A plate of main course or dish regardless of whether it's pork, chicken or beef is $7.80 including 2 sides. If u r heading to Vivo. Check it out & u won't be disappointed.

On a little walk to city square for desserts. We also found Kathryn HO, owner n executive Chef on duty at their first ever dessert stall. Training her staff. We were delighted personally make the rojak for us. Chendol, bubor char char were very good."
Peranakan restaurant,"When in Singapore, you must try at least one peranakan restaurant - this one is a good bet. Located at the Keppel Club, so you need a reservation. Excellent service and food. Must try the Ayam Buah Keluak - a unique chicken curry with black nuts."
Vegetarian Peranakan Dishes With A Heart !,"Never expect to find such fantastic vegetarian Peranakan food so heartily prepared within Keppel Golf Club opposite Sentosa in suburb Singapore !

Its ""buah keras"" (candlenuts) mock chicken curry and 'beef' rendang are amongst the very best..

Typical Peranakan desserts are just classic along with most non-vegetarian dishes too.

The restaurant is well designed, spacious and comfortable catering for big family gatherings, with quality customer service at reasonable charges."
Wholesome Peranakan food,"Peramakan has always been able to deliver at very consistent and high level for its food.
You don't feel that the food was mass produced and more importantly they are delivered to you at the right temperature. Most of the Nonya restaurants tend to pre-cook and upon order, heat it and gives a finishing touch.
Ayam Buah Keluak was excellent, petai bring perfectly executed, chap chye was nice and the finale - appoom with banana purée was heavenly.
Service was friendly and competent though tends to be rough.
I look forward to be back..... very soon."
Generous food portions,"We celebrated a friend's birthday at Peramakan @ Keppel Club. We ordered the set menu for 8 and found that the portions were really generous. In fact, we had to pack some of the food to take home. We loved the beef rendang, braised pork ribs and otak otak. However, we do have one suggestion for the set menu. Except for the chap chye, the rest were all meat and fish dishes. It would be great if there are one or two more vegetable dishes for a more balanced meal. For dessert, the apom berkuah and bubor cha cha were delightful. Sadly, the place looks quite worn and the ladies' toilet was out of order. I wonder what Peramakan's plans are when the Club's lease expires."
"Not great makan, but Peramakan is good value peranakan","You don't have to be a member of Keppel Club to dine at PeraMakan. The food is good,but it is not the most delicious or refined nonya restaurant in town - more like honest home cooking. The decor is dated - 70's style. Service is attentive. Compared to more upmarket Peranakan restaurants, it's good value, although the very steep parking fee eats up the saving!"
"Meagre portions, hardly filled us up","REVIEW ON TINGKAT PERAMAKAN, OWEN RD.
Date of visit: 26 Feb 2017

My family of 6 visited the latest addition to the Peramakan chain at Owen Rd for dinner. Before we visited the restaurant, my wife recce-ed the place, and looked up the prices. Seems fair - averaging around $8-10 per item. It was my first experience with Peramakan, and I have heard good reviews about the food, so decided to give it a try. I was worried about the prices as I have heard friends who ate at the chain talking about how expensive the food was. Nonetheless, decided to give it a go!

So we went in, and ordered a few items off the menu. We checked with the waitress and she told us each order is good to feed 2-3 pax. Hence, with the 6 of us, we decided to order 2 portions of each dish so that there was sufficient to go around.

So starting from the top left item in a clockwise fashion, we ordered:
2 X beef rendang ($10 each portiom)
2 X nyonya chap chye ($6 each portion)
2 X Penang nyonya pork ribs ($7.50 each portion)
2 X Nyonya tauhh ($7 each portion)

Alas, the food came. And the staff claimed to have combined 2 portions of each food item into a single bowl (see picture). Portions were absolutely PATHETIC! For 2 portions of tahu, there were only 4 small pieces of tofu ($14), 7 pieces of cabbage with some black fungus ($12), 4 cubes of beef ($20), 7 pieces of small pork ribs ($15). Left us barely full at the end of the meal, and hardly satisfied.

WHY TELL US EACH PORTION CAN FEED 2-3 PAX, WHEN THE TRUTH IS IT CAN PROBABLY ONLY FEED 1?!

Left the restaurant feeing disgruntled, and unsatisfied. The owners might have wanted the place to be more atas kindda restaurant, but c'mon lah - please help set your customers' expectations right at the start of the meal!"
First Visit,"My husband and myself were interested to try out Peranakan food and were glad we did. We tried the Ikan Garam Assam, Sambal Kangkong, Otak Otak Makanan Laut, Sago Gula Melaka & Durian Pengat. No regrets with any of the choices. Otah was full of flavor with handful of prawn n fish chunks.
Not forgetting the desserts, simply yummy."
Great authentic straits chinese food,If you're looking for a really authentic strait chinese food experience you're at the right place here!
Good enough,"If you craze for Peranakan food, this is a reasonable restaurant to visit. Like the beef rendang, kang kong, different forms of fish, Ayam Buah Keluak, pickles/ajar. Chap Chye is so so. The environment is very pleasant and parking is easy. May not be top, price is a little above average but generally quality of food is consistent and good. Service is also good."
Always delivering good quality food & service always awesome,"The day I returned to Singapore having spent 3 weeks away in London just for foods, EPL & musicals. I decided to find out the new joint that was set up by the same PeraMakan group @ Keppel Club.

The frontage was excellent n surely the display of their signature Kueh Kueh, bak Chang, bringing out now the lunar new year delicacies were mouth watering.

The main barie consists of many varieties of their signature dishes not to be missed. Chap chai, beef rednang is so tempting,

At $7.80, a generous piece of chicken Maryland, n two side dishes. I decided to add long beans n lady fingers. It was simply beautiful, nice meat cut n chicken was so delicious that melts in the mouth. Long beans were not overcooked, it was crunchy. Lady fingers were fried with a touch of sambal that makes it so so yummy.

Accompanying my plate of delicious meal was a generous serving of sambal belchan.

Service wasn't like second to none. Cheryl from the n group managed the stall with a beautiful smile. Very friendly staff.

It was so good that I invited 4 of my friends to lunch with me again @ PeraMakan next week.

Keep up the good work."
The best Peranakan restaurant in Singapore.....so far,"My family and I are big fans of Peranakan food, having experienced the wide range of Asian cuisine, from the Philippines to Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Throughout our expat travels, Peranakan food kept grabbing our attention and is now amongst our top cuisines, though we love the wide range of offerings of Asia and the world.

We had regularly gone to a more tourist-known Peranakan restaurant downtown. But recently my wife ran into some Peranakan ladies in Singapore who recommended PeraMakan and we had also tried and loved the PeraMakan outlet at Tangs. So when our daughters who live in North America came to spend the year-end holidays with us, we decided to do our Peranakan dinner at the PeraMakan restaurant at Keppel Club.

First of all, it's a bit tucked away at the Keppel Club, so not easy to get to if you don't drive a car. Secondly, because of prior engagements that day, we could only get there at 8:30pm and that was the time of our reservation. But last orders were at 9pm, so the whole meal was a bit rushed.

Nevertheless, the waiters were understanding and flexible, and we were able to quietly choose the dishes we wanted and sit back and enjoy the whole meal. We ordered the Beef Rendang, Ayam Sio, Mee Siam, Ikan Caram Assam and Chap Chay. We accompanied this with their Achar and a nice bottle of wine. The stars of the night were the Beef Rendang and the Ayam Sio, but we loved the Achar and the other dishes, too.

We ended the night with some Sago Gula Melaka and Chendol to cleanse our palates, and these were pretty good.

A great experience."
Family dinner,"They only have set menu for 8 and up, so 6 of us ordered a la carte. Otdered the usual - otak, omelette, fried fish, chicken buah keluak , chap chye. All were ok and neither excellent nor bad"
Not worth for the price,The portion for each dish is too small for 4 pax. They should have pre-alert us to order double. Also I don't think the food are fantastic. Not worth a try.
Authentic Peranakan (Nyonya) Dishes,"A very conducive environment with beautiful Peranakan decor. The food is great, serving real Peranakan dishes whose history dates back to old colonial times."
Amazing quality peranakan cuisine,"We were lucky enough to celebrate the wife's half-century here with close friends just recently. It was my first time at the restaurant and I had trepidations as the booking was made from overseas (we're not locals). But most of the online reviews were positive, so I dived in. Luckily, the experience lived up to expectations. The quality of the food was exceptional. Service tended to be hit and miss, but I could excuse that. Everybody left with a satisfied tummy after dinner."
Honest Peranakan Food,"Its not in the center of town, the decor is nothing that special but all this does not diminish the popularity of this restaurant. The food is good honest home cooking styled Peranakan food. The Ayam Buah Keluak is particularly good with the restaurant providing spoons to scoop out the goodness !"
Standards have dropped,"This was my 3rd visit there and somehow I didn't experience the 'wow' factor which I previously was used too.

The saving grace about this restaurant is the friendly service. My friends and I ordered the Assam fish dish and we felt that somehow it didn't taste right. When we gave feedback, they were quick to offer a replacement dish. When the order arrived, it was cooked and served by the owner herself, who profusely apologised for the error. The main reason was that the Chef was new and still in training.

I haven't been back since and hopefully the Chef has since honed his skills."
Good Peranakan Food,"Reasonably good Peranakan Food: Ayam Buah keluak was good but a little sweet, the buah keluak taste did not come through strongly. Also the contents in the nut was too finely minced. I would prefer it more coarsely chopped, Bakwan kepiting - not really outstanding, did not get the crab taste in the meat. But the soup was well done and very flavourful. Nangka masak lemak - flavourful and good. Ngoh Hiang - love this dish. crispy on the outside and meaty texture on the inside. For desert we had durian pengat - This was the highlight of the day. Very well done with strong durian flavor. Overall food was good and authentic but a little pricey.
Service level needs to be improved: They appeared a little shorthanded and overwhelmed. A couple of waiters appeared inexperienced and could not respond to simple queries. I had to approach 2 waiters and walked to the cashier counter twice to settle my bill. Apparently only one staff was handling cashier and bar counter functions.
I had dine there before and the service level was much better then."
Standards have dropped,"This was a favourite for authentic Peranakan food. Somehow this recent visit was a bit of a disappointment.
The set lunch menu is reasonably priced with all the usual favourites. The fish assam was good with very fresh fish and the right tanginess of assam. The chicken in the buah keluak dish was a little dry and the beef rendang was not as flavoursome. Chap Chye was delicious and a healthy dish. The otak otak was a generous serving and quite delicious.
White rice complements Peranakan food but here, it was somewhat sticky and slightly soggy.
Desserts used to be our favourite in Peramakan but this time, only the durian pengat impressed. The apom berkuah sauce was not thick enough; the durian Chendol had a lump of durian purée that didn't mix well with the whole drink.
Service was not up to the usual standard too. They were slow and forgot two of our orders."
Absolutely Authentic and Marvellously Tasty,"If you do have money to spare, then come for this top class Peranakan cuisine, which serves almost all the usual famous Peranakan dishes.
Excellent service, and portions which guarantee to fill you to the brim,
Preferably if you have a friend who is a member of Keppel Club, so that you can at least enjoy a 10% off the hefty (albeit, worth it) bill."
Among the best Peranakan restaurants in Singapore,"The food is certainly among the most authentic and best Peranakan food in Singapore. Located in Keppel Club, the restaurant is open to the public. The service is attentive while the setting is basic. Affordable prices;"
Nice food with pokestops,"Ordered Kang gong, fish, curry chicken, curry mutton. Loved the mutton for its soft texture, they must have slow cooked and simmered it. As we waited for the dishes, we collected items from the pokestops. The is also a gym to train Pokemons near to the car park. For dessert, the durian mousse and durian chendol were fantastic. The mousse was made from D24 durian flesh, really sweet and delicious as it is."
Very good Peramakan food,"Lovely restaurant with great food. We usually end up eating here once every two months when we're craving their delicious beef rendang. We either do take out and take the time and really sit in the restaurant for dinner.

Some recommendations: Beef rendang, Nonya Pork Ribs, and Nonya Tau Hu. We've also tried the spring rolls and they were great too.

Service is very efficient. When we call to get some takeout, the food is usually ready in 10 minutes for us to pick up.

BTW, this restaurant is located in the Keppel Club and would be best to go there by car or taxi as it's a long walk from the main road."
Really loved the food . Had a selection and everything was really delicious,"There is really a huge menu with tons of options. We even had an interesting dish made out tough wooden nuts open and fillet with a delicious sauce / Spices were very well balanced . Nice service . Friendly atmosphere. The place is located in a Golf/ Tennis club, and can accommodate really large groups. A great evening."
