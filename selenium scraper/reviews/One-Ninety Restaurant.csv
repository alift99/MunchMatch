Good breakfast- but 0.8% short from a 4-star review! (69.2%),"We stayed in the Four Seasons Hotel Singapore during our Singapore Trip 2023- and we had breakfast at the One-Ninety Restaurant for the five mornings. There was a good selection of food from the buffet- but selections wasn‚Äôt as comprehensive nor as much when compared to the Royal Plaza by Scotts/ Kempinski Hotel Singapore. Unfortunately, scrambled egg wasn‚Äôt available in the buffet counter, on the other hand you will have to order it (although quality-wise was very good). Food quality in general, was quite good especially the egg bar. The ‚Äúchef recommendation‚Äù changes everyday- sometimes congee, sometimes beef noodles, and sometimes even Kaya Toast with egg. Service in the restaurant was erratic. There was one morning where the service staff Anne said ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have tables anymore in the restaurant so you will need to wait‚Äù- and then 1 minute later a table was given to us. We do notice available tables in the restaurant that are not opened to the hotel guests. The tea inside the teapots were very mild as there was only 1 teabag inside- and shared for 2 persons! This wasn‚Äôt acceptable in a 5-star hotel- and hence we changed our drink selection to everyone getting different drinks to maximise the quantity of drinks available (but of course this doesn‚Äôt improve the mildness of the tea). Ambience in the restaurant was good- with adequate lighting and mood. Overall, some good breakfast- but service has to be improved for a higher rating to be given."
Lunch on 22 July 1pm,Restaurant is very good for business lunch as it is quiet and food is classy. Will visit restaurant again.
Beautiful memory of lunch,"The staffs were really courteous, the food was excellent. Note that you need to order the starter separately as the main buffet is primarily finger food. Nonetheless, overall a very good experience"
Great food Great Service,Very happy with the food we ordered. The services were excellent. Enjoy the dining experiences. No regret of choosing One-Ninety Restaurant. Definitely will be back.
A la Carte Luncheon,"I had the seafood bouillabaisse with a fillet of snapper and an assortment of clams, scallops, mussels, squid and prawns. Everything was acceptable except the scallops, which were over done by the time I got to them. This dish is best consumed WITHOUT indulging in a lengthy discourse. Lesson learnt - If one intends to have a very leisurely meal that is relatively long drawn, eat something else. Less criticism is accorded to the two desserts. The texture of the Anjou pear tart and macaron, and flavour of the rhubarb sorbet were exceptional."
Semi-buffet lunch with a botanical decor,"Not the first place one might think of for a buffet meal. Ambience: peaceful and surprisingly, exuded a tranquil atmosphere, in keeping the with ""botanic"" theme. Service was friendly and efficient. Chose the semi-buffet lunch option - for the price, you get unlimited helpings of starters and desserts, with the option to add on a single entree (for additional $10). Reasonable but not extravagant buffet starter and dessert options. Starters were generally salads and a couple of seafood options, and three options with meat portions. For mains, chose risotto and duck confit - both were of superior quality and portions were large. Desserts were generally of superior quality also, I would say a cut above most buffet options. Coffee and tea included.
Slightly annoying that we were served and charged for ""alkaline water"" without being informed about the additional charges. Buyer beware."
Lunch Meeting,"Was there with a colleague to catch up on some office matters. It worked out very well and very pleased with the attention given by serving staff and assistant manager. Great job, folks!"
One of my favourite restaurants!,Always a delight to dine in One-Ninety Restaurant. It's a steal to have semi-buffet lunch at S$38++ in a beautiful environment with impeccable service. Definitely my good to place for brunch.
Hidden gem in Orchard,Nice ambience with elegant and cozy deco. Staff are attentive and helpful. Def a good place to dine with family or intimate friends.
A reliable international brasserie,"A personal fav, primarily in light of its convenient location, but also because of its ‚Äònot-the-best-but-very-good‚Äô food at not-outrageous prices, excellent service, and peaceful atmosphere. They recently expanded their menu. We had an excellent rendition of bouillabaisse, although most surprisingly, they don‚Äôt have a√Øoli or croutons. Marseillais guests would have to bring their own."
Great dining experience,"Absolutely love the food quality, selection and service The ambience is exceptional as well Will come back again in the future."
Excellent Food and Service,We had a really lovely memorable dinner. We chose to have the set menu as it had a wide variety of menu items to choose from and it definitely did not disappoint. The food quality and preparation was 5 star and absolutely delicious. Chef De Cuisine Pierre Barusta and his staff made our dinner celebration an event we would like to repeat soon.
Relaxing Brunch üòä,Visited the restaurant for their Sunday Brunch. They have attentive and friendly staff. Love how they still allow us to head over to their station to chose the buffet items instead of waiting at your table for them to serve to you. Their Wagyu steak was yummy !!
Service and Food Quality at its BEST !,"Staff friendliness, attentiveness, professionalism stood out.
Due to Covid, food selection (although Semi Buffet) was reduced, regardless the food served during semi buffet lunch is enough to fill your stomach.
Food quality is of a 5-Star hotel standard, food was fresh, seasoned to taste. Desserts were amazing.
We started lunch at 12pm and finished at 3pm (no limit to time per seating).
Totally recommend this restaurant to everyone looking for a relaxing time, catching up with loved ones or friends over lunch."
Astonishing high tea,"It quite a wonderful hightea that we had with my friend. The food is great, especially the peranakan curry. Also must give credit to YY and Ying with their exquisite service."
Love the salad and dessert buffet!,"Brought my mum for lunch at One-Ninety. Was pleasantly surprised by the quality spread at the buffet with a variety of desserts, salads, cheeses and bite-sized mains to choose from. We opted for the semi-lunch buffet with a main course which came with a soup of the day.
(+) Desserts were excellent; the canel√©s, bread & butter pudding and almond cherry tart were my favourites
(+) For the savory items, the grilled asparagus, tom yum chicken balls and Tzatziki dip stood out

Overall, a pleasant dining experience with warm service and quality dishes. Would definitely return for the buffet itself!"
Fancy cosy space for breakfast with great service,Had breakfast here as in-house guest and everything was great - great quality and quantity (big portion alert!) complete with great service and on judgements for my slight wastage of food.
Wonderful Service,"The service here was excellent from start to finish. The senior lady staff was friendly and efficient, and she and the chef helped to check which dishes had buckwheat/soba, which my wife is allergic to.

While not having a wide variety as before, the semi-buffet appetizers were good, and I especially loved the cold salmon, the Thai duck salad and the pate. The char kway teow had a nice hit of wok hei and was tasty - it was a little on the sweet side and a little bit of spice would have elevated the dish. The squid ink pasta with crab was just okay. The crab meat was fresh, but the entire dish was bland, so much so that I had to add salt and pepper, something which I rarely do. Portions were generous.

Dessert was also pretty good, though the ondeh ondeh had too much brown sugar and was overly sweet. The signature chocolate cookie and the lime meringue tart were pretty good."
Memorable night time !,"I wish to show my appreciation to the service staff.. they were all nice professional and very attentive! We dined at the main restaurant first and I wish to particularly to commend the Chinese guy who served us, I regret I didn‚Äôt check for his name, pls find out and let him know that he made us feel very welcomed and also he surprised us with the red velvet cake!! It was executed so professionally but yet sincerely! Lastly we also enjoyed the drinks and ambiance at the bar. Also send our appreciation to the Filipino guy who recommended us the drinks! It was Perfect!"
Sunday Lunch well done!,"Getting fed up with resto asking you to leave after 1.5hrs. Found One-Ninety lunch hours from 12-3pm. Called and the lady was very pleasant told me we can sit there from 12-3pm. Such a nice experience of lunch ""buffet"" for a change. They actually do have a station filled with nice salad, burrata cheese, dessert and laksa! On top of that, you can order 1 main course which is of generous serving and quality is very good! My gfs have Duck Confit which are cook to perfection, I'd Fish which is well done. Each of us have a bottled of nice warm water so you don't have to keep troubling waitress to fill up. Also comes with coffee or good selection of tea! 4 of us sat there till 330pm. Service is very good. I will be back again!"
Neat and cosy,"Had a staycation in four season hotel and took 2 days of breakfast at one ninety. Restaurant is neat, cosy and classy. Variety of breakfast not a lot but acceptable. Taste of food is average as per restaurant standards. Staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful."
Good ambience and service,"Semi buffet during COVID-19, variety of the food is not much but the quality is still good, service is good with minimum stuff only, atmosphere is perfect."
Reliable coffee shop.,"Reliable coffee shop. Nothing extraordinary about the food, but prices are generally reasonable. The semi-buffet is kind of boring, but fresh and healthy. Friendly service staff."
Terrible Food... Tasteless!,"The selection of cheeses was deplorable, the food was absolutely tasteless, the pork tasted like raw protein... why did I even bother going? Waste of money."
"Nice ambience, great service and food .",Our first time visiting the restaurant great entree selection and thanks Simon for the excellent service. Thanks for the service rendered and the birthday cake. Ambience of the restaurant was pretty.
Excellent value - need to sort the service a bit,"Set lunch is ne of the best valuers in Singapore - as long as you avoid things like the bottle of sparkling water at $12 of course. We topped up for the steak option which was excellent. There was a lot of food and very good quality - including good cheese with nuts, quince jelly etc. Classy.
The waiters seemed confused/clueless on what order to bring the food. You choose salad first and the waiter was about to bring our main course at the same time - we said no wait. Then soup came which we didn't expect - followed of course by the main course 1 minute after, so the soup was abandoned - we are not doing a picnic...... These are simple things that would improve the experience to make it excellent.
Next time I will give them instructions on how to serve the food - but we will go back, it was very good nonetheless."
relax and enjoyable lunch,always a good selection of food spread for the semi-buffet lunch. the restaurant dining atmosphere is excellent. good value for money.
Great variety of food,"Excellent variety of food on the menu. The salad bar had a wide selection of fresh vegetables, meat and nuts. The Maine lobster and snapper bouillabaisse were spot on and highly recommended! The king crab tagliolini looked amazing but unfortunately it was slightly overcooked and lacked the lemon flavour. Service was average. We were served a second bottle of still water without our knowledge and were charged for it."
Delicious for a Birthday Meal. - Could be Better,"Visited for a Birthday Meal, the food was delicious and the service was as expected for the Four Seasons. A pity that the Lamb was sold out and the buffet service was incredibly limited due to covid-19. Would like to be back after all this is over so that we can enjoy the buffet again. looking forward to it."
Excellent but over crowded,We were there during the week of the Chinese New Year and thus place was crowded every morning yet service was very good and varieties of food and taste were very good.
Excellent breakfast buffets and good dinner,"Friendly staff. Excellent hot choices on comprehensive multicultural breakfast buffet: fresh juice of the day (beetroot carrot ginger), shu mai and dumplings are a favorite. Excellent quality salad ingredients, fruit, cheeses. Great breads and pastries. Dinner very good too: Wagyu burger and Chinese New Year sweet and sour pork. Very convenient while staying here; multiple birthday cake acknowledgment for one of us guests."
"Good food, great service","My family went to One-Ninety restaurant at The Four Seasons on New Year‚Äôs Day and had their semi-buffet brunch. We were delighted by the huge spread of appetisers and desserts. All the items were excellent in taste and quality. However, the choices for the main course were not very impressive and the list included a number of local dishes, such as Hor Fun, as well as breakfast items like Avocado Toast, that did not seem to justify the $98++ price.

Although the main course was disappointing, the service made up for it. My sister had informed our server that her Miso Chicken was very salty and he offered to replace it with another dish of her choice from the list, even though she had eaten at least half of the chicken. She was immensely pleased with the Ricotta Pancakes that replaced the Miso Chicken.

Overall, it was a pleasant experience that would have been even better if the choices for the main course were a little more exciting."
Great food,Absolutely loved the food and the staff. Great buffet as well. Definitely one of the better Indian restaurants in Cape Town
The average decibel level at One-Ninety barely reaches a third of 190,"This is more a brasserie than a fine-dining restaurant. However, the fantastic service, chic and peaceful atmosphere, decent food at reasonable pricing (relative to the location and atmosphere), flexible hours (it‚Äôs open 16 hours a day) make this place attractive not only to hotel guests, but also people living in the neighbourhood or folks wanting a respite from the noises of Orchard Road. At lunch, the sinful char kway teow is amazing - more yummy than at many hawker stalls even if it‚Äôs more than five times the price!"
Quiet ambience & impeccable service,Always loved One-ninety for its impeccable service & lovely ambience. Nice place to catch up with friends. Food is good quality & well spread.
No need to speed at 190 km/h to eat at 190,"Many of our friends living or working in the neighbourhood use this as their cafeteria. It‚Äôs open 16 hours a day, the √†-la-carte menu is adequately long (with both western and Asian dishes), the food is not bad, prices are more reasonable than at comparable lounges (eg. Brasserie Les Saveurs at St Regis), and service is swift. At lunch, the sinful char kway teow is amazing - more yummy than most hawker stalls in town!"
"Beautiful setting, food and service.",We ate dinner from the al a cart menu. Excellent food quality & portions sizes. Good kids menu and kids table wares. Service was outstanding and the design and set up is beautiful. We will return.
Excellent service and food,"The restaurant was amazing. The breakfast buffet had many options, including fresh fish that was wonderful."
Excellent Wedding Anniversary Dinner,"We always make it a point to come back to One Ninety @ The Four Season‚Äôs for special occasions esp wedding anniversaries. Today‚Äôs visit was yet again memorable & pleasant. The customer service at Four Seasons was highly commendable..

Starting from the phone reservation where the lady noted our first name & could tell me our full name & our last visit to One Ninety. At our dinner today, we were given a quiet corner as requested. There was full attention from the moment we entered the restaurant. Sean Chan, the manager and the Indian service staff were excellent & polite. They served with pride & dedication. They made our wedding anniversary dinner very memorable by making us comfortable & even providing an anniversary cake plus more cakes from the main table.

Atmosphere
There is always a sense of peace & calmness. After the renovation, we noted more botanicals around the entire restaurant, this increases the cosy & homely feel. Sofa was very comfy with the cushions.

The new menu
Very different menu compared with the previous. Some usual favourite day were missing (grilled salmon, fish curry). No semi buffet with the anti-pasti & salads which I will prefer still. We ordered the seafood tower which was served with liquid nitrogen and a spectacular entry to our table, was impressive with very fresh seafood and tasty sauces. The other dish that we ordered is the Nasi goreng which contains generous portion of fried rice, satays, chicken wings & keropok.

Four Seasons Hotel as it is, never fail to impress. This is still the very reason why we first selected Four Seasons for our wedding 15 years ago. Keep up the excellent job...please continue to make every encounter a wonderful experience."
Sunday Brunch is excellent,"After the relaunch, the decor is classy and welcoming - a botanical theme that is cosy and fresh. It is a semi buffet which means bread, a seafood tower and a main entree is served at the table but the salads, appetisers as well as desserts are on a buffet line. We loved it. Today's buffet line has a clear Mediterranean inspired theme in the appetisers and the charcuterie selection of parma hams and lomo iberico slices were on point. Smoked burrata, the stuffed tomatoes and dolmas were divine. We learnt not to jump to conclusions too easily by thinking that the selection was smaller than other buffets (the Line for example) as the quality of food here at One-Ninety was high. We had an impressive three- tier seafood tower and the entrees did not disappoint. Please save space for the wonderful desserts! Great job, One-Ninety! We know where to go for Sunday Brunch now. =)"
Business,"Went with bosses and colleagues. Service was good, food not bad and nice atmosphere. Good for chilling out"
Good variety of food for the price,"We enjoyed the food, the variety of food and the service given, it has been a nice dining experience for us."
Really nice lunch in what could be wrongly felt to be another hotel coffee shop,"We came expecting a standard coffee shop experience (large but boring buffet or the usual list of club sandwiches and salads). Instead, we had a very qualitative lunch, giving the flexibility of combining from a simple but fresh starters buffet and a varied menu, offering both local and more traditional options.
All main courses were delicious.
The service was equally efficient and friendly."
Excellent cuisine and service.,"After a lapse of two years, I decided to pay the restaurant a visit following its recent renovation. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food on offer. Most of the dishes were delicious and well presented especially the avocado salad, and the sea food tower. Service was top notch."
One of my favourites in Singapore,"A very nice restaurant, located in Four Seasons Hotel with one of the greatest breakfasts ever, but also a perfect a la carte menu. The staff is more than lovely, so I tried it several times while I was there."
Excellent food and service,"This was the perfect sanctuary after an evening check-in at the Four Seasons. All the staff were genuinely friendly and, even though dining alone (business travel is not all it is cracked up to be) on a weeknight, I was made to feel most welcome."
Great Sunday brunch,"Celebrated my son‚Äôs birthday there this afternoon. The Sunday brunch is a semi buffet. The spread is great ... love the sushi and salad. We also ordered our mains (a choice of fish, chicken, beef and mussels ... there are also Asian cuisine to choose from) and the Seafood Tower. All in all, great food and fantastic service."
All in Good,"We are not buffet people but all my family and friends whom we recommended this restaurant enjoy it and revisit the restaurant again and again. The food is not like ‚Äúnormal‚Äù buffet full of hot meats but with very quality white cold meat and vegetables, which attract us. Cheese and desserts are also very nice. We always feel very satisfied and full.
Service is also a bonus to mark this restaurant excellent!"
semi buffet dinner,you choose a main course on the menu and the dessert and appetizers are buffet. the selection is intimate but its good quality. service is good too.
buffet breakfast was nice and quiet .,buffet breakfast was nice and quiet.The food options were not a lot but the quality was of high standard
Christmas Lunch,"Luckily for us we were able to secure a table for Christmas Day brunch on short notice. The kids room was a hit with our toddler, the balloon artist was one of the best we have ever seen.

The selection of food was plentiful and very tasty. There was no way anyone could have left feeling hungry. We were very pleased with our selection and would recommend."
Sensational Food,Not your typical hotel restaurant. Staff are really good. Good wine selection so it is perfect if you want to dine out close to home :-)
Lovely Lobby Restaurant in Four Seasons Hotel,"The One-Ninety Restaurant, open to the lobby, offered a wonderful breakfast buffet with a wide range of foods and beverages. The pastries changed every day and American and Asian offerings were presented. Breakfast was from 6:30 to 10:00 am, so a guest had plenty of time to sleep in and still have a nice breakfast. Wait staff very helpful and friendly."
Love the laksa,"Recommend the laksa. They have scallops, mussels and big prawns. As they say 'you get what you pay'. The service is just excellent, staffs are friendly and never in a hurry to explain anything to you, including directions to shops."
Breakfast galore,Breakfast served here will fill your stomachs and put a smile on your face. Wide variety of hot and cold dishes including a choice selection of Japanese and western favourites. Service is hard to beat.
Good birthday lunch with friend,"I went there to celebrate a friend's birthday. The main course is very delicious, but a bit small portion. The buffet line for the started and dessert is good, but not super impressive. Service and atmosphere are excellent."
"Small servings, small buffet spread","This is about their semi-buffet. Firstly, it cannot be compared with other hotel buffet spreads - it‚Äôs too small here, and nothing oriental. No soup also (!!!). As for the main course, be prepared for small portions (both the Asian and western selections). For that price, in the midst of strong competition, I‚Äôm definitely not returning.

Service is good.

{Now now, if you are in the hotel and wants a really good meal, there is a fantastic Chinese restaurant just above it.........}"
good,awesome food and ambiance provided by the restaurant. Will definitely visit again along with my friends and family
Thumbs up,"Tried the semi buffet lunch on Sat. Surprisingly, the food quality is very good and spread is definitely sufficient for a semi buffet. Was not expecting roast duck, chicken and roast meat on the table. Top up for Steak and frites - the meat is grilled perfectly to our liking. 2 rounds of coffee and tea is included in the semi buffet. Crayons and colouring paper is given to entertain my 2 yr old. Having a AMEX platinum card make the deal even sweeter! Service team is friendly and prompt. Thumbs up for our overall experience. Will be back more frequent. :)"
Average fare at high prices,"I've been here twice, for lunch & dinner at their semi-buffet. Spread was limited even for a semi-buffet, mains were average, high prices, and the price of the buffet unbelievably doesn't include coffee or tea, which the waiter informed us we had to pay for separately (but at least was trained enough to inform us at the time of order rather than us finding out at checkout). Atmosphere is elegant & each table is at a good distance from the other, perfect for a business or intimate meal. Waitstaff are unobtrusive. Still, I wish my meals there had been more fulfilling."
Probably the best breakfast buffet ive had,"Stayed at the hotel for three nights. Its probably the best breakfast buffet ive ever had. The bar, that carries the same name, also was wonderfull. Professional staff that makes you feel right at home."
Good semi buffet dinner,"Good spread with salad, cold cuts, cheese, cooked food, dessert stations. The main course completes the entire dinner experience. I love the cod fish, succulent and juicy cod fish cooked to perfection! Love it!"
Semi-Buffet Dinner,"Just tried their semi buffet dinner. I felt that some of the options on the menu are quite overpriced. So appetisers and desserts are buffet and you select an entree. First of it is split into 3 segments, Italian, Local and Western. Italian has the typical pasta fare but top up S$10 for the braised lamb shank which is tender and excellent. Local has items like Hainanese Chicken Rice, Laksa, Char Kway Teow. S$64++ for local fare is not for locals I reckon =). The western has items like spring chicken and for top up of S$32 you can go for the wagyu ribeye, Maine lobster. The buffet has the traditional appetisers like sushi, roasted duck, pork belly, salads, cheeses etc. Desserts has cakes and sweet items. A little overpriced but the service and quality of food is excellent!"
Good,Main dishes were nice. The buffets spread was little and too crowded. Area too small. Should have more space to move around
Overcook Wagyu Ribeye Steak,"We went for Sunday Brunch, and we were happy that we were able to get a reservation on the same day. As the restaurant was helm by Giovanni Speciale, we were of the impression that the good will be at least competent to great. My son order the Maine Lobster, and I order the Wagyu Ribeye steak. I ask the steak to be cook medium rare.
To my horror, the steak came out medium well on almost 2/3 of the steak. The only remaining eatable portion is between medium to medium rare. Hence the instruction given to the chef must have been correct, as I still receive 1/3 of the steak in medium rare. It is almost like eating leather on 2/3 of the steak a real disappointment on the Chef.
The Maine lobster is good, and the rest of the stuff was ok as well. But I'm wondering how can a competent chef do not know how to cook a good quality steak, so I'm giving it 2 stars."
Great food and super friendly staff,Quiet and nice environment for dinning. Good spread of main dishes and semi buffet. Staffs are friendly and fun. The environment is pretty much like a fine dinning
Quite Good,"Went for lunch. Generally good service. Quality ingredients used for buffet. We were mostly delighted. Wish they had included a soup in their buffet. Would have been perfect. Desserts appear to have been improved upon. Oh, the appetizer buffet has a significant western slant. So there were a few things I didn't bother to try as I don't like them....cheeses for example. But what remained was interesting enough. D√©cor could be ""brighter""."
Delightful lunch spot,"Pleasant and warm service. Good selection at the appetizer buffet, but unfortunately food wasn‚Äôt always replenished. Wide choice of mains and the Laksa is highly recommended- comes with succulent scallops and even cockles (optional)! Waiting to return to try the other mains!"
Cold cuts and appetizers are better than the main course,This place serves semi-buffet dinner. Appetizers and desserts are freeflow. Seclect one main course from the menu. I had the paper wrapped seafood. It was good. The highlight was theappetizers for me. Very good spread.
Nice semi buffet option,Ample selection of mains to order from but dessert selection is rather limited. Could be better if they enhance their dessert spread.
Best Buffet,I always feel like home when I have lunch at One Ninety. The staff are super attentive and friendly. Food is healthy and yummy.
very good customer service,Loved the variety of entrees offered together with the semi buffer lunch. Value for money to opt for the entree. Food is good. Ambience cosy.
A semi buffet as good as full!,"One-Ninety has got it all - great ambience (cosy lighting, huge chandeliers and warm service through and through), posh factor, great curated smorgasbord of semi buffet so filling you can doggy bag your main course. The selection is sufficient and the food was palatable . It's great value for lunch and afternoon away your brunch till you set your napkins down."
Great food,Always great dining experience here with friendly service. Perhaps been better in terms of table location
"Good service, good food","Service was good but it could be better. The staff were observant and removed the plates once we were done with the food. However, the table was not set-up properly; ie missing cutlery. Request to top up our cups with water was also not fulfilled. Our bill was not in order when presented. Most typical restaurants would not be that careless.

Wagyu rib-eye was a little bit of disappointment. It was not flavourful, tasted bland and uneventful. The characteristic wagyu flavour was extremely weak and diluted. The beef was also not as fresh as it should have been. It could well be a defrosted wagyu rib-eye by all accounts.

Side buffet spread was better, and that's probably the only item worthy of a 4-star."
It would have been 5 stars if...,"Great lunch buffet - quality ingredients/food not about quantity. Reasonably price.

The negative aspect of this place was the ambiance is so-so, located in the basement dark corner of a nice hotel - not the best place to have such a place.

Also the waitress dropped and broke/droped a glass filled with water all over me - glass shards all over the table/floor. Although helped us move to a new table, didnt really offer us any returning vouchers/discount - which is a bit shocking for a 5 star hotel / restaurant and just unacceptable service

I would return for the semi-lunch buffet however I do hope the staff would take into consideration the point above. Just cause the customers says they are ok with no injuries do not take the kindness for granted. I could have easily made it very dramatic and complained/make noise to management. I hope this will be rectify in the future for other customers

Lastly the parking here is ludacris. 18$ for 2-3 hrs of parking. Thankfully the restaurant offers parking voucher - 50$ / voucher."
Grill at its best!,"Grill at its best! they have this great griller oven that dishes great grills. Wish they had pork chops in their menu. It'll add a wonderful item to meet our ""total experience"""
"Excellent Service Staff, Cozy Ambience, Great Food","When I arrived with my dining companions on weekday, we were greeted by friendly host. The cozy lighting, quiet and spaced out tables were perfect for business discussion. The restaurant is not too noisy.

The layout of how food was displayed interesting with different appetizing colors for example black tomatoes is displayed next to bright colored cold cuts. They are simply eye pleasing.

The varieties of appetizers are sufficient to keep me happy and satisfied. They have great selection of cheese, accompanied with a jar of pistachios, dried cranberries and honey. Rye Thin breads and bread sticks are the usual occupiers on this section.

On salad bar, the greens are fresh, condiments provided include interesting Merlot dressing other than the usual caesar and balsamic dressing. I topped up my salad with roasted duck as the main protein. Surprisingly the ordinary looking roasted duck was flavourful. They marinated the duck well, each bite is tasty without any sauce required. Seafood salad was delish, large chunks of easy to peel lobster and crab claws were a draw to seafood lover. Moving on to cold cut sections, they have several types of ham. From Parma ham, shaved honey baked ham, iberico ham and the list still goes on. Love the rock melons, they are fresh and super sweet. Pairing it with Parma Ham is never wrong.

There is also a selection of Mediterranean dishes like Baba Ganoush and couscous salad, Roasted zuchini and Ocra (Ladies Finger) salad.

Make room for dessert, so many yummilicious tarts and cheese cakes to enjoy.
They have green tea cheesecake, Bread pudding and so much more.

One of the service staff on duty called Yuthana from Thailand was very prompt, friendly and helpful.
He made the whole dining experience so pleasant with his professionalism. Kudos to the Four Season's training on staff service attitude.

Would I come back again for meal there? Definitely."
Good Semi Buffet with main,"My wife and I dined here for lunch on Saturday and dinner on Friday. The food was good, but we felt that they could have rotated most of their buffet items instead. 80% of what was served for lunch was served for dinner. This might prevent repeated diners from coming regularly due to lack of new items."
Good set lunch with main and semi-buffet,"We had the semi-buffet and main for lunch at $52 ++. We got 50% off with the Amex platinum card. The semi buffet had a good selection of ham, salad, cheese, grilled vegetables and seafood. The dessert selection though small, they tasted good. There was a good selection of cakes, bread pudding, and fruits. For mains, there were a lot of choices from italian, asian and grilled. We had the tuna and prawns from the grilled section. The service was friendly and ambience was great.o"
"Attentive service staff, mouth watering chilli crab!","Had a hugely satisfying dinner last night @One ninety restaurant. Tried their Semi Buffet which include a main course and a spread of appetizers and desserts to choose from.

1. The buffet spread isn't the most exciting, but offers unique dishes. Definitely not your usual salad buffet.
2. They have a limited time only chilli crab promotion which we can choose for the main course. Of course, for the 1kg worth of crab,there is an additional cost of $38 in addition to the $64 semi buffet set. The chilli crab sauce is fantastic. Better than Jumbo in our opinion. Very flavourful and spicy. Sufficient sauce was given and comes with fried buns to dip the sauce the traditional way. It's nice of them to give us additional buns after witnessing how much we enjoyed the dish.
3. We ordered the cod fish in soy sauce (+$8) for the other main course. Cooked just the way I would like it to be.
4. Kudos to the wonderful staff they have in the restaurant. Very attentive to the slightest of needs we have. From topping up of our drinks to serving new plates for us and offering additional buns. A shout out to the staff (Chinese bespectacled staff) that served us, didn't manage to get his name though. But he's certainly top notch."
Great place for business lunch,"Excellent buffet, sensible in variety and laid out intelligently so one doesn't have to walk all over the restaurant. The buffet is priced reasonably at $42 with an optional menu selection of main course for an addition $10+. The selection is wide enough, without becoming confusing. Staff are watchful and attentive.

The restaurant is not overly busy, so it is possible to have a good conversation over lunch. Quality of food is consistently excellent. This is a favourite place of mine for a quiet business or private lunch."
All I can do is shake my head in disbelief,"On a recent trip to Singapore, my partner and I booked a table at this restaurant to experience their semi buffet dinner. We arrived on time, greeted by someone at the front desk, shown to our table, where we were greeted by our waitress for the evening. Asked to select if we wanted A la carte or Semi buffet, after much pondering we decided to try their semi buffet menu. We both selected the wagu beef, and advised that we were in a rush, so please don't start preparing our main until we've advised, we were told not to worry as it normally takes up to 50mins before mains are served. Great! plenty of time to enjoy our buffet starter. We then selected a bottle from their wine list, but told it wasn't available, disappointing, but no worries, we'll select another one. Not fives minutes into our entree, we see one of the chiefs bringing out two steaks??? He wondered our way, where I proceeded to tell him, no that will not be ours! What a joke! We then spoke to our waitress who told us there was a mix up in the kitchen, we asked that we will not be served those exact pieces as we requested med rare and if we are to get it will be well done. We then re-confirmed that will will let her know when we would like the kitchen to start preparing the main, again we wanted to enjoy and relax, not to rush. We finished our entrees, plates were cleared but we weren't ready to have main just yet... well to bad , out comes our plates of steak, but this time in a vain attempt for them to rectify their error from before, they served our mains on overly large black plates, really????? Sorry but we hadn't advised we were ready for our main. You would think a five star hotel restaurant could accommodate this simple request. The kerfuffle that took place near our table was just so off putting. By this stage we had three people waiting on our table. The waitress, the chef and the restaurant Mgr. We were asked if we would like pepper, we said yes please, only to have to end up getting the pepper grinder ourselves. We were given a dessert to compensate but honestly, there was already a sour taste in my mouth from this whole experience. Food was average, over salted to create flavor. Not a good experience overall. The table next to where we were seated was vacated before we had been seated and you could see that there must of been a family with young toddlers. The fact that during the whole duration of our visit, that table wasn't cleared up. Sad as I hate giving bad reviews, but sorry guys. It just wasn't great. Communication between wait staff/Kitchen staff need to be worked on."
Simple and very good,"One-Ninety is the main breakfast / lunch restaurant in the Four Seasons hotel.

Both breakfast and lunch feature buffet options as well as a la carte choices and a great selection of both western and asian dishes.

As buffets go, the selection for both sittings is pretty good especially as breakfast is included with some room rates.

In keeping with the rest of the Four Seasons, Singapore, service is very good - friendly and attentive."
Great ambience but average fair,"I find it strange that a high end restaurant will leave the box around. Maybe it's the Rolls Royce of biscuits but the the presentation leaves much to be desired. On the plus side, the wait staff were v attentive and warm."
"Very good food, topped only by the excellent service","I was here with a bunch of friends recently for dinner during the first Singapore Restaurant Week event of the year. We chose One-Ninety because the dinner sitting times of many other participating restaurants didn't fit in with our schedule. And One-Ninety certainely turned out to be an excellent choice for all of us. The restaurant was quiet when we arrived but the waiting staff used the opportunity to engage us in conversation, as well as to explain the restaurant's dining concept. The appetisers and dessert were offered in a buffet style which allowed us to try the many different dishes on offer - most of us were impressed with the scallops, duck, and the cheesecake. But the main courses were the attraction of the night. My dining partners found their portions of baked salmon and spring chicken a little too large, but my octopus was just nice since it meant I got to have more dessert. Throughout the evening, the waiting staff checked in on our experience. Much as the food was very good, their service will probably stay with me longer."
Best Rissoto in Town!,The Chef whips out one of the best Risotto I have ever had in my life! Worth every single dollar. Great place to chill on the outdoor with a cigar in hand.
Above average,"Tried their buffet lunch on a weekday. Food is ok. Although the selection is small, but quality is good. Nice ambience too. Service is ok."
Devastatingly Disappointing Sunday Brunch,"Visited One Ninety last Sunday (19 Feb) for Sunday brunch as I had a visitor in Singapore. Made a reservation the same morning - was surprised that they had a table available but so pleased as from previous experience the brunch on Sundays was one of the best in Singapore.

Went to the hotel and proceeded to the restaurant. I could not believe my eyes - this once sumptuous and spectacular Sunday brunch was no more ..... I reminded me of the opening words of Anais Nin's book Paris Revisited ""The Paris you love is dead"" - the buffet I remembered and loved was surely dead. It was a glorious and spectacular buffet - in my opinion the best in Singapore. Former food and beverage manager Daniel Simon was the architect of a feast so wonderful you would remember until old age - fresh seafood, ethnic foods, sushi, it even had a bouncy castle upstairs and children buffet where you could deposit your children. Ah days of yore!!!

No we had a meagre offering similar to a weekday lunch. Buffet starter - main from the menu and buffet dessert. Such a disappointment. How could a restaurant fall from such a stupendous event to such a mediocre apology. If Mr Simon is still alive the GM urgently needs to bring him back. If he has expired he must be turning in his grave to see such a desecration of a once glorious restaurant he created and nurtured - I mean somersaults - not the odd turn!!

My visit was devastatingly disappointing. Not worth a visit - I can't be the only one thinking this as the restaurant was less than 25% occupied - as opposed to the old buffet which had two seatings - more than twice the number of seats on each seating which spread to the corridors, adjacent bar and patio. How very sad. In those days 100% occupied and very difficult to get a reservation. I certainly won't be visiting again on a Sunday."
Great food and service!!,"There is a combo deal for 64sgd ++ for the starter buffet and a main course. Else you can have a la carte which is a mix ofFar east dishes, sub continent and italian ...or just grill with a steak! Service is impeccable and friendly. Looked at the wine list st by the glass and looks decent. Then move onto the lounge bar which have an outdoor space to try one of the many cocktails or sip a cup of tea."
High standard of service as always,"Love the usual high standard of service here. The Truffle Foccacia is our all time favorite and always go well with a nice glass of champagne.

They have a nice list of below $100 wines now with decent offerings.

Can never go wrong with their wood fired grille items.

Only place that we go to that offers consistent service at 7-8/10 levels."
A slight slip in service quality,"I have been a regular at 190 for a while, and have always thought of it as an excellent venue for a buffet lunch. While the food remains great, there seems to have been a huge turnover in the service staff there, and this appears to have unfortunately resulted in a very visible drop in service quality - as evidenced on 3-4 recent visits. I have seen service spoons lying on the floor, next to the buffet tables and the waitstaff passing by would not bother to pick them up. They also don't seem to pay as much attention to detail when taking drinks orders."
Good food,I liked the buffet for starters and desserts. The fish as main course was well prepared. Overall a nice hotel restaurant
Pleasant experience but food was rather average,"This is a casual and very open type eatery, a little like a high end canteen. It is pleasant though and it's a nice place to do casual meals with the family, especially if you have kids.

Staff were pleasant, very polite and though they were busy on the night we were there, they still tried their best to be attentive and were generally all very professional.

The food however was rather average especially the steaks. I think this was a disappointment given that the restaurant name gives the impression that this is a steakhouse. The steak and the lamb were really very average. The tuna steak however was pretty good. The sides were actually of a more spectacular standard than the mains itself. The grilled veggies were absolutely one of the best we have ever tasted."
Relaxing atmosphere.,"This outlet is our second trip there.What we like this place,is the services and not that heavy filling food you normally get from buffet.
We only there for their semi buffet dinner..there's a change to their main menu,with three group of choices.Italian selections,Asian specialties and from the Grill.
At $64 ++,is reasonable with this kind of atmosphere and service.And it will be wonderful if they add in a cup of hot beverages .
The restaurant manager SaifAli and staffs like Shaan and Simon has make my day brighter and enjoyable.Thumb up for their great services."
"Great atmosphere, great food, drinks and service","Great place to hang out or for a business meeting. Excellent service, great food, drinks and service. And most important great choice of cigars and an outdoor area, which is well appointed and where you can actually sit, relax and enjoy you smoke with a nice cognac or whiskey.
This place is a must visit when in Singapore"
Superb service and food,Excellent service from arrival to departure. The manager and every service staff were polite and friendly - hallmark Four Seasons. Food selection and portions were generous. Loved the experience - a wonderful dinner. We will be back!
Good food and service,"This was our first visit to One Ninety.

We were greeted by friendly staff who explained the menu. You have a choice of the buffet or choosing from the menu.

My husband had the steak which was cooked perfectly and I had meat platter. This was really good.

We look forward to coming back."
Remains a great value meal!,"Went to try this old favourite after its recent makeover (unnoticeable; but I was told that the floor was redone). The food spread remains as good as ever. All the old favourites are back, including fantastic desserts (including the bread and butter pudding as well as the fig pie). Remains a great value meal!"
Fantastic service,"Had lunch couple times here and they have never failed in their service. We ordered a wanton noodle for our 15 month old grandson and he didn't seem to enjoy it so the Restaurant Manager offered us spaghetti at no extra charge. All the staff were attentive and friendly. The executive pastry chef also came to chat with us.

Their set lunch was good too. If u enjoy antipasti and dessert, you must try this restaurant."
