Too noisy environment. Pasta so-so.,"There are 2 floors for seating. Highly recommended to make reservation as it is also very crowded on weekday evening.

Ordered pasta and feels its too hard. Homemade pasta has al-dente texture.

Soup of the day is cream of potato. Indeed creamy with slight hint of bacon taste.

There is complimentary plain water and bread with balsamic vinegar. Not chargeable.

Appetizer, we ordered some buffalo mozzarella cheese wrapped with parma ham. Its coated with balsamic vinegar too. So its quite salty for this small dish.

Overall, food tasted so-so. Have not tried pizza though.

Indoor environment can be too noisy when there are bigger groups who talked louder. Both 1st and 2nd floor has few seats that are outdoor. Recommended to sit outside if you cannot stand enclosed noisy environment."
We enjoyed our lunch,"We had a good time at La Nonna. We've requested a quiet corner. To our pleasant surprise, even though the restaurant is not big, they really arranged a quieter corner for us. The service staff are friendly and polite."
La Nonna,"Food was good as usual, portions were generous and service was friendly. Will visit again. Environment was abit noisy because the restaurant was full on a Thursday afternoon."
Foods are great always but staffs are like a robot (albeit efficient),"Been there a few times.

The foods are great as always but staffs are like a robot (albeit they do it efficiently) .They only do as they are told. They don't proactively explain the promotions and the signature dishes. They don't even offer to make any recommendation on wine and the menus. No small talk to make customer feel welcome.

The attitude is like a fast food chain: ""order, eat, get out and next customers please""."
La Nonna,"La Nonna Holland Village was a good experience, despite it’s faults. We were seated on the second floor. We ordered one Vegeteriana pizza, two Fettuccine pastas, one Nonna salad, one serve of Italian sausages, a beer, red wine and gelato and sorbets for dessert. The waiters were warm, but a tad too confident in themselves and treated us like we didn’t know anything at all. Alas, our mains were served nearly one hour after we arrived. Despite this, all the food was delicious, and everything was eaten and drank. The pizza included capsicum, tomatoes, artichokes, anchovies and cheese and these all went together perfectly. The pastas were yummy, the salad and sausages were nice and the drinks were lovely. Will come again."
Great dinner,"Portion sizes were generous and all the dishes ordered were exceptionally tasty. Pesto chicken pasta, egg pizza and tiramisu ordered. All were really good."
Good Food. Rude Waiter,Food was excellent. We loved it. The tall waiter at the door was very rude with regards checking. Treated us like idiots. We have done this for 2 years. It was only a matter of looking for the scanning QR.
Great Italian meal,"We had the Pizza La Nonna topped with a generous amount of truffle, Ravioli Della Nonna (lobster ravioli) and calamari. There were complimentary warm bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar too. Everything tasted great. My favourite was the pizza."
I've eaten here regularly for the past 14 months. AWESOME pizza and lunch special.,"This Italian restaurant is so authentic and tasty! Their pizzas are wood-fired and as I eat Whole Food Plant Based Nutrition, I LOVE their Vegetariana pizza. LOTS of different veggies, awesome sauce and tastes like there is cheese on it but there is no cheese. My mentor I host there orders either pizza or a pasta dish and he loves their cheese and meat pizzas. My bride prefers their pasta and it makes for a great 'date'. The lunch special for Monday through Friday is 1 for 1. Great food! Great VALUE!"
Average home pizza and pasta,"Pappardelle with oxtail ragout was good. Thin crust pizza was soft and average. Main course - the fat around lamb chops was not trimmed and not much meat. Medium well was requested but it came overcooked with cold mashed potato and gravy, and inedible mushrooms. In short pasta seems worthwhile and thats about it"
Italian,"Booked via phone and the voice was friendly. When we arrived, the staff wasn’t inspiring with one of those “oh i can’t find your reservation. Oh i found it”

We had the squid ink pizza, cod and seabass which were all quite good. Had to ask for the chilli flakes and cheese, they won’t proactively offer

Ok value, not overpriced"
Great Pasta!,"Went back for the third time.
Love the warm bread to start our meal with, small actions that means alot to a customer.
Excellent Pasta (Pappardelle coda de blue) and Above Average Pizza!! Service was very good!! Our tall and handsome waiter was very humorous. Will definitely return!! Family friendly environment, great for dates and families!"
5 yrs. and counting,Been having meals here with my then girlfriend/fiancée now mrs. on our anniversary for a few years now and I must say that it is still delivering on the yums-to-dollar ratio front C:
Different levels of service at different levels of the restaurant,"You enter the restaurant on the ground level, and the reception was less than lukewarm. Once you get upstairs (where my reservation was), the service improved vastly. My dining companions and I had a very pleasant experience upstairs - a stark contrast to the unwelcome vibe downstairs. If we disregard the inconsistent service, the restaurant as a whole was a pleasant experience. Food was good and service upstairs was above average."
Amazing food!,"The flavours were wonderful. The menu offers a good variety on the antipasti/starter selections, which is a refreshing change!"
Good Pizza,The pizza was excellent and the staffs as well. The music in the kitchen was really loud and was very up beat compared to the music in the resaurant which was a very confusing as the environment was not what I have expected.
Unlikely worth the visit,"Visited this place for the first time and was sadly disappointed. Service was not pleasant - firstly with the restaurant manager getting a simple order of wrong and then with irritation being shown after being corrected about it. It seemed as if the furniture of the tables beside us was going to get damaged with the way they were being ‘loudly’ re-arranged. Food was not great either - clam linguine came swimming in butter, crabmeat in the crabmeat pasta was not fresh and pizza was ‘tasty’ because it was over salted. Place seemed understaffed and staff unhappy."
NOT coming back,"For first time customers staff were not welcoming, just doing their job of taking orders and serving. Not even thank you for coming at the end. Their looks were like “why are this family here?” Fosters and The Good Cafe at HV are still the best."
Great Italian Food,"We were just wandering about the HV streets and came across “La Nonna”. Who doesn't love a good Italian treat, and yes we were hungry. So we decided and knocked on their doors. We were seated downstairs and the restaurant had a cozy, nice vibe.

Without wasting much time we ordered for Bruschetta (came in three varieties), Diavola, and Calzone (Folded Pizza). The food was really good, another good Italian place to look forward to. I would especially emphasize the pizza, as it was very fresh and easy on the mouth + stomach (I am seldom impressed by pizzas). Later we got some beer to quench our thirst and Tiramisu for desserts (what better way to end the day).

Overall a great place and highly recommended . Next time need to get outdoor seating upstairs."
Nice pizzas but inconsistent service standard,"Went to La Nonna twice within a week with different person, as they are currently running a lunch promo (1 for 1 main or set lunch $26+). This place is also on Entertainer, where you can enjoy 1 for 1 main too. Reached ard noon on the second visit and the male server manning the entry (and first floor) wasn’t very friendly when he knew we didn’t have reservation made. Thankfully we managed to get in a while later and were seated upstairs. It was a pleasure to be served by the young male chap working on that level. You can tell he enjoys his job and genuinely engaged with diners. Food on both occasions’ great, portions good. Very worthwhile if you are there during such promotions."
1 for 1,"There's 1 for 1 mains which makes it quite worth it. Otherwise, it's expensive. Their portion are quite big - especially the pizza. It's thin crust. The crabmeat linguine is delicious too. Will be good if their menu has more items to choose.
It's quite packed when we are there. Places are small and we had to sit on the patio as it's full. Table for 2 are too small to put 1 pizza and 1 pasta. It's really hot there as well. Will be good if it's not that squeezy."
Very poor service and attitude,Very poor service. We arrived at 11am before restaurant opening hours and were told that there was no need to make a reservation. We came back at 1130am when the restaurant was finally open for lunch. We were then told that there was only outdoor seating left as the last indoor table had been given away to the couple who had literally just been ushered in. Do not ever come here if you dont want to be disappointed by very poor staff attitude. It is not worth the trip and the 1 for 1 promo or whatever that was being advertised. This restaurant is definitely not like how it was a few years ago. I feel very sorry for the current owner. Please look into your service and waiter staff and give them proper training. Thanks
Not good value for money.,"The food was not particularly good. The salad was over-oiled, and the vegetarian pizza was soggy. Mushroom soup was OK. We sat upstairs on the patio, which was nice but the table for two was too small for the food ordered. Service was prompt.

In addition to a single ordering of each of the above and two glasses of wine, the bill came to $100. Not good value for money in my opinion."
1 4 1 yummy lunch,Efficient n polite service from reception to table n dinning Comfortable seating with great safe distancing Delicious dishes served piping hot n well balanced taste. The outdoor area is great in the evenings.
Pizza Night,"Had a pizza night with my boys and we ordered La Nonna Signature Pizza, Salmone E Rucola, Diavola and Proscuitto E Rucola. They were all divine, freshest of ingredients were used and pizza crust was perfect had a good crunch. Food arrived earlier than expected delivery time and food temperature was nice and warm. Keep up your excellent work Team La Nonna!"
Great food in HV!,I have always loved La Nonna's pizzas and pastas. Great food and ambience here. Also conveniently located and staff are very welcoming
A staple in Holland Village,"Pizzas are great, the past dishes are awesome and we have never had a bad or disappointing dish here. The chef mixes it up and has specials that change so it never gets boring.
Also if you have a Singapore AMEX platinum you get 50% off your bill which makes this place even better!"
"Top notch service crew, above average pizza and pasta in Holland Village.","Super impressive service; food was fast, turnaround and billing super-efficient. Even the drinks and food was near instant, very happy with that. Food is well seasoned and tasty. For me, the standout was the La Nonna Pizza. Happy hour drinks are great value too!"
Our Default Restaurant,"This is our preferrred Family restaurant. There's something for the four of us - pizza, steak, pasta, wine, bread basket, service with a smile."
Good pasta,"Love the pasta. Had the crab meat tomato based linguine and it’s good! Triple cheese ravioli and lobster ravioli are good too. Lava cake is divine, warm and drooling with dark chocolate inside. The tiramisu is wonderful with strong rum too!"
2 adults and 3 kids have to order at least 4 pizza/pasta/mains,Be warned. I was here with my family and since there were 3 kids we wanted to just order 2 pizzas to share since the kids don't eat much but we were told we had to order at least 4 pizza/pasta/mains. Dessert/starters don't count. Obviously we ended up with way too much food leftover and a very unpleasant experience
Friendly staffs,Visiting this place for the past 12years Great food Wonderful staffs Place to renovate Food menu need to change
hit and miss on my first visit,"had heard positive reviews previously, so was keen to check it out. but started off on completely the wrong note because the staff gave away our table reservation, and we had even arrived slightly early! manager apologized profusely, but we really don't understand how something like that could happen. foodwise, calamari and pizzas were great; but risotto was bad (rice grains too hard) and sea bass was also not worth mentioning (overcooked and fish didn't even seem to be seasoned). overall, quite a disappointing first visit, not sure i would want to return to give it a 2nd chance. at least the manager did give us the calamari 'on the house' when we paid the bill."
Small cosy restaurant,Food was so so. The Lasagna sauce was too sweet and I hardly find any mince beef in my order. Steak was too fatty.
Super love their pappardelle!,Super love their pappardelle! Must try if you have chance to visit there :) The portion is good enough and the taste is great
Will come back again!,"Signature Pizza is a must order. Braised Beef Cheeks so tender it melt in your mouth, Lobster Ravoli is delicious as well. The pumpkin Tart is somehow not to our liking, will try other dessert in next visit."
5 Stars Experience 👍🏻,"Excellent service, delicious food (Truffle Pasta & Smoke Salmon Pizza) & 5 star service! Highly recommend!"
Simply Delicious,"I have been here for many times, so I Guess it is time for me to write a review. I started coming here about 2 years ago through a promotion. Since then, we have been visiting at least once a month. This restaurant serves excellent pizza. The dough is first class, chewy and tasty. If u like pasta, try the Parpadelle. Happy hour beer (Italian) is only $6. Amazing place for after work or family"
feedback,Great food and service as always. Will be back again with the family. Any plans to open another outlet?
Great lunch,We ordered the 1 for 1 main course. The lasagne & crab pasta were my favorites. Pizza had a lot of rocket veg too was great 👍🏻
Delightful Italian restaurant,"Glad to have found this place. Honest to goodness food. Will be back. We ordered the buffalo cheese salad, crab linguini and a spicy sausage pizza. All good though the spicy sausage wasn't spicy to me. That said, the pizza was good."
Set lunch,The set lunch that my friend and I ordered was average. The salad was bland and the main was a bit too much portioned. It should be stated that cash vouchers are not able to use for set lunch meals because i’d bought a voucher before dining and was told that I cannot use for my order.
Best 1st time experience dining @ La Nonna,"Celebrated a friend’s birthday at La Nonna and was recommended to lunch out at this place.
Enjoyed the food thoroughly and truly worth the money paid for as the portions are huge too, sufficient for the 3 of us.
Would definitely recommend to others this place"
Delicious homey Italian food. A gastronomical delight,"The 1-for1 lunch specials are definitely a hit! Must try: La Nonna specialty pizza, tiramisu and the cod fish."
Dinner at La Nonna,Good food and service. Been coming back for several times and the food is consistently good. Will come back again soon
dinner,"had a mushroom soup, beef and lemon tart for dinner. complimentary bread was served. soup and tart were slightly above average. the beef was only average for me. decent service."
Service has gone southwards,"Had dinner there with some clients, it has lost its charm from what it was before, a little less authentic. Pasta was great but service lacked a little depth. Bread was just left on the table not like before served warm 3 minutes after you arrive. Drink orders were not accurate, serving Gin and Tonic with Lemon.... not good.

Team needs some rebooting and refreshing .... don’t fall into the trap of running autopilot."
La Nonna Pizza,"Was hoping for authentic pizza at La Nonna. Unfortunately the pizza was far from authentic. Poor quality base that you would associate with supermarket frozen pizza. The toppings were also low quality. For the money being charged I would have expected way, way better"
Average food,"Food: Had the risotto with scallops - very salty, taglierini pasta with truffle - average creamy pasta, linguine pasta with crab meat - average tomato based pasta, La Nonna pizza - unique pizza probably the best out of all the dishes

Service: Good service, went at 5pm, there were only a couple of other customers.

Value: Decent value at $66 with the entertainer app. Likely not worth without discounts."
Alright,Reasonable food & service but found the restaurant a bit too cramped & claustrophobic for a pretty pricey joint.
Value for Money,First chanced upon this place via the entertainer app and I love it! The food is pretty awesome and I'm glad that the app gave me a chance to get to try this place. The place looks pretty posh on the outside but the price is quite reasonable. Some of the pastas are handmade too which makes it even more value for money!
Excellent food,"good food and service. Ordered the lobster ravioli, mild spiciness but savoury. Had the oven baked cod fish , skin was baked to right crisps with slight saltiness, went well with the fresh tender fish meat. Enjoyed the food thoroughly."
Authentic & homey Italian fare,"Definitely recommended for authentic Italian food, vibrant atmosphere and good service!

Our family of 4 plus one toddler enjoyed our dinner and 2 thumbs up for the La Nonna signature wood oven pizza- loved the runny egg yolk in the middle & the black truffle!
Don't miss the Risotto Allo Zafferano- the butternut pumpkin, scallops & caviar made this a special dish!
And do order the Squid ink pasta- thick black & absolutely yummy!

Our meal was complete with the hot & creamy mushroom soup and we had the Happy Hour promo of a bottle of Prosecco and a complimentary side of assorted Bruschetta!

Next time, we will leave room for dessert!!"
Nice place,Good place with a 1-for-1 lunch deal. Enjoyed the food and time with friends. Slightly pricey withou the 1-for-1 deal. Pastas were gd
Nice service and food,We came to try because of Amex Love Dining discount. Pasta and Parmigiana Eggplant was excellent. The restaurant manager was very nice let us sit indoor despite there were only outdoor tables available during reservation. Thank you for the extra service to make us comfortable. We will come again to try the set lunch.
A nice family dinner at a classy and authentic Italian restaurant,"This place tucked in the middle of so many eateries can be easily missed.

The ambience of the place though not authentic Italian but the food is definitely authentic and exquisite.

Ordered the Meat Lovers and Salmone E Rucola pizzas, Risotto Allo Zafferano and Calamari.

All I have to say that they are very generous with the vegetables which goes very well with the olive oil and dark vinaigrette give the Italian twist and taste.

The staff was also very attentive and catered to the needs very quickly even though that it was quite pack during dinner period."
Our go to place for Italian food near home,We have been bringing our 2 boys here since we move to this area 10 years ago. Their La Nona pizza is always the boys' favourite dish to order. The captain is also a very friendly chap who always ensures that everything is done right with an extra helping of mushroom on the pizza as he has watched the kids grow up over this time.
average food,"feel a bit lacking of the range of food, bread is cold.But pizza is quite decent.Not sure about coming back"
Good service,"Roma assisted us with our order and cashier, a patient lady who waited me to purchase the Chope voucher and I was also able to redeem chope points at the same time. Food was good overall, however the risotto was too salty."
A visit on friday evening,"Was greeted with a smile. Staff was prompt, served our water quickly, menu was given.

Served with breadsticks and hot bread as condinments. Bread was fresh and served with olive oil and balsimic vinegar as dips.

Had the La Nonna pizza, the combination of the dish was good, the egg was not over cooked and it serve as dipping for the pizza, just nice not overly salty or gelat after completing the entire pizza.

Ordered another main dish as the food was delicious, crab meat linguine with tomato sauce, as the staff mentioned that it was a best seller. Overall the taste is not that heavy, however I would like the tomato base to be more tomato.

Had a tiramisu as well. It tasted normal.

Overall I enjoyed myself."
Good portions,"I like the la nonna pizza with its generous portion of truffles, asparagus and perfectly served with a sunny side up. It’s so delicious. The spicy arrabbiata goes well with the lobster ravioli though it tasted more like crab meat. The risotto portion is generous too but too bland. I like the complimentary bread basket which is warm chewy and nice. The eatigo offer is a good deal to try their food. Lovely ambience and friendly staff. They also have nice lunch deals."
Good Food,"Visited with another couple and we all enjoyed our meals. The special Proseco and bruschetta during happy hour was good value. Service was efficient and allowed us time to eat our meal at leisure with out interruption? We ate outside and it was very pleasant in this busy area, there is also a balcony on the first floor."
Soooo gooood!,"The two of us were STUFFED from a small Funghi, Parmigiana and the La Nonna pizza but it was so worth it! The food was so full of flavour and the staff members were really friendly. We went on Wednesday evening so the place wasn't too crowded :) Thank you La Nonna!"
Great place for evening hangout,"If you are planning to chill in Friday evening, this is a great place. Food is good. Place is good. Only one thing. No music. Hey, you might not even notice that when you are eating and talking."
Must-try La Nonna's La Nonna Signature,"Full house on a Friday night. La Nonna is a go-to Italian restaurant with amazing pizzas. Two stories and has alfresco dining options. Would recommend anyone new to La Nonna to try their classic signature, also called ""La Nonna"" - a pizza with egg, truffle, asparagus and Parmesan. Deli!"
IMPRESSED!,Small cosy place. Enjoyed the La Nonna Pizza and Tiramisu. The truffle on the pizza was perfect! Great lunch deal available!
Not a good experience. I bought the Chope voucher but can’t be use. If use it I have to pay full price & forgo 1-for-1.,"Not really a good experience, because of I bought the Chope voucher and if to redeem the voucher will lose 1-for-1 offer. So, I wasted my Chope voucher don’t know when I can use it."
Lovely Truffle Pasta,"Love their weekend 1-1 mains deal which I can enjoy since I don't have Entertainer. This was the first place I ever tried truffle pasta and it was amazing. Comes in close second after the truffle pasta at Hopheads Bar! Staff are very attentive. There was once I noticed a ""foreign particle"" but decided not to point it out as I was almost done with my meal. But a staff noticed my gesture (directed at my date) and promptly apologised and offered to waive the cost of that pasta. It was a proactive gesture that I greatly appreciated. :)"
Holland V Italian restaurant,"Food was actually quite tasty, though nothing out of the ordinary. Amex platinum card holders has 50% off for 2 main dishes orders so it was very affordable. Worth trying!"
Good food and service,We went to La Nonna for an office dinner. Ordered the wine bottle and starter combo followed by the special pizza & beef carpaccio. Food was generally good. Service was good. The place itself has a nice vibe to it. We sat outside and enjoyed ourselves.
Amazing Italian food!,We loved the food. The pizza in particular was delicious! The only thing that wasn’t great was the tiramisu. I was slightly disappointed but everything else was great!
Overall great experience at this italian restaurant,"Repeated visit at this italian restaurant. The menu is easy to read, The man who seems to be floor manager is really friendly and approachable, everytime sees him there. This visit, We tried the RISOTTO ALLO ZAFFERANO and Oven-baked Classic Lasagna, both are delicious and the lagsana was served sizzling in the pan! maybe a little bit salty for the lasagna. Previously we tried their CALZONE pizza- Folded Pizza filled with Tomato, Mozzarella, Mushrooms and cooked Ham, it was really special and fall in love with it. another reason that I keep coming back is the AMEX dining discount at this restaurant. nevertheless, the price is decent even before discount!"
Nice food,"Good place for pizza! I usually order pizzas here since they are one of the best in this area. Went to visit the restaurant and ordered the lasagna, was good but the pizza is what makes them stand up to other Italian restaurants. Prices are fair and service is excellent. Inwould highly recommend this restaurant."
Worth the money - even without the lunch promo!,"I came here a couple of years ago and am happy to say the food is as good as I remembered it to be. We went for the La Nonna pizza ($24.50) and the risotto allo zafferano ($28). I was pleasantly surprised at the size and generosity of toppings on the pizza. The risotto was cooked al dente and the king scallops delightfully seared.We enjoyed the weekday lunch deal (1-for-1 pasta/pizza/main), but I would definitely come back even when the discount is not available!"
Excellent food & service,"Have been visiting this restaurant for years. Good for friends gathering.Enjoyed both the food & service, especially with promotions. Advisable to make reservation if you prefer indoor."
Good Italian Cuisine,Good food great service. Manager Naina was fantastic. He is a Asian Chap but knows the menu well. The stewards need to be trained abit more especially this particular guy called Steven. When I asked for pepper he ignored me and gave me a strange look of disgust. Not cool at all. Will definitely come again...
Great time with delicious food,We had a farewell lunch for our colleague organised and we all enjoyed the food and the ambiance.Overall rating is very good
Pleasant wkend lunch with family,"Clean restaurant with attentive staff, possibly due to smaller lunch crowd on weekend. Got a corner table with just enough space for pram. Bread was room temp and slightly tough, wld prefer for it to be toasted. Risotto and crabmeat pasta were good, meat lovers' pizza and calzone were so-so. They have a good prosecco + free side promo at $35++ on weekdays."
Pizza is not worse it,As an Italian root from my mother side I would say not worse to eat here but I mentioned I only had pizza which I wouldn’t recommend it for the pizza....plus it is even more expensive a simple Margherita to compare i real Italian restaurant... pity because I like Holland village sphere.
Good service. Average food,Nice venue. Good service. Ok food. Nothing special to write home about. Nice little place but food was average
My favorite Italian Shop!,"Service wise, the staff was very attentive and shown initiative. I dined together with a colleagues and ordered 4 menus and we cannot finish it. The staff attentively asked us if we wanted the left over to bring along. Location wise, it's very accessible since it just a walking distance from Holland Village MRT.We love their LA NONNA pizza! We even take away 1 more box :) Their pasta is to die for (for me). My friend requested to order their lobster ravioli and she loves it.I recommend to visit them during lunch and they have 1 FOR 1 promotion."
You can find a better one !,"The quality of food is average, orders the burrata cheese, lamb ribs and spaghetti with cream sauce. The burrata cheese a little too hard by standard, asked for medium cooked lamb chops but come too raw like a medium ray.. so have to bring back to cook. First ever eat the spaghetti with cream sauce like a soup noodle as it is too watery! Ordered to wine but waiter forgot to serve till I asked, the food we ordered was taken down wrongly too... waiter not so attentive but the price to pay for serve a 3 Stars. Else it would only 2 stars as the service and food are not that good ."
Delicious no-fuss Italian,"Absolutely love their Taglierini Truffle pasta and Parmigiana. Intense flavour, satisfying texture and generously portioned."
Pasta & Pizza,"Popular Italian haunt with a long queue; we tried the Cod, Salmon, as well as some pastas and pizza - rather good, and most of the mains are large enough for sharing"
Food @ La Nonna,serves good Italian food for pastas & pizzas.good portions with valued pricing during lunch time.main courses are great choices too.
Lunch promo,Every dish we ordered tasted delicious n above our expectation. Extremely happy w the 1-1 promotions!
Great value for money.,The food was good and great value for money. The only feedback is that we were seated on the ground floor and the area seems a bit small for a party of 6 adults and 1 child.
Good quality and reasonably priced!,"I have already been to La Nonna 3 times over the last month or so and the food is generally good. The menu is not very long but they do the items they offer well. The staff are helpful and motivated. There is both indoor and outdoor seating spread over two floors, both of which are pleasant at night. The price is really very reasonable when one makes use of their partner promotion programme, which accounts for why they draw a good crowd most of the time."
La Nonna restaurant,its a great restaurant with great food. U mustn't miss the La Nonna pizza which isn't too thick and yet crispy and well dripped with pure Italian love and sauces!
"No prima donnas, but nice nonya wait staff at La Donna","The food is decent (pizzas are excellent; lobster ravioli so-so, it has so much sauce and so little lobster you can’t taste the latter; wet risotto very wet and quite unusual but not great; forget about mediocre antipasti). However, it is satisfying, almost like meals cooked by a loving grandma who is not a fabulous chef. The place has two qualities: it is very good value (especially when special 1-for-1 offers are on), and service is exceptionally warm and friendly."
Coming back to a grandmother's home,"La Nonna is an Italian restaurant situated in Holland Village, a popular dining and shopping choice for young Singaporeans as well as expatriates. The restaurant is often considered to be a preferred choice for meals with families and friends.

La Nonna has seating both in and outdoors, and is dog-friendly. The furniture is very simple, but it well replicates the feeling of being inside a warm home. Inside the restaurant, diners can view a part of the stove, contributing to the overall feeling of warmth an openness expressed in an Italian home. I came with a family of four as well as our dog for dinner, and we felt very welcome at La Nonna.

The menu offered a wide range of Italian dishes. At the start of the meal, we were served breadsticks with olive oil and balsamic vinegar as an appetizer. I had the homemade Pappardelle, a pasta dish similar to fettuccine. The rest of my family shared the Truffle Pizza and Lasagna. All three dishes were superb and the sauces were flavorful and delicious. The sauces for the dishes were unlike the typical tomato sauce used in most Italian restaurants but were seasoned by spices to make them special and delectable.

Prices were overall reasonable. I would not consider the restaurant as a mid-priced dining option nor a fine dining choice, but somewhere in the middle. The food was definitely worth the visit. However, service was very much average, in fact, reached a minimal standard. One interesting and outstanding waiter was this young man who served us. He looked as if he was only fifteen, but he was very sweet and made sure we were all properly accommodated. He outperformed his peers, despite his young age.

La Nonna means “the grandmother” in Italian, and like in a grandmother’s home, I felt very safe, warm, and welcome. I will make sure to come back for another meal soon in the future. Overall, I highly recommend La Nonna to diners with families and friends."
"Good Food, Good Price","The place is usually very packed during lunch hours because of its buy one get one free pasta and pizza deal. If you want to have air-con seating, early reservation is a must. Otherwise you have to sit outdoor which is quite comfortable too if you don't mind the hot air. Food is delicious and service is nice and prompt. Thumb up."
Excellent service and food,"Manager provided such lovely service - welcoming, humorous and went the extra mile by plating the slice of cake we brought for our friend's birthday! loved our la nonna signature pizza (think truffle, asparagus and runny yolk yum yumsss) and the lagsana we ordered as well!!"
Nothing short of wonderful,"From the friendly service staff to the amazing food, the visit was nothing less than magical. We had the Nera pizza - thin crust and good amounts of fresh seafood."
Dinner - such a disappointment,"La Nonna was a family favourite years ago but we have not visited for the past couple of years.

Unfortunately, it feels as if the only thing it now has in common with the old restaurant is the name.

We ordered the mushroom soup, crab linguine and squid ink pizza for 2 of us to share.

Firstly the service was dismal, the gentleman taking the order never smiled, and even when we asked his recommendation, he could not be bothered. The bread basket was literally thrown on our table. The rest of the staff just stood around almost scowling. Only the Filipina lady was pleasant. And we were the only ones in the restaurant!

The food was such a disappointment. The mushroom soup was really watery with hardly any flavour or taste. We had to ask for salt and pepper to season it before it was palatable.

Next the linguine. It was supposed to be creamy tomato based sauce. Again the sauce was watery; and at best taste wise could only be described as tolerable.

The pizza had no taste at all; so I needed to douse it with Tabasco ( which I usually won’t use). The seafood used were the frozen kind with no taste ( or rubbery taste).

It was such a disappointment as we were really looking forward to a good meal. We had to go across the road to Haagen Das for ice cream to cheer ourselves up."
Better than Italian food in Italy,"We are regular customers and can't recommend this place enough. All the staff are super friendly and the food is excellent. I'm not Italian, but I've visited Italy five times and was never able to find food as good as La Nonna's over there."
Fri Night Dinner - Pizza is great!,"Reserved a table early in advance so we managed to get a quieter area on Fri night.

My second visit here. I love the pizzas here - La Nonna and Nera (squid ink) are really good. The black truffle on La Nonna is to die for!!

As for mains - I’ve tried two other pasta, the beef ribeye, and lamb. All not satisfactory for the price point. The salmon is good though, would recommend it!

Staff are generally pleasant and attentive, restaurant ambience is also not bad albeit a little dark. Overall I feel this place is a little overpriced and only the pizza is worth the trip down. Would be most worth to come during lunch 1-for-1 instead of dinner :)"
Value for money after discount,"Second visit to this place. Service was good, complementary bread served prior to your main course was as delicious as ever.
Main course was served within 15 minutes and it was somewhat above average as compared to other Italian restaurant. Not exactly worth the full price (there are nicer Italian restaurants who serve better quality pasta at this price), but definitely worth it if its paired with credit card promotions or the entertainer app which gives you a 50% discount.
Do look out for promotions online as this restaurants has alot of promotions going on."
Too noisy to enjoy,"Atmosphere was appalling as acoustics are SO bad in this restaurant. It was lunchtime, full house & I couldn't hear myself speak! The noise was bouncing off the walls & the waiter had to lean a bit too close to me & raise his voice almost to a shout, for us to communicate.

Food was not memorable, just average Italian food. Nothing more to say."
Everything was great,Great place for lunch and a meal with the family. Excellent service and one of the few restaurants with the friendliest service staff. Food was cooked to perfection and very very appetising. Will definitely return to La Nonna!
