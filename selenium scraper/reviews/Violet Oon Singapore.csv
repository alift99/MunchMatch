My Best Experience,"The staff which attended to me are very experienced. She's from Thailand and very polite and when i ask her to recommend us some food as we have 4 pax, she's able to recommend us very well.
Also, the food was delicious. Actually, i brought my Hong Kong friends there and was recommended by my daughter. I'm a Singaporean but expatriate working oversea in both Hong Kong and China."
Nice place for tourist friends or nicer family meal,"Quite decent Peranakan food (nothing beats grandma’s home cooking) and not too pricey. However, give the kitchen staff at least 20mins to prepare the dishes and order your desserts just before you finish your mains so you don’t wait too long. Wouldn’t recommend the place if you’re catching a flight. Staff are friendly but surprisingly busy when there were only 5 tables occupied when we went at 1.45pm. Understaffed? Not attentive enough? Can’t say for sure.

Not fine dining but pricier than your normal restaurants. I’ll go there to host friends or a nicer family dinner. Satay and prata was the highlight for me personally. The family enjoyed everything else as well."
excellent service,service is excellent and food is great.. celebrated my husband’s birthday and Violet Oon gave us a little surprise with cake and a souvenir photo. thank you! :)
Great food as always!,"Always love the food, the taste is consistent and good. Great to bring foreign family members or friends to try different cuisines"
"Food is good, but atmosphere is not like a fine dining","I was there for lunch time, the staff is strictly not allowing us to come until the dot at 12pm.
When we arrived, one of the glass is a bit dirty/oily, after request, the staff replaced it.
All food are good and tasty.
However atmosphere is like a market, i don't really feel the luxury/fine dining."
Local Flavours with a Touch of Class,Was wow'd by the size of the chicken satay! The peanut sauce could be a little spicier. The curry fish prata was excellent. Worth every cent... Including the ice cream!!
Expensive but good food and great service,"We dined at Jewel - family of 4 adults with an overseas relative in transit. Busy but Prompt service and attentive staff. Food was a bit ex but very good. Ambience was perfect. Good place for special occasions. Perfect for us as we could treat our overseas visitor to a local meal, at a nice place. And as she was catching another flight, the efficient service was much appreciated."
"Thoughtful Staff, Immaculate Service",I went to celebrate my aunt's 87th Birthday and she's very happy with the food and the service. We requested a table away from a group of children and the staff gladly seated us in a quiet corner. Ordering was a breeze and the food came quite fast. The Beef Rendang really does melts in your mouth. So tender. The Chicken Satay was amazing too. The Dry Laksa is good and so does the rest of the dishes. Even the plain chicken rice is so fragrant on it's own. The birthday cake and the photo was a very nice gesture to end a wonderful meal.
Super bad service!,Bad service! The waiter and waitress here are not welcoming. No one came to check on us or even refill our water. The food taste is so so and we had to find our waiter to pay the bill. Not recommend!
Excellent experience,"Mother’s birthday lunch! The staff were very attentive, friendly and accommodating especially since we had 2 young children. Kudos to everyone - so rare to find such great service these days. Food was delicious especially the rendang, curry fish and prata. We had a such a great time. Will be back!"
Excellent service,Excellent restaurant service très efficace. Lovely ambiance with very friendly staff must visit if you are at jewel.
"Violet Oon - Jewel Changi Airport, Singapore: a great choice for family and friends to gather for a meal.","I visit Violet Oon at Jewel Changi Airport about twice a month, if I am not pulled away by other things. It is always a pleasant experience going there. The food and service is excellent. The pricing is also very reasonable when you consider the quality of food, attentive service and clean ambience. A place where both Singaporeans and visitors to Singapore will feel at home and have an enjoyable experience. Vegetarian options available.

(*Violet Oon has other restaurants at Ion Orchard and National Gallery, which I’ve been to a few times and are great too. However, I like going to the Jewel Changi Airport branch.)

Lavan"
Violet Oon Delivers!,"before flying out, we shared a great meal with our loving friends at V.O. Making a booking a V.O was easy enough via google assistant + chope. The restaurant interior is a pleasant reminiscent of the art deco. Food is superbe."
Good food but slow service,"Food was fantastic. Unfortunately, service is very slow. Ordered rice and it took like 15 minutes and 1 reminder to arrive. Ordered desert and it also took another reminder and another 10 or more minutes to arrive. The head waitress is ok but the rest were indifferent."
consistent good Pernankan cuisine,"Authentic peranankan dishes. Spicy where it matters. Lovely restaurant and good, prompt service by wait staff."
Insect bites and poor service,"Towards the end of my one hour dinner, I suddenly felt my back was very itchy. When I reached home, I found I had a few whaels on my back. One was as huge as one inch long. Please have the chairs cleaned.

Also, table was not set up when we were led to it and despite the reservation."
Quick Meal over a meeting,"During a transit stop I was able to enter Singapore and the Jewel to meet up for a work meeting at this great restaurant.
My wonderful clients set this up and ordered all the food as I had limited time but I can say it was all amazing. We had a great selection of items and the tastes were amazing and lingered in a very nice way.
Great surroundings and very nice staff so would certainly recommend this if you are in The Jewel at the airport and have the time."
Dry Laksa Was So Good,"After wandering around Jewel after arriving in Singapore my first meal was at Violet Oon since it was awhile since I last ate in one of her restaurants.

Due to the hour it was lightly crowded so I was quickly seated.

Inside the decor was nice with a large tea bar. It felt like one could linger awhile and just hang out here.

The Nonya, Peranakan and Singaporean menu offered a lot of choices but if only I had a bottomless stomach.

I chose the dry Laksa and that was a great choice. Large prawns, rice noodles and bean sprouts was lightly coated with Laksa gravy. It was light with some heat and delicious.

Service was on point throughout the meal.

Worth a return visit."
Highly recommended,"One of our favourite restaurants for quality Peranakan food, cozy ambience and friendly service. Highly recommended!"
Excellent service by Jerry,"I bought my aunt there for ber bday lunch and was given an exceptional surpirse by jerry who served us w so much patience, pleasantness and warmth. he took many pics for us, and surprise my aunt w a dessert w candle and also our photo framed w violet oon’s card frame. i merely ask if we can have a better seat as its her bday and he remembered and return to confirm its its her bday and then gave her all this surprises. she was so happy and said it made her day."
An indulgence,"Beautiful restaurant and food. Very indulgent, perfect treat for special occasions. You obviously pay for the splendour and experience. The food while lovely, can be replicated elsewhere at more affordable prices. If I must pick, would prefer the National Kitchen at the"
Authentic Peranakan food,"We, party of 3, ordered a starter, kueh pie tee, and 3 dishes, ikan goreng chili, buah keluak ayam and chap chye, to share. The ikan goreng chili was spicy and shiok (delectable). They served 3 candlenuts, one for each of us, in the buah keluak ayam dish. For desserts, we had pulut hitam with coconut ice cream. It was thick and just nice to share among 3. Ambience was nice and family friendly. Overall, we would return."
Bland and uninteresting,Fresh ingredients but not authentic. Sauces and flavors are bland and uninteresting. Simple chup chye not braised enough and weird selection of vegetable for it. No complexity of Peranakan food.
Excellent Lunch !!!,"I am a fan of VO's Peranakan food & mostly visited the branch @ National Gallery.

I decided to check out the branch @ Jewel with my friend, his 1st visit to VO's restaurant..
The restaurant has plant base menu which is most suitable for my diet :)

We ordered :
- Vegetable Curry with Roti Prata
- Dry Laksa
- Meatless ball with rendang source.

The food was served promptly.
The roti prata was crispy on the outside & fluffy inside & the vegetable curry was full of flavour with varieties of vegetable (tomato, eggplants, cabbage, okra). It is comforting & delicious and i absolute love it.
The meatless ball with redang source is my all time favourite that i must order during each visit.
The dry laksa was full of intense flavor & reflect a true peranakan dish.

The service was impeccable, staff was polite & friendly.
My friend was super impressed overall & we had an excellent lunch.

We did not order any dessert as i found from previous multiple visits @ national gallery , the dessets are too sweet for my taste.

Although the price is on higher price range, it is worth it!

If you are a vegetarian or even non vegetarian, do check out their plant base menu, you will not be disappointed !

Will i be back ? YES YES

Great Ambience,Ambience is great. Taste is good. Service staff knows the their food and gives good recommendations.
Service was good,"Service was good and always love their food. However, the serving of food was slow that day. We almost finished our rice and side dishes, but main dishes was not ready."
good food and service,good quality food and warm and friendly service!!good quality food and warm and friendly service!! good quality food and warm and friendly service!!good quality food and warm and friendly service!!
"Great food, wonderful attentive service","The food was great! We ordered quite a number of starters eg ngoh hiang, chicken satay, udang goreng, kueh pie tee etc. The chicken satay was awesome, ngoh hiang very flavourful but the tahu goreng was a bit disappointing. Our friends from London were impressed with the shepherd pie and pulut hitam. Special mention must be given to the staff who were attentive to our needs and gave very good suggestions when taking our orders. Definitely well worth the money spent on this meal"
Great meal great service,"I rarely give a restaurant 5 out of 5, however this restaurant met most of my expectations. The desert was to die for, Malaka ice cream! Nasi Goreng was very good. I would recommend this restaurants for everyone but business people who have busy meeting loads.
The only real negative was the online booking. We wanted 1pm, and the restaurant wanted us seated at 12:30 or 1:30. That meant us having to rearrange business meetings. It would be good if that restriction could be taken off. Enjoy"
Lunch,"I visited the the at Jewel, atmosphere is but food variety very limited. The staffs are friendly and nice."
Amazing food paired with excellent service.,"What a delightful experience! Dishes were wonderful, service was excellent. Do come here if you want to try some local food, and if not sure which one to pick, just ask the lovely staff and they will definitely recommend the best that suits your preference."
A nice family lunch,"Beautiful interior, polite staff and prompt service. Nyonya food was nice. Ngoh Hiang was lovely, the Rendang and Ayam Buah Keluak were nice but, unnecessarily spicy which took away some the flavour from the dish. I did not try the sugee cake but, we opted for the pulut hitam instead. It was nice but, a bit too sweet. All in all a delightful experience and worth another visit to try some other stuff :)"
Great business dinner,Nice ambience and great service! Unfortunately the rain vortex was not open to public and we couldn’t show our visitor to this wonderful attraction.
Family dinner visit,Good atmosphere and staff are very friendly and approachable. Food is excellent and will definitely visit again!
Not cheap but very “powerful” nyonya cuisine,"I had the best beef rendang in my life here. The udang prawn lemak was superb too. Chap chye was aromatic and fulfilling. To top it, I had a most amazing gula melaka ice cream with coconut shavings and cashew nut bits.

Service staff was very attentive.

A most memorable visit it was."
Good service,Good service with tentative staff. Atmosphere is great with very nice finishing. But food portion can be bigger esp for family diners.
Poor staff,"Front of house explained to us that as there are three of us (my wife, myself and our 4 year old child) we would have to sit on separate tables. We are used to this so agreed. However she insisted that we sit a long way apart but then proceeded to put me on a table less than a metre away from another couple whom I had never met!

Guys, use your common sense - I spend 24/7 with my wife and child, so putting me bang next door to two complete strangers is quite ridiculous and puts me at greater risk than I’d be if I was nearer to my family.

Anyway we won’t be coming back when pause 2 ends. The service at Violet Oon was only any good when they temporarily employed some out of work Singapore air hostesses; now it has returned to normal."
Great service,The staff are very friendly & good customer service experience. The water was refilled automatically without us raising our hands. The good is delicious & I would definitely recommend to my friends!
Amazing roti prata and yummy gula melaka cake,"I recently dined at Violet Oon during a shopping trip to Jewel, early on a Sunday evening. The atmosphere and decor is lovely, and so was the service. I was attended to by a number of people during my dinner, and all of them were warm, friendly and helpful, and very attentive, refilling my water regularly and ensuring my next courses were prepared as I finished the previous one. The food was also very good, the crispy kurobuta pork fingerlings were particularly enjoyable, crispy outside and very moist and tender inside. The accompanying sauce was too spicy for me and though the server kindly offered me an alternative I didn't need it, there was so much flavour in the rest of the toppings. For my main I had the chicken curry, and even though the chicken was a bit dry, the sauce was intensely flavourful, and deliciously rich and creamy, and the roti prata it was served with was amazing, hot and crispy and full of flaky layers, just divine! I managed to find room for their gula melaka teacake, which was also excellent, moist and dense, and I loved the crumble on top, and the cold coconut ice cream that paired perfectly with the warm cake. Overall a very tasty meal, and a place I would return to, for more of that exceptional prata!!"
Ambience was good! but food was poor! Not upto standard as review,"Ambience was good for my business lunch. but disappointed as the food was terrible! My 1st visit which also will be my last visit! Curry chicken with no curry taste, potatoes was hard, chicken breast meat super dry."
Birthday celebration at Violet Oon Jewel,The food was wonderful and Ivory service was so awesome. She recommended us the dishes was fantastic and she was so attentive and when she get to know we are celebrating my friend Diana's birthday she arrange for a complimentary birthday cake for her a surprise birthday photo card.
Peranakan Food,"Authentic peranakan food. The taste is good with nice ambience. Love the satay. Well... With regards to the service, I guess they can do better."
dinning,Gd food and worth the value of money it will be better if some dishes like Satay if no of sticks can be chosen.
Must remember to order the right dish,"This is my third visit to Violet Oon @ Jewel. The previous 2 lunches were fabulous. But, we make the mistake to order the ""wrong"" dish in this third visit. We ordered the oily tumeric chicken wing (really very oily) and pork chop (not so special, guess I am expecting the pleasant surprise like the rendang beef). Good that the pulot hitam dessert saved the meal..."
Anytime again!,"We loved the Bukit Timah outlet and wanted to try the one at Jewels. lt was well worth the trip and every cent, especially the Riesling from the Mosel region."
Delightful lunch,"Food, delicious. Presentation, meticulous. Service, gracious. Good job! Some portions were a tad small but overall, price is reasonable."
Birthday celebration,The staffs were very friendly and provided good services. We have been to this restaurant several times and it never disappoint us.
Excellent service!,Excellent service and good recommendation of food for first timers. Thanks to Syarif & Natasha for making my birthday lunch celebration a very pleasant one :)
Visit to Violet's,Restaurant was clean n nice ambience. Staff service was attentive Food standard n presentation was good too.
"Great place, nice good, attentive service.","We were there celebrating my mum’s birthday. The staff were attentive and food was served promptly. Food wise, 2 of the must try is their Beef Rendang and Chicken Satay.

Just when we are about to leave, they quickly told us that they have a cake for us. It was a unique birthday cake and they even print out a photo for us as a souvenir.

Great place, nice food, attentive service."
"Local classics, done perfectly!","Service was great, food was perfectly done. Never knew my usual lunch dishes could taste so good! The set lunch was definitely worth it!"
"Good food, ambience and service!","Everything we ordered was good.
I highly recommend the beef rendang, chicken satay (the portion per stick was big), kueh pie tees.

The restaurant was very pretty. Ambience was good and service staff were friendly and efficient.

My friends and I were very happy and satisfied."
Great Ambience,Amazing staff. It was my husband’s birthday and I brought him there for lunch and they surprised him. Awesome service
Looking for good food and service at Jewel,"First time trying out Violet Oon Singapore eatery at Jewel. The dishes ordered such as beef rendang and babi pongteh were very good. So was the veg curry with roti prata. A bit pricey - then again, it's because of the brand name."
FANTASTIC !!!,"Visited Violet Oon on Monday afternoon and ordered two sets of ""Weekday Set Lunch"". The food was fantastic and the service was tip top. Made a small request for my partner's birthday and the team surprised her with complimentary dessert. Definitely recommended, thumbs up !"
Great place for dinner!,"Service is warm and friendly. Although it is not cheap, the food is yummy and presentation is nice. Great restaurant!"
Excellent service,Service was excellent and they gave a complimentary birthday dessert. Food was on point although it's a bit pricey.
Great Dinner,We really enjoyed the food. And it was a great place to celebrate my brother's birthday. Best peranakan food for me!
Birthday dinner,"Very good service, tasty food. Can be pricey, some portions can be small if you've got a big appetite."
'Made-to-Feel-At-Home' Service,"visited this Peranakan restaurant on 23rd Dec 2020 for a nice dinner. Was attended to by a young & new Service Staff, Assistant Manager Syarif.

Syarif was very pleasant & courteous and made my friend & me felt so welcome to dine there. We really enjoyed a great meal there that night & will certainly wanna come back again!

o yes, young Syarif was also getting married few days, 27th Dec 2020! congrats on your big day young man!"
Excellent meal and service,"A family birthday celebration dinner was made that much more special with the pairing of excellent food and terrific service. All of the dishes we ordered were very well prepared. Highly recommend the rendang and for vegetarians, the veggie curry with roti prata. The wait staff were very attentive and helpful from ordering and throughout the entire meal. A special thanks to the assistant manager Syarif who tried to make the evening special for our birthday celebrant."
Service with the extra mile,"I have always been a huge fan of Violet Oon @ Jewel, but it has been ~a year since I visited this outlet due to the pandemic. Decided to catch up with a friend to celebrate her birthday there.

Asked Syarif (who turned out to be the Assistant Manager) if they did any kind of birthday celebration. He told me he had it all covered, and that he just wants us to have a fantastic meal (and not to concern myself over it).

Of course - the food @ Violet Oon didn’t disappoint. Love the Kueh Pie Tee!!

But really, the service was just what brings the place to the next level. You just feel so comfortable being there, with the staff so attentive to your every needs, and always with a smile on their face.

We really appreciate the service rendered - I can’t praise the staff enough. Of course, one would expect nothing less from an restaurant that’s situated in the World’s Best Airport :’).

I would like to once again thank Syarif and his team for making my meal (and night) such a wonderful one!

P.S. When I asked Syarif for his name so I could write a proper review (sorry this is kind of belated!!), he immediately said that it was a team effort, and everybody was involved (in making sure the celebration for my friend went smoothly). I was honestly so touched - that’s exactly how a leader should be; acknowledging the hard work and importance of every team member :)

I can’t wait to be back!"
Experience,Feedback: Food was good as usual but prawn chili was a bit too spicy which causes one of our guests to have diarrohea the whole night
Great ambience with superb service of an awesome team serving members,"We had a splendid dining experience at Violet Oon for a birthday celebration last weekend. Syarif (Asst Mgr), together with Christian (Restaurant Mgr) and other team members Tisha, Chloe, Carman & Alvin were absolutely fabulous, making our celebration even more memorable. The dedication to great service is highly commendable, especially for Mr Syarif. Thank you for the great dining experience at Violet Oon Jewel, we will definitely come back for more :)"
Delectable Peranakan food with a superb service,"We were waited mostly by Syarif, the new Asst Manager at VO Jewel. Firstly, I love the deco and ambience. The food is really delicious - they make one of the best Kuay Pie Tee ever and I’ve never had such a flavoursome chicken curry before. Syarif was great and attended to our every need esp with our young son. He kept checking on us with a smile and was spot on with food recommendations. Thank you for the very enjoyable food experience. We’ll definitely come back for more."
Great ambience and friendly staff who catered well to my family.,"If you have a baby in tow and yet craving for good food, this is a good place to go! Great food,ambience and world class service staff."
Fantastic food and service!,"Syarif and his team (Darrel Tisha Christian and Dyn) were absolutely delightful. The service was top notch, and they made a birthday celebration even more enjoyable. The food was fantastic of course. Highly recommend the dry laksa and the desserts.

We were also 20min late on a public holiday, and they held the table for us. This is really much appreciated!

On a side note I also saw Syarif help out a parent struggling to tame his 2 kids. Really went the extra mile, and made a stressful situation better. 5 stars for being patient, and a thoughtful human being!

Thanks!!"
Great Food and Excellent Service,"Visited with 2 young kids in tow and they kindly acceded to our request for a quieter corner. Colouring materials provided while waiting for food to be prepared. The food was great as usual! To top it off, they gave us a complimentary dessert (with birthday candle) knowing that it was a birthday celebration. Very thoughtful and unexpected! Will definitely visit again."
Nice ambience restaurant with excellent food quality & service,It was an enjoyable meal being served with delicious and tasty peranakan food by a group of well trained and groomed staff. Highly recommend for all to dine here !
immaculate service,"every dish served was amazing and we ordered the recommended dishes, nothing left us disappointed. loved the fish curry with roti prata and the babi pong teh"
Food met expectation and service is awesome.,Not a fan of perankan food but was satisfied with the taste of the food when it came. The service was awesome too.
"Great food, good people","the ambience is good, and the staff were very well mannered. The assistant manager Syarif did a fantastic job to make sure we enjoyed our time there. He was very hospitable and spontaneous throughout our meal. He led a wonderful team of servers too, and overall it was a comfortable experience. The food recommendations turned out great. Well worth the money."
A unforgettable and joyous dinning experience,"Food quality is fantastic with good serving time. Warm and attentive services provided by assistant manager Syarif and service crew members like Tisha, Debbie, Natasha, Brittany and Danial have collectively made our dinning experience a wonderful one. And thoughtful enough to create a birthday cake made up of desserts to help celebrate one of friends birthday. Thanks all for the heart warming services."
Good Taste & Lots of Variety,It has been good experience having our lunch there that we went back almost weekly. Food taste good and variety is good. Ambient is also different and nice atmosphere. Waiter and Waitress are good and attentive as they come around to top up our water.
Contemporary pernankan restaurant,"It was our first visit to Violet Oon's restaurant. Casual cafe type ambiance with lovely green/gold accents. We ordered the kurobuta pork fingerlings, sambal eggplant, chicken rice, black pepper prawn pasta and ngoh hiang. We loved the different sambals as dipping sauces for the appetisers. They really paired well. We ordered the gula melaka cake but was informed it was not available since Jan. Ordered the pineapple upside down cake which was disappointing in that it took so long to arrive, and was too sweet with the addition of the sauce which tasted like a combination of condensed and evaporated milk. Overall good dining experience if you're looking for a safe intro to peranakan food."
Excellent food and service,"We booked a table for 4 for my mom's birthday. Great peranakan food, and excellent and attentive service by assistant manager Mr Syarif. We were given a table with a view of part of the vortex - note that the water sounds make the background slightly noisier but we had no issue with that and were happy to catch glimpses of the evening light show. My mom was pleasantly surprised by the cake and candle from the restaurant - perfect execution and a really nice gesture. Thank you, and we'll certainly be back again."
"Good food, good service, good ambience","Decided to give Violet Oon a try and certainly wasn't disappointed with the Jewel outlet. Price, quality and quantity were all desirable. Especially liked the beef rendang, dry laksa and ngoh hiang. The chicken curry was quite good too. Service was prompt, and staff were efficient and polite, without being intrusive. Overall great experience and would certainly go back again."
Excellent service,Beautiful and classy dining ambience after a scenic stroll at Jewel's iconic rain vortex. Lovely Peranakan cuisine at affordable prices. Excellent service staff who are very attentive and friendly even with difficult customers (Mr Syarif). Def a must visit!
"Great Food, Cozy Place can find at Violet","Great food, cozy ambiance and with friendly staffs who are assisting all their guest in a respectful manner with smiles in tbeir voice and faces."
Good Service and Ambience,The service staff did a good job and is very attentive. Food was served slightly slow but may be due to lunch hours. The dry laksa was too salty to me but other food are good. Satay is very nice!
Finally tried Violet Oon's Peranakan food!,"I was attracted by the very classy facade and ambience of Violet Oon Jewel, every time I walked past it. Finally yesterday, my family and I decided to give it a try. The dishes we ordered were simply delectable! Every dish was a gastronomic delight and visually pleasing. My personal favourite was the beef rendang!

We were also pampered by the attentive staff, who were pleasant and helpful. We were impressed by the high level of customer service rendered by the staff, particularly the Assistant Manager Mr Syarif, whom we found out, was only 4-day-old in this restaurant. I fully agree with Ms Doreen T, whose recent Tripadvisor review stated that Mr Syarif is an asset to this restaurant. Mr Syarif knew the menu well and recommended us Kueh Beng Kah and Pulot Hitam, which my family simply loved! He added that Violet Oon has 4 outlets so that when we are in town next time, we will not miss a great Peranakan meal. He also gave credit to his fellow colleagues for the great customer service, which I thought was admirable because this shows that the staff are united as one, have great team spirit.

This is one restaurant you don't want to miss. Oh yes, you must order the heavenly gula melaka ice cream too! I am going back with my family soon to celebrate my husband's birthday at the end of this month! Can't wait to try my favourite dishes again."
Dinner at Violet Oon Jewel,"Food was great, ngoh hiang, kueh pie tee and fish curry with prata deserved special mention. Service was excellent too. Assistant manager, Mr Syarifuddin, paid attention to our needs and ensured that we dined in comfort. Thank you Mr Syarifuddin, you are definitely an asset to Violet Oon."
Don’t try the set lunch is not worth it.,"Tried the set lunch menu of $28++ per pax. It was a disappointment and not value for meal. You could be better off ordering aka cart order for decent serving and the price is not too far off from the set meal when there’s pax of 4. As the deserving is very small and it left us feeling unsatisfied with the meal. The starter if you choose tofu, it is just 4 it only comes with 4 thin slices. The mains are at reduced size from the ala cart menu like wise the desert. It is just a small slice of cake. It left us wondering what did we just eat and we ended up eating Song Fa to make our lunch complete. Imagine how bad the lunch was."
Good ambience,"Staff called to conform reservations earlier in the day, and when i was running late. I called to ensure that they do not release the table, and they were helpful. Food was good quality and ambience & decor was impressive."
"Good food, excellent service","Good food, excellent service, good ambience. Definitely worth dining with family and friends. Highly recommended"
Drop in food quality,"I went to the jewel outlet for dinner and arrived at a relatively empty restaurant. I ordered the ayam buah keluak and chap chye. Unfortunately, the ayam buah keluak had a strong frozen chicken taste and the chap chye was undercooked, watery and tasteless. This is a far cry from the quality I previously experienced at the bukit timah branch a couple of years ago. At this price point the restaurant badly needs to improve their food standards or they risk being unworthy of carrying the “violet oon” brand name."
Great Peranakan food!,It was great service and very flavorful food. They were very thoughtful and generous with gifting desserts as the reservation remarks indicated birthday celebration. Overall a great place to have a meal!
Excellent food but no bar service even for non alcoholic beverages,Love the food and quality was maintained even with less patrons. The only regret is cannot order drink even non-alcoholic beverages due to Corvid-19.
Simply full filling,"Came over to celebrate my mum's birthday during lunch at Jewel Changi. Ambience was good with soft jazz music. Setting of this restaurant was classic as shown on my photos posted. More importantly, food was delicious. Worth the try is their satay which comes in big chunks of meat. Overall, worth revisit ing"
Delicious food in beautiful surroundings.,The staff are very welcoming and attentive. The decor is lovely and it feels very special. The food is delicious and served beautifully as are the drinks. The menu has a great selection of choice. I am vegetarian and there were several choices.
Great food & service,"The servers were very attentive.
Food is served fast and of quality!
We ordered 1 lunch set which consist of Taohu Goreng, Dry Laksa & a Tapioca dessert.
We also ordered an additional Kueh Pai Tee & Satay..
The portions were of good size.
Its definitely worth making a trip all the way to Jewel for it."
Excellent dinner,"Great food, nice ambience. Service was excellent, service staff even prepared a surprise birthday cake for my dad when we were about to make payment. Really good experience. I am never a fan of Peranakan food, but Violet Oon has made me changed my mind :)"
Love the food and great service team,Love the food and tried all dishes. I wish there are new dishes to be added into the menu and more choices for the set lunch.
Nice service and great food,Very satisfied with food and service. Went there for my friend’s birthday. We totally enjoyed our lunch.
A belated birthday lunch with my childhood galfriend 🎂,"It was my gal friend’s 1st visit to the restaurant, whereas I’ve been to the one @ Ion for hi-tea. Set lunch was priced reasonably, variety was good & portion was just right. Ambience & service was good too. Will bring her for hi-tea @ Ion next time."
Enjoyable Lunch Experience,"It was our first time here and chose the set lunch at $28++ per pax.

We enjoyed the food especially the melt-in-your-mouth Beef Rendang and the Kueh Beng Kah with a dash of santan and gula melaka. The Curry Chicken was ordinary but the accompanying Roti Prata was soft and crispy without the oiliness.

Natasha service was excellent. She was attentive, friendly and well-groomed. So, we were not surprised (we asked her) that she is a SQ flight attendant and temporarily working here (with the help from SIA) due to the current pandemic which has impacted the aviation industry.

We had requested for seats with a view of The Vortex prior to coming but was disappointed upon arrival that it was not available due to maintenance. Otherwise, the overall rating would be higher."
Nice food and Nice Ambience,"Surprised by the short menu but it’s quality over quantity. Overall food was good and there were veg options. Drinks menu also good. Prices on the high end. As it was my hubby’s birthday, it was still worth it. We also found the staff pleasant to chat with. Liked the artefacts on the wall, especially Ms Oon’s old recipe book."
"Great food, great ambience",Love the restaurant setting. The lunch set is value for money and the food is nicely presented. The beef rendang is delicious.
"Good ambience, service and food","Even though it may seem pricey, the portion was reasonable. Staff was very friendly as well. Recommend to visit for quality Singaporean food."
Set lunch,Set lunch is value for money. Will be good if dessert also got more than 1 selection. Will visit again.
