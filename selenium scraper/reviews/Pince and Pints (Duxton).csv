great experience,"very tasty and the lobster pieces were huge and juicy. portions were also sufficient, well-worth the amount spent there."
Excellent Lobster Roll,"Reasonably priced lobster roll. Very meaty and fresh. Price was ok, good for celebrations! Get extra butter sauce to make it more savoury!"
Good food reasonable price,"For $60 there aren’t too many places in Singapore you can get fresh lobsters. There’s nothing fancy about the dish, but I just like the classic way of preparing lobster"
Very good grilled lobsters,Lobsters are meaty and delicious. We asked for extra butter sauce too ✌🏻 Service is prompt too. Excellent dinner.
Best birthday lunch,Ambient and service is good! Food taste marvellous. In fact is better than burger and lobster! Will recommend to friends and family.
Nice Visit,"Food is excellent, service staff is nice & friendly. Was given complimentary ice-cream when i mentioned it was my hubby birthday"
Lobster experience,The Lobster was awesome... Better than lobster and burger at jewel. Will go back there if time allows.
Good,The lobster roll is good here but it's pretty pricey considering how much lobster you actually get in the roll. If you have a craving thought it hits the spot and service is speedy so expect to be at least $70-80 down and you'll only be there for about 45mins!
Splurge a little,"If you have plans to spend a little more for a meal, this is a nice little joint for that. The seafood was very fresh especially the lobsters. The lobster roll was nice but I think the lobster flesh was over powered by the sauce on top. You can skip the mussels tho’. The mussel itself was cooked perfect but the sauce, soup, or gravy was disappointing it tasted really just like waster with garlic."
Loved it!,Loved it. Service and food were great! Loved the chilli lobsters and the truffle mushroom soup. Definitely will come back again.
Big & Small,"Service is excellent as the female waitress was pleasant with a smile and attentive to change our plates a few times when our plates were full of shells.
I find the grilled lobster too small with very little meat whereas the lobster with noodles was much bigger; just nice! The noodles is a wet version with lots of gravy which did not have a lobster fragrance."
Sweet Escape,"Was there on a Monday evening for a small dinner celebration of 2. We were greeted by sweet Toni, the ambience was just nice. I was expecting a crowd but perhaps it’s Monday hence we had almost the entire place to ourselves with a few other diners. It’s our first time and we’re quite satisfied with the lobster roll and grilled lobster. Will visit again!"
Excellent quality and service!!,"It’s a small bistro style restaurant so We didn’t expect too much. Once we had say done, the whole experience from food quality, to wine option and waiting service (and the speed of serving food), we were IMPRESSED!"
WIfe Birthday Celebration,Celebrated wife birthday at Pince and Pints. Food overall is good. Staff were attentive and friendly. Was given a complimentary dessert for the celebration.
Lobster place,Great place for lobsters. It’s my 2nd time here and it is still fantastic. Did not try the other seafood dishes.
A place for lobster,"Nice place for lobster, lobster roll is same price as lobster. It was good! Staff is very helpful!!!"
Fresh lobsters!,The lobsters were the sweetest and freshest that I've ever tasted. Will visit again. Portions were generous too.
Yummy,"So far the lobsters taste was great.. services good, location abit far n isolate.. restaurant environment was nice and cosy.. overall great experience.."
Great Atmosphere with good food,"Great food and friendly staffs! First time visiting this restaurant, lobster 🦞 are fresh and yummy!Definitely will visit again !"
Pince & Pints at Duxton,"Come, visit Pince and Pints at Duxton. It was my first time at Pince and Pints with a friend last week at around 630pm and I am glad we were there early as the crowd starts to get in by 7-730pm. We had grilled lobster and a steam crabs plus the truffle mushroom soup which was super delicious. Food arrived in very good order and the service staff were kind and polite to inform us to redeem Chope voucher before the visit as this will provide a further 25% discount which made the bill reasonable. Lobster was served with nice fries and the steam crab with egg is just light for the stomach. I would recommend anyone who is a seafood fan to visit PINCE & PINTS. Good for couples, friends and family but for business it is quite noisy."
A great birthday celebration at Pince & Pints (Duxton),Toni service is fantastic. She's attentive to our needs & serves with a smile. We had a great time !
"Full stomach, happy thoughts","With the recent update of menu from my last visit, they have stepped up their game in bringing serious lobster business!"
DINNER ON 16th March 2019,"food is nice, services is good also. But price a bit in high side. As for the loster roll the price is not world for it..."
Pince and pints,"Oysters were badly shucked. In bits and pieces. After we complain, one was changed. Roll was cold. Standard seems to have dropped"
Still good after all these years!,Been a long time since I last patronize this restaurant. Quality and serving of food still that great! Thank you!
Saturday dinner,"Our this week Saturday dinner at at Pince and Pints which serve delicious lobsters. We ordered the lobster roll, steam lobster and lobster soup.

I have to say the lobster is authentic and is not over cooked. Even the fries are great. Generous Chuck's of lobster meat in a butter bread aka lobster roll. My wife chose to go with the safer route of steam lobster and she enjoyed it.

A good place to dine if you are a lobster lover!

"Good food, steep price.","Truffle and black pepper lobsters were both of amazing freshness and quality! Portions were rather generous and it was actually good for two. The steep price would probably deter me from returning as much as I want to, but you definitely need to give this a try. Very close to Burger and Lobster in London."
an awesome experience,feel totally in love with that balsamic sauce from the salad. and of course the lobsters were totally on point!
Great food and great service,Lobster was fresh and relish. Enjoyed the meal and service was very friendly. Was one of the first to arrive hence we were well taken care of.
The taste who always surprises all my accompanies,"Visited this place number of time . The taste never let you down and I’ll Glad that all my Friend love the lobster and it was fresh ! Happy to know that the service there is getting better compared the very 1st time that I visited . The 2 friendly ladies always put their warm and sincere smile unlike the previous guy that I met , rude !"
Excellent Food! Ok service.,"One of the best Lobster Salad sandwiches I have ever had! The fries were hot and delicious, salad was fresh and dressing was amazing! the service was slow and had to keep asking for water. Took a long time for food to arrive at the table..."
Amazing food!,The chili lobster and lobster roll was beyond amazing. The staff wee friendly too. only setback was waiting time.
Service saved the day,"Lobsters were small in size and not meaty. Not worth it for such price.The sauces were good though, need to top up $5 for truffle sauce if you finished the 1st serving.Only the good service saved the day."
Great service & quality food,It was my second time at P&P (Duxton) and the food did not disappoint. Service was prompt and great as usual (in addition to the other round where they made arrangements to help me with a voucher that was bought for Duxton to be used at Katong branch). I would say the server had gone out of her way to help! Thanks!!
A rewardingly eye opening experience,"On a sunny Thursday afternoon, I came here with a couple of colleagues to ‘reward ourselves’. At lunch, the restaurant was painfully quiet, save for the ghostly moans of the lost souls of the lobsters, long decomposed beneath their ancestral graves. We ordered lobster noodle (Chinese/Asian style), The signature lobster roll and lobster Mac and cheese. Lobster noodle was hands down more salty than the Dead Sea. To be fair, the Mac and cheese matched up just as good as its frozen namesake from the next door convenience store. Portions for all dishes were so hauntingly petit, it’s as if the restaurant is trolling you for even deciding to step in. The signature lobster roll was as small as your own signature on the exorbitant bill of 174 for 3 pax, of which signing the bill was indeed a rewarding experience in itself, as I dreaded the extent of financial belt tightening I needed to do in the months to come."
Lobster and Chips!,"Lobster was very soft, I had never eaten lobster cooked in that way before which was refreshing.
The lobster roll was very pleasing and was fried and dipped in butter.
The watermelon juice tasted off, like it had expired and I did'nt enjoy it.
The chips were not frites, but slightly larger and not quite as crisp as we would have expected.
Table service was'nt brilliant, we had to get the attention of the waitress several times.

All in all, it was a good meal, but this is not a top-end establishment as we had first thought."
Excellent!,"Friendly staff! The restaurant was quite empty when it opened at 5.30pm as most people have not knocked off from work. If you want to avoid crowd, do visit before 6.30pm. ☺️ Food was excellent too!"
So-So,"Service wise, they really need to buck up. The restaurant was not full at all, we were the 3rd occupied table, but still service was kinda slow. Food wise, I do like that there are some new local additions to the initial menu, when i first visited last year. But for me, the food was just kinda average, nothing memorable."
Disappointing,"Been a fan of their lobster roll since they started, but my recent visit to P&P was very disappointing. The bread was soggy, lobster was kinda tough and nothing special about the salad dressing."
Great food and great service,"The staffs were friendly and the ambience was great. The wait wasn't too long before my food came. The food tastes great, no complains at all. Recommended to this place by a friend, was able to enjoy $20 off my total bill thanks to JioJioMe."
Great celebration,"Had a birthday celebration here, food is good and service was awesome. Would definitely visit again!"
Ambrosial Experience,"The lobster roll is mouthwatering and savory, overall a great meal with great ambience! The Lobster Noodles has a twist of asian noodles, which typically people would not expect at a lobster joint as they usually serve pasta with lobsters. However, the Lobster Noodles is well-prepared and distinctive which is tasteful at the same time. The staff here are friendly and helpful too. Would definitely recommend to anyone who hasn't tried it or to lobster lovers out there."
Great food and service,The staff prepared a foc dessert for my gf on the birthday. Good gesture and great food & service. Thumbs up.
One of the best,"Ordered grilled lobster, lobster roll, fresh oyster and garlic butter mussels. All of it were excellently tasty! Applause for the grilled lobster! We got what we paid."
Great dining experience,"We tried the chilli lobster w mantou. The food was really good, just a little pricey. The atmosphere of American diners setting was rather special too"
Great customer service,Staffs were friendly and approachable. Attentive to customer whenever we needed water or help. Food was pretty good too. But slightly too expensive.
Good food,"Tried the grill lobster, lobster roll and the chilli lobster.Did not like the chill lobster as it tasted ordinary, but was happy with the serving. Grilled lobster and lobster roll were good."
"Good food, though pricey","The restaurant has a retro ambience. The staff are friendly and attentive. Interesting menu which focuses on lobster as the main ingredient.

Ordered the mixed platter which comes in good portions for sharing, which I’ll recommend to be shared by at least 3. Also tried their lobster roll and lobster thermidor. Overall the food quality is good, but a bit too pricey. Will be a good place to dine for special occasions for the experience and food."
Great experience !,First time to Pince and Pints .Nice food with good service 😊.Will definitely recommend to friends and also go again .
Nice lobster... one of the best we had..,"Great service and food is nice.... but its not cheap.. for special occassions i guess. liked that they have increase repetoire to beyond lobsters to include calamari, mussels etc."
"Great service, average food","Service was great and I really enjoyed the truffle lobster roll! Can’t say much about the steamed lobster though, it was not fresh. The meat fell apart when I tried to extract it from the shell. :( Butter sauce served with the lobster was mediocre and bland. Also, we saw the suppliers bringing lobsters in a plastic bag from the front door to the kitchen.... hmm. Oh well, we have tried a similar concept in London and for the price I’m paying, this is not worth the price tag!"
Saturday Dinner,Terrible. The waiter was rude to us when he realised that we're not going to order drinks. Not visiting this place again.
Pince and Pints (Duxton) July 2018,"Happen to manage the reservation via Chope which surprise that friendly staff was called me for seat full and took initiatives for next available slot available. Friendly staffs along our dining experience! Lucky that we would not need long waiting time for dining and definite great dining experience. Food were great ever I ate LOBSTER. Worth to try and value for money. The lobster were really fresh steamed and the Singapore local chili lobster really nice to try.

Dining atmosphere were okay and not much crowd and noisy in the restaurant. Near to Tanjung Pagar MRT whig taking 10mins walk from station. Definitely will visit the store again in next 6 months!"
Duxton,"Duxton provide good foods .all food are fresh .we can order all type foods like Indian ,chines etc.."
Best lobsters ever!!!,Had a really scrumptious meal over at pince and pints and holyyyyy the lobster are so fresh and juicy!! The grilled lobster and chilli lobster is really good for sharing while the lobster roll is good for one. They serve really good milkshakes as well!
Stellar Lobster Roll,"Really enjoyed the truffle roll and lobster chowder, coming from someone who’s not a seafood fan! 😃"
perfect place for lobster lovers,"really love the the grilled lobster and lobster roll! Cravings satisfied, lobster lovers should really try this!"
Of quality but an absence of value,"I rate this restaurant very good because of the freshness of the lobster. The meal was nice and hearty and one attending waitress was particularly attentive, but to be honest, everything else borders on average.

PP has always been hyped about online and for years now I've been wanting to visit this place. When I finally went there today, I felt that the overall experience was lacking and underwhelming. It's one thing for social media personalities to be hosted at the restaurant- how easily they can sing praises of the place solely by the quality of the food but a real, paying consumer seeks real value in their bucks.

Apart from the quality and freshness of the food, there really isn't much value to this place. While air-flown lobsters are arguably costly, the price per meal is also admittedly expensive for the everyday Singaporean. The firm and fresh lobster meat was certainly a treat for the tongue, but by the end of the meal, one can't help but still feel underwhelmed because the portion weren't very filling. Isn't that sad?

it's not only about being pricey, but discerning diners with deep and deeper pockets alike are disgruntled about how this place fails to provide value."
Tasty but way too pricy!,"We ate at the outlet on East Coast Road. We almost decide to walk out of the resturant after looking at the menu. It’s is ridicously priced to the sky for such a place. However, we decided to still sit down and try a sandwich.
We ordered a lobster sandwich to share. It comes with fries and a small side salad. The lobster on the bread is average tasting. The price comes to sgd80 (usd 60) with 10% service and 7% Gst. We will not come back."
good place,good simple fare with a nice ambiance and not too expensive for this area.Service was attentive and grilled lobsters very nice
Great Experience,"The staff was prompt in serving us and was patient enough to recommend to us what was good. Took up on his advice and had the Lobster roll which was delicious! The sweet potato fries I chose also did not fail to impress me. All in all, I was satisfied with the service and the food. Will definitely re-visit again in the near future!"
Lobster set lunch,"I liked the lobster roll here when my Daughter brought voucher for me to dine here. This time I tried the half lobster set lunch which comes with drinks and generous mango sorbet. Seafood set lunch here from $28 onwards, our lobster set lunch cost $34 and $33 respectively. I liked the freshness of its lobster. Female Staff was observant, brighter the lighting for us to read"
Great Value & Always Delicious!,"This is our go-to lobster place. We have gone 5 times in the last 6 months and it hasn't failed us yet. Food is consistently delicious. Service is attentive, considered, even if it's a little cheeky. Ambience is lively. Must go for lobster-lovers on a budget. Don't forget to make reservations!"
Excellent service and best lobster roll,"I was on a lobster eating spree during my 2 days in Singapore, and the lobster roll I had here was one of the most delicious meal I had. Lobster was so fresh and was in big chucks, the dressing just right, not too rich and did not overwhelm the lobster taste. The dish came with the amazing garlic aoli. The waitress was a star, gave recommendations on what to order and drink ~ excellent! I had my dish with the very nyummy Duxton Mule"
Loving the Lobster Roll,The lobster roll was awesome. My friend enjoyed the bread more than the lobster though. But I thought it was both great :) Got the chope vouchers as well so that saved us some money. The meal is more than enough even though it might look small.
Birthday Celebration 21 Feb 2018,"Was recommended by a friend that this is a good place so we booked a table for 6pax on 21 Feb, 8pm. Ordered 6 main courses, a seafood platter, A dozen Oysters & Mussels & Lobster Chowder. Oh and a bottle of Riesling too. Loved the Mac & cheese as the portion is good. Tried the Chilli Lobster but finds the sauce too starchy for my taste. The mixed seafood platter is a disappointment as the deep fried calamari was dry and tasteless. The mussels we had didn’t taste too fresh either. My 2 friend has lobster roll & truffle roll which was not too bad. Lobster chowder was served lukewarm. Felt that it wasn’t hot enough. Overall, the dining experience was marred by the rude service of a Malay male staff that night who looked uninterested or can’t be bothered sort of attitude. Eg. when the food arrived at the table, he kinda shouted “Who ordered Lobster roll!!” His lack of attentiveness and that pissed-off face thru out our 1.5hours there makes it unbearable for all of us as we only wanted to have a good time to celebrate two of my best friends birthday. At one point ,we even had to get up and pour the remaining wine ourselves. This lack of attention to details & service level is definitely undesirable by any standard. And not mention at such high prices for the main. At least we should be getting some kind of service. With that bitter taste in the service rendered, we were eager to finish up ASAP and leave. ☹️ Not a place I’ll recommend unless they do something about that bad service. The place wasn’t even packed to begin with.

Impromptu dinner,"Served by a friendly guy. Intro us the recommended dishes and in the end, ordered a Lobster Roll and Mac & Cheese.

Lobster roll was good, the sauce that was provided with Lobster Roll was not sufficient for me to dip the fries. The fries that they used is “steak” fries or thick-cut fries which makes it not that crispy or crunchy compared to standard cut fries. It will be good if there is a choice for customers to choose which kind of fries they prefer to make it a plus point. Lobster roll was cut into half for easier eating which is also a plus point as I can pick up from the plate and eat it!

Mac and cheese was good! Portion is sufficient enough for 2 to share if both sharing pax appetite is not huge."
Good setting for an overpriced friends' night out - the truffle butter sauce is delicious though.,"Lobster dishes at either $58++ or $68++. Satisfying food. But overpriced for sure - recipes did not deserve their price tags, I feel. Atmosphere also very much like a bar (well, it is in the name) - so more suitable for a squeezy friends' night out with loud pop music than a romantic couple's lobster dinner on VDay. The truffle butter sauce is delicious though. Yum. Service - nothing special. 3/5"
Dinner at Pince & Pints,"Second time here. Crowd was lesser than my first time here. Perhaps because it was quite early, Food is good as usual. However service was a bit lacking on that day. Waiter's behavior looked pissed off since the very beginning, which kinda ruined the mood of the day."
"Not So Prompt Service, Oily Food",We were greeted by two staff that seems uninterested the moment we stepped in the restaurant. We had to wait for a while before we could get the attention of the staff to place order and even to make payment. The bread of the truffle lobster roll was clearly over grilled. Traces of oil could be seen in the bread. Staff did not even bother to check back on our food considering that it is our first time visit.
Over-rated & over-priced,"Visited the Katong branch with my Wife about 2 weeks ago. Bill came to approx $350 after ordering 1 lobster thermidore, 1 lobster role, 1 calamari, 1 lobster mac & cheese, 1 orange juice ($5, came from a box) and 1 cocktail.

Good: Mac & cheese was the best dish we had. Serving of lobster was generous in the lobster role (better be at $58). Quality of lobster in all dishes was very good.

Bad: restaurant finishing and atmosphere was really poor and cheap quality - doesn’t match the exorbitant fine-dining like prices. Service tries hard so thumbs up for the great attitude but is a bit awkward & poorly trained. Lobster thermidore is not a thermidore at all - thermidore should be creamy, this is dry with a crust of breadcrumbs and parmesan on top, which I suspect didn’t come out as intended. The flesh was also incredibly dry. Waste of good lobster.

Won’t be back."
Overpriced lobster,We ordered a lobster roll and chilli lobster along with 2 glasses of wine - that still left us with hungry stomachs. Dishes were quite small for the price paid. Nonetheless chilli lobster is quite a special dish to try in Singapore along with the fried mantou (although the chilli crab sauce was so-so). Seats were quite cramped so don’t expect to have a long dinner there.
Good food,Very nice and fresh lobsters! We had lobster roll and set lunch which is just right for the 2 of us. Attentive service too!
Best Lobster in Town,Value for money serving and the lobster was so fresh. The whole serving is just nice for my tummy. Will come here again when i visit SG next time.
Fresh lobsters but they take some time to come,"Came here for lunch when i managed to buy chope vouchers at a discount. Otherwise it would have been too expensive. Lobsters were fresh but they took abt 30-45 min to come, even when the place was only any 30% full."
Better than burgers and lobster I had in Manchester,"Food quality was great, probably due to the small seating size hence I feel that the lobster and chips tastes much more flavourful than Burgers and Lobsters. Chilli lobster and lobster rolls are really very good! Lychee ice tea was also to order list!
However lobster noodle was mediocre.

Do not understand the full attendance sitting policy. I have made reservation , table was empty when I went in. I ordered a fries but I felt like an unwanted child eating the fries outside of restaurant while waiting for my friends =_= Servers were professional but hopefully could serve a bit with a smile."
Not bad!,"Went on a weekday night and book via chope. Lobsters were really freshhhh! Two of the female staffs were so attentive and quick to respond to our needs. THANK YOU!! One male staff (looks like manager?) was a little rude, he put down the drinks with a big bang..? Did we own him money? Hmm... but other than that, it's a good experience :)"
Excellent service and food,"Great food, great service and great ambience! The steamed lobsters were very fresh and they allowed two portions of salads if you do not want fries. But their lemon butter sauce can be too buttery for liking."
Review,"Enjoyed the food which was yummy but, pricey. Will only go back if there's good discount vouchers by chope"
Great Food!,"The lobster were awesome, and this is our 3rd time that we are coming back to the restaurant. With the chope voucher, it was even more worth it."
Lobster all meals,Quintessential lobster restaurant bar at Duxton road which serves lobster meals only. Recommended to try the lunch set menu which comes with a drink and dessert
Over-rated,"Went there for the first time with friends to celebrate friend's birthday. I had high hope for that place since I heard so much about it especially the lobster roll. Well, it turned out to be such an over-rated restaurant both on the food and drinks. We ordered 4 different kinds of lobster and among the 4, chilli crab was the best."
Bad service,"Went there at 6.45pm, though my reservation is at 730pm, I asked if we could sit and order drinks first while waiting for 1 of our Friend. Waiter said nope, cause your table is not ready and reservation is at 730pm, you can sit outside if you want.
The restaurant was completely empty.

We went back at 720pm and placed our orders, service given by the ladies was ok. Bad service from the guys and host. They worked like they hate their job. With that kind of price tag, I’d gladly spent it elsewhere."
A Great Lobster Experience,"Have tried the outlet at Katong (Opp 112 Katong mall) due to reservation full at Duxton.
We have the Lobster roll, Live Whole Lobster steam, Lobster noodle and Chilli Lobster with Mantou. Each had its own speciality taste.
The Live Whole Lobster can choose between Steamed or Grilled, we chose steam to get the fullest out of the freshness of the lobster. The Chilli lobster us spicy and very appetizing. It go perfectly well with the mantou. *A bowl of rice would make it better for me.
The lobster noodle come with sambal chili. For people that like E-fu noodle, this is the perfect dish.
For the Lobster roll, the serving is just right for lady.
Overall Experiencing Lobster overdose.

The overall satisfaction is"
The go-to place for lobsters,"Third time coming back to Pince & Pints, and would come back again! Both my husband and I had the grilled lobster, which goes well with the butter sauce that comes with it. The size of the lobsters served seems to have shrunk a little though, which is slightly disappointing. Experience-wise, the wait staff could be a little more cordial, and the bathrooms can definitely be improved! The exhaust fumes seem to be emptied into the bathroom area so the smell lingers on your clothes a little after."
Pince and Pints,"Good experience, food was good too. However service can be further improved. Waiters keep drop our food."
MAC & CHEESE!,LOVE the mac & cheese (with lobster of cos) which was a surprise as it was a side accompanying our mains. Mains were well-cooked - the lobster roll was well buttered and seasoned. All in all a really good meal. Nice restaurant with an comfortable environment.
Birthday,Lobster burger is especially good! Good ambience and entertaining staff. Sweet potato fries is good!
Extremely bad service attiude!,Customer service is very important. I had a very bad experience with the staffs in this restaurant. Chilli lobster sauce is tasteless. Go at your own risk lololol
Superb lobster rolls,"Fresh lobster with well buttered buns, went there with a cousin of mine. I still remember his happy face while savouring the rolls. What more could we asked for!"
Great service,"Food was yummy, though there was a small lobster shell in the lobster roll. Service was awesome. Spent around $120 for 2 pax. Only for special occasions"
Food is good,Food is good. Service is good. Happened to have a big table beside us and was quite noisy as the space was confined.
Good lobster roll,"The lobster roll is really good. One of the better ones you can find in Singapore. My only complain is that the sweet potato fries is too soggy, very dissapointing. Lobster can also be in bigger portion? Like what you can get overseas. Taste wise food is good."
Delicious and nicely cooked lobsters,We went on a weekday and the lobsters were nicely cooked and the lobster roll was surprisingly tender and tasty. Although disappointed that water is now charged.
Pince and Pints,"Lobster was really fresh as we chose grill option.fries tasted real potato and is soft inside,crispy outside.starters are good too! We ordered calamari,we smell salted egg yoke but there wasn't.crispy but not oily,squid is very fresh"
great sea food,Pince and Pints is a nice place to try different sea type of sea food. very fresh and clean restaurant.
finally tried the famous lobster restaurant,"Was glad that I made a reservation to dine as it became a full house later on that Saturday night I visited. Lobsters were really fresh, they even help deshell the claw for my thermidor. Note that they don't serve tap water, so just save the effort from asking and order from their drink menu."
"Enemy of the environment! No tap water, only bottled mineral water.","We had grilled lobster and lobster roll at their Katong outlet. The food was fine, lobster a bit undercooked and not much favour. Salad was fresh and delicious. The resturant has two storey, normal bistro ambience on the ground floor with a bar. Service was efficient, but staff is not well trained and grossly under staff on the dinning floor. The see through kitchen should be covered as it was not that clean and pleasant to watch. It was about >$80 per head for a meal plus drink. Given the ingredient, it is fare value. What I was shocked is that they do not serve tap water at all, even when we are willing to pay for it. Only bottled mineral water. Don't they care about the negative environmental impact of bottled water? I will not return until they offer tap water. A matter of principle."
"Good Concept, average Execution","We were off to a bad start, when told that we could not buy tap water. We refuse to buy water that has been transported half way around the globe, when Singapore has some of the best tap water in Asia. Paying for the tap water is not the point, but availability is. They serve tap water in 3 star michelin restaurants!

We ordered a grilled lobster and a lobster roll, both were good, and the lobster was a good size, however the salad and chips portions were too small, so you really need to order a starter as well, and then it become more expensive.

The glass separating the kitchen from the restaurant needs to be clean."
"Average food, poor service","Went on a friday evening, not full house but the staff called to confirm my resevation. The staff then came over to take order, when we said we needed more time, he just stood behind and waited. The restaurant does not serve warm water, the waiter does not provides alternative when I requested for non caffeine warm drinks and simply walk away."
