Institution in Singapore,Truly a great place - fantastic Malay Indian on a banana Leaf. not to be messed - a culinary experience.
Terrible don’t go over rated,Super over rated! The food are worst than MOST hawkers centres.. chicken tikka is fried chicken?!!! What!!! Never go back again
Stomachache place,"Went thrice. Had stomachache twice. Will never visit again.

But if you have an iron stomach and crave for Indian spiced food, not a bad place to visit. Prices are reasonable for a location in dempsey. Lime juice is good, most other dishes are tasty too but the famous curry fish head is a little less than expected."
"Always good, Excellent place","Probably been there for few dozen times in last few years and food is always good.
This time the rice set with side of veggie and Rasam was as usual fantastic.
It was full house during Friday lunch time. Masala chicken was hard though, disappointing.
P
Ambience is great, a must visit restaurant in Singapore."
fish is not fresh and masala chicken is hard,"First when you arrive, you are greeted curtly to get your checking in done. Then they say ""you cannot share rice"" - so it doesn't matter how many dishes you order? That's really in poor taste. To top it off, the fish head curry was not fresh and the masala chicken was so hard, we had to order a drumstick in addition. The potato cutlet has a strange vegetable oil taste. It all just leave a very sour taste on my lips."
Always great !,"Great South Indian food. Sitting outside, we have enjoyed nice fish, squid curries, briyani rice on banana leaf with a good tiger ! What else do you want ??"
Tasty and rich indian food,We came here on Hari Raya Haji public holiday. They are normally closed on Tuesdays but decided to open today to cater to the holiday crowd but it wasnt crowded when we went for lunch. We had byrani and naan with masala chicken which was just about spicy enough for us. Washed it down with coconut water. Tasty and rich indian food for a treat once in a while.
Authentic Indian food,Authentic Indian food the Singaporean way. simple and easy. use your hands. one of the better ones in SG
A heritage establishment since 1935,"A heritage establishment since 1935. Popular with locals as well as visitors. Order and the food comes very quickly. The rice comes first, briyani or white. Ordered their curry fish head, chicken tikka, and butter, cauliflower, paneer( cottage cheese with spinach), black squid and naan( garlic and plain). Tastes was acceptable, nothing awesome but in general tasty Indian food. Lime juice, mango lassi was refreshing. Service is ok, whilst the environment is an open space in a colonial building. The floors looks kind of untidy just before closing. Price is mid range."
"Simple, normal ‘restaurant’","Simple , normal ‘restaurant’ in an up market area. Price wise reasonable but on the higher side. Place is ok - you will be taking the odour back after a meal especially if you’re seated inside . Food wise is good - the usual chicken tikka , Gobi, masala chicken , butter chicken , naan , and of course the white rice and briyani rice served with potatoes and daal. Mango or sweet lassi is ok - nothing to rave about here . Ambience is ok but wear proper shoes - not slippers - as the floor can be oily . Car park is abundance if you don’t mind walking. Overall - it’s good and worth a try and revisits. And yes - make an appointment as the place can be pretty busy ."
"Not impressed, average food","Food was average, fish head curry the meat was tough, find the Chinese type better, but maybe its personal preference. Curry mutton meat was also tough. Won't be going back."
Excellent food!,Authentic Indian food! Love the food and ambiance! Signature fish head curry is a must try! One of the best curry in Singapore!
Finger licking good,"This place is a cult. Everyone has their preferred phở or burger joint. Samy’s is my fav place fir fish head curry. If you dare, best way to savour your meal here is to eat with your hand. Then you will understand what finger lickin’ good really means!"
"Authentic Indian food,fast service","Went there for a dinner and was blown away by the delicious food.We ordered briyani rice meal(briyani rice with 2 vegetables) black squid,fish cutlet,mysore mutton and fried cauliflower.

I really loved the briyani rice.It was a good quality basmati rice,very fragrant and light.The mutton was good but not the best I have had.The fish cutlet was yummy and loved the crunchy fried cauliflowers.

The food was authentic and not too spicy,which
suited everyone palette.We ended the meal with their aromatic and delicious masala tea.

The food was served very quickly and customer service was very good ⭐"
Popular among locals as well visitors,"Popular among locals as well as visitors there is no air conditioning here. One sits outdoors or indoors. Indoors is an old colonial building with many overhead fans blowing. Served on a banana leaf for your rice and accompaniments. The curry fish head is famous, chicken tikka, braised lamb and cauliflower all taste good. Lassi is also available. Price is mid range."
"Bottled it on the signature fish head curry, but delicious","Confirming previous reviews, service a bit erratic, but if you count that as part of charm and fun its no issue as you eventually get there and the waiters are good natured rather than wilfully indifferent. Atmosphere fine, its not Atlas Bar inside, but it does its prime job, of serving great curry, very well.

Four of us went, all served on big leaves, rice is free flow so you cant order to share, at $3-4 per portion thats no crisis. You can order most dishes in small or big portions, we had a query with our bill as we thought we had been given a small when we had ordered a big. The cashier has obviously had this question before as he brought out a round bowl (small) and an oval bowl (big) and asked us which one we had had (the oval bowl). Most of the dishes we had were dry, which explained the person coming round with the rice offering seperate helpings of curry sauce (fish or chicken) for the rice. Didnt check the 'free-flow' as with the rice and the basket of nan between four plus all the dishes and sides we were full. Somehow there was a little spare room left for some very nice ice-cream to finish things off

All the food was served quickly and as per above, delicious. Recommended. $105 for four including a round of drinks. Would place it on the boundary between cheap eats an mid-range."
Poor service. Excellent food,"If you are looking for a fine dining experience or decent service, give this place a skip. However, if all you care about is delicious Indian food, the masala chicken and cutlets are out if this world. Loved the fact that they let me bring my own whiskey"
Soshal Distan Singh,"Samy’s popularity is proven during circuit breaker. On Mother’s Day, there was a queue for about 1 hour to order lunch. In theory, you could order by phone or online, but unless you contact them the day before, no chance of an answer. The reasonably-priced and decent-quality food (except the fish head which is superb)n make it worth it. Distancing is not fantastic, let’s hope this doesn’t become a new cluster."
You will be more welcome at Uncle Samy’s than at Uncle Sam’s embassy next door,"This family restaurant has been in business since 1950, and at this Dempsey location since the 80’s. To its fans’ delight, it has recently been allowed to stay on, although many tenants in Blocks 15&16 have been invited out for redevelopment of the Tanglin Village area. Samy’s is a bit of a cult, with loyal customers, many of whom first came here as kids. The clientèle is largely Asian, and mainly local at that. The fish head curry is awesome. Other dishes are not the best Indian you can have in Singapore, but you come here mainly for the experience, and the fish head! To really savour the curry, eat with your fingers. Extraordinarily efficient service from friendly roaming wait staff, who can happily refill your needs in rice, pappadum, or vegs. The dishes, including the fish head curry, are served within ONE or TWO minutes after ordering! Prices are very reasonable. Don’t overindulge though - one look at the well-fed managers would tell you why you shouldn’t!"
"Off the Beaten Path, but Worth Finding","My friend is a local, and he loves this place. So, it's a regular stop on my visits to S'pore. Authentic Indian food - inexpensive and healthy portions."
Value for money,"Their masala chicken is a must, the masala is very rich & aromatic. If can try their fish roe, claypot fish head curry & fish cutlets. It's very tasty, yuymmy!!"
"Very, very traditional curry house","This place seems to do a few things right as it is here for 50y or so

Food is served on a banana leaf. Big portion rice, plus curries. Gets a bit messy,
And maybe less clean looking.

Curties are hot, too, so go for k6ng prawns, very munchy"
great fish head curry,cheap and good... surprisingly! for the location. food arrived very quickly even when we ordered at 9pm.
Excellent Indian food,"If you love indian food, this is a place to go. Very good seafood, calm setup in a much nicer place than going to Little India."
Great food,"We went with a family of 8 for dinner. Great food, especially masala chicken and fish head curry. Great and friendly staff"
OCC review of Samy’s Curry Nov 18,"On Friday 30th November 2018 – The OCC visited Samy’s Curry, Dempsey Road
Before we get to the review, a brief introduction to Samy’s which was prepared by our Chairman prior to the meet.
A very inconspicuous place, this restaurant hides behind La Fondue like hidden treasure. Sammy’s Curry is a family owned business and have been situated in this exact location for 50
years, way before Dempsey road was even developed into the classy restaurant district it is today, being the very first restaurant in Dempsey road. Sammy’s Curry gives a totally different vibe from the rest of the restaurants in Dempsey. Whereas other Dempsey restaurants exude a classy, fine-dining atmosphere, Sammy’s Curry is more like a canteen with a 80s colonial setting. Stepping in here is like stepping back in time.
For full transparency, see below scores (out of 10). Restaurants must score an average of 7/10 or above to receive the OCC sticker of recommendation.
Quality: 7.2
Customer care: 6.02
Value: 6.3
Service: 6.66
Atmosphere: 8.12

Overall: 6.86
Samy’s Curry IS NOT awarded the much-coveted OCC sticker of recommendation, narrowly missing the required 7/10 average

In terms of quality of the food, Samy’s scores well. We ordered a masala chicken, mysore mutton, Aloo gobi, fish head curry, tandoori prawn, curried squid, biriyani rice and naan. Most noteworthy for me was the masala chicken and the very crispy poppadoms and delicious gravy and mint sauce we were given when we sat down. Sadly, there were not many poppadoms to serve 6 people and we were not offered any more. We were told by friends that we had to try the fish head curry. regrettably this was a bit of a disappointment as the flavours of the dish just didn’t stand up to the hype, and at S$28 was the most expensive dish we ordered by some margin. One member commented that it was ‘a bit of a let down given this was supposed to be the signature dish’. Something I haven’t seen elsewhere in Singapore, which was a positive was how all food is served on banana leaves rather than plates and a waiter comes around to individually serve the biryani rice. This was a nice touch and cut down on any rice hogging.

Customer care was the lowest score of the evening. Some confusion around our booking when we arrived was followed up with what felt like an indifference towards seating us. As a group of 6 entering what was at the time a fairly quiet restaurant we would have liked a slightly more personal touch than just having a waiter point at a table. Given that we made it clear we were there to review the restaurant we were surprised that no one checked up on us for the remainder of the meal.

As well as the disappointing customer care, service also wasn’t great unfortunately. The restaurant was starting to fill up and staff did appear to be genuinely busy, but throughout the evening we found ourselves struggling to get the attention of staff and / or waiting on sauces, beers, etc despite asking multiple times. Waiting for food is one thing, beer, slightly more irritating, but a 10 minute wait for a mango lassi after your 3rd raw chili fine of the evening is OCC rating suicide and ultimately, the poor service cost Samy’s their OCC recommendation.

Value scored quite low with mains averaging around S$15 each but then the disappointment of the S$28 fish head curry which punched up the bill significantly. I suspect that if we had enjoyed this more we may have scored better for value. One member exclaimed that S$90 a head was ‘a bit bl**dy steep!’ but for full transparency, the OCC are a thirsty bunch and we did consume 23 pints of lager between the 6 of us. This made up almost half the bill.

In terms of atmosphere and location, this was a highlight and all members seemed to enjoy the location and ambience. The outside tables are surrounded by trees and plants and it feels like you are eating your dinner in the jungle. Whilst the large open windows allow the noise and din of the restaurant (largely coming from our table) to carry throughout making for a really fun and energetic Friday night atmosphere.

Personally I am a little disappointed that Samy’s didn’t quite pass muster as it has the potential to be a really great curry house. Unfortunately, the service and customer care negatively impacted the experience more than the locale and food enhanced it.

Visiting an old friend,Samy’s is an institution and we pay homage to it when we crave for a bout of good ‘ol fish head curry. And what’s not to love when you eat it off a banana leaf surrounded by thick forestry in Dempsey. This is truly a unique Singapore experience.... must try.
Authentic Curry House at Dempsey Hill,"Went here with local colleagues for lunch. Food is served on a large banana leaf and excellent choice of different dishes. It was pretty busy, as it was a public holiday, but service was quick and friendly."
Fish head curry,We came looking for fish head curry and were not disappointed. It's a bit spicy but the beer is cold and the naan is fresh and hot.
Delicious,Sat outside with fans and had a delicious meal with friends. Choose your dishes and they are then served quickly directly onto a banana leaf! R
Good food,"I came here many years ago and found the food to be average.

However, I had a better experience this time. The good was served on a banana leaf. We had Chicken masala, dhal, chicken gravy with basmati rice. Nahn bread was good. Everything was very delicious.

The service was not responsive as we had to wait for our food to be replenished."
Good Indian Cuisine Option in Dempsey,"Went to Samy’s with APAC colleagues who are in Singapore for a summit. Food were good, ambiance is OK. No AC, just ceiling fans. Though it seems like it is intentional to keep a local vibe. best time to go during dinner. It might be a challenge during lunchtime where the temperature is warm and humid. Dahl and Mango Lazi is my favorite."
Lovely Evening,"We experienced a very pleasant evening with friends at Samy's. We were seated outside for dinner on a Friday and attended to by several staff. Each one knew the menu very well and had thoughtful suggestions. We had the fish head curry (tender flavourful fish), curry mutton, masala chicken (nicely spiced), sambal prawn (large and tasty) and the usual pappadam, nan, and beer. We were allowed to bring a bottle of wine at a nominal charge. We ate everything they brought - it was all nicely spiced and delicious. The service was attentive and fast. Samy's is family owned and operating for over 50 years. Samy's offers a great experience and a flavour of old Singapore (and India!)."
Sammy’s Curry,"One of my favorite curry restaurants in Singapore. The food is served on banana leaf and is always fresh and delicious. Have never eaten anything that wasn’t delicious. Located of Dempsey road in a complex that has revitalized the old barracks from years past. Lots of Shoppe, restaurants and antiques there now. If you love curry...a must."
55 years of fantastic curry... and going strong.,"I've was a regular at Samy's when I lived in Singapore in the 90's. But I still go there whenever I get an excuse to fly to Sin.
The quality of the food has always been excellent, the mutton curry melts in your mouth, the Mysore mutton is incredibly flavorful and the chicken Tikka just as good.
Even the rice topped with the chicken curry gravy is fantastic. You top this with a super cooling Jumbo glass of lemonade and your set for one of the best curry meals you can have on this planet. If you came to Singapore and fancy a curry this is a must try!"
Hit and miss,"What I loved was friendly service, good choice of well-cooled beers and being able to sit outside. The quintessential banana leaf option gives you unlimited plain or basmati/pilau rice plus soupy curry toppings any time you want. Add to that the star dish of fish head curry, spicy and meaty and we would have been happy if we’d stopped there.
The downer was not just that we over-ordered but that all the other dishes were dry, poorly warmed and not so tasty. The fried spicy chicken was like eating cardboard.

Special mention though for the nan breads. Fabulous . I’d go again any time but be more careful about what not to order"
Authentic South India cuisine,Fish head curry is a must. Everything we ordered without exception was simply delicious. Perfect balance and use of spice. Air-conditioned.
Excellent variety of dishes and very authentic South Indian,"I have visited Samy’s on family birthdays and anniversaries, the taste and food has never changed a bit since the father who started Samy’s years back. It’s now run by his family and the staff are very polite, knowledgeable in recommending dishes. Diners are of a cosmopolitan group. I have tasted most of the dishes and they maintain the same standards over the years."
Food worth the travel,"When in Singapore we loved the food and atmosphere from Samy's. Note to try and sit outside, you feel like you are at 2 different places so outside is much better"
Authentic Indian restaurant,Authentic banana leaf Indian restaurant. Nice curry fish head. Quite and nice location. Amber parking space.
Simple and Good,"Samy's serves very good curries in the traditional manner, right from the bucket onto the banana leaf. The fishhead curry is excellent and their most famous dish. The place is relaxed, mostly open air although there is an air conditioned room in the back. Get one of the tables on the front porch overlooking gardens."
"Casual South Indian (Tamil) Cuisine, pretty decent but nothing exotic","Large set-up, both indoor and outdoor seating, a air conditioned section too. Very casual for friends and families to grab a decent tamil style south indian food.

I wasn't particularly happy with how they serve starters. It is all precooked and just served in small portions (cold and sure doesn't taste like it should). The Veg Cauliflower (Gobhi 65) was absolutely soggy and tasteless. They sure can raise the standards up here and be a little more proactive in management.

Other main course dishes were all pretty decent."
Casual fun Indian food,"There's no aircon, but feels like the old days in Singapore. Indian food on a banana leaf and they have cutlery if u prefer. Favorite masala chicken n cauliflower."
Best Fish Head Curry in Singapore,"Samy's Curry curry has the Best Fish Head Curry in Singapore no denying about that.

Samy's has maintained the standard and taste in their food for many years.

For those visiting for the first time, you may opt for the Chicken Masala, Mysore Mutton, Gobi 65(trust me you will end up ordering more) and their Fish Head curry.

This is the only restaurant where its open air with fans, and partially air-conditioned. You will have the nostalgic experience that you're in the 70s restaurant.

Do note that their Briyani White/Rice with vege is free flow when ordered as a set and you may refill as many times you want to. Papadam is complimentary and can be refilled as many times as you want at no additional cost. (This is something thats lacking with many other indian restaurants)

Briyani rice is best paired with Masala Chicken, Mysore Mutton etc.
White rice is best paired with the Fish Head Curry, you will taste the unique difference when eating with white rice.

Food price are reasonable and affordable, and you will definitely be back again."
Authentic & good,We were taken here by friends who live in Singapore & love Indian food. Samys was great & our food was served on a giant banana leaf (no plates!). The food was great & plentiful and good service too.
Taste of South India,"Delicious fish head curry, chicken tikka, briyani, naan of various flavours, vegetable accompaniments , just to name a few. Served on banana leaves. Large selection from drink menu. Service is good ."
Always a pleasure,A trip to Singapore is not complete without a meal at Samy's. Authentic and delicious as always. Everything is worth ordering and the lime juice helps cool things down.
Re-Test,"Fish curry has always be a perennial favourite with my friends and I
And Samy is one of our joints, though it’s been some time, given the choices available.
This visit whilst not a total disaster, it was a letdown. Could it be because of the attention to the “corporate” type customers that the preparation is somewhat fusion and thus “dlluted”. The flavours we sought were somehow no longer there
Tsk tsk"
Super Duper Good Banana Leaf Rice,Friend recommended this super duper good restaurant served great foods. You must try it out when you in Singapore
Good Curry Experience,"My first lunch in Singapore after a hefty Chilli Crabs the night before. I love the way of eating in this restaurant. Instead of a plate, we use a piece of banana leaf. Spoon and fork are provided. We ordered Fish Head Curry, Dark Squid Dish, Dry Lamb Curry (like Indonesian Rendang), Potato and Lentil curry, and plenty of Pappadums. They are all eaten with Biryani rice. Their Biryani is dry and not oily, almost like saffron rice. For the drinks we ordered Kalamansi juice.
It is located in the old British Army Barrack, which makes it interesting to go to. There are many restaurants in this complex, I recommend travellers to explore the whole complex if times permit."
Best fish head curry in Singapore!,5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Just simply amazing food and the warmest hospitality - worth flying from Dubai to Singapore for this alone!!! Will be back again soon!
Still Good and Authentic,"Brought 2 friends there for a late lunch a couple of months ago. The food was still good and authentic - the kind of indian food that I like.

I am most impressed still with the mutton tikka - which does not have any hint of the mutton taste and this is one of the only few places that I dont mind taking mutton.

We arrived after 1:30pm and hence, the restaurant was not crowded at all - hence, we had attentive and efficient service level. Dishes were served almost instantly after we placed our orders, together with the usual banana leaf, rice and condiments.

I will still recommend this place to anyone who are around the area and is craving for good indian food."
Bad first expression,Rice served was cold.Banana leaf is old and dirty.Fried chicken was $5 per pc and was the size of my finger.Drinks was not served after serving food.Had to call waiter couple of times until we choke.Unprompt snd un professional behaviour approached by the restraurant staffs.
This is where you want to eat Indian food,"Located off the beaten path, you may need a local to help you find it, but once there, Samy's doesn't not disappoint. Nothing fancy, eating off of green place mats and most customers are using their fingers to put food in their mouths. The variety of food is amazing as are the aromas. Priced reasonably. Don't miss it."
Great location but average food and service.,"Not far from Orchard Road in the ever improving Dempsey area is a great location. Sit on the balcony and by only seeing greenery you can believe you are in the countryside on the edge of a tropical jungle.
After this things go downhill a bit with very average Indian food and service. Thick sticky sauces with modest flavour on overcooked rice. Good that it is served on a banana leaf which is great.
Obviously an institution but there is much, much better Indian food in Singapore albeit maybe in not such a special location. Guess it depends what you want.? I prefer great food."
Disappointed,"After reading the positive reviews we decided to give the place a try. First impression wasn’t good as there was strong from the toilet nx door. Other than the masala chicken the other dishes were rather average. Having eaten good Indian food here and all over the world, this place is just ok at best."
Excellent Chicken Masala,"2nd visit to Samy's. Our favourite is the chicken masala (1 order = 1 chicken leg). This served on a banana leaf and with rice and 1 vege and any curry gravy of your choice. If you like full flavoured and really thick gravy, ask them for the masala gravy. If not then they have the regular gravies - chicken & fish curry, sambar (dhal), etc. Only quip is that you get only 1 vege with the rice set (I'm used to 3 vege) - so you'll have to order more on the side if you want more variety.

Will definitely drop by on my next visit to Singapore."
One of a kind!,"Food is good, price is low, eat all you want, service is good on most days. Nothing fancy. Just old fashioned comfort food."
Ok not great,There was a group of us and we went here as a friend said it was her favourite Indian restaurant. It was a bit frantic if you are not sure what you are doing . The food was OK but not great. I would stick to Little India area next time.
Samy’s Mammy’s cooking is so shammy...!,"This family restaurant has been in business since 1950, and at this Dempsey location since the 80’s. It is a bit of a cult, with loyal customers, many of whom first came here as kids. The clientèle is largely Asian, and mainly local at that. The fish head curry is awesome, although at the last visit, I found it a bit too salty. Other dishes are not the best Indian you can get in Singapore, but you come here mainly for the experience, and the fish head! Efficient service from roaming wait staff, who can happily refill your needs in rice, pappadum, or vegs. Prices are very reasonable."
Great Indian food,"My wife and I had dinner at Samy's in early March 2019. What a great place! You are not far from downtown Singapore but it feels like being in the countryside.

The food is served on a large banana leaf. We had chicken and fish tikka - smoky and delicious!

The service was friendly and fast. I would eat at Samy's again in a heartbeat!"
Wonderful meal,We had dinner at Samy’s and were delighted with everything. From the casual ambience to the friendly service to the astonishing food - it was a memorable dining exp3ience.
Samy's Curry - Dempsey,"Samy's Curry - Dempsey. Had the fish head curry (Indian style) and was favourful and spicy. The service, however, needs improvement as they seem to be short-handed and were very slow to provide service."
Excellent,"Our first visit to this delight Indian restaurant. Very basic, no frills, out of place in Dempsey really, but a treat! Good food and service. Will return."
Yummy Food,"Food is so yummy and affordable too.... but in term of services, they need to improve.Overall we got a good food on CNY PH@SG 💐. Everyone should try."
Most Affordable in Dempsey Area,"I have been here several times. In the expensive Dempsey area, this is best value for money. The foods are authentic, and the service is... em... not very consistent, but ok."
A must-visit place,"This South Indian restaurant isn't fancy, but the food is delicious. Many places slip when they become popular, but not Samy's. You should come several times to try everything"
Spice to hit the spot.,The place has an old world vibe of the days gone by. A colonial building with tiled roof and ceiling fans. The flavours are uniquely Singaporean Indian with strong influence from Southern India. Another name for Samys could easily be Dakshin.
Food great but service needs to improve,"It seems like every time you ask them something, it takes three times before they get it right. Not sure if it is a language issue with understanding English. I think it’s an issue of passing the buck.

But food is still good although they need to pay attention to cleanliness. I have begun to notice that they are lapsing in hygiene of late."
Best curry I have tasted,"What an amazing Indian food experience. Samy’s is an authentic Indian restaurant where you can really taste the flavours of India.
We had the lamb curry, lady fingers curry and tika chicken.
You sit down and get a banana leave to use as a plate, you are then served all the essentials to go with your curries.
A kingfisher beer was a great top to the meal."
Samy's Restaurant,"This is the second visit to Samy's in Singapore and it was worth the trip. Great Indian style cuisine that offers local food in an informal cafe/restaurant setting with good old fashioned service, reminescent of bygone Singapore. Recommend biryani with mutton curry and side orders such as chilli prawns or black pepper squid.
Although a Holland Rd bus is available, suggest a short taxi ride to Dempsey Hill from Orchard Road for convenience."
Authentic,"Took the family for lunch here on Tuesday
Loved the more down market presentation of Formica tables and eating off a banana leaf
Samy’s was packed and noisy , service was efficient and fast , food was great
Couldn’t quite get the rest of our group to go for the fish head curry which the waiter recommended - but the fish curry was a good compromise - tasty and spicy with soft white fish . The vegetable curry was made with ladies fingers and delicious . Loved the fried cauliflower and delicious naan bread .
Followed it up with some gorgeous ice cream fro their little ice cream freezer- perfect end to any Indian meal
Samy’s was terrific value - our cheapest meal in our visit -$100 for 3 of us with 1beer and ice cream
Will be back next visit"
My first call for a good South Indian curry..,"My first call for my South Indian curry fix is always Samy's Curry in Dempsey. I have been patronising them for over 20 years and the one thing that truly stands out for me is the quality of food and it's consistency. My 'go for' dishes include masala chicken, fish cutlet, fish head curry and mutton mysore with either briyani or white rice. I know,, it sounds like a pig out but then... Go try. No disappointments here."
Great Food and Especially the Fish Head Curry,"A group of us went there for a business dinner and sat inside. Service was prompt and efficient and we ordered a selection of dishes including paneer, chicken masala, biryani, cauliflower, garlic na’an and fish head curry. All of food was very good and especially the fish head curry. Lots of meat and a very spicy sauce that was great with the rice. We finished up with some very rich and creamy ice cream. It is noisy and busy inside so enjoy the food and leave business discussions for later."
Yummy as always 👌🏾,"Never disappointed with this restaurant each time I pay a visit here! Solid food friendly and fast service! Their briyani rice, chicken marsala, fish Cutlet, and Mysore mutton a just try! You will never be disappointed! Go for it 👌🏾!"
Fabulous Curry,"My wife and I visited here whilst on holiday in Sing. I had been once before and wanted her to experience the food. All served on a pandan leaf. The curries are very fragrant and fresh spices are everywhere ! The price is very reasonable and the flavours great. If you like curries, this is the place !"
deliciousness on a leaf,"Oooohhh, this is tasty. Super tasty in fact. Every time i am back in Singapore, I make it a point to dine here with friends. That masala chicken is to die for. Then there is the mega king size prawns... no one does it as tasty as Samy does! make sure you order the lime juice to wash down that curry gloriousness"
First time for indian food.,"Actually first time to eat traditional indian food with banana leaf. Brought by two group of friends in two weeks. Good for curry fish head, but better for the rice and nan, beef and mutton, etc"
Best fish head curry in southeast asia,"Four of us had lunch at samys. It was a hot afternoon and we managed to get into the aircon room. It was very comfortable, service was fast. They serve chilled beer and it was nice to start your lunch with a chilled tiger beer. Their fish head curry was terrific. It was not very spicy but with enough masala. We ordered pomphret fry which was delicious. They had awsome mutton varumal. We washed down spices with ais moru/butter milk. We had gulab jamun for dessert which was very soft. Gulab jamun just melts in your mouth. I recommend this place for fish head curry and think that this is the best fish head curry in south east asia."
Great food - Excellent surroundings,"A return visitor to Samy's. Even better the second time around. Samy's serve excellent curries on a banana leaf. Its an authentic experience with food that is also authentic. We couldn't complain about the food at all. Everything was nice and the great aromas from the all the spices were present.

Try getting a table out on the veranda. It makes for a very pleasant dining experience where one is not rushed and more private, the surrounding gardens just add to the experience and take you back to what it must have been like in the colonial days.

A great place to spend an afternoon feasting on some of the best curries in Singapore and perhaps stay for dinner as well.

It's on the agenda for our next visit to this magnificent Island."
Authentic Tamillian Cuisine,I have visited this restaurant several times. Every time I visit Singapore I make it a point to have at least one meal in Samy's Curry. I have never been disappointed .It is a meal served on a banana leaf. This time ate fried fish and mutton. Chicken and Prawn are also on the menu.
Authentic food,"Will come here when craving for mysore mutton.. It's so tasty! Other dishes also nice like fish cutlet, chicken masala, veggies, curry chicken. Food served in a banana leaf. Authentic indian cuisine. The service of the staff was good, they are fast and also attentive."
The best!,"Came to Samy’s in Dempsey Hill with a friend for dinner and we ordered far too much but it was all delish! My personal favs were the mysore mutton, masala chicken and the squid. It’s a bit pricier than average but totally worth it!!"
Average,"After reading all the great reviews I have to say I was underwhelmed by the food at Samy’s. Dry chicken, tiny portions and expensive. Don’t believe the hype - there are many far superior Indian restaurants in Singapore."
"To be honest, very average","We went here on the recommendation of some local Singaporean friends but it was disappointing. Much of the food was deep fried, banana leaf presentation. Service was quick and prices low but not a dinner to remember."
Fish head curry restaurant,"Quaint indian restaurant that seems to be of antiquity in terms of design. Not airconditioned though. They serve ready to eat food as well as ala carte dishes. We savored the fish head curry that was good to the last morsel of curried meat. Banana leaves as plates make the experience very countryside , so expect to use your hands. Beer a bit pricey. So full tank we had no more space for desert to finish off ."
Unbelievably Good,Great. Authentic. Great lunch here! Maybe become a bit more expensive over the years but aside from that is the real deal.
Delicious food,"Saw this place on many blog sites and had to try it. Ordered biryani, chicken, fish and mutton which were accompanied by papads and 2 veggie sides. All delicious and washed down with amazing lime juice."
Finger licking Good,"Eating at Samy's Curry is always memorable, especially if you have foreign guests visiting who have never experienced eating with their hands. We enjoy the food and the atmosphere."
Good food but so so service,"We had the bryani rice, with a plate of tandoori chicken, mutton mysore and butter chicken, with a garlic naan. The rice was full of flavour, and came with sides of potatoes and cabbage.

The mutton was lovely and tender, but we found the butter chicken to be too sweet.

It would have been five stars but we had difficulty getting a waiter, and when we asked for some extra papadums, he nodded in a surly way but never turned up with the papadums, studiously avoiding our table while he served some papadums to the back room. The lady servers were friendlier.

A meal for two, including tea and lime juice, was @$45. Do note they are closed from 3-530 pm."
Curry and rice served on a banana leaf,Typical south Indian curries. The opposite of fine dining. Curries are so hot as to be inedible. Not for the faint hearted!
Delicious and spicy!,We always try to eat at this wonderful Indian restaurant every time that we are in Singapore. It’s a busy place offering a variety of deliciously spicy Indian food in a great location. Serving the food on banana leaves adds to the fun. Samy’s is highly recommended!
Fresh Fish Head,Southern Indian food but with some selection of north idian food. Fresh fish head. Generous in its giving.
Curry at its best,Has to be one of Singapore’s best South Indian restaurants. To the uninitiated South Indian cuisine tends to be richly spicy without the balance of the Mughal influence of the Northern Indian recipes. So be prepared for a blast to the mouth all the way to the jaws. It will be hot! The place is nothing more than cafeteria like. But experience eating on banana leaves—a long Indian tradition.
Get together,Had our rare gathering at Sam's Curry. Fish head curry and fried cauliflower is a must. We made booking and requested for the air-con room. Service as per norm was good. Thank you.
Yummy Indian Feast!,"It was gd to be back to Samy’s Curry after many years! Surprisingly their standard never drop in fact their food tasted even better now in my view! Service can be improved! We had to wait quite a bit for refilling! You can see the owners in action too! The place is always very crowded esp during lunch time! They even have a air condition room too! Go for it, you won’t regret!"
"Nice location, good food, gets super busy at dinner","Dempsey Hill has evolved over the years. This used to be a Super relaxed place, but now, is buzzing with activity. Many new restaurants have opened up and car density is up manifold.

One restaurant that has witnessed all of this is Samys curry. It’s a landmark in itself and most taxi drivers can take you here at the mere mention of the restaurant name.

The food is good as ever. Try the chicken 65 and Mysore mutton with rice or Indian breads. Washed down by a simple lime juice, the food does bring a smile to my face.

The seating, ambience, waiters, etc. Feels like a grade just above that of a food court. But don’t be fooled, the restaurant and the patrons know the legacy of the place and respect it. Don’t be surprised to find the who’s who of Singapore here."
Good spice goos taste,I have visited almost tens of indians restaurants but i muat say Samy's is un my top 3. With a good choice of indian food the banana leaf reasturants boasts in both consistency and taste. I would recommend this restaurent to any south indian spice cravers
Night out with colleagues,We took our colleagues for a unique dinner and they enjoyed the experience. The mutton is to die for and we ordered several dishes to complement the tasty biryani. All in all great value and taste.
Wonderful food off the beaten track,"Samy's Curry is a venerable Singaporean institution, so you must try it. The food is good (not the best Indian restaurant I've ever been to, though, but among the best). It's a little off touristic limits, but Singapore is tiny, taxis are not expensive and everybody knows where Samy's is. The bill was adequate to the quality of the food and I loved the informal, traditional atmosphere. I would return the next time I visit Singapore."
