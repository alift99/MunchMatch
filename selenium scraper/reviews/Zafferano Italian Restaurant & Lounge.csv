New Year Dinner,"We had a really enjoyable family dinner at Zafferano last week. The service led by both Ian Sithan and Shah Supoano was immaculate. Even though our son is 8 years old, he was treated with equal finesse
The food was delicious and very well presented. It was my second time there and I would return again. Well done"
Impeccable Service with Great View,"Excellent service, food and view. We had team Lunch and we were well taken care and ambience just excellent."
Our Anniversary Place in the Sky,ALTRO ZAFFERANO was the perfect place for our 30th Wedding Anniversary! The ambiance of a cool evening gazing at the breathtaking skyline was matched by impeccable southern Italian cuisine as well as extremely attentive and warm service by CHONA and KUMAR. We are eager to return as well as enthused to recommend our friends to dine here. THANK YOU SO MUCH for an unforgettable experience!
Paying for the view.....,"A stunning view with impeccable service. However, you can get much more interesting, better wine selection and food in many other Italian restaurants in Singapore."
Excellent anniversary celebration,Celebrated my wedding anniversary at this wonderful restaurant. The staff were courteous and very accommodating to all our needs. Excellent food and drink choices as well.
Birthday dinner at Zafferano,"My wife and I had a wonderful evening, friendly staff who were willing to check every detail for us, very patient and attentive. Our reservation request and expectations were exceeded. We had requested for a secluded table with a view for my wife's birthday. Food was cooked to perfection, and portions were just right. And the champagne recommendation was just right, definitely one of the better ones we have tried. The dinner ended with a surprise birthday chocolates for her, which really made her day. The after dinner tour of the garden terrace offered a magnificent view of the city skyline and dazzling lights. We are definitely returning again soon!"
Great views,"Great: friendly staff, gave us a great table with a view, food came promptly and was beautifully plated, bread was warm and tasty.
Only minor complains were they forgot to give us cutlery both when the starters and main courses were filled and we had to ask for a second water refill. Maybe there weren’t enough staff around during busy lunch times? Felt a bit ripped off that 36$ Order of scallops was one or two scallops sliced 4 ways."
Great option for Lunch,"High quality food, super attentive service, and magnificent views made for a great lunch. Lunch set menu is good value for the quality and service provided. Highly recommended."
So glad to be back for lunch!,"Haven’t been here for a while but so glad I picked this place for lunch after returning to the office. The food, ambience, service was all great. The tummies left feeling happy and I’ll be sure to return again!"
Quality food and service,"The quality of food was good, with generous serving as well. The service from staff was excellent as they were very attentive and accommodating."
Great view.. food not so much,"The view is amazing and the place itself looks great
Sadly was a bit of a Valentines day rip off
Exorbitantly expensive
Food was decidedly so so
A lot of the food had been frozen and was somewhat tasteless
The starters and the scallop in particular
The wine list was extensive and they had a sommelier but overall the place wasn't good
I doubt I would return"
Delicious Italian food with a excellent service,A friend recommended the restaurant and I was not disappointed. We created our own 4 course menu from the menu. The tartare was excellent and the lobster spaghetti incredibly tasty. I loved the chocolate cake for dessert. The center was still liquid- together with the ice cream- heavenly!
Wonderful Italian food with spectacular views,"This was our second visit to Zefferano and it did not disappoint. This visit was a Valentine's Day special menu and it was wonderful. The menu was thoughtfully put together to include an amuse bouche, fish, steak (the highlight), pasta, dessert and petit fours. Each dish was perfectly prepared and beautiful to look at with a lovely combination of flavours and colours. The service was exceptional and friendly and we were made to feel welcomed and valued.
Overall, a very special night."
"Food with layers of flavour, attentive service and great view","I loved the appetiser as biting in the flavours oozed out. The lobster pasta tasted marvellous, not too oily yet with rich flavours. My friend loved the truffle mashed potato which was perfect for her taste bud. Celebrated my friend's birthday and the complimentary tiramisu was nicely made! And add in the view from the high floor makes the whole experience wonderful."
Wedding Reception,"Had my wedding reception on the 18th Dec 2021 at Zafferano and I only have great things to say about this venue.

Jennifer was extremely helpful with the pre-event planning (replying to my constant queries regarding food, AV, COVID rules and etc). She assisted with all the necessary arrangements (liaising with all the third-party vendors) such that I did not have to worry about anything during the evening.

Post-event, she even texted us to congratulate us and her service remains professional and helpful. Also, I would like to commend Jennifer's honesty and kindness, i didn't realise I have dropped my ring in the restaurant - she texted me to inform me and even kept it for me for safekeeping purposes.

All in all, my guests were extremely happy and with the quality of the food. I've received praises from everyone that the service from the team was impeccable, the staff was extremely friendly and could anticipate their needs. They went out of their way to ensure that everyone had a pleasant evening.

100% would recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a venue for a wedding reception, events, or a date night. A big thank you to the Zafferano Team!"
"Good food, stellar service","We had a lovely dinner experience at Zafferano. The food was very good, but what really stands out is the warm and thoughtful service."
Tiny food portions,"Came to this restaurant for dinner with family to celebrate a special occasion. Overall, the experience was uninspiring and really the main going for this restaurant is the spectacular skyline view. The food is decent in taste, not special by any means that is above that of a regular good mall restaurant, however the food portions are absolutely tiny. The main courses are like appetizers. And the appetizers are like tiny morsels. My spouse joked that we need to order 3 portions of entrees per person to actually not end up hungry. The wagyu beef is not tender enough and tasted just like regular steak one can grill at home. The fish and lobster combo had only a small piece of lobster. The service was decent but at the end of the day, the great view alone cannot justify the fancy price given the rest of the mundane experience."
Disappointing,"I went here for a business lunch and while the view and ambience is great, the service and food options are not. As a vegetarian, there were very few options and almost no option to customize/change something to make it vegetarian. Also, the service was disappointing -- slow, and serving the wrong items to the wrong people."
Great Dining Experience,"Overall service is great, wonderful ambience and most importantly - quality cuisines ! I shall visit more often to this beautiful restaurant."
Great choice for both dates and friends catch-up!,This restaurant never fails to impress with both their food and drink options as well as their excellent service.
Staffs well done,The main course served to our table was late almost 30 -40 min due to restaurant shortage of manpower. However server who responsible for our table have been attentive and continue checking with their kitchen regularly. He had replenish us some nice complimentary nice wine to keep us occupied. Highly recommend
Impeccable service,Celebrating wedding anniversary. Thank you Martin and his team for their stellar service. Food and wine was excellent.
Pleasant Birthday Dinner,"Girlfriend brought me here to celebrate my birthday. Honestly, I did not expect much from this place but it surpassed my expectations. Would definitely return in the future.

The staff were attentive and friendly and the food was excellent. However there are two points which can be improved on, firstly, the speed at which food is served was a little too quick, we were barely done with the bread when the appetizers came and the bread was taken away. Secondly, the window seating doesn’t provide much of a view.

Overall it was a pretty great experience."
Eccellente!,"The food was consistently good (on both my visits). The set lunch was reasonably priced too.

The service staff were friendly and attentive. Though we didn't get the table with a nice view that I requested, it was the overall experience that made the occasion special.

I will definitely go back and try their other dishes."
"An Excellent Brunch, With Service and View!","The brunch menu is really excellent and i'd say great value too at SGD88 for free flow soft drinks and only a little more for free flow bubbles and alcohol, all in the superb (if a little cold) surroundings and service levels of a 5 Star top notch eatery. My second time at Zafferano after i experienced an excellent dinner with my colleagues, my Wife and I were keen to try the brunch. See the menu attached and a couple of food and view photos. Every course was not only a festival for the taste buds, there was plenty of it too, so full marks for not scrimping on portion sizes. Everything is served at your table, so its a brunch but with a full table service. The staff are great too, attentive and friendly but without being overbearing. 100% would recommend it and we will be back. Many thanks."
Celebration of friends birthday,"Is was indeed sad that because of the rules of 2 pax dining we can't eat together in pax of 4. We won't blame the restaurant as is not the restaurant fault, they are just following the government rule. However the service they provide is excellent. The food is fantastic as well. Keep up the good job."
Love the place and service,"Love the place as it has lots of space and good ambience. Service from various manager and crew is very good. They did a service recovery on 2 side dishes although I did not make any complaints. Excellent!

Food quality is fantastic especially the wagyu beef..

We did a quick tour on the alfresco area and the view of Marina Bay is marvelous."
Wedding dinner,"We booked the private room for our wedding dinner - great organization, very flexible and attentive staff, and everyone loved it!"
"Fantastic wine dinner, the best views and ambiance in Singapore","We went back again (and again) to Zafferano.
Before dinner we had a drink at their fabulous terrace, that you can see almost the whole Singapore as well as the neighbouring countries. Basically the best view you can get in Singapore, and with drinks and some starters its simply the best.

We moved inside for our main courses. Food is fab overall. Really loved the way their chef did the foie gras. Not the usual sweetish, that most restaurants do.
Their Neapolitan chef knows his spices.

Then back to the terrace for another drink, watching the night sky and the myriads of lights on the sea and around. Magic.

Such a great and refreshing evening, especially during this tough Covid period.
Great food in fantastic setting."
Not a wedding venue for sure,Was there for a wedding and the service staff there has made it one to remember with the worse attitudes and obnoxious behaviours. I felt sorry for the newly weds having to deal with all the complaints then and after.
Great food and impeccable service,"Was able to get a last minute booking to celebrate some good news with my husband and couldn't have asked for a better evening. From the moment you enter, you are made to feel welcome and all the staff were extremely friendly and attentive (without being over-bearing). The food was delicious, and I think was actually well priced for the quality. We did the degustation menu where we got to select 4 courses from the menu to create our own little tasting menu, I really liked this and reminded me of some of the meals I've had in Italy (got to love having pasta as a distinct and separate course!!). Good selection of wine and drinks also (the espresso martini was especially delicious and a good way to end the evening!).

As for the setting, the restaurant itself is beautiful and the view is stunning. So often with these rooftop restaurants you are paying a premium for the view and end up being a little disappointed with the food/service. This is not the case here. It's clear they have invested in their staff training, the food quality and the overall customer experience, without resting on the ""we have an amazing view"" that so many other places do.

Would definitely recommend and hope to come back again soon! Can only imagine the ambience will be even better once we can have larger groups and music again!"
Uninspiring. Over-priced. Over-rated,"""Over priced. Alaskan King Crab Tagliolini at $68 is a rip-off as there was hardly any crab to speak of!! Porterhouse was tasty but over-cooked. Medium means medium. If unable to achieve, must say upfront. Not make excuses"""
Great Evening,Our 39th Anniversary What a view of the bay area from the terrace lounge... Food was fabulous Friendly service Nice ambience
Wife's birthday,"We came for brunch which was great value. We had 5 people at the table and we all loved it. The food was amazing, the variety, presentation and the flavours all perfect. Our waitress was helpful, polite, friendly and attentive. The restaurant has stunning views from the 40th floor which just adds to the exceptional experience. It rates easily as one of our best dining experiences in Singapore."
Great service from GURU and all staff,"Went for dinner , all staff were professional and service was excellent, would like to highlight Guru for his fantastic attitude and top notch service."
Great food and experience,The ambience of the restaurant is already given but the food is always what takes me to Zafferano. Highly recommended! Plus they have very nice staff. :)
Fabulous!,"Always enjoyable to be here. Its my third visit and they have kept up to their high standards in terms of service & food. Very nice of them to prepare a birthday cake for my sister. Was a happy surprise. Thank you, Zafferano!"
Second to none,"An experience like no other, my husband and I treated ourselves to lunch recently on a Public holiday. The setting is sublime, the service exquisite and the food utterly superb. We had attentive service that was neither intrusive nor left wanting, perfect timing, they watch and take care not to interrupt or ignore. The food was utterly sublime, cooked to perfection and little chef treats in between to excite and educate our palates. We left feeling like royalty and will be making this a regular venue as well as drinks in the evening at the bar with a stunning view."
Fine dining at its best!,"The first time we went to Zafferano was during a lunch event earlier this year. We had the Burratina and Ravioli with burratina filling and we were blown away.

Since then, we have been there 3 more times where had the testing and chef's menu. We were never disappointed and we walked away wanting to come back for more.

The food is excellent, intense and flavourful yet delicately presented. Service is wonderful and very friendly. Some service staff were able to recognise us even with our mask on. There recommendations are good, taking into consideration what we have eaten before and introducing us to new items on the menu.

Overall, my wife and I are very happy eating at Zafferano and we find prices are reasonable, considering we get a very nice city and bay view, food is great and service is awesome!"
I went here for an appreciation,"I went here for an appreciation dinner with part of my team. We came in for dinner but wanted to enjoy a nice drink at their rooftop first. No problem at all. After that Vadim and his squad took care of us. We had one pax having some allergies, which the booker(me) was not aware of and did not communicate while booking. But they took care of this last minute and prepared an amazing dish for each of us. Con: I left still a but hungry. Thanks for the great service and experience. Will be back!"
One of the best fine dining,One of the best fine dining. Quality food with generous serving. Exemplary service! Highly recommended.
Quality food,"Good quality food, service was pleasant as well. Good selection of wine. Love the lamb dish, risotto was flavourful but a bit hard."
Perfect for business dinner,"Elegant, stylish restaurant with a nice view. Delicious food and excellent service. Smart casual dressing necessary, perfect fit for business dinners."
"A long, relaxed and self indulgent Sunday brunch.","The Sunday Italian brunch is excellent value. The chef is extremely generous and I would say portions should be reduced for two people. Favourite dishes are the saffron risotto, seafood pasta, crab fritatta and olives. The tiramisu is one of the best I’ve tasted. The free flow is indeed free flow but I wish the waiters would check with you before topping up your glass as I’m not a big champagne drinker and would prefer red wine. The atmosphere is wonderful with breathtaking views of Singapore. This is definitely a long, relaxed and self indulgent lunch. My advice to the restaurant would be to stagger courses even more as one can feel overwhelmed by the quantity of the food. Definitely a special celebration venue. We celebrated my husband's birthday and the restaurant produced a surprise dessert."
Zafferan’s ladies night - fabulous!,"Last week I went to Zafferano’s ladies’ night for the first time (I have been to the restaurant several times, which serves delicious food by the way :). I really enjoyed the attentive service and the tasty bites, not to mention the magnificent views over Marina Bay!"
Intimate ROM,"Everything was perfect! The food was amazing. We loved all the dishes in the set menu. The service was impeccable. Jennifer managed to arrange everything for us through whatsapp. Everything went really smooth. Roland, attended to our needs during the ceremony. He was very proactive, polite and attentive. The view outside the resto and the ambiance inside the Wine Room was superb. Overall, we are very satisfied and happy to have chosen this restaurant as venue for our ROM. We will definitely recommend Zafferano to friends."
Lunch Date ❤,"We had brunch to celebrate Valentine's day and i loved everything that was served from starters to desserts. I did not expect a generous serving including the wine, prosecco and other drinks. Ambience is suited for couple and family as well, with nice skydeck view. Staffs were all friendly and we were well attended considering the fully-packed reservation. Price is reasonable! Highly recommended!"
Birthday Celebration,"I booked a dinner reservation at Zafferano to celebrate my wife's birthday. The staff was very helpful and responsive in catering to my request. We had a great experience there, the service was great and the food was delicious. We will definitely come back again!"
"Overpriced and had better food, paid for the view",This is only my personal preference. I tried out the restaurant to bring some people for work Christmas dinner. Saw that the view was good base on some research and also recommendation by someone. I expected as much when it comes to fine dining that serving would be small but didn’t expect it to be that small given it’s my first visit. I’ve been to other Italian places and personally I’d say good quality wise you can get same level for lesser price. Be careful with the meat order as it has a minimum weight order but it’s was honestly quite good. Overall I would come back maybe more for drinks and the view but certainly not the food. I would have hope the staff also was attentive enough to give out suggestions or information about their food.
"Great choice, good view","Selected this restaurant to celebrate our anniversary, and we are not disappointed. Initially reserved the outdoor and didn't realise that it not a good location for dining. Thanks to the friendly staffs to find us a table.

Food is great. Especially to a person like me that do not like mushroom, but I enjoyed so much on the Wagyu with mushroom paste

My family enjoyed the service and food too.
We are warmth to get a surprise desert that wished us on our anniversary.

To end the night with last drink at the terrace with glorious night view.
It summed up a great celebration for us.

Thanks for all the small details and great service.

Will be back.

"Great location, good food, but....","I am a bit sad while writing this review about Zafferano: my expectations were so high, that at the end of the dinner last night I was feeling overall disappointed.
Nothing so say about the location, that is great, in an exclusive place, with great view. Food was indeed good, as it was expected from a fine dining high class place like that.
But....
1) service is not at the level, not very attentive: we were proposed to share mashed potatoes with asparagus after the starters, we agreed, they never arrived!
2) one bread was almost burnt: how can you serve a bread like that in such a restaurant while paying so much?!?
3) temperature in the restaurant was literally freezing. We asked one time to adjust, the waiter said ""already done, it will take a while but will be ok"", after a while we asked again to another waitress, she said ""it is centralized, nothing we can do!"". At least train your staff to give a consistent answer...
4) we were 5, they placed our table next to the bar, at 1.5 meter from the machine the barman use to polish the glasses...making a not loud but annoying noise. Again, in a place like this, possible to put this machine not in face of your guests?!?! this seems common sense to me...
5) price: as said, it is in line with high positioned restaurant, but 42 SGD for 55g of pasta.... We all took the 98 SGD degustation menu 3 dishes, portions are incredibly small.
All in all: first and last time. If I want the view, there's plenty of rooftop bar/restaurant in Singapore, if I want super Italian food, there's plenty of other great Italian restaurants in Singapore."
"Beautifully presented excellent food, outstanding service","Zafferano has its spectacular view going for it - but what about the food? I made arrangements for our party of 3 to celebrate a birthday. Looking at a copy of the Chef's Menu online, the offspring agreed that it was the kind of food we would enjoy. The execution of the menu exceeded the simple descriptions. From the well made amuse bouche right to the final course of 3 delectable petit fours (sorbet infused strawberry!), we enjoyed every bite. In these lockdown times, it evoked for us memories of our last trip to Italy, 2 years ago. The Chef’s Menu offered tastes of fresh prawn, an autumnal fish, pasta cooked simply with sweet crab meat, culminating in top grade Miyazaki wagyu strip loin, cooked perfectly. The “forest” inspired dessert was an outstanding execution of contrasting textures - the crunch a wafer, the bite of top quality chocolate, a smooth mousse. Each plate was beautifully presented and explained clearly, though unobtrusively. Most importantly, it was food you actually enjoyed eating. What sealed the evening was the outstanding service. Thank you! Highly recommended! It’s a not an every day place but delivers outstanding value. I am surely going back."
Good Food Good View,"Nice ambience, located high in the CBD district with an almost 360 glass panels , the whole restaurant looks amazing during the day with natural light. Food was good, had a try on this place during the restaurant week. The only concern is maybe the seatings. Some tables are less attended to. I remember requesting for an extra bread that came very late into the main course, and the table wasn't cleared off after the appetisers, crumbs were visible on the white table cloth. Although it has to be raised twice, the waiter eventually cleared it off."
"Great staff, amazing food,","Great staff, amazing food, superb view. We had an outside seating which is not standard but highly recommended ! Better view than inside the restaurant. Price/value; Good! Wines of course make the bill raise of course but that’s a personal decision. Food/value for sure very good. Thanks to the staff; keep it up!"
Good sunday brunch spread,Good sunday brunch spread with impeccable service! Number of slightly mains could be increased. Overall a good experience and will return.
Amazing Views With Tasty Food,"We had a pretty good lunch here, and the views were superb as the weather was good. We started with the best dish, I thought, which was the heirloom tomatoes in cream. It was light, tasty and refreshing.

I had the wagyu as my main, with foie gras (added supplement). The foie gras was soft, velvety and sumptuous. The beef was okay, if a tad hard. Tastewise, it was good. My wife had the kurubata pork ravioli, but said she did not really enjoy the dish, which she found too earthy, perhaps due to mushrooms, Dessert was valhona chocolate, which was a nice balance between sweet and bitter.

Service was okay, if a little mixed. The Filipina (?) waiter who served us was nice and friendly while the local guy who showed us to our table was a little supercilious. Also, they do seem to require a dress code but we saw foreigners having a weekday lunch in bermudas."
Beautiful evening out,"What a wonderful evening at Zafferano's! My wife and I enjoyed a beautiful evening of great food, good wine, attentive and amazing service with a spectacular view! From the moment we arrived it was professionalism in service from the seating and throughout our meal, truly an enjoyable experience from start to finish! Thanks to the staff for making our night out a memorable one!"
Improved Version!,"I was here few times for lunch few years ago and was not impressed. I mean food was OK so never thought of coming back especially it is located at CBD area. Since CoVid, we like to have a nice dinner once a week and partner says Zafferano, I said ok go book then. He went online and disappointed they need pre-payment before you can have a table. I know resto are hard hit these days and with CoVid measures, less tables and less revenue. But to ask for pre-payment doesn't sit well with many customers. So we said NO! We won't go then. Friday came and suddenly we thought lets ring Zafferano, if they're not fully booked, we walked in! We did and I was impressed.

I forgot they've a really nice view at the deck to have some drinks prior to dinner. We had champagne at deck, no air con but neither is it hot or humid. Dinner we had a la carte and both starter Scallop and Tuna belly were superb! Main course Lamb and Fish didn't fail too. We ended with a Burrata dessert, not too heavy. Looks cute too like a Japanese dessert. 4 glass of wine + 2 champagne and total damaged SGD 412! We thought was reasonable compared to Corner House. :)

Service is very good. Zen Wan was especially attentive and pleasant. Is not easy to serve customers these days with the mask on. So we really appreciate good service when we've some."
Excellent High Quality Italian Food in a great setting,"We'd been meaning to visit Zafferanos for a while and finally decided to book this week. Based at the top of the Ocean Financial Centre with views out over the Marina from the outside terrace.... its not cheap but the food and experience was excellent!
I had the 4 course degustation menu (free choice of Starter, Pasta, Main & Dessert), while my wife had the 3 course version (you decide which of the starter or the pasta you'd like). It seemed that the food was almost all excellent.
The Beef Carpaccio was a great start - well presented with delicious cuts and high quality Parmesan & balsamic vinegar.
The Saffron Risotto doesn't look the most appealing but was one of the best tasting single dishes I've tasted in a long time!! The Tiramisu for Dessert was also exceptional...
The only disappointment was the Lamb main which was very fatty with quite a lot of it too chewy to eat, this seems to be the exception though as my wife's Striploin main was good quality, perfectly cooked and delicious!
We also received great services from our friendly waitress

Not somewhere you'd go every week as its pricey but an excellent date night or special occasion choice."
Ate there during Restaurant Week,Great service but dining there is slightly pricey! Had a set lunch during restaurant week which brings the prices down. Good thing I have just discovered that they are also part of Burpple Beyond which offers 1-for-1 dining on their mains. Will definitely use that in my next visit on full priced menu. (P.S: Try using promo code WOW30 to get 30% off Burpple Beyond subscription on premium plan- you're welcome!).
"Safe, warm and beautiful place for dine in","I had dinner with my friend yesterday 25th March in Zafferano. My friend and I were really impressed by the restaurant team. They are very polite and very attentive.The moment we step in, Lobby one reception girl address us my name, she remember us just because we went there once for a drink during Jan 2020. I am not the person who like to write reviews, but after dine in the restaurant, I have to let everyone knows that there is a place where is safe and make you feel like you are at home, additional with beautiful Marina Skyline View. There is monitoring temperature facility outside of the ocean Financial centre to check our temperature, there are hand sanitizers are available in the restaurant. On the top the reception lady bring us to the table with warm smile. Once we sit down, the service team greeting us by name again. The Manager came to us when we had the 2nd course, he talked to us regards to the situation and make us feel that we are in safe place. During main course time, chef Andrea also came to my table asking for the feedback about the food, all the food are delicious. Overall, we enjoyed very much last night. Definitely, we will come back again. It is really an amazing place for us to dine in."
Disappointing Saturday brunch!,"I just returned from a visit to your restaurant on Saturday, 21 March 2020.

I brought 2 of my friends for a treat at your Saturday champagne brunch. My friends and I gave our honest reviews to the Ukrainian server after the meal just now.

First, I would like to complement your staff. The service by the staff was impeccable. They were warm and friendly, very attentive to our needs. I was very impressed as always, even on my 3rd visit. They were very prompt in refilling our champagnes and was always checking if we needed more food. The service standard was first class!

However, when it came to the quality of the food served, we were very disappointed by Zafferano today. It was my 3rd visit to the restaurant and I was so disappointed by the quality of the food, compared to my last two visits for dinner.

As part of the brunch menu, we were served the saffron risotto which was utterly bland and flat, and next the sea bass for barely edible as it was fishy, and not forgetting that the seafood casserole with mussels/clams were not fresh at all with a slight stench. Only the grilled prawns and lasagna were good, other than that we did not touch most of the cooked food and returned them after tasting a small portion. In general, the cooked food variety was a disappointment.

In fact I was very embarrassed after the brunch. It was a disappointing experience as I thought we would be enjoying the wonderful experience as our maiden brunch experience at Zafferano on a beautiful Saturday, but the three of us walked out feeling very disappointed!

I would like to express my disappointment as today’s experience was far from the last two dinners I had at your restaurant previously. I sincerely hope the restaurant could do something about the ingredients used and consider improvising the quality of cooking."
Dinner,"Cosy atmosphere where nice scenery. Service staffs are excellent. Polite and friendly, their service are great. Every staff will greet us. Food are nice. I definitely will come back again."
"Excellent Service, Food and Atmosphere","The staff was excellent in their service. They were attentive, prompt and were more than happy to answer any questions by guiding us through the menu. Furthermore, they made the dining experience more enjoyable by accomodating to our food requirements by making vegetarian-friendly food which was not necessarily on the menu.

The atmosphere is also really wonderful. This place is fantastic for couples, families, and friends to have a nice Italian dinner. The wine list is brilliant as they have an enormous array of wines to choose from.

Overall experience, a place worth going to for a good evening."
Excellent service!,"Tonight I surprised my boyfriend for his birthday with a dinner at Zafferano and we were simply amazed by the everything! From the moment we stepped in, the view was amazing & service was top notch. I work in the service industry myself so I place service standards above all. Our server, PK (also known as Kumar) was very forthcoming & engaging. He took the time to explain the dishes & wines and we had a lovely conversation with him. The dishes he recommended were to our liking as well! At the end of the meal, my boyfriend was surprised with a birthday dessert as well. I was very amazed because PK and the rest of the staff remembered my requests & my wine choice for the night as well. Also, they made sure to check on us throughout our dinner. Overall, Zafferano is a perfect place for one to bring their dinner date to because of their great views overlooking Singapore city and for their impeccable service as well. To the managers / front of house /servers & chefs in the kitchen, a great job done to making our night a terrific one. Thank you for the excellent job well done! We will be sure to come back for sure!"
Beautiful view. Elegant and,"Beautiful view. Elegant and fancy. The food quality is fine and the menu is interesting. But the service is funny for a pricy place. Super kind waiters but they have no idea of the order of the food in a real Italian restaurant. Examples: We had our starter without getting the wines (until reminding them). And the coffee came before the cheese platter. Now.. nothing horrible, ok, but please don’t call it an Italian restaurant :)"
Exquisite and Excellent Experience,"My experience the moment I step into the restaurant and until my departure was impressive and memorable. My guests and I were treated like VIPs by the greeting staff right up to the Head Chef Andre.
Service was par excellence and the food impeccable. The view of the Marina Bay was exquisite and priceless. The restaurant's ambiance was both welcoming and classy. But most of all was the price!
Fine dining without breaking the bank. Food portion was good and the Wagyu beef steak was heavenly. Will definitely make a return visit. Thank you Zafferano for making my day."
"average food, good service","I'm going to the restaurant quite frequently, the quality fluctuates, the location is great and the service very forthcoming"
Fabulous service,"From the moment I made the booking the service was fabulous, all the staff were very friendly professional and knowledgeable, we were greeted at the door with a very welcoming smile and this smile and warm hospitality continued throughout our visit our waitress and the assistant manager Ivan were excellent and really went the extra mile to ensure we all had a wonderful time, this was our first visit but definitely not the last.
The food was excellent and served so beautifully.
It was my friends birthday and she was made to feel very special with a birthday dessert with candle and personalised plate.... thank you all so much"
Dining High,A wonderful Italian Restaurant with spectacular views especially from the outdoor bar area which overlooks the whole of Marina Bay Sands and surrounding Marina. Stunning menu and impeccable service from excellent waiting staff.
"Breathtaking view, great food and fantastic service!","(I decided to re-submit this review as the earlier version, I wrote our server's name wrongly, and I feel it deserves to be corrected!)

Came with my son because we had a dining voucher to use. Expect semi-fine dining prices amidst cosy and alluring ambience. We were here on a weekday, so it was quiet. The view from the outdoor lounge - of Marina Bay with MBS standing tall - was breathtaking: the restaurant was after all on 43rd floor of Ocean Financial Building.

On recommendation, we ordered the porterhouse steak (min 1kg) as well as a plate of lobster tagliolini to share, complete with champagne. Total cost of dinner was more than 3 times the value of my voucher... but the food was delicious, the view was priceless and the impeccable and personable service of Ivan Lim deserves a special shout out!"
Great views & food,"With breathtaking views of the city, Zafferano lures you with good food, excellent service and a nice ambience."
Diner in the sky,"If you are looking for a magnificent view, need some italian/mediteranian precisely prepared food in the middle of Singapore and spotless service - highly reccomended. Start with some pre-diner bubbles on the terrace in front..."
Italian on vacation,"First-rate hospitality, professional and trained staff, excellent location, well-appointed and clean room. Dishes carefully chosen and well prepared. Excellent service with right timing. Adequate costs."
Outstanding food,"We had Chef menu, and every dish was so balanced, flavourful and beautiful. The chef serve our main course and it was a special touch to our night. Has been nice to chat with him.
The service was not the best i experienced in singapore but overall was ok.
Restaurant forniture look old but the view is breathtaking.
We will be back to try other dishes."
Very good experience,"Every dish was well presented, elegant and very tasty. Kudos to Chef! Service was good too. The view is incredible, we will definitely visit again."
U pay only for the setting and view,"Perhaps like me u can choose this restaurant for entertaining a guest. But even for that there r far better choices in Singapore. The service is robotic and the food so bland and contrived that u think it may have been prepared by a robot too Italian food is my favorite cuisine... hearty, fabulous combinations and freshness of ingredients; Zafferano has none of that. Forgettable."
Service and food was more than wonderful,"We came here for the new year eve dinner and it was extremely good. The food was delicious and looked like Michelin. The service was more than amazing, everything was quick and delicate. I really recommend it."
Diiner,The service was abit slow because there was a lack of staff but the guy who had attended to us gave us a really good service experience.
Company event held at Zafferano!,"Company event held at Zafferano!
Absolutely fantastic service but will specially like to thank the 2AM (Ivan Lim & Zen Wan) that serve us on that day.
Thank you will visit again. Cheers"
Good food but even better service,Was there for dinner and served by Prasoon. He was most attentive and spot on with all his recommendations. I would suggest you keep space for their desserts like molten lava cake or their fresh sorbet which comes with preparations by the table side. The show is very entertaining.
Personal service,"Ordered two sets of Degustation menus. Pleasant service . Ivan , the assistant manager who was serving us was extremely professional and attentive. Happy night ."
Wonderful Dinner,"My family had a great experience at Zafferano.
The ambience and food were wonderful.
In particular our server, Chona was attentive and professional.
Would love to go back again."
Remarkable view. indulging time.,Loved total atmosphere with great friendly staff. View was astonishing and it was one of the best moments to spend with precious friends.
Food was excellent and the view of the sea and MBS is super nice,"The cocktails were great, the food was excellent but more than that the staff are just so good and so friendly.
drinks at Terrace and Wine Lounge allows a more laid back indulgence."
Superb View but food average,"I went with my friend and we really enjoyed the view in the restaurant. A bit disappointed with the food taste and the beef was tough. I feel is not worth the price for dinner (not sure if my expectation was too high after reading so many good reviews). However, I would highly recommend to go there for view and some drinks."
Great food and excellent service!,"Great food and excellent service! The staff were attentive and friendly. Visited for my anniversary and a complimentary dessert was given as well! :) Not to mention, the view was really impressive. Definitely enjoyed my visit!"
"Great food, good people",I like the food. They were very nicely presented and were delicious! The staff are well trained and very attentive to details. One of the better experiences I had in a fine dining restaurant.
A special evening,"All of us had a fantastic time at Zafferano's, for a business dinner.

From the drink at the lounge to the dessert, everything was perfect. The burrata was creamy, the pasta cooked to a perfect al dente, and the beef was tender and charred just the way we wanted it.
Compliments to the chef and all the staff, our guests were delighted and so were we.
I will definitely look at coming back for a special occasion."
Willis Towers Watson : Risk & Analytics Team Bonding : 18/9/19 (Drinks),"Thank you for attending to our team: Risk & Analytics on the 18 Sep 2019 for drinks from 6:30 pm to 8:00 pm. The team were very happy with the team bonding session; despite the haze.

We will come again to your restaurant and introduce your restaurant to others."
Private Event for 150 pax,"It was my wife's 50th Birthday celebrations and I came and met Jennifer the Events Manager at Zaffarano while scouting for a place. The restaurant has an outstanding location and we booked the entire restaurant and outside Bar area with the spectacular views. I researched a bunch of restaurants in Singapore but Jennifer with her hands on client servicing was by far amazing. She was most accomodative on many requests including getting our DJ, having a large team serving at the party, the menu selection, alcohol availability and finally the overall quote. Friendly reminders from her as the event came nearer helped the planning.

On the evening of the event from 5 PM to 4 AM !! No less !! Jennifer was there with her Operations Manager Vadim Korob, Arif the super Head Bar Incharge and a team of most polite service staff ensuring that all the guests were having a blast.

Ours was a raucous event with a few glasses that invariably break in a dance party. No frowns whatsoever and if we went to help everyone from Vadim down was ready to brush the piece with a broom and telling my friends worry not just party. One doesnt generally experience such a high level of service standards anywhere leave alone Singapore.

The food and starters were great, the alcohol service was completely on the ball.

It was an excellent event enjoyed and remembered by many. This experience could never have been possible without the high integrity of effort by Jennifer, Vadim, Arif and many other staff who's names I should have had with me to thank them.

Anyone planning a big bash. Dont think twice. Zafferano is the place.

Thanks Jennifer, Vadim, Arif and Team Zafferano !!"
Delicious tartufo pizza and great for business social dinner,"Delicious tartufo pizza and great view.. Good for social business drinks and finger food kind of dinner..
Only downside is cancelation within 48hrs will cost you $80/pax #BOOooooo"
Restaurant with a great view!,"Enjoyed the spectacular city & Marina Bay view from the 43rd floor of an office building in CBD Singapore. Well-mixed beef tenderloin tartare with 25yrs aged balsamic vinegar (could have more of it instead of 5 dots); followed by perfectly cooked house-made ravioli with guinea fowl stuffing; and the plat de resistance was the charcoal-grilled lamb rack, lightly seasoned with Middle-eastern slices. The wonderful dinner was appropriately finished with a chocolate & hazelnut tart. The only regret was that the quality of the service did not match that of the food."
A great place for an authentic Italian meal!,"Came here for a late dinner with my friend. We decided to have some cocktails and food at the lounge area. The terrace has the magnificent view of the city. The ambiance of these place is something what most of us seek after a long day of errands. A perfect place to end the day with a glass of champagne or martini. The food was amazing. Both my friend and I been here for few times and we always look forward for that good homemade pizza and pasta! A traditional, simple and authentic Italian meal! I think the price of food and drinks are very reasonable for the quality and service that you will get from them.
Staff are very accommodating and friendly.
Will come back here very soon."
Excellent service and food!,"A party of 8 celebrating my birthday and we had little one with us so we dined in the private room. The food was amazing and the service was outstanding. Yaro was very accommodating with us and provided excellent suggestions for sharing. The food was artfully displayed and tasted wonderful. He is also very well versed in the origins of the food and drinks and regaled us with the interesting stories of the dishes when asked. Would highly recommended if you are looking for good food, awesome view, great stories and a laid back atmosphere for dinner!"
On top of the world,"This restaurant (and bar) on the 43rd floor of the Ocean Financial Centre in the heart of Singapore's CBD (Central Financial District) offers sensational views over the Marina Bay and seashore - made all the more remarkable by the presence of a lush tropical garden surround. The restaurant itself is stylish, modern and classy and, like the food it serves, has a light touch. The two kitchens and their staff are also on open display.
The lunchtime menu offers extremely good value - with a three course lunch at SIN$ 52. There is adequate choice to suit all tastes (including vegetarian) and the food is well prepared, tasty and attractively presented. The wine list encourages consumption - either by the glass or by the bottle. Service is extremely friendly, efficient and attentive.
Bottom line: we can hardly wait to dine again. Viator Coloniae"
"Nice views, but nothing outstanding","Had lunch here with several people. The views are quite spectacular and the service is quite good, but the food itself is largely unremarkable."
Tasty food with great view,We had a drink in the outdoor lounge before our dinner where you can have panoramic view of the city. The restaurant offers less view but the food and service are excellent. The oysters were very fresh and the radish sorbet added to the taste. Then we had their signature porterhouse which was done perfectly. A very nice place for a special occasion.
Amazing food and amazing view,The food here is outstanding and so is the view. We went here for a surprise dinner and it was one of the best places I've been to. We can really recommend the tasting menu and their chocolate lava cake was to die for.
"Amazing Views, Food, and Service","We love Zafferano's - I highly recommend sharing it friends who enjoy good wine and delectable food. The service is top notch, the food is fabulous (they made the most lovely gluten free / dairy free pasta dish for me - a touch of chili, garlic, olive oil ... omg, to die for!) and the oysters were fabulous. Let the servers guide your plates and you can't go wrong. Not to mention, ladies night (used to be on Thursdays) is sooooo much fun :) If you go, be ready to dance and let loose and meet some great people!"
