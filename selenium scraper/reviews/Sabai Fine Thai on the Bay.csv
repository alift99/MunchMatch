Amazing food and service!,"We dined at Sabai last night, and are so pleased that we did. From the outset, the service was first class, friendly but attentive. We were given time to study the menu and order drinks, the service was steady and unrushed. We were able to discuss the menu with the waiter, and adjust the level of spiciness if needed. Starters were brought out in stages, so time to enjoy the various flavours. Mains were a good portion size and were totally delicious. Our waiter ordered a taxi for us, and even escorted us to the pick up area.
Service and food were of the highest quality, I highly recommend visiting Sabai!"
Wonderful Thai experience,"Wonderful Thai experience Lovely food, the green curry is sublime and nice complimentary wine list too. Nice location. Wonderful service too, very attentive and very warm. Highly recommended."
BEL,Excellent food and service. For once i tasted fresh chicken in the green curry. Even the rice for the mango sticky rice was of exceptional texture and taste. Restaurant is pricey but u get what u pay for. Will be my only thai place to go to.
No comparison to Jim Thomson,"Unfortunately expectations and outcome were a wide distance apart. The service was average, the decor dated and the food was better at our local carry out. This is simply not fine Thai"
Excellent Thai food,"We visited here 2 years ago just before the pandemic and received such a warm welcome we just had to return on our next stopover in Singapore. The welcome this time was just as warm and the food superb. In fact after a month long stay in SE Asia this is the restaurant we keep talking about! The spring rolls were to die for and my husband requested an extremely spicy beef curry - and they didn't disappoint! I also enjoyed the most exquisite prawn curry. We are planning on visiting the Far East in March again and this will be our first port of call. The wonderful manager took the time to talk to us and explain how all the food was prepared and cooked which was fascinating. Can't wait to return! The Souths, UK"
Most money minded management,"Went with my daughter for lunch. Sat outside and decided to order some pineapple fried rice and some tofu vegetable.

The pineapple rice came with fried cashewnyts on the side. We immediately called the server and requested him to replace the dish as she was allergic to nuts. He readily agreed to and then charged us for the rice! When I requested them to remove it as we hadn’t touched a morsel, he said he can’t. So I called the manager who I have seen on several occasions and I used to be a frequent regular customer kind you.

But he was downright condescending; rude and said I have to charge it because I cannot RE sell it.

The food was really bad. The look of the pineapple rice was a yellow rice with some diced carrots. The tofu dish wr ordered had more beans than tofu and was tasteless. The olive rice which we thought was a replacement was decent

So we paid about $30 for food we didn’t eat because of genuine allergies for which the restaurant had no concern about. I have found very rude service at this place and arrogance on multiple occasions. So if you’re going to enjoy yourself, this is the worst place to go! I would recommend Jim Thomson and it’s stellar service ten times over this.!"
Lovely,We had a very nice dinner here. The food and service were very good and it was a nice atmosphere. Definitely worth a visit.
Terrible food and waited long for my orders to be taken!,"Visited this place for my birthday in view of the highly-rated reviews. I was so disappointed! Waited so long for them to take our orders which we realized later the reason. Only one man was taking the orders. At least if the food is awesome, I don't mind the wait. The food was a great disappointment. In fact, those Thai food outlets at Golden Mile taste so much better - cheap, and good. We will definitely not go to this restaurant again."
Luxury Thai food by the water.,Very pleasant business lunch in well respected Thai restaurant by the water. Standard Thai offerings with excellent service. A tad expensive but it is located in CBD. Luxury Thai vs more local authentic Thai at cheaper prices. Depends on your mood and wallet. But this this definitely recommended if you can afford it.
"Delicious, authentic Thai food with impeccable service",We loved our dinner here! The food was delicious and the setting perfect - we sat outside sheltered from the rain and enjoyed the fabulous view. The service was also very kind and attentive - we will be back.
Super Best Food and Services,First time got impressed by services in Singapore. Superb services and Food was out of the world. Sabai Thai is one of the Best Restaurant in Singapire
Some of the best Thai food in Town!,"This place came highly recommended by a bunch of friends and were they right! The food was absolutely marvellous! We loved everything we tried from the pad thai to the mango salad, the curries and the stir fry veggies! Their 3-chilli oil/sauce concoction is out of this world! The gamut of choices for vegetarians as well as the lovely service, especially by Mr. Nithi, who is a gem of a person and the most amazing host/GM, Mr. Joe (manager) as well as all the other staff made for an amazing evening!

Although, the last 1.5-2 years has been particularly harrowing for restaurants and the F&B industry on the whole, it was still a pleasure to witness that these tough times of uncertainty have not robbed the smiles (albeit hidden behind masks), warmth and kindness from the entire team at Sabai who went the extra mile to ensure their guests leave with their appetites satiated and their hearts full.

Thank you so much for everything. We will be back..again and again, very soon! Until then, stay safe, stay healthy."
Food is good but waitress needs to learn manners,"Business lunch and we ordered mains and a salad to share. Throughout the business lunch conversations, the waitress rudely interjected multiple times, asking what drinks we want, what we want to order, do we need more rice, coffee, etc. She would raise her voice and stand in the middle of 2 persons talking to ask her questions. By the third time it was extremely irritating and rude as she didn't seem to take the cue that she should know when to ask and when to shut up. As it was a business lunch, we didn't want to make a scene since we were with clients but as a fine dining restaurant, waiters/waitresses should be taught basic manners, look for cues as to when to ask questions (wait till guests finish talking or take a pause) rather than raise their voice to attract attention. Even though food was OK, the price tag was extremely expensive and certainly not worth it. I won't go on my own."
Great Expierence,"Great food (light, tasty and tons of options for vegetarians), good service (attentive staff). Only odd thing was a charge for tap water (it was just a dollar but odd still!). Will go back for sure."
Exceptional Thai Cusine and Service in Singapore Customs House on Marina Bay,"It is always a pleasant surprise in Singapore to find a restaurant which excels in Thai cuisine, exceptional service and a good selection of wines and beers.

Sabai Fine Thai on the Marina Bay in the Singapore Customs House is an excellent choice for taking special guests, clients, friends and colleagues for special events, celebrations and achievements.

The friendly and helpful service at the Sabai main entrance, was the first sign to me that Sabai understands the client experience begins a the front door and how their guests and customers are greeted and truly made to feel welcomed.

I appreciated the attentiveness of the Sabai employees, who were focused on the needs of my business guest and me, in fining a suitable table for two to celebrate a special event.

The menus are designed in an easy to read, uncomplicated format, focusing on helpful descriptions of the unique spices and ingredients of each dish.

The waitpersons were professional and subtle, in attending to our needs contributing to an enjoyable dining experience for us.

Indoor and outdoor dining is available, including an outside bar for cocktails and drinks and walkways along Singapore Marina Bay for a stroll before or after the delicious meal and tasty wine, beer or cocktails.

Sabai is located in the Singapore Customs House which is an easy walk from the Raffles Place MRT and Singapore-Central Business District (CBD).

I look forward to my next visit already."
My fav Thai restaurant,We dined at ST when they were at Ngee Ann City as well as at this current location. We hosted our overseas guests and all the dishes recommended were simply great and offered a good variety of Thai cooking. Great views of the Marina Bay too if you seat outdoors or have a leisurely walk after a sumptuous meal. Thanks.
Bad Experience,"We were in group of seven and had dinner on 8th Feb 2020 at this restaurant. We found charges too exorbitant compared to food. Most shocking was the charges for drinking water !!!!!!!
At the outset only we had informed that we do not want bottled or mineral water. We want regular water to drink.They provided us with regular water as per our desire. But we were charged for drinking water at the restaurant inspite of the fact that we all had full course dinner.
Nowhere in the world in any restaurant we had such an experience.

It is not about money. If we were bothered about money we would not have taken dinner here but we felt we were fleeced and cheated.

Great Outdoor Dining,"This is more a fusion food place than a Thai restaurant. But it does serve superlative Thai food as well. It justifies its description as a fine dining Thai restaurant.

It’s greatest allure is it’s wonderful outside dining. The tables are set out on one of the quays, right next to the water, with wonderful views of the boats docked in the harbour and the glass & steel buildings that surround.

We went there in the early evening for a family dinner. We were seated outside on the deck, on comfortable chairs, and were helped by the smiling staff to select from an extensive menu. They served excellent vegetarian options, and the Thai dishes were cooked to our taste - the chilli was appropriately modified in the curries. They had a good selection of wines to go with the food, and the beer was really cold.

The food has great taste and the portions are generous. Being Thai food, it can be shared so it is always better to order for the table.

What one takes away is the ambience of a clear Singapore evening descending on the waters, of buildings lighting up for the night, and of the warm breeze.

This is al-fresco dining at its best in Singapore."
A wonderful experience,"My wife and I had an amazing steamed sea bass, with rich and perfectly balanced flavors.

The service was also lovely, attentive without being the least intrusive.

Our kids were very pleased too, so all in all we had a wonderful experience and give it 5 stars of course."
Pomelo salad is excellent,Went for lunch on a working day. The food is top class. Service is good. Highly recommended the pomelo salad followed by the green curry for the main course.
Too expensive for average Thai,"Too expensive for a very average Thai dinner. The view is not even that great as the restaurant doesn’t have a frontal view of the bay. If you sit outside your view is totally blocked by caffe fernet’s building. There wasn’t even a laser show in the bay due to Corona virus. They charge 4.5 SGD plus 17 percent tax and service for rice per person, not per bowl. A Singa pint costs 19 SGD plus 17percent.. you get the pix."
Always good,I always love eating at this restaurant. Food is great! Try the prawns and the olive rice. Pamelo salad is delish!
Excellent Thai Restaurant in Central Location,"On a stop over from Australia was recommended to try this Restaurant.Well located beside the Fullerton Hotel at Marina Bay.
Extensive menu to cater for all tastes and very extensive wine list. The wine list is expensive but we were offered a wine not on the list while still expensive was excellent at $79?
We had satay chicken skewers to share followed by two red curries (chicken and duck) which were excellent.The staff were very helpful and friendly.
While it’s a wee bit expensive the food is of the highest quality and the location and views at nighttime are great.
Overall we enjoyed our meal and were looked after very well and would recommend a visit."
Ideal for business lunches,"@TheKuoKnows

Not once have I been disappointed on my four visits to Sabai. It’s true that prices are a little higher than elsewhere. The two-course set lunch at around $30 a pop is hardly a snip.

But the quality if the food is good and the service is slick.

The Prawn Cakes make a great start to a meal. The Thai Red Beef Curry is tasty without being overpowered by chilli.

Sabai does what it is supposed to do without too much fuss. Ideal for business lunches."
Extremely over priced,"Extremely over priced for the average food and service quality:
1. They charged S$4 per person for steam rice.
2. $0.7 for tap water.
3. For a big party, we ordered 2 portions of each dish. However, they charged addional S$10 per dish for upsize without first getting our consent. We ended up having excess food.
4.We had mainly chicken and vegetable dishes. No exotic seafood or premium beef. We paid over S$80/person without alcohol beverages.
Service was hit and miss. One of the lady staff had poor personal hygiene."
Authentic Thai Fine Dining with Great Atmosphere of Marina Bay,"As Marina Bay is my favourite area in Singapore. Especially at evening time, I see a lot of locals and expats hanging out around here. The restaurant located near old Customs House building is a short walking distance from Financial Centre and Marina Bay Sands. You'll get a good atmosphere enjoying your food and drinks.

SABAI is a great choice if you wanna hang out with friends or relax after a long day work. My first impression is the decoration of the restaurant which has a Thai feeling into it. I had a chance to talk to the owner's family members and found out that they have been doing Thai Food business in Singapore for over 30 years, so I was quite certain the food should be good.

I love to try Thai food in many places around the world when I travel. I normally start with familiar dishes, but for here, I was recommended to try some adapted dishes as well. Here are the dishes what I would recommend to you :

#1 Chinese Bun with Green Curry Chicken
This can be a good appetiser. Thai people are familiar with Chinese Bun (Pao) stuffed with minced pork and eggs. At SABAI, it is stuffed with original flavoured Thai Chicken Curry. The taste is real curry chicken! Great to have it with beer or soft drinks before main dishes.

#2 Pomelo Salad
In Thailand, this dish has recently become a hit, maybe due to its easiness to dine. I mean it can be both appetiser and main dish. The taste is sour and a bit spicy. It is considered a herbal dish, good for your health and light for your stomach. I love the way they serve here which is one bite at a time.

#3 Deep-Fried Baked Pork Ribs with Honey
This one is a special dish. The pork was marinated in Thai style with herbs and some sauce for a few days before it was baked, so the pork meat becomes soft and the taste is really good!

#4 Steamed Fish with Chilli and Lime
I love this dish so much because the taste is a good mix of spiciness and sourness. The fish is fresh and tender. They use fillet of Cod Fish. It goes along well with hot-served jasmine rice.

#5 Tom Yum Goong (Prawn Tom Yum)
This is a must-eat. They serve the clear version soup, filled with many kinds of herbal ingredients like galangal, mint, lime, tomatoes, and mushrooms. The prawns are big and juicy.

#6 Green Curry Roasted Duck
In Thailand, we're used to have Red Curry Roasted Duck, but it might taste a little too sweet for some people, so they chose to adapt the recipe to Green Curry instead. The taste is still authentic for me, though. Don't forget the rice.

#7 Pineapple Fried Rice
This is a good choice for many of us. Fried rice with pineapple topped up with dried minced pork and cashew nuts. The look is so tempting as it is served in a real pineapple fruit.

#8 Mojito
Sometimes, it is interesting to pair your dishes with some drinks. Mojito here is homemade and made from ginger and lime syrup, mixed with fresh lemongrass and ginger. Not too strong.

One common thing is that, in all dishes, they decorate the dishes with carved fruits or vegetables, making each dish look so beautiful. The chef here really loves this kind of Thai arts.

But above all, the taste is authentic Thai, so I can be assured if I bring my friends here, they will have a chance to have great Thai food, not different from what I have in Thailand.

It is not surprising that this restaurant has received a lot of awards and certifications including 'Thai Select Premium' which means not only the food taste is real Thai, but the decoration and ambience of the restaurant has a Thai flavour too.

If you are in Singapore and crave for Thai food, this is one great choice!"
Good but pricey,"We went there for birthday celebration. We had a nice table at a corner. Service was good.

Food was generally nice but pricey. We tried tom yam seafood, green curry, papaya salad, pomelo salad, spring roll, prawn cake, steam fish, basil beef, morning glory and 3 types of dessert.

I would say the steam fish lack the thai way which I had in Thailand. As for dessert, the mango with glutinous rice was grossly overpriced. The mango is small and the rice, a tablespoon and not cooked through. In fact, our 6 plates of dessert cost more than $100. More pricey than the other dishes we had. Go for tapioca or coconut ice cream would be a better choice for dessert.

The other items we ordered were all nice."
"Very nice Thai food, reasonable prices","A good find in amongst Singapore’s many restaurants. We just happened to pass it whilst walking around the quay and thought it looked worth a try, so we booked a table for the same evening. Pleased we did.
The food was authentic and excellent, and reasonably priced for the area.
The only downside for us was a limited choice of wine by the glass, and what we had was ok, but not great. I guess a lot of people drink beer with a Thai meal so maybe that’s why."
Succulent meat,Business vibes; good food and view of marina bay. The meat was juicy and flavourful. The spice was very Thai tasting.
Great business lunch,"Fresh, fast and great service. Home made tum yum with clear broth... among the best I’ve had... mouth starts watering in anticipation a day before I travel to Singapore.

Expensive relative to other good Thai in hawker markets, but paying for air conditioning, business friendly set up, attentive waitstaff, and fresh made to order food..."
Good food and consistent,"Been to this place multiple time and have always forgotten to write about it. The curry's green, red or yellow are ALL good and have it with Olive Rice. Starters are also good and so is the lemon grass coolers. Keep space for sticky rice and mango or the ruby red coconut milk dish. Worthy to book and plan for having a meal here"
Fantastic - especially for vegetarians,This is a real gem. The food is really authentic and they have a large number of vegetarian options. They went out of their way to get off the menu vegetarian food and service was outstanding.
Had tasty Thai food after a Long time,"I went to this restaurant as my Friend is a huge fan of this place. Being a Thai food lover, I went along and am thankful that I did. We ordered for Mango Salad, crispy chicken with red chillies and cashewnuts, red Thai curry in chicken again with Thai Jasmine rice. The awesome fragrance of food, the sight of the dishes served, the clean ambience, the freshness and good quality of food made for an excellent culinary experience. Plus I did not suffer from any tummy issues afterwards, an indication that the food was freshly prepared.
My only advice is to book an appointment and go early to eat as it tends to get crowded and full in matter of minutes. I highly recommend this place for good food and good service."
a touch of Thai in the marina,"food was very tasty and not too spicy , very confortable food service was very pleasant and the view of the high-rise from the marina is beautiful at night"
Authentic Thai Food in Singapore,Genuine Thai food restaurant in Singapore. Has indoor and outdoor dining area. Reservation recommended on weekends. Friendly staff and willing to assist with food selection
I love Thai cuisine and Sabai certainly was not what I would call 'fine'.,"Before I give my review let me give some context on which I base it. I travel extensively and love Thai food and so eat in a Thai Restaurant at every opportunity as I travel the globe on business and pleasure (look at my reviews and you will see many for Thai Restaurants). So when visiting Singapore I went to 'Sabai Fine Thai' for dinner one evening. The restaurant had a good ambiance and feel to it and the menu was as you would expect in a Thai restaurant with all the usual options. However from there on it just disappointed in every way...

The Service was average at best, not at all attentive and somewhat stand-offish.
They even charged 10% Service Charge on the bill, so I 'tipped' for poor service!
My food was bland - Thai food is never bland!
The portion size of my Pad See Eew was below the average I'd expect.
My Chicken Satay was just unpleasant and I think under cooked in places as well.
My meal price (SG$56) was too high for the food delivered, not good value at all.

In summary I would not visit Sabai Thai again and I could not recommend it. There is far better Thai food to be had in Singapore. It was 'Sabai Poor Thai on the Bay' for me!"
Fine Dining Thai Style?,"Let's start with the good stuff: the food is pretty good! The problem though is that the overall experience is not as engaging as it could be. Yes, it absolutely looks more like fine dining compared to other Thai restaurants, however it doesn't offer the authenticity that many other Thai places have. So in short, we can't say anything bad about the food, but we would pay the higher price for it again. For a score in the middle, not bad, not a true recommendation."
Not really fine dining but the food is good,"The food is authentic and tasty. They are marketing this place as a fine dining venue, which isn't really the case (except for the prices). Their weekday set lunch is about 35 or so. Besides the location (at customs house) there is nothing ""fine"" about dining here. I am not faulting their ambiance or their service or even their food. I am just saying you can get the same for better prices elsewhere.

If you want to take a client for nice Thai food around cbd, this is probably your best bet. But if you want to enjoy some good Thai food with your family, choose one of the other excellent Thai restaurants in Singapore."
Disappointing,"Decent portion sizes, but the food's authenticity is questionable. If you're looking for a Thai place that's close to the water (this restaurant is right under the CBD's buildings, and doesn’t face the actual Bay Area), go here. But do your wallet a favor and go to Lau Pa Sat for food of similar quality - at 1/30th the price. Side note: they even charge for tap water."
Amazing Authentic food,"Perhaps the best Thai food I ever had, I had an unforgettable dining experience. The food was amazing especially the coconut drink served in the original peeled shell was simply great & refreshing."
Great Thai Dining Experience!,"The location and ambience is great. Simply love the Crispy rice crackers served with simmered minced chicken and minced prawns in coconut milk, Thai Red Curry, Steamed cod with bird’s eye chilli, garlic and fresh lime juice and of course the sticky rice with mango dessert."
Still Angry,"The restaurant was generally ok as was the food. I had been looking forward to a return visit to this, far from cheap, restaurant and was feeling quite sanguine until I read the bill. They had charged 50cents each for tape water! Now in know in the scheme of things this was not much to pay but FOR TAP WATER? When I questioned the charge I was told all the restaurants do it. NO THEY DO NOT!

Sadly, a pleasant evening was ruined by this rather irritating charge. I will not go again to this restaurant - this silly charge cannot be justified. I am happy to pay any bill, however pricey, but do not like silly trivial bits being added.

Sorry Sabai you have blown it."
All your Thai favorites,"They had my favorites on the menu--items in a red curry coconut sauce, Thai iced tea, and sticky rice with mango for dessert."
Superb food and ambience,"The family decided on a birthday celebration here, to enjoy the incredible view of historic Singapore harmonizing with its modern achievements. The view was excellent and so was the food. We decided to order several dishes to share, and loved each dish. The vegetarians among us were well pleased too."
A place to forget,"The worst Thai restaurant ever! The spring rolls were cold and gummy, prawns floated in a disgusting ketchup sauce, rice and noodles were overcooked. The decor of the inside dining hall is dismal, the outside area unremarkable. On top of all this it is also expensive. absolutely no value for money."
Enjoyable Thai Food.,"We had visited Sabai on Friday night, ordered a few dishes; Tom yam Soup, fried fish in salt and chili, pad Thai and Chicken in basil leaves. The food was authentic and tasty. The price range is considered to be mid - high range depending on what is ordered. The food and ambience was overall decent."
Simply exceptional,"Have been a regular at Sabai Thai. Pak Nithi is simply exceptional and an outstanding F&B professional.

His keen eye for detail whether it is the special rice imported from Thailand or the fresh coconut water or delicious mangoes coming from across the border is a work of art.

I personally love the Phad Thai and have difficulties in deciding which curry to go in for . Make the decision making simple by following the green , yellow or red sequence and then repeat."
Great Thai food,Lovely and delicious Thai food in the city. Very nice surroundings and good for strolls when the weather is not too hot! Should be quite lovely in the evening. Had lunch with friends and the food was well presented and the taste is good. Service was a little short handed but still ok. Highly recommend this place for Thai food. The dessert was very good!
The best Thai in Singapore,I love Sabai Thai for its food and the lovely outdoors. Dining with a view. Must try - Steamed Sea Bass with Lime and Chilli
Exquisite Cuisine!,"Absolutely fantastic service and quality of food. We didn't make a reservation for lunch during the weekday although they had a table for us outside conveniently.

The dishes came out timed perfectly one after another and they tasted perfect side by side. All of the authentic Thai dishes that you could want are all there and perfectly rich leaving every last bite wanting more!

This is by far, one of the Thai restaurants I'd bring my entire family to because it's authentic and extremely delicious!

Go and see for yourself!"
Enjoyable,"I come here regularly for business lunches and generally happy with the food and service.

What’s great here is the pomelo salad, green curry, pad Thai, stir fry beef gravy noodles and red ruby dessert. Thai ice tea is great too.

It is on the pricey end for Thai but the food quality is consistent and reliable."
nice Thai in nice environment,Always great Thai here with good attentive service and nice outdoor space can't complain on anything if you want some genuine Thai
Special Water View,My favorite Thai food in town and the Pomelo salad and Green Chicken curry are my staples now. Excellent service.
Dinner,Food was just average but overpriced. Service is not fantastic and they seem too busy to stay and take the full order. We ordered vegetarian salad but they served with fish sause. We called out to have it checked and they admitted it was mistake by kitchen. We went as a party of 4 and ordered 6 dishes with beer and it cost us more than $200. Food and service was average.
Great Thai food,Sabai Fine Thai offers consistently great food and service. Highlights include the red and green curries which are spicy with great flavour while both the papaya and green mango salads are refreshing and light. They also serve terrific brown rice.
"Quiet, great quality lunch","Standard menu, fast and great ingredients with a fair amount of spice. Service reasonable but not overly attentive, they have enough foot traffic and business executives not to care. A good choice"
Consistently Great.,"I've been coming here for years, and have never had a bad meal. It's equally good for dining with friends, family and clients. The staff have been here for a while, and they remember return customers.

Service is prompt, and I can bring an important client there with the assurance that we can sit down, order and focus on our business discussion without worrying about slow service or bad quality food.

It's also one of a few restaurants in the Central Business District with a decent selection in their menu for vegetarians. In many other restaurants, you know what the vegetarian diner will eat even before you arrive - as there is only one vegetarian starter and one vegetarian entree on the menu.

Finally, even though it is a fine dining restaurant, I have never felt pressured to spend. I can get a Pad Thai and a beer there, dine alone, and still leave with the feeling that I've had a great meal and great service."
Really good Thai food,"Nice spot in marina bay. Inside and outside tables Thai food was very good, esp the Pomelo Salad, wonderfully done Good wine list reasonably priced Service pretty good Will will go back"
Rushed out the door,"Went to Sarbai for NYE. While the food wasn’t too bad, the service was annoying. We had a 6 course set menu and were constantly being rushed for the next course, even though we were there for NYE and the fireworks at mid-night. We had a table next to the waiters station and I think we shared half the night with the waiters, who it felt were at the table with us - it was really close.

Toilets were outside and I got wet each time I had to go due to the rain.

In the end, we had a nice night in spite of this but I wouldn’t be in a hurry to go back - definitely not fine dining."
Expensive but good Thai in great location,"Good Thai, with seating available outside by the bay. Expensive, with beers the most expensive we found in Singapore. Was very quiet when we were there and so there was little atmosphere. Would try and find a more reasonably priced Thai restaurant next time."
Pricey and decent,The atmosphere is amazing and the service was excellent during our visit. Menu selection is ok but be prepared to pay higher. It's very pricey and the taste is ok. Not too bad but maybe not worth the price. the steamed fish with lime is good. It was a good first experience but I may not come back again.
Good food but slow service,"The food was good but slow service at this restaurant. Quite cramped between the tables. Seemed quite popular, but unfortunately you were quickly forgotten, kind of overlooked, if you apparently were not a big spender. No toilet inside,but around the corner where they shared toilets with many others! Although we was not happy with this restaurant it was a nice area to spend the evening."
Very satisfying quality food,"I had lunch at Sabai Thai in October with two family members and had a very enjoyable and satisfying meal. Would recommend the pomelo salad, stuffed chicken wings, fried prawn cakes and tomyam seafood soup."
Good Thai dining with veg options,Good overall Thai food. We had a private seating area on the upper level which was private. I had the vegetarian options and the portions and the preparations were excellent.
Good Thai food and great location,"We went to Dinner at Sabai Fine Thai, and very much enjoyed the food. The flavour was great and the way the dishes were presented was very appealing. We frequently eat Thai food, and this is for sure one of my favourite places. For any europeans, please be careful, the dishes can by quite spicy. If you however ask the waiters to not make it too spicy it shouldn't be a problem.

What was amazing, was the view that came with the food. We sat outside and therefore were able to see the entire Singapore skyline at night. I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere especially with this beautiful backdrop.

The one critique point would be the waiters. The staff was forthcoming when asking for special requests, however they did however seem very busy and not quite as attentive as in other places. We also had to wait for two of our entries, which meant that the rest of the table had to eat even though not everyone had their food yet."
Not what you can expect,"The restaurant is well located near Fullerton on the bay.
We did not enjoy the food, nor the service. They are very expenive and food was below average.
Very disappointing indeed and by far too expensive for what you get.
The same for the quality of the food - it was just not good and we eat a lot of Thai and Asian.
We can not recommend it."
Good Thai food,Had taken out some colleagues who were visiting us to this place. Nice food with a quite a few options available for vegetarians. Good place for formal lunch / dinner near the bay
Very good,"Visited for dinner. Just a minute walk from the Fullerton Bay Hotel. Tables were covered with white cloth, dishes tasted so good, beautiful Marina view from the outside tables, staffs were all good. Nothing to complain. S$150.00 for 2.

This restaurant is supposed to be closed for 2 weeks (till end-Sept) for renovation."
Good Thai Food,"Had dinner at Sabai and since I am a vegetarian I was quite particular about the food I eat. Sabai is highly recommended if you are a vegetarian since they have a a lot of vegetarian dishes. I asked for a seating on the outside by the water and with lovely weather, it was a very good experience. Food was very good and the quantity of dishes was more than enough for 2 people to share. Waiters were very helpful and took very attentive care during dinner. Overall, a very good spot to eat if you are looking for a nice quiet dinner. Good value for money"
Nice ambience,"Was there with my ex- boss for dinner as we haven't been catching up for a good 2 years!! He plan the venue and indeed it was a nice ambience with a very good location ,nice sea view. We were seated indoors and service was warmth and genuine.Entrees and mains are of good portion and a good blend as well.We were serve by a gentleman (unsure of his name)But he looks A little from Laos or Nepal.Great service from him and he is very attentive as well and anticipating.

Will recommends this place to my friends as the ambience is very welcoming.

Thank you very much."
Great Thai food,"Had some good Thai food at this place. We were a large group and we got seating on the 1st floor - almost seemed like a private dining area.
I liked their red, greed curries as well as the raw papaya salad.
The ambience of the restaurant was also quite good."
Best Vegetarian friendly Thai in Singapore!,"Loved Sabai! The location, food, service everything was perfect! They have an extensive menu for Vegetarians with some great Tofu dishes. Cant wait for my next trip to Singapore for a meal there"
Authentic Thai,This is my favourite Thai restaurant. The location is great. I usually like to sit outside to enjoy the view. Food are very tasty! service is good too. A must visit for me every time when I am in Singapore highly recommended
Best Thai in Singapore,"Fine Thai is keeping the promise in its name. Delicious food, welcoming host and professional service. The few is great with Marina Bay opposite. Outside dining possible and very cozy and relaxing."
Great for vegans,"They have an extensive menu for vegetarians with the most delicious pomelo salad, corn cakes and mango sticky rice. Lovely location with an amazing view when you step out. Service is attentive too."
Good Authentic Thai,We booked a table on recommendation of our Hotel (Fullerton Bay ) and although they said they could only seat us outside or upstairs when we got there we had a table downstairs by the window which was very acceptable The staff were very attentive and helpful - when my husband ordered Jungle Curry the waiter explained that this was very spicy and might be too hot for European taste so we opted for the Panang red curry and Chicken & Mushroom with Oyster sauce with a prawn fried rice All very tasty. Yes you can eat Thai cheaper in many places in Singapore but this is a prime spot on the waterfront and a short walk from our hotel so we thought it was ideal for us and the light show still taking place when we finished was good too.
Weekend visit,"Went without reservation. Usually quite busy. Got a table outside. The service staff is quite courteous. Ordered prawn green curry, Kai lan, pomelo salad and rice. The food was served quickly. The food was good and the quantity was appropriate.

The pricing was slightly expensive, duly so, as it's right at the marina Bay Area having the best views. Had an enjoyable evening.

Didn't know it was a smoking zone. Had a bit of difficulty as people were smoking around us and we were passive inhalers."
Excellent vegetarian food,"We ate dinner here. The location is lovely, by the bay. They served us awesome vegetarian food. The service was great. Very personal. The pineapple rice and olive rice stood out. Although every thing that we ordered was delectable. Must go!"
"good food, average ambience, lacking service","The food was solid (not amazing) and the service was inconsistent as we had to ask many times for some things. We sat on the upper-floor which was quite ugly, but the lower floor seemed to be nicer. I would not recommend this restaurant as overall the experience was average."
An excellent Thai experience,"The food, service and location we all fantastic. Sabai has great starters and the main coarse are excellent also. After a long day of sight seeing this hit the spot perfectly."
Thai on the Bay,"The atmosphere was busy and classy. Thai food here is really good, on authenticity, I am not sure about but it was pretty impressive on taste. We have spring rolls to nibble on and the Thai noodle salad as starters, for mains the fried battered garoupa , kailan and Thai Green Curry Chicken served with white rice. The kitchen worked really fast, and being really hungry as we were that night, we were served pretty efficiently. The food tasted fresh and the portions were generous. I had a glass of crispy white wine from New Zealand which was a perfect combination with the spiciness of the thai herbs and spice I thought."
Authentic Fine Thai Cuisine,"Excellent food presentation and I enjoyed every single taste of the food. Five stars for the Chef and I must say the food is wonderful. Corn cakes was excellent and curry prepared I must say is authentic and different from all the other Thai restaurant that I visited. Their rice cracker called Khao Ta na tang is an excellent starter.
Service staff very friendly"
Passable Food & No Real Ambiance,"After reading some great reviews on Sabai Thai, we decided to head out there for a celebratory lunch. The first thing that hit us was the noise - it's in the CBD so huge lunch crowds are to be expected, but it was far too noisy for a fine dining establishment.

The good thing was that they have an exhaustive vegetarian menu and the service is top notch too. The food, however, was disappointing. We had the Pomelo Salad, Red Curry, Cashew Tofu, and Pineapple Rice, plus a Lemongrass Mocktail and Thai Iced Milk Tea. The unique spicy Thai flavours you'd expect were completely missing and the food was fairly flat. Wouldn't go back unless there's a huge lift in the food and the ambiance."
Excellent food and great service,Went there to celebrate my sons birthday and thoroughly enjoyed the food. The service was above average and the ambience was good. Highly recommended for good quality and genuine Thai food.
Excellent food & hospitable service by Joe See,"Visited Sabai Fine Thai on the Bay to celebrate friend's birthday. Joe See has very good product knowledge and knows what to recommend to customers. He was also very patient and attentive. When one of us spilled the soup over the table, he attended to us immediately and addressed the problem straight away by helping us to clean the mess up. Excellent service and the food was a bonus!"
Excellent Thai - best in Singapore so far,So far the best Thai food in Singapore since moving here 6 weeks ago. And my wife is Thai so it should mean something...... :-). Prices for food are reasonable for this quality but wines is obviously on Singapore level :-(.
"Lovely, Hot & Spicy","Great location, very attentive staff and excellent food. Easy walk from our hotel at the Ritz Carlton & well worth the visit. Thai a bit hotter than we are used to in the UK but rose to the challenge (they will happily adjust heat to your taste). Would come back next time in Singapore."
Authentic Thai food,After tasting the first plate I was back in Bangkok very impressive I recommend this place even at 9.00 pm they have accepted us for dinner very unusual in Singapore nice place nice people and the price attractive
Authentic flavours,Had a great meal here with some very flavoursome food. Authentic Thai food. The service was also great.
Thai dinner In Singapore,We Chanced Upon this Restaurant While In Singapore 2 weeks ago. The Food was Amazing although a Bit On the Expensive side being vegetarians and No Alcohol but Was Definitely Worth It.
The coconuts!,"We had eaten at Sabai Fine Thai recently. The food was to die for especially the fresh coconut water and the cream - took us right back to Thailand. The food was very authentic flavores and portions being very decently sized. overall, the food was a little expensive, but it was justified to for the authentic taste and the big party that we were (total 10 of us). Also, the restaurant had ample vegetarian options. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to eat authentic thai food in Singapore."
Best Thai food in Singapore,"Had dinner here with my family last week and I must say that this is the best Thai food I've had in Singapore. Fresh ingredients and wonderful seasoning. Tom Yum Goong here was the clear but lethal kind, exactly the way I like it (without the heavy taste of nam prik pow). Seriously everything was so delicious. Don't let the waiter deceive you into thinking you've under-ordered- Thai food is meant to be eaten with lots of (free flow) rice, so you only need a few dishes to share. Also be sure to specify exactly how spicy you want your food or you could be crying through a few of the dishes like I did. This place seemed to cater mainly to foreigners (read: quite pricey), fresh coconuts cost $10++ each but the one I had was really sweet and tasty. Service was pretty good. Not much of a view from inside the restaurant, but hopefully the weather is cool and you can have a lovely after-dinner walk around the area."
"Great food, good ambience","Plus: great food, best than cuisine, good location & ambience Minus: slightly cramped, small portions Overall: Happy"
excellent food and excellent service,"i have been to this restaurant a few times over a number of years. Rare to find they serve authentic thai food that hasn't been ""toned' down for the locals.

service and food match. staff are very professional and do everything to cater to specific needs.

cocktails and beers are of a very high standard.

ambiance is understated and very welcoming. Anyone looking for good quality food - this place delivers with service and ambiance to match"
Excellent Thai in the Heart of Singapore,"As good or better than any high end restaurant in Bangkok. The green papaya salad and the pomelo salad with shrimp were perfect starters. Green Curry, Grilled meats (beef and chicken, Pla Neung Manao, Som Tum, Yam Som Oo excellent and authentic. To finish it off mango and sticky rice and sliced durian. Singha Drafts and glasses of an excellent chard. A must in Singapore but it is small so reservations are essential"
Hidden gem,"This restaurant is located in the customs house.Location is amazing.
Seating available both indoors and outdoors.
Please make a reservation before you go.
Place is crowded.
Food is amazing.Service is a tad slow.
Good vegetarian options.
Try the pomelo salad.
Restaurant is worth a vist.
Would cost SGD 150 for 3."
Awesome Vegetarian menu,I love this restaurant. Especially their vegetarian mushroom soup. Apart from that they have a big range of other vegetarian dishes. I actually visit this restaurant every opportunity I get. Love the food. The location and the ambience. Excellent food. Highly recommend.
A Hidden Gem,My fiancé and I were looking for a place to eat along the bay and stumbled upon this restaurant on Collier Quay. The manager took care of us personally and was extremely friendly as were all the staff. The food was just so delicious. Obviously fresh and we were checked on by the staff to make sure we were happy with the flavours and the spice which we were! It is a shame that we are not local to Singapore otherwise this would easily become one of our places to go. Thank you

Thai to die for,"@TheKuoKnows

Sabai Thai has done itself proud. It has turned humble Thai street food into exquisite Thai fine dining, without losing too much of the definition, which is not easy.

Thai food is characterised by its strong kick of spices and herbs. Sabai has managed to round off some of the harshness but still retain the authenticity.

There is enough flavour in the individual dishes without overpowering the dinner. Some might say it is too bland. I think it is just right.

The set menu is not cheap, though. At $31 for a two-course lunch, it is almost as expensive as a meal that would feed four in some cheaper Thai cafes in Singapore.

But all is forgiven after a mouthful of the Mango Salad. It is delicious. So too is the Mince Beef with Basil. Two courses with a generous heping of rice is more than enough to sate an afternoon craving for a touch of Thailand.

The view from Customs House is pretty spectacular too. It is little wonder the restaurant is packed to the rafters at noon. So booking is advisable."
