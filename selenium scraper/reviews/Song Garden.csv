CNY Gathering,Truly enjoyed the dinner & Service at Song Garden. The food selection was delicious! Thumbs up to the GM & team !
CNY Lunch,Great food! Service was good and the ambience at the location is good for large intimate gatherings. Will be returning!
Good quality food,"Ask for their recommendations when you come here. They recommended the steamed fish, which was superb. All the other dishes they recommended were very good too. The staff were friendly and helpful as well."
Delicious,"If you don't mind abit overpriced, it's worth it. I got the 5 course set meal and it's not too filling and not too little (I don't eat alot)"
Dinner,My favourite restaurant by far. Never fail in terms of food and their excellent services especially from May who is always attentive to the customers.
Good food Song Garden Chinese Restaurant,"We came for lunch. Good food and nice ambience. For the month of December, there is promo for the steamed marble goby fish. Recommended."
My daughter enjoyed the service from the staff,Nice food nice ambiance. Always a great experience here. Will come back and recommend to my good friend. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
Dinner,"Services and foods are good. Always attentive to their customers, from recommending menus, refilling our tea, and sauces. Pork ribs are yummy."
Birthday,Wonderful food and great service. Shanvon was great ! Overall spacious for function. Place is clean and waiter polite and on the ball. The menu can be customized to requirements.
Best In The Town üëçüèª,"Conducive environment with relaxing background music. Staff‚Äôs service is top notch! They always ensure that your tea cup is full and give good recommendations as they are well versed with the menu.

The soup is served hot and was flavourful. Lastly, the iconic dish is none other than the Charcoal Tofu with Scallop.

Worth for a visit and highly recommended"
Underrated Chinese Restaurant,Serves good Chinese food at a very decent price. Food is tasty but not salty. Will definitely come back here again
Excellent,"Fourth visit, the pan fried cod fillet with black truffle sauce was good, at SGD28 each, price a bit high, but with such good quality still worth it.
Probably here they are good at preparing fish dishes.
The stir fried mashed fish noodle with lobster in signature chilli sauce was good too, much better than what I had on my third visit, this time the noodle was especially good, next time can request to cook with other ingredients ?
The stir fried ""Mee pok"" with seafood and lard in signature chilli sauce was also good.

My third visit was in March 2022, not sure why it took me so long to return, probably due to not so good dish of lobster noodle during that visit.
Ambience okay and normal customer service.
Rather unexpected to get a 5-star dining experience here."
Pleasant Lunch,"We had an enjoyable time during lunch. The Dimsum is still good, just as we had expected from our previous visits. Would like to thank Yuki & Team for the warm service despite the lean resources."
Opulent Cantonese Cuisine,"Song Garden had always been on my wishlist since I had lunch at this place three years ago. It was with family though, so I totally had no impression of what I had eaten, except that I like the food here. So I'm finally back again to slowly savour the food and write this post about this restaurant.

Treasure Platter (Chilled) of Foie Gras, Abalone and Sake Infused Crabmeat Salad is a good showcase of what this restaurant has to offer: Classic Opulent Cantonese Food with a Twist. Sake infused Crabmeat coupled with thinly shredded pickles cucumber is very refreshing on the palates. The umami of crab and flying fish roe go very well with the tangy flavour of the cucumber. A good starter. Chilled Foie Gras is very buttery and the jelly that comes with it introduces a burst of refreshing juice that harmonises perfectly with the richness of the foie gras. The abalone is very flavourful and the texture is just right: not too chewy but firm.

My favourite got to be the Deep-fried Homemade Charcoal Tofu with Crab Meat and Hokkaido Scallop. I love this so much. So traditional yet so unique. Every bite of the soft fresh tofu is filled with awesomely sweet umami of fresh crab. Even the veggie is also soaked with the goodness of the crab. The slightly crispy exterior of the tofu gives a nice variation to the texture. The fresh, well-seared Hokkaido Scallop is plump and meaty, going well with the tofu.

Lots of dim sum items on the menu are the old-school types, and I decide to try one of the staples of dim sum repertoire: Deep-fried Prawn Dumpling with Mayonnaise. Crispy deep-fried thin dough skin wrapping around super fresh juicy, bouncy prawns get the thumbs-up from me. Now I look forward to trying the rest of their dim sum items.

Pan-fried Pork & Foie Gras Dumping is one of the more innovative dim sum items on the menu. This is like gyoza filled with meat and soup √† la Xiao Long Bao. So juicy, so good. And the hint of foie gras inside gives the dumplings an extra buttery richness.

Chilled Black Glutinous Rice with Ice Cream Served in Young Coconut is pretty good. The coconut ice-cream is so creamy, so good that I do wish more ice-cream is added. A little dollop of ice-cream is so easily over-whelmed by the sea of black glutinous rice soup. Yes, I said ""soup"" because texture wise, the black glutinous rice part is a bit like starchy shark fin soup. Some people may like the smooth texture of black glutinous rice prepared this way, but I prefer to enjoy the wholesomeness of rice grains by chewing on them. By the way, I also dig up the young coconut flesh from the shell to enjoy. It is yummy.

The place is very posh and full of traditional Chinese influences, yet inviting and comfy at the same time. The red plush chairs make for very striking impression. I love the semi-circle red plush sofa seats at the side, it makes one feels like one is in a private space of his/her own. The service is professional and efficient. And the tall lady staff is very friendly and helpful in recommending the dishes without hard-selling. This is a very nice restaurant to enjoy traditional Cantonese food, with some twists at times."
Compliment,Roasted duck and pork is a must to order! Warm staff and great ambience to dine in! Will definitely return üòÅ

Review,Good food good ambience. Waitress are attentive and they can give good recommendations. Overall experience is good.
Good food! Really enjoy the food!,It‚Äôs really our first time here and very pleasant surprise by the food quality and variety! Will return!
Enjoyable Meal,Went for the Dim Sum on Sunday 4 Sep and was crowded. Last visited weeks back and the food and service were just as good. It seems the service staff were shorthanded but could see that they did what they could to accommodate to their best ability. Appreciate the service rendered by Shanvon & Joey : )
Better Cantonese restaurants out there,Very over priced and service very poor . Best to stick with other high end restaurants such as imperial or even crystal jade .
Underwhelming,"Given the ratings (and the prices) I was expecting a bit of ""wow"" - there was none of that. The food was definitely ok, but given what they charge I would have expected quite a bit more in presentation and quality."
While going,It was a good experience here. Nice Restaurant food was Very Tasty specially soup & Shrimps and Scallion. As per price this restaurant expensive. Overall good experience
Yum cha at its best,"Deluxe environment, met with great service. Food was top notch and accompanied with great service and a peaceful environment, you can‚Äôt get better yum cha than this. For larger parties, there are private rooms. If you are a larger party, please go to those rooms."
Song Garden Dinner,Will definitely come again to dine in with my family. Kudos to yuki as she is warm and professional making her way out in making our dinning experience very enjoyable.
Song Garden @ Mecure Hotel,"Restaurant's ambience was great, suitable for big gatherings with family and friends. Food was delicious and they offered a wide variety of dimsum that had a creative twist to the traditional dimsum. Service was very good too. Highly recommend!"

Friendly staff good food,Very happy with the food and service rendered. Staff were very professional and had good EQ. Thanks so much!
Song Garden Dim Sum,The Dim Sum here are absolutely awesome. Way much better than Carlton hotel which I have went last week. Services and environment have so much different even though Carlton is a 5 star hotel. Services staff are so friendly and dim sum price are reasonable. This Dim Sum to me is more than 5 stars rating. Will bring my family here again
Eastern European Wine Pairing Dinner on 1 June 2022,"It was an incredible experience at the Chinese dinner at Song Garden. The selection of wines from Moldova and Romania were good choices to pair with the appetising dishes.

My recommendation is the Purcari- Negru de Purcari 2019, red wine from Moldova rich and intense flavour, paired very well with Pan-Seared Angus Beef Fillet"
Sumptuous Lunch,"Recommended dishes - Shanghai Dumplings (Siew Long Bao, Â∞èÁ¨ºÂåÖ), Pork Dumpling with Mini Abalone (Siew Mai, ÁÉßÂçñ) and Prawn Dumplings (Har Gau, ËôæÈ•∫). Thin skin, each dumpling are filled with wholesome ingredients. Nice ambient, good place for social gathering."
Friends gathering,"Had a lovely evening with yummy food with my friends at this highly recommended restaurant. Been here few times already and every time, the standard of service and food never fail me.
Great place to hang out with family and friends over lunch or dinner as the restaurant is so cozy. Will definitely go back again."
Family get together after after a long hiatus,Food was good. Especially enjoyed the fried crispy fish skin in salted egg yolk and the clay pot rice. Staff was polite
Siblings Gathering,Get together dinner with all siblings after 2 years because of COVID. The food served at Song Garden were very nice and yummy. Each dish was individually served. The staff was very polite & service was very good.
Service level needs improvement,"Âë≥ÈÅìÁéØÂ¢ÉÈÉΩ‰∏çÈîôÔºå‰ΩÜÊúçÂä°ÊúâÁÇπÂ∑Æ„ÄÇ‰ª∑Ê†º‰∏≠È´òÔºå‰∫∫Âùá80Êñ∞Â∏ÅÔºà400‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂ∏ÅÔºâÂèØÂÖçÂÅúËΩ¶Ë¥π„ÄÇ
Overall taste is good, good restaurant ambience but service level needs improvement. Above average pricing with free parking. Average S$80 / head (400RMB)."
Birthday celebration for mother-in-law,"4 of us ordered set lunch $43++ each and top up with dim sum (carrot cake in XO sauce etc). We are pleasantly surprised by the food quality, food portion and nice ambience. We also ordered a few longevity buns for my mother-in-law and my uncle. They are fragrantly infused with osmanthus. This is our 1st visit and I'll definitely be back again for the yummy food!"
Song Garden - Highly Recommended!,Food quality is great; Excellent service from William and Yuki: Price is reasonable! Definitely will be back again to try their dim sum.
Review of food,Food is nice and good quality. Service is also good. Will definitely come back the next time with family and friends.
Good dinner,"Third visit, the prawns mentaiko and noodles lobster were above average. Previous two occasions I was the only diner, this time glad to see another two tables occupied with guests."
timsum with family...,the best timsum....excellent food n service.my family members love it. No other choir only Song garden.
Highly recommended,Impressive service from Ms Yuki and team. Excellent food with nice presentation. Definitely worth trying
Family outing,"Food is good and nice. Service is excellent and staff are friendly. The robot, Yummi, is quite helpful in giving the food to us."
Generally very good standard Cantonese fare in a really lovely setting,"A surprising find in this place. It‚Äòs not on Chope, and it doesn‚Äôt advertise, so I never knew about it until a friend suggested. my first impression was the ambience - suitably oriental, quiet, spacious and inviting. Not many good chinese restaurants today exude such oriental ambience.

Very pleased with the pickled tomatoes (i generally do NOT like tomatoes, but these are amazing). Fairly pleased with the black pepper beef (a tad tough), wasabi cream prawns, crispy chicken. The CNY dish of abalone, giantic mushroom, black moss and cabbage was delightful too. I felt the roast pork was somewhat tough - i guess my expectations are getting higher as I age haha. What a shame they didn‚Äôt have almond cream for dessert but my alternative, the grass jelly was quite good.

Will try to return for dimsum and maybe try out their set menus and double boiled soups, if any."
Best cny meal at Song Garden Bugis,"This is the best curated cny meal ever. Good price, good location. Excellent culinary skills. A wonderful spread with prawns, fish, chicken, seafood, Nian Gao, delicacies etc"
excellent service at Song Garden,"We wish to compliment the excellent service, especially Ms Boey Yong for her care and attention. One of the dim sum around"
Birthday gathering,Visited this place on 08/01/22. William and Yuki were very attentive and the service from the staff was great. In addition the dim sum were unique and very good!
Excellent w great price point.,"Excellent food with awesome service. Friendly staff with great service and food recommendation from Shevron Tan too. Manager also remembered us our second time back.
Fish is soooooo good I haven‚Äôt heard my mum praise a dish before (she‚Äôs a great cook herself). Price point also much better than atas Chinese restaurants. Definitely recommended and gonna come back."

üëèüèªüëèüèªIMPECCABLE SERVICEüëèüèªüëèüèª,"Second time having dinner with friends at Song Garden. When the restriction of 2 to dine out was lifted, our group of 5 had to go back to Song Garden.
Service as usual was impeccable. The manager was able to assists us and guided us on what to order and of course with my little bit of requests here and there, even my ridiculous request, was met most willingly.
Serving the dishes came out in a slow and consistent manner and food was served piping hot, burnt my lips when biting into the prawn LOL!
Kudos to the chef and his team, food was of top standard even with our current worldwide situation.
Keep up the great work SONG GARDEN team, with strong leadership qualities and great direction, u guys will sustain.
Living proof, 2 years later after COVID surfaced, the restaurant is still standing.
Well done to all.
Till the next time we meet again.
Jia You!"
One of my best dim sum.,Food is good. Dim sum can be ordered by the pieces. Their service is definitely something u want to go for as well. William's service is excellent and he makes an effort to rem your food preference.
Great dining experience,Food and service was impeccable. Kudos to William for the great dining experience. Highly recommended for their dimsum
Visit to Song Garden,"The food was great! Also, thank you to manager William for such a warm and friendly service Definitely will return for the food and hospitality üòÄ"
Nice dinner with husband,"Nice experience dining at Song Garden. Food quality was on point, ambience was comfortable. Shanvon who attended to us was very attentive. She initiated for the serving to be on hold as my husband stepped away for a call and also to heat up the soup for my husband as it has become cold while he was away. Appreciate the level of attentiveness she has given.
Definitely recommend a visit for those looking for quality Cantonese cuisine and excellent service."
Revisit this restaurant for dinner. Food are ok but service man need to train more. Low EQ!,Service man welcome you by loudly asking you how much $$ per head count. Like kopitiam. Lucky not business guests. So bodoh.
Satisfying meal,"Chanced upon this restaurant and decided to try the dim sum. I loved the dimsum, especially their special prawn rice rolls! It was crispy and satisfying at the same time. Such a great combination, feels like youtiao rice roll and prawn rice roll combined together.

Serving portion was just right. Their hargao was as big as the spoon! Will definitely return again!"
Consistently good food and good service!,My family and I have been eating dimsum at Song Garden since they first opened and the food has never let us down. We also enjoy their century egg porridge and desserts like avocado cream and almond cream. The managers and servers are all very friendly and attentive as well.
Good food good prices,"Great food at amazing prices, MUST HAVE THEIR SOUP - highly recommend soups in the claypot super shiok"
Excellence service,"The service here is excellent, the staffs are very observant and serve readily, food is great too. Thank you for the delicious food and great service!"
Good service,"Excellent services provided by William,
From booking arrangement to menu selection... thumbs up!

Food are fresh and with high quality standard, serving timing is definitely one of the key point which william and team will always walk around to make sure you are well taken care of. What can I ask for? With every 5 minutes interval which I'm really impressed by team William."
Impeccable service and delicious food,We have been to Song Garden on numerous occasions over the years and have always enjoyed the most amazing dining experience. Went for lunch yesterday. The food choices are good with a lot of varieties. The quality of food is superb and every dish is astounding. We are especially impressed by Yuki who has always displayed her professional skills in recommending tasty dishes. Much appreciation to her. A wonderful Cantonese restaurant. Highly recommended!
Yummy Dim Sum!,"Heard many good reviews of this restaurant, finally get to try it today. Excellent food and ambience! Very attentive service crew! Will definitely be back again."
Excellent food and service,Delicious traditional cantonese food and the service is top notch! The lobster soup is really out of this world!
Amazing üëç,"Delicious food, excellent services. I just spoke to Yuki, she is really quite good. üëç You must try!!!"
Good food and service,"Second visit, ordered the business set menu, same as the first visit. Treasure platter (hot) and braised lobster with pumpkin puree were very good. On both occasions, was there on a weekday evening and I was the only customer, a bit concerned, hope that they can pull through this difficult period. Good service from the staff."
Dim sum super good,Food n service was great! We were so hungry that we did not take any pics . Only took a pic of otah Siew mai.
Fabulous lunch treat,Random internet search revealed a jewel of find. Excellent carefully prepared seasoned and presented dishes. The mentiko cod was so smooth and melt-in-your mouth.
Wonderful food and service,"Came on a weeknight to celebrate a special occasion. Fantastic food and service!
(We had the Boss‚Äôs signature fried rice, crispy chicken, saut√©ed prawn with dried chili and cashews and stir-fried asparagus & mushroom with truffle oil)
Just lovely! We will be back.
I know these are tough times.
Hang in there guys!"
Very good food,"Great food, excellent service :) covid has affected their business numbers but quality of food has not dropped"
Dimsum Lunch at Song Garden,"Had dinner here before and was recommended to try their dumsum. And it did not disappoint at all! Their dimsum is so fresh!

The plus point is, quantity of dimsum in a basket can be customised (means you don‚Äôt have to finish 3 when there‚Äôs only two of you).

Must try their Today‚Äôs special soup and it tasted so great! Would love to come back again for their dimsum!

Thank you Yuki and Joey for their prompt service and attention.

P/s: dinner menu is great too!"
Compliment,We were being served by Ms Yuki and she had displayed professional skills and made us feel very comfortable and welcomed! She is very attentive to our needs too!
Underrated exceptional restaurant!,"Great food, every dish was exceptional and exceeded expectations!

Service was 5 star and ambiance is on point. I came with my family, and the service staff was very aware of my kid's needs. They helped us order the food for the children and was sensitive to where to place the food on the table away from prying small hands!

Will 100% come back and recommend!"
Birthday dinner celebration,My husband bought me here for dinner to celebrate my birthday. The food here are very delicious. And I always look forward to their soups
Best place for dim sum and interesting mooncake flavours,"Song Garden is hands down still the best place to go for dim sum! I love their XO sauce and their Har Gao which is super generous in portion size. The baby abalone siew mai which is a relatively new item on the menu was an interesting twist on the classic siew mai.

Since it‚Äôs the Mid-Autumn Festival season, I had their mooncakes. The flavours of the classic baked mooncakes are great but I really loved the mini snowskin collection especially the Jackfruit with Earl Grey.

Cannot wait to go back."
Good Food & Service,"This is not the first time that we visited Song Garden and once again, the food and service never fail us. The Dimsum selections were good and the variety was quite extensive. The warmth yet not intimidating service by Yuki and Shanvon wrapped up the whole experience as pleasant and enjoyable."
Good food and service,Came here on a Saturday evening. Place was quiet perhaps due to covid19. This restaurant has been consistent in their standards on our every visit. Good food and service. Staff are attentive. Clean place with comfortable setting.
Song Garden visit,Good ambience and great service! Food quality is also good. Staff is friendly and made good recommendations.
Good quality food,"First visit, ordered the business set menu. The treasure platter (hot), braised lobster with pumpkin puree soup, steamed cod fillet and honey pork rice were all delicious. Will return."
One of the best gathering after lockdown,"ambience is super conducive, food is nice. Good place to dine in with your friend and loved ones. Will come back again"
Food and service is nice,"Had a birthday meal at here. Everything is nice, food is yum yum and staff are friendly. Worth to try"
Authentic Cantonese Cuisine,"Sweet Sour Pork with lychee is impressive, especially used molecular gastronomy to integrate the flavours and presentation. Fried lettuce with black garlic sounds simple but can taste wokhey in every bite!"
Dinner,Great food & experience with excellent service. This experience is just like a family coming together for dinner.
