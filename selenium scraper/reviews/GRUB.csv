Delicous burgers and dessert; friendly staff,"Staff at Grub puts a smile on our faces! Burgers are delicious, including the Katsu burger. The burnt kaya cheese cake is excellent!"
"Great service with excellent follow up by Hostess Extraordinaire, Amanda Phan.","Visited Grub at Bishan Park 3 times prior to Covid 19 with the family. Decided to give it a try now that they had moved to Stevens Rd. I am not a burger and fries person and has always been wary of fish dishes due to few experiences with either overcooked or fishy taste outcomes. I ordered their Miso Glazed Salmon Soba and was very happy that it was done perfectly especially the Salmon skin. Crispy, a little crunchy and yummylicious. The wafu dressing went extremely well with the salmon and soba. The Grilled Chicken Pesto was nice too.
The restaurant followed up with an email to check on our dining experiences and Amanda Phan followed up with a note to thank me and asked that I drop her a note on my next visit so she can come by to say hello personally if she is on duty. This is a step above many establishments that may check on customers' dining experiences and stopped short after feedback was given. This speaks volume of the management new concept of customer engagement and ways to improve with a personal touch."
Nice cheeseburgers,"We arrived before noon for our early lunch. There was already an occupied table at the outdoor terrace seating area. We opted for indoor dining and had the entire indoor space for ourselves. As our visit was on a weekday, the restaurant was quiet, with only 2 additional occupied tables by the time we finished our lunch. Peaceful surrounding was pleasant. In comparison, Grub's previous outlet at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park was often crowded and noisy.

We ordered cheeseburgers which were served with 140g beef patties and generous portions of thick-cut potato chips. Beef patties were grilled to our preferences of doneness. Vinegar and mustard were available on request whereas sachets of chilli and tomato sauce were provided in a basket placed on each table. The meal was satisfying."
Worth the visit,"I rarely give 5 stars out of 5 stars. I am impressed by the food but more impressed by their service. In the mist of their peak period, they serve with a smile and very attentive. E.g i dropped a knife and I pick it up put on the table. One staff took the dirtied knife and another staff immediately replaced it. The yuzu mint taste weird but but the lychee earl grey is perfect match."
Review for GRUB,"My family like to dine at GRUB, for the ambience and food . We are sad that they will be leaving Bishan in January, and hope they will start somewhere again for the great food . Will miss the restaurant if it's to be closed."
Great time at Grub,"Food quality just as good as usual .
Except kitchen staff was in flexible to accommodate the change from garlic bread to just plain bread that came with the soup. As I am unable to eat raw garlic due to allergy. Other than that overall was good"
Disappointing dining experience,"The Har Cheong Chicken Waffle, Fish & Chips, Truffle Mushroom Soba and Grilled Chicken Pesto Pasta tasted like they had been pre-prepared to be reheated before being served.

The Har Cheong Chicken were overcooked while the fries and the waffle were not crispy.

The Truffle Mushroom Soba had a weired taste and the Grilled Chicken Pesto Pasta too oily.

The whole experience was a little hasty. The intention was to chill out over “dinner in a park”. Granted, we were late due to rain and unfavourable traffic condition. The table was kept for us although we were quick to be reminded they needed the table back by a certain time, which was less than an hour.

The area where we were seated was not appealing. Outside and beside where we were seated, there were prams, strollers etc. Understood that it is a kids friendly bistro, surely there is a way to do better.

It’s overhyped. It’s pricey. Hence, I expect a little more.

Forget about chilling and dining in a park given the time restrictions. I would think just drop by for a cuppa and small bites.

Won’t be back. Not even a cuppa.

Just my personal opinion."
Burnt cheesecake cravings!,"Burnt cheesecake, burger, and pasta are a must try! Highly recommended al fresco dining in Singapore! The place is very convenient too!"
Good food,Friendly and helpful service staff. The food was good portion and delicious. Slightly expensive but will visit again.
Sinful Mala Burger,"After a Saturday afternoon spent kayaking, we were spent and hungry. So we searched for good food options nearby and remembered about Grub. I had always wanted to visit it, so without any further delay, we made way to it. And reached just on time before it started pouring.

We got seated in the outdoor corner area, our preference for inhaling some fresh air inside ours .

Being the hungry lot, we soon ordered the following:
1. Mushroom Cheese Potato Croquettes: I loved the soffrito, better than the main dish .
2. Garlic Bruschetta: It was simple and plain as it should be.
3. Mala Xiang Guo Burger (Pork): Wow, I just loved it. The juiciness of the pork patty with mala flavor was delectable. However, I would suggest trying and reduce the oil content.
4. Mushroom Cheese & Rocket: It was plain and creamy at the same time, I could keep devouring if not for the calories.
5. Strawberry Yakult Soju: A good combo, the strawberry essence was of the right amount, allowing the other flavors to be distinct at the same time.

We finally finished with their signature Burque Burnt Cheesecake, which I felt was just ok (Have tasted better).

Overall we had a good filling brunch and ended up spending quite some time due to the heavy downpour."
Lunch by the Bishan Garden,"Awesome and blissful environment. Food experience is on average note; probably both of us are Chefs background. Cheese cake scored the top marks, unfortunately we didn't take photo. Definitely will visit again to try some of their winning dishes. Service was excellent and friendly."
Nice setting,"First time here for lunch with colleague. Ordered Har Cheong Kai burger, and crispy fish burger. Food was good but not wow. Enjoyed the rose gold latte. The Strawberry Yakult Soju was delicious but expensive at $10. Burnt cheesecake was $9 - also expensive, and I wouldn't say that great. What were important - we sat indoors, nice ambience, great greenery being situated in Bishan-AMK park, and most of all - AMANDA our server - she was cheery and welcoming, and if I own a F&B business, I would hire her! We spent $83 for 2 people - a tad much for lunch, but great for that important catch up. Definitely recommended!"
"Bishan Park,Grub","Service staff was attentive Quality of food is so-so Price is acceptable It was less crowded because we came at 5pm,Sat"
New and improved meat free dishes,"They removed 3 previous meat free dishes and replaced them with 3 more, this time with mushrooma- a soba, pasta and burger (burger is not vegan as the bun has french butter). We tried the pasta and soba. Oasta was tasty with a generous amount of mushrooms but it was not at all spicy even though it was promoted as such.The soba was well marinated and with a good range of accompanying ingredients except that it could do with more mushrooms. Overall, we found these new dishes better than the meat free ones they replaced, so well done!"
A weekend brunch.,Came for a weekend brunch. Arrive early and was able to get seats without reservation. In the middle of the Bishan park which is surrounded by lush greenery. Good place to have a relaxing weekend away from all the buzz. Place can get crowded during lunch. The service is good and the food were serve quite fast after ordering. Not particularly impressive but the food is tasty enough for me. After brunch can also enjoy a short stroll in the park. Will come back again if I am nearby.
An ideal place to chillax with the fam bam,"This place is a delight to head to with the family as it's cosy and its extensive menu caters for all the various tastebuds. I've tried alot on the menu so far and nothing has fallen short of my expectations. The price-point is, in my opinion, value for money and is almost always full during peak dining hours. Despite that, the wait staff are all very professional, polite, smiley and i really appreciate that. I was served by a nice girl whose name starts with a ""C"" (sorry I can't remember your name :( ) and she was super genuine and sweet to my kid and my parents the whole time. Thank you :)"
Great brunch venue,Great and friendly service and yummy food! Just that things gets a little slower as crowd builds up and drinks take a little longer than expected to be served. Overall still a great venue to chill and catch up with delicious food.
Relaxing cafe in a park,"This is a nice and quiet cafe within the garden setting of Bishan-AMK Park. To avoid the weekend crowds, we visited it during tea time on a weekday for a light meal and coffee/tea. With the surrounding landscaped greenery and the convenience of a nearby car park, Grub is a very relaxing venue to spend some time in.

My wife and I shared our orders of deep-fried chicken midwings, Mentaiko potato chips with Japanese mayo sauce and topped with nori seaweed, their signature Basque Burnt Cheesecake, coffee and tea. Although there is an air-conditioned dining area, we sat at the outdoor dining area.

As it rained outside, it was relaxing to enjoy our hot meal while listening to the rain pelting on the greenery.

Service was friendly and our orders were served promptly. An enjoyable afternoon well spent."
Nice place to chill,"Waffle chicken is yummy! First time visit leaves good impression. Environment n food, all good. Will come again!"
Gastronomic Grub!,"Nestled in the greenery of Bishan Park is this bistro that serves eclectic fusion nosh.
Smoked duck soba was light & healthy. Loved the crispy yet tender pan fried halibut with quinoa & mash. Calamari with salt & pepper is another winner.

Drink up the interesting concoctions - lychee ice tea & yuzu mint cooler were refreshing on a balmy day. Top it all up with coffee & burnt cheesecake which was a tad too sweet. All in, great food amidst a pretty setting!"
Nice food in rustic ambiance,"Went here for lunch last weekend whilst taking a nature walk in Bishan Ang Mo Kio Park. It’s midway through the park and is an ideal place to pause if your walking the whole park or following the circuit map.

The restaurant was full but the host said it could take 40 minutes to be seated. Took my mobile number and he called after about 20 minutes confirming my food was ready.

The truffle egg starter was excellent as was the spaghetti carbonara for mains. Plenty of room due to social distancing. Service was prompt and efficient. Nice rustic countryside feel to the restaurant which blends well with the park. A very nice place to stop for lunch - reasonably priced."
Lovely meal,"Many interesting dishes here such as satay chicken burger, mala meat burger... Ordered Soba salad, pasta bacon carbonara and waffle with prawn paste chicken. All were nice especially the waffle with chicken. Having dinner outdoor after a rainy evening in the park is so enjoyable."
Yummy!,"value for money. we ordered calamari, burgers, truffle fries and churros and waffle with vanilla ice cream. everything we ordered was tasty. will definitely coming back and recommend to my friends and family. 😉"
Good food,"We came on a Saturday for brunch and it was crowded. Had to wait an hour for our table. Ordered the burger, brunch plate and burnt cheesecake. All good! Drinks (iced coffee and yuzu) ok. Nice ambience and friendly staff. Area for improvement, - introduce vegan items on your menu please, cos there are none."
"Outstanding Service, Delicious Food","GRUB is a bistro located in Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, with air-conditioned indoor seats and al-fresco outdoor seats. Serves meat and fish from sustainable sources. Vegetarian options include mushroom cheese potato croquette, cauliflower and mushroom fritter, duo of dips with garlic bread, garlic bruschetta with tomatoes and olives, portobello burger, as well as mushroom, cheese, and rocket pasta. Kitchen staff can accommodate special requests to modify menu items such as removing meat products, as well as customise plant-based dishes if given a week's notice.

The service was outstanding - the staff patiently answered my queries on social media and attended to my requests, made friendly conversation with us, and offered insect repellent spray. Even more impressive than the service was the delicious food. I had the Truffle Mushroom Baked Eggs ($12) but removed the bacon bits and switched the garlic toast to a side salad for a vegetarian keto meal which was savoury and satisfying. My friend had the Har Cheong Fried Chicken Waffles with Sambal Mayo and Maple Syrup ($16) which he found unique and tasty. We also tried the Basque Burnt Cheesecake ($9) and Kaya Burnt Cheesecake ($9), which were recently ranked as number 1 in a blind taste test by The Straits Times. Indeed, the burnt cheesecakes were an amazing dessert. The burnt layer was firm and had a caramelised scorched taste, while the inner layer was creamy and rich. Overall, I had an amazing time enjoying a nice meal in a nature setting, and I was certainly not the only happy customer as it was full-house even during weekdays (do make a reservation online if you intend to make a visit!)."
Dining in the park,"Offer large varieties of food, a relaxing environment as it’s located in bishan park, however they limit diners to complete within certain time during busy hours. kaya burnt cheesecake is really good but price is steep."
Disappointing,"This place had quite a few good reviews. However, unfortunately found the mushroom burger just average, perhaps a bit below average. Patty was overdone and dry on the outside. And my matcha latte had this kryptonite green, which looked totally artificial, rather than the pale green standard. Customer service was okay."
Enjoy dining back at Grub,Great enjoyable dining experience. Always love their Cheese burger and 10 times better savouring it then via delivery.
Quality food but outdoor seating was not a good choice,"It was a Saturday nite dinner. The food and services were good. One main setback is the environment of outdoor seating. A lot of mosquitoes, my girl got badly stung (although restaurant provides insect repellent spray). Her feet was full of bites and swollen, went to doc and was given antibiotics and other meds. Shall not revisit."
Good customer service,"I booked 2 tables for 6-7 pax on sat morning for dinner at 8pm. The response was fast, confirmation from the email was amost instance. About 2 hrs before the dinner. A staff from the restuarant called again to confirm the final nos of ppl attending. The caller was very polite and professional. When we arrived at the place crowded with ppl. We saw only 2 tables was empty. Wondering really is for us. Soon the staff received us with a warmth welcome. I wanted to compliment the whole team for efforts & their excellent customer service."
"Great Ambience, Yummy Food, Awesome Hospitality",Always enjoy the yummy foods prepared and awesome service rendered by the staff @ GRUB (Bishan). Perfect ambience for a quaint little setup amidst the picturesque park setting!
Good food but service lacking,"We were there on a busy Friday evening. The bespectacled server seemed impatient and stony faced when taking orders and having to wipe up water that was spilled inadvertently by someone at the table. The food took a long time to come, about thirty minutes. But the pesto chicken pasta and burgers were all good value and tasty. Put plenty of insect repellent or dress appropriately when dining in the evening! Nice live singing band present too."
Great Food in a Hideaway,"Went to Grub for a quick bite with my family. Great place, good location, fantastic service. Will definitely come back again!"
"Nice food, wonderfu place","It's inside Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, evironment is nice. The burger was so nice and I like the salad also. Suggest you sit indoor table"
Children friendly cafe,"Children friendly cafe with high chairs, toilet with child height sinks. Food is served fresh and warm."
Nice place for dining,Nice ambiance. Outdoor is full of greenery. A great place for dining. Variety of foods. Great place for gathering.
Great Food Great Service Perfect Ambiance,"Its was a busy Friday evening and yet the service was fantastic, the food was really good and the live music just made the experience perfect."
Dining in the Park,Will definitely visit again when i'm in the park! Reasonable price with great ambience! Crew was helpful when it comes to what to order.
Great staff and innovative food,my family and i totally loved it! fantastic stuff and staff! we went for the conventional food choices but we will return for the more exciting ones
Mildly Disappointed,"The staff were friendly, the food came quickly. The kitchen was able to make requested changes to a dish to suit my daughter. The place was simple and brightly lit.
It was my wife's birthday, The food came in generous portions but the taste was mediocre and left me wanting something better. I had a burger, The beer was nice though."
Good place to hang out at with friends,Good place to hang out at with friends. Laidback setting with friendly service. Average to decent quality food and a little pricey though.
Great place for a gathering of friends,"The restaurant situated in Bishan Park had a great ambience, whether seated inside or outside. Service by the staff was good and the food was of decent quality too. Will recommend the Har Cheong Kai Chicken with Waffle and the Mala Xiangguo Burger."
Nice food! And remember insect repellant,"Went on a Thursday rainy evening and it wasn’t crowded. Sakura Ebi pasta and the salmon steak was nice. So was their dark chocolate cake with gelato. Ambience was nice and quiet. It was good that the restaurant has a note on their table offering insect repellant! We only noticed it much later after feeling itch on our legs. If you’re there, remember to put on insect repellant before going!"
RUDE & NOT PET FRIENDLY,"Visited on a Sunday afternoon

At first they said (over phone enquiry) that the the alfresco did not allow pets, BUT, they could give us a seat at the corner so my dog wont bother anyone. But when i reached, my frens (not pet owners) arrived 1st, already seated. Even with my small dog in a bag, they insisted that dog have to be outside the seating area. I had no choice but put my dog at the concrete area outside the seats.

10mins After i ordered, they changed their mind and said my dog CANNOT even be on the concrete pavement! They insisted that dog has to be on the grass.

Pet unfriendliness aside, the food was terrible.
The Burger patty was bland. And dont even get me started on the ""Earl grey Lemon tea"". Brown lemon water, thats all, not sweet, no earl grey taste."
Great spot and great burgers,Deffo try this spot if in the area or via delivery apps. Standard cheeseburger is excellent as are the appetizers. 100% recommend Grub burgers to anyone!!!
"Good food, good location!",Enjoyed the food a lot. Outdoor seating is a bit prone to mosquitoes but they offered repellent. Pretty interesting location in the middle of the park!
Fantastic Food and Service,"1st time here and I must say I am impressed by the food and the service. Grilled Chicken Salad was wonderful, Burgers were fantastic. Mentaiko Fries are soooo good.. Reasonable pricing with excellent food I must say. Keep it up cos I am coming back again!"
Great foods with nice ambience,Nice ambiance cafe with great foods. Especially for my keto diet meal. Definitely will go back to this cafe again.
It Could Have Been A 5!,"Grub is known for its quality burgers & chill Vibes. We went there in the evening, staff were friendly & thoughtful.

We ordered a double cheeseburger, truffle floss fries, pan seared salmon salad, Churros & Earl grey tea.

I would recommend ordering a single cheeseburger as I was overwhelmed by the patty. The burger was pretty okay, but for that price I've had better. The truffle floss fries was good initially but we struggled to finish it after a few bites.

Pan seared salmon salad was average (salmon fillet & greens portion is small) which I wouldn't recommend if you're famished & that is not their specialty either.

Churros were nice & crisp, the white chocolate infused with yuzu sauce was to die for! It has a perfect balance of sweetness & citrus. The dark chocolate sauce tasted of quality, but I would have preferred it to be served melted & hot. Instead it was served cold with a split hardened layer above (best description of its' consistency; when you leave chocolate sauce in the refrigerator without covering it)

Although there were some hits & misses with the food we ordered, overall it was decent. The best part of Grub is the staff, who were amazing & the atmosphere especially in the evening.

The rating could have been above average, although food was average but due to their management of reservations which was utterly disappointing.

Reservations made at this place wasn't taken seriously. I made reservations in the day for 2pax at 8.15pm and arrived at 8pm only to be told that our reservation is at 8.15pm and that it was full house plus there isn't any seats available.

It creates an impression that Grub doesn't take reservations seriously and that reservations made at this place is obselete. This is the most elementary thing that eateries don't get it wrong especially being in business for years. The poor management of the reservation was discouraging.

I hope that they take this constructive feedback with respect & improve on their food & management (Reservations)."
"Great Ambience, Good Food","I had ordered food from Grub several times via delivery apps and had always loved the Grub Cheeseburger. This time, I decided to get Chope vouchers and dine at the restaurant itself. Weekday evening (before 7pm so there would still be some daylight) would be the perfect time to have dinner at Grub so we could enjoy the nature scenery of Bishan park.

We started off with Mentaiko Fries and Mushroom Cheese Potato Croquette to share. The crispy fries were topped with a piquant mentaiko sauce that wasn't too salty. We totally enjoyed the croquettes too that tasted earthy at first bite and then followed by a nice cheesy note.

For mains, we ordered the Mentaiko Katsu Burger and Grub Double Cheeseburger. The katsu patty was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Good on its own but not as a burger in my opinion. And of course, the cheeseburger didn't disappoint as always. The beef patty was moist and juicy with a nice pink centre. The homemade burger buns were soft and pillowy. Overall, everything was just satisfying and comforting.

We ended our meal with churros that came with dark chocolate and yuzu white chocolate dips. Not the best churros I had but weren't that bad either.

All in all, Grub is still my to-go place for burgers. Good portion sizes. Value for money. Highly recommended to all."
Nice food but not dog friendly,"If you're planning a nice evening in the park with your family and dog, forget the dog. They don't want to see dogs at less than 50 meters from the joint.
Despite seating away from other customers and with the dog leashed outside the terrace still I wasn't allowed to dine there. Went back to Mc Donalds for a bite.
Too bad the food would have been good."
Family dining by the park,"Grub has an excellent location nestled inside the Bishan park. It was a nice walk from the carpark to the restaurant and we caught the wild fishes swimming in the “river” before we reach Grub. The food was good and priced reasonably, menu was quite extensive."
Great food and place,We had a great time with the kids and our grandfather. It's a family friendly place and was nice to have a walk around BIshan Park after an early dinner too. Staff were polite and food was yummy!
Cozy place,"Placed reservation via Chope for a booking. It was fuss free. 10 minutes before booking time, someone from the restaurant called to confirm if I was on my way. Nice service! Food was ok, the decor has changed a little from some years ago."
JUST YUM and ARRRR!,"Having looked at this small but perfectly formed restaurant online before visiting the country, we were not disappointed when we visited in person!

The environment is wonderful as it is just inside the park and the set up reflects this with a lovely outside and inside area. Staff are always friendly and helpful and the food is delicious. We have eaten several times from the main menu but have not tried the brunch yet.

Well worth a visit and a wonderful place to eat, drink and relax with yourself or friends! We will be regulars!"
Good Place for Get-Together,"Great service, awesome food, live band was good too! Do try the churros and mentaiko fries! Definitely will come back!"
Brunch Brunch Brunch,"We were there for brunch
Baby in stroller and all
A friendly place for young family
You can choose to sit indoor or outdoor
After a morning walk at Bishan park we decided to go in and try out this place
The breakfast variety was good
Burgers, waffles, sandwiches, eggs and all
Coffee was good
Price point was not too expensive
Service was efficient even with the crowd
Will go again and try Lunch"
Food is good but the coffee is mediocre,"I like the choices of burgers, the creativity and innovation on food menu, food tastes good but the coffee is really need to get some improvement. Staff is friendly tho."
Not Good At All - Churro,Uncooked Dough. Coffee was so so.... other than a good location can't say i will be back. Blah blah Blah ....to make 100 words :).
Nice Mala Burger and environment,Really nice Mala Burger and environment. Enjoyed my meetup with my friend. Definitely coming back again!
Pleasant experience,"Welcomed by the staffs with politeness and we were ushered to our reserved seats. Ordering of food is simple and seamless. But I would appreciate if there are more pictures of the food items on the menu thought there are highlighted recommendations. Food taste really good especially the mentaiko fries! Love it! Salmon was good too, as tasty as the previous time we visited the outlet. Keep up on the consistency. Overall the place is clean and neat. Would go back again! Cheers!"
"Food was better this time, but service was disappointing","Service was very disappointing. We made reservations but they called and simply changed the timing of our reservation without our approval. When we arrived, they insisted our reservation time was changed, but they made it like they did us a favor by giving us a seat. They seemed reluctant to give out more cutlery even though there wasn't enough. They would look at us and our table questionably when we asked for cutlery.

Thankfully the food was good. The Mala burger was spicy but so flavorsome and tasty, and made even better with the slice of luncheon meat.

Mentaiko fries hardly go wrong, but it was still good with the crispy fries.

Roasted vegetables and feta was appetizing, with the vegetables well-roasted to bring out the flavor and drizzled well enough with balsamic vinegar.

The carbonara was served with thick cuts of bacon which gives the dish an extra oomph and texture. The kids absolutely devour the entire plate."
Nature at door,We tried their breakfast on a Saturday morning. The food was not disappointing though a bit expensive. However having the park and nature literally at your doorstep was worth it.
value for money,"Great value for money, variety of burgers, appetisers and drinks. more brunch menu addition would be preferred."
First Experience @ Grub,"The food was delicious.
Love the environment.
Good for chilling and relax and small talk with friends.
As it was located in the middle of the park, it was as if you are in overseas.

Hope that we can bring dogs to Grub (outdoor) if possible.
And hope Grub can review the direction on their website.
Follow the instruction of taking mrt to bishan and took bus 410w and 5 mins walk but was lost while walking as there are currently construction going on and blocking the way to Grub."
"Great Movie, great service",Food was great and service was exceptional! We were well taken care by the friendly staffs even though the place was full. The food was abit of a wait but worth it.
"Good food, environment, atmosphere","Good foodie, environment and atmosphere. Price reasonable. Just that indoor abit warm. Maybe can plan event or Deejays to attract more customers."
Stick with the burgers!,"As it was our first time at Grub, besides our mains, we also ordered small plates to share. Nice selection of small plates but I felt they were priced a tad higher than I expected (they're really small plates!). The next time I come, I'll skip the small plates and just get mains.

Of the different mains we ordered, the burger was the best. Good burger at a decent price. Will stick to italian restaurants for pasta and American joints for ribs. There's a nice range of burgers that include chicken and pork burgers. Non-beef eaters will not go hungry, don't worry. :)

Service is basic at best. The young staff looked quite stressed (went on a busy Sat night) and I didn't see a single smile. But we got our food quickly so that was great. Diners get their own water so waiters really just take your orders and deliver your food."
"Great food, reasonable prices, good service","Famous for their burgers and pastas-- this was what the waiter told me as he gave me their menu. After spending 200 dollars and one hour at Grub, I can say this is true. I loved their burgers, and for a party of six persons having a main each, drinks, and six appetisers, the price we paid was reasonable for the quality and serving size of the food. Service was fast and polite, and the ambience was lovely. I will definitely be back!"
Food ok. Staff cleanliness can be improved,"Saw the service crew touching the dustbin in the kitchen. Without cleaning their hands, they continued serving... Complained the chair was dirty, staff simply switched it with the chair of empty table without cleaning it..."
"Good food, great ambience",Enjoyed the food- completely revamped menu just last week. Service could be a tad bit better as they may be short on staff.
Frustrating service experience - never got our food,"So frustrated that I’m actually writing a review. Sat down at noon with my husband and our 2 small kids, and ordered by 12:15. When we asked a waiter to check on our order when we had still not received any food by 12:45, they told us it was the next order up. Asked again 10 min later with no response. Asked again at 1:00 and were told that the kitchen missed our order and “I’m sorry about that.” Meaning first no one noticed that we were sitting there with kids going crazy waiting for 30 min initially, and all the way up until 45 min from ordering even when we asked them to check our order, no one actually did. We told them to cancel the order and we left. They gave us no further apologies and did not offer to rush any food order, comp any part of the meal, or anything. Never even tried the food, but we won’t be going back."
"relax, simple and good food in a park...","Amidst the heat of Singapore, Grub provided the best setting to have a simple good food, casual catch up with friends and family. Menu is innovative without trying too hard, while keeping the flavour. Place of choice."
Good,Food was delicious and ambience was great on a Sunday afternoon. We had a relaxing time and enjoyed the food very much.
Delicious food surrounded by nature,"Grub truly lives up to its reputation of offering delicious food at affordable prices. Some of the fusion dishes we had were: Har Cheong Kai Chicken with waffles, Sakura ebi shrimp pasta and portebello salad. It was a great place to enjoy a good meal with friends."
Birthday Celebration with Wife,"Booked and had our usual favourite meal at GRUB. Had mentioned it was to celebrate my wife's actual birthday in my booking and again before I paid for the meal. Was hoping that they could give the slide of cake we ordered as complimentary, but was told they don't. Slightly disappointed on that. Perhaps the management can consider this in future. Will still go back for our favourite food though."
One of the Best Burgers in Singapore,"It is a challenge to classify a food outlet in Singapore as the best as there are so many choices, but I have to admit this is the place that serves the BEST burgers.. take a bite and the flavours just explode in your mouth... i had the delux burger at medium well. The servings are massive and there is value for money. This is a place I would go again just to have that burger..."
"Cozy ambiance, great food and hospitable staff","Situated in Bishan Amk park, this place gives the cozy vibe. I Had dinner with a friend and she suggested this place. The staff are very accommodating and attentive. I went out for a while but told the staff to keep the table for me and when a group was getting my table the staff politely offered them another space. Food arrived in time, looked good, smell good and was flavorful. Their portion was generous too. With come back soon!"
Great Food & Perfect Ambiance,"Food was excellent, good service and the atmosphere was awsome. Will definitely recommend this restaurant !!!"
Tasty and cozy,"Spirit of new generation is felt in Grub. Staff is friendly and we have always received good recommendations and prompt service. Prompt must be understood as not being time measured, but comparable speed referenced to amount of patrons in.

Food quality has improved from early times to the level that Grub is now in my list of recommended restaurant cafes in Singapore parks.

Talking about parks, location is nice - in Bishan Park. Near, but away from most of city noise. My favourite time to visit is at sunset or breakfast after morning exercise. Temperature is nice to sit on terrace."
Interesting Location,"Nestled in the midst of Bishan Park, GRUB provided an excellent ambience and mains fit for the view. Would recommend to book early as the seating size of the place isn't the largest and it is always packed on weekend nights."
"Good dining experience in the park, but disappointing food","Well, if you love the experience of dining in the park, then this place is for you.

But don’t expect too much of their food. We visited slightly after lunch to avoid the crowd, and ordered their burger and pizza. The burger bun looked like it was several days old, and extremely dry. The sauces that goes along with the burger didn’t bring out the taste at all. And the patty itself was dry and not juicy at all. The fries served were also fairly cold.

Their pizza looked like something my kids can make at home too. Really nothing fantastic I would shout about, especially with the price that they charge."
Good food and pleasant environment,"Food was served timely, very relaxing environment with activities for kids. staff is very friendly and thoughtful. would go back there again for brunch with family."
Not Easiest to Find,"Food was not bad , slightly different offerings from usual brunch menus . But ... strangely no flat white on menu ! And BEWARE how you get there — it’s actually not accessed via AMK ave. 1 & the staff can’t give proper driving / parking directions . Took my driving along AMK Ave. 1 for 34 blinking minutes & making several u - turns to finally find the correct car park access !!"
Nice Food,Good food. Good service.Been here many times.Love the mushroom pizza.The new ebi pasta is nice too.
Environment Good but food.....,The shop is open at the park but the food is like precooked and not hot at all. So kindly improve and the food selection can be more besides of burger (we know is a main seller but more food selection will able to get more customer)
"Good food, lovely location","The location, overlooking Bishan Park is superb. The burger was excellent, and the service was attentive and helpful. It’s a nice place for a friendly brunch."
👍,Food was sumptuous. Warm ambience. Was not too crowded for a small group. Friendly and efficient staff.
Good experience!,I always bring my friends and family to grub! Good quality of food and good service attitude! Worth to come again!
"Great location, Pleasant atmosphere, Average food","The location is very charming – inside Bishan Park. Brick walls and simple furniture help give it an almost self-effacing look that helps it merge with the environs. You can sit in the al fresco area on cool pleasant evenings. But it being a warm day, the air conditioned interiors pulled us in. An all-glass wall gives a clear view of the verdant greens outside. And that’s the best part of Grub. You can spend time taking in the lush greenery of the park. A sight for sore eyes.
A line of strollers parked outside bore testament to the main segment that patronises the bistro. A young, vibrant crowd of families with toddlers makes for a lively, cheerful atmosphere. The health-conscious walkers and the joggers and cyclists who take advantage of the environs of Bishan Park, were, unsurprisingly, not to be seen in the restaurant.
Although well known for its burgers, we opted for a truffle mushroom pizza (very, very thin crust – almost papadam like – with creamy/cheesy herbed mushroom topping). The pizza vanished in our mouths in a jiffy. The minestrone soup, however was a big disappointment. A characterless tomato-based liquid, we left it unfinished. The Monster Green Beer that looked like an Indian sherbet was mild, not bitter (The spirulina infusion gives it it’s green colour).
Would we go there again? The food may not be a magnet, but resting our tired legs over a cup of coffee or a glass of beer is an attractive option."
Tried again - don’t bother,"So wanted to like this place, great concept and setting in Bishan Park

Food is mediocre at best, quite inconsistent even across same menu ordered by 2 persons at our table

We previously enjoyed being able to bring our dog and sit at outside patio; rudely advised policy was changed and literally told to leave as our small dog would make others uncomfortable, all while a small group of children from other tables gathered to pet her

Tried again today and ordered a beer, then told unavailable as they were switching brands and only were selling green beer until it was all gone, then more beer would be ordered

Had the makings of something great, they missed it and we won’t be back"
Good service but mediocre food/environment,"The service was good, staff were friendly and pretty attentive. However, the surrounding was really dirty. Table was dirty when I cleaned it with tissue. There were fruit flies everywhere and some weird stuff/dead insect was found on the table too. Food wise, can really be improved. Their so called signature pasta didn't taste good at all. Super blend. Steak was good though. Earl grey lemon tea tasted just like ice lemon tea. Ice cream was okay... Live band was quite disappointing. We ordered so much that I thought it'd be only logical for them to change tables for us. We literally had to combine our food into same plates because they just kept serving orders when there's already not enough space and they didnt try to make space for us too."
Relaxing brunch spot,"Visited Grub at Bishan-AMK Park on a Saturday morning for brunch and was pleasantly surprised at the serene vibe of the cafe. It wasn't hard to find via car and bus and the interior was nicely decorated, spacious, albeit quite chilly for a sunny morning. I tried the Rose Gold Latte - wow! Upgrading to the rose gold latte was a no-brainer; as opposed to having a standard latte. My friends and I shared a burger, the truffle bacon eggs, and a breakfast set. Overall, the food was excellent and lightly seasoned which is perfect for those looking for a healthy morning brekkie. The burger and patty was simple but excellently grilled to medium doneness.

Aside from it being really chilly, I recommend Grub for a casual, relaxing brunch."
Brunch at GRUB,"Within Bishan park. 1st visit. Like the chicken salad. The burger is good. Overall, can consider for repeat visit."
Dinner,"Food was great. A kids menu would be a plus since its marketed as a family bistro.
They charge a corkage of $20 per bottle, which is a tad high and they don't have wine glasses. Staff lacks attentiveness and seems to be busy chatting or on their phones."
Good food and nice ambience,Booking for seats is convenient. Was pleasantly surprise with the discount vouchers promo on Chope - purchase was simple and can be used immediately.
"Quality service, ambiance and food","Situated in the middle of bishan park, customers are prone to insect bites if seated outdoors but service crews were thoughtful enough to offer insect repellent to make the dining experience better. The food is pricey but the portion justifies the price!!"
Nice ambience,Presentation of food was glamorous but taste was okay. Customer service was amateur-ish. Iced Yuzu drink was made using the Korean Citroen mix🙄
Casual lunch with friends,"Food is mediocre, nothing too special. Alfresco dining available, outdoor area nice to sit down with friends and hang out. Won’t revisit if not in the area though."
Good is great! must try their fries! awesome too! Not forgetting their double cheese burger!,Their burger (double cheese) is fantastic! Juicy burger along with fries! Very nice environment too! Remember to get free Ice water! :)
