Lunch With My 96 years old Uncle,"We had a wonderful lunch with the caring and excellent service from Elaine, Abigail and Anne. The foods were excellent and my 96 years old uncle and I were throughly enjoying it."
Nice staff and restaurant for all year long,"Cozy ambience, friendly staff. Food was delicious! Celebrated our Christmas dinner over at Mikuni at Fairmont and We like everything about it. I would like to mention one of the staff Ms.Samantha he was great at food recommendations and we all really enjoy it so much. Thank you for your great service Samantha from arranging the reservation , table and recommendation (I think she should be
Promoted to manager ) and also with your team mates that has served us during our dinner."
"Appreciate the service, underwhelmed by food","The service team was lovely and attentive as I remembered, impossible to fault. The food was definitely above average but fell short of expectations - expectations that were inevitably guided by its rather high price point. Which brings me to the question of value - really not quite there. And interestingly, the salad I ordered was served with such an amusingly modest portion of dressing that I had to pay $5 for more - it was either that or having to eat a pretty dry bowl of greens; I got to admit, this is a first anywhere for me.

In my humble opinion, with respect to the main menu, I could easily obtain equivalent or better quality Japanese fare at a meaningfully lower price point anywhere in Central Singapore.

I really miss the full experiences at the teppanyaki counter (ala carte) or robatayaki pre-COVID. Unfortunately, for months now since Circuit Breaker was no more, no one could advise when they would be fixtures again. Unfortunately too, I am unlikely to return unless those sections re-open as before."
A happy Pre-X’mas lunch,"The staff including Abegail and Elaine were friendly and professional; they put the customers at ease.

The food was fresh and delicious.
We have a good Pre-Xmas celebration lunch."
Must try,"The place was aesthetically pleasing and the staff were attentive and very welcoming and polite. They also made suggestions but not imposing. The food was very nicely presented and explained and the food was delicious. We liked the truffle miso mayo Fried squid and the kampachi capricio black truffle sauce amberjack their signature starters. The sashimi and sushi was fresh and perfect cut, and very nice. Tempura batter was very nice and light, the prawn very fresh and crisp.

Only negative I can think of is the udon which was nothing special for that price; I works say overpriced.

We had a birthday celebration and the birthday cake was a vanilla ice cream with a candle - very nice ! Anyway, we tried different desserts and they were good. Maybe restaurant can consider adding two or three varieties of ice-cream flavours.
Special mention goes to Abegail, Johnson and Ann. Thank you for a lovely night and your wonderful hosting."
Great dining experience at Mikuni,"Felt so welcomed every time I visited Mikuni
Thanks so much to Abegail, Ann and the team
Thanks and really appreciate the attentiveness and great service! Definitely will come back again!"
Don't believe the reviews - Go somewhere else,"Raffles Hotel booked this restaurant for us which we were surprised by. They said it was very good. We are 2 adults and 2 teenagers.

In essence it is a dimly lit shabby, hugely overpriced, characterless restaurant.
We went for Tepanyaki but didn't have any as the entry level for a small bit of meat was circa a whopping 240 Singapore Dollars! The wagyu on top of our daughters noodle dish was a rubbery boiled bit of inedible meat. Poor quality ingredients in the noodle dishes in general. The sushi and vegetable tempura were very good but again, very expensive.

Service ok and friendly but no absolutely no atmosphere in this place.

We wasted one of our precious nights on holiday eating in this place. Don't make the same mistake we did, don't trust the reviews, go somewhere else."
Pricey freshness,"Excellent freshness of fish in the sashimi, sushi and miso marinated black cod. Better eaten in these styles as the dish of abalones and scallop simmered in butter soy sauce was overwhelmingly sweet which overpowered the shellfish - pity.

Lobster maki was a disappointment as hardly any lobster meat.

Very high price points not withstanding the freshness of fish. Meant only for indulgence."
Good food we can recommend,Mikuni is famous for good food...nice atmosphere too!!! Service is so-so but maybe this is just because of the labor shortage in Sing.
Nice experience.,The ambience and staff was rather friendly. It would be better if there are more varieties of food menu choices as compared to before.
Family gathering,"Overall, the food is excellent especially Tempura Mori, Dragon Maki and Tendon. The environment here is ambient and the atmosphere is very suitable for family gathering. Last but not least, we would to express our gratitude to the marvellous waiter here to make our dining experience even more wonderful. Thanks to Junior and Abegail for your warm service to us."
Family trip,The restaurant are giving the best service to my family. food was very nice ， the server Alan & Yimun making us feel comfortable ，very kind person
Wonderful dining experience,"My husband and I received as gift a voucher for a 7 courses Omakase menu and it was a wonderful culinary experience. We enjoyed every course, but the crystal caviar soup, abalone tempura and wagyu definitely stood out. The dessert too was delicious (shaved summer truffle on japanese egg ice cream). Beautiful ambient, excellent service."
Birthday dinner,Excellent service and wonderful food. ABIGAIL and Elaine give personal attention and excelent service. Kep up the good work.
Always Wonderful at Mikuni,"It was a special birthday treat.

We each had the lunch bento set (S$128/USD92/€88/£75), comprising an appetiser, sashimi, tempura, Wagyu beef, sushi and a grilled item of unagi (eel), as well as an intricate macha ice cream-and-biscuit dessert.

Everything was very delicate and pretty, like a mini Kaiseki. The Wagyu and Toro were melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and were the standout items. Service was attentive yet unobtrusive.

What a lovely lunch, especially given the fabulous company!"
Excellent Service at Mikuni,Abegail is very polite and friendly. Good quality food too. Ambience is good. Service is excellent. My unagi don was very tasty and I was also impressed with the Tempura. Crispy and fresh.

Attentive restaurant manager Ms Elaine takes good care of every dining guests at Mikuni and is a valuable asset to the group. Well Done!

Great food and service,"We had the festive dinner menu. Service was also great, thanks Alloycius! Food was amazing and delicious but portions a little small."
A Super Disappointment at Mikuni !!! Save ur wallet for other great Jap dinning .,"A terrible experience with the high end Japanese dinning , the price is on the high but it doesn’t matter cos we paying for the ambiences and the quality of food , but gosh it turn out a very very disappointment evening “ Christmas Day” , we order a few dishes with wine , one of the dishes was ebi tempura , being a tendon fan , I move around with my wife to various place for tendon , so our fav place was in tanjong pager & suntech cm, so we know what we expecting for a proper fried tempura , our tempura at mikuni was super disappointing , the tempura was u dee fried and in between the prawn and the crispy flour outside , it was just mushy and under fried , we feedback to the manager , she could’nt do anything , ask the Japanese head chef out , to our surprised he insisted the tempura was the right thing they served , so he think it was ok and insisted we eat it or just take it or leave it kind , OMG at Mukini !!!!!!!!!!!! The price point vs the standard !!!!!!!! Seriously please wake ur egotistical Jap Chef up !!!!! A lot local chef can do better than you chef !!! Not even a apologies or offer to change it !!! Again your ego put us off !!!!"
Lunch at Mikuni is awesome!,"The service staff is very friendly and attentive.
Alloysius is exceptionally amazing!
The food is well cooked to the precise taste that we love.
Great place to have your meal!"
Mikuni Raffles City - Japanese Fine Dining,"Great place, good prices and best Japanese Cuisine. Loved the Toro here. Their service staff are great too, especially Alloysius."
Friendly staff and cosy atmosphere,"comfortable and cosy ambience, staff was helpful when deciding menu items too! overall a very good experience :)"
Amazing Service and Food at Mikuni,"Apart from the amazing food, the service was beyond exceptional. We were host by Valerie and Elaine and they showed 6 star service! Will definitely be back again!"
Excellent dining,Wonderful dinner experience. Excellent service from Valerie n Elaine. Food is top notch as always. Will definitely return.
Birthday dinner,My friend invited me for my Birthday dinner in Mikuni Restaurant. Despite no birthday song is allowed but I was still surprised by a fantastic birthday ice cream from the staff and I like the welcoming hospitality from Ms Samantha. Will go back to Mikuni again.
Very good!!!!,"Very delicately made food, with good presentation. Taste is impeccable, and service is great. Highly recommend!"
Great place for dinner,"Brought my wife here to celebrate her birthday. We were served by abegail and colleagues, and their services were excellent. We were occasionally checked by the staffs for our feedbacks on the food. The food is fresh and good! It may be a bit on the pricier side but it’s worth it.

The only thing that I was disappointed about is the restaurant charge their customers for putting cake with them. I wanted to surprise my wife with a birthday cake and have the staff serve it us after the meal but was told it would cost a $35 fee to deposit a whole cake with the restaurant. The staff eventually offered a complimentary single scoop vanilla ice cream with a lighted candle for my wife on her birthday, which I find it underwhelming. Maybe I’ve been spoilt by the services offered by hai di lao and expected more from Mikuni?

Would I return to the restaurant to dine in future? Yes I would for their food, but maybe not to celebrate any joyous occasion after the experience.
For anyone who’s looking to pay for high quality Japanese food, this is the place you don’t want to miss!"
Casual Saturday Lunch,"Excellent service, fresh ingridients and most of all, pleasant ambience.

Will come back again.

Now with AMEX 50% discount. A great deal indeed"
Evening out at Mikuni with niece,"Great food, drinks and service, especially by Frannie who recommended a very pleasant sake. Definitely worth a visit."
Anniversary Dinner,We are very well served with great staff . The place is good for couple dating as it is cozy and the food is oishi.
Perfect Anniversary Date!,Love the ambiance and very friendly staff! Maguro Tuna Sashimi and Clam Soup are the best. Salmon Maki is also sumptuous and pretty big serving!
Birthday Celebration,"Celebrated wife’s bday together with the family. It was a lovely dining experience. Food, ambience, service was spot on. Keep up the good work Mikuni Team !! Our family enjoyed ourselves."
Food & Service worth our visit again,Food is fresh and service is worth our visit; the servers are really attentive and friendly. Desserts and the truffle kanpachi is really a must try! It was a great birthday experience for my friend!
Nice service and ambience,"Must eat place! Good service, had an enjoyable birthday party for friend. Come over to eat at this place. Best service ever!"
Food was fresh!,Service was awesome and food was very fresh! Dessert was really nice as well! Will definitely visit again!
Worth a visit,Excellent service and food. Definitely worth the five star experience. Nice sake selection as well that pairs with the cuisine. Overall an amazing experience.
"Great food, attentive service",I enjoyed that I never had to ask for a tea refill because the staff were so hospitable and attentive. Food quality is great too!
Business Lunch,"I've visited Mikuni several times and it remains one of favorit Japanese restaurants cos of the ambience, the service and the menu. I'd invited a business guest and what's most important to me is that he was very impressed with his experience, and we were able to dine and have a conversation comfortably. My guest had Nama Yasai Salad for starters, and we shared a Dragon Maki, Tempura Moriwase and a Unagi Kabayaki. The serving portion was just right and our appetite was more than satisfied.

I'd recommend Mikuni to all of my business contacts and friends, and I will most certainly return again when the opportunity presents itself."
Dinner at Mikuni,"Aloysius was really helpful!(: great service
Food was really tasty too! Nice place to have dinner. Would recommend!"
Remarkable Experienced,"Our 17th Wedding Anniversary Celebration were remarkably unforgettable experienced. We had a highly fresh Jou Sashimi, crispy Spider roll, delightful Salmon expression roll, nice and crisp ebiten tempura and deliciosly satisfying Unagi Don. Kuddos to Elaine, Frannie and Samantha for the impeccable and excellent service. Overall, it was great and highly recommendable."
Great experience but a little pricey,"Came here recently for dinner.

Food and service was great - I ordered Tuna (Toro) & Salmon sushi, scallop appetizer with onion butter and beef sukiyaki. Sufficient service staff and definitely prepared for a dinner crowd.

The toro really melts in your mouth and blows you away - definitely the standard I had when I visited Japan. The beef sukiyaki melted in my mouth as well with good distribution of fat. Scallop tasted great too with the lemongrass and onion butter.

Downside is that this restaurant is not cheap - a visit here will easily hit over $100 even for a simple meal for 2."
Wonderful experience,"This is our 2nd time in Mikuni, and the service here is magnificent! Staff are super friendly and the food is awesome as usual. Came here to celebrate my partner's birthday and they gave him a birthday dessert! It was a wonderful experience for us! ❤️ Will definitely come back again."
Good Meal,"It’s been long that I had a good Japanese meal, the varieties they have on the menu was good. Nice choices of white and red wine too. Everything was excellent the food speaks for itself."
My Birthday,"The food is very good, staffs are attentive and friendly. Having the quality of produce on the menu was great!"
Nice 80's Vibe & Good Food,"It has a very Patrick Bateman-esque feel to it on one side with the blue neon running down the walls and Diane Freeze style deco.
I happen to like it.
Have been here before for lunch where the value is MUCH better than for dinner. No complaints except maybe falls into the Singapore trap of over pricing all of the food to make up for what they likely have to pay to their ruthless and greedy rat landlords."
The best experience ❤,"I really like the atmosphere. I love the staff that is so accomodating to me.
Highly recommended the truffle tempura squid .
And if you really like mocktails, ask for recommendation and Abegail, will serve the best refreshing drink ever! Not forgetting her friendly smile that will make you feel comfortable .
All the staff is so friendly that they will ask you if you would like hot or cold green tea the moment you are at your table.
Thank you for the 5 star service! ❤"
Beautiful food and incredible service,"Ordered the sashimi and it was beyond expectations with the quality and presentation. Every item was amazing👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 Loved all the food presentation, and the detailed service from the staff, especially Samantha, completed the perfect meal Will definitely be back!"
Amazing food and service,"Went there with my family during our staycation. The restaurant had a nice ambience. We ordered the sashimi platter which was very fresh and delicious. Definitely the most memorable dish we had.

We were served by Samantha and Elaine who were very hospitable. They attended to all our request promptly and gave us good recommendation on what to order.

Overall it was a 5-star experience and I will go back again!"
"Good food, a little pricey","Haven’t been back for a while. Doesn’t seem as busy as before although it was a Thursday night. Two of us shared a platter of sashimi (7 types), assorted tempura and a Boston lobster. The three dishes were great and the dinner was accompanied by a bottle of red wine. Prices I thought was a little high although there have promotions from a few credit cards that makes it more worthwhile."
Mikuni always satisfies us,"Mikuni always satisfies us whenever we go,staffs are friendly and attentive! Just had a great dinner with my boyfriend,server Jun Kit recommended us very good sake and we liked it very much!! Will definitely come back again 💗"
Mikuni never disappoints!,"My family and I have been loyal customers of Mikuni for many years. I always see myself looking forward to my next time eating here because of the impressive all-rounded dining experience.

Firstly, the staff are very polite and provide very good service. They always welcome their patrons warmly, know the menu well enough to always recommend items and are also very attentive, be it whenever my glass of water needs a refill or if the plates need to be cleared to make space.

Secondly, the food is of an exemplary standard and it is definitely safe to say that Mikuni has managed to maintained it very consistently. One dish that I always order whenever I dine at Mikuni is the Ebi Tempura. To me, I cannot say that I have dined there if I did not order the Tempura. It tastes amazing and it is very fragrant; the crispy batter coats the prawn well and it is cooked beautifully. I also love that you can taste the freshness of the prawn and it goes very well with the dipping sauce.

I would like to end by acknowledging Ms Elaine for always making every dining experience at Mikuni a great one. She always exudes a very enthusiastic attitude and a pleasant disposition, recommending dishes that suit our tastes and acceding to every request. Thank you Ms Elaine and Mikuni for the many years of satisfaction and good food!"
Miyazaki Wagyu Beef lunch set,My son loved the Miyazaki Wagyu beef with crispy fried garlic slices . The melt-in your mouth texture was so good ! Thank you Ms Elaine for the recommendation.
Simple Lunch Yet Amazing,"Walked in at Mikuni and surprisingly they’re during lunch. First time in this place and was happy that were assisted by Abegail who was so helpful and efficient. She recommended us the Kingcrab Set $68++ which we enjoyed but my all time favourite is the hotate mentaiko with butter, it is to die for. The restaurant is pricy but they offer credit card discounts too DBS, OCBC & CITI i think there are more (not sure). Will surely come back and bring my family here."
Best Wagyu Beef Don in SG!!!,"To all places i have been, so far this is my ultime favourite when in it come to wagyu beef don. Mikuni serves it in a special way, using the A5 Miyazaki Sirloin in a sweet rice along it onsen egg and uni, its simply the best. I would highly recomment it to everyone!"
One of the best Japanese restaurants,"One of the best Japanese restaurants in singapore. Good for couple dates. Nice ambience. Special call out to Elaine Seng, for her excellent and dedicated service. Will definitely visit again"
Lovely Dinner,My wife and I loved this restaurant! Every single dish was something special. We are looking forward to eating here again.
Good service staff but declining in food variety.,"Mikuni is one of the few restaurants in Singapore that has both Teppanyaki and Robatayaki counters and that's what makes them unique as compared to other established japanese restaurants in the city. However, for some reasons, both counters are either closed or partially available. What's more saddening is that all of the better food comes from Teppan and Robata cooking styles. It's been months and I have visited the restaurant thrice hoping that the counters will re-open soon. Unfortunately it's still closed. However, food from the main kitchen such as Ika Kariage, Lobster Uni and Gindara Cod still lives up to the expectation and not to mention the service staff who attended to me regularly, Mr JunKit, displayed consistent performance in interacting with us and recommending new Sake. Hope to see the food from both counters returning soon!"
Average food with exorbitant price tag,"We had a lovely dinner at SKAI and our helpful server told us Mikuni their chain resto is also very good. So we booked it for next day dinner. Location is closer connected to Raffles City shopping mall and not at Fairmont hotel. We ordered Jou Sashimi at SGD 125 and Tokujou Sushi SGD 120. When they turn up, we thought it was a joke. The sashimi portion and selection are ridiculous small and few. We can't believe this is SGD 125 plate. The Sushi yes is not bad quality but no way can it warrant a 120 price tag. We've to order extra Lobster Maki as we're still hungry. We shared Cod fish which is done well but again at SGD 65 for that is disappointing. We wanted to try a bottle of their sake and ask for recommendation, end up server show us 2 very ordinary sake at SGD 155-158 range. We ask for wine list and choose the same bottle we had at SKAI but this same bottle in this same chain cost SGD 20 more at Mikuni. Our bill comes to SGD 600. It was so not satisfying and we'll never be back again."
Pleasant dinner experience ❤️,"I had a birthday dinner with my hubby, and it was as always, very pleasant experience. Food was good and Staff was very friendly and accommodating.. definitely will come again! Thank you Elaine for taking care of us!"
"Relaxed , Soothing Fine Dining Japanese Outlet","We enjoyed the calming ambience coupled with refined service provided by our very obliging & cheerful Ms Samantha . The food we ordered were very tasty-
Salmon Expression Roll $24/-
Tempura Mariawase $38/-
Unagi Kabayaki $45/-
Gindara Saikyou Miso Yaki $65/-
Steamed Rice $8/-
Of these , the Unagi was superb and came in vert generous portion ! However we found the $8/- steamed rice(Japanese) hard to stomach LAH !"
Dinner at Mikuni,"Food is great, environment is clean, ambience is excellent. Elaine was wonderful. We have not been here for probably a couple of years and yet she still remembered us. Wonderful wonderful service. Thanks Elaine!"
Fine dining japanese restaurant,"First, the staff are very friendly and attentive. You will be taken care of once u step inside the place. Secondly, food was awesome. I ordered the A5 Wagyu Beef set, the beef was so tender. And please order the warm hokkaido milk soft cheese feuillet, for its taste it’s so worth it. I guess for non milk eaters, you will love this dessert as well. I will definitely come back to Mikuni again~"
"Great ambiance, friendly staff","Nice place, Great ambiance, cozy, staff are friendly and great & delicious food. Must try restaurant at Fairmont hotel."
Wonderful Anniversary Dinner,"Elaine and Abegail made our dining experience wonderful. We were celebrating our anniversary and wanted a special dinner. We were not disappointed. The scallops, squid and sashimi were divine. The wagyu teppanyanki was delightful. Desserts were heavenly."
Hidden Gem,"Interior design and the lights setting of the restaurant was great , which gave off a setting befitting a japanese seafood restaurant. Was served by one of the female staff, she was very attentive and accommonding to our request and gave very good recommendations too! Ordered one Kurobuta Pork Katsu ,am very satisfied with the portion and flavour, overall a very pleasant experience , will definitely be one of my places to go to!"

Family Staycation,"Our 1st visit to Mikuni and will most definitely not be our last.

おいしい〜,"Mikuni is one of my go-to Japanese restaurants in Singapore. They have a wide array of choices for different types of Japanese food with excellent quality. I personally like the Wagyu Beef Fried Rice. Food is good and service is even greater!

I would like to compliment the team at Mikuni, especially Abegail. Service is always prompt, attentive and friendly. Kudos to Mikuni!"
Great food and service!,Mikuni remains a favourite. Try the wagyu sukiyaki konabe! Service was great! Friendly staff. Thanks Abigail!
Amazing Grand Tasting Menu & Sake Pairing,"We normally come here for teppanyaki and robatayaki but since the counters are closed we tried the dinner set which didn’t disappoint us. Good job to the lady manager/sake sommelier Abigail for well educating us about the sake, its category, taste, history and how its been perfectly pair with dishes. Excellent service and all the staff were very friendly. We will surely come back for the next menu and another Sake pairing."
Favorite Restaurant for MI(yazaki beef)KU(robuta pork)NI(tsuke fish cheek) 🥩🥓🐟,"Mikuni has always been our preferred dining restaurant due to its interior layout and lighting intensity. Stepping into a semi dark area does give off a classy ambience that makes you shuddering in anticipation to what the restaurant has in store for you. It's been a long while since my friends and I patronized the Japanese restaurant of Fairmont Singapore. On our lastest visit for dinner 2 days ago, we were greeted by the same kind of hospitality that was given to us before the circuit breaker period. Apart from the slight disappointment that the Teppanyaki Counter wasn't fully opened yet and the Robata menu selection isn't available as well, we did have a pleasant meal. Special shoutout to our favorite server JunKit for taking care of us. Hope to visit the restaurant again during Xmas day!"
18th birthday celebration,"The birthday girl enjoyed the Miyazaki Beef topped with uni, ikura and onsen egg rice bowl very much. The beef was juicy and literally melts in your mouth. Thank you Ms Elaine Seng for her recommendations on “blue bottle” sakes promotion on Mondays and her very attentive service !"
"Dark ambience, slow service","We have booked a table at Mikuni at 12.45pm and started order at 1pm. We ordered a autumn seasonal set lunch which supposed to be prepared in advance. It only be served at 1.30pm, before that only a small plate of photo chips. The ambience is so dark and I started to feel dizziness after a cup of green tea which make my sugar lever lower, plus the aircon is very cold. I stared feeling unwell after waited for so long. And since it a work day lunch, the desert was only served aroubd 3pm and I need to rush back office. Unexpected service and bad ambience. Food is average and pricy. Not recommended for business lunch Coz the speed of service is slow and family gathering as the light is so dark."
Kudos Mikuni!,Kudos Mikuni team for making our dinner one of the best. From start till the end of our meal they never fail to give a excellent service. Very professional and knowledgeable with all their product. Will surely recommend with other friends.
Dinner,"Very enjoy having meal in Mikuni. But very miss their teppanyaki by Chef Eric, closed since after CB. Have been here very times. Staffs are friendly, good recommendation on food selection by Elaine Seng. Have been bring lots of friends over for lunch or dinner. Will recommend to more friends."
Mikuni dinner,"Good service and friendly staff, served by Jacky n Abegail .Food was great!The kama and lobster is very well complimented with wine."
Splendor Evening At Mikuni,Fantastic Service from the service team lead by Elaine. Great dining experience with new creation of set menu periodically to have new tasting experiences every time.
