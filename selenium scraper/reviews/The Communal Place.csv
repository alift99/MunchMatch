Great place to eat,"Octopus chorizo and fish tacos were both 10/10. The sauce on the octopus was the perfect level of spice, noticeable but didn't overpower the other flavours in the dish. I the fried fish went surprisingly well with the taco as well. Definitely something I'll order again.
I don't think it says anywhere, but if you order the chocolate dome, they let you yeet it into the plate to break the shell. That was a pretty cool experience.
Also, Sapporo is life and they have it on tap"
Delicious,I enjoyed every single bite of my Mentai Pasta: it tasted simply amazing since all the flavors were perfect. The chocolate dome was also a impressively fun and tasty dessert. Definitely coming back to try more items off their menu!
Good food and service,I tried the beef cheeks ragu which i enjoyed very much. The portion was good and filling. Service was great too.
The Communal Place @ Joo Chiat,"Delicious cafe food! The fish and chips were fresh and juicy, and the batter was crisp and not overly thick - really love it! Salmon was grilled to perfection with mentai mayo that was lightly charred! Salmon was fresh and there was no fishy smell! The iced white was great although not spectacular and their basque burnt cheesecake was quite a thick slab I got to say for $10 I would say its not bad! Total damage was approximately $75 rounded up and I got to say it is definitely expensive but it is like your standard cafés but with a wider range of food (ie arent limited to brunch options!)"
Great food with a cozy ambience,"This is a charming and cosy bistro along Joo Chiat Road I ordered the fish tacos, seafood bouillabaisse, and miso salmon for sharing and it was such a satisfying dinner! The fish tacos were definitely the highlight for me — super crispy yet succulent beer-battered fish, and tangy salsa, rounded off with a rich chipotle sauce. Special mention for the bouillabaisse as well, which had a hearty deep broth and fresh seafood. Can’t wait to go back and try their other dishes!"
Great vibes and service!,"I had the Fish Tacos, Miso Salmon & Bouillabaisse (a seafood broth with dory, prawns, clams, octopus and ciabatta). The beer-battered dory was nice and hot, giving a satisfying crunch to the exterior and perfectly cooked fish inside.

I was honestly pretty apprehensive about the Bouillabaisse as I've never had it before... and I was not a huge fan of seafood but wanted to try a soup dish. It ended up being a pleasant surprise! The broth was rich yet light, with great seafood ingredients. Although I had the soup by myself, I felt that would taste best when shared with everyone at the table, and slowly consumed throughout the meal.

Overall, a satisfying experience at The Communal Place. would come again!"
Nice atmosphere,"Place was nicely decorated, nice atmosphere. Ordered the butterfly chicken and 2 smaller items for sharing. Chicken was juicy, nicely cooked and flavorful, enjoyed it. Would come back for the chicken again"
Overrated,"The place is very loud and noisy, the cemented interior walls and floors bounce all the noise.
In terms of service the 5 of us were served one by one, by the time the 5th person got served, the first ones had either finished or their dishes went cold.
Food is okay, good portions and taste.
The reviews are surprising and overrated for an okay place. I will be more careful with all TripAdvisor ratings next time."
Good food in a nice location,"We had the mentai salmon and fish and chips, and had some burnt cheesecake for dessert. The food was good and we had an enjoyable experience."
Salmon Mentaiko Pasta and Fish Tacos,Ordered their Salmon Mentai and Fish Taco and they are seriously Superb! Love how the mentaiko integrates so well into the pasta sauce and the fish tacos is so soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Highly recommend!
Great pasta,"Great lunch hangout spot with pretty interior! I had the spicy scallop aglo for mains which I would recommend to those who love a mild spicy kick to their pasta! To end off, I also tried the basque burnt cheesecake which was delicious and creamy. Overall, great service with attentive and prompt servers. Would definitely pay another visit if I'm in the area!"
Amazing food,Ordered Pulled Pork Burger and beef cheeks Ragu. Pulled pork was fantastic as well as the beef cheeks ragu. The beef cheeks was so tender. Absolutely loved the sauce for the Ragu. Price for the food and beer is reasonable as well!
Would recommend!,"Nice cosy vibes, food was good - ordered the pulled pork burger and beef cheeks ragu, and both meat were tender and tasty. pasta was al dente as well."
Disappointed,"We read the reviews and decided to give it a try.

I had the Wagu Burger and Bouillabaisse (shared). My wife had the Octopus Chorizo and Spicy Scallop Aglo. We each had a beer with dinner. The total bill for the two of us was about $130(S).

In review:

The service was prompt and the restaurant has a good presentation (tables are appropriately spaced and not crowded).

The Bouillabaisse was fairly good. The toast with it was quite oily and the octopus and clams were very small.

The Wagu burger was well done and because of this, the Wagu lacked moisture and flavor. The fries were tepid. The accompanying salad was good with a balsamic dressing that complimented the greens.

The Octopus Chorizo was moderately good, though the Chorizo could have used a sear and the Octopus was baby octopus. The menu indicated octopus leg - which is what was expected.

I didn’t try the Spicy Scallop Aglo and rely on my wife’s opinions. The pasta cooked properly. The dish, though advertised as spicy was a bit over spiced and was lacking some liquid. She is usually quite forgiving with restaurant food, but didn’t come close to finishing the dish.

The beer was cold.

Overall, it wasn’t the worst dining experience. However for the price and given the prior reviews, the quality was not in line."
Great atmosphere and vibes!,"Nice place to hangout, relaxing atmosphere and vibes. Their Yuzu Chicken was interesting and huge, great for sharing!"
Pls order Foie Grass Miso Linguine,"Highly recommend the Foie Grass Miso Linguine. The subtle taste of miso, creamy linguine and perfectly cooked foie grass blends well altogether. The dish is unexpectedly tasty & presented a well-balanced of flavours. Next up, we ordered Risotto with sausage. Risotto was crispy and paired well with the giant sausage + sour cream. Salad veggies was fresh too. Sweetness was just right for the Passion Fruit Oolong that we ordered. Highly recommended."
Amazing Ambience with Great Food,"We ordered the Foie Grass Miso Linguine. Creamy light miso linguine was rich in taste. Foie grass was perfectly cooked, not oily, and tasted good. We also ordered the Risotto which tasted great especially with the sides being crispy. The giant sausage was juicy and filing. Will come back again for the tasty food and amazing ambience."
Tender beef ✌️,"The Bouillabaisse was delicious and a must order if you are a seafood lover! The broth had good amount of meat but I wish there was more soup! We also ordered Foie Gras Miso Pasta and the Beef Cheeks Ragu. The Miso pasta was decent but we prefer the ragu, as it was cooked with the most tender beef cheeks. Unfortunately did not try the fish tacos so will come back in the future to try it out!"
wide selection of western fare!,we ordered the seafood bouillabaisse as a starter and it exceeded our expectations! the seafood broth was sweet and it tasted like a scoop of the ocean. i ordered the foie gras and miso pasta which was nice as well but the foie gras was a little overlooked. the price point is a bit steep but overall a pleasant dining experience!
great place for a gathering with friends!,"first time here, loved the music! was spoilt for choice by the extensive menu, but went with their scallop spicy aglio as well as the bangers & mash. the scallop spicy aglio is unlike any aglio olio i’ve had. scallops were fresh and there were bits of bacon in every bite. level of spice hit the spot i was taken away by a surprising combination in the bangers & mash: the cherry tomato in the side salad + the belgium mash = heaven in a bite. the sweetness of the cherry tomato really complemented the buttery, creamy smooth mashed potato! also loved that they welcomed us with the “welcome drink”—the pomelo pulp was the cherry on top of a refreshing quencher. would love to come back to try their other stuff!"
Wagyu beef burger,Cozy nice environment with good ambient lighting and nice floral decorations. The staff was friendly and attentive. Waited about 15 minutes for the food to come so was still rather reasonable. They also have a huge selection on their menu that I'm sure will cater to everyone.
Wonderful comfort food!,"Really love the ambience of this cosy little place! Mentaiko pasta is amazing, welcome drink is appetising and sweet, sides compliment mains so well, what else could you ask for?"
Best mentaiko pasta,"I was really happy with the mentaiko pasta here. I also tried the wagyu burger, the fries, the chicken wings and the ice cream with waffles, which were all good too. I appreciated the welcome drink given to us for free, which set the tone for a great meal!"
"Nice environment, friendly servers and yummy food",Enjoyed the fish n chips which was a huge portion that could easily be shared by more than 1 pax. The servers brought us a welcome drink which was nice and refreshing and the place was a really nice place to chill and hang out.
yummy burger and nice place to chill,enjoyed the burger which was really moist and the fries were yummy too! the servers brought us a welcome drink and that instantly lit up our meal. the servers were really friendly and the environment was good with a very chill vibe.
Cosy dinner place with good food,"Highly recommend The Communal Place for dinner & drinks! It had great food, a cosy vibe and good service. We ordered the fish tacos, wagyu burger and beef cheeks ragu (fish tacos were crispy, saucy and all-around amazing)"
Explosive fish tacos,"Many reviews said the fish tacos are good. They are wrong, the fish tacos are amazing. The batter is so crispy it explodes in your mouth and the delicate fish melts after. The mains were good and filling. Sapporo on tap is great, especially the lychee beer. Ambiance of the place was nice and relaxing too. Great place for a casual drink and good food."
"An Unknown, Quiet Western Place","A great place to visit when café-hopping or for a casual business lunch. I personally found the hip atmosphere enjoyable, especially on a weekday where less people were hanging out past 3pm.

There was a great variety of drinks and the western fusion food was superb. My personal favourite was the Foie Gras Bruschetta - the richness of the liver was nicely complimented by the crispy ciabatta and miso paste

10/10 would visit again!"
"The communal place, good place to destress!","Had a very hectic monday and went out to eat here with a friend and will say that eating here has succesfully helped me destress! Since it was a monday night the place wasn't crowded and there was parking! It's a really nice vibe to chill with chic wooden table and mellow lighting and the food came out quick! Upon sitting they served us a shot of refreshment each, it was a sweet blue carbonated drink with a unique taste. We ordered a pulled pork burger that has a big portion so definitely worth the money, its more to sweet than savoury! We also got the truffle fries, again in big portion. Lastly ordered a glass of beer that was reasonable in price and definitely helped me relax!"
Great food and ambience,"The Communal Place had great decor, good vides, excellent music, and delicious food. I recommend for people to come on weekdays especially. Overall, a great experience!"
good cafe in katong,really love the ambience of this place. quiet and chill and a good place to have a meal with friends. ordered the fish tacos and it is so yummy. the fish in fish tacos is fry to golden crispiness and the pickle compliment the fried fish really well. the frozen tiramisu is really a good end to the meal. was skeptical as it did not look like the traditional tiramisu but omg the frozen version is so good! highly recommend tcp!
Nice Restaurant For Group Outings,"I had dinner here with my friend earlier this month.

The best thing about the restaurant is their wide selection of food. Although the selection for each type of food is not as wide as you would find in a more specialized restaurant, you will surely be able to find a favorite dish for everyone in your group. This makes the restaurant ideal for group outings.

After taking some time to decide, we decided to go with the rosti, pulled pork burger, and smash meatball. The food is in general quite well made for the price range. Among these I like the pulled pork burger most.

The restaurant also offers some selection of desserts. We ordered the chocolate dome and had great fun dropping it onto a plate to break the chocolate shell."
CHOCOLATE DOME!,"Fantastic food and ambience! Dropped by here with a good friend and we had a great time. I had the smash meatball, rosti, wagyu burger, and i liked them all. I also really liked the welcome drink so i ordered another whole glass of it hehe. Ended off the night with a chocolate dome and i loved how we could drop it from a great height! Its a lovely dessert experience even tho I lifted the dome a little too high and the chocolate bits went everywhere :D. Loved this place and would recommend people to go :)"
Best fish Tacos in Town,"I have never tasted fish tacos like this. It ended my hectic day on a good note. Trust me on this, try the fish tacos and you’ll thank me later. The rest of the food was great too, the bouillabaisse soup was also a great choice for a starter.

Honestly one of the best add ons to this place is that there are parking lots just outside the restaurant."
Fish tacos are absolutely bomb!!,Food was amazing and ambience was great! Make sure to order the Fish Tacos which was the best item on the menu! We ordered the recommended items from the menu and was blown away by its taste! Will definitely come back for more!
Dinner with friends,A nice place with a cozy ambience. Came here with a friend for dinner and ordered their steak for sharing. Meat was well seasoned and of good texture. Their service staff was also responsive. Overall a good experience!
Relaxing Atmosphere serving Contemporary Western Fusion Food!,"Came by on a weekday night, and was warmly greeted with a welcome soda drink. Loved the ambience and atmosphere of the cafe, a great place to relax and unwind after a long and tiring day of work!

My partner and I were spoilt for choice, as there was a large selection in the menu to choose from. We finally decided on the Medium Rare Steak and Fish N Chips.

Overall, the food and drinks served were decent!"
great food!,"welcome drink was really pleasant! fish tacos was great, soft tender fish with crispy batter with a great sauce! beef cheeks ragu had a wonderfully light yet flavourful sauce, with beef cheeks so soft. mentaiko pasta with smoked salmon was alright! iced chocolate was nice!"
Western/Pasta/Drinks,"Ambience was nice and cozy, welcome drink was a 10/10, would recommend to try it. Fish tacos was very fresh and crispy, with a good amount of sauce. Pastas were not bad! Would recommend to try the beef one if you like tomato base and the mentaiko salmon pasta if you would like something more savoury!"
Amazing and Cozy Atmosphere,"Amazing experience at The Communal Place, ordered the lychee draft beer which has an intense lychee flavour alongside fish and chip also pulled pork taco! Ended off with the chocolate dome dessert which has an interesting presentation :)"
Cozy cafe!,Cozy cafe along Joo Chiat road! We came on a weekday evening and managed to snap this photo of the dreamy environment before the dinner crowd. Was served a petite blue welcome drink which is nice. Food is decent.
Review for The Communal Place,"Enjoyable experience at The Communal Place, ordered the Lychee and Passionfruit Draftbeer respectively which was smooth and paired well with the mains. For mains, we ordered the pulled pork taco and fish & chips which both tasted really good! Lastly, ordered the Chocolate Dome dessert which i highly recommend as it was both tasty and interesting (order it to find out )"
Have fun with their dessert! (':,"Comfortable dining place with delicious food! The wagyu beef burger was worth the wait and their dessert has really surprised me.. have never eaten a dessert with so much ""hands-on"" experience HAHAHA Love it!"
Flavour bomb,Wagyu burger patty was so tasty and huge! probably like 2 inches thick! Yuzu chicken was really tender and the glaze pairs well with the perfectly roasted chicken. Chocolate dome was a fun way to end the meal with a crash as you drop the dome on the plate!
The Communal Place,"Pleasant surprise to receive welcome drinks after being brought to our table; it was so nice! The mushroom soup was quite yummy! Just wished that the chocolate dome was available, but unfortunately it was sold out :(

Other than that, I guess it's a good place to go with your friends to chitchat as it's a pretty cosy place."
Thursday date night,"This is a cosy place! We had the mushroom soup and fish tacos for appetisers, the mushroom soupis really fragrant! Ordered the miso salmon for mains, the salmon was cooked nicely, leaving the fish juicy and flaky and the miso sauce makes a good combination with the fish. Lastly, we had a basque cheese cake for the finish."
Recommended place for dinner!,One of the better restaurants which i visited.. served me wonderful welcome drink. Food are fresh and nice. Will return.
Nice cozy cafe at Tanjong Katong,"Nice cozy cafe at Tanjong Katong offering western cuisine. It was wonderful to be given a complimentary welcome drink that was both tasty and refreshing. We ordered the pan-seared steak and spicy scallop aglio. The pasta was cooked al dente and scallops were seasoned and grilled to perfection, which was very fresh and delicious. The pan-seared steak was perfectly done on the outside, with a crispy crust on the outside, and the smooth and creamy mashed potatoes added a beautiful finishing touch to the entrée."
Excellent Bouillabaisse,"Welcomed with a cocktail shot which perked up the pallete. Ordered their Bouillabaisse and Miso Salmon. Would give the Bouillabaisse 10 out of 10, amazing thick & flavourful seafood broth - a great way to start your course. Miso Salmon was sweet and light, the charred miso sauce melting above the salmon gave away not only a great smell but an appetising aftertaste. Overall, pleasant experience - suitable for date nights."
Cafe with wide variety of offerings,"A chill place to hang out - space was quite big, so definitely one to consider to hold birthday events and such. Food wise was quite the surprise: the bouillabaisse is a must order - the broth was complimented so well with the other ingredients in it. The yuzu chicken came in quite the portion.. the yuzu was subtle yet provided quite the sweet nodes to the taste of the chicken.. Miso salmon also another highlight"
Nice Spicy Scallop Aglio!,"The Spicy Scallop Aglio was really fragrant and is not too spicy, the pan-seared Canadian scallops were really fresh and juicy, making a good combo with the bacon and linguine! Also, we had the pan-seared steak, the meat sauce was flavourful while the mashed potato and glazed vegetables added a nice touch to the dish! Highly recommend The Communal Place!"
Interesting Fusion Food Restaurant,"Came with friends on a weekday noon for lunch.
Once inside we were immediately greeted with a welcome drink. It was slightly sweet, carbonated and super refreshing on a hot day.

We ordered the truffle fries, beef cheek ragu and the foie gras miso. Service was fast and the staff were friendly. Ambience was great with well decorated walls for photo taking. Good place to come with friends after school/work and on non-peak hours seemed like quite a good place to get some work done too.

Food wise, the truffle fries were freshly fried and had a strong truffle taste which we were very impressed by.

The foie gras miso is also very unique. Loved the eastern-western fusion of flavours. The foie gras was nicely seared with a strong nutty flavour which complements the miso sauce well.

Overall a great food place. Would come back to eat again if I'm in the area."
"Great Food, Stylish and Modern Interior",Headed here for lunch and it was relatively packed so it took some time for the food to come. I ordered the miso salmon and it was extremely delicious! It was cooked well and the sauce was very complementary. I also enjoyed the slightly sour but creamy mashed potatoes and vegetables. The hot chocolate was also really delightful.
Good food and service,"nice comfy cafe in tanjong katong! had the truffle mushroom soup and the off-menu ribs, both were great! with big portions and strong flavours, would come back again!"
Fancy a lunch date!,"Ambience and service was awesome. Had the mushroom soup, pork ribs and spicy aglio olio.

Ribs were soft and succulent. The aglio olio doesn’t use the usual chilli. Suspect they used Asian hei bi hiam chilli sauce, which was an awesome combination to the garlic sauce. Not too overpowering."
"Stylish Interior, Good Vibes","Atmosphere was good, staff were friendly and food were satisfactory. Greeted with complimentary mocktail which was nice! I ordered Fish & Chips & prawn paste chicken wings. Overall pleasant experience. 4.5/5"
Delightful Yuzu Chicken,"Loved their yuzu chicken, and their steak!! Yuzu chicken was crispy on the outside tender on the inside, and had a sweet aftertaste that complimented the flavourful meat. Had a nice shot of their mocktail once we got there, and their Osmanthus tea was very fragrant, a refreshing contrast to the meal. Great aesthetics, would drop by again if I’m in the area!"
Definitely worth a visit!,Food and ambience was great! Scallop aglio is a must!! Har cheong gai was really flavourful as well. Definitely will return! 👍
The Communal Place,"We ordered the Foie Gras Miso which was creamy but not overly heavy. The restaurant was generous with the portion of foie gras and it does give a surprising flavour to the entire dish. We also had the Har Cheong Kai which was very crispy. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience and I’ll definitely be back again!"
Great food & ambience for date,"Visited this cafe on a weekday night with my +1. I ordered the miso salmon for myself & yuzu chicken to share. Upon entering the cafe, we were greeted warmly with a welcome drink which was pretty unique because it was blue, fizzy and with a top of pomelo bits. The drink was surprisingly good as the pomelo bits gave a tinge of crunchiness and it was also fresh. My personal favourite has got to be the miso salmon as the fish was tender and the sauce complimented the taste. It was so good I finished the entire plate! The yuzu chicken was good as well - the chicken was not too dry and the portion was huge. My boyfriend and I almost couldn’t finish it together as a shared side. The place is really suitable for dates and it even has an instagrammable wall there!"
good aesthetics,"good place to chill and hang out with your friends. enjoyed the aesthetics and the food was good there too. liked the steak alot, it wasnt too chewy nor tough. overall a good experience"
Great place to chill out,"Great place to chill out, enjoyed the ambience with nice food, especially like the mushroom soup !!!!"
Hidden Gem in Katong Area with amazing food and drinks,"Visited the communal place for the first time on a weekday evening and was definitely not disappointed. Upon stepping in, I felt very welcomed, especially with the excellent service staff. After we settled down, we were served a complimentary welcome mocktail drink that was fruity and refreshing - gulped it down too quickly to snap a pic. Tried out some of their dishes, really enjoyed the Fish Tacos which was really appetizing and tasty, the batter used for the fish was light and airy and was nicely seasoned. Their Spicy Scallop Olio was also a pleasant surprise - not only were the scallops which was grilled to perfection, the pasta was also tossed with tobiko which really enhanced the flavor to a whole new level. The linguine itself was also cooked al dente and was not too spicy as well.

There was even a happy hour promo for the drinks and we got something really special - passionfruit/lychee sapporo beer. It's the first time ever trying such a combination and it did not disappoint. Will definitely be back to try out their other dishes and just chill and this relaxing and cozy place some other day! :)"
Nice food nice ambience,"Went for dinner on a Friday. The place is quite nice and comfortable . We Ordered mushroom soup, salad, burger , dessert and wine. Like the mushroom soup which is full of flavour and the pullpork burger which i hardly find in Singapore. The wines are ok ok. Will go back again."
Affordable and delicious Western cuisine,Ate the Fish Tacos as the appetiser and Seafood Bouillabaisse pasta for my mains. The appetiser had a buttery and crispy exterior with a sweet and moist interior of fish. Seafood pasta was al dente with a thick sauce that bursted with seafood flavour. Must try !
Cozy Western Restaurant,"Gf and I ordered the foie gras masago, miso salmon and yuzu chicken to share. The portions are relatively huge, we had trouble finish the chicken. The complimentary welcome sip is refreshing as well. Wanted to order the desert if we werent so full, but will definitely come back for it. Cozy environment and excellent services make this a good date idea :D"
Dinner at The Communal Place,"The restaurant itself was really cosy. Service was really fantastic, we really felt welcome. Food was well cooked and the mocktails looked really pretty. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking to have a chill and relaxed time."
"Good food, Chill Vibes","I had a good time dining at The Communal Place. I had gone down over the weekend with a friend. Loved the ambience. It had a chill vibe. Enjoyed the food there as well. We had Har Cheong Gai as our starter. It was my first time trying that dish hence I felt that it was nice that the prawn paste wasn't too overpowering. It was just nice. For our mains, I had Fish and Chips while my friend had the Salmon. The fish was really crunchy and tasted good. The portion size was quite big though, had trouble finishing the chips. My friend enjoyed his main as well. We both had mocktails and liked our drinks. One thing I must say though is that I loved the plating of everything we had that day. I would definitely come back another time"
A must try for first timers,"Had a great time at the place. The waitress was very friendly and professional in their service. The mains were great as well (tried Salmon and Steak). However, the highlight was the chocolate dome dessert that we had after the mains. The dessert was very satisfying from presentation to taste. That was totally worth the spend and would recommend trying it out if you were to visit the place."
Dinning,"Casual relaxing place to chill out with contemporary fusion food and drinks.

Foie Gras # Miso is an elegant dish of linguine served with seared foie gras blended nicely with miso cream sauce and bacon bits. Also had the Yuzu Chicken which was grilled slightly with charred skin but the breast meat was moist and tender. End the meal with Tiramisu satisfactory.

Great service staff giving helpful advice on the menu offers an excellent finishing touch to the dinner."
"Cosy place, good food!",Very cosy and nice place! It's quite relaxing to be there on a Monday evening. I ordered the pan seared steak and it's very good! The steak is very well cooked and there is a layer of crispy crust on the outside. The mash potato is very creamy and soft! I also ordered the dessert which is the chocolate dome where I have to break it to eat what is inside. Super fun and delicious! Highly recommended! The service is also excellent!
Cozy place with modern fusion food,"Extremely cozy place to chill out serving contemporary western fusion food and drinks for bonding with family and friends. CNY décor tastefully done to add on to the festive mood.

Ordered the Bouillabaisse which is a seafood broth served with fresh prawns, squids, and dory fish. Yuzu Chicken was also very well marinated and grilled lightly favored with yuzu sauce to give an excellent finishing touch.

Great place to have a good meal with relaxing environment without burning a hole in your pocket."
Wonderful Ambience and Delectable Fish Tacos!!,"The Communal Place is a cozy and comfortable space, perfect for friends and family to gather :)

We had the main dishes of Miso Salmon and Seafood Cream, both were delectable although the highlight of the day was the Fish Tacos! The fish was fresh and juicy, and the entire dish was completed with the savoury sauce :) a must try! We also had Cappucino and ice chocolate to complete a wonderful meal :)

Would recommend The Communal Place as the ambience is truly wonderful, perfect for gatherings! If you come by, remember to try the fish tacos as well! :)"
Fish tacos are a must have!! 😋,"Wonderful ambience at The Communal Place. Family friendly place, with many bringing their children!

Ordered a Miso Salmon, Seafood Cream, Fish Tacos and some drinks. The fish tacos were the star of the show, with succulent, perfectly fried filets and savory sauce. 10/10 would come back again! ☺️"
Cosy restaurant~,"Nice chill ambience! pretty easy to get there too, w lots of buses in the area. yuzu chicken was really good with a slightly sweet glaze and the truffle fries were a huge portion (tho i wish the truffle taste was stronger). miso and foie gras pasta was pretty novel to me, but i think foie gras is just not my thing hahaha. do note if u want to order the yuzu chicken: it'll take slightly longer than other dishes, but i do think its worth the wait! worth a try"
Comfy place for good food :),"Got the yuzu chicken, foie gras & miso pasta and truffle fries! really liked the yuzu chicken, the meat was super juicy (even the breast meat!) and the yuzu glaze was a refreshing sweetness :) fries had a light truffle taste, portion was super generous for the price! foie gras & miso pasta was okay, i felt like the miso taste could be stronger! but overall great experience, cozy atmosphere and friendly service (they gave a free drink, see pic!) would come back to try the desserts, especially the chocolate dome which i saw other people smash and that looked really fun"
Must-try fish tacos,"The restaurant itself has a cosy vibe, so it's a great place to hang out and catch up with friends! We tried the pan-seared steak, fish tacos, and tiramisu. Highlight of our dinner was definitely the fish tacos - very crispy and well-seasoned!

Would definitely come back again to try their other dishes!"
Amazing Mushroom Soup,"The mushroom soup is one of the best i’ve ever had, must try. The portion is huge too, good for sharing. The chicken too was amazing, very flavourful. However the truffle fries and pasta was not as good as I expected it to be.
Overall a good experience! Worth a try."
Wonderful pasta,"Very accommodative , my sons favorite pasta place. Love scallop , prawn and bacon pasta dish up by the chef for my son!!! Loved pulled pork burger and fish taco and salads too. Wonderful staff and service."
Fish taco,"Very nice decor and special menu, love the fish taco. Great place to enjoy with friends and go for a walk after dinner as well."
New Brunch Spot,"A new brunch spot in the streets of Katong! It was nice cozy ambience perfect for a good gathering and catch up. Was really looking forward to try the Miso Waffles Pancakes and it surely did not disappoint! The pancakes were really fluffly and the sweet miso sauce together with the berries complemented really well together. Definetly is a dessert to share, with 3 slices of pancakes served it was quite filling and it can be just a main by itself. Would definetely be back to try the other mains."
Great Place to Gather,"Was instantly greeted with a yuzu mocktial shot which was really refreshing. Started the meal with the mushroom soup which was very creamy and bold in flavour, the croutons topping also did added a nice texture to the soup. Truffles fries were very generous in serving and was a very good finger food to share while waiting for the mains. As a avid steak lover, i really enjoyed the Pan Seared Steak, which was the chef choice cut that they served. The mash potato too was very creamy and well seasoned, overall a very well balance dish."
Quiet and laid back place for dinner,Nice and causal place for dinner with quite a wide menu. The menu was varied and enjoyed the beef burger and fish tacos. All items were good but there was nothing outstanding that I would be back for.
The Communal Experience,"We were served one free shot each of a sparkling pomelo drink which was refreshing. Had the Har Jeong Gai, Wagyu Burger, and Fish Taco for mains and ended the evening off with Mango-Misu for desserts. Fish tacos were defo the highlights with the crunchy beer batter making a perfect combo with the sweet salsa sauce and flaky dory fish. Staff were really amicable too and ambience is great for meet ups!"
Hidden brunch spot in Joo Chiat,"Did not expect to find such a good brunch place in joo chiat! Their staff were very friendly and the food was good! Would highly recommend their beef pasta and miso pancakes!! fun twist on the normal options, very pleasantly surprised, would come back again!"
Amazing dining experience!,"Amazing dining experience! Staff was really friendly and food was great too! Had fish tacos and truffle fries for sides — the portion was huge! For mains, I shared the spicy scallop aglio olio and wagyu beef burger with my partner. Both of which were amazing! Will definitely come back!"
Delightful Experience,"A wonderful hidden gem located in the Katong/Joo Chiat area! Great selection of menu and friendly staff. For Sides, we ordered the tasty and generous portion of Fish Taco and Truffle Fries, coupled with delicious Spicy Scallop Aglio and the Wagyu Burger! Overall, the food was amazing and we will come back again!"
Great catch up place for brunch!,"A hidden gem hidden in Joo Chiat! Came for brunch with a friend and it didn't disappointed. Staff was really friendly and they gave a really cute welcome drink when we arrived. Atmosphere was comfy for a nice catch up session!

The miso pancake stood out in my opinion! It was a refreshing new taste from regular pancakes and my friend and i definitely savoured every bite of it :)"
"Overall, good value for good (and well-presented) food!","The smell of the café when my friend and me just came in was as sweet as when you just open up a fresh bag of coffee beans, you inhale a long whiff of it and how you wish you can just enjoy this smell forever! Ordered Foie Gras pasta for my main and never regretted! The foie gras they used had a less meaty liver texture and more smooth and buttery which gave a richer taste as compared to any foei gras I have ever tasted before. Most importantly, I can’t believe it is only $20+ for this heavenly good dish! For sides, my friend and I ordered truffle fries which were piping hot, crispy and well-seasoned. One of the best truffle fries in Singapore (selected based on affordability, quality and taste).
Overall, good value for good (and well-presented) food!"
A communal place to have good food!,"Pretty nice place with an extensive brunch and dinner menu, along with a decent selection of beers, wines and other alcohols as well.

Had the Spicy Scallop Aglio, along with a side of truffle fries, while my friend had the Foie Gras Miso Spaghetti.

This is one of my favourite aglio olios as there was not only just scallops but also bacon bits inside the aglio olio itself. Pretty sure I tasted some prawn paste as well which gave the dish’s taste and spice an added layer of punch and texture.

Truffle fries were well seasoned and the portion is pretty huge. It was a great side to have while my friend and I chatted the afternoon away.

Definitely will be back to try their dessert menu as we didn’t have enough stomach space to do so"
Great food and service,"I had a great experience at the Communal Place. I ordered the steak which was a perfectly cooked medium-rare with smooth and creamy mashed potatoes. The accompanying salad was also nice, a plus for me, given that I don't really eat salads. Service was also friendly and smooth!"
Cosy environment with great food,Great ambience - cosy and relatively quiet- and excellent service by the staff. Ordered the Foie Gras Miso Linguine and they also served a welcome drink at the start. Love the texture and creaminess of the Linguine. Will definitely come back to try the other dishes!
Great Experience,"Enjoyed the ambience, it was a quiet and cosy place. Was served with a welcome drink when I first arrived, tasted great! Ordered the Miso Salmon and Osmanthus Sencha. The portions are big and taste good. Enjoyed the combination of vegetables used in the dish."
The Communal Place review,"Ordered the Spicy Scallop Aglio and it looked really spicy, but is not spicy at all! It had fish roe and the scallop had a seared taste. Overall, it was quite good although it was a bit salty. The Lychee Rose tea was good too. Ambience was great and there was not a lot of people there."
Tasty food,"The food is great! The foie gras linguine is very rich in taste. The mango misu is really nice - I liked the ice cream layer inside, and the different ingredients go well together. Also nice ambience and decor. The beer is nice, very refreshing. I felt really welcome here, the employees are nice, and it was cozy under the yellow lights. Very romantic feels"
Nice Ambience,"Cozy ambiance and great food! Ordered the Wagyu burger and Mango-Misu dessert, and I was impressed by the generous portion size and cohesion of the flavours on the plate. Will definitely come again!"
Dinner at The Communal Place,"Ordered the Miso Foie Gras for myself and the Wagyu Beef Burger for my date, as well as a pulled pork taco for sides. The food was amazing and I liked the atmosphere in the restaurant. Homey environment and service was great as well.

There was more on the menu to be tried and I’m looking forward to visiting again. There’s also drinks on the menu for those looking for a drink or two! Highly recommended!"
The communal place,"Great food, especially the truffle fries and foie gra. Pulled pork taco was lovely too! Overall, 1 of the best Cafe I've been to at the east!"
Would recommend,"the miso pasta was really flavourful and the roe made the texture really good too! really liked the meat as well, felt it was cooked just right the pulled pork tacos were also one of the best ive tried, generous amount of meat and the gravy was super good"
Chill Cafe with Great Food!,"Ordered the Foie Gras Miso Pasta and I really liked how the pasta was done al dente. Sauce was really tasty and the miso added a nice sort of depth to the dish without being too overpowering. Got the bouillabaisse as well and could really taste the rich, seafood flavour. I wished they gave another slice of that crisp yet fluffy ciabatta bread - it would’ve been great for mopping up the remainder of the soup. All in all, a great dining experience!"
