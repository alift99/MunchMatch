Awesome breakfast buffet,Thanks to Peppermint for all their work preparing and replenishing the breakfast buffet. Great service of coffee and clean ul!
All the food for buffet dinner was cold and its extremely over priced,"also not suitable if you dont eat seafood, limited choices of chicken, beef and no pork, the staff are not very friendly - mostly only care about collecting money"
Great food!!!,We had our company lunch on Friday 23rd dec. A group of 30 pax. Food was delicious and of high grade and quality. It was crowded but they manage to top up the food on time. Food was piping hot too. Servers attended to our request for hot drinks promptly. Thank You Ms Sonia for assisting us with the complimentary parking coupons. Will be back again! :)
Lovey friendly restaurant in hotel,"Good service. Had breakfast the morning of our arrival and was served swiftly and with great friendliness. Best for breakfast and possibly lunch. Large buffet choice including omelette station, however only one omelette chef which created a slight delay."
Great food selection! Awesome service!,"Had the best buffet here at Peppermint! I tried everything and it was all so delectable. But the seafood is my favorite. All were so fresh and mouthwatering... I just can't get over!! The place was cozy and elegant too. Our reservation went smoothly. Kudos to the staff Sandra for her efficiency.
We'll definitely comeback!"
Lunch Buffet,Food was splendid!Staffs was very attentive and efficient.Shoutout to Lauretta for her very prompt service! Desser varieties was delicious :) Cleaniness of the restaurant top notch! We will come back for sure! Thanks Peppermint!
Great Food! Wonderful Service!,"Had lunch here with my lovely girlfriend...
The place was warm, accommodating, & relaxing.
The food options & spread were more than delightful.

My favourite was the Leng Saap spicy beef oxtail & the lamb dishes.

Moreover, the restaurant service attendant, Sandra, was very cheerful & helpful.

Overall, it was a wonderful dining experience:)"
Buffet breakfast,We had a delicious buffet breakfast as part of our stay - there were so many amazing options! We were served by Lauretta and she was so kind and helpful - she made our experience very enjoyable :)
Thank you!,"Peppermint offers a great variety of breakfast, definitely recommended. Fresh food and great service. All the staff were friendly and attentive.

We stayed here during a personally challenging and difficult time, but everyone was so caring and helpful it really made a difference and helped us cope. We always felt taken care of really well. Thank you very much!

We would especially like to thank our breakfast lady Laurietta: You always made sure we had everything we needed, your breakfasts were delicious. We will never forget you!"
If u want to splurge for breakfast…,"V good breakfast buffet, many varieties, cooked on e spot for some types of food, walk in at $38++, attentive staff, no regrets"
Good variety of cold seafood,"The variety of seafood on ice during dinner is decent. However, the hot food variety isn't as large as other buffets in nearby hotels. Breakfast variety is ok."
Alvin brightens our Sunday lunch!,"The greatest gift one can give to a restaurant or the restaurant manager is to become a regular customer. It would be too cheesy to actually single out someone who made your day however I am going to do just that! Alvin has our interest at heart. We were a 3 adult pax with a 3-month old baby. He was so thoughtful as to give us a table meant for such company! Ample space to park the baby stroller and mummy can sit comfortably right beside the baby in the stroller. Me being an elderly lady- the table was not far from the food spread ( less distance for me to walk to get my food!) Alvin came by at regular intervals to check on us and our comfort. I mean, who would have that kind thoughts and concerned right?
The quality and the spread of food have improved tremendously since we last visited in May. Peppermint has really risen to the top and can compete with the spread at Carousel @Royal Plaza ( another one of my fav restaurant!)
Thank you Alvin and team for making our Sunday lunch a memorable one! We need more staff like you to make your establishment great all over again! Thank you and here's wishing you success in whatever you do. With a character and caliber as yours- YOU ARE ALREADY A STAR! Kudos!
From Ra Laurens"
Great service and beautiful setup,Peppermint restaurant is beautiful and all the staff are incredibly helpful (especially Laurietta!) Definitely recommend
Decent international buffet,"Was at the restaurant for a lunch buffet on a weekday. It has a decent spread of food. I particularly enjoyed the fresh seafood, sashimi and sushi. The variety of desserts offered could be improved."
A lovely experience,"This is my first out of Malaysia trip after so long.

Park Royal collection was a lovely stay.My personal thanks to Mr Melvin Wong at the reception and Mr Ravi, and all the nice staff of Peppermint. I appreciate and love that the meat at the restaurant was muslim friendly.

Everything was just right.
Thank you for being good at what you do.

Sincerely,

"Nice Ambience, Nice food and excellent staff","I will give 4 stars for ambience and food. Varieties of food is good with meat and seafood. But beef can be tough.

However, additional star is accorded because the staff is amazing.

Shyne was exceptional. My daughter had an upset stomach and threw up before she could reach the ladies. On my way back, I asked her for spare surgical masks and seek her assistance to get someone to clean up the mess made. She quickly gave me spare mask and even offered a hot tea with honey for my daughter, which was very thoughtful.

I will definitely come back again."
"A vast selection, but pretty awful Muzak",The starters (especially the lavish choice of sea food) and the desserts were terrific. The hot main dishes perhaps a little less appealing.
Birthday celebration at Peppermint,We booked a table for 6 for dinner. Very good selection of meat and seafood dishes.Nice ambience too. Jess was very friendly and attentive. Would i come back again? Definitely!
"Amazing buffet, great ala carte choices, great décor & ambiance","Amazing buffet spread as well as an extensive a carte selection. I went for the Fish & Chips when I was there for a business lunch meeting with colleagues. The halibut was fresh, batter is crisp yet airy and the chips were delightful."
"Except for Service Crew Jess, no reason to go again. For $100 per person, Hyatt’s halal buffet is better.","Had the buffet dinner on Saturday 30 May. As it was during Ramadan, restaurant was busy which is good.
In general, service was slow and unattentive.
The only person that made the experience bearable was service staff Jess Kee. Jess was attentive, caring and of course, courteous. She works well under pressure and even when the restaurant was packed, she was still polite to the customers. This, I applaud and appreciate.
I think we were at table 6.
I would have Jess in charge of the restaurant at any one time.
Price for the selection is a little steep.
For about $100 per person, it is nothing to rave about.
Dry laksa was fantastic, salmon sashimi was fresh and the beef was good.
Dessert has no standard and peranakan chicken was a disappointment.
Initial timing of food from kitchen to table was good but it got very slow around 7.35pm.
Thank you"
Good service & decent food,The service was good -one of our servers Laurietta was very friendly & pleasant. Will be great if can extend breakfast hours to 11am for guests who’d like to sleep in.
Iftar Buffet At Peppermint,"My best friend treated me to a surprise birthday dinner at your establishment earlier today.

We were shown to our comfortable sofa seats (table #10) and thereafter settled in quickly. Food served was adequate for two person and we ordered via a QR code.

We have to mention that everything was excellent and fresh. We especially LOVED the prawns and durian penget.

One wait staff that I would like to highlight is Carol. She was very friendly, attentive and assisted us to get our ordered items when we mentioned that we have yet to receive them.

We cant thank her enough for going the extra miles during our dinner. Kudos to the entire team at Peppermint for a wonderful service! Thank you once again."
Excellent staff amd decent food,"When we sat down at our table, we were attended to by a wait staff by the name of Suren. As this was our first time dining at Peppermint, he politely and graciously explained how we can order our buffet dishes, beverages and ala carte dishes which are chargeble. Suran was very warm and welcoming with his posture and tone.

Food wise, the Tom Yum Mussles were excellently delicious. The food were served in decent sized portions."
Super Nice Services,Laurietta Is very nice and lovely Lady… super friendly and giving a good vibes in restaurant. Happy to be there. Good food too We had a good time.
Wonderful experience,"Easy ordering via scanning QR code. Service was prompt and attentive.
Quality of food was good and portion size varied- some dishes were smaller (eg chawanmushi, durian pengat) and the bountiful seafood harvest was a large portion of 6 juicy oysters and 4 halves of lobster.
The durian pengat is a must try! Very thick and flavourful.
I loved the dry laksa and kueh pie tee.

An enjoyable evening with a good range of food!"
Restuarant with a lovely urban farm,My family had a wonderful time at the resturant . We enjoyed the food and the staff were very attentive especially Ms Shyne. Thank you very much.
"Excellent buffet with very good service from Mr Deven, the manager and all the staff are attentive with good service.","Very good buffet food with seafood platter and delicious perakan cuisine. Thank you very much. My wife Rowena and I, love the food with excellent service from Mr Deven, the manager, all staff are very attentive with excellent service. Thank you kitchen chef with excellent buffet food, we will come back again."
Great service,My family received great service from Laurietta. Laurietta helped us get gluten-free bread for a member who has dietary restrictions. She was extremely attentive and ensured our needs were met. She went the extra mile by suggesting interesting things to do and helping us take a group photo. The whole staff has great service and made our visit pleasant. Thank you!
Compliment for Jeany Lim,"Overall experience: Poor
Jeany Lim's service: Excellent

My friend and I visit Peppermint quite often and we would like to compliment Jeany Lim for her outstanding service. Her service standards left us satisfied, which we would otherwise have given poor rating for this visit as the younger staff ignored us rather obviously. Seated at Table 5, which was away from the main dining area, I had to go out at least 3 times to get anyone's attention, and my friend had to raise and wave for a longer-than-usual time before a staff from the front door came over instead. Jeany was very hardworking and was really checking up on us, even after many other tables. A lot of repeated orders came to us, and I had to wait for at least 30mins for my salmon sashimi, and Jeany remembered what I was waiting for and helped to remind the staff (who sent repeated orders) many times. Even after that, as she was doing her duties, she would come by and check if we needed/was missing anything. Really impressed by the way she took pride in her tasks. Thank you Jeany for showing exemplary service. Hope this compliment goes to her, and she can be recognised for her great work."
Nice environment and super efficient exec Mr Suresh!,"Food was quite good, especially ayam keluak and beef brisket rendang. But star of the show is Mr Suresh! Ever so attentive and ready to serve even when the place is busy with system outage. Solid work!"
Mixed Feeling,"1. Reservation Officer - Arisa - Able to deliver True Hospitality and True Listening.
2. Room - It was a bit dusty, Aircon Duct and, Water Kettle was not cleaned properly
3. Swimming Pool - Awesome, should try it at night, especially with the small led lights on the pool, makes u feel like swimming with stars.
4. Phone Operator - Excellent service by Saranya (operator) to book us for breakfast spot.
5. Breakfast Buffet at Peppermint - Sunny side, plain omelette, sausage and ham are almost cold when served to us, as they are not cooked ala-minute. While the rest of the food are excellent. The DimSum food merely felt warm. Nevertheless, the juice, tea, coffee are great! Especially the tall young male with colored hair that attended to us, as he is very attentive and also knowledgeable what he serves.
6. Service Staffs at Peppermint - Sarinah and team is very friendly and able to deliver the orders with accuracy."
Family Dinner,"First time there for dinner. The nice ambiance of the hotel and restaurant overlooking the Marina Bay area skyline is breathtaking. Impeccable services that attend to me and my family's needs regularly. One of the staff, Roy, helped me, and that leaves me with a very positive impression."
Peppermint Restaurant,The service was really great! Food was good!!! Very friendly staffs. Thank you! We will come back again!!
Staycation,We had a great and relaxing and lovely time during our staycation. The hotel is very well equipped and dedicated to providing a friendly and comfortable accommodation for us
Birthday Dinner,We went for dinner on 3rd Feb to celebrate our friend’s birthday. Food selection is great and service is impeccable as always. We love the festive desserts for CNY. Food came quickly and the staff were efficient when serving us or clearing the tables. Been here many times and definitely will be back for more.
Peppermint Buffet Lunch,The food is delicious. Overall is good. Recommend to come again next time. Thanks for the serves by Lauretta.
Not bad,"Food was not bad, i should say 7/10. Service wise, was a little slow. They are overwhelmed with the orders & i believe its full house on the weekends. Thus i understand why we had to wait for quite some time for the food to be served to us. Cold items are way quicker to get served to you compared to the hot items. There’s also a duplicate food items that was served to us. For example, i ordered a sashimi. Few minutes later we received. & then later 15mins later, we received sashimi again. Pretty confused but okay like i said maybe they are too busy/overwhelmed. However, the menu that was given to me via email was different than what i got on the table. Some items were not there, not too sure why? And i feel that the price i paid for 1 pax is not worth. Downside about this buffet was, there’s only plain water /coffee or tea for us that is inclusive in the buffet. If you want other drinks like soft drinks, they have it too however it is chargeable at a pretty high price($8 for a can of coke). The steak that i ordered wasn’t consistent. First i received it with onion rings, the second time i ordered, i did not receive any onion rings. The seafood on ice took pretty long to be served. The laksa was good tho! Ordered it twice. I would definitely come back to stay but not too sure if i would come back for the dinner."
Great place and great service,I’m hereby with my family for the second time. Food are fresh and delicious. The service is friendly and attentive especially by Shyne and Suresh. We’ll be back again.
Peppermint Buffet Dinner,"Went for dinner at the newly renovated hotel.
Service staff was very polite in spite of the large crowd .
Very attentive to guest's needs and knowledge of dishes served was good.
Had a very pleasant experience and the scan and deliver method was very fast.
The dishes arrived fast and quality was superb.
Highly recommended"
Appalling food hygiene,"We had breakfast at Peppermint as part of our hotel package. The restaurant is very beautiful with a variety of different spaces (outdoor in an indoor garden feel, resort feel by the windows etc.) you can choose within it.

However, two things marred our experience. One, the layout of the buffet which our elderly parents found confusing. They lost their bearings on several occasions. Two, horrifying food hygiene of the service staff, especially at the cold diary counter. More than one service staff used bare hands to handle the inside of the crockery used to serve food. We informed the manager (in grey suit) of this."
Utterly disappointing plc to dine in. Overly rated,"I came with my family to celebrate their gd academic results . It was our 1st visit and was expecting a 5 star hotel standard food. 1st there was lack of variety in the choices. 2nd the food was not nice at all. (With the exception of 1 or 2 dishes. )Prawns served was really small size. The muscles and scallops too were not of the best grades. Small flesh.Their indian dishes were all vegetarian.We tasted everything that was available in fact. I was baffled when we were served old school biscuits which was labelled as cookie in the menu. It pains to pay for a 5 star meal and rcv a 1 star food. Not worth the money spent.
Had to call the waiter to get the jug filled on all 3 occasions.Informed the philipino waitress and she politely apologised. Appreciate that she took time to listen. Also thanking the male staff who assisted us.
Ambience was perfect though. Very cosy!"
Lunch Buffet,Bought the 1 for 1 buffet lunch. Food is nice but not much varieties.. Staff named Roy gives excellent service. And so are the other staffs. Thanks!
Depleted breakfast experience,"Stayed at the hotel over xmas and had bfast here. A less than 5 star experience:
- barely any service. They won’t ask you if you need water or coffee/tea
- no salt/pepper on the table
- not much variety and everything seems a shadow of what you’d expect from 5 star hotel. Only 3 types of fruits and juices are available for example

Lucky we avoided for lunch and dinner"
Great service,Had breakfast at Peppermint. Standout service by Laurietta who was very friendly and went the extra mile.
Great bar,"Awesome bar, drinks are lovely, quick service, great seating selection, Jess and Matt are awesome servers!"
Wonderful Service,"I came with my friends on 21st Dec, all the staff are friendly and attentive. Special compliments to Damien for being helpful, professional and friendly!"
Awesome Dining Experience & Services,"Well greeted by all the staffs and the food was excellent. Personally love the fresh oyster, the durian dessert, the asian soup and the Xmas ham.

Highly recommended and I would like to make a shoutout to the staff named Roy for his excellent service and arrangement for my friend birthday! Keep up the excellent service! :)"
Great food and service,Great food and service by the team and Lauretta. Recommend to come here for their buffet. Thanks peppermint
Gathering,Highly recommended ..the food is outstanding and services is excellent laurietta kerrin did a great job service us professional from the start till the end . Two thumbs up 👍 👍
Delectable galore,"Breakfast buffet and dinner buffet were great! Shout out to the team running the floor, every one of the staff were helpful and took the effort to listen to request and rendered assistance. I would like the restaurant to consider adding an ""edit"" button for every order placed during the dinner buffet ordered, so that I may ask for requests such as ""no prawn in the seafood on ice"" or ""extra white rice"" for example. Looking forward to dine here again in the near future with my family!"
Not worth,"A very disappointing dinner outing celebrating my daughter birthday.
Ordered the food from the web. Some item came but some never come at all. And those that came is about 20 minutes later after we place order via the web. After complaining than there is abit of improvement.
There is a big crab claw served and even with crusher we are unable to break the shell.
Service wise no spoon or fork after ordering our dessert. Dirty plates are not cleared.
Good variety is very disappointing. We expect same variety as other establishments but …….
To pay $$88 per pax with a limited variety is not worth at all. Recommend not to go till covid 19 is over."
Absolutely hearty breakfast at Peppermint and heartwarming service from Alvin,"My boyfriend and i came for a staycation in the hotel and Peppermint was where we had our breakfast. Upon check-in, we were led to a table with some leftover and dishes from another guest. I had to find another table that’s vacant and clean, and called the waittress to assist us in transferring. The queueing for the food was not bad. However, in the other a la carte buffet we had tried, we just had to sit down and order the food because of the safety measures implementation. This was a brand new experience and it was fun being able to see the food and choose and get them.
Towards the end of breakfast, i ran out of apple juice and Still felt very thirsty. So, i went to the juice counter to ask for two more glasses. When i asked the lady in the counter for juice, she subsequently looked at the time on her watch and looked confused if she should give me or not. She called another server and asked for apple juice, who also looked at her watch, like telling me that the buffet was over and i should just go without the apple juice. She, then told me to wait while she check if there’s still apple juice. After some time, she came back and told me that there’s no more apple juice. However, another server named Alvin came up to me and said that he will get the apple juice to me and kindly asked me where i was seated and told me to sit and relax for a short while. We waited, and after a few minutes, he came with two glasses of apple juice. I salute his effort and kind gesture for the guests. I remembered earlier during the breakfast he also asked if we had everything we needed. He is very passionate in his job and we very much apreciate everything he did for is."
Good Service and Good Food,"The ambience is nice and staffs are attentive, especially staff, Rayne. He has been helpful, friendly and recommended the popular food too. Deserve a star staff award."
"Great experience, as always","Visited Peppermint for dinner with my family. This is my first visit here after the restaurant revamped. The ambience was even better, being more vibrant given the change in theme including the greenery theme at the hotel itself. Food selection and quality are definitely top standard. I would also like to commend Roy who was very attentive to our needs, making sure to clear our tables promptly which is very important to a good dining experience. Also he is very pleasant and welcoming. Enjoyed the chill dinner and will definitely drop by again, and recommend this to my peers."
Wonderful hospitality and ambience,Good friendly staff and good breakfasts options. Special mention Ravi whom greeted us and assisted us with our request. Also to Laurietta as well for assisting to clear our messy table. Will definitely recommend to friends and family as well. Kudos!!
Fabulous dining experience,"Beautiful lush dining space, and commendable service from Zhi An and Lauretta. They were most polite and helpful without intruding personal space. Thanks for going the extra mile!"
Breakfast Buffet,Comfortable and Cozy ambiance with Excellent execution of Covid19 safety measures! A wide variety of food from the buffet spread. Service is excellent with coffee/tea served to tables. Staff were friendly and helpful. Great! Keep it up.
Birthday Buffet,"Lauriette was so kind to offer us peppermint tea once we’re done w our food :) All the staff were attentive, food came on time and table was cleares promptly.

Food itself was delicious, portion sizes were perfect and atmosphere was just perfect. Not a pickle out of place. 10/10 will be back again, worth every cent."
Excellent food and service @ Peppermint,We are impressed with the quality of the buffet served and the excellent service by Mr Roy Neo who was very patient in explaining the way to place orders via the App and looking into our needs. The other waiters & waitresses were polite and attentive. Thanks for the service of the Peppermint crew. Keep it up!
Buffet,"Awesome service and food, especially Rayne, he is extremely friendly and helpful when attending us. Seafood is super fresh too"
Not Fresh,"The seafood/HongKong buffet dinner (Oct2021) was awful.

Chefs overcooked the already poor quality seafood. Lobsters were tough and tasteless, tiny scallops had texture of chicken, crabs with strange after taste, fish overcooked, oysters tiny and flat, blend bread, HK Bolo no pineapple flavor, HK mochi not cooked, ,..

Coffee was nice but we didn't go there for coffee to celebrate a birthday."
Excellent Service by Roy & Shyne at Peppermint,"Food at Peppermint was average at best. But the service by Roy and Shyne were extremely attentive and thoughtful to our needs, checking in every now and then to ensure that our meal was pleasant and enjoyable. Their excellent service attitude, coupled with sincerity and winning eye smiles, showed their dedication to service excellence.

Thank you so much, Roy and Shyne. Both of you are truly awesome!"
So good!!!!,"Used the 1-for-1 dinner voucher from Chope and it was so worth it!!!! The food was amazing and super shiok, and so was the service and ambience of the restaurant. The waiters/waitresses were so attentive, friendly and helpful, and we really truly enjoyed our time here. Would definitely come back again"
Really good service from restaurant supervisor Roy,"Really had a good time celebrating wife’s birthday at this place. Ambience was good, you can hear the birds chipping and nice soothing music if you are sitting outside. Picture of the outside sitting view.
Their supervisor Roy made us feel really welcome, provide exceptional service from catering to food portion that we like and exclude those we seek less of and top it up with a surprise birthday cake at the end of the buffet
Well done Peppermint Resturant!"
Cosy lunch at Peppermint,"Had a cosy lunch with hubby at Peppermint today. Lunch variety was good, with a hong kong theme which suits our palate. The service was impressionable too, with service staff Rayne and another part timer boy who were very attentive and polite. The overall experience was a very pleasant one. Will definitely come back again."
Dinner,"Overall.. I came to eat with my friend for dinner at peppermint on 13 Oct . I would say that overall the food variety is good with the HK theme and wish that the dessert can have more HK varieties. I would say to all the staff a big thank you for their good and attentions to the service which is a plus point.. a shout out to a staff named Roy for being attentive to us with good food recommendation and also let us enjoy a good chat and time at peppermint.. will come back for his service and
good food next month"
Friend Birthday,Had a great buffet dinner for my friend birthday and i was served by a great young guy by the name of rayne. He was attentive and always there to ensure food was in order
From Hong Kong 🇭🇰 with love,"We were delighted to try the Oct specials highlighting some Cantonese cuisines - HK braised Angus beef brisket, Kowloon wall city braised duck, Aberdeen boat noodle and desserts. In addition, the usual seafood, western and Indian food options are also available."
Food is good but service is superb!,Would like especially commend Rayne for his superb service which made the dining experience extraordinary! Food was great but desserts could be improved with more variety.
Enjoyed the buffet again!,"It has been over 3 months since I dined here (it was buffet lunch then) and was back to try the buffet dinner with my friend. As it was my revisit, I would not comment on the ambience as I had already mentioned in my previous review (https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d929185-r794715825-Peppermint-Singapore.html).

It was a weekday evening and surprisingly the restaurant was considered quite packed with diners. But the check-in process was quite prompt (considering the staff needed to check if the diners were fully vaccinated) and staff were efficient and we were led to our table but we requested it to be near the windows so that we could enjoy the outside view which the staff kindly obliged. Kudos to the service crew and the service staff were overall friendly and helpful!

In terms of food wise, the spread was larger than that of the lunch menu. Most of the food were nice and yummy, for example like the seafood platter - crab, shrimp, mini lobster and salmon, they were fresh; the soup of the day was lotus roots with chicken and was flavourful; the grilled chicken and chicken katsu were nicely marinated and cooked to perfection; the stir fried clams and braised meat rice were nice too, among others.

Desserts were good too, the pastries, ice creams, fresh fruits were yummy! They even served cheng tng too, it was nice but was the hot version. So we requested some ice cubes to transform it to the cold version, it was so good! Beverages like coffee and tea were included in the buffet and were served upon manually ordered with staff, unlike all other dishes that were ordered online.

Service wise, as mentioned earlier, it was good generally. But there were cases where servers served us the wrong food (supposedly for the next table) or served more than what we ordered. It was understandable as the restaurant was quite crowded but should not have happened several times.

For the menu, it was good generally as it comprised local, asian and international cuisines. If they could include one or two more local street food like rojak or popiah, or even char kuay teow etc, it would be perfect as some elderly may not fancy so much international but local food!

We did enjoy our dinning here again, just like our previous visit in June 2021. We will surely revisit again soon once the covid19 situation is better controlled!"
Excellent service,Came for our anniversary. Truly enjoyed the service provided by the staff that was frequently attending to our table. His service really put a smile to our faces.
Birthday weekend getaway,We would like to specially commend Alvin the manager who attended to us during the breakfast buffet on the 2nd and the 3rd of October. The members of his team were very attentive and responsive. They were walking about constantly and most importantly made eye contact so that they could attend to guests’ needs. We were pleasantly surprised by the exceptional service and thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience at Peppermint. We especially enjoyed having our delicious coffee in a beautiful and luscious indoor garden setting.
Fantastic service from All the staff,"Despite this tough times, all of thé staff were happy to serve with a smile on their faces. We didn’t get all of their names but a big thank you for making my bday dinner a fantastic one. Special shoutout to Shyne for her welcoming persona and being so good with her product knowledge."
Went peppermint for buffet lunch,"The foods only okay, salmon sashimi and laksa were nice, mostly only so so. Many waitress and waiters but wasn’t attentive, only waitress Jin was super nice and polite, always noticed us when we are calling. Compliment to Jin, thank you to your service, despite the food were so so, I am still happy with this visit."
Anniversary Wedding Lunch Buffet,"The food, venue, staffs, and the services are all excellent. We will come back again. A recommendable place to visit and dine in."
Lunch buffet to celebrate our 20th Wedding Anniversary.,"I would like to say thank u to front desk Felix for welcoming us for lunch, She's very pleasant.

Rayne who served us at our table has an excellent service, he is attentive, polite and takes concern of our feedback on the food.

Thank you to the Manager who attended to us to resolve an issue with the mussels that were served to us. Super service recovery. The best dish is the laksa...simply delicious.

And thank you for the complimentary cake given to us for our Anniversary. Look forward to come again in the near future.

Mr & Mrs Mohamed."
Great service and food.,Great service and food. Thanks to Benjamin for going out of his way and making our breakfast an extra enjoyable experience.
Dinner & breakfast with mediocre service and little attention to details,"We had our dinner at Peppermint, was seated at a corner table outside at the foyer and had to constantly walk over or waved hard to get the staff attention. Alcohol menu is from Portman’s bar and it took a while to get to us, which is just a QR code, so I don’t get why the management doesn’t want the QR code to be on the other side of the standee placed on the table at Peppermint. Once scanned, it auto-filled a table number of the QR code that’s at Portman’s bar which is table 16 (I think), which I paid notice and corrected manually and indicated my Peppermint table number 68, but the table next to me had issue with theirs, very likely if you didn’t notice and presume it’ll work.

Breakfast time, I ordered the Peppermint breakfast while my partner ordered an omelette breakfast. Both of which is exactly the same, as my egg option was an omelette too. Though mine should came with a chicken chipotle which was missing, I waved hard to a lady and conveyed and another lady came over and asked what happened, I then repeat for a third time to another lady who came and asked me. Basically it would have been resolved by passing the missing item on a side plate, which I told waitress Felix that she should leave my food untouched and just pass me the missing item on a side plate, she said she will have to bring it back for them to add on, all these while I didn’t touch my food item just so they know it was like this when it arrive. 10mins later, I was returned with the same items, without the chicken chipotle and was told it’ll take another 5mins and she will pass me later on, which is exactly what I suggested.

Both times, we had to walk over to the counter to sign off the bill too, because we just don’t want to wait further as we’ve been waiting to get their attention. Also, water was conveniently forgotten and we’ve to ask for it almost at the end of our breakfast."
Breakfast buffet,"Service here were fantastic especially Lauretta, ensure that we've enough food drinks before we finish our breakfast. Keep up the good work"
Good service,"Helpful and friendly staff. melodi was helpful she would come and help us clear the table or change our plates when they are filled
Shyne was extremely cheerful and would come to checkup on us making sure everything is good
great service from them"
Lunch Date,"Great ambiemce,Great food n wonderful service. Especially staff Rayne,offer us to try different food."
Good job!,"Nice place with nice food. Commendable service from Rayne, who impressed us with his warmth and efficiency... Keep it up! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼"
1st wonderful time @ peppermint,"The service is fantastic (Shyne, Laurietta, Linh) and attentive, along with the good food.

The seafood items are fresh and desserts are tasty too. The Durian Pengat item is one of the top fav.

Frankly, I would enjoy this setting of food being served to table (ala-carte buffet) than having to pick up food from the stable of selections - as the food servings are mostly individually served and presented nicely.

Ambience is great too!

Highly recommended."
Totally love the service,"Love the garlic butter mussels too. Reyne is a very good staff! Totally love his service. He is responsible, takes initiatives and he loves his job."
Breakfast experience at Peppermint 22 Sep 2021,"Breakfast on 22nd Sep 2021.
Most staff are warm, welcoming and very pleasant. To name a few, Rayne, Laurietta, Umar, Irfan and sweet Chloe. These angels really added sweetness and life to our breakfast experience. However at the front counter, your staff (a woman with name tag Felix) was a little sour. She could work on her attitude in front of the guests.

When we told Chloe that we do not have reservations for a table, Felix literally threw a notepad on the counter -- with an audible bang -- to Chloe. The latter then proceeded to write our details onto the notepad. It was around 7.15 in the morning, and I was shocked speechless at this attitude! My daughter and I felt the same way as we both saw it happen, but we didn't say anything in case it was a misunderstanding. Either way it was an unnecessarily rude act towards Chloe, and affected our morning. I just wonder if she already upset with her colleague Chloe prior to my arrival, or if it was us, or something else.

However, the rest of your staff gave us an overall extremely pleasant experience. Rayne was always very attentive and went the extra mile. He frequently came back to our table to clear dishes, ask if the food was okay, refill drinks and suggested drinks for us to try. Stellar service from him! Chloe was also very sweet as she ushered us into the restaurant. The servers Umar and Irfan were also very funny, warm and cheerful. Laurietta offered us juices which we refused but asked for warm water instead which she pleasantly served us.
Thank you!"
Excellent Service from Roy,"On 18 September 21, our group of 3 females and a 7-year old little girl visited the lovely Peppermint at Parkroyal Marina Bay for the dinner buffet. Unfortunately, our little girl was not feeling well from a bout of car-sickness and threw up midway into our meal. We would like to thank all the staff at Peppermint for their patience and assistance. Of special mention is Roy, who demonstrated exemplary service and went above and beyond in assisting us in various ways, with lemon honey and tea and cleaning up, to help the little girl feel better. It was a lovely birthday celebration and dining experience and kudos to the team at Peppermint!"
1st time visit,Love the atmosphere and excellent service! Would definitely come again. Great experience from booking to dining.
Low quality food.,"Avoid if you can . The laksa has almot some lemak taste, dou poh is hard and overall taste is too salty. -4/10.

Fried hokkien mee, is one of the worst dish, no taste of prawn broth, which is a no secret in food industry that accounts for the taste of this food. - 1.5/10

Chicken soup is jus too salty, no herbal taste. 2/10

Barramudi, quite tasteless and the sweet chiili crab taste sauce taste really strange... I have to eqr with tabasci in irder ti swallow it ... Maybe interesting taste for non locals , sweet sauce and pumkin sauce for fish - 3.5/10

Sushi is so limited. Not really fresh , edible . 4/10

Service -8/10

Food choice 2.5/10 very limited

Food overall taste 3/10. Edible.

Return - def not."
Enjoyable breakfast,"Good restaurant with a decent spread. Great service from Laurietta, Alvin, Felix, Benjamin and Rayne. Thank you for making the breakfast enjoyable!"
Delicious food will make us come back again ...,Nice ambience to dine in. Very spacious and food served is on time. Deevan who served us was very patient and attend to our needs on time. Will return to Peppermint restaurant again
Compliment,"Great service from Benjamin during breakfast. He promptly clears the finished plates and kept the table clean. He even went the extra mile in helping us to get some fruits, and freshly brewed coffee while we were busy with our kids. Deeply appreciated for his value add service. Cheers"
Great service at Peppermint!,"There was not a large variety of choices on their ala carte menu, but what was there was of good quality. However, what really impressed was the service. On both occasions, the staff were watchful and attentive to meeting needs that we didn't even ask for. Alvin (5 sep breakfast) was extremely attentive. And another lady staff (4 sep dinner, I regret I did not catch her name) was so thoughtful in bringing my daughter a bowl of chicken soup when I told her that the prawn noodle soup she ordered was unexpectedly spicy.

Given that most people are there for the buffet which, due to covid, means that the staff are even more overstretched in having to serve requested portions to tables, I am most impressed by the level of service provided."
Very good food at reasonable price,"We had a chance to try their dinner selection of western food. Wagyu shortribs, Angus ribeye and Cilantro spring chicken. Well priced. Breafast buffet was decent. The service was good. Two staff I remember were Laurietta and Melodi. Very courteous and helpful."
Dear me,"If I thought se7venth was bad this was downright awful
Service so slow wait staff oblivious to you. Physically huge menu. Most of it breakfast. Was there at lunch. In the end the choice looked so grim that I decided on just mushroom soup. It was thick stodgy and stone cold
One of party had laksa which looked OK
The Maitre D subtracted the cost the soup and offered salad
Had enough by then...spent ages attempting to interest staff in bringing the bill
Poor"
Peppermint,"Good food, and good service. Very friendly and helpful server Laurietta. Food was great and service was fast"
Nice dinner & breakfast,"Have a al-carte dinner buffet n breakfast at peppermint . Order through QR code . Menu is limited gas compared to the past menu , but able to inform staff to have slight customisation to the serving . Staff are friendly and accommodating."
Enjoyable experience,"Pleasant, Lovely and Satisfied. Family birthday lunch celebration. Menu wasnt exactly extensive but the small portion served makes it friendly and not wasteful. Staff were all friendly and obliging(Loretta was engaging and helpful)"
Bad service in the morning. Literally got ignored,"Summary

Don't get me wrong. The room was great and the concierge is great too. But their dining place should do a total revamp especially on their service
Waited more than half an hour for my order to come with a hungry toddler is not a good experience, especially being a single mom. Having my table half cleared, with crumbs left behind by the previous diners is not a good experience. Being ignored while trying to wave for the servers is not a good experience. Having people telling me to wait, and then never had someone coming back is not a good experience. There's literally no service provided here.
Peppermint is going to be the downfall of this hotel's great service, and I've had so many great experience here but the experience here has left such a bad taste in my mouth, I am not ever going to come back. And that's me, who told everyone I know how great the service had been yesterday, only for this to happen"
Staycation at Park Royal Collection. Dinner and breakfast buffet at the Peppermint Restaurant.,"Check-in was efficient and very friendly. Arissa was excellent. Buffet dinner was good and very well served by Shyne, Roy and Nathan. Very attentive. Similarly breakfast was well served by Laurietta. Will revisit and recommend this place to friends."
