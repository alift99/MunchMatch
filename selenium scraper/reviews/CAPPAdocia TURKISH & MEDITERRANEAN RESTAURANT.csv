Exceptional Hospitality that made the night!,"Booked a large table for my dad's birthday. Out of the car and was immediately attended to already.

Best Turkish food in Singapore,"When l checked in Parkroyal at the Beach Hotel in Singapore and found across the street full of Turkish foods at this area. Luckily l chose Cappadocia after browsing many same Turkish food restaurants, we were so enjoyed every dish including dessert. The waiter was so generous offered us a pot of typical Turkish tea for free. So warm service and treatment. I will come back if l visit Singapore again."
Excellent Moutabal,Walked the street up and down and we decided on this one at the end. Excellent moutabal and the best hummus I've ever had. We will definitely be back! 5 stars!
CAPPADOCIA TURKISH & MEDITERRANEAN RESTAURANT,"What a place to have an authentic Turkish meal. Service was good if a bit slow but the place was full so its was understandable. Meals were fresh, tasty and vast. 5 of us struggled at the end to finish all the dishes.

About a 20 min walk from our hotel next to the Carlton but good to build up an appetite. Street is very colourful as is the restaurant.

Good range of drinks but only a couple of beers so went with the theme. Will go back next time in Singapore in September"
Last night,"We ate here on our last night in Singapore!
The service was excellent along with the food! The restaurant & surrounding area had a lovely atmosphere, we were only sorry that we hadn‚Äôt found this restaurant before, definitely will recommend it & return on our next visit to Singapore!"

Best Mediterranean food in all of Singapore,"Eating at Cappadocia Traditional Turkish Cuisine in Singapore was one of the best experiences of my trip. The restaurant is located in the historic Arab streets not too far from Bugis MRT station.

The food was top notch‚Ä¶ Delicious and savoring fresh to my taste buds. I enjoyed everything from my appetizer to my main course and afternoon tea. The staff was attentive and respectful, they also gave great suggestions on things to try.

If you‚Äôre in Singapore I highly recommended a visit to this establishment."
Delicious authentic food,The food was prepared by authentic Turkish chef and everything tasted so awesome and the drinks were so delicious too and unique. I felt like I was transported to Middle East! And loving the music totally put me in the middle eastern mood and enhanced my experience. Fully enjoyed myself and my family was vegetarian and they too loved the food. I‚Äôm not vegetarian but I like the meats there. The lady host Lynette was so warm and welcoming and made our entire enjoyment even more fun. Lovely staffs that were all fine and prompt in their service. Highly recommended
Very good food,"From the starter to the drink at the end, lovely food after craving this sort of food for days. Can‚Äôt wait to come back"

Best places for eat turkish cuisine.,The best places for eat turkish cuisine on arabic street. The places is comfy and the food its so delicious
"Great ambience and food, but no alcohol served!","As tourists in Singapore, we visited Haji Lane and wanted to soak up the atmosphere and the food of this famous street food junction. Most of the restaurants here make either Turkish or Lebanese food and this restaurant was quite full inspite of not offering any discounts on food, unlike the rest of the restaurants on the street. With that as the indicator, we decide to have dinner here. We were given a table for 2 on the side of road, which is better than sitting inside which was a bit of furnace. We ordered the hummus, lavash and Adana chicken kebab. We also ordered a lemonade mint drink. The food was definitely tasty, the hummus and the lavash were the specialties which didn't disappoint and the adana chicken kebab was charcoal grilled, which added to the smoky taste and was incredible. The prices are a bit pricey for the amount of food that they give, but being the holiday and tourist season, we couldn't complain."
food is awesome!,food was piping hot n freshly delicious. service is awesome. try the mixed grill & fresh bread with hummus
1st time dinner to check out the new place.,"Wonderful Mediterranean food. The mutton, beef and chicken kebabs were nicely marinated. The flavours tasted just right. The vegetables ü•ó were grilled to perfection. My new favourite Turkish crave ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©"

Since we were in a private room, staff kept coming back into the room to ensure we were well taken care of! Very friendly culture!

Overall a place I will certainly return for more!"
Thank you to the Cappadocia Team,"We had a wonderful late lunch and stayed until 7 pm. This only happened because of the staff at Cappadocia were super attentive and made us feel comfortable.

Wonderful service and food.,Good Turkish food and wonderful location at arab Street. Ramzi did a wonderful job at taking care of the patrons. I recommend them.
Delicious food and drinks,"Price reasonable, for the large serving. Can never finish my food here. Drinks also can top up multiple times."
"Great Food, Poor Service, Expensive","A highly rated restaurant amongst many others near Arab Street, we weee disappointed in our experience. The ambience is okay and the staff are out on the streets hustling for customers. The menu is appealing and the food itself - meze and shawarma- were quite tasty. However, the service was very slow and sufficiently inattentive that we were aggravated. The prices seemed high though Singapore is an expensive place for table service. We will choose another restaurant next time we want Middle East/Mediterranean food."
A Taste of Turkiye in Singapore,"Cappadocia has plenty of vegetarian dishes to choose from and its perfect for my family. The meze tabagi provides a great way to sample the various appetizers. The pita and pide bread is freshly baked and has nice chewy texture and smells really good. The baklava is not too sweet and perfect for those who prefer lesser ""siew dai"" sweetness level. Thank you Cappadocia and our host Ramzi for having us."
Tea break and turkish tea,"My friend and I really love the turkish tea in a pot. Moderately sweet with a hint of black tea and apple mint. Paired great with our baklava, that was mildly sweet with a hint of salt in the crust. A perfect simple tea break for a good conversation with friend(s)! Service is not bad too!"
Totally recommend,Good food and very nice people‚Ä¶we really enjoy the food of course we will come again ‚úåÔ∏è The testy kebab was really good üòä Thanks so much

Best Turkish Restaurant Singapore,Really best Turkey restaurant in Singapore the meats very testy and service was amazing hospitalised highly recommended
Disappointing meal,"We booked this restaurant for a birthday celebration but the food was very disappointing. We ordered a mix Mandi with roast chicken and lamb but the dishes served was mix Mandi with kebabs which I dislike. When I question the person who took my order he keep on mention it is the same, there are also chicken and lamb with the kebab and question me what is the problem! The problem is that is not the dishes I ordered! If kebabs and roast chicken and lamb is the same then why there is 2 different dishes on the menu? The kebabs is also overly salty, which we couldn‚Äôt finish due to this. I also ordered a mint tea, when I ask if it comes in cup or pot, the same person who took our order told me is in a cup, then said ‚Äú I can gv you a pot and 2 cups so you can shared‚Äù conveniently dismissed that pot need to pay for extra. I discover that only when the bill arrived.

Overall very bad experience, very dishonest restaurant, never apologised for mistake made."
Really great food and service,"Incredible food, although we were the only people in the restaurant at lunchtime we had beautiful food and service. We shared the meze dip style plate, the bread was awesome, so so fresh! We had the lamb pide which was yum but I enhanced mine with the left over dips! The waiter was so nice he insisted we have coffee and dessert but we were so full, he bought it out anyway, my husband loves Turkish coffee and the rice pudding was awesome and he didn‚Äôt even charge us for these! Great place"
Very good food,Had a fantastic meal at the restaurant. Awesome food and service. Very authentic. Good ambience. Served by very attentive staff . Will definitely return.
Highly Recommended Turkish Food!,"My friend and I ordered a starter with turkish bread and the eggplant tahini dip for dinner. The bread was crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. For mains, we shared a lamb and chicken mandi which was delectable! Its value for money, given the quality of the food and friendly service."
Delicious food,The food is delicious. The portion is huge. It is a little pricey but worth the money. Friendly staff. A good place to chill. We will definitely come and eat here again.
