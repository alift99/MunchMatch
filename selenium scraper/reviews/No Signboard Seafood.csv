Very poor service,"Amazing food
Horrible service

Unless you are the most patient person in the world I wouldn’t suggest this place for you!

Food is fresh and delicious but communication is horrible and service is slow and poor

They sent us rice and veggies before fish and crab.
No one was able to explain the menu properly and the final bill was comparable to a fancy restaurant which doesn’t apply to this place at all!

There is absolutely nothing impressive here apart from fresh food.

I wouldn’t go back or recommend it."
Good hotel in shirdi,"Very very good hotel in shirdi have a roof top swimming pool,good and hygiene room,service is very good, staff is helpful and hotel location also good they have parking in this hotel"
Overpriced for sure,Works out to be 250++ SGD per pax. Would have paid for 5 star hotel buffet at a fraction of the price
Poor chilli prawns,You think that this would be a good restaurant for seafood but apparently not. The Chilli sauce was Bland and watery and it's not very nice
Great variety of food - VG Service,I found this Restaurant founded in 1981- Family environment and enclosed with plants giving the privacy to enjoy a good moment. Ate there a couple of times. Buen ambiente familiar y muy buena comida servida a tiempo
An oldie but still goodie,"Returning after many years this is still a great meal out. Super fresh seafood, great cooking - we had the pepper crab, cereal prawns and squid - and friendly service. Family loved it. Great to be able to travel again and have this kind of experience."
disappointed,so we ordered butter crab and chilli crab and white pepper crab. butter crab was bitter. had a weird taste. chilli crab did not look good but tasted slightly below average. to me it just tasted spicy. white pepper crab was not bad. waitress kept watching us from a distance. only nice thing that was worth eating was the mantou. overall bad. will not come back.
Love it!,Been here several times recently and only for the chilli crab which is excellent. Ive had this dish on several places in Singapore but believe this to be the best. Its certainly not the cheapest but quality of crab and flavours of the sauce in my mind make it great value. Service can be hit and miss at times but generally I have enjoyed my visits to this restaurant.
No billboard and no reason to go,"Visiting Singapore for the first time in many years, my accommodation was just over the road from the ""famous"" No Billboard Restaurant
Well, convenience took precedence over commonsense
I should have left when I saw the prices on the menu - they screamed ""tourist trap"" and so it proved to be - an over-lit place with all the ambience of an abattoir
I ordered lobster which turned to be just OK and,to accompany, mediocre house wine which was the only affordable choice
My own fault for even going into this place - be warned"
Pepper Crab Feast,Ordered chili and white pepper crab. Seemed not as fresh as our other experiences in Singapore and Malaysia of the same dish. Maybe experts can speak to it more. See pictures.
No Signboard seafood,"- Service was disappointing, Food quality was below average for the price and smell of fruits was disgusting + The restaurant was clean and the food was safe to eat as they make it in a kitchen which is visible."
Great White Pepper Crab,Visited this nice place and much enjoyed there great dish - White Pepper Crab Great service and very nice stuff
Chilli Crab.,"Spent the entire day wandering around Little India and Chinatown. Went back to the hotel for a couple of hours rest. Dinner was upon us and we headed out again.
Chose the No Signboard Seafood Restaurant with a bit of trepadition. Simply for the fact that the boss does not eat any sort of seafood. And would have been stuck if these guys served nothing other than seafood. But she'd said that she would go with all of my choices.
Reached the restaurant a bit after 6.45pm and the place was already buzzing. Got seated right away. Were surprised when one of the service staff came by with a trolley and a bag attached to it and asked us to place our bags and valuables in it. Seeing our reaction he explained that with the seats by the road it was a precautionary measure to prevent bags/valuables being snatched by passers by.
The selection was a no brainer. I was here specifically for the chilli crab and asked for it. The staff explained that anything that came to the table would be charged for. The bowl of unshelled peanuts, the bowl of rojak, the gloves everything would be charged for.
Luckily they did have a choice of chicken dishes on the menu. So a chilli chicken and chilli crab it was.
The chilli chicken was ok. The spice was to come from the multitude of chillies in the dish. So if you didn't bite into one of these it was just a plain chicken dish. Flavoursome no doubt.
After a reasonably long wait the chilli crab was served. Noticed that the service staff was offering bibs and gloves to all of the punters ordering the dish. I was going to in with my hands and declined this. One of the most satisfying but most undignified dishes to be eating is a crab dish.
The crab meat was wonderful. Cooked very nicely. Just soft, juicy and you had to work really hard to get it. It took me nearly 35-40 minutes to get through the entire crab on my own. But got there in the end. My hands were, well, full of the sauce. The cutlery was also covered with the sauce.
We'd ordered two sour plum juices to go with our meal. Must say that the juice was a great choice. Not only as far as it was really refreshing but also it was a great accompaniement to the dish. It's tang a good contrast to the rich dish.
I wasn't too keen on the suace that the crab dish came with though. It's supposed to be a chilli crab. It tasted more like a sweet sauce to me. And my wife, after tasting a bit thought that it was like the butter chicken sauce that we get back in Perth.
The sweet bun that came with the crab was light and perfect to sop up the sauce with.
Would not hesitate to say that it is overpriced. And if I'd had the time I'd have probably found some other place that served a better version of this dish. But I will not complain too much about the restaurant or the dish."
Authentic and surprisingly fantastic service,"Returned with my parents after 10 years and they were overjoyed with how delicious it was, authentic chilli crab, fresh seafood and much cheaper than in hong kong. Honey ribs were also great and the staff were very attentive."
Great for a once in a lifetime experience!,"The food was great! But i have to agree with some reviews, it's a bit overpriced! Only thing is you get a chance to eat at the original No Signboard restaurant. You can see the history of the place posted in the wall."
It's OK but not the best,"Have to say that this place is geared and marketed for tourists. Unfortunately there are better ones out there, even in the hawker centres. Not too bad still for its price."
Absolute rip off,"We decided to check out this place since it was one of the recommended places to eat chilli crabs in Singapore. I have eaten chilli crabs in other restaurants in Singapore before. The waitress taking our orders was trying to convince us to order all the more expensive items. We ordered about 1kg of chilli crab for about SGD95. We also ordered beancurd, squid and fried rice. Total bill came close to SGD160. We had to pay for tissue paper! This is unacceptable in a restaurant which charges such exorbitant prices. A cheap and low quality Chinese tea was charged at SGD2 for a small glass! The chilli crabs tasted fine but I had diarrhoea later in the night and my girlfriend had vomiting. It was a massively overpriced meal which ended with food poisoning. I have eaten seafood in various places all over the world throughout the years and this is one of my worst experiences as a whole. It is massively overrated. Never ever go to this place. Really stingy towards customers. It is a total tourist rip off."
Mostly known to tourists,"I had great expectations about trying chili crab at this establishment as recommended by the guidebook. It was not spicy at all, sauce rather sweet, large crab but expensive dinner in a place that looks like a hole in the wall. Waiters spoke Mandarin, poor English. When we sat down we were approached with two appetizers, were not told that they were not complimentary, only ""you take, you take?"". Sure! He also placed two wet naps on the table, and asked same thing ""you want?"". How would one not take wet naps when you must eat with your fingers!!! Needless to say you pay for wet naps and appetizers. I thought that was rather sneaky of them.
When asked several locals later of their opinion of this restaurant, they had to think hard to remember the name, only to reply ""oh yeah, that expensive restaurant!"" It's unfortunate we did not have time to try a good chili crab in Singapore. Next time."
The best black pepper crab,"Eating at No signboard seafood in Geylang is always a joy. I prefer the setting outdoors in a bit of a shabby place and enjoying the best seafood available in Singapore.
My favorite black pepper crab was complemented by garlic prawns, lemon chicken, pork ribs and special fried rice.
Other than a few lime juice, one can’t wish for much more.
Definitely worth the journey."
Super White Pepper Crab,"amazing place, low key, local, cheap & fantastic food! the crab is absolutely to die for food and the continuous change of your beer glass for a new frozen glass will keep your head cool whilst stuffing your tummy."
Business dinner - great choice! Crabs were delish!,"We stopped by here for a business dinner, small group, to get some crabs! It was pricey for sure, even the rice which was a small serve was $40 !! Crazy!

The crabs were very good though, we had two different sorts and they were fresh and tasty! Loved them, and it was a good experience.

The dining is very casual, and nothing fancy. yes the beers are cold, and they keep pouring them into your glass to make you drink more, to order more, but its good!

If you want some crab, get in and check it out! Maybe keep away from the other expensive rice which is over the top!

Yum Yum!"
Big business dinner,"Came in with the office and had a really good dinner. So much food...the calamari and squid were really good, and the staff kept our beers full. Very attentive staff. The highlight of the night was the crab, of course. I prefer the pepper crab over the chili crab, but both were good. Man there was so much food!!"
Yummy white pepper crab,"We order its signature dish, white pepper crab and it’s really yummy. But too many side charges for different items. If you don’t need any snacks placed on the table, better tell the waiter to take it away, otherwise, they will charge you in the bill."
Total rip-off from start to finish !,"Standard Peranakan food served at absurdly high prices. Constantly pestering by staff on commission trying to sell you everything from a few peanuts for $3 a pop to wine and beer which they keep pouring into your glass to insure you reorder as quickly as possible. The whole ordeal left us angry and stressed. Be warned! Plenty of other restaurants with better food, better ambience and for fraction of the price. Awful!"
ripper Crab,"The crab was outstanding. Bloody hot. I will definitely be back. For visitors, be warned it is really outdoor, so very warm. Dress very casual."
"Busy undercover, outdoor restaurant, nice seafood but quite expensive.","We were brought here several years ago by my husband’s brother. It is a busy restaurant, I believe one should book. We didn’t book because we went there very early 5:30pm, we were the first there. When we left, the restaurant was full.
We wanted crab and were recommended white pepper crab. It was very nice, not too saucy, rather hot from white pepper but the taste of crab meat was nice and sweet. We also had lala cooked in garlic, chilli and dried shrimp. That was delicious. We also had wet seafood hor fun. Our white peppered large crab was $117 Sing. Recently we went to another seafood restaurant in Ghim Moh Road, our chilli large crab was $80. So quite a bit more expensive. In saying that, we enjoyed both crabs. Our dinner was nice and the restaurant was buzzing. Make sure you bring lots of tissues. They do offer plastic gloves to wear when you eat crabs... I prefer to use my fingers and give them a good wash when I finished. There is a sink you can use to wash your hands. Just need to ask the waitress.
For tourists, it is easy to catch the MRT to Aljunied train station and when you come out of the train station, go to Lorong 25 Geylang, once you hit Geylang Road, it is diagonally across the road."
Must have white pepper crab!,"This is not a cheap place, but the white pepper crab is delicious. The black pepper and chili pepper are good, just as good as any other place."
We wanted to try mud crabs,"We wanted to try the famous chilli mud crabs while in Singapore and this place was recommended to us by a local. We ordered the chilli mud crab and also white pepper mud crab.

The setting was not at all what I expected, it was laid out like an outdoor food court rather than a restaurant however the pricing was definitely restaurant pricing.

The food was nice and full of flavour however I don't think that it was worth paying $80AUD per crab!

Staff were friendly however could have been more attentive, eg replacing finger bowl of water and offering complimentary serviettes."
A go to place for Chilli crab,"Friends who are living in Singapore took us to their favourite Chili crab restaurant. Its a cab ride to get there and it survives on not having a name. its an open area that accommodates large numbers. We went for lunch and I can assure you sitting back eating the chili crab with a cold beer is the way to spend a few hours when the heat is at its highest. The size and the quality of the crab was very good. We could have had the dish spicier and richer but no complaints. 20 years ago the chili and pepper crabs were best at the East coast precinct but I feel this is a good standard and worth a visit. We had a number of other dishes such as whole fish, prawns and vegetables and all was good.
The meal is not cheap, but I dont think chili crab in Singapore is cheap anywhere."
Holy Crab,"My female family members - the general and my daughters - go crazy for crab. Because they eat it a lot, I guess that makes them kinda Crab experts. Based on some recommendations we ended-up at NO SIGNBOARD GEYLANG and ordered Crab with duck egg, Crab with chilli and Crab black pepper.
Average taste, average portion, average prep - but for an extraordinary (high) price.
Besides the food its maybe good to know that the whole place looks like a Chinese backyard (because of these 12er round tables) somewhere in a Slum (because of the rubbish environment all around)."
Excellent seafood.,"A big fan of their chili crab. Kangkung sambal shrimp paste (belacan) is also a winner. Love the bamboo mussels steamed with vermicelli.

We also ordered a lobster in cheese sauce for the kids. Too bad they overcooked it. Other than that everything is fine.

Prepared to get messy when you eat here, as they do not provide any aprons for you to wear."
Total tourist rip off,"On a recommendation we went to No Signboard for chilli crab. My husband and I are seasoned travellers and we both thought that from the minute we walked in it screamed “Tourist ripoff”. We were given the menu and were stunned to see that a 1kg chilli crab started at $220. We asked the waitress for a smaller one as there was only 2 of us. She said that for 2 persons the price was normally $230 - $260. We would expect to pay those sorts of prices in a top restaurant. We noticed other reviews quoted cheaper prices. My husband asked if this was a tourist price and the waitress just ignored us and walked away. Clearly, there probably is 2 prices - 1 for the locals and 1 for the unsuspecting tourist. We left and had a wonderful Chilli Crab for $48 at Maggies’ Restaurant. Would not recommend."
Good chilly crab & jang ju fried rice,"Very good chilly crab, jang ju fried rice and cereal prawn. You should be cleared with waitress which kind of prawn for the cereal prawn and how much, each time I ate is different prawn, and of course, different price. According to my local friend, tase in No Signboard is better than Jumbo.

Should check the price first or u will be surprised (as to some like me, it’s very expensive)"
OK SEAFOOD BUT EXPENSIVE,Took my friends out and ordered the usual chili crab steam fish etc. Cooking is not bad but very expensive for location and atmosphere. Worth a try...
Don’t visit,"No Signboard Seafood is a totally over rated restaurant on the esplanade in Singapore. The adjacent Hawkers Market is much better food and better value. The food at No Signboard is run of the mill Chinese, nothing special and way overpriced. We even were charged $ 1.60 for a glass of tap water in a plastic glass and $1.60 for the plastic towelettes. This is a new low. There are so many great places in Singapore for terrific Asian food. Definitely give this one a pass."
"Generally Nice food, clean place,","Ate here with a few friends. Had the sweet and sour chicken which was nice, nothing special but nice pieces of chicken. Sweet crispy squid which was again nice. One of the best dishes was probably the most simple was chilli kangkung, really nice taste. We had steamed fish as well which was in soy sauce and ginger which in reality was a bit plain. The place was clean if a bit bland, not a lot of decore. The staff were efficient. Would I eat here again? Possibly but there is a lot of restaurants in Singapore so would most likely try a few more seafood places before I ate back here."
We got charged for napkins. What a joke,"Ok, the crab was pretty good but very expensive. The service is very rudimentary, they do not care if you are enjoying yourself which makes me think this place is trading on its past glory.

What really annoyed us is that they charged us for napkins, wet wipes and the peanuts they placed on the table. As if they were not happy with the hundreds of dollars we had paid for the crabs! Really stingy and mean spirited attitude towards patrons.

We would not bother going back or recommend to others."
NOMAL CRAB,"I've been here a month ago. The restaurant is clean and nice service. I know Singapore is expensive for almost everything but Crab 90$ Sing money for a crab = 1 kg (pepper and crab sth like that) and the taste is not special. I compare to Vietnam, it must be better and cheaper :))) Just try 1 time and enough!"
Service laughable but I love it,"Had another great meal here last night, the white pepper crab and salted chilli bullfrog were the standouts. Service is sometimes impatient, sometimes non-existent and sometimes in your face, but this is half the fun."
Crabs,"We dad white pepper and chili crab. Busy place, but short waiting time. The food was delicious! Good service and valet parking."
Singaporean Experience,"If you wanting to taste some Singapore Chilli Crabs or another variety then you found the place. Since they serve live seafood, I already expected the place to
be pricy. But, it was all worth it as you have a good selection of sides to choose from. Something for the non crab lovers too :-). The Food was great and the Service was top. This restaurant is One of the best in the Geylang area and can be accessed by MRT or SBT within 25 mins from Clark Quay Central."
Chilli crab,"First experience of crab in Singapore. Meaty juicy good sized crab with a great sauce with nice chilli zing. Great views out over a drizzling Fullerton Bay made this a great experience. $125 SD for the crab too much in our opinion. Inside was lively and loud, lots of locals with a slightly upmarket restaurant vibe and feel. I did watch a skinny little waiter who looked only about 15 over stacking a tray and commented to the wife that this looks dangerous. Proved correct when he dropped the lot right next to us. Poor fella!! Did meet a lovely Vietnamese waitress named “Karen” (same as wife).. she didn’t drop anything!! Good place, can dress up a little more and the walk along the water past the Merlion and Fullerton Bay Hotel (especially in the rain) was super nice!!!"
Tourist Foodie Magnet,"This Geylang Road icon was almost filled just after 6pm on a Saturday, so go early if you do not want to wait.

Most of the patrons are Asian tourists. Service is efficient and brisk but somewhat cold. Servings are pretty generous.

Their standard fare like fried garlic vegetables & braised tofu was pretty run-of-the-mill taste wise. Like those from neighborhood stalls.

The seafood dishes do not disappoint: braised sea cucumber is soft yet chewy with a clean bite. The Chilli Crab was fresh & has a sharp spicy note that lingers. Compared to their competitors’ Chilli Crab dishes, theirs is less tomatoey & has more chilli fire power & a tad oilier.

Pity their service is kinda patchy & inconsistent; diners of crabs are only proffered aprons upon request."
Excellent Anniversary Meal,"When you visit Singapore, obviously Chili Crab and Seafood are must and it can be challenging where to go. Previous trip we chose Melben and it was great. No Signboard is a staple and people can complain about pricing, service, etc. Honestly coming from the US, there's nothing that even compares and for the price it's still a great value. We went all out with the favorites: chili crab, white pepper crab, fried rice, cereal prawns, razor clams. It was a feast and very satisfying. Sat outdoors and the service was good, a little pushy at first, but good. The room at the table was perfect, lots of space. True, locals have better spots, but this is one of the go to spots. FYI, don't expect the Orchard Road, MBS type of atmosphere around the restaurant. We are fine with this, because it reminds of local neighborhoods back home, but some people may be turned off or even scared. You are in Singapore, you will be fine with basic street skills :)"
Okay,"We enjoyed the food and the staff was nice, but the quality was not better than at a foodcenter, a place that you can find at every streetcorner. But the prices are 4 times higher, so we won’t go back to NoSignboard."
Didn’t think the signature white pepper crab was that fantastic,Was recommended to try this seafood restaurant. It’s actually in the red light district of Singapore. The place was very busy which is always a good sign . Tried the famous white pepper crab. I think the mix was good but thought if you add a touch of butter to the wok it would bring out the flavour. The drunken fresh prawns was good . We don’t usually get to eat sweet potato leaves so gave that a try but found the dish overdone and too soggy. We had a steamed fish and that was okay .
Worth it!!!,"I was looking to taste some Singapore Chilli Crabs and I found this place a few minutes from the hotel where we were staying. Since they serve live seafood, I already expected the place to be pricy. But, it was all worth it. The Food was great and the Service was fast. This restaurant is One of the best in the Geylang area."
Tense to Over Order,"The several time we visited the No Sign Board Seafood, we over ordered the number of dishes. Maybe the uncertainty of the size of the crap, how it should be prepared, and the best combination of dishes to provide a good meal - all these factors ending up ordering more than we can finish. What’s ever, the restaurant provides good seafood and so so service in view of its over crowded. If you are in Esplanade Park, No Sign Board Seafood is a good choice for your lunch or dinner."
The Chili Crab is to die for!!!!,I love chili crab and have eaten it at a lot of places but the sauce of the chili crab at this resturant is DIVINE. Just pour the sauce over plain rice and enjoy with the crab. I could not stop eating until I was too full to move. They also suggested the Garlic & Cheese Crab. At first I was skeptical but this variation is also finger-licking good! The staff was very attentitve to us and we had such a good meal that we went back the next day for more!
Amazing Chilli Crab.,"We booked the day before and had the most amazing seafood meal here. Yes, it was expensive - $184AUD for the 2 of us, but it was the last meal of a 7 week trip so we decided to splurge. We could have eaten much less - the crab they served us would have done for 4 people - so make sure you stipulate the weight, which we didn't. We had prawns steamed with garlic and greens for starters. Be prepared to get messy and to be charged for everything - as in extra bread and even wipes for your hands. After 5 nights of food halls it was also nice to come to a restaurant. The flavour of the crab and accompanying sauce was delicious...Recommended."
Good food but dishonest practices,"We ordered the Chili crab but were told that the size and type we wanted was not available but a 300 dollar up sell was, when we told them no thanks, they “ found” what we wanted...and by looking at other tables they had lots of them! Hate to be profiled as a rich tourist when we are actually locals!

When we sat down there were peanuts on the table and they handed us bibbs and wet towels....standard practice for chili crab....but upon receiving the bill we were charged for each towel and for the peanuts!

When we complained we were pointed to fine print on the menu which said they were chargeable...but no price was listed. They adjusted the bill but only after a fuss! Reallly disappointing! Back to Jumbo next time!"
Yummy,"Never fail, yummy to the last bite. A bit expensive but worth it since we don't get such food at home. A bit of wait as the place was crowded."
loved it here,"it was our first time in singapore and the first restaurant to try. the neighbourhood is not very flashy so we didn't expect much from the restaurant. we were pleasantly surprised. within the first minute from arrival we were asked to order drinks. and the food was excelent. best broccoli i ever had, and i thougt i didn't like broccoli. we had the salted spicy squid and deep fried baby squid with vegetables with oister sauce and vegetables with garlic. never tried the desert because we were full. we came back for more two days later."
Disappointing and expensive,"I have friends visiting in town. I thought chili crab here should be good. I brought them there. The chili crab doesn’t even taste better than those served in food court, but the price is 3 times more expensive. One jar of ice lemon tea costs 30 dollars. Overall, the food is below average and the price is ridiculous."
A bit disappointed,"Had heard so many good things about this eatery, we were let down from the start. We were group of 8 and had booked a table for 7.30, we arrived on time but were forced to wait at least 25 minutes to be seated. It seemed that Locals who just arrived off the street would be taken straight to free whole tables (enough for 8) ahead of us again and again. When we eventually sat down the service was very good if not a little chaotic. I don’t eat crab, but my friends exclaimed it was very good and so were the prawns, even though I felt that they were so large they must be full of some nasty chemicals or farmed in such way that is really not very natural. I had a mixed vegetable dish and egg fried rice which was also delicious. After our main course servers came round with durian should you wish to partake? Not something us Europeans felt we needed! We did feel though that the meal was very expensive."
Unexpectedly Bad,"Totally disappointing! Our first time back in Singapore in about 20 years and had been anticipating pepper crabs for so long that our first stop had to be for some. Unfortunately, rather than rely on our own sense and the TripAdvisor community we followed the hotel concierge's recommendation and went here.

The food was fine, but uninspiring. They did not have Tiger beer. The waiter was trying to upsell us. The total bill was astronomical and yet they charged for a tiny dish of peanuts they put on the table after we ordered and two small wet napkins to clean our hands. And to top it off, the public bathrooms were unclean. A definite tourist trap. We were extremely unhappy and are still looking for pepper crabs and Tiger beer in an authentic environment."
Chilli crab,"Chilli crab was excellent, service was actually very good and the waitress was helpful and gave us advice on quantity for three of us and which of the three types of crab to go for. We also had the white pepper crab, which was a very close second to the chilli crab, but a lot less messy and the cereal prawns were a real surprise treat. My advice, even with the bib they provide, don’t wear clothes you much care for if u go for the chilli crab! We booked and food came quickly, but meal is expensive, but a must when you visit Singapore"
Yummy !,Best chili Singaporean crab I enjoyed it Bit spicy but recommended Visiting Singapore you should try no signboard seafood restaurant
Chili crabssss,The chili crabs here were very fresh and tasty. The fried vermicelli with crab was also good. The rest of the food is so so. Still a recommended spot when you want to try Singapore food specialty.
Crab chilly is where it stops.. Avoid. Trap.,Went for an early dinner. The place is a tourist trap. No locals come here... Its only to try and sell to tourists. Its expensive. Food is nice but cannot justify the price. Stay away if possible. Bhagwan
Chilli crab,Let me start by saying the chilli crab was delicious.... But that's where it ended. The staff are totally unprofessional rude obnoxious and all in all a disgrace. The youg untrained waiter spilled a full glass of very expensive wine in the main centre dish which was still three quarters full they then would not replace the wine or the food that was inedible. On arrival they put a small cup of peanuts on the table at the end when we got the bill they not only charged us for the peanuts we didn't order they also charged for the bibs so we could eat the crab and 15 per cent gratuity which they would not remove. Totally disgusting experience. GO At YOUR OWN RISK. The 1 star is for the food
A good place to taste Singapore foods,"I am back here every time I travel to Singapore. I like chilly crabs here :) The restaurant is on the main road. It's easy to find. However, it crowded during dining time. You should not come here too late."
Good seafood,A place known for many years and famous for chilli crabs Singapore style. Delicious crab sauce that goes well with toasted or fresh bun. Order at least two crabs to enjoy
Most Famous Seafood Restaurant Won’t Betray your Expectations,"We visited here because they are so famous about their Chili Crab and other seafood. As a result, the taste and quality didn’t betray our expectations. I am personally very impressed their menu – Shrimp and Crawfish are separated, listed in different pages. Some people can’t differentiate those two species family but they do the right job as a professional.
We tried chili crab, crispy cereal crayfish, lobster salad, “Buddha jumping soup” and Malaysian chow main plus desserts. Every single item is quite impressive. Potential difficulty will be language barrier but there must be several servicepersons speak acceptable English. (Well… English is my second language too so I should not point it out, but just for your convenience)"
Good crab! Just be aware of the warnings from the other reviews,"Most of the reviews warn you about the high prices, bad service and being charged for everything including napkins. It's all true. However, in my hunt for chili crabs, the same seemed true for most places, so I figured why not.

I ordered the white pepper crab. It was delicious! Plumb, juicy bits and the sauce was great. They included a side of chili sauce which mixed in well.

Overall, Good crab, just be aware of the other issues with service and the price."
Bad service and uncooked prawns,"Went to the geylang outlet, service was bad and slow, called a few times to order but all was too busy to take our order. Ordered a large portion for chicken but was served with a small portion instead. Ordered prawn but was served uncooked. When we asked the staff about the prawns, they still insisted that it was the organs of the prawn and refuse to acknowledge their negligence until we further insisted that it was uncooked. Will definitely not visit this place again."
Well worth the visit,"I was brought here by my friend who is a local. Geylang is famous for things other than food but he maintains that this is the best of the 3 or 4 that have same name in Singapore.
Never had white pepper crab before, chilli and black pepper many, many times. Got to say the white pepper crab was wonderful. As was everything, staff funny and friendly as well. Great place and great food."
Return costumer,"I had come to ‘No Sign Board’ for several times and the quality of the taste of the food has regressed. We had crispy Baby squids, chili crab, hot plate tofu and champagne chicken/lemon chicken.
Sadly all the taste were blend and this is not what I came for, the squid were sweet taste, they gave us the left over part of the squid. Tofu was tasteless, at the very least they can cook w a fragrance or taste. Indeed it was disappointment and the place had a name but perhaps it’s only name now. That’s the last time. Find better places in Singapore for Chinese Sea Food Restaurant , this is not a place anymore."
Fantastic White Pepper Crab!,If you love eating crab this place is a must! A local friend put me onto it a couple of years ago and every time I visit Singapore I have to eat here. Simple surroundings and quality food with the famous mud crab has made this place an institution! I’ve always been a fan of chilli crab and perhaps even more so the black pepper crab.... but now my favourite is the white pepper crab! Sublime and ridiculously good. And to top it off all the other food I’ve had on the menu is tasty and wonderful.
Finger licking Pepper Crab and Drunk Shrimp,"Tonight with my good friends went there, thought it’s called no signboard, maybe difficult to find. It’s actually recommended by a nice cab driver.
It seems at a residential area. When took off the cab and find so busy there. Weekday Monday night also busy, have more confidence on it.
Start ordering the most famous Pepper Crab, 1.3kg, plus medium size Drunk Shrimp, BBQ Fish, told the waiter we need less bone as with friends from France and Italy.Plus some snacks for Tiger beer, fry Rice, vegetable.
First start with Drunk Shrimp, the waiter showed us the big grass shrimps in a pot with rice wines, jumping around so fresh. Then he took away and start cooking next to our table. Can’t stop the photo taking time, when the water is boiled and he pour all the drunk shrimps together with the wines, in the pot. Looks cruel, but so much expectation. When it’s on the table, the smell of the soups, mamamia. so nice. Like it. Then it comes with fry rice, too early but ok, it’s a Dai Pai Dong style restaurant, can accept that, then they start putting on the vegetables and etc.... hope can improve the steps and prioritise the timing for different dishes will be better and need to improve on that.
Then we have the BBQ fish, it’s very tasty, I think it’s frozen fish, not sure, as it taste fresh too. Wish the spicy source is the best.
Finally our Pepper Crab came, everyone said wow! eating it with hands, everyone licking fingers and keep saying its best it’s the best....
ha ha, this is really good choice.
Bookmarked this place and must come every time when come to Singapore.
Tomorrow will seek for another good place for HaiNan Chicken and Bat Gu Tek! these things you must have when you come to Singapore.
By the way, still need few more words, not much thing to write but have to say something. I think you better go non busy hours, otherwise might not have the chance for the table. Maybe can do advance booking? I am not sure about that. 今晚和我的好朋友一起去了那裡，認為它叫沒招牌餐廳，也許很難找到。它實際上是由一個不錯的出租車司機推薦的。
它似乎在一個住宅區。當下車時，在那裡發現很忙。週一晚的工作日也很忙，對它有更多的信心。
開始訂購最著名的辣椒螃蟹1.3公斤，加上中等大小的醉蝦蝦燒烤魚，告訴服務員，我們需要的骨頭和法國和意大利的朋友一樣少。加些老虎啤酒零食，炒大米，蔬菜。
首先從醉蝦麵開始，服務員向我們展示了帶米酒的鍋裡的大草蝦，跳得很新鮮。然後，他帶走並開始在我們的餐桌旁烹飪。無法停止拍攝照片的時間，當水沸騰時，他將所有醉蝦和酒一起倒入鍋中。看起來很殘酷，但非常期待。當它在桌子上時，湯的氣味，mamamia。太讚了。喜歡它。那就來炒米飯吧，但還好吧，這是一個戴派東風味的餐廳，可以接受，然後他們開始放上蔬菜等......希望可以改善步驟和優先考慮不同菜餚的時間安排做得更好，需要改進。
然後，我們有燒烤魚，它非常好吃，我認為它是凍魚，不確定，因為它的味道也很新鮮。希望辛辣的來源是最好的。
最後我們的辣椒螃蟹來了，大家都說哇！用手吃東西，每個人都舔手指，並不斷說它最好，這是最好的....
哈哈，這真是不錯的選擇。
收藏這個地方，每次來新加坡時都必須來。
明天將為海南雞和蝙蝠隊尋找另一個好地方！你來新加坡時必須具備的這些東西。
順便說一句，仍然需要更多的話，沒有太多的事情要寫，但不得不說。我認為你最好不要忙於工作，否則可能沒有機會。也許可以提前預訂？我不確定這一點。"
Good crab but pricey,"A bit Far for the center, the driver that took us there told us that this restaurant used to be frequent by locals but now prices have rocketed, specially chilly crab. He didn’t recommended it but in any case we went, he was right, it is expensive and we were all tourist, final bill was more than $70 without drinks"
Best Seafood Restaurant in Singapore!,"its not a Fancy Restaurant but the food taste GOOD! I personally chose this place than JUMBO because its Cheaper and Yummier! The Singapore Chilli Crab and Black Pepper Crab is a MUST! it goes really nice with the Buns. don forget to drink Tiger Beer or a Big Coconut Juice Fresh!

Overall Rating 9/10!"
Standards have fallen,"I always make it a point to come here for dinner whenever I'm in Singapore

Our faves are the Crayfish Mee Hoon and the White pepper crabs

This time the mee hoon wasnt as tasty.....and we all had 'hot ears' after the meal,indicating that lots of MSG was used!

Service always good here and valet parking just behind the restaurant (SG$4) are also reasons why I like this place"
Interesting Restaurant: No Jacket Required,"Well this is quite a place. Obviously very popular is is in the Geylang Road so a bit out of the way if you are staying in Orchard area. The food was good. We had the Champagne Chicken which was excellent, the Salted Egg Crab and the Chili Crab. All were very good although I have to admit I think the Chili crab was a bit of a hype. Not as good as I was expecting. Good fun though. we finished the night with a Durian fruit which is should I say an acquired taste. Not for the faint hearted. Good night but probably just ticked a box"
Very good chili crab,"Very late last night we wanted to have some crabs so we went to this restaurant. Excellent chili crab. We ordered some jelly fish and bamboo clam for appetizer. This place also have Durian, a bit expensive compared to others though"
Eating out with family in Singapore,Excellent sea food restaurant in Singapore. We went there to eat their crabs and prawns which were fantastic. The restaurant is well situated and the service is good.
Great crab and seafood,Now a must stop for us when we stay near / at Singapore Marina..Specialty is crab but the rest is very tasty aswell from noodles with seafood to giant shrimp with chili and garlic..hhm
Awesome Seafood in Suburban Singapore,"This place never fails to impress. Tucked out in Suburban Singapore and away from the main tourist traps, this place is a bright, light and open setting with loads of energy from the staff and a great vibe.

The seafood here is fantastic with loads of fresh out of the tank dishes. On this night we enjoyed the Salted Egg Yolk Prawns which were rich and moreish along with the superb Bamboo Clams and excellent Whole Fried Sea Bass. The Chilli Salt Pork Ribs are tender and crisp also.

The staff are friendly and super-efficient and keep the Tiger beer flowing and the food coming.

Make sure you try the peanuts in their shell on offer at the beginning of the meal...they are awesome too."
So Expensive 😳,"I went alone to sample this famous black pepper Crab, but the prices are very high compared to the average of the district, not to say it wasn't anything fancy."
When in Singapore you must try Singapore Crab,"We had something small to eat before coming here.

We only really wanted to try the chilli crab we also ordered fried rice noodles.

The Chilli Crab was nice, sauce a bit on sweet and spicy side. Sweet buns that was additional charge was a bit too sweet could be better a bit plain to counter with the sauce.

Overall satisfied with the experience, crab prices are high per market rate ($80 per kg)

Seating is not indoors, more open with fans."
Delicious but don’t like the environment,Surrounded in a rather dodgy neighbourhood but food is exquisite. Try the white pepper carb or salted egg yoke crabs here super nice. Prefer the ones with the eggs
Warning: level of hygiene questionnable!,"This was our second time at this restaurant. Ambience is nice, busy, staff is more or less friendly, bit forced. Food isn’t anything special in Singaporean standards and value could be better. This is a pricy restaurant.

Most horrible thing was that after the meal we both started feeling bit nauseated, indigestion, was our first thought. Within 1,5 hours we were both vomiting and having severe gastroenteritis that lasted throughout the night. This was one of the bad ones, we’re still recovering from this incident 24 h afterwards.

No matter how the service or food is, but if you end up poisoning your guests it is bad for the business. This was our first stomache bug in Singapore, and we’ve been eating in hawkers and stands quite a lot. Not acceptable."
NOT worth the price,"We showed up at 5pm and were the 2nd people there. There were about 5 staff that unfortunately weren’t too proficient in English. We had been referred to this place by our hotel concierges at the Shangri La. Our experience started with them pointing to a plate of peanuts and a pre-package hand wipe and asking us if we wanted them for $3 and $1. (I’ve never had to pay for a plate of peanuts before, ha!). Long story short, the staff were not friendly at all and any questions we asked seemed to put them out. We ordered the chili crab and the sauce it came in was tasty but the crab itself was not very flavorful. At 80 Singapore dollars I had hoped it would have been better. It was not worth the price at all. Feel free to give it a go if you want to, maybe you’ll have a better experience than we did. I should have trusted Trip Advisor and not the concierge ;)"
Best chilli crab EVVVVEEERRRRR!!!!,"The best chilli crab we have ever had, juicy,succulent, full of flavour and went down well with rice or the buns. Pepper prawns were also amazing with a great peppery and soy flavour which was great on its own. It is best to get your hotel to call up to try book as we went the first time with a good table in the front with good and fast service. The second time on New Year's Eve, we were told no booking was needed however, we were put at the back which was a garage with tables so the ambience was not the same facing the washing up kitchen bit.......nevertheless this is worth the trip just for the food alone!
Service was not the best 2nd time round but it was New Year's Eve and as usual they were busy, however it would help if there was not only 1-2 ladies to take food orders as most staff seemed to serve drinks or clear tables."
Great crab and seafood,"Went to this hidden gem with friends and were not disappointed.
They have an amazing selection of all kinds of seafood and it tastes amazing. We had both the white pepper as well as chilli crab which were really great. For desert we had awesome mangosteen and durian which both were juat as good as they could get.
Especially after having mediocre experiences in various hawker cwnters as well as other restaurants, this was a pleasant surprise despite that it is on the expensive side (somewhat same like every other place in Singapore)"
Terrible ambience waiters not trained and food exorbitantly expensive,"Somebody recommended this place to us and we followed his recommendation. We were totally disappointed with the
Whole experience

The restaurant we went to at marina (esplanade mall) was not clean, the ceiling was stained with black marks. The waitresses were not trained and hardly spoke any English.

The bill was tremendously expensive especially in relation to the quality of food. I had lobster which gad a thick sauce inconsistent with the product, while my wife had crab.

They had no Wi-Fi. The bill came at 380 sing dollars and charged us 2 sing dollars for two towels"
White pepper crab,"Went to this restaurant last week, recommend by a Singaporean. Food was good but very expensive. Staff enerrtaining even if little English was spoken. Highly recommend the signature dish ""white pepper crab"" different taste from the normal Singapore style But delicious"
Chilly Crab is a must,"Visited this modest restaurant on my last day in Singapore and I must say the Chilly crab is flaming good.
If you wanna try local food than this is one dish you shouldn’t miss. The service though is not impressive and the waiters speak very basic English."
Greedy!,"We foolishly went to this restaurant in search of Singapore’s famous chilli crab. Well, the prices were just outrageous. $200 Aus for one crab!! We had chicken wings and rice instead and it still cost a bomb. They also charged for the boiled nuts that they put on the table and the wet wipes that they provided instead of serviettes. That’s just plain greedy. I’m sure the food is good but if you really want an authentic Singapore food experience, try Chinatown, Little India or hawker stalls."
Average food,"My Amsterdam friend & I came here around 10pm, We ordered 3 dishes and 2 glasses of lime juice. it cost S$ 200"
Seafood in Singapore style,"Good seafood in authentic Singapore Chinese style. Service is better than before and seemed more expansive than before, anyway, happy to have good food."
"Great food, like locals do!","This restaurant is primarily attended by locals of Chinese ethnicity. Rarely you will find foreigners. The food is simply amazing. Highly recommend the pepper crab, and the Hong Kong style steamed fish. The fried rice is really good as well."
Not nice service,"Finally reached to the restaurant at Esplanade and start to place order. The lady take order mentioned to me “there is no more Sri Lanka crab”
？？？？

We reached at 7:15pm then no more???

She should have mentioned over the phone when she take a booking!

Very bad service!"
Chilli crab- a must try dish,"Overall the restaurant is nothing fancy, however i really liked their seafood, in specific the spicy crab. It was fresh and amazing. I also had fresh coconut to go with it, which was not the best thing I've had, but lots of people like it. Crabs are expensive, probably because it is a touristic place, but it was worth it."
Nothing fancy but really good!,Brought here by friends. Restaurant not fancy but excellent crab (and bamboo clams and prawns). Very friendly and attentive service. Thoroughly enjoyed the dinner!
Lunch for white pepper Crab,No Signboard seafood Amazing Real Fry White Pepper Crab which is Best when we compare with Jumbo on river front Clarke Quay. We really suspect Jumbo are not real fry. Just dip the Crab into hot water to make the Crab cooked than fry a while with Black Pepper to serve.Only the shell cover with Black pepper.
A Msut to visit!,"Every time me and my family go in Singapore we make sure to be able to visit the best Seafood Restaurant in the city.

Our family love the Chilly Crab as well as the Creal Prawns. I would come back always to have a taste of this 2 exquisite cuisine.."
Worth the visit,"Made a special trip to this restaurant based on ta reviews .
Definitely worth the journey. We had the chilli & the white pepper carb. Both were delicious. Service was courteous and polite. And they have taken notes from ta reviews and placing down small plates and telling us there are Small charges so we are given options ."
Great place wt good food and good service,My husband went bfr and loved the chilli crab. Its very messy to eat but you get a bowl wt water/lemon and a wet wipe ( extra charge). The service was quick and efficient. The portions big. Wine selection not great and overpriced. Feels like you're earing wt the locals which is nice.
Favourite Chilly Crab restaurant of mine,No Signboard has many branches but my favourite is at East Coast Park . I like the Chilly Crab sauce and steam /friend buns cereal prawns . Get ready to get dirty and eat
