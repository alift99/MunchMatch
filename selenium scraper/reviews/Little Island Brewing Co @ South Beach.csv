"Good food and drinks, excellent team","Had dinner here with colleagues after work on a Thursday and had a great time with drinks and tapas. Staff were really friendly, and seemed genuinely happy to serve us, taking time to explain menu items to us, offering to take photos, even recommending nicer angles to take photos from, etc. The food was pretty good as well."
"Great food, great crew","Held a 50+ person event here recently and the team was nothing short of amazing. From providing advice on the food selections to the set up and service, everything was on point. The location is great for a casual big group dinner.

- Food was great: Not just my opinion, but also from the feedback I received from the team. Highlight for me was the dukkah cauliflower, fish and the wagyu beef quesadillas.

- Service was wonderful: We pre-ordered a whole bunch of food that was replenished very promptly. Empty plates/ glasses were cleared quickly so the tables never looked cluttered.

- The crew was friendly and professional: They were very accommodating with the seating, checked in with us regularly on how things were going and managed the general crowd with aplomb.

Thank you Zay, Edison, Chef (sorry didn't get your name) for a lovely time."
Best family night out dinner,"Finally after months of waiting, the whole family were able to sit down for a good family meal! And yes, all wanted to relieve the last good memories we had at this lovely place. As usual, Christine was so sweet to sit us back the same table where we usually sat. Glad to see the familiar faces especially the warmth welcoming staff to the ever friendly Chefs. The carefully curated dishes were wiped out clean before the next dishes been served! Well not that we were very hungry but the execution of every dishes were so perfect especially the Briskets Sandwiches that we’ve to have another round before the ever best Chocolate Lava cake!! I’m not going talk about each dish as like I say, they were all so good (never fail) that every dish is definitely worth trying! And of course no food is complete without having their best stout etc plus the special drink created by Eddy, the bartender/manager. Thanks guys, we really enjoyed every bites without rushing thru the meal. Well, definitely looking forward another round and definitely will want to bring more friends to enjoy with us. Cheers"
Not a great experience.,"Not a great experience.

From being told that they no longer did the sampling rack of beers that I had seen on their social media/website (although to be fair they gave me 2 little sips to try but not the same thing) to being told by the waitress that it was her first day and she had no clue about anything to being unable to drink their recommended cocktail because it was pure sugar it wasn't a place that I would recommend."
Very chill bar,"It’s a decent place with nice enough beers. Didn’t really enjoy the charcuterie - cured meats weren’t that good. We went on Saturday evening and it was really quiet. So if you’re looking for the bar type of atmosphere, this isn’t the place for you. I really enjoyed the service though! There’s a female service staff with short hair who was super efficient and friendly."
"cold beer, cool place",cool place in the middle of the city and at the heart of Chijmes. beer range is ok and tastes good.. have two!
Good selection of craft beer,"Wait staff were friendly although service was slow. Great selection of craft beer and cocktails. Food was mainly deep fried, but sinfully tasty. The Dukkah cauliflower and zucchini fries were great snacks to go with the beer. Wagyu steak was done to just about right tenderness. Pan seared seabass and frog legs were interesting dishes to try."
How is it $15++ whole Beerfest is $3++ ?,"I mean seriously!
How is it $15++ whole Beerfest is $3++ ? It's in a wack old plaza...

And why do you charge for tap water? Save the environment and drink more $15++ beer. Or buy a plastic bottle.

Mixologists maybe, but whatever. No better than anywhere else, but much more expensive.

Plastic bottle indeed."
Overall a nice relaxing place with good beer,"A lot of craft on the draft here with good cocktails. There is also happy hour, the place is centrally located and easy to get to. Staff were actually friendly and helpful towards your needs. We had some food too, the quality was good. Will come back here again!"
Awesome food. Good beer/s. Terrible cocktails.,"Really good food n beer. But cocktails are not good and service at the bar: NOT pleasant. I’ll definitely visit/host there again - fun relaxing atmosphere even if it’s a little stuffy n warm indoors (poor kitchen hands). But I’ll stick to the beers n the quality, yummy grub. Great value - not too many around these days!"
show up early if you want food,"""Dinner"" is short. Go somewhere else if within 4 hours of closing. Not much more to say about this place."
"Cool little bar, great atmosphere, excellent service!",Love this gem of a bar. Great selection of food & beer. Love the atmosphere & excellent service. Great place to hang out with a group of friends.
Great Craft Beer and Food,"This Beer Bar never disappoint for craft beer lover.
Althought the beer mix is no longer available but the selection of Craft beer on tap certainly did not disappoin and the quality of food can be compared directly with high end restaurant

First the beer. If you want to get the full experience, get the beer flight. Consist of 4 craft beer where you can sample the freshest product made by their own brewery in Changi Village.

My highlight is the Black Milk Stout, That Old Black magic stout and the Whitter shade of Pale Ale. We took 2 beer flight totaling 8 beers and everyone is very unique.

The intersting surprise was the Flaming Lips whis is beer infused with Ginger which is like drinking an exotic dessert.

The food is also a great highlight. We order the Gambas al Ajillo, Beef Quesadilla and crispy calamari. All of them are Very good.
The shirmp in Gambas is cooked perfectly and plump, the Quesadilla has the right spices that complement the beer and finally the Crispy Calamari is fried and no greasy feel....Bravo Chef

This is a good place to spend time enjoying food and beer."
"Great atmosphere, food and service","Have made two visits here during the F1 race weekend. Great atmosphere, amazing, original food, friendly and professional service and good wines and beer selection.

The tapas are excellent and uncle one or
Two Spanish dishes but more
Local interpretations. The Gambia al aniline is ver good, but the crispy pork belly is world class. Portions are large. A great evening!"
It’s not often now that you find places that want to charge for tap water,"You would expect if you are paying $15++ for a beer, that they could allow you to drink a glass of tap water without needing to pay. Disappointing."
Great vibe and great food,"Just came in for a quick drink and bar food. The wagyu and raclette burger was astonishingly good - probably one of the nicest burgers I’ve ever had. Attentive and pleasant service, good selection of drinks. Will definitely return next time we are in town."
"The best craft beers, and great food!","The bar is located in a plaza which I thought was odd, but the decor of the bar is fabulous.

We enjoyed a tasting flight of four beers, and we loved them all! All beers are delicious, and we especially liked the golden ale and milk stout.

Food is good here too. We had a burger and a beef sandwich. Both delicious.

Highly recommend if you are after a quiet spot for some good craft beers, and delicious food."
Premium craft beer,"This bar serves a great range of premium craft beer that is locally brewed and not sold elsewhere. The tasting set is a great way to enjoy a variety of beers. The ambience here is pleasant and the staff were friendly. I was impressed with the quality and taste of the 4 beers I tried, the milk stout being my favourite. Like many things in life, you get what you pay for, so premium beer comes at a premium price - $35 for a tasting set + 10% service charge and another 7% for GST. Easiest way to get here is MRT, only 50 metres walk from Esplanade CC3 MRT station."
Delicious beer and fiod,"We stopped here in the early evening keen to try some craft beer. They have a delicious IPA Stars and Bars IPA - both hoppy and malty, with a lingering very pleasant aftertaste. The Black Milk stout was also excellent creamy and tasty. We had been there a while so decided to have some snacks. Fantastic fries, scrumptious beef tapas and the egg plant tapas was also very tasty. Generous sized helpings - that was our meal for the evening. All backed up with excellent service from helpful friendly and knowledgeable staff. A great spot to head to."
Cozy place to catch up with friends over yummy food n drinks,Cozy place to have nice dinner and beer with friends. Serving staff are friendly and helpful. Pity that pork crackling is not in menu anymore. Overall food are yummy!
Lovely staff!,"Attentive and able to meet orders quickly. Forgot about my iced water request but returned after a while with a sincere apology since it was a busy night. Also, bartender was not around but the other drinks were great anyway!"
Great craft beers and delicious food,"We visited Alchemist last night. It has a lovely atmosphere. There is indoor and outdoor seating. The south beach area where it’s located is very nice. We tried the passion fruit beer, and some of the very nice new cocktails they have on the menu. We had the cerviche, zucchini fries and the calamari. Presentation and taste of the food and drinks was amazing. Staff members were very nice and helpful. The mixologist Waka was awesome and gave us some great recommendations and mixed us up some of the tastiest cocktails I’ve ever had. Really enjoyed our evening"
Absolutely excellent - Do not miss this if in Singapore.,"Well, I wasn't expecting that. This place is an absolute gem, and is situated in one of the best locations in Singapore.
The venue is modern, clean, sleek and well appointed with comfortable seating, excellent tables and good music playing (Set at a comfortable background listening level).
The cocktails made by Wakana are unbelievable and are equal to the ones made in the Blue Bar at the Savoy in London, England.
The food matches the quality of the drinks, and is some of the best that I have eaten in Singapore (I live here).
I am not one to be surprised, however I was, and this place deserves a waiting list to enter and a red rope at the door.
The beer on tap is brewed by the venue's sister outlet, The Little Island Brewery, although the venue's couldn't be more dissimilar.
They also stock some of the best Gin, Whisky and spirits that money can buy in Singapore, at a very affordable price, which out trumps Atlas for value for money, minus the high backed leather chairs and smoking jackets.
I hold high praise for the both the chef, the staff and Wakana for one of the best food and drink experience's I have had in a very long time.

I would say to the owner, replicate this exceptional experience at the Little Island Brewery and you will be swimming in diamond dust. Congratulations to the team for beating my expectations, as I am a hard man to please."
Decent craft beer,"This is a good choice if you like craft beer. My first visit was earlier in the month with some colleagues after work. I tried 2 different beers, both of which were local craft beers and both very decent. Only a few of the staff were actually familiar with the products offered though - might be worth investing in some training. That said, I would still be happy to come back here for another visit."
Alchemist South Beach,A nice place to meet early evening for a pre-dinner meeting. No live music which is VERY GOOD! Friendly and helpful staff. A bit on the pricey side.
Quiet place for a nice drink with friends,"The happy hour prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere of the place is suitable for friends to catch up. The restaurant serves up unique menu choices, but be pleasantly surprised by your order."
Nice place for a late afternoon drink,We shared a couple of their beers and draft cocktails. Go for their piNATA colada if u like something sweet.
chill place with good food/drinks,Love the yuzu save the Queen cocktail and other beer infusions were good. The food was tasty.. especially the ceviche and meats. There was live music too so that was a nice treat -Definitely coming back
Inexperienced service staff,"The staff are extremely inexperienced and though this was an advance reservation, there was no specific table blocked, they also did not understand the meaning of serving a whisky on the rocks and said “ on the rocks “ means with ice. Brought us two drinks with ice and finally got it right after a lot of explanation."
Awesome,Awesome beer place. Plenty of tasteful drops to choose from as well as bites if you feel hungry. Great place to hang out. Definitely coming back. Thank you.
Fantastic place,Fantastic place for a get together with friends. Fantastic staff and owners. Best place for a party. Power
Late Night Spot,"Really cool and creative beverage choices, fun outside dining vibe with a surprisingly tasty menu. Check it out."
"Nice place, good beer.","My wife and I enjoyed a couple pints here. Nice place with outdoor seating. Service was good. Didn’t try the food, hydraulics only."
The beer rocks...,"It was meant to be a quiet, easy evening out downtown and the Alchemist Beer Lab offered us just that.

The IPA was crisp and refreshing, easy on the palate and hit just the right notes.

The food range is limited but the cold cuts platter and the duck parfait was top-drawer stuff... did not disappoint at all.

The beef was perfectly cooked and married to a bold pesto garnish... every bite was an expression of gastronomic delight."
Good food and the guys loved the beer!,"We enjoyed a very good evening at the Alchemist, we had the belly pork and the chicken wings to soak up the alcohol, the food was very good.
The guys sampled the beer, they had the 4 small glasses on a tray which they really liked, I tasted the ginger beer which was great. I had a pina colada which was ok a bit watery for my taste."
Great chillout place,"Reasonably good variety of finger foods, choices of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, great bands playing different genre of songs on different evenings from 8pm. Friday is best!"
Is trying too much to be high class,"This restaurant is seated on the first floor in the JW Marriott. Had good reviews and offers a variety of beer - that is what we came for.
The staff was very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately the food arrived almost cold and very late. We both ordered a meat dish - got only 'normal' knifes that did not cut. When asked for meat knifes our waitress answered they did not have any, but she will look for some. Got some proper knifes from the kitchen. They offer different mixes with beer too - they let you try before you order any of them, and I recommend you to do so!
They have great live music until 10pm - very nice when sitting 'outside'.
Unfortunately they do not have their own restroom, so you need to go to one, that can be used by anyone walking through."
"Great Concept, Good Beer, Decent Food","I loved the concept, and thought it would be amazing. But, the reality was a bit less than expected. I did the beer flight. First, four of the 12 beers were unavailable - bummer. Of the four I tried, one was quite bad for my taste buds (All Rose Leads to Rome), one quite good (Dark and Stormy) and the other two in between. None delivered on the “wow” I was hoping for.

For dinner, I had the Falafel, and it was just average.

Maybe I was just getting over jet lag, but overall just an okay experience."
"Interesting beer infusion drinks, a bit pricey food",The drinks were really tasty and there was a lot to choose from. The staff were helpful as they let us taste different drinks before ordering a full glass. The food there was good but a bit pricey and the portions were a bit small.
Great craft Beer - better during Happy Hour,"The Alchemist Beer Lab offers a good variety of Craft Beer on tap along with other alcoholic beverages but clearly a focus on beer.

They have a excellent selection and my favorite is their IPA which they said is the best seller. It was great. The happy hour prices are also good 30% off normal price and available Monday to Wednesday if memory service me right.

I didn't have any food so sadly cannot comment, but the crowd is good - was always full when i visited with working people aged 25-45.

I could make this a drinking hole if i lived in Singapore."
"There to celebrate my sis birthday, and it was pleasantly good!","Was totally disappointed with Lady M at South Beach Avenue, as such we decided to head over to alchemist beer lab.

We were pleasantly surprise
1) The staff is friendly and patient with my family during the ordering of food, as we have elderly person in the midst, and they are unfamiliar with the menu

2) The staff also take time to clarify the dishes if we are unsure.

3) They were able to provide candles for the celebration of my Sister birthday (they we attentive and even off the fan, while candle is lighted up, and immediately on the fan again, after she blew the candle)

4) The staff explain clearly the operation hour and the timing for live band.

5) The staff allows a random singer to sing songs as a dedication for my Sister birthday. (Mind you his voice is good and dedicated a total of 3 songs). PS. I not sure if the Alchemist Beer Bar knows this random singer. :)

6) The ambience is fantastic and we love outdoor seats under a tentage

7) Personally I enjoy the tea and various snacks we order, and it was enjoyable with the good music and ambience.

* The live band ends at 11pm, but the place closes at 2am."
"Great food, beer & service","BEER: a great selections of beers, ales & flavoured beers with a good choice

FOOD: nice selection of small plates available - the fish was absolutely delicious

PRICES: quite pricey but its a quirky different sort of experience and worth a try

LOCATION: not the easiest places to find if you come out the wrong entrance of the station but the setting is nice and

Worth a visit if you are after a different sort of food/drink expereince"
Interesting mix of drinks,Came in here for drinks rather than food. Service was good although the beers were fairly expensive and I struggled to differentiate between their straight-forward beers and those which were their own special mix.
"Great Beer selection, also some rather peculiar ones, very welcoming service!","We had the pleasure of visiting the Alcemist at the end of 2017, and found their selection of Beers to be absolutely great, the snack dishes to complement really good, and their service really friendly, attentive and welcoming!

They have a wide selection of Beers, also several flavour infused ones which brings the drinking sensation close to ciders. Different, but good!

The Orange smoked duck, chicken wings and potato wedges were super good.

Recommendable!!"
Very good,"Very nice spot, fantastic beers, warm atmosphere. The service realy good and the staff very friendly. We had a very nice time there. Prices expencive."
Evening Cocktail,"Having an interesting infused beer with my daughter, since we are off schedule our first day in Singapore. Unique choices of beers and ordered a very smoky whiskey to sip. Food looks great, but the kitchen had closed by the time we arrived at almost midnight. Will go back for food next time."
What a lovely dinner,"This was a great place. I had the ceviche and my husband had the fish and chips The food was great. The beer was also great and they had wine and cider as well. It wasn't clear from the website that they had anything besides beer so I was super happy when we found out that they had other drinks as well. We sat ""outside"". It was still inside but it was outside the restaurant. It was pleasant and the staff was good."
"Amazing food, and good beer too","We came for a beer and sampled a few. we then ate and the food was fantastic. I came with two French colleagues who are gastronomes and they were raving about the foord. I had the wagu beef with Fois Gras and Truffle, they had the duck confit. all were fantastic. Thoroughly recommended"
Are you mad?,Your door sign said you open from Sunday 4pm to 1am. (See attached image) We walked from bras Basah to you a good 15 mins. Hoping to have ice cold beer. Accordingly Your establishment was TripAdvisor recommended. And couple more custoner were also outside wondering. Please take care of those tiny details.
Possibly dinner,Sorry we took some trouble to find this place on a hot humid evening. Very attentive staff but the noise levels were awful. Then the music started. We left. There were quite a few couples together staring at the walls. Conversation impossible.
Good place to relax,The food and drinks were great. I heartily recommend this place. Very creative beer infusions and a great atmosphere!
Birthday party,Had my birthday dinner here. A very good place to relax with a very sweet and chilling atmosphere. Good food and good infusions of drinks!
Check Alchemist out! GREAT!,"Amazing food, good infusion beer and a lovely place to catch up with friends! Would highly recommend the wagyu short ribs and pork belly kimchi."
Great place to wind down on the weekend,Amazing food and although I didn't try the drinks ~ seems to be the real deal! Friends were fans of the fruit infusions and would definitely be getting something to drink in the near future
Awesome food & super friendly staff,"This place is awesome. Just after entering the place there was a guy called Brennan (OPS Manager as he told me while chatting a little bit) who guided us to a cool and cozy place to have dinner. As soon as we looked at the menue he was there to give us some advice on all the different sorts of beer they were selling (btw. This place only offers homebrewed beer). We we're even invited to taste some of their infusions (beer mixed with fruits and spices), special thanks to Trerick at this point! To sum up: we highly recommend this place for a quick dinner and a tasty beer!"
Excellent food. Great Infusion Beers & Splendid Service,"Happened to pop by whilst moseying around South Beach area. Surprisingly modern European Food, crafted Beer was tastefully done. Kudus to the staff for providing great service as well.Highly recommend to friends"
"Lovely ambience, amazing food and service",Held my birthday party at Alchemist- the staff were very accommodating and helpful and the food and ambience is amazing! They really worked hard to give my guests and I a special and memorable night
SIMPLY AMAZING!!,"SIMPLY AMAZING!!

If the combination of amazing food, exquisite beers, personalised service, friendly staffs, WOW-decorated place, superb location and enjoyable ambience does not bag 5* rating, I do not know what else does!

Alchemist Beer Place is just simply an amazing place to be! All of those mentioned above, accompanied by good friends, good chat, good laughters, it simply creates an remarkable experience!

Thumbs up to Brennan, who offered nothing but an A-class service to our group, we really couldn't ask for more! Thank you!!

In return for this amazing experience, I would definitely keep recommending this fabulous place and keep coming back!

Keep it up! See you around!!"
Great outdoor ambiance,"This is one of the only places with outdoor seating on that whole strip, and it’s sheltered so no need to worry about the rain. They had a live band playing too. We went there with a couple friends for dinner, service was fine and their food was really good. Although the Wagyu beef was way too salty, the rest of the appetizers and mains were delicious. They have a great choice of beers and an eclectic mix of flavored ciders on tap. A good hangout spot for a Saturday night."
Wonderful food and nice tasty beer,"Its a nice place for gathering of friends & family with accessible location, I really love the pork belly, lamb and the fries. The in-house beers is of a different level for the taste buds as it carries different flavor and personally I love the dark ones. The manager and staffs are very friendly bunch. Cheers to them !!!"
Great for a night out w friends,"Had a girls night out on Friday. Good food, especially the Pork belly. Never thought such dish would be so well prepared in a western setting. Very crispy skin and unique sauce. The lychee infused beer feels slightly stronger than the normal beer with a pleasant after taste of Lychee. I loved the creme brûlée, rich and creamy. We were served by Brennan who gave a good recommendation on beers and dishes. Last but not least, the duck confit is also very well cooked.
Price is reasonable for the location and they can help to split the bill."
A great place to chill out with friends,"A dinner night-out with 5 of my friends turned out to be a delightful one. Our chit-chat was made merry with good food and fruity beers. We enjoyed the beef, lamb and pork belly dishes. We loved the fruity beers Turkish Delight and O My Darling. Thanks to Brennan who attended to us, making wonderful recommendations."
First Time Alchemist,"Been wanting to try this pub/restaurant for a while after walking past it a few times. Decided to give it a go mainly to sample some of the microbrewery beers, but was pleasantly surprised by how good the burger was (more of a pulled pork version with portobello mushroom). Definitely recommended. The ambience of the restaurant is certainly attractive with the various beer infusion towers visible. I prefer more of the hoppy IPA beers, so didn't really go for the fruity influenced beers. Did have their Pale Ale (SPA), which was good. The Obama brew was certainly unique and was a plethora of strong, robust flavors - definitely worth a glass. Was expecting more flavor impact from the Marla Maple, as it was advertised as having a smoky oak and whisky infusion, but didn't get those influences to materialize much. Our small group was well taken care of by Brennan, who provided good recommendations. Would definitely go back. Thanks."
Interesting place! Friendly staff,"We were told about this place so came here for a light meal after a long flight. Not overly hungry but just wanted something light before bed. We had a selection off the ""light meals"" section and was quite tasty. The beer however we thought was really quite expensive for the size glass, probably OK during happy hour. We thought it was happy hour, but were informed to read the small print. No happy hour on Friday nights or weekends but appeared to be every night."
Disappointing beer,We just like to check out the place but turn out to be so so experience. Introduction of their favourite beers are over-confident and end up the beer was not COLD enough.
"Tasty Rotations, Affordable Food, and Friendly Staff","I came to alchemist after a 6-month dry spell of craft beers. This, of course, is why I ordered the ""free flow"" happy hour: S$48 for two hours of tastings.

7 varieties are brewed in-house which you can try alone, or, 3-day infused with flavors like maple, lychee, kefir lime leaf, etc. (which rotate). They have a large variety from dark stouts to refreshing ciders.

On top of that, the staff was wonderful. Happy to make recommendations, and even providing a complimentary snack.

My only recommendation is to extend the happy hour from 2 hours to 3 hours. The ""tastings"" are actually glasses. So in order to get your money's worth, you need to drink 5 in 2-hours. Kind of makes you feel rushed.

Thanks for everything! I look forward to getting my ""craft"" fix again while I'm in Singapore!"
Interesting beer ! Great ambience,"Went on a Monday night, not crowded. They have interesting innovative infused beer - think guava, lychee, roses, citra etc. Best part is they give you small shot glasses to try before you decide on what you want. Around $15 per glass. The staff was attentive and service was good.

Food on the menu - duck confit, duck fat fries, fish and chips, lamb rump, wagyu rump, chicken wings, brisket burgers etc. Must try the brisket burgers - really good! A good place to chill out with friends after work. Exit F of Explanade mrt. It's just right there. There is both outdoor and indoor dining."
Not that great,"If the beers were $15 each. Luckily I was able to try several beers in little shot glasses, before ordering a whole glass (Ale Yeah SPA). I didn't care for any of the infused beer concoctions, though they sounded delicious. I also ordered pork belly, which was good, and enough food for a light meal for one person, but at $15, I expected maybe a couple other sides to round it out. In summary, the food is ok, the beer less so, and it's all overpriced."
"Great atmosphere, interesting craft beers, great food.",We held a client networking event at the Alchemist. Staff were extremely attentive and ensured food and drinks were readily available. The variety of beers on offer was a key attraction and selection of canapes were delicious. THis would be a great place to go to sit back and enjoy an afternoon trying some interesting beer flavour combinations. Excellent live music in an alfresco environment.
Great Beer and good value some of the time,"Called in late one evening after a meal elsewhere. The staff were very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable and let us try before we chose our beers. Beers were innovative and very tasty with a good variety. Prices are relatively high in the late evening - I wish we had been there during happy hour and had the opportunity to try more!"
Great new concept!,"My fiancée, and I just stopped here, because it looked very different! We ordered the 4 sampler beers. Great opportunity to try 4 of them. All were very different, but great. The most that I liked were the rose beer, and the guava. The other two were more strong for my taste. I definitely recommend you stop, and try this place."
Great beer spot,My fiancé and I met a friend of ours here after she got off work(she lives in Singapore and we were just visiting on vacation). A very nice woman and Brennan took care of us for the night and we're incredibly helpful with us for both beer choices and food options. We were never rushed and the beer here was incredible. The food was also very good. My fiancé and I ended up coming back to this bar later in the night as we enjoyed the beer so much. Cheers to all!
Great find,"ext to JW South Beach. A nice visit. Stopped in at mid week to see the place. Nice set up. Various beers, tries the Singapore Pale Ale which is good choice and samples few other on which was based on sea weed. Skeptical it was delicious choice. Serves food and great for groups or hangout on patio seating."
Great food and good beer,Excellent fish and chips and dessert and very good beer. Service was great and very friendly. Highly recommended
Good service,Held a client drinks function here. The Tomahawk steaks and duck fat chips were great; service good; nice beer. Will be back.
Interesting Beer,"The place was located within walking distance from the MRT station. The outlet was opened by the people behind Little Island Brewing Co. There was both outdoor alfresco dining and indoor aircon dining area. Selected indoor as it was quite a humid night. The outlet was well known for its beer infusion towers, so we decided to have a drink each since we just had our dinner. From the row of beer infusion towers, we could try the beers first before ordering. Since we were both female, we were recommended sweet and light beers which agreed with us.

Citra Sea Mead (S$15++)
Light with a slight salty taste.

All Rose Leads To Rome (S$15++)
Mead + Strawberry + Rose hip + Mint Leaf
5.5% alcohol
Fruity sweet in taste

Not sure if the drinks were too sweet as we kept getting tiny flies around even when we were sitting in the indoor aircon area. The place was quiet and not crowded."
Marshmallow Beer!,"We went for a family meal and drinks at the Alchemist Beer Lab. This is such a cool wee spot. Be sure to sample the infused beers to find one that suits your palette. I really enjoyed the toasted marshmallow infused Beer! Very unique and delicious. The food was also excellent. Quality ingredients, beautifully presented dishes and reasonably priced. Friendly and very helpful staff. This was a memorable evening!"
The steak..... The steak...,"Honestly, the steak was so good, I'm suprised Japan don't invade Singapore again to get their hands on it.. Amazing!"
Great Place to Relax After a Long Flight,"Just flew in from Beijing and found this place close by my hotel in South Beach. Stopped in and Brennan took great care to find out what I liked in a beer then provided the perfect recommendation! It was the ""Old Black Magic"" stout which I'd suggest to anyone who enjoys a good nitro stout. They have a great selection of beers and beer infusions but also stock wine and liquor. Price was comparable to what you'd expect in Singapore but the lunch selections were well above average. Definitely a spot to check out if your in the area."
Richard,Just found this bar after a long day visiting sites in Singapore. Other bars were finishing serving food but the manager accommodated us and served great tapas and excellent beer. You need to try it😄
Lunchtime,A great find! Staff so attentive and knowledge about the extensive drinks menu. I had the honey beer. Delicious!
Exceptionally different approach - first of its kind in Singapore,"Really enjoyed this place for its unique approach. Enough to go twice during our visit. Beer (Little Island Brewing Company, LIBC) and food (composed by the in-house chef) choices were of the highest quality and ideally paired. Worth the trip when in South Beach, central downtown."
Trendy craft beer,"Great choice of craft beers. Very trendy. Excellent host, Brennan. Highly recommended it. Only went for the beers so didn't have the lunch but the menu looks awesome. Will definitely be back."
Great find!!,They had an interesting mix of craft beers on tap with some different infusion concepts. Enjoyed a tasting set at their recommendation. Food was delicious - wings and the lamb rump were standouts. Will defiantly return!
What a find!!,"While staying at the JW(which is a great hotel) I stumbled across Alchemist. The beer selection drew me in. A wide range of microbrews!!! Upon walking in, I realized this is not just a place for a beer. I saw they had ""fish and chips"" with sea bass. I had to try it. The batter was perfectly crisp and the fish was fresh and tasty. The fried potato slices were also great but the salad was amazing. Yes, for the first time in my life I had salad with fish and chips. Fresh greens with a very light dressing. This place is awesome and is a top reason why I will stay by the JW again. Friendly, clean, fresh and microbrews. Nicely done!"
"Exceptional, service, atmosphere, beers and food!","we visited the Alchemist on a Wednesday night. Brennan looked after us for the evening and providided us with with amazing, personal service. We were also given great assistance by an English barman while we sampled the beers on offer. Both Brennan and the barman were incredibly helpful with recommendations based on what we said we liked. We settled on a glass each of one of the infusion beers ""All Rose Lead to Rome"" which was a tasty fermented mead delicately infused with with rose, which was very light and and refreshing. We shared three plates of tapas, being the salmon croquettes, duck fat fries and lamb rack, everything was cooked to perfection and the flavours were nicely balanced. The three plates were just the right amount for two people to share for an evening meal. The atmosphere here was great, as well as the lighting and look of the venue. Prices were very reasonable for the quality of the drinks, food and service we received. Would definitely return, and thank you to the team at tThe Alchemist for a lovely evening!"
Fantastic and unusual selection of Beers,"... and the food's not bad either! Small tapas style food, freshly made and served hot. Pairs well with the beers. Not being a beer drinker, I tried a honey mead and loved it. Very fragrant and refreshing. Not overly sweet but enjoyable. Was Chinese New Year so not many people about but great relaxing place to visit.
Brewer was on hand to assist with our selections and all the serving staff were also very knowledgeable. Highly recommend."
Surpisingly good personalised service for an atas place in an high end location,"First time visiting the Alchemist Beer Lab, really surprised when I was greeted by the server who invited me to taste their in-house infused beers for free. I was used to this foc ""beer tasting"" in other countries...so I appreciate it. how else wld you choose a beer from so many options eh?
The beers...they had some interesting flavours and names. eventually went for nervous breakdown because it had the highest alc %! haha I wld recommend the infusion with stout and marshmallow too...
Afterwards ordered the pork jowl for dinner. great recommendation by the manager, this was the special of the evening so hope you get to try it again if you go because it wasnt on the menu!
The overall place was not crowded, which is not a bad thing and probably thats why I saw many couples there on dates (I'm guessing). There is alfresco area with live DJ entertainment and also indoor seating with open kitchen and bar.
Very very good experience, hope to go back again for the ambience and their award-winning beers! And I know I can trust their service. :)"
Not your usual pub grub,"The folks at Alchemist Beer Lab do pay special attention to ensure that you're having a good time and that you always have food and drink in front of you. There is a wide selection of beers with interesting names, which helps you recall..especially after you've had a few and you're still going strong! Brennan is the absolute host and will recommend the best foods to go with your beers!"
Good selection of beers,"Nice ambience, great to sit outside. Love the selection of infused beers here, spend a nice Friday night with friends."
"Great food, and beer of course!","The alchemist beer lab offers a wide variety of artisanal beers and is right on trend. It's great that they offer you a taste before you decide which beer to take. But the most surprising thing was the food. It was really excellent, both in presentation as well as taste."
"World-class service, food, and crew","We did a corporate event yesterday at the Alchemist Beer Lab. Brennan did a fantastic job with his team in looking after our guests right from the planning down to the end of the event. Food was amazing, place is cozy and nice, couldn't ask for a better place to host our summit party!"
Infused Beer,"We happened upon this on our first night in Singapore. My husband had ""run"" out to the pharmacy and was gone for nearly 90 minutes (he got lost) so when he finally got back we were starving and this was literally next door to our hotel.The food and beer were both very good although a bit on the pricey side (not uncommon in Singapore)."
Awesome venue with great food and beer!,"We had a corporate party at the venue for 90 pax and everything ran smoothly without a hitch. The food was very good, substantial and delicious - our guests were well fed. The beer and ciders were awesome and every one of our guests loved it! Even ladies who did not usually drink beer found one that suited their palette. We had an awesome party, everyone was having such a great time. Thank you Brennan for your assistance and lovely hospitality to make the party a success!"
Farewell Party,"We had a farewell party held at Alchemist Beer Lab. Ambience is great and everyone enjoyed themselves with the tapas and drinks! Their staff were very friendly and helpful. Despite the last min booking at Alchemist Beer Lab, they are able to accommodate with our request and provide an excellent services, a BIG THANK YOU to Brennan and his team for the evening. We had a great fun there! =)"
A Fun Place for Beer Lovers,"If you like beer, they offer free tastes of their various offerings. I tasted Sister Golden Ale (quite good) and That Old Black Magic stout (quite good). The food was also good for a group looking to share small plates. The server was quite helpful and friendly."
Perfect date,"Brought my boyfriend here for his birthday, he loved it! We dined al fresco, and the decor was very classy and romantic. The beer selection was wonderful (highly recommend the All Rose Leads to Rome) and trying all the different types was super interesting. The service was perfect - the staff were friendly and genuinely happy to give us samples and explain more about the beers and dishes. Our main server Patrick was very thoughtful and checked on us a few times, which I appreciate. The food was delicious, especially the ceviche, wagyu beef tortilla and truffle croquettes.
The experience was very worth it, and I would definitely go again!"
Best Party Venue,"We had a private party at Achemist Beer Lab recently. Everything was just perfect! The tapas served at the party was delicious and the drinks great! Staff were efficient , friendly and helpful. Special thanks to the manager , Brennan, for accommodating our requests and coordinating everything smoothly . Everything turned out as we had planned and desired. The DJ Malcolm X was also excellent- playing great music throughout the night, both at dinner and during the dancing. Fabulous place for a party!"
