Authentic Italian cuisine,Very authentic Italian food. Genuine and kind service. The place is quiet and very cosy. The chef was very kind. I wish the entire crew a wonderful new year!
Great overall experience!,"We moved into the area 6 weeks ago and kept saying that we must try out Al Borgo. We finally went last Friday and thoroughly enjoyed our evening. Firstly, the staff are extremely friendly and attentive. The food is super tasty! My son loved his lasagne and asked if he could go back the next day to have it again! A small, authentic Italian experience. We'll definitely be back to our new favourite local!"
“Wonderful place with wonderful pizza!”,"“Friendly staff and probably the best cheese pizza I’ve had!”,We had a big party for my birthday thanks for your Service"
GREAT FOOD - ATROCIOUS SERVICE,"Table booked for 8 pm. The Server was in a great hurry to take our Order. Hardly had we sat down and she asked us three times if we were ready to order. After ordering the Appetizers, she was in a rush to take the order for Wine, when we told her that we had yet to decide. Finally, the Italian Manager/Owner came and served the Wine. Pleasant host. We were told that last order was at 9,15 pm. At 8,50 pm another Server asked if we wanted anything more. After ordering another Pizza again, we assumed that Desserts would be served even after the last order time. Quite normal in Singapore to keep Desserts options open after Last order timings. At 9,10 pm we asked for the Dessert Menu and the same Server said that the kitchen was closed. They could offer only Tirramisu and another item. But, nothing else - KITCHEN IS CLOSED. Pathetic behavior exhibited by uncaring staff of another nice and cosy ristotante. Unfortunate!"
I guess you figured only take out? Very strange,Used to eat there allot in the restaurant but have not been in 2 years. Tried ordering in and food came ice cold and the pizza was so greasy it was not funny and the salami was also packed with oil. One piece of salami came on the pizza I kid you not 3 inches round and 1.5 inches thick if not 2 inches. Just sloppy housekeeping. And order pork chop it came sliced which was nice idea it was okay but would never never go back. Maybe if he reopened the restaurant but even then? I think this place is history
Family style restaurant with decent food for a reasonable price,"Friendly staff in a not particularly welcoming or stylish interior. Functional and practical, sure, but not more than that. Food was good, portions on the modest side of adequate. As a dessert fan I was a bit disappointed by the panna cotta: very very small. My wife had a nice tiramisu, though."
Divine,The restaurant in a quiet apartment building along Bukit Timah road but totally worth seeking out! Everything was divine - the best pasta we have had :)
The Italian Fix,"The local place to have superlative home style Italian with rotating specials and pricing that won’t nuke your wallet. The service is personal , the ambience is cosy and the food is outstanding. Been our Italian fix for 5 years and we never get bored of the angel hair pastas ! The special carbonara made in the cheese wheel was outstanding as well"
Great service an good food recommendations,"Another great dinner at Al Borgo! The service was personalised and friendly, we were made to feel genuinely welcome, almost like guests! Make sure you save room for the limoncello cake for dessert!"
Excellent wine and food,"Dinner was delicious. Wine was good, a bit costly. The beef and lamb were perfectly cooked and tasted good without any sauces added. Desserts were delicious and of course the limoncello went nicely with them. The service was excellent. We enjoyed ourselves."
Splendid Dinner,"Chef and his team are very attentive to our need. We feel like home whenever dining here. Chef makes spot on recommendations for our food and wine selection. Burrata is a must try here for appetiser. The Xmas special, suckling pick taste splendid. Crayfish pasta is oh la la.. We end the night with ann air-flown Panettone - really a must try. We all really enjoy our night, be it food or the friendly chef & team. Thank you for having us. We will return for sure."
Indeed Napoli,"The pizza lives up to its name. The pasta is also on point. The dining experience is quite cosy, and one can expect to be delighted."
Great pizza!,The place is so nice. The pizza is so good! I would like to commend khai for the great service! Cheers!
Comfort food,"Due to the Covid19 restrictions, we were unable to dine in. We pre-ordered for takeaway. We tried a few types of pastas and found them all soggy and overcooked. The Capellini with prawns was interesting but quite spicy. Parking was convenient in the basement."
"Great food but, cheated on the bill","Food was excellent, but......... Ordered a take away of 3 soups and 2 pizzas. When I reached the restaurant to collect the same, they asked me if it was 1 soup and 2 pizzas. I said, it is 3 soups and 2 pizzas. Immediately, they charged my card for 3 soups and 2 pizzas. But, when I picked up the food and reached home, I realised they gave me just one soup but split the quantity into three boxes although the card was charged for 3 soups. The bill reflects one soup but the charge slip reflects the cost of 3 soups. Isnt this outright cheating? Called the restaurant but there was no sense of apology. Sent them photos of the food packed. Their response was you come back and dine with us and we will give you a discount. How does this make any sense?

CHECK YOUR BILL WITH THE FOOD CONSUMED OR PICKED UP BEFORE PAYING!"
"Cozy Place, Good Food","Had Mother's Day Lunch at Al Borgo. Service was good and the dishes were authentically Italian. We had pizza, pasta, rib eye steak, burrata ...thoroughly enjoyed our lunch.. Will be definitely going back again. So many dishes and pizza to try..."
Good home style food,We enjoyed the Parma ham salad and beef pizza. The chocolate lava cake with ice cream was delicious too!
Great Italian fare...consistently,"Great Italian fare...consistently great food at a reasonable price. Service is great and food so Italian and tasty from their Burrata with tomatoes, spaghetti, seabass crusted in salt and their mushroom risotto wonderful. A small cozy restaurant and now getting more noticed as a good restaurant. Reservations is a must now!"
Amazing service,"I think finding amazing service from start to finish very difficult but these guys nailed it. The staff were all extremely friendly, knowledgeable and knew how to look after us. It was our first time there and won’t be our last!"
Terrific Italian Lunch After a healthy walk around Botanic Garden,"Wonderful surprise to find some delicious seafood pasta, pizza and wholesome salad right next to Botanic Garden in Singapore. Nice comfy environment with a warm, friendly and helpful service team. Much thanks to Ms Amanda for guiding us with the menu and for giving us some wonderful suggestions about Singapore."
Fantastic Italian food,"Fantastic Italian food. We came here exactly a week later as we were craving some authentic Italian cuisine. We walked in vs making a reservation, fortunately the gracious host accommodated us and the wait was short. We decided to try some new dishes and I must say that the Gnocchi we ate was delicious. The white creamy sauce was perfect for the soft and melt in the mouth gnocchi. A dish you must try. The four cheese pizza was perfect as well with a nice crispy base. You can literally hear the sound of the crispness with each bite. Absolutely divine ! We also liked the shrimps, though not a big fan of the shrimp with the head (we should have asked them to be headless/deshelled). The red wine was beautifully paired with the food (though we should have perhaps tried the white wine), given the food we ordered. I’m sure we will be back here. Hard to resist the food and the friendly service. Non appetite !"
Authentic Italian Cuisine,"This was truly one of the best Italian food we have eaten in recent times. The restaurant is lovely, the food is authentic and delicious and the service is excellent.
There are not many restaurants in Singapore where the service is excellent and memorable and this surely is one such place. We loved all the dishes we ate here. The Diavola pizza is superb and so is the carbonara pasta. We also loved the tiramisu. Will surely be back here again."
Excellent Italian food,Found this set up by chance as i was arranging ex colleague gathering after Covid Phase 2 opening. Ease of booking and staff attention to detials. Get help on food selection and turns out the pasta and pizza is excellent choice. House wine is good choice to pair with the Italian crusine.
Excellent Italian Napoli style,"Excellent Italian Napoli style food. From their Burrata with prosciutto, seafood pasta cooked in parchment paper and baked salted sea bass ( Brazano) tasted awesome and yummy. Their warm dessert Lemoncello cake with pistachio gelato tasted wonderful. Ended with an expresso with star anise liquor. Service was good while price is mid to high. A gem because it’s a family style restaurant and feel homely!"
Fantastic food and service,It isn’t my first visit to Al Borgo but each time I feel completely blown away by the quality of the cuisine and the warmth exuded from the service personnel. I would like to commend Amanda for delivering consistently with personalised service and recommendations. She makes all customers feel valued and special. Thank you! I will definitely be back again!
Excellent Food & Service,"Was recommended to this place by my friends.
To my surprise the food was excellent, very authentic and very Italian. Hats off to the chefs. Especially the pizza, saw them doing it through the glass panel, so much dedication & devotion into it.
Was greeted by the wonderful Amanda. She made us feel at home. Especially with my kids handing them little glow in the dark wrist bands.
Her recommendation on the food was excellent, and everything came together perfectly.
Will definitely be back again!"
Excellent Service,"Heard lots about Al Borgo through friends. Visited on Thursday and the food was amazing!

Brought me back to Italia. Also I’d like to credit Amanda on her excellent service. Her amazing personality brought so much joy to the whole experience of us dining there.

Definitely a place for my friends and I to go back."
Neighbourhood Favorite...,"This place is our go to spot for Sunday night dinners. The pizzas are great, and they often have good specials. I’m a particular fan of the Capriossa (sic) pizza. Def recommend making it a regular spot."
"Great pastas, pizzas and burratas",The pastas and pizzas are generally great. The Fettucine Kobe Beef and the Beef White-based pizza are particularly special. Tiramisu is good too. Italian-owned.
Best Italian in town,"A safe and reliable place we like to go to when we are in Singapore.
Excellent service by the staff, great Chef and superb Italian food in a nice, informal atmosphere.
The Italian wines available are really worth the experience, and if you are unsure, just ask the sommelier who will undoubtably make you a great recommendation.
The pizza is great, the pasta superb and the desserts too.
Don't forget to take a grappa to digest, it helps!"
"Good food, friendly and very attentive staff","The ambiance reminds me of a typical restaurant in Italy (where I come from). The Italian chef and his staff prepare good and tasty food. I enjoyed, even more, the service: attentive personnel (especially Amin), very courteous and attentive.
You can expect to spend around SGD35-60 per meal depending on your order (wine excluded). So, it is a bit pricey for being in a non-touristic area."
Dinner,Service was excellent! Pizzas are much better than Pizza Express! Calamari is just excellent! Keep it up!
Molto buono,"Vibrant ambience. Food took a while but the quality has always been consistent ever since I first found out about this place, which is amazing! The service is also amazing, very attentive and professional. Definitely recommended for an Italian craving when in Singapore. Ottimo!"
Bonissima pasta!,"Quiet and cosy location
Great service, smiling and professional
Superb choice of Italian dishes with an accent on the pasta, delicious! and the bruschetta too...
Also the wine list is rich of choice of whites and reds.
we always go back there as it is a truly safe value."
Excellent pizza,Pizza is truly amazing but the sea salt sea bass we ordered was really bland. Good think we had 30% discount otherwise it can be costly.
Our Go To Place for Italian Food,Food was good but service needs to be improved - wait staff - she totally forgot bringing us the dessert menu...
Nice place with a great service !,I really enjoyed my dinner there with a great customer service and an amazing pizza I hasten to recommend this cozy place for all fans of Italian cuisine. Besides you have to try their Lava cake!! It’s lovely
great food and service,"delicious food, dishes were well presented and a nice italian ambience. will definitely visit again."
Jewel of a neighborhood Italian Restaurant,"My wife and I took a visiting friend here for dinner (he lived in Singapore for 8 years before repartriating) and we ordered the daily pasta special (Taggliotini with seafood) and our friend ordered the Orrecchiette with cheese and sausage. We also ordered the sea bass baked inside a salted crust. For a starter we ordered the Burrata cheese antipasto with parma ham. The wines recommended by the staff were good compliments to the dishes we ordered. Service was prompt with the antipasto arriving only a few minutes after the order was placed. The pasta was excellent and the sea bass was fantastic. This was a Wednesday night and I was surprised to see the restaurant as crowded as it was. Overall, it was a very nice experience and my wife and I are starting to become regulars here."
Superb Italian cuisine,"Each time we go there (easy 10mn walk from our hotel) we feel like giving them an award.
The staff is great, smiling, knowledgeable and efficient.
The menu is rich in choice: pasta are excellent, pizza are great and you can have fresh fish, t-bone, risotto etc
Everything is just great!
But the wine list is the highlight of the meal and the sommelier will be prompt at helping you to chose if necessary.
Really a place to know, outside the busy Singapore."
Very good food and very smiling staff,"We went there after a team meeting bounding, the place was nearby the club. Must admit we went without expectation and we ordered many bruschetta and pasta. Everybody enjoyed their meals as I do for my traditional penne amatriciana which is a benchmark to test a restaurant. Bruschetta was ok, cheer tomatoes used are might not be the tasty one we can find in Europe but we know it’s difficult to get good ones here. The amatriciana was authentic, slightly over salted, need to be measured, but taste authentic! The Italian waiter was very pleasant, good advice provided, smooth service without too much waiting time. I will back often there as now I know a reasonable Italian place. Looking forward to try pizza. Thanks."
Always a pleasure to go back,"À reliable address, consistent in quality and service.
We always have joy going there for dinner, we just love their pizza and pasta.
Their wine list is worth it too: don't hesitate spending $100 on a great Italian nectar. The sommelier is of great professional advice.
Keep some room for dessert too as their sweets are worth the wait."
"Service ok, food taste nice, wine good","We made reservation as a party of 8 and they set the table in a cosy corner for us. Feels like a nice relaxed neighborhood Italian restaurant. The pizzas were very nice and we shared food (pizzas, pastas, steak) across the table and the restaurant was nice to allow that. They even prepared the steak for easy distribution. We accidentally broke a wine glass and they didn’t make a big fuss out of it. It was a lovely dining experience."
Once is enough.,"My colleague highly recommended this place but I feel there’s nothing to rave about. Price of food is on the high side and tasted average. Read from reviews chef and restaurant owners are friendly and will chat with customers. No that didn’t happen to me, but I saw them chatting some other customers and I felt that they are being selective, don’t feel good about it. Once is enough, I will not be back again."
Birthday celebration,"My friends and I had a great experience there. Their last available slot for the day was 1.30pm before they re-open at 2pm. My friends and I had a long catch up to do and although they are closed, they still attended to our request for desserts. We felt so bad but thumbs up for the staffs! Will definitely be back again!"
Excellent & Authentic Italian Food!,"Excellent consistency in the quality of food! Luv their homemade bread, rather, every single dish we ordered. The serving is reasonable and good for sharing too."
Pizza Night,"Was a lazy Wednesday night out for us, craving for pizza and decided to give this place a shot. We arrived at around 6.30pm which is pretty empty and quiet. By 8pm all tables are taken up.

Italian style thin crust pizza, love it. It pretty huge for Asian, so I guess 3pax for sharing portion.

They recommended seasonal dish Lombok ruby snapper fish. Oh god, it’s really good and fresh. It’s around SGD40 for this dish, affordable range based on the portion.

Quite a decent range of wine (by glasses) to choose from. Estimate pricing SGD15/glass.

I would say this is a hidden gem and can’t wait to be back for more surprises. Maybe the next round a bigger group so I could try our more dishes ❤️"
Delicious and Reasonably Priced,"Went on a Monday evening and restaurant was already fairly full. The service staff are attentive and prompt in refilling water. The food was delicious without burning a hole in your pocket as some other authentic italian restaurants may do, and it’s the best italian food i’ve had in Singapore for the price. We had the chef’s recommendations; pepeta di vongole for antipasti, capelli d angelo and fettucine kobe beef."
Best Italian restaurant in Singapore,"Al Borgo is amongst if not the best Italian restaurant in Singapore.
The food is exquisite and all dishes are top. We have also visited the restaurant with Italian born people and which live in Singaporean and they are literally in agreement with my statement. The Cook Chief is Italian and proud in serving well. The service is also great
Keep up like this. We look forward to our next visit."
"Excellent service, ambience and food","Great staff, quick and pleasant service, tasty food and good portions, nice environment, quick to respond staff. All in all, a great time"
Surprisingly good Italian food,"This restaurant is about a twenty minute walk from where we were staying and it was the first time we had eaten here. The ambience is pretty good and the staff friendly and the place was actually quite busy.

We were given some warm bread and butter with some olive oil and basalmic vinegar and iced water once we settled at our table. When all our friends had arrived we ordered Garlic Bread, Bruschetta pomodora, Griglitata di verdure, Alle verdure, Bufala, Lasagne alla Borghese, Pumpkin soup with affogato and tiramisu for dessert. For drinks we ordered Pinot grigio, Amarone, Pompelmo and Montepulciano. Total bill came to S$225.20 which was reasonable when taking into account the drinks.

The food in general was very good, not the best Italian I have eaten but still very nice and the ambience was great. One of the waiters originated from Milan which was nice since one of our friends spoken fluent Italian. As this is a short walk from where we stayed we will likely visit here again in the future. I do however recommend booking a table in advance."
Hidden gem,Hidden gem near MRT station and below a private apartment. Food was very good overall. Ambience was good. Service was relatively good as the waiters and waitress are quite attentive. Be sure to make a reservation if you are going on a weekend.
Disappointed,Pizzas were very good. Service was quite good. Florentine steak tasted burnt. They changed it and it was better but still had a bad burnt taste. Had the ribeye steak as well and it had a horrible burnt taste. Desserts were average. Grilled Fish was overcooked. Pastas were quite alright.
Pit Stop for Tasty Pizza,"Couldn't fault this restaurant.

We ordered one Capriciosa, which proved large enough for two hungry diners. Crust was thin, ingredients were fresh and delicious. Washed down with a sharp, sparkling lemon drink. Service was prompt and friendly. Very close to the Stevens MRT railway station, which is handy to remember where the Singaporean skies darken and rain begins to bucket down."
Surprise find local italian,"This was a last minute dinner and my friend found it. It's in one of those older small malls on Bukit Timah Rd.

Had never been and had no expectation.

The menu and specials looked nothing out of the ordinary however service was quick place busy and we ordered a simple mixed salad and the big Florentine steak for two.
Wine I chose was well priced and looked interesting wine list was small but good.

Wine was excellent first rate.

Salad was well presented and just ok size for two.

The steak platter and how the steak was cooked was totally fantastic ...perfectly cooked and side veggies just fine.

All up an excellent dinner unpretentious but excellent."
Lovely Classical Pizzas,"Conveniently located below Alocassia Apartments, this classical Italian restaurant has a diverse menu. We picked the Calzone and Proscuito pizzas which were both very tasty. Good size portions and great service."
Good Italian restaurant,Good food and good service. Family Enviromental therefore very relax and comfortable.Pricing reasonable and worth eating.
Awesome pizzas,"We stumbled upon this place by mistake actually. And boy, were we surprised. The pizzas here are probably one of the best in town. Very impressed! Fresh, light, fabulous thin crust and just the perfect combination of flavors. They have another branch in Telok Blangah but that is nowhere near in quality to the bukit Timah one."
Great dinner!,"Beautiful menu full of Italian (of course specialties), all very tempting.
Very good Chef, keen on coming to the tables and say 'Hi' to check his customers satisfaction.
Very good Manager and sommelier, helping you out for the wines, if required. Great coordination and overview of the dining room.
Great food, ambiance at reasonable pricing."
Great family run restaurant,If you’re looking for a nice Italian restaurant family run with the taste of homemade Italian food I highly recommend this restaurant this is now my fifth time eating in the restaurant and I highly recommend almost all the dishes on the menu Specially the pizza pasta in there calamari. Also had the veal was incredible
Hidden Gem,"Great place to relax with family and friends. Ejnjoy the delicious food, very well prepared with excellent helpful staff!"
Fantastic food and service and ambience,"We tried the pork chop, seafood risotto, calamari, chocolate lava cake and tiramisu. All the dishes were very well prepared and 2 of us enjoyed to the fullest! Personally, the pork chop and lava cake are on my favourite list. Service is great and they recommends wine for pairing too. Definitely visiting this place again."
"Great Food, reasonably priced.","Lunched with family on Sun 19 Dec at this charming family friendly casual restaurant at 383 Bukit Timah.

The service was fast and very pleasantly delivered by friendly abd knowledgable saff.

The owner chef was present to recommend the dishes, take our orders and prepare the dishes himself.

Altogther a wonderful Sunday aftrrnoon"
Great little hidden Italian gem,If you are after an Italian meal stop looking that is your place! Great pizza made by an authentic Italian chef Tiziano and to end a homemade dessert!! I would be back!
Cannot be wrong,"Definitely the best pasta in town: perfectly cooked, full of flavors and so good!
The selection of wines is great, and the sommelier knows his job very well: always trying to know your tastes and find the match with your dishes.
The service was impeccable (as usual), caring and efficient, that made such a global experience, unforgettable.
We all loved our dinner.
Thank you guys!"
Great italian find in bt timah,"Location is excellent. Quiet and convenient with easy parking.

Pizzas are our usual fave -excellent and thin crusted. Actually, we don't have a choice because the kids love it. You can also see the chefs preparing the pizza on the spot.

Service staff is excellent and polite. Our regular hangout."
Awesome beef short ribs!,"Just had a wonderful meal at Al Borgo this evening with family. We tried something new on the menu - the grilled beef short ribs that was simply amazing! And as always, the service is impeccable! Great work to the team at Al Borgo!"
Great Service,The Crab fetuccini was outstanding - highly recommend it. Mille Grazie for the Limoncello!! Cold as expected ; )
"Great food, nice ambience","I visited the outlet near Stevens Road and came away with a fantastic experience. The manager Ali was professional and personable, We ordered pizza, pasta and ribeye steak, red wine and prosecco. It brought back memories of our tour in Italy. It is as authentic Italian as you can get, better than Hyatt’s Pete’s Place.

Price wise, it may be slightly pricier but you get value for quality. And i also know the owner Alvin for a long time so the commitment to quality servicing is never in doubt.
Show less"
Superb Dinner,Love the foods! Will come back again.Planning to bring my family to celebrate Christmas there to have Christmas dinner!
Delicious!,"After our first experience there last month, as we were in the area we decided to go back and sample new dishes.
Service is still very good, pleasant and professional.
Ali was nice, making recommendations and very efficient; the burrata was great and the ham served with it, authentically Italian!
The Chef came to our table to check everything was great: a very appreciated attitude you don’t see often these days.
His pizza was quite good and we shared it as an appetizer, the pastas were absolutely superb, perfectly cooked al dente, and the meat ravioli were exquisite.
And as we were still a bit hungry, we shared a nice t-bone, from NZ I believe; very tasty and cooked medium rare, we ate it all.
Beautiful wines list available, mostly Italian of course, we
enjoyed a nice a fruity white from Tuscany.
Tiramisu and ice cream fro desserts, we all enjoyed a nice sweet before leaving.
What a great place!"
Consistently goog,"We have been going to Al Borgo for many years, about once every month or so. Their food is consistently good and always executed. The service is attentive and they always remember our favourite dishes, to the extent that some members of the family don't even need to order."
Delicious Italian Food with Local Flavors,"Cosy friendly place which serves delicious pastas and pizzas, accentuated with local flavors , like chili’s, which makes the tastes unique from the typical Italian recipes! Prices are reasonable too!"
a great place to discover,"A nice and cosy Italian restaurant with a wide range of specialities such as pasta, pizza, seafood, fish and also meat of course, to please all palates.
The service was great all along our stay, from welcome to payment. Very professional attitude from Ali, listening to our requirements, answering our questions and showing a courteous way of dealing with us.
The Chef prepared us some great pasta and we enjoyed the home made sausage too. A real Mediterranean taste!
Some table across the dining must have had some dish with truffle as we could smell this distinctive, exquisite and delicate aroma.
We’ll be back soon to sample the other delicacies."
Casual and relaxed for great Italian,Looking for great Italian in a causal setting? I think this is my recommendation. We liked the pepperoni pizza and their squid ink pasta best. Also good is the crab meat pasta. Friendly staff. It’s on ground floor of an apartment building where you need to take out your cash card and insert into the machine.
Great place!,The food was great although a tiny bit on the pricey side. Lovely location with a windowed kitchen. They do need to invest in a better ventilation system as the smell of the grill was overpowering my food a little. Other than that service was great and I would go back again.
One of my favorite Italian restaurants in SG,"Great food. Friendly staff. Excellent pizzas, pastas and the usual Italian food. Location is great (near Stevens MRT) but make sure to book a table in advance, as tables can get hot. Also a great place to grab some take-out. Has my recommendation (and palate)!"
Lunch,"A small Italian restaurant within a service apartment along Bukit Timah. McDonalds, Subway is within the building so as a supermarket, Cold Storage. The menu is quite extensive for a small restaurant. We had the Burrata with Parma ham cherry tomatoes and rockets taste wonderful. Fresh and tasty! We had the angel hair pasta with scallops. Taste awesome! Followed by Classic Tiramisu and a cup of macchiato. The macchiato was great but the tiramisu normal! Price is mid range. Service is very friendly and family sort of way. Lots of returning customers because it does taste good!"
Great Dinner,"I been to this place a few times n got my friends to dine. Great pizza n steak plus wonderful wines. All were happy diners n left satisfied.

The service is great. Seat in the front if available. Price is reasonable

So far, I had not encountered any issues. Happy to be back."
Outstanding Italian Food and Great Value,"I have been visiting Al Borgo regularly for the last 12 months and a review is overdue. This review is based on my most recent experience but the experience has been consistent over 15-20 visits.

We shared an excellent starter of large New Zealand clams (a special) cooked in a simple but delightful broth. Our main courses were the consistently delicious and spicy penne al’arrabiata, plus perhaps my favorite of their pasta dishes, the spicy Italian angel hair pasta with prawns.

Service, led by Ali, is always friendly, discrete and efficient.

This authentic Italian restaurant is as good as any I’ve been to in SIngapore, and food and wine is very fairly priced."
Good food and great service!,"They serve very good and authentic Italian food. The steak, lamb chops and pizza were all great. Service very good! Its the small little things that go a long way.. very polite staff, they saw that we were a thirsty bunch so they made sure we had enough water at all times... they conversed and laughed with us.. We enjoyed ourselves and will definitely be going back again!"
Great Italian Experience,"The restaurant is adjacent to the apartment we rented for our stay in Singapore. Our plane was delayed leaving Perth AU so by the time we arrived and got settled in, it was getting late. We decided to check out the restaurant and it turned out to be a great decision. We both ordered pasta dishes ~ the food & service were both excellent. We are going back this evening to enjoy a pizza. Great place to dine !! Ali is the Manager and makes everyone feel very welcome."
Damn that’s good!,"I didn’t expect much from an Italian on Bukit Timah!
I know lots of good Italians in Singapore!
Damn this is good!
All the Anti-pastas were great!
The pasta dishes awesome!
The Sea-bass in salt amazing,
The Tiramisu To die for!
Just st great we will be back very often!"
Best pizza in Singapore,"Fantastic, authentic pizza. So delicious. Ruccola pizza is a favourite as well as the bruschetta. The gentleman that runs the restaurant is delightful and can give many a recommendation!"
We love this place,Really good food and an outstanding service oriented staff. They always treat us the way any dining guest would hope to be treated. Highly recommend!
Excellent,I have been few times at Al Borgo and I always encountered professional service together with exquisite food .
Great food here!,"Went for a quick late lunch with the wife yesterday, on the way to kids' PTM. We ordered the spaghetti cartoccio and gnocchi. The Cartoccio was excellent, with generous portions of mussels, clams, prawn and scallops, all super fresh. The gnocchi took a while longer, but was well worth the wait. It wa brought to our table piping hot, oozing cheese, just the way I like it. Will certainly be back soon!"
Great Food Great Service,"It has been a while since I have been back and we were very impressed with the service and they were incredibly sensitive to my children's ""I am very hungry mom"" comments and magically made a pizza appear within 5 min of us ordering. The quality of the food was very good and taste Yums."
My fifth time there,"I’ve been coming to Singapore for many many years, I know people who eat there 3 times a week. He has specials all the time. Best calamari I’ve ever had by far and definitely best pizza anywhere and pasta incredible, I did last night have pizza and calamari as a main course I had tuna, the tuna was not good, first time I had a dish I didn’t like, I highly highly recommend this place when your in town maybe stick to Italian dishes and it’s a family run Italian family a must to try but make Reservation FOR SURE."
Review,"Awesome food served with great service provided by the staff, especially Bhavin! We ordered their salad, speciality kobe beef, soups n pizza! Great food & experience overall! Drop by to feel and taste it!"
Better for small groups rather than birthday celebrations,Better for small groups rather than birthday celebrations. Water tasted strange after refill. Don't think I'll be coming back here.
Good pizzas,Service was good and so were the pizzas. Used the entertainer to get 2 pizzas for the price of 1 which unfortunately is no longer available in 2018.
Best find for Italian food,"Despite being busy, the service staff did a great job in ensuring we are well taken care of. Pasta, pizza was absolutely delicious, cooked to perfection and the overall dining experience left us asking for more! The ambience was great for families and friends gathering. their service staff remained friendly despite the peak timing. I would definitely return for more! Well done!"
Great food!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our italian dinner here. Great pizza and pasta of all kinds, good service too!"
Quality authentic Italian cuisine,"Al Borgo @ Namly located at #03-00 41 Namly Avenue, newly opened branch out of town. This is a family restaurant which they managed to create a nice ambiance like in trattoria in Italy. It is a great place for casual dining and group gatherings, where families and friends can enjoy delectable food and drinks in a comfortable quiet and cosy setting.
They also use Fresh ingredients from Italy. We had Pappardelle Al Cinghiale, Filetto di Manzo alla Brace, pastas, and Pizza Contadina followed by Tiramisu on that night, all were really tasty. The wine was also really good. The service was efficient, professional but not overwhelming. All in all we had a wonderful evening. I truly recommend this place if you want high quality authentic Italian cuisine. I’m sure we will come back very soon."
Good food & service,"Food was great, ambience was great. The service was a tad slow but that's alright. The pizzas were fragrant and pasta were nice."
"Ok food, worse service","The tiny restaurant was sorely lacking in wait staff. Even though the boss was helping out, we left after our mains because we never got our dessert menu despite asking for it. Looking at the portions of customers that were served around us, we though the portions were huge. As we informed the staff we would be using Entertainer, the portions were definitely smaller. We ordered the Angel hair and chilli crab pastas. The sauces were good and tasty, but something was missing with the pasta.
Would I be coming back? Never."
Great experience at a family friendly restaurant,"We usually order pizza delivery from Al Borgo but decided to dine in today. Fantastic experience from the start - the staff are warm and friendly, they brought baby cutlery for my son without being asked and were engaging with him. We'll definitely be back!"
Italian food especially for those who love seafood pasta. Save your appetite for dessert!,Pizzas are usually the reason I visit Al Borgo and they now have another branch at 41 Namly Ave. The fact that its free parking and less crowded at Namly side makes it a nice location when you to chill with your family on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I highly recommend it. Service crew is very attentive and Chris the restaurant head is always smiley. MUST try is the Tiramisu
Belissimo!,"It's very rare that you find such great quality food, wine and service at a reasonable price. Al Borgo ticked all boxes.
We had the large anti pasto dish with the burrata between four of us.. it was huge! Definitely one of the best that I've ever had!
Pizza was great, they even do a half half topping.
All 3 pastas were incredible.
The beef cheeks outstanding!
Desserts were large and devine.
Wine list was varied and very well priced.
A great casual atmosphere made our experience even more enjoyable.
Thank you!"
