My review,"1st time at Red dot with my daughter who book the table , food and serving are quiet well and satisfy. This time, I booked my self and have dinner with my wife & invited my friend couple. But your serving is very poor. Some food are seem to be overcooked , looklike charcoal. I am not sure that you have changed your chef for that day due to CNY holiday period. I have to wait for too long for some additional dishes which I ordered, and approach to counter and have to ask your staff for why take so long.I found that she does not see the my order in her computer. She only updated the system after my approach. Because she was not at her desk. I am quiet disappointed in that day."
Nice location but have much room to improve ambience.,"Christmas decor was seemingly left on, while CNY decor put up over Christmas decor in certain places is really unsightly.
Sound system was miserable, and mozzies galore without sight of mozzie zappers or even mozzie coil… this place has such beautiful environment by default of its location, but no tots into making it a good experience for customers experience. Food alone is not good enough for dining experience, which is a pity, and hopefully the owners take this as constructive criticism."
"Good Food, Bad Service","For a brewery it was terrible how hard it was to get a drink. Orders were lost, drinks took a very long time to be delivered and overall the staff were just not interested. The food was OK, but overlal the experience was not"
Red Dot Brew house Dempsey,The place is vibrant and full of christmas deco when we visited post Christmas. Service and food was good. Nice place for gathering and listening to live band.
Pablo,Excellent food service and entertainment. Will be going back soon particularly liked the green beer in the tower.
Its a craft beer restaurant!,The brewery is really a restaurant and brewery together. It was easy to get to from Santosa where we we’re staying. The staff were friendly. Over the course of the night they did make a lot of mistakes with the drinks orders. Given that you need a local phone number to order the food this made things interesting. The drinks do take a while to arrive so plan ahead. The food was tasty and the beer is really great craft beer. I enjoyed the evening. I would return.
Short Handed,"Although the decoration is nice ,service is so so...looks like short handed, also foods is not that attractive, as compared to my last year visit. With that kind of price and taste cold foods ...hope they will last . , !"
Deposit,"The rule mentioned need paid deposit $50, booking is on 11/11/22, but till today still haven’t received the deposit yet. Kindly advise me by tomorrow. The waitress Teresa is a good service in the restaurant. The food quality good, and will attend again this restaurant"
Good atmosphere,Nice deco and beer garden environment vibes. My guests love the atmosphere. Unfortunately no live bands at that time.
Red dot did not receive reservation,"As forementioned. Also, one of our orders did not arrive, even after an hour waiting. Canceled order in the end."
A new space of taste and relaxation,Great experience. The atmosphere is very welcoming and chill . Great food and service. It can be expensive but worth it. Staff are extremely knowledgeable and make great recommendations.
Lovely experience!,Wonderful place - relaxing with lots of greenery. Dog friendly. Amazing beer and good variety of foods.
Nice ambience and lovely food,Good food and lovely ambience. Just the service not too attentive and food serving took a bit long. overall good experience. a bit warm on the day i visited hence my sampler beer get warm pretty fast..
Good Food & Good Vibes,"One of the best grilled food I have eaten ! Squid tubes, Satay and porky were so addictive I had to order 2 servings each.. The variety of beers were refreshingly good too! We had the yuzu, green beer and stout!

The live band are lit. They are very talented .. they got many people dancing! The overall energy and vibe is so fun!

Good food, good vibes and good service.. definitely will be coming back with more friends"
Impolite Staff,"The website operating hours indicate it close at 10:30pm. By 10pm, they start closing the lights to drive away the patron, by 10:15 the force you to go so they can close at 10"
Food is expensive,"The food was expensive and portion quite small…. compare to my last visit in May 2022, they had done it badly 😢"
Truly awful. Gone so far downhill it is now underground,"Beer good enough, and that's the only good thing to say.

Food unbelievable awful. I assume they are hiring someone who has no taste buds as their chef.

Made the mistake of ordering a steak (NEVER do this here - or the lamb, looking at other reviews). Part of the meat was partially uncooked (raw - not even ""blue"" - and that uncooked part was spit-it-out disgusting). Clearly have very uneven griller / incompetent cooks.

The spring rolls are filled with ""goo"". Even my 10 year old said they were awful.

Also, when I asked for some lemon with whitebait, was given (eventually) a lemon piece that was so small I probably got 4-5 drops out of it. I asked for another piece, given exactly the same paltry size.

Similarly with pizza, asked for olive oil, was told I may have to pay for it (!). Eventually (after eaten half of pizza) was given a thimble sized amount. Most restaurants just give you a bottle of (cheap) olive oil - that's fine). Very ""cheap"" behaviour, especially when one has already ordered steak etc.

You clearly have to negotiate for everything here - very un-generous - despite relatively high prices. (They don't realise that the price of a lemon / olive oil is insignificant compared to the value of creating happy return-clients??? Clearly not very bright management).

Also, the chairs are rubbish - like sitting in a very old and cheap garden for children. Small and sharp and uncomfortable. Fine for children, not adults.

And they let people come with dogs, regardless of how ""yappy"" they are. And the one there on our night was VERY yappy.

Smokers are allowed to smoke very close to the non-smokers (less than 2m away). Health hazard and pretty disgusting.

Overall, only come here for the beer, if you must. I will never return - the company is clearly run by a bunch of money-grubbing cheapskates who don't wish to give anything to guests that they don't have to.

The only good thing is the waitress called Su, who when she saw my undercooked raw meat part of the steak agreed it was awful, took a picture to show the cooks, and gave me a free beer. I'd rather have had a decently cooked steak and pay for my own beer. She should work for someone who gives a damn for her skills, instead of having to handle clients who feel they have been ripped off.

Rubbish - don't waste your money. Our meal cost c. 200 Sing$. The next night we went to a fabulous chilli crab meal at Jumbos at ECP, which cost a little more, but was a million times better. The beer at Red Dot is good enough (although the green one is just a marketing ploy and not very tasty), but there are plenty of places now with good craft beer. The owners are just raking in the profits, not interested in developing the reputation of Red Dot. Don't bother going here."
Good food and friendly service staff,Second time here.....as pleasant and good ambience plus good food. Attentive and friendly staff who also noticed we've an accompanying pet
Don’t go for the band,Highly recommend this place if you ever want to experience a live cover band completely butchering classic rock favorites!
Go when u need fresh beer,Good beer selection since it’s brew house. Food is so so and quite expensive. Staff service is not standard. My server was very polite while others weren’t so. I even got butt-brushed at the head by one of them! 😒
Overrated Beer Garden,"Had dinner here on a weekday. Noisy, tacky ambience with cigarette smoke wafting in from a lone smoker at the edge of the dining area. The brews were bland and the food, average and over-priced. Forget about having any meaningful conversations since you will have to shout above the din."
Cozy beer place,Nice cozy place for a night out. Traditional bar food and homemade beers. Not the best food or beer but definitely good enough for having a good time in the nice garden. We had live music that added to the good atmosphere.
"Great ambient, great music and most importantly Great Beer","Great ambient, great music and most importantly Great Beer.... But I am disappointed that the delicious meat platter is no longer on the menu and Summer Ale has gone dry.... but overall 5* for the Craft Beers, Service and Ambient but please bring back your Meat Platter so that I will come more often with friends...."
Most Immersive!,"The family decided on RedDot as the next venue for its regular dinner series (partly on account it was a new place for us), and we were not disappointed.

The experience was very immersive. The place was buzzing with many diners, and the open feel to the area, with decor that is an ode to nature, adding to a pleasant evening.

It was also nice to be able to enjoy live music again in more than two years, while partaking of the tasty satays and the house-specialty beers.

Service was also attentive and prompt. Thanks RedDot."
First and Last,The food was so so and not worth the price at all. Service was poor. It will be our first and last visit.
Great Service but not great food,"I had visited this place couple of times before and was impressed by the service and the quality of food. As for this visit, i can only give thumbs up for the place and service. The quality of food has dropped. The grilled lamb had a strong smell which is not appealing to consume. The reddot burger buns were little hard. So i am quite disappointed with the food. The only consolation is the great service staff and the place. Food not so great this time."
"Underwhelming food, athmosphere and service",Food was pricey and pretty underwhelming. As was service and athmosphere. Would not recommend and will likely not go back.
Excellent place,Located at a quite corner in the Dempsey road. It was an excellent environment and food. More choice of food would be better.
Good Environment,"I love the environment so much, beer taste good also. Food overall not bad. Highly recommendation. Can have a try if you never try before."
AMAZING!!! an aussie’s dream,"this place was so enjoyable! we were travelling from australia and were lucky enough to have dinner here during our stay. i’m not usually a beer drinker, but the mango sour one is so yummy! and the food? incredible! we loved everything. amazing service and amazing food! 10/10"
Dining Experience,Happy hour was not crowded while place allow smoking and drinking at the same time. Pets were also allowed
Good and bad,"Good is the view and the environment, overall experience is very nice and make sure you will return back to restaurant again. Bad is the food portion is too big, we ordered two mains which it actually can fit for three persons!"
feedback,It was beautiful. The greenery around it was a cherry to the cake. Would visit it again with my family.
"Nice food, nice ambience","nice food, nice layout of the restaurant, easy parking. the food was served quite fast. a good place for gathering but too bad they only limit 2 hours per table."
Review,It was a very nice and romantic place to go with families or friends . And it was a pet friendly area. Very good atmosphere ! Well spent our time enjoying the view and food there with the natural environment!!! Highly recommended!
Great BBQ,The greenery and water pond created a great environment for drinks and food. The BBQ squid is not to be missed. The aroma from the BBQ that flows with the cool breeze is a fantastic...
RedDot BrewHouse Dempsey,Very good place to chill out with friends and family. Staffs are friendly and service is great. One of the best place to drink beer in Singapore
RedDot pleasure,RedDot provides a wide range of boutique freshly brewed beer for those who appreciate a wide range of beer. Wide range of tidbits and main courses are also available to compliment the drinks if meals are also needed. Always a pleasure to visit RedDot.
All time favourite place to dine!,"Whether it’s with friends or family, Red Dot never fails to deliver good food and service. Our “go to” place"
Great expectations but service below regular,"Although the restaurant has a marvelous atmosphere and outstanding view, the service was below regular. I'd seen some videos previously on youtube and other social media, thus my expectations were quite high but in the end they were far away from be achieved..."
Lovely Atmosphere and Friendly Staff,Great ambience and beer. Even had a Santa walking around to greet and bring joy! Love how it is also very accessible by public transport (busstop near the road).
Dont go for lunch !,"Overall felt like this place is overrated. Some of the famous dishes are not ready for lunch. Craft beers are okay but definitely not worth the trip down to this place. Giving an average rating for the festive decoration and ambiance, but poor rating for the food. My advice, probably try avoiding this place for lunch."
Great place to chill with friends and business partners,"Great place to chill with friends and business partners. The food were of the right portions, beer was nice too. Recommended place."
5 stars,Awesome place! Nice ambience and such pretty Christmas decorations. Good food and staff are excellent. Will definitely visit again! Nothing to complain about.
RedDot Brewhouse review,Reservation was seamless!!! amazing ambience and service. Great Beer! Thank you very much. will visit again.
Wonderful experience,The whole place is packed with nice Christmas deco that gives everyone a good Christmas feel. My family and I love the food and ambience there!
Most horrible experience,We went there after making a reservation well in advance. There was literally no food. We tried ordering 4 dishes all of which they said were unavailable. Called the manager to complain and she was rude and totally unapologetic. Her explanation no food!! What is the point in making a reservation and going to a place which does not charge less?!!
Nice Food and Ambient,"Been there for the 3rd time this year and making the 4th on Christmas Eve.
Staffs are attentive, checking in is seamless, do book for an appt to avoid long waiting time.
Food are served fairly quickly depending on the crowd of the day, however they are freshly served so can imagine the backend team are doing a wonderful job !!"
Pretty good beer,"Just went with a few friends for drinks. Service was ok, not great as always had to wave someone down to get served. We tried various beers. Nothing stood out, but a decent spot."
Room to improve,There are mosquitoes during lunch hour when I was sitting on the upper part. The service was quite delayed as well may be short handed
"Good beer, blah food","Beer was good, food was not. Very bland and so so and we had about five dishes and they were all only so so."
Good place,Good place and nice environment to chill with your friends and love ones. The food is delicious at reasonable price. The staff here are friendly and their service is good! Will definitely pay a visit again! Thank you!
"Great for families (including fur babies) with good food, good drinks, and excellent service!","Had lunch with my family and was blown away by the excellent service, delicious food, and excellent beer. Great pet-friendly restaurant too! Our fur baby was even given extra ice in her water bowl because it was a fairly warm day. Can't wait to go back again soon. Highly recommend!"
Ambience never fails to impress,"Enjoyed my experience at the Red Dot Brewhouse. The fish & chips were nice (relatively small for an adult). Enjoyed the garlic mushrooms side dish which was tasty with plenty of garlic bits. And my friend who had ordered the carbonara was presented with a delightfully generous serve of that. They didn't have some lava & cheese cake dessert items and only had ice cream, which tasted okay. Key selling point was the ambience here. The food... was nice."
Fabulous Resto,"Wonderful place indeed but suggest to have lower price range , Amazing place to go and this is my 4th time"
Great service from serving crew,Beautiful ambience with nice greenery during the day. Fans to keep the heat off. Food is enjoyable with some variety on beverages including the sampling beers.
Perfect except for one thing.,"My wife and I dined on a Saturday evening at 6pm.
I will start by saying the service staff were great, the beer I tried was excellent and the food was wonderful. We shared 4-5 different finger foods and tapas.
The one thing, which I found very annoying was....My wife ordered a specific tea from the menu. The serving staff said she would check if the had it. On her return she informed us that tea and coffee service had finished for the evening. My wife then ordered an orange juice and was told they had run out of that last night....surely not difficult to get oranges or juice on a saturday. The next service person brought my beer and I enquired what time they stopped serving tea. He replied 11:30am and 5pm. I asked if I could speak to the manager and he went to get him/her. He then returned and asked what tea we would like as the bar tender will make it. So, eventually my wife got her tea. I was left wondering.....is this a management rule that tea and coffee stops getting served, or is it a made up rule by the bar tender. Yes, I know it is a brewery bar but, not everybody can or wants to drink alcohol. Also, a lot of people even after drinking, like to finish a meal with dessert and coffee.
I still rate this restaurant very high due to good service staff and good food, but if management reply, please clarify the tea issue."
Lunch,"Had a lunch with the family.
- cappuccino was poor (did not look any close to the picture on their menu)
- IPA beer was good
- the food we ordered did not arrive at same time. Some already finished eating when last main dish arrived
- food quality was OK
- cigarettes were laying on the ground
- we complaint about above but waitress did not do anything about it which was a pity"
Diner choice,Good atmosphere and good ambiance to dine with friends. Have different type of beers to drink and the service is good.
Good Ambiance,visited here for dinner. The food is a typical bar food and nothing special... also ordered beer tasting but a bit dissapointed. However the ambiance is chill so gave 3 ratings!
lovely alfresco dining,"Nice ambiance, lovely alfresco dining and decent menu. Shared some stouts and beers, and some food. Unfortunately, can’t make any helpful recommendations."
Limited food menu only to finger tips,"Due to a ceremonial event, food orders are limited only to finger tips. Shop person didn’t mention the limitation when making reservation."
Nice ambience,"Food is great, place is nice and relaxing. It's a good place to catch up with some privacy. Don't mind to come again next time"
"Enjoy the ambience, service and food",Reservation and reminder system is good. Admitting into the restaurant is quick and responses from the service staff is relatively fast.
Perfect afternoon,"Perfwct ambience to uplift your mood and indulge in private tete-a-tetes with friends or family. Menu has something for wveryone. Garlic mushrooms are to die for! Good drinks choice. White sangria was just perfect. Service is awesome - subtle, unobtrusive yet prompt. We had a great valentines lunch in cheery greenery."
Disappointed,Taste for food and beer could be better for the bill we paid. They should really put more effort in that. Ambience and service is good.
"Terrible food, mediocre beer, good service","Really good service from the crew. They were friendly, patient and nice to us. I wish I could say the same for the food. Ordered cheese sausage and was bland and tasteless. Lamb rack was fatty and rough for medium rare. Steak was nothing special to wow for. The green veer was alright. Food menu and quality need serious improvement."
Christmas Eve lunch,"Came on Christmas Eve and we were fortunately to be able to reserve our seats on the same day. They really spend effort to decorate the place to have a Christmas feel. We arrive at 12.30pm and the place is still quite empty, we were able to take a lot of pictures but unfortunately it starts to raining. Nonetheless, this did not damper our Christmas spirit and we order their Christmas special and enjoy the food and time there."
Satisfaction,"Overall is good.
Food is above average with reasonable price. I like the Christmas decoration. The service is excellent as the staff will patiently explain the meal and beverage inside the menu.
The seat is too near to charcoal place. Christmas cocktail taste is not quite good."
Great place to chill,"Planned a catchup session with friends and ambience was great! Even though the place was packed in middle of the week, food and service was awesome!"
Food was surprising good!,The food was great. Fish and chips were light and crispy. Wagyu rump was done just right. Was really impressed. The red velvet cheescake was a miss though. Really excellent service and it was great to see dogs around!
Catch Up with ex-colleagues,The environment was attractively decorated with warm lights surrounded by plants and trees. Beer was good especially the green monster. Service by Stanford was very good. He was amusing and pleasant. We had a good time catching up old times and enjoying each other company. Liked the pizza and satay too.
Nice Ambience but avoid peak hours,"Nice Ambience with generally good service but let down by not so tactful staff during peak period.
The bill was hastily presented to me without my asking even when we have not finished our drinks after dinner. Then we were asked if we intend to order anything else otherwise can we leave as they have customers waiting. Where we were seated we could not see the queue at the entrance so it would have been understandable if it was nicely explained to us so we will not feel like being chased away.
Such an approach should be better handled by an experienced manager or senior staff."
Great place to chill with great ambience,"1st time trying this place as we were looking for a ""pet friendly"" bar. Turned out this place is excellent, great ambience, lady owner is very welcoming and friendly. She even provided very good service to our dog by giving her a water dish. Beers are very unique and homebrewed. Food was delish too. Definitely will visit it again soon!"
A relaxing and casual evening night out!,"Food standard is above average and atmosphere is excellent provided dogs are not allowed to be ""seated"" on chairs or barking at each other while we were enjoying chatting and drinking. During covid19, I am mindful of personal hygiene and behaviour of patrons. Service standard could have been better but I did realise that the restaurant is understaffed."
Friday night drinks with friends,"Great selection of beers and a pretty wide selection of bar food - grills, burgers, sausages etc to keep most happy. Staff were knowledgable esp on their own selection beers and also around food selection. Portion sizes are generous (think USA) so probably dont need appetizers.
Enjoyable night was had by all.
More suited to a night out with friends / collegues in a casual environment than a romantic dinner out."
Glorified Pub,"Not a bad pub serving well cooked but average pub food.

Minus point for us, ordered satay as a starter with the first drinks. Ten minutes later we ordered our food which arrived and was finished before the satay!!!

Upon enquiring if our desert (I.e. The satay) was coming anytime soon I was told that it was a busy evening and it would be ready in ten minutes. I told the waitress that it's Saturday night, you should expect to be busy and have enough staff.

Looking at other reviews, this is not the first time!!!"
Meeting point and drink before Sam's Curry next door,"Quite disorganised, took a while and a bit of a process to get a round of drinks for 4. Inobservant idiots take note, the toilets arent a row of unisex toilets, the first two are male, the second two female (as I found out when emerging from one of the second two to a mildly startled lady who pointed this out)"
Great time for group,Nice place for a group gathering. Do not seat too near the bushes though! :) unless you have mosquito repellent. Ambiance is really right for a group.
"Great location, interesting decor, good beer, nice food, lousy service!","We visited on a Sunday afternoon, got a table inside on the lower level, staff were attentive on arrival (although there was a problem with the thermometer as according to the readings all 4 of us were suffering with hyperthermia!), once we were seated we were given the usual deluge of menus then, as always at this venue, the staff disappeared!
After about 10 minutes I went to the bar and ordered a round of drinks from the barman, he said he would bring them to our table but experience told me that at RedDot it's best to wait and take the drinks back yourself! The same was repeated with the next round of drinks although on this occasion even the barman had vanished and was found having a chat with colleagues.
When we came to leave the staff were very apologetic about the poor levels of service although still added the 10% service charge to the bill!
I don't know what it is about this place, it's a great venue and the food and drink is good but they never have enough staff and those they do have aren't well trained or attentive enough - it's a real shame and puts us off going more often."
"Nice venue, friendly service and plenty of distance between tables","Unlike some other bars in this era of social distancing, RedDot leaves a lot more space between outdoor tables than 1 metre. That made us feel far more relaxed and we really enjoyed the evening. Service was friendly and the food was good, especially the satay."
Beer restaurant,"Al fresco open air beer restaurant. Good variety of beer and snacks. Pleasant service everytime we've been here. Due to COVID measures, reservations are necessary. Dog friendly restaurant but I wouldn't really bring my pooch here as it can get noisy and loud. Order the tower if more than 4 in a group."
Nice ambiance & excellent beer,"Made reservation easily and received a warm welcome. Ordered a tower of the beer of our choice. Good variety of home brewed beers to select from. We ordered the sausage platter, onion rings and truffle fries and the food was excellent. The ambience was cosy & nice"
Love this place!,"Love the atmosphere, the beer and the service here! And great mojitos! Love all the little ambiance enhancers ... koy ponds, twinkling lights and dog statues."
An enjoyable venue,"Relaxed, comfortable but classy environment, indoor and outdoor seating, very pleasant staff, good value, great food, good drink selection."
Decent beers,"I came here for a first visit in Jan 2020 on a weekend late afternoon with a friend. A good selection of beers and reasonable pricing with a decent ambience and not too crowded. We didn't try the food, but the beers were cold and good. Efficient and friendly service also."
Order was missed,"Went on Valentines Day. We wouldn't given a menu when we sat down and had to asked twice before the menu was given to us. Then ,we waited for 30mins for our sides to be served with our drinks and another 30mins for my friend's main to be served. Service was very slow which was understandable due to the huge crowd. We waited for awhile more and realised that my order was missed and checked with the server - which was still understandable as the resturant was busy.

What was unacceptable was that we waited for another hour and checked with different staffs multiple times and our meal was still not served while we watch the rest of the table getting served the food item that I ordered.

Also, we understand that it was a busy day but it's unacceptable that half of the outdoor space was handled by only poor server. As we were waiting for my main, we saw how his colleague would constantly pass him beer/ food while he was serving the guests. It seems impossible for him to finish his current task and move to the next one. While we tried to get the rest of the staff to check on the order, they all just ignored us and move on with their task.

We had to cancelled my main after waiting for 2hrs and left (with an empty stomach) as it seem impossible that any of the staff (other than that poor server) to check on my order. Kudos to that server - he was really trying his best. But the overall service was really terrible."
Good for families,"Spent a Sunday arvo here with friends - ate some snacks and had beers including the GREEN beer - this was fun and novelty but also a nice crisp lager - don't let the colour put you off :)

Pork belly was too small of a portion - and not worth it.. so skip that!"
"Good for a beer, not for food","The beers are ok, seating is alright as well. It is not a too fancy place and appears a bit rundown already."
Always a fun night at Red Dot,"Great venue, great drinks. Staff were very friendly and looked after us very well as we were all being a bit fussy. Live band also there which was great."
Good place to chill out,Atmosphere was good. Most of the food items we had were fantastic. If the clams were bigger would be good. I don’t mind paying more for bigger clams
One of the worst place I have been to,"Brought a few clients here for some beer as we thought the atmostphere would be good. The service was so bad and it was not even busy, staff was not trained in basic service at all. On top of that the food we ordered took so slow to arrive, the chicken wings was dry and did not have much flavour. Pizza dough was almost burnt and did not even taste good. So much for entertaining clients, please stay away from this place with a ten feet pole. No management employees in sight and no one even bothered to come and ask for refill for our beers. One of the most embarassing meals I had with clients."
Good overall experience,starters are very good. Ambience and good live performers make it a good time invested. Music system of the performers can be improved.
Family friendly brunch / lunch spot,"With shade from some huge trees and covered areas with fans, this is a lovely green spot to spend several hours catching up with friends or family. Staff were friendly, beer was great with different varieties to try. Food was well presented, with a range of options to suit different taste buds. We visited in a Sunday when there are additional activities for children including balloon making, fish catching and a hit was make your own pizza which the children then ate for lunch."
"Great food, reasonable prices, pleasent setting",We had a class dinner for 11 including some geographically diverse attendees. Everyone found food that they enjoyed and it didn't break the bank. Our waitperson was attentive and took good care of us. All tables are open air which was great.
Very cool place,My friends went there for the first time and liked the place that they are planning to bring their family and pets!
Great service,"Had my proposal here, the staff was extremely helpful and experienced. Very responsive to emails, and made every effort to meet every request. 10/10 would come again."
Fabulous experience!,"Visited this place to celebrate birthday of a family member. It was a great decision to do this at Red Dot Dempsey. The food, service and music....everything was fantastic. Would highly recommend this place and will suggest to do prior reservation as the place got full very quickly in the evening!
Their craft beers were a great pairing for the food. The team of KR, Jenny and her colleagues were top notch."
Nice for early evening drinks!,"Went to Reddot for later-afternoon drinks with some friends. Set in an historical building (old army barracks building), it has its own brewery - as such its drink menu has some weird and wonderful draft ales/ beers on it - as well as a good selection of wines, cocktails and non-alcoholic beverages. We also had a few light snacks - again the food menu looked pretty good (and having eaten there before), the food is quite tasty. I must admit that whilst the waiter staff are very friendly, sometime the service is ""pedestrian"" - however that didn't detract from what was a fairly pleasant experience. When we arrived at 5.30pm, the restaurant wasn't too busy but it did gradually start to fill up and as it was a Saturday evening they had a live band which were not too bad either. There is covered seating as well as a ""beer garden"" - plenty of greenery as well as a little pond with small goldfish in.....which kept the young kids occupied for a while. Overall - not too bad. we had a good time."
Lunch at RedDot BrewHouse,"I went to RedDot BrewHouse on 17 April for lunch. I ordered a three course set meal. The main course took close to 2-hrs to come. I marched RedDot at 12.30pm but got my food only at 2.15pm. Imagine how hungry I am. What a shame.
I ordered a striploin medium rare but the striploin that came was more like medium well."
