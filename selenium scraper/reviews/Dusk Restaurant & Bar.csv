Great Time,The ambiance was beautiful ambiance! The food was tasty and the staff working there was very friendly!
Good food with good view,Good food with scenic environment. Special thanks to the servers and chefs. The food and service was excellent! Thank you and we will Definitely visit again.
Will be back again‚Ä¶,"Great food, excellent service, super views‚Ä¶.what more can you ask for? Music on request !!! Manager plays sings on our requests. Wow"
Food poisoning! Beware!,"We just ate there and are having severe food poisoning. We ordered the fresh crab stack and it tasted really fishy and the burrata was bland and still frozen. We also ordered the prawn capellini and it came out not hot at all, pasta was dry which was a bummer as well.

Would recommend not eating there for safety reasons - we also saw mice crawling around the restaurant (in the plant area near the stage). Otherwise the view, live band and service are worth a short visit with a drink but nothing else."
Perfect location for a perfect evening,"Good food, and lively music in a scenic environment. The singer and guitarist are simply amazing, and made the evening more lively. Special thanks to the servers and chefs. The food and service was excellent! Thank you and we will Definitely visit again."
Thank you for the service Paolo and Ananya :),"Really appreciated the warm service from both Paolo and Ananya. Paolo was sweet and charismatic. Ananya was very knowledgeable and well spoken. The drinks were lots of fun. It unfortunately poured heavily before coming, and we missed the sunset. Have to come back for it and the service :)"
Great ambiance,The view was amazing and well worth it! Anya was a great server! The food was just okay and the drinks were pretty but didn‚Äôt taste great . The view alone is worth it though .
Wonderful Boxing Day üòÑüëç,"Our family have a wonderful Boxing Day at DUSK! The food is splendid! And the service is perfect! Especially this male staff, JJ, he is very polite, helpful and smart!

He knows exactly what we really wantand he helped us efficiently!
1) the food he recommended is good!
2) the wine he recommended is good!
3) the cocktail he recommended is good!
4) the desert he recommended is good!

We indeed enjoy our Wonderful Boxing Day at Dusk!

Thank you JJ!
Thank you Dusk!"
Annual team dinner at Dusk,"We held our annual team get together at Dusk last Friday. They were the only restaurant that did not charge us a hefty/non-refundable booking fee (as seems the norm with most Sg restaurants in Dec). They were very accommodating of our requests and the hospitality was impeccable. Clarissa from Dusk was managing our group and she is amazing. Very attentive, friendly, and accommodating. As for the dinner, it was amazing. The food tasted good and our orders were served smoothly. The desserts particularly were amazing and humongous. I'd recommend getting 1 for 2 people unless you're getting the tart. The ambience, live music, amazing staff and Clarissa made our evening worth every penny spent and more. The drinks were super fun and tasty as well. Light bulb cocktail was the highlight for our group, I think we drank a billion of them. I highly recommend this place for a team dinner or a romantic evening with your significant other. 10/10 100%"
Lovely view and Great Service,"Me and my husband had a lovely dinner ay DUSK. We enjoyed the food, great service n the magnificent view. Big shout to Paulo for all the support."
"Great service, view and food!",Ananya and Chi were lovely in the hospitality tonight! Me and my partner had a great time here with the food and view! Thank you!
Beautiful sunset meal,Just had a beautiful experience at dusk tonight. Service and food was excellent. We have a travel vlog (Em & Dean) and this will feature in day 4 in 4 weeks time. Fantastic experience along with the cable car to get here. Would highly recommend.
Perfect spot for a sundowner,Great spot for a sundowner especially arriving on the cable car after a long day traipsing round Sentosa. 5 stars for the service alone.
Great evening,"Excellent views, fantastic food and service. Highly recommended to come with your family and friends."
Sunset dinner,Came here via the cable car from Sentosa. What a beautiful place! The food was amazing and the staff were exceptional- so friendly and helpful. The sunset was just incredible too. A must do if you visit Singapore
Walk up the hill n beer with snacks,"Excellent location , excellent service,. amazing overall experience:-) great place for a lively n lovely evening with friends n family .."
"Awesome Food, Wonderful Cocktails & beautiful views !! A must see for all thr above, you won‚Äôt regret it.","This is. Absolutely a must stop and enjoy the views and the cocktails, food and the great team. It is tucked away gem but worth it !"
Sue,Really great trainee served us and he was super polite and attentive. Nice atmosphere live band and drinks at sunset food was great too
Great birthday dinner,Thanks to Anna and the team for a great night! Very much enjoyed the signature prawn angle hair dish!
"Great view, great food","Great view, great service, great food. We were here at sunset and it‚Äôs was absolutely magnificent. The food came out really quickly. The staff were very attentive."
Great views ‚Ä¶ but not welcoming,"The staff on arrival were unfriendly and unwelcoming staff. Great views though, wish the experience had been more welcoming."
Best place to come for weekend night,"View, food , music and the services(asmera) were very nice.Best place for the weekend night!loved it!"
Mixed with some instances of greatness,"Our experience was very mixed. Some great points and some not so great. Overall the way I would describe it is that they let inexperienced trainees interact with the customers and as soon as something goes wrong, a competent person steps forward.

This was our experience:

- Hostess greets us with a request for our passport numbers or to see our contact app on our phone. This was the first place after a week of dining out in Singapore that we‚Äôre asked for either and certainly not mentioned when I made the reservation. I manage to dig out our passport numbers from my phone but at this point the hostess has lost interest and takes us to our table.

- We order cocktails. My wife‚Äôs drink shows up after about 10 minutes. My wife can see mine sitting on the bar but no one gets it. Finally after mentioning it to our waitress who says the bartender still needs to add a final touch (really?), she brings it.

- We order appetizers and entrees and are asked if we want them together or one at a time. We say one at a time, and my wife‚Äôs appetizer and fish entree are brought at the same time. We send the fish back and of course when it‚Äôs brought at the appropriate time it‚Äôs overcooked and cold. It‚Äôs sent back but this time the chef comes out to make sure it‚Äôs ok and it‚Äôs perfect.

- We order a bottle of wine. Our waitress can‚Äôt figure out how to use the wine opener. She gets someone who does, and then it‚Äôs fine.

- The food ultimately was excellent and the real stand out was the music. Also, one of the experienced waitresses offered to take our photos and made sure we were standing in the perfect spot.

- The night we were there, the cable car was not running. Could not get a cab up there. Heard something about a shuttle but no real communication. Seems like on a night like this they would have either arranged for taxis or had better communication regarding a shuttle. We decide to walk down to the metro.

Overall, it was ok, but we kept feeling that the ‚Äúchildren‚Äù were left in charge and that they had to call ‚Äúmom or dad‚Äù when things went wrong."
Perfect view and great staff,"Bar has great view of scenery! Staff was very hospitable especially Clarissa. I planned the visit ahead of time, and Clarissa was very helpful and accommodating To add, drinks and food were great!"
"Great food, Excellent Service and awesome view","Visited this place as recommended by few friends for a great scenic experience. This restaurant is awesome and brilliant in hospitality.
Was floored by the excellent service provided by Riva Mascarenhas who left no stone unturned to make us comfortable. This place has awesome view and great for sundowner.
The food taste excellent and they have some amazing cocktails to offer."
"Fantastic view, great food and amazing personnel","Fantastic place with a great view of the harbour. Personnel fantastic with the perfect touch. If you can only visit one restaurant while in Singapore, Dusk is the place for you!"
Good service,Excellent service. Beautiful view. Good food. Excellent location. It is good for family and business dinner lunch.
Great view and superb service!,"Stunning view with great service by Ajaib , David and crew, Always a pleasure to visit this place. Well done!"
Lovely dining experience,"Was here with a friend and was fascinated by the picturesque view afforded. Great service by the trainee staff, in particular, Zhan Xian, who were very attentive to our needs. Sure to return."
Good good at Dusk,Food is okays and the desert is extremely delicious. The duck should have lesser sauce and the fish should be harder. Other than that it‚Äôs super good
Great food and beautiful view,"I‚Äôve been here thrice and this place never fails to disappoint. Great food, beautiful sunset and great service by the staff. T"
Great dinner with a stunning view,Wei Xiang has been very attentive and helpful. The food is excellent and the colourful evening sky uplift the atmosphere after a tiring day. Will certainly come back again.
Terrible Experience!,"- waited around 10 minutes before we got a seat (even though we have our reservation and no one from the staff is approaching the entrance despite seeing us)
- we were then seated outside with a nice view but waited for 30 minutes without anyone taking our orders until we decided to leave"
"Great food, great view, we just need more Davids instead of Trainees","We had a great night with excellent food and a great view. We were served by David who was a shining light in the otherwise Trainee filled pool of waiters. Fully understanding the labor shortage in Singapore, it would be good for the trainees to aspire to have the same passion, customer focus and drive that David has. We will definitely come back with high hopes that the trainees have evolved in their journey towards customer delight."
Food,"The food was mediocre, however the service and the atmosphere was insane. Would recommend for couples to chill here."
Drench Dinner Night,"Visited Dusk Restaurant & Bar on 8th June 2022, I would like to specially commend a friendly staff name Dharimilah who attended to my table most of the time. Scenery were great and romantic facing towards Sentosa Island. As I observed the service staffs are very busy at all time due to shortage manning which is understandable.

Heavy downpour on the night which was a challenge to the team and I‚Äôm amazed on how it was reacted promptly such as relocating all the patrons sitting near the railing and ensure no unattended belongings, knowing the condition tend to get freezing they literally offered free hot drinks for all which is beyond extra mile of service. Do express my gratitude to the team for such ‚ÄúUn-Norm‚Äù wonderful drench experience."
Friendly staff and awesome food,Meals were fantastic with good scenic view of vivo/harbourfront. The staffff were extremely friendly and helpful
Dinner with a View & Taste,"6 pax have a May birthday celebration at Dusk on a Saturday evening. We have a table with unblocking sunset view.

Ordered Dinner set , portion and taste was great. No corkage charges for our wine. Live performance even sing birthday song for May Birthday babies. Excellent service crew

Definitely will come back again.

It was the views that made it passable...,"First, the views are outstanding and you'll be taking more than just a few shots here. Really stunning and it's the high point of visiting Dusk.
Second. The food was pretty good. We went to the Chef's menu for our table if 4. We were told that there was not enough cod, and we opted for other menu items, Then we were told that there was enough cod. Phew. Relief. When the cod turned up, the serves were tiny. Did the chef simply cut the last cod portions into smaller portions? Disappointed? Indeed.
The fixed menu must have taken some thought to compile. The mid-menu sorbet palate cleaner did not arrive. When I asked about it, OI was told they would serve that with the dessert. Are you kidding? Are you having a. laugh? Serving the palate cleanser as a dessert...OMG x 2.
On the plus side, the cocktails are some of the best I've tasted. Try the smoking negroni...outstanding!
Third. The service. Very simply not up to the standard of this restaurant. Waiters could only carry 2-4 items, and we had to wait for the fourth item to arrive before we were all served and could start eating. If this was trainee night, we were not told...not the servers fault but management needs to be on top of this. It was unforgivable to have sub-standard service at a venue that exudes high expectations.
Fourth, and the absolute worst thing about the whole night, the live music, I went for dinner and a rock concert broke out. It was way too loud, totally distracting and ambience destroying, it made table conversation quite difficult. Was it open mc night? No complaints about the artists but the loud volume was out of place...just like the lacklustre service.
I'd recommend a visit to Dusk and I'll probably be back but it will be lunchtime when I can appreciate the views, and hopefully, without any ""background"" music.
Like my primary school report card used to say, lots of potential and high expectations but failed to deliver this time."
Great food and nice view,"Great food, nice view, hopefully the portion can be bigger considering is not very cheap haha. But still will return."
Excellent customer service,"Excellent food and service by david, mohd & Ajaib for their attentive service. My steak was initially well done. They changed it and it was a perfect experience always to dine here."
The Place To Be ..,"This restaurant doesn't only have a picturesque view but terrific food and amazing staffs! I would like to thank Mr. Ajaib and team for the great hospitality, recommendation of food and drinks + the lovely surprise of a birthday cake for my best friend's birthday. This place is very charming and romantic especially if you are bringing your loved ones. Perfect sunset and cozy ambience, away from the bustling city. Try their nitro drinks and deliciously dangerously addictive Dusk Signature Prawn Capellini! One of the best pasta I have ever had. Once again, thank you Dusk Restaurant and Bar + Mr. Ajaib and team for making a memorable birthday night for us."
Overall Great,"I had a reservation at 7pm, however it was not the seats by the view. When a couple that sat there was done with their meal, another couple shifted over. When i requested to be changed over, a waitress kindly helped me to check with her manager. However the manager told us that theres another reservation for this table hence we were unable to shift. I acknowledged & requested to just take a quick photo at that seat with the birthday cake and the waitress kindly offered to take the photos. However the lady in black shirt and specs suddenly ran over and shouted to us like ‚ÄúJUST A FEW MINS, HURRY, I GOT ANOTHER RESERVATION‚Äù impatiently.

Overall, the experience was great! Good server (2 girls in white uniform), good food, good view & good camerman (David).

However it was slightly affected when she came and shouted at us when we just started taking the photos. Its not like we were occuping for more than a minute, even more we were still having dessert and will be done with the seat in the next 10/15mins? Also we spend a good $200++ so its not justifiable on how she treated us. As someone working in the service line, this is not how you treat any customers. Later, another table near the view was cleared & the other table that came after us shifted over. I think its a messy arrangement that she rushed us yet there was another vacancy almost immediately. Altho i requested first but i didnt get it as theres a reservation, and when another table cleared, instead of offering to us, they allow another table to shift there.

Understand they are busy and its difficult to accomodate to everyone, hence kudos to the crew & the good cameraman/server David that rescued this unhappiness by taking some good shots for us."
Postcard view but rather odd crowd,"Dusk Restaurant and Bar: You are here for the dizzying panorama. I repeat. You are here for the dizzying panorama. The crowd is so hodge patch, I can‚Äôt put a finger on it. You have groups of families ranging from grandparents to kids for their expedition to the top. If you get that you don‚Äôt come armed with expectations, it‚Äôs OK really. The view is really good with the comings and goings of the cable cars. Novelty reigns with the nitro range of drinks. I had the Nitro test tubes which gives a bit of alchemy fun. Food is passable so head here to soak up the view. At sunset. #eatstylishtravelstylish"
Must Try!!!,Had a great time with my family at Dusk. Awesome food and service. Amazing view. Had my favorite Lamb shank and lobster meal. Out of the world. Staff were very friendly and fast to attend. Two thumbs up to Ajaib for his excellent service. Cheers.
Dinner,"We had a wonderful dinner with a great dining experience. Their friendly staff Dhanu took the initiative to move us to an empty table with a view overlooking the waterfront and cable cars. He is extremely patience by recommending the signatures dishes and the speciality drinks for instagrammable photos. We will definitely come back for meals.

Thank you for the excellent service and food."
An experience,Splendid view and fantastic cocktails! Had a wonderful time with the washing of cool breeze as we indulged in the beautiful skyline of the island‚Äôs horizon.
"Good view, comfort food","View is great as the sun sets, just a little warm in general. Satisfactory food quality. End the dinner with the watermelon mojito, refreshing and the watermelon cubes are brain freezingly good."
Good,"A place with nice view. The service is so good, special mention to the waiter Dhanu , Thankyou Dhanu üëçüèªüëçüèª"
2 very happy customers!,"Ambience was great! Waiting time for food was great! Didn‚Äôt have to sit long!

Service is excellent, special mention to this waiter, Dhanu. Extremely attentive to details, took note of where and how I want to be seated, and even noticed that my girlfriend‚Äôs sandals strap had broken, and provided tape to fix it.
Special mention to the manager as well who was willing to seat us although we were 30min late.

A place we would recommend with amazing food and even more amazing service!"
Great view! Attentive Service! Exceptional Food! What a great evening!,"What a great place with a beautiful panoramic view, together with top-notched service. Special mention to Ajaib for his attentive and kind assistance and service. And of course for the exceptional Dusk Signature Prawn Capellini! Look forward to visit you guys soon!"
Dinner with friends.,The food was excellent. The service was first class. We enjoyed the majestic view on top of Mount Faber and savoured the cuisines.
"Great view, great service , great camera-man :)",Very nice place to have a chilled evening out! Ajay was great at telling us what to order! We had a lovely time here!
Great Location. Excellent Food and Service,"We enjoyed our night out at this location. All staff so friendly , so happy to interact after the last lock down. Is was so good to feel human and be looked after.
Thanks to all staff for making it special."
Fabulous 5 course meal with a fantastic view,Reasonably priced restaurant. Suitable for groups and Singles. A Relaxed and serene atmosphere compared to noisy bars.
Definitely there will be 3rd time!,"Our second time there.

First time experience was so good, that we had to go there again. Albeit the first time we dined in a cable car as part of their SkyDining service.

I would like to make a special mention to one of their staff, Ms Pie, who is extremely helpful and I was told that she had extensively helped my husband in his preparation for the surprise SkyDining experience for me the first time round.

This time, Ms Pie and her manager (Mr David) had been exceptional in their service to us to ensure we had an enjoyable
evening.

Delicious food, great service, and lovely ambience.....the perfect recipe for a blissful evening we had there.

Will definitely be back there again in the near future !"
Very Romantic Place and Excellent Service - The Manager and Dusk Team.,"The food was so good good highly recommended their foods. The view is so romantic. The service was excellent , fantastic and they are so friendly also smiling. Caught their good vibes as customer. May God bless more all the people here and the business."
Honeymoon dinner at Dusk Restaurant and bar,"A very beautiful place. We were given a table in the middle initially, but so much help was given when we requested for a table with a view. Eventually we got one and we‚Äôre truly grateful. The food was amazing. The crew at Dusk were always ready to give service. We had fun and it was really pleasant experience. Thank you."
Wonderful Evening! Fantastic service by David T (Manager) & the Dusk Team!!,"While hiking on Mt Faber, we were lucky to get a table without a reservation. It was packed but the service team was wonderful and found us a table with a view in the uncovered area towards the rear - which was also full.
The weather started off great - cool and breezy but heavy rain started suddenly. The service team rushed to moved all the diners into the covered area - shifting tables, chairs, retuning into the rain to do so while getting themselves soaked. They even offered to replace dishes for guests due to it getting wet from the rain.
The heavy rain continued till closing. We had parked about a 15 mins walk away at a nearby parking lot. When the staff realized this, they advised the manager, David, who did everything he can to help us to get to our car.
At the end, an extremely kind lady who happened to be parked and waiting for someone gave us a ride, all the way around Mt Faber to our car. She refused any money for her trouble.
Turns out the lady was the Manager's friend and waiting for him!
For us, when dining out, it is about the entire experience - the food, the venue, the service... Dusk provided it all together perfectly.
David - you have a great service team at Dusk and a very kind friend. Thank you for a most memorable evening."
Great Dinner,From start to end the service and the food is really wonderful .For our waiter Dhanu really give a good service and even offer us a nice table .Sure we will be back again.It was a great birthday dinner celebration.Thanks to all the team member.
Dusk review,"Food wise, not fantastically wow. But they have really good scenery, if u opt for outdoor seat. You won‚Äôt be able to see the sunset from this restaurant btw, cause the sun sets behind the restaurant."
Total Rip-off,"From start to finish a sour experience: my girlfriend and me had reserved a sunset experience at Dusk, we decided to ride the motorcycle for a scenic evening, arriving at Dusk I saw another motorcycle parked behind cars and decided to park mine besides it... that's when the sour experience began: NONONONOOOOO motorcycle parking here, only for valet parking I was informed by an ultra rude parking assistant. I pointed out the fact that there was already a motorcycle present and happily parked. Ohhh NONONONOOO thaaaat was the valet's motorcycle, heeeee can park it there but not a paying guest. Eventually I had to drive half a km away and walk back
then we got the menu... the calamari offering was described very specifically: 8 rings of calamari... we ordered it and some truffle fries for starters...
8 hand counted chewy calamari rings baked into a soggy bread paste plus a cheap pre-fab sauce arrived accompanied by fries that had never seen a truffle but the taste made clear that the chef was a person of great economy... the oil must have made friends with many generations of chips
Long story short: a rude, over-priced rip-off place and tourist trap"
I proposed to my girlfriend here!,"The manager and staff were very helpful in facilitating the fruition of the proposal to my girlfriend. Of course we had to purchase a package deal with the restaurant but I guess it was fine. Once in a lifetime right? And not forgetting the splendid view, both day and night, from this restaurant. An awesome experience for the view. Good was okay."
Excellent dining experience,"I really love the food and staff here! The view is amazing too! Best place for all kind of celebrations! All the staff are so friendly and every time I come here, I feel like a VIP. Highly recommended for dating couples, married couples and family. I‚Äôm here to celebrate my friend‚Äôs birthday and they have definitely made my friend‚Äôs birthday celebration a memorable one! Good job!"
Nice food and view,The location not accessible but very nice view. Best time to visit at late evening. The food taste not fantastic but acceptable. The price also affordable.
A dusk evening to remember...,Ajaib n Zackiah was the epitome of what service with passion is all about. They made our dining experience a night never to be forgotten. Absolutely fine food served with attention to all finer details. Food was great n piping hot to the touch. Service .... impeccable couple with great recommendations... especially the chocolate dessert with a hint of Guinness‚Äô. You heard me!!! Yup!! A must try!!! Friendly n efficient staff to cater to our every needs. Wonderful dining experience one can only dream of. Did I forget to mention the view to die for.... Thank u. Will most definitely come again.
Beautiful Saturday dinner,"Beautiful Saturday dinner after cable car ride. Nice food, ambient environment, worth the visit and value!"
A beautiful Sunday dinner.,Cosy open air restaurant bar on Mt Faber . Great view and good food with freshly prepared ingredients. Every dish was good. Was very impressed. . Last time here was 2 yrs ago and now back again. Will definitely come again . Nice staff too. Great service . Indeed a pleasant dinner! Highly recommended.
Amazing sunset,Great location in Mount Faber gives a great view across to Sentosa. Staff were friendly. Food was nice
Great ambience,"Had a great time here and the staff were really helpful and polite.

Pros:
1. Views are great
2. Staff are really helpful
3. Food and drinks are great too

Cons:
The better seats might've been taken depending on the time."
"Good food, nice ambience","Nice place for a fine dinner with good ambience. Great food and excellent service by the staff named Jerry. Highly recommended, will definitely come again with my family."
excellent service crew who know how to take photos,"was served by 2 service crew members; 1 middle-age man (whom I forgot his name) and 1 young lady. The middle-age man definitely made our day with his humour and his advice on food selection (including sharing with us that the lobster was on 50% discount). We had a great meal and probably all the crew members at Dusk knows where's the best spot for photos and knows how to take photos.

both of the service crew members who served us had very amazing photo-taking skills. also, they were also very candid and forthcoming on the discounts available (e.g. which credit card has discount, how to claim free parking) which made our meal even more enjoyable.

Well done! and we certainly will be back soon. :)"
Confused,"This restaurant is very confused about its purpose. It presents itself as a high end romantic restaurant and all of the PR - even pieces in the last month - emphasise premium culinary credentials with dishes such as ‚Äúwine poached oysters‚Äù and ‚Äúcrab and mango stack‚Äù. The photography is similarly well done with cream sofas in the foreground and the sunset.
Sadly, the reality is more like a sports bar, with scuffed up old tables, everyone in flips flops and shorts, and a menu that is consists of average bistro fare at best - deep fried calamari, chicken wings and jalape√±o poppers, a couple of chicken/steak dishes, and some token ‚Äútapas‚Äù (a sideplate of melted cheese that apparently passes for a raclette, and a bland salsa with a couple of barely toasted slices of French bread). It would have been underwhelming at the best of times, but having dressed up for the ‚Äúromantic spectacle‚Äù the PR invites, it was a massive disappointment. We had a few drinks and gave up - drove into town to find a restaurant that actually matched the promises it made. The place needs to decide what it wants to be - snacks and lager for day trippers to Sentosa, or a restaurant really geared to the experience they advertise. Please choose, then deliver on that promise."
"Great place to chill, watch view & sunset, reminds me of the Peak in HK","Great place for chill while watching the view of singapore, sunset and for catchup. Amazing place with good place especially staff name David. Thank you for your great service, making the evening more enjoyable"
Paying for the view.....,"Paying for the view.....

The initial meet and great was fairly abrupt, lacked warmth but without being rude. The food quality was pretty average - the burrata was served very cold, the raclette ended up being a plate of melted, congealed cheese and the calamari looked (and tasted) store bought and deep fried.

Great for sundowners, but I‚Äôd suggest skipping the food."
One of the best restaurants to watch sunset,"You can tell from the name of the restaurant that this is one of the best places to watch the sunset in Singapore. It would be a great dining experience if you are lucky to catch the beautiful sunset while enjoying the meal, overlooking the beautiful harbour. But the problem is this restaurant is very popular and you have to book in advance and the weather is not in your control (weather forecast is not accurate here). The prices are reasonable, services are okay, and the food tastes good, but not amazing. Happy hour(5-8pm) alcoholic beverages are excellent value for money. We had a pre-meal walk from Hort Park to Mt Faber Peak, an extra 1.5 hours before dinner. It was a great walk, shady along most of the paths."
Engagement Celebration at Dusk Restaurant and Bar,"We had a family dinner celebration with family members over our son's engagement to his wife to be last Saturday. David Tan, the restaurant manager made the event very special for the happy couple.The weather was perfect that evening and the view at sunset was stunning from the restaurant terrace area. David deserves our compliments for his impeccable service even helping to take nice photos for us which made that happy occasion a memorable event for the family.Pity we couldnt have a bigger gatheirng than permitted due to Covid19 restrictions. Once the health and safety issues are resolved it would be lovely to return to the restaurant for a bigger event like a birthday or anniversary celebration.Kudos to David, server Jerry and the other enthusiastic restaurant staff (whose names I unfortunately can't recall).. for creating a truly wonderful experience for all of us."
Nice view,"We were lucky to get a seat with a nice view without reservation on a Wednesday night all thanks to the superb service of Zakiyyah! She asked us before she cleared any plates from the table and checked what we need. However, not all the staff is like this unfortunately. When we first requested to move to an empty table, another staff said it was reserved but obviously not. He simply rejected without checking. There was also another staff just cleared the utensils in a very insensible way (when we were still eating and had food on the table) and we had to ask him to clear the table when he served new cuisine, thought he could be more proactive and caring.

Great view, lovely romantic ambience was lovely and good food. Management please improve customer service and learn from Zakiyyah please!"
Bad Customer Service,"Note: Rating based on the Service received alone.

Emailed the restaurant and dropped a message through the One Faber Group website to inquire if they could support a private event, however have yet to hear from them even after a month - with the only reply being that from a Guest Relations Supervisor looping the Restaurant Manager into the email thread. Extremely tardy customer relations, will likely look for other venues to dine at in the future."
Had drinks with amazing view,People are great and service was prompt. Food menu was towards bar bites and Western style. Had 2 beers.
Great views. But that's it.,"The restaurant is surviving purely on its views. Because the food here sucks. They can't even get basic fries right. Terrible, terrible food. But if views are all that you want, I suppose you could go here if you dont mind paying a lot of money."
attitude sucks,"walked in, the Indian guy at the bell gave a vibe that they dont need guests anymore as they are full. After insiting took the number and name and conveyed that wait will be for an hour though saw my name in the list as 2nd in waiting list. Got a call in 10 mins saying table is free but luckily we had got a taxi down to Harbour Front by then......."
Mediocre,The service was quite nice but overall the atmosphere was not particularly romantic. more like a local hangout place. food was quite disappointed. view was nice. make sure which area you are sitting coz the vibe is quite different from in door versus outdoor.
"Romantic place , warm & attentive service",Special compliments kudos to Jerry & Grace for their pleasant demeanour and service. Their exceptional service provided a very enjoyable experience. Very enjoyable and chill out with my friends celebrating my birthday. Great dining experience.
Food was great!! Amazing service!!,"Food was great!! Amazing service!! Especially thanks for GRACE, JERRY and the TEAMS!! We had Super wonderful time and Happy Hours here!! We definitely will be back here again."
"Beautiful view, Great service extremely small portions of food",Nice place to chill after 4pm. Service and drinks are good. Food is extremely expensive for the quality and quantity.
Superb service!,"The team made us feel welcome from the very start. We booked under the Save-The-Date promotion which was worth every dollar. In addition to the view, the duck confit and cheesecake was lovely, and the wine pairing was great! Thank you for the lovely experience."
"Perfect view, with tip top service","Came for an early dinner, staff were accomadating and thoughtful. Despite being full house for the day, they squeezed a table out just for us. Staff Ajaib was really thoughtful when he even offered cushion for my pregnant wife."
"Great View, Moderate Service","Celebrating my birthdqy with my love one at this restaurant because the view is fantastic. Suggest to make reservation prior visiting as it is popular and the place might be full. Thank you for getting us a nice view table that night.

Everything was good except one thing which is we have ordered a Cabernet Sauvignon 2015 based on the menu however we're given year 2017 and definitely the taste is different. Reason given by the restaurant staff was: ""That was what the supplier had given us, we do not have year 2015.""

What i am surprised is we were not informed by the staff who took our order when they know that i have ordered for year 2015 and i was not offered whether to choose another bottle as an alternative. No apologise was given to me.

For those who are thinking to order a bottle wine while you are dining, remember to reconfirm with the staff as their digital menu may not be the latest."
Restaurant with Sunset view but no personalization touch,"I chose this restaurant mainly because of the view and I booked a table yesterday for my Hubby‚Äôs birthday celebration. I made reservations via Chope one month ahead and mentioned it was for a birthday celebration and requested for table with view.

Sadly, this was not addressed and we were given some high chairs table which was right at the back. I was kinda disappointed as Ambience to me is very important as it was for birthday celebration. Well, I must say I reserved the table at 6.15am but reached only at 7pm as we waited 40mins for the cable car ride. However, I did call 2 times to inform about my delay and I was just wondering if they did take my request or not. I just find there was no personalization touch. I don‚Äôt like the phone booking system whereby it‚Äôs only until 7pm and I experienced no one to answer the call on Sat afternoon and I have to keep calling. I am also unable to change the timing for my reservation via Chope.

Anyway, we enjoyed the food which was good (limited varieties) and the service provided was quite good."
Lovely breezy evening!!,Go for the view & the lovely staff!!! Stunning setting with a breezy vibe & very friendly staff!! Calamari is delicious and the mocktails we're super good!! Will dedwho again!! Best time definitely around 6:45pm to catch the sunset!!
"Great view, average food","The view from Mt Faber is always nice (by Singapore standards), especially at sunset.
The staff are friendly & helpful.
The seating is outdoor but generally cool due to a nice sea breeze.
The cocktails are okay but the wine selection is poor.
The food was a mixed bag with some dishes being poor & some average.
Guess they're relying on the location!"
Magnificent View Whilst Dining,"I can guarantee what attracts most, if not all customers to this restaurant is its view from the top of Mount Faber. One can admire the magnificent view of the harbour as well as catch a glimpse the island of Sentosa as you wine and dine.

My dining companion and I were welcomed into the restaurant by a cheerful hostess. She even recommended that we sit facing the view to take full advantage of the evening sunset.

The western menu features a wide variety of seafood and meat dishes. We started with the Toasted Ciabatta Bread, followed by the Soup of the Day, Pumpkin Soup; and the Oven Roasted Chicken Poulet. Refreshing mocktails are also available for teetotallers in addition to the usual range of wines and spirits.

We thought the bread could have been served with butter, or olive oil and vinegar. The soup was tasty and the portion size of the chicken quite substantial. I loved sipping the refreshing mocktail as we approached the end of the day.

After spending time walking to Henderson Waves and back, this was the antidote most welcomed."
Another perfect evening with David and his team in Dusk,"Last Thursday we had another perfect evening out at Dusk.
This has become our favorite place in Singapore.
Food is good, beers are cold and there is a nice selection of cocktails and wines.
But what put this place on a much higher level than most bars and restaurants is the staff, they are exceptional.
Great job from David who manages the place, he's always friendly, ready to advice with selection of food or drinks.
Keep up the good work and see you soon ;-)

Very romantic restaurant,This restaurant was a nice find. It cost is $10.00 taxi from Santos island. The food was fantastic and good serves. The view is wonderful and the restaurant was all couples . The service was amazing. This is one restaurant. I will be returning
YES I DO PLAN,It was a unplanned setup from Dusk Restaurant & Bar~ But it was definitely an successful proposal from HTB & Dusk‚Äôs team! A big thank you to David & Zakiyyah! The friendliness & professional! Thumbs up!
"Great view, nice starters and friendly service","Dusk restaurant on top of Mount Faber is for sure worth a visit. When the sun sets and lights down at the harbour turns on the view is astonishing. Take a table outside if weather so permits but ensure your seating by prebooking. Starters are a treat but at least I was not too impressed by the mains, had a steak but do not recommend. Perhaps only go for a bigger selection of starters. Service is excellent and stuff have the right approach ;) Possible to take the cable car down instead for waiting for a taxi."
"""Wow""","Wow..... called in for a drink after finishing off the cable cart, caught sunset here, what beautiful views, reasonably priced, food looked good as well and would have eaten here had we not already eaten elsewhere. Really nice and polite staff, I recommend this as a must do for anyone visiting Singapore."
