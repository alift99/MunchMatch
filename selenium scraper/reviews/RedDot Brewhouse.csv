topic,review
10/10 beer.,All beer options here are incredible and amazed me everytime I was given the chance to taste them. Best beer in Singapore and best beer I have had worldwide.
Very slow service,"Food is ok. But was displeased with 2 things
- when taking our order, waitress did not note it down on paper or in ipad. I thought she could remember (like most experienced staff), but she had to come back and make us repeat our order. The issue is if she cannot remember, then note it down somewhere.
- very slow service. We asked for water, but had to wait long and reminded 3 times before it comes. It also took a while for the staff for the billing process to be completed."
Great for craft beers.,"We stopped here a couple of times for drinks whilst in Singapore.

Red Dot is apparently Singapore's first locally owned, independent commercial microbrewery, and they serve really a really good choice of Beers, my favourite being their Summer Ale! They also serve food although we only had drinks whilst there.

Located on Boat Quay, they have both indoor and outside seating area, directly overlooking Boat Quay, which contains many bars and restaurants.

Great place to cool down with a good beer or glass of wine!"
What a great little place,"What a great little place this is. We spent an evening there. Great food and an excellent selection of beers, some brewed on the premises. Food was good quality and the setting which was on the riverside was second to none. Can’t fault the staff and the quality of the food and drink. We really enjoyed our evening here."
Good selection,"They have a nice patio sitting, good seelction of craft beers and good nibbles. With the view, you cannot ask for more."
Green Beer,"Friends local to Singapore took me to RedDot Brewhouse for a green beer one night in December. The beer was okay, the view was beautiful, and the company was fantastic!"
Exceptional Singapore brewed beer with fantastic crew!!,"Love having conferences in Singapore! Was recommended RedDot brew house @ Boat Quay. They have sample shots of their many different beers, how ingenious! Was blown away by some amazing brews!! Who would have imagined, an ale brewed with wine yeast? Try the award winning Sauvignon Ale! Must thank Su and her staff for the great, great service too. I was very impressed by the whole experience! *Oh oh, amazingly detailed website describing their beers!"
Requested seating arrangement,"Maybe i was not specific enough when requesting for a cozy quiet corner by the riverside, but i thought this phase is simple enough to understand.
Anyway, was arranged to seat between 2 tables with one of them so close, only 2 inches distance away. Soon after, I spotted the customers of a table just besides the riverside leaving soon and immediately asked to change the seats.
Seating location to me plays an important part to the whole environment experience. Hope this can be further improved whenever there is a booking being made."
Nice food and excellent setting at the riverside,"After a few days of eating at the hawkers we needed to indulge ourselves in some western food,

An excellent setting on the Bank of the river against a back drop of the illuminated city we dined on fried chicken and burgers... all very tasty and supported by quick service.

We didn’t try the green ales but they seemed popular."
Cold beer & nice views,"Close to our hotel so we popped in here several times during our stay. The food was normal pub fare but quite alright. Some of the interesting beers they had ran out of but we had the IPA with sorghum (? I think) and the green beer with blue-green algae in it, better tasting than the water in the marina but the same colour. I think this place is really good but could step up to the next level by embracing the craft beer revolution a bit more and trying to produce new flavours instead of rehashing old ones.

The services here was excellent at any time of the day and by different staff."
Lunch was good,"Had lunch set menu of Striploin steak. It was good, slightly overcooked for medium rare but still tasty and soft.

The highlight was the Marzen (Reddot Octoberfest Amber Lager) beer.
Very easy to drink, clean with a great taste of toffee.

Was looking forward for the Redot Grand stout reserva, but they are out....maybe next time."
Bad experience,"Booked a table for 6 on 11 oct at 1930hrs. Upon reaching there, we waited very long for our table to be ready. Waited around 20 minute and still got no table available. End up we left that place in disappointment."
Excellent,This is an excellent place to eat drink and meet people A must for sports lovers with all major sporting events covered on many large Screens Or sit outside by the Quay undercover Brilliant selection of food and try. We tried the locally brewed Reddot Wheat Beer can not speak to highly of it
Dinner at Boat Quay branch,"Colleagues not knowing their job knowledge well, food wasn’t as great as previously had in Dempsey hill. Dry n unglam"
Good place to grab a drink,"We were walking along the water and stopped in the RedDot. The drinks prices were on the high side, but i guess you are paying for the location. The service was good."
Creative craft brews,I came here and had the biggest flight and best service. They have creative ideas for beer...such as spirulina and sauvignon blends. Worth a visit. Plus there are waterfront views.
Awesome place!,"RedDot never fails to amaze over the years. Super amazing food, beer and staff who always outserve all the customers:) Thank you team!"
Quite good,Food and place is nice to chill and eat. But hygiene need to maintain as I saw mice running around near kitchen area
"Awesome location, good service and decent beer",The location of this place looking out over Boat Quay is quite stunning. They have a sizeable collection of core beers and a small number of specials. The core beers are not so great in my opinion but they occasionally have some tasty specials. Service is generally very good here as are the bands that play. I stop by this place occasionally for the special beers but for anything else there are better options. Prices are reasonable considering the location.
Great Night with Great Friends,It was a great night together with my friends and business partners.. We were greatly accommodated.. Staffs a cheerful and friendly.. Place and location are so nice.
Reservation should be taken into priority,Made reservation but table was not ready. Made to sit another table and moved us when there is table available. If such instances better not to have reservation platform because knowing there is reservation should not let other diners because one won't know how long the diners would be at and not hold up the reservation. Service and food was good to make up for the lacked of consideration in terms of the reservation.
Very Nice Promotion Treat,"No regrets changing venue from a 6 star hotel buffet to red dot. The food here is great - our celebrity promoted colleagues knew what to order:
Beef and chicken satay
Truffle fries
Sauteed mushrooms
Pork slices
Chicken wings
Meat lovers pizza
Sausages
Everyone had their choice of drinks
The service was prompt and responsive. But there is no aircon and really hot inside...just our luck given the super hot and humid weather now.
I think the food is quite good relative yo the other joints along boat quay and don't mind coming back again for dinner."
Amazing view,Good food and drinks nice atmosphere value for money tasty hamburgers nice bars nearby for drinks after food
Good beer & food,"RedDot Brewhouse has a wide range of beers. We tried a few and all were very good. They have a green beer - it is very green - which was interesting to look at - although we didn't try it a table behind us drank quite a lot of it!

They have a food menu and we had a couple of snacky bits - wings and cauliflower cakes - both were very nice.

Good views from the outside eating area.

Staff very good and friendly. Brew kit on show.

Toilets - surrounded by a goldfish pond!"
Red Dot Craft Beer,"Really nice craft beer bar in a great area in the Boat Quay! Great beer and cool area to people watch right by the water.

Had their really nice green lager, pale ale and wheat beers! All tasty and reasonably priced!

Great live music band and good pub fare if u r hungry.

Excellent service too!"
great place for locals drinks on the river,this is a great place to catch up and enjoy some local beers on the river in a friendly place service isn't great but the location and beers are!
Amazing service with Live Music,"Although the venue was extremely busy as it was a Friday night, the staff were very accommodating for my elderly mother. Initially, they wanted to seat us upstairs because they were very full but my mother really wanted to sit outside and enjoy the evening watching people pass by. Rather than have us leave the staff were able to accommodate my mother's wish. It was a beautiful night and the view of the river was magnificent. We ordered chips and wedges. Also the following pizzas: Hawaiian, Mediterranean and Pulled Pork. The pizza crust was crunchy but there was not a lot of topping on them. The venue also had live music which was enjoyable to listen to. The service was exceptional it is a shame that we didn't really enjoy our meal."
A great place to watch the world pass by,Ideal for people watching and drinking decent quality beer. Service was very good and the bar snack side orders were good. The Ver hot chicken wings are..…...very hot! On the hour there was a water show to music from the river opposite (evenings) plus the river traffic to keep you occupied.
Compliments,I would love to shout out extensively to Nishant. He is the only main reason why I’m back to frequent this bar every week. It was never the ambience or the company I was with. He has an extraordinary touch to customers which was beyond explanations. His service and personal touch for customers was impeccable. It was something worth every bit of my bones to be complimented for someone of such value in this given industry. Major cheers.
Gathering for Year End,"Good location near Raffles Place MRT. Good food nice scenary by the river. Good service. Place for chill, gathering. Reserve table if big group."
A microbrewery at Boat Quay serving unique Green Beer!,"We stopped by at this Brewery at Boat Quay for their 'Green Beer' ,which is infused with Spirulina ( an algae) imparting it the unique green color...flavor wise there was no distinct taste...but it was refreshing!
Spirulina has many health benefits, not sure if those are extended to the beer ...
Refer to the photos for the origin of this brewery.
Menu looked good too ...would love to try their other beers and food on my next visit."
Everything’s great,"Great ambience, excellent customer service, awesome food! Special compliment to Nishant who served us - he is indeed a great asset to the company, great customer service is in his DNA!!! Well done folks, keep it up!"
microbrewery in Singapore,"enjoyed live entertainment and really good local brew here. situated a couple blocks from the business center on boat quay, a strip if restaurants on a boardwalk. nice nightlife and a young vibe."
Quick lunch,"We had the Summer Ale which was very good and a two course set lunch. The soup was fine, as was my salad. The Pork was also good with lovely mash and greens. An easy and inexpensive lunch in a pleasant setting."
Monster beer!!!!,"The brewery is situated right in the street of Boat Quay where there are a lot of pubs and bar but only here you can taste several craft beers!!! The green lager one, called Monster, is their logo because a green beer is not so usual to find but i prefer other kind of beer: Lime Wheat, Weizen or the special Red Dragon brewed for special event such as the Indipendence party last 17th. What to eat??? try their Grill menu, the Reddot beer Sausages are fantastic!!!"
Fantastic old fashion and Singapore sling,"Was told by friends that cocktails here were great. Indeed it IS! Had the best sling tasted in town made by barista Andrew compared to others and the ever changing taste of old fashion, from strong to mild and the sweet after taste that kicks in after awhile! Definitely recommend"
Good Beer,This is a great spot for a cold beer and people watching but service is suspect most of the time and food is not the best option. I have tried several of the beers and they have all been good including the lovely green one they off.
BEST SERVICE STAFFS AND BEST BEERS IN TOWN,"Staff Manager Su, Staff Nishan, Christine n Bar Staff Andrew n many more and part timer too. My favourite Monster beer and now after 1 yr my most favourite Dragonfruit beer r back to celebrate Singapore tasty n let me remember Reddot n National Day celebrstion."
Account,It is quite a beautiful riverview place，be warmly treated，cheese fries and sausage is my favorite，got service from Andrew，nice making several cocktails and recommend green beer to us，so special experience and good atmosphere sittting indoors watching the football and enjoy the food and drinks，now we always had a few happy hours there when off work，become our best place for company’s dinner！
Fabulous Sling,"Trying to get a decent sling information Singapore was not too easy. So when we had one here I can't tell you how happy I was many thanks to our lovely server, Harry who on our last evening remembered us. We didn't eat there but food looked good."
"Great ambiance, so-so beer","Lovely location, like you're in the middle of the jungle. Nicely lit, very cozy at night. Being a local microbrew fan I was excited to try their beer offerings. Sadly, the beers were a disappointment. The weizen was probably their best one, but the IPA was not good."
nice beers,"I went here by accident, was having e scooter with my boy and raining. I tried their beers and were so good... Service was also excellent... must try, much better than common local and bottled beer in the market"
Amazing venue for every event,Excellent service especially by Nishant ...love the place will be back very soon it has an amazing vibe.. great staff ..best place in Singapore
Interesting beers,Beers were different from the rest found on the stretch. Modestly priced but felt they didn’t match my tastes.
Just poor overall,"Food - not good
Service - worse

After one round of drinks, we asked to see the menu and were given the bill instead.
After a very long wait for food, we were presented with tiny portions that are apparently ‘normal for Singapore’

This place doesn’t even try to do customer service"
Loved it!,"My husband and I visited RedDot on our honeymoon in Singapore. We reserved a table via email and were pleased when we arrived as we were led to one right next to the river, overlooking a beautiful view of Singapore by night. The waiter who had reserved it for us was lovely and very attentive. The food was brilliant - we love a hearty meal and it was certainly provided. We also enjoyed trying their green beer! The views, atmosphere and food were wonderful and the service was second to none. We would recommend RedDot 100 times over."
Green beer,"Nice chill place by the Boat Quay river, friendly service staff, and the interesting tasty green beer."
Green beer and summer ale,"Once in a while I will pop back into RedDot Brewhouse, I've known them for ages and their green beer is always a novelty (read the unusual description).

I love their sichuan pepper chicken and fried whitebait - the rest of the food is okay, you're here to drink more than you are to eat!

One of the best kept secrets is the third floor of the shophouse - while only open to events, it is a beautiful space with a high ceiling and all the supporting equipment you need. Do have a look if you ever want to plan an event in Boat Quay area."
Good beers,"Not a bad stop. They have some good beers on tap. I tried the Pilsner and I had the lime wheat which was refreshing in the heat. There's inside and outside seating. There are a ton of foreigners here, the food looked pretty American (burgers, fries, etc.) so we just had a beer here. Not bad for drinks, they do cost around 9USD."
"Beers = Yes, Foods = No","We went there to try the Monster Lager (Green beer) and had a chance to try other beers as well. Overall, it was great.
The atmosphere is very nice as the location is beside the river.

Foods were a bit disappoint for me. We did order finger foods and some snack to eat with beers but they were like cooking from freeze food.

So they do a good job in beers."
A pleasant bar with excellent food,"We visited for lunch with our son, daughter in law and baby granddaughter on a very hot day. We were given a table inside where it was cool for the baby. The staff were really welcoming, the set lunch was absolutely lovely and the other food we saw coming out looked delicious. Our set lunch of smoked salmon followed by Seabass was excellent and the price was only $16 per head. There’s a good choice of beers and also wine and soft drinks. A really good place to eat and drink on Boat Quay where you have to be careful about being exploited by some of the eateries."
Good bar in great location,"We tried a couple of the craft beers here, including the famous green beer, and they were all excellent. Also had a pizza which was good without being exceptional. Staff friendly and service prompt. The location, particularly if you are seated outside, is great."
Relaxing Drink by the Waterside,"Ideal location to stop for a refreshing drink.
Sit and watch the river boats going past.
If you're lucky enough you could see a few river otters swimming by.
They have a microbrewey on site - toilet facilities clean.
S$45 for gin and tonic, magners and a wheat lime."
"Nice views over the river, nothing else positive","Nice central location with river rides over boat quay. That’s all of the positives about this restaurant.

Food - service slow, attention to detail lacking, some products of poor quality.

Service - horrific, possibly the worst I’ve experienced in Singapore.
Staff are inattentive, unhelpful and refuse to take ownership. For example, when asking for the menu and being brought the bill - I don’t think that they could make it clearer how unwelcome guests are and how much of an inconvenience they are to the staff"
Thank you very much,"Thank you very much for the unique experience. The Green Monster Lager looks good. Then, I just started by for that. Yes, it looks good and it tastes natural as usual. Interesting experience it was. Thank you very much"
Pretends to be a Craft Brewery,"When visiting other countries I'm keen to see what they have byway of craft beer. The RedBot was written up as a place to try. Visited this one and found the staff knew nothing about beer. Has awards all over the walls and looks good. But all form and no substance. Asked for a dark beer and was offered a lager? Has the IPA it was ok. Yep, I'm a bit of a beer snob, but if you say your a craft brewery got some people serving that at least know the difference between and IPA, Larger and Porter."
Nice view,"Very nice view near by the river. And good beer (specially the green beer).very good server, (Nishant) smiley face"
OK beer with woeful service,"Meet and greet fine. Taken to waterfront table with beer menu and then ignored for 15 minutes. 3 other tables arrived after us and were served before us. Second beer required much waving of arms to attract waitstaff.

Seasonal beers advertised as available were not available. So standard range only which was ok but not great for the two types we tried.

Abandoned visit and went elsewhere.

This is the second time I have been to this bar and I had a similar experience last time. I won't bother again."
Excellent Bar and Restaurant,"We had a really excellent meal in Red Dot Brewhouse in our favourite part of Singapore, Boat Quay.
Great beers on tap as you'd expect from a Brewhouse! A huge choice of beers, ales, stouts and IPA's.
The food was excellent. Great steaks, chicken dishes, pastas and plenty of salad dishes.
The views of the river and along boat quay are fantastic, as good as it gets - so make sure you get a table outside at the water's edge.
Great atmosphere here, excellent prompt, friendly service. We really liked it and only for the fact it was our last night, we'd definitely have gone back. I will next time I'm in Singapore though!"
Great Beer; Great Food,Loads of choice in the area but took a punt on this place and was very pleased to do so. Very tasty burger and good local beer. Spam Fries a bonus!
"Good beers, weak service","The selection of in-house brewed beers was good. Recommend you sample a variety of their beers. However, be prepared to wait a while for your order to be taken or even to be acknowledged by the staff. They are willing to attract you in to their establishment but once in, you are nothing."
Great Craft Beer and Good food as well,"We loved this place so much we went twice.
Great place with seating inside and also outside on a deck by Boat Quay.

Good range of Craft Beers that tasted great and were nice and cold on a hot day.

The food is also pretty good with some of the best Onion Bhaji we have had and the Pork belly and Burgers are also very good as well.

Great spot for Beer O’clock."
A great brewery in Singapore,"Cannot resist visiting other micro breweries and this one is great, interesting range of beers but nothing with a very high IBU rating though the IPA was really good. Fast efficient service for food at sensible prices.
Need to return and try all the other beers in particular the green one"
Green beer house brew,Really nice place and nice atmosphere for the happy hour. Lots office people just right at 4:30/6 pm Beer / BB pork... perfect combo. Thịs is Dempsey area and lots other Resturance and bar in this park. Lovely park to walk around....
Craft Beer in Green Color?!?!?!,"Craft Beer in Green Color? The House Brew just simply attract me with the color, never have any before this."
Great Red Dot Burger,"Had the urge for a burger and chips and the RedDot delivered 'just what the doctor ordered' ... a big succulent burger and tasty chips ... washed down with a delicious blended lychee drink ...

If you are after something slightly quirky then try the green beer.

Very attentive, friendly and prompt service too.

PS Boat quay is a vibrant location with a wide variety of restaurants perched by the water's edge with an impressive view of the Fullerton Hotel and river area. The surrounding circuit is also a good place for a post prandial walk after a big dinner."
Good reviews,"Service, food and ambience were great and worth a visit! Would definitely recommend my family and friends to visit! Great experience! Salted egg pizza was a to-order food as it is a comforting food for me!"
"GREAT SERVICE, LOVELY AMBIENCE","Nishant is the BEST service crew I have ever met - he greets you by name, attention to detail - the view by the river is lovely - what a great place to be. Suzzane, the manager who makes you feel at home - I am just.. amazed. Lovely place in Singapore to be. Red dot boat quay, everyone is so nice I wish I could spell everyone by name. Definitely a choice place to be in singapore. Microbrewery, local beer (they have special hidden beers - ask them for it). Cheers everyone, drink up!"
Best Service Ever,Server Nishant and Manager Suzanne are the sweetest darlings ever!! Always making us feel welcomed and at home whichever day of the week. Ever ready to offer comfort whether you're heartbroken or jammed with work. Will always recommend!! Thumbs up!! 👍🏻
Nice bar with good food at BQ,"I like the food at this place. They have the own brewed signature beers, including the famous (brewed only there) Green beer - made from Spirulina algae :) Not my fav beer, but definitely something to try if you are visiting Spore."
Nice place,Beer and sausages were great! Carbonara were also good. Rest is pretty much same as all other places around this area.
5 Years and counting on,"Been chilling here for more than 5 years with my friends. Ambience is nice. Food and beer choices are excellent. Love the fried silverfish, fries, nachos plus monstergreen! Live music on weekends are a must to hear too!"
casual chat,"Drinking by the river in boat quay is enjoyable

RedDot service is fine and prices are kept fair for the location

Whether it is a stop or a long halt, you will find a beer to your taste and the lights of the evening will make the place welcoming

Cheers!"
Good and chilled out,"Tried the green beer with Spirulina which was interesting. Food is good. Overall, nice place to hand out with friends."
Perfect relaxing stop,"A perfect stop at the area for relaxing. Great view, service, food and beverage!
You can enjoy it both daytime and evening when its a little bit more crowded...but the view is even more amazing with the lights and bridge. The food is simple but tasty. The service is perfect! I have returning to this place all the time i visit Singapore."
Nice chillax place,"Overlooking the river at the outside seating or watching the band inside, it's a good place to just chill and relax whether you're alone or with friends. my friend tried the green monster and he said it was okay. I tried the very safe summer ale and I liked it."
"Amazing beers, and good food!","Try the Green Monster, a truly unique beer with spirulina added to it giving it a bright green color. It is a perfect gathering for friends, order a tower, and enjoy the live music!"
Just for the brews,We stopped in for a beer or two while we were out walking. We did not try any of the food but the beer was good.
Great location and food with flavour,"Let me start with if you are a lager lover (which my wife is) then this is not the place for you. Based on other review we started with the paddle taster selection and I really enjoyed the green beer and lime beer. What did catch me by surprise in a good way was the food, I had the spicy chicken wings which were full of flavour without the sauce, then the sauce made it amazing. We also had the truffle chips which were superb. All in all worth a visit if you have had enough Chinese or fish suppers on your stay."
Great beer. Bad service.,Was there on a Friday night. Literally no service happened which I have to pay for. The beers was really awesome though. Kudos to the master brewer.
Excellent Food and Drinks,"RedDot has some fine brewed beers, their monster beer is a must try with Truffle fries. Sunday is kids day RedDot has kids activities: Fishing, face painting, baking, crafts etc. it is fun for kids and parents can enjoy their drinks. Awesome location"
Great craft beer in a tourist area,"We liked the place so much we went twice on our recent holiday. The first time we sat and had a tasting paddle, and then a pint of our favourite beers next to the water. It was definitely the busiest spot on Boat Quay at this point! The beer is great, make sure that you try a taster/ a beer paddles before ordering...as I probably would have gone for the green beer had I not (it's a cool colour, but really didn't get much through on the taste). We later came back for a drink in the evening, it's really nice getting the buzz around the Quay, and the lights reflected on the water."
Terrible service,"Food and view is good but service is so bad it's almost comical! Tried to book table online which didn't work, then called which was answered by a very confused person who struggled to book the table. When arrived all orders slow or forgotten. Then we were told to leave a table at 10pm but they took ages to bring last drinks and bill. Then staff got frustrated with us! So rude"
Great craft beer house in Boat quay. Try before you buy! Chat to the barman for suggestions.,"Great bar in fab location on Boat quay. My boyfriend loves craft beer so we were aiming to visit a different craft beer establishment each day of our trip. This is the only Singaporean owed micro-brewery. Got chatting to the barman about what beers we liked and he allowed us to taste before we bought a full pint.
We liked the Seasonal brew-this one was whiskey oak aged. Also the lime-wheat- fabulous finish and also the banana and orange flavoured beer! Note this bar suggests food pairing for every beer but unfortunately we had just eaten. Go during happy hour and get chatting to the lovely and knowledgable staff!"
Loving the second floor!,"I've been to RedDot twice, and I definitely enjoyed my second time more. We picked a table on the first floor the first time we were there, but it was a little too noisy for our liking although the music was pretty good. We were seated on the second floor during our next visit, and it was definitely quieter! The ambience was great and we definitely had a great time with the food and drinks. If you like live music, you may prefer the first floor. Overall, the experience was pretty decent and I'll see myself back there again soon!"
Dinner @ RedDot Brewhouse,Very relaxing place to have dinner and beer after work. Prices are very reasonable and affordable. Certainly like to visit this restaurant again.
The best microbrewery in Singapore,"Don't bother with the others. The guys at Red Dot are the only ones in Singapore who use the right water for their beer, and 99% of what makes a good beer is in the water they use. I've been a regular here for years. If you spot a skinny Indian dude, do drop by and say hello."
Great hamburgers,"Had a late breakfast here , great hamburgers, full of flavour. Service was excellent, and of course the beer was good."
"Nice beer, awful food","We were looking to grab a quick snack as we arrived earlier that day. We had a meeting nearby the river and wandered around.

The place was the only place packed between the different outlets on the river so we decided to give it a try.

They have some interesting beers, I tried the green one which turned out to be very good.

Unfortunately the dining experience was a bit different. The food was oily, bad, with no taste. I had the chicken burger and I think I received some sort of an engineered kitchen. We also ordered the veggie burger which was basically 4 oily mushrooms.

Come for the beer and maybe the fries."
"Above average bar on Singapore's Boat Quay, Good but not ""Very Good""","I met up with some friends here for drinks on a Friday evening. The service is friendly and really pretty good. We didn't face any difficulties having a split bill.

This place is supposed to be a brew pub so I tried their IPA. It was really ""overhopped"" so I don't recommend it. I also had a couple of pints of San Miguel and those were OK. My bill for 3 pints ended up at S$39.00 which is actually considered quite reasonable in Singapore.

They have live music starting around 8pm, so if you're meeting here for a conversation that's worth knowing as you might have a hard time hearing each other when they are playing.

I would go here again. It's probably a better bet than some of the other places along the Quay."
Good Beer,Good microbrewery and in a great location. Try the Indian Pale Ale and a special green beer flavour.
Best place to be at Boat Quay,"Went in with a couple of friends on many occasion. The green monster is a must try, get the tower and it will be an interesting experience. The service is fast and the food is good, it has a nice view of the Singapore River and has a live band. The overall ambiance is the reason why the place is almost packed every weekend."
Nothing fantastic,"I went to this place with a few friends, cozy environment but nothing really fantastic. Lots more other places in Singapore with such ambience and at a cheaper price."
Excellent,Excellent food ever I had people very kindly and service long time no late no delay it was perfect time we were so hungry
best place to chill,had a fun birthday celebration over here. good food and good company in the best most chilled bar. Always pricey when having a dinner at boat quay. But its all good.
"Offering local beer, live music and finger snacks",Had an event for afterparty here with finger snacks. Foods are good although they're kinda slow to refill. First floor has live music. 3rd floor has nice view.
The house is on the dot!,"An unpretentious & convivial drinking hole unlike many in the vicinity. Good brews and delish grub make for a wonderful chillax session whether with friends or business associates. Oh, did i also mention the prompt & courteous service?"
Red dot indeed,Be prepared for the next day - those chilli mussels are something else - so yummy with ice cold beer ... just have something ice cold for your 'dot' the next morning!
Customers taken for granted,"We (group of 4) requested for table by the riverside and the crew proposed that we start ordering sitting at the 2nd floor table and that we will be moved down when the next table becomes available. This never happened even after being there for 4 hours. The nice words are a trick they use to lock the customer and once you get locked you know what…

They served beer without even providing a coaster for the glasses leaving the table all slippery with water from cold beer glass. When the pizza was ordered, they didn’t even provide plates, cutleries or serviette, even after noticing us using the hands to eat the pizza.

They either do not know what is service (but knows to add service charges in the bill) or they take customers for granted (once locked you are at our mercy mentality)."
Tasty Beer,"Beer was house brewed, with wonderful colors. The price was reasonable for a freshly brewed beer and food was also good."
