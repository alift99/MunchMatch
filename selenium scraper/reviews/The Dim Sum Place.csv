Value for Money: 2.5/5

Overall we think it’s alright, interesting take on having Halal Dim Sum, and overall restaurant ambience was alright, just that customer service needs to be better, food was really oily, and for quite a spike in pricing for what it offered."
Amazing food !,Great customer service and food was served promptly.. everything was delicious especially the congee and kangkong..
Love the siew mai,"Honestly its very rare to get halal dim sum in Singapore compare to oversea.. Portion wise for the duck wrap 6 for 15bucks, kind of expensive though. Staffs are friendly and warm! Siew mai are definitely delicious. So yummy!! One thing here, their food are great quality.. definitely going back for another meal soon!"
Excellent food !!,"Always enjoy the food, my repeated visit. Difficult to get HALAL Dim Sum in Singapore. Dim Sum Place is my top choice for the HALAL Dim Sum. I used to eat at Simpang Bedok, once I tried Dim Sum Place, not turning back 😀 👍🏽"
1st time visit,There will be a next visit definitely... to try other things there... Food is really nice... love it...
Satisfied my cravings,"I ever purchased from them and had them delivered to my place few years ago. Apparently, there're no deliveries available anymore so I had been wanting to visit the restaurant to have my meal, only that I have been very busy. Managed to make reservations and went to the restaurant and am glad that the staff were efficient and friendly. The best part, the food quality didn't change. In fact, I think it got better! My children enjoyed their meals as well. Especially the bandung. >.<"
Lovely option for halal food,"This is a straightforward no-nonsense place where you can expect to get the best halal dim sum. The options are a lot and the taste is awesome. Try the fried rice, please! It is very bust and reservations are accepted. The prices are not bad."
Poor service!,I have dined in many times at this place b4 and generally food is good. However my last experience in May with manager at Jln Sultan outlet where we ordered delivery was a disappointment. A true reflection of service at its worst. We ordered and 1 of the items which required sauce to be poured over it was served in a container that does not support liquid. We were unaware about the openings at the bottom. Resulting in material damaged underneath it. We spoke to the manager to feedback and was disappointed to receive a nonchalant reply and insensitive response. Sometimes when customer feedback we expect a simple acknowledgemnt of the situation we experienced which could have been avoided had they been thoughtful in packing the food and for review at their end. A simple apology and empathy with kind words will be enough. Instead the manager was defensive and replied that nobody complaint b4 for the past 4 yrs. A sign of complacency. No apology was received. There was no need to be defensive as this is logic. U cannot serve food that requires sauce(light soya sauce) in a container that does not support such function. Furthermore we were not asking for refund or compensation of any sort. So u shld learn to take feedback constructive instead of defensive.Customer service at its worst because they r complacent!
Enjoyable visit,We booked a slot at 7pm but we were late due to an unpredictable traffic. They (the restaurant) hold our reservation for extra few minutes after the 10mins grace period. Really appreciated. Thank you!
Great Dim Sum twist,"Besides some traditional dim sum, there are many items that were presented with a nice twist of flavours or method of cooking. The place is a tad too noisy to have conversation across the table."
Abt the food...,Affordable n delicious... Fast serving n friendly waitress there... Place is nice to sit n chit-chat... I like the salted egg bun... Very the power...
Friendship Bonding Dinner,First time experience at a Halal Dim Sum joint and found the food quality good and taste delicious - as good as the non-halal dim sum place. Staff were quick to respond to our request despite them being busy that night.
Every dish was brilliant - and halal,"Was sceptical that it would be on a par with other dim sum places and was pleasantly surprised how wrong I was - the duck pancakes were excellent, the dim sum executed well and very flavourful, the rice was so good we took the leftovers with us, the beef in the beef noodles was soft and tender - heartily recommend."
Good experience !!!,Met up with my non-Muslim friends. Everyone enjoyed the experience lunching at Dim Sum Place. My non-Muslim friends were surprised that it taste authentic and will visit with her family next time.
Superb Halal Dimsum place,"The Chee Cheong fun is amazing, 10/10. Many of their dishes are delicious too, like fried carrot cake, custard bun. But the mock Char Siew bao is a hit and a miss unfortunately. They also charge $1.20 for water which is excessive. Nonetheless overall high quality dimsum!"
A good lunch with friends,Food is delicious. Ordered a bit too much but it’s worth it. Will definitely bring my family for a visit again~
Good food,"Good & love the food. Food service is fast. However, the restaurant staff is not friendly and always show black face. Not willing to help"
Excellent food,It is our first time there. The whole enjoy the food especially the duck meat. The char siew bun filling was a little too sweet for our tastebud. But overall it is excellent.
Friendly People!,"Keep it up guys! Just that the restaurant a little cramp. Anyways, great job! Great service! Very friendly!"
"Good Food, Good Life.","Good has always been so good. Generous portion. Just perfect. Not our 1st and It’s not going to be our last visit either. Everything was perfect except that the air-con was too cold. That’s all. Overall, we love the food."
the Dim Sum PlaceRvew,"Great dine in food with family or friends for those who's craving for halal dim sum. big and clean dining area. internal sitting will definitely be better due to SG weather. Clean washroom but its shared ladies and gents a lil uncomfortable. Some prices can be cheaper thou.
Friendly services provided throughout dining."
Rude waiter,Food was good but due to a very rude male waiter that spoilt our mood.Hes always in a hurry and wanted to clear quickly whatever dishes we have finished and when suddenly hes serving one of our food suddenly he himself drop the cutleries and dirtied one of the plates on the table and when my frens was just telling him to get a new plate he says that we are impatience.i guess he has an attitude problem not suitable to b a waiter but a dishwasher maybe.
Consistently Good As Ever,Friendly and prompt service. Great food and consistently good serving and taste. This would be my 5th time visiting.
Value for $,"Delicious dim sum, great choice!! Must order items, seafood paofan / cheese tart / har gao / siew mai"
Fantastic halal dim sum,"Ever since my conversion, I have never managed to find a halal dim sum that was of satisfactory taste.. till we ate at The Dim Sum Place. Truly savoury dishes that is praiseworthy. However, you will need to book in advance as they are always full during lunch or dinnertime."
Awesome Dim Sum,The dim sum tastes very flavoured and freshly cooked. Service is always warm and prompt at this place.
Would definitely recommend!,"Food is awesome. Fast service. I was lucky to get parking in front of the restaurant, otherwise could be challenging. It was too crowded for my comfort but its a popular place so no complaints there. Would definitely recommend and come again!"
Extremely excellent service and food,Food is nice and delicious. Customer service is extremely extraordinary best place to dine in with families and friends. Food is extremely delicious
Great food!,The service was nothing short of expectation. The ladies serving us were quick to asnwer our queries!
Amazing always!,"We are always here for brunch almost twice monthly! The service from reservation, confirmation and eventually eating at the restaurant are always exceptionally well executed. Staff are friendly and best HALAL dim sum ever. Thank you."
Great food with great service!,Mr Chia served us with great hospitality and warmth. We felt super welcomed and well taken care of. He made our dinner taste extra delightful with his wonderful service. He made sure my friend's jasmine tea was always warm and filled. Thank you Mr Chia. We deeply appreciate your kind service. Take care and stay healthy.
Great as always.,"Fast and polite service. Food is good as always. Pleasant experience. Although pricey, still worth it."
"Great food, great service",Had a wonderful brunch at Dim Sum Place. Food was excellent- I really enjoyed their fish porridge. Service was really prompt with attentive service from the staff.
"As always, good food and fast service!",One of the best Halal dim sum place in Singapore! Fast service and friendly staff. The food are yummylicious!! 😋😋
Delicious food with excellent service,My wife has a wonderful lunch there. The service staff were very attentive to our needs. Food was delicious
Great Food & Service,"Not a lot of options for halal dimsums in SG. But, this place serves good food from salted egg & char siew paos to kolo mee duck! even the mango pomelo froyo was nice. quick service too. would totally recommend."
Worth the Visit,"A popular food hangout that closes till 2am near the bugis area. Food is nice and the fish congee is a must try.. duck is succulent and definitely worth the tag..pricing is abit above average but worth the value..i also tried the vermicelli roll but i find it abit salty for my taste bud..overall i would recommend this eatery..it is halal certified as of writing time..do check from time to time for halal status.. parking might be abit challenging if you driving in.. will take around 15 min of walking time if you popping by the MRT(Bugis)..

Ease of access : 3/5
Food Quality : 4/5
Staff : 4/5
Cleanliness : 4/5
Pricing : 3/5 with 5 being expensive"
"PORTIONS ARE SMALL, DO NOT RECOMMEND","Wanted to like this place, taste of the food is not bad. but the portions are too small. I have never ever seen such a small lotus leaf rice in my life, absolutely ridiculous. Each one (there were two) was no bigger than my thumb and my thumb ain’t abnormally sized. Shameful, I’d be so embarrassed to serve it. The plate of asparagus costs 11 dollars and there was at most 3 stalks chopped up into small chunks and spread out sparsely on a plate, it looked really really sad. Depressing almost. The table next to us had to order white rice to supplement the measly dim sum, cos you’d be spending 100 or more to feel half full here for 2 pax. That’s pricey for dim sum. Hard to recommend this place, very hard. 2/5 is a stretch... being generous here, but that’s for the taste"
Revisiting,Seems like the staffing situation has improved on weekends. We got more than 1 staff served us. Superb service. Food was excellent as usual. Love the deep fried cakes and the siew mai. Duck was good too. Overall pleased with the dining experience.
review,"really nice place, good atmosphere and great food! efficient service, enjoyed my time here and would come here again :)"
Dim sum on Saturday,"I enjoyed the crystral prawn dumpling was really nice, good service. Had a good time with my colleagues"
EXTREMELY RUDE AND APPALLING,"My partner and I arrived at their doorstep at 1am on the dot but was immediately met with a glare. The man at the counter raised his voice and said, “We are closed”

I asked if the operational hours state that it closes at 2am which he insisted in a rude tonality, “Yeah but closed now,”

Extremely terrible service right at the doorstep. Can’t imagine if we did stepped in."
Great place for casual dining with friends,Food was great. Service was on point. Reservations needed for this place as its always filled with people. Overall a great place for dinner for friends get together.
Amazing dim sum and service,I love the dim sum and entire menu here. You really can’t go wrong and the service is super friendly and efficient. Would come back for sure!
Review!,"Yummy halal dim sum! Tastes authentic and good! Nice place for hang out with friends, friendly staff"
Best dim sum in town. Manager,Best dim sum in town. Manager super friendly and spoke to us about Singapore and gave us great tips. We have been there twice in 3 days Ok
Gathering,Great place to gather with hala dim sum choices. Have a decent choices of food and variations for different choices
Feedback,Great service and affordable price. The chicken feet and roasted duck are worth the price! Will definitely return again!
the dim sum place,the food is really good mm although it’s abit on the pricey side i guess it’s worth a try! :-) the place is very nice too
good,garlic rice and carrot cake was really nice. portion is slightly on the smaller side but quality is ok
review,This is my second time visiting with my friends and the food quality is still great! would recommend to come down again
Great food with great ambience,The salted egg fried fish skin was crunchy and delicious! Their fried rice was insanely good as well!
Good Dim Sum,"Porridge, Salted Egg Custard Bun and Baked Bun with Roasted Duck Fill are the least that you should try. Surprisingly it is a no pork dim sum eatery. Staffs are friendly and serve you promptly."
Good food,"Good food, good ambience and good place to eat with a cozy group of people. Very nice and friendly staff"
Lunch!,Garlic Fried Rice and Marmite chicken is a must. Fast service and self ordering made it convenient !!
Simple but Good Meal,The Dim Sum Place has always been our go to place for our halal herbal duck fix since 2018. The seasoning is very well done and portion is quite large. We usually pair it with congee with preserved eggs with siu mais and dumplings which are excellent. The service is not too shabby too as refills to our teas were done automatically and our other requests were done without much fuss. Perhaps with covid situation online payment can be done in addition to the e-order. Will definitely come again.
Authentic dim sum,Authentic dim sum place with plenty of variety. Delicious and friendly stuff. Will come back for sure.
Dim Sum Place!,"Good food and great service! Delicious roasted duck noodles, dim sum, boxing chicken and garlic fried rice!!!"
Dim Sum Place is one of my,"Dim Sum Place is one of my favourite restaurant since many years back. Many of my malay friends will always suggest this place whenever we catch up. I will always order their siew mai, cheese tart, deep fried carrot cake, and not forgetting their spinach dumpling with shrimp. And my main- their Dim Sum Place Signature Fried Beehoon. I will definitely recommend anyone who likes or feel like eating dim sum to come to THE DIM SUM PLACE."
Reasonable priced Tim Sum,"Please remember to do your reservations before heading down else the wait is long.

Scan and order..

Crystall shrimp dumpling :Easy portion.
Molten saltes egg yolk custard bun : melts in the mouth.
Chef made beancurd with chicken and salted fish : generous portion... Slightly salty.
Congee with preserved egg and veg : big portion.. Lots of ingredients.. Eat it whole hot.
Peking duck in chef made wrap : nice and crunchy.. Generous portion and ingredients. Sauce eas slightly salty.
Egg tarts : flavourful.."
Worst service,"Worst, I’ve booked for 2 seats and late for 2 mins.

At first we were given an indoor seats and afterwards we were asked to moved to seat outdoor.

We asked why, it was because we were late
for 2 mins. And the terms and condition was pre decided of where to seats indoor or outdoor.

The best part there were 3-4 empty tables indoor.

Take note: The matured guy was disrespectful and not service etiquette to serve the customer.

Not highly recommended, service from good to terrible."
Missing my Congee.,Getting my Halal Dim Sum fix today. Very busy outlet and service was excellent. Century egg porridge was good and the rest of the Dim Sum was excellent.
Poor and Non existent Service for takeaways!,"You should stop all ur takeaways. I waited until 7pm and end up with no food. No explanation what happen, no apology. Nothing. Just refund and thats it. Some orders that came later than mine receive their food. I order in the morning and was given a pickup time at 6pm. There was a customer than ordered the food YESTERDAY. Ur place have also no system in place for pple who already paid and those who haven't for collection. Even the safe distancing ambassador commented on the lack of system. Some have order number and some don't even have after we have paid to u by ibanking. Most of us that were queuing are fasting and you guys cant even offer a plain water to drink to break fast as a simple service recovery. Even when you go to NTUC they provide you a bottled water closer to iftar. Today suppose to be mother's day celebration for most of us, All this turn sour because of your unapologetic incompetence. Such a disappointment from a restaurant with high TripAdvisor ratings. Never again."
Great halal chinese food,"If you are looking for dimsum at a great price, you have it right here. The food taste is awesome, almost every dish taste go great. And all their staff very helpful. Good Job!"
Dim Sum Place,Halal establishment and food quality is outstanding. Except today the duck meat was tough and salty. Will visit again as the service and dim sum was good.
2nd time here,"We celebrated my mum's 60th birthday here in July 2019. Came here again today, 26 Mar and their service and food was still top notch. I love all their food and dessert. I forgot to take the picture of the food coz too hungry . I love their beef brisket noodle. Enjoyed all the dishes and dessert. Coffee is awesome. Happy tummy happy person."
"Delicious cha shu bun, my","Delicious cha shu bun, my fav! tasty and fresh food, service was awesome! This is our second visit and will come again:)"
Worth the queue,"The best Dim sum Ive ever had. So fresh and the service was really fast. I know for next time to book in advance. This place is so popular with Singaporeans that we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table, but so worth the wait."
Pricey?,"After coming here for sometime, today I felt the place to a little pricey. $13.00 for bowl of beef brisket noodles and that’s before GST and service charge."
Great congee and chic feet,Clean resto with well prep prevention over covid-19. Not the norm kinda crowd u wud usually get over lunch. food n service are still good.
Delicious.,If you are looking for Halal meat in singapore..this is one of the decent places to go for..very nice service.
Rude service,"It’s the CNY period and the restaurant is packed. The service of the staff is not very friendly. There was an incident where the older male sever whom we return our used plate gave a very unfriendly remarks that he only has a pair of hands. And when requested for a chopstick for the dropped piece, he return it by poking my friend with the chopstick. We will not return again."
Yummy!,Superb restaurant with gentle staff and delicious food! The spring rolls were fantastic. A must visit for lovers of Chinese food.
Gathering reunion dinner,"We book the table for 12 pax, we were waiting for the rest of our friends & food to serve. One of the staff told us that we have only have 15 mins to finish our food as they have big group booking the table that we seated. We shocked as we are not told such rules that we are not able to sit longer. After we voice out they move us to outside table. while we were finishing our food the same man told us cannot finish can tapau home. He took the plate & start packing for us. He was hurrying us to leave the place. Even after we make payment we decided to take pictures outside the restaurant. However the man hurried us to take pic & leave the place ASAP. This was the most embarrassing & unforgettable moment for us being chased out of restaurant as if we are of no value to them. We spent total of $400 plus on the restaurant but the service we received were sucked. This would be the first & last time we dine there"
Birthday celebration,"The food is piping hot when served . They will take sometime to serve the food but once your first dish is served, the rest will keep coming one after another. Great food but a little pricey."
Insanely good,"I was very keen to find halal dim sum in Singapore and I was not disappointed by coming here. My husband and I ordered mainly steamed dumplings and buns which did not disappoint. I was glad the portions were not too big considering we ordered about 6 things (yes I had a full belly afterwards but no regrets). I will say I wasn't too fond of the Herbal Duck dish as it had less flavour compared to the other dishes we ordered. Some dishes also included some bones but it didn't detract too much from my experience. I will say though that the signature mocktail of rose water, longan and chia seeds was perfect and complimented the food very well (keep in mind that I am an avid sweet-tooth). We left feeling very pleased with our experience."
"Great food, reasonable prices.","Great food, reasonable prices, friendly staff. Recommended if you like Dim Sum. Casual and relaxed atmosphere."
Nice Dim Sum,Dim Sum was good. There was a wide variety of choices and the service was good. The place was also clean.
Excellent halal food,The dim sum is tasty and not much different in that from the high end dim sum places in Singapore. Everything we ordered was delicious. Service was super quick and friendly.
Halal Dim Sum,"The place is easy to find and it is walking distance from Lavender MRT station.Their food tastes nice except for the Pulut Hitam which is quite tasteless to me.Other then that, their service is good and the whole time the restaurant are basically playing only Taylor Swift songs."
Good service and great food.,Good service and great food. The staff were very friendly. Chia seed drink with rose syrup is a must.
Duck Leg Noodles,Craving for the one of the best Duck Noodles. Succulent meat! Many other varieties of Dim Sum too. Halal certified and always packed with customers. Outdoor dining is available too.
Ok dim sum but nothing special except halal certified,Made the mistake to not realize that this place is halal certified and doesn’t sell pork. Dim Sum is ok but nothing so good that you have to travel to the place . We love really good dim Sum and wouldn’t come back
Late dinner,"My husband and I were there around 11pm for our late dinner and we were surprised that there were still many diners at that hour. The food was delicious and generous portions, so we learnt our lesson not to order too much."
Friendly staff,My big family had dinner there...it was amazing...food were delicious...price affordable...and there was a staff by the name of Neo Jing Yi...she was friendly and sweetest smile serving our table...Kudos girl...hope to see ur smiling face again...☺
Good value,Highly recommend the garlic onsen egg fried rice and the crystal shrimp dumpling.. good service by Yimon.
Delicious Dim Sum,"Arrived as a party of four without reservation around 6:00pm on a Wednesday and got seated immediately. The lady at the front desk was welcoming.The menu is reasonably extensive and the taste delicious. Service is expedient. We came because of previous good reviews and the place did not disappoint. Did not take pictures, because the food did not last long enough on the plates!"
"Good food, fast service","Shop offers a wide variety of dim sum. The service is really quick, dishes came within 15minutes of ordering. Would recommend the taro cake, black fungus and shrimp dumplings. Service is good, Uncle Peter and king were really friendly."
FOOD IS GOOD,"I’ve been searching for delicious halal chinese food and Dim Sum Place have always satisfy my cravings. Food is Delicious, Service is Splendid and The Experience is OUT OF THIS WORLD. Die Die must try. 5/5 . FOOD IS GOOD.

Served by Staff Keng. Loving the customer service he provides."
👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽,"I've come here repeatedly because the food has always been delicious every single time I'm here. The food never disappoints.

Continue the good food and good service!"
Informal restaurant- good food,"Informal restaurant serving fabulous dim sum. Great selection of foods good price, but the restaurant is nothing flash, no table cloths but who cares when the food is great. I would suggest you book as tables book quickly. Service is fast."
Favourite Spot,My favourite dinner/supper spot. Yes it is crowded at times but the colleagues is too much for them to handle. Food and service is great as always.
