another omakase joint,"Am seeing everyone move from ala-carte to omakase in japanese cuisine. Two reasons: a less clued up clientele and a cleverer restaurant. Feeding the same stuff to 20 diners cuts ordering problems, cooking problems and waste and also increases margins because you can feed nonsense also and call it a part of a package. Too much soya in the rice, too much fusion in the side dishes. The only thing outstanding was the quality of the fish but if you cannot order exactly what you like, what is the point? good for business dinners and clueless patrons who cannot be bothered to learn what to order"
Lovely experience,wonder why the prawn sushi was cut half when presenting? It will also nice to explain the food in English after staff introduced the dish in Japanese. :)
Fantastic Omakase,Really loved this place - the quality of the food is excellent. Our chef Shintaro-san is simply great and very friendly. Highly recommended
good experience that’s worth the price!,went for the lunch omakase and it was a really good experience :) will definitely recommend to others and chef Shintaro was very friendly to make the experience a memorable one! thank you!
One of the best original omakase!,This is one of the best orginal Omakase in Singapore. Service very good. Very impressive. Love !!!!!!
Good material but over priced,"Great ambience, good service & food is okay some bite a little bit too salty. I paid $388 net for lunch but still hungry. The fish and dishes are similar to typical to other Omakase restaurants."
Best Jap Food and Experience,"I thought I have eaten the best jap food already, but this is even more delicious and bring me to a whole new level! Service is good and no complain!"
Ooohlala Food and Service is excellent!,"We dis not order any of the cooked items and did just the raw ones but everything hit the spot. Personally 3rd was the Ankimo Monaka, 2nd Ootoro and 3rd the Ikura Uni Don. Its Omakase so you may not always get these but some.could be the standard staple items. Biance, service was great. You also get nice experience and not only good food."
Superb dining experience,"Excellent service, staff and chef were attentive to our needs and requests. Food was superb and fresh. Staff also took note that we are celebrating birthday, and prepared a surprise dessert for us. Staff also helped to take an instant photo with their prepared notes and card. Very pleasant experience overall. Quite expensive but definitely worth it."
Very good experience,"The food was great and the fish was fresh. It was a good place to go to if you want somewhere quiet. We just felt a bit uncomfortable to see the chef going to the kitchen now and then, as well as hearing him sniffing and sneezing in the kitchen. We were constantly praying that he washed his hands properly after sneezing."
"Very good, but not among top five sushi in Singapore","The ingredients are certainly fresh, the service impeccable, and you can have a very good omakase meal here, but this is the least favourite among my top sushi restaurants in Singapore. Compared to the two Shinji’s, Ashino, Kisho, Kimura, the dishes are much less diverse. I have a bias against 2-Mich-star Shoukouwa, where we had horrific service."
A heavenly sushi omakase experience,Thanks so much to Shintaro-san for his beautiful creations! It was my first sushi omakase experience and I teared up forreals
Outstanding,Premium quality fish and good service. Will be back again as this is one of the most private omakase places I've been to.
Lunch,"This is my return visit, and we still enjoyed it alot. Fish are fresh (or aged as needed!) and of great quality, with ingredients that are carefully made and matched. Adequately close to our tokyo sushi experiences. Received lovely gesture from the restaurant as it was a birthday celebration. Will be back! :)"
Excellent Experience,"We had the lunch set in the restaurant, and we were truly impressed by the chef and the restaurant food. Every sushi was so impressive, surprise with the combination taste. its really truly a excellent experience. We will be back again next time."
Good omakase lunch,"The food quality is definitely very good, very fresh. The sake is the best!! The only downside is that the chef does not engage with the customers so it can be quite."
Sushi Paradise,One of the best sushi place in Singapore no doubt about it. From preparation to presentation hands up to all the lovely people who work there. Thank you to Aileen and Chef Kawana for a wonderful food and experience! Highly recommended if you are looking for a fresh and good quality sushi!
Lunch Omakase,"Sushi is interspersed with small dishes, I suspect like the Saito school in Tokyo. Aged tuna with sauce aka akami zuke was wonderful. A true test of a sushiya is the akami and not the toro imho; and Ayumu passed this test with flying colours. The last dish was a very pleasant surprise- ramen in pork stock with a hint of yuzu and spice. I will be back"
"normal experience, chef not engaging and not so generous portions compared to other omakase","the experience was so so, chef was not engaging enough, just doing his own things, food taste is ok but not so generous portions compared to other omakase"
Quite pricey but worth for special occasions.,"Food was incredible, we had the omaskase. Chef was really friendly and made an effort to make use feel comfortable, and the wait staff was very attentive but not intrusively so. Good job!"
Excellent food and attention of service,It was a very personalise experience where you get the attention of the Chef and the staff. My wife and I had the lunch Omasake and the food was excellent in every course. Would definitely bring some of my business clients over to this private experience.
Best omakase in Sg,"Was there with my fiancé for a birthday celebration. The entire dining experience was wonderful from the food, to the service. Great atmosphere; it wasn't fully occupied hence it wasn't crowded, which is one of the thing i really enjoyed as we prefer for a quiet dining. However, would suggest playing some soft music at the background as we felt it was overly quiet in the entire restaurant. They were so lovely to end the dinner with a complimentary plate of Japanese desserts and fruit platter for my fiancé's birthday, acocmapied with a birthday song. We even get to leave the restaurant with a birthday card, inside with a Polaroid photo of us taken by them. Would definitely come back again!"
"Superb Service, Ambiance and Food",I was expecting a normal meal of Japanese food in Singapore but instead we were treated to a magnificent experience of probably the best Japanese food I've had in Singapore with charming service in a lovely setting. Arigato!
Birthday Celebration At Sushi Ayumu,"It was truly a dream come true to experience high end dining at the famed sushi ayumu. The encounter measures up to our previous experience at Sushi Masa in Tokyo. Chef Ryoichi-San and the team of highly attentive wait staff made our evening with an artistic performance preparing each item down to the last detail. It was a relaxed and enjoyable dining experience in a very cosy and friendly atmosphere. When time came for the dessert (and my birthday candle), we were treated to the famed Kyushu melon."
Good value,The restaurant names says it all. Lots and lots of variety of sushi. Fish is as fresh as it gets. Service is excellent.
Sushi as an art and culinary experience,"This is my second time here and the dining experience is still as wonderful as the first time. This time we were served by Nakajima-san who is just one month in Singapore having worked at the sushi restaurant at the Ritz Carlton in Tokyo.

What sets this place apart is the meticulous attention to detail. They don’t use torch to sear the Aburi. Rather they use charcoal imported from Japan to heat up the flesh. You can see from the pictures I took how he does it.

There were many dishes that are simply exquisite but special mentions are the snow crab with roe, ikura with crab meat and rice with a special sauce, trout with trout roe, Botan ebi and Uni from Hokkaido. The tamago cake is not just egg but it is baked with a variety of ingredients which makes it amazing and completes a fantastic meal. For a fine dining sushi experience of the highest quality in Singapore you should look no further than Sushi Ayumu.

Of course since it’s fine dining don’t forget to bring your credit card along with you as you will need it."
A Perfect Omakase,"Summary: An unforgettable omakase experience that we will definitely return to once again be indulged by the chef’s yummy whims & the sushi ya’s impeccable service. The ingredients are all seasonal hence we look forward to a different dining experience in our next visits.

My wife and I had dined at Hashida Sushi earlier this year and wanted to return for our anniversary celebration. Whilst looking online for the reservation number, we quickly learnt that Hashida Sushi had closed at Mandarin Gallery and in its place was another sushi ya, Sushi Ayumu. After a few email exchanges, we decided to try this place and on hindsight, we are glad we did.

We went for lunch and had Chef Kawana’s omakase. In the menu, the chef’s omakase is called “Omakase Kokoro” with Kokoro meaning “heart” and it was fitting as Chef Kawana ( 24 years of experience as a chef in Japan before joining Ayumu this year) prepared each dish with a lot of heart. Platting was important, colour was important, he did the charcoal cooking himself, de-shelled the snow crab himself, and when something was not satisfactory he would re-do the item again.

Throughout the meal, we were attended by Aileen whom we learnt was fluent in many languages. As Chef Kawana’s English wasn’t too fluent yet, Aileen would fill us in on what the chef said, the background of the dishes, interesting facts and answers to questions we had. She was attentive and polite with the right mix of enthusiastic that made our lunch all that more enjoyable.

We were served a total of 21(!) courses and left feeling really satisfied.

Started off with appetizer of horse mackerel in snow crab sauce. Snow crab is in season now and the mackerel was fresh and tasty.

The sashimi platter consisted of special seasonal items – Yellowtail belly, Hokkaido water octopus tentacles and chutoro that was cooked using binchotan charcoal right in front of us! This requires much skill and effort by the chef as he needs to know how long and how far away to hover the sieve holding the charcoal above the chutoro pieces. This resulted in the best chutoro we’ve ever tasted.

Next up was butter fish with a special sauce that tasted like fermented and salted black soybean sauce. It was garnished by a red mapleleaf which we were told were imported from Japan. In fact, the type of leaves imported varies with the season.

Following that, we had the snow crab with roe. The female snow crab is smaller and the chef told us that mixing the inner roe and outer roe would make for a yummy combination. He proceeded to dissect the crab of its meat, amazingly there were no crab flakes when we devoured the dish.

We then had a series of sushi mixed with seasonal fish that ended in dessert
Young tuna with soy sauce + white sesame oil + mountain yam
Shimi aji sushi
Barracuda sushi topped with uni salt (literally salt mixed with uni until it became uni salt)
Trout sushi with seasonal trout roe
Wakasagi fish with nouri sauce (another seasonal fish)
Kinmedai (Golden Snapper) sushi
Akami sushi marinated with chef's own concoction
Botan shrimp topped with botan shrimp roe sushi (surprised that fresh prawn roe is green!)
Miso soup
Otoro sushi
Nodoguro (sea perch) sushi
Bafun uni sushi
Fried botan shrimp head
Barracuda sushi topped with uni salt – asked for encore as it was that nice!
Signature handroll
Tamago
Dessert – Musk Melon, Strawberry, Matcha Ice Cream w Gula Melaka. Matcha ice cream was made in-house and it went so well with gula melaka that my wife (who doesn’t eat gula melaka) finished every drop.

The whole experience was worth every penny and anyone looking for a special place for a special occasion should consider Sushi Ayumu."
Always an amazing experience👍🏼,"""A bit"" pricey but worth every cent. I would come back here again when I come back to Singapore❤️ Been here last February with same chef - absolutely worth it!"
Nice Sushi Dinner,"Our first visit last night. My buddy came back to town so we were looking for a nice sushi fix for dinner. We were recommended this place through a foodie friend. This is a hidden gem of a place... though we suspect not for long once more people come to know about it. Chef is highly skilled. Produce is top notch and service is cheerful and pleasant.

What stands out for us. The lightly grilled sea perch on rice, the fatty yellowtail belly (which the chef says is in season now) served in sashimi and the Ayumu Roll. The chef explained that they used a very special aged red vinegar to marinate the rice thus the rich umami and flavour. The nicely vinegared sushi rice also provided a very nice lift to the Fatty Tuna sushi which we both felt was outstanding. We also found out from the chef that they are one of the few restaurants in town serving the prized wild tuna (hon-maguro) due to its extremely high cost and limited in quantity.

We went home very satisfied tonight. We both felt it was one of the best sushi meal we had for a while. Will be back."
The Best in SG!!!,"Ayumu is my favourite sushi restaurant in Singapore serving authentic edomae style. The restaurant is def Michelin grade, with superb ingredients and service. I enjoyed every course of the meal, a very enjoyable night!"
Better than Before,"We're glad to be back in Singapore! Managed to get a seat at Sushi Ayumu after they have changed their name. Quality of their produce was beyond my expectations! Their service and fish is superb now! Knowing that we are celebrating our anniversary, the Chef prepared a special dessert for us. Will be back!"
Must go!!,Found this place on tripadvisor and read up on the restaurant online. This fine-dining restaurant seems to have rebranded themselves this year in a refreshing and authentic manner. Sushi and service is superb!! Would also recommend the uni and anago. Overall a very happy experience.
Great ambiance and excellent food quality,It felt like I was Transported to Japan and back in an hour. Chief was meticulous and provided good commentary on the different varieties of Sashmi served
Amazingly authentic Japanese...hard pressed to think of somewhere better,"Can not say how surprised I was to find this gem in the Mandarin Gallery. From the moment I was seated until the moment I left the restaurant, I was treated to a VIP sushi experience.

I ordered the Ume since I wasn't particularly hungry and didn't want any of the cooked dishes. Make no mistake - this is not cheap eats. There are only 3 selections on the dinner menu and the cheapest (Ume) is S$280. However, the old saying 'you get what you pay for' could never be more true than in the context of Ayumu. Chef Nakatani is a true artist, painstakingly creating masterpiece after masterpiece right in front of you. Each course is a delight for the eyes as well as your mouth! I've tried to faithfully capture in pictures part of the visual experience. Finally, the service was outstanding - always present, yet never suffocating.

I've recommended Ayumu to all my friends who live in SG and look forward to returning to sample the chef's creations the next time I'm in town."
The best sushi experience in Sg,Every dish served was perfection and tasty. Quality of food is no less than what we find in Japan. The chef was friendly. Price is steep just as Shinji and other fine sushi dining. Would love to come back on a special occasion.
Excellent and Authentic,"We had made reservation at Hashida Sushi for our anniversary celebration and didn't quite know what to expect when we were told Hashida Sushi had closed and is now Sushi Ayumu. We decided to go ahead anyways and were really glad we did!

We were seated at the counter and well taken care of by Head Chef Nakatani who served us authentic and excellent sushi made with the freshest seafood from Japan - Sea bream, Hokkaido trout, Chutoro, Baracuda, Kinmedai, Ebi, Uni etc. He was friendly and humorous and didnt laugh at my rusty Japanese.

Service was impeccable and we left with happy tummies & a nice Polaroid card for keepsake.

絶対にSushi Ayumuにまた来ます！"
Fine dining worthy sushi,This is the place to get your fix on the best and freshest sushi in town. They fly in fresh seafood from Japan 6x a week. Of course you pay fine dining prices but it was worth it. I hear recently it changed owners and is taken over by head chef Nakatani san. I hope it remains as good.
One of best authentic sushi in Singapore,"Honestly i never feel the service this superb on any restaurant in Singapore it simply the best and wholesome experience that i ever felt; thus should be a gold standard for other restaurant.

The food is excellent and well aged ingredients(please note that the aged ingredients purpose is for a perfect natural flavour) the chef are engaging with fun also the presentation is engaged with the flavour. If i had any chance i gladly return.

the best place is to visit for dinner and omakase is a must."
An indulgent treat to fine quality sushi,"If you want to give yourself an indulgent treat to an elegant sushi meal, this is the place to go. High end sushi in an aesthetically pleasing and intimate setting. I thoroughly enjoyed myself, taking time to savour every dish that was beautifully crafted by the Japanese Chef who worked behind the counter, in front of me. I love Japanese food and I have to say, this place has the best otoro and Uni. I had Hamaguri clams which are in season now, and they were delightfully fleshy, juicy and flavourful.

Service was attentive and warm without being intrusive. Tell the service staff if you are celebrating a birthday occasion and they’ll give you a little surprise."
Purely the best sushi restaurant in Singapore,I go to Hashida on my special occasions such as wedding anniversary and birthdays. Simply the best! Chef Hatchy and the crew are the best!
Excellent celebratory meal,A pleasant experience. had the lunch omakase. was so stuffed from it although i did wish for more rice for the sushi.. the chef didnt ask..
Omakase,"Really good Omakase experience with very attentive service throughout the night. Had the monk fish liver for the first time which was amazing! Chefs are all from Japan so they could not speak that much English, but the waitress was always waiting behind ready to translate. Fantastic experience all round!!"
Excellent food,"Fresh & premium ingredients that make great food. Chef is friendly & explained to us what we are eating. The sashimi is one of the best that we had tasted! The sushi is also very good as the rice is of top quality. We took the $350 Omakase dinner. We ended up full & contented. A very great dining experience indeed. Though costly, we are treated to only the best food, and it is worth every single cent."
The best and most delicious sushi set I've ever had in my life,The tachibana sushi set was super delicious and tasty. I truly love it and apsolutely love all the dishes i've had tried before.
The best food experience!,"Chef Ryoichi is the best! The food was excellent, our 7 years old Luca was only eating salmon before this dinner and here he tried different types of fish and is excited to come here again! Thank you for the perfect dinner!"
Lunch at Hashida Sushi,Very good sushi - one of the best spots in Singapore. And I am not grouping it just into Japanese restaurants category.
Excellent restaurant,"Picked this off Trip Advisor and was not disappointed. Traditional Omakase menu was excellent, good variety and all very fresh. Service was also first rate - thank you Aileen. Really enjoyed it, will go back. In my experience, one of the best in Singapore."
Worth for trying,"the food is definitely worth trying, if you are a sashimi/ sushi lover. Really good service, recommended!"
Awesome ambiance with good food.,Really good omakase though it's not the cheapest you can get. Quiet and nice ambience. The seafood shushi were really good!~
Fabulous,"Probably my favourite sushi restaurant in Singapore - exquisite food and wonderful, friendly service. I can’t wait to return."
excellent food and sushi,I had the Ayame lunch set which was excellent. the Uni and Ikura rice bowl was to die for. Yugi who served me was professional and friendly. Ordered an extra portion of Uni roll just because it tasted so heavenly.
Anniversary,"Chef Hash, youthful, engaging and welcoming in his table! Made our anniversary truly special! Worth every dollar!"
Great food,"Another stunning experience as we enjoyed the fresh food served on the spot. Pricey it might be, but it's totally worth the price for the experience. We had lunch, so couldn't have the sake, which in itself, would be another wonderful experience."
Always a great experience,"Food is always amazing. Chef Hitoshi was very accommodating and chatty. He explained the type of sauces, his special knives and taught us how to pronouce the names of the fish in Japanese. We ecen had a good chat on which parts of Japan to visit and the food we should try. Had a really great time."
Great Sushi Excellent Chef,Awesome experience! The sushi was fresh as expected and the night was made even better with a great Japanese Chef.
Very good Japanese sashimi meal,"A customer/friend recommended this place. Walked past the restaurant without knowing how good it is.

Though the name is Hashida Sushi, this premium restaurant serves seafood theme sashimi, sushi and cooked 7-course meals.

The menu simply states SGD300-500 per pax for an omakase meal (similar to menu de degustation).

I am familiar with Japanese food, sushi and sashimi. And yet I was blown away by the quality and complexity (in taste) of the food served."
Attentive service and amazing food,"Celebrated my husband's birthday at Hashida sushi. The restaurant is a Michelin grade, with amazing service and delicious food. We enjoyed every course of the meal especially the Uni and the Otoro. Kudos to the service staff and the chef for providing an amazing service to us!"
Excellent!,"3rd time to Hashida sushi and the food never fails. Quality is really good, the chef and service staff were very polite. Chef was also nice to talk to. Will definitely return again!"
A total dining experience!,"This is omakase at its most authentic and absolute dining best. The service was impeccable. The chef, Sato Yuji, was chatty, friendly, very considerate, and really knowledgeable. I am allergic to soy and that's quite a challenge for a Japanese meal. But Satosan ensured I didn't lose out on the flavours. The serving, the plating, the preparation, and the careful thought that went into each dish as we watched Satosan slice, put together and plate, as well as the ambience all made this a fine dining experience extraordinaire!"
Omakase at its best,"Service, food, ambience were all impeccable. The otoro was super delish and fatty. Chef always checked in with us to make sure we had enough to eat, which we did. Stars commendable"
V Good by local standards,"Decided to give this place a try after hearing so much about it... every time u talk to a stranger at the sushi counter and they will mention where they have dine before and what's good in Singapore. We seldom dine outdoors in Singapore because eating out is too ridiculously expensive.

Decided to opt for the $500 dinner Omakase and was seated with a fairly 'new Chef' who has just been on board for about 8 months and speak very good English. He was honest and direct in his answers (I mentioned that if he was back in Japan - he would still be washing vegetables in the kitchen before he can slice a fish at the counter and he agree). However, what makes the dinner a difference was he was only assign to just the 2 of us, whereas the other Chef was given 8 diners to serve on the same sushi counter (the restaurant has 3 counters). This allowed me to have lots on interaction with him.

As others have mentioned, nice impressive setup and ambience, superb wine list and a corkage charge of $60 per bottle or 1 for 1 offer.

I told Chef (he is going to be a proud Father next month as they are expecting their first child in Singapore) it was his lucky day as we offered him 3 glasses thru the night of Dom Perignon 2002 which we brought a bottle along.

Overall great food quality and his first remark before dinner to us was - if we wanted quality or quantity. This guy knows how to please his customers and thru the dinner conversation and course by course meal we felt comfortable and satisfied.

Would I go back to Hashida again ? It's a great restaurant but depending on the choices I have.

For me it would be easier to take off to Japan and dine with some of the better restaurants at the same price point. At 40,500y per head I can dine @ Jiro, Saito, Mizutani and many others for lesser the amount. The Chef concluded that I have eaten more restaurants in Japan than himself."
Best omakase,"Best omakase and sake anywhere... the unique chef's fish preparation, serving, presentation and taste are out of this world."
Awesome food,"Food quality is good, the chefs really do try very hard to please. However, you have to be prepared for the bill. It is really expensive."
One of teh best,"In a hard high end Japanese restaurant in Singapore, Hashida Sushi is among the top 3. Great quality, expensive but superb ingrediends and service"
Hashida Sushi,Great food specially prepared by the chefs. The chefs are interactive and service oriented. The staffs re interactive and attentive to your requests.
Possibly the best Japanese restaurant in Singapore,"This restaurant only serves omakase, and it definitely was worth it - the quality and the detail that was put into every piece served was just unbelievable.

This was our first time to Hashida and we were so happy to have Chef Hashida prepared our meal for us. He was amazing - the detail that he put into every piece ... Based on our taste and what he believes we would like to eat, he created culinary heaven! From the sashimi, to the sushi, and the dessert - even the ginger sorbet ... It was a perfect meal. Fresh, authentic and sincere - beautiful!"
Awesome sushi,Really delicious and fresh sushi in a cozy environment. On the expensive side but you are paying for quality.
Not worth it considering the reputation,I've done at some great sushi restaurant. This one was rather disappointing. Due to the professionalism of the dining experience.
Best of the best!,"Excellent chef's knife craft created Premium sushi that melt in your mouth. We love the Toro Kama ( fatty tuna cheek). It is a must try. Soft and silky; the freshness of the toro pair perfectly well with Hashida in-house sake!
Chef Hitoshi is so friendly that it felt like eating at a friend's place."
Very good service and food,"Service and food is definitely tip top, but it will be better if the price is lower. Went for lunch, cost ard 450sgd for two pax and didn't feel really very full."
A real disappointment for such pedigree,"The reputation and pedigree of this restaurant sets a high bar and expectations. Unfortunately, they were not only far short of the expectations but the chef that served us was at best an amateur that wouldn't even fulfill the basic requirements. We specified very clearly to service staff and chef to exclude tako and ika. Sushi chef acknowledged but overlooked this simple request not once but twice serving us both the above. The sushi was extremely fresh especially the uni and Otoro however, there was n obvious lack of passion and creativity in preparation and sequencing the tastes. Also, the chef was perpetually making mistakes with preparations falling over and at times even off the preparation table. The chef may have perhaps been too engrossed in continued conversations over the whole meal with an apparent acquaintance across the counter which I found rather disrespectful and unbecoming of any decent sushi chef. Rather odd and disappointing unexpected experience which tarnishes the legacy of this restaurant and perhaps the profession"
Great food & service,"Amazing experience at Hashida. Great food and service. Might seem a tad expensive, but definitely worth it!"
Quality food but lack wow factor,"Went for dinner and was in a 7-Seater room. Omakase price point between SGD350-500 per pax.

Overall, the quality of food is definitely there and the chef and our waitress services are impeccable. Always attentive.

As for the dishes, it didn't stand out in terms of flavor. I would say it's more blend but that's probably my own tastebud. The sushi rice is good and the last dish where the chef craft the tuna belly is extremely good as the meat simply melts in your mouth.

For the price point, I will still rank Mitsuya as my favorite. Shinji will be next.

Not the fault of the restaurant, there was a small commotion with 3 guests but our waitress handled the situation professionally."
Little Tokyo in Mandarin Orchard,"This place transport you to Tokyo in a instance, and you will know that you are in good hands if you come into this place looking for sushi. Tried once, it is recommended, however pricewise is not very value though"
Bad,"Had the Tsubaki set for lunch. Perhaps I went on a (really) bad day, but the sushi was pretty deplorable for the price point. The service was just average too. You don't have to go far for much better sushi and better service - there's much better to be had in Singapore"
Not bad,"The food is good, quality and fresh fish. But for me it was an average good sushi place And abit overpriced. For us we had no Budget the total bill was 1450sgd"
Amazingly good,Fantastic omasake for lunch - was full but not overly stuffed. Staff were very attentive and friendly. Quality was impressive. Looking forward to being back again.
Visited Hashida Sushi for the 1st time in Mar 2017,Tried the Omakase lunch in Mar 2017. Each pax cost $300++. Food was ok but was not fantastic for the price paid. Don't have the Urrmmmm/Wow feeling! Can give it a try if you haven't but I will not go back since there are many other Japanese restaurants with better options if you set $300/pax as your budget!
One of the best sushi,Excellent place to celebrate birthdays etc and enjoy sushi of the highest grade! Service Ambience excellent ! Of course it's a little pricey but worth it if it's a special occasion.
as in Tokyo (if not better),"As per my subject..... it is as good as in Tokyo. Friendly staff and chef. My chef was Kenji Nakagawa, and he did a perfect job. I chose a middle priced menu, with a good bottle of wine (good list btw). I ended up spending a reasonable amount (again..... as in Tokyo !), but completely satisfied. Will go back for sure"
Second visit and the food is still exceptional,"Went back to Hashide for a second time and is still impressed by the quality of the food. However, service quality is not as good as the first time perhaps we were allocated to the biggest room with full capacity. Hope the restaurant can review and improve in this area. Nevertheless, it was still enjoyable."
For Special Occasions,"Fantastic food and service. Thoughtful touches with Polaroid picture and card for friend's bday. setting cosy and intimate, definitely a place to go to celebrate special occasions."
Omakase Lunch @Hashida Sushi,The Omakase menu that I ordered was really good and service was excellent. Ingredients used was extremely fresh and of really good quality. An overall unforgettable experience!
Must Go!!!,"We were very honored to be attended to by the Master Chef and Owner, Hashida San. The food is very fresh and nice, the staff, including the owner, is friendly and approachable! I would definitely recommend this to everyone."
Hashida,"Delicious, absolutely delicious food. Our service staff was also super attentive and thoughtful. She realised it was one of our birthdays and brought us a treat!"
Superb,"Had omakase lunch and chose the most complete course. Superb sushi and sashimi. The fish are so fresh they literary melt in your mouth. The course includes Skin tofu mixed with Ikura and Uni, Cawan Mushi with Ice fish, Mizu Tako, Chu Toro, Kimedai, Tai, Ainame with egg plant, Flounder sushi, Kampachi sushi, Ika sushi, Ikura mixed with Uni and rice, Kama Toro
Anago

Service is good. Staffs are really friendly and attentive. Price is high, but worth your money. One of the best in Singapore."
The best sushi I have had outside Japan,"I lived in Japan for over eleven years and I was pleasantly surprised by just how good Hashida Sushi is. It would not be out of place amongst the best in Tokyo. The fish and seafood is perfectly fresh, very well selected and cut and presented by a master of his art. The restaurant is rather incongruously placed in a shopping mall but once you have entered the decor and atmosphere are all Japan. There is a good selection of sake. Chef Hashida himself is charming, engaging and with a rather un-Japanese dry sense of humour which all adds to the occasion. Prices however are comparable to Tokyo."
"Superb perfect sushi, attention to detail, engaging, friendly itamae!","(Dined twice in November, once in December)

Finally had a meal at Hashida after hearing so much about it. I'm no stranger to fine-dining sushi restaurants, so with this perspective, Hashida was wonderful.

My gripe and issue with many sushi-counter restaurants: Japanese sushi chefs can be aloof, slightly cold, and at worst, rude and sneering to non-Japanese patrons. The chefs and staff at Hashida not only speak good English, they are genuinely warm and friendly to ALL customers, not just the regulars (and there were many!). Our chef, Sato-san, made an effort to engage with all customers and chat with them about fish, Japan and anything else.

I think that important first step to being warm and friendly to non-Japanese customers mean that a good relationship can be established, one in which Sato-san is able to offer what each customer likes.

I understand there are four options for lunch: $80, $120, $180, $250. We had lunch on a weekday and selected the $120 menu, which included nigiri sushi of course, also a tofu appetizer (with dashi? Kombu? Jelly, ikura, (real) wasabi), chawamushi (with seasonal fish in it), small Hokkaido rice bowl of uni and ikura (served with wonderfully smoky miso soup) and dessert (Merlin macaron). The nigiri sushi were sublime, perfectly made: the Shari (rice) was delicious, each fish complementing it, already with wasabi and sauce painted atop the fish, or perhaps a different but appropriate condiment -- a slice of perilla leaf with the ika. I remembered we had baby barracuda, flounder, hamachi, ika, anago, tamago and chutoro.

We enjoyed our first lunch so much we made a reservation for lunch two days later and opted for the $250 meal. Which was sublime. With the $180 and $250 menu, one gets an additional plate of sashimi before the sushi, and only with the $250 Hiragi meal does one get an additional dish (in this case we had Hokkaido hairy crab meat smoked and steamed wrapped in bamboo leaves-- no picking of crab meat necessary as all was de-picked!) and the piece de resistance: the famous slab of marbled kamatoro/ toro/chutoro/ brought out, and the chef shaving curling slices of it, atop the gorgeous Shari, packed perfectly -- use your hands now, and pop it into your mouth and just let it melt!!

The sashimi platter was fantastic too: there was tako, scored perfectly, so tender and sweet. Lightly aburi Tai (red snapper) was spot on. There were two pieces of otoro too. Japanese fruits (honey dew, persimmon and pear) were offered for dessert for $250 menu.

I mentioned to the chef I adore ankimo, and he got it prepped for me. Hashida does it differently -- they use a sweet prawn sauce instead of ponzu, and it was very, very good.

Obviously will return. It was less stuffy and formal than Shinji, and with a good rapport established, you could get to eat what you really like. (But admittedly, both Shinji and Hashida are top-notch, in my books. Better than two-Michelin starred Shoukouwa)"
One of the best in Singapore,"I have been to all Michelin star restaurants including the top sushi restaurants such as Shinji and Sushi Ichi. I wanted to try Hashida because of all the good reviews. I went with high hopes and Hashida surpassed all my must expectations.

It was a very interactive and enjoyable dinner under the excellent care of Chef Hitoshi Oyamada. He made great effort in enhancing our dining experience by explaining each dish and tailored the dishes served according to our individual palate.

Each dish was delightful and presented in a spectacular manner to stimulate the senses of sight, smell and taste. By the end of the meal, I had decided that Hashida Sushi is now my favourite restaurant, and I cannot wait to return for a second round."
Most Interactive and Enjoyable Japanese Meal,"With strong recommendations from many friends, we decided to celebrate our 35th anniversary cum Christmas Day lunch at Sushi Hashida Singapore. We have so much funs here in addition to the excellent cuisine here.
We have chosen the $250pp menu for lunch, but Master Chef Hashida-San was so kind to added items from the evening menu to commirate our occasion, really nice of him. He was also very kind to agree to our request to personally serve us.
I must mention that watching him slicing the raw fish etc is an enjoyment itself, so much techniques, sharpness and precision to go into it, he is also a trend setter, being creative based upon immediate past traditions, he often shave lemon peels onto sushi to create a refreshing feel is adding to the joy of eating, he is also very creative with his sauce for the sushi, infuse with other elements such as yuzu to have a wonderful ending of sushi tasting...very impressive and enjoy so much about the food there.
BUT most importantly, Chef Hashida-San is such an easy person to talk to, he has good command of English, allow us to have ongoing conversations with him, as he has lived in many countries before and with broad exposures, so we really able to converse so freely and so much fun added to the meal...typically we go to sushi counter, always faced with a stern looking Chef with no English language, at time is boring and at time is awkward, just to finish eating there. Today we have a total different experience, plus Chef Hashida-San is so jovious , that really make our meal superb here.

PLEASE do not miss visiting Sushi Hashida Singapore if you are good connoisseurs or simply looking for a good sushi meal. I will come back for more and for sure."
Beautiful lunch,Excellent sushi right in the heart of Orchard Road. The sushi was excellent and it always helps to have a friendly chef to make the experience better. The special cut otoro sushi is a must try!
always one of my to go places for a quick premium sushi fix,"another visit to hashida and it never disappoints. every dish was delist right down to the dessert. this time they served a merlion kaya dessert which was made on their own! made of mochi rice and white chocolate and white miso for fillings, it was wow at every mouthful. very delightful. the ikura and uni don was fresh as usual and I wish I have more of it. thank you for the amazing service and meal :)"
Great traditional Japanese fine dining.,"Looking for a night out in town? I think Hashida Sushi is your answer. Omakase menu ranging from $350-500 per pax. However, if you add in additional dishes it will add on your bill. Ingredients are fresh, chefs always explain to you what you are putting into your mouth. If you love ikura and uni, you will definitely fall in love with their ikura uni rice bowl."
Lunch at hashida,"Had lunch . Chose the 120 ayame set..came a silky soft tofu starter..cawanmushi..then 7 pieces of exquisite sushi ..a mini uni bowl...dessert..a tribute to sg..biscuit in shape of merlion w KAYA inside..absolutely a divine combi.
Svc was tops. We had a great time. Chef was frdly. Wish there was a beef option..definitely a must go plc"
Had very good lunch,"We had Hiiragi for lunch. Very good food quality, presentation. Nice ambience and services. Definitely will come back!"
"Must visit - fresh, unique and personal","Master Chef Hashida delivers a wonderful dining experience. The fish was perfectly fresh, seasoning just right and the setting is quiet and personal. We very much enjoyed chatting with Mr Hashida while he prepared our lunch - we will be back!"
First choice for Jap Omakase,"Unlike other famous Jap resturant in Spore, here I do not have a preferred chef. This place is my first choice for Jap Omakase , especially for dinner. Although it is not cheap, it is value for money compared to other top Jap restaurants here..."
Hashida Sushi,I just like it so much that I have been to Hashida Sushi three times in two months. It is definitely not cheap but I will say it worths every cent. It will give you the authentic Japanese dining experience which is more like an art than cooking. The skills of the chef are amazingly top notch. A real enjoyable night! Pairing with this sake is a perfect choice!
"A muted revelation, an expected dissappintment","The Long and Short:

Well the short first: This is the best sushi I've had in Singapore. But certainly not the best sushi there is.

Bring someone you want to impress! Or you can save a bit more money and go to Japan instead. Either way you will enjoy yourself.

The Long:

We had the Omakase for dinner. While the range is $350-$500, we ended up paying $400 per pax.

Mostly the food was excellent, and the nitpicking were perhaps more to do with the preparation and presentation -Occasionally, the seaweed propping up a piece of sashimi would not hold its place, a slice of lemon would fall over, or the maki was not perfectly symmetrical (though it cannot be overstated that it could have been the best dish of the night, with the bonito sashimi up there).

This is not a pure nigiri sushi place, so there were many other side dishes. Mostly they were delicious. The Chef serving us was also friendly and spoke English - Chef interaction elevates a sushi meal for me.

The verdict, if you're not going to Tokyo soon and have a celebration to justify it, why not!"
Worth my every dollar!,"Flew to Singapore from KL, just to have lunch at this restaurant. Been hearing too much good review about this restaurant and I am so, so glad that they open on a Sunday. Friend who resided in Singapore, made a reservation one month ahead. Love the idea that they only have counter seating in their restaurant. Because it really make a difference. Besides, I really like to see the chef's action while serving our meal.

Our reservation was at 12:30pm but I arrived late from the airport. They waited for our party to be complete before taking our order. I ordered Ayame because I only like nigiri sushi. We were served by Chef Hitoshi. Because I thought that head chef Hashida was not around. But actually he is around all year unless he went back to Japan. So, it's advisable to ask them when you called them for reservation. It's okay to request to be seated in front of the chef that you prefer.

Chef Hitoshi was halfway serving other party, so we waited for a bit before he made our starter. I really like the environment at Hashida. One of the chefs who served at another room, came to our room and was being very talkative, when Chef Hitoshi introduced us to him, saying that we're from Malaysia and can speak Japanese very well. All through our meal, we can hear ourselves laughing and even laughing from other room. It was a really enjoyable dining experience.

Every piece of sushi was very fresh and delicious. The shari was a little bit too chewy (?)for my liking. Actually, the shari was a bit too hard. The uni and ikura bowl was okay. I prefer the one at Sushi Oribe in KL. Hashida's version lacked sweet taste. I would definitely ask them to add one more ingredient to my rice bowl, the next time I revisit.

At the end of our meal, Chef Hitoshi asked were we full? And I added a piece of ootoro sushi for each one of us without asking the price. Luckily the price tag was acceptable."
