Great food and ambience but…,wish there is more time to eat. Two hours for dinner with friends are just not enough. Staff is attentive and food is delish
Wonderful Evening,Another wonderful dinner at Alati. 2nd time at the restaurant and will definitely be back again. Excellent service from Dinesh and Nash! Well done Team Alati!
Excellent service and tasty food,One of the top Greek restaurants in Singapore. Excellent service and food. Our friend's loved the restaurant.
Amazing Greek Dining Experience,"Chanced upon this place walking along Amoy Street to look for something special to try, and we were very blessed to get a table on a Friday evening. And we had the most amazing dining experience here. We are already a fan of Mediterranean food with the pita and dips, and this restaurant really delighted us with the authentic Greek dishes. We had the Spanakopita and Octopus souvlaki with a bottle of superb SMX (Shiraz, Merlot and Xinomavro) by Alpha Estate, all recommended by very friendly staff called Andy (who so graciously chatted with us during meal and shared us about the food and drinks we are having). We had the Alati signature Bougatsa for dessert and Mastiha and Castro coffee liqueur as digestifs. We also learnt something from the boss - Καλή χρονιά! (Pronounced as Kali hronia) that means Happy New Year in Greek. Such a unique and memorable Greek meal that is so worthwhile to experience."
Fantastic food and service,"Alati has become one of my favorite go-to's for a few reasons. Firstly, the food is excellent and there is something for everyone - vegan, vegetarians, meat eaters pescatarians - each person will have a great selection to choose from. Secondly, the ambiance is great, it is beautifully decorated and I love the all-white look. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the service is excellent. Surash has great suggestions and can help you manage the preferences of a large ''sharing' group, making sure everyone is accommodated. I have gone with larger work groups, and with just a table for 2 or 3 and in each case, he has delivered a great meal for us. If I have to give a downside, it can get a bit noisy when the restaurant is completely full - but that's a testament to the great experience they deliver."
What an Amazing Dining Experience!,"We were there to celebrate my husband's birthday and we received the most meticulous service from the restaurant team! I did note in my reservation that it was my birthday and they remembered despite the high customer volume.

As it was our first time there, we trusted their professional recommendations for the dishes in accordance to our preferences and the taste and portions were just right!

The ingredients are fresh and the combination of dishes were well-balanced in terms of flavour - it was nothing short of amazing!

We are definitely heading back with friends and family. This place is located in a convenient location. Coupled with the quality of food and service, it is definitely my new go-to for celebrations or to impress a client.

The next time I visit, I will definitely order the salt baked seabream."
great dinner!,"Stepping into Alati, we were immediately greeted by friendly staff. The interior was a stark contrast to Amoy Street outside, and provided us a very warm welcome. Personally, I love the smell of the place, but that's me. The space was very well utilised, giving off a cosy and relaxed setting without feeling confined in any way. Warm lighting paired well with the whitewashed walls.

It was our first time at Alati (or at a greek resto), so we didn't really know how the portions were nor what to order. We were served by the absolutely marvellous Nash, who really guided us well through the menu and our orders for the night.

We started off with Tzatziki and pita. The olives in the tzatziki were suuper fresh and the pita portion was perfect as a starter for the night.

After, we had two Alati signatures, the grilled octopus and the mosharaki ala polita (slow-cooked angus short ribs). The grilled octopus was worth every dollar (and more, honestly). I think everyone should give this a shot. The articoke puree paired really well for the short rib. The food was nothing too heavy and it left space for dessert.

Once again, Nash provided us with much needed guidance. His recommendation of their caldera kiss was spot on and perfectly completed the meal.

We're grateful for the wonderful service and food!"
Xmas Dinner,"Service was great but food was even better. Servers were friendly and adviced on good pairing of dishes. Overall a little on the pricier side, but I would think it's pretty worth it. Would def come again."
Don't be oressured by staff,"The food was good but expensive. We ordered the grilled octopus, cod roe dip with pita bread and crackers, and salt-baked sea bream (market price) with steamed veg. I was too quick to accept the recommendation of 2 staff. Fortunately, the food was good."
My favorite restaurant in Singapore!,"Amazing food, great service! You should go here if you can get in - reservations are a must! The appetizers, salted fish, desserts ALL AMAZING! I was in Singapore for a week and ate here twice! The food in Singapore in general is very good ... so to go back to Alati twice in one week says it all! Enjoy!"
Birthday visit,Very nice taste. Salad with caramel cheese is extremely amazing. Service is good. Staff - Nash is informative and friendly.
Delicious Greek food in Amoy st,Attentive and friendly service. Dishes are beautifully presented and full of flavors ! Sleek white washed walls made us feel like in Greece :) great to go with friends for sharing meze or as a couple- highly recommended
Advantages of the Restaurant,"Employees are friendly and helpful. The surrounding is clean and serene. The food is delicious, fresh and healthy. The price is reasonable."
Pls order the fried cheese balls with watermelon,"It’s our 2nd time visiting Alati. We were a party of 4 adults plus a 3yo. Overall experience was good, ambience was nice and relaxed, and staff were friendly and patient. Some of the must try dishes were:
Grilled Pita bread with dips platter:
Pita bread was served hot and and it was a very good base for the delicious dips. We loved the egg plant, yoghurt and cod roe dip. The staff recommended us to mix the dips and it was delicious!

Fried Cheese balls with watermelon:
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. It was a memorable dish pairing the cheese balls with watermelon and mint sauce. The balance of the flavour was on point and this was the reason for our 2nd visit!

Salt baked sea bass
Order at the start of the meal as it takes about 45mins to an hour for this dish. The fish was very fresh and fragrant, but a tad dry, in this case the sauces they provided really helped. However the price of the fish was a little on the high side. Our 800g sea bass cost $100. Still, a nice fish if you have some money to splurge.

A dish that I would not recommend would be the octopus and wagyu fat skewer. We were expecting 2 or 3 skewers but it was only 1 skewer, a few pieces of octopus and a few pieces of wagyu fat. It tasted alright but I reckon other dishes were way better in terms of value, such as the lamb chops."
Lovely evening,"Really enjoyed our meal, my daughter wanted to go back the next night. Authentic Greek food and lovely ambiance."
unfortunately it will be our last visit there,"We have been there several times and have always been very satisfied. The food is still very good, but the service and the atmosphere have changed a lot for the worse. No idea if success has gone to the owner's head or if just has had a bad day. The attitude of some waiters as well of the owner felt very arrogant that day. since it was a birthday dinner, we asked for a happy birthday dessert (not for free). Asked several times, there was no answer or reaction. Recommended fish for 4 people was not enough for 2 people. The big hit came at the end, the bill was brought without being asked, although we weren't even finished and it wasn't closing time yet. Really a shame, but we didn't feel welcome"
"Updated decor, same great food and service.","It’s been just over 3 years since our last Alati visit and we r cross we have been depriving ourselves of the great food and service. The salt baked fish was outstanding as was the prawns, chicken, steak and salad. Great wine too. We will be back sooner next time."
Pushy borderline aggressive service,"I was astonished at how pushy and overbearing our waiter was. He was very disappointed we did not order fish( the most expensive item on the menu), and that we did not order any alcohol( we don’t drink alcohol!). He kept hovering over us throughout our dinner, did not give us any privacy to enjoy our meal and conversation. We had asked for some sparkling water and he hurried to fill our glasses to the brim, so he could quickly put another bottle on the table without even asking if we wanted it. The food was ok, definitely did not meet our expectations. The meat dish we ordered came cold, the spanakopita was hard to chew, with stringy spinach. The halloumi salad and the Pavlova dessert were good, the only positive experience during our dinner. Overall, a very overpriced meal, and extremely poor service."
Amazing Service and Food,"The first thing that hit me was the amazing smell inside the restaurant. It smelled a bit like some kind of woody scent but it was so comforting.
The star of our dinner was the lamb and grilled octopus. The octopus was grilled to perfection (not chewy at all) and the lamb had very minimal gamey test (coming from a lamb-hater).
Service was also top-notch. Will definitely be returning to try the other dishes!"
Authentic Greek food- a favourite restaurant in Singapore,Went for dinner here to celebrate a birthday. Amazing authentic Greek food with a lovely ambience. Felt like we were in Greece. The owners are very friendly and gave us recommendations on what to eat and where to go in Greece as we are visiting soon. Highly recommend the salt baked fish and Santorini salad. Recommend booking a table as all the tables were full on a Saturday night. We will be back soon!
Food & Service,"Excellent Food & Service. Dips & Pita bread a great starter, warm everyone's tummy. Lamb cutlets - we ordered medium well, perfectly done & with slight burn on the outside."
Great food,Always good atmosphere for business discussions. Staffs are friendly and quick despite full house. Recommended food is awesome.
Remarkable,Our company of 6 were spoilt by Boss Sophia- remarkable from service to food to the intricacies of personalisation we required. Trust them- at the drop of the hat 🎩
Unique dining experience!,"The food was great! We tried the dip, seafood platter, grilled octopus, lamb cutlet, grilled fish and bougatsa. It was a unique experience, and everyone in our family loved the meal."
Awesome from start to finish,Amazing from start to finish. Ambience was great. Most of the dishes we ordered were amazing. Service was largely decent.
Truly Divine!,"Has to be the best Greek restaurant in Singapore. Authentic and delicious Greek food, with excellent service to match. Shared the starters of smoked eggplant and cod roe dips. Then shared the signature dishes of stuffed cabbage rolls, stuffed roasted eggplants and lamb cutlets. Plus a bottle of Greek Merlot wine, total cost S$414."
"Decent food, nice ambience","Food was decent but did not note anything special. Had a trio of appetizers, followed by a chicken dish."
impeccable,fabulous service from start until the end. food was very tasty well prepared and presented hard to fault except on line booking portal. however highly recommended. will definitely be back
Good food but at very steep prices,"Took my team at work for lunch. Really good main courses. Mezze platter had some really tasty dips. I feel the bread accompanying the platter could have been a bit more generous for that price. We had to keep ordering extra portions.
Service was reasonably good. Over a $80 per head without alcohol or drinks!"
Greek hospitality at its best...,"An excellent Greek restaurant, authentic and warm! Superb food with a great service. Definitely a wholeheartedly recommendation!"
Grtea food and service,"Had a really nice meal at Alati... starters, mains and dessert were all outstanding. One of the best octopuses in SG"
Excellent food and service,"The food we ordered based on staff recommendation were excellent! We had the Taramosalata dip, Santorini salad, Tyrokroketes, grilled octopus, grilled lamb cutlets and salt-baked porgy fish. My friends and I finished every single bit on the table! The pricing is on the higher side but worthy to spend on unforgettable food and memories!"
SUPER RESTAURENT,"This restaurent, food and the quality of service is above par. I was very happy with the service. Excellent and must try!!"
Excellent place for Food and Drinks,A relaxed ambience restaurant and the foods was super. Went back there twice. Just that the food is value for money. Cheers
Excellent Greek fine cuisine,"We enjoyed the great service, excellent food and the Greek wine from Lazaridi Cave. We also appreciated the owner talking with all guests."
Excellent Greek Food & Service,"We had a fantastic dining experience at Alati. This place exceeded our expectations. The decor is very Greek (reminded me of the typical restaurant in Santorini). Our table was right in the middle, so we got a lot of attention, which was nice (though a corner table would have been nicer), but no complains as we will surely be back here. The menu is nice with a lot of interesting dishes to choose from.

The service is excellent and very on the ball, which is great. We really enjoyed chatting with the lovely hosts and owners Yanni and Sofie, such a wonderful couple. Our server Kai was also friendly and made some good recommendations on what we should order. The appetiser was delicious- loved the smoked eggplant with the pita. The grilled squid squid and prawns were delectable. I also loved the grilled octopus - the wine we had paired beautifully with the meal. The dessert was delicious and the vanilla custard was just amazing. We were quite full by the end of the meal - what a lovely experience."
"Delicious, fun but very over priced",Great atmosphere and a good selection of dips to begin with. Over priced baked fish $126 ++. The white wine was crisp and refreshing.
Lovely Greek food!,"The Taramosalata dip is absolutely divine! I would highly recommend it - goes really well with the Pita. We also had the Phyllo-wrapped feta and grilled Milokopi fish. Both are great dishes as well. We wanted to try the fish salt baked but it was an hour wait, which we didn’t have the time for. Great venue for special occasions, as it is quite pricey."
Beyond believe!,"There is Greek food and then… there is Alati!
I have traveled extensively in Greece and enjoyed different versions of the same dishes. However, Alati managed to surprise me me. We ordered several dishes. Among the starters the most amazing one (they were all fantastic) was the octopus. Then followed the main courses: one better than the other. The roasted lamb was extremely well cooked, juicy and tender. Then we had a beef gyros, which was actually beyond words! The beef was soft, juicy, an explosion of flavour in one’s mouth. Finally, another mind, or rather mouth blowing dish: the beef à la Polita. Simply indescribable!
In short, I wholeheartedly recommend anybody to come here!"
Divine cuisine,The food is divine. Each dish is spectacularly balanced with exquisite taste. The atmosphere brings you to the Greek islands. I highly recommend Alati !
Great food....friendly staff..,".Great ambience and the right food for a business lunch !Looks like they have a new Lunch menu and the multi-course option is not available. It would be good to have lamb-chops back on the menu -too.. Special thanks to ""Pavi"" for her attentive service...."
A Little Piece of Santorini in Singapore,"I love the white blue hue of the wall and furniture with unsmoothed finishing.

Thanks to a well balanced recommendation by our friendly waiter Kitus, we decided on the starters and main courses in no time and continue with our Christmas Day catch-up.

The starters were fantastic; started with the pita bread and dips; then to the cheese balls and finally the juucy grilled squid and prawns. We particularly liked the cheese balls served with refreshing watermelon cubes and mint sauce.

The 3 main courses were the highlight of the night; the greek styled grilled milokopi fish was so good. The grilled octopus was extremely tender that u can easily cut it using the butter knife. Finally, the grilled lamb cutlet with lemony sauce was cooked to perfection.

We end the night with classic baklava, lemon pavlova and greek doughnuts. The original sweetness of the baklava and lemon pavlova were too sweet for us.

Nevertheless, it has been an unforgetable Christmas Day dinner which we concluded with a shot of Mastiha liquer.

Well done Alati! For setting a high standard of Greek cuisine in Singapore. Another thank you to our friendly waiter Kitus for helping us to plan the menu."
Super yummy dinner!!!!,Delicious dinner and attentive staff. Amazing authentic Greek dishes; I recommend the octopus-based ones. We’ll come back soon!
One of the best meals I had this year,"Absolutely delicious meal, every dish we ordered was amazing. The salt-baked fish is a must-have. Our main dish was a 650g sea bass (at a very reasonable price!), which was served table side, deboned and paired with three condiments. The hostess was kind enough to recommend a salad with our fish, which paired really well. Even their house white wine was delicious. A truly wonderful experience, thank you so much!"
❤,The best Greek Restaurant in the World and in general the best in Singapore!! A big BRAVO for all the guys/ladies who work in ALATI..
Probably best Greek restaurant in Singapore,"This cozy restaurant in Amoy Street has become my favourite Greek restaurant in Singapore. You walk into the restaurant and you see the fish of the day displayed on a bed of ice beckoning you to order one. The fish are all imported from Greece. The unique dish about Alati is the salt-baked fish - which you absolutely must order, especially for dinner. We ordered the sea bream, salt baked, which was cracked opened and deboned in front of us after about 40 mins. It was simply heavenly, incredibly sweet and light and moist. Before the fish, we ordered the dips platter with Pita - the dips are all fabulous - they each have a unique flavour and goes well with the Pita. We also have the Phyllo-wrapped feta - crispy pastry that is dripped with honey. As for dessert, we ordered the Lemon pavlova, Loukoumades and the signature Bougatsa. The latter was by far the best of the lot, so if there is only room for one dessert, get the Bougatsa - it is also instagram worthy. As for wine, we went with the Avantis Geraki - a ethereal blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Malagouzia grapes, a perfect accompaniment to the fine dishes. To top it off, the owner Yianni came by and greeted us a few times and also treated us to a shot of Mastika, a sweet liquer that we downed as a fitting end to our meal. Service was excellent throughout - so a well deserved 5 star. In my opinion, Alati is better than all other Greek restaurants in Singapore, not least of which it is unique in offering the salt baked fish."
Great food and service!,"Great service from our server, Kai. Owner was also very friendly. Food recommendation from Kai was on point and we thoroughly enjoyed the food at Alati. Overall very satisfied with the atmosphere, service and food. Would definitely come back here again!"
terrific,"food n service was fantastic! generous portions, fresh ingredients. restaurant is also bright & clean."
Could not fault!,"We just happened to be passing by and were glad we did. A last minute cancellation saw us getting a seat and for a little while, felt we were in Greece. The hospitality was amazing, as was the food and wine. 5/5 the whole way!"
Excellent Lamb Ribs,Visiting for the 2nd time. Extremely fresh food. We have fish and lamb. Which were both extremely fresh. We plan to go again.
Feels like in Greece,"This is one of the best Greek restaurants I have tried in Singapore. It was my 3rd visit and the food never disappoint me. The staff are attentive, boss is friendly. The tyrokroketes, salt baked fresh catch, different types of souvlaki and dips, its signature dessert, Bougatsa are ""must try"". Simply love it!"
Fantastic experience,Taste was exquisite considering this is our first ever attempt on Greek cuisine. We didn’t know what to expect from it but in the end we left the restaurant as satisfying customers. Give it a try for those who have never tasted Greek food.
Superb experience,"Great to have dinner at their place. everything from the menu, to the service, to the food was ideal. 100% must try"
Thank you!!,"We had such a nice evening at Alati. Really Devine. Food was great, drinks as well and dessert was just spectacular (Alati Signature). Atmosphere and service was amazing as well. We will be back!! THANK YOU🙏"
Great little gem,"Great food. Hot and fresh Great service by Elsie. Food was hot, fresh, authentic and great. Great atmosphere. Usb ports under the bar was a nice touch. Great little gem in Clearwater"
Dinner - Superb meal,One of the best meals we have had in Singapore. Quality of fish and meats was superb. Strongly recommended to try this place. Amazing dessert. Very good Ambience. Good service and the best greek outside Greece.
Best Greek restaurant in Singapore,"In one word, AMAZING.

THE best Greek restaurant in Singapore a d one of the best I had the pleasure of visiting during the recent years. Rivals the best restaurants in Athens!!!

If you want a real Mediterranean experience with a Greek favor this is the place to be.

Simply great."
Best Greek food in Singapore,"We love going to Alati as a family and with our friends. The food is so fresh, healthy and yummy! The staff and the owner go out of their way to make the whole experience of dinning out amazing! The closest to being in Greece for sure!"
Alati - Best Greek Cuisine in Singapore,"Was great to go back to Alati after a few months absence due to Lockdown. As always, the service was very good. The food and drinks absolutely outstanding. Fresh and delicious. Thank you Alati team."
Fantastic find,"Loved the ambience, decor and food! All the dishes were fantastic and the staff provided helpful recommendations to help us with our order. Can’t wait to return!"
"Great food, Ambience & Service!","The food was great, the staff were attentive and helpful. The ambience was great too. The menu choices were good. Only improvement we can suggest is they have a few more vegetarian options. The grilled lamb and chicken dishes were simply fantastic. Highly recommended."
Great ambiance and dishes,"Loved the ambiance, dishes were delicious too. The servers were very attentive to us. I think it was slightly pricier for lunch."
"Great food, excellent service. We will be back","Great food. We enjoyed everything from beginning till the end. The staff provided very good recommendations too, perfect for us, a party of four to share. Perfect portion and we thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience very much.

Great for business , friends, couples or family. I will certainly come back with my family!"
Good Food,Service was very personal. Elvin gives good recommendations & was attentive to our needs . The fish was the best!
Birthday dinner,"Thank you to the lovely staff especially K.JHA, K.Pom and K.pit at the Alati for creating this wonderful birthday decorations for our dinners! I really recommend to visit this place very nice and delicious food.
Thump up for all the staff very friendly and warm welcome :)"
Great Greek restaurant,One of the very few restaurants in town serving authentic and good quality Greek cuisine. Enjoyable meal thanks to the friendly owners!
Loveliest experience,"Came here for mom's birthday, the food was fantastic, good for sharing with family or friends - or just yourself, because delicious. The dips and starters were all very appetizing and very delicious. I love all cheese things! The mains were also fantastic, we had the greek baked fish, lamb, beef short ribs, and octopus. Dessert was also pretty satisfying, my favorite being the pavlova.

Ambience wise was lovely. The deco and colors make the place feel bright and homely, accompanied by good music - my mother liked it a lot. Also notable was the impeccable service. Everyone was so sweet, patient and attentive. Price-wise is a little steep, but it is most impressive that my hard-to-please father said that he would like to visit again :)"
Outstanding dining experience,We visited the restaurant as a family of three and ordered a bunch of co-sharing and individual items. Portion sizes were just right and well worth the money. The table service was very attentive and the restaurant manager was very warm and welcoming. This is definitely a restaurant worthy of revisits many times over.
Probably one of the worst customer service experiences.,"If it takes time for someone to come out of the door to genuinely ask to come inside or ask for reservation is kind of understandable, the fact that a lady working there sarcastically asking if I see any free table and pointing me to look at their entire restaurant real-estate is absolutely appalling and shocking.

I just said, I changed my mind and politely left by the door.Worse still?The gentleman asking the lady what happened, they communicate in a foreign language which obviously I don't understand, and they guy asking my friend if we see any free table? Good luck!"
Superb Greek Seafood,"As the title suggests, the seafood was amazing. In fact all the dishes were excellent: the choice of wine was good too. Owners and staff super friendly and care about the customers. It is a must try."
A slice of authentic Greece in the CBD,"Very tasteful dishes, authentic Greek cuisine in a pleasant, attractive setting on Amoy Street. Wait staff were attentive but not as knowledgeable about the menu as can be. Owner (John) did his rounds and engaged us very nicely which was a nice touch. Menu on the pricey side but the food was of sufficient quality to justify the pricing."
A corner of authentic Greek dining experience,"Congrats to the Alati team for creating a dining experience using the ingredients of the modern Greek gastronomy. Eating out is a combination of menu, wine list, ambience and service and Alati puts everything together in the most tasty way. We enjoyed a delicious sea bass baked in salt crust paired with a wonderful white dry Greek wine. And to top it all Alati s version of a millefeuille"
Homely on Amoy,"Great place, nice ambience. Good food. Appetizers were very good. Great service. Menu can be expanded."
Excellent food and service,"We enjoyed excellent food and service. We had a 2015 reservation. The staff politely reminded us of the ""covid restrictions"" and the ""timing"" of the kitchen closing and when the alcohol would be cleared. Although the table was cleared at 2230, we stayed until after 2300 enjoying the atmosphere. I would highly recommend."
Excellent for birthday dinner with friends,Excellent food and service. The bugatsa (I hope I’m spelling it right) was outstanding. Got a free shot of Greek liquor at the end too. Must order the fish and lamb.
Authentic Yummy Greek,"Authentic and delicious Greek food. Owner pay attention to all the finest details to make 1 feels that we are really dinning in one of the white-washed houses in Greece. Service by our server, Mr Andy was excellent. He's of the the best server I met. Informative, great suggestion n fabulous attention n service!

I want bring more of my other friends there"
Nice ambiance but quite pricy,"Beautiful place and great service, however the food was a bit expensive compared to the quality (smaller portions for dips and desserts could help lower the price)"
Birthday dinner,Food was amazing but service was even better!! 100/100 recommend for date night. Authentic greek food and the staff were super super friendly. Would come again!
Good Food and Great Service!,Very impressed with the service and hospitality by Lydia as she recommended and explained the food items to us! Will definitely come back again for more food. (:
Good,"I ordered dinner of grilled prawns and eggplant which were delicious. My drink was peppermint tea (as per the menu “by the pot”), but I got it in a cup. Upon requesting for a refill the waiter told me that they usually do not give refills. Another waiter brought me a pot of hot water. If this is the case, please amend your menu and remove “by the pot” to avoid confusing your patrons."
Disappointing experience,"Having seen a number of good reviews online, we decided on Alati for a nice dinner and arrived in high spirits and great expectation on a Fri evening. We ordered the Haloumi Salad, Cheese Eggplant Balls and Grilled Octopus. The former 2 dishes were fine however the latter was too salty to be consumed. It was truly disappointing and worse yet, the server in charge of our area was intent on justifying how the dish should taste, without a word of apology! We ended up returning the Grilled Octopus and sharing the 2 dishes instead. Later we asked if there was time for dessert but was told the table was already scheduled for the next seating. And of course the restaurant was only 1/2 full then! The bill then arrived briskly without our ask!! A less than desired experience from a well established restaurant. We paid and left without turning back, needless to say there won’t be a second time round."
Great food and service,"The food and desserts were delicious especially the dips, the fried donuts and signature dessert which they had recommended. The tastes for some dishes were somewhat mild but to my liking. The staff were attentive and helpful. Overall the food was slightly pricey but worth it given the quality of the food and the ambiance."
Taste of Greek,Attentive staff and delicious food! We ordered ala carte items and the staff recommended us many delicious food. The price is quite costly though.
Divine Greek dishes,"Highly recommend the Octopus Souvlaki - the charred grill octopus and Wagyu beef was amazing and I am definitely returning for that.
Wide range of dishes on the menu - their Bougatsa dessert was unique and pleasant to eat with the combination of sweet cinnamon pastry and refreshing orange ice cream.
Overall, a cosy and quaint restaurant to dine in. Looking forward to trying more items on the menu"
Still as good as the first time!,"This has got to be one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore! It was my second time visiting, and once again I was so impressed with both the food and the service. As with my last visit, every dish we ordered was delicious...the marinated octopus was so amazingly tender and the fried cheese balls were delicious, especially with that fresh, bright citrus chutney that they were served with. We could smell the nutmeg in the moussaka as soon as it arrived at the table, and it was rich and comforting, and was just like the one we had in Delphi when we visited Greece a few years ago. And I insisted we order the beef short ribs, which I had last time, and they were just as fantastic as I remembered, so tender and full of flavour with that gorgeous artichoke puree. Desserts were equally as divine, I loved how fresh and light the pavlova was, and the loukoumades were a delicious doughy treat. And I forgot how generous the portions are, we were stuffed! Such great value for money, both in terms of the portion and also the excellent quality of each dish.

And I'd also like to compliment the service. Our main server, an older gentleman, was excellent. Friendly but not at all intrusive, he was attentive throughout the evening, checking on our enjoyment of the dishes and very politely ensuring we were done with our plates before clearing them or serving the next course. He also offered more drinks and desserts at the appropriate times, and I was very impressed with the easy flow of service. There was a younger woman who also helped out, and did a fantastic job of keeping our water glasses full throughout our dinner, we never had to ask for a refill once.

Both of my visits so far have been excellent, and with such a delicious and varied menu, lovely atmosphere and great service, I'm already planning to return soon!"
"Amazing people, amazing food","Great experience with friendly owners and staff, and great atmosphere! Very delicious food - loved everything we ordered (:"
Great meal and service,"Love the ambience, friendly staff and owners. Food was amazing as always! Will visit again :) thank you for the experience"
escapade to Santorini,"in an unprecedented time when travelling overseas is nearly impossible, much less to walk along seaside cliffs of Santorini, our evening at Alati provided exactly that - a brief but utterly memorable escapade to that beautiful Greek island, conjured up by the lovely white and Cerulean blue decor of the restaurant, the attentive team headed by our lovely head waiter Kumar and another jovial dusty haired gentleman (Im so terribly sorry I didn’t ask for his name - am assuming he is the owner?), and of course the amazingly fresh and delicious food :) came here for birthday meal with a group of girlfriends, and truthfully this was actually our second choice because their competitor was fully booked, but I have to say that at the end of the meal I do not regret coming to Alati and in fact will definitely be back again. Thank you very much to Kumar who patiently guided us through the menu to accommodate our group’s tastes (yes we are the group where one of us is partial to feta cheese and another to eggplant) and even gave us thoughtful recommendations to order the cured roe dip instead of the dips platter because of above food preferences - which was wonderful and we couldn’t stop lapping it up. And then the meze of grilled prawns which was the highlight of the night - that smoky char and saltwater freshness! Unfortunately we were so greedy with mains - had the lamb and angus short ribs both! including other sides of cheese balls and fried potatoes that we had absolutely no space for dessert - but I have my eye on the phyllo pastry on the menu for the next visit. So many thanks again to Kumar, you made our evening at Alati very memorable with that personal touch :) my only very tiny gripe is that when our final main of lamb came, one of the young female waitress squeezed it into the side of our table which was already full without saying anything or offering to clear some of the empty plates (the long plate which served the grilled prawn was already empty and in fact quite hefty and taking up quite a lot of space on the table) - I can understand it was a busy night and she probably had a lot of other tables to serve - but nevertheless for a finer dining restaurant and after such excellent service from the rest of the team, that moment was abit discomfiting - so perhaps that’s the only thing I might feedback for improvement, that it would be nicer for the staff to bring up the mains with abit more finesse (it was the $40 lamb dish after all). Didn’t spoil the night however, and we still left happy and full :) Thank you to the team and chefs at Alati for making my birthday meal so memorable!"
Great dining place.,Mains and desserts are great. Awesome atmosphere as well. We ordered the salted baked fish then donuts for dessert - they are all very delicious. It is a place that you will want to go back again to try other dishes.
"Wonderful atmosphere, welcoming service and great food","We had the fish baked in salt, a couple of the signature dishes and tried some great wines! overall wonderful visit, and we would certainly go back. everything about the restaurant is welcoming and personable- the space, the service and the ambience."
Best Greek in Singapore,"Was able to secure a table last minute and this place blew my mind. Incredible service, authentic decor, delicious food and I want to eat there every meal! Took my back to our last trip to Greece. Best place EVER"
Food and Service,"Food was awesome and service was excellent! Staffs were very kind and polite. Atmosphere was cosy, a place to chill. Even if i was not in Greece, the ambience totally make up for it."
good times,Food and wines and decor and location are good. Owner is warm and entertaining. Will make this a regular venue
Great experience at Alati,Really enjoyed our dinner at Alati. There were lots of vegetarian options and each of the dishes tasted excellent. Overall cost including a bottle of wine was quite reasonable. Definitely recommend a visit.
A must try for Greek food lovers,"We went in August after stumbling upon the website. We have always loved Greek food and thought why not.

Arrived and the restaurant was quite crowded. We were ushered to a table for 4 people.

We ordered the platter of dips with pita bread. They were delicious. Also ordered the Greek salad, moussaka, beer batter cod fillet, chicken, cheese balls, wagyu skewer and donuts. We had a bottle of wine to go along.

Service was friendly and the owner of the place was very welcoming. Offered us a nice Greek after dinner drink which we thought was a lovely end to an already beautiful evening.

We will come back for sure as what’s not to like about this place :-)"
Great Place for a Biz Lunch,The restaurant was busy but they seated us expediently. The service was attentive. The food was fresh and wholesome. My tea was not hot but when I raised this it was immediately replaced. I will definitely come back.
"Great service, fresh seafood, pretty interior.","Food was good, Seafood was fresh. Service was excellent. Special thanks to Kumar and his team on 27/10/2020’s evening. They displayed very good product knowledge by knowing their menu well without reference. Kumar and his staff also elaborated beyond the menu descriptors & provided good recommendations according to our preferences. They were also very prompt in attending to our table needs such as topping up water, clearing and changing our plates without being disruptive. The restaurant was got more crowded through the night but every service staff still carried a poised and friendly attitude throughout consistently. Looking forward to be back for the welcoming service and to try their good selection of Greek wines."
Nice,"Nice place. Good food. Good beer. Good service. Not my favourite Greek Restaurant in Singapore, but I would hesitate going back."
Fantastic Greek restaurant and a very friendly team,"Five of us visited Alati last night and we were blown away from start to finish, we quite literally couldn't have been happier with the way the evening went.

We ordered dishes to share and I can confirm that everything was very good but it was the 'Mosharaki ala polita' (Angus short ribs accompanied with lemony Jerusalem artichoke puree & charred baby carrot ) that stood out for me. The 'Bakaliaros' (a battered cod fillet accompanied with lemony quinoa & herbal- garlic sauce) was also enjoyed by a couple of people at our table, then of course there was the grilled octopus with aubergine puree, the salad, the cabbage rolls with seabass and crab.... the list goes on...!

We made a mistake with our first bottle of wine and the owner quickly came to our aid, removing the bottle (from both the table as well as the bill) and we moved onto a very enjoyable Syrah that we ended up ordering 4 bottles of in the end (not to mention the Ouzo and multiple rounds of 'Mastiha')! The entire front of house team were brilliant in fact. Celebrating a birthday, at one stage everyone in the restaurant was singing along with us that was really unexpected and truly memorable!

During this COVID-19 period, we have been going to a lot of restaurants in Singapore given we aren't travelling at all and we all agreed that the evening at Alati was a particularly special one, highly recommended!"
"Homely, Comforting yet Lux",Food is the top notch. One of my favourite date night places with warm service from Yannis and Sophia! Love this Greek restaurant.
