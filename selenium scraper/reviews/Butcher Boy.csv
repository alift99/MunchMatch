Isn’t worth a recommendation,"We were recommended this especially online and because the relationship with Cure we were sure this was going to be great.
Pretty sure we got the wrong meat, because the server gave us another serving first, and the bill said other ways. So the angus served looked like roast beef and tasted like roast beef.
It was no good.

The waiters were not attentive and we needed to wait long for drinks, and was into the meal before we got them.

When we finished the dinner 15:45 we asked to get the menu for the desserts. We were told the kitchen had already closed at 15:00. We arrived at the place 15:00 and ordered mains around 15:15…….

It seems the place has potential, but this visit was a tragedy."
We didn’t like it,Very poor experience..food and service were average. The price very high for what we ate. I won’t come back. In Singapore you can eat much better with those prices
200gm beef short rib pastrami - it worked for me,"BB is located in a really cool part of Singapore, so if you turn up announced and BB is full, don't despair. You will find solace elsewhere.

But we had a booking at BB and I found solace in the pastrami.

We ordered a few other items - some nori pie tee shell, salmon tacos and burrata, but it was the pastrami that I enjoyed."
Dinner and Drinks,"We ordered sticky lamb ribs and beef rendang...it was delicious that we ordered second set! But as for the drinks, they could improve it and the chicken wings was tasteless!"
Another great visit,"I recently returned to Butcher Boy after seeing some new tempting menu items, with a friend this time, who was visiting for the first time. I sent a couple of requests by email before our meal, asking to be seated at a low table indoors and to keep the table for 2 hours, and Stanley replied promptly and was very helpful and happily granted my requests.

The food was once again excellent, as anticipated! I had to get my usual fried chicken bao, which were just as good as I remembered, and tried the karana jackfruit and mushrooms pot stickers and sticky glazed lamb ribs as well, both of which were fantastic! The pot stickers were full of flavour with a fantastically crispy skirt, and the lamb ribs were super meaty with very little fat, and incredibly tender, and the sweet sticky glaze was the perfect compliment. My friend loved her scallop ceviche and laksa dumplings, and couldn't stop raving about the flavours in both dishes. We also had dessert, she enjoyed the coconut ice cream sandwich (they looked so yummy, I'm planning to come back to try them) and the strawberry charcoal pavlova was divine, a perfect pav with a crispy exterior and marshmallowy centre, and just the right level of sweetness. My friend was so impressed she's planning to bring her husband one day soon, and I was reminded again why I keep returning to Butcher Boy, and will continue to do so!"
Sunday roast,"Service was lovely, the lady serving us (Didn’t catch her name) was attentive and pleasant. Food was alright, I enjoyed the brussell sprouts (although q greasy too), potatoes and mash. The main event was Yorkshire pudding but was disappointed that the base was extremely greasy it just tasted like oil soaked pastry. (I’m a person who is liberal with greased food but this is quite next level). Chicken breast was tender but there was something in between that was powdery that wasn’t to my liking. Bloody Mary was refreshing."
Nice and creative fusion food,The food are a mix of different culture’s flavour. Very nicely done. The steak is really good. The wine is good choices too
Great to be able to enjoy sunday roast,We love butcher boy sunday roasts and had many during lockdown delivered and was great to be able to go into the restaurant today and enjoy a shared roast with friends! the bloody mary's are a must !
"Stellar service, superb food pairing","Butcher Boy is easily the top 3 restaurants I would return to in Singapore - without a question. My friends and I were greeted with a gorgeous warm-lit interior and a wall of fine alcohol selection, with an even finer menu selection which were absolutely a HUGE umami party in our mouths! We had nothing but praises for each dish, and the cocktails gave us a nice buzz throughout the evening. No matter the occasion, this is the place to go for a great night out. You can trust the team’s recommendations, you’ll be so pleased to know that everyone stops and listens and thoughtfully picks out items on the menu according to your needs. Make no mistake, the restaurant was PACKED! Much thanks, will 100% return."
Evening dinner,Excellent food with a friendly service. We tried the set menu. All the courses were delicious and there was plenty of food. Would definitely recommend. We will be back!
Hidden Gem in Keong Saik,First time trying butcher boy and we are really satisfied with pretty much things that we ordered. The food are all delicious and the price is very reasoable. Most important is all the staffs are very friendly and sweet 😋 will definitely comeback again.
Drinks,"Nice venue, great location and service. When the bill came they had undercharged by one drink and when I raised it they said it’s on them. This review is not because of one free drink but because of service and proposing drinks that suited our tastes. Thanks u and will he back!"
Good lunch out!,"Delicious last meal out before restaurants shut. Had a booking for the Sunday and the restaurant called and offered us a table for Saturday instead.

Absolutely lovely customer service, attentive yet not over the top.

Had the lunch menu with the pork and steak with fries and tomato salad. Really good food. Ordered a side of the Szechuan Brussels - they were lovely just not as chilli-y as expected.

Would defo recommend when open again!"
The Service was as amazing as the Food,"The food here was amazing!, but what i want to emphasise on is the SERVICE!, my girlfriends and i really appreciate the attention to details given and the genuine friendly energy that the staff has. Their reccomendation of food was on point, to customising the meal to accommodate our group is definitely something we will always remember!. We will definitely be back"
Nice late Sunday lunch,"Nice late Sunday lunch
Great service and prompt delivery.
My wife and had roast beef and Yorkshire puddings.
Yorkshire puddings were great as were the roast potatoes.
Sichuan Brussels sprouts didn’t work for me and the carrot miso purée was ok.
beef was disappointing, looked great but a bit mushy inside, probably suvee? Anyway lacked texture.
Overall a nice experience at a reasonable (for Singapore) price."
Great service!,"We were celebrating 2 of our friends' birthdays, and I mentioned in my reservation. We got free birthday shots as well as a complimentary cake. Didn't even need to ask for it. When I wanted to order a dessert for the 'birthday cake', the waiter who was in charge of our table told me he got it covered. Overall v attentive and good service! Food was slightly pricey, and portion wasn't huge but still yummy. 100% will go back."
brunch session,Sunday roast menu is great and if you like yorkshire pudding its a must to try. Small place so defo need to book
brunch session,Sunday brunch menu is great and if you like yorkshire pudding its a must to try. Small palce so defo need to book
Another delicious Sunday lunch!,"As always the food was top notch at Butcher Boy. A little, well a lot, disappointed that there was no Roast Chicken left at our 1pm reservation. I had the beef though and it was good. Everything else was great, lovely miso carrots. The gravy is the best."
Great food! Avoid the cocktails.,"Food was amazing. The cocktails, were not. Especially at $22-25 each. Stick to beer and wine and you will have an amazing night. The pot stickers and Brussel sprouts were incredible."
Lovely ambience and starters,"Starters, staff and ambience was really nice. I was not so keen on the steak! It seemed like the steak was a souse vide case. That is really not to my taste. That said thanks for a lovely night!"
Superb food n great people.,Superb food n great people. Never fail to make me proud when I bring friends n guests to dine there. Making us feel like VVIP. Thank you Butcher Boy!
Marvellous Butcher Boy!,"Loved our night at Butcher Boy - service was great, food fantastic and a wonderful ambience - highly recommend the Peking Pork bau buns, absolutely delicious!!"
My fave place in Singapore,The most amazing food & drinks and even better service. The guys are super accommodating and friendly and always try to cater to your requests. A customer could not ask for more!
Outstanding Service!,"Had my birthday celebration here and we ordered a variety of starters, sides and mains to share. What stood out to me were the beef tatare, Szechuan brussels, nori pie tee shells & US prime beef short rib pastrami with white peppercorn but the Iberico pork was disappointing though, it just tastes like char siew..... But service was really outstanding, attentive staff & also not to mention, special thanks to Terrence for his recommendations! Will definitely be back again for your new menu!"
Great Sunday roast,Went for Sunday lunch. Food was great - a traditional British Sunday roast with an Asian twist. Meat was excellent quality and well cooked and veggies were yum . Good service- definitely recommend.
Had the best experience,"Sat at the bar counter and had great conversations with Mike the bartender. Every single dish in the Vday menu was SO GOOD from appetizers to dessert - no regrets at all spending Valentine's there. There's a comfortable, modern vibes and ambience throughout the place. This shall be our go-to restaurant when we want to pamper ourselves with a good meal!"
"Average food, lacks vibe","We had heard good reviews of the restaurant & ended up there on a Saturday night. While the restaurant was full, there was a dullness in the ambience. The servers seemed like they were just doing their job rather than providing good service.
The cocktails were quite run of the mill too. I enjoyed the Asian fusion laksa starter but our steak was below average. It was medium rather than medium rare with nothing to write home about.
Not a place I’d recommend."
"Great service, great food!","From the crew to the food, everything was great!! We especially loved the hamachi sashimi and iberico secreto!! The drinks and desserts were great too. Chose this place to celebrate a birthday and the staff were so so accommodating and friendly to provide a dessert and birthday shots on the house!! Thank you for that :) will definitely bring my family and friends to this place!"
Birthday Celebration,"Celebrated my wife birthday with bunch of friends at this restaurant. Was served by a team of friendly staff. Food was great, atmosphere was great and service was perfect. Would highly recommend friends and family. Have a blast and good food for the stomach. 👍🏼"
"""Food was mind-blowing. Personal","""Food was mind-blowing. Personal favourites that i believe are must try would be the chicken baos, short rib and the szechuan brussels. The signature cocktail list offered a unique take on classic flavours especially the holy smokes. Service was very attentive and friendly which made you feel very comfortable being in the venue and on top of that the ambience was just absolutely top notch"""
Yum,Well worth it. Great food and drinks. Well worth going to. I particularly enjoyed the laksa while the rest of the table devoured the bao buns.
Delicious food highly recommend,Delicious food highly recommend it all except the edamame hummus it’s was a random choice but a bad one!! Definitely revisit this place great atmosphere too
Simon,"Had been a while since the last visit, the service , food and all round experience was as good as the last time. Great service is not always easy to find in Singapore but they are very good here , can recommend Butcher Boy ."
Best Sunday lunch spot,Have been here twice in the last two months for Sunday roast lunch and will definitely be back!! Service is perfect - attentive but not over the top. Food is just heavenly. Today we had beef Wellington for 2 with all the trimmings. Brussels sprouts and carrot mash really perfect! Roasties always hit the spot and last time I went the Yorkshire puddings were the best I have ever tasted!! Highly recommended for a roast lunch !!
Great service but equally annoying!,"Overall we had a good time at Butcher Boy last night. The food is scrumptious - chicken bao, chicken and prawn satay has flavours exploding in your mouth and the Striploin cooked to perfection. Service is attentive. Now for the annoying part. Constantly (every 20 minutes or so) we were reminded that we had the table for 1 hour 45 minutes which made the atmosphere a tad bit tense and we felt rushed to place orders, gobble every bite quickly and get out. Maybe 1 hour 45 minutes is ok for some but we were 5 of us and had a lot to catch-up on and this constant pestering put a dampener on the atmosphere. If you have a table paying $500+ then change your policy as your customers deserve to have a more relaxed atmosphere. Won't be back anytime soon if they have their stop watch on!"
Good food friendly service,Pork belly bao was the best. Pastrami was fatty but abit dry. hamachi and Brussel sprouts were also good. Service was excellent!
Amazing value for money lunch,Lunch sets were great value for money! Great service and food. We particularly enjoyed the beef short ribs and heirloom tomatoes.
Perfect place for a catchup dinner,"The three of us settled into a table outside by request to have the ambiance of the coolest street in Singapore. The service was first rate and food exceeded my expectations with sashimi that melted in your mouth, crispy squid, sea bass and steak accompanied by wine and cocktails. Well worth a visit."
Group dinners,Pre-covid this was a great place to come with a big group of friends. Sharing menu with lots of wine. They also do a great Sunday roast.
"Top quality service, delicious","Top quality service, delicious fusion food and recommendations by the team. Second visit in a week and no disappointments."
"Fantastic meal, staff and atmosphere","We were 5 people celebrating someone’s birthday on a Saturday night. We ordered nearly everything on the menu (all to share) and every dish was magnificent. The two different bao dishes were highlights, as were the beef options at the end. Nothing disappointed.

The staff were amazing and friendly and helpful and we basically had a thoroughly brilliant evening as a result of them and the food.

Would highly recommend it. The most common phrase amongst the group at the end of the night and the following Monday morning was: ‘Butcher Boy is now my favourite restaurant in Singapore.’"
Top notch “Sunday Roast”,Great Food and service - Had the Sunday Roast - Very good - Excellent service in a relaxed atmosphere - Recommended
"Good food - simple, fresh, flavorful","Went to catfish last week and was a happy diner there so decided to try butcher boy this week and yet another great dining experience. Edamame hummus, tomato burrata salad was wonderfully refreshing and hearty. Short rib was tender and tasty. Shoe string fries was crisp, tasty and satisfying. Will certainly return! The only thing I might skip next time is the mocktail."
Dinner at butcher boy,Good food and spacious seating. The pao/bun they serve are delicious! Will definitely go again but do remember to make a reservation. Hardly any chance to walk in.
Sunday Roast!,Very good Sunday Roast! Crispy pork belly was great but the beef rockz! It will be perfect if they have the typical Icy cold sapporo beer on tap to go with.
Excellent dinner,"Had a real excellent dinner: I took two small plates, the tartare and the sashimi and the kale salad. My boyfriend had the burger. Everything was really amazing! Sashimi is to die for. The service is really good as well: we got served by the lovely Nicole who recommended us also some plates.
We will be back!"
Awesome experience,"Came highly recommended to us from friends and it was our first time visit. It was also our last visit as a couple as my girlfriend was due to give birth the following day so it was a special evening for us and it did not disappoint!
The food was incredible and our waiter (Dwayne) provided an amazing service and was excellent. Gave us some incredible recommendations on dishes and looked after us very well.

We’ll be back as soon as soon the baby is able to eat solids!"
Great lunch spot.,"A lovely, relaxed place with delicious food and wine. The short rib an absolute must. Cracking, relaxed staff make it a must go."
Soooo good!!,Brilliant food and service! Cannot wait to go back... def our new fave.Thanks to the incredible Nadine and team xx 👌🏼🙏
Great food & cocktails,"Loved it, great food and awesome cocktails. Would totally recommend coming here for Sunday roast and cocktails"
"Great food, vibes and service","This restaurant is definitely one my family and I will be going back to. The food was incredible with great presentation. The design and interior of the restaurant was also stunning, the only thing I could fault them on is that a couple times we did have to remind them about our drinks but the good very much overrided the bad. Thank you to the amazing staff who moved my family and I from the bar to a table apon request you guys were awesome and brought great vibes!"
Good vibe but not all food impressed,"Staff is friendly and makes you feel welcome immediately. Interior design is cool. Starters were good (but expensive), the buns are yummy! As for the (again, expensive) mains, the sirloin was ok (the burnt/charcoalt exterior is not my thing though), the ""thai style"" fried fish was terrible and we didn't eat it. Poor thing died invane. The self-praised (expensive :) brussels sprouts were just ok (go learn from DonHo!). It was cold inside. 250SGD for 2 with only a glass of wine each and no dessert is just too much."
Initial poor service,"The girl on the greeters stand was objectionable. They sent me an SMS which said Bar service. I had requested the opposite. So (incorrectly) I assumed it was a mistake.
When I told her this it was kind of ""take it or leave it"" Lucking the young gentleman who intervened was extremely helpful and found us a table. The food was eclectic the crab gravy and mantou buns was unusual with neither of them being quite original but they were a twist from the norm.
The pork belly was so so but the beef short ribs were good.
Service was attentive."
Great Ambience and Food!,Loved the ambience and food. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a nice place to bring a special someone for a special meal!
Best service and food!,Love the food here and the service is top notch! Friendly peeps here definitely back here again.....
Amazing!!!!!,"Best Sunday Roast ever!!!
I ate the pork, my husband had the beef and our kids had the chicken. The food was absolutely delicious! The desserts were also amazing!!! The staff are all very friendly and attentive, as we were celebrating Father’s Day, they even brought out a complimentary dessert for my husband. Our very first visit but so impressed we will be back soon.
Thank you Butcher Boy for a fabulous experience."
Best Sunday lunch in Singapore,"I still haven't been apart from for Sunday lunch but this was my second time coming here for that and I heartily recommend this. It's a lot of your traditional British roast dinner but with a little Asian twist in a couple of the dishes. Really tasty, i had the beef and that just melts in your mouth when eating it. Potatos are nice and crispy on the outside yet soft in the middle and Yorkshire puddings are freshly made. Service here is also great, staff are really friendly and welcoming. Highly recommended coming here. Though a word of warning if you want to come for Sunday lunch best to book a table mid week to make sure you get a spot as this place is populal."
Does Not Get Any Better!,"It’s so hard to find consistently great food, friendly service and ambiance in Singapore. Butcher Boy is the best at all of these. My husband and I have been a few times and feel like royalty when we visit. We love the staff and will return as long as we are in SG! Thanks Guys!!!"
Definitely a place to be,"Serve delicious food, amazing drinks and wholesome service from the staff. Asian fusion cuisine with a delightful twist and cocktails that are customisable to your very liking in a ambience that is warm and cozy."
Great food and superb staff,"Came for dinner with my girlfriend. We loved all the food we ordered, lots of flavour, perfect size and very well served. The service was above expectations. We will certainly repeat"
"Cosy Ambience, Good Food, Excellent Service","It was our second time at Butcher Boy and the place lived up one more time to our expectations.
We have done quite a few steak House in Singapore and we really like the cosy ambience of Butcher Boy. It is rare to get a bad steak in a steakhouse in Singapore, but Butcher Boy rises above the rest of them.
Food-wise their version of Beef tartare is one of the best tartare I had, and the Peter's Kale and Mushroom salad as a side dish was a delicious discovery this time. There are a few options for non-meat lovers as well. Service is discreet and attentive and prices of dishes and wines are decent for Singapore. Would definitely be back"
Best place for Sunday roast,Best place for Sunday roast with a slight Asian twist. Food is always amazing as are the cocktails. Staff are also great and very attentive.
Roast beef great and pork was fair,Roast great and pork was fair Drinks add up quickly to the extortion level so beware Overall value for money if you are drinkers is marginal
Fantastic food and customer service,"This is the second time my husband and I have dined at Butcher Boy, and we also ate at Bao Boy previously, and we love this restaurant group. They are friendly and warm, quick to reply to email inquiries and the excellent service continues in person at the restaurants. We dined here shortly before the new measure shut them down temporarily, and were kindly allowed to order from the a la carte menu even though it was Restaurant Week, both the hostess and our server were kind and attentive throughout the evening, and when we left the hostess thanked us for continuing to support them in the current situation, which made us feel very happy.

And the food continues to be excellent! We tried several new items this time and all of them were fantastic...the edamame hummus and burrata was light and refreshing, both the soft shell crab and scallops were full of flavour and well balanced, the peking pork bao tender and the sweet sauce went perfectly with all of the other ingredients, and I particularly loved the new duck katsu sandwich which was so delicious! And the s' mores dessert was an indulgent and satisfying end to a delicious meal, and very generously portioned.

They also continue to offer takeaway and delivery during the lockdown and I would urge anyone who can to place and order and support this fantastic group!"
"Smart and Responsive Business,","Smart and Responsive Business, Delicious!

Amazing response to the current global situation. Many people choosing to or needing to stay home for reasons of social responsibility and unable to get regular food deliveries.

This restaurant has been fast to provide an amazing home delivery service. Absolute bargain, easy to order and delivered on time. Even to Sentosa!

The roast dinners were fantastic. A restaurant experience in the comfort of your own home.
Please support this business as they diversify through tricky times. I really hope more business do this and this will also provide more opportunities for taxi drivers etc to work during this period too. Can’t wait to visit the actual restaurant."
Had my amazing birthday dinner here!,Had my amazing birthday dinner here at Butcher Boy. It was my second time here and I’m becoming a fan of their food and their interesting cocktails - try the creme de la creme! My husband and I really like sitting by the bar in most restaurants and it was no different here. We had the pleasure of having Mus entertain us throughout our dinner. He’s friendly and you can tell he’s very passionate about what he is doing. I really recommend this restaurant!
Good place for dinner and drinks,A small casual restaurant for drinks and dinner. We tried a few cocktails which were good & refreshing. We like the small details that added to the experience of the drinks. The food are more like fusion and quite tasty. The portions are not big so we could try more variety. The overall experience is good and can go again.
A dinner at one of the happening places in Keong Siak,Went to Cure previously and loved the food. Thought Butcher Boy would not be too far off. The baos were fabulous ! The striploin was good on its own. Pity about the two sauces - felt it did not complement the meats well enough.
Very enjoyable meal with steak & lamb to die for!!!!,"This was a restaurant that we had been looking forward to going to for a while. Went with some friends mid-week and had booked a table (to be on the safe side) but was no need as it was not full when we arrived. Restaurant is cosy and inviting, we arrived and had a drink at the bar before sitting down at the table. The menu is simple with a good choice of starters, mains, desserts and sides! It’s very much an “order and share” restaurant - meant that we were all able to try a number of different items off the menu. We ordered Aubergine, scallops and beef carpaccio to start, followed by Black Angus StripLoin and Welsh Lamb Rump. And wow wow wow!! The food was well presented and delicious but the striploin and lamb were stunning. Unbelievably tasty. Right up there with any steak and lamb that I have every eaten. It was awesome! Washed the food down with a couple bottles of wine which were very smooth. However with the cheapest bottle of wine costing $120 it was pretty punchy. The staff were very friendly and professional, the ambiance of the restaurant relaxed and easy!! All in the bill came to $680 (between 4) so it is fairly pricey but was totally worth it and was a thoroughly enjoyable meal. We shall certainly go back again."
Amazing. Worth the trip!,"This restaurant finds the sweat spot of quality and value. Chef Andrew Walsh ups the ante on relaxed high end fare in Singapore. The salmon nachos, the pastrami, the pork bao; literally everything was amazing. Service was relaxed and efficient. By the way, go to CURE next door and you will be equally impressed with their upscale take on fusion cuisine."
Wonderful Girls Night Out!,Was there about a month ago with my girlfriends. Great food and cocktails concocted by the bartender were excellent. Never tasted anything like it before. Visited again with my colleagues few weeks after. They were very impressed by the desserts and side dishes and cocktails. Staff were very polite and welcoming especially Stanley.
Amazing Sunday roast!,"As a Brit expat, I’m always looking for a tasty Sunday roast. I tried this place with my friends last weekend and was delighted with the food! It may seem a bit on the pricey side at first but it was totally worth it as the quality of the meat was amazing. The sides were great too and the Yorshires are nice and big! Draught beer and house wines are reasonably priced."
MUST VISIT!,"I was recommended by my good friend to try Butcherboy restaurant when visiting Singapore. It was loud but i assume it's their personal style. I was seated at the bar for an aperitif before head down to dining. Mike the Bar Manager made me a cocktail using sloe gin, which was my favorite. Food was delicious, service was great. What's amazing when we were given a shot of sake by the Operations Manager, Ridzwan for digestive purposes. How thoughtful of that which NEVER I've experience this A-Star service. Thank you so much for spoiling me on my birthday. Will you again soon."
Thank You Butcher Boy!,"A great place for a great cocktail, excellent food and good selection of wines to compliment them. Visited with my mom & dad for their 30 years wedding anniversary. The vibe of the restaurant make us very relax plus an exceptional service from Riduan makes us more comfortable. Professionalism i will describe the young man and not a surprise he is the Operations Manager. Chinese baos were mouth-watering, steaks delicious and juicy. Another staff named Hau, if I got his name correctly was very attentive and so detail till a small drop of sauce were wipe off. My family were blown away when received a cake with candle and Anniversary shots from Bar Manager Mike mellows done our filled tummy which not a bad thing, thanks. Thank you Butcher Boy for this wonderful experience and full on throttle on recommending this restaurant which is located in Chinatown area."
What to expect here ?,"My second visit at Butcher Boy ! Celebrating friend's birthday this time, we had some cocktails to start No.47 & Cymbo are soooo good ...... thanks to Mike & Noor!
Never skip the BAOS!! The bao here are amazing, especially Pork Jowl Bao, tender, juicy, fluffy, tasty & yummy! Manager Wan recommended to try their special Nasi Lemak Bao, i like the spiciness and coconut sambal are the best, just missing the anchovies & peanuts. Beef short rib are super tender, it literally melt in my mouth. Brussel sprouts never taste so good before, Lin even managed to get me the recipe from the chef. Very friendly & attentive service even though busy Friday night. We will be back for sure!"
Great Value for Money - Sunday Roast!,"I have personally visited this place twice before leaving this comment on TripAdvisor, and both the times it was an enjoyable experience. I love their selection for Sunday Roast with Chicken, lamb, yorkshire pudding, carrot miso mash are some of my favourites."
Disappointing...,"Probably epitomised in the fact that their “pigs” in blankets were, in fact, “chickens” in blankets of a poor, processed quality. Ambiguous portion sizes with few sharing plates brought out for their Christmas Roast. They completely forgot the miso mash. Roast potatoes were quite nice, and the Yorkshire’s too, but my roast beef was fatty and lacking in flavour. Would not recommend."
Christnas gathering,"We initially booked the visit to have the christmas dinner set, but i had booked without knowing the christmas dinner finished at 4pm and i had booked for a 7pm time.
We was told we could order ala cart from regular menu.
The food was ok but nothing special and price of drinks was at the very higher end, There was 7 of us and the total bill was around $220 per head and we never had loads of food and drink.
We would have got much better value at brunch in terms of quality and quantity of food.
Cant fault the staff as they was very helpful and nearby if we had any questions"
“ Great staff-great menu”,"What a beautiful dinning room and set up. Finally some good lighting in Singapore. Not to bright not to dark just stylish.

Extremely professional bartender, chefs and staff. Very happy and knowledgeable. Was only in for a small bite as I was doing a four restaurant tour this evening and didn’t want to burst at the seems. Amazing cocktails and the food I did try was spot on.

Met the chef on the street with his chef-de cuisine in front of his other restaurant just down the way. Super friendly in helping point out other great places to go in the area and just an all around nice guy.

I’ll be back soon and looking forward to doing a full tasting experience! The friend I was with had been there many times and had said I chose well it was one of his favorite spots.

Thanks again. See you soon."
Wonderful Anniversary Experience,"To Wan(The Manager) and your Team, me and my wife had a wonderful experience at Butcher Boy earlier today to celebrate our Anniversary. Nice food, amazing cocktails and wonderful friendly staff! KEEP UP THE GOOD VIBE!🙏"
Great trendy spot for dinner and drinks.,"Recommend on atmosphere, drinks and food. The staff were very friendly. Covers all the bases. Worth a visit. I’ll be back."
"The food was good, especially","The food was good, especially the pork bao and the Brussels sprouts (no really, I normally don’t even like them). The staff were friendly. However at this price level I expect good food and friendly staff. There are better places close by (eg Neon Pigeon) with more original food, more engaging staff and less noise (Butcher Boy was so noisy we struggled to have table conversations). It’s a cool trendy area and Butcher Boy would need to add originality for me to consider another visit"
Good experience. While I,Good experience. While I enjoy the Sunday roasts this is also a place to come mid week for the menu. The food is good for sharing and there are some good drinks also.
Too noisy and too cold!,Dumb down the wall Acoustics with smth as the sound bounces off the walls too much and could not here the person across from me.
Disappointing,"Food all comes at once, tiny table! Felt rushed n hurried despite requests to slow down. Disappointing starters, main courses were ok"
Superb Sunday Roast,Having eaten at Butcher Boy a few times we decided to try the Sunday Roast. Best roast I have had in Singapore. Chicken was so well cooked and delicious. Brussels sprouts were sooooo good. Even if you are not a fan of Brussel’s try them. You won’t be disappointed. Roast potato’s crispy on the out side and fluffy in the middle. Gravy out of this world good. We will definitely be back.
Birthday Celebration,I was at butcher boy on my birthday and I have to say I had an amazing night. I was greeted with warm hospitality by the bartender Noor who also made delicious cocktails. Food was great as chef Erik came out to have a chat and check on us with what we had ordered. The restaurant ambiance was also nice. It was also nice for the Ridzwan the Ops manager to touch the table. I would definitely go back again.
Casual delicious,"First time at Butcher Boy and I loved it. We tried several sharing dishes and they were all very tasty and good. We especially loved the asparagus and short ribs; amazing.
The place combines a nice, casual laid back atmosphere with great food. Will definitely be back."
Loved it. Thank you Dwayne for looking after me.,"Super find in Chinatown. Friendly and efficient service. I loved sitting at the bar by myself. Dwayne looked after me. Chef Andrew was present and speaking with guests. I love that !
The sharing style works well. My choices were outstanding. The flavours were on point. Would have no hesitation in returning and I also hear there sister restaurant Cure is outstanding too. Thank you again for looking after me."
Great ambience,"Great place with lots of character, the owner came and gave special recommendation on wine to suit our meal, and it was a perfect match. Will definitely be visiting again."
Jaws chewing in symphony no. Yummeh!,"Butcher boy has been an absolute local favorite...local as in Keong Saik Rd! Where only the special homeys participate. Its yes...homey, absolutely tasty and nothing can beat the service that brings you only warmth and smiles. My spot at Butcher Boy guarantees a smile on my overworked face, thanks to special people like Dwayne. The drinks are delicious and food will make your jaws chew in symphony n smiles.Simple and unpretentious, yummy and delectable, skip all of Singapore's pretentious side, to enjoy delectable good food, amazing personalities in a street that sums up a colonial past.Yummeh! It is that good!"
"Really good food, service needs improvement especially with the prices you pay","Atmosphere and food was really great, and to satiate that craving, I would go back. The bill was about $100 per head with drinks.

They made two mistakes on the bill and overcharged (good thing we spotted it). They adjusted it but didn't even apologize and just dunked the bill on our table. I get that they are busy but when you spend hundreds of dollars at a place, you expect a pleasant attitude.

Overall, it felt a bit more ""casual"" and ""cold"" on the service side. Not that we need pampering, but there is a certain minimum threshold that's expected."
Sunday Brunch,Good value although the amount of meat served is a bit small. Nonetheless the sides are delicious and can be replenished at no extra cost. Roast beef and pork belly were yum.
Try the bao!,"I’ve been to a butcher boy a few times now and really enjoy it but this time I felt it was a bit flat. We ordered peking bao, whipped burrata, pardon peppers, scallops and black cauliflower. The bao and the peppers were great but the whipped burrata was disappointing, it was mostly a tomato salad with a tiny bit of burrata. The cauliflower was interesting but I wouldn’t order it again. The peppers were great and nicely charred and the scallops were really well cooked and with a nice salad and dressing. I think if you go to butcher boy order the meats, the bao and the dumpling this time we deviated and it didn’t pay off and we left slightly flat and slightly hungry! It might have been an off night and as I said we didn’t stray from the norm with our orders!"
A bit too salty for my liking,"My first visit to Butcher Boy for lunch earlier in the month. Opted for a selection of food which was all quite tasty, but a little salty for my liking. Service was friendly and it wasn't busy at lunchtime on a weekday so no reservation was needed."
Amazing food and service,"Had dinner at butcher boy a few times, always impressed with the food and loveeee making my way through the sake list ;)"
Wonderful dining experience!,"We very much enjoyed dinner at Butcher boy just over a week ago. The staff were very attentive and knew the menu very well. We ordered some items based on their recommendations and we were not disappointed. The restaurant was full and the atmosphere lively on the night we were there which was a Tuesday night.
Will definitely be back for the food and service soon again!"
Insanely good fried chicken bao,"Nothing too special about the restaurant itself, the service (friendly if a tad distant) or the wine list (blah, with inexplicably only small bottles of sake, which is really a poor choice) but the fried chicken bao is simply insane - crunchy, soft, salty and simply delicious. You'll order 3, then another round and by your next order realise you've succumbed to the food equivalent of Ulysses' Sirens. It's simply a mouth-watering must have. Sort your wine list though and get some adult-size bottles of sake..."
Love!,"Have been to Butcher Boy on a few occasions now and I have yet to have a bad meal. The bao are gorgeous, the duck one especially. They did a beetroot salad a few months ago which was delicious but all the food is good, you can't really go wrong. I haven't had a dessert yet as i don't really have a sweet tooth instead i opted for their version of an Espresoo Martini and was not disappointed! Yum."
