Great meal Great view,"While some restaurants rely on their location this restaurant provided us with a great dining experience.
We had the Smoked Duck, a yummy Prawn dish and an exellent fried rice.
All were excellent.
Service was 1st class.
Visit at night as the view is stunning.
We will be back !"
Disappointed,"Was really looking forward to having chilli
crab here. Have to say it was a disappointing meal. First they made us wait 15 minutes past our reservation time which is annoying. The service was erratic. Hard to get service, hard to get our order in. The food came out very slow at times. The food was very good though when we did get it. The worst was we never even got one of our dishes and no one noticed until we asked what happened to it. They did adjust our bill. It was a very expensive meal for what we got. It’s really a tourist trap of a place I’m afraid."
Great location nice food,"Traditional Singaporean experience with a menu based on chili crab. A bit of a tourist venue, but good quality and stunning view/atmosphere over Marina Bay."
Amazing and Patient Service,"We came to dine in the afternoon with friends. We ordered the set menu and the food was fantastic. We could not finish our food. The staff were very patient around us and told us at 3.30pm that they closed at 3pm and the kitchen staff had prepare our desserts before going for their break. Most places would inform you to get out by 3pm!

The most exceptional staff was Alex. We wanted to leave a tip via Credit Card but we were informed that the tips charged via Credit Card do not go to the staff which is upsetting as Alex does deserve a well deserved tip."
Great service,"Have been here many times, and felt all the visit was great.

Had a great seat outside is the new (to me) seating arrangement, which seemed improved thanks to the manager Wing Chen

Food , ie chilli & paper crabs, were excellent.

Service very perfect and Wing chen always know our needs and prepared and introducing to us . Will introduce to my friends and relatives to come for meal and their special event .
Once again thanks Wing"
good quality,"Really nice restaurant, good and fresh fish, service has to improve but local dishes are fantastic, everything over the bay's view. Waitress lost my order, I waited for an hour but, I can suggest it!"
You should eat!,Very good food! Traditional kuzine of Singapore ! Do try the signature dishes! They are amazing! Nice location! Kind staff!
Long Lasting Impression Dinner with family - Special thanks to staff called WING,"We visited Palm Beach again after a long time prepandemic time. Favourite dishes still taste consistently FANtastic. We ordered Beef Skewers, signature chili crab, and many others. The Beef Skewers are always the highlight of our dinner there, it is just wow. I just learnt this beef skewers, is actually award winning..

for the signature chili crab, it is beautiful and taste good.
there are two types of mantou you can order separately, Steam and Fried
make sure you specify which one you want, Both are good
use this mantou(s) plural...to scoop up all the chilli goodness of that gravy..

Special shout out to a staff by the name Wing, she helped us patiently and made sure everything we needed was there, super attentive and highly courteous with beautiful smile. Management, congratulations and you should be super proud having a great asset like Wing in your team.

See you guys at Palm Beach again soon.

my booking name was Ivan - dined on Friday 8th of July for 7 people"
Expensive but worth the experience and delicious!,"When in Singapore, you are supposed to do the Chile Crab. I would recommend getting it here. Their recipe is excellent and not as spicy as other restaurants. Another reviewer recommended the Almond shrimp and am so grateful I ordered it. It was out of this world amazing. (And you can ask for the shrimp to be peeled so you just enjoy and eat). They cut up the Chile Crab so it is easier to peel. They also wrap you in a bib. As a native New Orleans gal, I'm not scare of peeling crab. I thought the bowl on the table was wet wipes for when we were done. It was actually gloves so you didn't dirty your hands. (We didn't learn this until after we ate and went to clean our hands more fully than the bowl of water on the table by your plate)."
More than just seafood,"This was my first time at Palm Beach Restaurant. We did not order any crabs, but all the food that we ordered were good.

The smoked duck was a bit dry, but everybody enjoyed the crackers that came with it, and the balachan sauce.

The toufu was very soft and tasty, and the kangkong cooked perfectly. Delicious but not oily, and not too spicy.

The seafood vermicilli was nicely done as well, tasty with a tad of spice.

Awful service with so so food,"I decided to bring my family to Palm Beach during their holiday in Singapore rather than our usual place to give it a try. At first, I request a table with a nice view of Marina Bay and was just bluntly rejected and said no more available seats. When we arrived for our reservations, there were a lot of seats outdoors that were given to walk-in guests. We were not escorted to our table and we waited for 15 minutes and nobody gave us the menu. We were waiting there for nothing until I got frustrated and asked for a menu myself. For a party of 6, we were given one menu to share with ourselves. When I was ordering our food, the server who took our order was very pushy in terms of upselling the size of the food items I was ordering. She said that a small portion will not be enough for our group which ended up us not being able to finish the food that we ordered. When I was ordering a glass of water for the entire table she said your restaurant only serves still water which I am fine. When we asked for a refill, the other server said is regular water fine? I was shocked. And the server mentioned that 1.4 kg crab is only available that evening just to hear that other tables were offered smaller ones..

For a restaurant that charges a premium, the experience was not worth remembering. Service should be improved! Diners would expect better service from a place that charges a premium price. I would definitely suggest going to other places that will get your money's worth."
Great Food but extremely poor service that ruined my experience,"I have been to this restaurant many times up to last year. Given the past pleasant experience, this year is my 1st time coming with a foreign guest. However, this time my experience is very very bad. The food is good but the service is very disappointing.

1) My orders came almost at one go, despite my table was totally full. Hence the dishes were placed in a way that was very messy.

2) The cocktails ordered right at the start before meal was so late into the middle of the dinner. It was a 40mins wait and that’s after I have ask for the drinks several times.

3) As we had ordered prawns, naturally we had shells that pile up on our plates that we could hardly eat on it. I have to ask for the service staff to change to new ones and I have to repeat the request many times before the plate is changed.

4) We have also ordered hot chrysanthemum tea. However our tea was not refilled even when it was empty. Again I had to request many time for it to be refilled.

The staff was not even paying attention to the tables. Not only I am disappointed with the service, I am also very embarrass in-front of my foreign guest especially after I sang high praises of your establishment prior to this dinner."
Good food in a great surroundings,"Located by the waters of vibrant Marina Bay, this restaurant serves great seafood.

Went there as a family to celebrate a birthday.

Food was above average. The best dishes for me was the cold seafood platter and the steamed fish. The fried durian with coconut ice cream for dessert was unique.

The asparagus with scallops was good but the addition of fish floss was for me a bit counter to my taste buds.

The other mmmm dish was the Lobster Laksa. The broth was a bit disappointing but the redeeming factor was the very tasty chunks of Lobster pieces.

Overall, a very pleasant dining experience with great company."
Fantastic food ruined by awful service,"I don't know what sort of training the staff receive at this place, but they have clearly overlooked the basics of good hospitality and service. The staff just do not have a clue. Don't know what our waitress's name was as she was one of four different people that made a complete hash of serving us.
My wife and I ate here tonight (Saturday 16th May 2022) and were shown to a table for two where we firstly ordered drinks: A beer, a dry martini and two glasses of San Pellegrino water. I asked for ice for the water. It was not brought to the table. I had to ask a further three times before ice arrived. By then, our two waters were luke warm. By the time the dry martini arrived the ice in it had melted and it of course was therefore watery.
We ordered the clam starter and some garlic prawns. My starter was served but my wife's starter arrived a good 15 minutes later long after I had eaten my starter. Why were the two starters not prep\red together and served together.
Then the chilli crab was served, but the noodles and rice we had ordered to accompany the crab only arrived AFTER we had eaten the crab. The crab was a huge disappointment. It was supposed to be a large 1.2kg crab for two to share which we were charged S$129 for, but when I lifted the shell off it, there was absolutely nothing inside. We just had the two claws and some skinny legs with little meat in them. Where was our 'brown' meat from under the shell? I am used to fresh crabs from Cromer in Norfolk in the UK, and when you pay for a Cromer crab you get all the brown meat, dressed and ready to eat, plus the claw meat. There is NO WAY that our crab weighed anywhere near 1.2 kg. What a total rip-off that was.
It tasted fabulous, but really come on..... you are having a laugh if you call that 1.2 kg!
There was no attempt made to clean the debris off the table before the waitress asked us if we wanted desserts, so I cleaned the rice and other food debris away myself with a napkin.
Again, my wife's dessert was served to her before mine arrived and so she had finished it before I even started. They also took her empty dessert glass away before I had even started eating mine. At what point were the staff trained to always serve each course to the dines together at the same time? Like I said - they do not even know the basics of good waiting service.
When I complained, I got a beer and the water taken off the bill. When I asked for the 10% service charge to be removed (as we had not received any service), the waitress just shrugged her shoulders.
All in all, very tasty food, but very very expensive for what you get, (over S$400 for a meal for two including just one bottle of wine that would sell in the UK for about £6.50 and which Palm Beach charged us S$85 for). The good food was spoiled by terrible service from staff with a very poor attitude. The owners need to stop trading on what used to be, and wake up to the fact that customer service is what really makes a meal great today. The staff need some radical re-training in the basics, before this place could be called one of Singapore's best restaurants.
Avoid. You would be better off eating Chilli Crab at any good Hawker Market stall or seafood restaurant."
Dinner by the river,"Excellent seafood, had the Chilli crab and Lobster! Our server - Jannice was polite and the service was really amazing!"
Good location great food,Wonderful experience. Despite our last minute booking the restaurant did their best to get us a good seat outside. Kelly our waitress was attentive and very wise in her advice on what to order. Very happy we listened to her! Will definitely return!
Good food with nice ambience,"Food:
The chilli crab and the honey tangy fish are delicious.

Location:
The ambience is great. The weather was cooling when we visited for dinner as it was raining in the afternoon. Thus, it was great to sit outside.

Staff/Service:
We came without a reservation but the staff was able to assign us a table outside as we preferred to sit outside with the cooling weather. We ordered chilli crab together with mantou, honey tangy fish and mee goreng and the trainee staff named Janice who was very attentive to us politely advised not to order any more dishes as it we would not be able to finish them. It was a good advise as we were not sure of the serving portions.

Overall, good food, nice ambience and great service."
Overpriced & Dry prawns,"Overpriced, ordinary food & indifferent service. The prawn dish was overcooked & dry & the fish dish was supposed to be hot but arrived cold."
Great food with great view,"Been there a couple of times and it’s my first time writing this review for this restaurant. Great food with great view and ambience. Served by a very friendly Stella and the entire dining experience was great.
PS. If you order Chilli Crab, top it off with mantou. Yumz!"
"Great food, good service and atmosphere","We have a really, nice lunch here after a fun morning on the beach. Although it's a seafood restaurant, there are plenty of choices for those of us to don't like fish. Yay! My guests had the mahi mahi sandwich, and broiled salmon, I had a really delicious ham and cheese on pumpernickel, and the kids had chicken nuggets and grilled cheese. The wait staff was great and the beachy vibe was fun. There's also an indoor/outdoor bar which looked fun.

Good for families, good for couples, even good for a large group (there was a party of 13 sitting near us."
Good seafood restaurant,"Chilli crab, bamboo clam with vermicelli were delicious. Lunch no crowd but seated inside the restaurant as the outdoor not open during lunch. Chairs inside the restaurant were too high, requested to change snd they obliged to. Thanks to Stella and team"
Walked out,Service was dire. No menu no water. Staff clueless Ordered a cabernet sauvignon it had ice on bottle. Their answer was to warm it? At that point I left. Very expensive weird menu. Don't bother
Overall pretty mediocre,"To summarize: Their chrysanthemum tea tasted like water. Their chilli crab was towards the sweet side with the meat kinda stuck to the shell. So it was pretty difficult to eat. Other dishes were alright.

The most shocking was I bought a slice cake from elsewhere and told them to help me refrigerate it. They assumed it was someone’s birthday, and brought it out with candles and decoration on the plate without asking me. I had no choice but to just celebrate to prevent any awkwardness."
"Great view, average food that is overpriced.","Apart from the lobster sashimi, the rest of the food we ordered (Chilli Crab, signature noodles, asparagus) was just average. Chilli crab lacks a punch, signature noodles were too peppery and asparagus too salty. Service was mediocre. View is great but just not worth the value that we paid for."
Palm Beach Seafood - Social Distancing Version,"My wife and another couple recently decided to spend the evening around One Fullerton and landed on seafood. After reading a few reviews, we decided seafood and al fresco was the plan with Palm Beach. We were not going to the restaurant for the tourist trap chili crabs or Australian lobster but rather the award winning honey tangy fish.
We started off with one order of the steamed live Scottish bamboo clam. Absolutely delicious! Then we added a round of the Australian beef skewers (skewers were lemongrass stalks). The meat melted in our mouths leaving us desiring more but knew the main courses were on their way.
Next, my wife ordered two of the honey tangy fish ($14/ea) while I ordered the large Golden Almond Prawn ($40) ... requested the chef to peel shrimp before preparing to avoid that activity. We split those dishes easily between us two. Both dishes lived up to hype - fish fried to perfection with the honey spice on top ... yummy. The shrimp was too fried perfectly (crunchy on outside but moist on the inside).
Unfortunately the restaurant was out of asparagus so we substituted broccoli for the asparagus and scallop dish. Would have been better if asparagus—but we needed some greens. The table also split an order of Kailan Dual Style which was again average but went well with the stars — fish and prawns. Our mates had the steamed and bbq fish which they both enjoyed.
We enjoyed a bottle of the house red as it was a special of the evening — good for the dinner.
So the view was spectacular, service was attentive, and food was excellent. All in — $170/couple. Palm Beach will continue to be a part of our restaurant rotation. Thanks for a great evening."
Anniversary Dinner,"Fabulous food and fabulous service! We had the Australian lobster special - two ways, and, they did not disappoint!
Both the Coco lobo and the creamy lobster - absolutely fabulous!
A must try for anyone in Singapore.
The friendly staff will even help you with a take away and give you specific instructions.
Definitely worth a come back !!! Thank you to the staff in making our 16th wedding Anniversary even more special.
Hope to see you again really soon."
Celebrated our anniversary,Celebrated our anniversary here. Enjoyed the lobsters so much! The Coco Lobo was amazing. And all thanks to Pier & Janice for their wonderful service. Thank you.
Fantastic food and service !,"Went as a family to palm beach at one Fullerton yesterday for dinner . Had 2 young kids in tow (5 and 2) . The service was excellent, the food was fresh and exceptional and the scenery fantastic. Janice ( waitress ) was very attentive . She even helped us to de-shell our lobster as I was busy attending to the kids ! Never had a service staff offer that before ( and I have been to alot of seafood restaurants). Will definitely visit again ."
"Good Food, Good Service (Kids Friendly), Good Location",Chilli crab was good. Steam barramundi with tofu (for our two toddlers) was very fresh and the kids loved it. Service staff was very attentive and accomodating.
Delicious!,"Wonderful view of the MBS, the Chilli Crab is a perfect combo of sweet and spicy, and the Man Tao (bread) is delightful. The service is top notch, they will literally cut your crab for you. Would recommend!"
Great Service,"Dinner at Palm Beach Seafood Restaurant was delightful. We received excellent service from Amanda & Katrina. They went above and beyond when I asked too late after ordering to not have the shells on the shrimp, they removed them for us at the table. The food was delicious and the patio had a wonderful view of the Marina."
Delicious lunch,"I had the creamy crab and golden milk prawns, and both were very delicious. The staff called Kelly was also very kind and helpful and removed the crab meat for me, which was really appreciated. Janice was also really kind. I would highly recommend for people to visit here."
Unexpected dinner,"It was an unplanned dinner here at Palm Beach. We were visiting the Merlion and walked past this restaurant. Despite searching online and seeing the bad reviews, we decided to try having dinner. The staff here were very nice and welcoming. Our waitress suggested on how and what to order for our dinner. It was very good suggestion as the food was delicious. We would like to thank our waitress Amanda and Katina for the lovely dinner and evening."
Oh. My. Goodness. Amazing,"Oh. My. Goodness.
Amazing meal, gracious service. Reputedly the “original” chili crab. I have no research, but I will say, if they weren’t the first, they have PERFECTED it!! They even helped me shell my crab!!
Sad note that it’s a Saturday afternoon and almost empty. Dang virus. But rest assured, the food is not suffering!!
Already plotting my next visit to Singapore and Palm Beach is now a “must visit” on my list!!!"
Simply awful. Avoid,"We ate here on our first night in Singapore. From the other reviews on here, it seemed fine (if not great) and it was close to our hotel.

I can only liken the experience to low-grade restaurants in Spain or Istanbul who survive on passing tourist trade. The young staff, whilst courteous, couldn't care less about their clients' dining experience and were not afraid to hide it. A tout will sit you down quick, want you to order quick from their food-stained menu, pay quick and that's will be the transaction. Definitely not a place to linger or enjoy oneself.

The food itself is passable, but one can do much better by walking five minutes up the river to Clarke Quay. If I were a Singaporean friend giving you advice on where to go instead, I'd recommend somewhere like Violet Oon which we very much enjoyed on another evening. You'll pay less, the food is orders of magnitude better and the experience is much less rushed and pleasurable."
Great cooking with must try Chilli Crab,An informal and convivial restaurant on the Bay. Wonderful variety of food very well prepared and presented. Most helpful staff
Not a pleasant dining experience,"I am being kind to rate this restaurant average. We had heard great things about the black pepper crab and were really excited to get to eat it here. Boy, were we in for disappointment, service was poor to nonexistent, waited 30 minutes before someone showed up to take drink orders, when they finally arrived our drinks were watered down and thankfully no one ever showed up to ask if we’d like another. After another long wait we were finally able to order and after another long wait, the crab finally arrived. The sauce was sweet with no hint of pepper and extremely messy. Not what I was hoping for by a long margin. After we finished no one would bring our check or take the dishes away. After all this the bill was $230 US for one crab and two watered down drinks! Definitely will NOT be back!"
Amazing food and environment,We had a great meal. Janice & XinYin we’re terrific You must eat here when in Singapore We will most definitely come again Food and service was Great
Valentine's Day Dinner,"We order a whole crab cookled in salted egg-yolk sauce, the starter platter for 2 and a plate of sea-food flat rice noodles. The food was delicous and the restaurant really acceded to our request of a table with a nice view on Valentine's day.

A big shout out to our head waitress Stella Wong. Thank you for being a very attentive waitress and also letting us know that we have not over-ordered."
So delicious and fun we ate there two nights in a row!,"We were at the end of our five week tour of Southeast Asia touring Singapore, and our female guide who was born there highly recommended we eat at Palm Beach. When we arrived there, the manager, Angela, easily figured out we were Westerners and really helped us choose from the menu, ensuring me that my dietary restrictions would be honored and taken care of. The dinner was absolutely epicurean, with the best noodle dishes we've ever had anywhere (including 5 other Asian countries). We were so in love with the food we tried to reserve a table for the next evening, but they were completely booked, so Angela offered us carryout that would be waiting for us the next night. When I arrived the carryout was not quite ready, so she kindly offered me a chair to sit on, a glass of cold water, and something to munch on. We have been back from our trip for three weeks now, and are still talking about the food there. Oh, and the view of the harbor from their outdoor seating is absolutely breathtaking - laser shows and all! Thanks, Angela, for two meals of a lifetime!
Dr. Bruce"
Mr,"Janice was incredible, will be back again! Cant wait to see the Red Sox win the World Series Janice was incredible"
Delicious Chilli Crab,"My husband and I had previously dined at the restaurant in December 2016 (see my review dated 19 January 2017).

During our second trip to Singapore, we had a return visit to see if it had retained the qualities which made for a memorable first meal.

We were seated at a good outside table, which afforded a great view of the Marina Bay Sands and the light show.

The extensive menu was impressive. The Palm Beach Signature Chilli Crab was especially delicious, with a very tasty, well-seasoned sauce.

We were served by Pier Pan, the assistant manager. He was very professional and extremely helpful - his assistance was invaluable with getting the most out of the Chilli Crab.

We would highly recommend dining at Palm Beach Seafood Restaurant for a taste of Singapore."
Fabulous,"Amazing dining experience. Fun time Cracking crab shell and carving the crabmeat out of the claws. Jasper was so helpful. Dianne was entertainingly honest in suggestions and recommendations. Highly recommend for the food, views, and overall experience."
Not worth the high price,"The restaurant was recommended by our concierge as a higher end restaurant and easier locale than the restaurants on the East Coast. $160 (Singapore) for the chili crab. We expected to pay a bit more but I also expected to eat some crab. The sauce was tasty but very little meat in the crab. One of the claws was empty with a hole in the side. My husband shared the meat he got out of his claw. The kangkong and noodle dish we ordered as sides were fine although we had much better food at other places in Singapore. Service was poor. There was a confusion in our drink order. After I had started to drink what I soon discovered wasn’t what I had ordered, the waiter took it and served it to someone two tables down. I would not recommend this place."
Don’t bother - lots of other better places to eat,We tried this as we were passing and really wish we hadn’t bothered. Whilst the staff were very nice we were very disappointed with our meal. The chilli crab was not as tasty as it should have been and it definitely wasn’t value for money. The cost of our meal was extortionate in comparison to other excellent places we have eaten whilst we have been in Singapore over the last few years and we won’t be returning to this restaurant. To add insult to injury the restaurant don’t provide napkins on the table but do put a wet serviette at each place - they don’t tell you but if you use this they then charge you for it! Day light robbery.
Everything excellent!,"my husband and I were just walking to Merlion Park yesterday. and we saw a dish placed on a table. we were amazed and asked what it was. we get a table right away to taste it. and gave us the table outside where the view was beautiful. Shout out to the service lady in blue uniform who helped us with what was good. I forgot what the full name was but she is so helpful even on how to eat the crab. By the way, I just saw Kat on her nametag and didnt saw the fullname was. Thank you so much for giving us the best dish and your very good service. we will definitley comeback and hope you are the one who will serve us again."
not recommend,"Nice sauce, Nice view, Awful crab So you just buy chili sauce and make it at home. Plastic globe is free"
Food is delicious and the view is excellent !!,"The palm beach is inside the Merlin park,so we can enjoy the fabulous harbor view when eating. Over all, the experience in the Palm beach is excellent!"
Enjoyable night,"arrived early 15mins before appointed time, it really started raining and there were lots of tourist at the shades, music start coming in from esplanade but overall, the food was great but somehow the tables were alittle bit too close to each other, leaving little rooms for the waiters to squeeze by."
Good Restaurant with view of Marina Bay,"I was there unfortunately not to eat Crab, and we were celebrating 20 years anniversary. I ordered normal stuff like tofu, kangkong, noodle, which unfortunately so-so. The place is quite crowded though with good view to marina bay.
Due too crowded, we don't feel easy and enjoying the view. I would probably not be back again, as i know there is better place with better food."
Very good,We came in at lunch service and it was great The food is amazing and the staff were very friendly and helpful and service was fast. Will come back again.
Excellent chili crab and very friendly staff service,"We highly recommend tourist to visit here for delicious chili crab and Singapore slung, we enjoy the environment here and helpful staff."
Chili crab,"Taste of chili crab wasn’t as expected, not spicy more taste tomate. Different taste when we ate laat year"
Disappointing Holiday Dinner,"Our family of four came here for Christmas dinner on the recommendation of our concierge and we were disappointed. After being seated we waited over 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge us before my husband finally went over to ask the hostess if someone could take our order. The food was mediocre at best. The duck was dry, the crab did not taste good. The seafood rice was the best dish, it was flavorful. Our waiter did not check on us at all throughout the meal, no plates were cleared. No one asked how things were or if we needed anything else. Every time we needed something we had to flag down someone who was walking by. The meal was almost $400 and they had the audacity to add $3.20 to the tab for the wet wipes they left on the table. This is a high end restaurant? I would not recommend this place. Poor service, meh food, petty extra charges."
Good quality of everything,"Very helpful staff members, good quality of food and service, clean and nice atmosphere and nice marina walkway near by. You can visit with loved ones for nice Singaporean crab. Try here! You won't regret it."
Very good food and excellent staff service also very god,We love the beef skewer and cold platter set and Chendol dessert and we recommend this restaurant and ice cream
Worst place to host your foreign guests,"Hate writing bad reviews but this cannot escape my ranting and thought I’d share my experience.

1. Deposit $400 has not been refunded despite being assured at several points.

At point of deposit for reservation - cashier said it would be offset at billing.

At point at billing- cashier said it would be refunded through credit card in 3-4days time.

Just called- after nearly 2 months dining there over the phone “oh, it should have been deducted from your bill”

Note to self: please check and follow up.

:/

2. Delayed service despite arriving on time AND HAVING THE MENU ORDERED IN ADVANCE!

I would invite the restaurant to verify their logs.

Zero service recovery for 2 tables of hungry guests."
Great dining ambience with food,"Yesterday was there to dine with my friend. We ordered a lobster, green vegetables with tofu and a seafood fried rice .It blends the total taste with a bottle of wine wine and ended with some local deserts. Excellent service and good food palette selection."
Not worth it,Crab salad wasn’t available. crab and lobster only of big sizes. More Chinese than seafood. Disappointed. Too loud music from a nearby bar.
had upset stomach from here,I understand they have to get tables back from customers for next customers. but it was too much.. staffs look like they are angry and wouldn't stop asking are you finish ur food? or can I take ur plate. they looked like they didn't know how to smile lol. the worst was the food. If food was good I could've forgiven them but their food wasn't good either. terrible service and food.
What disappoint tastes like...,"I’ve been thinking all night how our dinner could have been so bad at this restaurant that received such high marks. Trip of a lifetime to Singapore and have been dreaming about trying Chili Crab for 6 months. Researched the best place to try this iconic dish for the first time. This restaurant got high marks on trip advisor and our hotel concierge recommended it- so a no-brainer.
We were seated outdoors and the view was wonderful- overlooking the harbor and the Riverwalk. High marks for location.
So we sit and sit and sit. Tables seated after us have ordered and received appetizers. Still we wait. Flag down a busboy to ask if we can order. We watch him talk to the lead server who then talks to someone else. They hold a conference and still we wait. Finally someone comes over and says “you want to order?” I respond affirmatively and she walks away. Several minutes later she’s back.
She looks at me, I look back - staring contest? Finally, “your order?”
I order the chili crab.
The food is brought over and dropped on table ( no one has time to talk to customers here they are too busy)
The food: chili crab is less than lukewarm. Seriously chilly crab. Maybe I didn’t understand - I thought the crab was made with chilies not served chilly.
I eat most of it because I’m spending $200 for this crab- at least my tears of disappointment added a little salty flavor to this cold crustacean.
The buns were good and the beer cold.
Service: words NEVER spoken by any staff at this restaurant: thank you, how was your dinner, enjoy your meal.
Underhanded move: they charge for the wet nap but you have to use it because they do NOT give you anything else to wipe your hands on except this. And they don’t tell you until you get the bill. This sneaky move to get one more dollar out of you was the cherry on this crap pie of an evening.
If this is your first time to eat Chili Crab, please, please go elsewhere.
Food: 1 star
Atmosphere: 4 star
Service: 0 star"
Classic dishes and excellet quality ingredients,"We went to Palm Beach during a friend's visit. The chili crab was juicy and meaty, the sauce was well seasoned but not too over powering, nor too much of MSG like other places. The price is not the cheapest in town, but the quality was unbeatable. In addition, the view of MBS was amazing during the lightshow. Highly recommended!"
beautiful crab - tasty black pepper sauce,"two of us went , had the black pepper sauce crab.
we were given all the equipment so we can fully crack open the crab and enjoy all the succulent meat!
lovely! , sauce was tasty with Man tau.
For starters we had the cold seafood platter which was very fresh and tasty.
The only slight let down I suppose was that crab was served luke warm..would have given it five stars if it was piping hot.
overall still very good - would come back again.."
Love the almond prawns!,"Celebrated friend's birthday here, the crabs are good as usual but I especially love the Almond prawns! This dish resembles Cereal Prawns with a savory note, love it so much I finished all the crumbs! The ducks was rather dry though, we didn't finish it. Service was excellent, definitely will come back again =)"
No taste of food but great view,"The restaurant was so crowded
I made a reservation but I stood there for a while.
The outdoor seats had a good atmosphere, but the red ants came up to the table.
The food is all too salty.
The restaurant was so busy that the staff's serving was a mess.
I will not visit again."
Not To My Expectation,"I brought my overseas friend to this recommended restuarant. Patricia was the 1st contact when I made my reservation. Her service is good.
After we placed our order, we were not properly service. We basically has to asked every single time when will our next dish will be served. Our crab were served without the buns that we ordered. Our order drinks were not served till we ssked. No auto filling when our tea cups were empty. Other dishes were served way before our rice is served. I thought the rice should be a ever ready dish and can be served faster than the rest. But we have to asked and the wait was a bit long. The rest of the dish starts to turn cold when our rice finally came.
Not value for money.
Location was good but I don't think I will bring my guest or friend there again."
Very good crab,We ate the chili crab with fried mantou buns. The crab was delicious and the buns were perfect for mopping up the extra sauce. We aren't much into heavy spices so this suited our tastes. We also had fried rice with salted fish. It was excellent as well.
It's Great~~좋아요~,I will make a comment for my future Korean friends. 가성비가 안죻다.. 숴비스는 죻은데 맛은 크게 뫗있댜고 몬느꼇다... 이 글은 한꾹사람만 알아뵬슈 있을겨다.
Best Chili Crab and Service,Delicious chili crab in all of Singapore inside service incredible and extremely helpful. A must go in Singapore
Excellent food for a set menu,Went to this restaurant while on a business trip and they had a set menu so all you had to select was your drink. We got to try various types of seafood and at a great price so really recommended if you are not an expert or if this is your first time around. Good service and the food was very fresh & tasty. Plus the area is very nice with a great view
Great Seafood and Service,"Dined on the Almond crusted Prawns, Seafood Fried Rice, and Black Pepper Crab, - all excellent. Accompanied by a good bottle of Australian white wine.
We were seated inside the restaurant as nothing available outside at the time we visited. Whilst the view across Marina Bay was a little limited as a result, this was more than compensated by the excellent service provided by the Wait Staff, who were attentive and helpful with menu selections. Of particular note, was Diana Hu, - who was always extremely keen to assist.
A great meal at a fine location."
Typical Singapur dinner,Excellent singapur dinner in marina bay. Janise was our waitress. We ate singapur crab and fish frice rice. We recommend it.
BEST PEPPERED CRAB!,"Amazing meal, amazing service, great view! Definitely worth a visit. Our waitress was lovely so friendly and accommodating, crab was the best I’ve had and a lovely glass of wine… whats not to love!"
Palm beach seafood,Amazing food but even better service! Our waitress Diana Ho was very sweet and informative about the menu but also about Singapore as well.
"Excellent view Average food, ok for tourists","I have been to this restaurant several times, food quality definitely dropped, chili crab and prawn dish were lack of taste, fried mantou was cold when it was served, Roast chicken was dry. Not enough dish choices offered on menu either. Disappointing food, not good value for money!"
Super food!!!,"We stopped by to have some Sri Lankan crab when visiting Singapore and were not disappointed by what we were served.
As a starter we ordered scallop which was served on a bed of ice with a dipping sauce. It was amazing. We ordered the chilli crab which tasted amazing and some asparagus and mushrooms as a side along with fried rice. All that was totally unnecessary as we could not even finish half the food.
Food tasted amazing and the service was super. We got a table outside so it was lovely.
They also have a super selection of wine to choose from"
Excellent food,"We had the signature black pepper crab and it was just perfect! Never had such tasty crab in my life, mind you their crabs are huge so make sure you do not over order. Also we were there during F1 so it was very busy but good verbs! Outdoor has nice view and music and could see the Merlion and Sands the light show etc, highly recommend’"
A Great Meal,We have been in Singapore fir only a shirt time but we have found a wonderful restaurant with authentic food.we were assisted by staff who were polite and helpful and we loved it all. Thank you
AMAZING,"Fabulous food, fabulous service. Sat outside and enjoyed the show from Marina Bay. A definite recommendation"
Birthday Dinner,"Such an amazing place, with great food and great staff! I came here during a very long layover in Singapore and it was the best meal I've ever had!"
Excellent Restaurant,A perfect place if you have guest from oversea (example: customer or bosses). You can choose a good variety of seafood as well as vegetable and red meat. Sometime that must try is Sri Lanka Chilly and Black Pepper Crab. Imagine having the crab pincer as big as your palm. Other seafood that must try are Bamboo clam and scallop cooked with with Vermicelli. Add on with deep fried spare ribs will definitely fulfill your food desire.
Fantastic chilli crab,"You have to eat chilli crab when in Singapore and this is a great place to do so as it was where the dish was invented! We loved all the dishes we shared, from the crispy baby squid to Mee Goreng and of course the crab. We were decked out in bibs and provided with all the tools to dig into the glorious tray of food that arrived at our table. The sauce is excellent – spicy but not ridiculously so, I’m not a huge fan of spicy food and loved it. Washed down with a couple of beers, fantastic. Service was good, we were in and out within an hour as we walked in without a booking on a Saturday night but didn’t feel rushed at all."
Lovely Dinner,"This was our first time at this restaurant. We heard mixed reviews on the place and decided to try it for dinner.. The staff, Amanda that served us was very patient although my english was poor. It was easy to talk to her becuase she searched words in spanish to talk to us. She recommend chilli crab (not very spicy) and sweet buns as my wife and me cannot eat spicy well. We feel they give very good service to customer. The food is very nice and give us good memory of singapore."
Brilliant,Perfect dinner. Never have eaten so much good stuff. They had to roll me out of the restaurant. Nice view on the Marina Bay Sands and the light show. Very kind and helpful service. Overall: perfect! Thank you
"Great Service, Memorable Dinner","WE write to thank your staffs especially Amanda and Vicky. We are from Melbourne, Australia and had the pleasure of dinning at your restaurant on Saturday night for dinner. The service provided was first class. The food was delicious the first time we cam two years ago so we decided to come back again and we weren't dissapointed. Two years ago we received top notch service from Amanda and this time we were also served by Amanda and another waitress, Vicky. She was a darling to peel both our crabs for us to have an easier dining experience. We will definitely come back again as their Black Pepper crab and their hospitality has won our hearts over."
Nice.dinner,"Brought a China friend and Singaporean friend.here for dinner.
The staff Jee Shien gave excellent service and the new dish he recommended was unique ~ curry prawns with brinjal.
The crabs ( salted egg yolks and black pepper ) were excellent,as usual.

Thanks for making the dinner so enjoyable. Stay blessed !

The taste is good but the service is not good,I left dinner. Because it was too much to eat. I asked for the current price of chilli club. I wanted you to tell me that there is a half size. Because it was expensive. Taste is very good.
Very Good Chili crab and Deep fried fish!,It was my first time to visit. Most of customers were travelers like me. Location was so nice! We could see a beautiful water show and Merlion very close!
Disappointing,"They used old oil for frying. Seafood is fresh but expensive, nothing to shout about. They have a nice location. That’s about it."
Great for entertaining guests,"We have been bringing our guests from overseas to Palm Beach for the good food and wonderful view of the marina bay area. We were there for the 2nd seating (dinner) and the light show from MBS was on. We ordered prawns, fish and crabs (chilli and the creamy ones) and all the food tastes good. It's a bit pricey but it's great for entertaining guests."
Dinner with Customer,"Brought a couple of customers who are first time visitors to Singapore. Was a-great place ti introduce great Singapore cuisines like Chili Crab and love the tropical fruit platter which is not only impressive in presentation but great tasting! Impressed the locals present as well.

Service was fantastic especially from manager Janice! We love the Mala chili jam that cane with the roast chicken and wanted to buy but 2 of us were given a free sample portion each to bring home!

Great location and great experience!

Carina"
Crab to die for !,"Great location with Marina Bay backdrop. Great chili crab, the house speciality. A little crowded so must book ahead."
THE WORST SERVICE,"I just went dining today. There was misunderstanding with us and one of your staff. Even though we tried to explain, staff just scrowling us and never explain. After we set the record straight, we requested service again. However she gave us a dirty look and doing slowly and reluctantly. I paid above $500 for dinner, around $45 is service charge. HELLO? DO YOU THINK IS THIS REASONABLE?!! The price that I pay is not only for food, we have a right to receive the best service, not that kind of terrible service. I will NEVER BACK TO HERE!!! TERRIBLE SERVICE, NO SERVICE!!!"
Lovely lunch with Marina Bay views,"Had lunch with my overseas friend from London. 30th july 2019.
Food was excellent ~ chicken and beef satay , Cereal Prawns recommended ( by the very knowledgeable staff Stella Xing , who gave great photography service as well ) , and of course the large creamy 1.4kg sri Lankan crab.
The regular staff were very attentive to our needs ~ they provided exceptional service, changing our plates frequently and topping up the Chinese tea. Prices are reasonable - we ate 3 dishes and the bill was $215-- the Sri Lanka Crab was huge.
One of my favorite restaurants in Singapore."
Will never recommend to my friend anymore,"Its my first time here with my family from oversea. Make a reservation at chope but when we arrive, the table has not been set. And we have to wait for them to do set up. And the restaurant is almost empty with little customer. And there were so many staff around. When we were seated, we were only given food menu and beverage menu is only given to us when we asked for it. And we order four drink and they can still miss out on our orders. The staff was so distracted while taking our order. Every staff were like so laid back. All the food is nice as all the other review mention but the service is very bad."
I loved the fried chinese bread,"As everybody says, their dish was all excellent, including the famous crab. Let me tell you what I really loved the most. Dip the fried chinese bread into the crab sauce. That was my favorite. It makes my mouth water haha"
Crab nice but abit cold,"Ordered a chilli crab, mantou and cuttlefish kangkong for 2 pax enough. Not sure is it aircon too strong the crab was not steaming hot when served. Nice gravy. Cuttlefish was fresh and got the springy taste"
Beyond expensive but very good,"Since most locals as well as experienced tourists eat out at food courts which serve unbelievably good and reasonably priced food, it is rare to visit a full-service restaurant for dinner in Singapore. However, a number of locals told us about visiting Palm Beach in order to partake of one of their signature dungeoness crab dishes. Keeping in mind is Singapore is the most expensive city in the world to live, we were still shocked that the most inexpensive bottle of wine was USD 90. We shared an appetizer of flash fried calamari that had a slightly sweet crust which served as an excellent taste to whet our appetites. We also shared a grilled filet of local fish as an additional starter. Then, we had the pepper crab which was said to be the house specialty. The mixture of the flavors in the excellently prepared crab was a taste that we had never experienced before. While it was well seasoned, it was not spicy. The sauce was unique. The wait staff selected the right size crab for sharing, and the portion served to us was just right. It should be remembered that the crab is priced by weight, and the weight is calculated in kilograms. Despite the steep prices, the restaurant was full and there was energy in the enjoyment of all of the guests. The meal for two was approximately USD 450, which was a slight shock, but with the experience."
Very delicious menu,"Palm Beach - Love the service, the ambient, the beautiful scent in restaurant, and the food! The restaurant is well located at One Fullerton Bay and facing the Marina Bay Sands. It is stunning lasers and music at water fountain , a very memorable view."
Excellent Taste,"Very nice variety with Real sea food taste, crabs with different sauces taste outstanding, friend rice is very good and the Mango in the desert is a no Miss. Great sea food dinner with very nice views on the Marina."
