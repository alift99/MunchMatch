One of the most scrumptious buffet breakfasts!!,"Upon our stay in the Royal Plaza on Beach Road Singapore, we had our breakfast at the Ginger Restaurant during our stay in November 2022 and January 2023 respectively. This was definitely one of the most scrumptious buffet breakfasts we have had in Singapore. There was a large variety of choices available- including Japanese (sushi also there too!!), western, Chinese dim-sums, noodle bar, salad, desserts, egg station, noodle station, Indian, and many more! Food quality was also really good- and we always look forward to having the buffet breakfast on our second morning of our stay. Service in general was on average- due to the large number of guests that stay in the hotel, waiting for a table outside in the queue can take a while as staff served members. The ambience of the restaurant was also acceptable and alright- but could be quite crowded in general. With the large variety of food served in the restaurant- this breakfast and hotel stay was definitely cost worthy. Hence, overall we had amazing experiences for both times in the Ginger restaurant for buffet breakfast in this hotel stay!"
Great Service!,"Went there with my co-workers for our Christmas Celebration. Ginger had a variety of food options ranging from sashimi to our local favourites! Coupled with great service from them (especially Aisha and Choon Lian!), it made our experience eating there an enjoyable one!

Will come again :)"
The best halal buffet in town,"Went to Ginger Cafe for Christmas lunch with my company colleagues. Was greeted by the staff (Aisha & Choon Lian) and they were very attentive, helpful and always came to us when we needed anything.

The food was delicious, especially the kuih lapis, prawn and shasimi.

We will definitely come back again!"
Great place,Went there for company Christmas lunch. The food variety is good. The service is speedy and friendly.
"If you are looking for Asian Cuisine, you could possibly try Ginger.","Was there with my mom for a meal gathering, and we had a wonderful time. The staffs were friendly and of course, on top of that, they were caring on that dining day. I wouldn't have forgotten the extra mile rendered by everyone there, including the chefs who shared with me, on the delights on that special day.

Be sure to make reservation earlier as the place is in demand for larger group gathering / dinner experience."
Birthday Dinner,"One of the best tasting buffet dinner I‚Äôve had albeit the lack of options for dessert and cheese platter, but everything else tasted perfect and full of flavour. Thank you especially to Andri for making out dinner even more perfect with such class service and always tending promptly to our needs. Please give him our thanks"
Please maintain the standard. Make e price more attractive please.,"Went there w my family for the buffet breakfast at $35++ per person. Very good spread for its price. The chicken soup noodles is gd, the egg station is gd. The fruits n juices are top notch. The cooked food is also gd."
Dinner at ginger,Great food and excellent service by the staff Mr Andri‚Ä¶ Nice atmosphere and affordable. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶:‚Ä¶:.:::
"Great food, helpful staffs and awesome venue for celebrations.","Place was not just beautiful on its own, there were also wide variety of food to choose from. Staffs were very good in coordinating and efficient in handling queries during our reservation. Special thanks to Joe and Henry who made our group reservation easy and enjoyable. We had a pleasant luncheon at your restaurant."
Dinner @ Ginger buffet,"Lots of variety of yummy food, must try their durian dessert!!! The staff on ground are friendly and approachable as well (:"
Great Food and Service!,"The deco of the place was amazing and the ambience was relaxing. Food was great and staff was always ready to assist :) even when taking pics, staff asked if we needed assistance. Would definitely recommend and come again!"
Birthday Lunch,"We just had our Birthday lunch with our boy, friends and relatives at Ginger, all the staffs was very friendly, The manager Joe was helpful with my pre reservations and questions, he was very experienced in his works which impressed me, Aisha & Choon Lian was awesome that help me with the cake and billing, nd what is needed, tables and pax changes etc... The staff was also serious in their works and especially Henry, he helps us in our table seatings and also carpark passes, he was very humble and willing to help in very ways, a very potential staff at Ginger ! Awesome team and I'll be glad to let all my friends and relatives knows that this is the 1st choice of a buffet place that we will be considered next time . Good job team, well done !"
Ginger Lunch Buffet,"Very good experience, many dishes werent just delicious, they were especially delicious. The spread could have been bigger while a few items were not up to standard as some dishes have set a high bar. Many of the dishes are not like normal restaurants, they have a special taste or flavor that makes them different from other restaurants. Definitely a positive experience."
"Lovely interiors, restful colours, and great food!","Ginger is highly recommended for a wide buffet spread and great quality of dishes on offer, especially local fare. Service is very efficient, and the wait staff are observant and courteous."
Good Dinner Buffet,"Gracious hosts, nice ambience, food was yummy and great hospitality by Joe & his team. Warmth and friendly service! Good place for get-together üòä"
Perfect,Amazing! Best to be at brekfast early so you can take it all in - 6am opens :) - Friendly staff and service
No vegan / vegetarian options,I was disappointed that they had no vegan or vegetarian options for breakfast except porridge. Singapore has exceptional vegan and vegetarian options and i was disappointed to find the limited offer.
Consistently Good Lunch Buffet as usual!,"It has been about a year since we last visited this cafe and so we decided to revisit it. I will not comment about the ambience and atmosphere since I have done so previously but I think it has since undergone some reno and touchups and now it seems more cosy and nicer, with more greenery, flowers on display and even the fans are decorated as flowery shape using hats!

It was a weekend and we came by here for the buffet lunch. The food spread consisted of Western, Asian, local, in particular Peranakan themed and overall they are nice.

Some of the yummy food included the seafood platter that is fresh, sushi maki, satay, BBQ chicken wings, soup of the day, Hainanese chicken rice, Hokkien mee, laksa, prata, curry chicken and pastries (in particular, the nonya kuehs) etc, just to name a few.

Some feedback is that the satay counter always have quite a queue and the chef mainly only barberque it when diner placed an order and it takes time to be grilled well. This makes it worst when some diners order 10 or more sticks. Probably the chefs can grilled them lightly initially first and then regrilled them to fasten the process or have 2 chefs to take charge, instead of one.

Also for some food, it's slightly over salty (such as the french fries, soy sauce noodles). Good to moderate the salt level.

Coffee, tea, ice cream and fresh whole/cut fruits are inclusive in the buffet too. And the good thing is that now diners can walk freely to the respective food counters to take food on their own instead of passively waiting for the food to be served during the pre-relaxed SMM for Covid19.

Service staff are friendly, helpful and efficient, i.e. clearing used plates and replacing bottles of drinking water.

It's good value for money considering the quality and quantity of food and as members, there's discounts too.

We do enjoy our dinning here as before and will surely revisit again soon.

Rude server TAHA,Celebrating my belated 26th birthday here was turned off by server Taha. His sarcasm towards my friend & I really pissed us off. The management really had to look on this matter. Please send him to proper customer service training.
Great tasting food with accommodating service,"I made a large bento order for my company recently from the restaurant. We initially had a tough time satisfying the dietary requirement of everyone, but fortunately, the restaurant was very accomodating and offered to provide customizations to what was initially available. Eventually, we managed to provide everyone in the company with a delicious and satisfying meal thanks to the restaurant. We will not hesitate to order again."
"Buffet at Ginger. Great food, great service crew.","Mr Amdri and his colleagues were expeditous in service.

Good food....especially satay, black pepper lobsters, chilli crabs, great desserts.

Highly recommended."
Dinner at Ginger Restaurant,"The buffet dinner is awesome. So nice, my hubby and kids love it. They enjoy the food. Going dinner at Ginger is because i celebrate my 15th wedding anniversary. Receive a slice of cake from the Ginger team for my anniversary. The staff was friendly especially the staff name Zarli if im not mistaken, a malay guy. He is very helpful whenever i need/ask some help.
Overall i have a great time with my family. I definitely recommend to my family and friends. I will put at my youtube video and my facebook."
Pleasant first visit to Ginger,"Had the buffet dinner on a Saturday with 2 other friends. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Especially loved the durian pengat and chendol ice cream combo.

Service was fast and excellent. Staff was attentive and very friendly. They were fast to clear our plates and replenish our water. Kudos to Joe, Andri, Ringges, Rozila and the rest of the staff!"
Great food and nice ambiance.,"The ambiance of the restaurant was calm and aesthetically pleasing. Good service rendered by Joe, Andri, Ringges, Rozila and the rest of the team which we did not managed to identify their names. The food was amazing to our palettes, the variety ranges from western, snacks cold dishes, local highlights and the part we love the most will be the homemade ice cream and durian pengat! It tastes genuinely Singapore and we will come back again next time!"
Mr. ANDRI (Execeptional service),Mr Andri also provide excellent services whenever we visit his restaurant. He remembers our preference during each visit. Keep it up the good work.

Dinner Buffet at Ginger Park Royal Beach Road.,"The food were delicious. The atmosphere is very cozy and the good thing is Halal now!! Worth the money.
All the staffs that work in the restaurant were extremely helpful, friendly and pleasant. Special thanks to Mr Andri. He is so cheeful ,each time when we had our dinner there .Very helpful to assist us and the rest of the guests there. Ginger is definitely one of our Favourite dinning with family and friends. Will never regret coming here for sure!"
Feedback,food is ok. but the crab was not really fresh as the flesh is stuck to the shell. food were served cold. ambience is good but I believe that the taste and variety of the food can be better.
Not worth a visit!,"A very unfriendly staff and no hospitality in this place. Super expensive for very small dishes. It's a no go place .
6 pieces of small sushi for almost 50‚Ç™.
We were super unsatisfied for the overall experience ( a soup for 50‚Ç™ that was served in a small bowl)
All and all bad. Never to go back here."
Good services,"The staff are friendly and polite. The food was awesome especially the chilli crab. The counter staff, Lisa, even went an extra mile to ask if I drive so that I could redeem complimentary car park. It was a nice experience on the whole and I would recommend to others."
"5 Star service, good food","Food was delicious and well-presented. The app for ordering was user-friendly, attractive and easy to use with clear pics. Food came promptly too though we ordered quite a lot and in a flurry Ambience was pleasant and comfortable. Loved the colour scheme of tropical pinks and greens as well as the resort-like furnishings. Variety could be wider‚Ä¶But for the price and at 25% off, one can‚Äôt complain.

The best part was the service. Friendly and diligent staff. We were very touched by how concerned they were about my MiL who had difficulties walking up and down the stairs at the restaurant entrance. They readily lent support. My MiL was too fearful of walking down the stairs‚Ä¶So a group of Ginger staff actually assisted to carry my MiL (while she was seated on one of e restaurant chairs) down the flight of stairs! For that, we‚Äôre really grateful. Well done, Ginger staff!"
Good review,"Really great staff, friendly. I would like to thank staff ANDRI for being very nice and very helpful. Will defintely come here again!! Nice place:) amazing"

Great Family Dinner,"Came to celebrate my daughter‚Äôs birthday. Seated very quickly, and food came almost instantly after ordering. It helps a lot that they have their menu online; that way we know what to expect. Quality was great for the price. They even brought out a piece of cake with a candle for my daughter afterwards. Staff were polite, attentive and pro-active. We never had to call anyone to ask for more water or to clear plates. Will come again!"
Excellent everything!!!,"It was my first visit and i was and still impressed with the quality of food, service and ambience. All the staffs are service ambassadors indeed, especially Andri. I bet u have never experienced such a service distinction in a buffet setting before. Andri makes us feel at home, and promptly seek our satisfaction on the food served. My wife has my 2 months old baby in her arms where the staffs demonstrated great compassion and care to ensure that we are warm and comfortable. Besides, the full stars for food, speed and setting, the service staffs are the star highlights. Definitely will come back!!!"
Celebration,"The food was great! Buffet was worth it!!! Really enjoyed the laksa, the keropok and sashimi. The durian dessert was a wonderful surprise."
Not wheelchair friendly,"The food was delicious and excellent service too. However the restaurant is not wheelchair friendly. There are huge flight of stairs that my wheelchair bound mother have to climb in order to get to the restaurant. Upon booking I have mentioned that I will be bringing my wheelchair bound mother, the staff didn't even mention to me about this matter. This mishap have caused alot of inconvenience to my mother. Nevertheless, all the staff were helpful and assisted my mother going up and down the flight of stairs."

Dinner @ Ginger by Tony Ng,"High-quality cuisine in reasonable, bite-sized pieces which will NOT overwhelm you. Makes for a good meal. Satay was good. Ditto the beef."
Love it!,"I truly love the whole hotel feel; the theme and decor of the reception area and Ginger restaurant! It was classy with a hint of nature. Just love the furnishings. The food was exquisite and there are quite a variety to choose from

The room was also well kept and refurbished. The toilet is extravagant and very classy! The staff are all kind, friendly and polite. You have to come and experience it yourself"

Also would like to mention the quality of the beef, lamb, salmon and lobster was extremely good and meat was lean and well cut! Great job!"
Great dining!,"We stayed for 2 days 1 night at Park Royal Beach Road. It eas a great stay with approachable staff and helpful staff. I want to say thank you again for Zi Hooi, she helped us a lot during our dining at Ginger for couple of meals. For a mom of 2 small kids, it's always a challenge to keep them seated, yet Zi Hooi always made sure that our needs are met. I missed to know the name of one staff at the Ginger, a downside of our stay. There were only 2 or 3 diners during one period, my 2yr old kept on walking but there were no people, yet this staff kept chasing us out. I hope she will be better."
Buy 2 get 1 free Lunch buffet promo,Friendly staff and quite good variety for lunch buffet! Worth the money. Just slightly rush due to the last order timing at 2.15pm.
Superb service with great taste of seafood.,It was a wonderful night to celebrate Mother's day Dinner at Ginger. Superb serivce and attention to details from a intern name Tristan. The seafood was very fresh and dessert was fantastic. Deserve a good rating for a hotel recently went for a makeover. I will definitely come again for another family meal.
Wonderful Dinner at Ginger,Great dining at Ginger. Place is nicely renovated. Desmond has provided us with amazing service. Definitely recommend ppl to come!
Mediocrity at its best. Looking good but missing the goodlookers.,"Mediocrity at its best. Newly rolled-out pink carpeted Ginger looks like a flamingo park gone berserk. It‚Äôs so pretty you see the trigger-happy influencer pictures wedged between your IG feeds. It‚Äôs brand new and everything screams happy and perky.

Sit a little longer and things turn awry. The crowds are not matching the beautiful interiors. Most turn up in lurid wear ‚Äì PJ‚Äôs, shorts, old tee‚Äôs and flip flops. The restaurant is looking good but missing the goodlookers. Hawkish, ungracious and dull are some of the adjectives that come to mind when describing them.

Lunch was a good selection of fare and honestly pretty good ‚Äì there‚Äôs a BBQ section of plenty of seafood and meats. Sashimi was plump pink tuna with perky salmon. We were so full we couldn‚Äôt possibly do the rest. Desserts were a select few but good. Chendol ice cream was a scream.

Staff were generally dour. I‚Äôm not quite sure if it‚Äôs because they had to contend with the discourteous and ungracious crowd. But one staff stood out ‚Äì Taha the bad tempered. He was constantly huffing and puffing. Even told me off as I walked by and looked at the desserts on display. I was swotted off and dismissed by him ordering me to order online. I merely stole a glance of the desserts. I‚Äôm not a suspect COVID-19 carrier. He was so unhappy cleaning, he clanked the plates loudly and something broke, sending broken pieces everywhere.

So look on the bright side ‚Äì pretty wallpapers and good food. But cast your eyes away from the crowds and avoid Taha the bad tempered where possible. #eatstylishtravelstylish"
Worst dining experience and disappointed towards the safety precaution,"Came to have complimentary dinner buffet with voucher given by our company as a reward however the dining experience totally let me down.

I was looking forward to have the dinner buffet with my sister seeing we also stayed in the hotel for 1 night. At the beginning, when we were guided to our table the staff were still okay. However, the next few moment really disappointed me.

I understand being in a buffet industry now there are a lot of restriction towards the buffet counter , still i was surprised there isn't much of variety of the food compared to other hotel , that was the first disappointment i have but i still loved the sashimi there though.

After that, that's where more disappointment and upset coming in.
I went through some ordering for the chili crab cause my sister liked it. However the chili crab was served without any glove but only crackers. Seeing this , we approached to one of the staff asking can they provide us any gloves or fingerbowl to wash our hand however the staff replied me ' there's no glove and the fingerbowl might be too small for us to wash our hand "" , from there i can expect the staff is actually hoped that we can straight go to the toilet to wash instead of serving us the fingerbowl. Still, we ask nicely to have just 1 fingerbowl and she goes without answering us anything.

During the moment, my sister accidentally cut her finger while cracking the crab and it was bleeding, I quickly asked one of the staff with black jacket ( a lady ) for a plaster and i waited for 5-10 minutes and she still hasn't returned. No choice, so i asked another staff to take the plaster for me. Luckily, some of the staff they noticed my sister finger is bleeding , and gave us some tissues and wet napkin but my god, IS THIS A PROPER WAY TO COVER THE WOUND? Back to the lady with the jacket, she came back after i asked so many of the staff for a quick plaster and she just said to my sister that they don't have dettol to clean the wound can go toilet wash the wound. Seriously? I was on the verge on going to leave the restaurant at once , SUPER disappointed with the way and the efficiency on how they actually treat a guest who cut her finger by not doing immediate safety precaution. The whole process took like 20 min just for a single cut wound.

Though in the end, we are thankful to the security and manager approached to us asking are we okay, but to be frank , by that time the dinner for the whole experience is totally RUINED. If it wasn't for my sister asking me to stay, i swear i would totally leave the restaurant.

After that, we continue our dinner and i asked the lady ( old aunty ) to help me remove my dish ( lobster and crab) because the chili crab can no longer be eaten since my sister has hurt herself, in the end, i was being scolded by the lady for wasting the food cause we didn't finish it. Excuse me? How can u expect me to eat when the incident already happen? I apologize for wasting the food but if i can't eat and what you want me to do? You want me continue to eat until the food is totally empty then only you clear? Is this the service that a normal restaurant should have given ? This is really upset, after she cleared the plates when i insisted. I have not order any more hot dishes nor cold dishes but straight go for the dessert already.

I have never written such a long feedback and i do not wished to spoil the restaurant reputation but however i think certain measure needs to be taken towards the way how they should treat your guest and being considerate to them as well.

Sorry, i would never come back to this restaurant again."
Dinner,"Very friendly and attentive staff especially this young man Tristen very friendly and always comes to us when we needed something.

The food for April is not as good as those we had in November last year."
Positive Complaint,"Was back again after so many years, Was impressed by the ambiance and decor of new Ginger restaurant. From Seating to scanning of QR Code to place order for the A la Carte buffet is fuss free. Staff that served me sorry did not get her name, very prompt service from her. Food came fast after order being place, Met Chef Vincent and Jacky they highly recommend the river prawn laksa, Satay, salted egg crab to me, indeed it is well executed, we end it with the famous Haid road Gula Melaka Tutu Kueh , Milo Dinosaur ice cream and some assorted pastry. Hot Food is always hot and fresh, Chill food is always chill. A must visit place! my family and I really enjoy our visit, looking forward to having dinner here again.. well done Ginger!"
"Food, service & ambience review","We had such an enjoyable evening over the wonderful food served. The food was delectable and our favourite has got to be the steak. The other dishes was pleasant as well. Their salted egg crab sauce was really good too. The food was served in a 'just nice' portion leaving us plenty of space to indulge in the other dishes.

Service was lovely too. Staff were attentive and ensure that we had a lovely dining experience. Their ambience was perfect as well. I love the revamped look - giving the restaurant a fresh insight accompanied with a timeless finish."
"Great ambience, family friendly.","Food was delicious, I truly enjoyed the sate lilit and laksa. The accompanying dips was very flavourful as well. The variety of food was great, I could find non-spicy dishes on the menu suitable for even my 1 year old child. Service could be slightly improved, I had to wait a bit longer for my orders to be sent to the table but I understand that it may have been because it was a weekend. Will definitely recommend Ginger to my family and friends!"
Great service,"Overall very satisfied and rewarding experience with Ginger! Great food and quick service. Something that can be improved on would be the sambas fish. Other than that, all the food were great!

Service wise, food were delivered rather quickly and our birthday request were met efficiently despite it being last minute.

Shout out to Zarli and Maria who were very pleasant and always served us with a smile.

Great job Ginger! Will definitely come back!"
Not good,"Had the buffet on Friday. The food is really cheap supermarket food. Spring roll, siew mai, pow, roti Prata, ngor hiang ... all taste like instant supermarket food. Satay was burnt. Fresh Salmon was super tiny slices. Even the desert cake were like bought from supermarket type. Food were also super slow in serving. Won‚Äôt be back for the buffets."
Ginger International Buffet,Food was extraordinary! The lobster Nasi Lemak is a must try!! Service was prompt and friendly too! It's an absolute 10/10!!
"Nicely renovated, with nice food and good service!","It has been about 2 years (June 2019) since our last visit here at this cafe, when we had our buffet dinner (during this period, we did visit it's sisters cafe, spice brasserie and lime, do checkout my earlier reviews here too). So we decided revisit again, this time for lunch. Since then, the cafe has transformed greatly and nicely renovated.

The cafe is more spacious, thanks to the new layout and structure, bright, trendy and more cosy. As it was a weekend, the cafe was quite crowded but well spaced out due to the social distancing policy.

In terms of food variety, it was very good as it had quite a wide spread, ranging International, Asian and local food. We didn't order all the food items and only chose those we like. Some of the ordered items included seafood platter, Hainanese chicken rice, satay, grilled salmon fish and sushi, prawn noodles, BBQ chicken wings, stewed beef etc, just to name a few. Most of the food were tasty and nice. The soup of the day was great too, very flavourful, if not wrong, broil radish soup with chicken.

The desserts were nice too, such as the ice cream with waffles, pastries and kuehs, fresh fruits. Coffee and tea were also inclusive in the ala carte buffet menu.

We noticed that all the food and drinks were served in the uniform dinning sets that were so nice and vintage.

The service was good too. Servers were friendly and efficient in clearing our used plates and in refilling our water regularly. Our order food were served promptly.

If there's areas for improvement, probably only 2. One, the table (based on the seat table we had) was a round one but it was small. With a few dishes coming almost at the same time, it was already full. In fact, a square table would be better.

Next, every table is given a small voucher, where only one diner could use it for once to visit the booth where food were displayed. I didn't know the rationale for this since the food on display were about the same as those listed in the order menu (at first we thought maybe different food). And they only restrict to one person per table per entry only (and what if there are 3~4 or more diners and each also wanted to take a look) citing Covid19 social distancing.

I remember not too long ago, we visited restaurants and cafes in other hotels, we could take a walk at the food booths and live cooking stations freely without any restriction (though we are socially responsible for the social distancing) and even took pictures with the chef and food on display (do check them out in my earlier reviews). So why this restriction? I find it puzzling and make no sense, if you want diners to take a look, then don't restrict it and if you are worried about the social distancing, then do away with this totally. (another alternative is to let the diners rotate, one by one instead of one person per entry only)

Overall, we enjoyed our lunch, and it's worth and good value for money. No doubt we will revisit this cafe again (as we are also Pan Pac Discovery members)."

Absolutely fantastic service,"Have to say this is hands down one of the best buffets with local fare i have had in a very long time. The staff are extremely attentive and helpful, a big shout-out to Tristen who went out of his way to ensure we were well taken care of. He exemplified the service quality expected in an institution like this"
Dinner buffet at Ginger restaurant,"Nice ambience. The ginger highlights didn't disappoint. Black pepper lobsters alone made the buffet worth it. Sashimi was delicious, and alot of thought put into platting. Beef steak was so-so but the truffle mash served with it was the winner today. Service was impeccable thanks to 2 elderly servers, they were kind and professional.

Some points for improvement: chili crab sauce can be more fragrant and sour, durian pengat can have more durian taste instead of cream taste."
Ginger Restaurant Park Royal Beach Road,Good selection of food and great service! Would be very helpful if the menu came with pictures as some dishes are a bit hard to visualise.

Choon Lian, the cashier was service oriented, she noticed my friend was complaining of his disposal mask string came off and she quickly offered him a disposal mask. Overall, it was great. Keep up the good job!"
