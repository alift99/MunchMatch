Tourist trab,They where just selling the weight. 2.4 kilogram for two persons far too much. No skirts and knife where serfed just after asking. My shirt was ruined since i got my skyrt only after asking.
"Pricy but great food, great ambiance & great service",Love their chilli crab & black pepper crabs. The wasibi prawns are very tasty too. Definitely will return if i want to splurge on a good Chinese dinner.
Disappointed,"Nothing like the old Red House, too upmarket, atmosphere none, compared to where they used to be,
Prices are much higher , service very average. The old Red House is still there but under a different name. We were told all types of stories why they they relocated but it did not add up, we walked past the old Red House building which was still the same and pumping. All in all very disappointing and a bit of a take, including charging for hand towels and and sauces you did not not ask for. Atmosphere was cold , stark and not many customers."
green star,Restaurant at great location good service very helpful when choosing from the big menu. portions are large & great food. For Singapore not bad value
"Ticks all the boxes - nice ambiance, good food, and great customer service,","Caught up for lunch with some dear friends and they chose this venue. I am glad they did as I would not have stumbled into this restaurant on my own. We had a huge array of dishes, and they were all fresh and tasty. The steamed fish was my favorite. The vegetables were all cooked to perfection. Tried the crispy small squid for the first time and it was great. Wilson looked after us, and he was superb. Great customer service."
Exceptional dim sum buffet and service,My family had dim sum buffet for lunch and the dim sum were exceptionally well. Worth the price paid. Staffs were attentive and the environment is very welcoming.
Feedback,"Food are yummy. Portion is small which is good, to reduce wastage since we can always order again if we like it, unless it's a one time order. The restaurant looks lovely. We had a birthday celebration for one of our girl friends and everyone enjoyed it. Staff service is generally pretty okay too, they are mostly friendly, except that it may not be easy to call for them at times."
Great Seafood,I had a business dinner at this place and the food was fantastic. The service was very friendly and made sure we got everything we needed. It is a bit on the price side but the quality of the food is worth it.
Quality food,This is a restaurant with essential atmosphere with a professional staff Food is high quality and fish very fresh Pepper crab was excellent and tasty
Disappointed,We booked online for 2045. We arrived on time to be told the kitchen was about to close and could we order straight away. We were then told there was no crab left which was the reason we had booked. We ordered but the experience had already been ruined for us. Why could they not have asked us to arrive earlier?? The food was good but very expensive for what it was. We will not be back
Outstanding dining experience,"The food quality is superb, the service is excellent, and the overall dining experience is outstanding. One of our favourite places in Singapore for dim sum and crabs."
Good Food and Service,Dim Sum selection was good and mostly delicious except one dish - steamed rice roll with you ciao is very blend. It could be better if it is filled with some stuffings. Service staff were generally attentive except seem to be too eager to promote their specialties. Overall we had a good time.
Fantastic service,"I have visited different outlets of Red House in the last few years but this was my first visit to the one in Grand Copthorne Waterfront.
The food was very good as usual but what set this restaurant apart was that the staff offered to peel the whole crab for us.
This was the first time I can recall this happening and it made a tedious process very easy indeed!
Anyway this was much appreciated and also the fact that there was free corkage for the first bottle of wine we brought.
We look forward to going back again."
Copthorne redhouse,Overall experience is quite good but was disappointed with the crab. Though it was stated that its 1.2kg the meat was not as solid as expected
Easily the best choice for a fuss free Dim Sum buffet,"Second visit to Red House at Grand Copthorne on 09/04 after being amazed by the food and service back in January. Warmly greeted at the entrance and escorted to our table by Moon Chan, who made sure our tea cups were always filled and you could feel her smile behind the mask. Mars Hu ensured that our dim sums arrived in a timely manner and smartly suggested the dessert dishes towards the end of our meal, agreeing to a half portion in order to not waste any food. A special mention has to go to Lesmund Chen - he served us on both visits and was always on top of all requests; be it for additional sauces or food items.

Overall, the food quality is fantastic for the price point even with the updated menu. We've tried other Dim Sum buffets around town but Red House will be our go to spot for the foreseeable future."
Great Value! Outstanding Service,The title says it all. Cant wait to return to enjoy the food again. Really fantastic service. The food was fresh and tasty
A superb dining,"Visited the Copthorne premises on a Friday evening. The service staffs were very friendly and helpful. Our food choices were assisted by the staff and it was excellent.

We were overwhelmed by the numerous choices in the menu. Highly recommended for any diners to try their impeccable service and quality of food."
Family Dinner,Seafood was fresh. Service was good. One of our favourite restuarant to dine. Think previous location was better but I guess this one is easier to locate.
High Quality Chinese cuisine at decent prices!,"If you like Chinese fine dining at decent prices, this is one place you should try! SGD28.80++ lunch buffet per adult during weekdays is a steal! When you are here, try the spicy dumpling, siew-mai, crispy cha-siew pastries, pumpkin soup, XO carrot etc"
Go-to Chinese restaurant,Great tasting and good service. Loved the stir fried bee hoon with the wok hey taste. Pumpkin porridge is not a commonly found dim sum item and is an great alternative to the usual century egg minced pork porridge. Crispy custard bun still taste great even after some time.
Free flow dim sum and wine amidst a beautiful contemporary facelift,"Like your dim sum free flow, amidst a beautiful setting? Red House Seafood just had a modern contemporary facelift. The hallways of the restaurant is well-lit with Chinese brush stroke prints. Dim sum free flow is at an incredible value ‚Äì with one-time order premium dishes such as fried clams (sauce is heavenly), crayfish, perfectly crispy-ed burramandi with Nyonya sauce and premium fried rice. The other dim sum favourites are succulent, with generous portions of fillings or shrimps. XO carrot cake is to die for. Service is prompt and. on-point. We even opted for free-flow sauvignon blanc at $28 which all in all was a value scream. I think prices will be raised soon so head here while the furniture is still green and everything with that coat of new-ness."
RED HOUSE AT GRAND COPTHORNE SINGAPORE,"3rd visit to RED HOUSE GRAND COPTHORNE within a month. Impeccable service by staffü§ó. Food are very fresh, good and deliciously yummyüòã. Thanksssss for the wonderful lunchüòâüôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è....keep up the good worküëçüëè"
Nice dimsum,"Overall dimsum variety is good. However, the chee cheong fun do not taste so good. This is at the grand copthorne branch, the restaurant is spacious and tables are spaced out."
Great Dim Sum,We went for their Dim Sum a la carte buffet. The food was of high quality and their service was impeccable.
Favourite spot for seafood.ü¶Äü¶û,Favourite spot for seafood. Finally back after a long cb. I missed the place and espcially the food. Must try here offcourse their unique fresh taste of chilli crab better than any other seafood in town. The quality of food are fresh and perfect local cuisine. Service are good and the ambiance are cozy.
wonderfull crab,Was with my family having the carb. the crab was so delicious and juicy. perfect wine varieties . A must visit restaurant.
"Good food, good service!",My family and I went there for a Christmas dinner. We ordered crabs; crab bee hoon and chilli crab. The dishes were well enjoyed by my family. The person taking our order was helpful; giving us advice about the size of their dishes and what would be a good size for our family. We had sufficient food; walking out full and satisfied. Service was generally good.
Less than impressed,"Came for dinner at the Clark Quay branch of this restaurant ( supposedly the Robertson Bay is better BUT was closed for renovations) at the suggestion of a Singaporean resident
To begin with ‚Äî service was sketchy at best ( think Fawlty Towers quirk ). Took three waiters to take the order of a martini and red wine on the menu !!
We came for the ‚Äúiconic‚Äù Singapore Crab Curry . A kilo portion recommended for 5 people. Also ordered the salted pork , roasted chicken and a morning glory vegetable dish
While the pork was quite tasty the rest of the food was just average. I may offend many Singapore folks ( and I apologize in advance ) ‚Äî the iconic crab dish is an overhype of ketchup and some chili sauce AND expensive!!
After a bill of over $300 , quite poor ( almost surly service by one particular waitress ) and still hungry , we went to satiate our appetite at another place
Do not mind paying for great food that comes in decent quantity ( we are by no means gluttons )
After a couple of visits to Singapore, I am of the opinion that quality food at decent prices are easily available at Hawker stalls ( of which we have had great experiences).
In conclusion ‚Äî if ambience and decor mean less to you than quality food ‚Äî head to the hawker markets and line up behind the stall with the longest queue. You will not be disappointed"
Awful doesn‚Äôt cover it,"There were 28 of us and this wasn‚Äôt our choice of restaurant as it had been booked by our tour guide. A few had dietary limitations (e.g. gluten free or mushroom allergies) but were offered only steamed Pak Choi and boiled rice. BEWARE they admitted that they do NOT cook anything from fresh and it all comes in already marinated. From starters to dessert this was basically fast junk food with no skill in preparation or presentation. From those who could eat the food the reports were that it was mushy and tasteless with exception of the crispy prawn parcels which were enjoyed.
This place needs to get up to date and a better attitude towards customers."
Recommended,"I went here based on my local friend‚Äôs recommendation and the food was so great. Best chilli crab I‚Äôve ever had
They also provided me with 40% discount on the lobster, the lobster was also great as well. I wish I can ask for their sauce recipes"
Terrible service,"Arrived approx 2115 told they shut approx 2200 said that was fine!
Harassed us until we ordered them food came which was ok! Waitress then came over and told me you must pay now as we are cashing up, so I paid added to the bill was pickles and tea, not ordered but put down, then waitress looking over shoulder to see if food finished! We felt rushed and there was no need for treatment. So sat there with glass of wine just to make a point!"
Good flexible response!,"I reserved Robertson quay, but I went to other place by my mistake. The shop was able to change the place of the reservation in a flexible response and put it in the shop. I'm very appreciated."
Go for their black pepper crab!,"Between chili crab and pepper crab, I always prefer pepper crab. And of all the pepper crab I've tried in Singapore--Jumbo Seafood, Long Beach, No Signboard--for some reason I love the Red House pepper crab the most. I think the recipe they use has chunky fried garlic bits and is slightly more ""saucy"" than some others. Whatever the secret recipe is, it's definitely finger-licking good! We also had the ""lala bee hoon"" or clams in rice noodles, which was also really tasty.

Tip: We were there for lunch which is really quiet, I think the restaurant is much much busier for dinner service, so maybe you'd need to book for dinner."
Great food,"This restaurant was recommended by a Filipino friend of mine who frequently visits Singapore and has a great taste for good food. So, my Singaporean friend offered to host a welcome dinner for me and my wife here.
We ordered a big Crab of 1.5 kg with Chilli Sauce, Crispy Squid, Red House Seafood Soup. We barely could finish all the dishes. Not thai they were not any good, but the portions were quite huge.
We had a great time."
Good food,"We had to be quick here because we arrived very close to closing time, which is strictly adhered to. We didn't waste time browsing the menu and settled for the waitress's recommendation, which was ""mixed seafood in a spicy sauce"". It was a good recommendation and we thoroughly enjoyed eating it. I would like to be able to go back, to enjoy it at a more relaxed pace."
"Robertson Quay Red House, Singapore","I love this restaurant. Choose a table outside for the best in people watching alongside the river. Sadly they didn‚Äôt have any Tiger Prawns to grill which would have been my first choice but the Whitebait was superb. As for the Sea Bass, which was cooked by dipping in boiling, oil - it was delicious as was the Pak Choi in Oyster sauce. Red House is a definite must do every time in Singapore!"
"Great food, friendly service","Great food, friendly service. Good menu, heavy on seafood. Not cheap, but reasonable prices. About to move to Copthorne Grand Hotel."
Excellent Seafood,We had a very good dinner together with friends at Red House. Service was good but most important the various sea food dishes we ordered were delicious. Will come here again next time being in Singapore.
Best Seafood Ever,Exceptional service... wonderful experience.. the crabs are awesome but you must try the custard lobsters! every dish was a delight..
Chez,"Totally agree with the last review, very overpriced. Food was average and to be charged for the pickled peanuts(which we did not order or eat) and the tasteless tea and wet towel, that we wrongly assumed were complimentary was disgraceful. Won't be back."
Chilli Crab and Soft shell Crab,My friend recommend to visit here. Here is one of famous Chilli Crab restaurant. I tried Chilli Crab and Soft Shell Crab. It‚Äôs delicious.
Awful rude staff and rushed as w aged to close at 9pm! Avoid at all costs,"Arrived at 845pm and we were told that the kitchen closed at 9:30 last orders 9:15pm .
That‚Äôs fine that‚Äôs half an hour to order we thought.
So we take a look at the menu and after 10 minutes the waitress is snatching the menu from me telling us what we should eat and why we shouldn‚Äôt order what we actually want to Order!

We politely ask if we can order drinks ?
One beer is 13 or for a jug it is 33 so my partner goes for the jug to which she says you won‚Äôt drink all that !
She then grabs menu again and says appetiser and one main enough as we won‚Äôt eat it all and walks off!

We call another waiter over to ask if they really don‚Äôt want us there and he says no all fine.

Ten mins later no appetiser arrives but one main course does and with no plates to eat it off !
Needless to say we were looking forward to eating here but the service was so rude abrupt and disdaining that we actually just paid for the drinks and left , minus the cheek of a service charge they tried to add on for insulting us !
Oh and watch the additional S$5 for soggy nuts, rank tea and a wet wipe which also aren‚Äôt complimentary.

If you are happy to accept rude service then I am sure the food might be good"
Nice food,Visited tonight with family 22/8/2019. Food was really nice and didn't have to wait long. Service was somewhat awkward in that the language barrier was a fair issue. Not a very kid friendly menu and far more suitable for adults only.
A bit disappointed ...,"This one received high recommendations from several online sites. We visited as a business group dinner and I was pretty disappointed. The famous crab dish was over cooked (crab meat was dry), and other dishes were all of average quality."
expensive restaurant,"I think the place here is targeted for tourists. Chilli crab is average, not spicy, too much ketchup. Total spent is $1,200++, 9 pax for ordering of 4 seafood dishes, 1 poultry, and some beers. I think that it is overpriced and food taste is average."
Bad service n horribly hot,"Booked for company dinner and wanted to impress overseas guests with singapore‚Äôs famous crab dishes.
Given a corner table which was stuffy n hot. So we moved to another table which was also at back of restaurant. It was so hot my guests could not enjoy the meal. So the staff turned in a huge noisy fan which did little to help.
Service was bad and they don‚Äôt serve water at all. Never going back!"
The Chilli Crab is to die for,We have been here a few times but always at the original venue. This time we went to Robertson Quay and we were no disapointed. The chilli crab is to die for. Make sure us use the bib. It can get really messy.
Authentic food experience,"We enjoyed a variety of foods, sharing plates for more opportunities to try. Very few tourists which was great ! Families and locals .... sit upstairs for more atmosphere. Food was excellent"
Delicious food there,I think Red house seafood restaurant is the best seafood restaurant in Singapore. And the prize of food is resonable
Delectable Seafood and excellent service,"We went there for lunch to welcome our new colleague on board. I have to give compliments to Ms Agnes for her recommendations of food and Mr Raven Sam for his attention and excellent service to our table. Raven is like a hawk, watching us to make sure we have the best dining experience, automatically refills of beer and tea, additional napkins was given to us without even the need to request verbally from him.
Best to try their black pepper crabs, chili crabs with bun, bamboo clams and seafood fried rice!"
Delicious mild chilli crab.,"Another example of a great chilli crab restaurant, we had no reservation on a Friday night and were given a table within 5 minutes.. very affordable, very tasty and I‚Äôd say mid spicy chilli crab recipe. Would definitely return."
Last night meal,"This restaurant was recommended to us by the hotel and we were not disappointed, we had the signature Chilli crab and lobster both excellent. Would highly recommend."
"Decent food, nothing great","Hopped in for lunch. expected more from the restaurant. service was prompt. food took some time to arrive (ordered 4 dishes, the first 2 arrived much earlier than the others). Felt for the taste, it was overpriced."
Chili crab is best,"Chili crab is the must-try food at this restaurant. They also have crab with black pepper but to me, chili crab is still best. Cons: location is difficult to find, even grab driver also got lost at that area"
"Amazing Dinner with Crab and prone etc,No where I enjoyed similar test and I am unable to compare.",Always better to go there early as place is getting full as time goes on.You will never have disappointments
"Food OK, service a little haphazard","Nice location on Robertson Quay.

After getting a table it took a while before anyone came to get our drinks order. Same with ordering dinner. Food decent enough though not at all memorable and expensive for what it was.

We ordered a couple of starters, a fish dish, belly pork and bok choi, and the pork arrived way after everything else. We were on the point of leaving when it finally appeared.

Be aware, the tea, peanuts and wet wipes which appear as you're seated all go on the bill. If you don't want them, make sure to tell your waiter."
Best steamed cod ever,"This is a great restaurant in Robertson Quay [no where near as busy as Clarke's Quay].

We had a great meal including squid cooked in three different styles and also the best steamed cod in soya sauce that I have ever tasted.

We were a little rushed as it was late in the evening and they wanted to close. Should have perhaps told us this before we were seated?

However the food was delicious and the location very pleasant."
Excellent crab,"Good food, pepper crab and crab in sauce, appetizers Vibrant, inviting atmosphere, cozy restaurant in a magnificent location, along the river"
Good Food but take care of the rip off,"The chilli Crab is outstanding, but then they offer you water and wet wipes afterwards which all cost extra. The staff must tell the clientelle. I felt cheated after such a good meal. Also the toilet is not the cleanest for the gents when you walk through the kitchen to get to it"
Good Food-Nice Location,We wanted to have some of the famed Singapore Chili Crab and this was a recommended place for it. We found the service to be good and the the food was very good. The chili crab was certainly enjoyed to the end but all other dishes were tasty and flavourful as well. It is bit off the beaten track but not really out of the way. Also it is on the pricey side so you need to be prepared for that.
Expensive and impersonal,"Went there for Pepper Crab dinner.
The place is often very full, so this must mean some peoiple like it, but no for me.
The food was OK, not amazing, just OK. The service was sketchy, cold and impersonal. When paying Singapore crab and Singapore wine prices, I expect more.
Many locals eating here, perhaps this is acceptable for Singaporeans, but is not my choice."
OH MY GOSH DELICIOUS!,"You must not miss this restaurant for your life! I visit Singapore 4x a year and sometimes it is only to eat in this restaurant. I love their chili crab, their black pepper crab and their cereal prawns. Price is just right for the taste. Their mantou bread is delicious too. Please make a reservation."
The flavours of the Crabs were superb,We had white pepper Crab plus chilli crab and a mixed seafood chilli dish as well as other side dishes and I must say ALL were excellent and thoroughly enjoyable. Was told to try this one by a local expat and he was right. Cost around SID 80 per person which for such food I did not find expensive
Dinner with typical Singapore food (pepper/chilli crab),Loved the food and the presentation of it. Restaurant is clean but very noisy and medium level of customer service. However we had great fun and I will certainley come back.
"Terrible service, hot and overpriced","Waited nearly 20 minutes before we managed to place an order by catching a waiter as she walked past. Another 10 minutes before our drinks came (a beer and a glass of wine). Other customers who arrived 15 minutes after us were already on their first course. A further 15 minutes elapsed before the first of our 2 dishes came, a plate of beef with spring onion and ginger. The second dish (pak choi in oyster sauce) failed to materialise at all. The other tables who arrived after us were being served their second dish. Having finished our first dish, we eventually managed to attract the attention of another waiter, and told her to forget the pak choi, we had waited too long. It was nearly 50 minutes since we had first arrived. She rushed back with the missing dish which we refused to take and asked for the bill. This came, less the charge for the pak choi, but with charges for ‚Äúwipes‚Äù which we didn‚Äôt use, plus tea and a little dish of pickles which we didn‚Äôt ask for and had assumed were complimentary. $65 for a small dish of beef with spring onion and ginger, a glass of Asahi beer and a glass of white wine, the whole exercise taking an hour was an example of shocking and careless service. The place is hot (there are huge fans but no A/C). We went there because it appeared popular. Can‚Äôt for the life of me think why. There are far better Asian restaurants on Robertson Quay than this. Allen & Sheila Hull, Margaret River, Western Australia"
Bottomless glass of beer,"Getting pissed while getting through the first three courses, entrenched in conversations with the people on your table... it was provocatively fantastic!!! Not only did the food taste amazing, but i never had to ask for a top up.

Amazing seafood, great portion size for six at the table. Two types of chilli crabs, amazing egg yolk fried fish, and fried rice as the second last course which was well executed so i wasnt too full by the end of the 9 course banquet. Finished off by mango pudding, life was just awesome that evening."
Excellent chili crab but you pay for it,"We took a table outside on Robertsson Quay cause weather was warm for dinner.
We started with some spicy vegetables, Sambal Kang Kong, that we liked very much. Two glasses of Clasberg beer and 6 Fried buns (bread for the crab¬¥s sauce).
Then we asked for a Sri Lankan chili crab of 1,200 Kg to be shared and specified that we wanted it not too spicy and the crab was the freshest one I¬¥ve ever had eaten.
At the end the bill was of 210,20 $ SGD, which is 140 ‚Ç¨ for uscoming from Basque Country, between Spain and France."
"Very good seafood and if you like it spiced up, this is the place","it does look like a Corporate Canteen, many tables, noisy though when you get the dishes you forget about it and enjoy the great seafood. I like spicy and here you can be assured that if you say ""please spicy' it will be spicy. Got the squid/prawns spicy dish, very good, and spicy noodle with seafood, very good as well, Do not forget to book on weekends evening"
CNY New Year Lunch-Very Nice,Had a small CNY lunch there with my team. Really enjoyed it. Service was attentive. Food was excellent. Was a bit warm but then again isn't everything in Singapore?
"Amazing food, service is just ok","We arrived around 7pm without a booking and although the place was basically full we were quickly seated.

We were however told they had no crab or lobster which seemed odd at 7pm.

The food we did order was all exceptional.

Service was very hit a miss and not very friendly as a whole.

I'd go back for the food...."
"Massively overpriced, cold and glutinous chilli crab","Hmm, would you pay $150 for a medium-sized crab in a cold glutinous sauce, and a jug of beer? I thought not. I won't again either. I am grateful they found me a spot, and it was nice to see the dragon (Chinese New Year), but that wasn't the restaurant's doing."
Great food but service needs some work,"Ate dinner here and can thoroughly recommend the black pepper crab and also the trio of squid starter.

Service however is a bit wayward and there are ""hidden costs"" such as chinese tea and nibbles. Whilst it was good to see the kitchen being cleaned it was possibly not the time as we were still eating as water was sloshed around near the walkway to the bathroom.

Given the service issue a bit pricy for me."
Loved the chili crab,A great meal that we both enjoyed - a relaxed atmosphere and great food (especially the chili crab with fried buns)!
Yummy chili crabs,"The chili crabs are really delicious. We, 2 people, shared a Sri Lanka crabs (~110SGD). Also ordered fired bun and shrimps which are good as well. It is a bit pricey, but it also pay for the comfortable environment and good services."
Dinner for 3 pax,"There‚Äôs no AC so can be quite humid.
Food below average but service great. Was quite empty for a Saturday night peak hours.
1. Ordered two Sri Lanka crabs each S$88. The steamed one was excellent - fresh and hard. The chilly one below average. You can crack it easily with your teeth. The chilly sauce is not as good as some other seafood places. The buns were ok

2. The bamboo clams were tastily prepared
Recommend

3. Don‚Äôt order any starters that‚Äôs fried. Eg. Chefs trio or salt & pepper bait. They are average and not value for money

Overall pricey >$100 per head"
Waiter clean table without asking,It was a bad experience due to the waiter always clean your table with your permission even you are still having your meal. Food was great but i will not visit this branch anymore.
Reservation through Chopes!,"Took my daughter who was visiting from Toronto to Red House, food and service were good as usual, had the chilli crabs and black pepper crabs, razor clams, lobster (2 ways) and a veggie dish. First time to book through Chopes though and bought the cash coupons, the only thing I didn‚Äôt like was having to let the restaurant know I had coupons prior to ordering, somehow I felt the restaurant either charged more or reduced the quantity of the food. Just saying???"
Well below average,"This is a very expensive place to experience Singapore dining. They charge you for napkins, the peanuts on the table and green tea that is given to you upon sitting down. The food quality is average with the price being very expensive. Singapore is a destination where dinning is part of the experience as there are many cultures and cuisines for the traveler to enjoy, Red House is not one of them and it unfortunately gives Singapore an unfavorable reputation. Sad, as this review is the only negative review I have of Singapore after my fourth visit to the fantastic country."
Red star,Great location Great service very helpful when choosing from the big menu portions large great food . For Singapore not bad value
Lobster noodle is the best.,"It is easily the best around. Bit pricey but hey YOLO! You are worth it. A Creamy and rich sauce with fresh lobsterüëç. they used lobster from Maine , USA."
Just ok!,"Ok ! It‚Äôs boiling hot in Singapore and to eat in a non air conditioning place is not to clever.
The chance of getting Singapore belly is high as we learnt .
All the locals come to this restaurant so I guess its popularity over shadowed the food.
Which is very ordinary. We had cray fish which was on special and spinach for a veggie rice was good. I would not go back."
Dinner on holiday,"I had researched this restaurant before leaving Australia it did get some good reviews and some ordinary
Very disappointed not choice of crabs advertised as we went to have black pepper crab sauce lovely however brown Scottish crab not as good as other crab we have eaten
Make sure you refuse peanuts and wet cloths that are provided as they charge you and do not tell you this
We took our own paper towels
Over all very overpriced for what we got and service not good had to ask for water and although we booked in advance they had no record of this"
Best seafood in town,"We had our favourite dishes there. Drunken prawns along with an amazing delicious tasting soup. Kailan ( green veggie) in oystersauce, and chilli crab with buns. Those chilli crabs are hard work to eat but so tasty with that wonderful, aromatic gravy. Truly a great taste experience. However after the work you can clean and wash your hands right there. We will be back!"
Seafood Extravaganza,We were looking for somewhere to eat on our first night in Singapore and stumbled upon this great place. Easy going atmosphere with great choice and amazing food. I'd certainly recommend that you try this if you are anywhere nearby!
Brilliant Crab House,"A brilliant crab and seafood house. Chilli and pepper crab to name a few. Assorted prawns and fish, all fresh and cooked to perfection. Excellent service in. Great and relaxed location . Highly recommended and delicious!"
"Good Chinese seafood restaurant, but pricey","I was recommended this restaurant by a work colleague in Singapore, in part because it was very near my hotel, next to the Singapore river. As only in Singapore for a night, I thought about splashing out on a lobster, offered at half price. When I converted the money, it would still have cost well over ¬£50, so I took the helpful waitress's advice and ordered the 'Seafood Combination', which she said was a house speciality. It was delicious, with juicy King Prawns, Squid and much else! But still a bit pricey. With two small beers, and a plate of Morning Glory, the bill came to over ¬£50. Perhaps that is what you pay in Singapore, for a pretty good restaurant. If so, then I would recommend the seafood here, and the pleasant location by the river."
"Excellent food, fast service","Open air restaurant at bay area, quite big place that may host hundread and more people .... regardless of the size, food is absolutelly superb and service very fast price is rather ‚Äúfor tourists‚Äù so a but highly priced for this type of restaurant"
Great Chilly crab in a classic Singapore seafood ambience,"One of the many joys of eating out in Singapore is its unpretentious and bustling seafood restaurants. Red House offers just that, plus great Chilly crab with man tau (small toasted buns to sop up the yummy gravy with), sauteed prawns and Chinese vegetables and tender and crispy chicken.

Service is spotty at such places, with lots of hand waving needed to catch someone's eye, but that's what unpretentious also means :)

This is Singapore style community eating at its most enjoyable!"
Seafood for Two,"Wanted some seafood and this restaurant did not disappoint. We went without reservation for 2 persons. Pleasantly surprised that we had a seat in minutes even though the restaurant was full and not taking reservations. We had chilli crab and the seafood Hor fun. Both were very tasty. Overall a great experience with the service, taste of food and price. Recommended!"
Crab ü¶Ä classics,"The new downtown location means that I don't have to travel all the way to East Coast Park to indulge in my crab binge. The restaurant is well decorated with a good offering of seafood. Prices are steep for the crab but you do get quality, fresh meaty crabs. We order the chili and white peppered crab. The sauce of the chili crab has the right consistency and taste, I even found tiny lumps of crab roe in it. The sambal kangkong was top notched. However the crispy smoked duck is rather dry. Service was efficient and friendly, and no cake charge when we brought our own birthday cake"
Authentic,"At Clark Quay looking for somewhere to eat and came across this place. Arrived at 930 pm last orders at 945pm and closed at 1030, food was good had the mixed seafood in chilli with sides of mixed veges and rice, reasonably priced $80 with tea and soft drinks, clean and well serviced"
Authentic Chinese food,"We spent our last night in Singapore here after being recommended here by a business man that worked here for over 8 years and boy did his recommendation pay off. The restaurant was packed with locals and tourists.

The menu was rather extensive but very easy to understand and order from, I recommend always ordering small portions and then ordering more if required as a large portion is very large unless a few people are eating from it. We were a group of 10 and ordered around 8-10 dishes (a mixture of veg and meat dishes), we ordered all small dishes and we all managed to taste each dish.

The food comes out to the table as soon as its ready in true authentic Chinese style but please note that if you order rice or noodles - these come out last after all the meat and beg dishes have been served. This is Chinese culture so if you fill up on meat dishes you won‚Äôt have room for noodles/rice so bare this in mind when ordering.

I couldn‚Äôt fault the food but the service was a little lacking, not too sure if it was just because we were tourists/foreigners or because of a slight language barrier but service could definitely be improved.

Overall we had a pleasant meal which was reasonably priced at around $40 SD per head including alcohol."
Over rated and so expensive,Just not worth it. Very disappointed. The food was ‚Äúok‚Äù but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend and the price is ridiculous for what you get. Service was great but that‚Äôs about it..... as soon as we left we went straight to maccas. Only disappointment in Singapore.
Attentive staff and good food,A very delicious meal was had by all and served by very attentive staff. We were offered tea to start with which was lovely. Everything was fresh including the juice.
Good but expensive,"We had chosen a different restaurant to eat in (Beasts and Butterflies) but unfortunately they were showing a World Cup match so we wouldn't get the quiet meal as a couple that we were expecting. We chose Red House as it was quieter especially inside. We were told that a special dish (lobster I think) was half price but still over $100! We chose more reasonably priced dishes, including squid cooked three ways which was excellent. However the menu is better suited to larger groups so that more dishes can be shared. Service was attentive and polite."
Very good but very dear too!,Excellent location. Very busy. Very good food. But not at all cheap. Charging for wet wipes and poncho napkins is a bit over the top when the food is so costly- in my opinion.
a delicious evening meal surrounded by what seemed to be locals,"the walk from the centre of Singapore up the river is rewarded as the evening atmosphere is vibrant and the flora beautiful and the river clean and choice of restaurants huge but if you persist to Robertson Quay you will find a great seafood restaurant with good veggie options and other dishes too - tea served on arrival and throughout the meal, waiters who warn you if you are ordering too much rather than just serving too much and billing for it, etc."
Good,Quick service. Amazing food. Good environment. Prices where higher then expected but the crab was delicious!
"Chili Crab; Pepper Crab, and Great Waitstaff","Red House is a bit hidden ""in the back"" of Robertson Quay. We were glad we had reservations because it poured (happens a lot in Singapore) and the outside tables were unusable. Staff provides almost poncho-like napkins because the main dishes are things ""you really get into."" Helpfully, hand washing stations are easy to find. The only drawback - and it is no secret -- is that this is not a cheap place to eat. Those can be found elsewhere in Singapore, but Red House is absolutely reliable for quality."
Totally Amazing Experience - Singapore Visitors Its A Must Visit,Fresh is best and that's what you will discover here!. Amazing dishes cooked to perfection which will guarantee your return. Great and efficient staff on detail with every dish. So many choices on offer which we only sampled a few which licked our taste buds beyond belief. First time here and will be back for sure when visiting Singapore again.
