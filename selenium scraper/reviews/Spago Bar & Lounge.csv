Great Meal Great Service from Shri,Great Presentation. Shri created a great evening dinner experience. Highly recommend this restaurant. Food is excellent and plentiful. Steak cooked perfectly. Gooey Cheese Mashed Potatoes was a first and excellent
Food melts in the mouth @Spago. Try the Unagi Don it come with Foie Gras it‚Äôs so good. Tuna Cone a must,"The food @ Spago is amazing.
Unagi Don, sushi, burgers, pastas, octopus we ordered a variety to share so we can try everything
Their beef is Excellent! Cook to the way my husband like it Rare.
The cocktails are good too. I see lots of people ordering different kinds of cocktails. I will try it next time I am there. Do book a table so you won‚Äôt be disappointed. It‚Äôs getting very busy there. Thankfully the service is still excellent."
must reserve.,"It was our 17th Wedding Anniversary, but Chinese New Year so everything was fully booked. I wanted the Spago Dining but no available table for an earlier time, so we went here instead. More for cocktails and casual dining. Tables and chairs are not that comfortable. I was on the lounge chair while my husband was given a stool. We just sat together on the lounge sofa. Service was great."
I'm worth it,"I have always wanted to dine by a pool on a tropical sunny day like in Hollywood movies, or as pictured in some glossy travel magazine. What better way to do it than by the infamous Infinity Pool at Marina Bay Sands. Just make sure to reserve a table in the right section. The view of the pool and the city was superb, and I was blessed by the weather gods cos it was not too hot, with just enough sunshine-breeze balance. It was very much a big tick before we even got to the cocktails and food.

The cocktails were a decent serving size, with really clever and well-balanced flavour combinations. It had just enough ice (in fact, one chunky block) to keep my drink cold, but not too much to water it down or hinder drinking. Very thoughtful design and construction. If you are a gin person, I would recommend Bird in the Hand and London Calling on the Handcrafted Cocktails list. They are deliciously easy to drink.

For meals we ordered a few appetisers / entrees - Big Eye Tuna Tartare Cones, Chicken Laksa Spring Roll and Chicken Karaage. Worldly mentions to the first 2 first-class dishes. I have heard so much about the Chicken Laksa spring roll, just couldn't quite imagine how it is put together. PSA - Everyone HAS to order this dish - how they managed to give tender thin noodles and chicken all that authentic local laksa flavour without it making the spring roll soggy while encased in the thin crispy pastry, I have no idea but who cares. It is a spring roll done right, VERY right. The Tuna Tartare Cones are a very pretty sight on presentation. Cones are delicious wafers and crispy, and the combination of the melt-in-your-mouth tuna, aioli, masago and the bonito ... so delicious I didn't stop to savour and think what the wafer cones are made of, it's just yummy.

Mains and desserts are equally impressive. We ordered Grilled Iberico Pork Chop and the NY Strip Sirloin. The pork chop (ordered medium-done) was juicy and tender. The chef did justice to the cuts of meat."
Pricey,"Pricey but wonderful experience. Food excellent, staff great and if you sit outside the view is amazing!"
Excellent bar and lounge with great views and innovative cocktails ! üòÅ,"Innovative and tasty cocktails, good service and great ambience with spectacular views !
The cocktails are intelligently constructed so it‚Äôs easy to choose a cocktail with firstly the preferred base liquor eg. gin or vodka and then can check out the other flavours eg elderflower, fruits etc"
"Great food, drink and views","Amazing experience will recommend to everyone - family really enjoyed the atmosphere, food and drink. Will be back next time we visit!"
"Best views, best food","Best foods with best views. Prices are affordable and food quality is exceptionally delicious. But best of all, the staff all aim to leave fond memories for every visit to this 57th floor paradise."
Fantastic,"Amazing experience - the cocktails, food, ambience & staff.
They serve bar bites after 2:30pm & they were curated to perfection- highly recommend the sushi platter & beef sliders amongst bar bites.
Expensive No doubt even though not a fine dining but recommended for a delightful once in a while luxury."
Visit for Dining,Nice n Friendly staff. Very obliging n care for guest very attentive. Nice ambience n wonderful environment
A nice drink and good in a great roof top place,"The staff is very friendly, the drinks and food have a good variety, the view is great only a little bit expensive. We did enjoy our visit and will go again."
Never disappoints!,"Lovely ambience to enjoy cocktails and bites with family and friends - great service, excellent location and very friendly and attentive staff!"
Loved it!,Husband said it was one of his favourite steak dishes. Really loved the cocktail as well and the ambiance was great! Staff were really attentive as well!
Bday celebration,Staff were absolutely friendly & cheerful. Keep up the good work! My fren were given a cake without us asking! Fantastic service.
Mr,Great place to relax and dine with splendid cocktails. Recommended for couples and friends get together.
Mrs,Excellent menu and delicious food. Remarkable atmosphere with a view to the Infinity pool. A special consideration about the restaurant‚Äôs staff for its kindness. A highly recommended restaurant!
Farwell dinner,Perfect and I will definitely recommend and visit again and again. My third times visiting the Spago and I have a rebate always since I am a member of MARINA BAY SAND
Great place to unwind.,"First time to visit with family who I have not seen for a long time. It was a great place to have drinks, relax and catch up with each other. It's one of those places where you just have to bring your visitors whenever they come to Singapore. Staff were all friendly and service was fast. Will definitely comeback."
Yuva saved the day,"The evening didn't start out right. It seemed that we had to be asked, ""What's the name on the reservation?"" by three different people before getting seated. Then we didn't get the seat by the pool, which was what we had reserved. After a bit of back and forth with who I believe was the manager we sat down

This is when things got a lot better. One of the people who saved the evening was Yuva. His attentiveness in the midst of a busy room - and with a big smile and humour - really was important. It's not about him offering to take our photos; it's more about checking up on us, and just doing it all along with two other gentlemen whom I didn't get their names sadly.

Because of him I went from a not-so-good evening to an amazing one."
What a location - memorable drinks & dining,"Fab cocktails ‚Ä¶ considering how big they were we considered these great value for money.

We both had the Aberdeen Angus burger - really tasty with a good size portion of delicious French fries.

Friendly staff & service. What a location !!

Next time we are in Singapore we will be back!"
First Time with Spago,"First, I would love to praise the service staff for their pleasant and friendly service. They were far one of the bests service I've experience through F&B industry. Specially mentioning our main server Guna and Billy who kept checking on us and ensuring we get what we need. Thankful for the reservations team for arranging a beautiful corner for us for a more comfortable dining. Not forgetting the nicely done dishes. The fries was a cherry on top. Such a simple dish and done so well! Kudos to the whole Spago Team. Please keep it up and I will keep coming back."
A bar not to be overlooked,What‚Äôs not like about the amazing view from Spago. Not to mention the friendly and professional staff and the amazing cocktails!
Lunch,"I visited Spago at lunchtime today and the service , food and location were excellent. The blackened Cod was exquisite- perfectly cooked with just the right flavours and accompaniments . The staff were attentive and friendly and the view was stunning . The experience was certainly worth the money- Thankyou !"
Great food and drinks. Amazing People!,"My wife and I frequent Spago Bar & Lounge mainly due to the amazing, friendly, attentive, and accommodating people (especially Mira their awesome manager, and Riza who carefully attended to us at our recent visit with family). Spago's great selection of bites and skilfully crafted drinks never disappoints! My wife and friends always look forward to our next visit to this exciting spot!

Thank you again, Mira, Riza, team!"
EOY Celebration,We truly enjoyed our moments at the Spago Bar for our End-of-Year event. View was spectacular and selection of cocktails was excellent. Definetely will return!
Outstanding views & Cocktails,"We were celebrating my birthday and really liked the idea of tapas type menu along with a great selection of cocktails. We were looked after by a variety of staff but were treated especially well by Arlene. The Tapas menu was varied & catered for our taste & we enjoyed several cocktails whilst watching the sunset & then the ""tree show"". A great experience on the 57th floor"
"Spago, my favourite restaurant","Excellent service from the staffs at Spago. Although the bar is very busy the staffs attended to our orders promptly.
Our lunch was amazing. The quality of food at the bar is just as good. Chef Greg is creative and comes out with new items on the menu. The Unagi Don with Foie Gras is so delicious. I love it. Will be back for more.
My daughter had her favourite cocktail the double happiness which she loves. Makes her doubly happy. Would highly recommend Spago to all who have not been there. But please make a booking as they have a months waitlist"
Anniversary Celebration,"Visiting Spago Lounge and Bar was a gift to ourselves for our 40th wedding anniversary and it did not disappointment.
The waitress we had serve us was excellent and a delight, the drinks were refreshing and food scrumptious.
The views amazing and we were able to watch day turn to night and see the Singpore light come on from the 57th floor."
"Great view , Amazing Service","Amazing staff from host to floor staff and managers!! The service made the visit extra special! Thank you to Daniel, Chigie and Angela for your amazing service"
Delicious food with a view!,"What a great place to experience the views and food of Marina Bay Sands! Managed to sneak in a booking at 6.30pm the day before, just in time to watch the sunset (recommend 6pm instead!). The hostess was excellent recommending food from the menu and checking in throughout the dining experience. Chicken Karaage and the Spanish Octopus we divine, whilst Tempura Prawn Roll was good, but lacked flavour/crunch. Tainted Love and Forbidden Kiss cocktails also an excellent accompaniment to the food. A great way to finish off an excellent stay in Singapore."
"Great bar bites and wine, impeccable service","My friend and I visited Spago lounge two weeks ago, on a Saturday for drinks and bar bites. It was my second visit to Spago and, as with the last time, I was super impressed with the food, atmosphere and of course the impeccable service. I love the variety and quality of the bar bites on offer, my favourites being the rich, gooey grilled cheese sandwich (I love the salty, melty cheese with the sweet cranberry walnut bread and quince paste), the pork belly steamed buns (the pork belly is so tender), and the fabulous moist and flavourful beef sliders. The sticky toffee pudding we had this time was also excellent.

But even more impressive was the excellent service we received. I booked quite a bit in advance and asked for an indoor table near a window, which I was kindly given. When I arrived I also asked if we could have our dining time extended past the usual two hours if possible, which was also quickly granted and much appreciated. The best part of our experience though was our server, I believe her name was Arlynne. She was exceptional. We ordered wine, and when she poured my first glass of moscato we noticed that it wasn't very sparkly, so she quickly whisked away the glass and opened a whole new bottle for me. My friend, who is admittedly quite picky, didn't like the first two wines she tried, and Arlynne happily and knowledgeably suggested alternatives and brought them to her to try until she found one she liked. And she was just so kind about it, never getting annoyed or rushing my friend in her choice. She also took our food orders, checked in frequently to make sure we were happy with the food, to bring us more wine and to ensure we were enjoying our night. She was truly lovely, some of the best service I've ever had! A reason to return for sure."
Excellent services!,"Excellent services, especially Gelo and Nelo. They made our dining experience a most enjoyable one. Food and view are good as well."
Great spot for cocktails and view,Lively place for a small meal and drinks. Right at the top of hotel so great views. Cocktail was delicious and the food high quality. Reasonably priced given location.
The best bar in Singapore! If you want a great hospitality experience in Singapore please visit spargo lounge.,Good service that you seldom experienced in Singapore. The view from the bar is fantastic! Definitely a best choice if you have a friend from oversea.
"Busy, expensive but worth the experience.","Nice place, but so busy and really expensive food considering they‚Äôre light bits and you‚Äôd need to order a lot and spend a fortune to have a meal. We had to ask to order, ask a lot for our bill - just understaffed for the volume of people there. That being said, the food and drinks were lovely and it‚Äôs a beautiful setting. Don‚Äôt expect to get to the pool though - it‚Äôs under lock and key behind an extra key-fobbed wall."
Wonderful night,"I have spend time here with wife and 3yers son for his birthday. It was very goo mood and wonderful service. Especially, His birthday plate was so nice. We really happy and enjoyed."
Great food with a great view!,Love the quality of food. Fresh and creative approach and beautiful presentation. The staff was friendly and attentive! The view was superb too!
Great food and exceptional service,"Fabulous view, great food and impeccable service. Special shout out to Rann for his dedication in making us feel special when he found out we were there for a birthday celebration. Their Iberico Pork tasted heavenly; Cocktails were lovely too."
Business Traveler,Fantastic food and drinks with a one of kind view of Singapore. Excellent service and a must try for anyone visiting the Lion City
"World class view, service and food!",I loved my time at Spago and will come again. The Grilled cheese sandwich redefines the name. it's other worldly wonderful!
Nice top deck place at MBS,Delicious food for breakfast / lunch /dinner. Great variety for finger foods and nice cocktails. Waiting time can be pretty long at peak hours.
T&T say it‚Äôs great,"awesome location, very delicious and special drinks, very attentive staff, not to worry if you come with allergies highly recommend for a nice evening out at a special location right next to the pool"
Spago Bar & Lounge,"We booked a 2 hour window from 7pm to 9pm, and the location of and view from this restaurant were absolutely remarkable. We were able to witness 'Gardens by the Bay' being lit up, and were able to see all the boats illuminated on the water. The service was extremely efficient and friendly, and the staff were happy to accommodate us. But the food was the real star of the show! I thoroughly enjoyed the Spicy Tuna Rolls and the Vegetarian Rolls, both of which I highly recommend. The one fault that I found was the fact that the music was being played a tad too loudly; if the volume was turned down I would have absolutely no improvements to offer."
A must-do Experience in Singapore,"Best views and wonderful evening experience when visiting Singapore. We booked a 2 hour window between 5-7pm and enjoyed not only the clear, late afternoon views - but also the night lights lighting up Singapore!"
Sundowner vibes,"A fabulous location on top of MBS, directly at the famous infinity pool. Food and drinks were reasonably priced on the special late afternoon sundowner menu. It was quite busy so I was glad we had reserved."
Grand Prix Sunday Lunch,"Stunning food, service and scenery. A must visit for lunch with friends or family. Highly recommend the black cod and sticky toffee pudding made better by fantastic service from Anil!"
Grand Prix Lunch,Had a delicious meal with amazing service by Anil. The black cod and sticky toffee pudding were to die for. Can‚Äôt miss out on the cocktail menu either!
Birthday celebration,"Once again a fantastic evening with excellent service, one of my Favorite Restaurants in Singapore, never tire of this place and the service."
Thank you 5/5,"Lovey experience , had a great bday complimentary gift. View not bad, just a pity was sitting behind a wall , but you can wander around inside to get a glimpse of the sunset behind the sg skyline"
First-rate everything!,"If you are looking for both local and western food to eat, this is the place to go. My family and I came here to have buffet breakfast during our MBS stay. The food quality and taste are faultless. Aside from the food on the buffet table, they have the ala carte buffet menu on the side to get fresh food. The food options are aplenty, from the well-known nasi lemak to the slurpy hor fun or the all western fave pancakes and eggs benedict. You name it, they might just have it. The place itself and the ambiance are fantastic. The interiors are relaxing, and gives you the feeling of being at home, only this home has the view of the infinity pool or the Gardens by the bay, depending which side of the lounge you'd like to be seated. Their assistant manager Mira, as well as few more staff served us that day, the customer service is impeccable and seamless. She has chatted and interacted well with guests without compromising professionalism. Hands down this is one of the best breakfast we've had in Singapore. Looking forward to eating a meal here again."
"My Favourite Restaurant in Singapore is non other than Spago..the food, the ambience, the service is impeccable","The food was delicious. The pasta is as good as Italian restaurant
The main course we all ordered different course but mine was so good
My friends love it so much and was trying to arrange another dinner to bring her family. The dessert was good too. They are generous with the portions so no one would feel hungry after leaving the Restaurant
The souffl√© pancakes is so so good.
Spago is still by far our top favourite restaurant and would highly recommend it to anyone.
My favourite Chef Greg..he always comes up with new creations food.
My husband tells all his patients about Spago. No wonder my breakfast and lunch celebrations is at Spago today"
"Excellent food, service and view",The food was excellent but the staff was even better. You can get a glimpse of the skill and effort they put on the dishes at the back and those shine once the plate is on your table. The servers and hostesses are very friendly and you can tell they are enjoying themselves while working there.
Bartenders superb but Kitchen Manager rude!,"I‚Äôm a frequent customer at Spago Bar & Lounge for 6 years, including during the restrictive Covid period. My experience has usually been very good particularly from the Bartenders, but with the recent change in GM I noticed an abrupt deterioration. I never subscribed to view customers are always right, but I was shocked and disappointed by the insult from George managing the kitchen who said to me ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come back!‚Äù after I spoke to some other customers at the bar. Let‚Äôs see what the management at Spago can do to win back my loyalty but until then I won‚Äôt be returning to be offended by George and I strongly recommend not to visit Spago"
Very courteous and attentive staff.,"Excellent cocktails and bar food! However, the choice on food menu was limited. Please consider reviewing the food menu."
Night out at Spago,"As always grea service, good bar food and drinks. Resv was limited to two hours which rushed us a bit. Was not given advance notice of this. My wife and I and friends have been here numerous times enjoying the view and ambience."
One of the best places for gathering and good meals,"Great ambience, delicious food and friendly staffs. Good with kids too. Staffs were also knowledgeable on food recommendations. Cocktail was awesome."
Late night for some drinks,"Not so easy to get a play here with some friends, since the bar is frequently booked. So better do it in advance...
But our hotel SANDs helped a lot. And service in Bar was great as well.
We hade some nice chats, nice drinks and a gorgeous night view on the town. - That is why it is so famous, and highly occupied..."
Perfect food and service!,"Very friendly services and awesome food! It is very spacious and windy. Most importantly, child friendly!"
The worst experience ever!,"We had a reservation for 6:30 pm on August 26th. We got there on time and seated behind the bar counter area but kindly moved to a lateral facing the infinity pool. 

We order an octopus salad that arrived in 15 min and two drinks which were never served to us or better they arrived after almost 45 min from the octopus that was cold and uneatable! 

When we asked to speak with the manager he told us that even if when we arrived there were few people still behind the wall there were very busy big tables. We decided to leave because this akward situation became unacceptable! Frankly for the price you pay both for drinks and food you should treat you guest much better! You should pumper them."
Excellent service !,Mei Yi and Rann made us feel special on friend‚Äôs birthday. They went out of their way to ensure we are comfortable.
"Great setting, mediocre service","We have here in the morning during 8 hour lay over at Singapore airport. They had a breakfast buffet and pancakes, Dim sum and other specialties to order for a set price of around 35Euros.
The breakfast quality is good but not great and the service sometimes a bit confused and slow. Overall worth mainly for the view and setting"
Great visit,Staff were amazing and so accommodating providing a very memorable visit of Spago in Singapore for the first time!
Dinner,"Fantastic experience üëè and good stuff, good food ,good place to chill and I considered cheaper than other. Very satisfied and highly recommended. üëå"
Husband's birthday gift,"Really pleased with the experience. The ambiance was amazing, the waiter who served us exceeded our expectations, and the cocktails were beyond delicious."
Nice place to chill,Food is good and cocktails too Try their rough love cocktail It‚Äôs quite a must to try Staff are nice and follow up regularly
A place truly fit for a cocktail connoisseur,"You will not be disappointed with the menu and the service here! If you get the Marina Bay Sands Reimagine package as part of your stay in the hotel, you get 4 mini appetizers and 2 drinks from their menu. The beef sliders and chicken karaage were delicious. We absolutely loved our server and she did an excellent job at recommending us drinks and dessert too!"
"Outstanding service, delicious cocktails and food","Amazing dinner with cocktails. But what is more important - service like nowhere else! Billy is a true asset as he was taking care of us through the night, while the manager Chigie was keeping an eye on us to make sure we are happy through out the night.
Bartenders are great and super accommodating, Jose, Christian and Fel showed our kids how they are cutting their perfect ice and did a little show of how to mix cocktails.
When you are greeted at the door from the very beginning by a welcoming smile of Geraldine, and after amazing dinner all the way to the friendly cashier Waynih, you understand that you will definitely come back as the place makes you feel like home :) Thank you, Spago Team!"
"Excellent Atmosphere, Service and Best Cocktails","Spago has a wonderful atmostphere, attentive staff with excellent service and the best cocktails in town. Our Mixologist was excellent and made our experience memorable as we sat at the bar."
Carol,"Excellent service, cocktails and atmosphere as always. Staff go above and beyond to make you feel welcome"

"Superb outing at Spago, makes you want to come back again the next day.",Every single member of the Spago team makes you feel you're their one and only VVVIP guest. From the hostess (named July) on the ground floor to the restaurant team members who go all out to make your visit memorable - you just want to come back again soon.

Family vacation / birthday of our daughters,The birthday surprise was lovely. The staff were friendly and the service was exceptional. Thank you!
Very nice experience,First time going to a bar lounge but it was a great experience with friendly staff with good food and drinks to boot. The price is also good for a bar that is on top of marina bay sands. Will cpme back again
Birthday celebration,"Didn‚Äôt realised there is a Spago dining room, and Lounge. Staff was accommodating to help us with a table after we sat and ordered drinks.

This visit was for my wife‚Äôs birthday celebration, and I am thankful to the staff for accommodating the change and table.

We enjoyed ourselves y the dinner. Service was good, food as well.

Thanks Spago!"
sunday afternoon lunch,"Service is great. Weekday lunch at the restaurant is far better as the menu is more extensive than at the bar & lounge area. I wasn't aware the restaurant was closed on Sunday. I ordered the tomato starter which is very good but portion is tiny - 3 cherry tomatoes + 1 small tomato, The mains portion was large though for me. Would have been better if the portions were more balance. Ambiance is nice - cool breeze and great view!"
My fave,"My absolute fave! As always, the staff are wonderful, food and cocktails are delicious. Special thanks to Reynan, Billie and Arlene!"
Amazing Staff and Service,The staff and service at Spago was absolutely incredible. They make you feel so welcomed. What an incredible experience. Can‚Äôt wait to be back and dining with them again.
Average,"The food served by Spago for infinity pool guests were average, at best. I have expected more from this establisment and was disapponted."
Excellent,We had a really lovely experience at Spago. Wine was excellent and the food bites were really good. Great Sushi & Sliders
Good restaurant with fabulous views,"We lunched there on our last day in Singapore as we had not been to the rooftop of Marina Bay Sands & wanted to see the view. We were told on booking that we would be allocated a table for 2hrs. This sounded to be sufficient time but in fact was not, as both entree & mains were slow to arrive, which meant we had to skip cheese, sweets & coffee - a bit disappointing as it was my friend‚Äôs birthday. She decided. to order a dessert anyway, but had to rush to eat it. Food was excellent & we would return, armed with the knowledge that we need to order immediately after being seated."
Drinks with family,"Amazing views, delicious cocktails, great music. The food was really tasty and the staff super friendly."
Good food n drinks,Well done dishes and good variety. Variety of drinks and wine was impressive. Dessert was particularly good
Spago Bar a must do if Singapore.,A fantastic location that is matched by friendly and attentive staff looking to make your experience memorable. The team behind the bar mix great drinks and present them uniquely. A must go to if you are traveling through or to Singapore.
Nice place with a great view,We were there to celebrate my son‚Äôs birthday. The food is nice and we got to change to a nicer pool view. Will visit again. Thanks
Amazing views from level 57 at Spago,"My family and I enjoyed some early evening delights at Spago, sharing a number of entrees whilst taking in spectacular views from level 57 of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.

"Spago, Bar Lounge Marina Bay Sands, 57th. Floor","Yummylicious Food, especially the Cod Fish, love it so much, ordered 2 plates, just need more options on the Menu for Children 1 - 5 yearsüòãü•∞"
Fabulous Dining Experience,"The eggplant appetizer was delicious and gluten free which for me is crucial. The main course I had - pork chops - was one of the best pork dishes I‚Äôve had in ages. And my friend had the quail which was heavenly ! All gluten free. Because it was my friend‚Äôs birthday, we were given a celebratory cocktail! Yum! Highly recommend!"
Great place,"Great place with nice views. Not really catered for vegetarians or vegans, but the staff went out of their way to prepare something. Even the French fries are fried with other meat items."
Amazing view and cocktails,"This is an amazing bar, just happens to be 57 floors high with unbelievable views as well. We had the Halo Halo dessert which was fresh and wonderful, plus some tasty cocktails. Service was very friendly too. A great spot to visit."
A wonderful evening with Business Partners,"Food was great! The beef tongue was my favourite and all the other food were nice. The drinks were great and the service was wonderful.
