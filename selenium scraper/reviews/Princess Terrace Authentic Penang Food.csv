Great Food,"We ordered the food for our company CNY gathering. The food was succulent and appetizing with good quality and huge quantity.

Everyone enjoyed it."
Ambience lessened by hurried closure,We came as a large family group. The food remained authentic Penang as we remembered and the lobster noodle soup was particularly good. The kitchen however seems to struggle and the chilly crayfish tray was not re-filled for a while and the prawns were not refilled. At 9.10 pm one of the waiter went around saying that the restaurant will be closed at 9.30 but no he is not asking us to leave. We are more used to being told that last order will be at 9.30/10.00 etc not that the restaurant will be closed.
Excellent service üëè,We had dinner at Tien Court Chinese Restaurant. The staffs was friendly & we felt being welcome to the restaurant . Service was excellent. Will recommend to friends or company events at Tien Court Restaurant.
Lovely Stay,"Friendly and efficient staff, lovely spread for breakfast and had an enjoyable stay!! Highly recommend"
Great wedding banquet service,"Joseph was our banquet manager for our wedding dinner. He was helpful and detailed throughout the process, and was pleasant to work with! Thank you Joseph for helping us hold a wonderful wedding of a lifetime!"
Please book with Discount for best Deal.,"We booked using eatigo app with 30% discount on Sat lunch. Timing is 12pm to 2.30pm. Price is $35 after discount. Nowadays it is up to individual to find the best dining discount deals at Princess Terrace. Restaurant was already crowded and full when we arrived at 12.15pm. Utensils are available next to coffee and tea machines. Staff was quick to remove used plates. Staff was warm and helpful.
The spread of food is pretty decent. The Penag Laska, Char Kway Teow, vinegar pork trotter, satay and prawns kueh pie tee were our favourite. We didnt have a chance to eat every dish! The desserts in cut size small portion is good bite with kaya jam spread. The kaya is a saver as the desserts aren't that appealing though. Do not expect cold seafood, that's not Penang cuisine."
dinner,"decent food quality but terrible service. was served warm water without asking if customer wanted warm water.

fast to clear plates but you have to replace your soiled cutleries yourself at the counter if needed.

supposed to have a credit card promotion but was not informed by the staff at the cashier counter. as a result they charged full price.

staff was defensive, saying that customer should ask if there was a promotion instead of them informing the customer because it was busy.

but there were no customers lining up to pay at that point of time.

however, the manager settled the issue already."
Price not worth the food,We paid 48 per pax and the food was not worth the price. I dont know what i was paying for. The only thing nice was the char kuey teow and the vinegar trotter. They don't cost 48 per pax for sure. The only thing good is the friendly service but the food is nothing worth the price. I dont suggest anyone to go there at all. Might as well eat in hawker with that kind of pricing you still have leftover for a good ice creamery.
Quiet n Cool atmoshere,"Place was inviting n quiet. Clean n neat. Service excellent without any waiting time. Staff friendly, warm n bubbly. Attended fast n efficient service. Comfortable n menu excellent."
Lunch Buffet @ Princess Terrace,"Food quality: delicious,
Staff: Very friendly, good service, very responsive
Live station: Food served hot."
Good selection of Penang Food,"Couldn't beat the actual Penang taste, but still considered better as compared to most Penang food in Singapore elsewhere.
Just a few good and bad points to highlight. Desserts ice kacang and chendol ice crystals were too large, prefer to be finer and softer. Fried kway teow and laksa smells good and tasty. Didn't manage to capture pictures as busy eating . But they were presentable same as display.
Service was prompt and responsive."
Princess terrace Lunch,"Hospitality is very good.
CNY goodie‚Äôs should include pineapple tart.
Curry chicken is ever that good.
Fried Kway teow is fragrant n good.
Cereal prawn served cold n batter already soft.
Loh bah is good, if remove the shell for prawn crackers even better, as the prawn is big prawn n has harder shell."
Wonderful spread of penang food,"Wanted to bring my wife who is a Malaysia to try food back home since she hasn't been back due to covid, and we were disappointed, wonderful spread and many variety to choose from, luckily we ordered just one portion of some dishes just to get a taste of everything and we're already full after 1 round and still left we some not tried. The kids love it and had a blast trying out different types of food esp the desserts. Service was top notch as well, and the staff was really pleasant and catering to our every needs. Overall a great experience and would come again!"
Quality and taste of food standard has dropped,"Used to frequent this place a lot.
After a long absence, went this Jan and found the food taste disappointing.
Esp the duck mee sua and pig stomach soup. It‚Äôs basically bland, water and salt‚Ä¶can‚Äôt taste anything else"
Princess Terrace Buffet,"Still serving their famed Penang buffet but a la carte style given the current circumstances. Standards are still upheld, and service is prompt and friendly. Would recommend."
Visit to Princess Terrace Cafe,"It was a good meal with a broad variety of foods, underlining the Peranakan culture with class and expertise."
Awesome dining experience,"I had the Penang butfet at Princess Terrace at Copthorne King's Hotel on at least four occasions in the past four weeks and I am still loving it! The Penang favorites, especially the nonya kueh and apom, was shiok! I liked the braised pork trotter with black vinegar and dried chilli lots too! Well done, Chef Lim and Team Princess Terrace!! Kudos also to frontline service staff (notably Michelle Ho, Susanti and A-ye), who were attentive, friendly and yet discreet. Christopher Ng was still very passionate about service after so many decades on the job! Keep it up, Princess Terrace!"
Value for money,Wide spread of buffet. Loved the live station - especially the char kway teow and ban cheng kueh. Great service.
Nice food!!!,Very nice food! Truly Penang taste! The staffs are so friendly and helpful! We can‚Äôt wait to be back! We are willing to recommend it to our family and friends.
Lost It's Lustre...,"Not the Best anymore.....sadly. The quality is not what it used to be. Blame it on Covid ??? Certain hot dishes were served cold. Really nothing to shout about now, not a single dish stands out.
Service Staff - 3 ladies were working hard, well done. Only bright sparks.
There was a guy in a white shirt and tie sitting at the bar counter. He saw us and another guest waiting to be served at the entrance, he did not bother to come to us. One of the chefs at the counter called to him, he then called one of the ladies to come to us, in an irritated way. He then disappeared. Was he the Manager ? If so, should he still be.....ha,ha.
The elder chef at the counter was not friendly too. Took our order in a cold manner, no smile. Seems unhappy doing his job. Seriously, not a welcoming place anymore.
Won't be back."
Pleasant experience,"Visited Princess Terrace on the 11th Dec 2021 for lunch.
Excellent service! All staff are nice and welcoming, especially Susanti. She is very friendly and attentive to us. Food are nice too but slightly on the saltier side. Overall experience is pleasant ! Thank u all staffs who attended to us !"
Will return again on my next trip.,One of the best Penang/Peranakan/Nyonya buffet in town. Highly recommended. Do try those dishes with funny romanized names that you won‚Äôt understand on first reading. They‚Äôre in fact traditional dishes written in local dialects.
Overall is still quite good,The Ark Thai Mee Suah standard has drop . The rest is still quite good just that the porridge is insufficient of salt . Overall I will still come here .
Great variety of foods and service excellent from servers,Had a really wonderful lunch experience with variety of foods choices. Staff are very polite and attentive. Foods are great and Big shout out to staff in particular Erni (if i spell correctly) of her excellent service. Will definitely come back and recommended this place!!
Mid week dinner buffet,"Service is great, food is okay. Make reservation with eatigo for discount. Best part is the dessert."
A True Penang Culinary Experience,"The food served was delicious and tasty! My wife and in-laws are from Malaysia, and they were impressed by the authenticity and quality of the dishes. Will be back for future meals!"
Good food good service,Food was great and value for money. Staff was friendly and prompt in their service when clearing and serving our food items. Thank you Princess Terrace for such a great family dinner!

The atmosphere is good, the layout of the tables is not so cramped and there are ample of space to walk.
The service are good as well.

So far, my family and I really enjoyed dinning here. We will come again."
Excellent service by all staff!,Excellent service by staff Qian Hui who is attentive and friendly throughout our meal! A gem in service line! Highly recommended!
Enjoyable Birthday Celebration,"Authentic Penang Cuisine. Our favourite dishes include Too Thor Thng, wok-fried porridge, fish otah-otah in banana leaf, stir fried sotong with petai, durian bang Chang kueh, teh-tarik, kueh pie tee."
"Great food, great service every time","It has been almost a year since our family visited Princess Terrace. We are still amazed by the wonderful Peranakan food and service in the restaurant each time we dine in. For decades, our family has visited this place and relive the sweet nostalgia during our time here. Thank you for giving us the beautiful memories."
Great First Experience,Service staff Ms Ria is extremely helpful and attentive. Buffet spread is good. Cosy ambiance. Good value for money with Eatigo promotion.
Service from the Heart,"Excellent service. Smiles, receptiveness, promptness and warmth. Food items were good with some misses. On the whole, it was a good overall experience!"
Peranakan Buffet,"The service was good, ambience is nice in the hotel. Staff was very helpful in serving dishes and other requirements! Even vegetarian friends can come visit if they don't mind the limited options, but the staff were still very helpful in providing things for us to eat!"
Princess Terrace Penang Buffet,Excellent fresh food. Well prepared and great warm service. Definitely will recommend to friends and family.
Penang buffet,Highly recommended as the food is one of the closest taste to the original. Dessert is a must to order!
Such a gem!,"Service was attentive and pleasant.
Food was good. Enjoyed the char kway teow, pork satay and assam pedas prawns particularly."
Good food and service,"Food was great. Loved the satay, belachan chicken wings and cakes. Responsive staff who are willing to assist. Recommended!"
Princess Terrace,We went for the buffet at Princess Terrace. The food was amazing - there was a wide selection of the usual favourites and all executed to a high standard. the service by the staff (especially Ria) was very impressive.
Princess Terrace Authentic Penang Food,"Friendly service, quality food, family setting. Miss Ria service is personable and consistent. Keep up the good work."
Great service but avg food,"Went with mum for buffet lunch to celebrate her birthday. Great service but food wise, average. Used 50% discount from Eatigo"
Awesome food and great service staff,"Delicious Penang food with more variety choise. Taste are always awesome to satisfy you with a Malaysian food craving. One of the service staff Qian Hui, she is very nice and friendly, introduction us how is the buffet flow and explain to us in the polite way. Keep it up"
Outstanding food and excellent service from friendly staff made it a memorable dinner!!,"Nice to be back to an old favourite of our family. Tonight, the food was outstanding! Now with live station again, the char kway teow had all the wok hei that you need!! The staff at the live counters are ever accommodating, allowing you to make special requests to have the dishes just the way you like them. More importantly, the warm and friendly service from Qian Hui, Ria and all the staff made it such a memorable dinner. Ambience was quiet, not rushed and felt very safe as the tables were sufficiently spread out for safe distancing purposes. Highly recommend and will be back again soon!!"
Nice buffet!,"Back here again for the buffet and even though there are restrictions due to Covid, the food quality remains good! Very good service from the restaurant staff too!"
Yummy food and fab service at Princess Terrace,"Service staff at Princess Terrace were friendly and attentive - you can eat with a peace of mind knowing that appropriate covid measure are in place. The Penang buffet did not lack options mouthwatering varieties ranging from popiah, assam laksa, char kway teow (has wokhey, YUMMY!), too thor tng, and desserts and kuehkuehs *drool*"
Nyonya Spread,The buffet is a spread and the taste of the food is really above expectations. Top notched service too. Thank you Ria and team for making this dining experience a wonderful one (:
Princess Terrace penang food,"The food is fantastic, a wide variety available and the service was great. The servers clear the plates quickly and were quick to respond to our needs."
Princess Terrace,Went for their Penang Cuisine buffet. Had one of my best dining experience. Sumptuous and warm food was served very quickly. We were served by a Ms Ria who was really helpful and thoughtful... Will definitely come back again. Highly recommended
Great food and service,Excellent service and food. Flawless service execution and great quality food. Char kway teow is a must try as well as assam prawn
Pleasant Experience,Food is delicious. Certainly will revisit next time. Hokkien mee broth is good. Price per person is reasonable
Authentic penang food,"As a penangite myself, I must say I really enjoyed princess terrace‚Äôs buffet offering.

Only minus I can think of it is that I wish there were more types of Penang food."
Princess Terrace Authentic Penang Cuisine,"I am Penangnite stuck in Singapore, and the food here is good enough for me. Authenticity of Penang food is great, and best of all the staffs here are very friendly and lovely."
Princess Terrace,"Ambience is nice and pleasant
Service staff is friendly and efficient
Food is not bad. With Eatigo 50%discount is definitely worth a visit
Overall an enjoyable dining experience"
Buffet lunch,"Excellent service. All staff are very cheerful and attentive.
Thanks you for well service and patient."
Lost its way,"This place used to be THE place for great Penang food. Today, it charges fifty dollars for unlimited servings of very ordinary food from a very limited menu which most hawkers can beat.
We fully understand the need to renovate the restaurant and put diners in a small ballroom. We appreciate the efforts of the friendly, hardworking staff. The hallmark of a decent Penang restaurant is a good bowl of Assam laksa but what we had was a huge watery letdown. So was the tiniest bowl of chee cheong fun and bland popiah.
I urge the restaurant to take the many feedback in TA seriously rather than give standard management responses to ‚Äúlook into the matter‚Äù and ‚Äúpass on the feedback‚Äù but nothing gets done.
We look forward to a time it finds its way and lives up to its past glory."
Review of visit,"Was disappointed that the original venue is having renovation so it was a makeshift small part of a ballroom. Not just that, the sound of drilling is audible though I went for dinner at 730pm. Some of the dishes are very nice and some are not up to my expectations. Bengawan Solo‚Äôs Nonya kueh taste much better. I realised when I compared the menu shown in Chope app and their menu. Some of the dishes are missing. The only consolation is the service of the staff are good and friendly."
A Once Reliable Venue Now A Huge Disappointment,"Being Penangites now localised in Singapore, childhood yesteryear Penang food cravings were always satiated by a trip here, and the wider family has been a strong supporter and proponent of Princess Terrace. The Penang community was close one before, and my mother knew the old GM Mr Yeoh from decades ago.

It‚Äôs clear the pandemic has hurled challenges on F&B establishment of the most intense sort, but we were heartbroken at the drastically plummeted standards this once grand old dame is now displaying when we visited this weekend. Firstly, the meal is hosted in the conference room next to Tien Court, with a substantially reduced menu prepared .. or so they say.. on an ala carte basis, with draws such as apom bokwa banished from the offering. The offering, excluding dessert, was barely 20 dishes in total.

We were served cold clammy fried chicken, and cereal,prawns, and old fried char kway teow with shriveled stringy bean sprouts clearly fried and left sitting a good while ago. We couldn‚Äôt eat any of that and sent these dishes back to the kitchen. The new plate of char kway teow that came was improved but the other two hot dishes continued to disappoint. The pie tee and popiah was distinctly void of any prawns at all, despite the description in the venue, which was a big difference from the normal buffet offering. Very basic, and far from Lux‚Ä¶. Other clear cost saving stinge-ing displays were .. no rose Apple or green mango for rojak, no condiments like achar, no tau hua beancurd even through it was a key item in the already drastically reduced dessert menu, Nonya kueh offering was reduced to a measly selection of 3. The chendol did not use fresh coconut milk, and came in A hardened ball of impenetrable ice (likely pre,prepared to save time rather than shaved to order), instead of the soft ice shavingGs it should have been. We had to leave that uneaten. The chicken for the chicken rice was hard and dry, and could not light a candle to your typical $3 hawker centre offering.

After patronising so frequently and so loyally for nearly a couple of decades, this fall from grace, and the disappointment in its execution and quality has had us painfully acknowledge that we will not be returning. And to charge $50 per person for that plummeting quality and decreased range of food borders on the outrageous. There was only one other table occupied when we arrived,.

Go to the Penang stall at ABC Food centre at Redhill for your next very basic Penang food crave.. you‚Äôll feel less disappointed that way."
"Nice food, great service","Food was good, particularly the chicken curry, hokkien mee, char kway teow, too thor tng... The place is not crowded, and service is really good. Would come again soon."
Closest to actually eating in Penang,"Closest to actually eating in Penang! Highly recommend the ter tor soup, Assam laksa, burbor Chacha, fruit rojak, lobster prawn noodle (broth was really fantastic).....vinegar pork...."
Princess Terrace Cafe,"The service is good especially provided by Ria. However, the food selections and quality is a mere shadow of the pre-Covid period."
"Good food, atmosphere but not comfortable with ala carte style","Understand due to covid, and buffet has to be in ala carte style. Not as enjoyable as before, and will return when the self service buffet style is back."
"Out of the way, but worth the effort","Covid has kept us home bound and missing our usual visits to our favourite food destinations - such as Penang and Bangkok. So when a friend suggested Princess Terrace, we gamely decided to drive over this usually neglected part of town (by us). Judging by the full house crowd, its very popular with many Penang food lovers.
While most of the dishes were authentic enough and we basically enjoyed what we ordered, there were a few that missed the bar by a wide mark, hence the four star rating. I thought it was a big fuss over nothing where the lobster mee hoon/noodle soup was concerned. My husband said he could give it a miss on our next visit. Next on the disappointing list was the Otah. Rather tasteless and bland piece wrapped in banana leaf. It promised possibilities when it arrived at the table but upon unwrapping the leaf, the otah inside was insipid. We picked the lok lok for sentimental reasons and it was nothing like what we remembered.
Service was very prompt and efficient although there was a slight mix up with a couple of our orders and we were served multiple orders of chicken satays. We obliged by eating them all. The fried kway teow was well done, with good fragrant wok hei. The popiah and kueh peiti were enjoyable, so were the fruit rojak. I really enjoyed the hot cheng tng dessert but found the kueh selection a huge disappointment. There was variety but zero quality."
Happy Eating,"All foods are nice, all staff are friendly especially Senon,. We will go again. Thank you everyone there."
Princess Terrace Penang Cuisine,"Great selection of penang cuisine, overall satisfied & will be back again! Thumbs up for sure & was a great experience!"
Fantastic Service and Food!!!,It's my third time come at this restaurant...The food still very fantastic and excellent special chef Lim still are very friendly and kindly...The Server Vason and Justin are very helpful and take the ambience.. This is my favorite and best restaurant always!!
Penang Fantastic,Food are delicious up to the high-end standard.Staff service are friendly and attentive.kudos to Justin and Vansan who take good care of us very well. Thumbs up to Chef Lim and the service team who provide the great experience and memories.
Mr Tan's family dinner after COVID,"I called the restaurant but was directed to the operator line. Operator ladies, nana & jaye were patience and friendly to answer our questions. They are much more better than 5 star hotel operator. Though we have not been here since COVID, the foods still maintain. Char kway teow is good and tastes the best. But the lobster hokkien mee was kind of disappointing as the lobster is overcooked and hard to chew. Overall we had a great dinner and served by the friendly staff. We will be back again."
Ms June,Overall good service. Friendly staff. Good ambience. Change dirty plates regularly during buffet. Food average. Chair had crumbs.
Good and authentic Penang,"Good and authentic Penang food. We enjoyed the food. Must try the prawn mee.
The staffs are very friendly and make you feels great."
A wonderful meal during covid days,"I am impressed with their safe distancing measures while maintaining their food standard. Food is through ordering while some over the counter. Very orderly and systematic. Their food is still yummy and delicious.
I want to commend their service. The manager and staff are so busy and yet they provide the highest standard of service making sure we are served well. They are happy and service with a smile.

Thumbs up to all the Managers and staff. You have done well!"
Super awesome Penang alacarte buffet lunch,"Our first time visit. Totally enjoyed the experience. All the food was super awesome- Penang CKT, Maine Lobster Hokkien Mee, rojak, kueh kueh, chendol... all very tasty, nice portioning. But most of all, the service guys were v accommodating and attentive (we had a noisy little girl w us). Thank you Derrick n team"
My experience at the cafe,"menus and food quality were excellent, service rendered was good with friendly service crew. Will definitely visit again and also highly recommend."
Delicious Authentic Penang Food,"Being a Penangite, I would say that the Char Koay Teow are extremely delicious. Love the pie tee, otah and assam prawns. The Penang Hokkien Mee soup is really taste like the authentic Penang Hokkien Mee. Will definitely bring my parents back there again as they were longing for Penang Food"
very quiet during afternoon tea time,"I believe they used to do buffet line for afternoon tea, but not anymore. Now it's a fixed 3-tier tiffin carrier set of food like siew pau, kaya toasts & nonya kueh with an order of a main course (hokkien prawn mee, assam laksa, char kway tiao etc) and free flow teh tarik. Food wise is definitely good, and although the ""type"" of food isn't exactly the kind you'll feel to be worth the premium price (you can always find good char kway tiao, kaya toasts and nonya kuehs at hawker centres at literally a fraction of the price) the huge portion size and quiet and cosy ambience does make up for it. Do note that there will be TWO servings of each food inside EACH tiffin set, so if you're not a huge eater, it's better to get 1 full set plus an ala carte of main course/beverage to share instead.
Disclaimer: We visited using 40% off with eatigo promo, so it was an amazing deal for us."
Good Variety & Quality of Foof,"We had our family lunch here with my parents and the kids, as we have been doing so over the years as Princess Terrace is probably one of the best Restaurant offering Penang fare. Always a delightful meal, enjoyed by the older folks as well as the kids. Do make a reservation in advanced and ask for ongoing promotions! We love the Char Kuey Teow, Laksa and array of kuehs!"
Automatic Egg Maker Sunny Side up & Omelette,Made an omelette with onions and tomato to my taste with the automatic egg maker; the best part being its freshly made. It even knew how to pat pat the omelette before serving it.
The cafe not the buffet,"The cafe offered a small range of meals for those not wanting a buffet meal in the main restaurant although I'm told that it serves a very good Penang buffet,but we ate ate the cafe reasonable priced meals and the staff member was very friendly and helpful with great service"
Annual visit,"We have been celebrating my Mum‚Äôs birthday here every year for the last 7 - 8 years as she enjoys the Penang food buffet. It was her 83rd birthday yesterday and our party of six again enjoyed the wide selection, delicious food and friendly service. Judging by the number of diners yesterday, this place is still going strong!"
Satisfy your craving for Penang cuisines!,"There is a good spread of the typical Penang dishes and cuisines, including assam laksa, pig's trotter cooked in black vinegar, mee sua soup with duck drumstick, pig's stomach soup with pepper, popiah, and kwei pie tee. These items are prepared in the hot kitchen and served in individual portions to diners.

The self service counters offer many other salivating options, including mee goreng, fried kway teow, and foo yong egg with crab meat. There is also a salad spread and a self-service station for rojak mixing. For the savoury dishes, my only wish was for the tau kwa (fried bean curd) and nasi ulam (rice cooked with various spices) to be served heated/warm/fried.

For desserts, I had fun mixing my own ice kachang, which brought me back to my childhood days of eating ice balls. The kueh kuehs were served in delicate portions, which is great because I get to sample a wide variety without over-eating or feeling guilty!

I was there with a friend on a Monday afternoon, and practically all the tables available were occupied. According to my friend, whose mother is from Penang, this buffet is well-known and has been established for decades. There were several large groups of diners who were there to enjoy good food and more importantly, to catch up with one another. They look like retirees and it was heartwarming to see friendships being strengthened and perpetuated over people's mutual love for food! Given the popularity of the place, my advice is to always make a reservation before hand, even if you intend to visit on a weekday.

The price per person is rather high, and especially for children (at half price). My suggestion is to check out different food and restaurant apps for promotions and discounts. For example, one app offers a 40% discount at 12 noon when the buffet opens, and a 50% discount if reservations are for 1 pm! That will give you approximately 1.5 hours to sample the different cuisines before the food stations are closed, which is still a fantastic deal!"
Excellent spread,As usual the spread was good and taste very authentic. The black vinegar pig trotter and pig stomach soup was excellent as usual.
Best place for Penang Buffet,"Took some friends who were visiting to The Princess Terrace Cafe for lunch. Good place for visitors to try a variety of Southeast Asian food. My favorite is their char kway teow, duck noodles, chicken wing and small pancake with banana sauce. The decor is bit worn but so far the food has been consistent. Staff was very accommodating as well. Found a discount on Fave which made it extra nice!"
Lovely food,"Had a peranakan buffet with friends, food was amazing and the choices were plenty. There was a robotic egg chef called Auscar that was very entertaining. It cooked omelette and sunny side up, amazing to watch him in action. Staff were friendly and efficient.Highly recommend."
penang buffet,"wonderful penang food. I been here three times so far. Love their char kway teow, mee goreng, chicken curry and braised pork belly. Service is decent too."
Penang Buffet in Singapore,"The meal got off to a rocky start due to confusion at the reception. I had made a booking and later needed to amend. As I was unable to amend the booking on the app, (1) my sister called to make a separate booking independently without my knowledge(2) I had to cancel my original booking and make a new one both done on the Chope app.We ended up with 3 tables reserved for us because (1) my sister was unable to call through to cancel her booking and no one got back to her after she left a message.(2) the restaurant mistakenly saw my cancelled booking as a fresh booking and set aside a table for that as well.On top of that, the table which was to have been for us had been given away and staff then had to scramble to look for another table. This took a while to sort out and thankfully after that was done, the meal was able to proceed.The food was good and the variety wide enough. I normally enjoy the Penang rojak, the Penang laksa and the kway teow thng. The satay was good as usual, as were the nonya kueh. I've always liked the tau huay as well. The acar was a bit more sour than usual though. Unfortunately, I was too full to be able to sample everything but managed to round off the meal with self-assembled Penang chendol.The wait staff were kept busy by the Saturday lunch crowd but were eager when called upon. All in all, it was a leisurely afternoon lunch."
"Standard dropped significantly. Cold food, bad quality - comments from a loyal fan","We have been visiting cafe princess for a number of years and always looked forward to the good Penang food when we visit with the family. Our last visit was in 2017.

We visited again on 16/1/19 and was so disappointed with the food served that I actually did not feel like paying for the dinner. My first stop was at the kueh pie tee and poh piah station and it was the worst that I have tasted anywhere in Singapore. There was no prawn to top the pie tee and the poh piah did not have any fried garlic. The filling was also lukewarm.

It was downhill from then on. The prawn noodle was mediocre- the prawn was tasteless. They ran out of otah at 8.15 pm and there was no refill for the rest of the evening. The soup was very mediocre and the other food was lukewarm. And they served breakfast stuff like Chee Cheong fun and yam cake (the Cheong fun was left in a steamer that wasn‚Äôt turned on. I had to turn in on!)

I did not bother to eat any other of the entrees served but my other family members were as disappointed as I was. We asked the manager why the fare was so disappointing and he said that the chef hasnt changed. Well, we can tell difference and it is worse than any hawker fare.

The management is clearly unaware of the standard of the food. My friends have told me of the drop in standard in the last year and I can now confirm that this will be my last visit until someone tells me that it is good again.

I hope the cafe can review the quality of the food and the service standard. It‚Äôs such a shame to lose its reputation that has taken more than 15 years to build."
Most pathetic high tea ever,"This is the most disappointing high tea i ever had. Firstly, the manager who attended to us upon arrival had an attitude and was not welcoming at all. We were ushered to the tables that were along the walkway where the hotel guests have to pass through with their luggage. And our table was just outside the toilet. Why were we given such treatment when all other tables in the proper cafe area were empty and they had closed off the section?

As for the spread, you can forget about it. You can get better spread at a hawker centre. There was fried kway teow, but it tastes burnt. There were no cakes or pastry but some pieces of sandwich and nonya kueh. They also served the leftovers from Christmas - a mouldy looking Christmas stollen. Other than that, there were laksa and prawn noodles, served by a rude and disgruntled staff!

This was the worst high tea experience ever, and will certainly not return !"
Last reservation time,The last reservation time shouldn‚Äôt be 1.30pm as the buffet closes at 2.30 pm. Not quite enough time to enjoy the spread.
"Princess Terrace, the place to go for local Penang food",The many visits to Princess Terrace never made me tired of it. The wide spread of Peranakan kueh kueh and Penang delicacies are the reasons why I am always back to this place for more. Just love the kuey teow soup and hokkien prawn noodles. Super delicious.
Farewell Lunch,Standard of food has not been as before. Selection of food has remained the same despite the increase of price. Only appealed to past customers. A bit hard to attract millennials if no changes made.
Penang food galore! Yummy and plentiful!,"Rule of thumb for buffet...variety. This buffet has all the street food u can think of,...and then some!
Rule of thumb of an enjoyable dinner...yuuminess! The signature noodles (fried or soup) are all very good. The curries n otah are spicy enough to challenge the mild tongue.
There are some misses (small dim sum..yam cake, Chee cheong fun...thumbs down).
And to cap off an evening of good conversation....the dessert selection! And not overly sweet nonya kueh-kueh that suit me perfectly!
I‚Äôll be back for more goodness!"
Queuing @ Nonya Buffet Lunch,"Joined a family lunch at this place and it is my first time visit and what an experience! The buffet was very popular and therefore super crowded. What a mess. I had to queue and wait to order and collect some poh piah and kueh pie tee while others did not - totally no system and control at all - that why I decided to stand there and wait for my order to be served and self collect (training in patience) LOL.

Satay is always sold old. Got to wait. Queue for prawn mee, tau-hway. There was also chee cheong fun, curry chicken, prawns, mee goreng, rojak, fried stuff, a wide range of nonya kuehs, pan cakes, penang chendol, teh tarik etc. Food is average but perhaps its because its buffet style. If we want to eat nice nonya food, I would go elsewhere, or even take a drive up to Melaka for an outing. Still, it was an experience to try out this place. Won't be coming back any time soon"
Wonderful penang laksa,"Been to this wonderful restaurant at lunch time at least 3 times over the years. Great choice of food and great variety, but not overwhelming in quantity. Especially loved the satay and desserts. Great location to meet up and chat with friends and family."
Irresistible authentic Penang cuisine.,"Princess Terrace Caf√©. Located at 403 Havelock Road Copthorne King's Hotel, Lobby Level. This is the only buffet place you can enjoy your favourites Penang / Nonya cuisine to your heart‚Äôs content without any waiting people or distracting noise from large groups of diners. Princess Terrace Cafe is the ideal place for family and friends to come together over delicious buffet meals. Offering a tempting authentic Penang cuisine such as Rojak, char keow teow, kueh pie tie and Laksa (Penang style) and with a variety of yummy desserts such as Nonya kueh, soy bean curd, and bobo cha-cha. It‚Äôs a casual, family-friendly feel. About the Service and atmosphere also get really high marks! Staff are very professional the service is friendly, and excellent.
Overall, a decent Penang style buffet at relatively affordable prices."
Enjoyed the buffet breakfasts,"We were staying in the hotel and the buffet breakfast was included in the tariff. We enjoyed the variety of Asian and European dishes on offer although at times had to wait for dishes to be replenished. Egg station was excellent. The breakfast is totally self serve, from tea/coffee to juices and all other selections. Sometimes we were escorted to our table and a 'Reserved' sign placed thereon. Other times we had to find table space and then one of us sat guard while the other made their selections. Clearance of used crockery and cutlery was hit and miss. We were satisfied overall . Now dinner is another matter, if you are partaking of the Penang Buffet you are escorted to a table and again left to your own devices. If you want 'a la carte', then, good luck. You will be escorted to a table and then have to wait for some time to receive the menu. Drinks and meal service took an age; it just seemed that all hands concentrated on the buffet. Our only dinner in the restaurant was enjoyed but the service was appalling."
Good food,Good spread and very authentic taste. Simply love the food! My friends also enjoyed the food very much. Will surely return again.
FOOD IS DELICIOUS,Food is delicious especially the Prawn Noodle. But the staff manning the Popiah & Kueh Pie Tee counter needs to be motivated. His face is so unwelcoming. I will usually skip this counter because I don't have appetite seeing the chef serving so unwillingly. I went there thrice and similar experience with the Popiah counter chef. Sad though !.
Lousy Buffet,"Went for the high tea buffet with family just the past weekend and it was so lousy, no proper ""main courses"" and very limited food items, about 10 and mostly kueh pastry and sandwiches. The live cooking stations were serving prawn noodles and laksa, also with the wrapped spring rolls (popiah), were just so so, although not many diners but still had to wait as service was slow and staff were not friendly. (maybe they had to longer beyond the earlier lunch session and unhappy)

Paid for almost $90 for 4 and totally not value for money! And we left after 30 mins later because nothing to eat! Will not come again."
Disappointing and Terrible~,"The cafe is well known for it's Penang Buffet and have visited previously for the lunch and dinner buffet and overall was still satisfying. (I have written reviews about them in other forums but not here then)

We learned only recently that the cafe also offer a high tea buffet on weekends and so decided to try it, thinking that it's new and should be quite good and comparable to it's lunch and dinner, with slightly fewer food items. We were totally wrong and utterly disappointed as we were anticipating it to be quite ok.

We arrived at about 2.45pm (high tea buffet starts at 3pm to 5pm) and were ushered to a table just next to the counter where a number of lunch buffet diners were still eating. Initially, we wanted to sit in the inner part of the main cafe (tables with sofa seats as we have elderly senior citizen and thought it might be more comfortable for her) but were ""rejected"" because that section of the cafe is to be ""closed"" and not opened. Ok fine. But the stupid thing was that they rather let diners sat along the walk-way (corridor leading to the 2 lifts) and at the other side of the main lobby, the dinning section while 90% of the main cafe area was empty. It was so bad where diners lack of privacy with in-house guests moving in and out of the lifts through the walkway to go to/from the main entrance. It was later when we realized that the so called ""closed"" section was reserved for their staff to ""eat and relax"" when we saw one of its managers eating his meal and then a chef sitting there to relax. Of course, also understand why it was closed because staff need not walk too much and too far in to clear the plates! (bad service and brainless planning).

And by just sitting next to the counter, you could imagine the noises, like phone ringing, staff answering, diners coming in and queuing to foot the bills and even chefs also went up there to ""chit chat"" with the cashiers/captains from time to time. Cannot even have a good ""peace of mind"" to enjoy food and chit chat!

As mentioned earlier, we sat at the table at around 2.50pm. At 3pm, no one came to inform us that the buffet had started, until we saw other diners moving forward to get the food! Most other cafes/restaurants would do so especially if they let the diners in early. And we also saw some of the lunch diners eating food from the high tea session and it was only about 20~25 mins into the session, the staff then started to request these diners to take their leave. (but they did inform us about 10 mins before the close of the buffet to get more food but what was there for us to take?).

Next, on the food. What you see from my pictures here were almost all the food offered at this so called high tea buffet. Spread was pathetic and very limited (in total, no more than 10 items) and I could recall all the items, chay kueh teow, laksa, popiah, spring rolls, prawn noodles, fried carrot cake, glutinous rice, sanwiches, 4 pathetically mini small size nonya kuehs, green bean soup, bobo charchar, black glutinous rice, cut fruits, coffee and tea. That's all.

Among all, only the chay kueh teow (not sure if it's local or Penang version, no cockles but not here or there) and prawn noodle soup were just passable, others were like not at all nice, either too bland and mushy (fried carrot cake), hard popiah skin with overcooked ingredients, making it too wet. Coffee was bitter and Teh Tarik was too sweet.

We were quite surprised and shocked to learn that a 4/5 star hotel high tea buffet spread was just like that!!! Then we saw diners started leaving after about 30 mins into the session. My goodness! I will talk about the price later.

Ambience was overall nice, with vintage with the nostalgic feeling. Some items looked old fashioned and aged, but it's still ok. No complaint on that.

Service. Servers (not the main staff who ushered us in) were quite efficient in clearing used plates and were polite. Some of the chefs, including quite an aged lady, were manning the popiah and prawn noodles booth, were quite slow and queue was formed up waiting. I am not being bias against elderly workers and always respect their independence, contribution and experience in their work but they should be assisted by younger chefs especially when ""you know there is a queue of diners waiting for the food and especially with a very limited spread of items, people will naturally with no other choices but to eat the same kind of food again) to fasten the cooking/preparation process.

Also they seemed impatient with expressionless face, and projected an ""unwelcoming"" image. Are we at a Prison cell, queuing for food?

Now, value for money! Totally not worth it. We paid almost $22 per pax just for this limited spread high tea buffet! Will you? Comparing to it's lunch or dinner buffet, well, you can give it a miss, and rather and better to have your meals at McDonalds, KFC or even at a food court.

Recently (just 2 weeks ago) we dined at the Marriott Cafe for high tea too, the spread there was like 20~30 times more (which we could not even try all the food), with seafood, sushi and salmon, hainanese chicken rice, bak kut teh, satay, laksa, curry chicken, nasi lemak, just to name a few, at about $28 per pax! And though there were also some ""hits and misses"" of the food, would say most of food there were nice and yummy. (Please refer to my review of the Marriott Cafe here too, the immediate recent review just before this Princess Terrace Cafe revjew)

With just a $6 difference, diners could enjoy so many other kinds of food, though mostly are local iconic street food with a wide range of pastries and cakes. Trully worthwhile and great value for money and some more ""Marriott"" experience!

Also I also remembered, some time ago, we visited another hotel's cafe in bugis/little india area, that offered similar spread of food items like this Princess Terrace Cafe, with the buffet price of just about $12 per pax (including tax and service charge). We didn't really ""dare"" to complain about that since the price was so cheap and what could you have asked for!

Having said that, it's totally not worth coming for this high tea or diner will be greatly disappointed and felt terrible. Is this the Copthrone standard?

This is the worst high tea buffet we have had not only in Singapore and also in our ""walk around the world"" (or even in Penang). Somehow other cafes/hotels around the area, like next door Mirammar, Furama Riverfront, Holiday Inn Atrium, the other Copthrone Waterfront (opposite the street) with Four Points by Sheraton, we have all visited, where they offer a reasonably good buffet spread and none was rated as poorly as this! Or even the former Gallery Hotel (now becoming Hotel Intercontinental service apartment) or Novotal, Swissotel Merchant Court, Park Hotel Clarke Quay, Furama City Center etc, were all much much better. Prices were also within the same range but the spread was more extensive and food tastier.

As you can see from all my reviews, it's very very rare and uncommon for me to give an establishment a below 3-star, not to mention 2-star rating, regardless of hotels, cafes, restaurants or places of attractions visited because I trust there will be areas that operators do well despite of having shortcomings.

But this place, in particular, the high tea buffet truthfully deserved a 2-star or lower rating. Saving it, is only the ambience and partly is its' Copthrone brand name and since I could not give a 0.5 star, I have no choice but to give 2-star though I felt it's more likely to be a 1.5 star rating.

One last thing. And I think only this hotel ""proudly"" does it. There is no sofa or seat in the main hotel lobby area for guests and you will have to stand to wait be it for the buffet to start, waiting for check in our check out or for tour/transport pickup (unless you go over to the dinning section or cafe with tables and chairs). Really ""amazing and eye-opening"" sight!

Will not return to this hotel in the near future and not even for it's lunch or dinner buffet as there are ""on par, if not better"" similar buffet in town!"
