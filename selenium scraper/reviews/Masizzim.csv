Wonderful experience,Had a wonderful experience at Masizzim last week. Had the bulgogi and their beef stew. The stew was absolutely filled with flavors and I couldn't help but had to get a second portion of it. Ambience and service was really good as well!
Dining at Masizzim,"Have ordered the pork rib stew to go along with the Bimbimbap for a lunch meetup with my friend. The pork rib portions were really generous and the meat was fresh
and succulent. Had a really full and nutritious meal there as the broth was rich and spicy. Definitely a good place for a quick lunch meetup with friends. 10/10 :)"
delicious egg roll,"had a lovely dining experience at masizzim, the beef stew went well with the rice and the kimchi egg roll was very fluffy and the egg and kimchi were paired well together. amazing experience, would visit again"
Dining at Masizzim,"Easily a 9/10. Purchased the Daebak Bundle for 29.90, with beef stew and toppoki add on for $2 each. Food portions are generous for the price! Needless to say, the food is delicious and has left me craving for more."
good food cosy atmosphere,"had a lovely dining experience at masizzim last week! ordered the beef stew, which came with plenty of meat and other ingredients. my only regret is that I did not get it with rice, which would have gone so well with the soup :-("
Yummy in my tummy,"Delicious meal with a wide variety of choices. Ordered a few dishes to try out the variety, and enjoyed it üëçüèΩ wish there were more side dishes for a more authentic experience!"
Egg Rollsssss,Was a very good meal with great dishes. Loved the egg roll! üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ Would be perfect if there were more side dishes tho! Overall still a great meal üëçüèΩ
Generous portion!,"The service was prompt and efficient, and the food ordered ( main dishes as egg with kimchi and bacon as well as beef stew ) was pretty good as well. The egg was fluffy and so delicious! Ended the dinner with dessert, it was a jelly base with various toppings that were quite light and refreshing to have. Thumbs up for the cute container as well!!"
Delicious Korean Fare,"We ordered an array of dishes that left us extremely satisfied, and the highlights of the meal were definitely the crabmeat rice balls and the pork rib stew! The rice balls were full of umami saltiness. The pork ribs were so deliciously tender and was elevated by the rich and slightly spicy broth. Be sure to pair the stew with a bowl of rice!"
Great tasting korean food with nice decor,"Had a wonderful dinner here a few nights back. Ordered their kimchi fried rice alongside spicy pork and both dishes tasted great together! Food was slightly on the pricier side but the food, lighting and decor made it a pleasant experience."
Great service and delicious food!,"Service was great, loved their spicy pork dish (wasn‚Äôt too spicy). The squid and leek pancake was really crispy and the dipping sauce really brought out the flavours of the dish!"
Enjoyable meal !,"I love Korean food and always enjoy a good recommendation. I went to Masizzim @ 313 Somerset for dinner. The spicy pork ribs was the star and we literally scraped the bottom of the bowl. The gravy went well with the crab meat rice balls .
We also ordered the beef soup and steamed egg which were also tasty but my vote is the spicy pork ! I‚Äôll be back !"
good option for korean food!,"ordered a few items and enjoyed most of it! my favourite is the crabmeat egg roll which they were generous with their crabmeat! the egg was soft and fluffy, well seasoned (not salty) which allowed the natural sweetness of the crab meat to come through!!!

special mentions would be the corn pancake and the crabmeat & roe rice ball (yea i love crab, would get crab pancake if they had it on their menu)

corn pancake had a nice crisp, was thick enough and the sour cream went super well with it! recommended to share amongst 3-4 pax so to not over eat (if it's a side dish). if you're eating it as a main then...it's good to share with 1 other person.

crabmeat & roe riceball was fun to ball it up!! love the kick of the chilli padi that accentuated the whole combination of the ingredients.

all in all, pleasant experience!"
A filling and hearty meal,"My favourite was the corn pancake ‚Äî it was so crispy and flavourful! The soy pork rib stew was slightly too salty but generous in size. Crabmeat egg roll was delicious, but the crabmeat & roe riceball felt quite mediocre."
AWESOME FANTASTIC AND FABULOUS,i feel that the atmosphere is feeling good and make me happy and i would come back here again with more of my friends and family members and i would brong my kooreans friends here not even korean friend i would bring japan thailand or even malaysian friends
good meal!,"was treated to a good meal at Masizzim! ordered the highly-raved rice balls with crab meat, steamed egg with cheese, beef stew and the kimchi fried rice ‚Äî everything was incredibly delicious & pleasant! would highly recommend to those looking for authentic korean food"
satisfying meal !,"had a really great meal at masizzim! kimchi fried rice was yummy and the beef stew was hearty w fork tender beef pieces. egg with cheese was simple and light. especially loved the crab and prawn roe rice balls, which we got the opportunity to roll them ourselves. would come back agn!"
recommended,ate 3 dishes and the crabmeat riceball was the most delicious! do try it out :-) overall the food also came really quickly and waiting time to enter the restaurant was acceptable. no complains!
belly filled,"We ordered the crabmeat riceball, chicken stew as well as the bacon kimchi egg roll. Amongst which, we were most impressed by the crabmeat riceball - especially the subtle yet intense kick induced by the chilli padi in it! However, the egg roll could be improved as it was quite dense."
Amazing dining experience!,"This place is my new favourite! High quality and affordable Korean eats! It‚Äôs my first time trying Korean rice balls and it was an amazing first try here at Masizzim!! I had the crabmeat and roe rice balls, spicy pork rice balls, tomato cheese kimchi pancake (a definite must-try, it tasted like kimchi pizza!), spicy squid and kimchi soup! Everything was beyond my expectations‚Ä¶ Will definitely be back again!"
Hearty Korean Food!,"Went there after work and it's a cosy spot, great for catching up and hearty food. We got the pork ribs stew, egg roll, rice balls and some honey ginger tea. Filling and tasty:) great service too."
Good Korean food,Super delicious Korean food. The steam egg with cheese was perfect for me and the pork rib stew was very good. Great place to chill and catch up with friends. Will definitely be back to try the other dishes.
Wonderful Dining Experience,"Visited Masizzim@313 Somerset after a long day of work. The Spicy Pork Rice Ball was simply outstanding as the meat is super tender, coupled with the experience of rolling rice balls. The plate of Spicy Squid was a perfect complement to the Spicy Pork Rice Ball due to the sauciness and crunchiness of the squid. Finally, the Spicy Pork Kimchi Soup serves as a refreshing dish to pair with the dishes mentioned above. Wonderful dining experience in general and will come back again!"
Great food and place,"Dining experience was great. My favorite dish is the cheese kimchi fried rice, the steam egg was really good too, great place to hang out and will definitely come back again"
Great rice balls,"Had the Crabmeat and Roe Rice Ball, as well as the Pork Rib Stew. The crabmeat and roe in the rice ball dish was very well seasoned, and were tasty enough that I would highly recommend this dish (and won't mind coming back for more!). Pork Rib Stew was also rich and flavourful. I particularly liked the rice cakes in the stew, which were really chewy! Highly recommend this place!"
"Great experience, food and ambience","The food and ambience was great. I truly enjoyed the Kimchi tuna riceball. It was an experience to roll them into cute shapes and taste the mixture of flavours from it. I would also recommend the spicy chicken stew and go for it again. The portion was huge and they were generous with their tender chicken pieces. The food was delicious and great!
The place also had the really chill and cool atmostphere

Would definitely return. :)"
great korean food !!,"came here for date night because i was craving for great korean food and i wasn't disappointed !! my partner ordered the beef stew and even though i wasn't a fan of spicy food, i still couldn't resist stealing bits and pieces from him because it was that delicious HAHA for myself, i ordered the beef bulgogi and it was such a generous serving. the meat was tender and the sauce was so savoury. we finished off with a melon yogurt drink which was the right amount of sweet :)) even though the place was crowded when we were there, the staff provided really good service to us too"
Lunch date,"The highlight of the food is the beef stew! The sauce was tasty and the meat was really tender.

The meat patty is huge and flavourful. I would recommend to share within 3 pax.

The highlight of dessert would definitely be the larger than palm size mango mochi. Super soft and having lots of mango in it. Good to have it after a meaty meal."
Dinner Date,"The food was great! I like the stew very much even though it's a bit too salty but the meat was so so tender! Great addition to rice though! The mochi is a must-try! Super big and yummy!

I came here on a Thursday evening around 4.30pm, so it was pretty empty. Tbh, the portions were really great - highly recommend"
Korean Food,"Came here after work with my girlfriend for dinner. We ordered the beef stew, beef bulgogi and an ice blended yogurt drink. I personally found the beef stew to be very flavourful and the ice blended yogurt drink to be very refreshing. The service staff also provided good service to us by being quick to respond to us. Overall a pleasant experience!"
Korean Food,"Good vibes and atmosphere. Great place to come by after a day of work. We ordered the riceball crabmeat which was super delicious!

The spicy pork was good as well, it‚Äôs not that spicy, but I can still feel the spice and it is tasty!

The Tteokgalbi was magnificent, had a great time consuming it"
Will come again!,"Ordered crabmeat & roe riceballs, spicy pork and tteokgalbi! The riceballs had good flavour and were fun to make for the experience! Tteokgalbi was really nice too with the slightly burnt crust adding a good crunch to the juicy meat ü§§"
Masizzim Food Review,"Really enjoyed our dinner at Masizzim where we ordered a variety of dishes including the honey mustard cheese egg roll which was both a good appetizer and match well with the heavier tasting food such as the chicken stew (level 3 spiciness) which was also extremely delicious with a good match of spice and savoury intensity, and the chicken was also very tender. We also ordered the spicy squid and taste really great too! Lastly, the kimchi fried rice was also unique as it was served in a hot metal pot as shown and the generous portion of seaweed ingredient also elevated the umami taste as well. Generally portion was also rather large and thus definitely a filling meal :D"
Korean Feast @ Masizzim,"Literally one of the best korean food I‚Äôve had! Its not super korean-ish, I can feel a slight fusion in their dishes - like a mix of korean and local flavours as the tastes were not very foreign. Top faves is the spicy chicken stew (level 3 spicy) and it had these chewy flat glass noodles which were doused in sauce and was so good! Plenty of chicken meat which was not tough and super flavourful! Another fave was the honey mustard cheese egg roll which is so good! Feel with cheese and a savoury sweet mustard sauce that was not surfeiting at all! Spicy squid and the kimchi fried rice was deffo good too and was a good portion size as well! Deffo highly recco to try! :)"
Authentic Korean Restaurant with Interesting Dishes!,"Visited this restaurant on a Thursday night and it was pretty packed so I highly recommend you make a reservation beforehand!

Ordered a few of their recommended dishes. Their beef rib stew had a broth which was incredibly rich in flavour and the beef was also cooked long enough such that it was tender and not too chewy. Also tried their Crabmeat and Tobiko riceball which was really interesting in the sense that you are provided disposable gloves and get to mix and shape the riceball yourself - a really fun and tasty experience! Their squid and leek pancake was also crispy and goes really well with the sauce provided - or even to dip in the stew to make for a delicious combination. Also ordered the Alcoholic Grapefruit Yoghurt (with Soju) which was really refreshing and not too sweet - a great way to end the meal! :)"
Tasty Korean restaurant in the City,Would definitely recommend their crab meat and tobiko rice ball which was sweet and savoury. Making the rice balls with the gloves they provided was also a unique and fun experience. Their beef stew is also delicious - thick and full of beefy goodness
Korean Rice Balls and Beef Stew!,"finally tried our Masizzim after seeing their famous rice balls! ordered the Beef Rice Balls, Bacon Kimchi Egg Roll and the Single Beef Stew. definitely enjoyed the rice balls most, and it was interesting rolling it ourselves! the stew was a little but beef was tender. overall a good experience and would be back again!"
Delicious but pricey,"this was really quite a yummy place! albeit a lil pricey (bc of the small portions) i cant deny that this restaurant serves yummy food hehe. staffs are really friendly n helpful. Food is on the saltier side and if the price of the dishes were lower , i would return :)"
Delicious Korean Comfort Food in Town,"Loved the beef stew and the Korean pancakes! Coupled with a cool citrusy drink, their Iced Yuja Soda is a great way to refresh your palette at the end of your meal. Very convenient location in town, would recommend if you are dining with friends in the area."
Tasty army stew,"The army stew was really tasty! However, it is a bit heavy so I recommend having it with a drink and sharing the stew between multiple people. The service was good even though there was only one waitress."
Yummy Pork Rib Stew!,The pork stew soup was delicious and had a generous amount of pork! The stew was also rich in flavour. The crab meat rice ball had an interesting taste and it was also fun to make the rice ball. The kimchi pancake was very crunchy and cheesy!
The beef stew rocks!,"I ordered their beef stew. It‚Äôs pretty good. Very flavorful, the beef ribs are very soft. very good with rice. The portion is pretty big, 1 order can share it with a friend.
The pancake is also very crispy. We ordered a few dishes and share, an every enjoyable meal.
The prices are reasonable, the ambient is very causal and light."
Warm and Hearty Korean Fare,"I appreciated how Masizzim offers a wide variety of Korean dishes - stews, steamed egg, bimbibap, yuzu tea... my friend and I were rather spoilt for choice! The food was warm and hearty which was nice on a rainy day; and it was really convenient to have dinner in the basement of 313 Somerset after shopping in town."
Korean Fusion Food!,"We ordered the Beef Rib Stew, Crab Meat & Fish Roe Rice Ball, Tomato Cheese Kimchi Pancake and Crab Meat Egg Roll. All of the ordered dishes were wonderful! Personally my favourite was the Beef Rib Stew. We ordered spicy level 2 but it was more of a tangy taste. So for spicy lovers, I recommend spice level 4. Kimchi Pancake tasted a bit like pizza to be honest but it was still good!"
Korean food,"Do try and order the pork rib stew! There was a generous portion of pork ribs served, and glass noodles inside were also tasty"
Good place for both family and dates,"Tried the stew and was very pleasantly surprised by how good it was. The stew was very hearty and rich. Apart from the main stew, a special mention of the potato pancake is a must! It is very crispy and tasty. Although I came here for a date, I can see myself coming again with my family. Would happily come back again."
Comforting Korean Food!,Great place to grab a quick korean meal with friends and share the items here! Taste great and would strongly recommend the pancakes as well as the steam egg for everyone coming here!
Unique dishes,"We ordered their signature beef ribs stew ($20.90 single portion, comes with a choice of glass noodle or udon, a bowl of brown rice and spice level from 0-4), $12.50 crab meat fish roe rice ball, $16.50 cheesy tomato kimchi pancake, and $13.50 crab meat egg roll. We definitely over ordered for 2 pax but everything on the menu looked super interesting we had to try!

I have never tried beef ribs stew before and i am so glad i did. Beef ribs was tender, the soup was thick and flavourful - more saucy than soupy. Great to pair it with the rice balls. Kimchi cheesy tomato pancake was like a korean style pizza i love it. Crispy, tangy and cheesy! Something i would return for. As a person who love eggs i am bias.. the egg rolls were sooo good they are really generous with the crab meat too.

I love korean food and tried multiple restaurants but Masizzim have a unique menu and quite a fusion? You need to try it for yourself."
Tasty korean food,"Really enjoyed the cheese egg roll, bugolgi and crab meat with roe rice. The spicy chicken stew was also delicious. One thing to note is that the dishes are on the smaller side considering it's price, other than that worth a try!"
Super worth!,"It was a very amazing meal here. I've always heard of Masizzim but never had a chance to have my meal here until I finally decide to give it a try. We ordered the single beef stew, potato pancake, tuna rice ball and steam egg. It is really tough for me to pick my favourite dish as all of them are equally as good and I will definitely go back to eat again!!"
Yummy Korean food in Singapore - must try,"I visited multiple times and brought multiple groups of friends and every trip was very enjoyable as everyone liked the variety and quality of food available.

Strongly recommend the stew for sharing amongst groups of friends and the pancakes and rice balls are a must order! I sometimes crave for multiple portions‚Ä¶ will love to come back again!"
Highly Recommended Korean Rice Balls!! 5/5,"Highly Recommended Korean Cuisine!!

The Crabmeat & Roe Rice Ball was served generously, which included flavorful portions of crabmeat and healthy mixed purple rice!

Loved the broth from the Spicy Chicken Stew, and the chicken served was also very tender!

I am not a fan of cheese products, but I have to say that the Honey Mustard Cheese Egg Roll surprised my palate. The cheese and the egg blended perfectly, and it was a great pairing with the rest of the dishes we ordered!

Of course, do remember to try out the Jug of Honeydew Aloe too! It is a really refreshing beverage, which comes with generous portions of aloe vera and honeydew bits as well!

Overall: 5/5!! Will definitely be back for more!!!"
Friendly staff and good food!,"got the kimchi bacon egg roll, spicy chicken stew and squid&leek pancake! favourite out of 3 is definitely the stew which had a good balance between spicy, sweet and savoury. pancake was also nice and crispy! would have liked a bit more bacon in the egg roll but it was pretty good too. shoutout to the service staff, they were really attentive and friendly!"
Interesting Korean Restaurant,"The food was amazing and the place was cosy. We ordered spicy beef rib stew, Beef bulgogi rice ball, Tuna rice ball and Squid and Leek Pancake. The food was super delicious and the portions were big. Would totally recommend this place!"
Yummy and Cheesy,"Amazing service, and great ambience to savour good food. Staff there is friendly. Personal favourite is the honey mustard egg roll. Definitely a must try in their menu. The generous amount of cheese a d honey mustard blends well with the egg roll. Besides, the rice ball dish does provide a unique experience of rolling your own rice ball.
Overall I will give it 9/10
Will come back for more !"
bustling korean fud place in town,"Went on a weekday night and it was quite packed! Ordered spicy chicken stew with udon, which has a nice sweet-savoury taste. Portion was a lot smaller than i thought tho so i wished there were more veges and gravy.

Squid and leek pancake was super crispy and went well w the sauce, and the squid tasted p fresh

Kimchi bacon egg roll sounded interesting but was alright and quite normal tasting. The bacon isn't much.

Overall appreciated the good service and that food came piping hot! Considering the portion sizes the food is a lil pricey but location is gr8, and taste is nubbad, so its worth a try!"
New item on menu - Tomato Cheese Kimchi Pizza,"Will recommend the new item in the menu tomato cheese kimchi pancake. Pancake was thin and crispy, with generous amounts of tomato and cheese in the filling."
10/10 korean food!!,"Really LOVE this place! Highly recommend the flavourful riceball and fluffy korean egg roll~ We ordered crabmeat & roe riceball, it came with a generous portion of crabmeat (look at that bowl!!) and the mixed purple rice was the most yummy healthy rice I've ever eaten!! Pro tip 1: riceballs were extra juicy when you mix and squeeze them together into balls. Pro tip 2: we saved $2 when we traded the steamed rice that came w the stew for our riceball (how awesome that they have such an option btw!!)

Jug of Honeydew aloe is 1 litre full and enough for 3 pax, it was really refreshing and I can't believe how many small pieces of honeydew there were in there?! Must try this too!

Overall a 10/10 for me! No wonder it is full house on a weekday night :'D"
"Good service, even better food!","Delicious seafood stew, fun experience with handcrafting rice balls. There were many different flavours of rice balls, and all were extremely tasty. The staff were also very friendly. Would definitely come here again!"
Excellent beef stew,"Extremely delicious authentic Korean food for a reasonable price! The stews have different spiciness levels suitable for low spice tolerance and spicy lovers alike, and the beef is tender and juicy. Also really loved the rice balls and had lots of fun making them. Highly recommended!"
"Delicious food, nice staff","Food tastes delicious, and the staff are really nice and kind! The pizza was crunchy and fragrant, the egg rolls were also soft and fluffy, while the stew is very filling. I especially liked making the rice balls, they were so fun to roll into a ball, and of course they were delicious as well. A great fusion restaurant, and has some authentic Korean feels. Overall homely atmosphere. Recommend this place!"
"Homely place, good food!","Great food and staff. Taste is great for the price range, the rice balls are fun to make and delicious. The meat in the stews are also very tender!"
Hidden gem in 313 Somerset,"Stumbled across this place while I was in the basement of 313 Somerset. Their food selection is really good if you're looking for authentic Korean food. We had the chance to make our own rice balls (which was disastrous) but loads of fun. The highlight for me had to be the cheese egg roll and the beef stew. For a restaurant in Somerset, the prices were really reasonable and perfect for those looking for good affordable food."
Satisfying and reasonably priced Korean food!,Had a wonderful and satisfying meal with my friend at Masizzim at 313. Really enjoyed the beef stew and cheese egg roll. The pork was a bit too spicy for us but still manageable with the rice! Service was also great and the crowd was just nice :)
Top-notch Korean cuisine that wont break the bank,"Where do i begin - decor is on point with its industrial chic feel, and the food is such a major plus point as well. Had fun making the rice balls (my attempt was disastrous) and the stew was so rich and tasty. The egg rolls is a MUST order regardless of the type of filling.. and the kimchi cheese pancake was a pleasant surprise.
All in all a worthwhile place to go for yall Korean food lovers."
Good and reasonably priced Korean cuisine?!?,"Massizim is now my go-to for korean food. The stew was good with fall-off-the-bone meat, the omelet tastes nice and creamy, and as someone who doesn't enjoy the ketchup and mayonnaise combination, I thoroughly enjoyed the omelet."
Must Try Tomato Cheese Kimchi Pancake,Don‚Äôt miss this restaurant tucked at B3 of Somerset 313 because it is comfort food especially for rainy weather. We love their Soy Beef Stew so much - the beef is cooked till tender and they‚Äôre really juicy! Other stews are also available if you don‚Äôt take beef. Their crabmeat egg roll and rice ball comes with juicy chunks of crabmeat and our most loved Tomato Cheese Pancake is a must try - the acidity from the tomatoes made it light to eat though it‚Äôs savoury. Will definitely return!
Cozy place with modern Korean food,"The beef rib stew was done to perfect tenderness, and I ordered Level 1 spiciness which suits my tastebud well. Also ordered egg roll which was wholesome and filling! Cozy place to chill out with family and friends."
Bibimbap,I have ordered a healthy Bibimbap rice bowl with ground beef and loads of vegetables. The ingredients are fresh and crunchy. End my meal with hot honey ginger tea. Feel satisfied
Wholesome Korean meal for sharing,"came here with my partner but it seems like Masizzim is a great place for group hangouts as well considering that the menu consisted of mostly sharing items. we ordered the Pork Rib Stew (for 2pax), Crab Meat & Roe Riceball and Tuna Seaweed Egg Roll, all of which I truly enjoyed! They all tasted just like comfort food, especially the stew which imo is best recommended to eat with rice. The Crab Meat & Roe riceball was a fun experience to make and each ingredient and sauce complements each other really well! The Egg Roll was also fluffy and jam-packed with so much tuna mayo! Ever since I ate at Masizzim, I have developed a newfound love for Korean food :) Am excited to come back again to try more dishes like their pancakes and other stews"
Yummy Egg Crab Roll and Mango Sago!,"Enjoyed the egg roll with fresh, succulent crab in the center. As for the dessert, we appreciate the variety of choices and the prices were reasonable. The mango sago was the perfect blend of fresh fruit and sweetness. The staff were really accommodating and friendly, which we considered a huge plus. We would definitely be coming again!"
great food and ambience,"Dined at Masizzim a few days ago for dinner, and was pleasantly surprised with the prompt & polite service and great food! The Spicy Stew Chicken has 4 levels of spice, and I opted for level 2. The dish packs a punch and those who enjoy spicy food will definitely enjoy this! The chicken in the stew was very tender and fall off the bone easily. Definitely will visit again!"
Hearty Korean meal,Had a really enjoyable food experience at Masizzim. The food did not disappoint and I really love the Beefstew. Every mouthful was packed full of flavour and warms you up inside! I recommend the crabmeat & roe rice balls too as the crabmeat was really fresh and it was interesting to make your own rice balls too! The squid and leek pancake were really delicious! The kimchi fried rice could be better as it was a little too tough. Overall a very enjoyable experience.
Highly Recommend the egg rolls,"We had the tuna and seaweed egg rolls, bbq chicken, chicken rice balls and chicken stew :) Highly recommend the egg rolls as they were sumptuous and I loved the texture. The other dishes were also well-seasoned . Last but not least, we were grateful to be in the company of wonderful staff who were attentive and fun :)"
Get their egg rolls! üç≥ü•ö,"Really enjoyed the egg rolls, which were very fluffy and light! :) Good side to pair with the mains. Also loved the rice balls, which you could shape yourself - had a very well balanced flavour profile."
Amazing Korean Food!,"The Bibimbap was one of the most enjoyable dish I've had so far. Loved how all the different ingredients mix so well with each other. Tasted amazing! Also ordered the Kimchi Bacon Egg Roll which was flavourful. In addition, the Leek&Squid Pancake was light and crisp and awesome! Definitely want to try their riceballs next time as many people were ordering it too! Staff was also extremely attentive here. Would come again!"
Authentic Korean delicacies,"Really enjoyed my meal here. A sweet aroma fills the air when I chanced upon this restaurant and me and my partner decided to give it a try. We got ourselves the Soy beef rib stew, Beef Bulgogi Rice balls and the tomato cheese kimchi pancake. They gave us gloves to roll the beef bulgogi rice into balls ourselves, which was a lot of fun! The food was mouth-watering and very authentic from my experiences dining Korean delicacies and the portions were big. Super worth it for their price point!"
"Yummy korean food, good stew!","I love korean food so i had to check out Massizzim. Ordered a variety of items including the beef stew, spicy pork rice balls and tomato cheese pancake. My favourite would definitely be the beef stew that was really sweet and tasty! The beef was also tender and delicious. The rice balls were fun to roll too, but i ended up just eating it with a spoon haha. The tomato cheese pancake was also bomb and really crispy. Hope to try the egg rolls next time i come!"
Great Korean Food,"Ordered the spicy beef stew which was quite tasty. I enjoyed how the glass noodle soaks up all the goodness of the stew. The beef was tender too. The level 2 spice was not too spicy, would recommend it for level 3 or 4 if you like it spicy, I loved the squid and leek pancake as the batter was light and crispy. Would love to try the rice balls next time as I saw other diners ordering them."
Great Korean fare,"Had quite a feast at Masizzim!

Crabmeat & Roe Riceballs - Fresh crab meat and really tasty! Definitely worth a try. Quite fun to make your own rice balls also.

Tuna egg roll - Great appetiser. Egg was fluffy and paired well with tuna and mayo. Some may find it abit salty though.

Beef stew - Really delicious and hearty stew, perfect after a long day. Each sip was packed full of flavour and beef was nice and tender.

Kimchi fried rice - This was alright, a little too tough for my liking.

Squid and leek pancake - Nice and crispy pancake with really fresh squid. Best eaten when still hot and fresh!"
very unique korean dishes!,"tried their popular beef rib stew and the meat was soooo tender and smooth! it was a really hearty dish as well with many different ingredients in it, that came together so well to make a really flavorful stew. we also ordered the kimchi cheese pancake which was like a fusion korean x western feel, kind of felt like a creative pizza heard a lot about the kimchi bacon tamago and we had to get it - it balanced out the other heavy-tasting dishes very well with a mild sweetness to it which was just nice. topped off the meal with the melon soju drink which was AMAZING sweet and addictive ‚ò∫"
Dining with decent Korean food,"I really enjoyed the food here, the highlight for me would be the pork rib stew (single sharing) and rice balls to share with a friend since we ordered quite a number of dishes. It was very flavourful and so was the rice balls! It was a really fun experience to mix the rice and shape the rice balls too. I do wish though, that I ordered plain rice since everything was very flavourful so I really appreciated that the side dishes like the pickled radish and kimchi were free flow to cut the grease. The service was also great, they were prompt and helpful. Overall, a good dining experience :)"
Tasty Korean Food,"The food was delicious - we tried many dishes and they were all extremely flavourful. We got pork rib stew (soy based) with glass noodles and tteokbokki. The tteokbokki wasn't chewy enough for me but the ribs were super soft and the stew was savoury and fragrant. We also got the crab meat and roe rice balls, and you could shape them yourself so that was fun! The tomato cheese kimchi pancake was great too, the spiciness of the kimchi was balanced by the soft, stretchy cheese and made for a delicious dish. However, the serving size is rather big so you should definitely share it with 2-4 pax. The spicy squid was tasty as well, and came with plenty of crunchy sprouts which I particularly enjoyed. Lastly, the free flow banchan helped to cut the greasiness of some of the food and was also delightfully crunchy!"
Affordable and tasty set lunch!,"Currently they have the lunch set menu which consist of 1 main, bowl of seaweed soup and two pieces of Korean pancakes.Had the pork Bulgogi and it was good. Think the rice they served is the mixed-grain which is healthier. Food was served quickly as well. Overall, each person paid about $15+ after GST and service charge."
Bad Restaurant Reception,"super no responsive. i believe they just don't pick up any call. But too bad, call is the only option to make reservation. Think twice if you want to go this restaurant for any kind of celebration."
Make your own rice ball and bring your own water!,"Get a whole set to share with your friends! Good enough for 4 people! The massisoyo set ($50++) comes with a double stew with choice of meat, rice ball, side and beverage!

Friendly service. Good for big groups.

I especially like the hands on for making rice ball - the tuna was good but I want to try crab meat and roe next time! Wear the disposable gloves and prepare to get dirty! One bowl can make about 8 balls. Ohhhhh and the squid and leek pancake is very good. Still crispy when cold. The sauce was a must to dip, and very good with the pancake. I also really liked the grapefruit yoghurt drink - great to balance the spicy dishes. The pickled lettuce and radish ban chan were good too.

I was not particularly a fan of the chicken stew - definitely had potential but probably because I‚Äôm not a fan of chicken. Spicy level 2 was even too spicy for Indonesians! Beef is supposedly really good. The thick glass noodles, ricecake and mushrooms were good in the stew.

What‚Äôs the deal with bottled water? Why can‚Äôt we just have tap water?!

Will be back with groups of friends!

313 somerset B3-02, next to subway"
Why not,"We don‚Äôt normally go for Korean food, but this place was located near to our hotel, so we went with it. I think some of the previous reviews were a little unfair. We thought it was a decent standard."
Visit during Rainy Day,"Since it is a wet and cold evening, we decided to try out their Shabu Shabu for the first time. Pricing wise I would consider reasonable, some saving if you order a double portion of meats (however it have to be the same type).

We didn't like the soup base of their Shabu Shabu and there isn't any alternative soup base we could opt for, unlike Japanese cuisine. It tastes pretty artificial. This set comes with maggie mee and a decent portion of vegetables. We ordered double beef Shabu Shabu at SGD32.90, slightly below average for the quality of meat.

They do not serve normal white rice, the only option available will be grain rice (purple) with additional SGD1/bowl.

If you ever visit Korean before, you know every restaurant provide free-flow of water and side sides to go along. Water is chargeable at SGD1 and only two side sides which look nowhere near appetizing. Highly doubt we will ever return.

Overall damage SGD41 for 2pax (decent pricing)"
Korean food - Average taste,"Tried the food at the location in 313 Somerset.
Situated in the B3 level, the open concept restaurant is breezy with ‚Äòinteresting ‚Äò decor.
We had the crab meat and roe rice balls. This was the highlight of the meal.
The stewed beef ribs were ok but the abundant fascia left on the meat made it a very chewy experience. The stirred fried ‚Äò jokpal‚Äô was forgettable.
We had a grapefruit yogurt drink which took the edge off the stir fried dish.
All in all an average experience but paying an exaggerated amount for so-so food.
Chir chir would have been better. :)"
Average Korean food,Busy restaurant that offers mainly stews. Ordered a omelette side dish with tuna inside. Not sure if this is Korean though. The cashier was funny and joked with us.
Delicious!,"Visited this restaurant a couple of times and still loving the Anchovy Rice Balls! Had fun making it with my own hands! The stew is good as well, prefer the beef stew rather than pork. The meat is more tender! The pancakes and steamed eggs tastes great too! It's complements well with the main dishes!"
Korean Cuisine @ Somerset 313 ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ \o-o/,"Change of environment and eateries. We decided to try MASIZZIM restaurant. Beef stew was great! This dish comes with rice. Spicy squid dish is hot and delicious! Nice & simple environment. Nice experience, and service was good. Can try! Enjoy!"
Average,The signature beef rib stew was good. Won‚Äôt say it has that ‚Äòwow‚Äô factor. Glass noodles was chewy. We added cheese to this dish. They don‚Äôt seem to do it right with cheese. Steamed egg was so so.. pancake with potatoes was good. Would say there is nothing to make me want to go back again.
Korean stews and pancakes some would enjoy!,"My friend and I had early dinner at Masizzim on 23 Dec; ordered its signature dishes: Beef Rib Stew with Vermicelli, Squid and Leek Pancake, Steamed Egg and also Chilsung Cider drinks. There was only another customer inside the premises initially; but after 7 pm, crowds started to stream in.
The food was satisfactory. The stew-beef was rather ""chewy""; and the vermicelli was somewhat thick and rubbery. The level-2 spicy level should be acceptable to most locals (though customers were able to add-on further chilli, if they so desired). The steamed egg was also too solid and bland for us.
The table seating for 2 customers was obviously restrictive. This might discourage them from ordering more food for the table."
Modern Korean,"Another lunch location at 313 basement. A modern twist to Korean food. The beef stew with glass noodles taste good. The rice balls accompaniment Is a match to the stew. Their steam eggs and pancakes are delicious. Comes with radish and Kimchee.
Their Orange drink is welcoming. Food is satisfactory and it comes with price at the higher end. Should be a good location for an alternative food experience!"
Fantastic korean at somerset 313,"Bored of korean over at food republic food court please Go and try this restaurant located basement 3. Dinner and lunch packed. Book early or come outside those hours. We came fridaynight early booking and come early as they hold booking for 15 minutes. Hot pot were fantastic, u chose ur broth, also spice level, the noodle. Then there was this rice ball which they provide the ingredient and u had to roll it yourself. And the price was very reasonable. Well done, no regret that gained 2 kg in one single meal."
Interesting but quite costly,The meat stew is quite good but I feel it is a little overpriced. Rice ball and steam egg is good. Be prepared to queue during dinner and weekends....
"OK if you love meat, but not true Korean","After spending a wonderful vacation in Seoul a month ago, we went to Masizzim to reminisce the great food we had in Korea. Unfortunately Masizzim offers a lot of protein but does not balance it with proper banchan, the side dishes typical of a Korean meal. Only a small plate of potato salad with corn and a separate plate with kimchi. We had a beef rib stew with toppoki and japchae noodles. The only veggies in the dish we're few chopped scallions and mushrooms. The ribs were very tender and tasted good, but without more veggies the beef was too heavy of a meal. My kids spaghetti with cream sauce had too much cream. My kid, who hardly leaves a plate of pasta unfinished, complained it was too saucy and did not finish. Service was prompt and courteous, but the food left a lot to be desired."
Dinner with colleague,"Went to Somerset Korean restaurant Masizzim Friday 14/7/17. Food serve within 10 minute for the rice ball, this is the fun part as we mix ingredients and make into ball shape our own . We love the pork ribs pasta although it is too creamy . The pork ribs super soft and food portion enough for two person . Will come back to this restaurant for others food ."
Overpriced beef stew,"long queues, beef stew is quite soft but portion is very small. Lots of bones with little meat. Quite expensive for the amount of meat. Kimchi is included, small portion though refillable. Waiters/waitresses get a little annoyed when you ask for the 3rd refill. The rice balls were over-rated and overpriced."
