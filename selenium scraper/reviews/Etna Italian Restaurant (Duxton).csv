Contemporary italian food,"I went to Etna at the invitaion of a regular customer to try italian food. I confess l am not keen on western food in Singapore as l keep western food for trips to the places where western food is the local cuisine.
Met CS Manager Alessandro T. Host left the dishes to him to pick for us for food sharing. He also recommeneded a Pinot Noir red wine to go with his food selection. I notice the wine was not in the restaurant's wine list.We had special apptz and special pasta in addition to foca crudo ruco,ciriole norcina and big seabass. The seabass was cooked with aluminium foil. It came to our table for the finishing touch.Manager expertly cut up the fish,deboned it and placed all the meat on a plate. I was impressed with how fresh the pieces of fish looked. The fish l ate reminded me of the fresh fish one gets eating fresh steamed fish,done chinese style. This style of cooking one whole fish is not common in italian restaurants.
All the food was tasty. The food was just right for the four of us,leaving no room for dessert.
The service was excellent.
This italian restaurant offerring contemporary italian cuisine with a Sicilian touch is one l would definitely recommend"
Amazing,Great food and value for money. Staff is nice and anticipates your needs. I definitely recommend the place
Fantastic restaurant,"We had a very pleasant dining experience at the restaurant. The seafood stew, ravioli, sea bass and desserts were all good. The service was excellent. The staff paid attention to small details and served us well. Will definitely recommend our friends!"
Superb as always,"Always love Etna for their friendly services and awesome Italian food, their roasted fish is juicy as we expected , roasted till perfection and very juicy , love their seafood classic Italian pasta and lastly superb Etna pizza. And we enjoyed new birthday surprise celebration from the staff"
Great found @ Etna,"A truly authentic Italian place; great food, homely, friendly.. Look for Sanju Anand, he's very knowledgeable and give good recommendations. Will be back again!"
Not great,Friendly staff but a very busy restaurant. It seems the number of staff can’t cater for the customers. Waiter forgot one item from our order. The bruschetta was overdone and burnt and another waiter eager to clear our plates even though my husbands was still eating! I would not recommend or visit again. Starters and mains in general were just ok. Wine and tiramisu very good.
Highly Recommended,"Celebrated my daughter's birthday at Etna after reading the positive review. Warm hospitality service by the staffs. We had burrata ham, calamari, Fiorentina steak, linguine granchio, pizza special & dessert - almond panna cotta & Choco lava cake w/vanilla ice-cream. The food was so yummy! Thumbs-up for their food presentation as well. Not forgetting, Thanks to Ms. Etta who recommended a good btl of red wine to pair with our food. Highly recommended this place!"
Real Authentic Awesome Italian food,"If there were to three words for every aspects of the restaurant :

Food : Real , organic and flavourful
Service : Genuine, fast and helpful
Ambience : feel like you are just at Italy
People: Professional, helpful and well trained

Special commendations to Henrietta for her great reccomendations . Sanju for his great hospitality."
Good service great food!,"It was my 3rd visit and will definitely be back for more… service staff was warm & welcoming, friendly & attentive. Food was good!"
Bad service,"We had 14 people gathering and left with the feeling that the restaurant didn’t really want us to be there. Because of the number of kids, we did order mostly pasta and spaghetti dishes, and yes we order the most affordable wines. However throughout the dinning, they tried pushing us to order more expansive dishes and the expensive wine. The waiter who took a photo for us took ONE photo and walk away without saying much. It’s a lousy experience for us. I guess if you want people to spend more in order to get better service, you can set the minimum charge and serve with a smile. We won’t go back."
Excellent Italian Food,"Excellent food, well presented with great hospitality. Need to re-stock the wine cellar. Will definitely be back."
Amazing! Definitely recommend,Meals were lovely. You got more than what you paid for and was great quality. The staff are brilliant and we definitely left satisfied! :)
Authentic delicious Italian,"Authentic, delicious and well portioned Italian food. Good variety of food and reasonably priced. Service was attentive and mostly prompt. We had to wait a while for the special duck confit but it was well worth the wait - so juicy and tender! This is my second time there and will be back again."
Pleasant Experience,"Came here to celebrate wifey's birthday. It was surprised to see the restaurant was full despite it being a Tuesday evening, so make sure to make a reservation before going down. Upon reaching, the service staff Leticia attended to us and offered us ice water as they were a little busy and helping to prepare the table for us. When we got seated, she asked if we like to place our bag with a hanging hook instead of placing it on our seat. As we wanted a mixture of pasta and pizza, Leticia suggested that we can try the focaccia which according to her is like ""prata with filling"". This piqued our interest and we went on to order it (Schiacciata al Tartufo e Mascarpone), along with the Grilled Calamari, Lobster Ravioli and Pistachio Tiramisu.

The Grilled Calamari was definitely one of the best dishes for the day, followed by the Tiramisu. For the lobster ravioli, the first bite was a little blend but it becomes more flavourful the more we eat; the focaccia was interesting as it looks good and certainly much bigger than we anticipated and we were surprised with the texture and the taste initially. Unfortunately, it got a little jelak the more we have it and we didn't feel like finishing it after clearing half the focaccia (we did manage to finish it) but i would strongly suggest this dish to be shared with at least 4 people so that everyone can enjoy it without feeling sick of it.

All in all, quite a good experience though it was a little noisy and not as cozy as we would have like. (with many groups of diners that day)"
Delightful experience,Cosy ambience great food and wine topped off by exceptionally wonderful service. Altogether a great experience. Will be back soon!
One of the Best Italian Restaurants I've been to outside of Italy!,"I had an amazing meal! The staff were Italian including the chefs so it felt really authentic. Lots of options on the menu and specials board. And then, as if that wasn't enough, the waitress suggested that chef could make any pasta with any sauce option. I took that option and had a delicious hand made pasta meal - wow! I'll definitely be going back, loved it!"
Not a repeat,The food was fine but you can find better options below the prices they have here! Nice to come for an experience but wouldn’t go out of my way to return #claudcomments
Pleasant Dinner,"Especially enjoyed their pizza. The pizza base was thin yet fluffy. Dinner was made more memorable due to the good service from our server, Sarah and Chef Giordano. Upon speaking with them we found out that their pizza dough is freshly made everyday. Plus points! We are coming back!!"
Excellent & high quality Italian food,Such good quality food with reasonable price. Must go back again. Home made pasta was so yummy. Roast pork rib was another surprise - yummy yummy. Dessert - must try Panna cotta - super yummy to end the dinner.
Lunch,"Had lunch with a friend today. Henrietta, Chef Giordano, and Sanju were very friendly with service! The carbonara was AMAZING! loved the parma ham salad too. will bring more friends over in the future!💖"
Good Italian,"In the middle on Duxton is this good Italian restaurant serving good carpaccio, and Burrata cheese with Parma ham and rocket salad. Their Linguine pasta with crab bisque and crabmeat tasted wonderful and their salt crusted sea bass was beautifully prepared. Must come back for more. Service was good and price was acceptable. Environment were pictures of the Amalfi Coast."
Excellent!,"Food is fantastic, service is perfect and the atmosphere is warm & welcoming. Definitely a must try."
"As always, Very good and fresh food and good service","As regular guests, we always like to come back to this place as we are sure that we won't be disappointed or by the food which is fresh and tasty, or by the staff serving us in a very good and friendly atmosphere. We must then largely recommend."
Superb lunch!,Service was impeccable! Staff were extremely polite and accommodating which made our lunch time so pleasant. Lunch set is of great value and yummy! We enjoyed the starters and dessert most. Our plates were changed at every course which was a really nice touch.
A great experience,"Each time we have been, the service has been excellent and the food has been amazing. We look forward dining soon. Highly recommend it."
Perfect!,"I love food that challenges my palate and the grilled calamari did it!! Tiramisu a winner tooo Those who can’t take alc, this is for u! A tad sweet but the texture & good blend of authentic pistachio paste made me savor every single bite!!
The staff & manager were very attentive & constantly came over to check if the food was to our liking, refill our water and made small talks to make us feel at home. The service is as good as a fine dining restaurant
Good food, service & pricing what more can I ask for!"
"Excellent cuisine, excellent service as usual","Lunch course only for 27.80++, very tasty and value for money. Check their lunch course menu in facebook, it's updated every week."
Good Italian Food,Our dining experience at Etna Italian Restaurant at Duxton was great. The service was excellent and the food authentic. I was offered variations to the menu dishes due to food allergies and I absolutely enjoyed the pasta that I had. Alessandro was attentive not only to us but to all the customers which was nice. the dishes recommended by him did not disappoint. all the service were attentive. I would highly recommend this restaurant for its authentic italian food and service.
Enjoyed my New Year Eve Dinner,"Managed to get a booking via chope at Etna. We got the bruschetta, walnut/cheese ravioli and braised lamb pasta. The bruschetta was standard, but we really enjoyed the pastas. The ravioli had so many flavours that went very well together. It was very creamy so can be abit jelak but the braised lamb pasta was tomato-based so both complements each other. Servers were very attentive and friendly too. Good experience :)"
Great start to 2022,Lovely start to the first meal for 2022 at Etna (Duxton). Great quality food in generous portions. Excellent service and enjoyed the passionate sharing by Aless of Italy’s unique local produces.
Our favourite Italian in SG,"Etna is our go to Italian spot. You will always find very high quality, delicious cuisine here with a great list of daily specials!"
Awesome,"Food was still as great, as when we came years ago. Love the black winter truffle pasta and the tiramisu, and house bread!"
Good food n great service,Food was good. The set lunch was excellent value. Service was impeccable. Cosy atmosphere like a real small Italian restaurant
Sicilian taste,"After a dinner with my family, I have only one regret: having been at Etna for the first time only in Dec 2021!
As Italian, it is a great pleasure to find such a lovely restaurant, with nice ambience and great choice of tasty Sicilian dishes.
A very interesting wine list completes a wonderful experience. To be repeated soon!"
Lunch on Dec 18 2021 for party of 4 at 1pm.,Food awesome.had : Apptz+Carne special+Risotto+Ciriole+Spaghetti Bolognese + Tiramisu+ bottle Prosecco Foca tradition
"Good food, old fashioned ambience",Great pasta Restaurant is a bit dark and dingy and could do with a makeover Good value for money Overall good experience
An Italian escape in Duxton!,Etna restaurant has got such a vibrant ambiance that makes you feel like you’re in Italy. We really enjoyed focaccia and our main courses were excellent! Fantastic wine selection too. Wonderful service team and special thanks to Yvonne for taking such good care of us. Overall we had a wonderful experience on our first visit.
Excellent time,"Fantastic and delicious food, some of the best pizza in Singapore. Dessert was delicious to top everything off. Very happy with the service. Will come again!"
Overall good,"This was the 2nd time I came to this restaurant. I love their Etna pizza, the best pizza for me in Singapore. I order this pizza every time.

We also ordered the house special pasta that day. For some reason, both my husband and I had a really bad diarrhea shortly after this (I had to run to the bathroom a few times that nigth). I am not sure if it was because of the seafood in the pasta or something else. It was quite odd.

Will still revisit the plate for Etna pizza but a bit cautious for other stuff."
Definitely a go to place for Italian,"Did takeaways twice and wanted to do a dine-in. The pasta is really good, saved some for a tiramisu. Really did not disappoint, bookmarked as a place to return."
Excellent experience (food and service are top!),"Have been to Etna a few times now. It always have been a good experience. The last visit was exceptional. Alex has been super attentive, helpful and fun. The recommendations of dishes we did not think about ordering turned out to be gems (focaccia Liguria vs pizza). The drinks were also great, especially the pistachio negroni (which is not on the menu yet).

Quite often you find restaurants with good food but average service or vice versa. For Etna, they consistently deliver on both - well done and thank you!"
An evening well spent,"It was our first visit and we were not disappointed to chose this venue basis the wonderful reviews, nice atmosphere and best in class Italian food, right at the heart of Duxton Hill in Tanjong Pagar, nice for special occasions, especially as our host Alex makes it special for all guests as I read in other reviews, he understood that we were not very sure of what to order especially given one of us was vegetarian, so he took sone hints from us and rest we left it to his good recommendations, and we were not disappointed at all, in fact it was more fun, and it was not that we paid a hefty cheque that way, we had 4 limoncello shots on the house, and their special pistachio tiramisu with special writing for the birthday girl was a nice gesture, we ordered quite a few items for 4 of us, besides Prosecco and Chianti to start with, followed by sone cocktails including classic mojito which was as good as it could get, a big potion of burrata, bruschetta, pistachio ravioli, risotto with mushroom, pizza with black truffle and some desserts, and we spent < 100$ per person, it was a good experience and we would re-visit soon"
Satisfying Lunch at Etna,"I celebrated birthday with my friend at Etna (just before the announcement for no-dining haha..). This must be my 3rd time at Etna but my first time for lunch. Service was very good. Food recommended by Manager, Alex was excellent. The pork ribs was yummy. We were impressed when the black-ink pasta was divided into 2 portions for our convenience. That's what I called extra mile service. What make a restaurant more successful than the rest. It's the extra mile service besides good food. Well done! We enjoyed our lunch very much. Will go there again to try other food. Keep it up!"
Great coffee included in set lunch,"After our cycling trip along East Coast Park, we returned our GoCycling bicycles at T2. We took bus No 36 and had lunch at the Etna restaurant at Upper East Coast Road. We ordered the set lunch. The first course was strangely either a choice of soup or garlic bread. We were given the complimentary focaccia bread with olive oil. However I found the focaccia bread to be quite hard. At the Duxton Road branch, it was a choice of either soup or salad. We had fish and pork as our mains. As we did not eat bacon, so we were disappointed with our choice of pork which came with 2 slices of bacon. The fish main was good. Our dessert was panna cotta. Our set lunch came with coffee."
Great food,"Amazing food and service. Their pizza is really delicious! Better than their pasta. Ordered the crab pasta with crabmeat sauce - will be good if they have already peel the crab else, it gets messy. Prefer their pizza to their pasta. The pizza is really good. Their tiramisu is great too. Price is reasonable for the quality of food."
Amazing Food & Service,As my title says amazing food and service. Would give 6 stars if I could. Friendly staff who went out of their way for us.
Satisfying lunch during our walk,"We were doing a walk admiring the shophouses in Telok Ayer and Tanjong Pagar areas. Our lunch stop was at Etna where we had the set lunch. It was three course and it includes coffee or tea at $27.80++. Service was good and we had warm water with lemon slice , focaccia bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar served to us first. Salad was refreshing and we chose two different mains to share.
It is a popular restaurant and reservation is best done for dinner."
Put Etna down in your Italian rolodex,Classy rustic you-can-always-count-on Italian fare and warm service is what you get here. You know it’s solid when you look at the loyal clientele. Scampi pasta is such a looker. Snapper is tender textured and well elevated by the fresh notes of the tomato stew. You get to wash down all flavours with good limoncello at the end of your grand course.
goof food and good service.,Lunch service was prompt and good food despite being busy. They were good at suggesting vegetarian options.
Great Lunch Spot!,Good value set lunch options - and the food was great as well. Great for a quick business lunch with exceptional service.
Great hearty and authentic Italian food,"If you want authentic and hearty Italian food, Etna is the place to go. The service is warm and the food is great. The restaurant even remembered that I asked for something special for my wedding anniversary. I would most definitely come back here again."
Reasonbaly Priced Italian Restaurant,"Came here with a reservation with 2 other friends. The recommended wine was enjoyable. We ordered burrata salad,calamari, pizza and pasta which was sufficient. Tiramisu however is forgettable. Overall nice experience."
Great reasonably priced Italian,"Delicious food! We both loved everything we ordered, especially the tuna tartar and lamb shanks. Unfortunately we were both too full to order dessert and I really was hoping to try the cannoli. Drinks are very reasonably priced for Singapore. We'll be back before long."
Delicious authentic Italian,"Excellent Italian food made with high quality ingredients, some of the best we’ve had in Singapore. We really appreciated the advice we got on our wine which was also delicious."
Etna Italian Restaurant,Food was good and service was fast. The restaurant has a nice ambience...not too crowded. Pricing of food was reasonable for Italian restaurant of this type for special occasions.
Best Italian restaurant in,"Best Italian restaurant in Singapore ! Amazing pizza, and excellent service ! Definitely recommended !"
Can be better,"Food was great. Service was tiptop. However, from my table, l can hear the kitchen staff talking loudly among themselves, Hokkien vulgarity was used. Maybe the establishment like to remind the staff to be more subtle."
Perfect Friday night meal,"Just back from Etna @ Upp East Coast Road. Despite the minor hassles of checking in and the anxiety of whether or not to keep the masks on or off in between courses, we had a thoroughly enjoyable meal and have to commend the team there on keeping things running smoothly.

There were a couple of people trying their luck to get a table without a booking when we arrived at 7PM. We were seated promptly and served water and bread straight away....always a good sign that the service is taken seriously, even when busy.

Now to the food...we ordered the Burrata and Parma ham fo start, as well as the Bruschetta. Both were excellent, and the freshness of the ingredients was obvious. Plenty of flavour. For mains, we ordered the Lobster Ravioli which was delicious but tiny (literally 4 pieces each) and the Pork tenderloin (also small and to be honest the only disappointing dish as it was too dry and/or had been left standing too long).

For dessert, the classic Tiramisu and coffee. Very good and followed up with a complimentary Limoncello which was a nice touch. Again, it speaks to the service which was attentive without being overbearing and got the basics right, such as keeping the water flowing and dishes coming promptly.

Would I go back? Definitely. Would I order the same again? Almost, apart from the Pork.

Recommend this place for quality Italian food and decent service that makes you feel welcome."
Ordered from Etna thrice and,"Ordered from Etna thrice and the third time tonight (Apr 24 Fri), the delivery screwed up, thanks to a driver who was more than 20 mins early but couldn’t even wait 5 mins. Staff was really helpful- was very polite even when I sounded frustrated and also helped to heat up the food. It is a tough situation for all so hang in there and will def order again!"
Very unimpressive for an Italian Restaurant when they should be doing all they can to please clients at such times,"As we are in the midst of Covid 19 many restaurants are doing their best to open take out menus. This indeed Is important to help the economy and employment and we are big supporters.

Sadly Etna failed to meet expectations. Let me list out 1. Food wasn’t as ordered. The steak was supposed to be medium and it was well done and the lamb was to be medium rare but again was well done. 2. Red snapper fish was all soggy and not that cooked. We had to recook 3. Pizza was all cut out into pieces and on delivery was all scattered in the box 4. Asked for chilli oil and none provided 5. All food was cold and we had to reheat which isn’t the way to enjoy an Italian fine dining 5. There was no bread which should be a general courtesy 6. Food came 20 mins later and we paid for delivery 6. General packaging poor. 7. Portions were small and I mean small. The driver was good so he had nothing to do with it. Like I told the restaurant they aren’t ready for deliveries and charging the same for a home delivery is unjust. A rather bad experience."
Excellent!,Service is great Server recommended perfect choices for us. Pasta cooked perfectly Snapper was really delicious Definitely will recommend this place to others.
A perfect evening,"This is a great place for a date night, or for meeting friends. The reviews are very accurate. The welcome of the staff and the natural friendliness is so wonderful to encounter. The staff helped to make this a very special night.
The ambience is there too, with white tablecloths, lovely cutlery and glasses, space between the neighbouring tables and music that is background.
And the food. I had the lamb shank, which fell off the bone and was really tasty and very meaty. My husband had the ragu, which he said was very tasty. The meals, with the Foccacia bread, filled us up, so we didn't manage to try the Tiramasu or Panacotta, which were both recommended.
We will be back and will try to fit them in, next time.
Thanks to everyone at Etna, for making our night, special."
Delicious and authentic Italian,"Went there with colleagues on a Friday for lunch and thoroughly enjoyed the food. The focaccia, stuffed pizza and burrata made for great starters along with a yummy glass of wine. I’m vegetarian so had a classic tomato sauce pasta with asparagus. It was exquisite. Light, well flavoured and just a little creamy with a touch of creme fraiche. I didn’t have room for dessert but will be going back there for sure!"
Felt like I was in Italy,"I have heard great things about this restaurant so tonight we booked in for dinner. It certainly lived up to its reputation. The service was unobtrusive but prompt, pleasant and helpful.
The food was divine. We started with calamari and bread with vinegar and oil. Then we went on to pizza and ravioli and spaghetti for the kids.
I had the veal with foie gras and truffles and it was perfectly cooked, beautifully presented and totally delicious. Will definitely return."
Very satisfied,"I was very satisfied with the food and their service. When I was about to put a scarf on my shoulder, one of the staff asked me about the room temperature, like “If it’s too cold, please let us know.” I was a bit moved by her hospitality."
Average Italian food with average service & poor ambience,"I possibly had too high an expectation as a few people had told me this place is pretty good but....
The decor & ambience is average.
The menu selction is pretty good but the food was average, as was the service.
The wine menu is way over priced."
A very good Italian meal in Singapore,"We had a dinner on Etna on a Saturday night and we got a table in the middle. The sound level was high and the atmosphere was lively. Apart from the menu, there was also some specials of the day and I decided to have lobster ravioli to start with and a truffle risotto as my main. The waiter was helpful with the wine – we just indicated what wine we normally enjoyed and what price level we had in mind and then he recommended a few wines based on that.

The lobster ravioli came served on a long plate and it was quite spectacular. The taste was also great with both lobster and shrimp bits. The risotto was served soon after and had a great scent and taste of the truffle of course but it was a bit more al dente compared to what I prefer and it was not as creamy as expected. But it was still a good risotto but I would have enjoyed a piece of meat on top to make it a bit more filling.

To round of the meal, I chose the tiramisu which is a bit of a safe bet. But this was at least served with crushed pistachio to give it some new and different flavors. And it was indeed a tasty tiramisu.

All in all: a good Italian meal where they seem to focus on good ingredients and they even fly in seafood from Italy. If you are looking for an Italian meal in Singapore, you should take Etna into consideration."
"Great food, great service",Excellent Restaurant specializing in Sicilian dishes. Pizzas are great. Interesting foods and wines at reasonable pricing. Friendly service. It’s become our favorite Italian restaurant in Singapore
Italy in Singapore,"Just a simple restaurant trying to make good Italian food without any Instagram generation frills. The staff is attentive, food is absolutely great. We have always loved Etna and would continue to visit for our special occasions."
Food,I felt the food portion need to be increase a bit. Especially the seafood portion. It's seem really a little especially for set lunch.
Food and service,"I will say the pasta are really good and tasty. The lamb shank is also very tender and soft. However, the swordfish is too dry and tough texture. Will recommend"
Worth a visit,"Heard much about this place so decided to finally go. Was not disappointed. the wine recommendation was great...red wine which was not too strong or full bodied...and a dessert wine which was not too sweet either.
burrata cheese and ham to start was delightful. very fresh and creamy.
had the beef ribs for mains which was tasty and still very tender. Intend to try the steak in future.
dessert was the almond panna cotta with dark chocolate, which i would highly recommend."
Good food,Been awhile since I last came. Food quality is still as good as before. Would love to visit again with friends.
Great Service,We enjoyed a fantastic evening with excellent food and a good bottle of wine to go with it. Service was top notch although the restaurant was really busy. Highly recommended for a good Friday night out after a long week. Thanks Etna !
Average,No longer as good as it used to be. Pasta is still ok but the pizza was just really below average. The appetizer bread was probably the only thing that was really good. Service is good though and the staff are very attentive.
"Excellent food, genuine taste","The Focaccia di Recco is a must-have,as it is the Pizzata: the menu moves from traditional Italian into some innovations, like the cacio e pepe with an orange flavor. Good canteen, service could be a bit faster, but the place was packed."
Great food and atmosphere,I have visited this restaurant a couple of times over the years and the quality of their offering have maintained throughout the years. Really great place to have a date/ meal with friends and family.
Very good experience at Etna as always,Very good experience at Etna as always! The staff was attentive and proactive. We didnt order our usual favorites - pizza - and ordered pasta instead. The portion was that of a primi and hence understandably a bit small as a main...next time I will ask if they can do a proper main course serving size. My carbonara was fine. My wife's aglio olio was a bit underseasoned and a little heavy handed with butter / oil. We'll probably stick with the pizzas in future! :) But v good experience overall as always.
Great Food with Mediocre Service,"Service was poor and service staff did not do a great job to advise if food was sufficient when we were ordering and checking if the food was enough for 14 pax which resulted in too much food. When the food came, waiter did not even bother to inform us what he was serving and simply just placed the food on the table and walk away. When we took away the food and it was wrapped up, we asked the waiter to identify which aluminium foil wrap contained which food item, waiter replied “I’m not so sure, it’s all wrapped up and you have to check it on your own.” Food was not bad though and worth a mention."
Lovely Italian restaurant,"Such a quaint Italian restaurant in the heart of Duxton. I loved how friendly the staff were, especially our waiter. He was great in recommending dishes to me (being lactose intolerant) and my friend (being lactose intolerant and vegetarian). He made sure to check in on us during our meal to ask how we found the food, and at the end to offer us recommendations for dessert. A lovely experience overall and great food!

I had the Crab Linguine, which was a hearty portion of pasta with a spicy tomato and crab sauce. The mini crab was even presented on top of the bowl of pasta. My friend went for a simple tomato pasta with cheese, which looked lovely. To start off, we shared a bread basket, which had my favourite type of bread, focaccia. It had herbs and mushrooms, which was delicious! For dessert, we went for the Panna Cotta. This was a show in itself. The waiter came with our dessert and warm, melted milk/dark chocolate in a small pot. He poured it over the white chocolate dome that surrounded the panna cotta and waited for it to melt enough so that he could open it with his spoon to reveal the panna cotta surrounded in melted chocolate. Beautiful and yummy! It was a light dessert, so a great way to end after a carb loaded meal of pasta and bread."
Lovely ambience and wonderful food and service!,"Whenever I visit Singapore, I would definitely go to Etna. The food, service and ambience is great for couples and families."
Feel like in itsly,"I like eating in an Italian restaurant where staff is Italian, it is the case here. They offer classic but also local specialties. I had a classic pizza 4 cheese but which was absolutely absolutely delicious!"
"Great food, attentive service",Food was great but a tad too much salt for my liking. Very nice atmosphere and attentive stuff. Burrata freshly flown in on Saturday and tasted fantastic!
Food quality is not good,"Food quality is poorer than franchised cheap pasta and pizza restaurant. From the beginning, very unsatisfactory... Bread was cold, center of pizza was soaky and crab was skinny (no meat at all) for crab pasta. No recommendation at all. Pizza was very"
"Good service, fab starter, great pizza","Looked for local eateries to the Carlton City Hotel, and Etna caught my eye. Turned up en spec, and a place was found for me in a pretty bust restaurant, despite the relatively early hour.
Good maitre d', supported by pleasant, efficient and friendly waiting staff.
Nice glass of wine, but both the tuna carpaccio and pizza were fab.
Will return when next in SIN."
Cosy,"You can get a nice hearty Italian meal here in this cosy restaurant. Wood fired pizza, satisfying pasta, great wine, what more can you ask for?"
Anniversary dinner made right,"As my GF and I had our first date in Etna 2 years back, we decided to come back to celebrate our anniversary this year. When we entered, all went well and we were promptly ushered to our table - my GF was a little perplexed when they placed us at a table in the middle of the room (because when we came for our anniversary dinner last year, they made special arrangements to seat us at a corner table. but no biggie since we were here for the food + this place had a special meaning to us).

As usual, food was good. Special mention goes to the Parma ham, mushroom and asparagus risotto (it's part of the special menu for July). Dinner went on uneventfully - we had really nice wine and ice cream after. Again, we were a little bummed that there didn't seem to be an anniversary cake because there was one last year. But since it was a bonus, we just figured maybe the restaurant was too busy this year.

As we were paying the bill, however, one of their servers Connie came up to us and started apologising profusely! She told us that there was a mix up with the seating because there were 2 'Ians' who made reservations that night. So we were given the table meant for the other Ian, while our original table was actually already set aside for us in the corner. They even had cake and aperitif ready for us in the fridge! We were so touched at that point.

While we had the celebratory cake and aperitif a little later than intended, we are still very thankful to Etna for helping us make this occasion a memorable one. Special thanks to Connie also for remembering us and making these arrangements. We will definitely be back (maybe in July for the risotto again), and of course for the many anniversaries to come. Thank you Etna!"
great authentic italian food,"great authentic italian food at a price tho.
Burrata cheese with Parma ham is fantastic and as authentic as it can get.
clams and mussels in white wine broth is not bad but not fantastic.
lobster ravioli and linguine with crab are yummy but i like the lobster ravioli better.
truffle tagliatelle tastes great but oh so rich with the butter.. this has to be shared and not eaten by one.
Tiramisu is good but overrated.. maybe expectations too high from the many excellent reviews.
Service is great and not stifling. I will return when we feel like eating Italian again!"
Nice and fast lunch,"Had a team lunch here and we all selected the set menu. The soup was very tasty and the past I had for main was likewise excellent. For desert there was a tiramisu which was a little untraditional, but possibly even better than the original.
All was served super fast without anything feeling rushed."
Horrible vegetarian lasagna and overpriced food,"I went for a business lunch and paid $160 for 2 pax. The today’s special was a veg lasagna which had no taste other than mashed potatoes. I left it uneaten and when checked by the waitress about the feedback, i was still charged $30++ for the same. I wonder if i would go there again.
Very disappointed for the quality of food and the price charged."

Saturday night dinner,"First Visit. No reservation. Was a last minute decision. Luckily the staff was pleasant when we told her we do not have a reservation. Got a table. Sicilian style kind of food. We ordered and the staffs were all pleasant and smiley. They took the effort to come by occasionally to ask if everything was alright. My Antipasta was served pretty fast. As usual, it’s my Burrata. Lots of rockets which I like. 150g Portion was good for 4. The Seafood pasta was good. Very light, no overwhelming herbs or seafood taste. Overall, the food was great. Ambience was relaxing. No loud music. Will return to try the other dishes soon. Good job to the Chef ( seems that all Italian chefs looks grumpy when they are cooking..hahaha) and staffs."
"Simply said, very satisfying experience","This is the second time I have visited this restaurant in singapore for dinner, what can I say, food is awesome, taste of freshness in food makes the experience that much more incredible, setting is simple, energy is positive, food is very delicious and fresh.
Now, to enhance this to next level order a good wine.
In desert Tiramisu is"
"Fantastic food, excellent atmosphere, and wonderful service!","We enjoyed the calimari, lasagna, and the tiramisu! Visited with family and would recommend. We will definitely return ourselves!"
A little touch of Italy in the heart of Singapore,"We went to this restaurant on a trip for work. Seated outside was fine. Beautiful food and excellent service. Our waiter, Rosario, knew his food and wine. We had different pasta (homemade) dishes which were excellent the Tiramisu stunning. We loved it so much, we know we will be back."
Don't go,"Had to talk to 3 staffs before getting a seat (and I had a booking and was on time!); they forgot to provide towels on the table; had to wait more than 1 hour 45 minutes to get the main; really noisy: way too many tables (to optimise revenue? Bad idea!!) and with music it makes it impossible to just have a conversation if the restaurant is full; the food is not even average quality and the menu has not a lot of choice. Definitely far below Italian standards. Really bad experience, so disappointing in all the aspects."
Wonderful dinner in cool location,"We discovered Etna during our last night in Singapore and were not disappointed. The food was excellent, and the location/ambiance were even better. Duxton Hill is a very cool neighborhood and somewhat off the tourist track in Singapore, which made it even more fun. Highly recommended..."
