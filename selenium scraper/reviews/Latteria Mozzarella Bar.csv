Say ‚ÄúCheese‚Äù with Gusto and Joy!,"Unlike most diners, I actually went to Latteria's Mediterranean sister restaurant Thirty9 first before coming to here. On my way to Thirty9 and enjoying the feel of walking down the rarely found cobblestone pavement, I took a look at Latteria al fresco dining area, I love the idyllic European vibe of the place, and I made a goal to come here before Chinese New Year. And I did, right on CNY eve and got a nice surprise here

Since at a Mozzarella Bar, I know I got to order some wet cheese balls, which are this place's speciality‚Äìcan hardly get them elsewhere in Singapore. I opt for Burratina Affumicata, which is Smoked Burrata with Porcini Mushrooms and Basil Pesto.

I want to try this since I have never eaten burratina or burrata in its entirety before. This is mozzarella cheese wrapping around a creamy filling of curb and fresh cream. I love this at first bite because it is so creamy and buttery with an iota of milky, grassy flavour plus stretchy texture from the mozzarella. The smoked surface of the burratina adds an extra dimension to the taste. The creaminess of the cheese goes excellently well with the strong flavours of tangy tomatoes, earthy taste of mushrooms and the pungent basil pesto. A dish full of zest and flavours.

For pasta, I get Linguine al Granchio since I like its ingredients of Crab Meat and Mascarpone. This is fresh Tomato Sauce added too for the zest in taste. Rich in taste due to the mascarpone, this is pure comfort food. I actually prefer linguine over spaghetti since the flat surface of the linguine yield a smoother feel when eating it. Personal preference, of course. The restaurant is pretty generous with the shredded crab meat. And besides the shredded meat, I can actually find morsels of sweet briny crab meat, which is a delight to savour.

Despite being pretty full‚Äìdue to the generous portions of food, I still make some space in my tummy for Latteria‚Äôs Cheesecake. This is an awesome combination of Buffalo Ricotta Cheese for creaminess and light nutty flavour, Lemon for zest, Strawberry Compote for tangy taste, Basil-Coulis for extra kick and Strawberry Sorbetto for floral notes in frozen form. Just right in the sweetness and sourness of taste profile, I enjoy this dessert so much.

This is the surprise I'm talking about. I'm so glad that I visit this restaurant before CNY to get this special message. This nice little gesture is so thoughtful.

The al fresco area is perfect for lounging around and enjoying the lush greenery lining the perimeter. Majority of the patrons actually opt for al fresco dining.

The interior of the restaurant is classy and cozy. Great for romantic dates and family gatherings.

I like both the al fresco area and the interior dining area. Both have distinctive styles to make for a very conducive place to enjoy good food. Service is great too, especially the lady staff, who is very friendly and takes the effort to advise me on the portions of the food, which is a huge concern for solo diners like me.

I really like the food here, and it is great place to hang out at to just enjoy good things in life.

Thoughts: Cool place to enjoy Italian fare and specialty of mozzarella"
Will definitely start coming regularly,Hadn't been here for a whole but will start coming more regularly again. Location and ambience is excellent. All of the staff very attentive and friendly. We had lamb shanks and beef cheek.for our mains - both extremely tender and seasoned nicely. Decent wine list - not the cheapest but great value for money. (We had a delightful 2018 Chianti c$120). Recommended
Good Italian food in Singapore,Great food and good service. We had the antipasto plate to share and pastas for mains. At lunchtime they have a fixed price set menu is great value for money. Highly recommended.
Latteria Mozzarella Bar,"The past reviews did not lie! Latteria Mozzarella Bar is a hidden gem, with welcoming staff who seem as if they actually enjoy working here, food that we loved so much that we wanted second‚Äôs, and an enjoyable atmosphere. We will be returning soon!"
Fantastic Experience,"The dinner at Latteria Mozzarella Bar was better than I had imagined it to be. The seating I had requested for was perfect. A nice corner table with an excellent view. The menu is super nice and the service is excellent. Loved the flavours and their set dinner for 4 pax was perfect. We also ordered a really nice bottle of red which was paired beautifully with the elaborate dinner. The appetizer was delicious and so was the mains and the desserts. We will surely be back here again soon, I hope."
"Beautiful space, average food, poor service","The restaurant‚Äôs outdoor space is lovely and it was great for a balmy January evening in Singapore. We had high expectations but the burrata salad was pretty average with the burratta being rather tough. The eggplant parmigiana was tasteless. For the mains the gnocchi sauce was great but the gnocchi itself nothing spectacular.
The waiting staff never popped in to check nor asked us if we wanted a refill of our drinks or water. We paid about SGD200 for the meal for two. Don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be coming back."
Nice Lunch But Place Can Be Noisy,"Back here for lunch after over a year. It was enjoyable and service was warm as usual. The burrata stack was cold and tasty.

I liked my duck ragu pasta, which was full of flavor. The pasta could have been cooked for a few minutes more, as it was on too al dente. The boneless chicken leg was excellent, and was well balanced.

Dessert was okay, and white chocolate panna cotta had a touch of tartness with the berries and passion fruit.

The only negative aspect is how noisy the place can be, even at 3/4 full., so much so that we could hardly hear our waiter, or he us. We could practically listen to conversations going on at the other end of the room, with the way patrons were talking so loudly."
Superb and good value meal - faultless execution!,"Chose this venue as part of Restaurant Week 2021. Every item was beautifully executed and delicious.

Very good value for money - an extra nice touch that coffee and tea was part of the set meal.

Although the place was full, service was efficient and well-timed.

Well deserving of all the other excellent ratings to-date!"
My fav spot in Singapore,"It's hard to find a restaurant like Latteria that consistently gets it right in terms of fantastic food within a cosy setting but above all, hearty customer service where you always feel welcomed and appreciated. I have now tried Latteria's set brunch offering, dinner menu as well as takeaway options and was impressed every single time. Would highly recommend spoiling your tastebuds and go enjoy the Italian hospitality offered by Giusi, Peter and their lovely team."
Italy in Singapore,We've been several times to their beautiful restaurant but now it's lock down. So we ordered delivery brunch and it was amazing. Thank you for the unforgettable italian experience.
The best of Italy üáÆüáπ,Even we are regular I want to applause the delivery during covid time. Not only the food is delicious but Italy is brought to its best. Even in Italy I didn't find so much taste and variety. Thank you for your professionalism.
Lovely Italian serving good food at great value,Wait staff were very efficient with special requests taken into consideration. The stracciatella cheese starter was tasty served with a crisp wafer thin eggplant disc. The taglatelli was rich and delicious with the perfect portion size. The tiramisu was light and delicious and I appreciated the smaller portion size. A bonus was that tea or coffee was served after the meal. It was a pleasant lunch and we weren't made to feel rushed even though we stayed on for a while after lunch.
Wonderful Dining Experience,"Located in one of the quaint shophouses in Duxton hill, the place is surprisingly spacious particularly the outdoor seating. It is next to an open air carpark, although you won‚Äôt be dining with a carpark view as the area is filled with greens and hanging yellow lights exuding a cozy vibe especially at night.

The staff were attentive and not intrusive. The Italian owner was visible on the floor checking on random tables to make sure everything is in place, he even shared to us some information about their food which was a good gesture.

Started off with Aperol sour while waiting for the rest of our friends to arrive. They gave us a plate of bread with balsamic and olive oil dip which we totally enjoyed, was gone in seconds. We tried several appetizers, the Calamari was ok, not the best one, the spicy arrabbiata dip that comes with it was good though. The Prosciutto had that buttery texture, not too salty, just that rich satisfying meaty taste. The Mozzarella di Bufala tasted like soft clouds and paired well with the fresh, juicy cherry tomatoes. What wowed us the most was the Stracciatella Caponata. It is a shredded cow milk mozzarella placed on a bed of arugula and eggplant, sprinkled with pine nuts. The peppery taste of the arugula, the sweetness of the eggplant and the creaminess of the stracciatella worked well together, a must-try! As for the mains, we love the pillowy-soft Gnocchi and the tasty Linguine Crab and Mascarpone. The Roasted Seabass and Tenderloin were equally good too. We capped off dinner with a palate-cleansing Lemon Pannacotta with Balsamic Strawberries and one of the best Tiramis√π which i will order next time for myself, definitely not sharing :P

Overall, it was a very wonderful dining experience. We‚Äôll be back soon."
Wonderful Evening and experience,"I recall I was here few years ago. Was not impressed as their wine by the glass were pretty awful back then. We give it a go again this time and I was very impressed. We'd outdoor seats which are perfect! Ambience was cozy and nice. Owner was very attentive. Staff are all very helpful. We had a bottle of LIVIO FELLUGA TERRE ALTE - excellent. Starter Burrata cheese and prawns are soooo good. Our main course 2 different types of fish are excellent too. Should have just 1 starter to share as I've difficulty finish my main course.
Overall a very lovely evening, great ambience, food and wine. I can't wait to be back again."
Nice Lunch,"Our family had a nice lunch at Latteria yesterday. Food was tasty with generous portion. Our favourites would be the Stacciatella cheese with eggplant, Barramundi Fillet and Tiramisu.

The restaurant was full house and there seemed to be short of staff (.....understandably as it was a day before New Year's Eve) but the staff did well even on a busy day like this.

Most outstanding would be Mr Linsel who served with a smile and charm and plenty of humour. He made the whole experience of dining in Latteria very pleasant and enjoyable for us. Thank you!!"
Ambience,"The restaurant ambience was nice, we loved the gnocchi pasta the sauce was tasty. The linguine crab pasta was also a contender."
Restaurant Week #3 - Eggxcellent!,Lovely tucked away along a pedestrian only street behind Duxton Hill carpark - very friendly and helpful wait staff. The RW offerings were excellent. The eggplant caponata with stracciella cheese was delightful and light. We chose to try the in-house hand made tagliatelle with wild mushrooms did not disappoint - generous serving of mushrooms too. We will have to return to try more of their menu soon!
Perfect italian,"We ordered a linguini vongole and the gnocchi, and both dishes were perfect. It was like eating in italy!"
A great evening - but need to think more about pregnant customers,"Had dinner here with the wife and another couple, and they have put a lot of work in to social distancing rules. The quality of the food was good, some of the best Italian food I have had in Singapore.

Service was a little iffy, both my wife and her friend are in their final trimester of pregnancy and only really had high chairs available for us, would have been better if they provided normal chairs with more air con, but they tried to make up for this by bribing over extra cushions etc to make her as comfortable as possible.

Great atmosphere and environment for a fun Saturday night double date though, will certainly be back again."
wonderful place! good service and food!,It was a good experience and lovely evening! I like the ambience and a friendly service! Food was in a good level as well! quite a central location with indoor or outdoor seating! cheers!
Truly Italian food and excellent service,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants in Singapore. The cheese, the cold cuts, the vegetables and the pasta are really awesome. On top of that, the service remains very attentive."
Good for Mozzarellas and Italian food lovers,"I invited a friend for a lunch at the Lateria to appease my mozzarellas cravings
The restaurant is situated in a very charming neighbourhood and the outdoor sitting area is really cosy

My friend is Chinese and not a big cheese fan but she adored the food there especially the buratta. Overall all the dishes we tasted were good and the portions quite big so we felt very full and satisfied at the the end of our lunch

It's a good address to visit preferably on lunch quite times"
Nice Evening,"We had dinner at this restuarant last night. The location and ambience was very good. The service and friendliness of the staff was excellent. We were on the restaurant week promo so we had a set meal. The two starters were very good and the two main course options were fish and beef cheek. Fish was fresh and well presented, beef cheek was rich and full of taste but woud have benefited from a little more slow cooking as it was not as tender as usual. The choclate/almond cake for desert was a little dispappointing, however in taking into cosideration the price of the meal perhaps my expectations were a lttle high. We had a carafe of the house Pinot Grigio which was reasonably priced and very drinkable. Overall a good restaurant in a nice location which I would not hesitate to recommend for a nice evening out"
Lovely and warm service,"Service was excellent and the staff were warm and welcoming. The food was okay, and the speed of service was good. The best dish, we both felt, was the starter of stewed tomatoes, which was tart yet sweet and went well with the arugula. I had sea bass as my main dish - it was okay but I thought it was a chance wasted yo have a nicely grilled crispy skin. Of course, that is a personal preference. My wife went for the chicken, but felt it was dry. The dessert of chocolate cake was a tad hard but okay with the tea or coffee. We loved the decor, especially the lovely floor tiles."
Mozzarellas & Burrata!!!,"This restaurant serving South Italian cuisine is definitely a must visit if you love mozzarella and burrata cheese. They import their own, twice a week direct from Italy! You can‚Äôt get any fresher then this! The chefs then whip up different dishes using the cheeses. We had the one served on top of spinach and sun dried tomatoes - it was delicious!
They also have an extensive traditional Italian menu, like pasta, cold cuts which were all very well cooked. We especially love our seafood linguine and the sirloin steak done medium.
The interior of the restaurant is simple but chic, and they also have a lovely alfresco terrace.
The wine selection though affordable by restaurant standards, are not great, but very drinkable.
Overall, we had a great meal here. Try it!"
Authentic Italian Restaurant,Good Italian food at reasonable prices. Was there for lunch with friends and the set lunch options were great.
Nice atmosphere; average food and service,"We enjoyed the atmosphere of this restaurant - where we sat outside. Food was distinctly average, however. For example, I doubt if the pasta was homemade. Service not great either."
Great location and ambience,"Came on a Saturday night for dinner with my wife. Had reserved a table but it was not necessary as the place was half full at most. Lots of tables outside, but there was also indoor seating. The outside terrace is just great, nice location!
Mozzarella is the speciality it seems. We tried the bufala for starters, it was good. Gnocchi and roasted fish as main course. All good, fast service, good wine list too. Extra points for service- some of the portions are quite big and the waitress proactively gave suggestions for optimal amount of food instead of just selling as much as possible.
Opposite this place there's a bar - not part of this restaurant, but next time we may have a drink there first, looked great for pre-drinks.
Will come again!"
Very good beef,"A nice place and we found a good food. We ordered bruschetta with tomatoes, Australian beef steak, ice cream and tiramisu. The beef mear was ok, good prepared, the ice cream good as well, very tasty mascarpone from tiramisu but the biscuit a little bit to moist. We wish to come back when possible. Services very good."
Coffee and dessert,We arrived for just coffee and dessert at the end of a busy service and the staff could not have been more helpful and accommodating.. changing tables and explaining all the options. We will be back to try the menu!
Always good!,"Probably the restaurant with the best alfresco location in Singapore, it has a great variety of mozzarella cheese, always fresh and well served. I personally love the bocconcini in carrozza and the stracciatella. Pasta is also good and portions are big.
Service is kind and attentive.
Very recommended!"
Very good food,"Italian food here is very good. The Puglia burrata especially deserves special mention. So soft and fluffy. The barramundi and steak were also quite exceptional. Disappointment for me was the gnocchi, not as soft as I hoped it would be. Service is friendly. A little high end so be prepared to pay."
great place for open air drinks,"nice place to catch up with networking, not too busy and outside is nice and chilled good service although only one beer on draft and no pizzas"
Bad Service,"We were waiting on our table for friends for 40 minutes and nobody was motivated to take an order from us. So we waited till our friends arrived to place an order. I was just curious to see if they would ever ask at all if we would like to order something, which they didnt.
This was the second time that this happened to us at latteria. The service is a desaster. It was a good restaurant back in the years when they had italian restaurant managers.
Now it just expensive thats all.
They will never see me again!"
Alfresco dining,"Was back again to expreience the nice setting in the outdoor area. It has a soothing ambience with low lighting and pleasant atmosphere where conversations flow easily.
The appetizer was of a generous portion for sharing.
The grilled sirloin was nicely done to the point and the red wine did a wonderful job in complement.
Don't forget the tipsy tiramisu cup that brought another satisfied smile for the entire dining expreience."
Good ambience average food,"We went to this place with friends and family to celebrate a birthday. The ambience is cool but foid was very average . The burata was hard, prawns were confused, the spaghetti was too saucy and gnocchi was bland."
Overpriced but great location,"I went because I love the location, i was thoroughly disappointed by the food.

The mozzarella was fine. Presented in a careless manner
The pasta was just terrible. Everything seems baked and creamy. Heavy and over cooked.

For 30 sgd for the pasta I wanna coextensive much more than a cheesy creamy mess.

Location and patio get 5 stars
Service 3 stars
Food 2 stars"
A nice birthday dinner,"Our group had a birthday dinner here and it was a good experience overall. The Chianti was nice and starters were good, but the mains (pastas, to be specific) were somewhat underwhelming. Highlight of the night was definitely the pre-ordered tiramisu birthday ""cake"", which was perfect! Service was adequate and one middle-aged Chinese lady took care of us pretty well."
Disappointing,"We were two friends and went to Latteria Mozzarella bar for dinner. We found the food quite disappointing, especially the mozzarella which I was not better than any random mozzarella I would buy at the supermarket! It was served too cold and hard. Even the olive oil was quite tasteless, not sure it was extra virgin.
Than we had pasta which was ok.
All in all I don‚Äôt think it deserves all the fuss."
Excellent food ; exceptional service,"We were well advised and decided to have an array of starters - bottacini, grilled prawns and tomato soup ; topped with Prosecco and lemon sorbet made for a great memorable meal. The food was delicious , flavourable and fresh. The service was outstanding - knowledgeable , kind and accommodative . Sitting outdoor -beautiful ambience and a great place for a family celebration. Will be back again"
It was good,"Location was great for outdoor seating.Ordered Eggplant Parmigiana it was served generously taste is ok. What I really love is the Linguine Vongole it taste fantastic and I love it.I will come back for this. Ordered Pork Milanese as well but bread crumbs are just too much not to taste the pork on it. Pork was really thin with too much of bread crumbs.
Overall experience was good service was average."
Latteria Mozzarella Bar,"This place is my favourite Italian place, especially the crab meat pasta and Mozzarella cheese. Every visit I will definitely place the order. I brought my friends and nieces to this place and their comments was really good, would highly recommend friends to this place.
Their service are also good, very friendly and take effort to explain and give recommendation of their specialty."
The Best,"Latteria Mozzarella Bar was fantastic . You must book to avoid dissapointment. I ordered the Crab linguine my husband ordered the Snapper, for entree we had the parma ham and fresh Mozzarella cheese. 10/10 cooked to perfection. The service was wonderful and the atmosphere was great. I can't stress highly enough how wonderful this restaurant is, We sat inside to avoid the heat. Duxton Hill was a great area to visit and I will definitely be returning ."
Best Italian Place in Town,"Good Food, Phenominal service with a twist of Humour, Really a great place to celebrate any kind of occasion! Kudos Team Latteriaüòòüòò"
Wonderful Mozzarella and nice atmosphere,"Visited Latteria Mozzarella Bar with a few colleagues and had the most wonderful Mozzarella and ham plate to share as starter. I love Mozzarella but this was so good that I had to order a small piece to go with the main course as well... was so euphoric over the Mozzarella that I have totally forgotten what else I had to main course but I recall it was not bad that either. Note they do not have pizzas.

Atmosphere is relaxed and cosy in this area of Singapore and especially when you have a table outside. Service was fast and friendly with a twist of humour.
I warmly recommend Latteria and when you visit them, do not forget to order Mozzarella!"
magical brunch,"wow this is an amazing brunch, service, outside atmosphere, food, wines, what more could you want great value for money too amazed there weren't more people there I'll be back"
Great Italian food,Good ambience. Quality food. Great service. The home made pasta was very good. So good that I forgot to take a photo before tucking into the dish Will be back to try more.
One of Fav Italian Restaurant,"Love the mozzarella dishes and sea bass, which is very fresh and succulent. Once, I bought the mozzarella and told them it‚Äôs to bring overseas for my friend who loves it. They were very nice and packed the ingredients separately!"
What a wonderful evening!,"We had a lovely evening at Latteria Mozarella Bar. The food and the wine were excellent - best burrata I‚Äôve ever had, delicious pasta and outstanding gnocchi. The service was super friendly and did a great job. We loved the beautiful, specious terrace that gave us a real Italian feeling. We‚Äòll definitely come back."
Lush garden with Italian food and friendly vibe,In the lush gardens of Duxton this restaurant offers great Italian foods and drinks. Very chill vibe and friendly staff. A place for Friends or even a business lunch. I like the decoration and design.
Good Italian restaurant,"This is the first time I tasted their food. Burrata and pasta with seafood and shrimps. Burrata was really delicious. Pasta was, how it was supposed to be. Good ambiance, I suggest to reserve a place. Price higher range."
One of our favorite restaurant in Singapore,"The atmosphere is just perfect: beautiful little garden, not too noisy, staff is super friendly. The food is Italian and really good. But don't expect to eat pizza! Here is all sorts of mozzarella, burrata etc. And of course large choice of pasta, fish and delicious meet. Perfect for a lovely couple dinner. Only the desert choice is quite small - but anyway we are always full after the main course!

The Sunday brunch is amazing too: quite cheap for the large amount of greta food you get!"
Lovely Restuarant in Good Setting,We had a lovely evening meal earlier this month. The food was good and the service excellant. It is very pleasant to sit out in a lovely garden setting downtown Singapore. Served by our Waiter - Linsel who went out of his way to ensure we had a lovely evening. Highly ecommended
Nice place and concept but food is just ok,"The idea behind the bar is great, and the actual place itself is quite charming, but unfortunately the food is just ok. We tried several of their burratas and straciatelas, and also some of the pasta and to be honest nothing was outstanding."
Birthday Visitüíó,"Recommended by a Friend almost a year ago.
We forgot all about it, until it was my Birthday again. So we decided, let's give it a go and it was marvellous.
Great romantic outdoor seating
(I love outdoor settings)
Perfect to host an event if they accept!
We were served by an Indian Gentleman,
(sorry didnt catch his name) but he was helpful and kind. I spilled my wine while taking pictures, of cos how clumsy can I Not be on My very Own Birthday. Broke the wine glass, and had no wine left to drink even. Left me losing my smile for a few seconds, right after they came to check on us whether we were fine not hurt, our gentleman who was taking care of us came to me with a glass of wine. My eyes instantly lit up returning back to smiling once again, that was just beyond words.
Amazing Food with Impressive Service
We with more Friends will definitely be Back to try more amazing dishes on the menu.

We Tried:
Tiramisu (on the house as a Birthday Treat) Grazie Mille
Linguine Crab & Mascarpone
Burratina Zucca, Roast Pumpkin & Truffle

Grilled Pork ‚ÄòSpiral‚Äô Sausage, Truffle Mashed Potatoes"
Lovely restaurant for Sunday lunch,"If you‚Äôre a tourist, the duxton neighbourhood is an absolute must visit to get a glimpse of Singapore‚Äôs historical architecture. The entire area of shophouses is gazetted and their facades tirelessly maintained to showcase what our ancestors built and lived in.

Have lunch (there‚Äôs a set lunch on Sundays!) at Latteria before walking around. Even though it‚Äôs an expatriate hangout and maybe 20% of their diners are actually local Singaporeans, their menu is decent and the al fresco tables face a charming little garden.

After lunch, stroll down the hill to Littered with Books- a cosy little bookstore with interesting collection of titles."
A good place to chill and observe,"Good food , a nice casually relaxed atmosphere . In and out dining options with a large courtyard at the top of the hill . Seems to be popular with local residents which is always good sign ."
Worst service! Beautiful location!,"The restaurant nestled in Charming Duxton Hill looked inviting. Out with my adult teenager, we were looking to spend some quality time and enjoy awesome food as well!

However, the service was absolutely pathetic. When we asked for recommendations from their server ‚ÄòAchid‚Äô on which Burrata to order, he had no suggestions whatsoever. We ordered the barrage with pumpkin and the bruschetta. Both were very average, although I loved the presentation.

We asked for the menu to order mains. While my Daughter and I were talking, Achid spoke to another server referring to our table and a few seconds later whisked the menu away. Taking that as an indication of not being welcome, we left without any dinner!!

A serious disappointment to what we hoped would be a lovely evening! Such a cold place, I wouldn‚Äôt go there again"
Horrible customer service,"I had called the restaurant to make a reservations earlier. Rude, poor attitude when taking my call. Will consider going to this restaurant."
Very nice meal on terrace,"Overall very nice experience. on the terrace for Saturday night dinner. Service very quick at the beginning but then slowed down quite a bit when service started for a wedding party and another table of 12. Waiter did not share with us any specials of the night. Cheese appetizer very good (large portion!). Also ordered Mac&Cheese, Lamb shanks (very large portion!) and beef sirloin. All very well prepared and presented. A highlight on Duxton Hill."
Nice Italian place,"Located in the Dutton Hill area, walking distance from downtown or Chinatown. Definitely a nice place. Some of the mozzarella antipasti are huge, read the menu or get surprised:), it might be more suitable for sharing. Desserts are quite big too, not exactly Italian sizes:). Sea bass was fresh from Malaysia. Some Italian staff, hence you can practice your Italian. Would go back for sure."
Amazing Mozzarella Bar,I really recommend this place for mozzarella. The other meals are average. Always have a nice time and you won't be disappointing with the food. There's also a brunch - the amount of food is definitely too much for a regular person.
Hidden pearl just outside the city centre,"Super cozy Italian restaurant that has both indoor and outdoor seating (outdoors was so beautiful with all the lights in the trees). The food was amazing in every way, the gnocchi with mushrooms and truffle cream sauce is a must if you visit this place! The falvours were something extra and the wine we were recommended complemented the food perfectly.

The place was full of people but you never got the feeling that it was loud or crowded, somehow it felt like we were alone even though we were surrounded by other tables. The staff were super friendly and happily answered all possible questions we had about the menu (some dishes were in Italian so if you don't know your cheese and meat you might have to ask a question or two). They have a whole section of the menu just for different types of cheese dishes, the mozarella with fig sauce was delicious!

I'm definitely going back before I leave Singapore, so nice to have something other than chicken rice and noodles!"
Excellent Indoor and Alfresco Italian Restaurant,Excellent Italian food with a beautiful green setting. The alfresco area still offers shade and fans - ideal for friends and families or even a business lunch (aircon inside). Highly recommend.
Stumbled upon a gem,"stumbled on this place after dinner when we were looking for a place to drink and have some desserts. offers both indoor and outdoor seating.

primarily an Italian restaurant going by the name, the food menu looks interesting and good but we were out of capacity. ordered some wines, Tiramisu and ice-cream. Tiramisu serving was huge and delicious. nice ambience for a friend's gathering and catch up.

will come back to try the food again."
Solid Italian fare with pleasant outdoor seating,"I have been here several times. This week it was better than before.

The starters are all excellent, particularly those that feature mozzarella. I had the Parma ham and mozzarella and enjoyed it.

For a main we were onto a lamb shank. It was a very large portion. The lamb fell off the shank and had just the right tenderness. The sauce was a bit overpowering, but the dish worked.

I also like their wine list. There are some excellent choices that are not too expensive given Singapore‚Äôs insane wine prices.

This is the place to come on a nice evening with friends to enjoy a very nice dinner at a fair price."
"Nice location, food is ok, but not extraordinary","Ok, first of all, I'm European, so saying the Italian food isn't extraordinary might not be super fair for an Italian place in Singapore.
The location is very nice, maybe even a bit romantic. The mozzarella based starters are delicious, I had the spaghetti with seafood, was ok, but not extraordinary."
Great Italian in the heart of SINGAPORE,"Latteria serves the most authentic and good quality Italian food on Duxton Hill. I extremely loved the grilled seabass, pasta bake and linguine with crab and mascarpone. The tiramisu is extremely heavenly too and comes in a good size portion. Definitely will be back for more!!!"
Authentic and affordable Italian cuisine,"Latteria Mozzarella Bar Located at 40 Duxton Hill, Singapore. It‚Äôs a modern, stylish, inner-city restaurant. With both indoor and outdoor seating. Offers authentic and affordable Italian cuisine, their menu featuring a variety mozzarella and cheese air flown from Italy, and range of pastas, and dessert. The food that we ordered was all outstanding and off course cooked to perfection. Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night, beautiful ambience and gorgeous food. Would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will definitely come back. Very soooon."
awesome service and great food,"Latteria mozzarella was located in duxton, a little hard to get to and an uphill climb but it was worth it! there was an indoor and outdoor sitting area, the outdoor area was very pretty with the fairy lights!

the food was very good, portion sizes were huge. we tried the crab linguine and the mac and cheese, both were so good. for dessert we had tiramisu that was so yummy. highly recommended to go in a group because the portion sizes were big."
Still THE Best Italian in Singapore!!!,The quality of the food? The service? The freshness of the airflown mozzeralla? The whole package has and continues to be perfect with Dan in charge. Arigattogozaimatsu-D-san We look forward to btanches in Japan - esp Okinawa!
Try it,"Went 3 times to this place in Duxton hill.
Amazing terrace outside. Very romantics and ideal for a dinner with a group of friends.
The mozzarella was good but price are expensive for the quantity.
If you like mozzarella and Italian food try it for the atmosphere but not the best Italian in town."
Lovely Setting and great food!,"Really nice ambiance, you would not know you are in a large city, being tucked away at the top of Duxton Hill. We really enjoy ordering the appetizer mozzarella dishes, with our favorites being the stracciatella and the dish with the pumpkin. We also love the pumpkin macaroni and cheese! I crave it! Overall, would recommend."
Best Brunch !!!,"What a place to have a delightful brunch.
Every sunday you will have a special selection for a really affordable price:
Starter, mains and dessert : you will share everything on the table.
Definitely you will not leave the place still hungry.
Last sunday we have share 4 starters, 3 mains including beef and salmon and then 3 desserts per person !The price is ridiculous compare to the quality.
It was really quiet inside on sunday and the staff was absolutely friendly.

Thanks for this experience, will come back again !"
Good Quality food with good service from a friendly staff,Wonderful experience dining here on a Sunday brunch. Very good quality food. Not cheap but on a pricey side. But the Ambience food and service makes it worth going again.
Nice ambiance,Nice place. You can sit inside and outside. The food was good but not special. The waiters were friendly. Location is good. Surrounded by many bars and restaurants.
The Best :),"A lovely, cosy restaurant with a nice terrace. I was happy with all the food that we ordered, everything was deliciously fresh! Service staff was pleasant. i would definitely come back for more. My favorites are the 'Affumicata Porcini Mushrooms' and the 'Roasted Red Snapper Fillet, Sauteed Tuscan Kale, Smoked Peppers Puttanesca Sauce'. I love this place!"
Thanks to my friend for this recommendation,"We were here for Christmas eve dinner and were seated inside the restaurant. There is also alfresco outdoor dining to choose from. Food price is mid high, and service was good. We were recommended the 300g Burrata from Puglia and it was really good. Then we added a mozzarella with parma ham which was not too nice though compared to the milky burrata. The lamb shank with 2 large shanks priced at $38, is a huge portion but was not sufficiently flavored. The baked egg plant parmigiana ($22), was delicious. The baked penne was wonderful too. To complete our meal, we ordered some desserts, and the tiramisu and meringue was the best i have ever tasted."
Great mozzarella,"Layout of the restaurant is nice, both inside and outdoors. Food is all very good. There is a wide choice of mozzarella dishes to choose from. Their mains are also delicious, especially the osso bucco. Staff are friendly and very attentive too."
Best Hearty Italian meal of all times,Every trip to Singapore is not complete without coming to Latteria! It's still the best and non pretentious Italian in town. The 300g burrata and sweet peppers is the ultimate go to and their porcini mushroom pasta bake is yummyyyy!! Thank you once again for the wonderful meal! And special thanks to the service crew for hydrating me (was under the weather)..
Our favourite Italian in Singapore,"Ask for a table outside, and enjoy the atmosphere. Gardens like these are far apart in downtown Singapore. Have visited here many times, and always get a reminder why we keep coming back... Try the Gnocchi and the Tiramisu - and everything else. And not too expensive. Love this place."
Easy place with small and interesting menu,"Location is nice, and food is good. Who likes mozzarella is recommended place. Service not excellent but acceptable."
Good but nothing inventive,"We went there cos most of the restaurant in the area were closed on a Sunday night. The menu is large but nothing impressive on it. As nothing attracted us in the main section we decided to share different starter. Most of the starter are made with mozzarella (mozza bar) and they all seem the same without much imagination. Dishes were good but made me feel they were overpriced. From an italian restaurant/bar i would have expected more originality in the dishes.
Wine selection was fine and we enjoyee a good Chianti. We overall spent a good evening but even if we had a good food quality, i rate only 3 stars because of the selection of dishes."
Sunday Brunch,"We have been to Latteria three times now and always enjoy the food and service
Went today to try their brunch option which is based on a sharing concept
The food was well presented and very tasty as always with a selection of appetisers,mains and deserts
All good though for those who don‚Äôt have a sweet tooth there needs to be a savoury desert option say a cheese platter

The free flow Prosecco was very good value at 20$ a head
Daniel was an excellent host and prepared a special desert for my wife‚Äôs birthday"
Disappointed with food and staff,"We were there either on 2nd Sept. My daughter was visiting from Melbourne and we decided to take her to Latteria Mozza. The Burrata was fantastic as always. My husband ordered the Scampi for the main course. When the dish arrived there was no meat in the scampi and the shell was dry. My husband called a waiter to tell him that there was no meat in the scampi and the waiter said ""This is what Scampi is"" Having lived in Australia for many years and have eated Scampi almost every week, we felt disappointed with the attitude. Not a word of sorry -nothing"
"Good enough, but not outstanding","Some friends suggested to have dinner here on a weekday. Surprisingly full, with many Westerners and almost no locals. Place was a bit loud to have a decent conversation, although outdoors, but ambience was nice.

Food ordered was Gnocchi with Truffle Oil. Not easy to find good gnocchi in the region, and this one passed. But other than that nothing too special. I did hope for a bit more for a relatively pricey menu.

Staff were friendly and overall service was good."
Naples in Asia,When a bunch of friends dragged me to this joint I feared the worst. Mozzarella in Singapore outside a mall under scorching heat and humidity? Actually this place sports eight or nine different mozzarella presentations all of them surprisingly good. The rest of the fare is correct. Wonderful outside sitting was it not for the 90% humidity
one of the best Buffalo Mozzarella dishes in town,great place to sit outside on the terrace and eat fresh Mozzarella. The Pasta dishes and whole fish is highly recommend too.
Great outdoor patio to have dinner in Duxton Hill,A nice Italian restaurant in Duxton Hill with indoor and outdoor eating area. My preference is the outdoor patio. With fans its a nice atmosphere. There is a paid parking lot within 30 feet from the restaurant that is nice. The menu has steak \ seafood and of course pasta. The portions are on the large side and the pasta tends to be on the rich side. You don't walk away hungry. They have a number of Mozzarella dishes which are all really great.
Monday Night,"The night we visited the restaurant, the place is not crowded but very noisy. We can't have a decent conversation, so we asked to be transferred to the table at the corner. Food is nice but pricey. Service is very good."
Wonderful,The atmosphere was amazing. The food fresh and delicious. We enjoyed this restaurant very much! Definitely going back.
"Nod bad, not bad, but nothing special","I had a business dinner in Latteria. Maybe it is my fault, but I cannot remember any special food or wine. It has two meanings: it was not awfully bad or extremely yummy. The service was ok; sitting outside in garden was pleasant."
Satisfying Italian fare!,"Good valued meal at our favourite Italian joint with good friends to mark the Restaurant Week! We choose from the set lunch menu. The appetiser, main meal and dessert were very satisfying. The bread was crunchy. Service and ambience were excellent."
A nice restaurant,The food and the service was very good and the ambience of the restaurant was great. I definitely would like to visit the restaurant again.
Sunday Brunch with pairing wines,"Service, not great! Food ok not exactly fine dining, but for the price acceptable. Staff, not the friendliest, it was my Mother's Day treat.... won't be returning"
favorite place in town,"Last visit was 6 months ago and I must say that I was really happy to go there again.

Restaurant was packed and we could not be seated outside. Reservation is a must there.

Food was excellent , specially the mac & cheese on a fresh pumpkin."
A nice set up but food with no specific interest,"Went there on a busy Saturday night.
Had the chance to eat outside. Inside was definitely super busy and noisy, whereas the outside terrace is quite charming.
Had 2 pastas and 2 glasses of wine for over 100 $.
Pastas were OK but really not up to their price.
Service was OK.
Would we go back ?
Liked the area, but found it overpriced for what you get, so most probably not."
great place to hold a private event,"we were looking for a place to throw a large family oriented event and found Latteria to be perfect.
- we knew the food is very good from previous visits to the restaurant (i am vegetarian so have less choice than my wife does). they managed to replicate the quality also with a crowed of 110 people.
- the setting is perfect - about half the guests were kids and young teens that could go out and safely play; in doors also had great ambiance
- service was wonderful - before and during the event. ask for Daniel, he is absolutely lovely!
the event was a week ago, and we are still getting compliments about the great place and terrific food.

highly recommended.

additional notes: The place also let us add some personal touch to the decoration which was also great."
Vegetarians beware!,"I was assured that the pasta of the day gnocchi was vegetarian, only for me two spoonfuls in to realize the sauce was Bolognese. I barely even got an apology. 15 years in Singapore and this has never happened to me. Terrible service."
Southern Italy style,"Well seems we found our happiness. first of all the terrace is splendid in such a wonderful weather like Singapore, where the street is accessible for pedestrian.only, with a parking lot is a proximity. Food wise go for the truffles Ravioli. They are excellent. The service and all employees very nice. If you still have space tiramisu is excellent. Nice selection of wine to pair with your food. Just to tell you that we went 4 times during our stay (12.16-01.17) and next trip in April they will see us again for sure."
