Delicious!,It was a pleasant dining experience. It was especially heartening to see the staff giving their level best to meet the customers' expectations. Their passion was palpable.
Food not as good as thought !,"Really very disappointed with the Peking Duck. Firstly, the skin to wrap the duck was cold and was wrapped very loosely. The sauce inside the wrapped skin was not sufficient. There is no extra serving of sauce on the table like most restaurant do that. The duck skins itself was not nice. The side dish - silver fish was very salty. The E-FU noodles was not nice and tasty. Overall was very disappointed."
Lint from napkins,Brought the family here for Dim sum lunch. Recommend not to wear dark coloured clothes because the napkin left a lot of white lint on my shirt. Maybe the restaurant can provide a lint remover or look into the state of their napkins.
Unpleasant Dining Experience,"The food was nice however the dining experience was not very pleasant as the staff clear the plate without asking, i still need the plate, the staff should have ask first before clearing them. They keep clearing the plate non stop without asking which is very pressuring to leave the restaurant quickly which does not justify the value of the price with the service they offer."
Nice Ambience,Food and service was good. Quite place to have a good meeting though spotted a gentlemen picking his nose and swing of his nose picking by the side of his seat and a lady picking her teeth without covering her mouth. Lucky we had finish our lunch.
Good Ambience & Decent Food,"The place was cozy, good for catch up over meal. Food was decent, except the Peking Duck, which was not exactly hot when served to us. Overall not too bad for my experience here. Just that the staff are very eager to clear the plates once they see that its almost empty."
Disappointing experience,"Came here to celebrate my partner’s birthday but we were extremely disappointed by the whole experience. Considering the high price point of this restaurant, we were expecting delicious food and good service. Unfortunately, the restaurant fell flat on both fronts. The food we had was extremely mediocre. We ordered their signature peking roast duck, superior chicken broth with fish maw, claypot prawns with fish maw and vermicelli, and a stir-fried kai lan. Out of all the dishes, we only found the claypot prawns with fish maw and vermicelli good. We found the soup too salty and the texture of the wrap provided for the Peking duck dish too thick. The service provided was also so bad for a high-end restaurant that we were both shocked. From the moment we stepped in, we felt extremely unwelcome by the staff there. After bringing us to our table, the male server just walked off without even bothering to tell us that we were supposed to scan a QR code to access the e-menu. The QR code was displayed on a tiny decorative plant on the table which was not obvious at all. If we were not observant, we would have completely missed it and still be sitting there like idiots waiting for physical menus that we would rightly assume that he would be bringing to us. We don’t have a problem with e-menus at all but the least the staff could do was to inform us about it when they seat us. The server also seemed very unfriendly and impatient while taking our order and serving us the dishes. He did not smile or make any eye contact at all. When serving the dishes, they just dropped off the dish near the edge of the table and walked away immediately. No effort was made to even just say the name of the dish or place the dish closer to us to make it easier for us. The vibe that we got from the service staff throughout the dinner was that they just couldn’t wait for us to leave. We initially wanted to order dessert but eventually decided against it because we felt so unwelcomed by the staff. It was really such a disappointing birthday experience and I feel like we paid such high prices for nothing when there are many better Chinese restaurants around. We definitely won’t be coming back after this experience."
Appalling lunch service,"No greeting at our arrival set the tone for our final meal in Singapore. No printed menus were provided and the supplied QR code was difficult to scan in the poor light. We chose the lunch set menus and asked for oolong tea and was delivered jasmine tea.
The food was good but the pacing of the dishes was poor. The dim sum was delivered to cool at the table while we finished our soup.
After the final course we were informed that the register was closing and we needed to pay. It seemed we were an inconvenience and they would have preferred we ate somewhere else. Rest assured we won't be returning."
Feedback for improvement,"Don't enjoy the lunch at all. I have made this reservation a month ago for a birthday celebration. To my disappointment, the table that was assigned to me was in the middle section next to the counter. All 4 or 5 tables in that middle section was empty except the table was assigned to my family. The service was very poor. Waited for almost an hour before the mains where served and most of the dishes were very salty and bland. The dishes were not well presented especially the dim sum trio. Overall experience was very poor!"
unfriendly service,We went there for dinner and were not friendly received at all. The food was good but the service gave you the feeling that you are not welcome. We will not go back again
Absolutely the worst Dim Sum and services experience at the Yan Cantonese Cuisine restaurant,"Though restaurant was less then half full it took significant amount of time to get service.
We ordered Dim Sum as described in menu:
1. Steamed Fresh Prawns Dumplings - dumplings were brought cold and did not taste as freshly prepared from fresh prawns or freshly steamed. In addition no condiments like soya sauce where offered and no server in site to ask for.
2. Pan-fried Carrot cake with Chinese Sausage was cold and tasteless
3. Shanghai Buns cold not freshly prepared and tasteless
4. Steamed Chicken Feet, though brought very hot but was chewy and tasted as fast reheated dish.
5. Spring rolls came as freshly prepared dish and reasonably tasty

The only good quality was bottle of San Pellegrino and
Pumpkin Broth with Crab meat.
We could not stop anyone to raise our concern about food.
It took also too long to pay the bill, so we could leave."
Pleasant Dining Experience and Amazing Quality of Food,"We went there during lunch time, the ambience was pleasant, the staff was polite and attentive to our request, and the food quality was amazing. The meat of the pecking duck we chose to be prepared with ginger and spring onion style, and it's really one of the best I've ever tasted. As for the vermicelli prawn and fish maw in the claypot, though it's nice and tasty but honestly it's a bit pricey. All the soups were very good. Overall it's a very good decision to dine here. Will come back again."
Marvellous,Mr Seek or Mr Set hs been a great host and recommended us perfect dish and we enjoyed all his recommendation. He is professional and great experience
Fantastic view of the city night scene with matching cuisine,"The peking duck and the lobster rice dishes were excellent at Yan. After dinner, we trooped upstairs to enjoy the excellent night view of the city sky line, with the padang in front and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel behind it. The lighted buildings and the entire night scene was certainly a sight to behold!"
Dim Sum @Yan National Gallery,"it is tucked at a corner on Level 5. If you are driving you may proceed straight to level 5 from the carpark lift. Ambience wise is good. And it is quite fully seated that Saturday lunch, so it's wise to book first. Service attitude wise is just acceptable. We tried a variety of usual Dim Sum like Char Siew buns, Siew Mai and Har Gao. and sheng jian bao etc. we all agree that the fillings somehow is drier than most of dim sum we tried out elsewhere. May mean that it is healthier as it is less oily. We ordered the fried rice, and that's the only dish outside dim sum we ordered and it was good with the wokhey's effect. I will still go again to try other dishes other than the dim sum."
Decent Cantonese Food,Would give this place 3 out of 5 - there just are not any factors that make it stand apart from other cantonese restaurants.. We had half a roast suckling pig which was ok. The chiicken broth and fish maw soup was ok. Service was...More
Review of Yan restaurant,"Good food, like the peking duck, deep fried soon hock and dim sum. Good service staff and good embience"
Great ambience and food!,Visited Yan to celebrate my mom’s birthday. Food and service was great even though it was rather crowded by the evening. The staff even prepared a plate with traditional birthday calligraphy with their signature lotus buns. Definitely worth going back again!More

Worse than expected,"Went there for lunch on a saturday. Place was almost fully filled and understaffed. So the service was terrible, e.g. had to ask multiple times for refill of tea and crew kept walking past without acknowledging. Rice was tasteless but noodles and porridge were tasty.More"

Overrated restaurant. Funny taste chilli crab,"If you are expecting fine dining, don't. Service is so so. Food is below average. Steam Soon Hock is quite good. But ordering the Sri Lanka chilli crab was a mistake. The gravy taste weird.More"
Yan Restaurant good ambience,My colleague and I had a joyful and relaxing time at Yan restaurant . The Spring Treasures for the Season is delicious and perfect portion for lunch.
Food and service was not up to expectation,Ordered the $68 set lunch. Food was way below expectation given the price. Tasted like microwaved food. Staff were also rushing thru the serving of dishes despite requests to slow down.More
Nice food,Portion of food can be slightly more. Place is nice with great services. Value for money and highly recommend
Good service and quality food,Service was good and food was good. Only the Pao Fan took a while longer but definitely good. Nice place for family meals.
Not as good as I was looking for,"Food is so so. One of the sea cucumber that we ordered was hard. Dim sum was normal alike those at the hawker. Worse is, the service was not so good. Our dishes was serve individually, but 2 of thr dishes came together. One of...More"

Great food -excellent service,As usual when there is a birthday celebration- Yan is always my first choice - never fail me all these years with excellent service led by the General manager - CK & his very hardworking staff - serving us with great food ! Highly recommended for all occasions- keep up the good work- CK!
Good Service & Ambience,"Food was excellent & the portion just nice for me but not for my hubby, who's a big eater, hahaa.. Ambience was good also"
yan restuarant,"Overall, the food was average. The restuarant happened to be understaffed and waited quite a while to be served. The red bean dessert was soured and got a replacement for mango sago instead."
Great place for authentic Hong Kong food in a convivial setting,"Love every dish. Service also feels homely. Most importantly, this is the one Chinese restaurant that stands out in the iconic National Gallery, Singapore. Perched on the top floor, it overlooks an outdoor art installation, with interior decors clad in prosperous shades of pink, fuchsia and oriental beauty. Come with family and Yan is bound to thrill both young and old."
Excellent,"Every dish is very good, especially the lobster porridge, perfect size for two people, even come with various condiments. Desert is also better than the same dish elsewhere. Service is very good as well."
Cantonese cuisine on point!,"Authentic cantonese cuisine with affordable price and set lunch, I like the ambience where it located in National Gallery."
Cold dishes,"We ordered a set meal for min. 2 pax . The dishes are being served too soon, eg, the cod fish, the soup and fried rice turned cold."
Lunch,"Service is not very good / organized.
Food was still acceptable except for the dessert, but roasted duck was nice thot."
Yan restaurant,Everything was quite fine. Except that they didn’t received notification of our reservation. Service was only above average.
JC aluminus,"After 3 attempts to arrange for our JC aluminus meetup, we were so happy that we can meet for lunch at Yan. Much have been raved about the Cantonese cuisine here and we were not disappointed. My dining companions are foodies & we enjoyed our lunch very much. They seemed to be stretched in their serving staff strength otherwise, you must go & try their food."
Bad customer service,"Such lousy service, went to buy mooncake and the first time I step into the restaurant, a fairly senior lady (in white) asked me rudely “what you want” instead of “how can I help you”. After placing order, another lady also in white, came out and instead of passing us the mooncake, just walk past us and talk to the first lady. Then handed the mooncake to us, without saying anything. First time encounter such rude service and I’ve been to Yan to dine on 3 occasion and these 2 ladies are usually not in their uniform unlike other staffs and always have the same lousy attitude. Both of them are usually stationed at the cashier.

Overall rating is terrible because the staffs ruin the mood."
Very pleasant dinner,Captain was professional and nice. Took initiative to provide Birthday buns with desert when he was told to provide a candle.
Pretty bad service,They provided a digital menu that wasn't the same as the actual menu of food they were serving. Food was expensive for okay quality. Would not recommend.
Excellent service,"For where the food lacked in impeccable standards, the service made up for it.

Came with the girlfriends for a dim sum lunch. Love the location. First impression was restaurant could be neater. You can see backend staff working near the entrance way. Kind of a ambience wrecker.

Dim sum was alright. I won’t be running back here soon but the neighbouring table ordered fried kway teow and the wok hey came wafting over. So we will be back to try that dish and the ala carte menu."
FOOD,Beijing Duck Skin Not Crispy! I would like to wrap the Beijing Duck Skin myself! Dirty Plate need to change fast!
Yan Can!,"Been a while since I’ve been to Yan. Was a business lunch so we had some Dim Sum + vegetables and dessert. The Dim Sum were SG-themed like satay spring rolls, laksa dumplings etc Most were hits especially the crab porridge which required NO seasoning. Service could be more attentive but F&B outlets are understaffed these days. Will return regardless. Coz Yan is Can."
2nd visit and I still love it!,Overall experience is good. nothing much to say about this restaurant. it is just that I don't go often coz it is quite ex just for a plate.
GREAT LUNCH ON 20TH JULY 2021,We have a fantastic Dim Sum lunch at Yan Ting. The food is served piping hot and e service is excellent. We really enjoy very much. It's a good place to have lunch as the ambience is super and the staff is helpful and courteous. Will definitely visit again.
Takeaway Dinner,"Ordered food delivery since no dine in. Food came in earlier than original timing but still warm when we eat. Overall the food is nice. But just feedback on the Pumpkin soup, a little too starchy, prefer slightly more pumpkin, red bean soup actually also too starchy & too sweet."
Excellent food. Good value,"Had lunch there with my family, and it was a relatively quiet afternoon. The food was excellent, and the service as well."
Food leaves little to be desired,"The xiao long bao was dry. The desserts were disappointing. The mangoes were not sweet...the osmanthus jelly was plain. I had better dim sum experiences that cost me way cheaper.
The only thing commendable was the atmosphere cos it is above national gallery."
Nice cosy restaurant with nice,"Nice quiet place for lunch with friends. Service staff are friendly, food is delicious. A bit pricey, but bought the vouchers from Chope, good deal. Good for occasions/ celebrations."
Lunch at Yan,"Wonderful food n great service by staff. Very helpful, friendly n efficient. The food quality n taste are so good! Went to eat once n this round brought my niece who loves the food too!!"
Amazing Wedding Banquet @ YAN,"My wife and I decided to hold our wedding banquet at YAN since the National Gallery is one of our favorite dating spots. We were very blessed to have met Wendy who helped and gave us many useful tips and suggestions to the arrangement of our wedding banquet. Wendy is very thoughtful and meticulous. We were able to went through the entire wedding plan and proceed with ease. The seatings were very flexible as we do not need to do it the traditional way of having 10 people for each table. Wendy and the waiters also helped with the entire tea ceremony process.

Our guests loved the venue, atmosphere and food at YAN. The service by the Waiters and Waitresses were amazing. They were able to make adjustment efficiently and promptly on the spot. They were polite and hospitable.

My wife and I enjoyed our time at YAN. We highly recommend YAN as a venue for wedding banquet."
Delicious food and good service,"We had dinner with family and friends on a weekday dinner. Ordered a peking duck and half a suckling pig.

The duck was of a good size and the suckling pig was delicious. The Wolf Fried Clam with Carrot cake was especially good and would highly recommend. The service was exceptional.

Had a lovely dinner with the family."
Overated food with terrible service,"Went in with great expectation on their food but was sorely disappointed with their food quality and their service was horrible..the waitress who took our order showed a black face and even wrote the wrong order, seriously bad attitude and definitely not going back again and won't recommend.."
Excellent Food & Service,"Ordered set menu for a family of 8.
Fantastic and authentic food: roast pork platter was awesome, superior chicken broth is very flavourful - obviously due to long hours brewing, mayo prawns reminds us of father/granduncle's cooking, abalone and mushrooms are cooked long hours that it's so soft.
Service is impeccable. The waiter/waitress is so nice to help us portion the servings and making sure our teas are refilled.
Overall, had a wonderful time at Yan, worth the dollars, will recommend to others."
Nice to Be Back,"Yan Restaurant is a very memorable place for me and my husband. Normally this place is fully booked on weekends and we were not able to make a reservation. We took a chance to walk-in. Fortunately, there was 1 small table available for us!

We ordered our favorites (Sautéed Beef Cubes with Asparagus and White Pepper Sauce some & Chilled Mango with Vanilla Ice Cream and Oats in Coconut) together with Fried Rice with salted fish and Wok-fried Prawns with Beancurd,Lard and Egg Sauce. The quality and taste are still the same. That’s why we like coming back.

It was good to see Wendy again too. The staff are always busy going around each table to make sure customers got what they need. Their service is commendable. It’s a hidden gem on the 5th floor of National Gallery."
Excellent food and impeccable service,"Held a small wedding reception at Yan in Dec 2020 and I couldn't have been happier with how things turned out.

The food was superb and did not diminish in quality despite the numbers. A number of my guests told me that the food was the best they've ever had a Chinese wedding which is high praise. In particular the collagen chicken broth and the crabmeat flat noodles and the coconut ice cream with mango and oats were glorious hits.

Special shoutout to Wendy, our service manager through the entire event (pre, during and post) who went above and beyond to accommodate our many requests.

10/10 would re-visit for casual dining!"
Hidden Gem @ SG - awesome food and great service,"Just had a very satisfying feast at Yan (located at Singapore National Gallery). We had Peking Duck, Poached Live Prawns, Poached Soon Hock in Superior Chicken Broth, Sautéed Beef Cubes with Asparagus, Braised Whole Abalone, Lobster Porridge with Clams, Chilled Mango Cream topped with Vanilla Ice Cream serve in coconut etc, Every dish we had was so fresh and exquisitely yummy, all thanks to special menu created by Yan Culinary Chef Voon. Our fine dining experience is made possible with the excellent service provided by Wendy and team who are very experience, meticulous and care about giving us and our guest the best dining experience. A very memorable evening we had with friends tonight, highly recommended and we will be back!

Memorable wedding lunch at Yan,"Wendy from the reservation team made our wedding lunch an excellent experience. Despite the unique situation we are all experiencing, she made our lunch a breeze and clearly communicated what was requiring especially with all the social distancing in place.

The food was amazing, shoutout to the Superior Chicken Broth, Sea Perch, Pork Ribs Mee Pork (something different and plus points for a Teochew) and the Mango dessert in coconut. All of had a good experience there and even some guests have found their new favourite go to restaurant.

Thank you Wendy and everyone at Yan for making this a memorable lunch!"
Amazing Wedding Experience at YAN,"1. Beautiful interior and flexible layout

My wife and I fell in love with YAN's cozy atmosphere the moment we went down for a viewing while we were choosing a venue for our wedding. The interior design is beautifully designed to be modern yet infused with an oriental vibe. The restaurant has a smaller table seating, in groups of 5 to 8 pax rather than the usual 10 pax, which made seating arrangements really easy to accommodate families/groups.

2. Food was amazing!!

Dishes served at our wedding garnered so many praises from all our guests. Each dish was presented well; the food quality was excellent and consistent with our food tasting before the wedding. Highly recommend the peking duck, pumpkin soup with crab meat, cod fish, ee-fu noodles and not forgetting the deep fried lava custard bun.

3. Excellent service and restaurant manager

The service rendered to my wife and I from YAN was excellent and definitely put a smile on ours and all of our guests' faces. The service team who served us during our wedding are professional, observant and attentive.

I would also like to specially mention the restaurant managers, Wing and Wendy. The restaurant is flexible in customising our wedding dishes, with the recommendation from Wing and Wendy, who are attentive and provided solutions on food choices when we raised our concerns on our guests/elderly's food allergies/restrictions. They made adjustments & customisations such that guests with dietary restrictions still had a great meal.

Wendy has also been very patient and understanding when she attended to us from the start of the wedding planning months before the wedding till the actual day. She seeks to understand our needs and ensures that our needs for the wedding is catered to the best of her abilities. Safety regulations due to Covid-19 brought about multiple challenges that were new even to the restaurant, but Wendy navigated the challenges well, while not only trying to accommodate our requests as much as possible but also keeping us informed all the way.

All in all, the experience was 11 out of 10 - there was never a moment we felt like our wedding at Yan was just another cookie cutter experience provided by the restaurant. Would definitely go back to support this restaurant and enjoy the awesome food. :)"
"Decent food , service can be improved","Food and wine was okay but wasn’t too pleased with the service. We are aware that snacks are chargeable just like Amy other restaurant but server doesn’t have to pass such remarks that it costs $4+ like as though we can’t afford? Maybe is a Monday , food was average only as compared to other Cantonese restaurants we have tried."
Enjoyable visit to Restaurant Yan National Gallery,Have not visited Restaurant Yan for quite some time given Covid so it was very good to visit again recently with family. Enjoyed good food and service. Highly recommended
Wedding @ Yan,"It was definitely a good decision to host our wedding at YAN restaurant (for a guest of 50 people). Wendy, the banquet manager, was a good host and assisted us in many ways. The overall price was reasonable and the food was delicious. My guests enjoyed the food (especially the roasted duck and the white bee hoon). We held our solemnization at one of their private rooms and it was cozy. I do recommend if you would like to host your wedding at the restaurant if you have a small guest list. Good customer service and excellent food standard. Will definitely visit YAN in the near future."
Birthday dinner,It was thoughtful of them to provide 2 mini peach buns to celebrate my husband’s 62th birthday. The birthday wish written on the plate was beautifully written
Delicious suckling pig & roasted duck,"Birthday dinner at Yan with pre-ordered suckling pig, roasted duck and various claypot dishes.

Service : average service in terms of response time and efficiency. Commendable was the manager's initiative in replacing the suckling pig promptly when it failed his check.

Ambience : good chinese restaurant vibes.

Food : the claypot dishes were average and wouldn't order them again.
- Roasted duck : roasted well and simply delicious, live up to the famous Cantonese style fragrant roasted duck.
- Suckling pig : under the manager's strict quality control, the suckling pig did not disappoint! Great flavour, great accompaniment, skin roasted to perfection. Opted for this in 3 styles, but the 2-3 styles were dry and disappointing, and will forgo next time.

Will definitely be back for the suckling pig and roasted duck!"
Dinner at Yan,"Great service and fantastic food. My family enjoyed the food very much! Wendy was super nice to work with, understanding and accommodating. She goes the extra mile to ensure your visit was all good, from start to end. -Jo"
There are better chinese restaurants,"I agree with the previous review about the service. Very bad, ruined the experience. Seems like they were under-staffed as well."
Food is great BUT...,The food is nice but the service standard of one staff is less than satisfactory than spoiled the whole experience.
Fun Dinner with friends,"My friends and I had our dinner here couple of days ago and we surely did enjoyed the experience. The location is central, restaurant ambiance was nice, service was very good, thank you Sow Ling, See Gek and Wendy for taking care of us during our meal the best part was the food! It was sooo good! Personal favorites are the Peking Duck and the Beef with asparagus! I highly recommend it. The chef was really skilled as the food were so delish. Hoping to visit again soon"
"Great Food, Great Service!","This is one of the best Cantonese restaurants that I’ve ever been in Sg. We had the Peking Duck and the Prawns in Clay Pot, also tried the Garlic Crab which was super tasty! Thank you Sow Ling and See Gek for the attentiveness, really appreciate the warm service to my friends and I. We will surely be back for more! Also not to forget Ms Wendy for the food recommendations! You all made our small gathering a memorable one! Thank you!!"
Wonderful Dinner w/ Friends,"Place is very accessible and was able to see the peaking sunset in the city area while walking over to the restaurant. Restaurant was clean and we were seated in the booth which was nice because it provided our group some privacy. We ordered our food from the qr code menu they provided on the table. Pecking Duck is a must try. Never had the skin that crunchy before so it does give another layer of texture to the pancake and the meat was so tender. We had the prawn with cheong fun. It was my first time trying and it did not disappoint. Also loved the fried garlic crab. It was so nice we almost finished even the garlic. We ordered the black pepper beef with asparagus too, beef was so tender and the doneness was just right. Loved the dessert as well. The staffs were very helpful in recommending their specials, they were attentive and really looking after our table, always refilling our tea and attending to our additional requests. Thanks to Sow Ling and See Gek for looking after our table. The manager Wendy was also checking in on our table once in a while. Overall, we had a very pleasant dining experience."
My go-to Chinese restaurant ! Love it,My Wife and I absolutely love the food here. Especially the Peking Duck. Also great staff who are very friendly and attentive. Highly recommended!
Delightful Solemnisation & Wedding Dinner,"My wife and I fell in love with the decor and ambiance the first time we stepped into the restaurant. After having their set menu, we knew that this was the place that we wanted to hold our solemnisation, tea ceremony, and wedding banquet.

Wendy, our restaurant manager, patiently listened and guided us throughout the whole process, which included addressing our 1001 queries with regards to the menu, table setting and etc. She also offered us some useful suggestions that we had not thought of during our own planning process. She even helped us to customise our banquet dinner menu to our specific requirements.

We are also extremely grateful to Wendy and her team for all the assistance rendered on the actual evening. We had underestimated the time required for the set up, and if not for her and her team, we would not be able to finish our set up on time. Wendy and her team went the extra mile to help us decorate our solemnisation room, and tied our chair sashes in such a romantic way, that my wife remarked that this is like her childhood dream wedding come true. Wendy had even personally tied our wedding bands to our ring pillow, so that it would be easy for us to untie during the solemnisation.

The food was one of the best we have tasted. Kudos to their chefs and the team for preparing such exquisite dishes. Our guests were all raving about the food, especially their signature Yan Peking Duck, and their dessert - Deep-fried Liu Sha Bao! Wendy and her team ensured that all our guests' cups were always full with drinks and liquor at all times, and even acceded to our special request of mixing our signature cocktail, which was served during dessert. It was a wonderful touch to end the night and our guests all left happily.

We look forward to our next dining experience there!"
Mediocre Food & Poor Service!,"We were here to celebrate our friend’s birthday.
This is the least hospitable Chinese fine dining restaurant we have ever visited in our lives.
The service staff including the manager were cold and unfriendly. No efforts to introduce the menu and no smile at all.Felt unwelcome!
We had the executive set lunch. They have a promotion now for 4 paying adults, the fifth one dines free which we just found out upon arrival at the restaurant. We ordered that plus a number of ala carte dim sum. Wanted to order more but the manager said too much and we might not finish.
The dim sum dishes were so mediocre, the fillings of the chives dumpling was so salty. The soup and the noodles of the seafood noodles in broth were so bland! The Liu Sar pau was the worst we have ever tasted in a restaurant, filling was watery and runny and way too sweet.
This was our first time visiting and there was a lot of hype in the google reviews about this restaurant. We were very disappointed with both food and service. Terrible experience."
Great place for wedding dinner,"My daughter originally planned to have a big wedding dinner at a hotel. However, due to Covid-19, she decided to cancel as many of our relatives will not be able to attend due to closed borders. We settled for just a dinner with the immediate family of the bride and groom at Yan restaurant. Due to a change in government policy from 20 to 50 guests for wedding, we were able to include some close friends. We booked the private room and the middle room for 34 guests. It was very last minute, I think we informed Yan 3 days prior to the dinner and they were able to accommodate.

The food was very good, they were served hot and were delicious. We changed the dessert to the chilled mango in coconut and most of the guests commented that this was very good. You know at wedding dinners, it is usually a trade-off between food and ambience. But I am happy to say that we had both at Yan.

Special shout out to Wendy who was knowledgeable and guided us throughout the tea ceremony (we held this at Yan) on the Chinese customs. She was also very accommodative and attentive to our needs.

So instead of a big wedding where the wedding couple have to go to 20 to 30 tables to greet guests (and probably not able to eat their dinner), we had a cosy and intimate wedding with family and close friends, where everyone enjoyed themselves. The wedding couple also gets to enjoy the dinner. Kudos to Yan!"
"Best Place, Great Food!","We had our solemnization last weekend at Yan Restaurant. It was the best decision to book this place for 3 main reasons: the ambiance, the food and the manager (Wendy).

The place is very cozy and relaxing. The private room we used is perfect for intimate weddings and can be designed according to your preference. The size of the room is just fine for small group during Phase 2. We also had a semi-exclusive dining place because there is a sliding door the separates our dining area with other customers. But the whole place can also be book if you have more guests.

The food speaks for itself. Before we booked this place, we tried their food and we were immediately sold out. All our guests loved the food here especially the duck and beef asparagus which are very tender, the steamed fish which taste really good and in great quality, and the star of luncheon - the chilled mango cream in coconut. Don’t miss this dessert! It’s really good and refreshing. For me, it’s the best.

Wendy is also the most significant person on this restaurant. She is very friendly and is very responsive even when we were still inquiring for the place. She accomodated us very well despite her being busy with other customers. She has done her best in attending to our requests. We felt her concern when she called us early in the morning and was informed that the National Gallery might be closed for NDP rehearsal on our solemnization day but good thing it didnt happen. Her stuff were also very helpful.

We had a great experience at Yan and even our guests say they want to go back to this restaurant."
"Great Food, Service and Ambience","Food was delicious and impressed by the impeccable service. Love the peking duck, thousand layer tofu and peach barbeque pork buns. We had a mini birthday celebration but great experience."
Yan at National Gallery,I have my birthday celebration lunch in Yan. It's a cosy and nice ambience restaurant. The food are delicious and the staff are friendly too.
First visit,Great impression for the first visit to the restaurant. Excellent service and great value for the food quality
Wonderful experience,"Had dinner for a birthday celebration at this wonderful restaurant on a Saturday evening. If you’re looking for classical Chinese cuisine that packs a punch in terms of taste and presentation, this is the place to go. Soups were the best part of the meal, all the types of soups were very rich and tasty. Service by See Gek was impeccable despite the dinner crowd. She was attentive, gave good advice and knew what we needed. Thanks to her, this was hands down the best birthday celebration we have had in a restaurant in a long time."
You will not yawn at the food at Yàn,"Too bad this restaurant is a bit out of the way, the rooftop of the National Gallery is not exactly a high traffic location. Fir the food is among the more innovative and most delectable among Cantonese eateries in Singapore. This time, in addition to the beautifully-plated thousand layer tofu, we tried the deep-fried prawns with salted egg yolk, beef cubes with asparagus, and rice in seafood soup with baby oysters add crabmeat: all outstanding. Service is a bit taciturn, but can be forgiven because the food is so yummy. Yàn is not to be confused with Yan Ting, Xi Yan, Yan Palace, or Jaan."
Lou hei at Yan,The food was excellent and the potion wasn't too big. The service was rather too fast.. feel like pushing us to leave..
High quality Lunar New Year dinner,"Hosted a Lunar New Year dinner for close friends and we enjoyed the special menu and good service very much. The suckling pig was very unique and when one of the guests was late in coming, they did a special effort to shift the Yu Sheng to a later time"
First time here and the lunch,"First time here and the lunch options selected by my business counterparts were delicious. The individual portion of mee pok with fish slice was perfect! Prices on the steep side but good place for business or family, friends gathering"
Delectable Dim sum and Chinese dishes,"Delectable Dim sum and Chinese dishes, and they were able to cater to my grandma’s vegetarian diet as well; great service"
Snooty Service,"Not the first time we’ve been there but a convenient place to go to if the kids have been visiting the National Gallery. Have always been met by service that makes us feel they are barely tolerating us, almost empty restaurant most times with claims that they are fully booked and they are doing us a favour for squeezing us in. Definitely wouldn’t bother if we weren’t there for the gallery. Excellent food can be had at much friendlier places. The maitre d really imagines he’s either in an extremely exclusive dining environment (which this place, while nice, is not) or thinks he owns the establishment and is above plebs who dare attend (if he did it would be wise to be nice to all customers). He does top off the whole experience and takes the service here to new levels of snooty. Better not judge books by their covers people, tired mums with babes in tow might not look like they’ll be splashing out big bucks all at once, but you don’t know who they really could be or how their business could be more important than you imagine."
Great place for a cosy wedding,"We held our wedding lunch at Yan restaurant recently and the experience was great. Wendy was really helpful with answering all our questions and requests during the pre-wedding preparation period. What’s most important to us and probably something the restaurant is proud of would be their food. The food was awesome during food tasting, what’s best is, the restaurant managed to maintain their food standard during the actual wedding and we received so many praises from our relatives on how delicious all the dishes were. Service from Wendy and her team was commendable during the wedding reception despite some hiccup along the way, where some of our relatives wasn’t served with beverages, but the issue was quickly resolved after our sisters reflected the situation to Wendy and her team. Overall, we are happy that we picked Yan to celebrate our special day."
nice food but service and ambience wasn't what i expected,"food is not bad. but for a restaurant that is located at the national gallery, i was expecting the service standards to be more international/cosmpolitan - but i felt more like i was eating in a humble coffeeshop with service staff who were not particularly attentive or interested in us. restaurant also felt a little rundown"
Wedding Banquet at Yan on 2 Nov 2019,"We held our wedding banquet on 2 Nov 2019 at Yan restaurant and it was nothing short of amazing. Our guests loved the food (special mention to baked pork rib, golden pumpkin broth and deep fried salted egg custard bun dessert). We even had some of our friends indicate their interest to have their wedding at this venue after the event.

Wendy handled our requests on the food and itinerary in a very professional manner and was very accommodating to our requests. We couldn’t have been more lucky to have her as our coordinator. The entire restaurant team was really friendly and attentive to our guests’ needs throughout the banquet.

Yan is the place to be if you are looking for a cosy setting to host your guests and if your priority is having delicious food served at your wedding! We highly recommend Yan :)

Good Food & Service,"1st visit for me and my 3 guests. We all felt the food was quite good, except for the red bean soup dessert which was too watery and too sweet. We appreciated the restaurant's policy in giving birthday buns with char siew fillings when they found out we were celebrating a birthday. The buns were regular sized ones and we were given 2 buns each - very generous of them indeed! The service was good too."
Good but short-changed!,"Had a family lunch organised at Yan over the weekend. The food offering was generous in portion and well presented; taste great too. Was rather disappointed with their recommendation of a pair of red grouper which was not only overpriced but wasn’t fresh. Feedback given was met with blank to nonchalant looks from the staff! The experience would have been good if not for their peddling off their poor quality fishes, at a high price, to save their own bottom line!! Such a shame!"
Great food in a comfortable space.,We had the Peking Duck which was incredibly tasty with a few side dishes recommended by staff. Good ambience. Worth doing the National Gallery followed by dinner at YAN.
Dining @ YAN Restaurant,Nice ambience and sumptuous food. Family loves the dining experience. A must try. Service was acceptable.
Great place for a good Chinese dinner - followed by a visit to the roof top bar!,"Situated in a prime location in the National Gallery, it is not a big restaurant so you can expect a sort of cozy atmosphere. We had about 6-7 dishes and every dish delighted us. The most memorable is the steamed Soon Hock fish - so fresh and perfectly tender. Great ambiance and service to match. After dinner, go upstairs for a great view of the Marina skyline and have a drink at the bar. Breathtaking view."
Nice ambient restaurant,"Foods are decent, nice ambient with wonderful service... suitable for all sorts of celebration or anniversary.."
Exceptional Dim Sum,"Yan sent a mail announcing new dim sum items. For a start they served on a beautiful platter (looks like it was made for the items!) the 6 new 'heart dots'. They were good! The idea was to try first and order more if you like, which I did. I ordered extra vegetarian xiao long pau. Next order was: Steamed Stuffed Fish Maw with Shrimp Paste,Parsley and Egg White Sauce.What a creation, nice to look at which enhances the taste! Pan-fried Singapore Chilli Crab Meat Buns was a bit disappointing: it tastes good, but I can't discern the typical chili crab taste. The price is reasonable with a nice and cosy ambiance."
Service is lacking,Made a reservation in advance and arrived on time. My mom and I both agreed that we did not feel as welcomed as we were expecting especially for a nice restaurant like Yan. Service is sub-par for the price paid and it was a relatively disappointing experience.
Not up to its reputation,"I was disappointed by Yan - first of all the service, staff not attentive, didn't seem to bother about the restaurant guests - amazing they only spoke broken English (in Singapore!). Then the food itself - we ordered a Peking duck which had probably spent quite some time in the kitchen. The pancakes were dry and chewy. I would not go back again."
