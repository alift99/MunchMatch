Great Experience,"From the start go, the experience and food quality were very memorable and enjoyable. Food presentation was very appealing too."
One of the best meals in Singapore,"This was one of the best meals I had in Singapore - I would easily go back. Really good service, value for money etc. Not very vegetarian friendly but they make it clear it is focused on poultry and meat."
More than tapas,This was the second time we dined at Lolla. We tried different dishes and the meal was as good as the last although expensive compared to other tapas restaurants.
Great experience at Lolla,Loved the food and top notch service. Short menu but well thought out. Sit at the bar to see the chefs at work. Don't miss the signature uni pudding.
Fabulous sea urchin pudding,"I could not come back to my favorite restaurant in Singapore Lola for almost 3 years because of COVID but finally come back on Tuesday night just after 6pm already clouded with dressed couples I had a luxury of having a good seat at the corner by myself! Enjoyed the atmosphere and lovely food
Sea Urchin pudding is always a must try paired with some wines"
Nothing to Fault about,The restaurant was very nice to accommodate all of our dietary preference. The food was amazing and service was great!
Great experience!,First time eating here and the food tastes amazing! I recommend having the tasting menu with the wagyu beef tongue supplement ^^
Great Food & Services,"The overall experience in the restaurant was great. The food is delicious and their seasonal food is fresh and tasty. The staff is very attentive, helpful and explain to us in details of the food as they presented to us. The only setback is since we were seated at the basement, the network reception is really bad that is unable to take calls / extend my parking timing in my case."
Poor ambience,"Food is good, eg the sea urchin pudding. Staff are helpful when it comes to recommending and explaining dishes. What the resto could do is be smarter in layout of the area. Two huge tables closely side by side and one table next to us had a big group of loud and crass diners - we could hardly hear ourselves or the waiters. The resto does not care about diner experience but more keen on packing as many diners as possible in a closet space. Tough luck if you end up with super loud diners next to you!"
Good omakase but only tasting menu for weekends,Visited Lolla on a Saturday evening and was a bit disappointed to know that they only do tasting menus on Fridays and Saturdays. Was excited to try the sea urchin pudding but I guess I’ll have to come back on weekdays. Overall a nice Omakase experience. The restaurant only has bar seatings so if you’re looking for an intimate date experience this is definitely not the place because your neighbours are literally 50cm away from you. The second last dessert had a really bitter element to it and I was not a fan. We opted for the Wagyu beef tongue option with half wine-pairing. Special thanks to the gentleman who came by to introduce us the menu (didn’t get his name). He was friendly and very warm towards us. He also helped changed out the Rose to champagne - we were both not fans of Roses. Thanks again and I will come back to visit lolla for their ala carte menu.
Phenomenal meal and venue with style,"Each course was different but the whole worked very well together. Went for the wagyu tongue option, but was a bit overwhelmed by its richness.
Excellent chef further accommodated by late mention of a minor dislike for advocating and whipped up a very tasty alternative.
Chef, staff and venue were phenomenal. Very highly recommend!"
Worth the trip!,Excellent food made more memorable with the people behind the restaurant and the ambiance. Definitely worth the trip and look forward to trying the rest of the menu on our next trip..
dinner for 5 at Lolla,"service was excellent, and food as very tasty, albeit with very small portions. Spent $360+ for 5, with what I expected were 5 mains, 2 starters and a dessert for one person as a afterthought. Went away still hungry, even though we thoroughly enjoyed the flavors served. Would I go back? Not sure. Good tasting experience, but it wont fill you up, or even come close. Maybe they should serve bread with the mains...? Also, this was not their problem, but the other group in the basement dining room were obnoxiously and explosively loud. Almost ruined the experience. Too bad."
Great experience,Everything was just perfect. We especially love the sea urchin pudding and grilled octopus. Should come early next time for the seasonal menu!
Fabulous food and wine!,"A friend and I had dinner and Lolla last weekend, and it was a fantastic meal! I dined here years ago for brunch and was wowed by the flavours then, so am glad I finally made it back for dinner. We ordered several dishes to share, and all of them were excellent, no complaints about anything. The ingredients were perfectly prepared and the flavours were standout. It would be hard to pick a favourite, the tomato and burrata salad was fresh and the flavours enhanced with the accompanying basil oil and white balsamic vinaigrette, and the sourdough toast was chewy and tangy. The crab pasta was cooked al dente with a rich, luscious sauce and generous hunks of crab, the octopus came with the creamiest smoked potato puree and had a great charred flavour, as did the iberico pork secreto, which was so tender and paired with a delicious sweet sauce, though not as tender as the wagyu beef tongue and cheek, which barely required chewing they were so perfectly cooked!

Dessert was a real highlight, I had the chocolate pistachio tart which was absolutely divine...rich dark chocolate, pistachio ganache and a crispy feuilletine base made for the perfect contrast of crunch and creaminess, and the accompanying pistachio ice cream really enhanced the nutty flavour. The wine was excellent too, I enjoyed the Auslese so much I had a second glass, and we both found the wine well priced and generously poured.

Service was great too, we were served by three different staff, two young ladies and a gentleman in a Hawaiian shirt, and all three were friendly, engaging and easily able to answer our questions about the menu and give recommendations and suggestions. The only downside is the seating wasn't the most comfortable, we were on high bar stools and also in a rather warm part of the restaurant, but it was fun to watch the food being prepared as we dined.

Yes, the food is pricey, and the portions could be considered small, but we both agreed the quality was worth the price and personally I love small portions as it means I can try more dishes. I will be visiting Lolla again, and not waiting so long to do so this time!"
Fair experience,Most dishes tasted good but one of us who had the iberico pork dish had a stomach ache the next day. We were seated downstairs & it was too noisy & service was a little slow.
food too rich,ordered the uni pudding and crab pasta. it was tasted good at first but became too rich towards the end even though the portion is not big.
Exceptional,Sensational. As good as ever. The food is exceptional. The service top notch. Very expensive but worthwhile every time.
Great food & ambience,Good for sharing. The Spanner Crab was yummy! We enjoyed the Hand Torn pasta with brown crab and Iberico Secreto with braised cabbage too! and the dessert wine was so nice!
Good Food But Ridiculous Prepayment System,"Charging me a prepayment of $117 upon booking for a $241 meal, in case I don't turn up is ridiculous. On top of that, when I finished my meal, this prepayment was not deducted from my bill and was told I had to wait 7 to 14 days to get it refunded. Unbelievable. When I complained to the management, they couldn't really explain why this happened. One of my favourite restaurants but if this persists, I may have to go other places."
Great !,Will visit just for sourdough kombu butter and burrata salad! Iberico pork little too fatty for me but my husband enjoyed it. Enjoyed counter seats watching young chefs in action. Waived wine charge as their digital pay wave machine didn’t work.
looks like a disaster area,The place looks like a rubbish tip. Its also quite chaotic service wise the food was surprisingly OK Decent Spanish fare and a reasonable wine list
Dinner with friends,"It's been a few months since my last dinner at Lolla. The meal was exquisite, Johanne Siy is a great Chef, every course was delicious and beautifully presented. Service as, always was warm, attentive and efficient"
lemon sole,Start with sourdough & butter... then order the the fish with fried capers.... and ask for EXTRA capers.
"Superb food, great ambiance and excellent service. You will enjoy this.","So good! The food. We thoroughly enjoyed every dish that we ordered. Sea urchin, oyster, octopus, pasta, steak and the dessert. They definitely transformed all the ingredients and elevated them to another level.

The server was amazing too. Every recommendation made was spot on. She described the dishes very well, and if you have more questions, she could answer you well too. We were amazed. Maybe she cooks too!

We sat by the counter, and enjoyed watching how the food was prepared.

Lovely experience, for friends, families and couples. We will definitely be back."
Premium experience from A to Z,Expensive and worth every nickel. Here are even more words to pad the minimum character requirement.
Birthday,Dinner was awesome. Chef introduced some dishes while serving us and we were seated on bar table overlooking the kitchen. The dishes were delicious and uni pudding is a must try.
Lolla,"Great service, enjoyed sitting at the bar watching the kitchen staff perform! Kombu butter was amazing, as was the crab pasta, and sweetbreads special. Will have to go back for dessert!"
Delicious date night dinner,"Last visited in 2015. Fast forward to 2021, the ambience and quality remains consistently high and comes with surprising elements that continue to delight, entertain and taste delicious. Worth every penny for the bar counter seats, fresh produce and earnest culinary experience."
Decent but a tad pricey,Expected the flavours to be more elevated but sadly it was rather one dimensional. Service was great though. Best dish was sourdough and Kombu butter. Execution of flavours not parallel with creativity.
Perfect dinner with casual dining vibe!,Great food with good service ! Enjoy the vibe with great food .. iberico is amazing and the crab pasta was so good! Decent wine selection with acceptable price !
Dinner at Lolla,Amazing food. Highly recommend the porcini pasta and the carabinero prawns. We also had the crab pasta which was as good as the porcini pasta. Great for dates.
Lolla Dinner Review,"Had a lovely time over a lovely meal. The food was marvelous and service was great. Together with their cocktails, it was a nice time with dinner date."
Birthday Dinner,"A memorable evening (26 Sep) at Lolla’s with an amazing team. The lady who seated us to the table was attentive and recommended us the right portions to order as well as dishes. We were seated at the bar and the mood among the chefs was upbeat and demonstrated camaraderie making the dining a positive experience. Our favorites from that night include toasted sourdough with kombu butter, sea urchin pudding, and Hokkaido scallop carpaccio! One thing could be improved was the pace of the meal; our dishes were served quickly one after another even though we had a lot of time left during our allocated booking slot."
Lolla - Mediterranean food at its best,"Lolla, thank you. Your food, the way you serve your food, and the fact that everything is cooked right in front us is second to none. I am honestly unsure as to why you don’t have a Michelin Star yet.

The tortellini in brodo were filled with iberico pork collar and jamon iberico de bellota. Partnered with the bone broth and black garlic, these were bites of utter glory. I should have asked them to give me a takeaway portion that I could have then devoured within seconds of stepping outside the Lolla door. When the chefs told us that the black garlic was made in house, I wanted to run to wherever it was being made and steal all of it.

The bone broth needs its whole new paragraph. The broth, with some delightful basil oil drizzled in, just sang. It was both rich and light, it tasted like several hours of cooking were put into this effort, and it was so delicious that, after finishing up the outstanding tortellini, I drank the remaining liquid straight out of the bowl.

The pan-seared monkfish was wrapped in jamon iberico de bellota, giving this tender fish a nice saltiness. The added jamon on top made sure that the dish had that extra crispy texture. It made me think of a reworked fish and chips. The pureed white asparagus was something that I could have eaten all day every day. It was unctuous, butter-like, and just about pure food orgasm right then and there.

What came next was absolutely beautiful. Scallops can easily be overcooked, but this one was casually bathing in its own scallop broth and having a fantastic time. I could happily gorge on these for the rest of my hopefully long life.

Let’s talk about the rabbit saddle. Do rabbits that large exist to be able to make cuts that size?! I guess so, as I doubt Lolla would lie. The rabbit was just delicious. It was tender, wrapped in more jamon iberico de bellota, and the added lardo and perfectly cooked heirloom carrots made me want to open my own rabbit farm.

Last but not least for the savoury dishes of the evening was the soft egg with chorizo sausage. I was already pretty full at this point, but the husband was not, so I had to indulge him, and I am very glad that I did. The 63 degree poached egg that had apparently been cooked for several hours – how does that work?! – miraculously seeped all over the crispy potatoes and chorizo, giving the whole dish a lovely sauce to delight in. I only had a couple of bites due to, as I already said, being pretty full, but they were some very memorable bites that I would love to enjoy again.

We don’t usually go for dessert, but then burnt cheesecake was on the menu. Have you ever tried burnt cheesecake? If your answer is yes, then you know that it’s an actual criminal offence not to order it when it’s right there, staring at you and telling you that it needs to be in your mouth in the next 5 seconds or else you will regret everything in life forever. This burnt cheesecake most definitely met my expectations and more. Let’s just say, I am now trying to work out how my calorie-controlled diet can fit in an entire cake a day.

Life is a rollercoaster. Go and enjoy it. For me, that is food, and I was more than impressed with Lolla’s outstanding efforts at putting forth many wonderful Mediterranean dishes. Do not stop!"
My favorite restaurant,Always never fail to impress us with their food creations. Refreshing & yummy tastes. Awesome Chef J and Team @ Lolla.
A frustrating mixed bag,"We love new experiences and creative food and Lolla has that in spades. Exceptional dishes served in the lovely 'basement'dining room filled with character. The menu is inventive and every one of the 7 dishes we tried (6 from the regular menu and 1 from the seasonal menu) plus the two desserts were outstanding. The cocktails we had were also fantastic and the service was flawless, to the extent that we left a tip on top of the obligatory 10% service charge. However, the actual seats must be the most uncomfortable on the planet. The last time I saw chairs like that was in about 1972 in pre-primpary school! Tiny wooden numbers that looked cute and went with the decor but are total impractical to the extent that we all have to get up to get some relief from the pain (yes, pain, not just discomfort) during the meal. I would rather have good food (and there is plenty of it about) and be comfortable than exception food and be uncomfortable for the entire meal. I would certainly go back, but only if they changed the seating."
Amazing,"What an amazing surprise to find this interment, friendly but extremely professional restaurant amongst the sometime sterile Singaporean restaurant offerings. The food was amazing and the Chiefs engaging. Well done. Definitely will go back"
Superb Tapas!,"Lolla has definitely made it to my personal favorite list ! Awesome food, Great service. Nice Ambience."
Restaurant character has changed,"Lolla was one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore, having been coming here for five years off and on. The attractive aspects of the restaurant were imaginative cooking by talented local chefs, unpretentious atmosphere, and a small plates focused menu that allowed you to try different flavours. The restaurant wasn’t cheap ($70-100pp excluding wine) but it felt like good value. High energy and buzz.

During a recent visit I was disappointed that there seems to be an attempt to make Lolla yet another high-end restaurant in Singapore. There is a new chef with Michelin credentials. Prices have been jacked up, and the menu had more upmarket (read: pretentious) options. The famous sea urchin pudding which was around $40 for a full portion (a small dessert bowl) 6 months ago, has now moved up to $65 for exactly the same item.

The food was as good as before but at these lofty prices, there are better value options in Singapore that don’t require you to perch on a countertop.

I hope management will bring back some of the elements that made this restaurant successful for such a long time in the Singapore restaurant scene. Otherwise it will become just another high-end restaurant casualty."
Pricey but extremely delicious food,"Almost every item that I’ve tried on the menu from my 2 visits were delicious, but for me the standouts were the lemon sole, ribeye steak and hand torn pasta with crab. Ambience of the place is pretty quaint and cosy albeit a little small (so do ensure you make reservations early), they have a seasonal menu that changes every month which on both occasions so far have been pretty good."
Have dinner somewhere else,"I'll stick to facts.

1. I was charged $162 more for my bill, which I carelessly did not vet the bill before paying. Only when I found out about it after looking at my statement did I realize. Called the restaurant and they confirmed that I was overcharged as my 2 glasses of wine was charged as 2 bottles of wine instead. I had to go back to the restaurant the next day and they gave me the difference in cash after waiting there for 15 mins. Not much was done to make it up to me as the customer despite the rest of the grievances below that was brought up to management.

2. Booked dinner about 3 weeks before the date, indicated it was for a birthday, called ahead to request for a more private table and that something be done for the birthday celebration. Had a confirmation that the requests will be noted and not to worry they'll make it special. On the day itself, was given a corner counter table at the door and was told by the cashier / receptionist that this is my table and there are no others available in a very ""take it or leave it"" way.

3. The end of dinner, no birthday special was done despite being promised it would be done.

4. We ordered 3 glasses of red wine in total and all 3 glasses had significant amount of floating cork in it.

5. We ordered the grass fed rib eye done rare, it came tough and chewy.

The portions were small and frankly the restaurant felt very poorly run.

I highly recommend heading elsewhere especially if you are looking to book this place for a special occasion. I hardly ever write reviews for restaurants, but this experience was so utterly damning that I simply could not let it go.

I would give this 0 stars if the review system allowed it."
Lolla,"Nice but portion is rather small.

The seating at the basement is very pretty however as it was a long table to share with other guests, it became increasing noisy and difficult to hold conversations. Its a pity as they carry a rather extensive range of good wines"
Deathly Delicious,"Quietly nestled amongst the row of shophouses is this beautiful gem called Lolla.
Wonderful and decadent food. All the dishes are 'tapas' sizes. Would recommend 5 - 6 dishes for 2 pax.Dishes were all executed timely. Sea Urchin Pudding is the epitome of our meal..Its rich, full of umami yet not over cloying.
Loved the beef tongue and cheeks too. Tender and charred. Right level of smokiness when paired with remoulade.
Will definitely be back again.
Psst... Good selection of wines too!"
Great service and even better food,Have been here a few times a year and their menu never disappoints. Food looks and taste amazing as usual.
Excellent !,Excellent ambience and food - had the sea urchin pudding and it's to die for! The champagne was amazing as well. All the food was just delicious and well thought out! The burnt cheesecake is amazing too!
New Chef New Yummy Dishes!,"So it's been a while since we've been back here, but were excited to go given the news that they had a new chef helming the place. The dishes are absolutely spot on, and I think I had the best gnocchi dish I've ever had there. Excited to go back to see what new dishes they'll introduce!"
Just fantastic,"Lolla was fantastic. Food was mostly quite good and their service was top notch.

We had their signature kombu butter & sourdough, burrata with samphires and pearl onions (this dish was the bomb), busiate pasta with bottarga, mayura station steak and wild strawberries with fior de latte ice cream (the best dessert I've had in recent times). Everything was pretty good although we didn't enjoy the pasta much.

The service from both servers and Chef was excellent. Extremely polite and friendly - no question was too much trouble at all, she even went to the kitchen and brought out some ingredients to show me in their raw form. Our server also noticed that we didn't have much of the pasta and removed it from our bill even though we didn't say a peep about it.

An expensive dinner for sure, I think their prices have gone up, but I'd return for an occasional splurge on their fresh seasonal produce and great service."
Great food and excellent service,Recommended by friend and totally blown away by the food and service. Went with a few friends to celebrate a birthday and we had the entire lower floor to ourselves. Beautifully decorated. Food was really something. Highly recommended.
Nice and simple. Will be back,"I have been craving for casual/modern European dining since circuit breaker and Lolla did not disappoint. The setting is more suitable for couples as majority of seatings are bar and stools.
The food are Mediterranean style influenced but are nice and simple. The sea urchin pudding is worthy of being the signature dish. The tuna Tartare and the iberico pork dish are also worth a try.

The only downside is that most dishes are strong in flavour so it might be good to have more light dishes in the menu"
Excellent date night,"We had the sourdough with kombu butter, uni pudding, steamed crab lasagna, grilled avocado and burnt cheesecake. The flavour profiles of the food were amazing; just the right amount of umami. It was also very beautifully plated. The ambiance was great for a date night. 10/10 would come back again :)"
One of my favourite restaurants in Singapore,"Great service, ambiance, and delicious food that is just the right amount. I always have a good time at Lolla with dishes like the iberico ham slices, the grilled avocado, grilled octopus, broccolini, and the duck breast. Super underrated restaurant on Ann Siang road and would highly recommend!"
Excellent food attentive service expensive wines,"In summary Excellent food attentive service but pretty expensive wines

We had sea urchin pudding, with the nice bread and butter

Our other dishes including beef, pork collar and the cheesecake

3 of us couldn’t finish the food it was actually pretty filling

All were flavourful, meats were well cooked but the cheese cake was disappointing

Prices of wines were expensive for the quality"
Service without a smile...,"This is a relaxed venue but how hard would it be to make it more welcoming... maybe it’s the corona virus distracting staff but surely despite this and post a temp chk its worth engaging with customers and making them feel special.... I don’t understand why staff act like it’s a chore to be courteous. Food Was slapped down on the bar without description and eye contact. It was ok for the price point, not amazing but sufficient in terms of originality and flavour to fill your stomach. To eat here is not a privilege. In our view it’s certainly not at the level of it’s peer group and wouldn’t return..."
Original,This is a fusion spanish/argentinian/japonese kind of restaurant. Few seats all front cooking. Very interesting and original menu. Good service and good food. Just quite expensive as i still consider an informal restaurant.
One of the best Tapas,One of the best spanish Tapas in Singapore Have been here more than 4 times and this time decided to write a review because they always out do themselves Try the chocolate pudding!!
Because we love Tapas,"The sea urchin pudding was a little heavy for us but loved the rich flavour and generous topping of it. Seared octopus was delicious. Well, me and my husband are always looking for places that are like Esquina. We visited Esquina in 2017 and have been hunting other locations that serves Tapas ever since, Lolla is definitely in our list now! Pricey but food is great and so was the service. Perhaps because we went there on a week day for lunch so the open prep area was not as bustling as we hoped it to be. Will return for dinner one day to experience the different side of Lolla. (because we love to see the chefs in action!!)"
Only well-funded Lolitas can afford regular lollapaloozas at Lolla,"It’s impressive how these local chefs could create innovative dishes that are as good or better than many tapas at Spanish restaurants. Go in a large group and try out many dishes. The ‘mains’ (eg. pork collar, ribeye steak) tend to be less yummy than the small dishes. Excellent service. Unfortunately, unless you’re a well-funded Lolita, Lolla is not for regular lollapaloozas as it’s quite pricey, in fact quite outrageously so as you can easily spend $150 per head in order to come out not hungry and feel the need for a refuel at Maxwell Hawker Centre."
Tapas at its best!,"So lucky to walk by and drop in to Lolla... This is how tapas should be... Sat at the bar and watched the chef and his team turn top quality ingredients into delicious tapas... 5J jamon, Savoy cabbage as you never had before and the sole and capers is one of the best fish dishes I have ever eaten... Chef and your team Congratulations!!... Don’t walk by, you will regret missing this place"
"Awesome food, meh service","The food here is so awesome!!! OMG! One of the best I’ve had! Unfortunately, the service is not very attentive and they seem to push you out when you’re done with ordering. I highly recommend you come to check out the food."
The food were beyond expectations,"Unassuming place, we were stroked by great food! Started with tender grilled octopus, tasty duck fat potatoes, ended with highly tender-juicy roasted pigeon breast with aubergine purée. Not overly sized food, just right for us. Attentive service. Definitely to come back for 👍👍"
Disappointing,"We had heard great things about Lolla and it could have been the expectations, but the whole experience left us very disappointed (and hungry).

While it offers a good variety of dishes on the menu, forget value. Some would describe the serving portions as ridiculous given the price tag. We almost wished the cooking could have helped substantiate the prices, but we’ve had better.

The overall experience was regrettable and forgettable."
Poor service and overpriced,"I went there with a group of my friends (4 of us) It was recommended by one of my friend who had good food and experience there. However we did not enjoyed our visit and regret it big time. This is def the first and the last time. First thé service was Terrible. The waitress was asking us to hurry up on the orders and asked us to order the desert in advance while we were eating.
As the kitchen was closing. Second the pricing was definitely overpriced! For a small bowl of mozzarella and honey, it cost $36! Omg that a size of a small bowl and with this price I could get two plates in a good Italian restaurant! We felt it was a ripped off!
Thirdly we ordered the wagyu beef and lord and behold it cost $68! To our surprise it was served on a very small plate!! That’s not all! The meat was full of fats! So we decided to complain and ask the waitress to convey the message to Chef to give us a better meat! Considering the fact that it’s $68! We were shocked when the waitress didn’t even say sorry about it. They just took it and send it back to the chef. When the meat came back, it was literally half of the size. Omg we were just speechless at this point of time. There were no saying sorry. We complained to the waiter but still not apologising was made. The bill came up to $550! With this amount we could end up in a fine dinning resultant with amazing meat! Overall experience, it was terrible and ripped off!"
Business dinner,"We were a party of seven, shared a lot of dishes. Excellent wine and food. And super service! The Rib-eye was perfect!"
slightly lower than expected,"price on higher side probably due to locatoin? food standard is not that fantastic though, service meeting expectation. tried the so-called imported Japanese markerel but probably too simple, just a full fish lots of bones and no side dishes."
Wow,Just my sort of place. Casual. Well designed. Good service. Interesting food. Highlights were the burrata with pesto and the pork shoulder.
Excellent service and food as always,I have been to Lolla many times and brought different groups of friends there - it has without fail impressed my guests on the quality of food and service. Love it!!
A pleasant and enjoyable meal at Lolla,"I have been recommended by my friend that you should come try once here at Lolla if you hit SG. my friend and I were finally here in Saturday afternoon for lunch time. Not crowd at all.
We were sitting in front of the open kitchen, on the counter bar and it's so good. we had enjoyed and could look all the process the chef and team preparing and cooking., together with talking with chef and their staffs. We have come for only 2 persons so couldn't try many dished as we would love too.
Our order were Sea urchin pudding, grilled avocado,iberico pork collar ,hokkaido scallop carpaccio, and doughnuts with lemon curd for the dessert.
All were truly scrumptious, I couldn't tell what is the best since all dishes' superb.
That's a pity we couldn't order more, even there were mentioned that it's come in a small plates but I guessed it's quite ok for sharing and we were totally full.
Definitely come back again and try some new dishes as well."
"Good Food, bit expensive","Food was pretty good, a little on the pricy side but enjoyable experience. The surprising dish was the tomatoes, packed full of flavour, and the Pork and Tuna Tartare were amazing!"
Sea Urchin Pudding,"Found this place by accident, looked at the menu and decided to have dinner on Saturday night. Ordered the sea urchin of course, seaweed butter with sourdough, beef tongue, pork secreto - which was their special, potato cooked in duck rillet and donut with lemon curd for dessert. Everything was good, tasty and delicious, service is also very courteous. Yes it is a bit expensive for a tapas style dishes but nothing in Singapore is cheap. And for the quality of the food that Lolla serves, the price shouldn’t matter too much. Special shout out to Ririn the server. Would come back and definitely recommend this place."
Gold Class,"@TheKuoKnows

Hats off to head chef Saiful for a menu that is full of fun and also full of taste.

If you want to experience Lolla at its best, try to grab a seat at the counter. Watching those chefs preparing food is better than any episode of Masterchef.

The Urchin Pudding is pure umami in a pot. Pairing urchin with squid ink is pure genius. But the best is yet to come.

The Beef Tongue is melt-in-your-mouth good. The pairing with horseradish mash potato is inspired. Ask for the Stir Fried Kale too. So simple, yet so effective.

Lolla deserves a Michelin Star for its ingenuity, its excellent service and its attention to detail. Is is Gold Class."
Phenomenal,Never disappoints. One year later and it’s just as good as it has ever been. What a privilege to come to this place
Sister by heart birthday celebration,"Restaurant with unique deco, small portion of foods as in fine dining serving, friendly service and pricey meals"
A disappointing experience,"I've read a number of good reviews before writing mine and I've got surprised that there are any good reviews at all. Anyway, to be fair, the place's atmosphere is nice and decor is great. That's all that's good about this place. We were there on Saturday evening and the place was nearly empty (we were the only guests they had at the basement floor). That's at the time when we couldn't get a table at two other places we initially thought of. Now, as far as food is concerned, we ordered 3 main dishes: octopus, beef tongue and pork collar. In the first place, all the dishes came in appetiser sizes. Which is nothing surprising by itself until you see how much you have to pay for that. And even that is not that bad if not for how the food was cooked. Nothing special about beef tongue. The octopus came overcooked. And so did pork collar. In the first place, I was surprised with a question how I want my pork collar to be done. I mean I like my beef steak on a rear side but I want my pork to be done well. Always. And I guess everybody does. This doesn't mean however that it should come dry. I mean pork collar is a piece with some intense marbling, so, even if you cook it well it's supposed to turn out juicy.

To summarise: ~$200 for a dinner for 3 with a bottle of wine is nothing outrageous. But given the size of portions and, especially, how poorly the food was cooked, it was a disappointing experience."
Finish at 2:30 means last orders at 2,"My Son flew in to Singapore to spend the weekend with us and after many great dinners at Lolla we thought we would try lunch on Saturday.

We made a reservation for 1:30 and I arrived on time. I asked when the kitchen was open until and was told 2:30. My Wife and son arrived around 1:40 but when they were seated at the counter with me, were told last orders were at 2pm.

We had a glass of wine each and a couple of plates but decided to move on somewhere else to finish lunch rather than get rushed and sit there and watch the kitchen staff pack up and prep for dinner.

I still love the food but I would only head back for a noon sitting and a little more time to enjoy it."
No Nonya dishes cooked with canola but Lolla is still lollapalooza,"The famous signature dish - uni on squid ink and egg yolk pudding - is innovative and truly sublime! I could easily have several of those in one meal! Other dishes are quite good (the simple tomato salad oozes sweetness and freshness), but not necessarily memorable: the ribeye steak could be more tender; there’s not much tongue in the beef tongue hash; the white asparagus is slightly overcooked. The biggest compliment to Lolla is the fact that these talented local chefs have succeeded in coming up with such innovative and good western dishes, even better than at restaurants headed by western chefs. Excellent service. I prefer to eat at the counter, and watch/talk to the chefs, rather than at the big communal table in the basement; you also get the dishes directly from the chefs! Pricey, but worth it!"
super extensive,"Nice place but super expensive in regards of you have in the plate , the place itself is nice and cosy , eating at the bar counter is always fun , in that case you could see how easy and simple the meals you ordered are made and also you can't then figure out what make your meal that expensive !"
We had a drink and wished we could stay to eat,"Interesting wine list. We had a delightful German Riesling while we sat at the bar watching the chefs cook and plate up delicious looking plates. If we didn’t already have a booking elsewhere we would have stayed. Is now on our list for next time we visit Singapore.
It’s a lovely space and had an intimate vibe.
There was a problem with our bill (overcharged) and they dealt with it immediately and without fuss. Impressed."
Fine food in a casual setting,Excellent food in such a relaxed setting. Food portions are just right for you to try a few things at once
Hygiene problem,"My Boyfriend and I were hyped about eating at Lolla but ended up leaving the restaurant in disgust. We were there for lunch and were seated at the counter seats where we could watch the chefs preparing food in the open kitchen. We were looking at menu, having discussion what to order and also looking at what the Chef was preparing. We saw the Chef was mixing tomatoes dices in a big silver salad bowl with dressing, then he took a spoon to scoop a serving of tomatoes and put the whole spoon into his mouth and to our HORROR, threw the used spoon back into the big bowl of diced tomatoes! My bf and I looked at each other and we couldn’t believe what we just saw right in front of our eyes! The Chef went to the inside of the kitchen where we couldn’t see what he was doing , few seconds later he came back with the diced tomatoes now put into a small silver container to be stored in the fridge. We complained this matter to the waiter and left without ordering anything because we are concerned with the hygiene standard of the restaurant. OMG, till now I am still shocked what we saw at the open kitchen."
Innovated seasonal dishes,We enjoyed Lolla first in 2014 (3visits) and now in March 2019 (2visits). Quality and standard the same -
Group dinner,excellent restaurant. The lamb and beef were just fantastic. Came there for a team dinner but would definitely come back. Great food!
Very good food!,Did a reservation and the place is not very big.. We get front row seats to watch the chefs. The food is really nice! Enjoy watching the chefs!
Simple buisy fusionrestaurant,We are happy with our choice of restaurant because of the atmosphere! It lacked side dishes on the menue to fit the sharingconcept.
V Day Dinner,"Food was excellent! We get to sit at the bar table right in front of the kitchen and were able to observe the chefs at work. Nice ambiance with good service. Will recommend the sea urchin pudding, ribeye steak and pork collar. Definitely a good place to go for a special occasion."
innovative and delicious,"my second visit to Lolla, great food, food innovative and delicious and great atmosphere and not rushed"
Gold Class,"@TheKuoKnows

Food doesn’t get any better than this, anywhere. I am surprised that Lolla hasn’t been awarded a Michelin Star yet.

The starter of Sea Urchin Pudding was unbelievably good, if you like uni. And I love uni. The pudding nestling below the uni was exquisitely prepared with squid ink. What a combo.

The Beef Tongue Escalope was melt-in-your-mouth tender. But it still had texture. The Sauteed Kale paired beautifully with the protein. Leave room for the Tarte Tatin.

I strongly recommend grabbing a seat at the bar in front of the kitchen. Chef Saifu and his team are a real joy to watch.

This place is better than excellent. It is Gold Class."
Great experience,"An original and interesting place offering seating at the bar, just facing the kitchen: we loved it!
It is always a pleasure to be able to interact with the Chef.
We started with their famous sea urchin pudding, waow! Creamy, rich and really tasty, we picked a Sancerre white wine to go with it. That was a great start!
Some bread with a special butter helped to wait a couple of minutes for our grilled squid: delicious too.
And then we had the rib eye, excellent really, along with the sautéed potatoes.
Nice wines list available for the reds too, so we tried the Rioja, perfect match with the beef.
A nice tart tatin to finish on a sweet note, a coffee and that was the end of this unique experience.
Not cheap though...
We'll be back guys!"
Overpriced,Don't bother. Their tomato salad is a joke. Price for the quality and quantity is just too much. There are much better options out there for a nice lunch.
OMG this is heaven !,"Fresh food cooked in front of you with an amazing blend of flavors. I recommend the sea urchin pudding and the kombu butter ! The gnocchi with chestnut, sage and burnt butter 😍 Good selection of wines by the glass to pair with your food."
Pleasantly Surprised.......,"I went to Lolla on a recommendation as I do to all restaurants I want to try in Singapore, with cautious optimism! There is nothing worse than spending money on food and coming out disappointed or still hungry, it happens a lot in this city. I am happy to report our visit here was definitely worthwhile. We sat up at the counter upstairs rather than the sharing table downstairs. As a first time visitor sitting at the counter is good because you can see all the food being made and ask questions, which the head chef and manager was happy to answer even though they were busy. They had some specials and we ordered the foie gras parfait which was excellent and silky smooth. On the main menu we tried the sea urchin pudding which was unusual. I am not a big fan of sea urchin but this was good and half an order was perfect. We then had a combination of main courses and starters, both my wife and I were impressed with the food. No room for dessert but we will try the Scamorza next time, which is melted cheese and the steamed chocolate pudding also looked interesting.
Overall its not cheap but not outrageously expensive. We ate a lot of food. This was a meal that was worth the $340 with a bottle of wine........so much so that I am taking 12 people from my office here again this week for dinner.
They are a little funky with their seating times, but if you can get in its worth eating here."
Worth every dime,"The staffs were friendly and the chefs were a master at their craft, watching them prepare our meal elevated the taste as we get to experience their level of concentration and effort into making each dish. Definitely worth every dime you spend. But will be better to go in larger groups so you can sample more of their unique dishes."
Lolla has upped her game,"Uni pudding was amazing as usual, but what blew us away were the wok hero chanterelles. Definitely a place to pamper your palette, but be prepared for smaller portions. Will love to be a regular if it’s not so pricy."
Once great - now not,Uni pudding still outstanding and unique and the food mostly good but a general attitude of boredom and lack of service. Also need to work on cleaning kitchen since it is in full view.
Great Experience,"Nice discovery, food and service was great, we did the 5 course tasting, Chef Ivan was really attentive to every plateThank you"
Misleading information,"We arrived on Sunday at 2:40pm we were denied entry, the staff arguing that 2:30pm is the time for last order. Yet on the website and the front door it’s written 3pm on Sunday. Not appreciated."
Brunch,"Sensational flavors, delicious food. Very friendly staff. Service was fabulous. The grilled avocado was excellent as was the fish and the mussels. Everything was superb!"
Lolla,Not as good as before. The Sea Urchin Pudding and Scrambled egg with Roes has a very strong piscine taste.
No regrets,Amazing experience. Top notch service. The uni pudding is indeed legendary. Will be back for more and to try other stuff.
Exceeded expectations,Walked by while visiting Yen across the road. Decided to check it out. Wow blown away by creativity in the food and passion whilst they cook at the open kitchen in front of you. Will definitely be back!
