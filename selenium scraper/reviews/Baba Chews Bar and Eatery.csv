Service,"The service is very good especially one of her waitress named Manivel. She is very passionate and very aggressive to talk with me. Also, she always asked me what we require."
Wonderful service and delicious food,It was an absolute pleasure dining at Baba Chews. The staff were incredibly welcoming and the food was delicious! Will certainly coming back soon.
Worth a visit,"Decent options of food
Came in good time but the place was quiet
Staff were a bit quick telling us what was ‚Äòoff‚Äô the menu although there were still enough options.
Maryland chicken was ok and Beef Rendang was quite good but needed more sauce which they brought on request.
Worth a visit and family friendly"
Lovely Company and Great Drinks,"We had drinks at Baba Chews today, Jan 24, 2023.
Bittersweet cause it will probably take a while for us to meet up again like this‚Ä¶ We definitely chose the perfect place for our last night. Just look at how pretty the cocktails are. Oh they have really good breakfast too, plus friendly and accommodating servers which was a big highlight specially in a foreign place, our favourite was Marivel‚Ä¶ She‚Äôs all smiles."
Spectacular breakfast options,"The breakfast was the best part of the stay over the week. Both western and Asian options are very high quality. Thank you to Merry, Fizal and Kelly who welcomed us every morning and delivered world class service at 6am !"

Delicious and Great Service,"I could smell how delicious this restaurant smelled from the lobby so I had to try it! Marivel was my server and she was very charismatic, attentive and overall helpful.

Compliment,"We had CNY Lunch here at Baba Chews (Katong) and the food and service were exceptional. The staff Mariel , Faizal and Christian were very customer oriented and make our lunch very enjoyable. Will definately return. Keep it up!!!!"
One of the nicest restaurants in the east,"I never really noticed this place until this morning (the starbucks next door kind of hogs all the attention)... and boy am I glad to have discovered it like some rare pebble that finally caught your eye on a beach you always stroll by at sunset. well, this place literally is not that far from the shorelines at east coast, but that's about where the analogy ends. because nothing short of catching the next wave would an appropriate description of the gastronomic delight I experienced here, not least for the superb service I received (I was pleasantly surprised at how they could accommodate my semi-vegetarian diet by customizing the dish to the extent they did). of course, what I ended up with was a fried rice dish that is nowhere found on the menu--but that's the whole idea of having a whale of a time :) special shoutout to Merry, Faizal, and Alax for their great hospitality. Will come back soon."
Great Food & Service,"As a gust of the Hotel √çndigo I received a very good service during both Braekfast and Dinner hours and the food in general was very good always well served and delicious. I also want to make a special mention for thw good service I received from Marivel, Alex and Sean during dinner time. They were always kind and friendly.
I highly recomend Baba Chews to have a good metal and drink in Singapore."
Friendly and personal service.,"Went there on 19/1 to celebrate my friend's birthday.
The food is good and the service is excellent.
Marivel and Faizal are very friendly and helpful.
They are able to explain very clearly the food in the menu.
My friends and I enjoy the lunch very much.
Will definitely go back again."
Love the atmosphere,"We love their outdoor seating area, with or without our furkids. Visited twice, the food was good. Love the dessert as well, just not a big fan of the chendol popcorn, but my friends like it. I appreciate the creativity just not the popcorn.

The staff are very helpful and friendly as well. Thank you Marvel, Alex and Sean for the great service. Will be back again to explore different dishes."
Awesome Food and Superb Service,"Baba and Chews is one of fantastic perenakan and western fusion food we ever dine.

Thanks Ms Marivel,and Merry and the other staffs for awesome service.
Highly recommended resto and bar."
Very good service,The service staff were excellent. Very friendly and making sure that you enjoyed your meal. We were served by Merry and Marivel. Two lovely ladies who went the extra mile to make sure everything was to our liking. The restaurant deco is also very lovely.
Baba Chew in Hotel Indigo,"Very good service, very delicious food & very entertaining staff. Thanks to Miss Marivel, I ready appreciate the services of Babachew."
A nice find in a lovely setting,"We stopped by babachews by chance wanting something hot rather than typical bakery which is common in the area. We we‚Äôre greeted most warmly by Mariuel. While the restaurant was quiet with others working she placed us perfectly so we didn‚Äôt feel as though we were disrupting anyone else but also in a good spot for watching people go by. The food was delicious and came out promptly, I also felt the cost was reasonable. The bird of paradise cocktail was excellent and not overpriced which is surprising as part of a hotel. The space is nicely designed and is well presented, clean and comfortable. Overall a good find in the old neighbourhood."
Good service,"Dinner here is always good. won‚Äôt be here for Michelin meals, that‚Äôs not what it‚Äôs forced is for great comforting / friendly service and reasonable food. Marivel the waitress here is always putting up the happiest smile! Highly recommended for a stress-free casual dinner."

Best Pulled Coffee & Tea By Kelly & Marivel,A place that I will always drop by for a cup of pulled coffee or pulled tea if I am in Katong! They taste the best when prepared by Kelly or Marivel. Always greeted by the warm personality of Marivel who makes sure me and / or my friend are well taken care at the cafe! It‚Äôs our comfort space in Katong!
New Year's Lunch with the family!,"Chose Baba Chews for lunch on New Year's with my family and didn't regret it. Both the food and service was good!

Daily breakfast buffet at Baba Chews,"We stayed at Hotel Indigo for 2 weeks and had daily breakfast at baba chew. The spread was pretty impressive especially the fresh squeezed juices.

Beautiful experience,"It‚Äôs underrated, the vibe the food and the atmosphere, it‚Äôs really subtle and clam.

Thank you Baba Chew!"

Baba Chew,"Good food, nice ambience and Excellent service from Marivel and Merry. Lovely people. Will come back again"
Best restaurant ever,"Amazing stay! Best hotel I have ever stayed in, and attached restaurant was fabulous, staff members Merry, Marivel and Ferizal took fantastic care of us.Pool and rooftop bar were outstanding, and the breakfast was out of this world. Will do our best to come back!!!"
Amazing breakfast!,"We stayed at the Hotel Indigo and had our breakfast at Baba Chews. Can‚Äôt recommend it enough - amazing coffee, gorgeous buffet, lots of fabulous a la carte dishes, and the loveliest service. We even got a complementary Christmas dessert Thank you!"
breakfast of a life time!,"we visited the indigo for only a night on our stop over. however it thoroughly wowed us despite the short stay. this attached restaurant baba chews was spectacular. the breakfast was a buffet and included western and Singaporean options. service in the restaurant was just as incredible as inside the hotel, Marivel and Merry were efficient, chatty and made us feel at home. our only qualm is that we weren‚Äôt able to stay longer and keep coming back. can‚Äôt recommend enough. love! love! love!"
Excellent niche place to eat & dine,"Staying in Indigo Katong for last 7 days, have been eating breakfast in Baba Chews, hosts are excellent, very courteous. They took care of our requests and made sure we are comfortable. I want to specifically call out and thank Merry & Kelly for doing a very good job."
Business dinner with management team,"Marive L did an excellent job hosting 7 of us at dinner last night. The ambience and service was pleasant and food was delicious and fair value.

Two negative points,
1. Kueh pie Tee was cold
2. Took a long time to serve the Cha Kuay Teow"
Great food and service,"Service here was really good and also fast. I only came here for breakfast but was really impressed with the quality of food. Highly recommend the Eggs Royale. Although you only get one egg! The smoked salmon under the egg has been mashed, making it easier to eat than in slices."
Perfect location for authentic celebration,"Baba Chews serves traditional Baba cuisine with a fusion touch. Location is great with nice ambience. Must try is the chicken keluak satay! Marivel was also a really good manager on duty, she checks and makes sure we‚Äôre well taken care of."
"Baba Chews bar and Eatery, the best in the City!","Good quality food and beverages. The ambient is great! Clean and tidy. The service is extraordinary. The crew, specially Marivel is so pleasant and entertaining. Friendly and comfortable environment. Will definitely recommend this to all my friends. Thank you!"
A good experience,"In Singapore for business, I came to this restaurant that I really liked, clean and good options for westerners, the breakfasts are incredible but the most important thing is its people, always friendly, also in the afternoon I went back to eat and Marivel from the Philippines the most special of all the waitresses! Thank you for making my menu special every day! Thank you"
Great experience and excellent food,Brought my godpa from Ireland here and we had such a good time.Mariavel was great and really attentive. The food came quickly and was delicious. I will definitely be dropping by again
"Very thoughtful, tip-top service","The service is fantastic. The outdoor section with parasols is dog-friendly so we booked a table for dinner bringing along our dog. Unfortunately it was drizzling slightly, Aeron and the other waiters had to serve the meal with only one hand while the other hand held an umbrella, making sure our food stayed dry. Thank you for the great service. Will come back often."
Nice late lunch,"My son is 18, on the severe end of autism and has disruptive behaviour. Having meals with him out of the house meant tremendous stress for him and me. I called the restaurant 15 mins before arrival, explained and requested for a quiet corner for 5. Kelly answered the call and was accommodating.
We arrived to find that we were given a nice quiet corner. We chose to have lunch after 2 to avoid crowd. Kelly was prompt and rendered great service. The ambience was relaxed and we enjoyed our meal. The volcano didn‚Äôt erupt and we left happily. Thank you to Kelly and her colleagues."
Fantastic Breakfast,"Really great breakfast and incredible team who are very attentive, polite and cheerful. Special shout-out to Ms. Berry who goes the extra mile every day I have been here. If you stay at the Indigo, make sure you add breakfast. Well worth it."
Commendation - Excellent Customer Service and Professionalism by Baba Chew Team / Hotel Indigo Katong Singapore,"Dear Mr. Barr and the IHG Team,

My partner and I had very positive feedback on your team and I personally would like to let you know. You may commend the men and women who had tirelessly worked hard and went above and beyond their call of duty.

Also, I seriously think Christian Valenzuela should be manager instead of acting manager. He rallied the team to create a memorable experience.

My partner's statement in full below.

On behalf of my partner, we are pleased with the excellent service and professionalism displayed by your team members at Baba Chew Restaurant, Hotel Indigo Katong, Singapore.

We have organised our first pet-friendly birthday celebration with 50 guests on 19 November 2022, Saturday. The Service Crew took great initiative in helping us with the decoration set up, adapting to the service sequence and receptive to ideas and feedback - especially when we instructed the team at the very last minute to present our dog‚Äôs picture once food is served on the table.

Drinks were replenished, crew attended to guest's requests and service was promptly attended.

A special menu was created for the event including the in-house special burger, quesadilla, nonya fried rice and Char Kway Teow. Guests were praising how each dish was well presented, full of flavour, taste and importantly served while still hot.

We believe that people are indeed the greatest asset to any organisation and indeed this set of team has proven and shown what great customer care and service was all about.

We commend the following crew:

Service Team: Lucy, Kelly, Marivel, Aeroli, Alex, Christian and Sean
Kitchen Team: Meng, Kah Chon, Ah Tok, Calvin, Iswary and Hweew

Thank you to all team members for their extra mile of service and making this a truly special and memorable night."
"Nice ambiance, very friendly staff","Had breakfast here for 8 days while on business trip. This was my favorite part of the day. Food quality excellent, staff super friendly. Thanks to Merry and Kelly for the wonderful service."
Will go back again,"Ambience was perfect for couples and families and larger groups. Need to reserve.
Merival was very helpful and kind, knows what she‚Äôs doing and makes you very comfortable during your time there. She will try her very best to assist you in any way and very attentive with a personal touch. Recommend for her to serve you, she‚Äôs very patient and recommends the perfect dish for you to order. Will love to go back again. Check out their menu and prices online to give you an idea of the dishes before heading down. Enjoy your time there if you dine!"
Great service,"Went there to celebrate my sister‚Äôs birthday. Food was good with an interesting twist to the usual peranakan flavours. We had the beef rendang, granchio, chap chye and calamari. The wait for the granchio was pretty long and even though we weren‚Äôt upset about it, we were offered an ayam buah beluak on the house. Thanks for the great service! We will be back if we get the chance :)"
A Very Pleasant Meal at Baba Chews,"We brought our family to have our reunion dinner at Baba Chews this evening. Ms. Marivel is so welcoming & so helpful! She gave us a nice table, introduced customers‚Äô favorite dishes to us. The 7 of us all enjoyed our food there. Everyone commented what a wonderful restaurant Baba Chews is! We all agree we want to go back & dine there again. Thank You to Ms. Marivel for her great service & very friendly welcome! Much appreciated!"
Almost unedible,"We shared three courses among ourselves and all three were almost inedoble, meats were dry and chewy and sauces tasted as If they were straight from an HP bottle. Definitely not worth the hefty 130$"
Super friendly nice place for drink and eats,This serves interesting dishes of mixed local european food and served by friendly staff. Good wine list and cocktails all affordable. A great place to go for good food at reasonable cost.
Outstanding service,"It was a great pleasure to have a breakfast and dine in Baba Chews during a week visit of Singapore.

Delicious breakfast with fruits and bakery have been a nice start of the day.

Various tastes of a dinner have been a nice end of the day. Especially can recommend Angus bites with cold beer.

Beside of that want to say thank you to Aeron for a great service during those days."
Innovative Baba!,"I hosted a group of 5 friends for lunch and we enjoyed the innovative Peranakan menu that we sampled. It's clearly a popular place especially for lunch and the staff struggled a bit with dealing with the orders, but in this case it made it worth the wait."
"Kelly, Merry, Lucy and Christian team !","My partner and I were in Hotel Indigo for two weeks. Merry, Christian, Kelly and Lucy were there to help us during all our stay. No matter how early or late it was during the day, they hosted us with generous smiles."
Lovely pet-friendly spot to chill the night away,"A nice and cozy enclave where one can relax and enjoy cocktails. Super chill vibes! We were served by Aeron, who was attentive to our every need."
Great food and service. Must visit!!!!,"The restaurant has nice ambient music, very clean and the staff is very polite.
I was assisted by a kind young man called Sangar, who gave me guidance on what to order for food and drinks (even pointed out a 2-for-1 promotion). Aeron also helped me.
The portion is very well-sized. I had a pita pocket of pork belly (kra pow), and it comes with a small salad garnish. The food was SO TASTEFUL! You can literally get all different flavors from the pork, onions, cilantro... simply AMAZING.
Take you time to visit and ENJOY."
"Great food, excellent service.",A fabulous selection of food & first class attentive service. Even made an off menu item available. This also is the breakfast venue for the adjacent Indigo Hotel. Excellent western choices & local favourites all fresh all high quality.
Amazing Food for Any Meal - Even Better People,"I started frequenting Baba Chews because it was where the included breakfast was for the Indigo Hotel. Over the next two weeks I found myself at the restaurant 2-3 times a day due to the quality of the food and drinks, the welcoming natural lighting, and the incredible kindness, friendliness, professionalism, and humor of the staff.

The morning breakfast is an outstanding continental spread of fruits, yogurts, juices, breads, fish, and any number of spreads and jams. The coffee here is exceptional, especially the cappuccino. There's the opportunity to pair a western or asian style breakfast item - eggs, french toast, pancakes, Nasi Lemak, Nasi Goreng - you name it. The food is spectacular and the team working here was fast, responsive, cheerful, and an honest pleasure to be around.

The quality of food continues throughout the day with great lunch and dinner offerings - the Short Ribs Rendang and the Nyonya Fried Rice were two of my favorites. The tall, ice cold Tiger Beers don't hurt either.

The restaurant is spacious, surrounded by bars, restaurants, and malls, with great natural lighting. It really seemed to be perfect for either families, solo travelers, or after-work groups.

I can't say enough about the quality of the people who work here - Merry, Kelly, Lucy, and Aeron were an absolute pleasure and made every visit a positive and enjoyable one.

Would highly recommend this restaurant for food and/or drinks any time you're in the East Coast area. The location, people, food, and beverages can't be beat."
Some of the best hospitality I‚Äôve had in Singapore,"I visited Baba Chews early this morning while waiting for my hotel room to be ready (not Indigo). Merry and Kelly, and the team, all made me feel extremely welcome and able to relax for a good amount of time after an overnight flight and not sleeping at all. The Americano was particularly good if you like strong coffee. The fish congee (salmon) tasted great too, although I think it had butter or something in it so maybe ask without that if you don‚Äôt want that. They gave some of the best service I‚Äôve experienced here in SG after coming here for many years, and I also watched them handle large groups well too."
"Stay at Hotel Indigo, Katong Singapore","Dear All

Everything is perfect,"Friendly staff, good service good coffee good food
Will visit again when we go to Singapore next time!
Thank u Boss Kelly Merry Rosa"
Celebrating a birthday,"Food was very tasty, service staff went the extra mile to celebrate my mom's birthday. Portion sizes are alittle small and the kopi c spare ribs were very sweet."
Some hits and misses,Good rendang and nasi goreng. Chap Chye is nice but too small. Gula Melaka cake was too sweet for me but my mum likes it. Overall quite expensive. Nice quiet place to dine
Chilled Casual dining,"Great spot for casual dining. They also have an outdoor area that is pet friendly. Highly recommend the beef rendang and the prawn pasta.

Service is excellent. If sat outside book a table near the fans."
Great Service,"Food is good but the service is great. The ambiance of the restaurant is nice. Thank you Christian for the complementary dessert
Highly recommended."
"Baba Chews, I choose you!","5‚≠êÔ∏è Ambience
5‚≠êÔ∏è Food Quality
5‚≠êÔ∏è Service by Christian

Saw this restaurant on Metro Lifestyle Vlog and flew here in Singapore just to try it"
1st visit because of The Crawl Singapore,"We visited Baba Chews for the first time to cap our Singapore tour. As they say more than the food, the people will make you comeback. A big kudos to Christian for very helpful in suggesting what to eat and very accommodating"
Great Food and Wonderful Service! Shout out to Christian!,I had a great experience with my friends dining in. Great food at a reasonable prics. Christian was awesome serving us!
Great service by a staff named Christian,"Staff (Christian) was polite, patience and helpful.
Food - we only had desserts. Kueh durian was not bad. Chendol was pretty unique with the popcorn and having to use chopsticks.
Drinks - House-made sodas tasted pretty bad."
Enjoying yummy food!,"Awesome experience at Baba Chew! From the moment we step into the restaurant, we were greeted by the friendly staff. Food is really yummy! Highly recommended! Will be back to the restaurant for meals again soon."
Not a Peranakan Restaurant,"The restaurant should not claim to be a Peranakan restaurant if the food served is very far from what the cuisine is known for. The most disappointing on the menu is the kueh pie tie which is both tiny and tastes like it has been filled with ""expensive"" canned food. While the service is fair and the atmosphere is great for its location, this was not enough to make up for the misleading restaurant name. This is the second time I've been to this restaurant in the past 5 years and I was terribly disappointed yet again. I hope the restaurant will consider giving their menu an overhaul, or to just remove the word ""Baba"" from their name because it is doing a disservice to the community."
Fantastic food and service,"Very nice and authentic peranakan food. Service was excellent by Christian. Best dishes were the chap chye, beef rendang, chicken buah keluak."
"Kid friendly, dog friendly, wonderful food and staff!","We went there to celebrate my helper's birthday. I love that it is dog friendly so we brought all our dogs along! Good as there's lots of space for kids to run about. It is a pretty outdoor dining area. Definitely Instagram worthy! Food was fabulous and service was amazing too! Thank you Christian, Lucy and Kelly for the wonderful service! They gave us a free cake knowing that we were there to celebrate a birthday ! Will definitely be back again!"
2 Thumbs u for the Excellent service and great ambience,"I would have given this eatery an excellent rating for overall experience but because the menu has limited choices, hence I gave it a 'very good', hoping they can add on more variety to the food choices. Ordered the kueh pie tie which was just normal kueh pie tie priced at $10, which I feel was way overpriced. Quesadilla Chicken rendang was good. Ayam Buah Keluak was flavourful and the chicken was really tender. The fish and chips remained crispy and hot despite been left for a long time. Food overall was nice but it was not that great that will make me go back for the 2nd time. We wanted to order a cake but was too full after 2 small bites and 2 mains. I RSVP this place via chope and indicated it was for a birthday celebration for my mom. Service was spot on from the start to the end. Just after we finished our meals, one of the staff (I assumed was the manager) came over and checked if we were there for a birthday celebration and said he will arrange for something. We were surprised with a nicely decorated piece of complimentary ondeh ondeh cake and the staffs sang birthday song. What impressed me was the staff did noticed what was indicated on the RSVP note. To me it makes the whole dining experience a great one! The ambience of the place was also good for friends and family to just chill out. There was also an outdoor space for after dinner drinks for chats and laughters."
Excellent service and delicious food!,Had a pleasant dining experience with my friends and we felt welcome by the staff. Fast service and the food are delicious! I highly recommend to order Baba Satay & Chicken Lasagne. The food ingredients were premium and I could taste it at every bite. Thank you baba chews for the excellent hospitality and surly we will be back again!
Excellent service and beautiful atmosphere,"Went there to dine with my friends last week, the design of the restaurant and the atmosphere are really beautiful to bring your date there! Love the satay and staffs were attentive and friendly."
Gathering with friend,"I have a great dinner at babachews and this my first visit,thank you their staff (LUCY) for recommend"
Dun expect Peranakan,"Atmosphere was good
Food was not Peranakan although the name is.
Don‚Äôt taste Peranakan for those dishes tht we‚Äôre Peranakan. And yes, price is on the high side."
Extremely overpriced,"Not a Peranakan restaurant although they do have 4 Peranakan dishes on their menu but it was super overpriced for those dishes. Beef Rendang with about 5 - 6 pieces of small sized beef cost $32, the Ayam Buah Keluak with 1 piece of chicken thigh cost $25. The Chendol is $11!

A complete mismatch of the identity and cuisine:
- Identity... named like a Peranakan but serves Modern Asian and Western food
- Cuisine...menu is very limited and steered towards Asian/Western Food but kept some Peranakan dishes as we have ordered.

Staff were very inexperienced and service was slow.

Bad hit with the restaurant - in summary, food, service and value for money way way underwhelming. It's been struck off from ever going again."
Wished it was more authentic,"I understand that the menu is fusion and catered to hotel guests but I wish it would have some authentic type cuisine for the locals. After all it is located in Katong.
So speaking to friends living in the area, they rather go somewhere for peranakan food. Maybe something to think about when redoing the menu."
Delicious lasagne and good service,We had a pleasant evening at Baba Chews. Dinner was delicious and the service was good. Baba Chews has a nice ambience where we spent hours talking over wine after having dinner. The chicken lasagne is highly recommended.
Lovely dinner with the family with amazing service,"Christian and Lucy have been so attentive and pleasant all throughout our dining experience. It‚Äôs been a warm and cosy dinner with the family celebrating my birthday with a cake on the house, we feel right at home!:)"
Overall great ambience and food!,"Food was a nice fusion and lots of hits with us. Overall ambience was great, will make a return trip here w my family. Try the otah youtiao, rendang, buah keluak, prawn pasta, durian pancake. Especially great service from Elisia, overall a great experience. Oh yes their draft beer is v fresh too."
Meaningful night made wonderful!,"We had our ROM dinner party here, and we would like to especially thank Irene and her team for helping us to make our special night memorable and smooth! Irene has been wonderful from day one of planning and helped us every step of the way, answering questions patiently and proactively checking on details with us. Even on that day, she made us feel relaxed and made sure we were okay throughout.

Her team of servers, bartender (Kris) was also prompt and efficient and not to mention the amazing food all our guests enjoyed that night! Super recommend having your special night here or even having dinner at this cosy restaurant and bar! Thank you all at Baba Chews!!"
Nice fusion food,"Had the Chicken Rendang Lagsane, which was good. And the lemon tea was nice!

Shout-out to Ms. Elisia who was very hospitable and made our dining experience a very pleasant one!"
üëçüëç,The Ayam Buah keluak taste nice. Mix the chicken with Sambal is super yummy. And the buah keluak fish & chip is very juicy and crispy. Overall all the food is very delicious .
"Good flavours, creative menu (slightly pricey but understandable)","Chope had 10% off for $50 voucher so it‚Äôs good to book with chope
Enjoyed the ambience. Ordered the otah youtiaos, chili crab tagliatelle and chicken rendang lasagne. Would definitely be back to bring my family here
Felt the menu was slightly limited though, hopefully there can be more variety for returning customers! Desserts also was limited on the Saturday that I went.

Nonetheless. Thanks for the great service and good food!"
Simply perfect!,"Restaurant ambience is outstanding, the alfresco setting will really set the mood to relax and chill. All the staffs are nice and welcoming. Excellent customer service to all of them (Jollie, Irene and the rest)"
