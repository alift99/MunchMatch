My darling hubby's birthday üéÇ,Such wonderful and attentive service.. thank you! They even gave us a complimentary lil mud cake. üòä thanks üòä üòò
Amazing Experience!,"Mr. Stork was a little hard to find at first, but once we got up to the roof it was an amazing experience! The staff was really nice, we got seated at a table for two with a great view over the city. Mike, our waiter, was lovely! He even told us some fun facts about the cocktails (which tasted amazing btw.). All in all a great experience and definitely worth the money!!"
Lovely experience,"Amazing service by the staffs and signature cocktails and lovely views .A must visit place in Singapore. Nice smoking area with garden at the back ,, very relaxing ."
Fabulous,"Fantastic 360 panoramic views across Singapore, extremely helpful staff and best cocktails I've tasted... Mike, Gogul and their team were rightly proud of the roof top bar. This place is CARD ONLY, be warned!!! However, they still managed to serve us, despite our cash situation- we hadn't read that info before we got there. This place is seriously worth a visit, menu looks very good too, although we didn't try anything. Thank you for giving us a truly memorable last night in Singapore."
Birthday celebration,Great ambience for celebration and fantastic service from the staff! Shelter might be insufficient for heavy rain.
Best Singapore sling,"Forget Raffles and head to Mr Stork, we went up there very last minute and were blown away by the view. The Singapore slings aren‚Äôt on their menu but we had a friend staying and needed to give them the full Singapore experience so asked the staff if they could make a sling for us and Mike and his team made the best Singapore sling we‚Äôve ever had. Delicious snacks and a beautiful sunset, highly recommend!"
Special Date,Hi I would like to thank Mr Stork for the amazing hospitality. Especially Mr Jack who ensured that we had a memorable date together.
Unforgettable visit,"Visited Mr Stork while in Singapore, visiting from NYC. Started to rain a bit, but Mike saw it coming and prepared a covered area for us at the bar. He and Gogul made sure we stayed dry and comfortable, and Gogul mixes amazing drinks. Their attention surpassed what we experience in the states, and we‚Äôll always remember our time here, and the views!"
Mr. Stork Rooftop Bar,"My husband and I came to Mr. Stork and had the best time. Beautiful city views, excellent cocktails, and delicious food. Mike and his team went above and beyond to make sure our night was special. Couldn‚Äôt recommend it more!"
Mr Jack @ Mr Stoke,"We all know that year end in Singapore is a rainy season‚Ä¶when we arrived the sky was grey and the wind was blowing furiously, despite the uncertainly ahead, we had an amazing time here at Mr Stoke and Jack made all the difference‚Ä¶from his friendly service, humor that he will help pray that the rain will not bestow upon us. It worked!! Great service these days are hard to come by. Mr Stoke is a gem, so is Jack. The house red NZ Pinot noir was a good choice and chefs selections are great value if you want a variety of taste. My booking was 7pm however they let me in at 6pm to walk around. The $200 min spend for the trapeze tent booking let‚Äôs u stay till the place close at midnight."
"Lovely view, great service","Lovely place to bring guests and have drinks. Our servicer, Jack, provides such great service. He made our experience there even nicer! Thanks Jack!"
Fabulous views & Fabulous Service,"We came here for the views and it did not disappoint. Carlo looked after us so well, even organising a brolly during a rain interlude whilst taking photos. Super cocktails and most importantly- friendly service. We will be back!"
Food and Drinks,"Great view, great food and drinks. Service was excellent. Especially the waiter named Carlos. It was a really excellent drinking session"
Nice rooftop view but food is just 'meh',The city view is great but food option is limited and mostly is snacks bite kind of food. Drinks menu is more choices. The place is not for dinner. The food taste average and overpriced!
"Great View, Wonderful Service",Great ambience and 360 view of the Singapore skyline. Special mention to service staff Jack who graciously went out of his way to make us comfortable and attend to our needs!
Anniversary,Very good ambience and splendid view. Service by carlo and team were great and we thoroughly enjoyed our anniversary here.
Open air and amazing cocktails!,"Amazing cocktails... the freshness and flavours were excellent and nothing we have tasted in Singapore. The local flavours and cocktails I think has to be highlight. Siam Fling and Amrita are both highly recommended.

The ambience is nice and breezy. The open air rooftop but with no loud music is a welcome change.

Mike was kind enough to give a complimentary cake for anniversary."
Nice amnience,"Cozy and chill ambience, excellent services especially the team leader his name is Mike. Have a wonderful anniversary night over here, And today we‚Äôre quite lucky, weather is good n cold as well."
Great experience as usual!,Nice drinks and service with a great view. The waiter Jack was very attentive and helpful for sure! Highly recommended!
Great service and ambience,"My hubby and I enjoyed the bar treats and the drinks were amazing!!! The service was great, especially Mr Mike who was so friendly and accommodating. And super sweet on sending us the cake. Will definitely revisit this place. P.s: the view is great"
What a fantastic day,Always I never regret to bring my guest! Especially tonight I had great time with my guests because of great support Call the name Jack! He will be with you
Brilliant night,Had a sensational evening at Mr Stork. Fairly unique view looking back across the bay and padang towards the CBD. Mike who took care of us was an absolute delight. Highly recommend!
Beautiful view with fantastic service,"Brought my friends from Taiwan here for the beautiful view and we were impressed with the excellent service by our server, Jack. He was extremely helpful and constantly checked in with us for our needs. Will definitely be back again!"
Cool place to chill with friends,First time visiting Mr Stock as introduce by me friends. The restaurant staff was friendly and responds quickly to out request. Special thanks to Ms Corwinn and Mr Carlos for their superb hospitality in making our trip memorable and wonderful
Mr Stock,"The scenery is good and the waiter mr.jack is also very friendlyüëç üíïThere are also many choices of alcohol. We chose red wine from Australia, which is a classic of this wine rangeüëç"
Mr Stork,"Simply outstanding. Enjoyed the view. Staff were courteous. Folks here allowed us to setup decor at their teepee which was added advantage for the birthday celebration. We were taken care by Mr. Idrus, he was extremely polite and cater our needs when required. Overall a nice experience. 5/5."
Nice view with best service,"Recommend to those who visit SG fist time, have pretty nice drink and view! Waiter is very welcoming as well"
Restau visit,"Good place to visit thanks to Dianne and Carlo for the wonderful service. View is relaxing, recommended for people who wanna go dating"
Nice view and food,Very nice view and the food also nice. Prefer watch sunset can choose 5.15slot and night view can choose 7.30pm slot Can come enjoy with friends
Not worth it...,Only good about the place seems to be that it's at level 39 giving pretty good view. V v limited food options especially for veggies....the red pepper hummus was not at all good to taste and was watery. I also fail to understand why the staff cannot be polite. There was one guy who mostly took our orders was quite rude. Not a good experience especially when we got our friends from abroad.
Nice view and atmosphere but overpriced,"The view and ambiance were great, and so was the service. But food is totally overpriced: very expensive and tiny portions. It is practically extorsion. Singapore sling is much too sweet, very disappointing."
Cozy Dinner,"Situated at 39th floor, this restaurant provides a good view of the city‚Äôs skyline. The service is prompt and efficient. The day we went it was drizzling, the restaurant has proper arrangement for umbrellas so the seating area was dry,, Not a great selection for Food but it is adequate. Will definitely go back again."
The Singapore skyline view is a given,"I agreed with all said about how beautiful the Skyline, sunset etc. The food is not to bad, drinks are fine too. Those service staff whom are wear a tuck out shirt can be better. Imaging having one of their staff pacing back and forth carry portable lights in front of our table while you were trying to enjoy the view, can be a little unpleasant. As environment sustainable is one of the concerns for our next generation, having food served on plastic / paper plate and utensils may not be ideal.

Summary:
Food - Skip
Drinks - Good selection
View - Amazing
Instagramable - Sure, why not
Service - Can be better (Can be more attentive to their guest, watch their tone of voice and choice of words)"
Worth to visit with a view and warm welcome,"I was an in-house guest and got welcomed very warmly by Jess who served me the best with the appropriate & professional reception.
Nice selection of beverages of alcohol & non-alcohol.
Relaxing moment with cool breeze and nice view over the city made my day. Thanks Jess."
Great atmosphere and audience,"Was served by Jeff, he was very polite and accomodating. Great experience and beautiful view. Enjoy the wind and good food"
Rain comments,"I haven't visited it yet. There were several comments about cancelling this place due to rain and I think that is prudent.

Used to live in the condo next door. Andaz IS the highest building in the area and it is metal and glass. TWICE I saw lightning flashes in my balcony.

Views are hard to beat."
Birthday over The Roof,Carlo and Team Serviced myself & I. I celebrated a Birthday with my bestie. They are attentive to our needs. And delighted us with a Birthday Complimentary Slice with name.
Relaxing rooftop bar!,Nice ambience and friendly service! A pleasant view from the roof top bar! Very relaxing. Food and drinks affordable for young people too!
Superb staff,"Organized a proposal to my partner in one of the cosy Teepee hut last week and the staff were so helpful and hospitable. I must compliment the service from Idrus and Cornia (sorry if I spelled it wrongly) for the reservation arrangement and on-site drinks and congratulatory cake, and also Cheri for helping me with the surprise and serving those lovely food and wine! Thank you Mr Stork and the team. Looking forward to be back again!

And hardly any restaurant and bar in sg offer such a 360 views up there! Great for couples!"
Really great view and service,Came here for my lovely wife‚Äôs birthday. We came without reservation and didn‚Äôt mention anything about my wife‚Äôs birthday. We sang happy birthday after we received our drinks. Mike heard us and was so kind to give my wife a birthday cake. A small gesture which made a very great deal. Thank you Mike for making it a great and memorable day.
Mr Stork,Amazing views. Great foood. Well priced for Singapore. Mike our waiter was amazing. Wonderful pictures and vibes. Nice people and great food and drinks
What‚Äôs with the disposable plates and cutlery,Dear Mr Stork Everything was great but what‚Äôs with the paper plates and disposable cutlery? Not what you expect from a 5* hotel and really lowers the tone.
Pleasant unexpected visit,"Went here on a Thursday night around 8 after being waitlisted at a nearby bar. Such a pleasant experience! Great view and great service by Carlo. Kinda wished we stayed here instead because the music (please tell me you have a playlist I can listen to lol) and vibes were more fun. Drinks aren't strong, which personally I enjoy. Felt a little rushed by upper management though, which we understood as we only ordered one drink and appetizer."
Service is disappointed for a top class hotel bar.,The view is excellent and the food is fine as well. But the the staff servicing attitude there is in line with the the level of Hawker center.
Excellently,Excellent service from Sky and Annabelle. Me and my Girlfriend had a great time! food was Singaporean style. Thank you service staff and bartender for the drink recommendation as well! Beautiful view wonderful night. :)
Must visit in Singapore,"Beautiful bar and restaurant overlooking a wonderful view. The service by Mike and his team is top notch with thoughtful anecdotes throughout the evening which really change it from just a bar, to an experience. Highly recommend"
Good drinks and service staff,"The staff were very friendly and accommodating. We arrived late and it was drizzling. They managed to arrange a table, serve our drinks fast and followed up if we needed anything else. When we paid the bill the staff asked us to wait and presented my husband with a birthday cake! In my booking I had added it was my husband's birthday. Very considerate staff. They even offered us complimentary shots."
Cool,"View was nice and would have been excellent had we caught a sunset (it was heavily overcast on our visit). The sliders were great and to top it all, EXCELLENT service from Carlo."
"Romantic, scenic","Had an amazing time here with a great company, view, and service. Special thanks to Carlo for the little surprise. Definitely worth visiting again and againüíñ"
Had a real chillax time with my ex,"Did an impromptu tunch here with the missus. Great view music, and breezy spot with 360 view of Singapore from Level. Had the Andaz Summerdale, crisp and with a strong citrus flavour to it. T
Just the right taste for a breezy cloudy afternoon. Attentive service from Carlo and Idrus. Will definitely be back for the sunset view."
"Drinks great, food not so much","The drinks are really good. The food, especially for the price, was disappointing. If you want a nice dinner this is not your place. If you want drinks before or after dinner in a nice setting, this is your place."
"Nice view, open space, friendly staff","The view is so nice. Perfect to watch sun set. Mike & his team super friendly, surprise us with a mini birthday cake & song. I like my drink the pink color & flower match perfectly."
"Great Time, Nice Night","Went with brother and bestfriend and we enjoyed ourselves. We got a bottle of Stranger and Sons Gin and it was good. As usual, the view was lovely!

Carlo was patient and friendly, as usual. Met V, Bryan, Edward, Mike and Hasith too and they were all very nice, cheerful and approachable. It was very nice meeting them! :) very good service and hospitality."
Great time,Mr Stork has brilliant views and even better service. The drinks we ordered were very specific and Carlo gave us exactly what we wanted with a mask-covered smile on his face. Definitely would recommend and visit again.
Birthday Visit To Mr Stork,My lovely Vik 20th birthday. Had such a wonderful time with stunning views. Mike the waiter was so so lovely and gave her a complimentary cake. amazing experience would recommend.
One of the Best Bar for me!,"Me and my husband visited Singapore and our friends brought us here! We were very amazed and the view is just jaw dropping! Idrus helped us in our reservation and Mike really made us feel that we are vvip. Exceptional service! Drinks are so delicious. This place should be nominated as one of the Best Bar, not only in Asia but also in the whole wide world."
Beauty at it‚Äôs finest,"Went there for the first time and it‚Äôs a love at first sight. Good ambience, service is impeccable, drinks are beyond expectation. I would like to highlight the splendid services rendered by Corwin, she welcomed us with her smile behind that mask. To Idrus‚Äôs marvellous services that leave‚Äôs you speechless, and check us every minute. And to Mike, who knows how to read your mind of what drinks you want to drink.

Overall was amazing and I can‚Äôt wait to bring more friends. Sure will be back ."
Great rooftop,Wonderful time here. Great place for girls night. Thank you Mike for the excellent service. We will be back soon.
Cocktails night with ladies,"We were served by Mike. He was so friendly. We really enjoyed our time at Mr Stork! Thank you, Mike! We will come back again"
Mr,"Had an amazing time, my first time in Singapore and very happy with the service especially Mike, he was an amazing service man and definitely deserves a promotion, very friendly and welcoming. All in all a great time, would recommend."
Celebrated my birthday evening at Mr Stork,"Quite good place, good view, and good serving staff. Restaurant also gave complimentary cake as I had marked the birthday celebration during online reservation booking. I have recommended my friends to give this place a try this. Best time to experience the view 6pm-8pm."
Dreadful Service,Took 40 mins for the drinks to arrive which arrived after the food and had to ask 3 times for the drinks to be delivered which was just a bottle of beer. No urgency and rude staff!
"Great view, average vibe","Great view, great service, below average cocktails, average vibe on a saturday night. I chose Mr Stork for a date night because I remember it being the hotspot (back in 2019 at least). But it didn't seem to the case anymore. I had to put down $50 for a table reservation and would have forfeited that in case of a no-show.
Also didn't understand the paper plates and cutlery- not classy at all."
Fantastic view and atmosphere!!!,"Arrived at 7:30pm. Excellent service by the waitress. Brought us to our table where we have a direct view of fireworks. (just happen to be NDP rehearsal event). Despite having a mass crowd, staff were very attentive and ensure everything is in order for us. Will visit again next time."
Don't make booking for important event here,"I cannot tell you anything about Mr. Stork. Except that Mr. Stork cancelled my reservation 5 hours before my booking time. Mr. Stork collected SG$400 for deposit but had no intention to provide reasonable service to us. The restaurant cancelled my booking because of light rain during lunch time and claimed that the curtains were wet. I believe it is not too difficult to keep the curtains in door during light rain. However, I think they believe that it is earlier to cancel clients' bookings by just a phone call. There was no rain during my evening booking time. I had to rush to secure another venue during Saturday evening for a special event. Therefore, if you have an important event, DO NOT BOOK THIS PLACE. THEY WILL CANCEL YOUR BOOKING EVEN WITH VERY LIGHT RAIN."
great view and atmosphere,"Our server, Mike was extremely friendly and met our needs when asked, the drinks were great and the food was decent, especially the cheese board and they were kind enough to bring a dessert for a birthday I had! Thank you, great experience to enjoy last few weeks in Singapore! Would recommend to people asking for a roof top bar! Also not too crowded for a Sunday evening and quite cool and not too humid up here"
Wonderful atmosphere,Wonderful atmosphere and excellent service by waitress Cheri that make my evening unforgettable.. will be back again for more good. Memories
Unartistic and pretentious.,"This is not a review about the people who welcomed and served us. They were hardworking, accommodating, very polite and professional.

With that out of the way, here it is: the place is pretentious. The decor and spacing is poorly designed. The views are not anything extraordinary, simply a higher perspective of a city. Not without potential, though. Yet, this too, has been underutilized due to the seating arrangements.

Seats are cloddish and honestly, better suited to a beach bar in terms of texture and material (rattan). Lighting, again, plastic (truly), monotonous and installed (placed, rather) without any consideration to poise or purpose.

But the worst of it all is the crockery and cutlery. Disposable. Everything disposable. You cannot take your bosses, potential employers, clients, peers, your beau or bae, to a place that claims to be so classy but makes you look clumsy because the disposable utensils do not hold down. It is, hands down, the greatest mood-killer of all. It follows that I am unable to review the food as I could not indulge any further in the exercise.

Philosophically speaking, not one of the natural elements : wind, rain, sky, earth or light, despite their abundance, are in sync with each other. (None of the materialistic elements, either, for that matter.) It is no wonder that that the lovely people who work there, for all their efforts and politeness, seem to be drawn to an aloof style of interacting.

I will not visit this place again. I'm quite positive that if the stylists (I doubt any were hired)/owners/ curators of Mr Stork were to visit it themselves, it would not meet their own expectations of basic comfort, access, sustainability and hospitality. The hosts idea of how to engage their customers in a memorable experience is very juvenile, while the claim and costs is premium.

Might I add that I am thankful for the service and and that I share my views hopeful of due consideration to the maturity of the well-versed audience in undertaking similar venture?"
"Great view, shocking price for kids drinks","It's a great bar type restaurant with amazing views. Food was tasty. Everything was reasonable price except one thing. A bit shocking when the server offered Shirley Tempe for my kid, 2 glasses cost us $40. Most expensive kids drink ever, more than Ritz-Carlton! So don't bring your kid there."
Great experience at MR STORK,First time being here with my friends and we really enjoy the beautiful scenery and staff Carlo very friendly and helpful. Satisfied with his service he's really a Gem üíé
"Special occasions dining,Good ambient and inexpensive.",Bring my spouse for birthday celebration..the staff was very nice to offer complimentary cakes as birthday treats..the view was absolutely good.Nice staff nice food value for $.
A lovely experience.,Beautiful roof top bar in Singapore. Its a very lively place with lovely ambience. The food is also good but very less vegetarian options. The sliders are good worth trying. A very good place to spend a evening.
One of the best top view restaurant/bar,Perfection. Chill. Bliss. Pure relaxation. Thanks Mike & team for serving us with smiles and service beyond expectations.
Mike is wonderful!,My partner and I celebrated our 2nd anniversary at Mr. Stork. Food and drinks were super delicious and satisfying! Worth every penny. We were served by Mike and he was very friendly and prompt with his service! Absolutely made our night wonderful ‚ù§Ô∏è
Best rooftop bar in Singapore,Best rooftop bar in Singapore! Best 360 views. Ask for Carlos who was an amazing host who looked after us and served us delicious cocktails!! Will definitely be returning
Fantastic,"The view food and drinks were great. Kimberly, our waitress, was amazing and she went above and beyond to give us the best treatment. She deserves a raise."
Unforgettable Sunset at Mr Stork,Its not easy to get a table if u dont book in advance. Well luck was with me & my friend & we manage to get a table on Sunday evening. Thanks to Corwinn for arranging us to sit at a table with the best sunset view! The food platter was awesome too. Most memorable sunset in Singapore! You can walk around and enjoy 360degrees view of entire Singapore. Thats why i love staying in Andaz. Convenient and near all eateries too.
Geat for looking at the moon too!,"We arrived slightly before 6:30 on Wednesday night with two questions: Do you serve food and do you have a table for 2. Corwinn at the door cheerfully informed us yes and yes but due to an event we would have to release our table at 7pm. The view on the 39th floor was stunning so even half an hour for a drink while the sun set would be ok. We ordered our drinks and watched as the sun disappeared behind the clouds and the lights on the buildings all around us winked on.

As we were contemplating where to go for dinner Corwinn returned to give us the good news that a table had freed up. And what a table! Located in the corner of the building it had a view of both marina bay and the raffles city/civic district. This time our table would be available until 9pm, so we proceeded to order our food. Our special requests were met with an initial ""let me ask"" and an eventual ""yes.""

As the evening turned into night we were enjoying our food and drinks when a bright patch of light over the sea caught my eye. It was the full moon rising!!!

Thank you Corwinn and Sky for a magical night out."
Friends catch up with a spectacular view,"Really wanted to try Mr. Stork since then but it is really challenging to get a table reservation. So we booked our table a month before and it‚Äôs worth it!
Overall, dining in at Mr. Stork was great and to mention the good service of Carlo. Foods and cocktails are perfect. We will definitely come back to try other drinks and foods on the menu and savour the good view, will try sunset time next."
perfect evening,"very attentive service, spectacular view, most beers were good, all cocktails were good, surely come again"
Birthday celebration,Awesome service support by Carlo. Attentive to details and willing to go extra mile to serve us well. Will come again
Stunning views,"Mr Stork is one of the best rooftop bars in Singapore in our opinion. We‚Äôve been here a few times in 2019 and 2022 whilst visiting Singapore. The 360 views are amazing, the staff very friendly and helpful, and ambience is fantastic. The bar is on the 39th floor of Andaz hotel so can see a lot of Singapore from up here!

Remember to book in advance though otherwise you could be standing at the bar a while waiting for a table to become available!"
Lovely experience at Mr Stork!,"Genuine service from Idrus and team, great ambience paired with amazing cocktails - made my night out! Recommend to try the Bartender‚Äôs Salute, made with the bartender‚Äôs fav spirits. My personal favourite, from Bartender Edward!"
Great place,Corwinn and Sky were very helpful. Great place and ambience. Food choices were limited but taste was great. Only thing is that you need to book ahead otherwise you will in for a very long inconvenient waiting time. But the staff are absolutely polite
Love all serve all,I had a staycation with my family to celebrate my 15th yr anniversary with my wife... Went up to Mr Stork... Well... Beers are limited... View is all right.. Perhaps we were assigned seats not with the best view... Service can be better really... It does make us wonder.. Was it because we r a local family cause we did witnessed others being served promptly and well...
"Great view, service & drinks","Great place with an amazing view, very friendly personal and delicious drinks. Cheri served us very well and knew exactly what to recommend. Thank you!"
Awesome open air rooftop bar !!,"The sunset dusk view @ The stork is so beautiful
the cocktail drinks are goes absolutely well with the chef platter
Kudos to ms Kimberley who is so welcoming and gives good recommendations and checks-in to make sure we are comfortable
Definitely we will like to come back again !!"
Excellent rooftop bar experience,"Amazing rooftop bar experience, perfect for our family occasion. Excellent service by Cheri, thank you! Will most definitely revisit"
Excellent Mr Stock,"Excellent service by Kimberly, Idrus, Corwinn, Julian. We were treated like VIPs! The service crew was helpful, friendly and warm. The view was stunning at 39th floor of the Andaz. We had a beautiful view of the skyline. Food and beverage was fantastic. We totally love the chilllax atmosphere."
Mr Stork,The service here is excellent especially the waitress name Cheri provide a wonderful recommendation of drinks and hospitality services
Great hang out place,Very good place to chill out with friends. Ambience is very good with panoramic view of the city. Service was excellent too! Indrus provided good recommendation for the drinks and food as well. Would be better off if there was a fan installed at the mini as the weather can get abit humid.
Bar manager Gogul Miue,Very approachable and sharing person who is friendly and knowledge about his scope of work. Good attitude. Highly recommended to chat with him if visiting this area. üëç
Mr Stork,"Our 1st time visiting Mr Stork.
We enjoyed our time here with the drinks and food.
Our table is being served by Cheri. A very nice gal, she took very nice picture of us with the sunset.
She also has the initiative to help us with our food and drinks order.
Had an enjoyable evening at Mr Stork."
"Great drinks, very improvable food and service","Drinks 5/5.
Food 1/5.
Service 1/5.

Drinks live up to the place. The rest is very improvable.

Also, please, put pillows in the teepees to accommodate guests with the comfort."
Amazing service and great scenery,"It was a friend's farewell dinner, and the service from Carlo was amazing. He accommodated our needs as we wanted to stay longer for more drinks despite the venue being booked out. Brought us to a quieter corner where my friends and I could chat and have fun while appreciating Singapore's beautiful city skyline."
100% top of the city,"Took a chance to pop by even though we didn't have a reservation and glad we took the leap! Fantastic views and well mannered guests all around and a very attentive manager Carlo on ground who made sure we were comfortable wherever we were and who managed the team on ground perfectly despite the overwhelming crowd. It was a great experience considering it was the first time bringing my expat girlfriends for a post-pandemic night out together. Very proud to have such hospitality displayed here at home.

We will be back as one of Carlo's regulars for sure ;)"
"awesome scenery, service and drinks","have always wanted to come to Mr Stork and finally had a chance to when I came for a birthday celebration with my friend! GREAT service and beautiful scenery and lovely atmosphere! Particularly love the chocolate mint brownie with a hint of alcohol in it. we sat at the bar table and we managed to get a glimpse of how the bartenders whipped up drinks and we were so amused at the amazing service given by our bartenders, Hasith & Bryan!! They took the initiative to engage in small talks with us to gather our feedback on the drinks, which made our experience more memorable!!

Will definitely be back again in July with their revamped menu! GREATT job to Hasith and Bryan!!"
Excellent service in spite of all the crowd challenges,We booked a table for a company farewell. Due to policies they could initially only give us the table for 2 hours but we wanted to stay longer. Carlo and his team were super accommodating trying to make it happen in spite of their being a full crowd that evening with other bookings. They went out of their way to provide good service in spite of the crowd. Really appreciate it that Carlo even remembered some of us and our orders from a prior visit. Definitely made the night a good one!
Drinks with friends,"Amazing views, drinks and vibes. Carlo and gogul helped me and my friends relax and enjoy the surroundings. Would defiantly recommend"
Cosy place with great ambience,Cosy place for a good night's out as a couple! Served by Cheri and Huiling who were always helping us with our requests to make our nights out as enjoyable as it could be! Absolutely enjoyed the ambience! Must visit!
