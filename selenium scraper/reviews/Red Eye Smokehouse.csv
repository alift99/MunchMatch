"Great food, reasonably priced!","Went to Red Eye as a party of two for dinner. Got us the platter of 3 meats, mashed potato, baked beans and corn bread. The meat was tender and flavourful; the mashed potato creamy (the gravy was superb); the beans had a nice touch of acidity and not overly cooked till they were a mush while the corn bread added a nice touch of sweetness to the whole meal (best eaten hot). Ended the meal with the key lime pie which was not overly sour or sweet as key lime pie can get. Overall, the price was reasonable considering it's a smokehouse"
Friday evening dineer,i visited with my wife and 2 kids. overall pleasant experience but i feel that the meat are on the salty side the key lime pie is excellent
4 Star Brisket / 1 Star Ribs,"I've been looking for some rightsaid southern brisket to arrive in SG for years now. You say brisket and immediately the mind wanders to Franklin's or Rudy's or Saltlick or just any gas station down south. Arrived with great expectations, was very surprised when they didn't understand what I meant by inside cut on my brisket order, equally surprised when they couldn't understand I prefer glazed ribs, so that automatically lowered my expectations. When it arrived the brisket was decent, I gave it 4 stars since its probably the best you can get this side of the Atlantic. The ribs however were simple nuked, over charred for effect and for 400gm portion for one I had to trash 300gms for the poor cook. Bittersweet experience... might go again if I get desperate for brisket. Suggestion: leave the hot sauce in a bottle on the table like a real barbecue joint, the stewardess was super gracious and refilled my mini dip bowl 7 times."
Tiny serving,"For the amount they charge for lunch, the portion is tiny. Taste wise, it's acceptable. Nothing to rave about."
Value for money,The beef was very tender and soft. The taste was very flavourful. Definitely one of the best smoked beef I have eaten. Must try!
Oddle delivery order,"Tried the pulled pork and pork ribs on my first order - the Oddle delivery (that arrived on time), came with a mini bun and a small tub of each sauce to try. Really enjoyed it and glad it still tasted great through the travel time to get to me! They also kindly sent a WhatsApp reminder and instructions on how best to enjoy the meat. The delivery charge was 14, which I guess it slightly higher than the usual 10 I’m willing to part with but it definitely saved the hassle of travelling to the restaurant. Will try the beef ribs next time!"
"Excellent Food, Service and ambience.",The food was fantastic and the staff know what is good and recommend to us. Would come back again! Just a little hard to locate the place cause it’s at the corner. But still okay! Good good worth the find!
Ripped Off For A Beef Rib,Never buy the Beef Rib..its a rip off..its was so char(total burn) on the top and too hard ..worst part the rib bone it self its almost like 250 to 300g ..only edible a portion of the meat. 12 dollar for 100g total weight was around 530g..so do the maths what u paid..overall the food is nice and ate there before w group of friends..this time round was a big dissapointment .
Great Meat,Brought my foodie and meat lovers friends to Redeye and they like it! Brisket and ribs were great and I personally love the sweet potato poutine.
Average,"Feels quite average. Some of the previous reviews mentioned that the meat was perfect. However during our visit the meat was just average. In fact some of the meat was not warm. Love the toasted bun. The pulled chicken burger was not impressive at all. The bun was a bit dry. Table is small. So if you are going to order a platter and another dish to share, better to let the staff know."
Great service,First class service with wallet friendly prices!!! The pork belly is a must try! Will visit again with my family!
food is good!,"went during lunch and was disappointed to find out they did not have their usual beef brisket, only the chopped version. no short ribs either as these items are only available for lunch.
pork belly was superb. we were a party of 3, we order 2 platter of 3 meats each platter had pork belly and beef brisket."
Decent Dining Experience,"Managed to snag a reservation and this was my second visit having done one with the family before the renovation. So decided to visit with a friend. Realised that the menu has changed a little. The sharing platters have been taken away and it was difficult to understand the menu when we had to choose 2 or 3 meats etc. I noticed that other people had the same problem as they spent more time than necessary at the counter to ask questions and to order the food. For 2 pax, we paid $158 without drinks. The meats were definitely improved for the first visit, but I feel the price point is a LITTLE bit expensive and unfortunately more expensive than the sharing platters offered before which was in my opinion better."
The best Southern food - never disappoints!,"We have been to Red Eye Smokehouse various times and each time we come away very very satisfied. The short ribs, brisket and pork belly are the best and so are all the sides! We love Southern food and this place is one of our family favs!! Thank you for consistently being so good."
Food was not bad but wasn't happy,"It's located at a rather secluded place facing the Jalan Besar stadium. Ambience was really not bad and the food was not bad too for the price. The meat platter should be your choice if you're a first timer. The pork bell's fat melts in your mouth and the choices of meat goes really well together in a warm bun. The mash potatoes were awesome.

Right food wise and ambiance was great so why was it an unhappy outcome?

Clearly discrimination was very obvious by a Chinese short hair tall waitress. She serves the locals and ang mohs really differently. Sorry she didn't bother to serve the locals or perhaps hesitant. She asked another waitress to serve the locals instead. And the rather timid waitress had to ask me twice if I was a first timer. I said yes and she didn't even tell me the menu differences since they had made changes and that the meat platter's choices of meat were from the list above stated as ala carte as well. How did I know all these changes as a first timer? There were ang mohs seating next table and the chinese waitress earlier served them superbly well with the changes made on the menu and how many grams of meat would be sufficient for two.

So, if you were me, how offended are you with such service? Pls, management of the restaurant, learn from millions of examples outside especially in the branded stores. Don't judge your guests by how they dress OR IF THEY ARE LOCAL AND YOUNG. Treat your customers equally if you want sustainable revenues from returning customers. Very dissatisfied indeed unfortunately. NEVER WILL I RETURN unless you improve these services."
Very tasty!,The food we have for lunch was very good and with a few additional sides. The burnt end beans were awesome!
Beef short ribs,"Value for money beef short ribs, haven't find any restaurant in singapore serving beef ribs. Could be better if food are serves hot instead of just warm"
Red Eye Smokehouse,"Fantastic, awesome, a real gem of a place. The food was superb, the service was excellent, keep up the good work.."
Can Go Again Location,"TRAY FOR TWO
Angus Beef Brisket, Duroc Pork Ribs, Smoked Chicken, Choice of 2 Half Sides

Angus Beef Brisket - really not bad, juicy and tender (will certainly be back for this..!!...Good...)
Duroc Pork Ribs - meat can be easily pull off the bones, but the corner meat tends to be too hard, can be better
Smoked Chicken - a bit under cook, nothing special about it
Mashed Potatoes - filled to the rim of the container with sauce (something unique about this taste) mash tends to have some chunky bits of potatoes, nice texture
Sweet potatoes fries - not bad

Will be back to try some other items off the menu. ^^

Setup of the place was cosy and simple, great place for 2 or just 4. Order at the counter and wait for your food."
YUMMY!!!,"Food was really good! We ordered the platter for 4 for the both of us as we wanted to try a variety of their dishes. Consisted of brisket, sausages, pork belly, pulled pork and chicken. All the meat dishes were really nicely done. Chicken was tender, pork belly melt in mouth type! Also came with an appetiser, we ordered the beer battered chicken strips (so good). and included 3 sides too. We had the dirty rice, burnt end beans and mashed potatoes. We also had the key lime pie which was awesome, Tart yet sweet. Will head back to try both the ribs which we didn't get to as it was too much food. Staff were really friendly and welcoming :)"
BBQ joint that hits the spot!,"Competition is stiff in the realm of BBQ joints like these but it was value for money that won in the end.
Service was good albeit slow as it seems we were caught behind a large takeaway order.
Food was great but I do wish it came a little warmer! Aircon must be to blame for cooling it down too much. Burnt end beans could use more burnt ends."
It’s not what you get in the US but good for Singapore,I came here for the 4th of July. The draft beer is completely flat so don’t buy it. The meat is ok but lacks the flavour you’d expect from a smokehouse. If your an American don’t expect what you’d get back in the states but if you’re desperate I’d say go for it. Service is good but the lady at the cashier was so depressing and lazy it was hard to look at her. Not many people there so I’m not sure if you’d need a reservation.
"Great food, awesome service","Pork ribs with original barbecue sauce was great. loved the nachos and happy-hour 1-for-1 yuzu beer too. Crew was patient and informative with their service (Tq).

Would be better if full slab option (always better value) is available as I had to order 2 serves (half slab 350g-400g x 2)"
Super Tasty,We ordered the Meat Platter for four and the meat was so easy to cut and so very very tasty. The mashed potato was beautifully smooth.
Red Eye Smokehouse,"This was our third visit, the food was fantastic as always. Keep up the great work and we will be back for sure sometime soon."
A great US BBQ joint- right here in Singapore!,"I have been coming here for years since they opened. The food is still just as good if not better. I've been lucky in life to have some great BBQ both in NY, Asheville NC, Arizona and Texas. Now I can also add Red Eye Smoke House in Singapore to that list! This is the real deal! Top quality brisket - the trademark of any good BBQ. Get there early though because they can run out. Nice selections of beer and wine to go along with the food. Also great for take out"
Not a bad experience,"First off it's in an out of the way place and its very small, so don't just go on chance. The food is on the whole quite good, the chicken especially
The brisket was somewhat spoiled by being slathered in BBQ sauce and that hid the natural taste. On the side woudl have been better
The ribs were ok.
The sides not bad. the cornbread very dry.
Not a bad effort and service quite good"
"Food OK, Service not so much, better options for the money","Went with a family of 6, food selection was not very varied, but it is a smokehouse joint after all. No kids menu options and no Veg options aside from cole slaw and sweet potato fries. Placed our order and waited....and waited....and waited. Eventually our orders started to dribble out. Side of rice...5 minutes later, a cole slaw....5 minutes later some fries...then about 10 minutes later our main dishes. As you can imagine, at this point we were all feeling a bit let down with the service.

The food however was delicious. Very succulent and flavorful smoked meats with nice sized portions. The sides were good too, but came so early in the service they didn't seem to matter. How hard is it to at least time the serving so everybody gets their meal at the same time?

This place may be best for takeaway as long as you don;t have a child or vegetarian with you :)"
Good Short Ribs & Great Corn Bread. That's all,"we had a platter for 1 + short ribs. The pulled pork was dry and hard, similarly to the brisket. Not juicy at all. The short ribs were fall off the bone good, but its dry on the edges. Did not felt like it was freshly smoked on the day. Considering we cam on a tuesday (after their closed day on monday), would wish to try another day. Flavours were great though."
Oh no - what changed?,"Used to love this place. It was our gem, our hidden treasure. I can’t count the number of our visits, they are so numerous. But….something changed. Menu is not the same, chicken has crept in more and more, prices have gone up, the nice vibe has evaporated. We were told they couldn’t take reservations, but now we are told we can’t enter without it. It’s become formulaic while the quality of the bbq declined.
I wish I knew who owned it/managed it/cooked in it a year ago or so, we would follow them. Those people made it a fantastic place. When they left (whoever “they” is) the restaurant went down down down. We have made our last visit here and won’t be returning. All that made Red Eye Smokehouse great has vanished. So disappointing."
Awesome BBQ experience,"Little hard to find but was well worth it. The food was better than expected , would highly recommend this restaurant. Great value and looking forward to our next visit."
Good food,"Made a booking for 6 pax 2 weeks in advance on a Friday. We were seated at the end of the restaurant but we saw that there was an empty table of 6 and requested if we could shift there, but was declined as apparently the other group had requested that specific table?

Anyway just before we went to order our food at the counter, the same lady came to tell us that the beef short ribs was sold out, to our great disappointment.

When we then went to place our order, somehow the beef short ribs was still available. Really weird experience.

We ordered the poutine, which was not traditional but tasty. The platter for 5-6 was not bad. The chicken and beef brisket were really tender. The bread roll was the highlight. It was sweet and fluffy. The beef short ribs was too salty and dry at some parts. Pork belly was kinda tasteless. Corn bread was a disappointment - barely any corn taste.

Lastly, the keylime pie was heavenly even though the SAME lady forgot our order even after telling us that there was only 1 small piece left."
"Not great, but better than the American Club!","The BBQ is not as juicy as in TX, or even at the best BBQ joints anywhere in the US, but satisfying enough. Hard to believe, but it is actually better than the Grillhouse at the American Club! Interesting beers, including a very fresh lager called F. Hell. Service is friendly but a bit slow."
For meat and key lime pie lovers,"Located in a quaint neighbourhood, this is one of the few places in town to satisfy one’s craving for American barbecue. Using good quality meats and offering a good selection of sides, a reasonably priced sharing platter is perfect for the first visit but pre-order or risk missing out on items that tend to sell out. Their key lime pie is also one of the best in town."
Dry Brisket,"The brisket was super dry and it was very dissappointing. Luckily there was a sauce to cover it but nonetheless it was very very dry. We booked 3 weeks ago and expected a lot and encountered a poor quality meet.
I saw another review with juicier and fattier looking brisket. Maybe there is a problem with quality control if the tenderness of the meat is dependant on your luck.

Rib was okay.
Cornbread was nice.
1 for 1 beer was affordable and nice.

Not going back.
There are other places in Singapore with better brisket."
Great Food but Everything Else Isn’t,"The food, especially the beef ribs, were amazing. However the service was pretty bad - staff not very friendly, I ordered a ginger ale and it took so long I had to ask them again for it. No Christmas deco... and best of all the meats were served on a cheap metal tray with a PAPER which tore later on when we were eating... upgrade your serving trays please.

Luckily I have no complaints about the food otherwise I’d be so annoyed."
Quality Food @ Reasonable Price,Simple chic restaurant serving good smoke meats & nice beer. Parking around the vicinity also pretty easy.
Get your meat fix here,"A unique clean look, located around Jalan Besar area, giving it an industrial vibe. Lovely place but the serving time is very slow. Not sure if it’s because we were the first bunch of customers as they just opened. The food was good, definitely a place for meat lovers to frequent and there is happy hours drink too. Love the red wine sangria and the overall portion and price were reasonable. Popular place for the younger crowd."
Tummy happy,The (fussy eater) family loved the glorious food where everyone can agree that 1) they want to come back again 2) the food was yummy 3) we left with a smile from the good service.
Best BBQ in Singapore.,"Outstanding .. the restaurant is located in an area with great atmosphere. The food was great - in my opinion, the best BBQ restaurant in Singapore. Service was fast, fun and the lady that was running the night was engaged with everyone. The food was exceptional, great choice of Singapore brewed beers - what I did not like is going to the counter to order / pay - makes it challenging if you want a second drink or dessert."
Very good food,It was definitely great value with HH drinks. The food was so delicious. We will come back again soon.
short rib,"Our visit today is about redemption, We are hoping that the disappointment from our last visit was just bad day and it will be okay again on this visit. Sad to say things are really not the way it used to when it comes fo Brisket, Most of the food is here solo now except for the short rib which we quite liked. My friend with me liked the puled pork(I did not taste it this time). in short I will only visit this place fo the short rib and not fo r th brisket which we used to love. NO more fee bun too:("
Delicious!,Great find in an area we wouldn’t normally travel to for dinner. Definitely give it a try ... the meats are really flavourful and the sides are tasty. We went with the kids otherwise we would have as the 1 for 1 drinks in their happy hour. Pink lemonade was delicious though! Everyone agreed we would be back.
Great ambience,The food was decent but what makes me want to come back would be the great service and ambience of the place
"Pulled Pork - Excellent, Service - Meh","The Pulled Pork - Truly excellent
The Brisket - meh
Sweet potato fries - lovely but there were only 5 of them.
The service - uninterested

Would recommend to anyone craving American barbecue but not American service or American portion sizes, and who won’t mind paying a big premium!"
Amazing,"Really impressive, been there a few times. They have the best buffalo wings in Singapore and a pretty decent happy hour."
Tender melt-in-mouth BBQ,"The brisket, checken and ribs on the platter for 2 were all excellent. Would be perfect if they were served warmer. Exceeded my expectations! Will be back."
8.1/10 very good and great,8.1/10 very good and great prices ! Best buffalo wings in SG! The BBQ was awesome and it’s a fun trendy venue Would def recommendation and look forward to to my next trip
Amazing ribs,"Ordered for delivery during fb... ordered $80 of food to get free delivery... pork ribs, 1/2 a chicken, the beef Texas plate along with some side. All the food is amazing and the ribs are phenomenal"
Could have been better,Food was ok but service could have been better for sure. Establishment needs to understand that customers come for a total experience not just food.
Good unpretentious BBQ in SG,"We went for a late lunch on Sunday afternoon and it was the perfect Sunday chill. The food was good and the vibe unpretentious, but serving up some finger licking good food. There's as much about the sauce as it is about the meats in BBQ and Red Eye dished up ample and yummy share of both. A good place to go to get your BBQ fix."
Disappointing,"We showed up on time and were told that there were only 3 meat options available. Shortly we were told they sold out the beef brisket and were down to 2 options. As we were ordering, it was chaotic. The staff didn’t know what was available and we were left standing there for a good 5 minutes. As there was hardly any meats we left the restaurant. There was no apology nor remorse that they had disappointed a customer."
Melts-in-your-mouth,"I can't remember when I last had a beef where it just melts in my mouth. And the taste! The pulled pork, sausage and side dishes of red beans and burnt end vegetables compliment the mains.

Just something to note, you may want to do reservations before coming over as this place can be fully booked. But the staff are nice to recommend to order ahead while waiting and having your beer."
Good food service and attitude must be improved,"Went to Redeye smokehouse yesterday evening and one of the meats on their platter was not available. Was very inflexible, unwilling to substitute for any sides or different meats instead, and still for the same price. Asked if we could have more sides instead - no. A different drink - no. Customer service could really be better especially when they have sold out of an item. Would I come back? No."
Purveyor's of fine Smoked Meats,"visited the hidden gem in Jalan Besar, Singapore. A rustic minimalist restaurant with a full bar that serves up some very delicious slow cooked American style smoked meats. I had a mixed platter of USDA Brisket, Australian Beefshort rib, Iberico Duroc pork ribs, smoked chicken, sausages and sides of Mashed Potatoes with Stout Gravy & Bone Marrow Butter & coleslaw. The quality and taste was amazing. A must try of your a meat fan."
Unique experience,"Beautiful tender meats, attentive service, great flavours and big serves make it a good dining experience."
Succulent beef briskets and finger licking good buffalo wings,"The beef briskets melt in your mouth, I also like the beef short ribs as well as the roast chicken. The buffalo wings are delicious."
Over-hyped,"Whilst the concept is interesting and location may be quaint (tucked in a small lane off Lavender St), the food is very, very, very average. Meat Smith on telok ayer st is similar in concept but better serves those looking for a central location.

Don't order the chicken, or in choosing the platter which includes some, ask for the dark meat. We neglected to specify for the chicken leg and ended up with flavourless and dry white meat that went completely to waste. The premium brisket not included in the platter is tender but again this too lacked flavour.

No second visit for me."
Fantastic slow cooked brisket!,"This place is worth a visit, slow cooked tender brisket. And they also have a selection og Craft Beers."
Not cheap but value for money for quality food!!,"Ordered 2-3 pax platter ($65+) and sweet potato fries ala carte ($12+). The food is very yummy and value for money! But I hope they can be more generous with the serving size for sweet potato fries. Other than that, this place is highly recommended!"
Great Food,"Visited with 2 friends and had the platter for 2-3 people, was more than enough, and the food was great. Ribs were tender and fell off the bone. Price was extremely reasonable, would definitely visit again"
Best ribs,Pork ribs is so tender. Could just pull off the bone. Brisket is juicy and delicious. The sides are amazing as well. Will definitely go again.
One of the best American BBQ In Singapore,"Have always love watching American BBQ brisket & ribs on YouTube with all the aus jus oozing out.

I have tried meat smith & smokey’s.....I preferred Smokey’s bbq brisket than meat smith

Recently have been to Red Eye smokehouse and I like their brisket the most.....some of the meat slices can be on the lean side so good for those who don’t like fat.. i like a little fat on it as is more juicy and flavourful.

they also have nice bbq Smokey sausages & ribs

Overall good place to have ur bbq fix"
Amazing!,"The food here was fantastic, we got the bbq plate for 2. Was all so juicy and the flavor was delicious. A bit hard to find, we caught a bus and walked the rest of the way. Highly recommended restaurant!"
Awesome,"Making a trip down here will not be a mistake. The food was excellent especially their pork ribs (Had the nachos, mash, beef brisket and ribs, ohhh those ribs), best i've ever had. Staff were friendly, area was spacious. kudos to the team!"
Real good,"Nice place but not easy to find Been there with locals , there is no MRT station near by so you would have to take a taxi Relax place and real juicy meat and good flavour"
Perfect for carnivores,You don't get better cuts of meat at that price anywhere else. The delicious beef short-ribs will give you a bang for your buck.
A must for meat lovers,"Need to be honest, I was in only for a beer, since they serve some amazing craft ones, but I did see what they serve, the meat look fantastic and I was really sad I had a reservation some where else and couldn't try taste it; the place look clean and tidy, very minimalist design, the staff is young, friendly and professional;
I will not miss to seat for a proper dinner next time I'm in SGP"
Great meats! But a hit and miss with some.,Meats were great but the pork was a tad dry. Loved the bone marrow mash and pickled vege! Waiting time may be long for dinner so go early to get seats!
For meat lovers,"Loved the place . It was a quite Saturday afternoon out with family . We ordered 2-3 px meal . Ordered side dishes - Sweet potato fries and Broccoli which comes with the meal . I enjoyed the fries even though I am not a great fan of junk food . Loved the key lime pie but not the corn bread , the texture was crumbly .. I wish they had burgers too . Would love to go back again ."
Pork ribs beyond compare. Sweet potato chips to die for.,"I was there last week. The place itself is nondescript. Looks like any other shop in the area from then outside.

We had the pork ribs, pulled pork, sweet potato chips (lots of it!) and the potato mash. It was simply excellent and we ate till we could eat no more. Nice craft beers too. We simply loved the experience and the food.

Will be back. With friends! Thank you, team Red Eye Smokehouse."
Happy hour after work!,"It’s my second visit.
I have to say this is a great place to chill after work. Great meat (lots of meat) and nice craft beer (1 for 1 during happy hour). Sweet pototo fries is our favourite. Get full cup, instead of half, just 3 dollars different :)
Relaxing ambiance! Definitely a great place to end weekday and welcome weekends :)"
Decent beer and tasty smoked meat,Came back here for another visit recently. This time I tried the beer on tap (which is 1:1 during happy hour) and a selection of smoked meat. Efficient and friendly service. I like this place and I’d be happy to visit again.
Great tasty smoked meats!,"I found the quality of meats here took be very good. You can taste that it is good quality meats prepared with a good heart. After having lots of meats, we came away still feeling good as you know when the food you ate was of good quality and well prepared. Our favorite were the St Louis pork ribs and the Angus Brant briskets. We liked it so much that we had another round."
Good food but slow service and overcharged,"Very slow service, waited over an hour for a call which did not come, food is decent but but was overcharged as they serve you much more than you order without telling you upfront. Leaves a bad after taste in my mouth."
Excellent food,Have been there with friends. Not to hard to find but the place is a bit small so do arrive early to avoid crowd. They have a bunch of selection of meats. We have tried several and there were tasty and nice! We will come back again next time.
"Great space and food, but with some inconsistencies.","I remember eating short rib from this smokehouse over a year ago. My friend brought it to a potluck. It was mindblowing, and I don't remember anything else I ate that evening. I finally made it to the restaurant last Friday, to celebrate a friend's birthday. The staff was visibly stretched and busy, but still kindly accommodated to my request to swap tables and store a cake for my friend. The corn bread and mash was absolutely amazing that we ordered seconds. The quality of the meat was somewhat inconsistent that night. We were disappointed with their signature US brandt beef brisket, something we ordered to add on to our platter after hearing so much about it. It was unfortunately, very dry. The sausage tasted raw and undercooked, but we were reassured by the staff that it was cooked through, just that there's lots of fat in it. The huli huli chicken and short rib were favourites, while the vote for the rest of the items on the platter was mixed amongst the 4 of us.

I have heard and read a lot of good things about this restaurant. I am confident that it is good. Just that perhaps, we were there on an off night? Despite the hits and misses, we still had a really good evening, and enjoyed ourselves. We'll pick and choose our own meat rather than have the platter the next time we come by."
Incredible Real American BBQ - Just like my home town hole-in-the-wall taste,"I knew something was good the moment I stepped out of the uber. The smell was exactly the same as ""Couch's"" BBQ in Cleveland TN USA. Which is a side-of-the-road classic american bbq place that I've eaten at for 30 years. We had decided based on the TV5 review to give the place a try. We had 4 voluteer's, 3 true meat eaters and one mostly rabbit. :) We order the platter plus one, with lots of sides. The beans, sweat potatoes, slaw, brocolli, and all the meats. Actually we had complaints we were oooh and ahing so much from how good the meat was. The ribs were better than Hard Rock Cafe we had during Christmas, (Even better than what I remember Tony Roma's being like), the pulled pork was also just like home. I found out later they provide slider buns if you want to go traditional. I loved everything except the sausage. Its a hard act to follow for the sausage because all the rest is really world class. The beans which are called burnt end beans have such a wonderful seasoning that you cannot stop eating it. The slaw likewise was worthy of a arm-wrestle, but the part that we had the most competition for was the pickles. Home made chucky dill pickles. Really good. We also tried the cream soda, have to say it was good, it was the only thing I think the price was a bit high on, the rest of the meal was good value for money, and I will be going back really soon (Maybe this weekend even)."
For meat lovers,Meat meat meat and more meat. But sadly not all meat are equal. Recommend the beef ribs and the beef brisket. The mash was incredible as well. Good range of beer to go along. Only issue - pricey.
Meatilicious dinner,"The Red Eye BBQ Plate for 2-3 people was just nice for our family of four. The Macho Nachos was worth the try. The downside is that some items are spicy so my younger one was not able to eat much. The Bone Marrow Butter Mashed Potatoes, pulled pork and the sweet potato fries were my girl’s favourite. Beside the bottle of plain water served, there are no suitable drinks for the children."
Well played,"My visit to this restaurant was nearly marred by a service error..after waiting over half an hour for our food we found out from the waiter that our order was not recorded properly and sent to the kitchen (they had a rather primitive way of taking orders with 1 waiter holding a notebook being overwhelmed by a dozen customers during a Saturday evening peak hour). The management's response was praiseworthy however, as they did not try to shirk responsibility, acknowledged their mistake and offered us a few measures to make up for it.

Other than this, the food was pretty decent, with the pork belly and beef plate worth a shoutout.

Would come here again"
The best BBQ in Singapore,"This is the best BBQ and one of the best restaurants in Singapore. It is right next to the Jalan Besar Stadium, on a quiet side street. The post modern industrial deco is in sharp contrast with the traditional and comfortable BBQ food served here. The menu is written on the wall that caters to individuals and family sizes. The root beer ($7) from west coast microbrewery is outstanding. We ordered a platter for 2-3 ($65) that comes with two sides. The BBQ pork, roast pork, roast beef, buffalo chicken wing and sausages were amazingly tender and tasteful. The only desert available is key lime pie and it is heavenly. Everything in this smokehouse is just to die for. And to top it off, there is no 7% GST and 10% tipping charge as service is kept minimal. It has been around for only two years but I have a feeling that it is hear to stay for a long time to come."
Smokey goodness,"A hipster bbq restaurant. Ordered the platter for 2-3 pax at $65 nett. Great value of money for the amount of food. Place was busy with only a few spare tables behind.
Pulled pork was good, sausages & pork belly were average, beef brisket was too fatty, chicken wings were delish. Sides of coleslaw and beans were good. Service was friendly. Has to doggie-bag some of the food as we could not finish. Reasonable price was the best part of the meal."
Proteins Overdose,A hipster joint that serves succulent meats that are smoke low and slow for up to 12 hours. Great place for those who need to load up your proteins.
Tasty food,Popped in here for a light dinner recently with a friend. The pulled pork was really good but the beef brisket was a little fatty for my liking. Unfortunately we just missed the happy hour where you get 2 pints of beer for just $14++ which is excellent value. Will have to come back to take advantage of that for sure.
Amazing American BBQ spot in Singapore,"I took a big whiff when I entered the restaurant and I knew this was a real BBQ joint, the smell of smoked meats brought me right back to the states. The menu is on the board and the gorgeous BBQ meats are at the counter, ready to be served. The Brandt Brisket was super tender, the Short Rib was nicely marbled and fork tender. We also loved the Huli Huli Chicken. Definitely a place for meatheads."
Carnivore's Haven,"If you love meat, good meat, meat prepared very very well, good quality meat, lotsa meat, this is the place for you.

Non biased, no reservation entitled unless you are a party of 6 and more, menu's on the wall, no long waiting time, no frills.

And you would think that their mains are all meat and they don't give two hoots about their sides. Wait till you try their mashed potatoes and coleslaw, all fresh, delicious, and crunchy veg just couldn't get you stopping. We only have all praises for their food.

Could get a little claustrophobic when it's a full house, but otherwise a very very nice place to be."
Great Pulled Pork,We went there following a recommendation and didn't get disappointed. We got excellent food in an interesting location.
The brisket is to die for!,"Just had dinner there and while the price is not cheap, the quality of the food was really good.

I had the pork ribs, beef brisket and shirt ribs along with marrow mash potatoes, coleslaw and broccoli salad.

The beef brisket was out of the world. It was soft, tender and so succulent. I was tempted to buy 1 kg worth of it because it was that good.

The beef short ribs and all the sides were excellent but it was just overshadowed by the brisket.

The ribs were all right but that could be due to the excellent quality of the other meats. The owner must love American bbq because it's back breaking work and I will be back here again, this time with some Americans in tow who miss their bbq!"
"Potential to be alot better, but not awful","Staff were friendly and the menu was classic to a traditional Texas Smokehouse, and all the key meats and sides were covered in this newly furbished outfit. Decor and buzzing ambiance aside, it was the little things, that to a BBQ enthusiast like myself, that really stand out and clearly get noticed in the end product. They're using a pellet smoker, and this was noticeable in the taste; the meat didn't have a great bark or that intense Smokey flavour you get from a pure wood log smoker; I can however get past this! That said, I as dumbfounded and found it absolutely criminal that they go to the effort of smoking big meats for over 8-10hrs until it's reached that juicy perfection, only to then put the product open and unwrapped in a glass, lamp heated service-pass to keep it warm... SOOOO disappointing, I felt bad for the restaurant, it was their only flaw. It resulted in a dry, chewy meat that was tough (Pork Belly and Ribs specifically); easily resolved with an investment into some standard Cambro Hot Boxes!! For those that don't know any better, you should definitely trythis joint, and I recommend the Brisket!!"
Nice Southern BBQ,The place is hidden away on a side street and you must be looking for it to find it. Basic setup with ordering at the counter and the meats are weighed and charged per 100gr. It was tasty and a good place to get our southern bbq fix. I would recommend to put a little more decor and a little better service (eg. ordered ice tea and we had to ask for it after our food arrived). The brisket was very nice and well prepared.
Excellent choice for crispy smokey Flavours,"Went there twice so far. The first time was much more memorable as I didn't have smoked meat for a terribly Long time. The meats were cooked well and I loved the broccoli and coleslaw side.

I tried as many as I could and ordered the pork ribs, beef short ribs, pulled pork, beef brisket and sausages. THe beef short ribs were brilliant and on the TOP of my list, the pork ribs were hard probably because it got cold, the pulled pork was forgettable as it was slightly too hard for my liking, but the sausages were tasty and filling. The brisket was soft and chewy the first time round but the second time it wasn't as good.

Overall I'm still giving this a five as there isn't other place that offers anything close that I've tried.

Service was great too !!

Price ? It ranges from $40-60 per person depending on how much you can eat."
Best American BBQ Style in SG!!,Loved it! Very kind staff and best American BBQ we had in Asia. Highly recomended! The Macho Nacho is heaven too!
LOVE at first BITE,"A paradise for meat lovers.. it was indeed love at first bite. Saw this place in Burple and wanted to check it out. The place has a nice industrial feel and the best thing is it was not crowded at all. The staff were real attentive they made great recommendations. We had the platter for 2-3 people and it was huge. There were 4 of us and we find the portion to be just right. We also tried their Nachos and it was heaven in my tongue. It had the right crisp, creaminess and kick that we went gaga for. The meats, though grilled, was tender and oh-so-juicy; its a must-try. They also offer happy hour with 1 for 1 draft beer. They too have a wide selection of beverage, some I have never encountered. The place wasn't hard to find too. It was a mere 2 blocks away from Lavender stn and just near Jln Besar Stadium. I would highly recommend this place. Its perfect for dates, friend's hang outs or simple cheat days... its such a gastronomic feast! Kudos!"
Best BBQ in Singapore!,"This place is AMAZING. The best BBQ food I have had in the two years I have been in Singapore and for a really reasonable price. For $90 we got a plethora of meats (they do different pre-made plates), sweet potato poutine, 4 different sides and key lime pie. All of which were utterly delicious. They make their own sauces and rubs and everything we had was perfectly cooked! Highly recommend the brisket, ribs and wings as well as the MAC and cheese.
Will be back here for sure! Service was also brilliant throughout!"
Lunch at Red Eye Smokehouse,"The beef brisket and the beef rib were awesome. Pork belly was a little dry.

For sides, we had the mac N cheese and honey corn bread. The mac and cheese is good. The kids liked it.

The favorite round the table was the beef brisket but my personal fav was the beef rib. The beef rib was super moist and flavoursome.

Choice of 2 BBQ sauces - smiley chipotle and sweet and tangy.

Key lime pie was also good."
Proper!,"Imported hickory wood, the right amount of smoke, and fall off the bone meat. Nice environment and friendly staff. Check it out!"
Dinner,"Yum yum yum The beef and pork belly was so tasty and also the condiments, washed down with a nice beer in a relaxed warehouse style decor."
OMG! To-Die-for menu!,"The servings are generous and for such high quality meat, it's worth every dollar!
To say the meat is melt-in-your-mouth is such an understatement.
The side dishes like Maple corn bread with honey butter is exquisite!
I love every bite and everything on the menu.

The restaurant is loud and busy as expected for Saturday night but the service is awesome and friendly.
Best come early (and with reservation) before some menus got sold out."
Fantastic Barbecue in this hidden gem,Recently I had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant three times. All three were brilliant. I had great food in a relaxed atmosphere. The platters were wonderful.
