Private Dining experience at Grissini,"Had a truly spectacular evening with incredible ambiance in the private dining room. The team customized the setmenu to each persons requirements (veg and vegan) and the presentation of the food was remarkable. With outstanding service, Grissini is a must and I will certainly be back on my next trip!"
Perfect experience,10/10 experience. Very nice food and lots of surprises. Friendly staff and good location. Entertaining
Excellent even for walk-in date night,"Grissini restaurant was spectacular and just as good since our last visit before COVID-19. We had the 5-course omakase and thereafter Executive chef Kenny Huang shared his culinary experience from his years in Italy, which he expressed in the flavour and flair. The attention to details by the service crew was impeccable."
Excel all expectations.,Great meal. Outstanding sevice and presentation. Much better than my expectations! Full of good suprises until the end. Well done!
Good service goes a long way,The food was exquisite and the flavours covered a spectacular range. We were swept away by the lovely service too. The ambience was perfect for an intimate dinner with your loved ones. A must visit.
Wonderful food and attentive service,"This was my first experience at Grissini, and a first for omakase which proved to be a truly great experience.

My fiance and I could taste the attention to balance and details, and the service staff were truly attentive to provide the most wonderful dinner to end our day."
Great Birthday Dinner,"We had an awesome dinner last night. Service was impeccable by Selina and the young man (sorry, we didn't get your name), who looked after us so well, through the evening. Food was delicious, it was cooked with a lot of love. Chef was creative with each dish, adding little twists to surprise our taste buds while retaining the essence of each ingredient. Chef and his team was so kind to provide a cake to celebrate our 3 belated birthdays. We round up our dinner with a beautiful Krug champagne and a 100 pointer 1986 Lafitte Rothschild...Life is good, as we slowly edge away from Covid. Chef and team, thank you so much for a very memorable evening. We will be back...see ya."

Very cosy and personalised dinner,"Well balanced and yet good mixture of interesting flavours for every course all the way from the appetiser to dessert. Very professional service rendered. The staff were all very friendly, and took time to describe every course to us. Great job to the Chef and his team!"
Love the experience,Delicate food and beautiful presentation. Great service and quiet environment with great view. Very enjoyable dinner with my best friend!

SG Restaurant Week,Enjoyed every course. The food was delicious and presented beautifully. Service was impeccable and warm! We will be back!!
A gastronomic experience!,Excellent food and service! Patrick was especially attentive and very knowledgeable in the dishes that were served.
Good food and service,"Dinner treat by my wife for my birthday. Our server Patrick was friendly and attentive. Thoroughly enjoyed our meal (7 course). Of all - we loved the risotto the most. Thought that the wagyu might be better with medium-rare rather than medium - will try again if we visit next time.

Very interesting combination of Italian and Japanese elements in the cooking. Will be visiting again."
Perfect anniversary lunch ❤,"Celebrated our wedding anniversary here, was pleasantly surprised by a beautiful desert to marl the occasion.

Had the omakase lunch and every dish was perfectly executed.

Selina's service was top notch! Thank you and we will be back!"
Great food and service,Visited the restaurant for our wedding anniversary and tried the omakase lunch menu. It was a fusion of Italian and Asian dishes. Loved the wagyu beef mains which is one of the most tender beef steak I have ever tasted. Both the waiters Steven and Selina were attentive and provided excellent service. Can’t wait to go back again to entry their other menu.
Grissini x Nespresso,A delectable and interesting blend of Italian and Japanese dishes by Chef Kenny and team - the main dish was a star! Also great to have Patrick with us - he was knowledgeable and engaging throughout. Grissini really does live up to it's ratings
Excellent foods and environment,Visited this restaurant on 23 Oct 21 for my wife birthday. The overall environment and foods are beyond expectation. Staffs are friendly and service is good. Strongly recommend this great restaurant to others
Restaurant week,All the foods were very beautiful and delicious. Especially Hamachi carpaccio and tiramis were giving kind of new surprise. Portion of each dishs were just nice even though there were many dishes in a course. And all the staffs were professional enough to answer any kinds of question. We really enjoyed our lunch here.
Grissini Italian Restaurant in Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel,"Great ambiance for lunch in Grissini restaurant. Thanks for hospitality service from Selina, Patrick and the teams. My sister and I enjoy the birthday celebration here with creativity and delicious foods present by Chef Kenny Huang with the teams. Will come back to explore new dishes here again."
Birthday dinner,Had a wonderful birthday dinner! The food was amazing and the service was so good too! I definitely will be back to try other creative dishes by Chef Kenny!!
"Immaculately thought out, impressive work of art and taste.","Omakase menu - 5 course
Chef kenny did a great job with the menu. I especially enjoyed the fish paired with ponzu sauce (it looks whimsical, top quality wild fish). The sauce wasn't overpoweringly salty & paired well with the flowers, absolutely a work of art & balance.

The yuzu sorbet - always a favourite with ladies. The sourness was balanced well with the jelly bits, and you could also taste the sweetness & fineness of the grapes.

The valronha chocolate tart looks ordinary, but tasted was a sensation to remember with a crackling aftertaste. A memorable night with Grissini."
Dinner @ Grissini,Superb food @Grissini during SG restaurant week! Great service staff who are attentive to details as well!
Fine dining.,Awesome dining experience. Food details and taste are amazing from Chef Kenny. Passionate service from Mr Patrick. Thank you guys.
Lunch at Grissini,Great food that we had at Grissini for SG Restuarant week. Love the incorporation of nespresso into some of the courses. Special mention to Selina and Ivy for the amazing service and knowledge of the food
Restaurant week,"Really enjoyed the Restaurant week menu. Very attentive staff, great service and food. Recommended:)"
Overall a wonderful gastronomic experience coupled with exceptional service,"We had the restaurant week set menu which was extremely worth it and delicious. Chef Kenny impressed with a carefully curated variety of textures and tastes in each and every dish. The service staff were friendly and attentive, and explained each dish well. Thank you Chef, Selina and crew for a memorable night."
Impeccable service and delicious food,"Had a really good experience with Grissini during their restaurant week. The food was great, romantic casual ambience and service was also top notch. Highly recommend a try!"
One of the best restaurant week experience!,"Had no expectations when I came here but boy was I blown away! The service to begin with was excellent. Special shout-out to Selina and Patrick who were very thoughtful and carefully explained every single dish to us.

The cuisine is Italian with a Japanese twist and I was made to understand they had only recently embarked on the Omakase concept in September, switching it up from their old ala carte menu.

Chef Kenny is the man behind the dishes which were well curated as a whole - the Hamachi Carpaccio came out top for me (the picture I posted don’t do it justice!) It was beautifully plated, well seasoned with good balance and had a melt in your mouth texture.

The restaurant week was a special tie up with Nespresso so Nespresso coffee was also carefully and tastefully infused into various dishes, with foie gras in the risotto dish, wagyu in the jus and tiramisu for dessert. I appreciated that the dishes had depth in the flavour but didn’t feel “too much” in any way.

I went for the okara as my main dish (see photo). It was very fresh, well cooked and complemented the choice of cauliflower purée and maitake mushrooms.

Overall the dinner experience was very enjoyable. Chef Kenny explained that the menu switches up regularly depending on what’s fresh in the market. Will definitely be coming back to try more clever creations!

Also special mention about the bread basket. I can’t remember the name but there was one bun in particular that was really good (bread basket came with a sourdough, grissini and a third, the third one was my favourite and best eaten warm!)"
Excellent food and service,"Flavours of the food were well-balanced and interesting. Food presentation was also very good. All in all, we were impressed with the food and enjoyed this omakase take (and Japanese twist) on Italian cuisine."
SG Restaurant Week,What a wonderful well-balanced meal. Love the flavours and subtle additions of Asian cuisine into the typical Italian dishes. I’ll be back :) excellent service too!
Omakase dinner @ Grissini,"Lovely dinner, great service. Chef’s Kenny’s innovative touch brought home many fond memories. Loved the Hiramasa Carpaccio and Tochigi Wagu. Thanks Selina and Patrick for the attentive and warm service."
Beautiful Meal,"Food was excellent. We went with the SG restaurant week menu. Very impressed! Great balance and great quality. Last but not least,
Patrick, Selina and Ivy provided great service thought out the meal which made the dining experience really enjoyable."
Omakase Italian Mama Mia,We went for dinner without knowing it’s SG Restaurant Week. The promotion for the dinner set at $128 was a good deal! Really value for money. My hubby took the $158 set and it’s was excellent. The chef Kenny Huang even came out to meet us!
Delicious Italian cuisine!,"The food was terrific and service (Selina, our waitress) was attentive and friendly. Pacing of food was great. Special mention to the coffee infused dishes i.e. wagyu filetto, foie gras risotto, and tiramisu"
Great food and even better service,"The foie gras risotto was amazing and other dish were generally nice too
Service was even better
Selena was super attentive and the way she explains the food is very professional (makes the food sound yummier"
Enjoyed the Restaurant Week menu,"Well-paced, interesting menu and flavours. P Amazing service from Selina who took time to explain each dish with us. Thank you to all the servers as well!"
Sg restaurant week 2021,"Attentive staff with great service; Selina gave us a good experience by explaining each dish and checking in regularly. Interesting menu, good quality food. All items were refreshing and used fresh ingredients. Absolutely for dill lovers. 4/5 recommend, because it’s a bit on the pricey side."
Grissini Omikase Lunch - Awesome!,"Me and my wife was at Grissini (Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel) for the Omikase Lunch. The food is exquisite and well prepared. And the service was top notch (thank you Patrick).
We will come back again, very soon.

PS: The view is beautiful, too."
Set lunch 88++,"Set lunch is affordable, filling and pretty good. Will come again for sure.

Highlights are the squid ink cracker,
Lobster with homemade pasta and the best one is the beef.
It’s able to get the Smokey flavors from herbs and spices which bring the flavors to a different level."
Grissini Set Lunch,"Lunch here was excellent. A lot of care and attention was put into the preparing and plating of the dishes. From the amuse bouche to the appetiser, to the main course, dessert and petit cinq (cos it was 5 items, not four) This was topped by the warm, friendly and professional wait staff Patrick and Selina who shared with us in great detail what was being served. The star of the show for me was the chocolate tart. It was the best I have ever had.

A thoroughly enjoyable experience. I hear they change their menu all the time so I look forward to all the yummy stuff Chef has planned."
An eye opening dining experience that fully win me over.,"Came here for our annivery celebration.. From the start to the end of the whole omakse course, it filled with burst of surprises in a good way succeedingly with each course served. The restaurant staff service is hospitable and the staff earnestly introduced each dishes with much vigour. The dishes curated by Chef Kenny are impeccable and the quality fresh ingredients used for each courses complemented well. The texture, flavour, and aroma are all on point. At the end of the dinner, Chef Kenny is friendly and he came out to ask for our feedbacks and imparted some of his culinary knowledge from how to choose the best ingredients and all. My partner and I have an out of world dining experience. We will be back again for more!!"
Delicious Chicken and Wonderful Service!,"“Il Pollo” was truly the dark horse of our meal, with shatteringly crispy skin and succulent meat. Our server Patrick was also especially attentive, carefully explaining the intricacies of our dinner."
A trip to Italy without actually boarding a plane~,"Do try the mushroom soup! Really rich and goes well with their freshly baked bread. The mains are very good as well! Steak was slightly charred (perfectly done in my opinion) and juicy! Both the rib eye and the tenderloin Sea bass was also very tasty.

For dessert, do try their pistachio gelato and the fragole all’aceto balsamico!!!

(Picture is of the Rib Eye!)"
Excellent Service With Good Food,"Had quite a nice lunch there today, with excellent service by Patrick and his female team member (sorry but did not get her name). They were both friendly yet professional in their dealings with customers, stopping by often to top up water or to check on the meal.

Foodwise, there were more hits than misses. The wife and I loved the burrata, which was light and fresh tasting, with its mini tomatoes, proscuitto and honey melon balls. The amuse bouche was also delightful.

I loved the vongole, which was robust but not heavy in taste. The pasta was al dente and the clams super fresh. The wife had the risotto with foie gras ($10 supplement), and was delighted with the first few spoonfuls. However, she said she found it a little jelak or heavy going at the end of the dish. I tried a few spoonfuls and I liked it, though the crispy foie gras was a tad ununsual.

My dessert of pistachio ice cream was a generous portion, and it was not too sweet, which was great. The biscuit crumble also gave a nice touch of texture. The missus did not fully enjoy the tiramisu ($6 supplement) with the amaretto as she felt it was super creamy and heavy and needed a touch more texture.

The surroundings were a little dated, especially as we needed to come up from the carpark through the mall next door."
Great weekday lunch with a view,"Had a lunch “date” here with the teenage offspring and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The lunch set was very good value. We were served a small morsel of Parma ham and truffle cream as an amuse bouche accompanied with a generous bread basket that had 2 sticks of Grissini as a nod to the restaurant’s name. As a perfect first bite it certainly tickled our mouth for what was to come. Buratta with tricolor tomatoes looked and tasted of Italian summers. The star dish was Chef Kenny’s risotto with foie gras. Perfect al dente rice obviously cooked with the best stock and the unctuous balance of cheesy goodness stunned us into silence as we shoveled mouthfuls in. The meal was completed with a scoop of gelato served beautifully in a martini glass and a cup of good solid coffee. Service was friendly- the teenage offspring asked for something other than coffee or tea and was obliged with a glass of fresh sugar cane with lemon. It pleased him very much indeed. Mum, this is like fine dining, he cried! Did I mention the starched white table cloths, heavy fancy cutlery and river view? During this challenging time, it brought us an afternoon of happiness."
Sunday Lunch Elegance,"Been years since we've been back to this iconic Italian venue.

Surprisingly, it was very good. All antipastas were very good. Mains were good, except 2. Dessert were fine.

Table service was excellent!"
Birthday Dinner,"Had a wonderful time at Grissini, customer service was superb and food was great - was served by Patrick"
What a Happy Birthday🦐🍾,"Chef Kenny is the best.
Marvellous dishes, perfectly curated wine pairing - and exceptional service.
We were very well taken care of!
Our daughter was even offered a vacuum sealed scarf, as she forgot her cardigan at home.
Thank you so much for making my husband's birthday very special. ♥️"
Best meal of the month,"Excellent food, presentation, wine pairing and service. Guests and myself enjoyed ourselves totally. Good value for money!"
Best Risotto!!,"Tiptop service by Patrick & Uzair, mouthwatering foods, risotto won my heart. Best i had. Thanks to Chef Kenny! Perfect night w my girls! Everyone is very welcoming and accommodating. Thank you Grissini Team!"
😊,"Just dropping to hype our awesome visit we had at Grissini. Thank you for the pleasing experience, me and my friends had a great time. I would definitely come back. Keep up the good work guys.. ❤️❤️❤️"
Great Food with Great Service,"Hands down to Grissini’s varieties of food specially Chef Kenny’s famous Risotto. everything is perfect and the service is impeccable. To Selina‘s Great service making sure that everything is perfect, to Patrick‘s sense of urgency, he can read our mind and bring whatever we needed in the table. And to Uzair’s sense of entertainment in the table. Will surely come back for more."
"It was a great experience,","It was a great experience, Patrick serves as so well and we feel so speacial. We do love the food and the ambiance. Thank you! Well done! Highly recommended."
They had changed the menu.,"They had changed the menu. Unfortunately, the pizzas were gone but the food was great. Same great service and the pasta actually taste better than before. The best dish was the pork cheek. Tiramisu one of the best I’ve ever tasted."
Not warm,"We were looking forward to visit Grissini as we run very often passing by and supposed to be nice place for dinner. In the entrance we were refused to enter as my boyfriend had shorts not trousers, even if it was elegant and not beach shorts. There are rules, I understand, but rules should have rational sense that from our point of view was not, especially considering that we are in Singapore, where is hot also in the evening. In this evening it was almost empty, people were dressed super simply.. and by the end due to very rigid mind and regulations you have lost at least 2 clients. Is a pity, we went away disappointed and without dinner."
Terrible service,"Wouldn't know how the food tastes, restaurant couldn't be bothered to seat us, leaving us at the bar for 20 mins in a near empty restaurant."
Chef Kenny Huang will transform Grissini into an exquisite dining haven.,"We have been a regular at Grissini since it took over the realm from Pontini restaurant. On 24th March, we were treated to an extraordinary dining experience since Chef Kenny's recent arrival at Grissini. If what we had at lunch was anything to go by, we dare say we are in for some truly amazing, incredible & memorable dining every time we are here. The experience is complete with outstanding service standard delivered by both Selina & Pat (thank you both) as we look forward to our return visit real soon."
Ms anna,"Good food, good service , lamb rack , good recommendation for wine by Hermana , he was helpful. The evening was pleasant with the wonderful ambience"
"Excellent environment, friendly service, great menu choices","Having been to Grissini several times, I must say I am very impressed with the quality of food and service. I highly recommended their new menu.

I am in love with every dish on their dinner set menu! It is not everytime we enjoy each course served, but Grissini wow-ed my tastebuds.

Also, every dish was well introduced by one of their managers, Uzair.

My top favourites are the Risotto con foie gras, Filetto Di Manzo and Fragole all aceto balsamico.

Their Risotto had a rich and creamy flavor, while the foie gras with gold leaves melted in my mouth so subtlety.

The wagyu beef was more towards the lean side. It was juicy, tender, and loaded with flavor. The texture was of a perfectly-cooked steak.

That was my first time trying the Fragole all aceto balsamico. Warm strawberries with aged balsamic sauce, and a scoop of lavender gelato - just perfection.

I will definitely return for their quality food with great value. Thank you Uzair, Jeefren and Haziq for the great service."
"Delectable food, Attentive Service!","Came here dinner, and it was not crowded in the least. Perfect for having audible conversations. We ordered the Risotto with Foie Gras that our waiter, Hermawan recommended, a Burrata for starters and the Prosciutto pizza.

The Burrata was creamy and cold, accompanied by olives and cherry tomatoes, and the pizza was unusual due to its chewy texture, but the Risotto was out of this world - the perfect combination of homely yet decadent. Paired with the Foie Gras and gold leaf, it was an edible work of art. Uzair, the waiter who brought it to us, shared the history of risotto which certainly made more of an impression in our minds.

All in all, for the price that you're paying, the service and food is worth every penny. Will definitely come back after their menu changes!"
Birthday Celebration,"This is my third time here and I will still recommend it to my friends. Aside from the great ambiance, all staff here are so friendly and accomodating. It feels like home to be here.

Special thanks to Patrick. He is not just nice but I can see his passion to his work. The way he talk and connect adds good vibes to his guests."
Highly Recommended,"Excellent Service. Nice Ambiance. Cool Staff. Delightful Foods.

Kudos to Chef Joseph, Service Crew Patrick, Hermawan and Hazig"
best night out,"we enjoyed the food as much as we enjoy the river view, and the service was great. thanks to Patrick, Hermawan and Haziq for attending all our needs. chef Joseph came to us and making sure we are enjoying the food which we all did. the food was beyond our expectation..best so far we've tried here in singapore. posted in ig and recommended to all my friends to try here as well. the music is very relaxing and it gives back all my memories when i was in europe. thank you for giving us all a wonderful night. we will surely come back and try other food on the menu. :) cheers!"
Worst Service!,"Was very hesitant if I should write a review... have patronise since Pontini times but last 2 occassion at Grissini is really disappointing.

Service is totally double standard. Well I agree that ""regular"" guest has the special treatment.. but we are also paying guest!

It was great initially when we entered the hotel, greeted by staff at the entrance...etc but it became a disappoinment when we were seated.. first we were given menu.. but we waited like close to 15minutes cause there is only 1 staff around and she was busy.. afterwhich, another table of 4 came and i suppose its a grouo of regular guest hence, the attention was all on them. Why would i say that?? Cause the manager (malay gentlemen) immediately stood up from his seat and attended to them.

While i was reaching out, the manager told me to wait and he will comes back.. hey.. i was already waiting for 15minutes..

Food was great but service has failed..

May consider not coming back anymore.."
"Overpriced, overwhelmed by customers , under delivering on food and service","Just had Valentine dinner here
Nice location but got off to a bad start by being told that we must spend $80 per head on food
We normally spend around that and then more on wine and cocktails, so a bit disappointed on this greedy approach.
Ordered prosciutto plata and buratta, not a lot of meat but Buratta was nice
Main course steak was ok and my wife had salmon which was ok
Desert was a disaster, the flambe tartlette was bitter and they served one gelato and a lemon sorbet which was supposed to be a gelato.
Many people were waving their arms to get attention.
They just haven’t got anything apart from a nice location by the river
Wouldn’t go back
Spent $ 450 for two and regret it."
"GREAT FOOD, FABULOUS SERVICE","Patrick served our table. He was very helpful, not at all intrusive and had a sense of humour. The food was excellent, especially the grills. We eat there often and we are surprised the restaurant is not more busy but it could be due to the pandemic."
Authentic delicious Italian cuisine,"Impressed by everything we ordered this evening: 1
1. Minestrone soup: rich
2. Homemade bread: soft,refreshingly nice
3. Pork bacon pizza: yummy cheese topping
4. Grilled octopus: just look at the picture - don’t you wanna sink your teeth into it right now???!
5. Gnocchi: a bit heavy but bursting with flavor
6. Tiramisu: what a lovely presentation! Tour de force.

Service was fairly attentive, lukewarm.

Good chance of returning."
Last Lunch for 2020,"We're ""discussing"" on where to have our last lunch for an eventful 2020 and seemed to be heading nowhere. Not until we were pointed here. I haven't heard of this Italian restaurant before so it got me curious. Reading from the reviews, it's worth trying. And glad we did. All went well and thanks to the awesome service from Patrick."
Services,"Called few times to the restaurant and nobody picked up the restaurant phone & handphone no and did not even returned call.
We were standing at counter waiting to be attended and nobody bother even though they could see you and no temperature was taken.
After we walked in to approach the staff, we were seated and they did not bother to ask you for beverages or give you their menu.
Food was good but the services was really not to simplest standards."
"cosy, quiet and rather well-riced menu though not expensive","Cozy place to enjoy the outdoor winds as well as the indoor chef/bartender in action (open kitchen/ bar). Indoor had more food selection than outdoors (Covid-times).
Housepour/wine selection was fairly good and prices for food & drinks in general was affordable for the quantity and quality.
Clean, quiet environment to wind-down an evening. Staff was friendly and accommodating too."
Birthday Celebration,"Well accommodating staff Patrick and Kay, and high quality service. Highly recommended their foods and ambiance of the place"
A well done,Affirming Pat and Kay in their service for us. Very accomodating and all our needs were well attended too.
Quiet and relaxing food trip at Grissini SG,"Had a wonderful, quiet yet relaxing al fresco dining at Grissini in Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel. A couple of nights ago was my first time to visit the restaurant and was glad to have been assisted by very accommodating and friendly staff, Patrick and Kay. I was offered by Patrick their pizza called “prosciutto di parma.” The slightly salty and bitter taste of the said pizza is highly recommended. I’d definitely be coming back to that place again."
A very enjoyable dinner to celebrate my sis and brother-in-law’s anniversary:),"I just want to say thank you to Selina and team for fantastic service even before our dinner. We were supposed to visit on a Sunday night but I had to postpone the dinner to a following Saturday as I had food poisoning. Not only did Selina continued to respond to my emails/calls politely, she even arranged for my family to sit in the private room so we could enjoy our celebration. Throughout dinner, service continued to be impeccable. And best still, the food was delicious. To top off the night, Selina and team prepared a cake by request for the celebration. Definitely thumbs up from my whole family of five. This first visit turned out so pleasant that we look forward to returning again:)"
Great experience!!,"Delicious food, great services. Reasonable pricing and great ambience. Went for the $1 for one hr free flow alcohol. Mge to have 3 glasses of wine. Great gd deal."
Well Spent Dinner Experience,"We chose Grissini for a fancy dinner date on a Tuesday night and I must say that the food, the place, and the service exceeded my expectations. Everything was great and I can’t get enough of their Irish Oysters and the Truffle fries! The ambience of the place especially the outdoors is just the right amount of what you need for a relaxing dinner. Special thanks to Selina and Kay for an outstanding service. I highly recommend this place."
Overall good but not great,"Food was good, olive bread amazing and chocolate mousse desert was really unique. Though the steak was slightly over cooked (ordered medium rare but got more of a medium) but still good. Pork certain parts abit tough but I guess that’s normal. Fish was very good, octopus was so so.

Song selection questionable... played lotsa pop songs for e.g. WAP lol...

Service was very good."
Great food and great service,"Irish Oysters was fresh and delicious, food was great from starters to dessert. And to top it all our server, Patrick's service was exceptional thank for the great dinning experience."

Family dinner,"First visit after covid. The presentation change with more finesse. We were served home made bread with different olive oil & balsamic vinegar. The 6 course & 8 course menu with wine pairing is also good option for special ocassion. Both are good with the 2 additional dish in 8 course the oyster and lobster pasta. Irish Oyster is so delicious added Japanese vinegar. Lobster pasta ia aldante. Funghi soup with truffle oil also yummy serve in piping hot temperature. Service also prompt, attentive n good product knowledge. Highly recommended!"
