Singapore Indian restaurant,Wonderful family business with great food and friendly vibe. Must visit if you love your Indian food! Based in little India
Good service,We went to the restaurant around 830PM and were greeted by Mr Sonu at the entrance. Big thanks to him for giving us a good table. We loved the food and the service from the restaurant as well. The mutton vindaloo is a highly recommended dish! We tried their carrot halwa as well.. tasted good

Tasty. Friendly. A must whilst in Little India.,"Despite being incredibly busy (on 1st night of Deepavali & we hadn’t made a reservation) the host & waiting staff were super friendly, helpful & accommodated us.
Our food was tasty & excellent quality.
Would highly recommend."
Great food. Great service. Friendly staff.,"I had the vegetarian platter, a mix of 3 starters which was excellent, hubby had lamb pepper masala which was also very good. Paratha was great and we were brought a snack to start which was delicious. Friendly and helpful staff. Would highly recommend."
What an absolute gem.,We found this gold mine on Race Course Road in little India. The food was to die for with a balance of spice and taste. I asked the chef for a chicken tikka jalfrezi and what was served surpassed my expectations. I am experienced in Indian food and this was by far one of the best dishes I have tried. 10 out of 10 . You must try the jalfrezi.
Best Butter Chicken,Tried a few dishes and it was amazing. If you’re in the area you must visit this place. You won’t regret it. The lady boss is super as well.
Birthday Lunch,Celebrated my 30th birthday here! All the staff was so accommodating and Tes was amazing. She made sure everything was fully organized and the meals arrived on time. We all had a great time! highly recommended.
Perfect birthday dinner,"The food was perfect and the service was excellent! Loved the appetisers, Kashmiri lamb rack, Chicken Lazeez Handi curry and the vegetarian and meat platters. The drinks were also good and reasonable. A fantastic meal with great service all at fantastic value… Anuj was really great with his recommendation of food and also alcohol to go with the food ❤️ Thank u for a lovely birthday feast!"
Highly recommended!,"The food was good, prices were affordable, ambience was nice and cosy and the staff were friendly and helpful! Loved it!"
No frills but great food,Basic restaurant with no frills look but delicious food. Loved the chicken tikka kebab and the burnt garlic raiter. After a long walk around Little India it was a great place to stop. Too sad no dining in presently.

The best Indian Food Stall in Singapore,"I usually come here once or twice per week for dinner in the MBS foodcourt and I have to say it is my favorite indian restaurant in whole Singapore. 1. The food quality is amazing. The chicken comes right out of the tandoor and is super juicy and perfectly seasoned. The naan is always freshly made to order and comes and has the perfect balance between being chewy and crunchy. 2. The service is super fast and Chef Dinesh and Mahipal are very nice. 3. The prices are very reasonable considering the place.

All in all, I cannot recommend this place enough. You‘ll get very good food here."

Review,"5 star,Food was very taste and Raju services also Very nice excellent,north Indian taste utlimate,everyone can try once this"
Delicious food!,"Just walked in and a great decision. Excellent food. Little spicy though, which could be reduced to taste. Fresh and crisp roti unlike other restaurants with the chewy ones. Staff is pleasant too, although they need to be more alert to following social distancing properly. Same owner as Song of india, the best indian restaurant in SG, so the quality shows, at affordable prices."
Awesome Ambemce & Tasty Food North Indian Aunthetic,Dinesh CHEF ....inside Restaurant was attend our table & provided Best Recomended Food awesome service mainly Good sense of humor I suggest Try Food here you know the meaning of Food ...Everyone like it for sure Enjoy... Bouna Appetti ..
Amazing Indian food for reasonable prices,"The food is so nice, 5 start quality, really outstanding, delicious, maybe even the best Indian food from Singapore. As a vegetarian a bunch of nice choices, from the traditional to my favourite 'subsz miloni'. The veg biryani is incredible also, full of veg and flavour. You can order online via Grabfood or go to Racecourse Road. Anyhow you won't be disappointed. Highly recommended."
Very nice and awasome food and services,"Me and my wife visited Little India and found this restaurant. My wife wish to eat Chinese, kid want to eat parata and I was looking for some snakes only.

We found every thing under one roof with best services by Dinesh and Joshi.

Rellly appriciated for this."
Excellent Food and great service,"My husband and I were visiting Little India and looking for a place to have a late lunch. We found this restaurant and liked the menu, so we went in. We ordered Mutton Saagwala, Butter Chicken, Bhindi Masala, Subz Zarda Pulao and Garlic Naan. We also ordered a very well priced bottle of Shiraz. The food was delicious and we enjoyed talking to the manager who told us a little bit about the restaurant and Singapore. We left more than satisfied and found we didn't even need to eat dinner that night."
Must visit!,"I went to Indian Express with my family last week. My grandparents are vegetarians and it was difficult to find good places which offer vegetarian food without onion and garlic . Chef Dinesh welcomed us warmly and promised to provide us with delicious food according to our taste and requirements. Chef Raju also came to us to know our requirements and they prepared Dal makhani , mixed veg,vegetable pulao , butter naan and tandoori roti for my dida ,dadu and mom . I ,my sister and my father took keema chicken and garlic naans. Each dish was tasty and flavours were homely.
If you wish to have tasty north indian food in singapore ,this place is a must go!"
Amazing,"Came here after seeing the restaurant listed in an article about good eats on Little India. I'm vegetarian and they offer and good selection of meat free dishes as well as meat and fish choices.

What made me happy was that they offer half servings of dishes which is great for sampling different dishes as a group or perfect for a solo dining or those who aren't too hungry but would like dinner.

I tried 2 different curries- half sizes and had them with some rotis and a beer of course. The flavours were fabulous- thanks Chef Raju. And the waiter Joshi was just as good, we enjoying some good conversation about travel."
Terrible Welcoming,"We as a family with two kids went to this restaurant in little India area in Singapore. We actually wanted to other some fresh juices as we all had exhausted due to hot day. The guy may be the manager said they don’t want give just juice and we should order hot meals. It was really unprofessional for a restaurant which has recommendations from trip advisor.
I want to tell this one to other travelers who is going with trip advisor recommendations.
Please aware they can me aggressive."
Great Food,"The place scores where it matters, food is great. The restaurant staff is very attentive and tries very hard to cater to every request. Our group of friends are regulars in the joint but the place still needs a bit more staff to efficiently manage the place. Try the Sheek Kabab it’s become our groups staple and the chef knows exactly how we like it!"
Enjoyable and Delicious Lunch!,"My mother and I ate here on First Day of Chinese New Year, just yesterday! It was our first time eating at this restaurant.

My mother ordered Butter chicken and rica pilaff. I had garlic naan and Potato, pea curry cooked in a cashew nut tomato curry. We also had a side order for Samosa.

The food was authentic and cooked very well. I loved the way the garlic naan was prepared! it had a lot of garlic and oil on each piece of bread and I noticed the bread was light and crisp and even after sitting in the air-conditioned room for a bit, the naan was still crisp and light and not soggy like so many Northern Indian places I have been to. One order of Samosa has two. The samosa is not a large one but good serving size. I did order a hot masala tea which was to be served after meal but had to cancel it in the end because we ran out of time and had to head home.

The vegetarian dish I ordered was cooked to perfection and very tasty. It was not too spicy and I truly enjoyed this! My mother told me the Butter chicken she ordered was very good and the rice pilaff light and fluffy!

I will definitely come here in the future....I also liked the papadam they served..REALLY GOOD!

What a Pleasant Surprise !!!! It was a Gift for Chinese New Year!

Service by Manager and staff quite good although they did get a little too busy when restaurant began to fill up and every table was occupied.

THANK YOU for the DELICIOUS FOOD & KIND SERVICE!

See You Soon!"
Useless,"Indian eateries are known for their service level. Sadly, this place has no consideration for it. Tried their outlet at MBS food court where the staff was miserable. It was too much of a burden for them to bake the bread properly - simply refused!"
Nice Restaurant,"I live in Singapore but this is my first visit to this restaurant.

Chose chicken mali tikka to start and prawn curry for mains. Excellent choice - not to spicy and cooked just right. Bollywood television to keep you entertained if you need it.

Cheese cultur was tasty but not Amritsar authentic - more like naan.

Great meal and not as expensive as some in the area. Recommend!"
"Food is ok, not much authentic","Visited with my friend, had roti and dhal thadka, taste is ok. Cannot compare with traditional food."
Lunch trip,"Chicken fried rice cooked by Chef Raju was delicious!!

Requested for it to be spicy abd he nailed it!!
Thanks alot for that yummy lunch!"
Amazing food & great service,"We love this place. Last time we went we were a party of 18 people from different parts of the world, Europe, America and Asia.
We did arrangements with the manager David a d the evening couldn't be better.
He recommended several dishes which all were absolutely fantastic. The tanar mutton and prawns masala absolutely delicious, the lamb shoulder to die for (we have this this every time we go), briani and the mix tandoori platters. Absolutely fantastic dinner.
I wasn't very into Indian food as I can't take very spicy food but the cook adapted the spaciness.
We'll come back, this place is definetely a winner!"
The overall courtesy was missing,"We are currently in Singapore for the last 5 days. Staying at Grand Hyatt. Have been visiting different Indian restaurants for dinner every day. Were hoping for a pleasant experience. We ordered paneer sabzi, fried rice, lachcha parantha, butter naan and curd in the end. While we waited for curd we enjoyed and appreciated the remaining food. Raita arrived in place of curd and that too very watery. We held ourselves back snd asked for bowls to serve this watery raita. No bowls were made available..probably were not available at all with them only. Upon tasting we found raita to be extremely sour. Thought of at least sharing the feedback. The feedback was taken with a lot of aggression and the host stated that the curd is fresh and home set. (Maybe the host wasn't aware that even then there us possibility if curd or I should call watery raita to be sour). Nonetheless...we left raita and finished our food. Upon asking for a tissue in addition to three that were kept alongside our plate at the beginning, the request was met quite reluctantly. In the nutshell..we realised that this Indian restaurant wasn't interested in catering to Indian customers respectfully. Just so you know..we had wonderful experience at Urban roti and copper chimney restaurants."
An express tour to Indian food,"Went on 22nd June 2019. Started with a starter and cold drinks. The restaurant is known for its service, quality of food and friendliness. We found them to be valid.

We loved the food and ambiance. A great place in Singapore to have varieties of Indian Food."
Amazing food and great service,"Had a great lunch here after finishing a city tour. Food was fresh, tasty and well priced. In particular the butter chicken was yum, great smokey flavour. Definitely recommend giving this place a try."
Awsome Place,"Great Place. Awsome food.
Very friendly staff and you get a very warm welcome.

A must come for Indian food. Great Place for friends to hangout."
Nice indian food!,"Went to this casual offshoot of the Song of India (of one Michelin star fame) this afternoon. This eatery is smacked right in the middle of the Little India district. It was rather quiet and we sat by a table near the payment counter. The décor is contemporary and still looks new, with a view of the kitchen. Ordered a Raunaq-E-Seekh (minced lamb skewer coated with onion, capsicum), Chicken Vindaloo, and Palak Paneer (spinach and cottage cheese, a perennial favourite of ours). Loved them all. Chose a garlic and butter naan for our carbs. The beers, at $3.9/glass, was a real bonus at that price."
Great Restauarant but understaffed,"Been to this restaurant a few times, the food is progressively good, my personal favourite is Mutton Seekh Kabab and chilli chicken dry. The drinks are reasonably priced but it seems the restaurant Owner’s are not investing in customer experience as the staff seems to be tired and overworked. Not to get me wrong the staff is very friendly and try very hard."
Delicious Indian food in Little Indi,A tour guide recommended this restaurant so I tried it and loved it! Excellent food and service. Definitely recommend this restaurant.
I didn't like it! I loved it!,"Relatively small restaurant on the main road, not far from Little India MRT. In our short stay in Singapore we liked it so much we went twice. A friendly welcome and attentive service from David and an excellent meal. Try the Chicken Khada Masala or the Kashmiri Rogan Josh. As with all restaurants in Singapore beware the 10% service charge and the 7% GST."
Good Indian Food. And well priced.,"Always leery of new places opening, I try to give them some time to settle in but I was intrigued with this one. Mostly because its the same people as Song of India which has a Michelin star. Indian Express is a lot cheaper (lets face it the whole Michelin star stuff is out of control and restaurants use it to put up prices 30%++) and the food does not disappoint. Super casual settings in Little India, with only a few tables in a small restaurant. We walked in at the stroke of noon which was opening time to get a table on Sunday.
We had 3 great vegetarian dishes in ample portion and some Masala tea. By the time we got our food the restaurant was full and service slowed down a bit. However definitely no complaints on the food and service was very much the normal Singapore standard. We left very full and the bill was $50. My only complaint was the aircon is way too strong, to the point of uncomfortable but I am sure this will get fixed soon. If you want good Indian food at a reasonable price try Indian Express."
Authentic Indian cuisine,"My family loves Indian cuisines and having visited so many restaurants, Indian Express is definitely the best in terms of authenticity and taste. Highly recommended! Food is prepared by Michelin award-winning Chef but the price is truly affordable for its superb quality. The waiters are attentive and friendly unlike the other restaurants along that same stretch of road. We think it is without doubt better than Banana Leaf Apollo and Samy Curry."
Last dinner in Singapore,Very tasty biryani. Just at the right amount of spices. Good value for money. Recommended one in little India area
"Great service, great food.","After a long day we were hungry and the Indian Express promised much.
Service was swift and the food was wholesome. All dishes came up to expectations and we were satisfied with all that was presented. Garlic Nan’s,chicken masala,paneer saag and a well cooked lamb shank was just right. David the waiter, kept a thoughtful eye on us and catered to our party of 4 Aussies.(not always easy!) A photo opportunity with the whole staff was a fun end to the evening.....as were the valentine flowers. We’ll be back...thanks guys."
Best food in singapore,"Wonderfu job Raju , i like your food you made for us chicken dum biryani n indo chiense . First time i like Chinese food in singapore m aunthentic taste. Thanks chef Raju"
Terrible experience,"The service was the worst I’ve experienced in Singapore. The main waiter who may have been the owner or manager was rude and unfriendly. Gave us items on our table we didn’t order so we assumed they were complimentary, later to realise we got charged even though we didn’t want them. And refused to take it off the bill. The mango lassi, which is normally my fav item on an Indian restaurant menu was terrible. My wife’s fav dish gol gappa tasted stale and off. It was no surprise that this restaurant was the most empty of the whole area even though had decent decor"
GEM of Race Course Road,"This is under the same brand of Songs of India, the Michelin Star Indian Fine Dining at Orchard.

Price : With mouthwatering variety of food and affordable set lunch at $10.90++, and housepours at $3.90++, this is easily one of the most affordable quality food along this stretch of Race Course road.

Ambience : You would want to come to avoid the crowd the the well-known establishments around yet not compromising food quality, I'm loving the instrumentals, scent and taste of the restaurant.

Food : Cooked by the same Chefs as its Michelin counterpart, though there may be a difference in Quality of Ingredients, but they do not shortchange you in terms of their taste.

Quantity : As the same as most indian cuisine, definitely more than enough for 1 pax.

Service : Very attentive care by Mr David, he come around to survey on food quality and well versed in food knowledge of the menu. He is able to talk about the history of how the food was introduced and how to thoroughly and properly enjoy the various types of indian food. He knows his spices like the back of his hand. He makes very good recommendations and pairings.

Overall, a hidden GEM to avoid popular places during lunch hours in a peaceful environment with affordable prices in relative to its ambience, location and quality."
After office hours!!!,Great service by Mr. David. The food was equally amazing... Applause to Chef Raju For beautiful food!!!!
Amazing taste value for money,"I try their Biryani it’s amazing
Serving also very good
You should try one
It’s conveniently located at Little India area.
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
Excellent Indian,Friendly atmosphere combined with good food and drinks. David looked after us very well. He suggested some side dishes which complimented our food choices. He engaged in polite conversation and the service was excellent. Highly recommended.
Great experience And such a Great food.,"It was a my first Visit Here with My friend.
Food was a good line a such a fine dining Standard. Need Some work on Presentation.
Food Test is Very Good.
We will Come Soon again with our Friends."
Horrible Service and on a Decline,"Have been a regular visitor here but seems like this would be the last visit!

Was here again with a Friend for dinner and ordered drinks and food. Food was ok but the service turned out the worst in my several years of being here.

( we were told The staff who had serving us on earlier visits had left). And the current staff doesn’t seem trained to serve.

The manager who was serving us was deeply engrossed in conversing with a white lady; persistently ignoring to serve us water or the food or the bill thereafter either.
Service was as pathetic as it can get : from ordering food, getting serving incomplete, waiting 10 minutes to get the bill - all so when there are only 3 customers around. For some vague reason the music played was also English for the white guest from bollywood music.

Sadly enough he could not even apologise for any delay & disappointment to us.

Hope they can read and avoid the downhill.

Cheers"
Good Staff And Excellent Food,Lovely Service. The food very tasty and presentation was brilliant....(served by the CHEF UMED )Love the concept and perfect place for a relaxed evening. The drinks were exotic and incredible too.. highly recommended this !
Legendary Food,"While in singapore for our vacation we came across this small place. To the delight and surprise of everyone the place serves the best indian food.
I would say the food is better than most of the high end restaurants of new delhi. The place is hygienic. The food is perfectly balanced. The prices are super affordable.
We ate here almost everyday and at times were waiting for them to open. The staff makes you feel at home. They were so polite and entertained all of our requests and made us feel at home. Will strongly recommend anyone looking for Indian food to go to this place.

P.S- people who are not familiar with Indian food and want to try it should realise that they need to break the garlic naan into small bits the size of nachos and then dip it in the gravy you ordered to enjoy the real deal. Kindly try eating with your hands to get the real feel. I felt coming across people of different ethnicities gobbling up the naan bread and then eating the curry later. Get your hands dirty folks!

WE WILL RETURN !"
Delicious food with great deals...!,"Been there last week with my collegue, was just roaming around on diwali festive week, so thought to try some food as the menu was looking quite impressive with good selection of everything. ....

My friend tried kashmiri lamb chop and I had veg. Biryani along with panner tikka...I just can't explain how great it was.... It was really fabulous and mouth watering food... add on drinks deal made our dinning experience tremendously nice...reasonable price in segment. ..

What best was, restaurant Chef named Umed came and asked about food and service, it's really a great example of happening restaurant.,keep it on ... servers were nice and well mannered. ... will return back soon... Cheers to team (Indian Express) (:"
Avoid at all costs,Pathetic food. It was an excuse of a Chinese Indian dish. Noodles were extra oily and the cauliflower schezwan was fried cauliflower in tomato sauce. Waste of $$.
Excellent India Cuisine,"We found this restaurant by accident and have been back a second time. We were made to feel very welcome.
The food is excellent and there is a friendly welcome. We have tried both chicken and mutton dishes and would recommend either.
The food is very reasonably priced, along with the wine..A bottle of Jacobs Creek for only SGD28.

We will definitely be back."

Dinner @ MBS outlet of Indian Express,"Recently they have opened up in food court @B2.
Had a quick dinner... Service is real quick ... A must have being in such a busy place.
Limited options, but good enough.
Food is above average, rightly spiced considering range of guests being served..
Looks and taste almost like home cooked... No floating oils, etc..
Overall a good experience..."
Food and service good,"Food is good quality is good I’m regular guest here , Anitha service also nice I like this Indian Express"
