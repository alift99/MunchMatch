AWESOME EVERYTHING,The guys welcomed us like old friends and we adored the place. So friendly and delicious food. We had a wonderful connection from France and I shall be a regular visitor when I’m back in Singapore for my show in 2024.
""" Awesome"" experience.","Love their story. Laugh, Dream, Clap, Share, Forgive, Celebrate & Love.
Vibes and friendliness amazing. Food was the best, especially as we were craving vegetables and wholesome food. Loved the Protein Shakes and the Prosecco Spritz's. Franck and his team were Awesome- attentive and helpful and happy to take photos too !! You must visit this Cafe when you are in Singapore. Sue & Grant"
Love this cafe!,Fabulous restaurant and wonderful experience celebrating a family birthday. Extra special and perfect ambiance. Gluten free and vegan options.
Thank you Jolynn for your great service today (28 Dec 2022),"We walked in and met Jolynn. She helped us to get a table even though we had not make any reservation.
I like the way she served us. First to check if this is our first visit. Then shared with us the signature or recommended dishes. She gave us ample time to consider before coming back to take our orders.
Great service. I will definitely be back.
Happy Birthday Jolynn :)"
Awesome- all the way!,"Right from the WhatsApp booking, you could notice the warmth and friendliness of the place. The setting was awesome, the food was even better! Highly recommended!"
"Festive Decor, Great Service and Food","We had a lovely lunch with friends at this hip and awesome place on a busy weekday afternoon. I loved the vibe which was lively and festive with all the colorful decor. It was bustling with so many patrons filling the whole restaurant, but that did not take away from the timely service and friendly interaction with the staff. We had a delicious pumpkin salad, perfectly spiced shrimp curry and the best pineapple cake we’ve ever had. I’d love to be back with more friends and my young adults kids whom I know would love the place!!"
a awesome place!,"Good food, welcoming atmosphare and really friendly staff!! anytime soon again!!! and so good to see that you are still open and in buisness after pandemic!"
Cool place with nice beer,"Came here on a hot evening for a quick break and a fresh beer. The beer is delicious, the staff friendly & attentive, and the decor really great. The whole place has a great vibe. It's a bit on the expensive end, but frankly we had a great experience.

The burgers look amazing too."
Truly Awesome,"This cafe is so awesome. The food was amazing, the drinks were amazing, the staff and the service were amazing. This cafe has the formula right. We will definitely be back again and again. We had an awesome time."
Good food & ambience,Tried this place on a weekend morning and it could get really busy by 11am…. The bread was of very high quality and I was quite happy with the duck burger. They have taken extra efforts in making the decor stand out from other cafes.
Still One of My Favourite Cafes in SG!,"Ever since it's opened in 2014, it's been one of my favourite cafes to bring new friends to or even for a nice quiet meal on my own. My office was at Ann Siang previously so it was walking distance to the cafe. I have since moved on to another industry and office for a few years now, let me tell you, the quaint, rustic and authentic, albeit quirky vibes have not changed these 8 years.

Brought my French friends whom I've just met during my Thailand trip couple weeks ago over to My Awesome Cafe for a nice French fusion treat two nights ago (cos they said they miss French food so much after travelling in Thailand for 2 months) and THEY HAD A HUGE BLAST!

Franck and the team were wonderful and food was great as always! That said, I've been waiting for years, please bring back the Duck Rillettes, Avo & Pesto into My Awesome Salad if you guys can! >.< That combi was just absolutely awesome! <3

Quick Facts: This cafe was transformed from an old shophouse, which was previously the Chung Hwa Free Clinic and is now filled with vintage furniture and bits and pieces from the past.

If you're looking for a really cool place to chill that has great food and drinks, and mostly importantly awesome people and vibes, this is it!"
Thanks Kumar,Really happy with Kumar’s recommendation! really nice and did not fail me ! will come back ahain for the beef burger ❤️🫶🏻
Uniquely different !!,"Came with two of my girlfriends for dinner tonight (10/5/22). First time for the three of us!! Such an awesome experience - totally impressed with the top notch service - they go the extra mile to make our dining experience a memorable one!! When trying to divide our acai dessert, I spilled one scoop on the table, without any prompting, Sue immediately came to the rescue and readily offered to replace that scoop. Thankful for her prompt remedy. Also today was another staff Abigail’s first day on the job but she was so helpful and knowledgeable that I thought she was a long term staff! . Anothe staff Debbie explained the menu so well and we were so glad to have taken Her suggestion for all our food and drink items!

Salmon and duck main course were good and portions were huge!! Drinks were healthy and yummy!! We will be back again soon!!

All the best
Fiona"
Staff to compliment for Priya and Kumar,"Nice environment. Love the place a lot, quite chilling. Good staff service as well, especially to highlight, Priya and Kumar very polite and friendly. Will come to visit again, because of their sweet welcoming, just like a home."
Favourite cafe in Singapore,Excellent healthy food and wonderful staff and people. The decor of the place makes it unique and you are always greeted with a smile. Top recommendation in the area.
Very good Experience,"place, food, welcoming...all is really good Specially the desert ; fondant au chocolat and coconut ice cream"
So enjoy ，nice food ，nice place,the food is very nice and the drinks （ Lychee Mojito） ( Long Island Tea ) made by Donald are super good
Awesome Cafe indeed!,"What a delightful place this is! Delicious food, served with a smile and good conversation. The portions are very generous and the menu very extensive. The ambiance and decor are charming and whimsical. Would highly recommend for a weekend brunch or a weekday coffee. Contact them via WhatsApp for a reservation."
The name says it all.,"This place is one of my go-to venues as it never fails to deliver. It always has a great vibe and atmosphere, not to mention fabulous food and staff."
Brunch,"Exceptional service by Kumar. Enjoyed my time and the prawn curry was nice ! If you can ask for the dark cubicle in the wall, nice and private and cosy ;)"
Awesome,"The best place in singapore with awesome drinks and huge portions of platters the decorations will attract u and the food will make u happy I can’t admire this place in words special thanks to jassie, Franck , bong, suresh and the whole staff you all are awesome
Awesome cafe will be awesome forever
You guys r in my heart :)"
"My Awesome Cafe, is awesome!","My Awesome Cafe is a awesome! The staff are friendly and observant, the menu has a great range of sharing platters and individual offerings, all at a reasonable price.
I had a prawn and turmeric curry with slices of baguette to soak up the amazing curry gravy. Was one of the best curries I have had in Singapore or anywhere else. The depth of flavours made the experience of eating it a pleasure.
My wife had an open sandwich, which again was a delight of flavours but with out those slabs of bread you so often get.

I can’t recommend this place enough, although I would strongly recommend booking as it was very busy."
Parents with kids should definitely visit!,"I never would have thought a place like this exists in Singapore! This place has such awesome service and they were attentive! I went with my friends together with my toddler, they gave her a bucket of toys to play with and when my daughter wanted to wear her shoes back. A lady server so kindly put it back on for her! They even offered complimentary bread for my daughter and kept helping us to keep a lookout for her!

I always kind of eat in a hurry because I need to tend to my daughter before she became cranky and became a nuisance at dine in places but over here, I do not need to worry at all and can even eat at ease because they’re all so good with kids and didn’t mind at all when my daughter was disturbing!

This cafe is definitely worth to visit ❤️"
Do pay a visit… TODAY!,"The best café in Singapore, to me! Great atmosphere, fantastic food and very original drinks! A place you must visit!"
Wonderful Dinning experience,"My team and I visited had a farewell lunch at My Awesome Cafe in Sep. The experience was wonderful, the environment was good, the staffs were very friendly, and the food was impressive. And we are planning to bring our family to visit My Awesome Cafe very soon."
Glad we came,"Spontaneous reservations we had.
Great service and very friendly staffs. They were really helpful introducing and guiding us through the menu for my daughter and I. They even offered my girl a babycino since I had cappuccino . Love their super bright energy. Keep up the positive vibes"
Birthday celebration,"My friends and I had an awesome time celebrating one of our friend’s birthday
The staffs are friendly and great service as it was our first time visiting the cafe one of the staff, my apologies didn’t get her name she was suggesting and recommending what we should have
Thank you for the suggestion
It is an awesome experience, surely will recommend more friends to go there
Thank you Bong and team"
Delicious food!,"Lovely food in big portions. The salads and smoothies are a must-try! Good service too, especially for a busy day. Will be back"
Best cafe and staff in Singapore!,"MAC is an amazing cafe -- we absolutely love the food, the staff, the vibe, and the drinks. It is a very welcoming place and we are regulars. (Since Covid restrictions we have ordered take-away/delivery and the food is always fresh, delicious and well prepared. Well-done Bong, Franck and team!)"
"My awesome cafe, deserves the name, my awesome place too!",Absolutely love this place. Always packed! Food and drinks are amazing! We come back time and time again! If you want to go off the tourist track and want a friendly place with great staff then this is the place to visit!!!
The My Awesome Cafe is absolutely Awesome!,"⭐️The My Awesome Cafe is absolutely Awesome⭐️

As soon as I walked in I was welcomed by the colorful and creative interior that just makes you smile and feel happy that you are there. The multitude of Lanterns and clusters of fairy lights (and some other surprises) will definitely brighten your day. The team here greet you with true passion and nothing is too much trouble.✨

With the endless selection on the menu and hundreds of different choices, there is something for everyone. The menu will not disappoint you!

I ordered the ‘Awesome Burger with Peppered Beef’ and I have to say, I have never had anything so delicious What makes it unique compared to any other burger I have had is the fresh light brioche buns that house the fantastically succulent peppered beef. The cheddar cheese dripping out is truly memorable.

Don’t let me decide for you, come down and choose what catches your eye!

If you are interested in a restaurant and cafe that is both quirky and rustic with incredible food created with passion and love, thus is the place to go.

This place is inspirational so I urge you to go and enjoy all that is awesome at this restaurant and about life"
Not nice experience,"No wifi... so if you seat indoor you won’t be able to get signal ... noise place ... they have full blast fan in your face ... not nice experience at all. No value for money. Menu holders in bad shape .
They have alcohol gel at entrance"
"Uber cool and hip, in every way","Wow, this place is a real labour of love. Every attention to detail has been made to bring the uniqueness of this historical building back to life, and then to offer up fusion menu of just about everything (primarily Western). The restaurant is definitely 'in' at the moment, so reservations might be required - but the serving staff is friendly and will find you a spot if one exists. Seating both inside and out. Definitely a cool experience - give it a try, but call in advance."
Tasty food!,The food was tasty and after a initial rejection they allowed us to utilize a larger table. The tables for couples are way too small. Nice deco... If you like breakfast you should give it a go!
Awesome food ! Even more Awesome staff especially Sue,"Thanks to my dear friend M. for suggesting this delish eatery ! I was warmly greeted by Cool Sue who ran the menu patiently by me . She was chatty and so attentive with her service!! The meal was generous in serving and very fresh !! Awesome staff , great ambiance and looking forward to being back soon !! Thank you Sue for going the extra mile in your welcome !!"
The name justify the awesomeness,"This restaurant really makes you feel awesome in terms of both service as well as food. From making reservation, to warm welcome and affluent service throughout keeps your experience awesome. Staff here treats the customer like family and ensure every little details is looked into. What left speechless impression for the entire experience when one of the staff name Su Went all the way with her umbrealla to the grab to drop my friend to ensure she gets into the taxi with comfort. This is rare of rarest experience one can come across.thanks team and you really see more coming from me and my friends
Cheers"
Weekday brunch,"Came on a weekday morning and it was not so crowded. We manage to get seats immediately. We were impressed with the decoration and most of the time we were busy taking pictures and selfies. This place is cozy but it gets crowded and noisy when crowd starts coming in during lunch. The service is ok and the food is nice, the portion is generous. This is a nice place but not suitable for me as it gets noisy and crowded during lunch. I can hardly hear my partner talking to me.."
Nostalgic boutique cafe,"Found this boutique cafe on Google Maps for our social gathering of 7 during phase 3 of COVID restrictions. The deco and feel make it very nostalgic (haha - revealing my age a bit). We sat at a high table with high chairs for breakfast. The menu looked interesting, but would require some time to navigate. Thankfully the front page of the breakfast menu with the four step process made this easier. They were not stingy on the meat. Eggs came only in two options of scrambled or hard boiled. We enjoyed the oats with coconut and berries. Service was prompt and without issues. Payment methods are currently limited to cash and PayNow."
Great atmosphere,"We visited for a friends birthday and the food was welll-priced, we were greeted and looked after by kind, friendly staff and were even asked to write a wish for 2021 on a ribbon to display across the restaurant, which was a lovely touch."
"Good food but TERRIBLE SERVICE, staff need to be trained","If you want to come there , please think twice before your going.
My experience is:
The food was good, but the service was TERRIBLE:
1. Have made a call to ask for a reservation in advance. However, the staff told me that ""we do not accept the reservation and you can walk-in"" When I come, another staff asked me,"" do you have a reservation?""

- Huh? are you sure the two staff are from the SAME restaurant?

2. Please inform your customer they only can have a 2-hour meal in advance INSTEAD OF giving them last minute acknowledgment to let them pay the bill and get out even if they haven't finished the food—you guys quite good at clearing the table immediately WITHOUT PERMISSION.

Even though lots of customers well recognize your restaurant and you may not care about my review.

But I still want to say:

Please train your staff well and let them know the restaurant is more than just becoming a making money machine. The food you delivered, the culture, and the value you give to the customer is more important.

Please treat your customer with the right attitude and professionalism. To be honest, clearing the table without permission is very offensive and impolite.
PLEASE TREAT YOUR CUSTOMER AS WELL AS YOUR FOOD PROPERLY."
Kumar service is excellent!,Kumar service is excellent! Food and drinks are amazing! Cheers to him! We are definitely coming back!
It really is awesome,"My friends and I love this place. Its chilled, friendly, cosy and the staff are, as the name suggests, awesome.
Its one of those places that you go to for lunch and 5hrs later you're still there.
I've been here for lunch and dinner and on occasions without a reservation. That's always a bit tricky because there's normally a queue of people waiting to get in. That said, if they can accommodate they will.

Let's not forget the food... yum. Make sure you bring a big appetite as the portions are good. They also have a great wine selection (sometimes its a little too great hence our extended stays).

Looking forward to my next visit."
Great place! Buzzing atmosphere and brilliant food,We went to my awesome cafe on a recommendation for my wife’s 50th birthday. Our host and all the staff couldn’t have been more welcoming and the food is amazing! We will certainly become regulars! Thanks again for hosting!!
Awesome Bdae Celebration,Wonderful ToTal Experience. Mr Bong thoughtfully arrange a bdae sing and cake blowing☺️ Surprise. Miss Delia who gives excellent food / drink pairing when asked. The little things to make guests/friends feels comfortable and relax to go about enjoying our chill time.
Great food but EXCELLENT service,"Went on a busy afternoon 5-man strong and was greeted by Sue, one of the wait staff at the cafe. She quickly got us a table with her friendly attitude and another staff, Frank escorted us to our table and recommended their duck confit gratin and spicy thai beef wraps. The food was great but not fantastic. Filling and flavours were nice but caution though, the duck confit gratin can be a little too much with all the cheese so share it with the group if you do decide to order!
Personally, I liked the My Awesome Salad best, salmon, chicken and greens!
In any case, Sue and Frank were really friendly and the other wait staffs made sure our glasses were constantly filled with water (even thought we only ordered one cappuccino haha)."
"Great Vibes, Outstanding burger, Awesome Staff","Went there yesterday with 3 friends for drinks and food.
Booked a bit last minute the same day but the staff managed to find us a solution with a high table inside. Thank you Bong!
I got myself an “Awesome” burger. It is just incredible in its thick brioche. Very Yummy!
The place was packed. A bit noisy unfortunately; still difficult to find a quiet place for dinner in Singapore."
Great atmosphere and staff!,"A few of us went to My Awesome Cafe last night for some food and drinks. I booked on the day and they were very accommodating when I requested a table outside. The atmosphere was extremely welcoming and when we arrived the manager Frank showed us to our table. We were certainly not the easiest of customers due to our questions about the extensive menu but Frank happily talked us through it, made recommendations and accommodated all our dietary requirements. We decided to try the duck burger and ordered some of the dauphinoise. The food did not disappoint and was absolutely delicious! There was also a great selection of drinks. After talking to Frank he explained the reason behind the beautiful ribbons decorations the ceiling - a rainbow of hope. We were encouraged to write our own wishes on a ribbon which they then hung up. We all had a really lovely evening which was made even better by the great service and atmosphere at the bar - something that can be difficult to find at the moment! It’s definitely worth a visit and we will be going back for sure!"
Awesome cafe,"Recommend the cute lightbulb drinks, very insta worthy. Can make a wish here too, the decorations change every season."
"Staff, ambience and food - Truly Awesome!",Friendly and helpful staff; unique combination of flavors which produces a truly enjoyable and tasty meal!
Great address!,"I love this place! The food is great (strongly recommend the Duck/Brioche burger), the atmosphere is very nice (for both lunch and dinner), and the service is brilliant with a smiling and efficient team. Strongly recommend."
Good place to catch up with friends,First time visited here with friends. Very interesting decorations everywhere. So many selections of beers too. The portions of food look so big.
Halloween,"Service was really good, food is awesome. Very helpful waitress(skye) took photos and videos for us. Even surprised us with a birthday cake, how thoughtful."
A hidden gem,"There are so many places to eat brunch in Singapore but time and time again we keep coming back. A hidden gem with a beautiful background and a friendly relaxed ambience. Then there is the food. A Maze ING! Keep
Doing what you are doing As you are awesome!"
Friend's Birthday,"We enjoyed the vibes and food at My Awesome Cafe, the staff are friendly and even helping us to film + surprise our birthday girl with some props!
The foods are great! It's not my first time in the restaurant, always feel good to be back! You can book a reservation through the What's app which you can find in their website.
Really recommend Sour Plum Mojito and the fresh shrimps :P

這不是我第一次到這間咖啡店。裝潢很中式風格，但賣的是西方食物，會有種身處異國的錯覺。員工都很親切，甚至幫我們一起給壽星驚喜。（我的朋友都是第一次去，他們都很喜歡）。可以通過What's app訂位，但是要用英文，回覆訊息的人很好。有些員工也可以說中文，所以不用擔心英文不通。"
The staff is Super friendly.,The staff is Super friendly. I also learn some Hindi from them. The food is awesome and the sugar-free beer is fantastic now.
A simply AWESOME dinner at Our Family 5,"A first time visit allowed me to judge with fresh eyes. As I was approaching the outside table to scan the SafeEntry QR code, a towering figure whom I had guessed was Franck Hardy greeted me and ushered Mary and I to our table. Franck made the effort to explain that the bright and cheery lanterns of yellow, orange and red were to symbolise early spring and they wanted to communicate hope to all of us having fought against the coronavirus.

Before we even caught our breath, Franck introduced us to his partner Bong who granted us a short history of 中华医院 who remains their landlord. As warm and friendly as Franck, Bong kindly guided us through the menu and helped pick just the right starters and mains to share.

A special SHOUT OUT to our assigned server Sky, a diminutive lady who really went an extra mile to ensure all our needs were met. Sky had even shared that notwithstanding a few attempts to poach her from other restaurant owners, she remained loyal to MAC. That's a powerful testimony to the warm and nurturing culture she had grown to adore.

A quick summary:
Ambience : 9/10
Food : 9/10
Service : 10/10

Would I recommend to my family and friends?
Ans : YES!

Rarely are all the elements of an awesome dining experience are gathered in one place. At MAC, they are. To our sheer delight.

I'll be back."
Friendly staff helped with birthday surprise,Really thankful for the staff who helped surprise the birthday boy with a birthday song and tasty slice of pineapple cake! Good service and good serving portion!
Living up to its name of being Awesome!,"This place lives up to its name indeed! I had a virgin experience in this beautiful cafe, and I was blown away! I was greeted by the friendly staff and beautiful decor upon arrival and I must say the coffee, shakes and food is really awesome too! Definitely returning again!"
LOVE THIS PLACE SO MUCH,"Have been here countless times, and will be back many more. Great ambience, decoration, Inspiration and overall friendliness of the staff. Really one of the most welcoming places in Singapore- with excellent food, great prices, quality ingredients and 100% recommend going upstairs and checking out the little shop - which has some really incredible items and antiques for sale! Sky and Kumar are especially friendly and awesome! ;)"
Lot of choices for all,"I have been there three times in that many months. And the range of food, quality and quantity of preparation always amazes me. The salads, the sandwhiches, the cold cut& cheese platter all worthy of a rave. Do try "" my awesome tonic"" a home made remedy served hot. The service is also good. Just ensure u have cash or then paynow/paylah as no debit/ credit cards accepted. Worth visiting for it vibrancy and small shop feeling."
Good food and ambience,"Coffee is meh, but i guess it's not the coffee that matters. The ambience is comfortable and the decor brings us back to the past. Foods are great, the spicy beef wrap is good for sharing. Oh yeah, they accepted cash or paynow as payment mode."
My Aweson Lunch Birthday Celebration with my wife here. With Aweson Food & most of the Aweson Jessie & Working Staff!,Great Food & Menu with Authentic Cosy Ambience. Huge Serving protion of food & Great Service & Cheerful Working Staff here. Truly Enjoy our lunchtime & the Shocking Shout of Birthday Celebration..🥳😍
AWESOME INDEED,"It was my first time at Awesome cafe on 11th Sept (DEFINITELY NOT MY LAST) with my girlfriends, they were raving about it since their first time there last week, so we decided to do my celebratory drinks at that spot.

Ran a little late due to work & the rainy weather, but they were kind enough to hold the table for us.

SUPERB ESPRESSO MARTINIS. EXTREMELY ACCOMMODATING & ATTENTIVE STAFF. Lets just say there wasnt a time that we had empty glasses on the table or in our hands.

100% would recommend Awesome Cafe for any type of event or weather"
Interesting deco with reasonable,"Interesting deco with reasonable pricing. We ordered the duck platter. It was good, except duck confit was a little too dry. Overall good experience."
Wonderful experience,"The ambience is very pretty, great place to take photos. Food is very nice. Staff is very freindly too. Jimmy helped me take very nice photos. Highly recommend"
So divine,I’ve been coming to this cafe for the past few days consecutively. Absolutely loving the concept and sky have always been an absolute sweetheart to me! She’s really charismatic and I love her service! Will be coming again as always!
Awesome people and awesome service !!!!!,We came by casually and we have decided that this will be our GO TO place! Amazing place and staff like Sky and Priya! They are amazing and we would come here again just for them!!! Love you guys!!!

Celebrate birthday,Awesome cafe Awesome food Awesome service Awesome price Awesome people! Special thanks to all staffs including Gretchen and Priya & esp Sue and Sky. Definitely worth coming!
We just had brunch at the,"We just had brunch at the my awesome cafe, not only is a cute little place with a unique character, it’s food is also very delicious! I can highly recommend it and when you go, ask for Sky, she is the best you will have a great time!"
Nice Service n impromptu bday surprise,Good service and helps to do a mini bday surprise for frenx. They always come to chat and check whether we need anything. Recommended. It is quite full and should reserve before your visit. The portion of food is big too.
Casual dining with 5 star service team!,"I’m not easily impressed, but this place is excellent. It’s colourful, it’s vibrant and filled with beautiful people. I went for dinner and it was packed (safe distance observed). Quirky decor with retro display and furniture. Vegetarian and healthy drinks option available. Reasonable priced with generous potions, I see myself heading back there. Thank you Priya for being so attentive to us, you are a gem!

PS: ♥️ the pasta drinking straw♥️"
"Great food, unsatisfactory service","I had lunch with my friend. I ordered a sandwich. It was awesome. But one of the staff's service was quite rude. After we finished our lunch, we ordered coffee as well from other staff. But less than five minutes after the coffee was served, she told us our table has another reservation. So we ask her why didn't tell us before we order coffee. She said she didn't take orders.,, hahaha I am really really disappointed with that. Please be more polite. I don't want to go here anymore."
Average meal,Came with great expectation after reading the comments and reviews. Overall mediocre experience and service.
"Great ambiance, another coffee spot❤️",Gretchen (staff) is very accomodating. We were lucky to meet Frank (owner) and had a short chat. A must for you to check on their coffee and place to have a alcohol night😍
"Mr Bong,a is brilliant host... great place , great food , great vibe... must experience in Singapore .",Must experience in Singapore.... you must try the ‘Awesome Sling’ Say hi to Mr Bong ... he’s a cool dude
Very good & healthy french food,"We went today after viewing good reviews on Trip Advisor and we can confirm this address is fabulous for authentic french food lovers.
Here is what we liked:

- Very good service, finding us a table after a short wait even as we walked in instead of booking. The owner is on the front line, visibly totally committed to satisfy everybody
- True french food with quality and some (not all) organic ingredients
- You are not hungry anymore after the duck confit papilllote or the perigourdine salad we chose
- The organic spiruline + coco + lime drink is huge and really refreshing,
- The melting fondant organic chocolate cake is definitely a must-try for true cocoa-addicts like me
- No GMS in food, pure natural taste
- Prices are very, very reasonable for that quality of food in Singapore

This is definitely a must-go if you are looking for great french food.
Beware the style is not posh, no nice silverware or napkins, this is a very casual atmosphere."
Is it your bday? Just come here,Really good wine(which is difficult to find one in SG) staff is so nice and food also really good! It is worth it👌 Happy happy 👍 highly recommended!!
Totally awesome,"Really a great restaurant, with a very warm welcome, an excellent cuisine with a large choice of food, the bread is so good 😋 and great decor, go for it!"
Fun lunch,"Really impressed with the staff at My Awesome Cafe. Friendly, helpful, proactive... don't experience these traits in many Singapore restaurants."
Awesome Experience!,Very nice and friendly services. Thank you for Chef Franck and Gretchen for the AWESOME experience and foods!
Awesome,"Nice and special food, nice environment and friendly staff especially Priya, lastly price acceptable too"
Awesome experience,"As the name of the cafe suggests, my co-workers and I had an awesome experience at the cafe!
I was hunting for a pineapple upside-down cake for a birthday celebration for some colleagues. My Awesome Cafe popped up, and I called to enquire. Gretchen was helpful and prompt in getting my order for the cake. The whole process was so easy and effortless! Within minutes, my order was confirmed!
We had requested for delivery but due to last minute changes in plan, we decided to drop by the cafe to have a little celebration at the cafe instead.
Gretchen was once again super helpful with the change in plans. She helped with the arrangements without any questions asked. All our requests were met almost immediately!
The ambience at the cafe was amazing! And the people there are as awesome as the cafe itself!
We kept to the small group size (cos of the covid situation), but the birthday celebration was much enjoyable, even with the rest who zoomed in to join the celebration!
We hope one day we could all drop by the cafe for another birthday celebration!
Thank you My Awesome Cafe, for the awesome experience! :)"
Lives up to its name!,Totally lives up to its name! Really cool decor and good food. I had the My Awesome Sandwich and Oven baked peri peri chicken - delicious plus healthy! Portions good for sharing. Owner Franck is warm and friendly too!
Uniquely Beauty,Awesome place for breakfast. Jessie is very helpful on menu discussion and adjusted the menu for your need👍
Simply amazing!,"As always this wonderful place never ever fails to deliver. Safely checked in in these challenging times like we're all used to now after several months, we were warmly greeted as always, table was perfect, drinks served immediately and the joy unravelled. Three platters of stunning food between us complimented by several bottles of bubbles, great craic with friendly attentive wait staff was what we all needed. Two of us had been before, two of us hadn't and as the evening sadly ended we were in no doubt we would be back time and time again. With a rare blend of fabulous decor, relaxed friendly ambience, quality food and drink, superb staff this gem of a place will remain a firm favourite"
Lovely place!,"Great European food, amazing service and the staff are so friendly! The place has a really cozy ambiance."
One of my favorite places in Singapore,"The food is great. Frash, generous size, reasonably priced and wonderful service. Don't miss it! The awesome burger is highly recommended"
Great place for a wonderful evening!,"Great food, amazing service and wonderful staff . You should try the burgers! Large enough for a hungry man."
Visit during covid-19 and,"Visit during covid-19 and find the owner/ staff is very rude. Without knowing that in order to get inside we need to follow restaurant special procedures,since there is nobody come to explain anything to me, I just scan QR code and walk inside to meet my friend who is already there, suddenly the owner/ staff came with an attitude that I sneak in and escort me out, also said that if Im not happy to follow the procedures, please go to other restaurant.....
Well,,, I will happily follow if you only put the sign for me to read or stay there to explain.
How are we suppose to know you have special procedure unlike other places?!?!"
Delicious!,"Had this delivered to my door. The food was hot and delicious. Portion sizes were also really generous which was nice as I was starving! I especially recommend the chocolate fondant, perfect consistency and not too sweet."
Awesome delivered to your door,"My friends and I remember this cafe fondly. Franck and his team are enthusiastic and always with such a warm smile. We were very excited when we saw they now deliver and they certainly did not disappoint. We ordered the parma ham sandwich, duck confit and the quinoa salad and enjoyed all of them. Food was warm and fresh. Delivery was so quick within 20 mins of ordering. We highly recommend you try their awesomeness today . Support our local cafes!!"
Cozy Cafe,"one of the best cafe! love the coziness, the vibe and everything else. it's always crowded, i've visited twice but sure more to come! love all the variety of food as well :D"
Lights will guide you home,"What a beautiful place, with myriad colourful lanterns adorning the ceiling. This cafe is converted from an old Chinese dispensary (I think) and filled with wonderful wait staff who make you feel right at home. KUMAR, you are awesome! Thank you for taking time to introduce what’s in the menu and what is good. Loved the awesome sandwich! This was my first time here and won’t be my last!"
Great Vibe,This place is always packed so I would recommend coming around 11:30 am if you're coming for lunch. I tried the lasagna and really enjoyed it. The best part about this place is the staff. They are very friendly and attentive!
Great ambience and great service!,"Great ambience and great service! They took time to check in with us on the food and at the same time, get to know us. Would totally come back here again! 😊"
"Overcrowded, but worth the visit!","It was quite overcrowded when I came with my partner earlier in December last year. As I'm not a big fan of overcrowded space and narrow walkways, I still enjoyed my visit as the staff were very approachable and friendly. They communicated with us like how friends do instead of being too formal like what most restaurant's approach. Food wise price is high considering a budget-type seating environment, but it was still worth a first time visit. Would I come back again? Maybe for special occasions cause their food are indeed nice. Hats off to the friendly staff who made me feel comfortable when I clearly showed I was claustrophobic."
"Great vibes, a very awesome salad, and splendid service","One of the best cafes in town!

It's a bit quiet during this downtime, but the staff are ever-welcoming, and the food is as delicious as the first time I had it in 2017/2018.

Highly recommend my awesome salad, which is truly awesome. And the Wednesday day and evening team.

Apart from social distancing measures in place, they've gone above and beyond in ensuring the place is clean, thoroughly, throughout the day.

Love this space, and the amazing team effort, will come back real soon!"
"Awesome place, Awesome food & Awesome service","My friends and I had an awesome time, food was yummy and our service staff (Kumar) was attentive and sweet. Will definitely return."
