Nice place to relax,We ordered prawn noodles and bak cho mee. They are nice but the server ought to have provided chilli on the side or at least offer it.
Service Standards Has Dropped,"Coffee was served with no spoon had to ask the staff for spoon twice. Cheng Teng was also served without spoon asked for spoon but was never served, had to use the same spoon for my desert and main dish."
Birthday dinner at the lobby lounge,"I reserved a table for 3 stating it was an occasion to celebrate my daughter's birthday. The restaurant kindly arranged for a window seat from which we could have a delightful sunset view of the pool and the lush greenery that surrounds the hotel ground. Though the restaurant is set adjacent to the hotel lobby, the space between tables, the high ceiling and the views provided for a quiet and pleasant dining experience.

The lobby lounge serves local fair- laksa, prawn noodles, beef rendang and the likes so if you're looking for anything else, you might want to consider other dining options in the hotel. In terms of pricing, you'd be expecting to pay quite a penny for what you might get from a hawker centre or a coffeeshop but in my opinion, the ambience and level of service is good justification for the price tag. To top it off, the hotel gave us complimentary birthday cake for my daughter's birthday celebration- it's something we have come to expect from shangri-la but experiencing it again still made it special.

A big thank you to Paul who served us from the start till the end. His attentive and attuned to our needs throughout the dinner. I will certainly be back again."
Exceptional service recovery,"Initially planned to dine in here but had to cancel my reservation and switch to take-away. Was politely served and given my orders without complaints despite adding on with a 2nd order.

They did miss out my 2nd order and only realised it as I was halfway back to my workplace, and delivered my 2nd order to me with haste and an apology. Really impressive working crew who showed no frustrations despite my ""anger"". Thank you for the enjoyable experience."
Hi-Tea Set @ Shangri-La Hotel,"The Hi-Tea Set is delicious, we cleared the food. The environment is comfortable, clean and nice view. We are able to see greenery through the stretch of big glass windows."
Crown jewel of the lobby!,"In an already beautiful lobby, this is the best part. We only came here briefly for a complementary drink before checking in but it was lovely nonetheless and provides part of a startling first impression for guests and visitors. Great art work too, sculptures of people swimming: has to be seen to be believed in fact."
Best food in singapore,"I had nice local food in lobby lounge with my friends. especially the high tea and Laksa was nice. Also all the staff was kind and attentive especially katrina, summer, Ella, and making nice drinks Camille. thank you all."

Enjoyable afternoon tea,"It was a really nice afternoon. We tried the Vegan, Classic, and Children's menu. The best tasting one ended up to be the Vegan one. It is very pricey though I must admit but there were free flowing scones and icecream."
Local,"The selling point at this lounge is local food. They have a local brunch at 10am, and local lunch starts 12pm for a la carte and buffet. We had the a la carte and it was good, and expectedly overpriced for local food. Even the drinks and desserts were local, though we had wine"
Not worth it at this price as it's not tasty.,Not worth it at this price as it's not tasty Not worth it at this price as it's not tasty Not worth it at this price as it's not tasty
High tea at lobby lounge,"We had an amazing time at the lobby lounge today; food was lovely. Cherry was very attentive and informed us when our seats were ready and made sure we were comfortable.

Alyssa/Yssa served us wonderfully brewed drinks which made our day with her smile and cheerful demeanour.

Siti, who was our server throughout, impressed us with her attentiveness and service oriented nature. She went above and beyond and offer to help us take a picture, and we were able to capture this pleasant memory.

Also, thank you Wendy for making our meal so lovely!

We are delighted by the high level of service. Kudos to the team!"

Awesome experience,Always take good care by attentive staffs. They are so professional & at high standards of service. Always a Special Thanks to all of them there to make Lobby lounge a comfortable & great place to spend quality time at.
Cosy place to hang out with friends,The embience is cosy. However did not get to taste the laksa as it has finished according to the waiter. It was a disappointment

Best and Shang Style services Home away from home,"Even the businesses are busy, but theseeManager Bellinda welcomes me with sincere greeting. The staffs here recognize their regular guests at the first glance. So pleasure to be recognized since my last visit to SLS was 2 or 3 years ago.

I would like to appreciate the staffs for their extraordinary services. Alyssa, bartender for the best lemon grass drinks. Angle for your heart warming smiles. Ella for services with consistancy.

Once again for the Manager Bellinda recognized me at the first glance. It really means a lot for me.

That's also the Shang style services for travelers feeling home away from home.

I Highly recommend SLS Lobby Lounge to take a seat and order drinks to buzz up.

Appreciate for the staffs on duty: Bellinda, Alyssa, Angle and Ella."
Dinner at Lobby Lounge with my BFFs,"If you’re looking for one reason why the government relaxed the restrictions in this pandemic, it’s so that everyone can enjoy their time @ Shang Ri La’s Lobby Lounge, with excellent food and amazing service beyond Michelin standards.

Huge thanks to the talented bartender Angel, and majestic and royalty level service by Zheng, Sarah, Jocelyn, Deepak."

Extraordinary customer experiences,"The Lobby Lounge at the Shangri-La Hotel is my favorite sanctuary. Not only is the ambiance and decor of this lounge cozy and relaxing, more importantly the customer service is outstanding.

I wish to compliment Wendy Wan and Belinda for the their commitment, devotion and passion in delivering extraordinary customer experiences every time, without fail. They make our dining experiences such a pleasant delight so much so that when they are not on duty, I feel something amiss. And in spite of the challenging working conditions - as the lounge can be evidently short handed at times , they are always pleasant and assuring.

I dine at the lounge at least twice a week and for more than 2 years now and I also invite my business associates to have meetings in the lounge . I am a FAN because of the wonderful people who makes a huge difference every time we dine at the lounge. Thank you Wendy , Belinda for the delightful and memorable experiences.

Ms Su Ying Ong"

Lobby Lounge high tea on boxing day,"High tea set in Shangri-la Singapore lobby lounge is very popular. While the food is good, their service is outstanding. Compliments to Angel for her good service that helped end our tea session on a good note."

We really felt comfortable and enjoyed our time & ambience of the lounge. Will be coming back again next time"
Disappointing,"It was a disappointing visit. The food quality was poor. The presentation also left much to be desired, e.g., the plate did not even sit well on the tier stand. The third layer came with cling wrap that was removed in our presence.

I don't think we would ever visit again, unfortunately."
Drinks,"Service provided by Alvin, Zheng, Alyssa and Katrina was good and superb. Drinks was great would come back to drink again"

Delicious food and kind service,"I enjoyed my visit here in Shangri-la especially the food during tea time in the Lobby Lounge.

优雅的空间,优雅舒适的环境，又再次享受到Yssa 和Jocelyn热情亲切的服务❤️❤️❤️ It’s a place I will come back again with my fiends really thank you to the team for taking care of me.
Needed quiet thinking space & Quick breakfast,Service staff are brilliantly attentive. Wisely calm and distantly attentive and warm. The perfect sanctuary for a much needed quiet 45 minutes of calm.
Impressed by Qing Ting,Great environment and everything was Awesome! COCKTAILS WAS DAMN GOOD! Please order more like us..Thank you Shang we really enjoyed it..A bartender who name Qingting she really friendly recommend us a lot of good cocktails..
"Amazing Food, Wine and Service!","Visited The Lobby Lounge with my girl-friends on 26 March evening. Ordered a tier of cheese with wine pairing from their ""Cheese and Wine Experience""; Fried Carrot Cake, Kong Bak Pau and Nyonya Kueh from their ala-carte menu. Food were yummy! Love the Chateau de Chamirey, Pinot Noir! Goes really well with the cheese. Service staff were friendly and explained in detail on the items served. Great experience, certainly a good place to relax, chill and drink with friends. Will be back for more wine!"
Awesome afternoon tea at Lobby Lounge,"Staff are friendly, we were allowed to go in to the restaurant before 3pm, unlike some of the hotels who are very rigid with this. Recently visited Lime restaurant for their high tea, and all of us had to queue outside and not allowed to enter till 3pm and no communication from the staff. Shangri-la did a good job on this. Food is good and staff attended to us promptly. Overall, everything is good, i will definitely be back again!"
Great visit at Shang,I came at Shang with my friends. Staff are all friendly and accomodating specially Yssa from lobby lounge.
GREAT SERVICE & AMBIANCE,"Been visiting The Lobby Lounge and I’m always impressed with the top notch service by Wendy, Yssa, Mugi & Qing Ting!!! It’s like a level of a well known airline in Singapore & I can say that it is even beyond that experience!!!

Keep it up, they deserve recognition in their hardwork!!!

-Rogel"
Absolutely love the food and,"Absolutely love the food and ambience at The Lobby Lounge at Shangri-La Orchard hotel. Omg the laksa , fish soup , Kong Bak bao and roti prata are amazingly good. The service here is also world class standard. Will definitely come back here again. Great place to spend your weekend ."
Excellent food,"The booking experience was extremely smooth and easier; made the reservation one day before the visit, got to modified it a bit (also easy) in the morning before our visit in the afternoon.

The food was great, and reasonably priced. And of course, fantastic environment of the hotel ambience."
Perfect for Meetings,"It’s a lovely lounge with a touch of elegance, perfect for meetings and catch up. Compliments to the service team for its warm service especially to Thao who is ever gracious."
Always a great experience at the Lobby Lounge!,"I would like to highly commend the staff of Shangri-La Hotel’s Lobby Lounge- namely Yssa, Katrina and Angel for their warm hospitality and high standards of service. Every time I come here, they never fail to give a very good service and I can observe that with how the treat the other guests. This is one of the reasons why I always love going back to Lobby Lounge.

Again, many thanks to Yssa, Katrina and Angel. More power to Shangri-La! Always a fan!"
Outstanding in the New Normal,"Great service, local food and drinks. Despite the new normal set up, the team especially Camille provided that sophistication and attentiveness to our needs. Well done."
Birthday Hi-Tea,Camille and Jennelyn give such a wonderful service. They are very hospitable and friendly. We had a quick hi-tea to cap off our celebration but it made it a memorable one.
Excellent ambience and roti,Excellent ambience and roti prata on a Sunday morning. Unfortunately service sucks... no staff to be seen for 20 mins ... fortunately waiter Mugi saved the day ... efficient and lovely person ... was the only staff seen working !
Excellent service,Our negroni night made possible at the Lobby Lounge and these ladies Ms. Camille and Ysa made us feel welcome. Totally a night to remember and I would definitely recommend to visit The Lobby Lounge for some chill place to chat.
Negroni Night 💗,"Still feeling the Holiday vibes,me and my friends went to The Lobby Lounge to have a night cap. Lovely ladies Yssa and Camille were very warm and friendly in welcoming us and made us feel at home.

Their negroni is one of the best that we had and is definitely a night to remember ☺️
Ambiance and service was perfect. It is a must to drop by The Lobby Lounge for a quick drink. Do look for Ms Yssa and Ms Camille. Hope to see them again when we go for negroni. Thank you lovely ladies ❤️"
Christmas gathering amongst friends,"The a la carte menu of local dishes hit the right spot amongst us, the fussy ones, who prefer to have more savouries than sweets, and not the usual Christmas delights like mince pies, etc.
The service by the Lobby Lounge staff were above par - as usual!"
"The food was average, ambience is good. We ordered the Christmas hi-tea set, the pastry were quite bad, scones dry","We ordered the Christmas hi-tea set and the 3tier was beautiful but taste normal and we feel that the pastry were not fresh. The scones were terribly dry and the cream became watery. If you hate fruit cake, please don’t order this set. Not enough savoury items to balance. For the price, we expect better food."
Quality of Chope Reservation Online,"I made a confirmed reservation, for lunch and a certain pax. When I came to Shangri La, I was told in front of my guests who had arrived punctually that there was no such thing as a reservation in their system. We were asked to frequent another restaurant, and that only served tea and cookies rather than the lunch menu we booked. When we were about to leave we were informed that the reservation had posted by then. Chope is an ineffective way of making a reservation. You may lose face if you use it."
Excellent ambience,A wide variety of food but the savory against sweet could have been slightly more proportionate. The service level can be better as we were tucked at the corner of the lounge and it was quite difficult to get the attention of servers. I wish they could be more initiative and prompt to check the customers' needs at intervals.
Wonderful Birthday Breakfast with Friends,"I had a great morning celebrating my birthday with friends. Thanks to Jennelyn who assisted us very well, it was very warm and excellent service. No regrets of spending this time at Shangri-la Orange Grove."
Breakfast at Lobby Lounge,Excellent service and food during our early morning visit. Affirm to the friendly and courteous Jennelyn who attended to our needs. A great way to start the day with Lobby Lounge experience. 😊
Amazing High Tea and stunning service,"Great service by Kathryn - warm and friendly service! Amazing to have staff like her, enjoyed our high-tea and food is absolutely delicious!"
Excellent service and wonderful,"Excellent service and wonderful ambience. Catherine and Juan were excellent. Food was good. And most importantly, the price for afternoon tea was very reasonable for a 5 star hotel"
Weekday High Tea,"Fantastic service by Kathryn during afternoon high tea. She was warm, attentive and helpful. Definitely recommended for gathering with family and friends."
Excellent service!,We were served by Krish who provided us with excellent service. He was very attentive and refilled our food and drinks promptly. The food and drinks were also delicious. We had a great time at The Lobby Lounge. Thank you Krish for making this experience a wonderful one!
High Tea at Lobby Lounge,The High Tea set taste great. Top tier dessert is not too sweet. Middle kueh is soft and tangy. Lower tier savory is not too salty either. Kopi Tarik is too sweet. Suggest you go for a pot of tea.
"Terrible Food, Great Ambience","Reservation
We booked a reservation through Chope last week, and received one email confirmation and one email reminder for the day before our booking. And yet when we arrived, our booking was not even reflected in the system (even when I showed her the email confirmation from Chope).

Food
Food was subpar for the price we paid, the chocolate was bland but very thick and creamy - the kind you get fed up with after one bite. The peranakan deserts were cold when served - taste-wise, it's on par with frozen food (maybe just a little better).

Service
The staff who served us were attentive and friendly. Service-wise, there is nothing but praise for the place."
Afternoon tea,"The afternoon tea has 3 tier which is quite alot for 2 pax! I think that maybe 3 people will be able to share it as well. Tried their fish soup - it's delicious! Alot of vegetables in it. Their chicken rice are quite big too. Overall their food is quite nice. However, not everything in their high tea set is delicious. Only some are delicious.
Also, it is hard to get a service staff to serve us. We wave for some time but no one came.
Will be good to reserve in advance as there are alot of people."
Peranakan Afternoon Tea,"Dig into our local heritage by having the Peranakan Afternoon Tea @shangrilasg. But it was a funny episode. Thinking it was for one pax, we confidently ordered two despite the staff confirmation. And boy, we were stunned when the three-tiered set arrived enough to feed four!

Served in the Peranakan style plates, the tiers consist of the local delights, kuehs and sweets. Do note each tea set comes with two cups of beverages only.

Highlights include:
Hae Bi Hiam Sandwich
Chilli Crab Puff
Kueh Kosui
64% Chocolate Truffle"
Bad service,"We went for Sunday lunch but despite the beautiful scenery of the pool side, the service was oblivious. The waitresses were just ignoring customers and we had to wave for service. It was very irritating as the restaurant was empty and not busy. Can the management train their waitresses properly?"
Best peranakan afternoon tea in Singapore,Environment was very cosy. Really enjoyed the Peranakan Afternoon Tea over here. Love the ngor hiang and pulut hitam cake. Not to mention the free flow gelato too. :) The service in Lobby Lounge is definitely a plus point. Very friendly and attentive service by Fiona and Chok Han. Will definitely return again. ❤️
Lovely Afternoon Tea It was,"Lovely Afternoon Tea

It was a rainy day. Perfect for afternoon tea in this oldie but goodie, Shangri-La hotel

We ordered the Peranakan High Tea. The food is good. Pretty, delicate and delicious.

Ambience was great. There are ample of space. You could relax at the lounge and have a sip of the tea/coffee. Great way to enjoy the afternoon.

Service was good."
Wonderful for food & drinks!,"love the ambience, love the food & drinks! staff were all friendly with big smiles on their face, making us feel very welcomed! Ms Thao service was superb! Love her recommendations as well. Definitely will be back for more!"
Terrific Sunday Brunch!,What a lovely and authentic Singapore food experience! The lounge itself is beautiful with stunning views of the gardens and waterfall. Very sophisticated yet cozy table settings. And the staff is outstanding and friendly! We loved all of the selections and the made to order kaya toasts. We felt very well taken care of---our tea and drinks were constantly replenished. Highly recommended!
Wonderful experience,Great ambience and wonderful service especially by Kelly. Food is beyond delicious too and the staff kindly provided recommendations. Would love to be here again!

Many thanks to Ms Thao and Ms Katrina for their excellent service.
This place is highly recommended."
Good place for drinking,"Nice place for drinking and talking with your friends. The chicken and the bả snack. Yayyyyyyy.... my taste, very nice.

The price ok. Not exxpensive much. Still ok. Love it."
Excellent Service and Thump up for recommendations,"Very thankful for the excellent service recommended by the staff Ms Belinda. Me and husband feel fullfill since she briefly very clear with the explained regarding buffet what included and everything. For the most recommendation is the chilli crab and beef rendang very test good thumb up for this test super delicious. At first Only need to prioritize buffet food are little lousy, those chef when asking only standing with no smile and introduction food but Glad Ms Belinda could help this out. Such a Nice Lady. Me and husband would like rate Average ."
Food & Atmosphere,"The Atmosphere are good. And the staff, Angel serve with good attitude. If you want to have music n singing, you may come from Tuesday to Saturday. Thank you"
Dinner at lobby lounge,"Thanks for providing my family a amazing dinner experience,chicken rice is the best in sg I have try before, and for service team, yssa, colleen, annie, angel are very attentive to all our request, thanks a lot."
Dream in the lobby.,"Last night I went to the lobby for drinks. I had a nice lychee martini made by Yssa. And other staff Thao, Annie and Katrina were so kind and had a warm welcome from them. I feel so comfortable and nice ambience feel like at the garden. I hope to visit again."
Dinner,I am writing this to specially commemorate one of the service staff for her proffesional service that i received while i was here for dinner that night. Her name is Annie. She was very friendly and had provided me the best table service that i could ever asked for.Thank you - Seah
Great place to chill and hang out,"The Lobby Lounge Shangrila
My kids loved the chocolate cake with malteesers on top! I loved the carrot cake. It was melting in the mouth but not too sweet. Thanks to the warm service from Belinda, Katrina, Kathryn, Jenelyn, Kelly we enjoyed our stay."
Relaxing Amiience,"Had lunch consisting of a semi-buffet and an order of a main course. Buffet is limited selection of Peranakan dishes and main course is a selection of well known hawker foods such as Bak Kut teh, chicken rice, Laksa. I don't find the food great just very ordinary. I would go for the nice quiet relaxing with comfortable seating than the food."
Chef was rude no given any answer.,"First visited on 27/1/20.

I came with family and got good service provided by the staff name Belinda from the beginning but got wonder why and no sukling pig around 1pm, me and family very feel disappointed and sad. Asking to check with the chef but seem like chef have no answer at all and what kind of hotel 5* with the prestige Chef with no answer, this kind of RUDE behavior with no given answer to Guests, paying $68++ but not worth it. Very not acceptable."
Amazing Breakfast Place,"A glorious breakfast on weekends and public holidays that has perfect variety of local breakfast dishes, that follows the recipes of various legendary hawker stalls from around the island, delicious local drinks, and of course, that perfect Shangri-La service. You would be hard pressed to find a better breakfast place on weekends if you are looking to have your hawker fix satisfied, but don't want to brave the crowds, or simply want to pamper yourself a bit (as of course, compared to the hawker centres, this place is a more expensive). Absolutely recommend it."
Came here for lunch with my family,Came here for lunch with my family yesterday afternoon. We had the buffet which came with a signature dish and a drink and tea the food was alright but not very fantastic my Mom said the beef had an extra taste and smell to it. Menu had very limited choices. Overall great ambiance and service was ok.
Reasonably priced high tea with good service,"Reasonably priced weekday high tea, with a variety of savory snacks and sweet ones. Team of crew offered great service esp so for a lady - Angelica that serves us warmly and tried her best to meet the needs of our big group. Thanks."
