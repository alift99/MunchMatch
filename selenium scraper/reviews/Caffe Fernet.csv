Fun cafe by Marina Bay,"Caffe Fernet is a nice place to get takeout, have a drink or enjoy a sit down meal. The Caffe faces Marina Bay and has outdoor and indoor seating and is in walking distance of the Fullerton Bay hotel and Fulerton hotel. It's a great view of the Marina Bay Sands."
Perfect Birthday Celebrations,"We had the most amazing visit and were completely looked after by the Caffe Fernet team.

We visited for my wife’s 30th birthday and were given a table with a fantastic view over the bay (all tables have a great view - worth a visit just for that). The food was incredible, very authentic Italian. We didn’t mind the smaller menu options as it’s obvious they go for quality of dishes rather than filling the menu with lots of items.

Both of our cocktails were equally delicious - beware some pack some strength!

To round off a lovely meal the manager joined us for a round of shots along with a birthday card from the team to celebrate the 30th in style. If we ever come back to Singapore again we will 1000% be visiting."
Pre mixed drinks?!,"Caffe Fernet, Custom House: It has been years since I have been here and we came for the strategic spectacular view of the Marina Bay Sands - almost perfectly framed for you, for the evening. The cafe - bar or restaurant more befitting - is such a goodlooker, the best bit is the well-lit up mammoth bar. However, services is a let down. We were here for drinks but letdown we further we. Christmas selections sounded good on paper but were not merry when we were told they were pre-mixed. What? You have a lovely big bar, a large selection, bartenders and with the price tag attached - they are pre-mixed? I thin Caffe Fernet has lost its lustre. Tourist trap it has become but regulars you might not fetch. #eatstylishtravelstylish"
Frequent visitors - this is a favourite!,"As always, we had a fabulous time at Caffe Fernet. It’s still a firm favourite! We try to visit every month or two. Staff were friendly, attentive and helpful, accommodating our big pram and 4 adults - with different requests! Food was tasty and arrived quickly and drink dejection is vast. Great happy hour prices on a few beverages too, from open til 6.30pm. Obviously the views and location are unbeatable too. Can’t wait to return again!"
Stunning food with a stunning food,Succinct menu with amazing pasta and drinks. Service is always on point with a great view and atmosphere. Great place to bring visitors too.
Busy Yet Relaxing,"This restaurant is located at a spot that looks out to the bay, with MBS in the background. It is at once scenic and tranquil. I dined on a Friday evening and as you can imagine, the restaurant was pretty busy. I was given their full attention, though I was a lone diner.

I asked for recommendations and was given them accordingly, so my order was the focaccia as a starter followed with the pasta. Both dishes were well cooked. Dessert was the strawberry shortcake, a pretty decent sized one.

It is a nice place to meet and catch up with friends and family, if you do not mind the buzz around you."
"Awesome food, service and view.","Awesome food with awesome service. Cocktails could’ve had a little more depth for the price tag. That said, dishes I had were great and the truffle ricotta was outstanding. Front of the house was very accommodating when we were late for our reservation and our server Sheryl was attentive, cheery and helpful. Her friendly vibes really bring the birthday celebration and dining experience here to another level. Thank you!"
Never going back.,"Arrived at 8pm. Waited over 1hour for our mains that never came. Chased after 30min, waitress said otw. At 915pm, asked again and told order wasn’t in kitchen. They misplaced it. Horrible Experience."
Nice food but….,"The food (pasta with cacio and noci) is good and the 30 month old Parma ham delicious. Good service
However
For your sanity and wallet sake, DO NOT order the mocktails. I’ve ordered three (Red Garden, Melati Martini and Yuzu lemonade) and I could not distinguish them from my toothpaste. Absolutely awful and 54$ in the drain"
Good spot for drinks with a view,"Beautiful ambiance, food is ok although the salmon was too salty. Drinks are decent and the view is amazing if your looking for a restaurant with a view of marina bay."
"Go for the view if you need, not the food",Nothing in particular stood out from our dinner last night. Very heavy handed on the octopus dish and pasta. Ricotta dish is pretty 1 dimensional too. We enjoyed the service and the view though. Food wise - flat and nothing memorable. Cocktails were good. Total bill was $200. Will not return.
Unpleasant Service / stressful experience,"Date 5Mar / time : 1615

Found Cafee Fernet by chance because an overseas friend stayed hotel cross the road. Manager in Charge was the first person standing at the reception stand doesn’t give an impression he is keen to take in business as it’s kind packed that that time .

My turn - The Manager asked his service staff to take me to an outdoor table by the bay which is ok for me.

Before I can settle down on my bar stool, Service Staff Yaz H took my glass of wine order quickly. Within a min he served my glass of wine. As it’s so humid at that time of day, before I wipe my sweat off and slip my wine , a bill was flashing in front of me to pay. Told him I still waiting for my friend to arrive and order before we pay together, but can’t do that. So I paid for my glass of wine.
Came back with my receipts, He Yaz told me this outdoor table can only allow me to stay for an hour . My question to the manager and his team why wasn’t this spelled out to me just before they took my order? No choice as I have paid and my wine already in front of me and my friend already on his way to caffe Fernet.

Couple of mins later sky turned dark and looks like it’s going to rain any moment and table beside me also leaving which left me only table outdoor. Yaz came back to me telling me if I haven’t booked any table inside it’s full and can’t accommodate me so I have to leave.

Seriously!!!!!! I was so nervous and hoping that it won’t rain before my friend arrive , otherwise my friend and I will be stuck in an awful situation supposedly to give him a good impression of this magnificent view by the bay. I asked Yaz to seek help from his manager. To my Disappointment the manager don’t event come to me at all and all he did was asking Yaz conveyed his message that if I want a table inside, we take the chance and if the guest come I have to leave. Honestly ! I don’t think I deserved this treatment by the team as I am a second class citizen begging to stay at caffe fernet and it’s so stressful to hang out like this manner on my sat afternoon drink.

Told the incident to my friend that we have to leave soon as of weather and limited time for the table. Not wanting to disappoint my friend coming all the way and leave w/o anything , we took another chance ordered another glass of wine which we finished within 10mins .

Time like now , especially in F&B / service industry, we need to beef up our service team leading them to service excellent mindset. But to me cafee fernet and his team working on 5March really need to rethink on their approach in service their guests."
Birthday meal,"The staff could not have been more lovely and accommodating. The food was delicious - especially the soft shell crab, mussels and the octopus. They even made me a birthday card!"
Inflexible hosting practice,"Service is okay with Aida but management is inflexible. We came in at 3.30pm but we were reminded many times on time pressure. Last resort was at 5.30pm, the restaurant was 90% empty and they reminded us to leave by 6pm despite spending Almost $300 within 3.5 hrs…. On a Sunday evening"
Caffe Fernet,Fantastic service and view. Food was okay only for the price point but you're paying for the scenery in my opinion.
Excellent Service,I celebrated my anniversary with my Fiancé there and it was the most memorable anniversary I had. They were very attentive to our needs. We were pleasantly surprise when the restaurant went out of their way to prepare a cake for us. We were touched by their gesture and sure to visit again next year:) Thank you Caffe Fernet.
Fantastic experience at Caffè fernet,"Fantastic experience at Caffè Fernet. Quality of food & drinks were amazing, view was exceptional & service was impeccable (thanks Kim). We had a polaroid of the birthday celebration with a note written by the staff. Thank u !"
Great views with excellent service,"An absolute must visit place that has unparalleled views coupled with beautifully served food, some great cocktails and excellent service. Have been here twice in the last couple of months and both times have had memorable experiences!"
Cafe Fernet Is Awesome,"Food was great, service was awesome. The crew was very attentive to our needs. Loved the Whipped Ricotta!"
15th wedding anniversary,Great food. Service staffs are very friendly. Staff CK provided excellent service. He gave good recommendations as it's our first time there. Hope to be there again.
Highly Recommended~!,"Staff at Caffe Fernet are extremely friendly. Staff will also politely check in with customers if they needed anything. Very prompt in their service. Food is also amazing, heard the menu changes once every 3-4 months. This is a nice concept. Would highly recommend this place as food is good, nice view and friendly staff. Thank you for the amazing experience."
Good food with good view,"The food was nice. Staff are friendly and helpful too. Would recommend to come around 5.30pm or 6pm, so you get to enjoy the sceneries."
very friendly staff with good view,"service staff was friendly view is wonderful food was decent, though a little pricy good place to dine"
Excellent find,"The restaurant was an excellent find. We were thinking to go out for dinner, and this was one of the places recommended for outdoor dining. The view is really nice, the food is also delicious. Prices are slightly on the higher end, but the taste and flavour more than makes up for it. The staff are very friendly and polite, and they do go the extra mile to ensure that you are comfortable. They are also very understanding and are conscious about the safe distancing measures, which leaves patrons with a peace of mind when dining in. All in all, I would recommend this restaurant, and we look forward to going back on a sunny day!"
A perfect night out,"Waiters (especially Tyler) were so lovely and helpful, they gave us a table right next to the water which was absolutely perfect. Food was timely and amazingly delicious, I will be back!"
Dine in,"The truffle bread with ricotta was the BEST!!!! A MUST TO TRY if you visit for the first time!! However, the cacio pepe noodle although was suppose to be the famous dish but it doesnt appeal to me. It just taste like cheesy carbonara"
Excellent service !,We were pleasantly surprised by the food! The octopus was tender and well balanced with a creamy froth on top (goat cheese?). We also liked the pork chop with the nice condiment on top. What impressed us most was the service! I forgot the waiters name but he went above his duty and got us an umbrella to walk to the taxi stand. Thank you !
Experience at Caffee Fernet,Friendly staff and they are well train on menu and provide good recommendation. The view was great overlook the Marina Bay Sands if not after the rain should be able to view the sunset. Nice place for business and casual catch up with friends and family. The quality of foods are great! Thanks for friend recommending this place.
"Nice venue, fabulous views, awesome cocktails & food","We enjoy Caffe Fernet for its views, with the spectacular MBS in front. We always come back for the cocktails and the yummy food. Truly a great experience!"
Excellent experience,"We picked Cafe Fernet for our anniversary. The atmosphere, the view, the service and the good obviously were amazing. We even got a nicely decorated ‚anniversary desert‘! Thank you so much Team Café Fernet!"
"Great Food, Excellent Service",The waterfront view and food at the restaurant was great. (Although a little warm in Singapore weather! LOL) The portions were a good size. Kudos to the staff for their excellent service! Fantastic.
"Incredible service, great atmosphere, good food.",I was very impressed by the level of service. The view is incredible and the food is worth coming back for.
Limited options,"Dined for lunch with friends, such an amazing location I guess we had higher expectations. The service was actually good, reading other reviews about service, I can say that the staff were attentive and friendly.

The surprise we did have though was the limited menu, if you want to share some dishes/platters, we did this to start, however to then have our own mains, there was a choice of around 6 dishes and all very different and heavy with a Four Cheese pasta, pork sausage spicy vodka pasta, Lamb shank, Seabass with Trout cavier, Jumbo lump crab as the main options, all very out there and not what any of us liked or would choose to order.

We had been before so perhaps the menu has changed, I am sure some people would like these creative and different dishes, however there was a lack of some simple Italian options.

We ended up leaving and eating next door. It was a shame as the location is superb."
Good food to go with cocktails,Always enjoyed my time at caffe Fernet... would love my time there more if happy hour for the cocktails can be extended :)
Bad service.,"Food was good. However the service was really bad, we are aware of the 2 hrs dining timing yet we are pushed to leave as soon as we finished our meal. Made a booking at 7pm den finish our meal at ard 810pm and was pushed for bill.. first time we ask to hold on as our drinks were not finished.. then 5 mins later the waiter came again to push for bill."
Good ambience follow by nice food.,Location in the city central. Service and food is good. Nice view and ambience. Facing directly toward MBS. Good area for photo taking.
"Amazing food, excellent service","The service crew are friendly and helpful! The food is amazing, beyond my expectation! Especially the Housemade Riccota, refreshing taste, perfect as a starter. Mains like Pompano Piccata and Cacio E Pepe serve in adequate portion with rich taste."
Cafe Fernet Made Our Day,"We were a group of 5 ladies celebrating a Hens night. Right from the start, all the staff was extremely welcoming and attentive. Everyone was warm and they really looked after us. The food was delicious (our favourites are beef tartare, lamb shank and the fish dish (next level!)). They also threw in a couple surprises and helped us took really nice photos. The bride to be and her entourage had an amazing time despite the gloomy weather, thank you Cafe Fernet!"
Perfect Pompano Piccata,"We had a wonderful wedding anniversary experience here on Saturday evening. The staff were super welcoming and alert to our every need. Stand out dish was the Pompano Piccata - delicious. A combination of the fantastic location, great staff and delicious food can't be beaten."
"Good food, great views & friendly service","While the noise level might be a little high, the food, views, ambience and service makes up for it. All the staff were busy covering the floor but attentive & friendly. Fit, in particular, made the meal and night more enjoyable through her checking that everything was good with recommendations and explanation of the food. Our starters and mains were excellent with each dish offering a twist on flavours. Desserts while were good, didn't have that extra unexpected punch seen in the starters & mains, That said, it was a magical evening with views of MBS coupled with attentive but unobtrusive service. Highly recommended"
Good ambience but service need to be imroved,"Went there with five other friends, and we were given a high narrow table (which was difficult when you have to share dishes, and with our drinks). Asked the manager but couldn't accommodate us to a better table. Some of the wait staff were great, except for one: (a) one staff was rude, took out one dish while i was still eating, and reasoned back at me!

otherwise, food was great (especially the pasta), drinks were good!!

improve on your service please :)"
Good vibe,"This place is great for fiends, couples, first dates and work meetings. Its in a brilliant location with seating inside or out depending on your preference (or the weather) with a wonderful view of the marina and the iconic MBS.

Friendly staff with a good drinks and food selection."
Amazing food and service,"We went here for lunch on a rainy Saturday and we were impressed. First of all with the friendly and fast service! They were very considerate of my pregnant wife and made sure we did not order anything that would be bad for her. The food was very good, portions don’t look very big but they are very filling. Overall very good experience! We will come back"
Great space for a chill night out!,"Overall, it was a great dining experience - food, vibes, view. The floor staff (even the PT staff FQ who served us) were professional yet casual/friendly/fun and I really appreciated it. So far I have not been disappointed by any of the establishments under Jigger & Pony. Would definitely come back again."
Celebrate birthday,"Good view, good atmosphere, good food and good service. We have a birthday celebration and it come with complimentary birthday cake . The staff was kind enough to check and serve the cake when we finish our foods and clear our table to lets us have the birthday celebration."
Expected more,Food was good but everything else could be improved on. Not a conducive environment for conversation. It was also really hot where we were seated and staff only switched on the air conditioning at closing for some reason.
"Better options around, unfriendly staff","Service was rude. So hard to find a waiter to take your order. Indicated as special request to be outside and they gave us the worst sitting inside. My friend also said there were ants around her seat. Honestly don't bother coming here, there are better options available nearby"
Great Dining venue !,"Enjoyed the ambiance, great food and excellent location! Probably you could have given us slightly bigger table for 8 of us!"
"Solid view and ambience, decent food","Atmosphere and ambience was on point - more so for the outdoors seating than the indoors. Luckily we did get an outdoor table. Waterfront view was great and could see the skyline - come before sunset so the light is nicer!
Food was solid but not spectacular. Drinks were decent as well."
Nice place with a view,"Offers a variety of small and bigger dishes , in combination with nice cocktails and other drinks. The view on the marina is awsome!"
Average,"The seating are cramp for big group. The food came late, not sure if they are under staff or overlooked the order."
Great Ambience but average everything else,"Go for the Ambience & overall atmosphere. Seems like a place to have a drink or 2... but a meal.. not so sure!! Limited menu which would also be ok if it were great! 3 Desert choices & those too, really bad!"
Food was lovely,"We went there for a dinner birthday celebration. The food was good especially the fish dish, Pompano Piccata. It was unfortunate that it rained heavily so we have to be seated in a sheltered area outside the restaurant. The view was still good with MBS right in front of us."
Wonderful Experience,"Wonderful memories and fantastic experience @ Cafe Fernet. Excellent service, nice ambiance with great food. Celebrated our 28th Wedding anniversary and were surprised with personalized free gift. They went the extra mile to give us a wonderful experience."
Excellent,Excellent food n good atmosphere nice location ! V can come with family ! Good service ! V can refer our friend ! Njoyed a lot !
Very poor service,"We arrived early at 1145am before the cafe opened. Sat outside as we waited. When the doors were opened, no one told us to come in. We only knew the cafe was open when we walked towards the entrance. When we walked in, the Indian guy didn’t look at us. Staff don’t seem to be ready to serve customers. Why open when you are not ready? We asked to sit outside and were told that outdoor sitting only opens at 3pm. We were seated inside. Waited for the menu to be given to us. Asked for the menu and were told to scan the tiny code on the bar. This cafe doesn’t provide any service at all. We were there on 30 Dec and the menu stated Christmas menu 21-27 Dec!! The staff didn’t even know what was gong on. You have to ask them for everything. After CB you expect the staff to be hungry for their jobs but no. The service was so poor. Staff are so laid back. Wake up Caffe Fernet!"
"Great view, nice ambiance","Good service and great view but the food was OK, not delicious. The cocktails was too expensive if it's not during happy hour otherwise it was delicious."
Came here on Boxing Day with,Came here on Boxing Day with colleagues it was crowded and I love the view it was awesome we were arrange a very good seat. The food was very unique and nice service was great too the drink I had can’t remember the name was refreshing it only had a little of alcohol in it. The food was a little pricey but for the view will definitely visit again.
Audrey is great! Will be back.,"Food is good. Nice big portions. Nice vibes. Happy hour helped :) also, Audrey is very friendly and genuine. Great service! You should promote her and give her a big incentive lol."
Ideal place for a date or family gathering,The restaurant gave us a table close to the water as requested. Food was excellent. A bit noisy though when all the glass doors are closed.
Amazing Food and View,Amazing Food + View = Awesome time. We enjoyed the calmness of the nearby sea while we (3 of us ordered) enjoyed the ink squid pasta paired it with sourdough bread and coffee.
Nice chill out with a great view.,Awesome place to spend the afternoon with a great view. Food is superb and really good cocktail mix. Not forgetting it’s wonderful staff for being so attentive and so good at the food recommendation.
Great food and service,"Great food, wines and service. Pity for the 2 hour limit but was understandable due to the rain not being able to use terrace. Always consistent in quality"
Fantastic cocktails 🍹,Don’t forget to make reservations before you come here!!! Nice view with great cocktails. Super service! You should try “APEROL SPRITZ”
Awesome,"Gorgeous view, friendly service, delicious spread, great range of cocktails & drinks.. we had a great night & lots of beautiful pictures"
Good but Time Limit on Reservation,Food and service were good but too much hassling regarding the maximum 2 hours allowed per reservation.
The Clock is Ticking,"From the minute you arrive you will be reminded that your reservation is limited to 2 hours maximum, and asked frequently if you are nearly finished. Don’t go here if your aim is to relax."
Superb service,I go here regularly and I receive some of the best service consistently no matter who serves me and my guests.
Excellent services,Celebrate friends birthday at Caffe Fernet. Nice View and the food and cocktails were so good. Me and my friends enjoyed the drinks made by the barman. Excellent services by the floor staffs too! Really enjoy the night.
great food,Love the food and the ambience :) didnt know there was a 2.5 hour eating time and were chased out. No flexibility in having sofa seats either. One of the waitress was really good!
"Great view, friendly service and tasty food","Prices can be quite steep but for the view and the chill out ambience, it is worth trying. The location is perfect- Facing the waterfront, full view of marina bay sands and the new apple store. Staff members are friendly and willing to explain what goes into the food. Happy hour ends at 7pm"
"Great scallops, good cocktails and unbeatable view!",The scallop and octopus dishes were incredible with that view! We got seats right at the bay and had a beautiful afternoon lunch.
View of splendour. Impressive food.,"Was listed as one of the most romantic cafe to hang out in Singapore. Managed to get a booking over the National Day weekend and they came up with a National Day menu. Ordered the pasta and roasted chicken on the menu, was impressed by the roasted chicken particularly. Tender soft meat with the chicken skin roast to crisp. Ambience is good with the lighting and the music in the background as we await the fireworks in the far distance. Splendid view of Marina Bay Sands and the water body."
"Amazing food, superb view and excellent service","Visited for dinner with friends, one of them, Italian. View is amazing, service is top notch, food is delicious and of great quality. The chef even came to our table to greet us. My Italian friend was the person recommending this place as she said this is one of her favorite places in Singapore. Everything is fresh and to die for. Will definitely come back. We ordered food to share and the portions are more on the generous side. This restaurant is a gem, do visit them and you won’t regret!"
Amazing view and great value for HH drinks,"This is place is the best for Singapore views, ambience and drinks! We had a table reserved at 5pm since we wanted to catch the daylight and the evening vibe (I mention to them that we would like to sit outside and have one of those high tables and they listened- reservation made through chope). They let us know as soon as we arrived that the turnover time for our table was until 7:30 pm. We were in time to catch their happy hour (until 7 pm) so we ordered a pitcher of Aperol Spritz (60$) and ordered some snacks like Saffron Arancini, potatoes (with rosemary and parmesan i think) and some sourdough bread with whipped lardo. The food was really good. The potatoes were average (maybe I wouldn’t bother to order them again). They don't have a very extensive food menu. We ended up ordering few more glasses of drinks (wine & prosecco) from their happy hour menu (13$ each). So we weren’t hungry enough for dinner so we skipped that.
The service is really good and the vibe of the place was really amazing!! Overall I’d come back here for drinks and a good time with a bunch of friends or even a date"
Great food with a view,"Came early on a Sunday and was greeted by a cheerful and engaging manager. Food we selected all tasted good eg. Veal meatballs, Tiramsu, perppercorn pasta. o note that the menu choices are not too extensive for food. Would definitely come back again."
Nice view but average food,"We visited there on Sat lunch and ordered octopus with hummus, the octopus was not tasty hummus lack of taste either..we read the review pasta was very good so our expectation was high; however we enjoyed more on the beef meatballs - tasty and size was big.
The house red and the cocktail was average."
Good,Nice place and food was decent but they should update the menu on their website as the website states that happy hour ends at 7.30pm. they have changed it to 7pm and we were taken by surprise
Still A Favourite After All These Years!,"My friends and I came here to celebrate a birthday because of of the good food, great view and happy hour specials. The menu is constantly being updated to keep flavours fresh and new. I'm a big fan of the Jigger and Pony group and Caffe Fernet is one of my all-time favourite spots to unwind after work."
Unacceptable behaviour of the manager,"My husband and I celebrated international women's day in this cafe. We liked the ordered drinks, I drank a cocktail Aperol Spritz, which by the way comes in happy hours for 10 with$. We also liked the food, we ordered tuna tartare, steak tartare and veal Parmigiana. But, due to the situation with coronavirus, the staff took contact details in case of an emergency. When we arrived at the house, the cafe Manager started calling us and saying that we did not pay the bill, although we reasonably paid the bill with a credit card and told the Manager about it. The Manager promised to check everything again. 30 minutes later, he called again and asked to come and pay the bill. To which my husband already in a rather rude form replied that everything is paid for. In General, we got 5 calls!!! on a holiday evening. Yesterday we received a credit card statement where we saw the payment made. But the Manager of the cafe did not call and did not apologize for the inconvenience caused, for the holiday evening spoiled by Intrusive calls. That's why the rating is so low. We really liked this cafe, but because of the unacceptable behavior of the staff, we will never come here again."
Exorbitant corkage!,We brought our own wine only to be told that the corkage charge was $70.... really!!! Food was good as was the service and ambiance. Fairly quiet for a Saturday evening. The virus is scarring many from venturing out to the cafes.
Good food and ambience!,"I really love the ambience here as it oversees the Marina Bay skyline, directly facing MBS. The food is delicious too, and being a small eater I love that they provide small servings (like tapas), also good for sharing. Of course, the taste matches if not exceeds my expectation too. The staff also helped me surprise my friend with a birthday dessert which tasted really awesome as well!"
Happy Hour with a View,"Had some time to kill in the vicinity - chanced upon Caffe Fernet's happy hour & decided why not. Predictably, the King Cole Old Fashioned ($15++) spoke to me. Bulleit Bourbon, Fernet Branca liqueur, Angostura Bitters. Totally up my alley!

Service is quick & by golly, this drink is a stiff one. I like that, because at the end of it all, I don't find it too diluted & meh. Holds its weight throughout.

I happily sipped on it & thought about life as I took in the nice view of MBS, having been allocated an al fresco seat facing the waters. I was here in the evening, towards the later half of Happy Hour (3 - 7:30PM). I'd imagine that the sun would be quite in your face had I been here earlier in the day... So try to sit indoors during lunch time.

Quite a boisterous crowd on Thursday evening. I will be back & perhaps the next time I'll order off their dinner menu. I have my eye on some pastas...

Accepts credit cards
Indoor seats available (not air-conditioned)
☀ Al fresco seats available
Accepts reservations - I used Chope
Free WiFi available
Water is not chargeable"
Lunch,"Food was good and service was attentive. Only thing is that the music is very loud during office lunch times so not great for business lunches, and the fan speeds are too high really blowing uncomfortable speed winds. adjusting these two will greatly improve the ambience."
Deliciòus and fab location,"Super friendly staff and a great lunch time menu at reasonable prices especially the fixed price menu and with amazing views to MBS. From the point we were greeted at the door to the really friendly and helpful waiter who gave us a fantastically positioned table with views to die for everything was perfect for a lovely lunch spot. Gorgeous iced cappuccinos, delicious toasted sourdough topped with ricotta, drizzle of honey, toasted pine nuts and heritage tomatoes, followed by a very generous chicken parmigiana sandwich - just what we wanted. A very enjoyable lunch and would not hesitate to recommend this buzzy and friendly cafe/bistro and would definitely have returned for evening dinner if we had more time in our trip to Singapore."
Great lunch spot,"Service is always friendly it's a great lunch spot, the food was delicious, and you can’t beat the prix fixe menu"
Evening Date,"We were greeted nicely apon arrival and shown to our table which was located outdoor. The view of marina bay sands across the water was amazing. The food was great, we ordered some meat and pasta. The cooktail was amazing. I would reccomend the restaurant for a good dinner with a view."
"Good food and service, if a little muddled",Food and service are always good at Caffe Fernet - they didn't rush us through service. However they forgot one of our orders.
The barman doesn't know his job !,"Went there for an aperitivo with a friend . Have to say the location is very nice but what you have as a customer is far away from any acceptable standard. I personally ordered an Aperol Spritz and, as an Italian , I know exactly the way you should prepare it. Well , the result was unacceptable , with the dink served in a very small glass (not the one you should use for the Spritz) , the glass was full of ice cubes (yes so the bar save money on the liquid ....ice is so cheap right ?) ,the glass was really HALF EMPTY , there was any slice of orange in the glass (yes , it is required...). I complained with the waiter (she seems to understand) and she took my half empty glass back to the barman and it came back to me still half empty . And , have to tell you , the price here are very high and for what you pay you MUST deserve more . As my Spritz was such a bad idea , for the next round I ordered a Gin Tonic , well forget about that too ! Definitely the barman doesn't know his job !"
GREAT RESTAURANT,"A great place to have some delicious food with a view of the marina. We tried their Arancini, Sour dough bread, Golden beetroot and Spicy Bombolotti Vodka (vegetarian).
The service was excellent and the ambiance was very nice. A great place to go for a nice evening in Singapore."
Great location and views,"We were there for an after dinner drink. Enjoyed sitting out on the terrace looking out towards Marina Bay Sands and the evening light show. Despite not having any Bailey’s on hand, we managed to find other drinks."
Book ahead to enjoy the best views. Be prepared for added charges,"We wandered in off the street and were seated very promptly in the bar area. Unfortunately our backs were to the view, but all the other tables were full so can't really complain. Caffe Fernet is right on the bay near the Fullerton Hotel. The ambience is excellent and the food reasonable if you choose from the lunch specials. We had Set lunch 2 courses, at S$36 per head (don't forget the service charge at 10% and the GST added on top of that, so the total came to S$84.75

Our choices were Meatballs, Grilled skirt steak sandwich, tuna tartare and Porchetta. Everything was delicious and quite enough for lunch. We just stayed with the iced water so didn't buy drinks. Service is very good and for a one-off holiday experience just looking at the bar and people watching, we had fun."
"Al dente yes, but undercooked no!","Nice setting, but pasta not really cooked to perfection and somewhat cold. Can improve by putting a real Italian cook in the kitchen. Just the name is not sufficient."
Great venue for drinks and views,"The first time I came was with my parents on a weekday afternoon for dessert and coffee. It was my dad's birthday and we wanted to have a little sweet end after lunch in the area. We opted for the Tiramisu but were sorely disappointed. It was dry, it lacked flavour, and the cream in it wasn't fluffy. We weren't impressed with this first visit.

On my second visit with friends, we came for drinks post-dinner on a weekend. We were given a table immediately, which had a great view. I had a G&T and my friends and I shared a slice of their Carrot Cake. This was surprisingly good! Given that the last time I came for dessert it was a flop, my expectations were not high. But this Carrot Cake was rather yummy. It was well spiced, not overly sweet, and the cream was served on the side rather than as layers in the cake. A much better experience the second time around!

Would definitely come back for drinks, as it's a nice ambiance and the views really are romantic."
Good venue for dinner with friends,Great view over the bay. Pasta was really good (especially the nduja one). Not cheap but very reasonable considering the location and view. Good staff who are attentive.
Great restaurant!,"Caffe Fernet is the perfect place in Singapore if you want great Italian food, great drinks and the quintessential Singapore view!"
Dinner and a light show,"Had dinner here on our first night in Singapore. Caught the light show which started at 8pm. The service is impeccable and super attentive A+++ The menu Italian inspired but is not huge. There is pastas and snacks, a steak, snitzel and chicken for main. It’s not really cheap but the view and service is fantastic"
Smart Casual and Breezy,"An enjoyable end-of-week catch-up with close friends: it reminded us of being on holiday again. But Singapore has been home for 26 years! Smart, casual and breezy with classic view of the bay."
Nice find,"The F&B selection suits us. We tried the sea bass, duck confit, ratatouille and mushrooms, very tasty. Would have preferred wild mushrooms or chanterelle instead of the common button mushrooms though. Good place for dating"
Lovely lunch,"Had a lovely lunch with my good friends. The menu is quite limited but the portions are very huge. Overall, food is great."
