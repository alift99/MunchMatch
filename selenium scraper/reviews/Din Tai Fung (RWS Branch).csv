Yearning for the good old days of ordering food from a person,"The food was good, the staff were excellent, but the online ordering was a pain (slow internet speed that crashed when the large order was placed necessitating a return to a paper based order after 30 minutes of hangry phone tapping). Oh for the good old days of ordering a feed from a person!"
Chicken and Rice,"A must try Chicken and Rice dish while in Singapore.
This is a very busy chicken and rice restaurant. We waited for a table. We tried 3 variations of the chicken and rice dishes each one delicious also tried the chilli crab dish also very nice.
These were the best chicken and rice dishes we tried while in Singapore. Lovely."
Excellent dim sum,"The right place if you're looking for high quality dim sum. The Xiao Long Bao tasted really good! Also, the fried shrimp slices were super tasty. Would definitely recommend it, bit pricey though."
Nice food but very noisy.,"Nice food but very noisy. Service is what you expect from a chain restaurant. High turnover model, generous size portions, easy meal. Not a place for a quiet discussion."
"Really good value for money, and tasty food","Super Clean Restaurant that has a nice seating area with a view of the kitchen. Courteous staff, mouth watering preparations and served in good time. The presentation is pleasing, rich taste and reasonable portions. In particular I liked the steamed dumplings, but saying that everything we ordered was really tasty, and worth trying."
Very nice lunch,"We had an amazing lunch here as a family from New Zealand. The kids wanted to try something like this and it didn't disappoint. Food was amazing.

It was also good to see the team making the dumplings as we entered.

We would highly recommend coming here!"
Delicious Dumplings,Nice chinese restaurant that served delicious dumpling. The soup and fried rice is also good. A little pricey.
Excellent Service,Very good Service and Good Quality Food. The Staff there are giving us very good service and care as I brought my dad and mom who were already 80 over years old.
Never expect less for this chain,"Going there with expectation of great food and they did not fail to deliver as to many of their chain. Service is spot on and quick, although rather pricey but considering location so it is reasonable"
Super cuisine in Super Clean Restaurant,"Restaurant has a nice seating area with a view of the kitchen. Courteous staff, mouth watering preparations and served in good time. The presentation is pleasing, rich taste and reasonable portions. In particular I liked the steamed dumplings : Juicy, mild aroma and tasty."
Good xiao long bao,"My kids loved the xiao long bao din tai fung. We usually will drive into sentosa if the kids are crying out for them. Walk from the car park can be rather long during the weekends. The queue at the restaurants as well. Do visit early.

Food quality is definitely good and taste even better. Fresh ingredients used for their dishes."
Birthday celebration with family,My kids love the Fried rice and noodles here. The Xiao Ling Bao is a must for them. It’s simply delicious!
"Good food, less good service and high prices","This restaurant is part of a chain, but does really excellent steamed bao and dim sum. The dishes arrive as and when prepared - tapas-style. So be prepared to get your meal in stages. The management really should explain this system in advance, on their menus, as it can otherwise lead to unnecessary angst!"
Worst restaurant in sentosa,"Hi I visited your restaurant last april 17 around 9-9:15pm in the resorts world sentosa branch.

The following things happened after my visit
1) I ordered 5 dishes since we were family of 5 members
2) we requested for a glass of water for each member
3) the waiter served 4 dishes and extremely delayed the 5th dish ( pork fried rice)
4) I followed up my 5th dish mutliple times and all i heard was please wait.
4) Finally because 4 of my family members were done eating and my 5th dish had not yet arrived, I requested the waiter to simply cancel it since the 4 dishes were mediocre and taste was pedestrian at best.
5) The waiters refused to cancel my 5th dish and it basically arrived with my bill. The waiter even flashed a sad face like he was going to get in trouble for the cancelled dish.
6) my 5th dish arrived cold and the taste was not worth the price or the wait I had to be subjected to.
7) I finally just had the food packed for take away and I gave it to a beggar because it was not served on time or as per my expectation. Plus the delay caused me to get agitated and it boiled towards my spouse thanks to the sad face that your waiters were showing.
8) we were charged a rediculous bill of $75SGD with service and government taxes for what i consider is bad service. We were even billed for our glasses of water.
9) we never got an apology for the unsavory experience. I had to restrain myself because of my family.
10) I work for a food magazine and I will make sure that I insert an article about the worst restaurant in Sentosa which is obviously your restaurant.

I demand a proper apology in writing

Food is delicious but table service average,"Commendation to the employee who controls the number, making sure people behind us does not jump the queue. The food was great but the floor manager was not meticulous enough compared to the original Din Tai Fung in Taiwan. We felt hot and thirsty and would like to add drinking water to our menu but she told us that adding order would need to wait, in the end, she just passed the ordering to another waiter, who has understood our requests well. After I have finished my warm water, the same floor manager refilled my glass with cold water instead of asking me if I wanted warm or cold water. Other than that, we were very satisfied with the food."
Excellent food,The food was so good here!! We had a selection of dumplings and dim sum it was amazing. The best thing was a pork dumpling in a black vinegar and pepper broth we had a double batch of them.
Great dumplings,"A busy area near the Universal studios, but a good place.
No surprise there, the organisation, the service, the quality of the food, all was pretty good in the pure tradition of the Din Tai Fung branch.
A popular place, above all on a weekend.
Be prepared to queue up for 20 minutes."
Dumplings,"This was my first dim sum experience in Singapore so I don’t know if it’s normal- but I thought having to wait 40 minutes for dim sum was a bit absurd? We chose this place because I was expecting food to come out on trolleys and the kids could therefore eat quite quickly- I was so wrong!

The process here is you tick off food on a sheet of paper, hand this in to someone, and your food gets freshly made (I think) and comes out in dribs and drabs 40+ minutes later.

The food itself was divine. My kids said that was the best fried rice they ever had (but the serve was so small we had to order another). The soupy dumplings were a burst of flavour and my favourite was the crispy prawn cake.

Kids wise they quickly set the table up with plastic ware and they get a small cup of warm water. There are also high chairs. I wouldn’t recommend bringing a pram as space is quite limited.

Price wise it is rather expensive. Just a juice is around $8. We ordered 2 fried rice, 1 noodles, the dumplings, juice and 2 appetisers and that was already $80. Servings were not generous so we were still hungry after."
Chicken dumplings!,"We visited the restaurant around 4 p.m and it was packed. We waited for almost 40 minutes for our meal. However, the staff makes the process of seating, ordering and delivery very smooth. For our meal, we ordered chicken dumplings (delicious as they had a soup filling), morning glory (needed soy to add taste), prawn pancake (crispy and excellent) and sticky egg rice (again, needed soy to add flavor). Overall, a very busy place but a visit is recommended."
Fresh and tasty dumplings,Tried their xiao Long Bao and meat shrimp dumpling and enjoyed the taste of the dumplings. The soup in each made it very tasty. Just rather pricey to pay $80+ for dumplings and noodles/fried rice.
Best Dumplings Ever,This is a must if you go to Sentosa. The best dumplings I have ever eaten and their friend rice is amazing!
Yummy Simple Chinese Food,"It was really convenient to get to DTF because I was staying at Festive Hotel. The food was good however, I feel that different outlets vary in taste, so this might not be the best but not the worst as well. I feel that the ambience is slightly different than other DTF. This outlet has a more modern layout."
Unhappy visit,"Visited the restaurant end of July, feel a little disappointed as the staff is not friendly enough, I ask for children's dining set for my daughter of 3years old, maybe she doesn't look like her age, the China lady shows a little unhappy, said my daughter can use the normal dining set, we insist want the child's set, then she shows face. What I mean is, as this restaurant is located at Attraction spot, all staff should be more friendly but they failed to do so.... and food is so so only, very expensive too..."
Great Traditional Chinese Food,"I've been to many Chinese restaurants and this has been so far the best. The dumplings were really good and you could taste the freshness of the ingredients. Also the soups with the wantons were delicious.

And honestly the price of the food compared to the quality is superb. And great for families and even for couples."
Good experience and yummy food!,"We had our lunch on 4th March, sunday. Managed to get a seat in less than 10mins. Staff were friendly and helpful in getting the baby chair and fried rice order expedited for the kids. The rest of the orders took 20-30mins to come, but promptly came together. Staff were prompt in topping up the water for the kids and hot water for tea. Food portion was great, quality of food was good!"
Great Food,"The atmosphere was nice and quiet. The staff were very accommodating. We ordered soup dumplings (of course), dimsum, and their pasta with black bean sauce and mushrooms. The food was really good. Would definitely recommend it to my friends. The price was a bit more expensive than other branches tho."
Fresh Dumplings,"We have many Chinese Restaurants in Australia and this restaurant was no better than our dumpling restaurants, maybe I was expecting more and it was a little expensive."
Snobbish Service,"Food was ok, pricy end. But worst part is the service from the floor staff... not smiling. Unfriendly and kinda rude. Should improve on that!"
Late Lunch,"There was always long Q at every Branches of DTF, even though all outlets are big in space.
But lucky enough, we Q for only ten minutes before a table was secured.
We have to proceed to Universal Studios after the late lunch.
The floor managers and those serving the food were very friendly.
The speed of the serving of our food ordered was fine. We though that we would have to wait very long for the food.
There are new cold drinks (red dates and longans) available at this Branch; and I enjoyed very much.
We are not served with chinese tea from this Branch, compare to others outlets of theirs!
The menu are rather the same as compared to all other DTF in Singapore.
Could give it a try though!

Great food - of course its DTF!,Food as brilliant as ever... BUT the drink prices were extortionate.. $12SGD/AUD for a beer - OMG - event he water was ridic. Lucky we love the food so much - just waited to get a water from 7/11 after dinner!!
Great alternative to park food,Quick service and quality dumplings. Easy to step out of the park and get lunch instead of the normal park fare
Excellent Korean Cuisine,Been to Din Tai Fung in several cities and this restaurant in Sentosa is equally delicious. Expertly and freshly prepared food brought to our table in a very reasonable time considering how very busy it was.
"Good food, unfriendly service",The waitress was snobbish. Food arrived very late... food quality was good though. On the pricey end. No wifi available.
Great soup dumplings,"Best soup dumplings outside of shanghai, great food all round. Beer is a bit pricey at $14 fir a small tiger but food is worth it."
Great Dumplings,"The Dumplings her are really tasty , especially prawn and chicken and even the truffle buns. Even noodle soup is tasty. Even the Roselle drink is lovely, i drank 2 of them. Must visit."
Great Chinese food,The best place to go is you want some Chinese food! Highly recommended and suitable for the young and old. I recommend their fried rice and noodle.
Kids love the truffle buns !!!,"this is my first time try Din Tai Fung. good food! kids love the truffle buns, but its a bit pricy. But still good to have a try! recommend!"
Dumplings were disappointing,"We had been wanting to eat at the dumplings place all week and we finally did on our last day of our trip. The restaurant boasts ''world famous dumplings'' but I have to say, I have had better dumplings in Chinatown in Melbourne (Shanghai dumplings - check it out when in Melbourne).
We ordered a plate of prawn/pork wontons - these were so good. They came in a chicken broth and were just delicious. We ordered 3 steamed pork and veg buns, but like all streamed buns, they were very glutinous. Lastly we ordered the famous pork dumplings. They dough was very thin and was full of juice, while the pork portion was not much at all. The parcels were like deflated mini water balloons. I would not eat there again. The prices were reasonable being a restaurant on Sentosa, but when it came time to pay the bill, they gave me the choice of paying in AUD, which was great as I was paying on the credit card. However, without me realizing it, the bill was S$32.70 and they charged me AUD$32.68. So it wasn't converted it over, so that meal actually cost me more as the dollar conversion was $1.05. The meal should have been $31.15AUD. So that was a bit crap. The best tip would be, pay in SGD as they rip you off with their own personal currency conversion."
Delicious Taiwanese Dumplings!,"This is a great branch of this Taiwanese chain of dumpling restaurants. I loved everything I ate. The service is professional and the food is all made to order. Naturally dumplings of all forms are the great dishes, but do try the amazingly good fried rice.

Don't miss it!!"
Never Fails to live up to it's name!,"~my 2 boys always love a meal at Din Tai Fung and this Sentosa outing just before the March school holidays gave them a reason to drop in the RWS branch after closing at USS

everything we ordered is as flawless as it's always been at other branches and we had a great time getting in at 7.15pm without a queue on Friday

the service was especially fast and attentive at this hour!"
Decadent Chinese Cuisine at Resort World Sentosa,"We never tire of eating at the various Din Tai Fung outlets in Singapore.
This restaurant was packed, but thankfully we only waited 3 minutes for a table.
We particularly enjoy the fact that they always provide consistently good quality Chinese cuisine at decent prices.
For appetizers, we always enjoy their oriental salad and beancurd cubes with honey sauce.
We ordered their steamed pork dumplings (xiao long bao) with their signature exquisite 18 fold. These little pockets of succulent goodness are always appreciated.
Of filling and hearty taste is their pork chop paired with either fried rice or noodle soup. They go well with their chilli oil.
We also tried their crispy golden prawn pancake, which is very tasty and vanished into our tummies quickly.
A pot of Chinese tea is at SGD6.
We paid SGD146 for the 5 of us, with some leftovers for takeaway.
Their service is really efficient. Despite being hectic, the servers are generally friendly.
The fact that they weigh the individual portions of their oriental salad and shape them into a conical design, attest to their delivery of dishes, with an unwavering quality and steady standard.
Highly recommended for superb quality Chinese food at affordable prices."
Lower than average Din Tai Fung experience,"I've been to almost all of the Din Tai Fungs around the world. This particular branch however disappointed a little.

I've travelled to many oceanariums around the world but this is by far the most interesting and innovative aquarium.

Price
If I remembered correctly, the prices here are slightly above average than the other DTF restaurant you would find in the heartlands. But the price was still reasonable. Around $12-13 for a plate of fried rice.

Customer Service
The customer service here is good, DTF-style, just like the rest of the outlets where the service staff are attentive and courteous.

Food
This is the part where I am disappointed in. The taste of the food is meh, not sure if they have appropriated the taste for the tourists. I ordered Fried Rice with Pork Chop. The fried rice was slightly bland than the other outlets I've been to, and the pork chop disappointingly tasteless and hard. I have also noticed they have included a few Asian beverages such as iced green tea not normally sold in other DTF outlets, and they were very overpriced. A tip for diners would be to just order tea which is more worth it. If not, if you really want to try some Asian beverages, a nearby 7-11 store I believe on the same floor would sell a wider range at lower prices."
Love the food here!,"We went here for lunch and enjoyed the many varieties of dumplings, even the kids loved the food and can't stop talking about it. Very well priced as well."
Best Ambience; Great food and service as usual,"My family have visited several Din Tai Fung in Singapore and found this one has the best ambience. Great food and service as usual. My kids usually love western food but really like their Sliced Duck in Crispy Spring Onion Pastry, Xiao Long Bao and Egg Fried Rice."
"A staple, wherever you are!","LOCATION: superconvenient for people coming to Sentosa for the US, SEA Aquarium and the other tourists' attractions. We always decided not to eat inside the attractions' areas for food quality and price and, by only stepping out, we found definitely better options!

FACILITIES: kind on a small scale, so get ready to wait for a while. The second time we went there at 5.30pm and it was like a breeze. The first time we hit there 6.30pm....not the same kind of breeze. We had to wait 30+ minutes to get in and then other 15 to see some food coming. Waiters are nice but they are DEFINITELY in a hurry!

FOOD: honest and safe food. Xiao Long Bao are a must of course!

To sum up: Ding Tai Fung it's somehow what I would call a 'certainty'. When you don't know where to go, you don't feel that 'experiment' urge and you see a DTF around you....go there!"
Great food as usual,Their Xiao long bao are the best in Singapore. The standards has never dropped and is a must try as it's always hand made! Be sure to try out the Dan Dan noodles and pork chop fried rice!
no diff,"Seriously no diff from other DTF outlets, except this one comes with a Sentosa premium and likely flooded with winning and losing gamblers. Nice ambience to dine at, until the PRC diners 'attack' the dining hall with their loud voices. Beware."
Good dim sum,Great quailty dim sum served in family friendly restaurant. Had a great family lunch there. Kids liked to watch chefs at work in kitchen.
Xiao Long Bao is worth getting,Lots of varieties from their signature steamed pork dumplings to sauteed vegetables and steamed buns. Order one or two rice or noodle dish with one or two dumpling dishes.
Average,"I didn't see what all the fuss about this place was. They claim to have the best bao in town. It was good no doubt, but the other food wasn't as outstanding as people claim it to be."
Always make the effort to come here,"I had a quick transit stop in Singapore
And spent the afternoon at universal
Studios
This place is right by the entrance. I love being able
To watch the chefs at work
At the amazing skill of making the many types of dumplings on offer as well as other dishes. Very professional, hygenic and efficient.
You get an ordering sheet to
Choose from one to ten of any of the dumplings so it's
Great to be able to try many different types! I had a $5 pork
And truffle Dumpling which was awesome. As well
As all
My other choices. Definitely recommend finding this place on Sentosa Island"
Very good,"I really liked, and many local people eat there. We even have to wait some minutes but they manage to find place very fast."
Din Tai Fung is great,Din Tai Fung is a must do in Singapore. The food is excellent and it's not that expensive. The RWS branch is slightly more expensive because of the location and the menu is slightly different. Even so it that's the only chance to go to DTF you should do it! You can also get stamped out of Universal have lunch and go back. It's a much nicer lunch than what's inside.
Being an Indian and hardcore vegetarian..,"Avoid experimenting here, ask before you order coz there is so much more that showmen and fried rice in this world.."
Another great branch of Din Tai Fun,"Honestly, we've been to so many branches of Din Tai Fung and they really don't disappoint. We came here between the lunch/dinner crowd so we were seated straight away and our food did not take long. The food was excellent, as it usually is. We ordered three orders of xiaolong bao and two spicy beef noodle soups.
My only comment, and it's really not a complaint, is that they did not offer a bin to hold my purse and bags."
Food poisoning and hospitalised,"Four of us visited for lunch @ DTF Sentosa and of course had a range of dim sum and yes it was extremely tasty as it always is. Fortunately for the one person in our group who does not eat seafood...they avoided mega food poisoning. The other 3 of us ALL had extreme food poisoning to the point where my wife and I had to make a hospital call in the early hours of the night for treatment and medicine. I have since eaten at this chain in Melbourne without problems however on a recent trip to Singapore we tried the DTF at Marina Bay Sands (and waited for 1 hour for a table for 5-6...despite people coming after us and getting in earlier due to either smaller or bigger group size - that hurts, watching patrons arrive and walk in after we have been waiting 30,40, 50 mins etc) plus by the time we got in we were told we could not order anymore as the place was shutting and the bill was rudely forced upon us after we were still eating.

Note to management: Consider flexible table sizes that can be slotted next to each other and separated based on group size. (i.e. 3 x tables for 2 can easily be positioned to seat 6 instead of allowing 3 other couples in before the group of 6 waiting for ""a table for 6"").

Anyway, the one person in our group who had seafood dim sum got food poisoning! So my DTF days are now over and I suggest tread with caution with the seafood options, however as it is in the Casino, you may like to gamble."
Nice dim sum,"Dim sum are tasty. But the price is little bit expensive. You can eat better dim sum downtown. However, this restaurant is a good place to eat if you spend your day in Sentosa."
Nice dim sum,Visit here after spending a day in Sentosa. The name is well-known in Singapore so I had to wait for table arrangement and chose food during that time. The dim sum was as good as people told me. The beef noodle was very tasty however the dried noodle wasn't. Must try!
Waited for an hour,"I was rushing to go a movie gala, step in the restaurant at 5pm, ordered food. Prawn dumplings and my fren's pork chop noodle has came, but I waited for my pork meat rice dumpling for an hour. 6pm they served and I have to rush eating it.

The last time I had fried rice and ramen in another branch it was no good. This time around my friend want to eat this so I leave no choice.

Instead of xiao long bao, I thought I should give it a try of their steam prawn dumplings. Thick hard wrap and pathetic amount of meat inside.

Paying $7.50 for a pork rice dumpling, it is so small and only pork inside nothing else. Rice is soft, after waited for an hour $7.50 a dumpling from a Taiwanese restaurant there's nothing inside.

Very disappointed and not going there to eat anymore. In fact all branches in Singapore."
Not the best in this chain,"This restaurant is extremely busy, especially at dinner time. The wait wasn't too long for a table: we arrived at 6PM and was seated in 10 minutes. The service could be improved though: we were seated towards the back of the restaurant and it would take a while for anyone to acknowledge us. We didn't have a designated server: they seemed to just run around all over the place. The food was good, though they didn't have some of our favorites (not sure if they were sold out as they were crossed out on the menu). Because of the poor service, we likely won't be going back...there are plenty of other restaurants in the area."
Just like HK,I love the food at DTF! if you're a tourist in asia and you've never had dim sum...I mean real dim sum then get your self to DTF
Best Taiwanese dumplings going,"A chain it may be, but the made to order nature of the place, paired with its attention to quality and detail make DTF a regular stop for many Singaporeans (and us expats). The Xiao Long Bao are great, particularly aim for the pork parcels with shrimps balanced on top. And whilst the fried wantons aren't necessarily anything special, they're still some of my favourites."
Good but pricey La Mein & Xioa Long Bao,Food is good but pricier than same food served at other outlets of this chained restaurant over on the mainland Singapore. Service is also slow during dinner time.
Nice food,This restaurant have few brunch in Singapore and Malaysia. A very nice restaurant with very nice presentation of food. I like the xiaolong bao ! ^.^
FUN PLACE TO HAVE DIM SUN,This is a nice place to try dim sum they have wonderful selection of dishes to choose from.. Service was fast and friendly. The Place is clean and well taken care of.
High marks for consistency in food quality and freshness,"A reliable performer... of food quality, flavour and table service..notwithstanding the outlet in this eatery franchise. Not fine dining by any measure, but casual meals of premium quality..apparently, freshly cooked to order. Try the noodles, fried rice or the steamed delights..and enjoy..Definitely, recommended.."
Steamed Pork Dumplings,"We were told to try Din Tai Fung out before we left Australia, great food, ended up having dinner there 3 out of the 6 nights we stayed in Singapore. Service was good and pricing was good. The pork dumpling were great and would suggest the egg fried rice with the pork cutlet."
The answer to good Chinese dumplings,"No matter which outlet or country, taste and service are consistent and reliable. A great place to bring tourists for a first time meal. Not spicy and very tasteful."
"Serve with speedy, taste good","The taste for food here is nice and taste, serve within 10 minutes time after took the order. Overall for the food presentation and taste is excellent with cleanliness."
"Great dumplings, good noodles, good service.",Nice and spacious restaurant. Really excellent dumplings. We had the pork dumplings with black truffel - superb. Good noodles. Fast and good service.
The best dumplings in the world!,"We traveled to Singapore solely to have these dumplings for my husband's birthday. Although we had many other dishes the dumplings remain the stand out food. it is interesting to watch them make them through the windows and each one is perfectly crafted by hand. They have a delicious mouthful of broth in each one and are perfectly matched with the fresh ginger and a mix of soy and vinegar.
They are very reasonably priced and were the highlight of my day! Might have been cheaper to fly to Sydney to have them as they have opened a branch there, but not nearly as much fun!"
Great dumplings,"Very busy, very loud, but quick, tasty food. Would go again and the non stop Jasmine tea was a welcome."
Din tai feng,"Food is average but overcrowded n overprice. If you been to China, this is nothing. Guarantee.
If you never try before, can do so, but not in sentosa cos the place is always pack with people. Better to take McDonald especially need of time to enjoy."
Quickie dinner,"Had an early dinner here before we head back to hotel. For a quickie, we ordered some noodles & their signature dish Xiao Long Bao."
Great dumplings!,"Food was great, came out fairly quickly, this restaurant was always busy so we had to see what all the hype was about! Dumplings were lovely!"
Quite enjoyable,"The food was quite enjoyable, not brilliant but quite nice. The service was good and I would probably go there again in preference to other places around that area.
I had takeaway from there the night before and it (soup) was very nice. Just what I needed for takeaway."
Crowded but Good,"Place was bustling with people and the wait for a table could get incredibly long.
However, the food and service when you are in the restaurant makes up for the long waiting time. Try to visit during off peak hours, like non-meal times for some snacks and you wouldn't have to wait for so long."
Better than average fast food with no frills,"After a visit to the SEA aquarium we called in and ordered quite a selection of dishes.
All were delivered with an explanation and were very tasty and very good value.
We paid 140 dollars for a selection for four people and took easily one third home as we could not eat it all. Very good value
This restaurant did its job in providing tasty food quickly after an amazing day's visit to the aquarium"
cheapest michelin restaurant experience,"open kitchen, good value for money, great pork dumplings, spicy noddles are a musty try. gets very busy and waiting times can be tiring."
Best Dumpling,"Best dumpling place in Sentosa, you can also find it's branch in Singapore. All equally good. Besides dumpling, they also serve great fried rice and fried noodle."
"FOOD LOVER"" SHARKSFIN SIOMAI YUMYUMYUM","One of the best Chinese restaurant in Singapore! quite expensive but it's all worth it..from soup to main course you will love it for sure..the ambiance perfect for all,not that noisy the staff hmm kinda rugged,maybe because of the long queue.Well I don't mind that kind of personality what important to me is the food that I want to eat and the ambiance your paying for."
"Must try, even for vegetarian","Want fresh from the kitchen, dim sums with perfect flavour and texture, melting in your mouth - Think Din Tai Fung. The average wait of 25 minutes is worth every second. The food here is delicious, even for vegetarians. The restaurant staff is helpful and extremely hospitable. The restaurant is clean and well lit."
Late lunch,The staff there were not attentive. the staff also choose to attent to customers by their appearance as in what the customers are wearing. For those customers that were using branded good got attended first and those whom dress as a average person were attended last. Shouldn't it be first come first serve? The food that were served was cold as it has put at the waiting area for awhile
"Fast, efficient and good food","2 of us ordered 20 of their famous dumplings, an appetizer, a bowl of noodles and a shrimp fried rice. During peak dinner hour, we waited 5 mins to be seated(more people might need to wait longer, 2 of us is a lot easier), 10mins serving our dumplings and another 10mins to serve all other dishes. Food was good + fast and efficient service = happy customers. Tips - always get a running number to be seated before you enter the restaurant."
Average,"The food is very expensive, considering the portion is very very small. The taste is not as nice if compare to Malaysia Din Tai Fung, disappointed."
Many Better Options in Singapore,"This place was not relaxing at all. Thu rushed you in. Rush you to order. Rush you out. They charged you for everything including water and napkins. Food was average at best. If you are looking for those wonderful dumplings there are better options in Singapore that offer better food, better service, and better price..."
Must try steam dumplings,"The main highlight of this restaurant is their steam dumplings (xiao long bao). It is a dish not to be missed.

However, they do not take reservations and customers have to take a queue number and wait for their turns. Therefore it is best to be there slightly earlier than the usual lunch / dinner hours."
No value for money,"For the price of the food in this restaurant, you would expect something that might come close to leaving an impression. The flavours are ordinary. The presentation had no artistry. The service did not make you feel special. It felt like we were just one among the many eating there. And the waiter kept trying to sell us their special for the day when I already declined. It felt like I had to give a reason why I declined. Don't eat here unless you want to throw away your money to try it."
Very relaible,Went there towards the end of evening dining and they'd run out of a couple of things we wanted but still put together a very tasty set of things. Loved the mustard salad and the chilli crab and pork buns
Excellent dumplings,"We've visited Din Tai Fung quite a few times now, in Singapore and Sydney. The food is consistently good. The serving portions aren't large (more ""dainty""), but tastes great. My favourites are the xiao-loong-bao, beancurd with pork floss and century egg. Wholesome tastes that remind me of my upbringing delivered in a place that has a pleasant ambience. I visited for Monday lunch which wasn't particularly busy but have been told there are typically queues."
Delicious dumplings,"Just have to have it. A must when visiting Singapore.
Pork and chicken dumplings, fried rice with egg, Oriental wontons in chili sauce, chicken wings, sliced duck...dou miao....bring it all on! Lots of good taste. Lemongrass juice, watermelon juice...ice tea....ahhh.....lovely!
Personally I find the restaurants itself a bit ""cold"" - very bright light and noicy. However the food and drinks make up for it.
Will be back!"
Perfect !,"we had lunch twice at Din Tai Fung Branch during our stay in Singapore. Service may appear a bit shabby to ""occidental standards"" but the quality of food is exceptionnal and the overall experience just great. Dont leave Singapore without tasting their succulent dim sum !"
Singapore highlight,After 4 trips to Singapore I finally got to eat here . Why did I wait so long !! The flavour just keeps coming with every dish that comes out . Worth every cent.
ONe of the best Chinese Food,I love the Bao's Here .. filled with greens Chinese food is very authentic and yummy .... Good range of vegetarian options here one can try... Make sure to do reservation as it is always crowded and waiting upto 1-1.5 hours
YUMMY DIMSUMS!,I am not a fan of chinese foods but this food really made me want for more and more and more dimsums! The best dimsum I have tried so far:)
Not so great,"We had lunch here recently in between a visit to Universal Studios. Place was full so service was very slow. We ordered mostly dimsums intending to have a quick lunch. However, the xia long bao that we ordered took something like more than 30 minutes to arrive, while the rest of the dishaes came after around 20 minutes. The service staff seemed harried. We finished off our food quicky and got out right away. Suggest not to come here for lunch if one is in a hurry to go back tomthe theme park."
Great!,"Service was great. Ddin't wait long for seating and food. Though, it doesn't hurt for staff to greet you as they were quite robotic.:-)"
Perfect Rainy Day lunch,"My favorites are: Oriental Salad in Special Vinegar Dressing, Xiao Long Bao, Noodle with Minced Pork in Bean Sauce, baby bok choy with garlic"
A must go at RWS,"good place to go with young children, the xiao long bao and fried rice were very good. my friend's battery ran flat and they are very helpful to charge for her."
Better than best!,"On our last visit to Singapore, we dined in the Resort World Sentosa Branch of this restaurant chain and we were very, very impressed with the Xiao Long Bao, so we decided to give it a review though it quite months ago and things may already changed...
Ineed, we don't have any beautiful words to describe, but so far it is the best Xiao Long Bao we've ever had. And we definitely recommend for anyone to try this despite we may have to queue up over 30 mins or the service may very poor, according to recently reviews. However, The One Star Michelin awarded in 2009 and ranked among World’s Top Ten Best Restaurants by The New York Times in 1993 for Din Tai Fung, they were all happened for a reason!"
