Great and Awesome service of Marlou & Franz. We will surely comeback !,"My family & I (Mark) dine in last Jan 22, 2023 during dinner time. Marlou the bartender, was friendly and outstanding especially when it comes to prompt service and being so welcoming. Truly knowlegeable about his bar drinks while making great recommendations base on my family preferences. He does nice and creative drinks. He really stood up for the brand (Westin) Another staff named Franz was attentive too and he made good recommendations for food and drinks and he always assist us with our needs. Its our first time here and we really love the atmosphere and vibes. My kids like the buffalo wings tastiness, calamari & kids burger which has big portion and I personally like the happy hour promo and for that we will surely comeback and recommend the place among our friends & colleagues. Thank you."
Drinks at Cook and Brew with Franz!,"Drinks at cook&brew are really affordable because they have an almost perpetual happy hour!! (1130am-1130pm on Fridays) with really good bar snacks :) also had a really great server, Franz, who was very attentive to us and patient. Had a great time here and would highly recommend this place for relatively affordable cocktails!!"
Fun time with friends,"We went here last sunday with my friends, Reasonable prices specially for the happy hour selections,The food was good the service is great thanks to our waiter marlou and the team.We look forward to coming back again."
Amazing cocktails with a view,"Amazing service and friendly mixologist. The team at the Bar knows their stuff and we enjoyed the cocktails so much! The view is mesmerizing from where we were seated, will definitely come back again!"
Worst Bar Ever....,"Worst experience ever. How do you expect a family of 7 with kids to dine at the sofa seating with 1 small round table?

It just spolit my Xmas celebrations. No space to put our food and the whole experience is so bad. Everyone left disappointed on this night.

Service is bad and waiters are not alert to our table stack with empty plates. Do note the bar is not even full for the night."
A night to remember,"Food and drinks was good and prompt. We've been here a few times, we like the ambiance and food quality are consistent. But
I just want to highlight that i am a bit dissapointed with one staff, i approached him (like indian malay guy) but he just ignore me, and i keep looking at him but still he just used his phone like he didnt see us. And i am surprise with one guy who at the bar counter, he is the one who entertain us and he absolutely made our night special and lucky i got his name ""Marlou"". You will really know if the staff really love his job because on that day was so busy and we see him alone and we are wondering how he can handle all the orders but still can manage to entertain us and other guests and make us happy and satisfied on the service. Kudos to him and the rest of the staff who is tired but still can smile and give their best to serve with the customers."
Highly recommend!,"We had a great time with my fiance, ambiance and food was great. The service is superb big thanks to Marlou for the good service and cocktails . Highly recommend this place."
Avoid. Worst service in Singapore,"Avoid. Worst service in Singapore.

Absolutely worst service I have seen in a restaurant.

Seven people ordered food and five dishes arrived. 10 mins later we asked after the other 2. Oops forgotten so reorder. Dishes come out and one was dropped on a guest so reorder again.

Drinks took 30 mins to arrive in a restaurant that was fairly empty.

The manager clearly saw how bad things were so offered ""a bottle of red and a bottle of white"". Seven people wasted their evenings and 2 bottles of house is supposed to correct that?

Avoid Cook and Brew. It does not deserve any business."
Good place to hangout,"The ambience is great! We just went for a drinks, Kudos to our bartender Marlou! Greeted us when we seated at the bar area he made us a excellent cocktail and good service. Will definitely come here again in future. Cheers!"
Great Cocktails and Good Service,"We've Visited last wednesday evening for a drink! Bartender Marlou was amazing guy with great customer service he recommend us a drinks ""Asam boi & Silky Honey"" it was a good choice when you visit there. Probably we will be back for sure."
Not a great experience,"Saw a very similar review from last year, while I was submitting this. Sadly, things haven't changed in one year.

1. Some (not all) of the service team have little customer service experience. I had booked a dining area and they put me on a barrel in the bar area. When I asked to be changed, the response was very non-customer friendly. ""we don't have you booked there"" and when I showed the booking"" oh..what to do, will have to see""... finally got a table.

2. Food : Average. Even simple stuff like penne and sausage weren't great.

3. Cocktails: Want terrible as some reviews, but would have expected better for a gastro bar. To my earlier point 1, we were served the drinks mixed up and the hostess insisted it was right. Not sure how someone can mix a negrono and Caipirinha (maybe inexperienced staff..)

4. Drinks and food took a long time. Even water took time to be served.

Was a disappointing date for sure."
Dedicated Service,Amazing night with spectacular firework at the NDP rehearsal. The staff is very prompt in their service. Special mention of supervisor Jeno who take time to pop by periodically to make sure everything is taken care ofü§ó
"Awesome experience w staff, Jeno",Went there to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday and it was a pleasure to have such amazing staff like Jeno! She was very attentive to our needs and we all felt very welcomed! We really enjoyed our night and highly recommend our other friends to go there afterwards
Fun birthday celebration,"Came here to celebrate birthday with my friends and we love the vibe of the place. Food was good, drinks were splendid, and would like to have a special shout-out to Jeno who was serving us, she was enthusiastic and has very good attitude. Highly recommend everyone to head over here for a good chill night."
Top of the World - in all ways,Great place to dine and drink. Gorgeous view and amazing crew which makes the experience simply awesome. Special thanks to Caryn and Nui for making it even more memorable.
Love every aspect of it!,"We (3 ppl) came here twice - dinners,

we ordered different food and everything was excellent. I mean: seriously excellent! Sorry, no! The fish was superb because it was not just good in itself but was also cooked so that it would bring up the best out of it.

Service was impeccable. Just such a nice unexpected discovery!

Thank you!"
Great restaurant and bar,"My friends and I stayed over at Westin Hotel and we decided to went cook and brew for a round of beer . I would like to compliment Ms Nui for being polite and friendly and doesn't hesitate to answer every of our queries. The next day we returned for lunch after we check out and there she was and still served us with a smile and I am very happy of her service.

I do hope this compliment reached out to her and you guys will greatly appreciate her and her service.

Will definitely be back to Cook And Brew in near future."
Great restuarant & bar with excellent service,"I was there for a drink for the first night during our staycation at Westin Hotel and we're back the next day for lunch and Ms Nui shows us her professionalism and knowledge on the Food and Beverage in the restaurant!
Plus she's very polite in answering all our queries.
The food was great with reasonable price with the cozy ambience.

Thank you to Ms Nui & her team for her best hospitality and great service.

Will be back to dine in again at Cook & Brew soon....Cheers"
Love the food,We ordered a few items but I would highly recommend Singapore-Style Fried Beehoon for its unique taste that you can't find elsewhere. Love the atmosphere and service too.
Great food at decent prices,Nice atmosphere with fantastic view. Food was great. Special thanks to Ariff and team for their attentiveness and professionalism despite the place always being crowded. Drinks were equally great with Ariff‚Äôs cocktail and mocktail creations. Would visit again!
Not bad,"Except the reservation seat place is not good, others are all excellent! Food are absolutely niceüëçGood service overall. Good environment but sitting near a wall where cannot see anything/ no views.üòÇReceived a birthday surprise cake which is plus pointüëç"
Avoid,"Some (not all) of the service team have little customer service experience coupled with terrible food and disgusting cocktails.

The bar tenders need to drink what they are serving - it‚Äôs just bad.

Fish and chips - frozen cheap fish and the popular burger was just bland.

Apart from the setting in between skyscrapers, there is really nothing that worked well here."
Unexpected,"First of all,I find that it was the perfect place to chill, to have private conversations during a weekday. The ambiance was good despite being surrounded a lot of buildings. Tables are placed quite a distance (for sake of social distancing, I guessed). Ordered the set lunch. They don‚Äôt only looked good, but they also tasted so good! A very worth set lunch as compared if you ordered ala carte. Will come back again to experience it at night"
Great value set lunch and happy hour,Happy Hour cocktails ‚Äì very decent quality and good value especially stacked with Plat Elite‚Äôs 20%. Happy Hour wines @ $10nett per glass was perfectly drinkable to me as well! Their 3-course set lunch @ $38++ was passable but Plat Elite‚Äôs 20% was not applicable.
Happy Hour Drinks,Visited Cook & Brew for their Happy Hour as it had very competitive prices on their drinks. Ambiance of the gastro-pub was good and offered good views of the surrounding areas. Drinks were pretty good overall. Service was hit and miss as I felt the sever was a part timer who didn't know his menu knowledge. Overall an average experience.
Lunch with an Awesome View,"Stepping into the restaurant, I was immediately taken in by the wonderful view of the open sea. Being 33 stories above ground, you can imagine how breathtaking the view would be.

My lunch companion and I walked past a long bar counter as we were led to our table. The ambience was made dimmer by the wood flooring and dark furniture but the light from the outside shone through the floor to ceiling glass panels. The tables were kept apart, conforming to the safe distancing measures. I noticed a mask bag on each table setting, a brilliant idea; as often, we just do not know where to place them as we are eating.

Lunch was the Chicken Schnitzel and Fish and Chips. Both were classified as light meals in the menu, but honestly, their portions are quite large. They were prefect choices for us, tasty and well-cooked, so no complaints there. It was a little hard getting the attention of the staff though, but it could be because of the lean manning, again no fault of theirs.

Overall, an excellent lunch experience."
Evening Out,"Cool deco and ambience with outdoor verendah. Serve superb menu. Ordered Beef Hot Pot, amazing delicious. price also quite affordable. The lounge area good to sit and unwind."
Unprofessional and terrible service,Made a reservation but they got my time wrong. Service was a haste. Limited choice of food. The only good thing was the happy hour but i would rather consider other restaurants / bars around the marina bay area such as Level 33 or MBS.
Happy hour on friday,"Stated in the hotel website happy hour on wed and Friday for $10 nett house pour and wine and beer but when arrived today on a Friday, it says happy hour mon tue and Thursday. Marketing has done a bad job in their own hotel website of such promotion. Wasted trip and ended up going to other pubs in Asia square. Very disappointing for a 5 star hotel"
Seriously a disaster!,"Seriously a disaster! If is not invited, pay me money I also don‚Äôt eat... Taste like Chinese herbal ... Terrible food!"
Dinner for two,"My partner and I had dinner at this restaurant when we stayed at the Westin: it was part of a luxury escapes deal and we were given a set menu which comprised of three courses.
The restaurant is quite dark which was a little disconcerting. Staff were prompt and courteous and our meals arrived promptly. As our choices were determined by the set menu, it is a little difficult to give a fair or wide overview of the food that was available, as we did not see the full menu. I found my kale caesar salad underwhelming: it was dressed with a huge amount of parmesan and I detected very few ingredients apart from the kale. My partner, however, enjoyed his pumpkin soup. the two main courses we had were satisfactory but not outstanding and the dessert of a sundae was a bit underwhelming. Overall, a satisfactory dining experience but due to the circumstances, quite limited."
"Cool atmosphere, great views, nothing to complain about","its one of the many cool top floor bars in Singapore,

had a great start of the evening with drinks and snacks.
very nice view, especially in the evenings overlooking parts of the port and cool design

recommendable bar"
Music TOO LOUD to enjoy my dinner,"Can't enjoy my dinner as the Music was WAY TOO LOUD and did try to get them to lower the volume, which they also found it hard to understand me until the live music too a break, which by then I was ready to leave! I think they cannot decide if this is a food outlet or music outlet!"
Great lunch celebration,Ala carte food were very delicious. The design of the restaurant provided very good ambience for chitchat with friends! Attentive and friendly staff. Great experience.
Its all about quality!,"the subtle understated elegance of this magnificent venue is what starts off the evening on the perfect note, always.
coupled with fine attention to detail in the service and exquisitely created food makes for a magical evening."
Not sure what to make of it,"We like the originality of the menu, but not sure what to make of $56 ""fancy fish and chips"" served with plastic to go visit of roumalade sauce, really?! You couldn't spare a ramekin at these prices?
Also, the silverware is presented in a bucket on your table with the eating portion upright. You heard it right, everyone puts their grubby paws on the part that goes into your mouth. What happened to place settings?
The $29sd burger was the best part of the meal... sad really considering the interesting fusion menu."
Friends Xmas Dinner,"A great evening with friends to celebrate the festive holidays. Service was exceptional, friendly and attentive. We luxuriously over a few hours chatting n enjoy the happy hour 5 pm till 12 mn on Fridays can‚Äôt beat it"
"Great venue, superb staff","Held our company event here and we were amazed by the friendly and prompt service of the staff here.
Thank you Thomas Chandra and his team for looking after our group really well. Buffet spread was delicious and everyone had a great time!

Cook and Brew is great for functions as it is very private and yet has a cosy atmosphere.

Highly recommended!"
Lunch Celebration,Great food! Nicest impossible burger I have ever tried! Good service. Remember to check for BYO terms and conditions
Great dining experience,One of the best Beef Pot Roast I‚Äôve eaten! The beef was well cooked to tender and juicy and It melts in your mouth .... it‚Äôs a food journey with a great panoramic view of the financial district .....also a great dining experience with a energetic music beats!
Excellent service and great experience!,"I have been to Cook and Brew four times and recently organized a secondary school reunion in the bar area. I have only had positive experiences but this was is my first written review.

On the evening above, the staff in the bar area of Cook and Brew went above and beyond to make our group of 11 feel warm and comfortable. We were served by a team of no less than 4-5 individuals who all took our food and drinks orders and followed up immediately - they moved together as a single team (vs handing off to the waiter or waitress in the section) which made the evening really smooth. Also, when one of us lost an airpod (headset piece) they moved furniture and brought a light out to successfully locate it! This was during Happy Hour too! With a lot going on.

In short - great food and drinks served by great people, excellent ambiance and a general warm feeling especially in the bar area, and a great evening! Thank you!"
Dinner,"Good ambience and services, they manage to fulfill my request to get the best seat for my dinner! thanks Cook&Brew!"
Great crew and service,"Awesome service and friendly staff.. great place for business drinks and classy ambience! Thomas, the restaurant manager, looked after our event and catered to our changing event needs. We are certainly impressed and will come back again!"
Great bar with view and amazing service,"I found this place few months ago, and have brought a few groups of people here. The feedback to me is always: Reasonable prices, amazing view and excellent service. My guests commented that they feel at home, especially with the service of Yusof. His professional attitude and attentive service have made us weekly regulars at Cook and Brew. Will definitely recommend this place, especially the outdoor sitting."
Great Dining with A View,"Good Views, Attentive Staff. Arrived an hour ahead of my reservation and was ushered to my table, no fuss. My friends and I loved the food - burgers especially, uniquely juicy ! Overall, a good experience. Would have been even better if we could have stayed for drinks ! Thanks!"
Positive comments,"The place was awesome. Staff are friendly, although we are first time here , we are happy with their service"
"Good food, excellent service, nice environment","Is my 2nd time here. Food is nice and value for money. Nice selection of beer, wine, cocktails and mocktail. They have dinner and bar menu not a big selection but good enough. I order different food during both visits and everything is nice! Like the environment, feel relax. Excellent service. Will definitely be back again."
Tasty food but service understaffed,"Tasty food , nice curry mussels , Pity they don‚Äôt serve bread to start the meal . Pork chop was enormous . Had a very good brined flavour to it .
Waiter was hardly to be seen on a non busy Monday night .
Overall pleasant experience"
Great food with a great view,We are here quite often for business and they are always accommodating of special requests. The food is great and so is the view
Great View and Food,Our regular place to have lunch or drinks after work. Highly suggested. The food is very nice and you can have a good dry martini here.
Popular bar,"On the 34th(?) floor of the Westin. Great view, fast service on a Wednesday night for a business dinner group of 22. Main courses were pre-selected by attendees from choice of vegetarian, fish, or beef. Nicely prepared and plated."
5 Star Venue 1 Star Service,"Really nice and comfortable rooftop bar with indoor and outdoor seating and amazing views but that‚Äôs where it ends. We found ourselves a nice and comfortable table, chatted for 20mins without getting any service. This includes standing up and trying to get a server‚Äôs attention. It was not busy and nowhere near a full house. Eventually I went over to the bar, got the drinks menu myself, got everyone‚Äôs orders, headed back to the bar to place my orders. Went to the bar myself to order the second and third round of drinks too."
Poor Service,"Was there for the second time. Firstly it has a good view at 33rd floor but we were floored by its unbelievable poor service.

We were there for happy hours, the service staff took our orders and came back after some time to tell us they have no more Tiger beer - a 5* hotel has no stock of beer that is produced here?!! We had to ask the service staff what other beer do they have for happy hours - he went to check but did not return.

My friend went to the bar and placed our orders. Nothing came. Subsequently, a service staff and told us that the bar did not key in our orders and he was to take our orders.

All in I felt that we had waited for at least half an hour and naturally we missed the happy hour (or was planned this way I wonder). Worst, the place was mostly empty with only about a dozen customers there. Its not that the place was too crowded for the service staff to handle.

Told my friend not to patronize this place again."
Bland meals but awesome views and setup,"Was a Saturday evening meal with the wife. All I can say is the meals were bland. Entree, main and dessert. My ice cream was good though. I rarely make comments like this but if I had salt on the table it would have been used. It's almost like the cooks/chefs aren't even testing their own dishes b4 plating up.
Regards"
Dinner,"Average restaurant. Only went there as we were staying at the Westin and had a Luxury Escapes package.
Ordered Pork chop which was not fully cooked and when we told the waitress she said that was how they serve it- disappointing. Food on the whole tasted average. Only saving grace was a decent beer selection."
What a disappointment,"Staying at the Westin we decided to try the Cook and Brew and on hindsight we should have left earlier than we did.
The problem was the food. The menu looked underwhelming and we decided to give it a go as you would expect there to be a good standard for a major hotel in a city that survives on good food.

We started with entrees and both fell short of the mark.
Mains were the major disappointment and I am still surprised how they could get it wrong.
Ordered smoked pork chop with brussel sprouts and my partner a chicken parma - 5 star menu - right??? - NO. So the thought process they must do something special.
The pork came to the table - large piece of meat accompanied with some sprouts - unexciting on the plate but worse was that there was blood/juice on the plate indicating it wasn't rested long enough before plating and it didn't look good. Tried the meal and the meat (from Canada) was ok but something didnt go right with the smoking process (in my opinion) and after 3 - 4 mouthfuls I was done. The sprouts were good (ate them).
The chicken parma didn't fare any better and without going into detail the meal was unbalanced and stodgy. It lasted 5 mouthfuls.
We decided to pass on dessert even though it was offered for free.
We did mention the disappointment to the waitress and the Exec chef came out and we shared our views. We were told they were aiming for Gastro pub style food - all I can say is they missed the mark and I do challenge the chef if he understands what gastro pub food is.
To me the food was basic 'club' food on the menu and presented at the table even below that.
The decor and layout of the restaurant was disappointing - sports bar feel."
Birthday dinner,"High standard of service! We were arranged to a table having a magnificent night view. My girl was so glad & surprised to receive a beautiful desserts platter from the chef ! The staff are so nice & friendly. Together with the tasty food, we did have an enjoyable evening here."
Varied a la carte menu,We didn‚Äôt want a huge meal of several courses or from a buffet on our last evening before going to the airport for an overnight flight. The food we chose was delicious and fairly priced.
Not what it used to be,"I used to enjoy going to Cook & Brew for their poutine fries, truffle chicken and drinks. Can be pricey but I‚Äôve always felt the food and drinks were worth the price.

Made an appointment with friends to go on a Friday night recently. Ordered a whisky dry (a term which one of their waiters used the last time i was there 3 months ago). The waitress had no idea what we were talking about. The drinks all tasted watered down compared to 3 months ago: G&T tasted like plain water. Mojito too. Told the waitress on the plain tasting mojito. The staff gave me a new glass filled to the brim with ice and all I could taste was lime juice. When i took out all the ice, there was only about 1 finger left of drink left in the glass, which makes me wonder how much rum was added in the drink in the first place. The poutine fries was just salty with no taste. The truffle chicken was dry with hardly any truffle flavour. Pad Thai fries was just so so .

This recent experience was totally different from just a few months ago. I wonder if they recently changed their chef. One thing is for certain, Cook & Brew would not see me for a while."
Amazing service by Thomas Chandra!,"Despite a busy Friday night, Thomas looked after our needs most carefully and flawlessly. He‚Äôs an asset to your hotel!"
Interesting Food Experience,"As usual my forte is writing reviews about my hotel stays and not particularly keen on restaurant reviews. But in this case I had to write because of an interesting exchange with the chef of the restaurant. We were a party of 4.

Service: Very slow and in consistent. Wait staff had to be flagged down each time to take orders, serve water and even the bill. Not sure what the issue is but looks like staff shortage or inexperienced staff.

Food: Now let me say the food was good, especially the kale/brussels sprouts, the roasted cod, whipped buffalo milk ricotta cheese dish, and the pot roast.
But here is what intrigued me. The restaurant lists Pork Chops from BC(and I am Canadian) so I am fully aware what a pork chop is, albeit from BC or Ontario farms.
The wait staff informed us that this pork chop in particular is huge and about 600 grams.
So decided to order the pork chop to share as the size was just too much for one.
The surprise was that what we were served instead was a pice of Ham sliced up. Salty and fatty.
I was going to let this pass but instead decided to let the staff know as I was told the chef is a Canadian as well.
The staff said they wanted feedback and I said thats fine and that they can let the chef know but that I did not need to see him.
It so happened the chef was sitting a couple of tables away entertaining his friends.
He came over introduced himself and started to lecture me that because the pork is brined it appears as a piece of ham. No apologies whatsoever. I eat brined pork all the time from Cumbraes here in Ontario and never knew brining would turn pork into ham.

We paid our bill which included a service charge and of course taxes for non existent service.

I am disappointed and will not return to this place. In addition be aware of what day you visit as there is blaring live music that does not really let you enjoy your meal."
Quite a letdown as compared to previous visits,"Have been going there regularly for the food, nice view and pretty friendly staff. Even recommended many of my friends to go. However, after the last visit, doubt I will go there for awhile and will definitely tell my friends that this place has a very rude staff to avoid. One female staff was very rude. We were there for dinner, and I had a complimentary cocktail. My date only wanted to take a sip and try, and the female staff raised her voice and told us off very sternly, ""SIR THIS IS NOT FOR YOU!"" Well the next table was looking at us and it's rather embarrassing. We paid for a proper dinner with wine and we are not there just for your complimentary cocktails. What a humiliation."
Excellent service with lovely ambience,"Had a business lunch at the Cook and Brew and am really pleased with the experience. Firstly, because the ambience is perfect for conversations - personal or professional and secondly, the food is always delicious. Our guest had to rush off for a meeting and asked for lunch to be expedited. While inundated with orders, the team offered to have at least our guest's order expedited and achieved that, with our own following not far behind. I'd definitely return."
Tasty food. Average portions. Rather pricey. Spacious chill ambience,"Happy hour Friday drinks at $10 nett is worth it. With many options like beer, cocktails & wines.
The food appetizers around $16++ the portions are not particularly big like some western cuisine. It can be bigger for the price.
The following are all appetizers.
Mussels size were quite small. The flesh of the mussel was tiny. Not like A grade mussel. Beef tartare taste was ok. Too few chips on the side to eat together.
The poutine flavor was good but fries a bit hard. Portion definitely can be bigger. Too little.
Turkey meatballs only 3 piece serving. Abit too little for $16++ Taste is not dry so it‚Äôs ok. Each piece of meatball is topped with 1 slice of potato chip... er... seriously? Give a proper side of chips!
The side dish of roasted cauliflower is not bad. $7++ the portion is also not big.
In all we paid over $200++ with taxes and total 9 happy hour drinks.
Not particularly cheap. I would have given ‚Äúvery good‚Äù if the portion sizes were bigger. Which they definitely can do with such pricing.
Won‚Äôt mind coming back for the ambience and drinks but certainly hope the portion sizes improve."
Dinner one person travelling,"This is one of the two options for restaurants in the Westin. Spacious interior with cowboy type theme by the looks.
Service was pretty average. It took a good 10 minutes to get served when sitting at the bar and it was not really busy.
The food is also very average. When asked about the burger, I did mention that you generally do need to be able to pick a burger up. The one served tasted good, but had so many toppings it was sliding everywhere and you needed to use a knife and fork. The various choices of fries probably save the place."
"Nice place, unfortunate servixe","For the prices we were paying, the food was acceptable. The peanut ice cream cake was very nice. The place is beautiful and has a nice ambience.

Unfortunately, the waiters kept trying to upsell the alcohol which was very frustrating as we already knew what we wanted. It also took a good 10 minutes for us to get seated despite having a reservation."
Executive Lunch,"The Whipped Buffalo Milk Ricotta Cheese with bread is super yummy, wonderful in taste and texture. We also had the shaved brussel sprouts & Kale - refreshing. And you can't go wrong with the C&B favorites - roasted artic cod. Will definitely be back again."
"Fantastic View, food and ambience","Lovely space, well furnished with tasteful design and great ambience with delectable food. Went on a chope one for one set meal and the food was of huge serving. If going with friends, suggest to get different mains for sharing to try more dishes. As it was my friend‚Äôs birthday, a complementary cake with candle was also provided. It was child friendly as well with children seats provided and sufficient space for kids to play. For those just looking for a drink, the couch setting is really nice for groups to chill."
A must try Whipped Buffalo Milk Ricotta!,Great experience dining at the Cook & Brew! A meal here must start with the Whipped Buffalo Milk Ricotta! Crusty Bread + Ricotta with truffle honey = Perfect match!
Ridiculously loud music. Very off putting,"I have been to Cook & Brew many times and organised a number of client events there over the years. I will not be doing that again in a hurry.

The live music on a Wednesday night was ridiculously loud. Hardly anyone sat inside as it was literally impossible to have a conversation. Everyone was sitting outside and even then you could hear the band very loudly even when the door was shut! Despite giving feedback at the time (the staff did nothing about it) I have to say I was pretty disappointed. This hotel bar is right in the CBD and should be an obvious place to bring clients and colleagues for business networking and socialising. However it‚Äôs completely inappropriate to have such loud music playing at a venue like this. I am all for live music etc but to be frank the level of noise and racket was well over the top. I won‚Äôt be back anytime soon which is a shame as it‚Äôs somewhere we use pretty frequently for business entertainment.

I can see from other comments that this is far from being the first complaint about the music. I suggest that the management aim to do something about this as otherwise they will lose valuable footfall to other establishments in the area who work a little harder to create a more suitable environment for their business clientele."
"Excellent food, unfortunate service.","I attended dinner at this place on Valentine‚Äôs Day, which is also my girlfriend‚Äôs birthday.

I shall start by mentioning that the food and ambience is excellent in this place. However, the service is not what I expect of a place of this caliber.

I had spoken to a staff member of the restaurant over the phone on Tuesday, Two days before the booking to ensure that they would know it was her birthday and to pre-order a small cake/dessert with a candle. The person on the phone assured it was would not be a problem.

When I arrived at the restaurant, I also reminded one of the senior-looking male managers of this same request, who gladly helped me to arrange the peanut butter ice cake dessert with a candle. However, after we were done with the main course, the waiter brought us the dessert menu still did not realise the prior arrangement and I had to tell him in front of my girlfriend that it was her birthday and I was expecting the cake with a candle. It was only after that, that the cake with a candle arrived. The waiter who brought the cake also simply left it on the table and as I was trying to get his attention to help us take a photo, as is reasonably expected for a birthday occasion, he abruptly turned and left. Thus, we had to take it by ourselves.

It was a humiliating experience for myself and ruined the birthday cake surprise I was planning. Although my girlfriend still enjoyed the dinner and was very appreciative of the effort I put in, I was thoroughly embarrassed. I honestly expected a smoother experience given the reasonable steps I took to ensure the surprise of the birthday cake. I appreciate that the lady manager that night took 10% off the final bill, but that would not replace the memory of a flawless birthday dinner that never was. Disappointing."
"OK, nothing spectacular and a little loud",Had a small client drinks event here. Was OK but nothing special. We ordered nibbles and they were delivered quickly and had a decent flavor. Service overall was good. They had a band which was annoyingly loud.
Excellent place for a drink,"It was an awesome place to meet friends for a drink. Food is decent but not to die for. Staff was friendly and helpful. The place has a promotion for certain drinks and it is really value for money. Nice and relax place to chill out with friends after work and have a drink.

You can also celebrate friends birthday there too where they will serve a slice of cake for the birthday boy or girl. Excellent."
Company dinner event in a beautiful restaurant.,"This is a beautiful restaurant located on the 33rd floor in The Westin, Singapore.

We held our company year end dinner last night and greatly enjoyed the lovely ambience, view and delicious food (good portions too)!
including a prompt/efficient servicing team.

Dear Thomas/Chef and all in Cook&Brew, thank you for taking good care of our dinner event!"
Nice views Good food,The views of the marina are amazing on the 33rd floor view of this restaurant on top of the Westin Hotel. Food is good but portions are small. Really enjoyed the fancy ‚Äúfish‚Äù and chips which is really lobster meat instead of fish.
Lunch,"Upon arrival, found that my booking was not registered despite having confirmation reference. And probably that's why we couldn't get window seats.Picked set lunches and its serving size is of quite big portion. Value for money except dessert selection is rather uncreative and no choice given. Unless you change it to coffee or tea."
"Nice ambience, Awesome place",Frequent patron of this restaurant be it for business or any events. The ambience and view are awesome. Ask the server for the corner seat which gives a good view of MBS and its surrounding. Good selection of drinks and food. Tasty food (the change of menu is worth the anticipation) and worth the price.
Nice ambience and food but too slow,"Located at 33 floor it has nice city nice view. Restaurant ambience is nice and cosy. The day I visited, it rained and therefore the restaurant became very cold. We had the promo set dinner. Starter is great. Choose the salad and phad Thai fries, interesting combination. Next we both have mushrooms soup. These soup is really a super long wait until I think it's the soup need to put off stock. We waited for 45 mins. Finally the soup served, nice but too salty. You really can't have much. Instead of having mushrooms chunk it served as deep fried mushroom at side. Next, the main course. No complaint on that both the beef pot roast and thai green curry mussels tasted good. Lastly is the desert, some ice cream cake which is good too.

The service need to be improved. Too little staff or they should put something on rhea table to able to alert the staff. Very hard to get attention from them. Especially the 45 mins, we really hungry and feel disappointed with it."
Restaurant with nice ambiance and good service as always,"Tried Chope Exclusive 1-for-1 4 course set, food was not as great as their ala-carte menu. But definitely 5 stars for their service and restaurant atmosphere."
Great !,"It‚Äôs our anniversary, we both enjoy so much as the food and service very good. Cosy ambience. We will sure come back"
Nice food with a view,Third time for me. Was hosting a corporate lunch. Very nice ambience and the 3 courae set lunch was also quite nice. The starters in particular are really good. The chicken dish in the mains was ok. A bit too salty. I had a better experience previous times. Will definitely be back here again.
Attentive service and cozy environment,"My husband and I went to Cook & Brew to celebrate his birthday. It was quiet and cozy on a Saturday evening, just what we needed to unwind. Mary Grace was very attentive & friendly during our time there. Her pleasant service made our dinner very enjoyable. The food was above average, what you would expect of a restaurant at this price point."
Event well organized,Had a party organized for about 150 people. Staff were prompt in managing the crowd. proactive approach for topping up drinks and serving food all round. Overall excellent place to host large corporate events.
Great place,"Very nice sea view! And there is live band performance, my friends and I loved it! Will definitely recommend to other friends."
Nice and cosy bar!,Was here for some drinks and they were having promo for Fri with $10 net for some drinks. There is a live bar from 6pm onwards. Overall quite cosy!
"Amazing food and drinks, Atmosphere",I was in the Westin on business for 10 days and was at Cook and Brew basically every night. Food was on a different level and a very nice selection of beers on tap as well.
Weekday lunch,Nice ambience n good service by staff Ariff. Will be back for the $10 nett beer and cocktails on Friday happy hour from 5pm onwards.
Unexpected Pleasure,"I was served by Ariff at the bar who made me my first Singapore Sling that was delicious. I asked him what his favorite and he served me the Pot Roast. I was not disappointed, it was to die for! Overall exceptional service!"
chill & drink spacious for many groups,"~Celine brought many of us here for drinks & snacks... it's got a large indoor area with enough spots for many different groups to gather easily

~from the hotel lobby take the elevator to Level 32 and change to another that brings you to Level 33

~if you drive, park at Asia Square Tower 2 and go to carpark level 5 to get into the hotel directly

white wine by the glass is very affordable (by Singapore standards) and absolutely delicious!"
Cook & Brew,"Service was on prompt and on point. However, the lighting was just too dark for my personal liking. As usual, the buffalo whipped ricotta is the must have on the order. Portions are surprising big and too filling."
A lovely night,"I brought my friends from Indonesia last night (friday) for a dinner and they love the ambience, the food from starter to main course. We served by Thomas and team from the moment we arrived till end of our dinner. They are very attentive and professional. We left with a happy tummy and smile. ~Eveline~"
Awesome food and ambience,"At level 33, this place offers a great view and ambience! The food is worth the wait as well! I‚Äôll Recommend the cod fish, pad thai fries and pork chop! Overall a great experience! Great to chill!"
Great food,"great food for a hotel restaurant, amazing burgers and a great broccoli app. After a long day the food is delicious we ate there 3 times, especially since there is not alot of food places in the area."
A place for memorable moments.,"My fianc√© contacted the restaurant to book a specific seat. Mary Grace acceded to his request and we got the seat he has asked for even during short notice. Apparently, my fianc√© chose this restaurant to propose to me and we had no regrets. Lovely view, accommodating staff and to say that the food was delicious is a thousand degrees too tame a word to describe just how good it was! The service crew who served us facilitated the surprise proposal, taking videos of the proposal despite having to attend to other customers and even gave us a complimentary dessert. Truly commendable service crew. I can never imagine having my proposal anywhere else but Cook & Brew @ The Westin. Thank you Mary Grace & crew for making one of the most important days of my life the most memorable one. No words can express how grateful I am to have been served with such professionalism. Cook & Brew will definitely be a special place in our hearts for a Long time to come, and it will always be our go to place for special occasions!"
Beautiful restaurant with awesome view,Had lunch with my family on Monday 9 July 2018 1230pm at Cook and Brew. The restaurant is so beautiful with such an awesome view. The food was prepared really well and tasted delicious!
"Great Service, Great Experience","We held our business cocktail event here. Great ambience, casual and relaxed. Wonderful settings they had done up for us at our request. The view outdoor at night was amazingly beautiful. This is definitely an ideal place to hold cocktail events as their staff provided us with 5-star service and the canap√©s were delicious."
Delicious and wonderful,"Went for dinner on a Friday night; great atmosphere, fab live music, wonderful setting. Unexpected great views from the 33rd floor.
Went for the 'Canadian' food and were absolutely pleasantly surprised and amazed. The 'Whipped Buffalo Milk Ricotta Cheese' was to die for. A definite MUST TRY! The turkey meatballs, the poutine and miso cod were wonderful. Every dish was splendidly done, full of flavours, beautifully presented and stunning in taste. Chef Ivan even came to the table to personally greet us. What a wonderful touch and true hospitality of it's finest. He presented some great insights into the menu creations and it was a huge pleasure witnessing a team, which truly loves what they do.

A changing menu means we will come back for sure."
Great service & food - underrated haven in CBD,"Not my first visit - I‚Äôve come back because of the great hotel-level service and very good food. Love the broad range of the menu. On repeat visits the friendly staff remembered the wine I liked and where I liked to sit. Suitable for business lunches, casual, evenings - have seen the space work well in quite different settings.
Great outdoor terrace with views towards marina bay (obscured) and across the port towards the straits & Sentosa. Classy enough to bring a client or visitors but also relaxed for a getaway.
Thanks to the team, will keep coming back. Ps thanks to Ariff for his friendly welcome and service this week."
Great experience,"Made a reservation for a dinner on a Saturday evening.

Had Whipped Buffalo Milk Ricotta Cheese. The bread was very delicious but truffle honey taste was too much for me. (Not a big fan of truffle) but wanted to try it.

Cast Iron Chicken Breast was soft and tasty.

Garganeelli Pasta & Duck Confit is a must try too.

However, the place was quite dim for my liking. (Can be romantic to others)

Overall, this place located at level 33 has pretty awesome view and we even caught a glimpse of the national day fly pass and fireworks."
Great service. Good food and gr8 view,The view from their 33 floor is worth the visit. The food options are good especially even in vegetarian and the staff is very cooperative.
