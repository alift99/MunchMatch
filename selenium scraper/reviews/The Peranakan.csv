best peranakan food,"Their peranakan food is absolutely fantastic, better than all others I have ever had in Singapore.

The Ayam Buah Keluak was aromatic and not too salty that one could still taste the flavour of the paste inside pangium. The chicken was tender.

Their chap chye was also not salty at all, very much to my liking.

It was really sad news that the restaurant closed in late November 2021, owing to the COVID situation."
Garden Authentic Peranakan Restaurant in Middle if Orchard Road Area,"It Been a long Time last Visited The Peranakan. Recently Renovated with a Garden Feeling .Food Still remain Fantastic. Service Friendly. Dishes Super Shiok Die Die MUST TRY Assam Pedas FISH Head , Nonya Chap Chye , Nasi Ulam , Ngoh Hiang , Satay Babi Sum Chan .Kaki Babi Pong Teh my Favourable, Beef Rendang .Lastly Assam Pedas King Prawn.
Not to forget Dessert Chendol"
Quite disappointed. I came,"Quite disappointed.
I came to this restaurant with some expectations of a really good Peranakan meal. But it did not live up. The much heralded Ayam Buak Keluak was average. The beef rendang lacked the rich rempah flavors I expected. The redeeeming dishes were the fried buah keluak and the fried egg cincalok. The head server was a bit brusque and somewhat finicky. I won’t say the food was bad but it isn’t a place I’d recommend. The decor of the restaurant was quite a sight. Right next door is a small museum and it was quite interesting."
Disappointing! I am never to return. Ever.,"We were all looking forward to a nice meal. We left were very disappointed. All the food we ordered came to us looking like it was cooked day/s before, microwaved, cold, lukewarm, tasteless. We ordered: fried spring rolls, kueh pie ti, veg mutton cubes, eggplant with sweet soy, the chicken curry, salted fish fried rice. I sent the veg mutton dish back because the gravy had caked over; as gravies typically do when microwaved. We pointed out to the server that the salted fish rice was cold and the response was, “it’s supposed to be served cold; like a salad”. Really? How could one even dare say that to locals! We left half of every order, except the kueh pie ti, on the table. It was so bad we couldn’t even bring ourselves to doggie bag any."
Vegan High Tea - Flavourful and Beautiful,"I tried the vegan high tea set at The Peranakan during a 50% off promotion.

The main was dry laksa, which consisted of chewy yellow noodles with a deep spicy seafood aroma topped with a firm but bouncy prawn. This dish was impressively realistic and was the star of the show.

The savoury platter consisted of petite servings of a variety of Peranakan dishes.
Nasi ulam: Spicy herbal rice. This dish was not sufficiently fragrant in my opinion.
Kueh pie ti: Delicate shell filled with juicy stuffing.
White bread with hae bi hiam: The pumpkin floss did not successfully mimic hae bi hiam as it was not spicy and lacked a seafood aroma. Nonetheless, the pumpkin floss had a satisfying crunchy and powdery texture, such that this dish was reminiscent of meat floss sandwiches.
Popiah goreng: Crispy deep fried spring rolls with sweet vegetable stuffing.
Mutton rendang kongbak pao: Soft steamed bun topped with a spicy stew of potatoes and mock meat.

The sweet platter contained an array of Peranakan desserts.
Pulot enti kelapa: Glutinous rice with crunchy grated coconut. This dish was somewhat bland for a dessert.
Kuih kosui: Chewy and mildly sweet gula melaka kuih.
Apom bokwa with pisang pengat: Rice flour cake sitting on a pool of creamy sweet gravy made from banana, gula melaka, and coconut cream.
Apom balek durian: Traditional pancake with a tastefully sweet durian paste.
Durian pengat: Dainty cup of a mixture of two types of thick durian paste with rich complex flavours. We saved the best for the last!

Overall, the food was flavourful and beautifully plated. The restaurant had a nice ambience with intricate flamboyant decorations. There was also a small shop and museum gallery."
Circuit breaker cheers,"Circuit breaker kept us home. But nothing will stop us from having good food. We decided on Peranakan and know of a fabulous Peranakan restaurant in claymore connect at orchard road. On the website I am delighted to see that they have set menu for delivery/ takeaway orders! The ‘bento’ sets are like samplers of what the restaurant offers, and it ranges from appetisers ( eg. Kuey pai ti) to the assortments of desserts. We chose the bigger ‘Bento’ for 2 (Tok Panjang WKW) , and also ordered their chicken curry, the kids’ favorite fried chicken wings and the Peranakan seafood Hokkien mee. We cooked our own rice and with the sumptuous spread of food, we fed a family of 5 and we had a lot Left over for the next day. What to look out for is their Peranakan seafood and the fried chicken wings ( not in the set), the beef rendang and the sambal prawns . The rest are delightfully delicious as well. What a treat and cheer, we so needed during this time. And by the way, we also had a chance to donate a nominal sum to ‘adopt-a- bento’ in the same order website- which will help them to provide delicious and nutritious meals to the healthcare frontliners, elderly living in one room rental flats and former Sungei road vendors. Great cause !"
Special Set Menu,We went straight to its famous Tok Panjang set menu. It's a menu you can taste a bit of everything from soup to desserts. It's always good to try out special meals.
High Tea Super sedap!,"Authentic and tasty Peranakan desserts and kuih2 with excellent coffee and chendol. My third time here and I am still looking forward to coming back again. Staff is warm and friendly, very welcoming. Do check out the Peranakan exhibits on display: certainly like a mini museum!"
Great Peranakan food with an ambience to match,Delicious Peranakan food with great ambience and service! They offer a vegetarian version as well! Beat that!
"Nice dinner, lovely Peranakan ambience","Came here for a reunion dinner with friends and we all had a great time. The peranakan food was delicious, including the pai tee, buah keluak, ngoh hiang, cincaluk omelete, dark soy fish and lovely banana dessert. Service was friendly and cordial and they also have merchandise on sale at the front of the restaurant. A great time was had by all!"
Authentically Singaporean,"A Singaporean friend took me here for a taste of what authentic Singaporean cuisine has to offer. We tried a tasting set filled with lots of interesting things, not all of which were to my liking, but all which offered something different. The herbed rice was outstanding, as were the pork meatball soup and the pork belly curry. The service staff were attentive and very helpful, and there was real pride in the food that they brought to the table. I had such a lovely night here and would recommend it to all visitors who want an authentic experience."
gd ambience,"Ambience and deco was great. Food is alright but expected better. Service staffs was very friendly and helpful. Location of restaurant is not very easy to find, requires abit of navigation. Overall experience was a good one"
Authenticity and quality,"Among the many good food experiences we had during our recent 9-day visit to Singapore, the highlight for me was the Peranakan Restaurant. The warm welcome from restaurant staff made a strong positive first impression as did their enthusiastic and quick service. We chose the Tok Panjang tasting menu which had an impressive range of dishes, distinct flavours and textures. We are subject to so much modern fusion food in Australia, it was a really nice change to have a lunch that celebrated the original Peranakan culinary traditions."
Pretty Peranakan Restaurant,"Restaurant is very pretty and the museum next door is very enjoyable, especially if there’s overseas guests. Service is a bit slow though. The Bakwah kepiting soup is par excellent. Ayam buah keluak is thick and flavourful but the chicken could be more tender and smaller bite pieces. Ngoh Hiang was average. Chapchye was good too. Desserts were a little disappointing, could be more lemak and fragrant."
Great introduction to Peranakan Cuisine,"This beautiful and colorful restaurant located inside the Connect mall has an elegant yet festive atmosphere. The servers are dressed in traditional attire, very attentive, and helpful. This was my first time to try Peranakan cuisine which I really wanted to experience after reading about Nyonya Baba cooking. The food was good, but I felt like the home-cooked version would be more flavorful. Nonetheless, the plate-up and food presentation were all excellent. Try the dessert platter if you have a big group. It was a bit pricey for a group of 5, but it was well worth the experience and the variety of food we were served."
Heritage Peranakan Super Shiok Food Must Try,"Orchard Recently is crowded with 2 new Peranakan Restaurant. But Nothing Stand out against The PERANAKAN at Orchard Hotel in Claymore Road .This Restaurant also have a Heritage Peranakan Museum & Boutique where you can purchase item Baba & Nonya Clothes & Accessories. Item die die must Try appetizer Kueh Pie Ti,Main Food Assam Fish Head ,Ayam Buah Keluak ,Ngoh Hiang, Chap Chye ,Bai Pong Teh Not forgetting Super Shiok Udang Assam Pedas .Lastly Dessert Cendol."
Best Peranakan restaurant at Claymore Connect,"Unlike the more discrete True Blue, the décor here is flamboyant, yet charming. The food is very good, although the signature Nasi Ulam is less fragrant and addictive than many home-cooked versions. The Assam Pedas Fish Head is yummy, though. A bit pricey, but all good Baba-Nonya restaurants in Singapore are!"
Peranakan style dinner,Amazing food and impeccable service! We chose the set dinner and the food came with a unique presentation. In our group was a friend from UK and the waiter offered a complimentary scoop of durian pengat! We were also introduced to their gallery and someone helped us for photo taking. Great experience all round.
"Beautifully decorated, authentic","Beautifully decorated, authentic Peranakan ambience. On Sunday’s lunch time there is an artiste and dance performance during December 2019. We did not take the set menus which offered so much variety but decided on the a la carte menu, of Babi Pong Teh (Slow cooked pork stew) and seafood noodles. All were tasty except the seafood which was probably frozen ones because they are not as tasty as fresh seafood."
"Dinner at The Peranakan restaurant - Clay more Connect, 442 Orchard Road, S238879","We had a birthday celebration dinner and was glad we had chosen Peranakan cuisine for a change. The ambience was great, location tucked away at the far side of Orchard road, central yet not too busy.

When we are seated, the restaurant served some snacks, mini prawn rolls as starters. We ordered the signature perankan dishes, Soup Bakwan Kepiting, Ayam Buah Keluak, Kaki Baby Pong Teh, Beef Rendang, Samba Udang Petal, Nonya Chap Chye and finished off with Chendol Melaka, Apong with banana.

The hot lemongrass or pandan tea was a great compliment to the satisfying meal."
Expensive,"Nice ambience with all the Peranakan decorations , Peranakan food tastes authentic but a tad salty. Price is on the high side!"
Great interesting flavors,Unique Peranakan flavors mixture of Malay and Chinese. Great service and friendly staff. Arts and dress traditional to this Singapore region. Clise to walking distance from our hotel. Makes it a great location in heart of Orchard Road in Claymore Shopping mall level 2.
Perfect,"We stopped by here the other day. The owners were running special charity sales of their (excellent) peranakan goods and offering space for local charities to sell things too. This really endeared them to us. So we booked a table. We were so glad we did. Here is the summary;
* great atmosphere
* excellent food
*friendly and helpful service
* good value for money for local dishes
So how do you judge a restaurant- you book your next meal before you leave. And that is what we did. Thank you. See you soon,
Dr John"
Nice restaurant,We visited as a group it was good food and not too expensive for Singapore but service was slow However a good night out
Highly Impressive Once Again,"It was my second visit to this restaurant, and I must say her standards have not dropped. This time I brought my cousin and I am quite sure she was impressed, both with the food and the service.

From the beginning of our lunch experience to the end, the level of attentiveness lavished on us never wavered. Lunch was the chap chye (mixed vegetables) and the simmered chicken. Both were excellent choices and served with rice, our meal was perfect. We decided that washing down our meal with hot lemongrass tea was ideal. We ended our meal with the chendol. I have always been wary of the strong taste of brown sugar in this dessert. Surprisingly, despite not asking to omit the sugar, the dessert to me was a delight.

We are your fans."
Amazing Peranakan experience !!!!,"We are here in Singapore visiting from London and so wanted to try authentic Peranakan cuisine. We were not disappointed !!! The ambiance is perfect, lots of original Peranakan features, decor and tableware really set the scene. We were lucky enough to meet Raymond Khoo - the owner and Chef - who is a most charming host and took time to explain the history and heritage of our fantastic meal. The vegan menu is incredible, so tasty and we found it hard to believe that we were not eating meat & fish. The blue gin & tonic is also a must as is the blue flower welcome drink which seems to cure every ailment under the sun ! We will definitely be telling all our friends and family back in London about this fantastic restaurant and will be back next time we are in town. Than you Raymond and team for a great experience."
Sambal Udang (Prawn Sambal),"Sambal Udang (Prawn Sambal)

I had a seafood lunch at The Peranakan (Claymore Connect Mall). I have read about it online as one of the TOP 10 best local cuisine restaurants. I had prawns with chili sauce and ladies' fingers (Okra). This dish was well presented and tasty especially the Okra, which was so smooth and not over cooked, I love the edible green seed pods. It was the classic local dish of Sambal Udang (Prawn Sambal), it is served with rice. The Sambal Udang is fiery and tangy, if you are not a fan of spicy dishes, then do request a mild flavour. By the way, Sambal is a chili sauce. I had Iced lemongrass & pandan tea as my cold drink. There is a Peranakan Museum next door of local interior and cutlery.

SEE photos."
"was reccommended,and not disappointed","i dont normally write reviews,but very pleased with friendly service and the food was excellent,will be going back."
Peranakan fare at its best,"Fabulous lunchtime feast at lunchtime - beef rendang, satay pork belly, sambal crispy skin fish all great"
The Peranakan Gallery,"Was attending a briefing at the adjacent Orchard Hotel and decided to explore the newly renovated Claymore Connect.

Was pleasantly surprised to see The Peranakan Gallery, part of The Peranakan restaurant.

As we already had lunch, we did not dine here but we had the pleasure of discovering the very interesting gallery where you find all things Peranakan.

It was an eye opener and brought back memories of younger days with the various displays of games, clothes, household items, etc...

Many colourful and interesting displays which will surely make for an educational visit too with the information posted next to the displays.

Likely to return with the older generation and hopefully get the opportunity to dine here as well."
"Great Decor, Food Very Average","I am a Singaporean and I brought a friend from overseas to have a paranakan experience. The decor attracted me to select this restaurant. Pictures of food in the web-site also seemed good to me. No disappointment on the decor department. However, the food is very average. Many nonya restaurants at less than half the price provide food far better than this restaurant."
Lovely environment and good food,Came for the first time and was impressed with the decoration. Everything is so authentic. Good service and value for money. Should try the local gin as well. Of coz alcohol is not cheap in Singapore.
Eat While Getting Immersed,"The Peranakan, Claymore Connection

The Peranakan first struck me as part restauarant and part museum.

It is filled with Straits Chinese knick-knacks (or antiques, depending on your point of view)- while more examples are displayed outside and next door in their gallery. I believe many are for sale — just ask.

The old-style furniture adds to the atmosphere and even the tooth pick holders are ornate. Old Malay pop tunes playing over the speakers complete the touch.

So these features heighten expectations of the food. But let me caution you that taste is very subjective. While some folks may say their family will do a certain dish differently, Peranakan folks are more likely to claim their family does it better.

I had my eye on their degustation menu but that required at least a day’s notice. That left me with limited choices as many dishes were ‘family sized’, meant for four diners and I was dining solo.

I started with the soup Bakwan Kepiting: a broth of pork, prawn and crab, with two meat balls of the same meats. The broth came with a nice fragrance of shellfish. I would have preferred the meat balls to be more rustic: coarsely chopped, roughly formed and more heavily seasoned. But that’s just me.

I had my eye on the braised pork leg or Babi Pongteh. Ordering that will mean excluding other dishes. Restaurant manager Peter Wong said he would try to arrange for me to get a smaller portion of that dish.

I had to try the Ayam Buah Keluak: chicken cooked with the keluak. It came piquant with a slight tang and an ornate little spoon to scoop out the black and mushy contents from the nut.

I also had to have the meat and liver Ngoh Hiang roll, to be eaten with a sweet sauce.

Since durians were in season, I ordered the durian pengat dessert, durian mash with a drizzle of coconut sugar.

I was sated but wish I could have tried more dishes. Mr Wong says a set lunch of two meats and one vegetable dish is in the works to allow diners more choices. That sounds great.

The Peranakan, located at the start of the Orchard shopping belt, is one way for tourists to immerse themselves in Peranakan culture, if only for the span of a meal."
Peranakan restaurant just off Orchard Road,We ate here as a group of 6. The decor is bright and a bit over the top. Service is good. Food is tasty but presentation is unremarkable. I felt it was reasonable value for money.
Overpriced,"You can't miss the restaurant, with its bright lights and opulent decor. Price is on the high side for the area. Serving size was small. We had the beef rendang, pork satay, fish and chicken, but I liked only the chicken. There was a variety of desserts too."
Orchard Rd location,"The moment you walked into the restaurant, you observed that this place is very Peranakan with all its wares, crockery and decor. Even the customers and their children came dressed in kebayas. You can also buy kebayas and all Peranakan accessories at the shop adjacent to the restaurant.
I find the food quite authentic especially the ayam buah keluak (chicken in sauce) and the bakwan kepiting (meat balls soup).
The four other dishes comprising two vegetables, one ngoh hiang (fried spring rolls) one Kueh pie tee (only four shells) were ordinary. but the servings were small
We ordered three beers for the four of us. Desserts are very expensive and we had two portions. The chendol was not great with little coconut. Service is good but when the servings are small and the price is expensive, you hesitate to visit again."
"Very good, even if there’s no durian, pecan or aloevera for your clan at The Peranakan","The décor is in the flamboyant style of Peranakan (rather than the discrete style like True Blue Cuisine), but it’s charming nonetheless. The food is very good, although the signature Nasi Ulam is less fragrant and delish than the version made by my Nonya friends at home. The Assam Pedas Fish Head and the Sup Bakwan Kepiting are yummy, though. The service staff are very helpful, even if they don’t roam the dining room often. A bit pricey, but all good Baba-Nonya restaurants in Singapore are."
5🌟 restaurant,"My wife and I had lunch here and all I can say is. Great service, great food and fantastic staff We hope to be able to visit again"
Craving for Peranakan Food,Checked for “Best Peranakan Restaurant in Singapore” and this place was found in a few sites. Very pleased with the service. We had our choices from the “unofficial” vegetarian menu and was extremely satisfied with the assem fish. The pie tee was superb!
"Authentic, served with skill and wit and best of all delicious","We were intrigued by the menu and the particular style of the restaurant. Wow, a real find. From the moment we entered, until we left, we were treated like VIPs. Each dish was explained, recommendations given in a polite and informative way and all done with a superb sense of enjoyment. The starter was sublime... vegetarian spring rolls filled with amazing vegetables. The ‘top hats’ filled by us at the table, lovely. The beef rendang was tender, succulent and well spiced, pork belly melt in the mouth delicious. Excellent. The service was perfect, just the right amount of attention, lovely sense of humour and when we left, it felt like leaving a place where you feel relaxed and at home give it a go !"
Authentic peranakan food,Food was authentic and ambience was great. We had the Tok Panjang set and the choice of spread was great. Don’t miss visiting the Peranakan gallery next door.
Family celebration,"Wonderful service staff. We have a party of over 40 people with young children. The staff remains attentive and friendly throughout the 3+ hour celebration.

The food is wonderful. Very good peranakan food. Too many dishes to mention.

The cocktails are very generous in liquor.

Thank you."
Great experience,Authentic peranakan food. Awesome food and service. Would definitely recommend people going there to eat! :)
"Great ambience, food & service","If you want try good Peranakan food, this is the place for you. The food is not too salty and is great and they have a good high tea set serving delicious desserts. A definite plus point is the service there."
The food is indeed authentic,"A friend suggested this place for a long overdue meet-up, and that’s how the rest of our party of 7 ended up at this restaurant. We ordered the set which was a little ambitious given the large number of dishes.

All-in-all, the food is indeed authentic, and some of the dishes served are not easily found in other Peranakan eateries both in Singapore and Malaysia, as explained by a member of our group who is Peranakan. However, do expect to pay a bit for the dining experience, as ours came up to about $68 per head, excluding service charges and taxes, and other ancillaries.

There is also a smallish exhibit (Peranakan Museum) and gift shop selling Peranakan clothings, etc."
Great experience,This is the place you shall go if you want to experience the Peranakan culture and its authentic cuisine. Their foods contain no MSG and really delicious! The place is quite vibrant with beautiful decor and the staffs are friendly.
Great ambience!,Great experience being a Peranakan for the first time in a while. Enriching and traditional ambience along with finest Peranakan cuisine that I didn’t know some well-known dishes are belonged to Peranakan culture until this day. It was fun learning!
Great experience,Superb peranakan food. Great service. Cozy atmosphere. We will be definitely back again! Loved the dry laksa
Great peranakan cuisine,"Beautiful decor of this place was reflective of the peranakan culture and dining there provided an interesting experience accompanied with a variety of food and drinks. It was my first time trying peranakan cuisine which was delicious and unique! The staff were attentive and demonstrated great service towards my friends and me, making us feel comfortable."
High Tea Buffet,"The ambience was so awesome and made me feel like a tai tai when I was invited by Jia Yi for a high tea yesterday afternoon. The waiters were so friendly and professional that I’m willingly to come again for another round of high tea.

I could bring my family to share the unique atmosphere! And btw, the Nasi Ulam Istimewa is my number 1 fried rice!"
The Peranakan food was like heaven in my mouth!,"The Peranakan food was really like heaven in my mouth! Absolutely delicious! Not only food, their services are great and nice! In addition, the decoration of that restaurant is beautiful and it has cozy atmosphere! It's been my first time being a Peranakan. It's such a great experience and learning about history and culture of Peranakan!"
Modest and sophisticated with excellent service and ambiance,"Didn't regret coming here! Modest and sophisticated with excellent service and ambiance. Great service from the staff as well! Not only had good food, but I also had the opportunity to learn about the history and the culture of Peranakan!"
Straits Cuisine (Peranakan) in Orchard Rd Yummy local cuisine & bit of history in one,"Opulent setting in traditional Peranakan style, bright, bold and cheerful. So are the service staffs, who always cheerful and helpful. The food boasts of traditional recipes handed down from three generations of babas & nonyas. Definitely more elegant in terms of flavor/spice usage, which have a wider appeal. Must try the kuey pietee, sambal prawns with petai and beef rendang! Yummy food and abit of history in one!"
Nice Authentic,Very nice and authentic peranakan food you can get here! Had all the usual peranakan dishes kepenting ayam buak keluak chap chye kueh pietee sambal prawn assam fish head omelette with chincharo not forgetting beef rendang too. Not many places in Singapore that serves such a good meal in nice decor!
Food taste good n our French guests were delighted to taste such lovely cuisine. Bravo!,The buah keluak and nasi ulam were eye openers and our guests love it.... they were amused with the little baskets of sambal crackers.
Great Food Selection,We tried the High Tea for $35++ on the weekend and the food looked and tasted amazing! Durian Penyat abit sweet but others were nice.
Trying and meh......,"There is a one for one promotion if you followed them on Facebook .

The high tea is a fixed platter of small bites and not buffet as we first thought .

Still the taste is meh .... and most of it is not warm .

The atmosphere was good for family chit chat but the food is not worth the amount . The old Uncle service attitude I rate as 5/10 .

Could have been better. Below expectations for Peranakan food .

Smiley"
intro to Nonya food,"If this is your first taste and experience of Nonya or Peranakan food, you will enjoy the sight, smell and taste of the food and the drama surrounding the presentation when food is ready to be served at your table. The OTT deco can be fascinating or distracting according to personal tastes but the adjacent gallery and retail cultural section is food for the eyes and curious mind."
Tok Panjang,"Great place to have a sample Perankan culture, they offer a glimpse of a tok panjang setting, chi kee game, some jewlery, photographs, a small gift shop...

Food wise for those who are have never tried, their tok panjang maybe ok....

Those who tasted home cooked nonya from granny kitchen n recall the flavors, don't bother, the taste will never be be the same ....."
"Excellwnt service, Beautiful decor, delicious food","Excellent service at The Peranakan! The dishes were well presented and tasted just right with flavours not too overly powerful. Those who like strong flavours may find it blend, but it works for me personally."
"Amazing food, Great ambience and Wonderful service","Food was fantastic. We had ordered a ayam buah keluak, babi sate, sotong, kueh pie ti….quite a few dishes. Even with the prosecco it came up to about $300 for 6 people which isn't a lot if you considered the sheer amount of mains plus all the deserts we ordered. I don't think there was a miss at all in the food, everything was very good and we consumed pretty much all the food on all the plates. On top of that the staff were amazing and so friendly. Steven especially was great in suggesting food, and even after taking us through some of the items in the Peranakan Gallery next door and explaining the purpose of the restaurant and the settings that were chosen. It was overall a great family experience which we are likely to do again."
Excellent Peranakan Experience,Ambience was really nice; spoke so well of Peranakan culture. Food was good; the kuih2 were painstakingly prepared. So dainty and pretty. Certainly an excellent place to bring guests from overseas.
Not great,"Peranakan is a hybrid cuisine that probably should have been relegated to the history books.

This restaurant was chosen for a unique cultural experience but unfortunately it did not deliver.

The decor is overdone and gaudy. The amount of cheap chandeliers per square metre of ceiling is quite astonishing.

The service is overfamiliar and keen to upsell - beware the strange boxes of dried shrimp they set the tables with - these are not free.

The food was one note in texture, lacked flavour and wasn’t exceptionally warm in temperature.

The “unlimited” rice seemed to be quite closely guarded.

Recommend steering clear."
Authentic food and service,"The decor of this place is a little over the top, screaming its Peranakan identity in case you missed it in the restaurant name. But once you get past that, the friendly service puts you at ease and the authentic Peranakan food makes for a wonderful meal. Not cheap, but worthwhile for a special occasion."
Highly Impressive,"The restaurant, located on the 2nd floor, stood out from a distance as it also doubles up as a retail outlet and museum, with its numerous Peranakan wares displayed at the spaces outside the restaurant. The restaurant boasts floral wallpaper and mirrors lined its walls. I was personally amazed by the attention to details and authenticity right down to the uniforms of the staff.

We are greeted at the entrance and brought into the restaurant by its ever-friendly host. We were attended to by Chris, who made a particularly memorable and lasting impression with his knowledge, hospitality, friendliness and charm. He also very nicely accommodated to our needs as we had two wheelchair-bound individuals in our party.

Our reservations were made for high tea and this was presented in a big rattan tray filled with delicious authentic Peranakan food ranging from Kueh Pie Tee and Durian Penyat to Pineapple Tarts and Ayam Buah Keluak. The food was appropriately laid out in servings of 4 as there were 4 of us.

Overall a most pleasant and enjoyable dining experience, this is a highly recommended Straits Chinese restaurant right in the heart of Orchard Road."
Wonderful high-tea,"Enchanting environment, good food, great service and reasonable price. I think this place has an unique charm. I will definitely go again!"
A Restaurant Not to be Missed.,"The food was good and if one likes spicy food, this is the place to eat. Everything that was served to us, was served with pride. One must go and experience it. The decor and restaurant was nicely decorated and it is a restaurant worth eating it. Service staff were friendly too."
Best peranakan food,At least in the Orchard road area. Better than our previous favourite with a similar name. We’ll be going there more often.
Family gathering,"Invited to this Peranakan restaurant by our relatives. We ordered prawn and meat roll. Beef rendang, Assam Fish Head, mixed Vegetables,chicken Buakaluak, chendol, sour sop drink, lemon grass drink. The food in general is ok. But all the food flavors lack of the spice aroma and fragrant. The restaurant is very beautiful and have displayed that represent the Peranakan culture. Service is very poor. After taking orders, and food served, no more follow up table service to tidy up the dining tables. No changing of plates and drink service. You can’t even find a service staff to order additional drinks. Staff gathered behind the bar chatting. Our prawn rolls was served after our main course. The food presentation and flavors plus the poor service does not match the menu prices and the environment of the restaurant. The restaurant owner needs to take note particularly the service staff who are too slack in their service. The restaurant manager performance requires scrutinization ! Will not go back again!"
Authentic taste of home,"It's my third time back here in less than a year since we discovered this gem. Every time a friend comes back home to Singapore from overseas, this is our go-to place to indulge in a taste of home. We tend to over order all the time because everything is just so good! Must haves: Get either the fish or chicken curry plus a rendang or the ayam buah keluak."
Decent Peranakan restaurant,Chances upon this restaurant simply because it was near where my friend was staying. Food and service was surprisingly good. Prices are reasonable too. Just a stone’s throw from busy Orchard Road. Has nice Peranakan decor. Will go again if friends from abroad visit.
True Peranakan experience,"An unforgettable experience having dinner at the Peranakan Orchard. Management and staff are to be commended on their professionalism and dedication to the authentic Peranakan experience. Well done to all , hope to see you in Melbourne Australia sharing the beauty of the Peranakan culture"
Nice authentic nyonya high tea set,"The high tea set was presented in a big bamboo tray, complete with mini tingkats serving different items. Love this unusual presentation which brings you back to a homely peranakan setting. Food quality are of decently above average standard."
Fun family style restaurant,We visited Peranakan for a friends birthday and had a blast. The food is very good and the lazy susan on many of the tables makes sharing easy. We enjoyed a number of the dishes and felt like we had a true Malaysian experience. The staff are very entertaining and made a fuss of the birthday boy (pictured)
great,great food great atmosphere something a little different the little history museum next door was an added bonus
Delicious food in a beautiful setting,"Came here with a weekend lunch reservation with my cousin. It's not my first visit, I've been here before and was really impressed with the experience, hence the return.We went with the Peranakan High Tea, which was a nice balance of sweet and savoury items, served with tea. The presentation and the taste of the food were equally good.We just felt slightly uncomfortable how the waiter was being quite pushy with upselling us the Tok Panjang when we had already decided we wanted the High Tea. There is no need to pressure guests or diners into changing their minds! Honestly, it made us feel awkward and embarrassed during the meal, and afterwards."
Lovely people and delicious food,"Very nice attentive people and more delicious food . Better than Malacca true peranakan food , I would say . They deserve a Michelin Star ! Lovely deco . Very clean and the details to their restaurant is astonishing"
"Phenomenal ambiance, great food, and decent prices!","The ambiance is over the top but in the best way possible as it details the Peranakan lifestyle and culture! The food itself is also very traditional and authentic - I'm from Malaysia and Melaka specialises in Peranakan food so I have comparisons. Overall, if you fancy some good food in general then head here!"
The word is “Yummy”,"Excellent service, nice ambience and most importantly..... wonderful tasty food! First time trying Peranakan food and if I want to use a word to describe, the word will be “Yummy!”"
Lovely Peranakan food at Orchard,Lovely and charming ambience and delicious food. Some interesting dishes such as the nasi ulam istimewa. Try it!
Nice Hi-Tea at Strong Peranakan Ambiance,"We went for their 1 for 1 promo for the Super Sedap Hi-Tea; not ala cart or buffet style. You can opt for it if you want to.

Quite worth it as there are a wide varieties of Peranakan foods.

The service staff and managers hospitality are really nice. Treat us like friends and explain to us the food items for the Hi-tea.

The restaurant has an extremely strong Peranakan culture and embiance. Makes you feels like you are in the Peranakan world!

They also have a few units displaying Peranakan antiques, food and stuffs."
Awesome and authentic peranakan food,Brought some of my friends over for dinner. The service staff patiently went through the menu with us since we are novice with peranakan food. Love the great selection and spice that came with the food. Highly recommended for families and friends!
Very nice place love it so much!,If you are craving for Peranakan food pls do come and visit here. The food is so authentic with nice presentation. Boss Mr Raymond is a very friendly and serves customer well. Will definitely come back again. SUPERB!!!!
An interesting experience,Good food and good service. The chef personally came by to explain the preparation of some of the dishes that we ordered. It was an enriching and enjoyable dinner.
"Awful, terrible, and plain horrible for vegetarians","This probably wouldn't be the first place a vegetarian would choose to eat, but ended up with a large group and was happy to see a note at the bottom of the menu that vegetarian options were available. Upon asking the server for vegetarian items for two of our guests, he said nothing was available and suggested some mutton and laughed in our faces. This was plain rotten service, regardless of your thoughts on people's dietary preferences. The man was happy to see the two vegetarians in our party eat plates of white rice while the rest of the table feasted on meat-only dishes. It was an awful experience and the service was dreadful and definitely ruined our night."
I celebrated my 75th Birthday with 130 friends from the travel industry as well as my family,"My guests were amazed at the colourful decor of The Peranakan @ Claymore Connect. It showcases the rich heritage and culture in its display and cuisine. We had a Tok Panjang Feast.. a special menu, ideal for celebration. The Nonya cuisine is a fusion of Malay and Chinese heritage recipes.
Ray Khoo Owner/Executive Chef with his team went out of their way to ensure a joyous and successful occasion with fine food, wine, music and impeccable service.
Thank you, Ray.
Many of my friends have since brought their family and friends to dine at The Peranakan."
Best Peranakan Food,"This was the best and most authentic Malaccan Peranakan food i’ve had in years. A wonderful array of dishes and tastes cooked with traditional ingredients and style, no shortcuts. Chef very happy to explain recipes and show us ingredients. Staff friendly and helpful. Atmosphere casual and evocative of Peranakan style house. Would definitely go back!"
"Feast for the Eyes, Nose, Taste... Sensory Overload!","Love this place. From the decor, and mini museum, food, service. Everything. I came early and while waiting for friends to arrive, the Maitre D came to explain the gorgeous decor on display, and almost everything for sale. We had the Tasting Menu and loved it. There was just too much to eat, but it's a great way to experience Peranakan cuisine. Our male server must be enamored with us, coz he kept flirting all night long."
"Hyped up, I'm sorry","Premise - damn. It's decor!!! Very authentic. Made me feel like I was in a real Peranakan house. From decor to cutlery, all was very close to a typical Peranakan residential setting.

Location - Claymore Connect. Park at Orchard Hotel. Prep yourself for the hefty tag. Or by public transport. Or park at Orchard Towers.

Staff - Sous Chef Shirley was entertaining. An adorable lady staff was a hot Nonya minx was very nice as well. An elder gent was kinda curd if I may say so but not unruly.

Food - I will be lying if I say all were good. In fact only the beef rendang was dreamy. The chicken buah keluwak has an after taste to it. The bakwan kepiting soup was mild to the taste. We ordered the set meal for 2 but we were 3 and it was good enough to go around.

Desserts - the durian legat had a lil too much durian essence and dat was obvious. The pandan cake with gula melaka n durian puree was nothing more than a basic pandan cake, drizzled with gula melaka, add a dollop of durian puree and flowered with coconut shavings.

Would I go again?
For the food? No.
For the staff? No.
For the environment? Yes.
But I won't pay this time round."
Authentic Amazing Straits Chinese Food,"My partner and I went to this lovely Peranakan restaurant and had the most fantastic experience, real home-cooked delights served in a homely, comfortable atmosphere. The decor has loads of character and the food reflects this also. The Ngoh Hiang was to die for and Ayam Buah Keluak was worth going back for. Highly recommended for those who wish to experience Peranakan food at its best."
Authentic Peranakan Experience From Food To Decor,"We had the most marvellous experience at The Peranakan last weekend, what with the gorgeous food that warms the heart, the service that is attentive and not over-bearing, and the decor that has memorabilia and furnishing that puts you in the most welcoming Peranakan household replete with yesteryear memories and hospitality. So heartened that Singapore has such a place that honours the food and Peranakan heritage in equal measure with such honesty and warmth. And at such a convenient locale no less- a must go for locals and tourists alike!"
Fantastic Peranakan Restaurant,"A real Peranakan experience through their authentic food, décor and service. Very friendly staff and the chef came out to explain their specialties. The Ayam Buah Keluak and Kaki Babi Pong Teh was excellent. Lovely local deserts too. We went with a group of friends for a birthday dinner and the staff sang a surprise happy birthday that made it extra special.

If you are looking for friendly authentic Peranakan experience this is a must try. Very convenient for anyone near Orchard Road."
Colleagues and friends,"A party of five colleagues and friends enjoyed a delicious array of dishes. The staff were very helpful in assisting with explanation and advice. Each dish was perfect from the entrees of top hats and vegetarian spring rolls to the chicken, pork and beef. Our pescatarian member enjoyed the vegetables and prawn dishes. The 3 desserts we shared topped off a delightful evening. Not as expensive as other restaurants we have tried. Good value and delicious food = 5 happy diners."
Good Nonya food and ambience,"Was invited here for a corporate dinner, and it is located in the Claymore Malls which is next to Orchard Hotel. There are a museum and ornaments section to purchase gifts. Food is good with traditional fare of Ayam Bua Klua, soup, PieTee, chicken Assam and beef rendang. Dessert selection is also good. Service is great"
Family Dinner,"I get to find out about this restaurant via Chope platform and booked a table for my family directly from there. This restaurant is located within the shopping mall - Claymore Connect next to Orchard hotel.

Directly outside the restaurant, they do display some Peranakan merchandise like clothing and shoes for the walk-in customer to purchase.

We have ordered Beef Rendang (SGD38 per portion), Kueh Pie Ti - Small (SGD10), Kaki Babi Pongteh (SGD19 per portion). Overall the food is just average wasn't what I have expected based on the reviews I have read.

Service wise I hope they could improve on. They are fast in service but horrible in the attentiveness department. So while my parents were both handfull eating Kueh Pie Ti, the waitress tried to pull their eating plate away as she wants to get her task in getting us steam rice done. Never understand why can't she wait a little while or come back later to serve?

Overall I have spent SGD120 (inclusive of drinks) for our lunch (4pax)."
Dad’s Birthday Celebrations,"Last Saturday, we held a surprise birthday dinner for our Dad. The food was delicious, the decor amazing and the service was top notched. We received free deserts and caffeine free lemongrass tea. Definitely recommend this restaurant for authentic Perankan food."
Mother’s Day with family,"For us it’s first time but my hubby went there once and he loved it. Surprisingly my grandkids are very amused when aunty sang a song about the food we are about to eat. The Peranakan food well presented and very authentic. The appetisers, beef rendang, fish head curry, Ngoh Hiang without liver, chap Chye, buah keluak( Asian truffles), pork ball soup , juicy pork and various desserts are just simply delicious. A must try when in Singapore."
Delicious peranakan food - definite 2 star michelin n above,"The food was delicious and so were the staff
All were very warm
Made us want to come back for more

The staffs were also funny and amusing
Make you feel at ease

I love the durian chendol n the banana pancake

The buak kaluak is also very good
Original no meat inside which makes it delicious"
Good food and good service,"Been here with my families and friends for dinner. Total 5 of us. Tried the blue rice, fried fish with sweet n sour gravy, ngoh hiang, cap chye, babi pongteh, and drinks. Total around $250 which was quite ok for me. The fish dish was superb, other dishes was decent. The chili paste (belacan) was very nice and must try the hee bee with lime, very refreshing. For those who can take spicy, better watch out. The dish that were regret order was cap chye, may be not to our taste. The ambience was nice, a bit crowded but still warm with their hospitality. Feel like home. The décor of the place was peranakan theme, it was good that we can see their heritage. Surely will go there again"
Great food and atmosphere,"I went here with work colleagues, and thoroughly enjoyed the food and overall experience. It's a little hard to find at first, but definitely worth finding. I'd suggest going with a local who knows the history and traditions, and can explain about the food and the different displays that are part of the small museum section in the restaurant."
