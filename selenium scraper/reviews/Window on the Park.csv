"Great service from Praveen, Window on the Park restaurant, Holiday Inn Orchard City Centre","We were staying at this Holiday Inn and had breakfast at the Window on the Park restaurant for about a week. The restaurant staff were helpful and quick to greet people. In particular, we want to commend a wait staff, Parveen, as he was polite and diplomatic with the patrons. For us, it’s always good to be greeted with his cheerful disposition first thing in the morning."
New year family vacation to Singapore,"Pretty good breakfast buffet with wide variety of food. We appreciate nicely services from Praveen, who prepared us decent Cappuccino every morning."
Awesome Food & Great service,"We went there for team bonding and had a amazing time! The chefs were friendly, always smiling! Nitin and the rest of the service crew were providing great customer service! Food was really good too! Will come again!!"
Christmas Menu,"The spread is reasonable for the price. Staff is nice and attentive. Liked the seafood mornay, mashed potatoes is super good, spicy lala, satay and their christmas log cake."
Good food (Indian cuisine especially) and friendly staff,"Had a staycation here and went for the buffet breakfast. Spread was good! In particular, the Indian cuisine was excellent! Authentic and tasty! Surendar was our waiter for the day and was fast in his service and friendly. He even prepared cappuccinos to go for us! ☺️☺️☺️"
Great food and customer service,Praveen provided the best customer service. Everyone was nice. Great food and customer service. Excellent location. Good clean rooms.
High Tea,"From the beginning to the end, the service was terrible. Only our table (4 adults and 3 children) and one other were booked for high tea and there was hardly anyone to service us. High tea food selection was the bare minimum. The waiters were rude and busy talking outside. We had to call them each time for service. Beverages were not filled, and no one came to ask us anything. What a horrible experience and had to pay so much. Never will I step into this restaurant - Windows on the Park and will share my bad experience with others too."
Good food. Excellent service!,Loved this place! Food was good and service was amazing. Shoutout to Helena for being awesome! She definitely makes the dining experience better. Thank you Helena!
TERRIBLE FOOD,"Fried Been Hoon was so salty
Lobster was so salty
Food Standard Drop So Much
since i last came ….So Disappointed"
Delicious food and awesome service,"100% recommend this restaurant to families with young kids. Not only do they have a good range for adults at their breakfast buffet, they also have thought of kids and have a seperate kids corner. Service is excellent! Staff are all very friendly and helpful- Shout out to Sasi, Siri and Vignesh. Thank you for making our stay a memorable one."
Biz lunch,"The food is authentic. Service team provided excellent service (Mr. Ghosh & Ms. Helena as well as Mr. Sasi).
Would certainly recommend friends to try. Looking forward to come back again..."
Very good stay,"We had breakfast at window on the park every morning. What made this so special was the waitress Helana. Amazing service with a smile and very good knowledge.
Highly recommend"
Great Place!,"I loved coming to this place, a wonderful breakfast buffet right after my long 9 hour flight. It has a HUGE variety of foods, and even a little kids food section. I adored the music, and the overall layout of the buffet, tons of greenery were surrounding us. All the staff were very pleasant, helping you out at all times, and they always had a big heartwarming smile on there face. A very special thanks to Helena for helping us out, and giving us our best experience."
Perfect start for the day,"Fresh fruits, muesli, poached eggs from live cooking station... everything you can hope from breakfast accompanied with friendly and helpful staff."
‘Some Like It Hot” Sep-Oct 2022 Ala Carte Buffet Dinner,"The price for 1 for 1 buffet at $130 ++ is on the high side considering the quality of food on the menu when compared to other hotel similar offerings. The cold sea food spread offered on platter is disappointing as most of the items are not defrosted properly before being taken out . Oysters and Sashimi are ok. We end up eating mainly oysters and sashimi rather than other food offered on the buffet spread. However , the service was good . Helena and Farhan took well care of our needs and is always there to serve us with a smiley face."
Wonderful Service!,"We were greeted warmly by Bala, the manager. He was very patient and explain the different promotions available. During our dinner buffet, both Farhan and Mina was very attentive and cleared our table promptly and efficiently.

The spread of food was not bad. Quite a number of seafood spread and variety of options. The laksa, satay and mala seafood highly recommended.

Another commendable gesture was that the chef, Frachis helped to cook up some mock meat and prepare special food for one our colleague that was a vegetarian. Really very sweet gesture of going out of the way for customers. Everyone of us had such enjoyable experience. Thank you yo all the wonderful staffs"
expensive,food are limited. very little spread. no special highlight. Costly and not worth it.. very disapponted.
"Good Service, nice restaurant","I took up an offer of buy one, get one to have the buffet lunch at this restaurant. The food was a modest size spread and had some very nice options, food was of reasonably good quality. The restaurant had very good service and dishes were cleared away immediately and overall service was great. The problem with this restaurant was the buffet was advertised and priced as a seafood buffet but this was not really the case. I could only find 2 seafood dishes available. The price was over $100 per person for lunch which is pricey even for Singapore, luckily I had booked under the buy one get one offer but even after taking advantage of this offer the lunch did not really feel like good value."
Fantastic breakfast offering and service,"We ( family of 4-2 adults and 2 kids under 10) recently visited Singapore from the US. We stayed at the Holiday Inn at Orchard and took breakfast at the hotel restaurant. We were absolutely impressed and excited to see the breakfast spread, the cleanliness and the professionalism of the staff. It was a delightful experiences for our kids and us alike. We would like to offer our sincere thanks to Vik, Helena and their team for their excellent service."
Family holiday,"We attended the restaurant both for breakfast and dinner. Staff were very helpful,a young man called Sashi was very attentive as was the floor manager Bala who went out of his way to help us.I also spoke to the presentation chef Teck Wee and had numerous conversations with him about the food having worked in hospitality some years ago,he is a young man dedicated to his craft.One thing that everyone of the staff had in common was an honesty about themselves talking of there respective backgrounds where they came from and where they are all heading to in the future .These people I will never forget.Thanks to all who made this holiday special"
Breakfasts during work trip,Plenty of great breakfast options buffet style and helpful service. Helena was very attentive and friendly!
Company Dinner,Good Vibes. Helena was very kind and served us with the highest of standards. The Aircon could be a little colder though.
Window on the Park Service,Good food and ambience. The waiters Helena and Farhan were kind to attend our needs and were very attentive.
Pleasant dining experience,"My second visit here. Food choices were plenty. Staff were prompt and courteous in their service delivery. Their signature black pepper lobster is SHIOK!

Special mention to one of your staff, Mr Nitin, for going the extra mile in his service delivery. I had a few kids during dinner and he was kind to ask their dining preferences and helped serve to the table for them. Keep up the good work!"
Buffet Dinner on thursday,"This place is absolutely the worst buffet in Singapore. Bad food, very late in refilling, and the 50% discount for credit card and eatigo is not correct. Its 150 per pax, worst than all the 5 star hotel and they are not upfront.

Would not come here anymore."
An experience NEVER to forget and forgive,"We booked a 1-for-1 buffet at WBTP Holiday Inn Orchard for lunch on Sat 28.05.22 via Chope. I booked based on your price at $98+++(1-1) for a Seafood spread. What a “HUGH” spread it was! It was not buffet style but a-la-carte and the captain said was due to the small crowd size. The so-called seafood on the ice: miserable pieces of mussels, scallops on broken shells, small prawns, some ‘gong-gong’, all NOT fresh, salad and 5 types desserts offered! However what shocked us was the price: from $98+++ to $150+++pax, an overnight price change! A daylight robbery indeed!!!"
CELEBRATION,"Wonderful dinner. Excellent service from staff. Surprise birthday cake from restaurant. Special thanks to Ramesh, Nitin, Fahran and the others."
Food & staff were amazing!,"Lovely vibes from the staff, constantly asking if we need anything. The food was wonderful and with a rich taste. Definitely recommended!"
Awesome staffs and wonderful service.,Staffs were very warmth with their services and food was delicious. Must try the rendang and butter chicken!!
Great Service by Helena,Helena was fantastic and gave us a lot of attention during our dinner. She was very assistive to our request and an excellent gem for Holiday Inn
Great Service-!,"Went for walk in and left number as they are fully booked. Didn’t expect there will be a place, almost went to another place. Within 1 hour receive call with good news, so went back and have a wonderful time and dinner, thank you Vik for the follow up and great service~!"
Window on the Park,"Rendang & butter chicken is good, prawns were fresh. Chili crab could be better. Friendly servers..."
Great Service ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡,"Came down to break fast on 11 April 2022.
Service from when we entered, we were served with warmth.
The servers were prompt, great initiative, and polite.
Special mention to an indian lady / server (didn't get her name), who made us feel at ease because we had 3 kids under 4years dining with us.

We definitely had a memorable night.
Thank you."
Lovely Experience!,Great ambience and food. Came here for a birthday celebration break fast and my partner and I are super satisfied with the service! Balbeer has been super friendly and the other staff members too!
Ramadhan Buffet 2022,Good ambience. Wide variety of foods. Very good service. All the staffs are friendly and offered excellent customer service. Ms Helena shows a high standard of customer service. For sure will return again. The price are reasonable too.
Ramadan Buffet,Served by such wonderful staff at Windows by the park. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming and made the effort to ensure that we were comfortable and we have everything we need. Helena and Balbeer were especially friendly and really ensured we had a good meal. Thank you.
Ramadhan Buffet 2022,"Ambience is nice & good is good but the thing tt makes this visit enjoyable is their friendly staff...
Their smiles & effort to put in extra help are always thier priority...
Cheers to Helena who has served me & my friends... She has gone her extra mile to make my visit memorable...
Well done guys"
First Ramadhan Buffet for us,The ramadhan buffet was okay. Food wise tasty.. I don't really care about spread as long as the food is tasty. Service was fantastic. The staffs are very helpful & friendly. We have Robin checking on us to see if everything is okay and I think it's so nice of him to do so :)
Disappointing visit to Window on the Park,The spread was not much. The hotel to serve individual diner one-to-one but they are not sufficiently staff. I had to request for my latte a few times before I actually received it cos they insisted to serve it to your table but they just couldnt cope and couldnt remember your order. The restaurant was not even filled to the brim. Dread to think of how it is gg to be like if the restaurant is full capacity. And the dinner at $120/pax is WAY overpriced for what the spread it served.
Unforgettable Service,"Helena was our server, she was very attentive to our needs. Food is awesome! Great ambience, will return - definitely!"
Iftar / breaking of fast,Amazing service from Helena! Friendly decisive and very prompt. Food was amazing and everyone is so nice and polite. Will definitely come back ! Special thanks to Robin & Helena for their exceptional service
Attentive service,"The staff were very attentive and happy to assist with requests. The food was good, especially the Faloush salad."
Iftar on 9th April 2022,It was our first having iftar here. The food was awesome. The staffs were all very friendly and helpful especially Helena. Her service was tiptop. Good food paired with great service made our dining a memorable one. Will definitely come back and recommend this place to friends/family
Iftar Buffet 2022 Window On The Park Cafe,"A little known Iftar Buffet in Singapore. Great food selection encompassing local favourites as well as International fare. Tender morsels of rendang, Rojak, Pasta, Naan & Chili Crab vying for your attention. The velvety smooth and creamy Pengat Durian is a must try! Traditional kuihs abound. All specially prepared by Chef Ashrul Yusuf. Customer focused service helmed by Ramesh. The dining experience is enhanced by the ever friendly Helena, Farhan, Robin & Nitin who will ensure your food and drinks are served promptly."
Variety of food served not worth what we paid for,"Food variety is very limited. We were done eating pretty fast as there was not much to choose from. Although there was a 1 for 1 promotion, the original cost per pax is $90. We dined in at 3 other hotel buffets which cost around the same price and the variety served was 3 to 4 times more. Service and ambience were good though. Due to the lack of food variety, we would not be coming back again."
Good to try but wont come again,Food portion is good and quality is not too bad however the service was not great as some of the orders were missed and relatively slow given that we were the ONLY ones there on a Monday night. The waiter was not too sure with the dishes as well. Place was clean and nice for dining.
Lunch buffet with family,"The buffet with QR scan code is not efficient. Ordered food was slow, came out 20mins for soup and 40mins later for mains. Cakes took 15mins! Helena our waitress was so helpful, helped us in checking the order and put us on priority. Bala the waiter was also quick in the service recovery. Food was good, serving was sufficient for one pax. Good to order all and savour."
Chill,The food serves in hot great . The staff here is very friendly . Espically the staff whose name Helena she a very good and kind lady . Everyone of the staff is very kind and helpful.
Dinner,"Good service by Helena, Robin and Viknesh.They made our visit enjoyable and comfortable. Ambience is nice for a quiet gathering."
Dinner buffet,Enjoy the food very much. Robin and the teams are very friendly and attend to us promptly. Thank u team
Buffet dinner,"Food was excellent. Service too. They were polite and helpful in assisting in ordering. Special thanks to Helena, Robin and Viknesh. Great dinner 😊."
Nice food and service,The only buffet that serves shellout. Value for money and service is good too. Nice and cozy ambience
I felt so satisfied with the services provided. Thumb up Guys.,Very friendly staff especially Ms Helena who such a wonderful and jovial staff. Make my lunch here with my wife enjoyed
Excellent food and service,"The food was fantastic. The service was top notch. Helena, in particular, was an amazing server. She speedily brought us what we needed to make our meal more enjoyable. Highly recommend!"
family dinner,The customer service was excellent here however not much of food selection during dinner. Worth the money for family on budgets but still want to enjoy the hotel spread. Thanks to rubin and vicknesh for their kind gesture and assistance during our dinner. It was a pleasant dinner here. Will love to come here again for their high tea next.
Great food. Even greater service!,"The shell out was delicious! The buffet is so good as well, especially the dessert. What stood out the most for me was the spectacular service by Helena. 100% would recommend."
Good service,The place was good and the staff was super friendly. The shell out was great. Compliment to helenA for her service..
Service!,"Even though they’re low on manpower, they make sure they attend to everyone! Especially Robin, super accommodating and a very friendly guy! Thank you fir serving us!"
Sumptuous Spread!,"First time dining at Window On The Park and I was real surprised with everything served. Honestly I didn't have any expectation but through what I savoured, it just blew my mind! Totally love everything served, from the big portion to the neat plating and most importantly, super delicious taste of each dish. The chilli crab sauce seafood shellout is to die for (coming from someone who don't even fancy shellout)!

Service staff were quite attentive, friendly and definitely professional. A quick shout out to Balbeer for making my dining experience great by attending to all requests promptly. Also to the whole team behind the scene in ensuring diners leave with a happy and bloated tummy!

Overall, I highly recommend this Halal buffet restaurant which not only serve awesome goodies, but is also value for money! While there are limited varieties especially in the starter & dessert section, the superb taste of every single thing served, more than made up for it. Time to check WOTP out, if you haven't. They definitely made me smile..."
good service,The restaurant provides excellent service and fairly good food. Food can be much better but nevertheless the staff is good. Balbeer went across the mile by serving us fruits that we initially wanted to order.
Mrs.,What I like about the most is the friendly attitude of Helena. She is so accomodating and approachable.. Very service oriented. Thumbs up!
Very good service,Balbeer gave us excellent service. Thank you for the great service and food. Definitely will return!
Great food and service!,This was actually our 2nd visit already. Great service. Special thanks to Helena. Great food as well! We will definitely come back.
"Great service, fresh seafood & good portions!","Had a great time at buffet lunch at Windows On the Park! It's our first time dining here as it serves Halal Lunch & Dinner buffets. We were warmly greeted by Helena Goh who were there for us from order to end of our meal. Really great customer service from her & make us feel comfortable. It costs us $105 for 2 pax lunch buffet and parking is $1.20/hr. Highly recommended if you're looking for halal buffet with your family, friends or colleagues!"
Birthday dinner,"Ambience, service and food was great. Staff Helena was very patient n attend to our requests. Really enjoyed my quiet fam dinner. Will definitely come back again! :)"
first time visit,i just want to thank Ms helena for excellent service..the food is 👍 but the chili crab a bit sour like a lot of tomato.but overall is very good taste specially then mushroom and cheese
Dinber with friends,Very well accomodating staff especially Ms Helena.. She makes sure everything are okay and made us very comfortable during our dinner.. Foods are also very nice! Thank yOu! Will come back for sure.
1-for-1 CNY buffet dinner,"The staff is really attentive, friendly and helpful, always try their best to serve despite the covid restriction. We’ve had a pleasant experience dining at the place!

We’re given appetiser and seafood shell-out, which we can snack on while waiting for the buffet queue.

The buffet selection is honestly great and that the each selection is tasty on the day we went. The butter garlic salmon is to die for and the lychee rose cake stood out among the dessert.

The only downside is due to covid restriction, the food has to be served by the staff instead. Still, the staff tend to give us generous portion too, have to let them know if you prefer fewer bites.

PS: Thanks for the wonderful evening!"
Head chef on leave? The cooking is not even up to 1 star.,"Was here for the cny lunch buffet on day 2 of the cny. Was first served with cny appetiser which included yu sheng. But there after the food was really horrible. Food was cold., salty and badly cooked. Even the egg tart was a failure. To be fair the serving staff were very nice. Just the food... not worth paying for.

You can get 50% for the buffet but even then it is not worthy to eat here."
Good service,Thanks to farhan and assistant manager mr anand for awesome service and good service. will come again. Good job.
Excellent service and great food,"Love the food. Was super full by the time we left the restaurant. Staff there always smiling and happy, make the whole experience so much better. Thank you for making our experience great."
Afternoon Hi Tea,The food was delicious and portion for the adult hi tea set was sufficient. The kids hi tea set was amazing and generous portion. The staff were super friendly and accommodating. It was my son’s birthday and they gave extra treats for my kids. We had a lovely afternoon! Thank you for the amazing service
Terrible food,Expensive Buffet lunch. Not value for money. The selection of Dim sum is just 2 pcs of kaya bao. What a joke.
Service was amazing,"Wana give praise specially to these two person that served me at noon , one young man which show me in , not know his name , helping me on WiFi also introduced me nice dish ( poke bowl salad ), another lady name Helena was an Angel that helping me pack up food when knowing that I'm a small eater . Always come near my table and see what can help me .
They were so polite and heart warming, always trying to help. I love the embient of this window seat. Able to look out the greenery and feel peace to do my work and enjoy my brunch .
Thank you for both

Will not return (!!),"Attended international buffet for christmas with 8 pax (Paid $58 per pax after 1 for 1)

Food quality was only worth $20 max in our opinion - Majority of the dishes were very mediocre/ singapore coffeeshop quality. Chicken served was also severely undercooked and still bloody.

Due to covid restrictions, buffet is now served by staff who takes the food for you but you still have to queue for a long time. Took about 20 mins before we got our first dishes.

Saving grace for the place are their very friendly staff members who are helpful and polite.

Will not recommend coming here. Very overpriced and not yummy food."
Delicious food but understaffed,"The international buffet was delicious and they had a variety of food at the window at the park restaurant. The waitstaff were very friendly and helpful. But we had to wait very long for our food to be served. I think the restaurant should consider hiring more staff. This will help improve the overall service. A huge thank you to the very kind and helpful Helena at window at the park restaurant. Even though the restaurant was very busy and understaffed, Helena made sure that we received all our orders. The restaurant was closing but she still allowed us to put in our orders for our desserts. Thank you so much Helena for your wonderful service, we really appreciate it❤️"
Company Dinner,"Had our company dinner here at Window on the Park. Enjoyed the dinner service along with the great service of the team. Just needs some time to get used to the QR Code ordering with the buffet as you need to confirm your order a couple of times so we thought that the orders wasnt coming in, but overall, the food served was great and the staffs were always there to assist you."
Unimpressive experience saved by service star.,"Unimpressed by the service & the food. Restaurant was heavily understaffed. We waited very long for the food. Strangely, desserts came before the mains & appetiser. We had an enjoyable experience nonetheless with Helena as the saving grace. Her patience and commitment shines beyond the others, going the extra mile in her service."
1 for 1 ala carte buffet,"Service:
During dinner hr, there seems to be a lack of staffs who knows what is happening. Food seems to be flying out, but to the wrong tables

Food:
Seafood shell-out looks fantastic, but the seafood was not cook fully, with the crab meat stuck to shell (if U know what it means).

Appetizers - flavourful. Chicken satay is tasty, baguette is nicely toasted. Overall rating of about 7/10

Main course - a big let down, with a tough lamb chop that is hard to chew, laksa that is so thick but doesn't taste delightful.

Desserts - tried the mango dessert and fruit platter,
Mango dessert is overly sweet.

Other + points: wide varieties of free coffee and tea available."
Good food with great server,"Had a great birthday dinner here and was attended by Helena.. She is great and helpful... And the food, although limited spread, but tasty..."
Hight Tea,Staff were friendly and greeted us upon arrival. Orders placed were serve to our table quick. Ambience were nice and peaceful.
Bad experience,I would expect better food quality having paid $40 per pax . Dessert were too sweet and savory food is not that decent. I could barely finish high of the high tea set. Would recommend that people go to other places for the same price .
Afternoon High Tea,Went for the afternoon high tea. Food was sumptious and satisfying. Had a great time talking nd eating over the delectable selection of dessert items. Staff was very accomodating and friendly. Kudos to Balbeer and Farhan.
Great customer service,"We were attended by Ms Balbeer, she is very polite and always attend to your needs. A great dining experience comes with good customer service!"
FAMILY DINNER REVIEW,"Good service, nice ambience and all food is fresh. Exceed expectations! Will be coming back soon :) ."
:),"Many food options to choose, service is fast n efficient, thanks Balbeer and team for ur great service :)"
Nice and cosy place for a meal!,"The atmosphere was nice and cozy and the food selection was decent and sufficient for us!

We honestly ate till our stomachs were almost bursting as it was an ala carte buffet dinner and there were so many things that we wanted to try.

We definitely recommend ordering their Seafood Shell Out, the salted egg chicken as well as their soups!

In addition, their service was excellent as well, making sure we never had a dirty plate in front of us and always clearing the leftover plates in a timely manner.

In particular, Balbeer and Han made us feel right at home with their super friendly and amiable attitudes and we really appreciated the level of attention they placed on us.

I understand they run great promotions for their ala carte buffet menu as well so you should definitely give it a try if you are able to catch it.

Thanks again to Balbeer and Han for making this such an awesome experience for us! Kudos to both of you!"
Wonderful time,"We had high tea here, the food was wonderful and plenty and the staff ms balbeer was so sweet and nice. She attended to us without fail and made the hi tea a very eventful one."
Menu does not have a wide variety...,"The a la carte buffet is mediocre. The double boiled chicken soup is not hot at all. The lobster laksa is very dry, does not have laksa leaves. The chicken rice is not good, the rice is broken. The satay does not have peanut sauce at all. The desserts are very average."
Buffet dinner,Great service received from Balbeer. Very polite and friendly. Nice atmosphere nice ambience. Need at least 100 words so I have to write this
Wife 24th Birthday Surprise,Staff Helena did a brillant Job of reccomending and serving the food. Delicious food thats worth the money. Will Definetly come back
Window by the park,"Celebrating husband birthday dinner & was served by Helena. Very friendly, hard working, superb service. Thank you very much Helena"
Window by the park dinner 15 nov,"Celebrated Dads birthday here. was served by Helena. superb excellent service. due to covid, she was the only one serving but she didnt neglect us and always serve us with a smile. Helena made our birthday dinner more enjoyable!!!"
Food Review,"Delicious food, Helena made my experience here 10x better. A very good and passionate waiter indeed. Food was excellent. Portion was amazing. Very fresh seafood and will definitely return for more."
Impeccable service!,My sister and I had lunch buffet at this restaurant. The food was okay. Not bad but nothing spectacular however the service was excellent. Helena was very polite and attentive to our table. She gave recommendations for the food and she’s constantly checking if we need extra food and if everything was good. Farhan was also very helpful. Will come back again.
Weekend Buffet Lunch,Excellent hotel buffet food. Good quality and value for money. Waitstuff Helena was attentive and helpful with our requests. Will come back again Thanks!
Buffet,"Service staff was very prompt and friendly, especially Helena. Food was ok, would be better with a larger variety."
Superb service!,Fast and prompt. Food wise not so bad! Service lady Helena is very courteous. Atmosphere is very soothing.
Food,Food availability is bad. Has ordered according to menu but some items was told out of stock although I occupied the only 1 table in this restaurant for the day. Its also very difficult to judge when ordering as some portion are too big (for may be 5 person) and some portion is so small for just 1 mouthful although stated order quantity=1. Price is on the extremely high side which does not worth the meal. Overall experience is bad thus will not patronise this restaurant.
Great food,"Food was good, service was fast too. Booking on chope was smooth and over all a pleasant meal! I will visit again."
