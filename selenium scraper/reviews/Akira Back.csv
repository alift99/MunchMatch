Great ambience and excellent service,Excellent food and service. We had a beautiful table and celebrated my birthday here. We did a la carte and had the most delicious short ribs and tuna pizza. I definitely will return.
Great dinner,One of the best jap restaurants I’ve eaten at in Singapore. I dont usually like raw fish but Akira Back has changed my perspective on raw fish with the Tuna pizza!!
Average,"We stayed at the JW and ate here 1 evening. Similar menu to the one in bangkok. The $85 8 piece sushi platter is average, the cod had a few bones, the seabass bland. The tuna truffle pizza and tender beef cheek were better

No bonvoy discount here, so more expensive than it should be

7/10"
Excellent dining!,Second visit and is still a very pleasant experience. Impressed with the quality and creativity of dishes. Alisa also has good recommendations and is cheerful in her disposition. Makes our dining experience even more enjoyable. Good job and kudos to Alisa and the team!

birthday dinner,FOOD WAS REALLY GOOD. the quality was top notch!! was served by Jenny and she was really attentive and friendly! always checked in and introduced the food to us. :) it was a great experience here and we enjoyed our time
Good food with Good service,"Back for another dining experience, and once again Akira Back exceeded my expectations. I tried their Rock Shrimp appetiser and it was just phenomenal. As a fan of Ebi tempura, this is one of the best I have ever had, the shrimp was just so tender with a crispy outer layer. It was also drenched in the Kochujang aioli which complemented the dish perfectly. I went back for their signature rolls and it was as delicious as I remembered them to be.

Service was just as amazing as the food, a special thanks to Julia and Hyun for taking care of me throughout my solo dinner. Will definitely be back to try other dishes! :D"
Great Experience!,"Great food , awesome service and nice ambience! Will definitely come again to try new items in the menu."

Innovative japanese/Korean food.,"Food was good and quite innovative. Evelyn who served us was excellent , friendly and professional! Ambience was very pleasant. Would come back again to try out those dishes we didn’t order."
Good sharing plates!,"We skipped mains and went for cold and hot shared plates instead. Jenny, our server, was outstanding in her service! Her recommendations for the cold tuna pizza and hot wagyu tacos were great choices. We enjoyed all of our orders except for the “Holy Cow”. We were expecting as much flavours as we have experienced but this last course that we ordered was rather underwhelming. Still, we would certainly make another visit again."
"Good food, attentive service, great ambience",First visit for our anniversary. Food was good and Evelyn was great in looking after us. We even got a surprise dessert for our anniversary.
Excellent food and service!,"We had our Christmas dinner here with amazing food and staff (thank you Jenny and Hyun!). Everything was so prompt and all the dishes were explained with a lot of skill. Service was definitely a highlight which is saying something when the food was so exceptional. Personal favourite was definitely the tuna tacos and the lobster tempura!

Cant wait to visit again!"

Pre Christmas Dinner,"Tried the Festive Set Menu with friends last night. Only one word to describe the meal : superb Everything was so delicious, we tried a walk in reservation for 6:30pm and got seated luckily. Jenny served us and explained each dish in detail. She was very good and attentive. Below is my top 3 of the whole set : tuna pizza, lobster tempura, and wagyu ribeye Can’t wait to go back"
Akira Back Dinner,It was a fun experience. My first time to try a Japanese fusion reataurant. The food was great. Thanks Jenny for serving us.
Lovely Dinner above Bangkok,Wonderful place for dinner and exceptional service from our server Nam. Very attentive and provided excellent recommendations on the menu :)
Dinner visit to Akira black.,"Was out of Dinner after a long days work was surprised by the dishes . Very intelligently put together and great service by Julia.

I tried the Miso soup a starter in AB tuna pizza which is not a pizza ! chicken with potato puree Ji-Dori Chicken for the main course ..delecate combinations put together with great finesse."
Friendly Manager. Good Food.,Everything was good. We feel welcome by the team. The Manager was friendly and chatted a bit with us. Raw food was fresh and cooked food was yummy. Very full for the set dinner for two person. They called to ask if it is for any occasion. Informed them was for birthday and they did something on the dessert which was very nice touch.
Wonderful First experience,"it was my first time eating at Akira Back Singapore and it was definitely an amazing experience.

The food were super delicious. we ordered their wagyu tacos and sushi rolls ( brother from another mother and perfect storm ). we also ordered their wagyu fried rice and chicken for our mains. all the food were very tasty , the flavour was very strong , portion was big and it really blew my mind.

i would like to genuinely thank the team for making us feel welcomed and would like to sincerely thank Rock for assisting us through out the night. He provided us with a friendly and amazing service which we really appreciate and making our dining experience wonderful. I would really be coming back to dine in again and would like to recommend Akira Back singapore to everyone."
Amazing first experience,"It was my first time dining at Akira Back and both the service team and the food truly exceeded my expectations.

Foodwise, I had their wagyu tacos and signature sushi rolls (Perfect Storm & Brother from another mother) for appetisers/sharing platters, and the Wagyu fried rice and chicken for mains. All of the dishes never disappointed, were very rich in flavour, and had a highly appealing presentation and the portions were relatively big. My party and I thoroughly enjoyed the food, and a special mention for the dessert as well, we had ""Let's Go Nuts"" and ""Chocolate in a cup"". Was recommended to try their signature Tuna Pizza but was not really a fan of raw tuna, hence, did not manage to try it.

I would like to express my great gratitude to the team for the warm hospitality, and also would like to commend Rock for taking great care of us throughout the night. He rendered a very attentive and friendly service, which my party and I greatly appreciate. I would like to sincerely thank Rock and the rest of the team for an amazing dining experience at Akira Back! I would highly recommend and definitely will be back."
One of my favs,Really good food and service! Matthan showed great hospitality and was really accommodating to our needs. Would definitely go back!
Lovely dinner,Excellent food and great service from Alisa. Will definitely come again and recommend my friend. Especially the set dinner is worth the money.
Excellent experience as always,The food was excellent. We love and always order the tuna pizza and the spinach salad. The spicy tofu and Perfect Storm were also very good. For dessert we ordered the pecan tart with apricot and vanilla ice cream which were both superb. Alisa our waiter was very kind. We will be back!
Superb Service and Modern Take on Jap Cuisine,Kudos to Evelyn and and Mathan for the impeccable service - super attentive and well versed on the menu. 5 star service accompanied with 5 star food!
Fantastic sushi place,Mr. Tugberk and Mr. Melih were phenomenally good and trained. Enjoyed my solo dinner together with their lovely service.
Second visit,Decided to celebrate my fiancé's birthday again at Akira Back and it didn't disappoint. Hyun's service was good and was very helpful and introduced delicious wine to us. Food was great too! Definitely wont be our last time there.
A Memorable Dinner,"Had an awesome time out. Food was great thanks to Sue’s recommendations (appreciate that she stopped me from over ordering .. lol) and service was top notch. A big THANK YOU to our server Rock for his attentiveness, for taking the time to listen, understand and going the extra mile to carry out our request."
Amazing as usual,Went for dinner with a foodie friend who had never visited before and the food and service really impressed my friend. We will be back!
Nice place,Everlyin”s service was very good. Nice place to have business meal and drink. The course was good for two to eat and the venue is ideal for meeting and gathering.
First visit to Akita Back at JW Marriott Singapore,"Awesome experience from the moment we set foot at the doorway to catching an elevator to leave. Restaurant staffs made our experience special, and secondly the foods. We had the set menu for two with sashimi and upgraded beef. Plenty of foods for two and plenty of varieties to sample. Every course is a new experience and a pleasant surprise. Overall, 5/5 easily. Very sincere thanks to Jenny and General Manager for making our dinner experience memorable."
"Great experience, ambience, staff and food",We had dinner at Akira for the first time. We were greeted by attentive staff. Special mention is Nathan.. he made some recommendations that were excellent. Ambience was soft and pleasant. Food is outstanding. Will come back again.
3rd year here!,"Always love how creative and flavourful every single dish is! Service is impeccable, particularly Mathan who was very on the ball in his service! Great experiences here as always!"
Japanese Food,Very tasty food beautifully served up. Great ambience. Excellent service by manager Hyun Soo and Evelyn.
Never disappoints!,"The food and service at Akira Back never disappoints! We had the set menu for two. The Tuna Aburi salad, the Hokkaido Scallops, the Sashimi combo and Beef cheek were delicious!"
Disappointing dinner at trendy Japanese Korean fusion restaurant at the JW Marriott,"We had a family dinner at Akira Back , with its open kitchen, and lively vibe. We shared a range of tapas items , including variations of rolls and sushi. Overall, it fell short of expectations. Prices are on the high side"
Hidden gem at Southbeach tower,"We strolled into Akira Back with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised. We selected the “Two Good to Share” set which, in my honest opinion, was very generously portioned and both my husband & I (& our toddler) struggled to finish and ended up bagging home the Wagyu Fried Rice. Each dish was faultless from presentation to taste and you also have the option to top up for a sashimi combo which we did (you won’t regret doing so) and was informed that these were flown in daily from Japan.

We finished off with Chef’s dessert of Japanese cheesecake with fresh berries & Raspberry sorbet sitting on top of a heap of cookie crumbs which was multi-textural and irresistible. My boy loved it!

Special mention to our servers - Hyun and Rock whose service was impeccable and made every effort to make us feel like esteemed guests. Certainly gems in the service industry. We look forward to our next visit!"
"Great food, awesome service, good ambience",This is a wonderful place for food. Drinks selection is great and varied. Food is Japanese fusion and done excellently! Not many restaurants can pull it off. Make sure u try their striploin. Sashimi was superb and fresh
Average service,Visited Akira back for the second time but was left disappointed with the service on the second visit. Lack of attentiveness and hardly any interaction between the servers and the guests.
Wedding anni dinner,Celebrated our wedding anniversary here and was impressed by the impeccable service by Jenny! The food was also great and we ate to our hearts content. Thank you for a wonderful evening.
Amazing service and food,Big thank you to Alisa and Rock for taking care of us and being so attentive! They made the effort to explain each dish and also give recommendations - which we enjoyed very much :)) Not our first time here but we were still impressed by the service and food. 11/10 experience will definitely be back!
Dinner,"Food was really good - reminded me of Roku. The service from Sue was impeccable as well, with recommendations on food that was on point. Service was relatively slow though but made up for it with the high quality food."
Excellent,"Fourth visit, the eggplant miso was above average, few pieces of this probably undercooked, a bit too hard for me.
The 48hrs sanghoku short rib was very good, tender and juicy. Previous visit wanted to order this dish but it was sold out.

Although I requested both dishes to be served together, the short rib was served first and by the time the eggplant was ready, I almost finished all my rice and short rib, ... but the fault was with me because I am a fast eater hahaha...and this is the proof... came in 1810hrs and left 1840hrs, spent SGD90, just hope that I am an okay customer.

Nice ambience and good customer service."
Birthday dinner.,Very good service from Evelyn. Food was excellent. Would definitely come back. Great for intimate dinner or family gathering. My husband celebrated his birthday and we were surprised with a lovely panna cotta for his birthday.
"Wonderful fun, vibes and service!",We went there for a birthday celebration and had opted for the ala cart menu. Each of the dishes served was superbly good! We were attended by Mr. Rock during our lunch and he was really sweet and paid attention to detail! Would highly recommend!
Look for Hyun!!!!!,"First time visiting Akira Back and I was not disappointed. Flavours of the dishes complemented each other incredibly well, but the highlight was the service from Hyun. He took amazing care of us and was so attentive and polished all throughout. An unforgettable experience and a must try for those who love Japanese food with a flare. `"
"Unpleasant visit, not being welcome","I visited at night for dinner about 7 plus pm, however I was greeted by the staff that the place is occupied although there are plenty of tables without guest.
So I asked about the empty tables, the staff informed that all the empty tables are reserved for hotel guest. Oh wow only 2 tables are seated but the rest are received for hotel guest. It was just a Tuesday night. Well if you are being selective on the quantity of customer that going to dine in, you can just put a notice at the entrance on minimum no. of occupancy.

It's not my first visit, but the only reason for my visit is the Tacos even most of the foods are not fantastic. I will never visit again due to this unpleasant experience."
Highly recommended,"delicious food, nice ambience, good service 👍🏼 Our foods are recommended and served by Mr Hyun. His service is so amazing 🤩"
Great ambience and great food,"Lovely restaurant, great ambience and yummy food created with passion. Attentive and warm staff. Highly recommended"
Excellent dinner and service,The food was very tasty. We had a good variety of food and all were tasty! Hyun was very professional and attentive.

The service staff - Jenny and Mathan are friendly, really take good care of our table and explained the ingredients when serve, very professional. We had an enjoyable meal. Thank you!!!"
Excellent food and services!,"The food is exquisite and tasted heavenly! Especially their slow cooked beef, it’s so tender that you don’t need knife to cut. Not to mentioned, their staffs have the best services! Shout out to Jenny and Mathan. Overall, it’s definitely a wonderful experience. Would come back soon!"
Excellent food with great atmosphere!,"Had my 1st visit to Akira Back last night for a gathering with friends. Love the atmosphere there! Each of the dishes served was nicely curated and was really delicious. The tuna pizza and spicy tuna taco is a must-try to me. Highly recommend if you are searching for a place to catch up with friends over a drink and some good food. The service staff Mathan and Jenny were both attentive and friendly. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience to dine in the restaurant."
Awesome food even better service,All staff was very attentive always taking care our table. Food was an absolute delight. Next i want to try halibut as well

So delicious,"This restauarant was awesome, the food was delicious and service excellent. Just below the JW Marriot, you don't have to walk far to get a great meal."
Birthday celebration,Had an amazing time here and Mathan gave very good service! My favourite was the Tuna pizza and really like the tacos.
Awesome place for date night,Nice ambience great service. Great for date night. Good food and drinks. Loved the tuns pizza. Price is good too.
"Excellent Welcome by Hyun and Great Solo Lunch ""One-Derful"" Menu","Honestly I was just walking around the neighborhood looking for a lunch spot, and this friendly guy, Hyun, convinced me to give the restaurant a try. Akira Back did not disappoint and the One-Derful Menu is a great concept, given the amount of solo business travellers staying at the JW Marriott (the restaurant is part of the hotel). I settled on Sashimi Don, which did not disappoint. Since there is a surcharge on the Sashimi Don, I expect the portion to be larger but the fish is fresh and the presentation is beautiful. It was a nice lunch and I had a great chat with Hyun about the restaurant. I will definitely return to AB when I am back in the city in the Fall."
Anniversary celebration,We enjoyed our dinner at your restaurant. Nice ambience with delicious food and excelkent service from the staffs especially Mathan. Thank you for the nice evening on Monday.
Fantastic option for Japanese / Korean fusion,"Fantastic meal with my wife here at AB. The dishes are creative with amazing flavors that are appealing without being overpowering. Cod, yellowtail w. jalapenos, Tuna pizza, and the Hot Mess roll were delicious paired with chilled Sake and Kirin beer. Really cant go wrong with anything on menu and the service staff are some of the best we've experienced in Singapore! Put it on your list of must visit restaurants"
Sat gathering,We were served by Mathan and Jenny. Good food and nice service. I especially love the cocktail made by Mathan. Will come back again.
Awesome service,Awesome service by Gary! Love the food! Tuna pizza is a must try! Thank you Akira back for the omplimentary birthday cake
Amazing ambience,It’s a good place for social gatherings with a selected range of fusion niche cuisine! Great ambience that makes the trip very memoravle
"Great food, great ambience and great service","Mathan and Shen Ai were great in recommending food, and explained the ingredients. Was there to celebrate my friend's birthday, they gave this chocolate mouse treat, explained chocolate is bitter, break the bitterness to get to the sweet mousse below."
