Our Favourite Italian Restaurant,"We must have been here more than 20 times. Excellent menu and food, and the staff is first class. Prices for food and wine are very reasonable. Both the pastas and pizas are very good. Highly Recommended!"
Worst Italian i had,"Had dined in various Italian restaurants around Singapore, and this has to be the worst of the lot. On why it won many awards beats me. The chef does not take pride in his dishes and it shows. I get that Italian synced with tomato but throwing tomato sauce sparingly does not make the food any better. We had the parmigiana, burrata pizza and lamb rank. Also ordered bottle of wine. It was our wedding anniversary and unfortunately we could only enjoy the wine tonight."
Always the best,It’s our all time favourite Italian restaurant! Pizza is amazing and good value for money! Pasta is authentic and delicious. We also love the calamari…must order every time!
"Awful food, arrogant management","Absolutely awful food, arrogant management, no respect for the customer. Hard to believe that anyone can make a simple pizza as bad as this. There’s many better restaurants nearby with better food and who treat customers with more respect."
"Good taste, but sand in clams for vongole and sand in mushroom for pizza. Service staff questioned our feedback on food.","Overall, vongole pasta and funghi pizza tasted good. However, the clams and mushrooms were sandy. Service staff did not appreciate and questioned our feedback. Vongole could use a dash more white wine. Needs to improve on service standards and ability to accept customer feedback!"
Fave Italian Restaurant,"Love the food there especially the Spaghetti Cartoccio & Calzone.
Been to Alforno at least 3-4 times a year! one of my top fave italian restaurant."
Good Service despite missing my reservation,"The restaurant owner/in-charged offered us complimentary drink while we were waiting outside until our table were ready.
Although we were a bit disappointed initially for waiting as we came all the way here from the West for my boyfriend birthday celebration and $30 of my credit card balance was reserved by Chope as “deposit” or confirmation of my booking (I supposed), in the end we were happy about the good service provided, enjoyed the food & the drink, so we decided to order dessert to complete our meal. After our dessert, we were surprised to receive “birthday cake”- a mini chocolate puff with a lit candle on top, a nice gesture from the restaurant. I will visit the restaurant again. It seems that my name and correct booking time appeared on restaurant reservation list, just my contact number was undefined and no confirmation call received from the restaurant.
I hope Chope/Restaurant could fix the booking and communication channel issue in near future.
P/S: To Chope Team, I went there for dinner on 11 Sep. I used a different credit card for payment. I didn’t aware until I checked today that my credit card linked to Chope is still holding $30 balance. Please help to fix."
Date night with the Mrs,"Been meaning to write this for a while now. AlForno is a place i personally just love visiting. Ive brought my family, friends and clients for dinner here, and every visit simply reminds me why i love eating there. There is a connect at the restaurant that cannot be described. Its reflects in the warm ambiance, in the friendly staff, and ofcourse in the food. When you visit a place it has a soul that resonates well with you at a very different level. One is not sure what it us, but you don't feel it everywhere you visit.

I personally have a strong relationship with food and can be very fussy from the cutlery, to the temprature of the food served, to the distinct flavor that jumps out at you when you put decent food in your mouth. Alforno gets it right pretty consistently.

Dont miss the Burrata, and the crab meat Pasta.
Even the tomatoes sliced up on the side of the Burrata, are pretty fresh and full of flavor. They are sufficiently and well balanced with the right amount if salt, so as to not rush the flavor change when enjoying the burrata; rather additionally complimenting it.

The Farfalle Al Granchio (Crab meat pasta) is another sensation you must not miss. The balance of that dish is near perfect ( if there is anything like perfect ever), with a slight tilt towards the spicy side. Im originally from India, so spice in my taste buds is not uncommon, but the extent of that in the pasta is subtle and inviting into the next bite you're coming back for.

Everyone has a different expectation around what to pair their wine with, i personally gravitate to reds more often that not. The pricing on Alforno's wine is good too.
Allows you to experiment with light to fulk bodied wines without burning a hole in your wallet. I won't specifically describe the wine that ive enjoyed at alforno, but if i may add one suggestion to the folks there is to try serving the wine at a better temperature, especially if its ordered by the bottle. Bringing it really chilled to the table is abit of a turn off.

A must visit to Alforno in order to experience the magic good italian food, staff and ambience can bestow upon you. Feel the soul there. Ive enjoyed it, and i hope you do too."
Excellent,My sister & I enjoyed ourselves as we dined over lunch with great quality of food. She knows that Al Forno for many decades.
Decent Italian food,"We had 3 pasta dishes - crab, mushroom and lasagna. The crab pasta was good. The other were average. The restaurant was very crowded so it’s noisy. Service was good!"
Real Italian in Singapore:,"Real Italian in Singapore: feels like being back at home.... nice atmosphere, welcoming staff and very good pizza!"
My Favourite Place for Pizza in Singapore,"It is a place where food cooked with love is served by people with great hearts. It is my place of comfort, place for special occasions, place for celebration and also a place where I order delivery when my emotions are in sixes and sevens and I don't feel like leaving the solace of my home. I can eat the same pizza and the same calzone all the time. Its consistency in food preparation and service makes me feel so homely."
Fantastic Italian Food,Food and service were excellent! It was pretty warm in the restaurant though. Stifling at times. Air con could be colder.
Amazing food & service combined!,Food and service are both amazing in this place. My girlfriends brought me here to celebrate my birthday in advance and it was indeed a great one. All the staff were very accommodating despite a busy restaurant. The owner even managed to greet a few tables including ours to check if the food is to our expectations. Kudos to all the Chefs in preparing flavourful dishes served. We’ll definitely recommend this place to more friends and family.
Do not order delivery,"For some reason the orders will arrive either very late (over 1 hour) or a mess. I tried all delivery companies including their own and if never fail, just look at the photo. There are other pizza places not worth the trouble."
My favorite pizza in Singapore,"I had trouble finding a good pizza dough in Singapore. It is for me the best pizzeria that I have eaten in SG, I have never been disappointed (4 times). I recommend the pizza with burrata and ham."
Typical Italian Meal,"Peering through the door of the restaurant, I felt it was too crowded, so I chose to sit outside, where there were a few tables set up. The menu is available via a QR code, the norm nowadays given the present situation.

Like a typical Italian meal, dinner started with the Focaccia Bianca (flat pizza bread with garlic, oregano and extra-virgin olive oil), followed by a pasta dish, Farfalle Al Salmone (bow-tie pasta with salmon in tomato-cream sauce) and ended with a Tiramisu. The menu is comprehensive and descriptive, with photos of each dish. All three dishes I ordered were tasty and filling; and excellent choices in my opinion.

Service was good, and as we were outside, we were pretty much left alone, which is fine. Turn on the wall fan if it gets too warm. However, if you prefer more attention, it would make better sense to find yourself an indoor table."
Sadly disappointing,"Had high hopes, having heard from someone that this is where the best pizza in Singapore is served.

We had the pizza with the burrata and parma ham, and the pear pizza. Unfortunately, both were underwhelming - the pizzas came barely warm and lacked flavour. The pear pizza tasted like oily chewy cheese. To be brutally honest, the pizzas at Pizza express tasted better than the pizzas here (sorry!).

I write this with some sadness given how cosy the restaurant felt, and the good reviews here. Quality control may be the issue here."
The worst pizza / lasagna,The worst pizza / lasagna in the world. Never again. Low quality mozzarella (so bad it cannot be described) and frozen lasagna. Good luck.
Yummy Italian Food,"Cosy, nice dining place that serve very nice Italian food. Love it. High recommend for anyone who like to try out delicious, authentic italian fopd!"
Cosy and relaxed and a little bit of Italy on the East Coast,We were recommended this place by family friends who swore that they did the best pizza. We went hungry for great Italian pizza and we got it!! My kids adored the pizza and I had the pasta which was wonderful. The restaurant had a great energy (Sun night) and you can tell it is a popular local haunt. We will def visit again.
Disappointed,"Liked the food there before, so I ordered the delivery for Mother’s Day. We waited for more than 3 hours, called them many time but never picked up.
Right before the closing time, finally connected, and found out they missed my order even I got order confirmation by email.

The owner offered a half price for the food, even he put disclaimer at the web that it will be free if the delivery took more than 150 mins. He rejected the free dog saying it is not their fault, it is internet fault... un believable

What is the worse, when we got finally the food, no taste pasta, less source even we asked extra source as additional. Grilled seafood messy...

Obviously they rush to cook them.
In the end I was so disappointed at the restaurant unprofessional behaviors and mind-set."
Amazing food and excellent service! Probably the best Italian restaurant on the East Coast.,Amazing food and excellent service! Probably the best Italian restaurant on the East Coast. Would definitely visit again.
Valentine’s Day dinner,"Made reservations but still had to queue outside when I reached. They should not have accepted reservations if they could not ensure there were sufficient tables available. Service was slow inside. Had to wait till 10.45pm for my mains and had forgotten to give bread when I had ordered sides. I was told that there was a minimum spending of $55 per person but there were tables which did not hit the minimum and because of that I had to order more than I could eat and had to takeaway 3/4 of my pizza.

However, food was good and value for money. Would probably only come again during off peak timings"
Amazing food,Amongst all telhe restauramts alforno is one of the best rrstaurants ive ever been to. I tried their steak and it was off the charts. I give it a 10/10.
Service is bad; food standards has dropped,Service is bad. Food standard has dropped. Used to be one of the best Italian restaurant in the east but not so now.
Authentic Italian food,We had dinner at this Italian restaurant at east coast area. This restaurant is famous for its pizza. The buffalo cheese pizza was something special. Service was good.
Happy Meal.,"I gave a try on new year's eve and was able to reserve a table when I booked on that day. The restaurant was packed and we had a table without much waiting. After ordering it took more than 20 minutes before the waitress discovered the mushroom soup has not been served. This was rectified quickly and we enjoyed the mushroom soup which is thick with lots of mushroom. The maun course like Tuna steak and Lamb shank were enjoyable and on the whole it is a good dinner.
We plan to bring our kids to try again next time."
Excellent!,"The atmosphere, meal and service all contributed to an amazing experience. The food tasted authentic and genuine. I would definitely recommend my friends and family to go because they do not disappoint. The Burrata is fresh and creamy. The pizza crust is well baked, crispy yet the inside is still flavourful. i would also recommend the gnocchi pesto pasta as the pesto was really enjoyable too!"
Best Italian food,One of the best italian restaurants in Singapore. Authentic food that was top notch and service was great as well A must to try!
Al Forno,All my guests were please with the food and wine. The waitresses were attentive and helpful. Will return very soon.
Wonderful place to bring your kids and friends,The environment is cozy for kids and a great place to enjoy with friends and they serves wonderful food.
"As always, Excellent.","We’ve been loyal customers to Al Forno for many, many years now. The food and service is always top notch. Will recommend again and again."
Great Value one-for-one Lunch!,"Al Forno is our family's favourite Italian restaurant.
Lip-Smacking Good Food, Friendly & Efficient Service, Relaxing Ambience... never fail to disappoint!
Al Forno is having a one-for-one Lunch Promotion (for pasta & pizza, during weekdays & with OCBC card) - & we have been patronising the place many times during lunch! Definitely great value for money!"
"Big Portions, Great Lunch deals.","Usually, we visit Al Forno for dinner but we decided to do lunch this time. It was rather quiet and gloomy compared to dinner where the atmosphere is usually much vibrant and lively. We started with a basket of bread accompanied by olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The bread felt quite cold. I would have preferred for the bread to be a little toasty and warm.

We got 2 dishes, Fettuccine Alodore which was a pasta with black truffle cream, sausages and loads of mushrooms. Another dish was Risotto Con Speck which consists of a generous portion of cubed ham, brie cheese & beer with cream. Both dishes were amazing as usual. We paired both the dishes with a glass of merlot and prosecco. << brie cheese... *wink*"
Ordinary and expensive,Came by to have lunch with a friend over lunch and ordered the aglio olio. The plating of the dish was normal and it is hard to justify the price tag considering the ingredients used. Other competiting restaurants are able to offer more ingredients (e.g. eggs and bacon) but at much affordable prices. Service was normal with nothing noteworthy. Ice water is provided when requested.
Had a birthday celebration at Al Forno,"Reserved a table online which was easy and hassle free. Service at the restaurant was good, orders were taken fast and efficiently and we didn’t have to wait long for our food. Had the Burrata Pomodoro - we found it a good starter including my kids. The salmon ai ferri was not bad. The fish was cooked just right. But the pizzas were excellent, we had the tutto funghi and con pera - no complains there."
Food was expensive and lousy.,Three of us had dinner which came up to $206. The seafood soup was bland. The calzone pizza and seafood pasta were also a let down. We did not even have dessert. Resolve never to visit again!
East Coast Italian that continues to set high standards,"My son who for the last year decided he no longer liked pizza announced he really fancied some pizza. So went back to Al Forno for the first time in maybe a year. It was as busy as ever - most tables taken - but the food still arrived in a reasonable time and the service level remained decent.
He and I both had pizza which were both cooked perfectly, topped with fine ingredients and all-round lovely.
I'll definitely be back again soon."
Great Food!,"Enjoyed myself with my pal at the restaurant. Food is good and the portion is BIG - considering there were only two of us. Wld be good if the portion can be smaller cos we couldn’t finish the food in the end! When the portion is smaller, we can order more variety of dishes!"
The giant seafood Zuppa is to die for 😍😍😍,The best dish on the menu. Perfect for sharing as a main without heavy carbs. Too bad they don’t serve free bread anymore. A shame for such a nice restaurant. Not cool. But they did try to make it up w free dessert which was very totful. But we’d prefer the awesome bread! A neighbour gem in the East.
Great Food & Ambience,"Had a birthday celebration, and the food was great. Food was served in an appropriate timing, and servers were attentive. ;)"
Food and Service,It is always a joy to dine at Al Forno with friends or family. Food is always good and service is always seamlessly a piece of cake to the serving crew. Kudos and keep up the good work.
"Overrated, overpriced, overcooked","This has been our go-to italian restaurant. However, tonight's dinner was truly a BIG disappointment. They must have run out of pasta. There were barely any pasta in the Cartoccio (their most popular dish). Although it was suppose to feed two, it appeared that the portion has definitely shrunk. The seafood - prawns, squid were overcooked and hence came out chewy. Yet the whole dish was barely hot.

Although one of our crayfish was served without the meat, they did replace it - so cludos to the team for customer satisfaction!"
Sunday Brunch,"Had a lunch reservation for 2+1 made for my husband's birthday. When we arrived, atmosphere was nice, cosy and smell of freshly fire baked pizza brought us back to when we were in Italy.

It took awhile for waitress to attend to us (not busy yet). It also took them awhile to get a table for us even thou it was a reservation made :( We did get attended too which is what matters.

We had a buffet brunch and the spread and quality of food was excellent. Great work by the chefs. After our meal we had a surprise birthday cake brought to the table which was unexpected and very thoughtful. Its the littlest things and surprises which made a very good experience and The Af Forno team made it even nicer for us."
great food and excellent service,"we first went here for my birthday, and returned a few months later. the place gets busy early so make a reservation or expect to wait for a table. the pizzas are great - we love the thin/crispy crust............ the seafood and squid ink pastas are great, as are the grilled meats/lamb chops, but you need to come hungry as portions are large. good selection of wines available by the glass or by the bottle"
Wow,"Stumbled across this excellent restaurant and will be going back. The food was exceptional especially the Burrata Cheese and salad. Did read some mixed reviews on this restaurant, however, our experience was fantastic."
food was really really great,"ate here after getting my a level results and it was such a nice night, the service was a little slow due to it being packed that night but i love it"
Casual Italian Fare with nice service,I would give 3 ½ but I rounded up. This was suggested July my friend who loves their pasta and it was good. I had Oso Bucco and she had pasta with a nice white wine and a side of fries and meatballs. Totally filling and all good. Will definitely go again.
Decent,"I visited this restarunt for the first time around 7 weeks ago and the pizza was marvelous and was good value for money. I had come on a monday night so the restarunt was fairly quiet and relaxed. I loved the food so much that 5 weeks later I brought my family with me on a friday. This is where the problems started. We ordered the eggplant parmeasn and it didn't taste fresh. The eggplant was chewy and it tasted like it was cooked days ago as opposed to fresh and for the high price tag on the dish that was very dissapointing. We also ordered the caprese salad and again was dissapointed as the mozeralla didn't feel fresh at all and was frankly mediorce. I decided to also order some pizza as the last time I visited the pizza was great. Sadly the pizza was just o.k, it tasted fine but was lacking in salt and other basic flavours. The ambience was alright but the lighting is very dim and made everything just feel a little strange. The service was alright no complains, the price was pretty expensive for just ok food. Its best you visit on a weekday night as they are not very crowded and the food is much better."
Great food and ambience!,"Great recommendations, friendly staff, tasty food set amidst warm lights and sweet pods of chatter. What else could a couple want on a Friday evening?"
"Perfect setting, delicious food and impeccable service",Highly recommended if you're craving for Italian food. Set in Katong area and walking distance to a few public parking. Food itself was main highlight with decent servings and quality ingredients. Service crew that attended to us were great. Will be back!
Very Busy Italian Restaurant,Great night out Excellent Food a Tirasamu to die for great friendly service on an exceptionally busy Saturday Night
Excellent meal and place to celebrate with family,"Went there yesterday with my family to celebrate my birthday. Have to write a glowing review as from service to food to kid friendliness, everything was more than what we expected. Simply delighted with our meal and totally worth the price. We ordered mushroom soup, which our picky eater loved as well and pizzas were simply awesome, fresh ingredients with a great crust with nice smoky burnt edges.
I was very happy to have ordered the Tiramisu too, though we were so full.
Our new favorite and will definitely visit again..."
Amazing food,"Was craving some Italian food and was lots walking along east coast road. Chanced upon alforno and going in was the best decision I made that day! Wonderful food, service and pretty affordable too! Would gladly go back again. Maybe the only downside is there is not much parking nearby so driving there may be a problem. Other than that it was an good experience overall!"
Filling and worth it,"Been here a number of times and they have never disappointed me. This time i brought my husband and 2 kids. We ordered a lagsana, carbonara for the kids and a mushroom with truffle cream pasta. Very rich and filling. Absolutely recommend. Do reserve a table in advance."
"Cosy, warm service & good food !","What’s not to like about this cosy restaurant that has been serving great Italian food in Easy Coast ? Very cosy interior and warm, friendly and very efficient service ! Chef owner personally served shooter glasses of liqueur to us ,nice touch C elebrated Christmas here in 2016 & 2018 and will be back !! Pizza is v nice and the crabmeat pasta in tomato sauce is amazinggggg !! Highly recommend this restaurant !!"
Highly recommended!,"Absolutely wonderful dinner for the three of us. Have been dining here for years and it has never disappointed. We always order the sauté vongole starters, a pizza and a pasta for a small group. I love their diablo pizza and the seafood one as well"
"disappointing, will not return ever","staff ignored us a few times when we wanted to place our order. the food arrived 45 minutes later and it was cold and bland. we still are trying to understand how to justify the price we paid for the service and food. we requested for a side of salad but only received greens with no dressing, which we eventually had to ask for. lack of attention to details was a very upsetting mood for us all.

we used to love coming to Al Forno but this time was utterly disappointing and we will not return or recommend to others. we will have to find another place for our yearly tradition now as Al Forno standards have dropped dramatically."
Diavola pizza.......................fantastico!,"Simply the best pizza in town. The crust, the sauce, the toppings......all put together together perfectly. I've been eating this pizza for years. Dine-in or order out. It never disappoints. I'll devour a whole pizza and then get upset because I want more."
Good food and good ambience,"we just two of us, there is a limit on what we can order. we have enjoyed on the food there was served and decided to have a takeaway for our kids."
Great Food with Lovely Staff,Great food with some lovely staff. Go to the East Coast Road restaraunt often and it has a great atmosphere.
Good italian food,"We came here on a Sunday evening via reservation to celebrate my fiancè’s birthday with our family and it was buzzing with constant stream of people.

I like how they used a probably brick oven for their pizzas as well as how the owner of the restaurant still attends to you.

The food is good and fresh although it is on the pricer side.

All in all it was good dinner enjoyed by everyone"
My birthday(31/10/63) celebration Brunch @ Al Forno,My lovely wife treated me to Sunday brunch @ tastefully Halloween setup dining atmosphere Good food with awesome advance Birthday cum Halloween celebration. Will be back...
Delicious Italian food that warms the heart,"My guest and I loved the melt-in-your-mouth cheese on the pizza , complimented by the aromatic mushrooms and the wonderfully crisp crust - Fresh and baked in a traditional wood fire. The pasta hit right at the heart with its delectable tomato base.Service was as usual warm and friendly.I can't wait for my next visit."
Reliable Italian Restaurant,"I visited this place when I first moved to Telok Kurau. More than 20 years later, it is still surviving at the same location. This must mean something.

The Aglio Olio & Squid Ink pasta were average. Maybe the standards dropped a little. But the crab meat pasta was nice. I did not try the pizzas. But they looked nice.
Service was very good.

I managed to find parking along Telok Kurau Road near the junction. There are also lots along the road & in front of the restaurant. The restaurant provides valet parking too.

If I go again I don’t think I will try the pasta. Will try the pizzas."
Great food & ambience,"Love the settings, remind us of one of those neighborhood restaurants in Rome suburb.

Food was great. We ordered burrata, pizza al forno & Tagliata di Carne. The steak was tender in medium rare, the pizza toppings was even & the crust had that charred fragrance typically from traditional stone oven. We closed off with tartufo affogato. Great stuff overall!

The staff were nice & friendly, and humorous! We had a fun Saturday night out at the EastCoast thanks to this place!"
Our experience,It is one of the decent Italian restaurants in each. Very crowded but the quality of food is above average. Pizzas are pretty good. A bit pricey.
Enjoyed it!,"My husband and I went there to celebrate our 3rd year wedding anniversary. The food that we ordered were really delicious! We enjoyed the raw beef, folded pizza and steak."
Impeccable customer service but food wise...,"Always wanted to try this Italian restaurant since moving into this area and finally tried it. Wouldnt say it was not good but food was mediocre. Though we booked a table but was allocated to a table which was cramped and we had a “good staring game” from the next table the whole dining session. The table was like 10cm side by side. Nevertheless the staff were attentive and polite.

Probably will not sentence this restaurant to “death” first...will try the next time round again."
First visit,Chope worked well too....my first time to reserve thru chope ......i recommed the restaurant too for even vegetarians
Very good Italian Food,"it was a wonderful and much needed break from Asian for the family. we had pizza , salad and 2 pasta dishes. Service was top notch and we left nothing on the table. this is a great spot to have good thinner crust pizza and i suggest to make reservations"
Great food great ambience,We were so greedy to order 3 mains and appetiser for 2 adults. But we finished all. Parking is an issue but there’s valet parking to extend their help.
Good pizza,"We tried out Al Forno as we were in the neighborhood with family. We managed to park our car just outside the restaurant although it also has valet parking.

We tried two pizzas and a simple salad with cheese. The pizza was quite good.

Decor looks a bit stale."
"Favorite, Go-to, Best Neighborhood Italian","Sometimes you just want to eat out and know you're going to get good food, welcoming staff, reliable service, and warm familiarity. Favorites burrata, spaghetti carbonara, pizza, ravioli, penne arrabiata. Bonus: restaurant owner serves and talks to customers, regardless of how busy it gets; he always recognizes 'the regulars'. I agree that upgrading the lighting and addressing the acoustics factor would be welcoming"
Authentic Italian Food,"So I've been to the one in town and it is better, the decor and darkness in the East Cosst Road is tired and needs an update. But I guess the food is the most important thing and its good, not great but good, again I felt it was better in the other outlet. The service was very good friendly and efficient. This is authentic Italian food, quite rustic and all the more charming for it. I started with a simple salad, it was huge and lacked finesse, huge tomatoe segments masses of iceberg lettuce and cubes of ricotta, the dressing was tangy, I did eat it all but as I said rustic. Its aways great to see a proper pizza oven and my Al Forno was delicious, very tasty with a lovely crisp thin bake that was no hard on the teeth, a perfect crunch. The toppings were very well balanced. A great pizza. The bread basket had some nice breads, nothing to shout about and I do like to pour my own oil and balsamic! I will return for some pasta and probably have another pizza. If you like authentic rustic Italian food this is a great place to start, but I still prefer the one in town!"
Fast and efficient service,"Service was quite fast and efficient, even though they were full. We had burrata and pizza, and both were good!"
"Good food, acceptable service","The spaghetti carbonara and the pizzas were great but the grilled seafood was bland and a bit burnt. I had to ask for tobasco sauce. Overall, I had a pleasant experience."
"Good italian food, vibrant atmosphere","Was there on Mother’s day with no reservations. We walked in and the waitress helped to arrange some seats for us. She managed to slot us into the 7pm slot and told us to we need to give up the table at 8pm. We went for the table of 4.

Ordered the boston lobster pasta, baked scallops, meatballs pasta and a pizza con carne. The pasta and pizza were authentic and yummy.
Scallops were abit not so fresh? Meatballs were abit strong in taste for the kids. Overall we still loved the pasta. The complimentary basket of bread with every appetizer ordered was good too!

Staff wise, seemed abit overwhelmed by the full house crowd.

Will be back for more on normal days."
Great Italian in Singapore,I really enjoy eating her when I want to eat real Italian food. Good service but in my opinion most important: very good Pizza’s. Also great desserts and anti pasti.
An old favourite gone to the dogs,"Was there for Sunday brunch with friends. So disappointed. Not only were the brothers down at the other restaurant, the service was unorganised and quite frankly embarrassing. Nobody seemed to be in charge other than the guy pouring the wine, he did a great job!

Food was good but there wasn’t enough of it, took them an hour to replace the oysters and prawns which ran out in about 20 mins.

This place had the feeling that they are taking returning patronage for granted. If your looking for a Sunday brunch, look elsewhere. Until they can train others to take the restaurant as seriously as if they owned it themselves, this is a big miss I am afraid. Total shambles and everyone I spoke to in the restaurant agreed with that assessment."
Best Italian in Singapore,"I actually didn't want to write this review, because I don't want you crowding into this restaurant and taking my table :). Honestly this feels like Italy when you step into the restaurant, the owner ia great and the food delicious (best pizza in Singapore!!!)... Top that with good wine for decent prices and you have a winning option for a dinner."
My favorite authentic Italian restaurant,"I’ve been coming here since 1997 and I still choose it as my go-to place for comfortable and familiar Italian food. Love the sauté vongole, four cheese pizza, seafood baked pasta, grilled lamb, osso bucco, squid ink pasta, and of course, the desserts - panna cotta and tiramisu."
Great restaurant,"The restaurant is like a real Italian restaurant. I strongly suggest to try it! The pizza is really good, the ingredients are fresh and tasty. The Location is good and service is professional. Personally I recommend it."
Nostalgia,"I started patronising this restaurant when they entered Singapore at Goldhill Square. It must be more than 20 years ago. I’m not sure if it’s still the same owners.

So I ordered my favourite then, spaghetti vongole, which still as good. We also had a salad, margarita pizza and a grilled salmon, all to share. The dishes came out quickly and well prepared. The only negative was that they charges $2 for the bread basket."
Love the food,Had a small family celebration at the restaurant and it was our first time there. Love the food and we will definitely be back again.
Good food!,"We live close by and had probably been dismissing it as ‘yet another Italian joint’ despite hearing positive reviews of it.
Finally gave it a try and I think the pizzas have one of the best (thin) crusts I’ve ever had. I personally LOVED the crab pasta with tomato cream sauce and the kids are all over their meatball pasta - the meatballs are extremely moist!
Went there twice in 2 weeks and I think this will be a regular family joint.
Between us - 2 adults and 2 kids aged 6 and 9, we’d usually order the 2 pasta dishes and a pizza to share (the pasta portion is comfortable for one but the pizza, I think, can be shared between 2 adults) and such a meal, maybe with a beer/wine would be around $100.
Heard they do a good Sunday brunch too!"
Sunday brunch,First time trying out the Sunday brunch. Quality of food was superb. Refilling of food was prompt. Would definitely return again
Good food,"Enjoyed the food, service desserts and wine. Very consistent with their food and have been a repeat customer for years."
Great Italian sunday buffet on the East Coast,"Al forno is an Italian institution for expats and locals alike who live on the East side of Singapore and the food and relaxed atmosphere makes the eating experience highly enjoyable.
Particular mention must be given to Noel who makes everyone feel special due to his natural warmth towards people and adds to the already, very good ambience of the place.
A great place to unwind on a sunday afternoon."
Nice and cosy restaurant,"A very nice place for traditional Italian cuisine.Atmosphere is cosy and relax.
A place that serve traditional pasta, pizza ,dessert and some mains
Pizza is a must to try and freshly made and bake in the wood fire oven .pizza crust was airy and chewy.Every bite is fantastic and satisfying.
Love the tomato base pasta and the fresh ingredients that go into making the tomato base.
Ordered a tiramisu for dessert,not the best but it was as awesome.

A bad point is,the parking lot is limited and hard to get a parking space,but there are valet service available.

A good place to gave family/friends gathering and will be back for more dessert."
A real disappointment!!!,"After reading such great reviews about this place, I decided to go there with my husband for his birthday lunch. We ordered a Burrata to share which wasn't too bad though I have eaten better ones.. I ordered Spaghetti Aglio Olio with some veggies while my husband ordered Pollo In Padella and both turned out quite bad. The pasta was soaked in olive oil with no flavor whatsoever. The chicken that my husband ordered came with over-cooked and limp looking asparagus and completely runny white wine sauce. The mashed potato was also runny. Overall, it was a complete disappointment and let down. The only saving grace was their house pour Pinot Grigio. For a bill of $130 for 3 dishes you'd expect the food to be atleast decent. No complaints about the service though. Don't think will go back there any time soon."
"Excellent service, Amazing food...","Many Italian or European restaurants in Singapore offer either unimaginative food or mediocre service and sometimes both! On the contrary, Al Forno manages to deliver a good dining experience thanks to their quality of food and service. We had beef carpaccio for starters, then went for risottos and pasta. Every table had a pizza on it, therefore we decided to share a classic pizza which had fresh mozzarella and basil. The crust had beautiful wood fire charred bits which were amazing."
Nothing fancy,"It was fairly crowded as I visited be restaurant on a Sunday. However, all the food items we ordered were pretty much average. Nothing much in particular to point out."
The experience has been consistent over the years,"Good food, a little noisy as to be expected from a decent casual Itaian restaurant. Good porion sizes. Bring the children, not an issue. Strongly recommend that you make a reservation for dinner on weekdays and weekends."
Dinner,Food good and service good. Will come back again. Buratta is a must try and rest is up to you. Wine is reasonable.
Quality Italian at affordable prices,"Visited Al Forno twice for dinner in last 3 weeks. Enjoyed the buzz and chatter of a busy restaurant. Service is consistently great, the servers are attentive without being intrusive, and always service with a smile.

Between hubby and I, we savoured several dishes including the carpaccio, Parma ham with mozzarella, squid ink pasta, lobster pasta, pizza diavola, lemon ice and tiramisu. Starters were a very good size, pastas were al dente and flavoured so well, and my fave is the pizza baked in a traditional wood fire oven! Enjoyed them all tremendously. If you enjoy tiramisu, please order it for dessert... to die for!

Will definitely be back to sample more variety from the menu."
Good though a bit noisy,"Arrived there earlier than my reservation time and was allowed to sit and wait for my friend. Ordered the squid ink linguine pasta & minced beef pizza. Their pizza was thin crust & super yummy, squid ink pasta was good but there is sand in the clam shells but still edible. The atmosphere is quite noisy and the place is quite packed on Sat night after 7.30pm."
"Good food, nice ambience",Came here as couple. Enjoyed the al forno pizza and the pasta. Good size portion for the price and nice ambience. Pizza oven is a nice touch.
Comfort Italian Food,"An Italian restaurant in the neighbourhood. If you are looking for good comfort food, this is the place to be. Perfect for families but not for couples as it tend to be very noisy. I can hardly hear my partner. It gets a very low rating for ambience from me. If you are looking for somewhere quiet to have a nice dinner, this is not the place to be. It is also a little pricy for a neighbourhood restaurant. Parking is also very difficult here."
