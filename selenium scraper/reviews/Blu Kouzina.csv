Excellent Service and Food,"I am here to celebrate birthday. I am looking for nice lamb chop experience and come across Blu Kouzina. I am served by Honey and she is very professional. This is my first time experience here with Greek food and she is very patient in explaining and recommending the food to me. More importantly, she is not very hard sell as we are small eater. We ordered a Dips with grilled Pita Taramasalata and Paidakia lamb chop (4 pieces).

The lamb is excellent! Don‚Äôt have fancy sauce yet still very very nice. Can tell the lamb is very fresh. The dip is very different from other Greek restaurant too, the one I ordered is Cod dip so they have nice and gentle fish taste. Very unique!

I am here to celebrate birthday too and they allowed me to bring my own cake!

Highly recommend this place!"
All Girl's dinner,"The place was vibrant, it played amazing music and the cocktails were amazing. Food excellent too. Weekend nights here are lovely."
Food was excellent,"Food was tasty, full of flavour. Really enjoyed every dish that we had. Ordered Kebab platter, Vegetable Mousaka, Grilled octopus, pita bread and 3 dips (Taramasalata, red pepper and Tzatziki)."
Good ambience and nice food,"I like to go to Blu Kouzina as the place has nice ambience, nice food and great service. I like to be out side in the evening - it feels so relaxing"
Great food and fantastic service !,"Very friendly, cheerful & helpful staffs. Esp Marissa who served our table & gave my girl a birthday cake after knowing today is her birthday. Highly recommend this place. Thanks Marissa !"
Birthday lunch,"Met up with 2 friends celebrating their birthdays in January. Luckily we took the advice of our server to order the watermelon salad, the 3 dip Sharing platter, 2 pitas and the small meat platter rather than the larger serving size that we chose initially as the servings were large. Food was delicious especially the lamb. Only the beef was overcooked sadly and turned out tough and dry. Had a nice surprise after paying the bill when the server came over with a platter with a lit cupcake, watermelon slices and almond flakes. When he realised 2 people were celebrating their birthdays, he returned with another cupcake"
Poor customer service,"Ambience was good, but the food wasn't up to standard. Octopus Frites was battered with flour too thick and the taste was bad. Server didn't bother to replace the meal or offer another side dish and basically no customer service at all.
Drinks were also way overpriced. Table next to us left halfway with lots of leftover, showing how bad the food was that day."
Great ambience and food,"Location is very calm and peaceful with beautiful antique decorations - different types of umbrellas / display of antique wines, fresh vegetables, etc., Pita was soft and fresh and the dips combination was amazing. You can choose the dips according to your taste buds. We have tried almost all the vegetarian dishes available and Kunafeh, which are awesome. I feel it's a bit overpriced, but nevertheless it's a great experience."
"Good food, medium service and overpriced","Authentic Greek food, waiters could be more attentive, but crazy overpriced even for Dempsy. Cannot really recommend."
Sunday family dinner @Dempsey,"Lovely ambience set ontop of Dempsey Hill area opposite the Singapore Botanical Gardens.

Was very crowded when we arrived thus service crew was a bit slow to respond.

Even the ordered food took some time to arrive which they can improve on this area.

Taste of food was good, not that excellent as other Greek restaurant that I have been to.

Portion wise is ok and the price for this place and its food, its on the high end.

Overall, it was a good experience."
My first Greek food experience- Awesome,"Don‚Äôt be fooled by the small quiet entrance. I went on Thursday night and it was full house inside, thank goodness I had reservation.
Ambience is festive and welcoming, service is prompt when you get the busy waiters‚Äô attention (maybe understaffed but definitely friendly). Food was really good and highly recommend the earth salad, grilled octopus and lamb chop (I ordered 2 medium rare and 2 medium, nice that they can accommodate 2 type of doneness). Our server Eddy was really warm and friendly, thank you. Food portions are big, hence recommend to go as a group or order with moderation (which is tough as everything look so good). Will return"
A pleasant evening at Blu Kouzina,"Was greeted and served by very nice and friendly staffs. Ambiance was nice, food was delicious too. It the first time trying but was an eye opening"
Wonderful Place for friends and family,"Always had a great time here. Food was delicious, servers were very professional and efficient, ambience was great too. Highly recommended!"
great food great customer service üëçüèª,"was served by marissa who recommended the taramasalata. overall, the portions were huge but the food were great. furthermore, the food is value for money. would come back üòä"
Overpriced food and quality under par!,"This is not my first visit to Blu Kouzina but on this visit with a group of friends the quality was well below par.

All the mains were very salty and everyone in the group complained that it was. We were too engrossed in catching up with each other that we didn't complain to the waiter.

We had the sea bass before and it was excellent that time but I on this occasion it was tasteless and waste of money for a single seafood platter at $138++.

The starters we ordered were ok and the greek yoghurt with honey etc was average.

Didn't want to make a fuss as I had a guest over from abroad so sent the restaurant an email that evening. Two days later they still haven't responded so that says a lot about their customer service.

I might also add I went on a business dinner with a larger gathering some years ago when they were at their previous location. I still remember they missed my dessert and in the end gave up waiting.

I don't think I'll ever visit BK again and certainly wouldn't want to bring business clients here. You don't get value for money here and with a group of 4 and we just drank water, the bill of $440 was way excessive for the experience."
"Good food , great service.","When I walked into the restaurant, I felt like I was transported to a restaurant in Greece, wth the decor and the music. It was a cheery atmosphere, appropriate for a birthday celebration with the family. The food was good. I especially enjoyed the flatbread and the hummus. Service was great and the staff was very helpful in their recommendation of what to order. Credit should be given to them for their knowledge of what was on the menu."
Authentic Greek!!,Absolutely love the food here. Serves authentic Greek food. Loved everything we ordered especially the dips. Lots of options for vegetarians as well. The staff is also very friendly and attend you well!!
Vibrant,Dinner was great. Service was super fast. Plenty of choices for vegetarians too. The ambience is nice and adds to the experience
Greek cuisine,"We ordered a couple starters & salads which were OK. Unfortunately the mixed meat platter was dry & chewy except for the lamb chop. The octopus was also a disappointment. It‚Äôs best to stick to the same old, same old and not be adventurous"
"Great meats and dips, octopus to die for","My second time here. Ordered the 4 dip option: more than enough for my group of 6. Had to take home the balance. The medium meat platter was also 20% doggy bagged: The grilled octopus is highly recommended (best I have eaten anywhere), and the greek salad was fresh and went well with the slab of feta cheese. Staff were friendly, and food served fast as there was a later seating. Allocated 2 hours enough to get through the meal."
Memorable,Jude welcomed my husband and I and recommended a most suitable meal of salad and meat set. We had wanted to add in pita but he advised against it as he said the avocado salad was substantial and he was right! Salad was special as it had a spicy tinge. Meat on skewers set was also very good. Particularly enjoyed the marinates on the meats and the veg that accompany were also very suitable. The house wine completed our meal nicely. Will definitely visit again. *** Jude & Julia
Quality food,"Great service, beef skewers were great. Quality food. I prefer the outdoor seating in the evening. Lunch time better to be inside"
Siglap,The food was awesome the lamb in the meat platter stood out. Marissa served us very well. Will come back again. -Ash & Jos
Very good Greek food,"We were recommended this by our daughter and S-I-L when we went to Dempsey - an ex-Army Barracks now a cool area with shops and boho feel.
We were able to get an outside table for the 4 of us and had dips with pitta bread followed by a meat feast which was ample enough for the 4 of us. The meat was grilled beautifully and the lamb chop was gorgeous.
I would definitely go again."
Team Dinner at Blu Kouzina Dempsey,"Good food and nice ambience. For group meal of more than 10 pax, good to pre-order so that dishes can be ready for cooking when my guests arrived. No waiting time."
Authentic delicious food at yummy prices,"I had invited a group of friends to Blu Kouzina for lunch. Service is impeccable, thanks to Chocky 's pleasant personality and attention to every detail.
The fish was grilled to perfection, the lamb chops were tender and the greek salad refreshing.The platter of desserts was prefect.

Good food, great service. Highly recommended"
Greek Dinner!,"Went there for dinner, food was fresh, Shanker served us, very helpful to recommend popular dishes, gave complementary birthday dessert :)"
Not good anymore,We found that the food was not the same as a few years back. The quality of food is now mediocre. We were extremely disappointed
great place,i love the food here and the environment is somewhat great. thank you for the warm welcome and will be back again
"food was amazing, but mixed feelings about the staff","Went on a Sunday for brunch for 2pax, we sat indoor.
It was difficult to call for someone to take our order as the staff appeared to non-aware of people sitting in tables. We saw other tables facing similar problems too. When we finally got the attention of 1 of the staff, his tone was quite rushed and wasn't friendly in responding to us when we asked about recommendations of what to eat as its our first time.

However, after our meal we spoke with one of the staff who was kind, attentive and efficient in us enquiring about add-ons to our orders and for takeaway."
Blue Kouzina Dempsey,"Grilled octopus, lamb mousaka and pomegranate pasta with king prawn were all awesome. Service was efficient though restaurant was crowded. A pity about the Greek beer which was disappointing. Availability of draught beer would be most welcome ."
Family Dinner,"Food was fantastic & flavourful. Portions are generous to fulfill our hunger. This is our first time here and definitely not the last. Dips are soooo good specially the melinzanosalata. Saganaki & figs must eat while it is hot to enjoy the best taste. Lamb Rack was huge per piece. Kotopoulo Fourno, tender and tasty, the sauce suits well with the chicken. Crockery are cute, i loved the most is their coffee cup. Service is good however it can be improve (understand it is super busy and can see that staff are trying their best.) We thought of skipping dessert because we are so full, but nah.... we are here already, might as well try their dessert (as we all know quite difficult to book this restaurant). My kids loved their ice cream (sounds boring but yes, their ice cream are special, melts in your mouth). To complete our meal, we had Bougatsa, good to pair with vanilla ice cream."
Brilliant Food!!,What a great find! The food was great and they were able to cater for gluten free! The gf pita was so good!!
Fabulous service by Michelle and Marissa,Thank you for the awesome hospitality Michelle and Marissa! You overheard that it was my sons 10th birthday and out of the blue came with a cupcake. And even sang him a song. Thank you thank you!!!!
"Yummy greek food, cozy place","Good place to hang out with friends, Ambience is very cozy and the food is super yummy too. Good service from Michelle and Marissa."
Superb Greek cuisine in Dempsey Hill,"Excellent Greek cuisine with cozy ambience. Despite the crowds on a Sunday; staff were attentive and friendly. Loved everything we ordered - Dip Better (pita bread with hummus, tzatziki, Tirokafteri.); artichoke salad had a nice tangy taste which was refreshing & appetising. the grilled octopus was tender & tasty. Mouzzaka has a very nostalgic & homely taste. We also liked the plomari ouzo, a Greek star anise flavoured aperitifs . Before we leave, we ordered / Greek desserts which were all superb - Baklava & Greek Kataifi rolls and finished off with Greek coffee."
Blu Kouzina- Siglap,"Our second time to the outlet. Cosy, decor - simple and rustic. Service staff is very attentive and professional. Excellent service. Food was delicious and very consistent in bought taste and presentation. Must orders- grilled octopus- tender and grilled to perfection, dips, saganaki, spanakopita and watermelon salad- refreshing, meats - lamb and beef so tender and juicy. Overall a very good food experience yet again."
Amazing place for celebrations,Went there for my wedding anniversary dinner and was greeted by very friendly staffs around the restaurant and a champagne on the house üëçüèªThey even greet my daughters and made them so happy. The food and place was awesome. Will definitely go back again.
Unexpected find,Chanced upon this restaurant simply by accident. M so surprised by the hummus and pita. Meat platter was super delicious too Maria showed us great hospitality too.
Nice Location - Average Food,My first visit and like the location and ambience but the overall experience was average. Food prices are quite high for the quality. Serving size ok but just average food. Service was hit and miss depending on the wait staff.
"Food is amazing, experience was not up to the price point","I specified this was a birthday reservation. The staff at the entrance ignored us and walked by us several times. Like not even acknowledging our presence. We were walked to a small table into a very noisy indoor space. Not the kind of romantic dinner I had in mind for a birthday. No care was given by the waiters, we had to call them several times to get what we wanted. Never had the same waiter twice, no special attention was given to us. As usual terrible service in SG and very poor atmosphere/experience for that price tag. Will not come again."
Outstanding service!,"We came here for lunch and chose to seat outside because the ambiance reminded us of Santorini. We would like to thank all of the chefs who created our magnificent meal, as well as the nice staffs justin and yubin who provided us with excellent service. We will definitely return."
Excellent Service,"Came to Blu Kouzina to celebrate my friend‚Äôs 30th, and I must say, this place is awesome! Was greeted warmly by Chocky and she was really attentive to us the whole time. The food choices she recommended was great, and she even threw in a cake for my friend. My friends and I had an amazing time thanks to her excellent service, and will definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Greek food. Thank you again Chocky, we will be back!"
Great spot super expensive,Well would of gotten 5 but some of the staff not really into there work and very very expensive for what it is but???? The food is amazing totally amazing but two sandwiches little dips all in no drinks 128.00
Great Greek food,"Really enjoyed the ambience and the food. Lamb moussaka was awesome, comparable to what we had in Athens. Very good service also. We went on a Monday night and were surprised to see it packed! Recommend to book a table earlier."
Nice ambience but food is mediocre,"We ordered a wrap and the sauce tasted strange whilst the eggplant was too salty. Ambience is good, service was ok and that‚Äôs about it."
Will definitely be backüëç,The food and wine was very good and the service was excellent. Meschalle was very attentive and courteous and took care of our needs. Will definite be returning
Birthday Celebration,Excellent food always. Loved the grill set esp the lamb chops. The staff were attentive and made the visit very special. üëç
Good place and nice food for friends and family gathering,"very unique and good quality, nutritious Greek food. Frill fish is our fav. Friendly Waiters and Waitresses. Thanks Uncle bob for introducing the food and wine. The wine and desert very nice also."
Good food and service,"Excellent service provided by Uncle Bob, Murali and Bernard. Tried the lamb chops, grilled octopus and red pepper dip with pita. The lamb chops were delicious. I quite like the red pepper dip as well."
"Delicious meal in a festive, informal setting","We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner for four on a Sunday night. We had the three-dip starter (the white cod dip was particularly good), fried calamari, grilled octopus, lamb and chicken kebabs, and the artichokes. Love the artichokes. Not a fan of minced meat kebabs, so I'll refrain from commenting there. The calamari was as good as I've ever had anywhere else, and accompanied by a yogurt dip.

The tables, however, were a little small, and the chairs, rather uncomfortable. I sat indoors. The seats at the outdoor tables looked more comfortable, but the evening was a little too warm and muggy to be dining al fresco.

We also had a bottle of rose, and the price came up to about SGD$85 per person. A little expensive for this sort of food, in my opinion."
Good food,"We ordered 3 dips, a seafood platter and a meat platter to share. The food was very delicious, and the service was good even on a busy Saturday evening."
Good Food But Fair Arrangement for Appointment,"I have requested indoor table during my appointment but was arranged to sit outdoor once arrived. I am not sure how the restaurant manage their appointment while some walk-in diner can sit indoor. There were many indoor tables still in vacant.

However, upon my several times of request, the waiter finally arranged a indoor table for me.

If they cannot guarantee the seat, it is better to inform us in advance and I may have not considered to make the appointment."
Great food but note the fine print for sitting options,"I have been to Blu Kouzina many times and while the place is slightly costly, I love the greek food there.
It has happened to me a couple of times but this time was a bit unnerving where I was offered an outside table. I could see there were tables available inside and it was a hot afternoon.
I asked them to give me an indoor option and they said no.
When I spoke to the superior, he asked me where I made the reservation and if I used Chope, it clearly says that seating is based on availability and discretion.
I did not want to create a scene and I told them if a table clears up, we would like to move inside.
The manager/supervisor tried to 'buy me off' with a - i give you drink from my side.
I politely declined the drink saying - i do not want a drink - just let me know when a table inside gets free.
As I waiting for my friend to arrive, I called up Margarita's asking if they had a walk-in with a table for 2 inside and they said yes.
In the meanwhile, a lady whose dog I was petting and saying hi to walked past me and said - I will tell them to give you a table.
I do not know whether she was an owner or someone who knew the management but she probably did and in a few minutes I was asked to come inside and was offered a table inside.
I do not like to bring racism into everything - but this incident did get me thinking - was I being blind to some subtle racism that is happening in Singapore....and therefore as a side - I am an Indian and the lady who offered to speak to the manager was Caucasian (with am amazingly cute bulldog)"
Dining Experience,Had a pleasant dining experience! They have a great selection of vegetable dips that‚Äôs filling and delicious! Great customer service and was dedicatedly tended by Ben; who recommended other great dishes and made sure we‚Äôre well taken care of. Thanks Ben!
Overall experience: BAD!,"1) Restaurant closing at 9.30 PM on a Saturday
2) When you want to go digital, make sure your menu is made for it. Extremely bad to use your printed version, it is not readable.
3) Staff urging us to pay and go, early!

We made a booking on a SATURDAY, 8.30 PM, arrived on time.
At the table stands 4 QR codes to scan to access the menus. One for each of the following, wine / food / dessert / Beverages. If you like to open QR codes, zoom in, out, again and again, you‚Äôll be happy. We were not. After spending my time zooming on a menu made to be printed (large with few columns), I asked for a printed version, which doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. I got an iPad, it was better. Now, I must say that if you want to go digital, make your menu for it. Your solution of using your artwork is not user friendly, at all!
Now, the service and the food. After ordering our dishes, drinks, around 8.50pm (takes time to scan over and over each menu‚Ä¶) and getting them after 9.00pm, the staff is already asking us what's next, dessert etc.
How could we know how many dessert, or food we wish to have since we didn‚Äôt start eating. Overall experience, bad!
The food is good to me, but I will never go back there as the overall consumer experience is very bad."
Delicious food and friendly service,"Went to the restaurant at Siglap to celebrate my wife's birthday and was fortunate to have Uncle Bob as our waiter. Professional as he knows his products on the menu like the back of his hands and trust me, Greek words are not easy to pronounce let alone remember. Honest as he guided us in our order that was of perfect portion for our family of 6. From food to wine pairing, Uncle Bob definitely knows what he is introducing. On top of his friendly persona, Uncle Bob was also super customer oriented. He sorted out our seating arrangements without disruption, engages us with small talks and constantly check on us to ensure the Greek cuisine suits our palette. This trip to Blu Kouzina Siglap was worth all the while. The other waiters were also super friendly and accommodating too. Keep up the good work. I dun mind paying and definitely won't mind paying for super service"
Amazing experience,"Excellent service and hospitality by Uncle Bob and Bernard. Loved the food, ambience and service. Must try their food and alcohol."
Excellent Ambience and Wonderful Food,"We ordered the Taramasalata Dip, which was amazingly good. The Xtapodi (grilled octopus) was delicious, although it would have been better if it served warmer. Topped that with the sirloin, which was done medium, we had an extremely satisfying meal."
Amazing food and hospitality!!!,"Look out for Faiz and Uncle Bob!

The hospitality is mad crazy. Took my husband there since his trip back to Singapore from Melbourne. I‚Äôm his words ‚Äúevery bite is yummy‚Äù. They recommend their favourites with your orders and suggests what goes well with what you have ordered. Had a dip recommended by Akshay that blew our minds. Super yummy!

We got complementary ice cream and a mastika shot! Beat that! A Greece experience all in all!

It‚Äôs my second trip here and I foresee coming back to try their meat platter and prawns!"
Excellent service and food,"Had a great birthday dinner at Blu Kouzina, it was a great night. The food and service was excellent üëå Will definitely go back and highly recommended üëç"
First time trying,"Went there on a Saturday evening. The food is great, good ambience and affordable. Better to make reservation as it seems pack."
"Good food, lousy service",Food is excellent no matter what you eat. Service is there to push you and dont think about customer convenience.
Excellent Service with Good food and drinks!!,"Last August 07, my friend and I dined at this restaurant on the spur of the moment, and we were very fortunate that Sam, the Manager, and his colleague Christelle assisted and accepted us despite the fact that we had not made a reservation. Even though it was already late, they managed to provide us with excellent service. We really enjoyed the food and drinks, as well as the ambiance. Because of the amazing interior design and music, we feel as if we are in Greece. We highly recommend this location, particularly for tourists like us. It's a 10/10 experience!"
Disappointing,"It was our first time visiting the restaurant with many giving us rave reviews. We were seated without even a warm welcome or a smile. We were left to figure out what to do. When we raised it to the supervisor, he was not even apologetic and just walked away. It is definitely disappointing and being first time in a greek restaurant, some help will be great with the dishes. The supervisor was no where to be seen thereafter. My visit was on 18 Aug and our serving time is 11.30am for a table of 5."
"Great food, but pricey","Great food and service, the the dips are a must order. The food is on the pricier side but it reflects the quality Would still return though"
Great brunch for families with kids,The food tasted nice and very fresh. The atmosphere was great for families with kids. My friends and I all liked it and plan to go back again.
Enjoyable dinner,"We ordered both Meat platter and lamb cutlets . Lamb cutlets were cooked perfectly. However, beef and chicken are overdone and rather dry. Chef responsible for cooking beef must not over cooked the meat ."
Lunch @ Blu Kuzina,Fabulous atmosphere and food. Really enjoyed our lunch. Service was lovely and overall a great experience.
There for the dips and meats!,"Had a hard time booking a slot at the restaurant. No one answered the phone on the 2 occasions when I tried to call. Was there to celebrate my mama‚Äôs birthday with my family. We ordered both the meat and seafood platters and the dips and pita bread which‚Äôs a must. Meat platter with the lamb chops and beef were the best! Only the kebabs, they were quite disappointing. Other than that, service and ambience were great!"
Memorable Greek food in Singapore,"Visited the Siglap outlet. The ambience was prolly as close to me being in the Mediterranean . The decor of some parts of the restaurant and blue-ish serving plates made me feel like I‚Äôm on a holiday in Greece.

The service staff led by Samsul were very attentive ( felt like a Greek goddess! Lol!) . Their food recommendations were on point for the evening too.

Had the cauliflower soup of the day as a starter. The simplest serving was well presented - had caramelised shallots as garnish and a dash of dill leaves. It truly warmed my stomach (and my soul).

Seafood platter - I had mine without the octopus cos Samsul mentioned that it would have been cooked with wine, a dietary restriction for me. Replaced with calamaris. That Smokey grilled after-taste mixed with ‚Äúocean‚Äù freshness of the seafood in the dish speaks for itself. I also had the meat platter medium - thank god didn‚Äôt go for the grilled meat board. The serving was huge!

Had the traditional Greek salad, pita with assorted dips, pizza (I think), a mocktail and what‚Äôs a meal without desserts. I particularly enjoyed the Ice Cream and was told it was churned in-house. Smooth and creamy as how real ice cream is supposed to be. The cheeses in some of the dishes were too salty to my palette but prolly that is how they should taste like?

Price point? It‚Äôs reasonable imo for the service , flavours and presentation.

A wonderful place for communal dining and family gatherings but not quite for a quiet date."
Service attention has deteriorated since previous visits,"All the main courses came out together, we just did not have enough time to enjoy the food as they became cold"
"Great food , 10/10 service ! I enjoyed myself very much !","I had the lamb chops , chicken skewers , 3 varieties of dip with grilled pita and kanefe.

Everything was delicious , the dips was great , the lamb chops was juicy and delicious !!!!! The chicken also !!

Kanefe was yummy! The beautiful scent and floral of the honey that compliments with it !

Overall with the help of Uncle Bob to guide us thru the menu and selection of food n drinks

10/10!!!"
Greek,"One of the few greek restaurants in singapore. Maybe some of the ingredients from greece, so items not cheap. $20 for mezzes and starters, $40-$100 for mains. Ok food and service"
unique gourmet,"Food is great and very authentic Greek. Menu covers a wide range of Greek food, alcohol and non-alcohol drinks, wine. Good for both meat lovers and vegetarians."
Bull‚Äôs Eye üëçüèΩ,The heartiest homecoming meal for a friend who has been away for the past four years. We celebrated xx years of friendship and her return over the juiciest seafood and tastiest meat with rich hummus spreads over warm bread.
Nice ambience but food quality needs to be improved,Nice ambience but food quality needs to be improved. Just find the food is slightly over priced. There is no set lunch.
Birthday Visit!,"Uncle Bob was amazing! He recommended us on what to eat and everything was super good! 10/10 will come again! He also assisted with a cute bday celebration for my bestie, and also sang happy birthday which was super cute: we had a lovely Saturday and will definitely be back!"
Not attentive to guests requirements,"We made a reservation for 5 persons and only a small standard table for four was provided, with an additional seat by the side. When asked, was told that larger tables are not guaranteed. First ever such ridiculous reason I have ever heard from a restaurant. Their supervisors/managers are not trained for public relations."
Nice food and ambience,Its a nice place with tasty food and gud ambience .veg wrap is a must try and french fries along with it..was really crisp and tasty..
Good location for Office Cohesion,"Organised a company event through Sam and everything was great. He was patient to go through the menu with us and recommends food based on our likes and dislikes. Excellent service staff as well, recommended!"
Celebration Lunch,"16 of us for lunch, food was excellent ( various dips, lamb skewers, zucchini fritters, spanakopita) and service with Mr Khor and Mac in charge made for a truly enjoyable family reunion and celebration"
Excellent Dinner,Octopus and meat platter cooked to perfection. Delightful location. Nice Greek wine list. I recommend a visit.
Poor experience,"We tried to cancel our chicken skewers after waiting over 40mins. The minute we said to cancel cos we had finished all our other food, they said we could not cancel as order had been put in and miraculously it arrived 3 minutes later! I packed it as we were done with dinner. They charged me $70 for 2 skewers and it was dry and tasteless. It really ruined my experience."
Awful,"Food was very greasy and too much dressing. However the worst was the service. We arrived at 8:15 and started eating at around 8:45. But at 9:15, the waiter came to tell us it was last orders ON A SATURDAY evening. We informed him that we did not want anything else so he brought the bill while we were eating our main course. First lesson as a waiter is to only bring the bill if and when asked by the client. The restaurant was still full but the overall feeling was that you had to gulp down the food so the waiters could quickly go back home. F&B is about offering a nice experience and us guests are willing to pay high price to enjoy this privilege. If going out now means having to eat fast so the waiters can get back home quickly, then the core reason of being of working in a restaurant has disappeared"
"Wonderful food, staff and experience at BK-Dempsey","Wonderful Birthday celebration at BK today. Compliments and special thanks to Carol who served our table of 9pax. She was very patient, friendly and accommodating. All the dishes she recommended were fantastic and very delicious. She made our dining experience at BK an unforgettable one."
Great Food and Great Atmosphere,"This place does not disappoint. I went with my Son for Fathers Day dinner. I had been prior to COVID, so not for a few years. Food was great, very tasty and Authentic Greek. We ended up taking food home for another great meal."
"Staff uninterested, left after 20 mins.",Can‚Äôt say what the food was like as after 20 mins left as nobody was interested in taking our order. Pity as the place used to be great. Under new management ?
Truly Greek,This is the only Greek restaurant I frequent. I‚Äôve lived in Athens before and missed the fresh ingredients there. Blu Kouzina reminds me of my time there
Great service,The service was on point! And as always we thoroughly enjoyed the food and ambience. We'll definitely be visiting them again.
Slipped,"Food average, especially moussaka cold in middle Service, nice guy but some waiters wandering round with track pants. Atmos, v nice in Dempsey"
A Greek place to go!,"Great food, good service, bang for the buck. Lovely ambience overall. The Lamb is a must, and the Kebab is a plus."
Octopus rocks!,"Went with my boys and really enjoyed the whole experience. Service was attentive and fast, and ambience inviting. But what triumphed and rocked for my family is the grilled octopus! At $40, it's not exactly cheap but worth every cent. it was grilled to perfection - not too tough with just a nice tinge of smokiness. The olive oil that comes with it enhanced the flavour perfectly! Will definitely be back!"
Very pleasant fresh food,Restaurant has good variety of dishes and great taste of freshness. Perfect combination between Arabic and Mediterranean foods.
Totally delicious!,"Love Blu Kouzina! They even do gluten free pittas! The quality of the meat is very good, dips and Greek salad were delicious!"
Amazing place for dinner!,"I celebrated my friend's birthday there and the staff (Mr Koh) was really nice and helpful. Dishes recommended were amazing and really catered to my special requests for her birthday. Ambience was amazing. However, food was slightly on the pricier side."
From service to food,"Generous, fresh and good value for money. Great atmosphere alfresco, and the staff is always on top. They know your preferences and will always make sure that you are very well attended!
Not fine dining, for sure, but the best place to hangout with friends, share good mediterranean food with wine."
Good Restaurant for Fam & Frens,Good octopus. Bacclava dry. Ok service. Ambience is quite vibrant since the last time I‚Äôve visited yrs ago.
Love the food. Love the service,"Start with the pita and dips. All the main dishes will not disappoint you. The beef kebab, Moussaka, lamb chop are all delicious and satisfying. Even for a non lamb eater, the lamb chop is tasty. The food portion is quite big."
Awesome place for Greek food,Nice food with great services. Must order the octopus...the lamb...the beef and also the dip & pita.
