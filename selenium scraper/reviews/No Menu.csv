High Quality for High Prices,"Let me be upfront and say that the prices are EXTRAVAGANT. The only way to salvage that is excellent quality, and for sure this restaurant delivers. Incredibly fresh burrata, wonderful wine selection, and exquisite pastas with complex, layered flavours and fresh ingredients. Even the bread is lovely, and the comfort of homecooked Italian food is tangible with every bite. Whether authentic home cooking, as the restaurant claims, is worth a home’s nightly rental is entirely up to you."
Wonderful Italian food in Singapore,"We always come here for authentic and delicious Italian food! The prices are a little more pricey, but this is the general norm for Italian food in Singapore. They have seasonal dishes regularly based on the fresh goods they bring in and is something to look forward to. Their service is always impeccable too!"
Good but expensive,We booked in here after being in a cocktail bar. The food is Italian and the starters were very good and tasty as were the mains. My only gripe would be that the wine was expensive even for Singapore were alcohol seems to be ferociously taxed.
Will not go again even if paid,"Bad Service. Mediocre food. Over priced. Would rate it less than a 1/5 if i could. Over charged and then threatened to get kicked out for complaining. Worst was the management staff, rude and aggressive."
I thought this was surposed to be Italian.... have you even been to italy?,"Rude management, I don't know if she is Italian or french but she was so rude to guests as they came in...

The food itself was well under par, the steak was ok but the pasta was undercooked, and the sauce tastes like it was straight from the bargain basement ...

I certainly would not eat here, i paid $150 ++ for something that pasta mania would serve for $20......"
"The most Racist establishment i have ever entered, they should be ashamed....","I have never had management personel racially abuse me, tell me my kind are not welcome in there and to go back to my own country,...... This by the italian manaagment ....... The MOM should look into such awful racial discriation that abuses the laws that we set here in Singapore.......

I am disgusted by the management team, the only saving grace was the wonderful singaporean waitress that wa shocked by her management and couldnt do enough to try and make our meal a pleasant evening...... unfortunately such disgusting rasism cn not be covered up...... I hope the video will show these racists in the light they are."
My favorite Italian restaurant in Singapore,"If you're looking for top quality Italian cuisine with a vibrant dining atmosphere and passionate owners, this is the place to go to in Singapore. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time as it does get busy. The place is closed over the weekend."
Great food and amazing service,"An amazing restaurant. My first time based on a recommendation by a friend. Amazing food cooked by Gaia Forlino. Such beautiful home style Italian cooking. The wine list is also great with good decent value.

I had the degustation menu as it was my first time. Such great food the appetizers were amazing. The bruschetta was simply amazing. The porcini with cod and mashed potatoes simply great and the pasta and veal ravioli perfection. The food was so good that I forgot to take pictures of the fiorentina steak and deserts.

Sorry but simply amazing!"
Thoroughly enjoyable,"Thoroughly enjoyable evening. We took the ‘no menu’ option and it was amazing. Fantastic food, attentive service and really good wine list"
Overpriced,The abince is well decorated it feels like your in Italy. Staff is very attentive and helpful. Food and wine is excellent but on the high side. Overall great place for a first time try.
Good food and great service!,"During the pandemic, finding a good restaurent is precious- it brightens up your day and makes up for all the restrictions we have to live with.
We came to this restaurent with a rather strange name ( No Menu?? ) without any high expectations: so it was such a pleasure to find dish after dish so memorable! The marinated raw salmon was much appreciated. The Baccala with porcini mushrooms was even better. And the lamb rack was awesome! Not easy to find such a plump, juicy and perfectly cooked lamb here! I was personally disappointed with the agnolotti del plin with truffles- I felt the truffles would have been better appreciated on another dish- it did not do justice to the truffles.
We had however, a charming meal experience, enjoying wines from Piedmont. Will return another day when the chef get’s back from his vacation."
Great Italian family Eatery,"Small Italian family eatery, feels very warm and cosy. Friendly staff and family owners welcomes the guest while the chef from time to time comes around the tables. The food served is authentic Italian. Great Burrata with Parma ham, pastas, fried calamari- crispy and soft in the inside and a good lemon butter pan fried fish. Tiramisu and their giandua was wonderful."
"Good food, pleasant atmosphere but pricey","Lunch this time, wine per glass at around S$20, nice but not spectacular. Ossobuco cooked to perfection with good (but not splendid) risotto. A lukewarm octopus salad and good tortelone. Service is good and attentive, although the wine was at first forgotten, you can order anything you want, but in the end it is 'just' good country style food for 200 dollar..."
Best italian restaurant in Singapore,Family owned and very authentic. Food is delicious and the staff is as warm as an Italian staff should be. Worth the price you pay. Best in town!
Excellent ribeye,Went on 23 Dec with another couple. The place is full. Very decent space between tables perhaps becoz of safe distancing so you feel comfortable. Staff are cheerful and effecient. My steak is excellent. Another had sole and said it was excellent too
Great Italian food,"It was a very good experience at No Menu, we decided to try the ""surprise"" menu and we were totally satisfied!
5 courses, everything was high level.
Service is good and attentive.
Ambiance is nice but a bit noisy, it depends also by who's next to your table..
A bit pricey, but you won't regret as the quality is top."
What a disappointment...,"I heard positive comments about ""No Menu"" so I came with expectations... what a disappointment it was!!

Mediocre food was one thing but how the waiter staff constantly tried to oversell was just way too much. They were so pushy...

At time of bringing the starters, the waiter came in and introduced the “white truffle"" by the gram, with the weighting scale asking that we say “stop” to stop the shaving. I have rarely seen such a well organised scam.

We were enjoying our wine at the time (the only positive of the night, a Piemont Gaja) and she was so quick in getting around the table frantically shaving, my friends didn’t react at the time but I had to say stop when it came to my wife and refused being served any when it came to me. At SGD 14 per gram, in less than 30 seconds going around the guests it ended up in a 215 SGD “white truffle” bill.

Seriously…. I know about this beautiful mushroom, you actually need very little to give taste to your dishes. This one had no taste at all…

The pizza ordered by my friend arrived not hot and dry and the seabass arrived late (oh by the way, this was the seabass the waiter said the chef told him was very special). I love cooking and we do seabass a lot and this one had nothing special at all.

When it came to receiving my main meal (I ordered truffle tagliatelle); spaghetti, yes, spaghetti, came in the most simple way with nothing on it and again the scale with the same white truffle they brought us for starters!! I declined getting any overpriced tasteless “truffle” in a pretty stern way and asked for black pepper and Parmigianno. At that time they must have realised I was really pissed off as they proposed to serve me complementary truffle but I refused. Too much is too much.

3 among the 5 of us were celebrating their birthday so quite special occasion. I can’t say much of a disappointment it was.

No menu for me is now “Non Merci”.

Never again."
Friday lunch,"You know what you get when you go to No Menu. Great food, the pasta here is amazing. I had the Vitello Tonnato, it feels like I am in Italy. My pasta was also delicious."
Good Italian Food in Singapore,"This intimate family Italian restaurant is such a fun place for lunch. Friendly service where most of the staff are from Italy. If you like truffle and burrata, this will be your place. I was fond of the ossobuco. The wine selection is impressive."
Authentic family cook Italian cuisine,"Own and cooked my Italian family restaurant with very authentic Italian cooking. Simple food like fried calamari, burrata cheese with ham and sautéed clams with white wine can be so so good here. The truffle pasta kind of average. The pork chop with crispy potato toppings are just average . Lovely wine selection with friendly waiter to attend to you."
Delicious food and good service,"Love the food and the service at No Menu. We’ve been back a few times after discovering the restaurant in January. I love the Buratta with Parma ham, it’s so fresh and the cherry tomatoes are delicious! Also recommend their Tiramisu and panacotta. We’ve been there as a couple, and with family and friends and had a great experience each time."
No Menu great place for Italian food,"No Menu has delicious Italian food. The service is excellent, the place is nice and very busy. We had their “degustation” menu which consisted on an antipasti plate which was delicious. Then the pasta dish which has three types: gnocchi, bolognese and a risotto. Then you can choose from fish or meat. And last the dessert which consisted of tiramisu, apple cake and pannacota.
It is a great place for a meal, recommended."
Super over priced,Food is ok here but I would say for the amount you pay not worth it. My husbands family is Italian so he makes all of our Italian dishes so maybe my pallet is tuned to his food but I think in general the food was not overly impressive. The tiramisu and apple cake were really good and the pasta was fresh good flavor and not eggy so that was another plus. I think it’s hard to do good Italian in Singapore without it being super expensive...it’s just not worth it for me
Great Italian Food!,"A cozy family style Italian restaurant, giving you a felling of having a fine Italian meal at your home. We order 3 appetisers from house recommendation to share with 4 individual dishes and everything was delicious. Good wine selection however found bit expensive."
Loved this restaurant. Great,"Loved this restaurant. Great food , excellent service. The upstairs dining room is small and intimate- with an antique, cosy feel. Even let you try wines before ordering - when only having a glass and open a new bottle for you! We’ll definitely be back ."
Amazing Italian food,"The kitchen is authentic Italian. They are great at catering to intolerances and allergies. Staff professional, helpful, nice."
"No Menu now has a menu, but still no personality","Our group had dinner in the homely private dining room upstairs. The best things about the evening were the superb friendly and proactive service, and the focaccia! The mains - be it asparagus risotto or chicken milanesa - were decent, but nothing to write home about. There are many better Italian restaurants around, including in the CBD."
a beautiful surprise,"New Year's Eve dinner, the place looks good, small but welcoming, although the place was full it was not noisy.
Excellent service, complete menu and typically for the Christmas occasion according to Italian tradition.
Strictly Italian wine list.
The dishes were served quickly and the quality was very high, 100% the taste as in Italy.
I highly recommend it."
Italian Restaurant,"We had made a reservation and saw that we really didn't need one, not that busy. I had the lasagna which was ok, but a good size. My husband had the chef menu which was a lot of courses and pretty good size portions. He thought the food was ok. I was not too impressed by restaurant, just ok Italian."
Expected more,"Friday night at No Menu, dinner for 4. The Burrata was the highlight and best I have had The main course duck was dry with a few steamed vegetables. A simple, small dish that I have had better in many establishments at near half the price. Pasta dishes were good but not particularly special and the most expensive pasta I have seen. Similar dishes on the cruise ship we arrived on were definitely better. Other items were good but not better than can be easily found elsewhere, again at half the price. We were seated downstairs in the main restaurant. I am not sure why that would be preferred. It was crowded and so noisy that conversation was near impossible. Service was friendly and quite prompt. So in summary I just cannot find it in me to give more than 3 stars for a fairly average Italian meal with prices the highest I have seen anywhere for similar fare. I expected much more and left feeling disappointed."
Don't sit upstairs otherwise you might be surrounded by children,"No Menu used to be one of our favorite restaurants. The service and food were consistently good and the staff was always friendly. My husband and I decided to go there a few months ago for a date night. We were immediately ushered to the front room upstairs. Of the other four tables, three of them were families with children. Having children myself, I normally don't mind being in restaurants with well behaved kids. However, in this situation it felt like we were misfits who were conveniently put in the ""family"" room. We would have appreciated being seated in the back room upstairs room or downstairs where there we no kids. Instead of requesting to be moved, I assumed we would have a great dining experience which would erase any bad feelings about the seating situation. Unfortunately the server was not very friendly and seemed to rush us. Besides our server none of the other staff or owners came to our dining room, another reason we felt ignored. Food was fine, not as good as we remembered. We ate our meal and went somewhere else for drinks and dessert . We were out of there in less than an hour. It's too bad that we had such a disappointing experience and will not return. We used to really like the place."
Homely Italian restaurant,How often do you see an Italian lady chef commanding the restaurant in Singapore? You know the food will have authentic taste of Italy. The black truffle smells intriguing good that makes you salivate. Delicious comfort food! Can't wait to be back to try more dishes
Delicious Italian food,"Perfect place to enjoy delicious Italian dished (eg pasta with butter sauce and truffles, burrata salad). Wine list is also large including great wines at reasonable price Finished dinner with very tasty deserts Overall great experience"
It’s great Italian Ambience 👍,"We came here unplanned - caught our attention with plenty of dishes to choose.

Ambience - very Italian style and attended with numbers of Italian staff. Making it feeling more like you’re in Italian restaurant

Menu List - great selection of appetisers, pasta, main course, etc..
But they don’t share us the Drinks list

Service - staff were friendly, attentive, and ready to suggest you with something their restaurant’s good with. Food also came pretty quick

Food Quality and Portion - it’s very nice I would say for someone who have small stomach like us but maybe not so big for others. Taste quality, we both ordered pasta - our opinions, it’s alright really nothing so special. Thought the Bolognese Pasta was disappointing taste, couldn’t taste that much of the beef especially the sauce. The Prawn, Chili and Garlic Pasta - it’s good but nothing special. Happy that they offering half bottle of wine. So we had white wine to share.

Price - can be pricey for most, we paid for half bottle of wine SGD49. And overall we paid more than SGD100 for 2 dishes and drinks.

In the end, we’re offered with cheese, meringue and pudding( I think) and it’s great taste. Very typical way serving in the end by typical Italian restaurants.

Overall experience was pretty great, loved the ambience I think that’s the winner :)
And the rest is just a matter of ordering the right dishes. Perhaps ours not the most recommended ones"
Delicious Italian Food,Great Italian restaurant and food. Friendly staff (albeit a little lax in the actual serving) and a very intimate setting. Food isn't cheap but is reasonable for Singapore for restaurants of a similar standing.
Just like family,"No Menu was a last minute decision, recommended by a friend.

When we arrived, we were ushered upstairs by charming Mama Forlino. Our table was not ready so Mama offered the 4 of us a glass of Prosecco each to apologize. That was the start to a lovely evening.

No Menu has no menu for the degustation for the day, as Chef will cook whatever he can get that day, and probably whatever he feels like :-) but they do offer ala carte which we decided on, having been forewarned earlier that their degustation has too much food.

The waiters are well-trained by Mama and very helpful to offer recommendations. We shared the Burrata which was excellent and had the Ossobuco, pasta bolognaise and the steak. Delicious & authentic food! The wine selection is pretty good too.

The upstairs is a bit crowded when full, but the waiters were very attentive. Good ambiance. Will definitely return the next time we’re in Singapore."
decent,decent italian food. serving was on par. 2nd time here. we opted for the no menu courses just for the experience. the fish was under seasoned to me. the risotto was a creamy but slight hard. the mixed started plate and dessert was perfect. i would think the cheese was too much for me.
What a Joke,"This restaurant is an insult to Italy
We ordered a risotto and another main course.
The risotto arrived after less than 5 minutes and same for the other. It doesn’t take 5 min to prepare a risotto !
It was just impossible to eat.
I called the chief and he proposed me to bring me another main course. It was better but not good.
It’s so easy to find good Italian restaurant in Singapore. Don’t go at “no menu”
And it’s very expensive for bad food"
Good food but a bit pricey,"We visited No Menu smack in the middle of the trendy Telok Ayer Food and wine district . Distinctly Italian , the food , wine where all pretty authentic. Service is very good. We had the squid Ink pasta ( very good) , a few other dishes and the beef shank ( so la la ) .. the wine was a great Merlot from Italy priced at S$95 which I thought was on the high side . Be prepared to spent S$100 per head wine inclusive .."
One of the best in SG,"We've been coming here since they opened the restaurant at the turn of the decade. It's a family run restaurant, which is great. What's better is that Osvaldo Forlino himself is a Michelin star chef, and their service has always been impeccable.

The Burrata cheese, and Parma ham has been a must on each visit. It's *the* best buratta we have tasted, period.

Other favorites include the wild boar pasta, and the lobster. Some of their specials such as the kurobuta pork chop are also must tries. They also have a good selection of wine for those who enjoy the vice."
No Menu,We have been here on multiple occasions and the quality is consistent. We always leave ourselves at the hands of the chef and we have never been disappointed with the meal. My daughter liked it enough to host a dinner here on her 16th birthday.
Amazing food,"I went there for my birthday dinner and the staff was very nice. When we came the table was not ready so they seated us at a waiting table and served us some prosecco and some bread with olive oil and it was delicious, the main course was delicious and because it was my birthday, they got an organ and started playing some music and they started singing for me. Highly recommended."
Dinner,Had the tasting of all food introduced by the restaurant. Meaning not from the menu. Everything was good. Had a small scared when the glass broke when the waiter was refilling our glasses. The bottle had probably slipped out of his hand. The staffs were quick to clear everything up and changed our table cloth and chairs. The owner of the restaurant was apologetic and offered us a kind gesture in return. Their food and services were great. Do try it out. Good to make a reservation before going although they have 2 floors of dining area.
Amazing Italian,This is quite a cozy and classy restaurant which gives you a sense of authentic Italy. Great to entertain business guests as it’s in CBD. Food is of course yummy.
First class,"We let the host select the courses except the main - ribeye steak All courses excellent, the Barata was top notch The wines were also very good Not cheap but quality food and service"
Thanks for the Birthday,"Premise - cosy and welcoming.
Staff - friendly, attentive and welcoming.
Food - home made bread is like WOW. Buffalo mozzarella is like WOWOWOWOW.
Price - not outrageous.
Verdict - good for couples and also for business talks.

Giveaway - they will play some kind of musical device on your birthday. Which is nicely embarrassing but yet adorable."
The No Menu menu rocks,"Cozy and unpretentious, No Menu serves authentic Italian food just the way Mama would make it. We had the four-course No Menu menu for my birthday and a divine bottle of Amarone. I need to come more often."
Great family run restaurant,The Forlinos family have established a unique italian restaurant in the heart of Singapore serving home cooked italian food from mamas kitchen. Very authentic with that italian class. Defiantly worth a visit with friends for a great meal.
"Great food, mediocre service","I love the atmosphere of this restaurant. Never been upstairs, downstairs the mix of interiors makes it for me. The food is great. The olive oil is to die for. Very authentic, but I am not Italian to judge. Once you have been a couple of times, I found the surprise “no menu” not as surprising anymore. No matter what: Every bite was delicious. The wine list is extensive and covers several Italian wine regions.
But what’s going on with the service? A lot of people running around in this rather small place but nobody is really attentive or makes you feel welcome and taken care off. The lady servicing our table last night, rattled down this list of specials in a way that we did not understand much of it. We asked her to slow down without much success. On purpose we asked one of the Italian hosts and got a bit of an eye roll and a repetition of the specials. We gave up and took the surprise menu. For a high end restaurant as this one, the service needs to step up. Otherwise people leave disappointed no matter how wonderful the kitchen is."
"Good Food, Good Ambience","Went to the restaurant as a party of 3 - street parking is a little limited, may have to park at nearby buildings. The restaurant is located in a shophouse - thought the restaurant was small, until we found that there was a 2nd floor.

The restaurant is family owned - Chef is Osvaldo Forlino - had heard about this place, but never actually got around to trying it. We were greeted at the door by one of the Forlino family members (I presume the Daughter of the Chef), and overall, we felt welcome. Decor is simple but tastefully done. The place had a large expat crowd.

We were served by Christian, who seemed to be very cheerful and attentive. They served us a complimentary appetiser of bread and olive oil and sun dried tomatoes - which was very good - so much so that two members of our party bought some olive oil to take away.

We ordered a bottle of wine, appetisers of Burata, Parma ham and clams with white wine. What was a nice touch, was that they knew that we were sharing the appetisers, and actually gave us each a nicely plated portion of the burata and Parma ham - this is the first time I have seen this being done in a restaurant. The burata was divine, although the clams were okay, nothing special.

Our main courses of Lamb Shank and Ribeye - really falling off the bone for the Lamb Shank; and the Ribeye was done just right.

As we were so full, we just shared the Tiramisu between the 3 of us - it is one of the best I have tasted - just the right amount of liquor to give it a kick.

Would I recommend this place and return again - a definite YES! Although - depending on your Budget - this may be one of those restaurants that you may want to leave for special occasions or go occasionally, as the prices are a little high. But it was indeed worth it."
Very authentic,"We went here to celebrate my Birthday. There were 12 of us, all ages. Everyone enjoyed their food. We had various fresh pasta dishes and fish. The tomatoes were from Sicily, the Parma ham from Parma and not to forget the delicious burrata cheese from Italy. They obviously take great pride in their food. The service was good. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. The chocolate tart for dessert was divine. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who appreciates good Italian food."
Nice Ambience,"The ambience is good, very exquisite design. Food was okay but kinda pricey. Variety wasn't fantastic thou."
Great place to get your Italian fix,"We recently moved to Singapore, but I traveled through the region often which mostly consisted of me eating in the area of my hotel. After moving here and meeting a few local residents they highly recommend this place as a fun night out with good food and good selection of reasonably price wines. We decided to share plates between the 5 of us. Most of the dishes we very good there were a few misses, but nothing to fuss over. A lovely evening out in restaurant that feels like it belongs in a small and friendly neighbourhood."
"Nice concept, friendly staff","Had a dinner get together with friends from overseas. They were the ones who suggested the venue. Encountered for the first time how the ""no menu"" concept works.
Basically you leave it to them to provide a full course dinner. Each course is like a ""surprise""as you have no inclination what it will be. I quite like this concept actually.
Staff were extremely friendly and helpful when it came to explaining each course as it was served. Will be back..."
More than friendly restaurant,"We were clueless in searching for another restaurant nearby as our booked restaurant was having a private function. After booking No Menu, we went there and it was also fully packed. We were given free complimentary wine and snack at the table top chair before we come secured the table. Everything went well and food was pleasantly good. Nice to go place for dinner and will be left alone to dine but with many helpful advices from Christian.

Hope you enjoy it too if you are visiting this friendly restaurant"
Son’s Splendid Birthday Dinner,Definitely a very cozy restaurant. Food was superb! The Burrata was “to die for”! My teens ordered the beef and really enjoyed them.
Fantastic!! 👍🏽👍🏽,"Simply fantastic!! Great choices and great taste, everything so fresh. I loved it. Every dish look so appetizing. Will surely go back again. Seems like a family run restaurant, great operation and service."
Food is ok. Service is odd.,"Service staff were rude at first. She insisted we should take water when we repeated 3x that it was not necessary. Sister asked for a menu and was told not until she stopped playing with her phone. Find it very odd, bordering on rude. Though later on, during the meal, the service was ok.

Food was ok but not amazing. Price was acceptable for lunch set but whole table had to choose set of the same pricing, no idea why since the only difference is the choice of main courses. So same, odd rules that do not add to the experience."
WOW this is Italien Food,"The Team is Amazing, Friendly and Warm, The food is absolutely delicious, the wine List is very well balanced with lots of quality and the prices are totally ok... BRAVO it can't get any better then this!!!"
"Great Atmosphere, Great Food","This is genuine Italian cooking and a family run restaurant. The food is always very fresh, the service is excellent and you don't even have to order they will serve you dinner without even looking at the menu. You may need to book in advance."
First Timer !,"Was asking around for Italian places to bring my friend for her birthday dinner and was recommended to No Menu.
Tucked in the busy street of Boon Tat the ambience when I first arrived at reminds me of the restaurants that I visited in Florence.
We both ordered a pasta and dessert each. My gnocchi was one of the best that I had in Sg. Took some pics but my poor skills did not do justice to the lovey ambience that we were soaked in while there"
A superb family run authentic Italien restaurant in the heart of the city.,A great family run business situated in an old shop house ni ely decorated. The service is authentic and the family nearly always present. Great food explanation and presentaion
Delightful Experience,"Had the absolute pleasure of dining at “No Menu” last evening. The ambience, the service and the food were just outstanding. All ingredients were so fresh. We went for the Chefs Specials of the day. You could tell this was a restaurant and kitchen run by a family who made it their only mission to serve up the very best. Every dish was prepared with passion and from the heart. The spicy salami spread was unique and the burrata was so rich and creamy. One of my favorite Italian meals ever. A special mention to our hostess, Ms. Illy, who took such good care of us. Her attention to detail and knowledge of the ingredients was evident. And her suggestion of a Sauvignon Blanc from Northern Italy was a perfect compliment to the meal. A restaurant highly recommended if you’re looking for a quiet cozy dinner or a business dinner or just a great evening. Great food and vibe guaranteed. Thanks to all the staff for a super evening."
Absolutely awesome,Very authentic and just beautiful! They have the most amazing food! Don’t ourselves a favour and eat here you won’t be disappointed!
Best of the best,By far the best Italian restaurant in Singapore 5 starts everything about this place is fantastic food staff ambiance
Never disappoints,"Several visits to this restaurant. Service always excellent - including all the little things such as friendly and authentic staff, menu suggestions, and keeping covers on meals of two of our party who were outside taking a call when mains arrived. Certainly not cheap but worth it and the most authentic Italian food and atmosphere you’ll find in Singapore."
Expensive but worth,"Friendly staff and service. A wide menu even if the name suggest otherwise. We had appetizers that we share between the four of us and the main courses were big enough. Twoo of us ate black rice with squid wich were faboulous, the best ones we have had for a long time. We had a Sauvignon blanc from Mutti in Italy wich was great."
Stick to Appetizers and Desserts,"We have been here a couple of times - the service is delightful, the interior is cozy, and the wine list is fantastic. However, after enjoying phenomenal appetizers, we are always somewhat disappointed in the main courses - which seem to fall short of there meal predecessors. Highly recommend the burrata cheese - incredibly generous portion, with perfectly salted roma tomatoes and lightly dressed greens. The fried scallops are a must-try as well. And their complimentary focaccia has a perfectly crusty, dimply exterior. Feast on the appetizers and then opt for the lemon tart for dessert."
"Overpriced, Poor Service","Venue was suggested by my sis and I did not do research before going to the restaurant and regretted not doing so early as the bad reviews here are exactly what I went thru.

My sis & family arrived before me and they were offered Still water. And when I sat down immediately the waiter filled my glass with Still water which I nicely informed him I would prefer warm water. He doesn't look please but came back with my cup of warm water. My other sis & family arrived after me and I ordered another 2 cups of warm water for my BIL & my niece as they can't take cold water, the waiter rudely told me that would be $2 for warm water. Not sure if it is $2 per pax or $2 per cup. I noted that they were so efficient in topping up your water. At the end we were charged 5 bottles of Still water@$12 each so total bill for water alone was $60. We don't remember drinking so many bottles, in our impression at the most was 3 bottles but I guessed they just added the cost of warm water to the bill as well.

We decided on our order but waiter insisted that the order was not enough and because of the pushy waiter, we ended up changing some of our orders (which she said was too heavy) and replacing with appetiser, Burrata that costs $75 which we did not intend to order in the first place.

So guys, better decide what you want to eat and stick to it and not let them confused you and upsell.

In my opinion, with the kind of price that one paid, you can definitely get better food, better service elsewhere."
Jenny Duff,"My husband and I had a delicious lunch at this restaurant last week.
We had a set three course menu.
The staff were very attentive and friendly.
We met the chef and enjoyed our conversation.
The decor was very comfortable and tasteful.
I would suggest to visit this restaurant for a great Italian experience."
Very Good Food,"This place offers very good food on a simple menu, but with loads of daily specials. This is a bit disconcerting trying to remember what our talented server rattled off, and repeated on request. The service is amazing and the ambience is fabulous."
"Good food, nice service","Contrary to name, there is a menu. They also have some omakase as well as ""specials"" not on menu. As with most places this goes by trust if you are too proud or careless to check prices before hand. In my case I took a chance with the main (appetiser was off menu) and both price and quality were high so I didn't feel cheated. Perhaps I should say the quality was high enough to justify price.

Had the lemon sole fish and Parma with fruits for starters. The ham is good to compare because almost every Italian fine dining restaurant carries it. Wasn't disappointed at all to my memory one of the best. The ham is soft and melts easily in the mouth. The fish was decent size portion and taste was decent too. This is surely no Vietnam cat fish served up as Dory or sole, this was real good stuff supposedly from France.

Attentive service with repeated offers of bread, cheese and other freebies, friendly and nice owner/ managers who are from Piedmont region adds to the good feel. They do serve plain water unlike some high class ones (and increasingly many low class ones too. Thanks for that!

Taking of Piemonte had a couple of glasses of their Barbera d'Asti a favourite of mine which was excellent!

Total cost was less than $150 which is in ball park of what you'd spend at Etna, Garibaldi, Grissini etc. So no complaints on that front. No desserts for me.

Despite the crowds and the bookings they don't rush you. Another big plus.

On the minus side:

Bit crowded and full which feels even more so because of small space. Thankfully I didn't have to queue up. People keep coming and going like in fast food joint. So not a place for quiet romantic dinner with your date IMHO. As such is not a bar where you can spend a long evening sipping your wine, contemplating life, even if you can afford the price.

Overall you wouldn't be disappointed and I wasn't. Will surely go back."
Feeling ripped off,"When we walked into the restaurant the waiter explained that the no menu concept included a cold starter, a hot starter, pasta, main course and dessert. The cost of this was Sing dollars 118 per person. I asked for this to be repeated twice and then my husband and I decided it was too much food. Then we were given an a la carte menu. Whilst we were looking at that a lady came and reeled off a bunch of specials. We decided to share a cold starter and a hot starter. My husband then wanted pasta but could not decide between the pork, cheese or prawn pasta. The chef came to our table and when we explained he made us understand that he would do a plate with small portions of three pasta’s to share (we thought it was the three pastas he wanted). What we got was a penne arabbiata, risotto with truffle and a spinach and ricotta tortellini ( all vegetarian). We then shared a Tiramisu. When we got the bill they had charged us for two no menu meals. We shared starters, had vegetarian pasta, no main meal and shared a dessert.
When we pointed this out we were told that they could price it up individually but it would cost more. We then realized the mistake we had made. We were never told the price of the specials and the pasta was a suggestion by the Chef so they could in fact have charged us whatever they wanted. We decided to pay our 300 dollar-plus bill and leave.
My advice would be to anyone going to this restaurant is to make sure you know what the price is of every single dish you order.

The food was ok. More hearty and wholesome and very generous portions.
The ambience was warm and cosy. If not for this experience it would have been a restaurant we would possibly have returned to.

This is the first restaurant in Singapore where I left feeling that I had been ripped off."
Overpriced and poor quality,"It is a very rare case when I would be not happy about the restaurant experience, because I prefer to go to places recommended by people opinion I trust.

My husband took me for lunch to this place. The menu was expensive: appetizers S$26-44++, fish S$58++, half lobster S$98++. Waiter announced couple of special options of the day, amoung which was asparagus meal. I asked if asparagus meal was an appertizer and the waiter replied ""Yes, it is an appetizer, but we can make a bigger portion to make it a main course"", As I am gluten free and low carb eater, I ordered that asparagus as a main course.
Portions arrived small, especially small was mine: 2 sticks of asparagus and 1 poached egg. Waiter came and shredded generously black truffle on top. I tried truffle - it was not edible: no smell, very dry, seemed like they utilised expired truffle. My meal was definitely an appetizer, There was no salt in egg at all, I asked waiter for salt and she gave me a bowl of course salt (are they so greedy to purchase mills?). Overall taste was ok, nothing special to come back.
As a result, the lunch break was over, I left the restaurant hungry, had no interest in ordering even coffee there.
We paid S$111 for 1 seafood risotto, 1 asparagus appetizer, 1 bottle of still water. There were bread+mortadella+oil appetizer on a side.

Conclusion: homestyle cooked ordinary groceries for fine dining price"
Best Italian Meal in a long time,"I went to No Menu last week with my business partners. Perhaps one of the best Italian meals I have ever had. It was so good, that we went back again the next day. Incredible selection of wine, buratta to die for, and the Sicilian tomatoes are unreal, I can just eat a plate of that. The restaurant is run by a Italian family, father is the chef, mom runs the register, and the daughters keep the main dining room going. This is one of the best Italian food anywhere, period!"
"Great food, great atmosphere",Walked in late for a reservation. Were seated immediately. Good selection of food. My companions loved the wine. A family restaurant that treats customers like family.
"Delicious Food, Great Ambiance",Went here for the first time a few days ago. Was so happy with the food and service. I will definitely be back again very soon. Will now be my go to Italian in Singapore!
Best Italian restaurant in town,"Located on Boon Tat - a small street in the CBD but served great and delicious Italian dishes. We especially loved the dessert!!! I would say it was the best Italian restaurant in town, at least to us!"
Consistently Brilliant!,Come here often for dinner on business and sometimes with my better half. Always a great atmosphere in the restaurant with super helpful staff. The food is outstanding; fresh and authentic with no pretense. The fiorentina t-bone is immense with a good wine list to match. Lots of little courtesy dishes from the house just add to the charm of the place!
Rip-off...,"Ice cream? 18SGD
A bottle of water? 12SGD
Fish fillet? 58SGD
NZ Clams Sauté? 36 SGD

Anything off menu is also super pricey.

Good food and good service but prices are not in line with the market.

There are many other restaurants in Singapore that are much cheaper and offer better value.

Certainly not a place I would suggest."
Decent dinner with family restaurant atmosphere,"The place was nice and service was also great. Food were well prepared with great generousity. I would say it turned to be a bit too commercial rather than small cozy place but with such a good service, you can still feel a little bit of family run biz here."
everyone was happy except me...,"My husband has been to no menu several times and he enjoyed it so we made a booking with friends. Everyone’s food was good (not amazing, just good) apart from mine which was tasteless. I had garlic and chili spaghetti and the garlic cloves weren’t really cooked and so it was like eating raw garlic, the large dried chilies used didn’t really add any flavor to the dish.
This is one of the dishes I always order the first time I try a new Italian restaurant as it’s such an easy one to make but also one that often is messed up... on this occasion that’s what happened. If I ate this spaghetti dish without knowing what it was supposed to be I wouldn’t have any idea. No menu - I won’t be back."
Wonderful Food & Service,"When a business associate told me that we had reservations at a restaurant named No Menu, I was a bit skeptical, but once I arrived and was greeted by the owner and shown to our table - I was hooked. Food was delicious, generous portions, and the wine list was exceptional."
Authentic Italian,"Superb food, atmosphere different from most Italian restaurants, a feeling of Italy.
We took the specials on recommendation and was told to share the dishes. Good advice. The kurobuta pork dish would have been too much for 1 person. Service was good and they were very nice to hold our table even though they called and received no answer from us."
No Menu Restaurant - Genuine Taste of Italy,"There a good number of Italian Restaurants in Singapore, but it's not easy to find a good one. My husband took me out for dinner at No Menu last Saturday and we were greeted warmly by Gaia who guided us through the menu, the food was excellent and I wished I had room for all the food she recommended. I highly recommend the Pasta with Sea Urchin (it made my mouth water just writing the name of the dish); the taste was delectable and mind blowing.
The atmosphere & value was excellent compared to the other restaurants and I give my personal high rating for this restaurant and will certainly return with an emptier stomach next time (^_^)"
I went home with a food baby!,"As the name suggests you have the option to put your faith in the chef and enjoy what he serves on the day as oppose to choosing from a menu. My friend and I are a little fussy and clearly not very adventurous so we choose dishes from the specials menu.
The food was absolutely delicious and plentiful. In fact, we ended up sharing our starters and mains because the choice was simply too much and both of us were worried about food envy.

As for the service - our waiter JR, was superb. Friendly, knowledgeable and happy to ensure we didn't order to much food. Thank God for him because even with his guidance we still went home with a food baby each. And a doggy bag as we couldn't finish all the food."
Superb and authentic Italian food,This restaurant is should be on your bucket list when in a Singapore. Fresh ingredients flown in from Italy daily. Wine selection is vast and comprehensive. Service is five star. Menu items are exceptional Reservations highly recommended. Bon appétit!
Great Italian,"So I agree with the general view that the burrata is amazing, it really was. Service was also strong, staff are knowledgeable and hover nearby without imposing.

This felt like a classic restaurant, no intent to go with trends, just provide a menu of the classics alongside some great Italian wine.

If I'm correct I think they do a superb job. Stop by, but be hungry and don't plan for physical activity anytime afterwards."
Best burrata in town ... by far,"Cozy atmosphere and friendly service, rest assured you will find the best burrata in town ... Pasta is not to be missed either. We loved the welcoming and yet extremely professional service"
A wonderful Night,"It was on my birthday - 7th of February. Probably the best restaurant experience ever. The food and wine excellent, the service incredible - the owner and family made this the event for life. Every lover of Italian food should visit this wonderful place."
Amazing Italian Food,Authentic Italian food with a homely feel. The staffs make you feel welcome and the food is amazing. We went with the No Menu Option which was something like an Omakase. The dishes were fantastic and balanced throughout. The only downside was it was quite pricey so go only when its a special occasion.
Proper Homestyle Italian with Treasured Hard-to-Find Fresh Ingredients,"No Menu is a rarity in Asia: proper Italian ingredients with an Italian chef and family to cook, serve and most importantly, welcome. One could tell immediately that the Roma tomatoes were not the pale soggy Asian-grown tomato substitutes used in most of Asia's so-called Italian restaurants. These tasted like tomatoes and like Italy. The burrata was heavenly, likewise the prosciutto. We sampled the cannelloni, the insalata mista, and my perennial favourite, linguine vongole, a dish usually mis-managed in most Asian restaurants. No Menu's proper execution included the white clam sauce derived from the simple act of heating the unopened clams in a savoury garlic, white wine and parsley broth. No inundations of tinned clam sauce or lashings of, heaven forbid, cream as an ill thought rendering of ""white"" sauce. The bread at the table was always topped up throughout the meal, and was brilliant - the few leftovers there were came home with me and the bread and burrata was gorgeous next day. The only drawback is the noise level in the restaurant - being popular, it was full and being in Asia, was noisy. Nothing to do about that - the food more than compensates."
5 stars - book now !,"Celebrated a special occasion , and the team made this a very unique one . Food is fantastic and authentic, made and served by the family - returning again and again and love it"
"A mixed experience...A place for a special occasion, not for a simple pasta meal","Located in a shop house this Italian restaurant provides expensive Italian food. The waiter was very determined to up sell ( we wanted a simple pasta meal) and it required some determination to resist his suggestions. We had brought a bottle of wine as Trip Advisor reviews has indicated no corkage. The waiter demanded $50 as corkage for our wine. We reverted to the menu where the cheapest single bottle of wine cost much more than the meal. The food was very good and apart from the upselling the service was excellent. Complementary extras of small plates of cheese and sweets after the meal were very welcome.
A nasty surprise with the bill. We were actually charged for 2 bottles of wine, rapidly and courteously corrected.
A place for a special occasion not for three friends wanting a casual meal of a glass of wine and a plate of pasta. Not rushing back."
Best Italian Home Cooked,Just simple professionals who love to feed :) Been there more than 3 times in a week. It says it all.
Wonderful Italian Restaurant,"This was my second visit and I love everything about this restaurant. The food is authentic and delicious, the service is wonderful. You are warmly greeted when you arrive and nothing is too much trouble for the staff. It feels like an authentic Italian family restaurant."
Nice setting but truly mediocre food,"Paying a premium for a good meal, in a nice restaurant, on a big night out with friends is to be expected in Singapore, we're used to it. However, when you're spending in the range of SGD 250 per head, you expect things to come close to great and sadly, No Menu does not come anywhere near.

3 starters, 4 main courses, 2 bottles of wine and only 1 starter, 1 main course and 1 bottle of wine hit the mark.

A rushed service team (we had to ask them to slow down), bland clams, chewy prawns, horribly presented tortellini, an almost sweet and sour sauce accompanying the gnocchi and $300+ bottle of wine that we discussed was not what we were looking for at all, so overall, No Menu was a complete let down.

The burrata is excellent, we all agreed on that, we like the setting but the kitchen need to do A LOT better to justify these kinds of prices in Singapore where there are MANY better Italian restaurants to choose from."
Buono!,"Cosy family run restaurant that serves whatever the chef has prepared for the day. One cannot go wrong with the recommendations and the dining atmosphere make you think that you are in Italy, if not for the subtle Singapore elements that the owners make it a point to incorporate."
Singapore’s finest Italian,"Simply the best. Pricey but you know what you’re paying for when you see and taste the dishes. Every plate leaving the kitchen is perfect.
Home style cooking with a touch of extravaganza, honest and authentic dishes. This is run as a family business in an old shophouse, atmosphere is warm and friendly and unpretentious."
Outstanding Italian food in Singapore,"If you like splendid food, in Singapore, then you
Should go to Boon Tat Street, to a place called ""No Menu"".
Though its in Singapore, the food is Italian,
Which is so good it deserves a big gold medallion!

Its a family affair, a sign always quite good,
The girls run the tables, while Papa cooks the food.
The fare is superb in this great ristorante,
And it can be washed down with a lovely Chianti.

They do have a menu, but if you are wise,
You should ask for ""no menu"" and get a surprise -
Four courses resplendent with tastes in each dish,
The only choice is whether you prefer meat or fish.

The Hawkers are cheaper, as is Satay Street,
But this is a special place where you can eat,
So the next time you feel like an outstanding venue,
You should book a wee table down at ""No Menu""."
