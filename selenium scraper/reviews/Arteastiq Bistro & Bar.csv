I wad denied water twice by the waiter,"The waiter who served us, denied us water twice.
I was asking if we can have water. His reply was just ‚Äúwe do not serve water‚Äù period.
We can pay for water, but he did not say anything. So we were confused, no still or sparkling water in the entire restaurant?
He only mentioned, your whisky chocolate will come with water. Which was only a small glass.

I asked the second time if i can have more water, he replied again ‚Äúwe do not serve water‚Äù period.
I asked ‚Äúthen where did this small glass of water come from‚Äù he only smiled and said once again we do not serve water.

To us this was preposterous."
Superb Experience!,"Lovely place with a classy ambience, delicious food that fills our belly leaving you very happy and world class service! Special thanks to Suet Lee who has provided unparalleled service of the highest standard and never fails to make my day! A must try place that will not disappoint!"
1st visit,Food portion is just right and quality is good. They have wide varieties of tea to choose and pot of tea is generous. Cost is reasonable and a good place to catch up with friends.
Do not recommend.,Food was soso only for the price paid. Oyster wasnt fresh and cold when served. There is worm in the fresh oyster. They compensate with another baked oyster.
Nice ambience,"Nice ambience and nice food. I have requested to have a cosy corner and true enough, I was given a cosy corner. I had a great catch-up with my friend. I will go again !"
A happy experience,Food was good. I loved the truffle pasta. Service was excellent. The indochine decor was top notch. Will definitely come back!
Good high tea,A quiet and cozy place to enjoy high tea with my best friend! The staff provide good service and the food is good!
Locals high tea set,service of the restaurant is very good my friend n I very happy with the atmosphere and value of the meal the food taste is good too just disappointed the satay items a bit cold n the rice cube too hard
Liscious Seafood Afternoon TeaSet NOT recommended,"Read the highly raved reviews therefore made a reservation to celebrate my friend's birthday. The grilled lobster was stale and the kitchen offer to replace with a new one. Didn't want to risk having another stale experience so we opted for baked oyster instead. The service was below average - trainee staff unfriendly and no apologies from manager or trained staff to handle our food complaints. Had requested for a birthday dessert via online booking, it was overlooked. And waitress offered to light a candle with the tea set pastries. Total damage for 2pax is $150.65 incl gst & svc charge. Ambience is nice but do look elsewhere for an enjoyable experience."
The food was great,"The restaurant was clean,the veiw is nice and the food was very nice and the service also good. We were seating at the window side. But every seat looks great also."
Nice place but service is poor,"Arteastiq has a flare for its presentation and a cute cozy ambience. Some dishes actually taste good such as the Lobster pasta and Squid ink pasta. They have nice lychee tea, but don't expect a matching biscotti. The strawberry shortcake looks beautiful but the cake is too heavy in texture. Their meats, steak and lamb are not fulfilling and not recommended. The salmon isn't worth it. Yet, the worst of Arteastiq is in its service. You are greeted with no smile and permitted entry should you agree to leave within 1 hour (sometimes 45 minutes). My humble advise: Go to Arteastiq when you are in a pleasant mood, be mentally prepared for meagre service and make a beeline for the more recommendable items."
Comfortable place,"Really appreciated from staff name Suet Lee with friendly services, we enjoying delicious Foods in the night dinner."
"Food is good,service need to be improved","The food creativity,quality,portion and taste are superb. But the service staffs do not understand diners do not go there to fill up our stomach only,it is a holistic dinning experience from food,service and atmosphere. The service crews are task orientated but not service orientated,which can be replaced by AI in future. The few tables near the counter where behind is the kitchen is very noisy,no different from dine in coffee shop. If customers just want pcs of cakes and coffee,there are plenty of nice cafe in Singapore to enjoy the holistic experience that you want to visit them again and again. But Arteastiq is certainly not the one. The staff is helpful but very impatient,and also lack ot knowledge to use the new apps but obviously she does not aware of it,which more traning is required."
Food and service sure very bad,"Why I need to spend 10% fee for service? Food bad especially service. Will do my resource and time to provide my bad experience and rating to Google, Facebook and any platform."
Nice Place But Staff Need To Be Trained,"1)The seat was stained.
2)No one ever picked up the phone, I have called during weekdays, weekends, 10am, 11am, 12pm, 2pm, 3pm, 5pm, 8pm, 9pm and 10pm. Never once answered.
3) You should send your whole team of service staff for training. We dont feel welcomed. The waiter asked me to clear the last 2 portion on the tray while I just placed a piece of food into my mouth. A waitress just blocked my friend's path while we were exiting, the waitress waited for my friend to move to the other side instead of her and No, it's not that the waitress is holding any cup or tray. It's a shame that service is not even up to a basic standard level."
"Great food, atmosphere and server","We were served by Suat Lee, who wowed me with her great personality and service. Our great experience is further enhanced by her wonderful service. Great job Suat!"
Disappointing COLD Chinese manager and being customer-selective,"I and my bf went here for a tea. The place was completely empty when we arrived and has asked for the sofa seat. We were declined and told that ‚Äúit was reserved‚Äù.

For a weekday and an unusual hour of 3pm to 6pm I doubt that‚Äôs the case. And clearly enough, the sofas were left empty even after several hours that we stayed there.

One sofa seat was I believe was selectively given to another couple who were dressed better than us. We were dressed very casually.

The cherry on top was I‚Äôve signaled the Chinese (quite plump) manager for an assistance and she TOTALLY ignored me, and look over her waitress as if hinting that I should be calling her instead. She stayed in this demeanour all throughout.

Mind you that she was literally just standing and looking over the almost bare dining area.

EVERY guest should be treated equally and fairly regardless. It‚Äôs a shame that the manager itself is a major let down this place."
Inconsistent standard of food,This is my 2nd visit but disappointed to know that the standard of food has dropped. The canelle came without the chocolate wings. The macaron jelly layer was reduced to half the size that I had 1/2 year ago! I only enjoyed the pot of lychee tea and the caviar with pineapple sorbet.
Dayummm,"Fr this is my favorite restaurant ever man like i rly like the duck confit, lychee and pear tea! I'll definitely go again"
Service was bad,"Saw many empty tables but was told to scan the QR code and wait. Then my number was cancelled because I have the same name with the lady in front of me. Crew, woman in black outfit service was bad, she was chit chatting and didn't seems to take her job seriously. And best the table wasn't clean properly and my white shirt was stained. Terrible and disappointed."
Great dining experience!,The place itself was really gorgeous.. the staffs were very polite and charming. Food was excellent specially their steak! Would go back in a heartbeat.
Great to hang out here,It was a wonderful afternoon spent with my gal. We had ordered the lychee cold tea along with the hi tea set. Food comes in quality and quantity.
Value for money.,The food tasted interesting good for most and the high tea set is value for money for 2pax. Service staff wasn‚Äôt friendly or approachable at MG outlet compare to PS outlet. The rest was good!
High Tea,"The food is not very fresh (scallop) and over cook (Lobster). Was good to be arranged seated by the window, however, in front of the counter, not that nice!!"
Poor customer service with mediocre food,"Honestly this was one of the most aesthetically pleasing high teas we have been to but the tastes of the food does not live up to its looks. Tables are way too small to fit 3 pax or more.

Service was terrible, even from the managers. Unfriendly and I accommodating that soured our experience.

The only saving grace was the beautiful ambience of Jewel."
This is not my first time...,I love the sarvice here. They're so sweet.. I always come back Even walk in time is just last order they still sweet welcome ü•∞
"Great food, Great ambience","The food is really flavoursome and pleasing to the eyes. This was my second visit, and I will definitely come back soon."
Must try üëçüëçüëç,Must order the teas! Must enjoy the ambiance! Must experience the good food and just overall good unique experience‚Ä¶
Hidden gem in Orchard Road,"While they are known for their signature afternoon tea offerings, we opted to try their dinner fare. We ordered the Lobster laksa, Ozzie bolognese and ribeye, which were all great. Plating was exquisite, portions were generous (considering the price point), and the flavours were spot on. Restaurant ambiance and vibes (dim and cozy) were also a plus, in addition to very amiable staff. Best to come here when it‚Äôs not crowded and packed."
Great place to gather and chill,"Enjoyed the Asian delights fusion menu, ambience and service. Took a notch off service as they only serve bottled water (environmentally unfriendly) rather than tap water"
Great food and ambience,Great menu with a good variety. Food was delicious and beautifully presented. Staff was friendly and helpful but the waiting time for food was a little too long even after 2 reminders.
Interesting menu,I love the menu as it cater to people who enjoys fusion cuisine. The savoury tea set was delicious and different from the others as it focuses on fave local flavours. The local take on popular dishes like salted egg spaghetti was excellent. There‚Äôs a wide variety choices of dishes for different preferences.
Delightful decor and dessert,"Not often I give five stars. I save five for a place which serves unusual food and introduces me to a new taste. Variety in the decor - the dining chairs, and the menu.
Sharing plates bought the prices down to a reasonable level and added to the fun. They brought up two plates, both different in colour and pattern."
Disappointing,Food is aesthetically appealing but average at best. Escargot starter was extremely salty. Service was completely indifferent for what otherwise looks like a nicely decorated cafe. Disappointing.
MADE TO WAIT AND MADE TO LEAVE,"Terrible customer service

I had a reservation at Arteastiq Jewel a week ago. When I reached about 5mins before booking time, I approached the server. She insisted that there was no reservation without even checking. I showed her my email booking confirmation. So she went in and checked. She did not get back to me after 5 mins despite me being there. I went to her again and asked about it. She informed me that there were 2 tables going to be available as customers are finishing eating. She informed me that she will give me a call once the table is made available. I didn't leave and hung around as I understood how busy she is and didn't want to inconvenient her.

When the table was available, she offered the seats to a group of guys who were in the queue. I was disappointed but kept my calm. I went to her again and she said she will give me another table. The boys were a group of 5 adults and so were mine.
So despite a reservation booking, we have waited for 25minutes!! Still no seats given. I went to another server called Isaac to enquire. After 5 mins, she gestured to us rudely to another table. We sat down and quickly ordered. After 20mins wait, we were approached by another server called Isaac. He told us that we have violated the rules as we were 5 adults and 1 child. He did not offer an extra table but suggested one of us to take the child for a walk?!!
I asked why wasn't we told earlier when we were seated? He replied he just realised it. No apology was offered on his part at all too. He indirectly told us to leave. That was the end of my patience threshold and we left Arteastiq with a sour taste in our mouth and burning hearts. Arteastiq, I hope that you can treat all your customers fairly and with respect."
Decent high tea,"Ordered the traditional high tea set

(+) Decent quality and flavour although I have to say their teas were the highlight! We ordered the chocolate tea and lychee tea.

(+) Great ambience for meetings or dates with friends.

(-) Price tag for the high tea set was a little high considering the items were quite small in size."
Nice place to hang out,"My friends and I came to try out the afternoon tea set menu. The food is quite good and drinks are also good. We will definitely try the painting class next time, looks so fun"
Great food and ambience,Lychee tea was superb and was able to customise my dish for me. Great ambience and definitely a great place for both friends gathering and also couple time!
Bad service,"website indicated sms to reserve so I started sms for reservation a week ago but no response.
3 days before the visit, I called to find out if they have received and the lady who answered the phone said no sms reservation. I told her that they should removed from the website about this. No apologies and no reservations could be made.
So I walked in and was told dining was only for 2 hours.
Then when asked for baby chair, they told my friend they are kind of busy so could not do it now.
When requested to take a photo, they said come back later.
High tea set was not nice but main courses were nice.
Bill came when it was almost 2 hours.
Shortly the staff came and asked us to vacate as she really need the table.

In short, service BAD, main course food delicious and spent $144 for 3 persons."
Boston Seafood soup has bone!,"Went with my wife for dinner at this restaurant in Plaza Singapura. We ordered Truffle Carbonara, Boston Love Boat and Otah Fries. The carbonara is too wet and not creamy, could not taste the different cheese in it. The Boston seafood soup the bone was not removed from seafood and was in shock when ate the salmon."
Great Ambience,"Went for high tea as I‚Äôve heard great reviews about them, and I sure wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The high tea set was reasonably priced and the desserts were very delectable."
Lovely ambience and good food,"Had dinner with a pot of tea and a main of beef with black rice, spinach , truffles, a sous vide egg. Beef slices are soft and tender. Divine!"
Birthday dinner,We celebrated our friend‚Äôs dinner at arteastiq. The food was amazing and ambience was good. Staff were friendly too. Highly recommend!
Dinner,Lovely ambience Comfortable and clean seating Good for a quiet evening for couples and families Good selection of desserts
Amazing atmosphere and good food,"Visited arteastiq with my family, it was worth it. The lychee tea is refreshing and the pasta is flavourful and tasty. Would definitely come back again."
Good ambience and food,Nice food and ambience for 5 of us on a Saturday afternoon at plaza Singapura. We will check out other outlets again.
Lunch,"The food is great, very healthy & tasty. We tried the local flavour sambal fish & dried laksa, We also ordered the tea, soup, smoked salmon vietnamese rolls & chestnut pie for desert, all fantastic."
Great location and decor,"Love the ambience and decor. Most of all, comfortable couches and amazing selection of tea. Great for afternoon tea, relax after shopping"
Arteastiq mandarin gallery,"Chill ambience, complex flavours, insta worthy place, portion is just nice & friendly staff. A bit pricey & long waiting time. Overall it‚Äôs a pleasant experience otherwise."
Good food,"The fish dish and soba salad‚Äôs great! Good tea, ambience as well. You should try the oosmonthus tea!"
Nice food and ambience!,Food is well prepared and nice ambience for a weekend dinner with love one. Prawn fettuccine and hot osmanthus oolong definitely my favourite!
good food!,great food and ambience. portions a lil small but the flavors were on point. especially loved the prawn paste squid:)
Dinner,"My first visit. Nice food, great desserts and helpful staff. Had the slice beef with truffle sauce, beef cooked to perfection. Fish & chips is good too. Like the sauce that comes with it. Something special."
2nd visit,"Love the ambience -u would forget you are in a shopping mall for a while. Tried their cheese tofu, quite an unique experience, I like it ."
Good selection of teas. Cosy environment.,"High tea for 2 at $48++ with 2 types of tea of choice.
There‚Äôs 2 types of food - western or local style to choose from.
We had the western set. The taste is quite good but quantity can be a bit more. But I think the highlight is more on the extensive tea selection.
Quite a good place to chill out on a lazy afternoon with lots of tea to relax."
Great food n great ambience,Excellent makan for dinner in a cosy setting in the heart of town!! We like the dinner selection N the good mix for dessert n tea!!
Thankyou for a wonderful memory Arteastiq,Amazing gem hidden inside Plaza Singapura! Thankyou to the wonderful staff for making it a nice experience for both my mothers and myself. Would be a return customer when I come back to Singapore. Friendly staff and atmosphere. The rose tea and mini cheesecake was to die for! Highly recommend the signature high tea :)
Awesome food,Come taste this awesome food and great service. Located at plaza sing it is not difficult to find this place @ all
Refreshing and Innovative,Refreshing fusion bistro ! This addition to Plaza Singapore is a good lunch spot amidst shopping or in the evenings a nice date spot that doesn‚Äôt burn a hole in your pocket. Excellent tea menu and innovative food and cocktails
Great dining experience!,"First visit with great dining experience.
Full of surprises on the taste buds from infusion of osmanthus oolong tea and crayfish spags respectively. The winner is the boston love boat with bread topping the pot of fresh seafood on tomato sauce bed. Warm service too!

Review,"Interesting concept, love the ambience with the dried flower decoration! Food was awesome, taste as good as it look! 5 star!"
Good Fusion Food,The food served was tasty and delicious esp the dry laksa. Thumbs up! Worth coming again to try the tea selection.
Nice n cosy environment,A nice and cosy place to relax and enjoy tea time with friends and family. Family and friends love it too.
Yummy yummy,"Great food with equally good presentation. Wonderful array of teas. For starters, would recommend the prawn bisque, pan seared foie gras with brie, scallop bruschetta and spicy escargot. For mains, we had the truffle carbonara, marcaroni beef and beef fettuccine which were delightful. Would recommend."
"Awesome food, great ambience",Good quality food! The salmon was grilled to perfection while the beef was tender and delicious! However the wait was a little longer than expected. Would be great if they can provide us with free water.
Good place to make a good first impression,"Nice overall ambience, cozy lights, tasty tea selections especially the lychee tea (personal fav).

Setting in the restaurant is good for small gatherings; with fancy chairs and tables. Good place for Instagram post!

Don't have to call our for service, they have a bell system in place for each table; service / bill."
Not just Art + Tea,"Walking into Arteastiq is like attending Mad Hatter‚Äôs Tea Party, without the madness, just the wonderful imagination of the people behind this amazing joint. Dinner here is such a soothing experience. The tea selection is extensive and food menu is a well balanced fusion of Local and Western elements. The attention to the decor can be seen replicated on the food and drinks presentation. This place is suitable for group/ family gathering as well as a quiet date night. Highly reccomended."
Extravagant tea,"excellent pasta and a very vast variety of teas, some with ice cream on top (highly recommended). Will come back."
Cozy and delicious meal,We always look forward to our Sunday lunch together at this cozy restaurant for our meals. I love the lychee tea and fusion dishes.
Dinner at Arteastiq Bistro & Bar,Had a great dinner at Arteastiq Bistro & Bar. The ambience here is fantastic with nice music. Highly recommended.
"Good ambience, great food","Had a great experience with my girl friends for lunch. Great tea and good food, love the presentation which makes the day better"
Nice ambience and tea,The place has a nice ambience. Was not too noisy when I went for afternoon tea. The tea was delicious and the serving was generous :)
Ms,"Good ambiance, nice surrounding with friendly service. Must give their lychee tea a try...you won‚Äôt regret"
Amazing,"The set up of the area was so nice; it was warm and cozy, much like how a house would feel. Still it had a classy feel of a restaurant that makes you feel like you‚Äôre in private island cafe. The food was the best thing I ever tasted and so worth the price, I‚Äôll be sure to recommend and obviously come back!!‚ú®"
Good food but lack of experience staff,"Nice tea selection. Food is good, nice ambience, but the staff are not very attentive and does not know their restaurant well."
Lunch at arteastiq,Very good food! Great ambience. Friendly staff. Would come back again. The carbonara was very delicious with the truffle. My girlfriend had salmon which was also good
Dinner at Arteastiq,"Had truffle carbonara for dinner and it was good! Place has nice ambience as well, and would love to come back for tea in future!"
Beautiful cafe,Nice foods and lychee tea . Will be back again . Friendly staff . Definitely a ideal place for gathering
Nice dinner,"We ordered the truffle pasta and the beef fettuccine, both is great. Lychee tea is a must try as well, very refreshing. Overall nice food and ambience."
Cool place with great ambience,Restaurant deco and layout is very cosy and welcoming. Food was decent but the portion is really small.
Cosy Bisto in Singapore,"Good environment, can enjoy our weekend at this place. Food and service also good, if u wan to plan to meet up ur friend or dating, u can consider this arteastiq! Highly recommended"
Average food and below average service,"My daughter and I wanted a mother daughter afternoon tea and settled on here. We made a reservation on their sms reservation number provided on their website. Deciding to go directly to the venue, we were informed that they hadn‚Äôt checked their sms and were full. There were empty tables and at least one that looked almost done but the staff told us it could be a 30-60 minute wait. I asked about the empty tables and was informed that they were reserved for 1:30pm (we were there at 1pm) and asked if we could take one of the reserved tables since it looked like one table was leaving. The staff, again unsympathetic, said they had no idea how long the wait would be. A minute later, the people at the table left and the staff shrugged her shoulder as if nothing happened. Disappointing."
Delightful Visit,The food menu is limited but you can see that there‚Äôs a lot of thought put into the presentation and execution of the food. There is a wide variety of drinks available too. It can be pricey but the discount we had made it worth it.
For my baby's birthday!,Ordered black rice with beef n my favourite lychee tea. üòã Yummy! The rest ordered pasta n duck sandwich. Good too.
Good for girls‚Äô day out,Nice place to chill n relax. Been to both plaza Singapura and Mandarin Gallery outlets. U can even do canvas painting here.
Tuesday Lunch,Great ambiance! Great food! Definitely one of the best places I have visited if u are a tea lover. Give it a try!
Great Ambience,Amazing place.. real chill out with a touch of elegance.... great place to hang out with the gurls üëçüèªüëçüèª
Arteatstiq Bistro at Jewel Changi Airport,"This is a new outlet located in Jewel Changi. As the restaurant‚Äôs name suggests, it has a very arty decor and attractive presentation of the dishes.

We‚Äôd stopped by for coffee and dessert before watching the light show at the fountain. Both the cafe latte and crepes were very pleasing to the eyes and delicious. A good place to people watch or meet with friends."
Sumptuous dinner,"Had a great meal @arteastiq. Down to the lines, angles and hue that surrounds the food presentation, the fine taste of this simple arabiatta pasta graced by delectable crayfish is a satisfying treat both to eye and tummy."
Arteastiq is more artistic than Starbucks or Hoshino,"The favourite stop for nearby Temasek execs to meet their contacts for coffee, as it is discrete and not crowded. Their cold lychee tea is delightful. The food is pricey - probably overpriced for the quality."
Many rules,"This is one of the many restaurants in Plaza
Singapura. Food was ok but the whole place didn‚Äôt feel welcoming from the point we stepped into the restaurant.

1. First thing the server told us when we walked in was we could only stay for two hours because it was a public holiday. Never mind that the restaurant was not full.

2. After we spent some time looking through the menu and decided on the signature dishes, we were told they were sold out. That was very unexpected as we were the first customers of the day.

3. When asked for water, we were told we had to buy a 500ml bottle at $5 as they didn‚Äôt serve complimentary drinking water. However, if we ordered drinks from their drink menu, water will be complimentary.

4. We ordered a pot of their signature lychee tea to try. It was a small pot that tasted fine, but seemed a little over priced.
There were three of us but they were allowed to provide only one additional cup. They also provided only one glass of complimentary water.

5. They were not allowed by their management to top up the teapot for lychee tea. We did not bother to ask them to top up water as everything we asked for had been denied so far.

Fortunately they did not tell us we could not order two desserts for three to share. The desserts were just ok and took a long time to be served, better to adjourn to somewhere else.
There is a sense that profit is more important than service here. There are many places to eat in Singapore. I would not go back again."
Ladies Nite Out,Food was alright but service could be better. Highly recommend the truffle carbonara if pasta is ur choice.
Mothers day,Wonderful food and ambience. Food is very delicious and healthy. Lovely ambience and music. Recommend for family with kids
Lovely little cafe with a nice ambience,Pretty tea sets and a reasonably good menu. Lots of people seem to like the fish and chips. The fizzy earl grey tea is interesting and quite nice. Macaroni beef was quite average though.
Good restaurant,The environment of this restaurant is very comfortable and the food that I had is tasty and the lychee tea is refreshing. Price is affordable for everyone.
Nice place and food,"Great ambience and awesome food, will definitely come again with family and friends. The teas are refreshing!"
Great ambiance,"Great service!!! Food are nice, Cod fish and chips and Cajun Prawn Fettuccine are recommended. Great ambiance, nice place for gathering."
Brunch,Had heard about the place from friends but it was a disappointment. Place is dirty with hairs all over the corners and sofa. Not best hygienic place to bring children. Food was just about average. In fact fried chicken seemed to be fried in stale oil. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend and would definitely not come here again.
Comfortable location for high tea,Have frequent meet ups with my girlfriends and we love coming to this place for a casual catch-up. Easy ambience and lovely teas - light on the palate and wallet! Loving this place. Do try the Signature Treasury set for 2!
Awesome food and ambience!,"I really enjoyed the minute details and thoughts given to the presentation of the teas and food are quite delicious as well! Loved how the staff sang the birthday song with us as she brought the cake over for my friend!

Really nice and soothing atmosphere - best fit for a relaxation spot"
