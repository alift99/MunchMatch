Mother’s Day Buffet Dinner,"Complimenting May from The Carvery for still remembering my name after two years ! Came here for I am pleasantly surprised when she said “ oh! It has been a long time since I have met u , Xxx!” I have seldom come across staff like her . This is how you should keep the regulars ! Keep up the good work ! Food as usual are quite impressive especially given the Mother’s Day menu . Tender ribeye."
The Carvery,"My family enjoyed dining very much at The Carvery, especially the Guinness Aged Beef, Whelk, Wood-fired bread and the BBQ Chicken Pizza. The restaurant crew also paid attention to the needs of our kids and greatly appreciate chef melvin for assisting us in our food request.Thank you very much."
Satisfying meals here over 2 weekends!,"Believe you me, family and I visited this cafe consecutively over 2 weekends for the lunch buffet but it was totally different experience.

The first visit was the usual buffet styled while our second visit was ""ala cart buffet"", where we were given a menu of dishes and ordered for them instead of going around to take food. The rationale of the latter was that due to the Covid-19, the cafe was trying to reduce human contact and interactions and also due to the fact that there are now lesser diners to avoid food wastage.

Located on the 7th storey of the hotel, next to the swimming pool and bar, the cafe was simple but nice and trendy. We enjoy the view outside.

Well, in terms of the food variety and spread, surely it's not that great as it's quite limited as compared to other similar category cafes and restaurants in hotels but the food quality wise was great.

In fact, the cafe is well-known for it's meat dishes and true enough they were very nice and yummy. Among all, we loved the roast chicken most, very fragrant, juicy, tender and really nice. The beef and lamb were good too.

There were also a small section of seafood (mainly prawns and escargots), a salad bar, and fruits. In terms of cooked food items, on the days of our visit, there will grilled salmon, stir fried vegetables, stewed beef, seafood soup (with prawns, mussels and squids), pizzas, some pastries and desserts, probably about all. Generally, the food were nice and no complaints.

Although hot beverages like coffee and tea are included, there was no ice cream, a little disappointing as most would provide that, be it 1 or 2 flavours.

Service wise, would commend that the staff did a great job! The used plates and utensils were cleared off promptly and staff were friendly and polite! And they will also contact you earlier to confirm your reservations.

There were 30% discounts as we made our reservations via Chope (reason why we visited twice over 2 weeks was that we bought the Chope vouchers twice by ""accident"" as the system was jammed and hanged and we thought that the purchase was not made and key in the 2nd time but both purchases were processed), and though it's cheaper then, we would have expected to have a few more dishes, such as fried noodles or rice, some local delights like fried carrot cakes, rojak or popiah etc. And for Japanese/Korean food lovers, you will be disappointed too as there was no single item from these countries too.

Though there was a live cooking station there, it was not functioning as a ""live cooking station"" whereby chefs would cook say spaghetti or laksa or noodles upon your order request like other cafes or restaurants. Perhaps it's more for the pizzas (as the oven over fire was at that station). a little under-utilized.

Having said that, we still enjoyed our both dinning here overall despite two very different offerings."
compliments,It’s service was Impeccable. Food is fresh & meticulously set. Cutlery & ambience is perfect. Pricing is affordable. Highly recommended
Great Lunch with Buddy,"The Chicken was perfectly brine, Lamb and beef was just delicious. All the food there was nice. Maybe except the pizza. The crust was hard and pizza was too cold. But can't be picky as the rest of the food was just delicious. For the price point, I would go back regularly."
Excellent experience and fine meats,"The service was excellent and the food was really sumptuous. The range wasn’t as large as other buffets but it was well done. The roast chicken and all the meats were extremely tender and juicy. If you are a meat lover, this is the place for you. The price is also reasonable with Chope dining vouchers for a hotel Christmas buffet."
Festive dinner,"Overall was an average buffet dining experience. The food was average, we were expecting a larger variety of food. The restaurant is known for their large selection of meat but we were not impressed as the taste weren’t memorable. Didn’t help when the place was dimly lit to the point it looked like the restaurant was not fully open for business."
Simple but delicious,"Not a huge selection for the buffet - but what there was delicious, fresh and the meat at the Carvery were amazing. It was our first visit, and we will go back."
Great food and ambience!,"The carving section had chicken, beef and pork and they all taste great. There was quite a number of cooked foods to choose from that rendered me spoilt for choice. Came in not having too high an expectations but we were pleasantly surprised at the quality of food and the service staff were delightful. I believe the not-so-good reviews were by customers who were expecting a much bigger buffet spread like in other bigger hotels. But honestly, for The Carvery's price point, my partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal and thought that we would definitely come back again."
Quality food and excellent service!,"My friend recommended that we celebrate our 50 birthday celebration at The Carvery and the experience was a delight! So in the subsequent month, I went with another friend to celebrate her birthday and the standard of food and service was consistently good! I will come again!"
Awesome experience,"Great view, great taste, limited variety, meat & dessert is awesome. U wont regret for trying this out!"
A few very good dishes among the buffet spread,"The roast chicken was moistand juicy. The clams and mussels in the seafood stew were fresh and tasty. I like the beetroot and walnut stew, too."
Carvery 1 for 1,"Beef and lamb and roast chicken are so tasty with other many foods are worth , hope 1 for 1 offer will continou to full support !"
Value for money,"Food was generally good, meat was nice and tender and good selection spread. Was hoping for a little more choices for desserts"
Relaxing Saturday Luncheon with my husband and children,"I am excited to visit this restaurant for my birthday celebration because I love Le creuset cookware which is widely used by this restaurant. What made the dishes more enjoyable is the sight of the LC cookware keeping the food warm and moist. Although there is not a lot of variety, this is The Carvery - meat, people! Rotisserie chicken was delicious, warm and moist. Roast beef too! I rate it 5 because I came not for quantity but quality! A nice ambience with tables spaced out and very prompt service. The Chinese waitress brought my husband a finger bowl when she noticed he was peeling a prawn. That's attentiveness! I particularly like the wood baked pizzas. Lots of flavors. Totally worth the 1-1 Chope promo."
"''Issues'"" with purchased vouchers","Hi. The ambient is very good and the food is just right.
I had a problem with the vouchers. I thought what i purchased was for 1-for-1 and I purchased 2 vouchers for 4. I was shocked when the waitress told me that I have only purchased for 2 persons! However, she was very nice to help me secure another voucher for 2 persons. Hope someone could look into this and clarify exactly what I have purchased was for 2 persons or for 4 persons. Thank you."
Slight disappointment,Did not replenish the baked oysters after the first tray was served and roast beef was undercooked. Chef at the meat service counter seemed disinterested. He served a tiny piece of roasted pork with 90% fat. Limited selection of desserts. Table service is excellent and the 1 for 1 vouchers offered good value for Sunday buffet.
Declining food quality; service remains excellent,"Went for the lunch buffet. Don't get me wrong - the food is generally very good. BUT their main attraction is supposed to be the meat station (hence ""The Carvery""). Unfortunately the carving station only had 1) roast beef, 2) roast chicken. The roast beef was a little tough; the chicken was, well, chicken. This was very disappointing. I want MEAT!

The service was excellent as always."
Bad,The range of food is limited. The nice of food is bad too. It is sad to say that their pastries are better than their main : meat. This one star is basically for their services.
Wonderful Ambience,Greeted by friendly staff esp. Ms May. Ambience was wonderful with seats looking out over the pool as we dine. Spread was good and better than expected except meat dish of beef and lamb too well done for my liking as I prefer more rare.
Veriety of food at The Carvery,My wife likes the variety of food at The Carvery. Peaceful and Quiet to enjoy the dinner at night. Can spend a few hours there and enjoy the ambience.
Restaurant that lives up to its Name,"Went with my family of 6 to The Carvery, to celebrate my mum’s birthday. Perhaps due to the 7th month, the restaurant was rather empty, with just 4 tables.
Was pleasantly surprised that they acceded to our request to waive corkage if we purchased a bottle from them.
The Carvery lived up to its name - the buffet had quite a good selection of meats - pork roast, beef short ribs, pork chops, beef stew, baked oysters, trout, salads, asparagus, pasta and pizzas.

The meats were very well done and tender, which was a pleasant surprise - many of the buffet restaurants tend to have over-done meats.

Service was impeccable and prompt, and the manager of the restaurant was exceptional. Little things count, and the fact that they changed the wine glasses for the different bottles of wines, was appreciated. The only disappointing thing was that the dessert section was not replenished, even though some items had run out. Additionally, the complimentary birthday cake was a cup cake with a candle! It would have been great if they had provided a small proper cake - many restaurants do this already.

Would I go back - yes, for sure - hopefully the quality of the food and the service remain good."
"Excellent Food, Service and Atmosphere!","This was my third time eating at The Carvery, and once again, the food never fails to impress me (especially the meat)!

Came with my boyfriend for dinner and thankfully, it wasn’t very crowded. We were given our own table in the corner (the atmosphere was pretty romantic by the way). When our table light flickered out, the staff were quick to realise and replaced it efficiently. Service was great as well!

Once again I am impressed and will definitely come back again."
"Good food, excellent service","Went for the dinner buffet. The selection is not wide, but the food is good and the service is always excellent."
"Small choices, but big on quality and flavour","The reservation and staff were the highlight of The Carvery. Each was professional in how they served their guests. Even a double booking made (my mistake) was rectified with pleasant smiles and seriousness, which only shows how well trained the staff were.
The food was another gem. Being a family of boys, with good cooks among us, quality was prime. The meats on the carvery table were well done, with interesting compliment-salts. The Chef there was very knowledgeable.and helped the uninformed as I was. The cooked foods were quickly replenished and nicely cooked. Flavour was very good, that even a simple fish soup was laced with the bouquet of saffron shreds. The crunchy Mac & Cheese was nicely balanced with a while sauce dip, which added a new dimension to an already all time favourite. The pastry chef making the vanilla sauce was equally passionate about his creation, and it was a delight to speak to him concerning right balance and intensity of vanilla beans (!).
On the whole, a pleasant Sunday lunch, with lovely ambiance, and even nicer people. (Except for a screeching toddler, whose parents saw no wrong in such bad behaviour... ah well, one can't have his cake and eat it i suppose Bravo The Carvery!!"
goood,the selection wasn’t the biggest but the food was quite good and the staff were rlly helpful! pls have more discounts 😘
Cosy place having a good pool view,"Food spread is not big, But food is prepared in batches keeping the food fresh and warm. Food tastes delicious with fresh ingredients."
Experience at The Carvery,"I have been to The Carvery twice and found the food selection and ambience very well. However, on my second visit, I have found the beef to be on the rare side. I have observed this as the beef had a fairly constant texture from one end of the slab to the other end. Other than the beef, the pork and chicken was delicious as usual. In addition, the restaurant servers could serve coffee and tea instead of directing diners to help themselves; this was not consistent with my first visit when the servers pro-actively served me the hot beverages."
Good for those who love medium rare roast beef,"A good place for those who love roast beef, rotisserie roasted chicken and crispy pork. Parma ham with rock melon was also served at the salad bar which is good. However, the desserts were simple. Good service from staff though."
Bbq buffet,Bbq buffet but there were only 3 bbq items. Food were top up after 8pm after several reminders. Not value for $ if not for 1:1
NO REPLENISHMENT,"Have been there about a dozen times before. However this time 4 of us had dinner and were very disappointed. Although the wait staff were very nice, the chefs at the carvery were hard to find. Bread rolls disappear very quickly and you have to wait another 15-20 mins before refills and only if you ask.
Hot dishes by 8.45pm were empty and not replenished! When asked they said no more! Dinner is supposed to end at 10pm. Never again! Spoilt what was looked forward to as a nice birthday dinner"
Satisfactorily Filled,"I like the place. Got feel. Felt at home. Next to infinity pool. Respectable buffet line. Not spectacular but decent. Won't overeat :)

Served in cast iron pots. Very appetizing cuz did not look like some mass production line. But the lids super heavy lah. Not for elderly with weak arms. Every time take food must open and close lids. Troublesome. Can get injured. Hope next time the lids removed away.

Service stations did get messy. No one to clean up seemingly. Desserts - cakes served whole. So after a while, the cakes looked pathetically yucky with different eater chopping up the cakes any o how. So wasted. Hope next time cake cut up in neat bite-sized pieces before serving.

Foodwise - Just right. Not too salty or oily. Or too sweet. Thanks chefs!!
I didnt take the carved beef cuz too raw for me :( But everything else was good.

Service staff - smart looking but I wish I could cheer them up a bit :) All very serious one. I wanted to start eating a bit before 12pm sharp but was told chefs would scold. Oops! So hungry lor. I think was there ten minutes before time.

Overall good. With 1 for 1 deal, more than grateful. I will be back. This time after 12pm."
Chope One for One voucher,"Standard dropped, food varieties lessen and replenishment of food was Super slow.
Came in January for my Bday dinner, paid full price of $58++ on a week day dinner.
Impressed with the food then. Anyhow I supposed when there is a 1 for 1 offer it's
like this."
food selection varies,"overall the food is tasty, but the selection varies .. someday the selection is very good but someday its average"
"Nice ambience , good service staffs and good food","This is the restaurant that they serve quality food. Staffs are very friendly and good for family gathering .

I would visit it regularly because of the good service rendered .

I feel very warm because of the service given . Would not hesitate to recommend to my friends cause of the service and the quality of the food ."
Brilliant choices of meat and seafood in the buffet spread,"This is my 2nd time at The Carvery. I especially enjoy their stewed mushrooms and fish. The pasta was done well and the meats are good as usual. A brilliant setting, good for cosy conversations."
Nice Ambience,"Bought the chope buffet one-for-one voucher. Great food and Ambiance for the price. Really loved the Roast lamp and perfectly brined Chicken. Down side, they got kids to be servers. I guess that is why they have the one-for one deal? So that people won't bother that they got kids as servers? I mean they really ARE kids. They look 13 - 14 years old. I asked the boy to give me ice water, you know what he said? ""Ice no more""
HUH? Hotel no more ice ah. That's funny right LOL"
Buffet 1-1,"Foods are well spread and Beef are very fine and good taste, like it very must !will come back again !"
Not much varities,not suitable at all. not much varieties at all. and not halal friendly. wouldnt recommend. and they dont have any juices just plain water
Excellent food,Very polite and attentive staff. Accommodating when we needed to change our reservation. The trout with berry compote was amazing! The beef was also excellent. I heard the pork was good too but I didn’t try that. Soups and other dishes were also recommended by other family members. Will return!
Carvery Steak,Like the medium done beef/mutton steak and the selection of greens. Repeat visit. Will visit it again soon.
Great ambience and food,"Thanks to Chope, is certainly value for money with great food especially the Pork knuckle and Beef. Above this the ambience and customer service are good."
Dinner buffet,"Friends took us to this restaurant at the top of the Park Hotel Alexandria. We enjoyed a nice selection of meats, salads, side dishes and desserts. The service was professional and efficient, and the atmosphere was warm and relaxing."
Great buffet!,"Went there for the roasts, great buffet as usual. Spread may not be as extensive as other buffets, but it is Quality food over quantity and variety!"
Good service and good food,I and my friends were happy with the service provided . The food selection is good . The quality of food was very much better than many other hotels . The most wonderful part is the selections of cooked vegetables were rather wide .This can not be found in other hotels . We also enjoy the environment- nice view.
Great quality meats,"The meats are amazing! But the guy doing the carving needs to smile. He looks reluctant to serve and is a bit ""stingy"" with the portions. I can understand if he doesn't want customers to waste food but he almost looks like he's judging you when you ask for a slice."
Good deal,"Nest in a cozy corner next to the pool, the restaurant is not crowded and with a good selection of premium meat."
Service Excellence,Staff - cashier and servers gave their best services and especially the front desk cashier was very helpful
Superb value for money buffet,"The Carvery is located in a hotel that’s not in the heart of town or in the main Orchard Road Shopping Belt. But it has a relaxing view of the poolside and situated opposite Queensway Shopping Centre (locals know that this is THE place in Singapore to buy sportswear) and alongside IKEA Bukit Merah.
After shopping to you heart’s content and working up an appetite, the Carvery offers are wonderful buffet that’s simple but filled with quality dishes. If you look forward to local delights like Laksa or Hokkien Mee which is featured commonly in some hotel buffets, you would be better off visiting Alexandra Hawker Centre just across the road! Here is where you feast on Roast Beef and Roast Chicken (superbly tender and juicy), fresh seafood (mussels,prawns) great bread, assorted cheeses, great desserts (changes over time but the bread puddling, panna cotta and apple crumble is very delicious). The salad bar is varied and the hot food selection is always interesting. Recently I enjoyed the salmon quiche and thin crust pizzas and I really enjoyed it. I usually avoid pastas which fill me up quickly but the pasta dishes here are too well cooked not to have a small helping.
My only beef with beef (pardon the expression) is that whole it is tender (probably sous vide), there is char or smokiness of a BBQ style.
To top it off, service is fantastic. Greeted with smiles always. Attentive without being intrusive. Strongly recommended and don’t forget to use the Chope App to benefit from the $50 1-1 promotion they have. $25per person for a lunch buffet of such value in Singapore is just crazy good"
Yummy Roast Beef,"Overall not bad, but you need to like roasts. Beef was good. Desserts were a little lacking. Food was more western than Asian. I would come again, except that it’s not food that I tend to eat regularly. Service was good at the start. But by 2pm, they seemed to have fewer service associates around. Not sure why."
Great meat cuts - Great service,Great service and good quality of food. Great for celebrations as the atmosphere is very private. Good location and Convenient. Very good bread butter pudding.
Carvery food review,"Savory beef, tenderloin and chicken. Nice scenery and attentive waiters Prompt service in serving beverages Timely change of food at catering desks"
Not user friendly,the staffs are not well trained about using the system. Will not visiting the place using the chope apps.
Not bad,"Popped in here for a quick feed, steak was not bad, bit undercooked but still tasted good, right next to park hotel alexandra"
Excellent meats and good service,"For the record, this is not your typical 'buffet' restaurant that serves huge quantities of different types of food. Instead, they serve good quality prime rib, tenderloin, rotisserie chicken, and pork knuckle.

In addition to these good quality meats, you will also be treated to baked oysters (served on weekends only, where the buffet cost more), baked trout, lamb stew, and other British style food.

As we went during the Chope 1 for 1 promotion, it was very good value for money as we paid S$73 for a party of two. Else, I would still go for special occasions as the food and service are indeed good and enjoyable."
"Good food, great service.","Visited on Tuesday, 2nd April with 1-for-1 deal. The buffet spread was decent but the quality of food made up for it, especially their specialty beef, pork belly and rotisserie chicken. Service was excellent - plates were cleared quickly and staff were very pleasant. Great value especially with the 1-for-1 promotion"
The Carvery,"I've been here before, so I knew what to expect. The food mostly did not disappoint, with the roasts and seafood being highlights. The pasta and pizza were cold however, but later on there were fresh pizzas and those were great as well. The staff was excellent, extremely attentive, helpful and friendly.
Areas for improvement: The carver should be at the station instead of inside the kitchen, while I knew how it worked, I witnessed someone trying to cut the food himself because of the absence of the server. Also, drinks selection can be improved instead of just cold or hot water.
The prices listed did have a discrepancy compared to the actual price (Chope's 1-4-1 was 68+ while the restaurant had one meal for 57, but overall still good value)"
I now wish it was not a 'Family' restaurant,"I gave a 'Poor' for atmosphere because there were very annoying noisy children running & screaming their heads off during the whole night. In fact it nearly put off my appetite. Staff members could maybe advise parents to discipline their children or offer some 'tranquilizer'. Our ears were ringing when we left the restaurant.
The food has always been good as usual, in particular the meats selection. Thank you again."
Doesnt feel like a carvery.. Give me a brazilian churras anytime,"Limited meat options.. Carvery but just 2 kinds of beef, 2 kinds of pork and 1 ckn. No fresh oysters. Only baked.. The supply is pretty constant though..the boiled crab legs doesnt get topped up though. Wont return. Partner commented the place is too dark to see our food as well."
Good service and ambience,"The staff was attentive and food was replenished, while plates cleared fast. The ambience was great as it was not noisy and crowded. Food selection was not typical of a buffet spread, but more than enough selection. Quality of food was good as well."
Delicious international cuisine at affordable prices!,"Taking advantage of CHOPE 1:1 promotions, we had two appetizing weekend High Tea consecutively! If you have questions, friendly server May is always available to help and attend to you even at last minute. Good quality food and highly professional personal service at excellent prices!"
Lunch buffet,Carving selection was good. The spread was not much. Good thing was that lattes came with it. Could have been better when a better choice of selection given the limited servings.
Birthday celebration,"The food and service were good, value for money. The food is better than some of the 5 star hotel in Singapore..
The only set back was when I booked through Chope and indicate it is my husbands 75 years birthday, I expected a piece of cake for us to celebrate at The Carvery but NOTHING."
Ok meats but limited spread,Enjoyed beef and desserts but find.the spread very limited. Not worth the $70 peice tag. Good value on the 2 for 1 promotion though. Can't see they can sustain when the promotion ends...
hidden gem,"food was delicious, especially the aged beef at the carving table. atmosphere was peaceful and without pressure. service staffs were polite and attentive to our needs. value for money with the 1-1 offer."
Great service and pool view!,"Good was so so, the variety was not as wide as other buffets but with the chope discount it is quite reasonable. Staff service was attentive and friendly. Has a good view of the pool, relaxing atmosphere and family \ kid friendly with a small play area and free sculptured balloons."
DINNER BUFFET,"Not much selection, don't look like hotel food. More like home cooked food. The food are very very saltish. The chef at the grill station somehow not really willing to give us the meat. The water melon are not fresh..em like soak in the sugar syrup. Not worth eating."
Sumptuous!,"Good food - spread is not too big, but i like most of their items. Good service, staff always readily changing the plates. Value for money - it's a rare find in expensive Singapore. Cozy ambiance. Definitely will return."
Great buffet for meat lovers!,"Went there for the excellent meat and roasts. Had the usual steak, juicy and tender, good with salt, but the sauce and yorkshire pies made it even better! Appetizer, hot dishes selection were also good. Dessert included haagen dazs ice-cream!"
buffet dinner,i visited this restaurant cos i am a meat lover. decent food quality and service. the pool view beside the restaurant is fantastic.
Good buffet and service,"The restaurant has good view with outdoor pool and bar. Service is comfortable. Food spread is limited but still reasonable for it is famous for roasts. They offered lamb, beef and chicken in a Saturday lunch. Chicken is juicy and other two are tender. Good value and would recommend."
1 for 1 Buffet,Good value if there’s promo. The buffet spread is standard and the food quality is above average. The service was good as the staffs are friendly and helpful. Nice ambience to hang out.
"Meat station was lackluster, despite that being the highlight of the entire restaurant","Wasn’t impressed by the meat station although it’s what they’re famous for. Meats were either underseasoned or overcooked.

We used Chope 1-for-1 vouchers so it wasn’t too expensive. Wouldn’t pay full price for sure.

The cooked food stations and the dessert stations were slightly better and that’s why they get 3 stars instead of 2.

The biggest saving grace for this restaurant was the attentive and welcoming service personnel at the restaurant. Kudos to them for raising the bar for all other departments in this Restaurant’s operations!"
Great Value Sunday Brunch,"We did not stay at the Hotel but called in for Sunday Brunch. S$40 plus tax. Friendly staff, very good selection and variety of food for the price. Good Carvery with selection of 3 meats and a good selection of other dishes plus salads, soups starters and some very nice desserts. Excellent value and would recommend"
Some suggestions,We had an enjoyable Buffet Lunch at the Carvery but we find that the food are not kept hot enough except for the Soups and the cook to order items. We had the Bread & Butter Pudding for Dessert and this is cold too. Overall we enjoyed the Roast beef the most.
Only the roast pork and beef at live station were great,"Went there because of 1 for 1 promotion, otherwise I would not pay this amount at full price. Only their roast pork and beef at live station were great, the rest of the buffet spread was really normal, including desserts. They put the haagan daz ice cream fridge at a corner and I almost missed it. However, atmosphere was good especially during evening whereby you can view the sunset. Outside the restaurant is an infinity pool."
What a wonderful lunch experience!,"Thanks to the Chope voucher was able to enjoy the lunch with a discount. Although the meat carvery is the attraction, deservedly so, the rest of the spread had nice pickings too. I read some comments that the spread is narrow and had no sashimi, but thankfully so, as there are so many hotel buffets that offer sashimi and they are never as good as the Japanese restaurants. The rest of the spread has an interesting take to it. Well done to Chef Ian !
Fortunately , this place is outside the CBD and no MRT nearby , so it's not crowded during lunch. Hope I am not spreading too word too much :-)
Free hot beverages is a welcome accompaniment. So was attentive staff :-). Kudos to Mgr Moy Tee, Paul and May."
"Great food, good service","The ambience was very conducive and cozy. The service was very good. The service staff ensured that we were comfortable in our seats and attend to our requests with a smile. The roasts were very good, with variety of cooked food. The quality of the food was also there. I would certainly be back in the future."
Highly Recommended,"Very good spread of food available, served with excellent service. Able to taste home-cooked flavor in most of the dishes served. Very traditional cooking methods used. Nice ambiance as well."
Average,"We had high expectations for the beef but was slightly disappointed. The seafood e.g. crab, prawns nevertheless were fresh."
Nada,"Hotel and ambiance is nice, but that’s as far as it goes for the nice things about this lunch buffet. The restaurant is well-staffed, but they never seem to be attentive enough. The spread for the lunch is abysmal and they are never refilled, so once it’s gone, it’s gone. Waffle was cold, bread was hard, and pasta is absolutely tasteless. Will not recommend, unless it’s on a promo. Roasted chicken, fresh prawns are probably the saving grace of the lunch. It was a decent lunch, no doubt, but when a restaurant buffet have such a small spread, you will expect they do their dishes superbly well, but you’ll be sorely disappointed if you are going in with an expectation to be wow-ed by the food. Go for the ambiance, go if there’s a nice discount. Honestly, IKEA next door serves better, warmer and more wholesome food."
Meat Lovers,"If you like meat this is the place tobe, roast beef, lamb was simply delicious and tender. The ox tail stew was good as well."
amazing foodie place,Amazing place to eat and dine. Menu is also great. The service is fast and good. The taste of food is also great. Had a nice time eating out here
Great,Great food and Great Atmosphere to bond with friends.Reasonable price as well. Really like the meats and the waffle station. Could do with an ice-cream counter though.
Good quality,"Prime rib was not as good as before. Overall the experience was exceptional, as the preparation was focused more on quality rather than quantity."
Surprised Dinner,"Read couple of comments that says the Buffet was not price worthy so wasn't expecting anything much just a meaty dinner with minimal side and desserts.I was really in for a surprised, the Buffet was tasty, unlike the usual buffets, there isn't many dishes and desserts offered BUT the food and dishes were unique and Very tasty and delicious. I should have asked the Chef for a whole chicken ha ha ha it was the Best roast chicken that I have tasted"
For meat lovers,"The roasts (beef /pork/chicken) were particularly good. Other than meat, there was a good selection of seafood and hot dishes. The desserts whilst not many, are sufficient. The Ice cream is fridge is easily missed as it it is placed away from the buffet and there should be a signboard. Staff are attentive and pleasant. We were a group of 14 and enjoyed the 1 for 1 offer. This was our 3rd time at this restaurant. Overall, a pleasant experience!"
Great dining experience!,"Always a favorite dining venue for us, especially that we are meat lovers. The roasts, be it chicken, beef or pork are just superb! Other side dishes are also good!"
Great lunch!!,"Wonderful sumptious lunch! While the spread may not be as wide but you get quality rather than quantity. Starting from the meats to the starters to the cooked section to the desserts, they are all very agreeable. This is even better when there is a promotion under chope!
Kudos to Chef Ian for keeping the food quality consistently high .
Not forgetting the attentive and hardworking staff."
Visit on Jan 11th.,"Good environment & price,but can consider to increase the varieties by increase the price. Generally,it is good for casual gathering."
delicious!,"overall i had a good experience dining at The Carvery. my dishes were cleared timely, water filled whenever its running low. this was upkeep even with the increasing number of patron as the dinner crowd sets in."
An affordable and delightful buffet lunch,"I was asked to write a review of this restaurant and I reluctantly agree to do so. Because this is such a wonderul find that I fear that a review too good will make it crowded :-)
Anyway to start off there is a chope discount of second diner at $1 so it's really a no brainer.
It's all about the meats I read but the other spread items are just as delectable. Almost all the items are hits , a few misses. As for the size of the spread, I disagree with comments that it's narrow. Lunch it's more than enough that I have to consciously restrain myself.
Beef is the star, although missus also love the lamb. Hardly eat chicken at a buffet but they do it so well.
Sufficient cheese spread, nice desserts and free flow of beverages. Service is good and prompt. Chef Ian is also quite friendly when approached. Service staff Paul and May, old timers but quietly do their job well.
All in a wonderful lunch! Don't tell too many people...hehe..."
Lunch Buffet,"the buffet spread is smaller than many other buffets i have been to, but decent enough. No sashimi unfortunately, but they do have good roasts. service there was fantastic, with great ambience for a family gathering. also got the buffet deal at second person at $1, so it's overall very value for money."
Delicious Spread,Wide spread of delicious cooked food along with fresh seafood on ice. Attentive staff constantly refill our water and clear used plates.
Food - Roast,Beef Good portion/ Average.Mutton very good. Moist and medium rare. Beef Goulash meat is a bit dry. Will visit again for the roast.
Excellent,I have many praised from friends for organising at The Carvery. They are bringing their families this November to enjoy the premium foods catered at The Carvery.
Fair Game,"We made a mistake in not making payment to ""CHOPE' (an app for making restaurant reservations & enjoying their price promotions) as the app was not very clear with their T & C.
The receptionist & manager of The Carvery were also not helpful in assisting us to make the relevant payment, citing they have no knowledge on how to do it! After a good 10 minutes of 'negotiations'....the issue was resolved and we could enter and enjoy the buffet dinner.
Well, enjoy we did......with the reasonable food spread and their excellent service!"
Excellent & Reasonably Priced Buffet,"This is the place for a reasonably priced buffet for meat eaters. There are roast beef, lamb, chicken, pork ribs, lamb stews, prawns, etc., all very good quality. We brought our London friends there for lunch & they love it very much. The good service deserved some mention: We purchased some Chope vouchers but were unable make our bookings online & their staff Mr Koh Char Way was very helpful & patient in helping us senior citizens complete bookings online despite a busy evening for him. Thank you! Compliments also go to Ms Lim Moi Tee & Ms May for making our lunch with our friends a very enjoyable experience with their cheerfulness & attentive service. Our friends were impressed. Overall, we would recommend this place to anyone. Our overseas friends said they would."
Lunch Buffet @ Carvery,"Delicious roasted chicken! Both the lamb n beef carvings are also good, esp the lamb which is tender yet has that meaty texture at the same time. Great value w the Chope vouchers. Fast n friendly service from both the waiting staff as well as chefs. Wat can i say other than 'I'll be back!'"
good meat,"nice place without the crowd of those busy buffet line. good meat, good food, service was good. dinner starts only at 18 30hrs."
