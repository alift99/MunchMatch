"Great food, service and environment!","The beef short rib is so tender and flavourful! Got a complimentary tiramisu as it was my birthday, and surprisingly the tiramisu is so good, so creamy and the flavour is so strong!

The waiter is nice and gave some recommendations on the food!

The environment is so chill and nice, the fairy lights are so pretty too!"
Hene - Outstanding Customer Service,Heme went above and beyond to assist my husband with his dietary needs. He made sure the food that were served suited ny husband. Heme is a Top Guy!
"Fab service, fab food, great ambience",Amazing place and wven better food and service! Robert was assigned to our table and he went out of the way to get all we asked for! Amazing Chap ! Thank you so much! We had a lovely girls night out!
Nothing more to ask for,Service was great and they had all the food choices yiu would need. Quality was also good. Would gladly go back.
Fantastic,Food was great as usual. Outdoor seating was cooling. Robert was attentive and have great knowledge in recommending the drinks.
Hisham - very friendly abd good service,Hisham was very friendly abd attentive to what we need. Food was value for money and desert was impressively prensented
great !,"Had a great time here, food and drinks were delicious and relatively well priced in my opinion. Staff were extremely helpful and prompt. Robert took care of us and was extremely proactive and was always there when we needed him !"
Great food and service!,"Recommend the coconut rice! We went for the breakfast buffet. Unlimited coffee included, kids below six eat free. Great service from Dwin (and?) Hisham. Would return for sure."
Family staycation,Stayed with family for 3D2N. Room was clean and comfy. Breakfast was pretty good. (Potatoes üëçüèª‚ù§Ô∏è) Swam in the pool in the morning and the ladder was a bit dirty. Overall good stay. üòä
A pleasant surprise,"A very pleasant dining experience! The vibe was perfect! Love the beef short ribs.

I‚Äôd indicated that we were here to celebrate my partner‚Äôs birthday and right after our meal, the service crew came with a beautiful pot of tiramisu that looks like a plant. Turns out a surprise for us! :)"
Great Vibe!,"We had never been to Robertson Quay before in Singapore and happened upon this restaurant. Was very nice inside with a modern feel and very good staff. There is also an outside eating area which was lovely under the trees. We order an entree of salt and pepper squid which was a very large dish. Plenty for two people to share.
I had a steak as a main and my husband had spaghetti vongole. Both dishes were
served in a timely manner. The food was delicious and not too expensive seeing it is Singapore. Would definitely recommend this restaurant. Bar seating is also available for those who like sitting high and looking out windows."
Birthday dinner,Great good and very attentive service from Robert. Keep up the good job! Love the pizzas and must order the tiramisu.
Great Italian food,"Had the usual pasta and pizza on a pleasant Christmas day with friends. The quality was superb. If you like Mezcal, try the cocktail Mayan Temple. Outstanding!"
Friendly and accommodating staff,The staff were very welcoming and very attentive to all our needs. It made our whole experience feel wonderfull and left us wanting to come back again.
real italian pizza in Singapore,"This place rivals the best pizza anywhere in the world. Crunchy crust, delicious real Italian tomato sauce, choice of mozarella or burata and many other toppings.. Very affordable price. For true food lovers, please try the truffle pizza!!! To die for."
Great Food,"This restaurant is located just near the Quay and the InterContinental. Opens about 12 noon daily. I met some friends there for lunch. We enjoyed some pizzas, the food was tasty. The drink service was a little slow, often had to call the staff over as the drinks were left sitting on the bar. The negroni cocktails were awesome. The wine list was pretty good. I would return for the taste and quality of the food."
Very enjoyable,"Very enjoyable dinner at Publico. We were seated reasonably promptly but then took quite a while to get drinks order taken and drinks delivered. The remainder of teh orders were taken quite efficiently and delivered in a timely manner, except for desert, which again took ages to be delivered.

Each of the starters and mains were fantastic, we really enjoyed, Pizzas were fantastic."
Great service by Hisham,"I was here with my family in Christmas and was attended to by Hisham. He was very hospitable and ensured that my family and I was treated very well! All my orders were well taken care off and we had a great time here! He spoke to us on a personal level, and ensured that we were welcomed here."
Service excellence (Robert and Heme),"Had a lovely Christmas eve family luncheon here. The restaurant was bright and comforting but most importantly pet friendly. Staff were welcoming and genuinely happy to serve. Our order was taken wrongly but Heme was obliged and waived it for us. Food was good although fries were a tad salty.

I'll definitely be back again especially with my pup!"
Great service from Robert thanks,"Great service from Robert, had a wonderful time celebrating Christmas Eve here! Nice and cool place to hang out with pet too!"
Arrogant and Unprofessional,"We visited this establishment today to have a post lunch drink. The restaurant and outside area were not busy. The ma√Ætre‚Äôd dismissed us and suggested that as it was expected to rain soon, the guests seated outside would need to be moved inside soon. We ended up having a drink a few places down the river, it did not rain whilst we were there and well after.

Naturally, we will not return nor would we suggest others should. Poor service by an arrogant and unprofessional woman."
Waste of time,"Wasted 45 minutes here in this place. Ordered an Aperol and a simple lunch, after half an hour the restaurant said they had forgotten about both orders. Eventually walked out since my lunch break was over. Would highly recommend to skip this place - don‚Äôt know what the staff is paid for, but certainly not for serving customers."
One of the reason we decided to stay with Intercon Robertson Quay.,"Had breakfast here at publico multiple times and their service never fail to amaze us. My day was always off to a great start because of their amazing hospitality and they are definitely one of the reason to us deciding which hotel to stay with. Not to mention they serve amazing food and coffee too (like really good coffee).
Special shout-out to the service team: Vera, Edwin, Hisham, Pris and also to those that I did not manage to get their names!"
Vera Hisham,"She is an amazing waitress! Prompt, never had to wait and never had to call for her. Publico should be honored to have her on the staff."
"Good food, drinks and place","Good food. Nice place, the drinks are also really good I recommend a totally coming back The caccio pepe with truffle was delicious"
Friendly Helpful Staff,"initial disappointment as we tried walk in for 2 days in a row but no tables for both lunch and dinner.
3rd time the charm as we made reservation for lunch on sat but received sms saying reservation cancelled!!

since we are stayca nearby, we walk over for lunch to ask n try our luck 1 last time at 12pm and after the usher checked, he too was puzzled and promptly seat us indoor as it wasnt at capcity in anyway

served by Aloysius, very friendly and helpful, too eager to do his work as he was the only one buzzing around at lightspeed to ensure his area of responsibility is well served ( can see his visible sweat! LOL)

will recommend to come for food and Tiramisu!"
Good food,"Good food, good ambience and great service by Daniel! Pizza was delicious and foie gras risotto was good. Highly recommended."
First Visit,"The atmosphere was such a vibes walking into the restaurant, the staff were very accommodating and I was impressed with how many times they confirmed with me exactly how I liked my cocktail to be done, just to make sure it turned out perfect, which it did! It was very close to the one I had in London, which alot of bars have failed to recreate in Singapore. I was so pleasantly surprised. I would also like to specially commend Ronica on her superlative service, I would definitely love to come back knowing she's there! Lovely staff, beautiful vibes and delicious food, what's not to like?

Very nice place in beautiful setting,"Located at Intercontinental, almost completely in green. Food is good - pizza and short ribs are fantastic. Service is very nice"
Heme is the best,What an amazing afternoon. The food and Heme wee so amazing!! Definitely be back again. Loved the food and service!
"Great food and service, shout-out to Sara and Ricky!!",Amazing food and great ambience. Servers are busy yet they are still very attentive. Sara and Ricky are super helpful and made our time here even better. Definitely enjoyed myself on a Friday afternoon!
Great Christmas with Sara,"Amazing Christmas lunch experience goes yes by Sara.

Great staff!,"The staff here was so friendly and attentive. They always went over and above, especially Vera, Hisham, and Yan. The breakfast food and service are amazing. Great coffee."
AMAZING SERVICE BY RONICA,"I had dinner with our mum and sister here and it was nothing short of amazing. Super warm and attentive service by Ronica - including stopping by to chit chat with us, asking us about our day and if we enjoyed the food etc. We came for the happy hour prosecco and left very delighted - food was very good, pizzas and pastas were delicious, hot and very well presented. Drinks were always topped up even before we asked. Restaurants are aplenty in Singapore but we can count very few that has such good service. Thank you Ronica - already recommended to all our friends and customers too!"
Lunch,Kudos to Publico team for making our team lunch a special one! Special shoutout to Heme and Hisham who made sure our meals are well put together!
The Legend Siva!!,"Shout out to the legend named Siva who is truly a brand ambassador for Publico. He is the outlet manager and made our visit special at their restaurant whilst I was hosting a friend from overseas. Incredible hospitality and went out of his way to make sure we have a good time. I am defo going back for him

All it takes is to be nice and polite"
Really nice service,Wonderful service and breakfast at one of the nicest locations in Singapore. Vera and Edwin from the service team always welcome you with a smile in the morning. Staying on a business trip but once at the hotel there is such a relaxed atmosphere around Robson Quay‚Ä¶.you just have to enjoy
"Exceptional food, stellar service",Great ambience amazing food super attentive staff (ricky). Enough reasons to come back soon. Memorable dinner evening for me and my family :)
Public Singapore,The team #Publico in Singapore Intercontinetal Hotel were so friendly and accomodating. Excellent service and the food was always fresh and healthy.Not to mention the coffee was just like I have at home.
Great service & food,"Great service provided by Hisham, Vera, Edwin and the team. Food selection were great and service provided were prompt. Kudos to the team!"
Great but ‚Ä¶,"We have been Patrons of Publico both dining in and mostly take-always, especially during the pandemic. One on of our previous take-away, both pizzas were very burnt. Feedback was sent to the restaurant along with photos. Immediate response was we will have them replaced at the next order, which was this weekend. When my husband went to collect the pizzas (along with additional food which we have ordered and paid for), the restaurant manager was waiting for his arrival and explained reasons for the burnt pizza. He then concluded, from what we understand as, if it is not up to our standards then we should stop buying from Publico. Shocking, not to mention arrogant and disappointing considering we have been supporting the business throughout the pandemic and continue to do so. Guess we won‚Äôt be going back for burnt pizzas"
Awesome Staff!!,"It was definitely a wonderful night with a lot of beautiful people who served us!! I visited here with my friend for casual business talk, they were super nice & friendly, keep taking care of us:) Siva, Tharman, Vernon & Del!! You guys literally made our day by providing sincere customer service. I really truly recommend this place for any other visitors/travelers"
Compliment for Yan at Publico,Great food here and importantly we were served very well by our bar tender - Yan. He took care and ensure we have our drinks filled!
i love their truffle pasta.,"I was staying at the Intercontinental Hotel, and staff recommended me this restaurant located at ground floor of the hotel.

Restaurant Staff generally excellent service.

For those who love creamy pasta, you must try the ‚ÄúTruffle Cacio e Pepe‚Äù.

If you like tomato based pasta, try ""Crab ‚ÄúMamma Rosa‚Äù Rigatoni""

I like their truffle fries, big portion, enough for 2-3pax sharing.

Happy to meet the executive chef Kim Gates, a big thank to him who made my stay special. He is the reason I will come back to Intercontinental and dine here again."
Excellent service overall üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç‚ù§Ô∏è,"Food and drinks ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èexcellent service by Anne also the supervisor woody,and of course the service crew Vera and heme,we had a blast night.thank you very much ‚ù§Ô∏è looking forward to go back there again."
Hair in the pizza/Burrata Pasta served without burrata,"We had a terrible experience at Publico at brunch time.
There was a strand of hair in the pizza and they served their special burrata pasta without the burrata.

Upon asking the staff and then the manager himself, nobody attended to us. We were told they are looking into it and we sat there for a long time without any updates from anyone, then they come back with the pasta by the time we had lost our appetites.

The manager didnt even bother to come back to our table to apologize or share any updates of what happened.

We would expect better service at a restaurant like Publico."
An amazing experience!!!,"What an incredible meal!! Firstly, as a solo traveler, it is not uncommon to be treated like a second class citizen. Stuck in the back or worse, told there is nothing available even when you see plenty of empty tables. This was NOT the case. Shown a beautiful table in a lovely garden atmosphere. The service was impeccable. But best was the wood fired pizzas!! A true treat. The crust was perfect and the flavor of the toppings was a delight. I had the Diavolo. So super tasty!! I was also assured that the pastas are equally delicious. OK, perhaps a little pricey but not any more than anything else on Robertson Quay. I'm a little embarrassed that I ate the entire 10""-12"" pizza, but I couldn't leave any behind. This is a DON'T MISS!! And I will be back!! Thank you Publico!! You made my night!"
Thank You!,"Thank you Vera, Edwin and Ann for the wonderful service! We had a great time here and food was excellent."
Great service ethic,"Vera, Edwin and Hisham gave 10/10 service - my wife started ordering champagne with breakfast, always a good way to start the day in seeing Singapore - we will be back"
Birthday Celebration Dinner,"Food was okay. Served by Ronica who is very observant and friendly. Requested for a better seat for birthday celebration, however we were placed at a small table under the bright spotlight. Spoken to two staff, but no one changed us to another table, even many tables were empty and vacant. The recommended Halloween cocktail was fantastic. But because of the uncomfortable seating, we did not continue our birthday drinks after finishing our meal. Hence, we headed out to find a better drinking place instead. Overall, it was fine and service was excellent. If reservation details or requests can be taken into consideration in arranging seats would be better."
Breakfast for Intercontinental Robertson Quay,The breakfast of the Intercontinental Robertson Quay is served in the Publico Restaurant. The breakfast is really amazing with a broad variety of food from international to asian with an egg and Pancakes/waffle Station. The staff is really friendly the Coffee is great.
"The main meal was good, but the dessert service was poor.","We had an enjoyable main meal, but the dessert service was poor.
After taking our dessert order, two of the four desserts we ordered arrived. Finally after asking when the remaining two desserts would be served we were told that they had no strawberry flavoured ice cream.
This in my opinion was very poor, and if we had known this at the time of ordering we would have gone elsewhere, and avoided the disappointment suffered by our granddaughter."
This is Intercontinentals Breakfast Hub,"Arrived for a 4 night stay and had the choice of using the club lounge or Publico - the offering was extensive and the service first class - I really enjoyed the offering - the eggs were as you requested and the crisp bacon was to die for.
Lovely staff - cant wait to come back tomorrow"
Dinner@Publico,Great service by the staff (Robert). Good ambience and friendly efficient staff in attendance. Food was great too. Pizzas here in Publico one of the better ones in SG.
"Good good, good experience",This is our third time here. Food was very good and if high standard. Team were particularly attentive to us as customers. We were served by Sarah / Rontia who were very friendly.
Birthday Celebration made special by Publico,"We reallly enjoyed the food, especially the pizza. Of course the experience is never complete without the attentive service of the staff ( thank you Sara and Ronica)."
Grazie mille Publico,Sara and Venna makes the fabulous team to make our mates‚Äô birthdays celebration more warmly and enjoyable! Grazie mille!
Excellent service,"Was served by Vera, Edwin and Hisham during Breakfast service as part of my stay at Intercontinental Robertson Quay. Greeted politely, dirty plates and cutlery were cleared frequently. Attentive to orders. Food was good, however spread could be improved (there used to be Laksa etc). All in all, highly recommended"
Pleasant experience at Publico,"Friendly staff with attentive service, we were well taken care of by Ms Vera and her colleagues. Everyone greets you with a lovely smile! Good buffet range for breakfast as part of hotel stay. Had a very pleasant experience."
Good breakfast buffet,Came in for the breakfast buffet. Great spread. Decent choices. Good mix of western and Asian food. The congee and soups were pretty lukewarm and could have been hotter. Excellent service from Vera and her team.
Great service and awesome drinks,"Came to the Marina as a last stop before my flight out and opted to have a late lunch at Publico, which turned into nearly a whole afternoon affair.
We didn‚Äôt have any reservations. But the host said we could sit at the bar. And what an awesome deal! Great view. Phenomenal service. And even better time gabbing away with my friend.
Erwin and Anne took awesome care of us. Everything from our handcrafted alcoholic, and non-alcoholic, coffee drinks. Paired well with a good meal = a great experience.

If you decide to dine at Publico at the Marina, suggest sitting at the bar and having Erwin and Anne custom make your drinks!"
Great fun,Free-flow girls brunch here. Had a good time. Sara was very friendly & hard working. Thank you Sara for your service:)
Free flow with good service,Sara is good in servicing our table. Will definitely come back again. Free flow worth the price here in Singapore.enjoy the brunch right my friends
Yu,"Always kind and full of patience. Lovely restaurant. And it open from morning to last night, shows exactly opposite face of the city. Working hard, play harder."
Music is too loud,"Music is too loud and it gets really noisy as there are big tables of people really ruining the atmosphere.. otherwise, pizza and broccolini were fantastic. Pasta and beef ribs were just OK - wouldn‚Äôt order them again. Hope they‚Äôll have more extensive choices of main courses in the future."
Sara,"Good food, nice ambiance and a perfect service from Sara, the waitress, who was super friendly, attentive and very professional"

Coffee,"Edwin made our coffee this morning. We each had 3 cups, excellent coffee!! Food was ok, but coffee excellent"
Ms.Carlix,"Freshly pressed and blended vege juice made of ginger, cucumber, celery &green apple. Perfectly wrap up the nice breakfast and help keep the digestion going for the day. Really love the refreshing taste and will definitely try it whenever I dine in here for room guest breakfast in Publico.Thanks EDWIN"
Great bar,"Publico is a regular haunt for us and always enjoyable! Great drinks & food as well as exceptional service. In particular Sara, Sha and Venna are lovely and welcoming. Would 100% recommend this bar!"

5-Star review for Sara!,"I was at Publico for a friend‚Äôs birthday brunch, Sara was a superb host and she assisted us with everything we needed! She was also very attentive and made sure to refill our glasses before they were empty. Overall she‚Äôs amazing and super helpful. Definitely coming back here with my friends to introduce them to Publico and Sara!"
sara is the best,"best brunch free flow in town. publicity Rob Quay is the place to come to celebrate on a big group. if you want great service, ask for Sara"
Sara is the Queen of Publico,"Every single time I come here, I‚Äôm treated like a princess when Ms Sara comes to take care of us.

The food is great but her service is better.

I don‚Äôt have to say much before she understands my requests and she always focuses on experience rather than just a meal.

Sara - Amore ‚ô•Ô∏è

Thank you for making every publico meal filled with love and happiness"
Amazing food and people,Had a lunch with my friend. Food was so delicious and the staffs were so nice and helpful. Special thanks to Sara :)
Wonderful time at publico,"Had a great time celebrating my friend‚Äôs birthday. Food & drinks are fine, and service is good. Sara was our waiter, she‚Äôs wonderful"
Lovely service by Sara!,Thank you so much for the great recommendations on food! The pizza and pasta were lovely. And for the amazing service!!!!!
Amazing Service during Breakfast at Publico,"Thanks a lot to Vera, Hisham and Edwin for their amazing service during the breakfast. I enjoyed it a lot and take wonderful memories with me."
Delicious and fresh!,"Our stay at the Intercontinental Hotel Singapore was nice. I enjoyed the breakfast buffet at the Publico Ristorante. The food was fresh and delicious including multiple options and varying cuisines. The Hisham, Dell and the other staff are friendly and attentive. Dining there in the morning was a great way to start my day."
Wonderful experience and great staff,"The staff at Publico are amazing, attentive and overall super friendly. They make the whole experience of dining at the restaurant very pleasant. A shout out specially to Hisham who kindly volunteered to share with us his insides on which of the food sections were halal options, which is very much appreciated since we were careful about our halal options. To Vera for her cheerful being and to Edwin for making great coffee every morning that perks up our day to a great start."

Fabulous night!,"Great food, great staff, great atmosphere and great music! We‚Äôll be back! A big thank you to Sara and the team for being so attentive."
Celebrating wedding anniversary at Publico,"We decided to celebrate our 3rd wedding anniversary at Publico and it was a wonderful celebration. The food was lovely, atmosphere were great and the service was top notch.

Sara and Pey were great hosts who attended to our needs and gave great recommendations.

Sara even threw us a little surprise because of the special occasion.

I would highly recommend the calamari, crab pizza and truffle pizza.

But don't forget to grab the tiramisu before you leave. It's one of the best in Singapore.

We will be back"
"Oh good Lord, no please!","I am utterly confused by the overwhelming number of positive reviews. As an Italian myself I do not recall a restaurant like this, ever.
The service was polite but very inefficient. The food, just a bad nightmare which I rather forget. Clearly cater not for Italians.
The pizza, although had quality produce, it was just too dry. The pasta could have been used to fix posters on the wall. Soft beyond imagination was simply disrespectful to the Italian cuisine. However the burrata was very good and the coffee just perfect.
Italians really dislike to have dirty tables. Once a dish is finished it should be cleared and not left piling up until the end of the meal.
Please clear your tables and don‚Äôt overcook your pasta. This is the basic ABC of the Italian cuisine. If you get this wrong, then, I have no idea how you manage to stay in business. Disappointing."
Tharma is the best!,"Just a tip- sit up to the bar and ask for Tharma- he always remembers our drinks and is so attentive to anything that comes up. Honestly, we keep coming back because of the incredible service and loyalty that is offered here. Carmine is also incredible and attentive to every detail. Everyone works together to ensure a delicious meal and experience. Highly recommend!"
Brunch before F1,"Imagine relaxed, fun and friendly food.
Great drinks, service and enjoyable atmosphere
Good music and great staff. The perfect recommendation for our first visit to Singapore.
BIG BIG THANKS to Hisham and Priscilla for:
A) amazing service
B) brilliant recommendations
C) cute service throughout"
"Amazing lunch, and even better service","What an amazing lunch! Thank you Hisham and Dell for making our lunch even more fabulous with your amazing food suggestions and amazing amazing service, 10 out of 10."
Public Singapore - get there!,"Great place for a long leisurely lunch! Service was attentive and we enjoyed the ambience. Thank you, we‚Äôll definitely be back!"
Excellent,"Excellent service by Muhaimin. Despite being the first time handling a shared crowd, he did a splendid job. Will come again."
Very good evening in Publico,"Very nice dinner in Publico with Nire very helpful, highly recommended. Enjoyed the pizza here were so delicious."
Great place for all kind of moods!,"Great vibe, delicious food and our server Shaw was so amazing! Would definitely make this as our regular spot!"
Nice vibe,Busy place with good vibe. Attentive service and great beer. Only problem is that pizza was raw in the middle ie oven not hot enough. Schoolboy error.
Great service,Good vibes and great service. Have to mention Anne & Delta were really friendly and helpful! Thank you!
Dining with Publico Ristorante,"Came on a staycay with my husband at Intercontinental Roberson Quay Hotel and we had opted for the breakfast (buffet style) at Publico Ristorante just next to the hotel. Fantastic service, variety of free flow food and best of all; free flow coffee and tea (cafe style). We enjoyed our stay so much!!"
