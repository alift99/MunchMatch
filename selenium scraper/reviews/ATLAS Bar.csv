Wow,You will feel a WOW moment as you enter the bar. The ceiling was way way high with gorgeous decor. The ambiance is reeking with glam and elegance. I like that the hip music was not too loud that you still get to chat with your friends without having to shout. Service was Top Notch. Our waited knows the cocktails and what to recommend to each one of us. He asks what kind of taste we prefer and recommends what suits us- which it really did. Cocktails are very good and exciting. Pictures cannot do justice to the beauty of this bar.
Doctors‚Äô night out!,"We celebrated the 50th birthday of my friend. All of us 9 are doctors and are so looking forward to this night out. We would like to know whether the hype for this place is true. The building where Atlas bar is situated used to stand out back in 2004 and looked like one of the buildings in Gotham City but now it‚Äôs surrounded by new structures. The building alone is impressive, the exterior has all this old world vibe and once inside the interior gives you a Grand Central Terminal in New York vibe. The ceiling, the walls, sculptures, dining hall transported you to a new world. There‚Äôs a spiral staircase that leads one to a loft with tables and sofa chairs but it‚Äôs not for dining but a space to give the guests photo opportunities as the loft gives you a 360 degees view of the whole place and it‚Äôs very impressive. Kudos to resto that they have this as it‚Äôs a plus points for guests to come over. Our main wait staff is Alex and he is very amicable and attentive and even assisted us in taking our pictures. He gave good recommendations regarding what champagne - He brought us Brut , and helped us to surprise our friend with a cake ( part of the dessert) but they put the HBD wordings on it. The food is delicious ! we all had the steak frites sirloin and tendeloin, one of us had the pork collar, pancetta jus, sweetheart cabbage, one had panroasted chlean sea bass, lemon beuerre blanc and we had extra 3 lobster roll and we ordered the whole menu of dessert- creme brulee, eton mess ( love this) pineaplle granita, the Madeleines and my friend‚Äôs bday cake is the chocolate and salted caramel tart. We had the caviar oscietra with all the condiments and blinis and few rustic bread with truffle butter but we asked for some balsamic vinegar as well. We gave our friend the Lladro Japanese woman as gift and made him open it then and there,oh boy does he loved it! We all had a good time, indeed as the Irish proverb goes‚Äù Laughter is brightest where food is best‚Äù I‚Äôll add into that with good company in this good place like Atlas where good food abound is likely the best there is."
Average,The ambience is amazing but the gin cocktails were nothing to boast about. We also ordered the regular g&t but it was too much tonic and not enough gin. Would not visit again.
Best Martini‚Äôs üç∏,The Atlas Bar is honestly the nicest bar I have ever been too! The service was excellent and the food and drinks were impeccable. The three petite martini‚Äôs were amazing!!
Must try out,"Such a grand lobby and bar that has the largest gin collection around. Located in the historic Bugis neighborhood, you must try this place out. The architecture is inspired by Art Deco skyscrapers of Europe. I went in the afternoon to try their high tea experience. Sweet and savory items were available. Service was top notch. Glad I went."
Wedding Reception Review of Atlas Bar,"Attended my friend's wedding yesterday. The bar provided 2 wireless mics to the couple. Both mics turned itself off automatically every 1 to 3 minutes or at times within seconds. It happened at least over 10 times during the wedding speech. What's appalling is nobody from the bar offered any form of assistance. When we approached their staff, they simply replied ""We've only got 2 mics"" and that's it. Service is non-existence. They simply don't care about the multiple disruptions of the poor couple's wedding speech. There's this lady with many tattoos, who is supposed to be the couple's co-ordinator, who doesn't seem to appear or care when we needed her help. For couples who planned to hold your wedding reception here, you've been warned. You can easily get better service elsewhere for less than the price you pay here."
Cocktail Heaven!!,This is a must do place when coming to Singapore!! Love love loved it. The service was second to none. Can‚Äôt wait to visit again!! The cocktails are outstanding and the building is beyond beautiful.
NYC Art Deco style Bar,"interesting and hip bar. Reminds you of NYC in the 60's. Price is so reasonable for a bar this caliber. Food is delicious, drink is beautifully presented. Music is choosen tastefully. Place so pack at any day you need to reserve your place first."
A must go in Singapore,"It is a jaw dropping piece of art deco architecture which brings a Great Gatsby vibe. Beautiful!

The menu includes some classic French dishes like the escargot bourguignon that is smartly served with a slice of bread so you can savour every little bit of the delicious escargot butter. One of the best I have ever tried.

The pork neck was cooked to perfection: crispy and juicy. Delicious!

The service is very friendly and efficient.

Do not miss it when in Singapore."
Hospitality non existent,"Poor hospitality!

I sat down with my friends and we started taking photos as it's my first patronage at this so-called established restaurant. However not long after being engrossed with photo taking, I was approached by one of the staff if we are ready to place an order when it seems that we were obviously still taking pictures. She did not even offer to help us take a picture knowing that we are taking pictures.

The gesture portrayed that she was impatient that we are taking photos and we had not ordered anything yet. My friend and I did not feel good at all being approached that way. It was an Indian lady in a black dress.

Ultimately, I felt that it‚Äôs absolutely not pleasant to ‚Äòrush‚Äô us to start ordering and did not offer to help take pictures? I did not patronise a restaurant having to be treated badly by your staff. I hope the management will look into the review to improve better on the service provided by your staffs.

Stunning bar with absolutely no customer service!

Will not visit again"
Yes Yes Yes Yes,One of the best cocktail Bars I've ever been to. The cocktail list and spirit selections are impressive enough but the building itself and the bar area are breathtaking and honestly even if they just served tepid water they'd stirred with their fingers I'd still go just to take in the view.
Dining in gatsby style,"The bar is nicely decorated. U would feel like being in the 1920s in US.
They have a full menu with gin worth trying

Their food is exceptionally good as well.
Dessert comparatively is mediocre.

It‚Äôs quite popular .
Better book at least three weeks ahead."
WOW! A visit to this bar was the highlight of our trip to Singapore.,Atlas is a special place. From the exterior of the building to the beautiful interior to the food and drinks to the service.
Fancy,"Stopped by here after hearing about the great gin case. Very pretty place. Floor to ceiling art. It‚Äôs a visual feast.

I ordered the sample martinis and I liked the espresso ones. It‚Äôs pricey but good.

Please note that you need to wear pants after a certain time. They won‚Äôt let shorts go.

Very fancy. I wish we were able to do the afternoon tea. It looked delicious.

Overall, a very fancy place to have a drink."
"Lacked service, mediocre food","Had gotten the afternoon tea reservation date wrong, and that is on me. What was appalling is Atlas‚Äôs management of the situation - blind application of cancellation policy without allowing change of date and non-existent service. The manager who spoke to me had a cold attitude, and she repeatedly sought confirmation to charge my credit card (why ask when it is something they were going to do regardless).

In contrast with the efficiency in charging my card, i was left hanging without updates on the delivery of food for nearly 2 hours. Calls to both their landline and mobile were unanswered. When the food finally came, what you see (included photo) is what you get - mediocre food.

For the price, there are certainly other better places in Singapore to go to."
"Disappointing and unfriendly, dress code liberally interpreted","We went there twice this evening, at 18:30 and later at 21:30. The first time the hosts proposed us to come back later as we did not have reservations. No other comments made.
The second time we were dismissed because I had open shoes with long Max Mara dress. Open shoes were visible and that was enough said.
Well, if those prostitute-looking girls who were trying to pick up guys by the bar and the rest of the sneaker community is your go-to clients, that is you choice.
For the rest of us mortals-avoid this one. There are plenty of other places in Singapore to have your cocktail."
HOSPITALITY NEEDS IMPROVEMENT,"I had an unfortunate experience dining at Atlas for the first time. It was our anniversary last night & we were looking forward to dining at this beautiful restaurant as my husband had to book a table at least 2 months in advance.

Service was attentive, food was fantastic.. however our entire night was spoiled when I was told off by one of the staff that the ONE photo I was trying to take of my husband was in her words ""spoiling the ambience"" & that there is a ""no flash photography"" rule.

It is so dimly lit that in order to read the menu or take food photos (as I normally do for special occasions & to share on instagram), you would need to use your phone's torch light. Now if I was taking photos non-stop and being completely inconsiderate to other diners her warnings would have merit - but nobody was complaining. It was SO unnecessary. It was ONE photo & before I could even take it, she jumped in to tell me to stop. (Also I was using a second phone's light NOT flash to take this photo)

Additionally, when we first walked in we were told that there is a 2 hour time limit to dine... this is extremely off-putting. If you do not have another reservation after us, there is NO NEED to tell your diners that their time is limited especially when there was a note in our reservation that we were there to celebrate our anniversary.

Our reservation was for 7.30pm and the kitchen takes last orders for food at 9.30pm... WHY is it necessary then to tell us that we have to eat and go? Who is coming to take our table at 9.30pm when the kitchen closes at that time and there are plenty of other spots for walk-ins to drink at the bar???

If someone is hogging the table and not ordering food and alcohol, then that 's understandable or if there was indeed a second booking then it would be necessary to inform your diners of this policy.

It is a HUGE shame that this gorgeous establishment with legitimately great cocktails, amazing food & otherwise attentive service has FAILED in making their diners feel WELCOMED.

That is the WHOLE point of hospitality.

There are plenty of other restaurants with good food, ambience, service and drinks especially at the price point that Atlas has positioned itself. Hospitality is really the only thing that sets one restaurant apart from another & would make diners want to return.

Last night was the perfect opportunity for us to make good memories at your restaurant as it was our anniversary and we enjoy revisiting places for nostalgic reasons.. but I will NEVER come back as these two issues have left a sour taste in my mouth.

You should be honoured that diners would want to take photos to commemorate a special occasion or to post food photos on instagram. Not tell them off for doing so.

And your staff should be able to use discernment & make good judgement calls instead of just regurgitating restaurant policies for NO RELEVANT REASON except to convey to your diners that they are not exactly welcomed.

I appreciate that your manager on duty handled the matter with patience and understanding and even offered us 2 complimentary glasses of champagne on top of an anniversary dessert. But these two issues should have NEVER even been an issue in the first place. I have taken countless photos at other restaurants & was never told it was ""spoiling the ambience"".

So unnecessary.

Very baffled and disappointed."
Impressive interior but that's all about,"Service was really terrible, had to wait at the door few mins until receptionist showed up from previous guest. Asked to be standing or seated at the bar since I was alone but they were apparently full as per receptionist so didn't even allow me to stand at the bar. Sat at the table but took easy 6-7 minutes to take attention and receive the menu. Had only one drink since I was barely served and then left."
We were disapointed,We went back post COVID to emulate previous enjoyable visits and we were looking forward to our time at Altas. We have shared our experiences with friends who have subsequently been to Atlas as well and enjoyed their time there. We hadn't made a booking and were instructed at reception where we made a booking at 4;20 pm that Birkenstocks were not allowed after 5pm and that our slot would be after the 5:00 pm cut off . We are in our 60's and should have mentioned plantar fasciitis that my wife has that requires her to wear certain shoes but we didn't. Instead we complied and went back to our hotel for a shoe change. However after arriving back several of the younger people presenting to Atlas after us had sneakers on that are apparently OK and we felt that their policy was inconsistent. In essence we don't think that we are the right segment of the market that Altas is after. We felt that we had been dealt with differently to other people who were there.
Memorable experience in stunning venue,"Atlas is in Parkview Square which is inspired by the art deco skyscrapers in New York and Europe. Atlas is located right in the centre of the lobby and it is absolutely spectacular, with a massive gin tower taking centre stage in the restaurant. The food is Eurocentric and it was superb. It was a great dining experience for the atmosphere, service, food and massive list of gin cocktails. A truly memorable dining experience!

Ive read some of the other reviews saying they didn't know about the dress code however it is noted on the website and if you book, in your confirmation email. I do actually think if you are going to a high end venue like this you should make an effort, which you can still do for Singapore weather. Also all the staff we encountered were friendly helpful and very nice."
Don‚Äôt expect too much‚Ä¶.and you won‚Äôt be disappointed,"I‚Äôve voting ‚Äúaverage‚Äù as everything about our experience was a 50:50 split.

The venue was fabulous, but the food was poor. The drinks were fantastic, but the music was out of place. The staff were friendly, but other guests were underdressed.

The venue is fantastic. It‚Äôs ornate, beautiful and the perfect 1920‚Äôs escape for an afternoon or evening of dinner and drinks.

However, the food snacks we had were really not up to scratch: mushrooms on toast were cold, croque monsieur was not cooked through, and the sardines on toast were bland.

The drinks were all superb. Well made and priced accordingly to the venue. You could go all out here and have the elixir of beverages‚Ä¶ or equally play safe with confidence. We did a bit of both!! And it was worth it.

However, the music playlist for the venue is very odd. The choice of music did not match the venue, the vibe nor the energy of the room - at all. There were fast tracks, loud vocal tracks‚Ä¶.all stuff you would never hear in the 1920‚Äôs. I know it‚Äôs a petty and small point‚Ä¶but it became a topic of conversation for us a few times. The wrong music can really spoil a venue.

Everyone who served us, were A-1. We didn‚Äôt get any vibe of arrogance at all. In fact, the opposite. Everyone was kind, welcoming and attentive.

My biggest complaint however, is the lack of compliance to the dress code.

Website says (for gents), long trousers and closed shoes.

I‚Äôm totally fine with that. And totally respect it.

So much so, our Saturday before ATLAS was planned so that we finished our day activities early, travelled back across the city, got dressed for ATLAS according in long pants and shoes, and then traveled back across the city to join ATLAS.

Only to find when we got there, that many of the gents were wearing shorts, cargo shorts, sports caps, and open sandals. Literally, like they just walked in from being around the pool.

One lady was in her full gym gear. Literally straight from the gym. How do I know??? Because she was sat at the table next to me..and told me.

I‚Äôm fine with casual wear in a bar‚Ä¶.but not when a venue proclaims to have dress standards, which we invested time and effort to meet, only then to be obviously not enforced.

ATLAS is good. You should go for the experience of the venue, the service from the team, and the drinks. Just don‚Äôt expect too much, and then you won‚Äôt be disappointed."

The receptionists were arrogant and not hospitable. I was denied entry to the restaurant when I wore high-end recovery sandals, and although they said it was written in the confirmation email, it was nowhere to be found even after reviewing it with the receptionist. The reservation system was also poorly designed with poor UI design and that warning was written in a place where I didn't notice it. She told me to buy sandals because the boutique stores around Bugis are open until 10pm.
They allow vulgar couples flirting on their knees...
The atmosphere was amazing, but the receptionist was very arrogant. I would have preferred to go to long bar or jigger and pony."
"Beautiful dining experience, let down by half the staffs attitude.","Attended a Sunday afternoon cocktail brunch with a friend. Food and cocktails were amazing! A beautiful and very tasty nibbles board with dips, cheese, meats, crackers, fruits and more.
Cocktails were also delightful, a nice choice and very complementary to the nibbles board.
There was also the choice of upgrading to champagne.
The service however was mixed. Half the staff were attentive and warm, the other half made it very clear they wanted you to eat and leave. When the time was up for our brunch, we were the only table ushered to pay and move, and yet when we asked to finish the drink at the bar and purchase one more, we were reluctantly shown a table in the corner and no option for a drink - not even water!!
The offering was wonderful, the staff let it down. Having dined all over Singapore, this was definitely some of the most stuck up staff I‚Äôve experienced unfortunately. Even the cashier came across as hostile. Such a shame."
Relax with wife after a week rumours,"Great place with good location , wife Natalie had crave for cocktail , this will be the best place with cool drinks ~~~~~~"
Very good environment,"We went for a drink with some food. Thee evironment is very good, nice art deco architecture , imponent high ceiling. It is better to do a reservation and note the dress code. It is not a place to go in bermudas or slings...it ruins the atmosphere of the place.Dress business casual at least...We tried the octopus , the wagyu and the drinks.Very good, an unusual experience in Singapore."
Art and architecture wow!,"Stopped here on a Hawker food tour for a bathroom break and look at the architecture. Amazing to look at, were tons lots on influences like to post photos from here. Amazing sculptures and artwork around building's facade. Was told locals call this Gotham City and I can see why! Didn't stop for food or beverages so can't comment on that."
Nice and fabulous place :),This bar is settled in the park view square building. The design is fabulous as well as the service I have received from all the staffs. They are very nice and helpful. The signature cocktail are a must try. I got sun gate spritz that day and it was very refreshing. They have various kind and rank of drink to choose from. Overall very impressive. The reservation is advisable as the place is always full.
Unannounced dress code ruined my evening,"Beautiful place almost too ornate. I walked half an hour through 30 degree et heat to have d arink, only to be told fairly rudely that there is a dress code after five ¬¥, no shorts, no slippers. So turned a way and had dinner on the street instead,

Dress codes are fine, but they need to be clearly posted announced (the website, but also in the bar). And I honestly do not quite understand why they insist men wear long pants in sweltering heat. We are not in Knightsbridge.

Future customers, beware!"
Stunning experience!,"Struggled to get a booking during our trip but managed to snag a lunch time drinks sitting, well worth it.
The bar is absolutely beautiful and the staff serviced matched. Drinks were nice but very limited actual liquid compared to price. The food we tried was great."
Drinks in Gotham,"This bar is located in a business district building which simply has to be seen to be believed and enjoyed. It's Art Deco mixed with a bit of Egyptian but it works. The soaring ceilings are supported by massive columns and the whole room, the width of the whole building, is ornate, over the top and gorgeous. People DRESS to come here and there are NO children. It's just not that kind of bar. This is purely for adults, well-heeled, cultured adults. The drinks list is gin heavy (pages and pages of the stuff) but there are other concoctions equally enjoyable for the non-gin lovers.
The ""Gotham' reference? The outside of the building looks like Batman's haunt. And just adds to the ambiance of the whole experience of walking through that magical entrance."
Just Amazing,"This place has a wonderful ambiance and amazing customer service. We were served by Yazid and he was very friendly and polite. Their food options are great, and the food fresh and delicious. They also have the best Espresso Martini"
Great cocktails in an amazing setting,"Booked a table for cocktails while visiting family in Singapore after seeing it was listed as one of the top 5 bars in the world and we weren‚Äôt disappointed! The building is stunning and the decor in the bar is amazing, luckily the cocktails lived up to the setting and the hype. Loved this place, quite an experience and will definitely visit again."
Art deco and gin lover's paradise,"Beautiful art deco setting. Amazing list of gins. Bar snacks very tasty!
We didn't have a reservation but only had to wait about 15 mins on a Saturday afternoon and were then welcome to stay as long as we wanted.
A definite highlight of our trip."
BEST BAR IN SINGAPORE,"A MUST VISIT BAR IN SINGAPORE
Beautiful modern art decor in a luxurious setting
Fantastic decorations, great vibes, beautiful selection of gin & tonic
Alcohol and bar loves must come to this bar whenever you are in Singapore because you will feel that you are not in Singapore but in Rome because of the lively on decor architect which is simply classic and beautiful"
Back in the library of Gin..Lovely,"Pre-booked (would recommend) and arrived to be shown to our lovely table. Staff were very attentive, and keen to give tips from the menu, although these were more which were the most popular dishes rather than what the server thought tasted good which was an interesting take on recommendations. The interior is as dramatic as we remembered - really stunning building. Food goo, and service was very good. We had the grilled octopus and white anchovies as a starter - I did want to order the oysters, but were only told these were not available after I had selected rather than when we were given the menu. Lobster roll was the main course - which was not as good as that we had in Central Station, but was tasty. All in all great atmosphere, with good food."
Excellent lounge bar,"Excellent bar with huge selection of Gin. Food is slightly on the pricey side, but the atmosphere makes our trip worthwhile."
LOVED!!,Excellent! Room gorgeous. Cocktails amazing. I started with the atlas martini. Loved. Also tried the Tamara in a green Bugatti - too sweet for me but still a very good drink. I ordered the Chilean sea bass which was perfection. And then the chocolate salted caramel tart. Also yummy. Must go in Singapore!
Will definitely go back!,"I recently paid a visit to Atlas bar to meet a couple of friends for dinner. Knowing this was one of the best (if not the best) bar in Asia, my experience, needless to say, was magical. From the food to the decor, everything screamed grandeur.

But the aspect that stood out most to me, and tied everything together, was the excellent hospitality provided by Atlas‚Äô hosts. I usually don‚Äôt write such reviews but this time I couldn‚Äôt help doing so. My host, Ryan, made my friends and I feel incredibly welcome and comfortable. He was great at listening and carrying conversations and also knew the appropriate times to talk to us and to give us space. I was also very impressed by how he gave us extremely astute recommendations for our food and beverages based on our likes and dislikes (which were relatively broad).

For those wondering whether to dine at Atlas, I would definitely return to Atlas again; the experience was that good. And if all the hosts are as hospitable as Ryan, what more could you ask for?"
No regrets,"I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd bother with western food while I was in Singapore but my friend convinced me otherwise and I am so glad she did!

Service was very attentive, food was out of this world. I highly recommend the burrata, and the streak frite."
Beautiful place!! Amazing service!!,"Visited this highly raved place and it sure did not disappoint! Ambience and food were a 11/10 but what really sealed the deal was the amazing service by the staff!! I visited a month back with some friends and sat at the bar. Till date, I still remember fondly of the warm and hospitable service by Ryan. Throughout the night, Ryan took great care of us. He walked us through the menu and gave some splendid food and drinks recommendations. Whenever he had pockets of time, he would check in on us and struck up conversations that made us feel at home and welcomed. And not to forget, he makes a mean cup of coffee, topped off with a beautiful latte art!

I‚Äôm already making plans to bring more company back for round 2,3,4,5‚Ä¶ Definitely would love to be under the care of Ryan again. Can safely say that he made the Atlas experience two-folds better!"
"Amazing service from the bar, as usual","This is the second time that I have visited Atlas with my group of friends just for a simple catch up. The night was ordinary, but the ambience was amazing. We sat at the bar counter, where we were served amazingly by Ryan, once again! I visited in around August in 2019 (I believe I wrote a review back then as well) and I sang high praises about Ryan. I'm glad that he's still such a valuable asset with Atlas and his service was impeccable, as per the previous time.

Definitely will be back, and I sincerely hope to get Ryan as our bartender again, for the third time!"
Decent Bar,"Was there for a birthday celebration for a friend. It was our first time at a bar. Ordered a few drinks and when the drinks came, there was a slice of chocolate on top of it. The staff who served it did not explain to me what was I supposed to do with the chocolate. When I checked with another staff, a caucasian, he seemed very impatient and told me that I was supposed to bite a mouthful of the chocolate after drinking my cocktail. The chocolate was alr melting when it was served and I couldn't even hold it up..

Everything was bad until a staff by the name Ryan attended to us. He recommended several drinks when we wanted something different for my friend's birthday. He also shared some photo spots of the place with us and kindly helped us take some pictures too! At the end of our night, he also surprised us with something small for my friend's birthday. Overall, my experience at Atlas was so different until Ryan appeared. Ryan was really passionate about his work and constantly share with us information about the place and the drinks they serve. I hope the organisation will commend him for his work and improve the service quality of the other staff who attended to me."
Amazing Night,"I saw many pictures about this bar and decided to give it a shot for a night of cocktails and was very pleased with the service and drinks. The staff was very welcoming and our server, Ryan was a warm energy that enhanced the overall night. He also did put in the effort to ensure the night was enjoyable and service was impeccable especially with him answering our questions about the architecture.

The prices here are reasonable considering the extravagant venue and in fact comparable to other mid range bars."
Feeling disgusted.,"Reception take my number and mentioned she will call us after half an hour so we wait outside.

There are few groups of people left the bar but we are not called or invited to be seated inside. We had no choice to go up to the counter after 40 mins wait and she said actually we can go in AUTOMATICALLY after half an hour.

We are not happy with this attitude & response. When we query her why take my number if you ""in case got anything happen can call you, like lost and found"".

Do people want to give their number just to wait people call them when they lost something ? Isn't it first thing should be an invitation to seat inside?

I am absolutely disgusted with the service you are not providing."
Amazing bar,"Watched Westworld and I had to give ATLAS a shot. ATLAS did not disappoint. Service, food and atmosphere were great. We ordered oysters, the ATLAS G&T, smoked pork loin and sea bass. Liyana was extremely friendly and welcoming. Shoutout to the Filipino food server who gave excellent and clear explanations of the food. (Think his name was Brian). Classy and professional; 5-star service from him. Would definitely visit again!"
Come for the venue (once) & not the service,"We had a couple of nice martinis which were presented in beautiful Waterford crystal glasses. It‚Äôs an interesting faux 1930s decor reminiscent of something I imagine the leader would live in, in Pyongyang or the home of a bad guy in a Batman movie.

Very ordinary service however. Too busy at their little desk to even bother acknowledging you when you walk in or left. Slow to take orders and done with no heart. It‚Äôs a pity because I was really hoping this place lived up to the hype. In the end I think it‚Äôs just a gimmick and I wouldn‚Äôt bother going again."
"Gorgeous place, good drinks but underwhelmed by the food",Was disappointed with the lobster roll. The portion of the lobster was small and it wasn‚Äôt as fresh as I would like it. I would come back again for drinks but not for the food.
Lovely Afternoon Tea,Wanted to do something special and decided to have afternoon tea. Enjoyed leisurely ‚Äì lavish environment and seating is spread out. Service is attentive and friendly. Thank you Irfan for amazing host. Will come back for lunch and dinner.
Wonderful experience,"Wonderful food and a wide selection of drinks. Many may come here for the atmosphere, but the service definitely tops that. Props to Mel for the attentive service"
What a gorgeous place!,"Finally decided to visit ATLAS, seeing as that it's one of the top bars in the world, with that famous gin tower.

We arrived on the day of my reservation, and I'm immediately wowed by how gorgeous this place is! The thick carpeted ground, the plush furniture, the muted golden lights and that Gotham-vibed furnishings. It is, by Singapore standards, rather opulent.

Service was impeccable, the wait staff are almost always around, and are knowledgeable about their food menu, although I must admit the food menu isn't all that extensive anyway. The steak and sea bass which my friend and I had, were all very good and satisfactory, and the hot starter of mushrooms on toast was a true explosion of flavors on the tongue -- a must-have for a mushroom lover (like me)! The tiramisu is actually a deconstructed version of the dessert we are used to, as was kindly highlighted to us when we ordered it. Still, it was a very enjoyable dessert.

Drinks-wise, another must-have here, the ATLAS 3 Petite Martini Flight Suite, which is a downsized version of all 3 of ATLAS' classic martinis. It was really good, definitely worth it!

Both my friend and I really enjoyed our time and experience here. It was so comfortable and we were well-fed -- both in food and in drinks. Highly recommended."
We'll be back !!!,"Cozy ambience. Interesting decor. Great place to unwind and catchup with friends.
However, service need to be improved."
The coolest Bar in Singapore,"I went there with a couple of friends. Honestly, I'm not a fan of gin, but Atlas Bar has this espresso + gin drink that certainly on top of my list now. The waiter will help you define what kind of drink that would be the best for your preference. It's a pity we couldn't take a picture on the second floor cos they had one event when i went there. but definitely will come back again! cheers!"
Rude and stressed out staff!,"Atmosphere nice, though a little contrived for me.

Service on this night was utterly appalling, and definitely did not meet our expectations!

On arrival We encountered two head of house girls in the middle of an argument. This went on for some time before one of them looked up and snapped Yes! ! No pleasantries were offered, a menu was literally thrown in front of us when one of them reluctantly took us to our table. We then waited a further 25 minutes for service, and were then given two two cocktails we did not order!

Said staff were apologetic when I spoke with them regarding the incident, but the damage to our evening had been done sadly.

We have since found much better service when stepping out for a drink or two, and will definitely not return to the Atlas!"
Bad service,"Generally nice place food OK. Before we were sitter on the assign seat we have told the host that we wanted to change table. It was noted but subsequently there were 2 empty table which have been left vacant for 20 mins. We where told it's not available. Then they promise to move us to anothet table but someone who came after us were the table before us and was told that they requested first.

How could someone who came after us and food was serve after us be requesting to change table before us. Totally disappointed with the service."
Saturday Brunch at ATLAS Bar.,"Saturday Brunch at ATLAS. Last chance until at least June 14. Thank you Annabelle, Loki, Gary, Sylvia, Lauren & Lionel for a great afternoon! #atlasbarsg"
Amazing assortment of Gin,Definitely one of the best bar in the world. The ambiance is just amazing. Photos does not justice to the amazing feel of the establishment. The assortment of Gin is just amazing. Lovely place to be in! But you have to book three months in advance to secure the booking!
Cosy beautiful dining place,"Cosy beautiful dining place. Try whisky, lobster ü¶û and fries üçü ... great experience, enjoyed good services from all crews . I will visit this place again . Keep it up üëçüèª"
A Big Disappointment for my first visit.,"Was there with my husband and another friend. We spent almost $1k for 3 persons and it was a disappointment, it would be our first and last time visit there probably.

Heard they had the largest collection of gin in the world so we gotta try it. My husband and I are not a big fan of gin so we can‚Äôt do it‚Äôs justice, but our friend said that the gin is good.

We also had 2 bottles of red wine from Australia. It‚Äôs good but PRICEY.

Main dishes were horrible. We ordered 200g steak, 300g steak and the pork dish, all not good. The steak was not hot and it‚Äôs too fatty. Not enough flavoring. Luckily the dessert is good.

In terms of service, it has to be much better. It was just too casual and for many times, we had to try a few times to get staffs attention. For the price we paid and for its name to be one of the top bar in the world, I would expect much better and professional service but the night was a total let down.

All in all, the atmosphere and deco of the place is good. Insta-worthy place but don‚Äôt expect anything more."
"Great ambience, attentive service, pretty high tea","Lovely ambience, really just stunning PLUSH interiors with lots of natural lighting in the afternoon pouring in.

The staff are super attentive and friendly and came to remind us to make our second order for the tea/coffee for our high tea as we were busy chatting away.

The high tea set was really expensive but it did offer a good variety of items with better quality ingredients and we couldn't even finish it all, as it was really ALOT of food.

Would love to go back for drinks at night to enjoy the different atmosphere."
Lovely ambience,"Lovely ambience - really beautiful decor. The service is quite good - they are patient in explaining the drinks and always refilling our water. Their food menu is quite limited - will be better if they can expand it. It isn't a cheap place but really good place for chilling with friends.
Have to reserve early as it gets booked out pretty fast."
Incredible night out with top notch service!,"My friend and I went to the Atlas Bar for the first time last night, and we had the most impeccable service from Wan (Ridzuan) as well as the two bartenders Gary and Justin and our dinner waiter Jeff. Wan was meticulous, very learned about the bar, history and Art Deco background, and kept coming to make sure we were fine throughout the night. Justin and Gary were incredibly engaging despite the many customers they had, and educated us so much about drinks, mixology and were just mad fun to talk to. Jeff was always quietly attentive, ever ready to help with anything we needed. We ended up having dinner, dessert and if I recall correctly, about 10 martinis / cocktails between us. Such an amazing team and location, I wonder why I hadn't been there earlier! Thank you guys!"
Will be back for desserts and drinks,"Reading earlier reviews, I was hesitant to come here for dinner with husband to celebrate our anniversary together. I'm really glad to say that we really had a good experience there.

Our server Jeff, was professional, very helpful and amazingly attentive. We found ourselves hydrating better (!!) because he would fill up our cups whenever he sees it less than half full. He was also patient with explaining the menu, informed us when our food was very slightly delayed, and helped changed out a unsatisfactory dish. For the service, the ambience, I would definitely come back again.

As for the food, it really did not live up to everything else. I was looking forward to the risotto, but was awfully salty. We also had many other dishes, but the only one that really stood out was the hot appetiser, Croque Monsieur (A really good ham and cheese toast).

Though the food was a little disappointing, but we can see ourselves coming back to try the desserts and drinks. It'll also make a good hangout with friends in the middle of town. If nothing else, the service is great and decor mesmerising.

Thank you Jeff"
"Amazing decor, but consistently poor service. Be ‚Äúamazed‚Äù","Second visit after a year. Reservation went well, with good follow-up from them before the actual time of visit. So i actually thought things have changed.

Amazing decor, lovely ambience and good selection of drinks. Food selection could be limited, but it‚Äôs ok, since you ought to be there for not more than two to three hours anyway.

The team of staff continued to disappoint, second time in a row. We arrived at 515pm. At 550pm, the staff started to hurry hurry us to order our mains, since we had to leave by 745pm for the next guests at 8pm. Ok at 6pm, we already had two items from the grazing menu and three drinks on the table. Initially we thought it was a thoughtful gesture, maybe to make sure we had enough time to eat! Then at 7pm, they came repeatedly, stating it‚Äôs the last order for drinks, as we needed to leave at 730pm. Our glasses (our 2nd and third drink) were still full, there‚Äôs no way to order more then, i stated. Then the staff claimed, i am not forcing you guys to order. Errr.. whatever that meant?!!

Asked a male staff walking past for help to place further order, and he replied, while walking away, ‚Äúyou ask her‚Äù, pointing us to the lady behind. I guessed he‚Äôs a bartender, and he does not take order directly. ‚ÄúLousy us‚Äù for not spotting it right!!

Finally, the staff who brought the bill, wrongly addressed me as sir, when i am clearly not a man. My partner immediately and clearly pointed it out to her. No apology from the staff. And strangely when she returned with the bill to sign, she read out my name in full aloud, asking me if the name is correct?!! Whatever that is for, but she sure looked very satisfied that she read my name out, without further addressing me ms, mrs or mdm, of course. I really wonder if they know what they are doing.

It was for my partner‚Äôs birthday celebration. They knew about it, as stated in my reservation, as they communicated with me in the morning, to note that they are aware of the celebration, and asked if they need to prepare anything more. And of course it was stated in the reservation, i am not a sir too.

An absolute total disappointment. They were totally not interested in making sure the guests have an enjoyable time with Atlas. Perhaps they believe that the decor and ambience will do it all, what more should we ask for?!! At times, its ok that mistakes are made. We are humans. But it is important to address the mistakes and not pretend nothing happened.

Oh did i mention, the security guard at the lift lobby was consistently great? Twice in a row now, the guard was warm and welcoming, greeting us and making sure we didn‚Äôt get lost.

Be there to enjoy the view. Experience? Be prepared to be ‚Äúamazed‚Äù."
Back to Atlas!,"Back to Atlas after many months due to global pandemic.. drinks quality & presentation remained at the top rank and service level has improved since my last visit (2bubbles ranks)

Arrival experience was a good one. We were seated upon arrival without any wait. Service was promptly offered upon seated and drinks order was taken after several minutes. No introduction of the menu and no recommendation by the staff. As a frequent traveller, introduction of the menu will definitely significantly improve the overall experience for your diners.

Keep it up and stay on the same service level.. don‚Äôt drop it."
After meal service is disappointing.,"After meal service is disappointing.
We waited patiently as whilst we were early arriving we were delayed with our first drinks by >30 mins. That said our initial waitress was excellent. Food was exceptional. But but by the time our first drinks and order came it was only 1 hr before the staff changed shifts. On this change we were asked (holding up the menu) if we would like to order anything else. However when we asked for 1 last coffee & a Gin drink we were told abruptly no, but can go ask..... WTF. Our table still hadn‚Äôt been cleared with our empty plates from desert.
We were then told we could have 15 min extension but would need to leave. So we didn‚Äôt bother due to the fact it took 30 min for our initial drinks & attitude of the staff.
The change of waitress had no empathy to our early experience. Totally ruined the moment with the bill put on our table not last drinks. Not offered anywhere else to enjoy our last drink. Just we could come back again.....
Disappointing to top off a great lunch
Lesson for Atlas: don‚Äôt switch waitress at end of shift as the don‚Äôt care about previously seated customers....
Greenwood‚Äôs & Artemis after meal service much better. Go enjoy for yourself and see for yourself."
Gorgeous !!,You are probably so busy admiring the decor of this place that you forget to taste the food. Having said that the lobster roll that we had was excellent ! You can‚Äôt go wrong bringing a visitor here or anyone for a special treat . The decor is just over the top beautiful. Gorgeous.
That Gotham Building.,"That Gotham Building.

Inside, there‚Äôs this beautiful place!

Service was okay, minimal interaction. When seated was asked if we wanted still or sparkling.

Table water are $2 per person.

Food menu was in minimal , they only serve full menu after high tea has finished.

But yes , atmosphere is like stepping to another world."
Excellent service excellent food twice as nice,"Two days for promotion celebration. Loved every dish. The cauliflower. The mushroom dish. And the cheese board. Loved the risotto with charred corn. Delish. Drinks are amazing too.

Service wise excellent. To mention a few. Kai and Faz the first night. Very good service from even junior staff. 2nd night was Abby and Kai. Very good combination us.

We saw the recent negative review and after some investigative questioning we learned that the reviewers had booked two tables and were not complying with the Circuit breaker rules when mixing between tables and so on. The restaurant can be a risk of getting closed or fined is caught allowing guests. Sadly the staff Were accused of unfairness.

Anyways. Love this place. Booking for weekend nights have 1-2 months waiting. So I booked already for Feb."
Manager unprofessional services,"A very turned-off BIRTHDAY celebration!

Very coincidence we bumped into 1 our friend were also dining there at ALTAS BAR. But due to the light of COVID-19 of the maximum group of 5, (we are absolutely educated and understand the RULE OF 5!!!) when my friend's table was >5 metres away from us took a far wefie towards our table direction.. This rude manager named ""Abby"" came over with super unprofessional and harsh attitude giving to both of us a super rude warning to say we are not allowed to intermingle with another table!

HELLO ABBY, DO YOU NEED A MEASUREMENTS TAPE? OR ARE YOU Blind OR TRYING TO EMPOWER YOUR MANAGER POWER? WE DID NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO EVEN GO NEAR THEIR TABLE AT ALL! DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF SOCIAL DISTANCING AT ALL? YOU NEED TO IMPROVE YOUR ATTITUDE AND THE WAY YOU SPEAK!

Until I browse through the review in Google... Seriously this beautiful place need mannerisms proper staff and manger training.. I M NOT ALONE TO EXPERIENCE THIS.

ALSO.. For those who plan to come ATLAS, walk in is quite easy to get table. No need to put deposit for credit card for 3 mths down the road for reservations too.

FOOD 7/10, SERVICE 2/10 (2 POINTS is meant for the person that managed to bring forward our desire reservation date)"
Terrible service and experience!!!,Nice ambience but very disappointed with their service. The manager on duty named Abbey is rude and the word she used to talk to a customer is harsh and embarrassed. Really cannot imagine such a great restaurant provide such kind of service. I believe there should be better way to explain to a customer if something is prohibited. We think that such great restaurant supposed to have a well trained service manager. NOT Dare To Visit Again!! And will not recommend to any friend.
The most elegant designed dining + bar in town!,"First time went to Atlas, we walked in early evening on monday, quite full house..
but luckily we manage to get seats.

I don‚Äôt drink alcohol cos I was driving,
so we ordered ‚ÄúKey in hand‚Äù (it‚Äôs an OK drink)...
And ‚Äúsummer in Paris‚Äù (Love this!),
For foods we ordered beef short ribs, excellent!
It‚Äôs very tender and juicy, everything all in the right taste balance..
we ordered the mocha latte after dinner too, good coffee..

Great service!, the place is really beautifully designed, great drinks and excellent foods!
It‚Äôs a perfect place to spend an evening with friends or family...

Looking forward to come again soon!

Cheers,
E.S."
Gotham-City looking building,"This ‚ÄúGotham-City‚Äù looking building has been a hidden gem housing the previous ‚ÄúDivine Bar‚Äù, which appears to have switched hands to the now ATLAS Bar, that still boasts the same cool vibes but now also offers increased dining options beyond drinks with an extended menu and large long sofa chairs and tables now. Still crowded as ever, we were lucky to grab a standing table and then a small seated space after dinner, for some post-dinner drinks."
Great Ambience,"We had lunch here and enjoyed the ambience, comfortable seating! Dessert is amazing, a must try if you are there. Food for lunch could be better eg more options. Couldn't fault anything else. A great place for celebration and connecting with friends."
Bar extraordinaire,"First, it‚Äôs the one of a kind setting; daring and different, yet distinctively decadent European in style. The steely, but warm brass effect slowly rubs on to you, like a slow sipping of a drink. You begin to take in the details just as you would truly enjoy your drink. The high ceiling draws you into a languishing mood, and you begin to sink into the comfort of a sofa or armchair; dreamy and interrupted only by the occasional shaking of a cocktail mixer. Your eyes too inadvertently drawn to the display of wine and liquor collection at the high tower, transporting you into a library of cocktails just waiting to be explored; all at the tips of an attentive bartender or service staff. If this experience isn‚Äôt enough, the menu with a good write up of the season‚Äôs promotion is another treat for both the buds and brains.
This is my first visit here and the service and cuisine are both unforgettable. Worth a revisit always."
Beautiful design and huge selection of Gins,Atlas is one of the best spots in Asia. Great food and excellent cocktails.Everythings is perfect and I'm falling in love with this place Gin Selection.
Poor Service,"called to inform i‚Äôm on the way, and will be slightly late. would appreciate some understanding but was responded with the standard reply that the table can hold only 15 mins. read the fine print, thats why i called isnt it.. seriously poor service and experience."
Unexpected!!!,"Gin lovers should not MISS!!! Good atmosphere most of drink in the menu‚Äôs is spirit forward. Service not be great I have to wait a bit before staff come to take the order. Decor and interior look impressive many corner good for take a photo.
The Largest Gin Collection in the World. One of the place M U S T visit in Singapore."
beautiful ambience! central! instagramable! good vibes!,"It is a very popular drinking place near bugis area!

I like the vibes and atmosphere over there! It is a very specious place and good for friend gatherings or meetings!

highly recommended!

cheers!"
There is a reason that Atlas,"There is a reason that Atlas tops a lot of lists- this spectacular bar really deserves to top those lists.
Exceptional service, great delicious food, awesome drinks on the menu, wonderful ambience, all this adds together and completes one‚Äôs experience as a memorable one.
Just celebrated my wife‚Äôs Birthday here today, extremely satisfied with everything.
A must visit bar/restaurant in Singapore."
Amazing Bar,The atmosphere of this bar is just impressive. The service was great. The food and the drinks was delicious. Would highly recommend this bar for a business or casual lunch/ afternoon tea / dinner or have a nice drink at the bar.
This place is spectacular.,"This place is spectacular. Located in what seems Gotham City, this bar is an art deco jem with stunning design, drinks and food. An absolute must do when in Singapore!!"
Desserts and drinks,"First time visit. Impressive interior decor, really retro and old school. It reminded me of a bar restaurant in London that was converted from a banking hall. It was a memorable visit to Atlas. We tried 2 martinis with 2 different types of desserts."
Disappointing service,"We were frequent visitors here for several years, only to make a booking for a celebration on Friday to find we accidentally made a booking for high tea as opposed to cocktails. Tried to discuss this with management who said they would charge us for the high tea regardless, and the credit could not be put towards anything else at all. So disappointing for a celebration. We thought that it would be much more accommodating and we‚Äôre very disappointed with the response from staff."
Good Looking Place but Expensive Drinks,Service was exceptional but I guess you pay for the service. It was much pricier than other bars that I've been to.
Prepare to be amazed - mind blowing bar!!,"Prepare to be amazed - I was caught off guard here! I travelled past the back of the building and noticed what appeared to be a Fernando Botero sculpture and made a note to return and so I did.

I could not believe my eyes at the amount of artwork on display in the rear court of this building. There is an amazing sculpture of a bird taking centre stage but unfortunately no one knows anything about it other than the bird points in the direction of Hong Kong - where the building‚Äôs owners are based. Understand that the Chinese inscription is related to a poem : Yellow Crane Tower from the Tang Dynasty ... at least I believe so.

Salvador Dali is well represented here with eight works by him. Absolutely stunning!!! Now entre the building - so typically Art Deco... well almost. A reproduction of Art Deco as the building was only built in 2002. But it is built so well that one is simply overwhelmed. The building is a treasure in itself and will be for any artist or fan of art.

The drinks are reasonably priced as is the food. The ambiance delightful and the service impeccable. All the waiting staff are Filipino and highly attentive.

I travel all over the world opening art events and I had never heard of this treasure on my doorstep.

This is certainly for me a hitherto undiscovered treasure. Go enjoy the hospitality and the environment. I understand there is also an art museum which is presently closed due to Covid. I hope I can visit the museum soon."
Generous Atlas afternoon tea with awesome ambience,"Booked Atlas afternoon tea for 2 on 22 Jun 2020. We arrived about 30 min before the scheduled time and were lucky to be seated. We were served a welcome champagne and an hors d'oeuvre which were a nice touch! The 2-tier savoury and sweet treats were generous in portion. In particular, the Iberico ham and smoked salmon were some of the tastiest I ever had! They would also nicely pack the remaining items for takeaway upon request. Overall, awesome ambience as always and friendly service, especially during this difficult period! Well done to the Atlas team!"
Don‚Äôt bother,"We were aware of the ‚Äòno slippers‚Äô dress code prior to visiting and so ensured we visited about 25 minutes prior to this dress code being put in place, enough time to have a quick drink. We wished we hadn‚Äôt bothered. I have worked in service since I started working, and NEVER would I have spoken to anyone in the tone in which I was spoken to.

We arrived 25 mins before the dress code was enforced and were met before we even entered the bar with an extremely rude staff member who told us (loudly, as to embarrass us) ‚Äòyou cannot come in, in those slippers‚Äô. (We were wearing long dresses, nothing revealing or scruffy) All 4 staff stood around and looked us up and down, super judgemental. We were both wearing nice sandals, but I knew after 5 it would only be an issue. I reminded the staff member of their dress code. The said ‚Äòyou are lucky, we will sit you at the bar only and you may only have one drink‚Äô. So, we sat at the bar and ordered a bottle of wine. The bar staff were rude and aloof, didn‚Äôt seem to care one bit about their jobs.

I watched other customers enter the bar in scruffy, dirty trainers and flip flops. Scruffy casual clothes. They were simply allowed in. This proved we were not dressed inappropriately. I‚Äôm not entirely sure why although the only logical explanation is that for regular customers they couldn‚Äôt care less what they look like as long as they are spending money.

I spoke with the manager on shift who agreed with me, that nothing should‚Äôve been said about our shoes given the time, and we shouldn‚Äôt have been sat at the end of the bar.

If I were to think back, I would‚Äôve left as soon as I encountered the shoddy service and attitudes of the hosts.

If you want somewhere to have a drink in gorgeous surroundings, go to the Manhattan bar."
"Cool looking bar, but slow service","We visited here right before Covid-19 hit Singapore hard, and there weren't that many guests. We arrived at 6:30 pm to secure a table. We were meeting a friend who was running late, so the slow service was to our advantage. Drinks were fine - it really felt like the type of bar you'd see in Manhattan. Very cool decor - it was written up in a magazine in the US - definitely appeals to tourists. It's inside ""the Batman building"" which is full of offices (no hotel)."
World class art deco brasserie,Probably one of the most beautiful art deco bar and restaurant in the world. High class and not too stuffy. We simply loved it.
Breathtaking Ambiance,"The room is jaw-droppingly beautiful.

It‚Äôs a great place for drinks and small bites, or afternoon tea (but you must order ahead for the latter). It‚Äôs expensive, but on par for Singapore.

Try to secure a cozy booth.

We liked it so much that went back a second time."
Great venue...service not so great!,"This bar/restaurant is visually quite amazing.
We settled down to drinks and ordered our food. All going well.
The food main courses came out and then we were abondoned!
No follow up service for drinks or desserts.
Very disappointing"
Great ambience.,"Patronised this highly acclaimed bar for high tea to celebrate our wedding anniversary. One can sit and gape at the superb interior design for a few hours. The high tea set comes with a good selection of tea or coffee plus a small glass of champagne or orange juice. The two-tied high tea set consists of savoury items and sweet items. Five stars /5 stars for presentation and 4 stars for taste. Service from staff was adequate. Had indicated that we were celebrating our anniversary during online reservation, hence the staff served us a tasty, ice-shaved complementary dessert. Very refreshing indeed. Kudos to the establishment for providing the extra item. Would patronise again for lunch or dinner in the near future."
"Gouge their Cuastomers, WAY Overpriced , Don't go here","Having a couple of glasses of wine, I asked for some olives. I'm thinking that the olives would be complimentary since there was no price given. Even if there was a charge , I thought the charge would be reasonable since the wine was so expensive for such average wine.

When I received my bill I was astounded that they charged me $12.00 . for FIVE OLIVES!!

Unbelievable that this bar, which by the way, was totally empty on a Friday night would Gouge it's customer like this."
Great experience!!! Friendly,Great experience!!! Friendly staf. Super cocktails and what a building and interior!!! Don‚Äôt miss it.
A Bar with amazing Interior!,As soon as you walk in you will be amazed by the amazing interiors (very grand). We did not book the table prior to arriving but the wait was fairly short. The selection of wine and food was amazing. The food which we ordered was fantastic and a great choice for vegetarians as well.
The most amazing 'Art Deco' Building.,"If you are a fan of 'Art Deco' this experience is not to be missed. This building is incredible, also known as the 'Batman Building by the locals, which becomes obvious when you see it. The atmosphere in this bar, on the approach, takes one straight back in time to the 1920's/30s, yet at the same time, feels 'uber' trendy and sophisticated and very much of the present day. One has to wait to be seated. Very polite and friendly staff will attend to you. The seating is large and luxurious and very comfortable. The Gin bar has to be the main attraction as it has the largest gin collection in the world along with the mesmorising decor which is a 'feast' for the eyes. First class experience, can't wait to go back! I would recommend smart casual dress for both lunch and evening drinking/dining. They may refuse entry if wearing trainers. Note, the air conditioning seemed quite fierce at the time of my visit. They very kindly offered me a shawl."
Wonderful Bar with incredible interior,"When you enter the Atlas Bar you are transported back to the 1920s and 1930s. It is as if you have landed in the bar of a great Ocean liner from yesteryear. It has an Art Deco interior with vibrant colours, geometric wall reliefs and paintings, gold decorative metal work and a huge glass and metal tower for numerous bottles of rare gin. The drinks menu is huge and the drinks inventive and evocative of different periods. It is a wonderful place to sit, sip and smile."
High class place to take photos,"I happened to know Jay Chou visited this bar when he came to SG for his concert and wanted to be there to try their service. Have to make adv appointment through their website to avoid disappointment, however you cant cancel last min as it will incur some fees. They were quite strict with the timing as you are allowed to be in at 4pm. Ordered their afternoon tea set from 4 to 6pm. The staff will explained the pastries one by one and recommended to eat from salty to sweet. The whole place gave a high class vibes and so the staff looked arrogant , not so friendly when ask for hot water for the tea."
Luxury Lunch at Atlas!,Had a fantastic 3 course set lunch here at these fantastic place. Every little details are taken care of. Services was great where no request were too much trouble. Chloe the server were attentive and these grandiose setting makes it feels like dining in a palace. Simply loves it! Will be back.
Wonderful bar and even better bar tender,Must do visit when in Singapore and if you‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôll be served by Lauren from Canada! She was amazing and made our visit even better. Thanks from Shane and Jon.
