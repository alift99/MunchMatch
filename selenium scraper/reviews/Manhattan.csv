Great New York Experience in Singapore,Kelvin provides great service to our time here at Manhattan. The innovative menus and personable engagement make us want to come back for more. Good job!
The Best Bar in SIngapore!,"Manhattan Bar has never failed to amaze me. Each visit is like a visit to your home away from home. Upon arrival you'll be greeted by the most hospitable receptionist Joyce and the most welcoming floor manager, Anne. I always love to sit by the bar and see where the action happens. Taesuk, Navien and Yahan have been the most gracious hosts; carefully explaining the cocktails and provide you with the best recommendations and the most interesting conversations. Kelvin, the bar manager, sees to it that all drinks are crafted to perfection and makes sure that you're well attended to. All of these attention to details make the Manhattan experience something to look forward to! Definitely a must visit!"
Attentive Service and Excellent Drinks!,"I've been coming here for awhile, and there is a reason. A special place isn't just the quality food and drink, it's the people. I appreciate the personal connection and service, as well as the great drinks. They have a wonderful curated menu with many options, and can also make you anything you need. Ask for a great martini or a manhattan, you won't be a disappointed."
Incredible cocktails,"Very chic decor with a great ambiance. You soon see why this is one of Asia top 50 cocktail bars. If you like vodka based cocktails, I recommend‚ÄôBe my guest‚Äô, although my favourite was definitely the spin on the ‚Äògod father‚Äô with Mezcal.

Food was also very good m, especially the beef cheek. Definitely book before going as it‚Äôs very difficult to get a table."
3 out of 6 drinks were really bad,"This place has a cool ambiance and a robust cocktail menu which had us excited upon arrival. Unfortunately, between the two of us, we ordered 6 different cocktails and 3 of them were laughably bad. We told the bartender we did not like them and he did not seem to care and did not remove any of them from the bill. The other 3 were tasty although another complaint is that they were all pretty small. For $28 per drink, it is unacceptable for us to have these complaints, thus the two star rating. On a positive note, we had a burger and chicken wraps which were delicious."
Superb on Sunday,Excellent drinks and service. Special thanks to Yogi for the expertly created cocktails. They set the bar -- and me -- so high.
Classy bar.,"I found and booked it after doing a search on good bars in Singapore.we went together and we had a warm welcome from the hostess who led us to our table. The bar itself was classy with good background music and low lighting. The hostess brought some water and a small hibiscus based liquor and we ordered our cocktails from the Manhattan based characters in the menu.
The cocktails were inventive and we had a pleasant 90 mins before we went off to our restaurant.
The prices are steep but we enjoyed the experience."
Great experience,Very good environment and good service. The cocktails and food are amazing. I enjoyed this experience a lot.
great cocktails good atmosphere,"impromptu last minute swing
By regent hotel and told my friend
Heard that this bar is quite well known ‚Ä¶ cosy atmosphere served by a Korean gal .. calm atmosphere perfect place to chill
Manhattan‚Äôs clientele was a perfect .. we were two gals .. my friend celebrated her birthday and we had dinner earlier at another restaurant .. the photos posted here does show happy moments spent at this place"
Hd Bartender Needs to be Open to Feedback,"Pointed out a marketing and fundamental area for improvement (or flaw - depending on how seriously and harshly <to themselves for improvement> Manhattan decides to to take this feedback, which I had communicated but the response was at best lukewarm) when I was there this evening.

While I understand that the glasses tried to follow the ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù in Manhattan during the 20s, Im not sure if this consistency is held for the other modern day concoctions, answer is that its not. So for the Vesper Martini, as ardent fans would know, was created in 1953 by Ian Fleming for Casino Royale. It was served in a proper martini glass because it was an off the cuff creation by Bond (Fleming of course).

To serve the Vesper in a 20s glass was both demeaning and fundamentally flawed. To (hopefully for Manhattan) know that its competitors Mortons Bar and Jigger & Pony followed the fundamentals to the ‚Äút‚Äùs and still insist on a flawed and illogical thought - would be almost suicidal.

Cocktails are about its taste, its fundamentals, its presentation as well as the (logical and interesting) stories surrounding it. Any misstep in any of these areas will cause a cognitive / emotional / taste dissonance for the drinker.

Manhattan is a great place painstakingly built up but if it were to maintain its front runner position, should seriously consider accepting feedback (Hd Bartender was Kelvin who didnt quite want to accept the feedback nor thought it important enough to have a mini discussion at least?!)

Adaptability, admittance and improvements are key to success - no one is ever to big to fail, so think about this."
Manhattan bar,Really nice place to chill with my friends. Staff was really kind and engaging. Was served by kelvin Yahan Yogesh Tei and Angela. Thank you guys so muchüôè
Never again.,"For a first time experience of this place, it was a huge disappointment. Booked a table with my girlfriends for my birthday.

As our drinks were being served, the staff poured an entire glass of drinks down my back. While I am sure it was an accident and the lady did apologize once for it, getting soaked with a cold drink on the back was not how i imagined my birthday drinks would start. I did choose not to make a big deal out of it but found it even more disappointing that there was no further apology for the incident.

The place looks good but the kind of service we got certainly defined the whole Manhattan experience to the point that the food and drinks did not have an impact to us at all."
A Friday Ritual,"I often show up on a Friday to enjoy the wonderful service and drinks. Rusty, Kelvin, Sophia, Yogi, and Yahan always take the time to have a conversation, check-in. Everyone needs to take the time to get to know the amazing staff. It only makes the experience better. Recommend the Lady Of Song and Kiss and Cry for champagne cocktail lovers, the popcorn is addictive!"
Great cocktail great service,I visited here on Thursday night. Thanks to hostess welcoming me even though i did‚Äôt make a reservation. Especially shoutout to Calvin and Yogesh. They really tried to figured out our type of cocktail and because of them i really enjoyed last night at the Manhattan bar:) Will come back soon
"Cozy ambience, excellent service and wide selection of drinks.....","It was my first trip to Manhattan which was highly recommended by friend Tal. He had an excellent experience and hence, we went.

We love the the classic charm with relaxing ambience....once seated, you are glued to the chair....

We were served by amazing Angela...we started with her recommendation of 3000, impossible meat as we are vegetarian, completed with another drinks which I have forgotten the name, it was soooo refreshing after the meal !

Before we left, we were surprised with another drinks on the house. Wow....we were so bloom away. What can we say ? We will definitely return to look for Angela....."
The Manhattan bar was not up to our expectations,"The Manhattan bar ranked No. 11 best bar in the world by CNN, No. 2 in SG. It was difficult to book a seat, but we finally managed. It has a nice ambiance. The waitress was helpful to recommend drinks. But we were a bit disappointed. The waiter is a bit pushy for us to get more drinks. Right after we got another drink, he told us that we have a few minutes left to leave! It was not crowded, with empty seats around. And we wish he had told us that before we ordered the drink! We saw other tables were offered the complementary drink at the beginning, but ours were offered in the end, when we were rushed to leave. The Manhattan bar was not quite up to our expectations."
This bar is just hard to beat,"We have been here a couple of times, and every time it's a great time.
The team is welcoming and friendly. The drink menu is always a masterpiece of surprise of creativity that never fails to impress.
The chilled atmosphere and dim lighting make it a relaxing and great place to spend some time over amazing cocktail creations."
"Triple threat- great service, drinks and ambience","We love coming to Manhattan because service is always warm and friendly and it feels like home. Tim and Alson made our drinks tonight and we love that they had ideas about what spirit, bitters or liqueur went better with a particular cocktail we chose. Justin was our waiter the last time we visited; he remembered us and popped by to say hi, which is amazing because they must get a lot of guests!

And of course the drinks are fabulous and the ambience cosy (they have a Christmas tree in the corner for the festive season, which works well with the leather sofas and wood paneling). We like the redemption burger and the clam chowder (full of goodness!)

Do pay them a visit when you are next in Singapore, hopefully this year if borders re-open."
Chill Bar to catch up and drink few cocktails,"We tried around 10 different cocktails - some prefer one recipe over another but overall the feedback is positive. Also kudos with the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff - top notch service‚ò∫Ô∏èHowever for the food-wise, it was mediocre. So the expectation when going there is really just for drinking and catching up with friends/colleagues/business meetings"
I love manhattan bar,"Great ambience, delicious cocktails, witty bartenders with a great sense of humor (Gabriel Carlos) what more can you ask for? There‚Äôs no doubt this is one of the best bars in the world. Seat at the bar and enjoy the show. It‚Äôs definitely my favorite bar in Singapore."
Great place for drinks and,"Great place for drinks and food! Excellent coktails ...pretty good experience. The service is great, and the I'm always satisfied with the drinks."
Keep calm and drink (at) Manhattan,"One of the best bar in the world, warm welcome from first step good recommended from staff and also staff have a good product knowledge. The cocktails show how professional they are.

Sophisticated and craft cocktail that make me excited, I love aging N E G R O N I from the barrels. Highly recommended."
Amazing cocktail bar,One of the best bars I‚Äôve been to in Singapore. The decor is from a prohibition era New York speakeasy and the bar area is one of the classiest I‚Äôve seen. They have an extensive cocktail menu with drinks from different decades. The interesting part is their menu of aged cocktails which I‚Äôve never seen before. I had the New York sour which was their take in a whisky sour. Really well thought of cocktail. It‚Äôs a bit pricey but the service and quality of drinks make it worth it.
Lovely evening,"Great knowledge of cocktails, and willingness to make different cocktails than on the menu. A lovely evening with family."
Divine,"I celebrated my birthday during the f1 weekend. Probably one of the best bar all over the world. Great people, relaxing spaces and classy atmosphere. Staff was just super friendly and helpful, caring so much to give me great time celebrating. I would love to come back."
Fantastic drinks by bartender Frank; service generally good,"Our nth time to Manhattan -- a sophisticated bar with equally sophisticated, complex drinks. Ask for Frank -- he is the best bartender there: friendly, knowledgeable, and passionate. We have tried drinks made by other bartenders (other past visits), and if you order a classic or a drink from the menu, it would be ok, but if you ask them to create a drink (e.g. based on whiskey or gin or something not too sweet etc), it wouldn't be that good. But Frank knocks perfect cocktails. Those from the menu and classics -- he will of course get them right, but ask him to create one for you -- I asked for something a little sweet and sour, not too strong on the alcohol and he created this amazing, smooth, complex drink of pineapple and apricot and gin based. AMAZING. Most bartenders would create something lemon or yuzu inspired, but he did something different. And that was just one of many drinks had made for us -- all very much enjoyed.

Food is always good -- try the lobster mini sliders or snow crab taco (or is it the other way round!), though slightly pricey.

Service is generally very good, but occasionally, on busy nights, and with no reservations, some staff can be slightly condescending and frosty.

All round, one of our favourite bars and it has continued to be our favourite."
Just wonderful,"LOVE LOVE LOVE

we arrived with no form of reservation and didn‚Äôt realise quite how busy it would be. Despite not having a seat for about 30 mins, the staff were so incredibly attentive and ensured we knew about all of the cocktail menu while waiting. A seat cake free at the bar and staff promptly moved up so we could sit. The menu is amazing, as someone who adores a good cocktail I was talking to a bartender about the kind of flavours I liked, and they made one especially for me. We stayed until they closed chatting with the staff and had such a wonderful time. I recommend here to anyone who visits Singapore."
Wonderful cosy bar,"Exceptional service, great atmosphere, own cocktails, own wine, whisky cellar etc. David, the manager, was just great. Thanks"
Manhattan Singapore Sunday Brunch,Third time here for Sunday Brunch and still rates as our #1 Brunch in Singapore for Quality of food & drinks. Fantastic talented staff. Awesome cocktails and speciality drinks. 8 Food stations plus a great menu to choose from. Absolute must do ‚úÖ when in Singapore on Sunday.
Excellent cocktails and atmosphere,Great bar with amazing sophisticated cocktails and a truly cosmopolitan atmosphere. Highly recommended!
Awesome Bar,"Fantastic Bar, one of the best in Asia with barrel aged cocktails and lots of great food. Not so noisy that you can't talk but it has a good atmosphere."
Perfect,"Housed within the Regent, this bar is one among the 5 best for a reason and it's quite evident from the time you step-in.

But what took us by surprise is the Beef Burger. Perfectly cooked and Meaty, easily the best Burger in Singapore.

Hospitality is Top -Notch and we wouldn't mind going back for a drink or two, whenever we shall visit next time."
Oddball,"Visited twice and 2 very different experiences. The first visit everything was amaaaazing!! Staff were friendly and helpful, cocktails were sublime. Second visit, seemed to be a different team. Cocktails were sloppy and missing garnishes from the previous visit. Service was slow for a very similar number of people present. I'd still recommend but maybe if you're unlucky and go on a bad night don't begrudge visiting again as they really can put on a show!"
Intimate,This is the second time we have been to Manhattan. It is now on our must do list of things when in Singapore. The Sunday brunch is top notch. The food is great and the alcohol even better. We love the intimate nature of the brunch (maximum of only 70 people). The gin room is a nice touch and the staff are attentive. Do yourself a favour and check it out!
Classy bar and skilled bartenders,Went to the Manhattan the other evening and I was very pleased with the experience as it was my first time there and I heard many good things. Classy bar with professional staff. The bartenders are highly skilled and service was top notch. Thanks to the Manhattan team!
Chic cocktail bar,Huge amount of interesting cocktails here. Excellent service and we enjoyed the non stop bbq popcorn too. Very swish place.
World Class Lounge,"Great decor, friendly service and genuine cocktails freshly made from original ingredients. Strugle to find better cocktails. Foods are OK, but the ambience makes up for that. Great show guys. Much prefer service over the overated Atlas lounge."
We love it!,"There were some surprises from this famed bar located at Regent Hotel. Firstly - service. We went expecting pretentious, snooty, or disinterested staff who think they deserved to be waited upon and you, the customer, should be grateful to be standing at their door. Well, that's not uncommon in many bars/clubs. And this is the bar that has the accolade of being one of the best in the world.

But... smash! That's the sound of the shattered preconception we had of the place. The staff here was actually nice and friendly.

Then the drinks came. And, oh, what a drink! My friend's Mad Dog was great! We both loved it. Mine was less spot on from recommendation but it nevertheless had layers of tastes - with first note, second note and maybe even a third. Our second drinks were good too. My friend and I have had our fair shares of drinks during the years we've known each other but the drinks here went down as one of those memorable ones.

The next surprise... the music. We were totally expecting something a little more bluesy, or more mellow, or more sophisticated for a place that's a little art deco in style. But it was loud, and pop. It was totally unexpected and I would probably prefer something else. But, I can't say it turned me off. Would have preferred a little lower in volume though.

Another surprise... the staff who took our second order offered to show us the rickhouses. She spoke at length of the purpose of the place and in such detail that I thought she must have worked there for a year or two. nope. About 1 and a half months. And she was nice and friendly too. Good staff nowadays is so hard to come by and this place managed to get them.

The place was pretty dim and I didn't really notice customers sitting further away but those who were near were definitely those you'll feel comfortable with. No one seemed to be vying for the most pretentious and cooler than thou crown. The clientele base is good - at least on the night we were there.

The snack was good too. And you can take your time with that wonderful drink... the beautiful, beautiful crystal-clear ice (triple distilled?) will not melt for a long while and thus the drink will not be diluted and still remain cold.

In short... love the place, the service, the drinks! If there's one thing I could ask for, it's the lighting. It's too dark for us to have a good look of the fabulous menu and that prevented us from ordering more.

(An expensive but disappointing dinner that night almost ruined the night and this bar turned it around.)

."
Best in Singapore!,"Visiting this bar is a must for any food/drinks enthusiast traveling to Singapore. The bar sets the scene for a glamorous evening, the design of the bar is outstanding and all the drinks ive had from here are delicious!"
Sophisticated Bar and Crafted Cocktails,"Popped in for a post-dinner beverage and had not been back to this bar in a few years and hence, a new look.

Sat at the bar and ordered my staple, very very dry Tanqueray Martini.

The bartender not only made it to my taste by added his own touch to it making it just so subtle a taste different and better than the norm.

Ambience is sophisticate but comfy.

A treat!"
Sitting at the bar is a MUST !,Been here a few times and the best times are always when seated at the bar. You need to watch the mixologists in action as well as to feel the atmosphere. While its big and cosy been seated away from the bar in less impressive. So get there early (pre-9pm). It has a great range of drinks and can never remember my favourite afterwards ! Says it all really. Also bar bites are good if a little big so order wisely. Definitely a repeater.
Beautiful and cozy,This bar is really beautiful and really nice staff. It's was perfect to have this bar in our hotel Regent Singapore. It's the best bar in Asia.
It will remain best in Asia for us,"We are never disappointed in Manhattan! We are coming few times a months to relax and have good drinks, BUT also for the bartender and waitress who are am-azing! They can remember you, chat with you and still remain so professional! Special for Tim, Hannah and Jenny! It is always great Tim there!"
A Must in Singapore for bars aficionados,"Top bartenders top service in the room . Very relaxing atmosphere ; service is efficient and almost invisible thanks to discrete presence. Cocktails are endless in number with added improvisation if you let Tim and his colleagues surprise you . No wonder this bar is among the ten best. Hannah, Jenny , Elise but not only provide international and friendly service. Go for it ."
Terrible Service,"Don't waste your time coming. Tried twice to go here while staying in the hotel, both times the ladies who manage the door are incredibly rude, not helpful at all in accomodating you and in Singapore there are better places."
Fantastic cocktail bar,"Great place and great cocktails are made by great bartenders. Fantastic venue, great atmosphere and fine selection of drinks. The service was good and professional. I would love to come back this place in the future."
Dark Bar,"We came for drinks before dinner at Summer Palace, the interior is rather dark. The service is good and they even give us welcome drinks on the house.

it feel sophisticated and yet warm and friendly.

But I'm not sure why it is one of the world's best bar."
"Great bar, but...","Located inside Regent Hotel, it's a sophisticated high class bar, providing an overall great experience.
Cocktails are good, I had a mojito that was perfect, but the Martini cocktail was brought in the wrong glass, strange for a bar ranked 3 in the world..
In terms of ambiance is good, even thogh I was expecting a bigger place."
"A nice bar, but left a bit perplexed as to why it's been awarded the third best bar in the world???","Visiting Singapore for the first time in a few years, I was keen to check out its ever changing - and increasingly competitive - bar scene. Manhattan was high on my list to visit having read many a good review...

We arrived soon after opening. The bar iteself is beautiful. From arrival, staff were friendly and welcoming, however service lacked any geniune engagement. There was no offer to explain the menu, highlight some of their signature cocktails, etc - which is automatic with most other premium bars. I asked if they had any signature cocktails similar to a martini / a twist on - the short answer was 'no', with no alternate suggestions. Whilst the classic gin martini that I subsequently ordered was very good, the overall experience was somewhat of a disappointment."
One of the world's best bars!,"An amazing and luxurious experience, the staff were absolutely amazing and looked after us so well! Drinks were awesome. Can't wait to go back!"
Sophisticated hotel bar,"Apparently it was voted number 3 bar in the world. Not sure about that, but service is good with plenty of staff around, bar is stylish and quite busy."
Sunday brunch - fantastic hospitality from Ariana and Joshua,"We were here last weekend for Sunday brunch. Lighting was nice, sofas were comfortable, and the music wasn't too loud so we could still have conversations. Cocktails were delicious! Spent around 3 to 4 hours there and time flew! Service was spectacular, and my group loved Ariana and Joshua. Thank you for being so accommodating, and for truly embodying the spirit of hospitality. They were very attentive to our needs and wants, and went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. They made us laugh too! Where else would we find such incredible hosts? We were seated in the private room, and they came in very often to attend to us. We wouldn‚Äôt have had such a wonderful time without them. Please pass on my compliments to them. Can't wait to be back!"
My all time favorite bar,"The team, quality of service along with exceptional drinks make me keep returning to this bar.

For me, it is the best bar that I've visited anywhere on my travels and I'd always recommend a visit.

The cocktail menu is a take on classic drinks through the ages, with many of their own drinks included. Got a favorite that's not on their menu or fancy something a bit different? No problem, just tell the guys what you fancy and they won't disappoint you!

Fancy food on your visit too? Do it! Make sure you order the fries too, that Truffle Mayo is delicious!

Thank you to Tim who is always an exceptional host (ask for something Mezcal based) and the rest of the team, every one of them are at the top of their game!"
The bartender and the many unique drinks,A very nice place to chill and unwind after a long day. The ambience is very nice and the staff also very friendly a good place to meet for drinks and chat also watch the concoction of many drinks by bartender
Great drinks and awesome service,"Been to Manhattan a couple of times since they opened, and will always introduce new friends to try. There are drinks to suit everyone's preference. Love the cocktails, so pretty and tasty. Cheesecake is a must! ‚ù§ the team is friendly and even if it's crowded, the service level doesn't drop and you feel welcomed."
Beautiful service and interiors,"By far one of the most memorable bar experience I've had, award-winning staff and drinks that'll 'wake you up'. Definitely worth the title of the best in Singapore and third in the world."
The Best Bar in the World!,"Not only is it the #1 bar in Asia, or is one of the top in the world! From drinks to food to decor to service and staff, this place is amazing! I call it my ""Cheers"" as I love it so much! They didn't become the best without being the best! Some of the best cocktails you will ever have and a large drinks selection. Try the weekend brunch which is one of the best in Singapore, too! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Nice, relaxed lounge to escape to.","This was the perfect venue to escape to at the end of a busy day. The Manhattan, located within The Regent Hotel, is a cocktail lounge which provides a high quality service from the friendly, knowledgeable staff."
The best bar ever!,"If you are into cocktails and am serious about your drinks, this is the place to visit whenever you are in Singapore. The host and staff get five stars from me. They will make you feel at ease no matter how busy they are. The wide selection of cocktails was another plus point for me as you are transported through history with the selection of cocktails."
Great but not the best bar in Asia,"So I don't really know what to feel about the Manhattan. Sure, the drinks were great (loved the menu) and that's definitely a good start for a bar. However, the place itself is not that great-looking (especially compared to some other Singapore bars, e.g. the Atlas) and the service was a bit sub-par as well. I wouldn't go here again since there are a few other great bars in Singapore with amazing cocktails."
Super cocktails,"I friend of mine bring me there, nice place, maybe a little too dark, you need the light of your phone to look at the menu... But all the rest exceptional. Super special cocktails ... aged into the barrel... unusual and nice !!!!"
Our favourite bar in Singapore! Its a must!,"This place is next level amazing. The venue itself is simply stunning. The staff so welcoming, engaging and knowledgeable. The drinks are simply perfection. We intended to go for one quick drink and we ended up staying for drinks both chosen by us and specially created by the bartender, snacks and tour of their facilities. We had the best time. The atmosphere is so welcoming and relaxed you don't feel any rush to leave. Also being an adults only space is a welcoming retreat from holidaying families. We had such a lovely time here and we cannot wait to have the opportunity to return one day."
cocktails are mind blowing,good place to enjoy amazing cocktails. wide range of drinks and very skilled bar staff. high recommend to have drinks here on your Singapore visit
A step back in time,Almost like a speakeasy. Great cocktails and a fun people watch. It is pricey but certainly worth dropping in for a drink either early doors or a nightcap.
Best cocktail bar in town,"This is not my first time here and it will not be my last, for sure. Manhattan is my kind of cocktail bar - just love everything here... the ambience, drink menu, staff and service, vibes, etc.

Check it out and your evening till late night will be awesome!!"
Boozy Brunch,"Cocktail-centric Sunday brunch if you‚Äôre looking to knock yourself out, tried 3 out of 5 on the roster with Mango Rice and Aged Singapore Sling being my favourite. There were also boozy milkshakes, G&T/Bloody Mary cart and there was a focussed food selection and an a-la-minute crepes suzette flambeed with grand marnier. Excellent service led by Roland and Arianne."
Cozy & Elegant Ambiance !!!!,"Getting inside by dark, but absolutely cozy and classic bar as 1920s concept. Drinks was a bit over price but they were worth it. Amzing place where u can enjoy your business talks and friend chats"
Just wow,"Okay. I stayed in Regent Singapore for 4 nights. On the first night, I went to check out this bar. I got really shocked looking at the liquor menu. It took me a while to go through them. They have a wide collections of liquor especially on whisky and single malts. Most of them something I never heard of. A great place to hang out and the environment is really nice. Have a sit at the bar and have fun looking at the bartenders preparing the cocktails. I personally tried the cocktail called Mad Dog. It‚Äôs damn strong. And I suggest this to those who wants to have a good sleep."
Decent cocktails,"I came here early in the week and was surprised to find it so busy, but we were still able to get a table without a reservation. Cocktails are all around the $25++ mark. Good selection and decent quality with knowledgeable service. Of larger size than some of the other bars in the Asia top 50 list in Singapore and this detracts a little from the intimacy of the occasion. Still worth a visit though."
Excellence in every possible way....,"Inside a swanky hotel? Check
Elegant and professional host up front? Check
Impressive, if not overwhelming interior finishes? Check
Service levels exceed even high expectations? Check
Cocktail menu organized in a fun and professional way? Check
Drinks exceeded high expectations? Check

This is simply one of the best bar experiences anywhere. We discovered this place on the list of Asia's top 50 bars and it surely belongs at it's high level. It's outstanding and excellent and every single detail of the experience has been teased out to perfection.

The only problem is that it's not easy to get into, so make an online reservation early if possible. You will not be disappointed. It's located on the second floor in the Regent Hotel."
Best bar we've been to,"Great service, amazing atmosphere and really good cocktails. A big thank you to Tim for the great hospitality, for the spot on personalized cocktails and for all the small touches and details that made us feel welcomed and cared for. Thank you also to Suzanne and the whole Manhattan team who should definitely be recognized for the quality of their service. We have been to some of the top 50 bars in the world and this is our top choice so far."
"Top 1 in Asia, Top 3 in the world?","Singapore's Manhattan ranked No. 3 on World's 50 Best Bars.

Best,Thanks FRANK for the cocktails. Awesome Mixologist and very friendly. He made my wife an out-of-the-menu chocolate and coffee martini and she loved it! Will be back for more! -Raj and Mina
Wonderful Manhattan,"If you are thinking of booking into the Manhattan for Sunday brunch,do yourself a favour and stop thinking and just DO IT.My wife and I attended on Sunday 24/2/19 and had the best time ever.This was our second visit for the brunch,the first being around three years ago,which we thought was amazing but it has only gotten better.For beautiful food,amazing cocktails and fabulous service,this is the place to be.This place is not rated number one cocktail bar in Asia for no good reason.Finally a big thank you to all the management and staff for making our last day in Singapore extra special.Mr & Mrs Crockett."
They Made My Drink,"#3 bar in the world...
Best in Asia....

Manhattan has obiously wowed a lot of critics with its innovative cocktails (tsty).

But for me, it was about my Death in the Afternoon. I call it my vacation drink. It's been around for nearly a century, but has fallen far, far from public awareness. So much so, that when I order it I have to explain how it is to be made.

Not so here. Boom, pow--One Hemingway cocktail. Then, the bar manager came over to have a short discussion on not only the drink, but Hemingway in general.

Kudos, my friends."
Enjoyable evening,"Great ambience and food, not forgetting the drink selection! Friendly staff providing top-notch service. Would be even better if there were more food choices for vegetarian and vegan."
Chance discovery - and what a find,"Cocktail lounges were not on our agenda in Singapore - we found the Manhattan by chance and were bowled over. The cocktails were great of course but it's the little details that count. The staff friendly, knowledgeable. The glasses were exquisite, different styles for different drinks but all harking back to a more glamorous time. The theatre of watching each cocktail being prepared. The complimentary little grilled sandwich. Perhaps it depends on when you go to this cocktail lounge - we went before dinner on both occasions and found the ambience friendly and relaxed. Check out the negroni ageing barrels."
classy but....,drinks are deliiish and thats about it.. be prepared to spend some time waiting... nooot cool but ok. they should def shape up the staff
"After dinner drinks ""bar of the night""","The variety of drinks is fantastic. Drinks for all occasions, moods and taste buds. Ambience is so relaxing, yet exhibits an air of ""special class"". Very friendly staff and music very appropriate. Waiting to go there again."
Atmosphere and great drinks,Atmosphere was very clubby with deep chairs and sofas surrounding the lounge. Great music being played.
Well Deserving of the Best Bar in Asia title.,"This bar has a fantastic collection of liquors, including many bottles of the famed Pappy Van Winkle on exhibit in the side room. But what we enjoyed the most were the energy and enthusiasm of the 3 bartenders as they made the drinks. Each drink was prepared with personality and flair. So fun to watch."
Top Bar!,The bar is stylish with friendly and beautiful staff. Spectacular drinks with an exceptional whisky selection. Food is good too.
Great Cocktails,"It‚Äôs the best bar in the world for a reason. Located in a hotel you can‚Äôt even think of, excellent ambiance with world-class drinks. Go there looking amazing. The drinks are small but they are really amazing. For me the ambiance, the people made up for the price. Would definitely go back again."
Great Ambience,It is a bar with great collection of single malts and whiskey and wines from world over. We enjoyed a very popular single malt 'Yamazaki' of Japan.
Adults Only Brunch,"Although the brunch is pricey it is worth It if you have a large appetite and can throw back several cocktails. Definitely do not eat a big breakfast before taking on this brunch.

The wait staff were very attentive and always made sure you had a drink. The cocktail list was fantastic, was good quality and the cocktails were not watered down at all.

I specified my dietary requirements (gluten and lactose intolerant) in advance and they made sure that I was catered for. One as even walked through the buffet so I knew exactly what I could and couldn't have.
There is a lot fresh seafood available and red meat."
More than a bar,"Manhattan Bar is an institute in Singapore, also in Southeast Asia.
The beautiful and warm atmosphere, rustic furniture and absolutely amazing drinks.
Look after Philip, who is more than a Bar Manager. He is a great host, has a wide knowledge of cocktails and their history. He will show you around, introduce the aging room alongside a yummy barrel-aged cocktail.
Thank you so much for this unforgettable experience"
Pretty good but not sure World number 3 ??,"All the local bars were raving about this place given its recent entry as the Worlds number 3 cocktail bar, but to be honest i wasn't singing from the same hymn book. Situate in the Regent Hotel it certainly ticks all the boxes, it is stylish, well presented and polished. The waiting list at the front door indicates popular and they manage the turnover well without overcrowding. But if you are to be harsh, all i saw was a big room with well appointed furniture. The staff were really good but not excessively friendly. The cocktail list was quite well done, bar tenders great and bar presentation great also , the music was fine, but just didn't quite pack the punch i was expecting. Possibly my expectations were far greater than they could deliver but given some of the other cocktail bars i have tried, to be number 3 globally, maybe you have to tick boxes that exclude atmosphere and fun?? Will certainly go back to get a second opinion. Don't get me wrong , outstanding venue that maybe caught me on a bad night."
Fancy cocktails,The cocktails were quite nice and nicely presented. They also have a very nice huge bar. This is a very good place to drink after work I guess.
A great old fashioned bar,"Super drinks, excellent service and attention to detail. Its like going back in time for the all the positives without the negatives."
Very cosy and the drinks are delicious works of art,We visited Manhattan Bar after the hip 28 Hong Kong Street on the same night and were delighted to fall into the comfortable leather armchairs with a delectable drink. Worth to try except Singapor Sling are the Mad Dog and Manhattan. Went there every evening of the rest of our stay. It's location in Regent Hotel and access through an impressive lobby is another advantage.
Great hotel bar,"Classic hotel bar, elegant and sophisticated with a great range of drinks including wine list. Bartenders have good knowledge of cocktails. A good place to have a few drinks with colleagues."
Fantastic experience and cocktails,"The service from the time we got here to the time we left was excellent, the servers knew the menu well enough to answer any questions we had, and checked in regularly.The welcome drink, the sandwich, the wet towel upon arrival were all a nice addition to the experience. The cocktails did not disappoint, between the two of us we had 3 cocktails each; we also ordered some bar bites. Lovely ambiance and not overcrowded which was another welcome experience. Perfect for date night drinks."
Ok bar,The bar itself looks great. Staff does the job well but the drinks were just average and lack of consistency as my second cocktail tasted different from the first
Manhattan Bar,"The bar is well fitted out and seems to have the potential to be welcoming but it is overrated and pretentious.
We were OK to wait for half an hour to get in, during which time the dress code of the lady in our company wearing the birkenstock shoes seemed OK but it wasn't nice to have it questioned once we got in. We were allowed to stay in. This is watching other people in the bar wearing snickers, shorts and logo t-shirts.
We had a lot of attention of the waitress to start off but then the service died off and we couldn't get the service for half an hour."
Fantastic!,"I love the elegant ambiance of the bar and lounge that seems to take you to a different place and time in America. Staff are dressed to impress, friendly and knowledgeable, specially their manager Roland who showed us around their interesting barrel ageing room. The handcrafted cocktails looks beautiful and tastes great. It was definitely a fantastic experience."
Remember when the brunch was good?!,"Lived in Singapore for 3.5 years, and this was hands down my favorite brunch - 4 hour free flow cocktails, ala carte and buffet style (Mini bagel station is DA BOMB), NO KIDS, incredibly comfy leather couches and chairs - seriously this place had it all going for it. And then....idk what happened. I came back to visit and of course, booked this place.

The four hours is now 3. The ala carte dishes have drastically diminished in quality what was once waygu is now chicken tenders. The cheese room has up and vanished. And the price is still the same. I think I paid the whopping fee for a few cocktails and mini bagels.

Whilst the food selection was extremely disappointing, the service was great - attentive, quick to refill our drinks (though do note they stop serving 30 min prior to close which means its really only a 2.5 hour brunch). We had a private room which was fantastic for a large group to catch up and chat, but I think that was my last visit. I just cannot justify the price for some bagels and cocktails especially since I know how good it actually used to be.

Sorry guys, you dropped the ball on this one."
Get lost in the 1920s,"Very cool place.
Inviting from the start. You walk into a dark, but cozy and high end bar. Plush seating down the center with slow tables on either side. You really need to make a reservation if you want to be seated at one of the tables, otherwise, you'll get a seat at the bar. We were early and with no reservations could only sit at the bar.
The bartender attended to us right away, providing us with menus, a glass of water and a bowl of popcorn to snack on.
On the right had side as you walk in, you can find their whiskey and bourbon barrels and on the left their spirits.
I had the 12 MILE OUT (Plantation Pineapple Rum * Michter's US1 Straight Rye * Ferrand Dry Cura√ßao * Lemon * Grenadine) - Prohibition can only extend so far. Hardly an obstacle to ambitious entrepreneurs who sail wealthy patrons to international waters for a day of carousing
He had the MAD MEN (Balvenie Double Wood 12 Years * St. Germain * Black Walnut Bitters * Perrier-Jou√´t Grand Brut) - The hard drinking, hard partying kings of Madison Avenue would approve of this masculine year elegant delight. It was served with a very cool ice cube embossed with the Manhattan Logo.
Both were delicious!
Service was very good. The bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable. We were able to walk around and take some pictures. Everyone was friendly and accommodating.
Highly recommend it for cocktails and a respite."
Wow,High class cocktail with very professional staff. It is a place to drink a cocktail. There menu is really focus and give people good choice about punches that can be share along friends
Service need to improve!,"Good selection of drinks ranges from whiskey, wines, gin etc.. cool bar with both counter and couches . However, the service needs to improve. I have party of 7 with some guest did come unexpectedly, I requested to change to a bigger table that‚Äôs still empty at 7pm but was told that table has been reserved. I asked about getting a more comfortable chair but was rejected.. then by 830, the big table was only half full with the guest. We could have used this table... but wasn‚Äôt offered by them at all. Worst thing was the service is way too slow . You have to wait for Long time to be served for taking order, serving wine or food. However, the waitress is friendly and helpful but inattentive ! When they saw the guest without glass, they won‚Äôt do anything proactively till you raise your hands! I doubt they are short handed and the space wasn‚Äôt that big and also the guest out there last night not that money too. Nice bar and bites are both good but need further improvement for the service level!!!"
"relaxed vibe, upscale with a touch of glamour - not a typical tourist bar","Manhattan Bar is -like 28 hongkong street- on the list of Asia's Best Bar for 2018. After our disappointment on 28 hongkong street, we were very happy with this bar. The bar is like a separate big ""box"" in the regent hotel. After entering the bar, you are in a totally differerent world. We loved the decor, it has a bit old world charme of the 1920. There were not so many tourist here as e.g. Altitude. Nice drinks and surprising food (green small apples). Relaxed vibe with glamour."
