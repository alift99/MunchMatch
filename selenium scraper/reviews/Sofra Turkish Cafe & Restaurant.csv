Authentic Turkish cuisine.,The ambience is lovely. The staff is very welcoming and warm. Awesome food. Authentic turkish taste. Must have - kunefe / kunefe with ice cream. Also ask for the season/current special.
Great Food,"Excellent service, delicious food, nice and clean environmentenvironment. Only recommendation is to serve free (tap) drinking water as well."
"Good food, good vibes","My 1st time dining in at Sofra was awesome so it is without a doubt that I suggested this restaurant to 4 other friends, who had not dined here previously. They love the food and the ambience! Food portions were just right. Good service as well from the staff I hope to return again soon next year? Happy New Year!"
Excellent in all aspects,"Had our family reunion to celebrate Christmas.
Food although is a bit pricey, its fantastic.
Service is tiptop."
Awesome Food,The food in Sofra is excellent as always. My family enjoyed the food and service. Looking forward to my next visit there.
One of the Best Turkish Restaurants,Chef platter and Kunefe must try. We had a seat with great view. Lamb doner tastes tender and juicy.
"New Place, New Vibes","I have always visited Sofra back at its old place. This is my first visit at the new outlet and I am impressed at how spacious the place is. The service is fast too and the food satisfying as usual.

I do miss the old atmosphere though. But still a great place to go."
Average,"Service was excellent, the food is so so .. very dry - and the price is very expensive. the waiters were very very friendly, and ambience was superb though."
Fantastic!,Food was fantastic. Ordered the platter and everything was tasty and cooked to perfection! Service was very good too. Loved the ambience and the seating spaces. Highly recommend their Apple Tea!
Amazing night out with girlfriends,Warm and cosy atmosphere. Excellent view. Far better than their previous location. Top service. Food delicious.
Great food at reasonable price in prime location,"This was the best restaurant I could find near Esplanade. Near Esplanade (<10min walk), great view, authentic Turkish food, staff and high-quality service. Air con was a bit cold and our food got cold quickly, but the food was good and I would recommend!"
Excellent service and serve quality food,It's been a long time since I entered a restaurant that deserve the 10% customer service that was mandatory charged to my bill. Sofra definitely deserves more. The staffs were attentive and you can feel their sincerity at your service. The chicken kebab and mutton stew were tender and flavourful. The yoghurt drink was salty and neutralizer the sweetness from the desert giving you a perfect balance. Nice ambience and outdoor view. Definitely worth a visit or more.
Must dine in,"Be served politely like royals here with fine dining service standards, beautiful deco, turkish ambiance, pretty sky view, comfy seats and deliciously generous portions. The booking staff Rebacca is kind and patiently helps me settle my reservations smoothly. The experience at Sofra is improved lightyears away from the previous Sofra at Shaw Towers."
Delicious Food and Nice Ambience,The food was delicious and the restaurant has a nice ambience. The staff are friendly and helpful. We were surprised to have the staff sang a birthday song and gave a complimentary chocolate pudding with a candle on it. We are very happy with their service.
Well worth the visit,We had heard that this was the place to go here in Singapore if you were looking for authentic middle eastern food. After living in the Middle East for a few years I didn’t have high expectations that the food would be as good. I was wrong the atmosphere the service and the food was outstanding. The food quantity was excellent you will leave full. The food was about as authentic as you can get.
Excellent Turkish Food,"I went there with a friend for dinner, probably this is the 5th time to this restaurant, food great, clean place, staff helpful, i like busy restaurant because it means frish food, prices fair specially if you know rentals in Singapore, recommended for any fan of good Turkish food, I'll repeat the visit for sure as long am in beautiful Singapore."
Best restaurant for turkish food,The food was good and service was fast The atmosphere is like being in turkey even if you want to ask about smth you will find someone beside explaining everything on the menu.
Family Time,It was a busy night at the restaurant but it is always a good atmosphere eating at the restaurant with family and the food is excellent. Thank you !!
"Had a fabulous time - attentive staff, delicious food, impeccable service!","Went with a girl friend and the service by the wait staff is impeccable, they are very attentive and thoughtful and would go the extra to uplift the ambience. We witnessed at least 6-7 birthday celebrations of big groups - so do book if you intend to celebrate your milestones here! We ordered 2 pax portion for the salad (with all the dips) and a meat platter - and boy we couldnt finish it and had to take away. All the dishes are superb and absolutely delicious, will definitely be back. Not to mention the ambience and how pretty the venue is."
"nice ambiance, good food","food is nice, but desserts need a lot of improvement. The Kunafe is so dry and hard. no cream to pour but provided upon request. Rice pudding to sweet and no taste other than milk and sugar taste.
mutton is fresh but unfortunately it has smell."
A Memorable Day at Sofra,"We had a huge family gathering at Sofra on Sunday 25 September. It was a celebration to commemorate my mother's birthday along with my two other Aunts. We booked the place a good 2 hours and it was the best time for all of us. The food served to us was fabulous and fresh from the kitchen. We had three tables including a private room so we had ample space to sit and enjoy the food. As we have a large group, we had made the reservation and we would advise that you do the same, especially on weekends, public holidays or peak hours. We made our reservation through Lynn at Sofra. She has a pleasant personality and is very attentive to the customers dining in the restaurant. The ambience of the restaurant is great. The waiters are patiently dealing with our needs, especially since we have kids and elders at our gathering.
Overall, it was an awesome experience and we will definitely come back in the future. Keep up the good work Sofra!"
Memorable experience,"Held our team dinner at SOFRA and had a great experience!

We were given a private room that was cosy and unique in design.

Food was tasty and in generous portions. We enjoyed every single one of the dishes.

Special thanks to Suleyman, Guven and Ishant for their preparation and attention during the meal.

Will definitely recommend and be back again!"
Great Experience,I would recommend this place. Food is of good quality and taste great! I love the ambience too with good service
Team Lunch,"We had a nice experience at Sofra with our team lunch. Good food, nice ambience with attentive service. Dietary requirements of our team members have all been met. Thank you!"
Lunch with Family,Nice ambience ...Good service Front desk ...Waiters...cashier and staffs. I will reccomend your restaurant to my colleagues. Tks !
Sofra Turkish Cafe & Restaurant - Birthday Dinner,Really enjoyed the dinner on 12 Sep 2022 @ 7.30pm our party of 3 pax to celebrate a friend's birthday. The staff were friendly and gave good menu recommendation.
Good Service and food is delicious.,Went there for a business lunch. Good service and friendly staff who recommend a few dishes for 7 of us. The food is nicely presented and very delicious! Only find their dessert - round Konafe abit hard and dry this time round.
Full house but great experience nevertheless.,"Food were great. We specifically love the hummus; it’s a very good starter, and service was impeccable:) Thank you."
Lunch Birthday Celebration,"Service is great..Fast Service although restaurant also almost full house. Food serve still hot. Ambience was great. Has a nice view, facing Esplanades…view would be great in the evening time.."
A Must Dine In,"Excellent food with exemplary service as well as conveniently located.My wife and I had the meat platter for 2,baklava with mint tea and was extremely happy with the portion, taste and presentation.Even more impressive was the exemplary service by all the staff there who were kind,polite,patient and very attentive to us.We decided to return another day to try their turkish high tea which was equally superb!David T and Nora O-T"
Good and service are just beautiful,The food are well prepared and tasty. The service from the staffs are good and especially the boss who goes around tables to talk to the customers and elaborating on the dishes.
Awesome food,"This is my first time went to Sofra Turkish Cafe and Restaurant @Marina Square. Bring along my siblings n partners for dinner. The place was so nice. The food was excellent n yummy, we love it the service and staff to our satisfaction. Recommended for Turkish dish."
Review of Sofra,Food was amazing for those who love meat. Kunafe with ice cream is a must have. Restaurant is clean and comfy.
"Tasty food, Nice ambience, Good service","We had a outdoor seating on National Day. vantage point to watch the spectacular fireworks! We were there from 5.45pm. it was very sunny with the setting sun directly hitting us, very hot. will be good if the restaurant can install fans. food wise is overall good, the chicken on the skewer is somewhat hard and dry. i wish the chicken can be more tender."
Great food and great service!,Was with friends who have not had Turkish food before. They loved it and was really satisfied! A great place with friends. It was a Tad noisy but it was full of customers!
Sofra is superb!,Service is superb! Food was delicious! My boss loves how the place look. His first time having turkish cuisine and was I glad I brought him to Sofra!
Nt gng bk again!,"Most certainly not gng back to this place. Nothg wow to be honest. The service was very poor. We had to wave umpteen times to the crew on the floor. The food too was a disappointment with a hefty price tag. 2 items,2 drinks n a dessert came to $70."
"Excellent food, excellent view, excellent service","Excellent food, excellent view, excellent service. Good decision made by Sofra management to relocate and have halal cert. ❤️"
"Great view, ambience & food","Very nice view of Marina Bay- a hidden gem actually…they also have an olive tree & lemon growing around the restaurant…food is delicious, got the Jumbo Platter & Kunefe…couldn’t fault much, just wish the servers were abit more friendly & less nonchalant…otherwise, it was a great visit!"
Great food great atmosphere,We had a good time at Sofra. Awesome food and good service and we were lucky to be able to catch the dazzling fireworks from the NDP rehearsal. Simply awesome.
Good Food and Ambience,"Food are value for money. Need to improve on services.
At time, we do not understand what the waiter say."
Drop in standard,"The food standard has dropped tremendously. We were served with very hard pita bread to eat with hummus. The pilaf was also cold and tasteless. Only the meat had decent flavours. The other vegetables seem to taste as thought it has been left for long. This wasn't the same standard as my last visit, which was years ago."
First and definitly not the last experience!,"It was my first time to Sofra , so decided to make a last minute reservation . Rosalind assisted me with the booking and gave me a lovely table. Had a great view!

Food was quick to arrive , had lovely cosy gestures from the floor staff who assisted were super friendly.

The food portion was alot and it was too much for us to finish as a couple! Desserts were nice(tad too sweet for me) . Would reccommend the rice pudding!

Thank you Rosalind for this lovely dining experience ! Will definitly make another booking through you!"
Good Service,"Went for my friend's birthday, and indicated that it was my friend's birthday on the reservation. The service staff kindly helped to stick a candle to our ordered desert to celebrate my friend's birthday. Food was not bad."
Great place for dining !,"My first time here after their move, and it was not a disappointment. Bigger space, nicer views and the food is still that good. Special shoutout to our server Minth. Very attentivd and helpful !"
Brother wedding anniversary,"Food was amazing, and service was awesome too. If not for thier manager, we would have over-ordered our food.
Lynn whom I made my reservation, upon knowing it's a wedding anniversary celebration, she offered us the PDR!! Though we were a small group but the experience we had was surreal. Thank you Lynn and manager who took good care of our table, definitely we will be returning, 5 ****"
Food was fantastic!,The place was nice and food was exceptionally fantastic. My friends and I had an enjoyable evening. We will surely dine there again.
Sofra Visit,"1/4 of the menu food out of stock. Kunafe ice-cream taste like normal vanilla ice-cream..
Need to have better food choices.."
Amazing Experience of Food and Hospitality,"Love the food. It was extremely delicious and satisfying. It is a great place to hangout, be it business or casual night out with friends. The service staff will always be looking out if you need anything and super speed service. Will definitely come back and strongly recommended."
Drop of Standard,"Food served was not hot except for the bread. Bread was hard at the bottom and slightly burnt. The rest of the food seemed pre-prepared in advance. Most of the menu indicated as SOLD OUT. Very limited selection. Limitation time for dining (this was not indicated during booking). They only win on the view and atmosphere. Not worth the price. You can get warm food, tastier food at Arab Street and just go down to Esplanade for the view."
"Tasty food, nice view","Fast service by the counter staff and service staff. Food was served not long after we placed our order. Portion was big for 2 pax. Food was flavourful and was nicely plated. Very pleasd to sit right at the window where we had a view of MBS and Esplanade. Suitable more for family and friends gathering, as I find the restuarant a little too noisy for romantic date."
Below average standards,Visited the crowded restaurant last Saturday with some friends. Made a birthday cake but was informed that we couldn’t eat there as it is a halal restaurant. We were disappointed. Perhaps restaurant could make it clear on their website? Or allow customers to bring own paper cutleries? Food was so so as mussaka standard has dropped. There used to be more egg plants inside. Now it’s more cheesy.
A wonderful eating experience,"My group of 8 had a really enjoyable time at the restaurant. The food was great! My family member who had been to Turkey and loves to eat Turkish food at other restaurants, found that the standard of the food to be excellent as well. The beef and lamb were really tender. The service was great. We have only one request. That is, the restaurant provides the option of ordering meat without the rice and garnishes."
"The food, service and ambience was excellent","Every service staff who attended to us was courteous, patience and helpful. Excellent service!

The ambience was beautiful, tables and seats were clean too. We sat on the sofa seats. Cushions were clean. Wonderful!"
"The food was great, I loved the platters and the bread. But during the lunch time is quite noisy.",I liked the food and the service was good. The generous platters worth the price. During the lunch time was a bit noisy.
Best Most Authentic Traditional Künefe And Katmer!,"Best Most Authentic Traditional Künefe And Katmer! Super delicious, ultra tasty and dangerously enjoyable. We had a fantastic fabulous experience at Sofra Turkish Cafe & Restaurant. The environment here is wonderfully clean, neat, artfully designed with warm beautiful Turkey atmosphere. Staff here are extremely friendly, kind, patient, attentive and helpful. Very grateful and thankful to Bill for taking good care of us during our visit. We love Turkey ❤️"
Authentic Turkish,Enjoyed a variety of dishes at Sofra. The food and service was great. It’s good place to meet up with friends. The mixed grill did not disappoint
Usually Very Good,"I think we were unlucky on this specific visit.
We were allocated an outdoor table but I think this was unclear when I booked.
The break fast arrangement that was pre booked was also not ready on the table.
3 desserts were ordered and they never arrived at the table despite 2 to 3 reminders to the staff.
Again I think normally we have been very pleased with our visits and was just unlucky this time."
Adana Turkish Cuisine: A Unique Combination of Kebab and Pide,"I tried Adana kebab and cheese-tomato pide. The kebab was delicious but not as juicy as I had been expecting. The pide was crunchy and melted in my mouth. The staff was very attentive despite fasting, and the service was excellent and timely. I recommend trying the ice cream Kunefe."
Bad service racist attitude,"Used to love this place for last 10 years( from the time they were in Shaw towers), but recent bad experiences with horrible service, almost racist attitude and condescending behavior left a very bad after taste. Food is good but they spoilt my day. I am not sure if I want to come again."
Triple C!!,"Convenient, Comfortable and Competent! The foods we ordered were excellent from the main course right down to the dessert. Kiddos Sofra!!👏🏼👍🏼"
Turkish food basically everyone will like,"In short, the food quality was excellent to the point that even people who don't normally like this style of food will still find it nice. In particular, the kunefe, apple tea and jumbo kebab were great."
I was happy with the service provided. Very friendly staff easily approachable. The ambiance was just right for family.,"Service excellent, food was well serve & delicious. Staff were very assuring with the food recommendation. Great food, great staff & great ambience."
Lunch,Great food and ambience. Clean Friendly receptionist Rosalind. Good food. Book for reservation to avoid crowd during peak hours Recommended
Not so good experience,"I ordered a total of 4 dishes, the doner roll was decent, kebab (chicken) was salty, Pide was hard and the meat was very little,the dessert was supposed to serve with pistachio ice cream but the waiter didn’t told us it was sold out and he serve with dark chocolate ice cream. I order Tombik but was later told it was sold out and the waiter told me he will cancel the order however at the counter, when I was checking the bill the Tombik was not cancelled and the waitress ask me if I would want to cancel an order that did not come. well this pretty much sum up a not so good experience."
Great food at reasonable prices,Had a wonderful evening meal with my family of 5. We had a platter and several other dishes from their charcoal grill and hot stove oven selections for sharing. All was good and we enjoyed the food and the service. Recommended.
Really authentic food!,"There were so many options on the menu! The Sofra Kebab was really good - all the flavors just came together! The crispy exterior was very well done as well. Hummus was light and tasty. The rice pudding was not too sweet. Light and fluffy. A real delight. With the great outdoor view, definitely going back to try the other items on the menu!"
Wonderful 1st time!,"It was my 1st time at Sofra's and we totally had such a wonderful time there! The food, service, ambience & in short, everythig is perfect!"
Sofra Lunchtime,"We came as a family comprising 4 adults and 1 child. We ordered the Jumbo Kebab and a Pide kids' meal. It was more than enough for all of us (we're not very big eaters) and we were full. The kebab and pide were really tasty. We also ordered some drinks but the best thing was the baklava with turkish ice cream. We enjoyed that very much.

This would have been a four starred review if the service had been better. Servers appeared unfriendly. There was a massive lack of smiles. Do work on that aspect and make it a hapier environment for the staff. Because the management, culture and happiness of the staff is reflected in the way that they serve customers."
"Best Turkish food, returning again and again!","We have accidentally come across Sofra after day out with our 2.year old and we were delighted by place, food and service. Spacious restaurant including outdoor terrace, attentive staff and great fresh food, incl must try bread, kebabs and pakhlava! We keep on coming back again and again and never get dissappointed. Our must visit spot when in Marina Square! Thank you!"
Too expensive and Too little,"Staff were nice and guided my family and I to our table of 10 people. We first bough humus and bread as an appetizer for $10 but it was so little that it was really only for one person. Then we ordered the almost $100 kebab platter which was said to be ""perfect for four"" but was really only for 2 people. The food taste overall good just that the portions are unreasonable for the price you pay for. You can get the same quality of food at a cheaper price for even more at Arab street."
Ridiculous quantities and noisy,"What a surprise when I saw my plate. The quantity was ridiculous, comparing to the pictures on the restaurant's website. Although I ordered several drinks, a charcoal grill dish, and even a dessert, I was hungry when I left the restaurant.
Just to make things clear: I am not a guy who goes to the gym and needs a ton of food, I am a 30 year-old woman who eats normally.

The place is very noisy, there is even less noise in a hawker center. We had to yell to hear each other.

I am disappointed of my dinner at Sofra."
Great food.,"Good food but the place and feel was not as good as the old Beach Road one. The old location had a more romantic feel to it. Plus, honestly felt the old one had better food too."
Disappointing,"Had a dinner reservation. other than the beautiful ambience, food and service was really disappointing. The pilaf rice we had was half cooked/raw rice, they offered us fries, barley rice and bread. But they weren’t dishes that go well with our kebab platter we ordered. Kebab platter wasn’t fantastic either, meat was tough. Staff didn’t seem bothered about our disappointment when we voiced opinions. There wasn’t much dessert left to order as well. Not the best experience, will not be coming back"
Awesome value for money,Brought my family here for lunch on my mother's 70th birthday. She liked the food we ordered and the decor and ambience of the restaurant We will definitely come again.
Great food!,One of my favourite restaurant! Been going to them since their previous outlet! Highly recommended. Will be back again!
Post V Day,Nice ambience. Friendly staff. Great food. Had a great table facing the waterfront and sunset. Sizeable portions too
Dinner,"Authentic food and good service . Great view of the Marin bay, esplanade. Very open dining room, personally some potted plants would be lovely and add to a warmer ambience."
Rahmat's service was truly excellent!,My family and I had such a fantastic experience at Sofra on 4 Feb because of the excellent service provided by Rahmat! He was extremely attentive to us and went out of his way to make the dining experience so memorable! The food was definitely very sumptuous but it's because of Rahmat's professionalism n service that made the whole dining experience truly unforgettable! Thank you Rahmat for everything! We will definitely be back again!
Worth Every Cent,"The last time I patronised this restaurant was at her former location. This location, I must say, is a great improvement. It is spacious, and given the current situation, is ideal for patrons. The menu is available on an electronic device, which means all the wait staff need do is serve the dishes.

My dinner companion and I shared the Hummus with Bread. A great starter, though I did wish there were more than 2 pieces of bread. We next shared the Sesame Bread (Lavash), a puffy dough dish full of sesame seeds on top. It was light and delicate and we tried not to spill the seeds on the table. We next opted for the Musakka, a stew with meat (we chose chicken), eggplant and tomato, very tasty. Lastly, the Beyti Kebab, meat (chicken again) wrapped in pastry completed our meal.

Each dish was nicely presented and the service was non-intrusive. As one of the few Turkish restaurants I have tried, I will definitely return."
A horrible experience on CNY 2022,"Came here on 1st Feb 2022 around 6pm to order takeaway. I was told the restaurant was not accepting takeaway orders because the kitchen was busy fulfilling seated customers. I could understand but needless to say, I found that hard to believe. To check if it was true, i launched the Grab app and tried ordering. Sure enough, no issues ordering through Grab (self pickup). Order went in at 620pm, Grab said order will be ready by 645. Sure enough 646pm Grab says your order is ready. 650pm i came back to the restaurant to collect and I'm told the order wasn't ready. Lo and behold, there was another order on the counter from Food Panda that was being prepared. So I waited and waited and waited and finally at 715 I asked one of the staff, a Greek gentleman (really nice man) about the status of my order. He proceeds to ask the restaurant manager, a very unfriendly guy who, with much emotion expresses to him the kitchen was very busy. The restaurant funny enough was less busy than when I came at 6pm. After pressing for an estimated time for when my order would be ready, the Greek gentleman tells me, 10 more minutes. I sit back at the entrance patiently for the 10 minutes and at exactly 725pm the gentleman working at the entrance, also very unfriendly, comes with my bag. He does not hand it to me, but rather just places on the chair behind him for me to pickup when I was literally 3 steps away. He does not have the basic courtesy to say thanks (for the business) nor apologise for the delay, ie 40 mins later than when Grab said the food would be ready. Anyways, i think some of the staff need to go for basic customer and courtesy training. This is quite appalling. While Sofra is enjoying success and popularity, persistent bad customer service is a recipe for disaster. Either pick your hires better, or train them but pls do something about this.
It also seems puzzling to me that you would deny in-person takeaway orders but accept Grab/Food Panda orders that not only charge higher per item but I assume also take a commission fee? Anyways just made for an overall horrible experience and by the time I got home, the food was cold... Not exactly what I would want my patrons to go through if I was the owner."
Pretentious and Overpriced,"First time visiting Sofra (recommended by a friend for friends outing). Food choice was limited and overpriced although the food was good. I had a Peach drink which was $8.50 and it came in a small/medium glass while my friend had a lychee cooler which was $7 and their glass was bigger than mine. Another of my friend had a $3 tea which I think could atleast have come with a pot for refill. All of us had the same sentiment whereby we were still not feeling full after that lunch. We went to another place to have our early dinner. Overall, the whole vibe of that place was pretentious and food was overpriced. I can guarantee you that you can find a better Turkish place than this elsewhere."
Birthday Dinner,"Service was amazing, delicious food, huge portions, surprised sweet treat for my birthday from the team and even got a complimentary tea for the whole family. Overall everything was great. And definitely a beautiful atmosphere to dine in."
Compliments,Excellent food and wonderful service. Heartening to see the owner around speaking to guests and even serving them the food.
AMAZING 👍🏻,Everything was great. Food’s good. ambience is perfect. Pretty much what we expected. Amazing time spent there. Would definitely come again 👍🏻👍🏻
Very good Turkish Food.,"The food was excellent that it made me want to visit Turkey. The staff was friendly, helpful and gave good service. I was very impressed with the taste and texture of the dishes we ordered. Love the hummus and the Turkish salad. Simple and yet very enjoyable dish."
Sofra Review,"My family and I love the food! The main dishes, the turkish tea, the drinks especially desserts are very delicious. The interior is bright and pretty too! Would recommend it to my friends and will definitely eat there with my family again!"
Wonderful school reunion at Sofra,"I requested a quiet table via Chope and was pleasantly surprised to be assigned a wonderful table for our school reunion by the manager Mr Rahamat. It was in a quiet and cordoned off area of the restaurant facing the Marina Bay. Besides that, Mr Rahamat professionally recommended dishes to die for from the delicious appetisers to sumptuous desserts. He and his team came to check on us often to make sure we had all our needs taken care of. All in all, we had a splendid time at Sofra. Fantastic food and out of this world service."
"Good food, nice ambience but a little expensive.","The food was cooked to perfection, great service, nice ambience, though it was a little noisy from the other diners. Beware of the Baklava, it's very expensive for just 2 tiny pieces."
Delicious and Went The Extra Mile!,"We were first timers to Sofra and not only was the food and its portions phenomenal, what really took the cake was their service. We had a few allergy concerns which I highlighted in our reservation notes through Chope, and their Maître d gave me a call back to assure me that our concerns were noted and that he took special care to go through their menu to help inform our choices when we arrived. This he followed up with after we were seated and we were recommended a few dishes which we really loved! Thank you Ash and the entire team that made us feel welcome. Do visit with confidence!"
A Good Dinner,"We visited the restaurant on 3 Jan. Since it's our 1st time there, we weren't sure what we should order and how much is enough. Then a gentleman came to help us. He recommended some dishes we might want to order and we were pleased that we enjoyed what he has recommended. A very satisfying and delicious dinner."
Ending on a sweet note,"Beautiful Lemon tree greeted us at the entrance before we stepped into the warmly lit restaurant flooded with natural light.

For starters we had, Muhammara and Hummus.
The Muhammara was a tad too tart, spicy and lack its nutty taste, wasn’t subtly sweet too. Hummus was not too bad, think it’ll taste better with more Olive Oil drizzled over it.
We had Beef Pide, the meat was dry. We had 5 mains; Sultan Kebab, Shish Kebab, Shish Salmon, Meatball Grill and Chef’s Plate. The Lamb stew for the Sultan Kebab was dried out, the lamb wasn’t juicy and tender, the mashed Potato didn’t have a purée or fluffy texture. The rest of the meat for our main was very dry except the Shish Kebab.
We ended our meal with a sweet and cheesy Kunafe, ‘twas good!

This place is suitable for group or Family."
Still good after all these years,The food is still fantastic. We love going here. Nothing bad to say really. You cant go wrong by coming here. Lots of Turkish restaurants in SG nowadays but i say they set the standards. I dont fancy those Arab St ones with all that hustling.
Food and Service,"Service was good. The waitress, Noi patiently responded to our questions and recommended the popular dishes. The quality of food was good except that the kebab was bit too dry for us."
Best Cafe,"This is the best restaurant I've ever eaten at. No matter what I order, the cuisine is always top-notch, and I never have to worry about being disappointed. The service is excellent as well, with servers who are usually pleasant, helpful, and courteous. Looking forward to returning and recommending to anyone in need of a good meal.
With SOFRA, we're never disappointed when it comes to celebrating. Quality and flavor were excellent throughout my entire meal, from starter to dessert, making it one of the nicest meals I've had in my life. Everything about the experience was top-notch, from the food to the staff."
"Arrogant staff, average food but expensive","1. The staff directed us to the table but there wasnt any introduction nor friendly talk. We were left perplex over the ordering procedures.
2. Food was extremely average and for the price you pay, nah it aint worth it.
3. The counter staff who processed the bill didnt utter a word, printed the receipt, pointed at the bill. It was a passive aggressive approach to tell the customer to check the bill. You aint worth the service charge mate.

Overall, it was a bad experience where your craving for Mediterranean food wasnt met, but if you're immune to bad service through arrogant male bravado, bad food and dont mind splurging money, well, it still aint worth your previous time, money and self respect."
"Great food, great ambient",Great food we had on Christmas eve with family and relatives. The restaurant host was friendly and the restaurant ambient was cosy. Will come back again.
Lunch,Friendly and helpful staff. Food is delicious. Atmosphere relaxing. Have been to Sofra for the fourth time this year and would recommend to friends and family for a meal in your restaurant. Just one observation is that the air conditioning cold.
"Good food, nice ambience, friendly staff","Can't go wrong with the kind of food. Portion for 2 was good however, for drinks maybe can mention if it's gassy or not. My wife ordered the longan not knowing it was fizzy. We don't drink those and would had opted for non gassy ones instead. Food is close to dry but better than being too oily. However, food taste good so we thoroughly enjoyed it anyway."
Unique flavours and indescribable experience,The food all so yummy and unique. The texture and flavours were different than ordinary Asian Chinese cuisine for me. Need to get out of my comfort zone and explore more international cuisine.
