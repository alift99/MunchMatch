Nothing good here,"The restaurant is on the main street. That's the only thing positive about it.
The food - Disappointing. It lacked the flavors or the taste. We ordered a wide range of north indian cuisine and none was upto mark. The other restaurants that we tried on the same street were far better, you wouldnt feel you are eating outside India.
Service - This was the only place in singapore where people were far away from being polite and friendly.
It was as if they were doing a favour by giving us what we paid for !!

There are many many other restaurants on the same street who give far better food and service on this street. You can safely avoid this place."
Amazing naan and butter chicken…,"…but lacking elsewhere: the paneer makhani did not taste like it had been properly prepared as it just tasted of tomato basically, which was the case with the cauliflowers side dish too. The chicken tikka was another high point but that made the dry, bland fish tikka all the more disappointing. There were also a fair few flies around and the ordering system was very odd because the menu was not visible from where customers were expected to order from."
Good,I go with my frdz. Food is good but not india taste. But i food js very cheap compare to other indian shop. Hopefully nxt time food is nic
My review of jaggi,"Butter chicken was great. Kari pakoda, dal makhani and karahi paneer were also nice. It was over priced as the food quantity is quite less. You end up ordering more and thus the bill ends up on a higher side."
Good food and a local's go-to.,"This place was recommended to us by our Indian Grab driver. We asked him for a good place to eat near our hotel and this was where he told us to go.

The restaurant was in a place full of Indian restaurants, but we noticed that this is the most busy in the street. Locals (SG Indians) were going in and out of the place consistently the whole time we were there.

We were briefed by our Grab driver that we have to line up to choose our food, pay at the counter, and get a seat.

The was a line at the order area the whole time we were there. The table turnover was really fast.

The food was good, we loved the Palak -- we wanted to get Palak Paneer but they were out of cheese. The butter chicken was very good! Their samosa was packed and flavorful. The biryani was good too, The spices in all their dishes were not too overpowering or spicy, which is great for me, since I cannot handle anything too spicy. We also noticed that people were ordering A LOT of naan.

Overall, a very nice experience."
good buffet,some nice food and beer at Jaggis ... clean place and very close to MRT ... worth a visit for north indian food
"Comfort food! Authentic Punjabi cuisine, Breads made Fresh and HOT off the oven!","This is my new go-to place for when i'm homesick! It's got the holy trinity: 1. Great food, 2. Made Fresh (At least the breads are) and 3. CHEAP! I've been coming here or ordering takeout almost daily since i found this gem!

Been in Singapore for a half decade and regularly dine out at more expensive places like Khansama Tandoori down the street from Jaggis and though the food in the fancier places is 'good', it comes at a cost. Eating out/takeout everyday gets pretty expensive pretty fast.

I held out for a long time checking this place out seeing how cheap everything was priced and thinking to myself ""No way! They're probably skimping on something"". Boy was i wrong! The food here is just like ""Dhaba food"" back in India and the breads are made fresh to order with a GENEROUS splash of butter! The food is laid out buffet style at the counter and you walk up, call your order , pay and pick up.

If you're traveling solo, i'd recommend a couple of 'aloo kulchas', a few of the curries on display (Good choices are the chicken tikka masala or the paneer equivalent, you can choose a smaller serving if you want to try a few out or get a larger one, they have two sizes), a plate of pulao / white rice, a gulab jamoon , a samosa and a cup of masala tea. -> All this, under S$20!"
Dont waste money @ Jaggi,"This place is complete waste of money. Kopitiam indian counters food taste better then jaggi’s food. Ordered 6 dishes and all tasted blunt. Seems they are making fool of people by charging bit less and serving low grade food.
My sincere advice pls dont visit this place rather visit others which charge bit more but worth the money."
Very popular great food in canteen like buffet,"This place is very popular and once you've tried you'll understand. Although in buffet style, the food is really nice. Jaggi's offers great veg and non-veg food in a quite large set-up, also family-friendly. PS The samosas are the best in Singapore, so is the masala chai."
"Best for their Kadhi, Rumali and GJ","Best for their Kadhi, Rumali Roti , Chicken Tikkas and Gulab Jamuns . For snacks Samosas are outstanding . Paneer dishes and Black Dal simply average and need a overhaul"
Indian Food,We had our lunch here. The food is very good. Ambiance is good and place is maintained really very well. If asked they keep the spice level low which we asked for because of our children. We were in a hurry and they served us really quick.
Authentic North Indian Food,"Very real North Indian food. Excellent prices and a great variety of dishes. A great selection of rotis, parathas and chapatis. The chicken curry is very authentic and so is the mutton curry. Spice levels are of different categories and there is Lassi which is a probiotic which helps counter act the effect of spices."
Newly renovated and comfortable,"I have been going to Jaggis for about twenty years and they have grown by leaps and bounds. The newly renovated place - note that they have relocated to Race course road which Grab app doesn't show yet - is comfortable, modern and truly a delight to visit. It's clean and they have some pretty fancy wash basin.

The food remains AMAZING and the service very efficient. It's family run and trust me this is the BEST local punjabi food that you can get in Singapore."
"Good North-Indian fare, variety of tandoori snacks !","Authentic North Indian food, small portions to justify competitive pricing. Self-service restaurant. Take your pick from a variety of main-course/tandoori options, make the payment at the counter and enjoy the meal. India’s favorite Kingfisher beer served, too.
On a side note: The be-spectacled guy behind the cash counter doesn’t smile and can surely be a little more polite to their customers."
Sophisticated Self Service Restaurant,"Well, you can call it a sophisticated canteen or a fast food. Predominantly serves North Indian food, there isn’t a menu I could look for.

You walk in, look at various dishes (Eg: Dal, Curries) placed to your left, order everything In one go, collect the food, Pay the bill and wait for your Roti’s or Naan’s which you can pick when your pager buzzes.

Don’t even expect a staff to provide you the cutlery or drinking water. Highly priced for a self serviced canteen / fast food setting."
Food not that fresh or tasty.,"Food not that fresh or tasty. Given the high rating, my expectation was pretty high, but quite disappointing as a matter of fact"
Long-time favourite,"I make it a point to pay a visit to Jaggi's whenever I'm in Singapore. It's perfect for a no-frills lunch on a lazy Saturday (on Sundays, Little India is just too crowded for my taste). Their Aloo Gobi, Palak Paneer and green chicken are to die for. A cold Kingfisher beer tops it all off."
Tea after lunch,"We stopped off at Jaggi's for some tea after lunch at a nearby restaurant. Quite busy on a weekday lunchtime, but places were still available. Have to line up and order yourself which is a bit troublesome (no table service). Tea was ok."
This is one of the best Indian restaurant,"This is one of the best Indian restaurant, food served with authentic Indian taste. Food taste, quality, quantity and hygiene wise awesome restaurant. See you soon once again."
Two Words: Cheese Naan,Came here TWICE during our short trip to Singapore because it was so good. The Butter Chicken with the Cheese Naan was an incredible combo!
Missed out on Mutton Briyani,"Mutton Briyani is sometimes the yardstick by which people rate N Indian cuisine.
It was disappointing to be told on Friday last that only chicken briyani was available on weekdays and that mutton is served only on weekends and PHs.
As I was here just for a solo lunch, I tried the chicken briyani. It was passable. (Mutton, I'm sure, would have lifted the taste)."
Tasty and Budget friendly Food,"The food is tasty, cheap and the place is hygienic with a modern and sophisticated handwash machines.
The food arrives much faster and it's self-service.
The samosa is not quite to my taste.
The saag paneer, bhaingan Ka bartha and kadi is super yummy.
Aloo kulcha is the best among breads. Rumali Roti is quite tough and so is tandoori roti.
The staffs are warm and friendly. They are in no rush to take the order.
Overall, my favourite type of restaurant in little India. Definitely recommend and will visit often."
Indian Food,Good indian food restaurant Has both Non Vegetarian and Vegetarian options Maneer is the delicacy for Veg and Butter chicken for Non Veg. Self service restaurant.
Good lunch selection!,"This is one of the most crowded Indian lunch places in the area. The atmosphere might be a bit chaotic, however the smokey homely taste of everything here makes up for it. The food is delicious and truly brings out the North Indian flavor. They have added a self serve lane where you can order and pay at a kiosk, which really helped to reduce the waiting time. Apart from the standard roti/naan lunch items, their dessert selections are amazing as well, with Jalebis and gulab jamun. A definite must try restaurant."
Awesome restaurant,"I had been to this place along with friends, the food quality and taste was delicious. Price was reasonable.
In one liner I must say this is one of the fabulous Indian authentic restaurant in singapore.
Next time Will plan to visit along with family members."
Awesome place for Indian food seekers,"This is really a heaven on the earth for all Indians looking for Indian food in Singapore.
Located in Little India.
Extremely clean, hygienic and nice ambiance.
Owner and staff are very nice. Rates are also affordable.
Wash basin area has awesome and completely automated hand wash machines.
Bus stop and MRT stations are also nearby at walking distance. It's worth traveling from any place in Singapore to have a sumptuous meal.
I would really like to thank the restaurant owner for making our stay in Singapore quite easy when it comes to food.

Best items : chana masala, butter chapati, gulab jamun, butter chicken

Small Note : this restaurant offers veg as well as non-veg food. But storage is separate."
One of the best for Indian food,"I was in Singapore for 4 nights and my 2 dinners were here. My friend introduced me to this place. The food is light- like home cooked and tasty. Both vegetarian and non veg dishes were good. Aloo kulcha and pudina parantha were very tasty. Average meal is about S$17 per person, including a drink and tasty tea at the end..."
"One of the best , if not the best Indian food in SG","Today I was introduced to this amazing restaurant by two of my colleagues.. the quality of the good and taste was out of this world.. clean environment and you feel homely and taste of the food is like home made.
We have mutton curry , butter chicken, yellow Dahl, tempered eggplant, Bitterroots, 3 type of Indian bread (butter naan, tandoori roti, and one more type of bread) 2 pcs each and also 2 sweet Lassie.. for 3 of us to was only $50/- as well.. best value for money. It's not the cheapest place but best food.. this will be a regular place for me and my family for sure.."
Authentic Punjabi Cuisine,"One of the oldest restaurant at Race course road, which is recently renovated. Self Service. They do have a bar. Reasonably priced. Must try their, Pudina paratha, Chicken sheekh kebab and Masala Chai. Great taste."
Cold food and blame customer,"Hi

We have been going to Jaggis for fifteen years always liked their food
I went for dinner and found vegetables cold
And I informed the counter
Instead of taking feedback he mentioned that all other customers are eating and not complaining
So it was the customer which was a problem never experience such a bad treatment
Thank You"
Poor service and unsatisfactory food,"Came here with my buddies. Left this place feeling remorseful.

We were expecting great food due to recent positive reviews but it wasn't great at all.

Service was rushed as there was a line up. No smile. No thank you. Just give me your money and leave.

Witnessed workers giving a customer a hard time. Not cool. Neither was the food.

Better options in little India."
McDonalds of Indian restaurants in Singapore,"Quick and consistent food quality at reasonable rates. Reasonably good tasting North Indian food. Special vegetarian items are Kadhi, yellow dal and pindi chhole with pudina parantha."
Offensively impolite and deceiving + oversalted dishes,"The atmosphere here is cold and unwelcoming despite the clean look. My wife took the initiation to order some food for us but felt uncomfortable with the people serving the food. She asked me to order more for us as she felt rushed and pushed aside. So I did but I felt the same way too. I wish the recent reviewers would make note of this lack of friendly hospitality.

Not sure why would other reviewers gave this place a 4 star rating. Altogether we had 5 dishes. Each dish was incredibly salty and uninspiring. We could easily get those dishes at other Indian places with better taste and price. We were so disappointed.

This place is best if you wish to be bullied and having a constant salty mouth ( no we do not have any health issues at all.)

So disappointed.

Ps. Good news. Next day we went elsewhere and they greeted us with a gugantic smile. It sure does make a difference to our appetite."
Great Food,Very reasonably priced great food with plenty of options in the menu for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. Food tastes like home-cooked food and it such a great change from normal restaurants. I am a regular visitor and the place never disappoints. The only downside is it can get very busy so could be difficult to find a table.
Reasonable and very tasty North Indian,"Local here -I've eaten at most of the high end places over the past couple of years _ Punjab Grill, Rang Mahal, Song of India etc etc

Jaggi's has similar quality but at much, much better prices - the ambience is canteen style, with Cafeteria style serving - go to a counter and choose your dishes, small or large, and order your bread or rice. The food is not hot, hot - but it's ok when eaten with the piping hot breads made to order.

Keema Mutter - nicely spiced, with enough meat and gravy. peas a bit too over done.

Butter Chicken - might be the best bang for buck butter chicken - spicing is rich but delicate and the chicken breast in there is grilled but not overcooked

Chicken Tikka - 4 pieces of chicken - pudina, tandoor, garlic chicken heated up in a microwave. still tasty

Sheek Kebab - juicy kebab, also heated up in microwave

Dal -thick, comforting, spiced in the right way.

Aloo Gobi - more gobi, less aloo, spicing was good.

Sweet Lassi - refreshing, not that thick

Gulab Jamun - the best I've had, home made - washed down with the masala tea, it's perfect

Masala Tea - had to wait 30 minutes for this because they boiled a new pot - it's spicy, complex and rich - this is the chai you see in movies where you have one sip and feel at home

Palak Paneer - not the best - I've had it at lunch and it was nicer.

Garlic Butter Naan - superlative - warm, crisy, piping hot

Cheese Naan - great when cooled down, the cheese adds a rich creaminess

Chapathis - super fluffy and warm, tough choice between naans and chapathis."
GOOD FOR VEG,"Went for a vegetarian dinner on Monday 1st July. The choices were many and the food was to our taste. Some people gave me adverse remarks about the place, but we could not find anything adverse, starting from quality to service. Plan to visit again."
Terrible Dinner,"The food at Jaggis is very Singapore food court quality which is okay place to eat near your office if you are out of options but it is definitely not a good evening dinner place. On the day we ate the palak Paneer was sour definitely avoidable . The Kadi , Dahiwada and peas pulao are avoidable too. The black dal is decent ."
Lovely butter chicken,"Great food, lovely butter chicken and amazing garlic nan. Decent service and they also take cash and cards which is handy. Free tap water too."
Outstanding bread,The food is good and the breads are exceptional! The staff are friendly and will explain each dish. The butter chicken is very good as is their eggplant. The ambiance is basic and the prices are reasonable. I would go again.
Wow!,"I remember again why I loved north Indian food again.
The chicken gravy is so good and comfortable. Oh yeah and spicy. The eggs in gravy where great also. And my daughter told me her butter chicken was great also. And she is a novice tot Indian food.
Thanks guys. Love to come back."
Worst Food Ever I Had !!! Stay Away..,"I ordered puthuna roti and it came up burnt roti. The girl came to my table, kept the roti and went immediately. I want to give it back to them but no one turned up after that. So I had no choice as I was running late. The palak paneer I had is not even close to so called ""taste ok"", street food palak paneer is much better than Jaggi's. Worst food ever, won't come back here anymore."
Still super,"Jaggi's, a North Indian cafe in predominantly S.Indian Little India, is outstanding. We drop by at-least once a month to enjoy their hot chapathis and parathas, complemented by extremely tasty and authentic vegetarian curries, kadis, and dals, not forgetting scrumptious desserts. They also have several non-vegetarian choices, including staples like chicken tikka and tandoori. Order at the counter, the hot chapathis are served at the table.
Ambience is simple, but clean and spacious, and the staff are a friendly bunch. Unlike most N.Indian restaurants , their dishes are light (not too creamy), and easy on the pocket too.
Jaggi's has operated out of Chander Road for the last couple of years, but will move back to its Racecourse Road premises by the end of April 2019."
"Good food, fair prices","Situated besides Shree Lakshmi Narayana Temple, this restaurant serves authentic North Indian food at reasonably low price. Fairly enough clean, it has seating both outdoors and indoors. Serves beer with other soft drinks and Indian drinks. It doens't have table service, everyone is self served including water and cutlery. Food is good. Single serving is just good enough for one person. Must try gulab jamun."
Top notch Northern Indian delights,"My lovely wife and I were staying just around the corner from Jaggi's so decided to give them a try for dinner one evening. You order at the counter where they have a selection of a dozen or more dishes on offer including lots of vegetarian options. Portions are on the small side but so are prices so you can choose a variety of dishes safe in the knowledge that it won't break the bank. We ordered fish tikka, baigan bartha, palak paneer, channa dahl, makhani paneer and four tandoori roti which turned out to be just enough for two hungry people. The fish was the most expensive item at $6.40 with other dishes costing $3-$4 each. Everything was really really tasty. Possibly the best North Indian meal we've had in three months in SE Asia... and we've travelled extensively in India so know what we're talking about! We also shared a large bottle of Kingfisher bringing the total bill to around $37. If you're looking for a great value meal in Little India then look no further!"
There are better places,"Not particularly bad, but not great either. We went to this place because it was recommend in our tour guide book. But aincerely, there are cheaper and more tastier meals at open food court in Little India. Tapped water is for free here and the place has air conditioning, even though the place wasn't the coolest one."
Bad place.,Worst place ever. Food served is not even warm. No proper presentation. Worst taste. Quantity also not proper. Never visit again place.
Great food,"Simple set up, very traditional Indian food. I had a mutton curry and butter chicken which were absolutely delicious. The butter naan was great. The samosa was not so great. Definitely a good option for a quick meal. Feed 2 people for $32, including a beer.
Only 4 stars because it was a little pricey."
Comfort North Indian Food!,Great north Indian food at great prices. Can’t go wrong! Tandoori breads are hot off the oven and amazing. Will visit again!!
Good taste and lots of varieties,Reasonably priced. The great taste. The breads are really good. The owner and others who serve behave more like family. Very polite and courteous. I have visited many times and would go again and again. Highly recommend.
Scrumptious,"A north Indian food delight. They have a live kulcha, paratha, and naan counter. The chicken items don't disappoint you neither do the vegetarian items and the sweets are the icing on the cake!"
Great Nothern Indian food,"I can't get the address 37/39 Chander Road, when I was in Litle India and by accident popped in there. Staff is very friendly, and there were no other foreigners. Very easy, you make a selection of the dishes they prepared and for what I have chossen I must say great food."
Authentic North Indian Punjabi food made by Sikh family,"Being a north indian Punjabi I can review Punjabi cousins better than most! Food made by Jaggi family is even better than most restaurants in India and definitely better than all Indian restaurants selling North Indian Punjabi cousine.

We tried north indian cousine in almost all other places in Singapore and were still longing for that authentic taste we know so well and then we discovered Jaggi's restaurant.

The food ingredients, taste and service too is truly world-class. We didn't miss home food after discovering this restaurant."
Changed name or address is wrong...?,"We tried to go here but found another place a few doors down. Not sure if this was the right place, the address wasn't 142 but the photo of the front might be the same, apart from the paint colour and name. Anyway, if it is the same place, it was nice and packed with locals, which is a good sign."
Always good food,"Come here often and it is always very good, fast service, consistent very good food quality and nice staff. Clean and tidy, air conditioned, nice place to eat."
Deepawali Catering,Very helpfull and nice humble staff and very delicious food. Was enjoy by guests during the festive event. I will rate 101 over 10 101/10. Well done to all at Jaggi. Keep it up.
Best place for authentic Punjabi food in Singapore,"Most North Indian restaurants in Singapore are expensive yet average in quality. Jaggi's is the exact opposite. For decades, it has served wholesome North Indian food at a reasonable price."
Regular customers for several years,Easily the best North Indian restaurant in Singapore. Very authentic and wide range of food. Wide variety of dishes and breads. They have a 2 or 3 choices of Indian deserts. Service is fast and people are very courteous.
Good,Nice place for dinner. Order and pay upfront - self service. Lassi here was very good. We had simple roti and ordered some gravy. Rumali roti was very tasty as well. It is in the walk-able distance from the famous Indian Temple
Possibly my favourite restaurant in the world,"I realise this is a bold headline, but after eating at Jaggi's regularly for over 17 years and taking into consideration the taste, quality, consistency and price, this is my sincere conclusion.

The style might not be for everyone and the range of food is somewhat limited, but the advantage is everything is ready to serve, so you can order and eat right away. Of course the breads are made fresh, but always available fast.

The butter chicken and naan is definitely the best I've had anywhere. Other favourites include the keema, pilau rice, tandoori chicken, pepper stuffed with potato and aloo gobi.

Even their biryani is good.

I just had some bean and paneer dish, delicious.

If you like North Indian food, give Jaggis's a try."
Chander Road branch - tasty and popular,"I was introduced to this place by my brother in law. Instead of having table service, you order and pay at the counter, after perusing the food at the counter display.

We had na’an bread and chapati, chicken byrani, minced mutton korma and califlower. The food, done Punjabi style, was tasty without being too heavily spiced.

Prices were reasonable, as well. For two, including two line juices, the cost was just under $30.

The place was popular and there were crowds of locals and tourists during the lunch hour."
Homely Punjabi food at good prices.,"Its run by small punjabi family and they sell dishes on a per bowl basis. They precook 8-10 dishes (including 2-3 non-veg items) and also serve some dessert items like Gulab Jamun and Jalebi.

Rotis are cooked fresh.

We tried their Kadhi, Chicken gravy, Dal makhni with Rice and Lachha Parantha. In the end we had Gulab Jamuns.

Prices were reasonable and it was a very satisfying meal after a tiring day in Sentosa."
Far Below Expectations,"Prices are very fair, as a generous lunch for 3 cost us below $30, including drinks. We shared the following selection of dishes - CHICKEN DUM BIRYANI ( below average flavour,mushy rice, yoghurt dominant aroma and taste), SPINACH PUREE WITH PANEER CUBES( hard, dry paneer, flavourless spinach puree), SPICED EGGPLANT PUREE(too sour), BUTTER CHICKEN(the best dish - well balanced flavour and spice, tender chicken, good sauce consistency), SPICED BITTERGOURD WITH POTATOES (very average tasting, but on a positive note, the bitterness was well controlled), NAAN, PLAIN AND GARLIC ( second best dish- tender, thin and fluffy, not overpowered by garlic) VADAI(below average-doughy and bland tasting).The MASALA CHA was pleasant - delicately spiced, not overly tannic, with just the right amount of milk. Generally, the food tasted as if the spicing and seasoning had been watered down, either to cut costs or in an attempt to appeal to whoever Jaggi's thinks is its target market. I'm lucky enough to have had wonderful home cooked northern Indian meals, prepared by mothers of my Punjabi and Sindhi friends. After the high praise I've heard sung, time and again,about Jaggi's, my lunch there was a waste of precious calories and an abject disappointment. Two good dishes out of seven, just does not cut it."
north Indian food,"Visited Jaggis today after a long time. Some items like the naan, roti, dry mutton and tandoori chicken were tasty as always. Portions are a tad small for the price. Lunch for 4 of us cost around S$55 The place is quite clean and service is always with a smile.
The aloo parantha and palak paneer was a let down.
And ladies going after manicure please note that eating with your hands might cost you another trip to do a manicure."
good home cooked Indian with fresh rotis,"Super low key and self serve. The food is very cost effective and extremely yummy. Not too spicy, but not bland either. Always has a nice mix of kebabs, non-vegetarian and vegetarian dishes. The samosas are not bad either. The best part are the fresh roti's all types especially romali, laccha and naan's from the handi. A must visit, if you are looking for good, cost effective, home cooked Indian food. If you are looking for fine dining, this is not the place, however the food quality does compare :)"
standard not as good as before?,"Used to frequent Jaggi's for many years, and went back recently. However found that the portion sizes are now smaller, prices have increased, and the food is not as authentic. The rice was normal Thai jasmine rice, for example instead of basmati which i would have preferred. being smack in the middle of little india, wonder how they are able to compete with all the quality restaurants around the area."
Yum Punjabi food,Jaggi always the best good quality parathas and subzis . And Jalebi yum yum . Authentic Punjabi food maintains the taste and legacy for decades . Go for it
Absolutely delicious!,"Everything we had at this place was spectacular! Didn't expect it to be so casual, and I personally loved that. It's a buffet-style space with communal tables and the most delicious food. Nothing fancy here; just good old Indian eats. From beginning to end, the meal was spectacular!"
Interesting North Indian Food,"Went for dinner, simple decor, food was nice, but pricing was a little pricy. I had Garlic Nan, tandoori chicken, palak paneer (green spinach with vegetarian cheese) and sweet lassi. Overall nice experience"
Really Delicious. Best butter chicken ever!,Brought my chinese friend here to introduce her to Indian food. She loved the Butter Chicken it was really really good. Their gulab jamun is also delish! Food wasnt spicy at all would totally reccommend to all my friends
Simple and Tasty food,"My title mentioned Simple! because i have never seen a menu card in Jaggi's. What they serve is clearly available on display. The food is fresh, tasty and light. Love to keep going back again and again!"
"Great, authentic north indian food in Singapore","While not the cheapest, this place was so good we ate here twice during our stay. The mutton curry is so so but the kebabs and chicken currys and vegetarian dishes were fantastic and wonderfully spiced. Not for those who cant handle heat. Would absolutely recommend coming here."
Reasonable,"The place serves reasonable priced food compared to other places . Serve fresh hot food , The ambiance is not so good but do not judge by it"
Fresh and lovely!!,"Simple order over the counter and self service place. All the tandoor dishes were really fresh and tasty. The prata and naans were served really fast and fresh.

Not the place to look for ambience but overall good food. Reasonably priced and probably my favorite North Indian place."
Excellent Indian food,"Come here everytime i am in Singapore in the last 13 years and it never disappoint. Ate many places in the world, they have the best chicken tikka by far.."
Great northern Indian Meal,"Great staff, amazing massala and Rogan josh- really loved the garlic naan and great drink selection. Very authentic and great part of Little India!"
Great for a quick bite,This is a great place for taking away some tasty north Indian food. The decor is pretty basic but was clean and comfortable. This is a good place if you are on a budget as the food is very reasonably priced.
Early dinner,"Amazing food and very good value
You need to know your Indian dishes as there are no menus, TIP review online prior to visit
Self service, choose your dishes at the counter, pay and take your tray to a table to eat
Simple but very effective"
Nice Indian Food,Enjoyed the curry and tandori chicken. Ordered the garlic naan and thought it would be better if the garlic taste was stronger. Ordered coffee too; was nice.
Average food,"Have been here few times, thinking this time food will be good and result is same, got disappointed every time"
simple indulgence,"friend recommended this place. it's in the heart of little india, we walked past streets and rows of shop houses. the restaurant is moderate in size, with outside seating. it is clean and the trays of food are very appealing. although there are no names, I guess you could ask the uncle. my friend who has been there numerous times ordered the dishes. for 2 persons, we had 5 types of chicken dishes, a yogurt dish, a cauliflower dish and another vegetable dish. plus a pototo nann and a roti. all the helpings are in small plates, so it may take a lot of self control to not over order. I just ate what was ordered and it was all very delicious ! it is self service, you pay at the counter and carry your trays of food to your table. i have a fondness for north indian food, so may return to try the other stuff."
Simple yet tasty food!,"The third time we went here in 2 months - and went away satisfied! Palak paneer, kadi pakoda and freshly made chapatis and pudina paratha- we really enjoyed it. It is NOT a fancy place- its self service and the folks are helpful when you ask what's available. If you want decent quality tasty home cooked style North Indian food in a simple setting- this is the place to go"
"Excellent and affordable, but no names on anything!","Went here yesterday. I really like indian food, but I still don't know many dishes by their names. The place has no menu or labels on the food displayed. So you will have to order by looks. If it's busy it can be troublesome to ask what is what.

However, since I was in company of desi people they ordered for me. Delicious paneer, potato-naan, and many other things I cannot describe.
About half the options are veg.

Naan comes fresh from tandoor super delicious. Some things are reheated in a microwave, but tastes awesome.

Price is afforable, water from a jug and you have to get cutlery from a sidetable.

We spent about 15$ per person, but we ate A LOT with some leftovers."
Hawker style North Indian Restaurant,"So finally visited this place. It has moved to new location next to the Laxminaryan temple on Chander Road. This is more like upmarket hawker style restaurant . Since the food is pre cooked and displayed and all you need to do is order the dishes from the showcased pre cooked Menu. Everything is self service here. So don't expect to be served on your table except for Roti.We ordered some veg dishes like chana , mix Veg and palak paneer, daal and Roti. Channa seemed to be stale. Mix Veg was quite good. Palak paneer was okay with small 1-2 pieces of paneer. Overall the meal for two cost is 22+ SGD. it was a Saturday lunch time and I was looking for a good meal but I was bit disappointed. May be cause I came with high expectation. Anyways this place is good option if you want a quick meal. I didn't try their Non Veg. It looked good especially their butter chicken. I shall visit this place next only for Non Veg food and see how it goes."
"Authentic Indian food, good and efficient service, clean place","We came across this restaurant accidentally while sightseeing Little India. From the outside, we saw lots of Indians and foreigners alike. The food was displayed on a buffet and the waiter was kind enough to give us a simplified translation of the food. We had channa masala (chickpea curry), cheese curry, rice and roti. Highly recommended."
Awesome Punjabi Food,"Love their Chana, Dahi wada and Palak paneer/saag. What makes the meal perfect is they serve hot and crispy rotis. And the prices are affordable as well, they used to serve food at Changi Signature building and I was regular there but now that they have closed, I have been to their restaurant near raffles place but they don't have much space there and it gets really hot and suffocated to sit and have lunch. But the quality of food is same. I am hoping race course road will has the same taste and quality of food."
Microwaved!!,"Naans and Rotis are freshly baked. They have a good selection of tandoori meat, gravies, and curries. Their butter chicken is amazingly delicious and creamy. But unfortunately, most dishes, especially the tandoori meat are microwaved just behind the food counter before serving. Reheating a dish tends to give you the uncertainty on the freshness of the food and when it was last cooked. The portions are small, and pricey. But other than that, the food is delicious."
Truly Northern Indian!,"I looked forward to finally trying Jaggi's, which was recommended by a friend. The dishes offered are authentic North Indian. The tandoori dishes are very appealing in appearance, some of the best I've seen in Singapore. However, my anticipation was soon let down when the waiter placed the chicken tikka in the microwave. Perhaps some do not mind the usage of the microwave because the tandoori dishes are already prepared but need to be warmed up. However, it sends a loud message to the customer about the quality of the food preparation. Microwave ovens should never be used unless it is considered fast food and I hope Jaggi's is able to make the change. I enjoyed the vegetable korma, the garlic naan and chapati are superb and made fresh. Don't forget the mango lassi! Except for the microwave usage, I highly recommend Jaggi's."
"High in price, medium in taste, but perfect location.","This review is for the AXA tower location.

Location trumps taste by a stretch in this little joint. This place is certified B, and they take that very seriously. Day old panneer is pretty standard. Being a vegetarian the choice is quite limited and quite pricey for small portions. But for its perfect location I would not recommend it at all. The owner is quite rude with customers. Do not go in for taste, service, or price, go for the convenient location for those working near Tanjong Pagar."
"Excellent, unassuming place to have a meal","this place changed locations over the past 5-6 years, across lanes in the same vicinity....but it is one joint you shld not miss visiting, esp if you are a visiting Indian and want to taste some authentic Indian food. They pretty much have a authentic Punjabi fare, with Naans, Rotis and Parathas (weekends), some very good subzis including Paneer, Channa, Aloo Gobi, and the Daal accompaniments including yellow and black both. Do try the Green pepper OR Bitter Gourd kebabs as well - extremely well made most of the time. This is an amazing place, rightly priced and very fast in serving. I have reviewed only the Vegetarian cuisine as I am a hardcore Veggie, but am more than sure from what i see around inside this place, the Non-vegetarian is just as great if not better."
Your Best choice For Indian Food in Singapore.,"One of my relative recommended this place to us and we decided to go here.

From out side you will not realize that this will be the place to eat and get good food. But when you go in and have food you will realize it.

They have both veg and non-veg good choices. Taste is excellent with good home made kind of touch. They offer some sweet dish as well. Serve you hot Chapati/Roti which is assume.

Prices wise also it is very good.

For our stay of 5 days , we visited this place 3 times.
I must mention. In our group couple of friends got slipped and the food felt down. Owner was kind enough not to charge for that food.

Highly recommended if you are in Singapore Tour. If you are in group , then this is your choice."
Great Indian Food,"Delicious dhaba style North Indian food with affordable price. I have been frequent traveler to Singapore for business trip and for dinner I always come here. This is not just favourite amongst Indian people, but I have seen local people coming here in good numbers."
Good price and great food,"You order at the counter and get served some delicious Indian food. I am always on the lookout for good naan, which they make when you order. The butter chicken was excellent and well spiced. The portions aren't huge, but what I had filled me up."
Authentic punjabi food,"good, authentic Punjabi food. The potion is quite less though. One looking for fine dining may look for other places. The non veg food is quite tasty and has authentic taste,"
Punjabi khana ka asli maza,The branch outlet at CBD prompted me to go to the main outlet in Little India for lunch . Definitely it was not a disappointment and the food was definitely worth the money . Very pocket friendly it was truly authentic North Indian. Not a great ambience but best if you are looking for good food
You wont miss home cooked food,"Every time i visit Singapore i make sure i visit Jaggi's. One of the oldest Indian restaurant in Singapore. When you are jet lagged and off your flight & confused with what to eat visit Jaggi's and you will get home style cooked food. Delicious and super quality food PLUS value for money meal. We spent around SGD 26 and had pretty much everything on table enough for 2 adults one 4 yr old child + over eating ; )
They are not located at the address mentioned just behind this street mentioned though."
Delicious,"We recently had lunch here, it had a good variety to pick from at the front counter and they make your rotis and naan to order. The food was delicious and very tasty. The service and ambience was average, water was available at the counters (self service)."
Where the service is as lukewarm as the food,"First off, Jaggi's has moved to Chander Road. I've heard so much about Jaggi's from my Indian expat friends who come here for their ""comfort food"". Quite frankly, the food itself isn't that bad. What disappointed me the most was how frequently the microwave oven, which is right behind the food warmers was used. We ordered Naan, which was made fresh but dishes like Mutton Keema, Aloo Gobi were all served lukewarm. I ordered lamb kebabs, and it went straight into the microwave oven.I had assumed the tandoori chicken would be freshly made, but alas that too went into the microwave. For the prices we paid, which was pretty close to a fine-dining restaurant I had certainly hoped for better. Perhaps Jaggi's should rename itself as Jaggi's Microwave Cuisine!"
Amazing and tasty food,"I use to go there whenever i got chance for meal. Best place for north Indian food. Paratha , daal , naan everything was delicious on affordable price. Very good service too. Opening more branches soon. Keep it up."
"Some good dishes, while some are underwhelming! Good customer service though!","We tried some of my favourite punjabi dishes and a few new ones. First of all I will start with the better dishes. The vegetable korma is excellent, and the aloo gobi and pindi cholle is very good. I usually eat peshwari naan bread (a Pakistani naan bread) when available, but I was recommended the kashmiri (dried fruit) naan as it is northern Indian cuisine. We were happy with the recommendation because it was delicious. The only dishes that disappointed us were the pilau rice and butter chicken dishes. I think they were average at best as I've eaten these dishes in many restaurants. Overall the food is a 3.5/5 and I would happily eat here again.
I would recommend to try the dishes we enjoyed and just avoid the butter chicken dish. The curry was very thin and it had a soup like texture.
The staff were very friendly and I enjoyed talking about different Asian cuisine with them. I would say that it is good value for money for lunch, and I'm not sure about the dinner service. Maybe we will try dinner next time we visit Singapore."
Delicious chicken kebab and tikka masala!,"How lucky that we found this place. The food was really good, tasty and spicy enough to still enjoy it . Nicely served and fresh. If I had the chance, I would come back to eat here. Note: We are from USA and we are used to eat indian food every week."
