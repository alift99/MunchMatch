Inattentive wait staff,"Lacking in cheerful disposition which will certainly add to the dining experience. My fellow diner from overseas asked why are they not train to at least smile, introduce themselves and say how May I help you today? To that my only answer was, they are not customers oriented and probably no interest in serving and it’s just another job. No passion to wait tables."
Food n service,Ps cafe review: food was fantastic.Staff service was excellent too. However the pasta that we order was not so great.
Best Food & Service in Singapore,"This is one of our favourite restaurants, excellent food quality and quantity, good beverage selection, superb service and awesome location. There are no reservations, walk in’s only, however the staff do an incredible job of managing this and making you feel very welcome. We return here every time we are in Singapore."
Food and environment is good,"The fish & chip is always good. The fish is fresh snapper. The branch at Paragon doesn't have mee goreng which is very delicious too. Asked a waiter is there mee goreng but get a not very friendly reply. Bur guess is busy dinner time, so no patience to answer me.
But the cafe is always the place I will go to for gathering dinner."
Improve customer service,"1st service staff Cheryl who came to serve us needs to relearn her customer service skills, subsequent lady staff/young gentleman who served my table were very friendly and helpful"
Decent food but lousy service,The food is always decent but the service is horrible. Slow service and really poor interaction between the staff is horrible. Waited 30 minutes for our drinks to arrive
Poor Service,"Service was slow although there seemed to be enough staff. May not be the case. We waited about an hour for our order to arrive, only to find out later that the order was not even keyed in. It was a business meeting so it was embarrassing as a host. My guests only ordered hot drinks and some starters. I was a fan of PS Cafe, and had always had pleasant experience. It could possibly be a manpower crunch issue. Dont know."
Yummy dinner,"Had dinner with my husband at the Paragon outlet. We had the veggie pasta each and English breakfast tea. Service was prompt, food yummy and restaurant staff very friendly and attentive. Kudos to the team. Will make another trip when time permits, cheers!"
Nice cafe for snacking,"Been to Paragon many times, but this is the first time I tried this cafe. I like it. It's a nice place to chill between shopping.

I love the ambience and the black window. The way they served french fries is interesting!
Enjoy eating it!

Will be back here again the next time I come back to Singapore."
Brunch,1 of a nice places to have a brunch! Reservation is encouraged as the place will tended to be crowded.
Great Food,"The food I ordered was excellent. However, I waited for a long time before it was served. The ambiance of this cafe is Instagrammable."
"Bright, comfy, great food and service in the heart of Orchard Road","I have been patron of PS Cafe since its beginning and dined at most of their locations, but this one has remained my favourite. Its location does mean it's sometimes not available for walk-ins or reservations, but its change to a brighter interior from the grungy past suits Paragon's changing clientele too. The menu is still terrific and food quality is all tops, even if you are just there for pastries and beverages. Had a terrific spot in the corner for a key business meeting which I didn't want there thinking it would be too noisy, but it turned out perfect. The service crew were excellent: I usually get their names and leave an additional tip, but being preoccupied with the business at hand, I didn't this time. There will be a next."
NO pant-based/Vegan Options,"It’s disappointing that a trendy, contemporary cafe like PS has not made the effort to have even 1 vegan option in their extensive menu. There were a few vegetarian dishes but they all had dairy/cheese and/or egg. I hope they try to be more inclusive and thoughtful in future.
What is the point of having an Impossible meat burger but filling it with cheese and Mayo and buttered buns?"
Food is good but service is so so,"The food is very good, truffle fries is the best, black out cake could have more chocolate fudge. However, should improve on their service level. I have two tables, they clear and clean one table, left the other uncleaned. Call the service staff to clear the table, she clear but doesn’t clean it, so have to call again. Because we are having dessert after meal, prefers a clean and clear table."
Great service :),"Food was good and truffle fries are delicious as usual! Love the service by the manager, Max. He was attentive, friendly and was served by him promptly :)"
Compliment,Good experience great ambience only our truffle fries order was delayed almost 45 minutes. Apart from everything PS cafe never disappoint in terms of quality of the menu .
Good food,"Had aglio olio, portion was generous and very tasty, although albeit quite oily.
Price wise on the more high end side (Mines was $30)."
Nice ambience and the food portion was pretty big,"We had a nice cosy corner for the 8 of us. However, the volume for the pipe-in music can be lowered and instead of 4 round small tables, it may be better to have 4 square table for us to share our food. It was difficult to share the food with the round tables combined together."
a casual dining place,I would rate the value as $$$. They are friendly and each reservation allowed up to 90-min. Service staff would repeat your order and helped to fill mineral water before the meal is served
Dinner with the girls,We had an enjoyable and delicious dinner. Booking reservation via Chope is so easy and convenient. A little bit busy when we went to the restaurant on a Friday night though. Every else is perfect.
Not worth the price,"I ordered the crab tart main, and the crust was thick and tasteless, meat was dry. Ps burger meat was dry too. Mushroom soup was acceptable. When we left with many left over food, Waiter didnt even bother to ask if there is any issue. We paid and simply left."
Experience at PS Cafe Paragon,It has being a great experience at PS Cafe Paragon. The food served was excellent and the services were great.
Relaxing Dinner,Decent food and great service. Service staff attentive but food feels a bit short of expectations. But overall good time.
Very very good,Food was really good. We had fish&chips and chicken schnitzel burger and all was delicious and fresh. Nice and all time smiling staff. Certainly to come back again.
New year Eve,Not happy about being seated outside the restaurant when I have made the reservation early. The special menus are not readily available but we are requested to walk to the board outside and take a look. Staff forgotten our soup order and so we cancelled. Other staff were attentive and offered us drinks consistently. I'm not very impressed overall so might not return. Food quality comparable to other P.s outlets.
Friendly staff and food was great,The staff was really helpful as she notice it’s just me and boy. We ordered 2 plates of pasta and truffle fries s she suggested that we ordered a half size serving of Truffle fries.
A good place to chill,"Been at PS Cafe Paragon, the environment is good to chill after long hours of shopping. Quality of service is superb especially Jess, who recommended a very nice drink for me and didnt disappoint. Thanks Jess!"
Quick Brunch,"I went to PS cafe Paragon last Sunday for a quick brunch. I thought of having something while waiting for the time to pass. I was served with your staff named Jess, she recommended me drinks as I want something refreshing. I thought of having virgin mojito but wasn’t in the menu. She asked me to try the lime and soda, and it was indeed a refreshing one. Thanks Jess for quenching my thirst!

After my meal, I ordered the banana butterscotch dessert. It was heaven!

I would definitely recommend this place to my friends to try.

A shoutout to the manager, Max, for giving such a friendly vibe! He has the warmest and sincerest smile ever!"
"Great food, Great service, but they burnt the coffee","Great food man legit, the pasta is out of this world. The desserts are out of this world. The service is also great, they provide you with all the attention that you lack at home. However, the biggest disappointment is the coffee. Ordered an espresso and they burnt it. But i'll still come here no matter what. :p

Thanks to Cheryl for serving us!"
Awesome!,Very friendly service staff who helped to make our lil birthday celebration special despite all the regulations....thank you!
dinner at paragon ps,Great and attentive service!!! ordered the pad thai salad for 2 and the portions were huge and filling. the staff is friendly too.
"Good food, great service",Superfood salad and truffle impossible burger are missed bigtime so we have to order this again. Kevin’s extremely helpful
Good Experience,The food selection was good. The service staff were excellent. The ambience was good providing opportunities for good conversations
Best brunch ever,Best brunch with peaceful atmosphere. Big breakfast are big portion to start off the day with the best iced latte. Friendly staff entertained to my dining needs.
Lunch get together,"Great service and the food was excellent! The atmosphere was perfect for my friends and I to chat and connect.

I had the Pad Thai salad which is my favourite but I wish they had gluten free bread so that I can have the sandwiches too!"
Amazing Service & Decadent Foods,"My family was here for dinner and as always, the food was amazing. What really impressed was the warm and personable service provided by one of the managers, Kacy. Kudos for your amazing heart for service, Kacy!"
Family gathering,Good service by the staff! I will definitely visit the cafe again with my friends. I love the deco too!
Tea Time,It was a great experience. Thank you to Cherry for serving us! Great service and great food! Highly recommend. Fast and friendly!
Disappointing service,"Food was good but service was disappointing. Had to request for chilli sauce 3 times, water was not refilled and the staff brought us the wrong dessert. Called to increase our reservation by one person and they told us they had limited 5-chair seating so only 4 of us went. When we arrived, we were placed at a table with 5 chairs. There were at least another 4 tables with 5 chairs. I wonder why the disconnect and disappointing service this time round!!??"
Excellent service by Ms Jess,The place is awesome! Ms Jess was so lovely - thanks a lot for her great service! We really enjoyed our dinner!
Awesome experience!,Thanks so much Jess for attending to our table and being very attentive!!! Appreciate it so much!!! We had so much fun during our dinner
Great service and ambiance,"The place was great with the staff being so friendly with us throughout the whole time and the place is just peaceful and quiet during the weekday evening, it’s just nice. The food was also great especially their signature burger with the sauce on the side, I really loved their sticky date pudding also and it’s recommended to share the dessert cause the portion is quite generous!"
"Good service, good ambience, good food",Service was excellent by Karen. Friendly and professional. Ambiance was fantastic with modern industrial atmosphere. Food was amazing. Chocolate doorstop for dessert is highly recommended.
Overpriced,"For the price, can get better quality and tastier food. Not recommended. Staff was only interested to clear the table in order to knock off on time."
Good Service and Clean Environment,"A cafe that has implemented good safe distancing measures and a clean environment. The service provided by the staff was good.
The food, however, was not up to our expectations especially for the price paid. We ordered their popular pasta - King prawn Aglio Olio. It was a little too garlicky and lacked salt. But their dessert lemon pie was good."
Understaffed,"This is not a bad review. Food was good and the atmosphere is always pleasant at PS. Cafe Paragon.

This review is to make light that this branch seems to be severely under-staffed.

I have been here 3 times. And on these occasions, the staff have always been hurried, running around, struggling to ""see"" my raised arm for a request. I have been left standing at the reception area, with no staff in sight though there were empty tables around.

Not a complaint but it is just a feedback and highlight. I have no qualms about the service levels, I think they are doing the best they can."
DEFINITELY WORTH THE VISIT,"Heard a lot reviews from friends about PS Cafe and decided to give it a try today. All the service staffs on shift were very friendly and efficient. Special thanks to Aishah's attentiveness and prompt service, despite it was really busy. Food was prepared efficiently as well, it wasn't even up to 15 minutes of waiting and our orders were out, hot on plate. No regrets trying and would definitely visit again!! Thank you to the whole team on shift!!"
Great,Staff there was very friendly and welcoming. The food was excellent! Special thanks to our servers Dayls and Aishah (not sure if we got their name right) despite them fasting they were still efficient and prompt in serving us. Keep up the good work! :-)
Fries was the only highlight,"Never order the steak frites, the steak and sauce was tasteless. Red velvet cake was ok but overall too pricey for the quality"
"Great Experience. Good Food, Good Service","Really accommodative to my reservation, we managed to grab our seats quick. Food didn't take too long to be served after ordering. The service staff even helped with my request to add a candle for my cake as it was a birthday celebration."
Worst ever service,"Clearly a place that does not need your custom. Allows me to wait without acknowledging me for 5 min. Any staff I greet turns around without offering any help. Although the place is half empty, all the tables are booked. PS cafe does not need more customers. Simply avoid their outlets."
Always great food and happy experience,It is my Nth visit to PS Cafe and me and my family always have the same experience. Great food and most of all happy experience.
Excellent food but service can be improved,"We shared a superfood salad, a beer-battered fish and chips, and a flourless orange cake. We really enjoyed the food. However, our dining experience was marred by the staff trying to chase us away. At 8 plus, they told us last order. At 9pm, they told us our section is closing in 15 minutes. At 9.10pm, they gave us the bill although we hadn't asked for it. It was pretty annoying."
Dinner date,"Went for dinner on Saturday, upon arrival there was a snaking queue. Be sure to have a booking to skip it. Ordered truffle fries, the Cesar salad with chicken, and the prawn agio olio. The pasta was served cold, it doesn’t taste like it was cooked upon order but left out for a bit before serving. The truffle fries’ portion was huge and delicious. The Cesar salad was really good too but a salad is a salad, it was a tad overpriced, about 30$ with the chicken. We ordered the sticky date pudding which was by far the best dish of the night I will highly recommend it. The warm pudding with caramel and vanilla ice cream pairs heavenly.
Overall it was a pleasant experience, wouldn’t come back for dinner, maybe brunch, but would definitely come back for the desserts."
Big Fan of PS's Impossible Burger,"PS Cafe is one of my favourite restaurants for the Impossible Plant Base Burger.
Although i hv tried the same in other restaurants, PS.Cafe's version is still one of the best.

I visited @Paragon branch on Saturday & the burger & french fried was as delicious as ever. Service was fast & impecable.
The price is on the higher end & as expensive as PS's wagyu burger but is worth every penny :)

Although i was full, i could not resist the banana chocolate cheesecake too.
I am pretty sure i had burst my calories intake for the day but it was worth it.
I will definately be back.

Regards
MLLEONG

nice food buy bad service,the food and environment also very nice. but the service quite bad. The price of food also very pricey.
PS Cafe at Paragon,We had a great time at the cafe. Waitresses were helpful and chatty with the customers. Food was pretty good but variety was a bit limited at this branch.
The standard of the food drop drastically.,The truffle fries was served lukewarm. The steak is also only room temp warm which was very disappointing. Service is good but the standard and quality of food dropped a lot. Not worth visiting.
Zalina is a star,"We were brought to our table by Zalina and throughout our dining, she has been very thoughtful and welcoming and serving with zest and passion. Our dinner experience has been enhanced so much by her."
"Good food, food service.","My friend & I was served by a very friendly staff there. Unfortunately, I didn't get her name. The service from her made the experience even better on top of the good food. Pasta portion was pretty big and thankfully with her suggestion, 1 portion was prepared and split into 2 portions for us. The appetizer special was Grilled Cheese toasties in Tomato soup. Loved the toastie, though it would be good if the portion was bigger. Would be good as a permanent menu! Will definitely love to visit again!"
Double Chocolate Blackout Cake,I treated myself to their Double Chocolate Blackout Cake and an Iced Chocolate. It's a great way to unwind when you're in Orchard Road and been shopping the whole day. Their Truffle Fries is also a must-have - you will never regret ordering a plate of it and having it all to yourself!
Friendly Staffs,"A nice and cozy restaurant and warm welcoming, followed by an excellent service, with attentive staff to please you. The food is nice too!"
Eat.Drink.Repeat.,"not my first visit, and wont be my last. this should say enough of the great food and cosy ambience. staff are friendly and attentive, and safety during this pandemic times was not compromised. prices a tad pricey but cannot fault the quality provided."
Great food and customer experience,Delicious food and great service! Staff were very accommodating and courteous. Food and drinks are excellent! I always enjoy going back to this place.
Delicious and decadent!,"I lunched here with my teenaged daughter and we enjoyed a main each, a Thai inspired salad and pasta which were both tasty. The highlight for us was the profiteroles. I requested a mixture of sauces and they happily met my request. They were so lovely! Nice waiters too."
service leaves alot to be desired,"salad was fine, nothing special but the service was rather unfriendly. they came almost to the point of telling us to wear our masks while we were eating and drinking! a lack of vegetarian options as usual at PS for some reason too"
Awesome staff and food!,Great job guys and keep up the good work! Good service and attentiveness shown even though short handed was commendable.
Good service,"Fast service, excellent food and most of all superb customer service by Toni at Ps Cafe Paragon branch"
..,The straws are brittle and breaks easily. And too much mint leave in the mango&mint soda but still love the food overall !
Convenient location and decent service but terrible coffee & food!,"Stopped in around 10am on Sunday for breakfast and a coffee, The place was basically empty which should have been the first warning sign.
Ordered a latte which was average to say the least.
To eat I got eh PS Classic Benedict, This would have been so good if only it was at least warm, It was so cold that it was not one bit enjoyable and it was way to salty.
I would not bother with this place, not only was the experience so bad but it was also very expensive!"
Excellent Food and Service,"This is quite different to the PS Café in Raffles Plaza with a different menu, it has excellent food in quality and quantity, the service was attentive and no delays, one drawback was that the alcohol was expensive for such a location. The staff are very friendly and make the experience worthwhile. A great break in the centre of shopping on Orchard road."
Relaxed atmosphere,"We had brunch at PS Cafe in Paragon during Christmas shopping season. We found that pineapple predominated in the pineapple-guava juice, and strawberry dominated in the strawberry-grape juice. We shared a turkey and cranberry sandwich and an order of parmesan truffle shoestring potatoes. Both were very good. Service was prompt and friendly, and the cafe was well decorated for Christmas. Prices reflect the cafe's strategic location in the Paragon. PS Cafe provides a delightful atmosphere for a relaxed meal. ."
coffee and lunch place,nice coffee place. love the bread and the cake offered during brunch . A quiet corner away from the noisy walkway
Excellent truffle fries,"Still my favourite place for truffle fries. Portion is huge, recommended 2-3 to share. Laksa pasta was average. Pricey. Good location Busy place for a weekday afternoon."
Worth a try,Love their double chocolate cake and truffle fries. Service was great with attentive waitress constantly refilling my water :)
good food,"We ordered king prawn aglio olio and the waiter recommended their truffle fries, which taste delicious"
Poor service and food is not great,Attendants are not attentive. Waited for more than 10 mins to finally catch their attention to order food. Food wise is very average.
Great service from Toni,"Dined at PS Cafe by the Sea East Coast, food was decent. Service was excellent! Toni was very attentive, friendly, and polite, making us feel very welcome! :)"
Cosy cafe,The cranberry turkey sandwich is delicious. Food is served fast. Good place for gathering. Will recommened to others.
Good service,Thanks Tony for your excellent service! His recommendation is good and we enjoyed our meal. He provides good hospitality during our time in the cafe. Well done! 😊😊😊
Bad service,"- Chicken burger was over fried / burnt

- When we came in I asked for water 3 times and got ignored.

When the guy behind the drinks counter(Desmond) brought the latte, I asked if he could please fill up my glass from the water station behind us.. He said okay and proceed to walked away with the menu.
I watched him go back to behind the drinks counter. I waited for another 10 min, caught his eye
He came over again and I asked for water again.

He argued “but it’s not my job to fill up up your glass I have other drinks to make.”
I was stunned that he chose to ignore a simple request on purpose.
Ironic reply.

Orchard paragon outlet not the best."
A proper service which you wont get in most places,My wife and me visited P.S cafe in a sunday evening for dinner. We were being welcomed and served by manager. We felt immediately home and enjoyed our dinner. Thank you so much P.S Cafe. We will be back again because we love your service.
Amazing food and service,"Toni took great care of us. Food was delicious as always. Steak was cooked perfectly, truffle fries were crisp."
Amazing service,"Food awesome, and service is the best! Tony and his team are very attentive and will make you feel very at home."
Nice food and good environment,"I like PS cafe located in Paragon, the environment is confortable and staffs are courteous, the food is super delicious, like ""Impossible burger, truffle shoesting fries, Honey Dijon chicker m....... yummy yummy"" :)"
A very special place,We just had a very tasty and special Barramundi fish at this restaurant. It was very well prepared and staff was pleasant and kind. We will be back there again.
Great place to dine & great service always !,"A regular at this wonderful outlet - food is quality and special shout-out to staff Jaja and Julie for always being courteous, patient and service with a smile ~ thanks for making visit a happy one ! 😊"
Highly Recommended!,I would like to commend the staffs especially Toni for an excellent service! All smiles and very friendly! Foods were also delicious. Will come back for sure!
Excellent service,We went to ps cafe paragon outlet and it was fantastic!!! Service was excellent especially this server by the name of Tan guan wen. Very kind and very patient and telling us reccomended dishes. Truffle fries and double chocolate blackout cake was extremly good. Love it!
Good service,Got served attentively by Toni with a sense of humor. Food was awesome too. THANK YOU PARAGON PS CAFE.
Great service 👌🏻,"Ample serving size, good flavour. Pricey but worth the money. Tony was very welcoming and helpful. No disappointments with the service."
👍🏻👍🏻,Good food and good service.. the truffle fries was good! Tony was very friendly and accommodating to our needs will definitely come back again.. :)
Highly Recommeded,"Good place, nice food and perfect environment. Staff is friendly and service is awesome. Like the atmosphere, best to hang out with friends."
Rude staff,"Was initially at your outlet at Raffles City on a sat afternoon. My Husband and I were being ignored for 10 mins in the queue so we decided to leave.

Visited Paragon outlet instead after that. Understand that the are understaffed hence my Husband and I decided to lighten their workload a little by footing the bill at the cashier directly. Staff Chona ignored us at the cashier for a good 10 mins before asking us if ‘that change’ belonged to us, we said no and let her settle her outstanding bills. We then said we are here to make payment. Chona then told us off rudely to PLEASE WAIT THERES A QUEUE. I HAVE TO DO ALL THESE FIRST. Excuse me, we had no intention to rush you and we merely informed you we are at the counter to make payment.

Chona needs work on her patience especially working in the frontline. Ps cafe, I think you can do so much better with better staff.

Bad experience in one day at both stores. So what if your business is good? That doesn’t mean customers have to be treated like that."
PS Cafe @ paragon,Excellent service by Julie @ Paragon outlet and delicious food! Always loved PS Cafe.... They never disappoint! (:

Great Food and Great Service,"The place is awesome, the food tastes very good, but the most important recipe are the staff, they are all accomodating and friendly, especially Toni 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
