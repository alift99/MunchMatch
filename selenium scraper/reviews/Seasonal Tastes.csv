Excellent Dinning Experience!,"It was a weekend and we came by here for the lunch buffet. As it was TGIF, the restaurant was surprisingly quite crowded despite a rainy day!

Upon arrival, we were led to our allocated sofa seat next to the windows by the friendly Manager.

The cafe, located on the 32nd storey, has a lovely and great ambience, with a wonderful bird's eye panoramic view of the surrounding area. Awesome. The feeling is like ""top of the world"" and everything around below seemed so small!

The food variety and quality was great, with International, Asian and Singapore cuisines.

Some of the food that were extremely yummy that worth mentioning included the soup of the day (radish soup), stir fried salted egg pork ribs, chicken rice, satay, roast pork and char siew, salmon and sushi maki, steamed seabass, hokkien mee, rojak, laksa, spaghetti, beef, assorted nyonya kuehs, pastries and desserts etc, just to name a few. They were well marinated and cooked nicely and in fact we did help to refill several times. The prawns and salmon were fresh too.

Although there were also some dim sum items, such as chicken pao and prawn dumplings, they were ordinary and you can skip them if you want to save your stomach for other foods.

Coffee and tea were inclusive in the buffet, together with pastries, fresh fruits and ice cream!

Service staff and chef were all very friendly, polite and efficient in clearing used plates. There's this server, Margaret if I didn't forget her name was very friendly and helpful in serving the drinks for us and clearing the used utensils and plates.

In terms of improvements and feedback, a few areas. Mentioned earlier, while most of the foods were nice, the dim sum were disappointing. The paos were hard and prawn dumplings had a hard skin. And although coffee and tea are inclusive in the buffet, you will need to order them with the staff, unlike other hotels where you can help yourself at the coffee machines making your own. Depending on how you look at it, it can be a bonus (good service where you don't need to make yourself) or a demerit if you prefer to do it yourself. Possibly they have control over this since we only saw one coffee machine there.

And also, do bear in mind that there wasn't any complimentary parking, like most other hotels which they provide. And parking fee wasn't that cheap and unless you don't mind to park your car some distance away like around the Lau Pat Sat or nearby buildings, a better way is to commute via public transport like bus or MRT. There's the Shenton Way station (TEL line and will be operating from 13 Nov 2022 onwards which is just directly opposite the hotel building).

Overall, it's a good value for money meal considering the wide spread and good quality food and with Marriott Bonvoy membership, members are entitled to discounts!

I rarely give 5-star rating but despite of some shortfalls that are insignificant, I think this place just deserves it!

We did enjoy my dinning and will be returning again. However, do note that the restaurant is currently offering lunch buffet from Monday-Friday only.

Let's join me next round and eat to our heart's content! Bon appetit!

"Awesome view, Service with a smile,","A lovely restaurant with a wonderful view. I had the American breakfast set, really love the creamy and fluffy scrambled eggs and crispy harsh browns. And make sure you get the iced latte, really good and strong. What truly standout and made my meal so enjoyable is the awesome service, prompt and always with a smile. A special shout-out to Charlie and Maria who gave my morning a cheerful start"
Morning Breacfast,"Good choice menu, a la carte buffet menu. The restaurant was buzy but staffs are friendly and fast service."
We were blown over,"As Seasonal Taste, Westin is closed during this period and only open for takeaway and delivery, we decided to order 2 pizzas and their localicious bundle.

We didn't expect much as we live in Sengkang far away from Shenton Way where Westin is located.

Despite the rainy weather, the delivery was very prompt and the food was hot! The pizzas were very large, chockful of goodness and tasty. At $15 these are by far the best and most worth it pizzas we have had in Singapore. The eefu noodles passed my mother-in-law's critical taste test. The salted egg york fishskin was crunchy and pleasing and the pork and water chestnut dumplings a delight with the yuzu mayo.

We didn't expect so much food we packed a parcel for my mother-in-law who lived 2 streets away. The cheesecake dessert has to be kept for tomorrow.

This makes us very interested to try the other dishes on the menu. Thank you, Westin!"
Thai-rrific Buffet,"Came for the buffet with high expectations considering its high price. While there was a decent array of dishes such as Thai boat noodles, lobster, sushi and a dedicated dessert area, there were several disappointing aspects. The Thai milk tea was inconsistent with every top up, iced tea was bland, crab overcooked. Of course, this is to personal preference as well. Would just like to mention that the staff were very polite and hospitable though, especially Guven, although it seemed they were understaffed and unable to cope with the dinner crowd."
Barely Average,"Had a craving for buffet dinner so decided to try out here with the on going DBS promotion deal.

Cut to the chase, Seafood is ok. Quality of the rest of the food, not particularly fresh. Hot items were mostly cold. Carved meat is acceptable. Dessert selection is just alright,the chocolate and avocado ice cream is pretty good. Is it worth $105 per person? Nope. Is the 2 for 1 deal worth it? If you‚Äôre just wanting free flow seafood and decent ice cream, maybe yes.

Will I come back? No.

Staff were very efficient with clearing the plates. That‚Äôs about all on the service.

A barely average buffet dinner."
Unlimited seafood buffet with good service!!,"Had a craving for seafood and decided to head here for the 1 for 1 DBS promo, which I didn‚Äôt regret!! Though the choices were limited(I feel), but the prawns and lobsters were very fresh!! I even forgotten to try the ice cream (which avocado flavored gelato was something new that I wanted to try) but I was too busy stuffing my mouth with food.

Really enjoyed my time there with such great service! Thank you Raymond and Jonathan for ensuring that our food was good, made seating arrangements for us with a lovely city view though it was late but we really appreciate it.

Am coming back to try the avocado flavored gelato!!"
Celebrating my 6years old daughter birthday!,The food is great. The service is superb. Jonathan Tan is a great service crew. He went extra mile to heat up lobsters and prawns for us so that our kids don‚Äôt need to eat cold seafood. He is very friendly and helpful. A great host. This is probably our 5th time having a meal at seasonal taste. The spread is not massive but it‚Äôs good quality. We will definitely be going back again.
For Seafood Lovers,"Wide ranges of seafood available to choose from. My boyfriend and I enjoyed the dinner with free flow of stir fried crabs, lobsters and prawns and salmon sashimi! Value for money. The service manager did a sweet gesture by serving us birthday cake when we just ask for candle."
Awesome üëç,"First time visiting this buffet restaurant and sure to back soon!!
Buffet selection was great and seafood is fresh and sweet! Enjoyed our dinner with a perfect sea view. As what observed, the restaurant was down with man power today, Yet the services standard is not down at all!!
Special thanks to Mr Raymond for being such great professional host and making us a unforgettable birthday celebration!"
Seasonal Taste,"Good food and good service and we will come again.
Jonanthan Tan provide a first class service. He know our needs and has a smiling face all the time.we have a great dinner and Saturday night."
Selection was not good. Very few selections.,"The service was good but the selection there was not very good. Too little to my point of view for the price I am paying. However, food standard still considerably good. If only they ve more selections, I will give them 5 stars."
DISAPPOINTING DINNER.,"Chose this place for 8 of us as a birthday celebration for my brother and mother on the 8th March. Came here couple years back and loved the view and the food choices. However this time, it was rather disappointing in food variety and service by the manager.
Firstly, waited at entrance with their sign saying ‚Äúplease wait to be seated‚Äù. But no one came, so we just walked ourselves since my sister was already inside sitting. Seafood was alright despite lobster being quite rubbery, as if it was all frozen. Live station for raw meat totally gone!, which was sad. The rest of the ‚Äúmain‚Äù dishes all felt like as if it was just miscellaneous items instead. Pathetic overcook pot of spaghetti in tomato sauce,dried up briyani rice, 1 roast beef just sitting out. Honestly nothing looked appetising. As if they tried to advertise variety ‚Äúinternational‚Äù cuisine, but barely put in any effort. Laksa and sushi station was acceptable.

To make things worst, was standing at the dessert station and waiting for staff to come around so I could ask for a birthday cake. 5,10mins, neither chefs nor any service guy was seen. Only saw the lady manager happily chatting to a caucasion guy that was sitting alone. Reluctant with no choice, approach her nicely. The moment I approach, she didn‚Äôt smile at all, instead looked frustrated. Told her if I could request a birthday cake with candle. She answered with a frown if I have requested beforehand. I said no I didn‚Äôt and she totally don‚Äôt bother and say i have to request 3 days in advance. I looked at her confused, and say so I can‚Äôt get it?? And she just unwillingly say ‚Äúya you can‚Äôt but I‚Äôll see what I can do‚Äù. And never got any answer later. FIRSTLY MADAM, you‚Äôre working in a freaking 5 stars hotel. That‚Äôs not a way at all to talk to your guest. Second, to request 3 days in advance is super ridiculous, never have I went to any restaurant that I am not allowed for last min birthday cake request, what‚Äôs more at Westin hotel. So if I‚Äôm a customer that just walk in for a buffet? List all the rules in your website if you‚Äôre this stingy. LADY, buck up your attitude. 1 star service working in a 5 star hotel, shame. Gave us impression that you‚Äôre just biased towards certain race of people. Totally bought our mood down when this happen. Could tell my family didn‚Äôt enjoy the night, but just had to go with the flow. I myself work in the F&B line, and no I wouldn‚Äôt write this much feedback if it was over small matters.

2 star rating is only for the dessert station which is still good as i remember it to be. And for the attentive service guys clearing out plates throughout our meal.

Will I bring and recommend people here again? NO.
Thankfully we had a 1 for 1 chope deals. Otherwise we would be paying about $100 per pax. Totally not worth it for the food and service."
Loved it all,"Just finished a dry February (yes a day early) and I wanted to indulge in a lunch buffet - good quality without breaking the bank. Certainly Seasonal Tastes lived up to my expectation.
There was great food from fresh seafood, bread, crispy pork, lovely Brie cheese, Indian and much much more all swallowed down with a 2 hour free flow of wine and beer. It doesn‚Äôt happen to me often but I walked out of there not being able to force down another beer!!!"
Pricey for the food and service,"Located at Asia Square Tower 2, the restaurant at Level 32 can only be assessed via the lift within Westin Singapore lobby.

Visited the restaurant on a Sunday evening. The restaurant is about half 70% filled.

The arrangement of the tables is spacious. There is no problem of squeezing around unlike other restaurants that prefer to prioritise the number of seats over the comfort of the diners.

Variety of the food is considered limited. The usual are available: salad, bread, cold seafood (limited to prawns, clams, mini lobsters and flower crabs), sushi (only salmon), sushi, Chinese dishes, noodles (laksa, fish soup), western dishes, desserts, ice cream, coffee and tea. I have tried almost every food type and I ran out of variety. This is disappointing.

Food quality wise, it's acceptable but not fantastic. The most memorable food is the fried bee hoon. Seriously, it's very simple but very nice. Other than that, nothing is really worth mentioning.

Service wise, I have to say it's disappointing. Throughout the dinner, I have not seen anyone coming to clear my table. I am located at a corner table and the table besides me also faced the same problem of having to bring our used plates to the service counter. While I do see the staff clearing the other tables, I am unsure if its because of the location of my table that we are forgotten. Nevertheless, the kitchen staff are rather helpful when attending to their respective stations.

Pricing is considered on the high side. It's about $90++/adult and $45++/child from 4 years old onwards. Even with the 1 for 1 posb/DBS promotion its still considered very expensive and I will say that it's not value for money. Nevertheless, the ambience is good for a dinner with close ones without the rowdy crowd.

The restaurant is able to offer a slice of cake with candle for birthday celebration, if you indicate at the point of reservation. However, the wait for the cake to arrive can be quite long..."
Worth every penny,"Celebrated post Valentine‚Äôs Day with hubby and 2 kids at Seasonal Tastes. The restaurant came with an amazing view of the marina harbor.
As it was in the vicinity of Singapore‚Äôs financial Centre, the restaurant was not overly crowded on a Sunday. Kids were treated to balloon sculpting and cookie decorating. (All inclusive!)
A good variety for buffet. My fav are freshly shucked oysters, lobsters and fresh sashimi. Hubby‚Äôs fav are the cook on demand local dish, Laksa and the grilled rack of lamb. My kids also like the pasta station where they get freshly cooked pasta.
There were also fresh bread (in the oven!) and a nice variety of dessert. My fav was the rich and flavorful avocado ice cream.
We paid additional for free flow beer. They have free flow wine too. Cheers to a beautiful post V-Day celebration."
International & local cuisine,"For my son's birthday, we had a buffet dinner at the restaurant. The buffet spread had a variety of both international & local cuisine. The friendly staff, view & decor was awesome. The seafood was great, especially the crab. We really had a great time & the birthday outing was a memorable one."
Good food and very nice view of the city,"I visited the restaurant for lunch at Westin (just across the Citibank office), the food was good and fresh. They have a nice view over the city, also a nice bar on top with decent cocktails."
Awesome,"Awesome service. The food is fresh and delicious
Nice view. All the staff is helpful and friendly"
VALUE FOR $$$,"Though spread could have been larger, food served nevertheless is excellent and dining atmosphere most congenial."
Birthday celebration,"Reception is important but we waited for some time before being received to our table.
Food variety doesn't command the price. Similar priced buffet has a better spread.
Food replenishment is slow especially worse when restaurant is almost full.
Birthday cake surprise for those celebrating birthday was pathetic and impersonal.
Overall, it's not worthwhile for a second visit unless some things are fixed."
Seasonal Tastes,"Food choices was alright but expected a few more. The most enjoyable part is the location of the restaurant, great view of the CBD and the Marina Bay Sands area, provided if you are seated at the specific window. Great service and staff. Overall very good."
Good food and ambience,"Good ambience with nice scenery. Food was freah and good too. Wished they served fresh oysters but perhaps we went on Monday night (30th dec) so there was no oysters? We are not sure. The ice creams were really good too, thick and creamy. Not alot varieties for ice creams but lots more for dessert."
Just had lunch. Food was great.,"Just had lunch. Food was great. Seafood was fresh. Ambience was decent. Their service staff, Evin, was friendly and professional."
Dinner,"Great view on the 32nd floor overseeing the city skylines. Great ambience, great assortment of food with fresh seafood. Highly recommend."
Seasonal Tastes at the Westin Hotel,Average food and service. The seafood has limited range and the overall buffet was average. There were insufficient staff.
Dinner,"great ambience, celebrated Anniversary with my partner. High floor with good view, food spread was great"
Last minute dinner booking to celebrate wedding anniversary,"I have to admit that I was slightly skeptical about how the dinner experience would be, after reading some less than stellar reviews left by other diners. However, the evening turned out to be awesome!

The restaurant was considerably crowded for a Monday evening, but food was topped up promptly and service was great ‚Äì from the manager hunting down saucers for me, to the wait staff who was always quick to clear our plates, and finally to Mr Guven, who rounded up our evening nicely with his pleasant disposition and smiles.

The variety of food may not be as wide as what other buffets offer, but frankly for me, that was enough because it's usually impossible to sample everything. Seafood was fresh, the laksa was good, and I really loved the avocado gelato!

On another note, I did make the booking using a 1-for-1 credit card promotion, so that definitely made the entire experience much more value-for-money.

If I had to name one thing that was a little disappointing, it would be the coffee from the machine. It was surprisingly lukewarm, almost cool actually, right after being dispensed. That said, it didn't mar the overall experience. Thanks Westin and the team at Seasonal Tastes for a wonderful evening!"
Dinner at Seasonal Tastes,"First time and exceed my expectation with very good food and very nice environment. Customer service and waiters and waitresses are very friendly and helpful to make everyone enjoyed the
dinner.."
Birthday dinner treat!,"Don't miss it if you are a seafood lover! It's a bit messy when eating the crabs, but that's alright. Overall is okay."
Thanksgiving gathering,"Heard quite a fair bit about this buffet; was awed by the view from the hotel lobby (after all, it‚Äôs on the 32nd floor) ... upon entering the restaurant was quite amazed at the spread laid but sadly i must say that besides the cold selection, the rest are quite normal as offered by other establishments ... though cold prawns and half lobsters looks appetizing yet not really that fresh, you can‚Äôt taste the sweetness fresh seafood offers ... the roast beef station was manned by an Inexperienced chef who carves it into small bits & pieces yet placed in the serving plate for customers to partake (shouldn‚Äôt it be in slices???) Overall i‚Äôm not impressed with quality served for my money paid ... won‚Äôt be back for sure"
Worth it with the 1 for 1 voucher,"Good enough spread of seafood, sashimi and meat. No beef on the day we went though. Good quality soups and other food selections as well. Overall enjoyed ourselves. Might be considered pricey without the voucher. Dessert range seemed to have shrunk compared to previous visit (lunch)"
DO NOT GO HERE EVER! YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE,"What was supposed to be a memorable night for our dear friend to have a farewell dinner turned a nightmare. Don‚Äôt tell me I didn‚Äôt warn you, choose some place else to spend your money on a good buffet. If I can give a negative number I will do that. I am not over reacting here. Promise!

There was nothing fantastic about the menu. Choices are little and SUBPAR. Marketed as ‚ÄúCRAB SPECIAL‚Äù the only crab we saw were flower crabs in black pepper and curry. They had prawn on chili crab sauce which tasted more like sweet chili sauce, maybe they counted this as crab dish idk. No oysters, just mussels. The Japanese section was terrible I feel like I‚Äôm gonna get sick if I ate them. The maki was hard and dry. The nigiris totally doesn‚Äôt look fresh! They even serve STALE NACHO CHIPS seriously? This is not all.

Service was the WORST! Our plates were not bussed regulary, water was not served. We have to wave and raise our arm to get the their attention every time we needed something. But this was not the case with the other tables. The manager MARIDORE was showing us some attitude. We don‚Äôt know why the guy seated next to us was smiled at and offered water even if he is not asking. One time she poured the water on the guy‚Äôs glass with a big smile when my friend asked if she could have the same the smile was wiped out and was rather given a black face. She walked around at the table behind us asking if they needed water when then didn‚Äôt asked our hands were raised and we were IGNORED! We don‚Äôt understand why she MISTREATED us because we cannot remember anything mean or bad we did to her or maybe she prefer to serve caucasians and locals only. Very RACIST and DISCRIMINATING.

It was almost 10pm, we are well aware that they are closing and we are starting to wrap things up. She came handing out the bill of SGD600++ but she was aware that we are going to use the promotion. They are running a MARRIOTT BONVOY discount of 50% and a POSB 1-for-1. This was communicated when we came in and I don‚Äôt know why she wasn‚Äôt happy. One way or another we will avail either of the promotion. When we told her we are all MEMEBERS she mumbled something like why we didn‚Äôt tell her or why she wasn‚Äôt told kinda thing. The question is SHE NEVER ASKED, SHE NEVER INTERACTED with us she just tried to SLAPPED us with the bill like saying GET THE HELL OUTTA HERE YOU ARE NOT WANTED thing. Then since she wanted to make it difficult she said 1 member 1 form of payment and only the members credit card can be used to pay. But we wanted to pay as a group since how can we ask our friend whom we are treating for dinner to pay for herself??? We obliged even if we think it was absurd. When I wanted to pay for 2 I gave her 2 of my different cards and 2 membership number and explained why we are doing this. She said NO it can‚Äôt be done she has to pay on her own. I had no choice but to use my debit card. I lose the points on my MARRIOTT BONVOY and Credit Card.

When we are about to leave and wanted to leave a feedback we asked the other staff what was the name of the manager because her NAMEPLATE WAS COVERED (wonder she intentionally did it) and we couldn‚Äôt find her, NOBODY knows what their manager‚Äôs name was.

After writing to the director of dining about our experience (which I think was pointless) we found out that whatever she asked us to do that night in terms of payment and promotion details are totally wrong. She was a manager and she don‚Äôt know what they are T&Cs of their promotions?

We felt we were badly embarrassed by her the whole time.

BAD FOOD.
WORST SERVICE.
INCOMPETENT MANAGEMENT.

DO NOT GO HERE!"
Extremely disappointed,Unpleasant experience. Waiter reminding us of the time several time. Made a mistake with the timing. My husband tried to pay but was told that the member must make the payment. Was supposed to be a birthday celebration for my bro. We ended up leaving the restaurant without blowing the candles because of the bad service.
Very bad experience with service,"Our family wanted to try the Thanksgiving Day Special Buffet at the Westin this year and unfortuanately had very bad customer service experiences that we will never forget. I was standing in a line with about 5 people ahead of me watching as the server cut the slices of stuffed turkey for each person. The pieces were nice and thick and I was looking forward to getting my piece and eating it, too. But when my turn came instead of the nice slice the server that was given to everyone in front of me he gave me all the little left over pieces that had fallen to the sides when he was cutting the turkey. I was speechless and stood there for awhile. The next person in the back of me was a nice looking white gentlemen and while I was standing there deciding what to do he got served another beautiful slice. At that point I exploded and told the server why did he give me all these left over pieces while everyone else got a nice slice. I told him it was very rude and discriminatory and he shouldn't be doing that. He started getting very defensive and finally said ""You want another piece"". By that time I was so upset I just walked away. That whole incident spoiled my appetite so even though I was enjoing myself and the food up to that point that incident put such a bad taste in my mouth that I couldn't enjoy the rest of the dinner. At the end I made a complaint to the person who looked like a manager but he was also very defensive and just said something about why didn't you ask for another piece. I thought that was a terrible attitude for a manager. If it wasn't for the terrible customer service, I think this restaurant could become a very good place to take people for meals. They definitely need to work on customer service training."
Superbe Sunday Brunch,"Great experience - went with 3 of my friends and we all loved it !
The food was very yummy - especially the dessert and seafood buffet.
Chefs and Service team were excellent.
The view is beautiful.
We will definitely come back :) see you very soon ^^"
Manager Displayed Unprofessional Behavior,"My family went for the Thanksgiving Day Special Buffet. The food was great, the environment was superb, however we had a horrendous experience with the service staff.

My mother waited in line for the rolled turkey, where the chef behind the counter was slicing fresh pieces. When it came to my Mom, he handed her the falling apart, leftover bits that had gathered on the side. When she stepped away, she noticed the person behind her also had a fresh cut piece. I went up to the counter shortly after and the chef also offered the leftover from the side, however I asked for a freshly sliced piece.

I am not sure what the protocol is for it, but it does seem odd that the chef was judging us based on how we looked (our size? the fact we were females?) and handing us smaller & less fresh portions. But this wasn't the worst part.

The worst came when we raised this to the floor manager, a European looking gentleman. We told him that the chef had served both of us (separately) the not as fresh looking parts of the turkey, while serving the people around us with fresh slices. His flippant response:

""Why didn't you just ASK for a fresh piece??""

No apology, no patience to mediate the situation. Just an accusatory question thrown back at us. My Mom went on to defend her position that there was a line behind her and she was already flustered when the chef gave her the flimsy leftovers, but the manager retorted with an even worse comment:

""Well, I""m sorry YOU felt that way.""

My jaw was on the floor, the tone he spoke with had so much disrespect, and he was accusing my Mom of being unreasonable. At that we just gave up. Why bother with the confrontation? There's no point in spoiling the mood of our Thanksgiving Dinner to deal with such an unpleasant person.

Such a pity that we had such a terrible experience with the service, because overall the food was great and the variety was nice.

Please train your staff to deal with feedback in a more professional way!"
Lots of seafood,Lots of seafood especially crabs and prawns cooked in different cuisine styles. Great for seafood lovers.
BEST RESTURAUNT EVER!,This resturaunt is very good. It isnt like any occasional resturaunt you would see when you walk past. You would be exuberant to eat here. Its the best experience i have ever had. There was a huge variety of food. I had the Thanksgiving buffet. So many good choices. HAPPY THANKSGIVING!!
Unlimited Seafood Dinner Buffet,"The dinner buffet consists of fresh lobster, crabs, prawns, sashimi and various types of seafood. You have to try the Singapore Chilli Crab, the Black Pepper Crab, laksa and the prawn noodle! Highly recommended!"
Family gathering,I hosted dinner for my relatives' visit. We decided to try this place as the food & rates look attractive.. we were allocated a table with nice view. The duty manager was very friendly and the food was yummy good..
Last minute Birthday dinner celebration,"It was a last minute decision that we called the restaurant in the afternoon to reserve a table, but to no avail. The reservation list is full for the evening. This could possibly turn out to be a disappointment... We decided to gate crash during dinner time without any reservation.

We were greeted by a friendly staff and the duty manager. We told them that we have no reservation...

Instead of rejecting us, they ‚Äúsqueezed‚Äù out one table for us. That made our day.

Although it is a bit pricey, the food is delicious!"
Happy with the services,"overall experience with Seasonal Taste was good and satisfy.
The services was Top class and they served verity chooses of foods.

love the environment."
Good :),"it's worth to come, Lobster, baby lobster, Sashimi Salmon, various cooked food! The seafood were very fresh and the food was really good. The service was good and servers were attentive. Plus with the view of 32 floor you can enjoy the ambiance and nice view while having you lunch/dinner.
Would totally come again"
Birthday celebration,"Love the spread of seafood from prawns to lobsters to crabs to yabbies etc n cooked in a variety of ways e.g. curry, white pepper, Singapore style chilli crab sauce etc. Cheese platter was good too, my friend loved the Hokkien noodle n laksa and there are of course the usual buffet offerings of sashimi, sushi, beef etc. Desserts? Of cos it was a spread from nonya kuehs to ice cream to fruits fondue etc. It would have been icing on the cake if the services stack up though. We had to call and wait several times for plates to be cleared, the restaurant could do better with a few more service staff. Would have been full rating if not for the service or maybe I should say the lack of it. Nonetheless for the good food, I will be back."
Lousy service,"Sucks service..... around 8:30pm, no one top-up the food, counter looks so empty , worst part is no plate and cutlery provided, all service staff busy to talking and wearing gloves clear the table, never even present my birthday cake...and offer any coffee and tea, when we ask for utensils, they told us, please take yourself, this is how Westin hotel management to train their staff...."
Crab Special Dinner Buffet,"Have buffet dinner at Seasonal Tastes yesterday as they have the Crab Special.

Overall would say the dishes are ok.

We attended the Crab Special dinner buffet in August 2019 and there were mud crab dishes and flower crab. However, we are disappointed that yesterday buffet dinner were only served those flower crab dishes."
"Over crowded, Limited selection","This buffet is over crowded, I‚Äôve never seen such chaotic buffet setting. Let alone the selection of hot food is so limitled. I can easily count them with 2 hands. Celebrated my birthday here. What a disappointment!"
Feedback,The down side is that the lunch buffet is closed at 230pm. Those who came at 130pm would feel short changed.
Good service,"The service was good, servers were attentive. We‚Äôve here for many times and we‚Äôre never disappointed. Keep it up!"
Good food and has nice view,"Good food and has nice view. I have recommended my sisters to come here for family bonding.
We like to eat lobster and sushi."
Very Average,"Variety of food was limited, taste was overall average. Service of some staff was quite unpleasant as they seemed extremely unhappy for some reason and some were rude. Lack of manpower was evident, plates were cleared very slowly. Hair was found in 2 different plates of food which wasn‚Äôt very appetising to see. For a 5-star hotel restaurant, definitely can be improved!"
Great variety of foods,"Great variety if foods to choose from. Many seafoods such as crabs and lobsters. Great ambience. Good restaurant for couples, families and friends."
AVOID AT ALL COST! Poor Management Service,"I am writing this right after our dinner, because of such poor dining experience.

We had our reservation made and ensured we came early at 6pm before it was crowded. We were received by a Mr. Guven Gallelun for four dining guest and a baby. We reiterate that four dining guest are here for the 1-for-1 credit card deal. Was given an all ok, and shown to our seat.

At the end of our meal, we asked for the bill. A stern faced Guven came telling us that payment will be charged as 2 adult bill and an additional separate child rate as the fourth guest is a child.

We asked why was this not made known when we came in and had told we are here for the 1-for-1 credit card deal (4 guests).

Guven said, management decided to charge now (like right this moment).

We nicely rationalize if we were told at the onset (at the point of arrival, checking in with him), most likely we will still continue dining and have no issue paying.
But such dynamic change really caught us by surprise.

Feeling that we were taken for a ride by him, not wanting to argue, we asked if we can speak to someone else.

However, Guven responded ‚ÄúNO. I am the management, and I have decided so!‚Äù

Wow, so rude, definitely felt cheated!
And talking down to your guest like in colonial time!!!? This still exist in Singapore?

So, you pay to feel lousy at the end of your meal with such rude restaurant management? Who would want to come back again???

For those who have not been here, it is definitely not worth your visit to this Seasonal Taste; whose management intent is to fleece the customer off.

Seasonal Taste, under Marriott Bonvoy at The Westin, run by arrogant Mr Guven Gullelun that pro claim he is the Management.

We will definitely spare no effort to tell all diners NOT to subject themselves to such poor ‚Äúmanagement‚Äù service. So diner, AVOID AT ALL COST!

At the price point, there are many other buffets with the same or better spread. In Singapore, diners definitely have many other choices. We love our food, we love to be treated right as well and will come back again and again with good feel.

Seasonal Taste, The Westin, is DEFINITELY a NO GO with such poor ""Management Service""."
Overall value for money,"Good spread of Buffet selection. The cooked food- Roast Beef, Aglio Olio and Laksa is delicious. I like the Kueh and Avocado ice cream. They are short handed however you can see everyone including the restaurant manager n kitchen staff are continuously working hard -clearing and topping up plates n food."
Will come again!,Excellent service! They even prepared a slice of cake for my bf as I celebrated his birthday there. Wide spread of choices and I love the black pepper crab and lobster.
Insufficient resource to deal with crowd,"Food was not top up, couldn‚Äôt find cutleries and no one to top up the wine when we went on the 2 hours free flow. Staff were inadequately train and do not know how to serve the wine."
Good Food and Evironment,"Reasonable price, 1++ for 2 with seafood, it's worth to come, Lobster, baby lobster, Sashimi Salmon, , various cooked food
Good Food - Althohugh not really many choice to select, but whatever you can see , it's enough to fill your stomach
nice scenery - 32th floor, nice view while having your meal
Will come back if the deal still on for 1-1"
Simple birthday request on waiver of corkage was rejected by the Indian manager there.,"The table that was given was shaky(when u rest ur hands it‚Äôll get shaky since it‚Äôs not balanced, and gets annoying), and the section was stuffy without aircon.
After much request the Indian staff reluctantly shifted us to another table right in the middle of the buffet traffic which obviously was cooler. Central control system of the aircon in the premise was horrible.

Surprising food variety shrunk compared to my previous visit in June on a Wednesday.(Is that some Monday blue issue?) Lesser crab choices,
Lobster was not that fresh as well, there was a stench.

Staff were non proactive apart from a singaporean bespectacled lady. Initially was well attended to at the shaky table zone, after shifting our plain water was never refilled.

When I went to the ladies, the same Indian manager and his Indian staff was chit chatting at the counter.
When asked for complimentary parking - the Indian manager emphasized that as dining guests there‚Äôs NO complimentary Carpark coupons.

Laksa Station no staff was there... as guests we can‚Äôt self-help to cook since the ingredients and cooking utensils are in the kitchen area.
The butler slicing the beef was not even doing a good job... the lifeless slices scatter all over in all shapes and sizes. Quite unprofessional, the sight of the slices was a real turn off.

Amazingly, the nicest that evening were the customers and the crowd. Service was poor, food wasn‚Äôt even worth the money."
So So experience,"Food and the spread is good.
The only grouses is service. Apparently insufficient staffing, staff have to be told to refill water and replace coffee machine water tank, teaspoon, bowl."
Choice food but slightly short on service,"Seasonal Tastes serves excellent food and good value for money, with their 1 for 1 promotion. We had booked a table of 16, but were given a table for 14. Clearing of plates was slow and most times, no one was manning the ice cream counter"
Nice ambience to have a cozy lunch with Sisters.,"Wide spread of food. Salads bar, sashimi, sushi, western, asian and nice desserts corner. Enjoy the ambience and nice view."
Overall satisfied,"Overall a good dining experience, service was good and fast despite the large crowd. Enjoyed the desert section with the wide variety. However the main dining choices were kind of limited. Which could be improved on maybe."
Sumptuous breakfast at Seasonal Tastes,"We had a sumptuous breakfast every time at the Seasonal Tastes restaurant, located at the 32 floor of The Westin Singapore. We simply love the food choices, the tastes, and the courteousness of the staff."
Yummy and Fresh Seafood,"The seafood were very fresh and the food was really good. With 1 for 1 deal, this is really worth going."
Bday celebrations!,"Without hesitation, the bestest place to go to, for a guaranteed fantastic meal and memorable time for celebrations! Chef Yeoh, Chef Pop, chef Kit are best in class when it comes to western, Chinese and Thai food, French desserts! Kudos to the team"
Early Birthday celebration,"Revisited the restaurant after 4 years, the promotion 1 for 1 is my main reason to revisit, everything‚Äôs great, food & service, also a beautiful surprise to receive a small slice of cake for my birthday celebration at the restaurant, thank you !"
Wonderful experience,"It is my first time here at seasonal tastes at The Westin and I love it because the waiters and waitresses here are very friendly and approachable. Although I did not make a reservation for the cake, Mr Kumar did his best and gave me a nice cake for my girlfriend's birthday"
"EXCELLENT FOOD, AMAZING SERVICE","We were lucky enough to get a table of 4 for dinner. Ambience was great, paired with scenic views of a high floor. Something unique about this restaurant is the spacious seating. Food spread and variety was also good.

But what struck a chord and left a lasting impression was the staff who served us. We were served by Darmendran, who was extremely attentive to all our needs. He was diligent as he went about waiting on the tables, getting us the right utensils, serving drinks, helping even with the sauces, all the while juggling multiple tables. His friendly attitude and warm smile really brought the dining experience to the next level! A huge shoutout to Darmendran for doing his job with such dedication and enthusiasm!

Not to forget suresh, the manager, who also got his hands dirty by helping out with the tables when it got hectic.

I will definitely visit again. Beyond the food and ambience of dining on the 32nd floor, it is memorable to have experienced top notch service from staff who genuinely care. Thank you Westin!"
Anniversary,"Enjoyed the window seats. Likes the atmosphere and the Service staff very good, friendly and polite."
Needs to be seamless in service.,"This restaurant needs to be organised better.
The usher's desk was unmanned for about 3 minutes on a weekend around 12.15/12.30 pm.
Some of the waiters seemed greenhorns.
Spread of cuisine was satisfactory but the Laksa was lacking in quality.
Desserts could have been better."
Nice and relax buffet lunch,"The ambiance is good, enjoyed the lunch with nice view. I liked the seafood and dessert section. The main course don‚Äôt seem appetizing. The laksa is lousy! The ingredients chicken breast is too hard and tau pou very small pieces. Could be improve."
Buffet on thurs night,"Seafood selection were not bad given a thurs. there were lobsters, cold prawns, mussels, crab and clam. Desserts selection was good too, loved the fondue, pudding and chocolates. however half the time, we had difficulties looking for utensils and plates clearing were quite slow. Our table was small so when we return with new food, there were no place at all and we had to call for the waitress for help. Nonetheless, service was good and pleasant."
Back again for the second time,"My 2nd time dining at Seasonal Tastes after a previous good experience. Had been craving for lobsters so decided to come here again as the Chope 1-for-1 dinner buffet voucher was a pretty good deal. Absolutely loved the chilled lobsters that were still as fresh and sweet. The prawns were on par too. There were 3 crab dishes that night - pepper, thai curry and chilli. Blue swimmer crabs were used for these dishes which weren't amazing but at least they were perfectly cooked (flesh was firm, not mushy) and quite meaty. Enjoyed the roasts with gravy and my favourite wholegrain mustard. The creamy and well seasoned mashed potato was deliciously comforting - a must eat! Loved munching on the crunchy papadum too that were nicely perfumed with spices. Desserts fared the best surprisingly. Loved the creme brulee, avocado gelato, mango sorbet, cakes and chocolate chip cookies. Everything was not overly sweet and rich. Washed them down with vanilla bourbon tea and cafe latte (smooth, not acidic) - perfecto! Overall, I liked that the food wasn't heavily seasoned or laden with too much MSG - didn't feel thirsty at all after the meal. Seemed like everything was done with less oil, less salt and less sugar which was definitely a plus. Service was impeccable too - staff were quick to clear plates and refill glasses. Variety of buffet spread wasn't great but most items were reasonably executed. Wouldn't mind coming back again."
Would recommend,"Great selection of seafood and desserts, but selection of cooked food could be more. Overall worth it with 1 for 1."
Poor International buffet,Limited choice of selections; sashimi section have only salmon and it ran out so quickly that you have to wait for replenishment. The saving grace is the dessert section. Will not patronise in the future.
Good Lobster buffet,Godd deal 1 for 1 lobster buffet. Nice ambience & nice food. Like the laksa & lobster claw. Free flow of tea & coffee.
Very good spread of Seafood and International Cuisines on 32nd Floor,"This is a great location at 32nd Floor at Westin Hotel on Marina View. The Buffet spread of Exotic Seafood and International Cuisines like Japanese, local Laska, Pork, Ham and Beef are fabulous with a breath taking Harbour and PSA port view. Highly recommended and reasonably priced for the family. I will definitely be back."
Good deal for a Buffet with 1-1 promotion,"Went for dinner on a Saturday. Buffet with a modest variety but quality of food was quite good - lobster, sashimi, crabs prepared in different ways. Generally what was prepared was executed well. Also a great view as it is on 33rd floor. Service quite efficient, except towards the end, close to closing, where we had a long wait for our bill and in the end was told that we should just pay at the cashier - there isn‚Äôt a counter - so you stand next to the serving person and view your bill on their monitor = a rather poor finish for a restaurant in a 5 star hotel."
The buffet price with that spread is not worth to eat,"We are a group of 6 adults and were there on the 27 June 2019. The restaurant is currently running a 1 for 1 promotion with certain credit/debit cards and that gives us the reason to give it a try. After visiting, we really find that given the original price of S$88++ from on weekdays and S$98++ from Friday to Sunday is totally not worth to even consider. Firstly, the staff are very slow in refilling the food and the one who was doing the refilling (staff) he was coughing and without wearing a mask and didn't even turn his face over (I was at the Japanese food station while he was doing the refilling of the sushi), it was very disgusting is totally no sense of basic hygiene. Next, the while we were searching for mugs for hot tea and totally there is none of the mugs that we can sight till we have to find the staff to ask for it, and one pot of the was totally empty and that time was only about 9pm there's no staff to do the refilling of the tea too (Sencha green tea). The taste of the food is really moderate and nothing fantastic and if without the 1 for 1 promotion, we really will not consider to visit the restaurant.
My view and suggestion will be, you guys really need to train your staff well on the basic hygiene especially when it comes to handling of the food. And also be it you are running a promotion or not, I would find that the service quality for your restaurant (especially when you are located in a reputable hotel in Singapore) has to meet the minimum standard since you are in the service line to service humans. The quality of food also must look into it to improve in order to fit the price you are charging."
Good buffet spread with a great view,"Good western and Japanese food. Average Chinese & Indian food.
Very good dessert spread.
Kids will definitely enjoy the dessert section"
Excellent service at Seasonal Tastes,"I had breakfast today at Seasonal Tastes. Although the spread was a bit much, the quality and service were great. Ms. Margot Debure and Mr. Darmen were very helpful. My queries were all answered well. It was worth the price. Great management by her."
Good Service but limited choices,"We enjoyed good service for dinner at Seasonal Taste yesterday, and the dessert bar is very good which is like a candy store for adults and children

Most of the food are tasty enough except some of the clams and crab crawl which are quite frozen and tasteless.

very limited choices for maybe 4 to 5 selections only per station

You won‚Äôt find premium items like oysters or snow crab or Parma ham which the other same priced buffet dinner will have

I rate the value of this buffet to be $50, which make sense for those with credit cards having 1 for 1

I will be angry if I am paying $98 ++ for such layout
Which the edge , colony and similar will give better cp food value

The place is comfy enough and with good service but at $98++,maybe it‚Äôs not for a foodie like me"
The ONLY ONE you need to ENJOY,"BEST buffet with breathe taking scenery at 32 Storey.

House specialty includes Laksa & Avocado ice-cream.

And if you are lucky, their thick pesto cheese sauce, satay, fudge chocolate cake are SIMPLY to die for!

I have been visiting once every month and it's ALWAYS GOOD, with different theme each time. Just couldn't get enough."
"Great experience, buffet spread was awesome.","Overall experience ,9/10
Spread : 8/10 fresh seafood , lovely dessert table
Service :9/10. Prompt service and clearing of plates from table."
Ramesh Singh,No taste in any of the varities although spread was good...Had buffet dinner yesterday..Great location..staff nice...cost nice...taste poor
Brunch - Free Flow,The food was great ... but the service of the free flow was poor ... the selection of red & white wine was also not great!!!
Fresh and delicious food as always!,"Fresh and delicious food as always, specially the prawns and crabs for cold dish. For this time the tripe stew was extremely good. We also loved the chocolates, cakes and gelatos!
Also great view! While this time we enjoyed our lunch during a quite heavy rain... but still, atmosphere is nice and comfortable!"
Superb Service,"The service crew is very swift in attending to our needs.
Service was awesome , food was great and ambience was really nice!
Will come back again."
Great selection of food for a cheap price!,"The international lunch buffet has a great selection of foods. Having an interactive kitchen means the chef can personalize a dish for you. The seafood is some of the best and freshest we've had in Singapore. As for the price, it is very cheap compared to other buffet restaurants but the quality is very very good."
"Quality Seafood Buffet, Great Ambience & View, Value for $$$",Great view in and out of the restaurant. A wide spread of buffet spread and staff are really warm! Must visit!
"Great view, superb food","We went there for a family lunch after we had heard good things about the restaurant. And it did not disappoint. The food spread was very good and tasty, and for vegetarian food eater, the Indian food corner was a nice touch. Since it was lunch our table facing out towards Marina One and the sea was a great place to sit - all in all a very enjoyable experience."
"Good food, Good Place, Good Atmosphere","The ingredients are fresh and food done in the best possible ways to appreciate the taste. Price is good with the one-for-one deal, otherwise its on the high side."
Amazing lobsters with the impressive service from The Westin and Seasonal Tastes,"I had a great time with my family in Singapore for our vacation. I bought the vouchers from Chope deals for 6 persons for Seasonal Tastes. I knew this place from many good feedback reviews from TripAdvisor. At first, it seemed that I had some technical problems with the reservation on the date that our family is available for the dinner at Seasonal Tastes. Therefore, I decided to contact with The Westin hotel in SG via FB. Luckily, the staff of both The Westin and Seasonal Tastes contacted me back with polite and attentive responses for our request.
For the experience of the dinner, I love cold seafood with lobsters, dessert station, and polite staff with good attitudes. It would be better, if the could provide grilled station to serve the customers as well."
Great Family Lunch,Excellent place for family gathering with great food and wonderful service. There is kids buffet corner too!
Dinner,Celebrated my birthday hete. Great service from Kumar! Thank you for your hospitality! Been here a few times. Will be back.
Good buffet with a view,"Located on a high floor, this buffet restaurant in a hotel offers a lovely coastline view of Singapore unseen by most.

They offer an impressive selection of food considering the small size of the restaurant, with their dessert corner having very impressive seasonal offerings.

Our dining experience was however marred by staff shortage over the holiday period and being seated in an area with loud and brash diners who are oblivious to those around them."
Fabulous value Sunday brunch,"The plump Canadian oysters were divine, and only minorly eclipsed by the plentiful lobsters. I recommend the Thai sauce for the lobsters, and arriving bang on 12pm, in order to pace yourself and truly experience everything on offer. The prosecco package was good value for Singaporean alcohol prices, and staff were kind enough to ensure I was kept topped up. The service was really attentive, and next time I‚Äôd forego the drinks in order to ensure plenty of space for more lobsters!
This buffet is open seven days a week, however staff advised that oysters are on offer only for Sunday brunches."
Overall Experience,"Overall experience was good. We like the atmosphere & setting especially the dessert corner with the bunny backdrop as it was Easter Sunday. This was my 2nd visit but this time round, I brought my w sons there to celebrate 1 of my son 22nd birthday.

The food I rated as average although I like the lobsters & seafood but beside that not many other varieties of main course food.

Anyway, we enjoyed the night. Tks

Just 1 small thing, I indicated in my reservation that we were there to celebrate my son birthday & I thought the hotel could show some form of 'act' to make our night more memorable. We went Triple Three in Dec 18 to celebrate my wife birthday & the hotel brought a small piece of cake & candle to our table to surprise us and sang the birthday song for my wife."
Excellent lunch,"Table of 8 seated at round table with window view. Lovely salmon in soya sauce, good mix of cheese, salad, sushi and warm dishes. Dessert spread is great with 5 ice cream choices. Enjoyable lunch and good value for money."
