Pretty delicious Italian dishes,"Family-run business. Food here tastes great, better than many other Italian restaurants in Singapore. We can taste the freshness of the ingredients; comes with a price though. Things are not cheap here. Overall, good food."
I want to give it a 6th star!,"We have always been impressed with Valentino's but this latest visit is worth a special mention. We booked a celebratory lunch for a milestone birthday. I have various food restrictions and didn't feel like what was on the menu. The chef came out and spoke to me about what I can and cannot eat, and what I was looking for... what was delivered was out of this world, I told chef that it should be on the permanent menu! He really fed me from the heart... very rare in restaurants these days, that is what differentiates Valentino's. I'd recommend it any time."
Great food but slightly overpriced,"Great food but slightly overpriced. Pasta was very little barely made me full. But food was nice , just hoped that it is cheaper due to the portion of food. Service was impeccable though, so hats off to thatb"
Delicious food,This tiny place in the middle of nowhere is amazing. Excellent food and service. Italian food has gotten so commonplace but this place still stands out. A tad bit on the expensive side but worth it.
RUDE RECEPTIONIST (THE ITALIAN MIDDLE AGED LADY),"We wanted a table of 14 but was told per person has to spend $140~$150 each so we instead chose to have 3 separate tables. When we reached our diners place, we declared we have 3 reservations and the 5 of us who reached there earlier were sitting at separate tables, so we need to have 3 tables being shown to us. And I also ask the rude crude waitress are the tables near each other; she said no and exclaimed you didn't tell us before hand. Ok, I accepted that reasoning, and she quickly hassle us away. I witness myself there's only 1 table in section 2 that was occupied and the time was only 5.45pm. I thought to myself, why can't she just re-arrange the table. But I can already feel she is a difficult person. As I had mentioned earlier, there were 5 of us who will sit on different tables (because different department) but we ended up sitting all in 1 table. So I call out to a friendlier waitress (Pilipino; thank God you were there, you should be promoted) that we need our 3 tables now so we all can be sat accordingly. So she arranged for us and thank you for your understanding; unlike that Italian lady who probably don't understand English or she probably think I'm in Italy. However when my boss arrived and spoke a Chinese waiter, immediately the join our tables nearer to each other. The rude waitress approached my table and explain they will change my table to be nearer to the other 2 but I can decline to shifting if I don't want to. So you see, this restaurant is only if you are relatives of the Royals or the riches. Chef Valentino, thank you for coming out to tables to socialize and talk to us. But that rude crude waitress is just not suitable on her job, please shift her to the kitchen. All in all, we spent about $2400 for 14 persons which we already hit the so call ""minimum spending"". I love Italian food and I have been to some good Italian restaurants. There are still many good ones out there like Braceria , Lemoncello, Leno, Bruno, Etna. This restaurant only served best to the regular , big spenders (pls specify first that you are going to spent alot) Royals, celebrities, ministers."
Fabulous dinner!,Always a brilliant evening with exceptional food. Pasta dishes top notch. Every ingredient perfect and all beautifully judged.
Birthday dinner,Food is okay and on the high $$$. We were late due to heavy rain. Was asked to leave immediately after our dessert. . Not a good experience for a first timer üòï
Good food but expensive,"Home made pasta, well made, good sauces, slightly tangy risotto. All good but expensive, fairly small portions and - 2 glasses of wine at 19 and 25 dollar and no complimentary water."
My favourite of all time,I‚Äôve tried many other restaurants but I always find myself going back to this. Everything is excellent! üëçüèºüëèüèº Love it
Come just for the pasta,"Quality of seafood was just average for their prices and the portions are definitely on the small side. We had 3 different types of pasta, the sea bass and bread and burrata for starters. The pasta was consistently al dente and delicious but the fish and lobster didn‚Äôt meet our expectations. Restaurant is beautifully set and service is pleasant. Nice choice for a night out."
Terrible Service!!,"Overall service was disappointing and more than dismal.The Stuck-up Italian manager (or perhaps boss??) should have been more accommodating at the start, instead of being difficult.
Incidentally, I also just found out from a friend that this restaurant tried to rip customers off by charging exorbitant price on their wines. So be careful!
Can‚Äôt complain about the food, though a bit on the expensive side.
Singapore has many nice Italian restaurants with good food.
So I will absolutely not come back here again"
Family Lunch,Hidden gem located at the Grandstand. Plenty of parking available. Food is excellent and the service from Rose is exceptional. Just wanna say thank-you again to Rose for her service. Thumbs up!
Amazing birthday dinner spent here,"The staff were lovely, the food absolutely perfect, and the ambience transported us out of Singapore. Couldn‚Äôt fault anything in this restaurant - we would definitely come back."
Still arrogant,"Typically if you have been visiting a restaurant from time to time the regular staff would make an effort to welcome you back each time. But not Valentino Restaurant. I have been going to Valentino since their Jln Bingka days and even had an extended conversation with Valentino himself but on a recent visit no such common courtesies or even a ""how are you"" was extended by any member of the family. Despite having to downsize due to the pandemic, their ego and arrogance has not downsized accordingly. Also their no child under 5 policy is only for common folk. If you are deemed a VIP and seated in the 'private area' they will let you sneak a crying child in as they did when we were there. Sound travels."
$75 min spend even for babies.,"I‚Äôve been to this restaurant numerous times and love the food here. They recently went through a renovation and after that, Mr. Valentino wants to charge each guest a minimum of $75 per head for dinner on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I think it reasonable for adults but I wanted to eat with my 5 and 8 year old kids who needs to spend $75 per head as well. I don‚Äôt understand how they can insist this and on a Sunday night too. Mr. Valentino, can you please rethink your policy? It makes no sense to enforce a minimum spend on a 5 year old child."
An Italian Job!,"Untravellerable COVID 2020, good to find great Italian out of Italy to compensate our annual Italy food journey in Italy during pre Covid!"
Best Italian food with really friendly and professional staffs,"Best Italian restaurant in town with really friendly and professional staffs in such a cozy place. Many famous places do not care customers much but here is different. If you want to have a best quality Italian food in friendly environment, this is where you should go."
No kids friendly - if you have young children don‚Äôt go,"pleasant experience! Their team is no prepared to get family with young kids! The waiter said to my 5 year old boy he would put him in the woven if he was not quite ( seriously speaking , my boy cried). The waitresses shhhh my 20 months baby at least 7 times. If I knew the restaurant was not kids/family friendly I would never book this place to have family lunch. I have advised in my reservation we would need baby chair , so was no surprise we get young kids.

The restaurant would advise babies and toddlers are not welcome ! I would never expected this treatment at Italian restaurant at 12:00. It was a stressful lunch ! First time I faced this situation abs treatment in Singapore and we go out to have family lunch with them every Sunday .

If you have baby or/and toddlers I would say don‚Äôt go there !"
Probably the best Italian Restaurant in Singapore,"Funny staffs, lovely ambience and the food is the best. Ordered 2 appetisers, 2 pastas and all of them were excellent. Can't wait to be back again."
Great Italian at home!,Can‚Äôt travel during Covid-19 yet craving for great italian cuisine? This is it! Can‚Äôt explain further...
One of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore!,"Second time to this restaurant and still loving it! The quality of the food is very good and the service is great - the staff are all knowledgeable, prompt, and very friendly!

I went with 2 other friends this time, and we spent a total of $360 on 2 appetisers, 3 main courses and 1 cake! Not the cheapest for sure, but definitely a meal we all enjoyed and we think the price was justified!"
Delivery works perfect,"Ordered on their web, adjusting to covid times, we had a great experience. Food came on time as requested, hot and all perfectly prepared. Highly recomendable if you want to spend just a bit more than the average delivery. Worth every dollar."
"Another Visit, Another Great Evening",Visited again after a long gap. As usual the food was very good and the service excellent. The staff remembered us and our preferences from the earlier visits even though it hat had been a long time sine. Really a delight
Good food as always!,"We've been to Valentino's for over a decade, from the older small corner shop to this newer one at Turf Club, and have never been let down. Starters are unique, mains are done very well, and their desserts never disappoint."
Mama mia!,Valentino is a family fun restaurant that's not exactly located in the best place. But oh it is absolutely worth making the trip. I really enjoyed the burrata and the pasta was delicious !! The squid ink pasta with creamy crab sauce was my favourite!
Excellent dinner,Dinner service was great. The staff were very attentive. Noticed my mum wanted a certain dish just by looking at her flip pages on the menu and pointing an item to us. The dessert were excellent. Would say a great ending to an enjoyable dinner
Superb Italian food and wine in Singapore,"Without question one of our favorite restaurants in SG. Over the past 2 decades I have found it very difficult to find really good Italian food in SG ‚Äî and Valentino‚Äôs solves that problem. Many of our best dining experiences happen here.

This is a family-run restaurant that remembers you and welcomes you back. Wine recommendations have always been good to great. The freshly imported tomatoes and cheeses make a delicious appetiser. Recently we had a smoked burrata that was superb.

Momma‚Äôs chicken is delicate and delicious. I always love the pasta with tomato-cream sauce. Various ravioli dishes have been excellent. We even tried rabbit which was truly delicious. Our kids never complain about pizza. Perhaps our favorite, though, is the fried veal cutlet. Every time we order they serve us golden crispy perfection. Wow!

The cakes, for dessert, are moist and delicious. Another Wow.

The occasional wine fairs are a must-attend event.

Of course such good food does not come at discount prices. But honestly price is never an issue when I go to Valentino‚Äôs. We get far more than what we pay for. We leave very happy. It‚Äôs A Great experience.

Any negatives? For me, not really. A minimal dress code would be nice for such good dining but that is such a small thing to worry about. It would just be nice given how good the food and dining experience is."
Good Food....but a bit pricey,"We came here for a birthday party and enjoyed some great food. We started with a Burata and calamari, the Burata was soft and creamy and calamari crispy. We then followed with some pastas, pizza and fish as a main. The Crab meat and the Red prawn pasta√Ø with squiqd ink pasta were both rich and served with fresh seafood. Fish was delicious with a balsamic reduction. Kids shared a carbonara which was authentic. Finished with deserts which were all a great to the meal. Tiramisu a definite winner! Service was super attentive and friendly and the restaurant had a homely ambience. Only problem is that it was quite pricey for what it was, with many other italian places offering similar food at more affordable prices. But it is worth a visit for a special occasion!"
Still good food but pricey......,"I always like coming to this restaurant, its close to where we live and I love the family run feeling overall. A bit disappointed this time with the prices, they seem to have gone up a lot. It's now on the pricey side, which means if you are spending that much money you might as well go into town as these price levels have tons of great restaurants in that category.
All the starters are now $30+ each except the small burrata plate which was $29.90. Mains were in the mid $30's other than the 'petit' steak which was slightly tough at $45.
So 4 bottles of water, 3 starters, 3 main course, a bottle of wine, two more glasses of wine and two desserts worked out to $528. Overall the food was quite good but I still question the value for money and will think twice next time."
Pricey for average food,"The pizza and noodles are good but pretty pricey for the more average, standard tase. No kids meals. Nice and attentive service personnel. Not a real must go. Funny 80ies style interior."
. The deposit pay was not record hence lost.,Excellent restaurant but extremely bad experience using CHOPE booking app. App ask for deposit via pay pal but payment not reflect in booking hence lost.
Great place and service,Great food and great service. The meat was excellent. Good recommendation by service staff. Even the washroom is nicely decorated.
Best Italian Restaurant in Singapore,"Authentic from ambiance, people, hospitality and flavors. Love the traditional italian main course they came up with occasionally."
Consistently great Italian food,"Still one of the best I've ever had in Singapore. The pastas are so authentic in taste, you wouldn't care for its presentation much. The quality steaks are great value for money ‚Äì so indulge!"
Great food and service,"I'm surprised I never even heard of this restaurant before, and its close to where I live! I really liked the interiors, food and the personal service here. The owner Valentino came over twice and had a chat (even though he was busy), you don't see that personal service much in Singapore restaurants.
The food was very good, try the Carpaccio with Truffles to start it was outstanding. I had the Osso Buco for main course it was also very good, my wife the Turbot fish.
They have a very good selection of wines, lots of half bottles too if you prefer to go that route.
This restaurant will be one of my go-to restaurants in Singapore, a place that meets all the criteria. Dinner was about $320 for 2, starters, main courses, a bottle of wine and a cheese plate to finish off. Its pretty average for Singapore but at least you are guaranteed with the quality and service."
Home style Italian food,Kudos to the atmosphere of Valentino. The decor is superb. The atmosphere makes you feel like a pure Italian restaurant.
No more quaint feeling,Food is above average but lacks the family feeling. It's gone mass market and with the ever increasing competition in Singapore. There are much better places to go for home made Italian food like mama used to make.
Bad Experience,"We went there to celebrate my mum's birthday however the experience was far from what we expected. It was a Sat evening and we made reservation at 8.30 PM for a group of 7. The waitress arrived and told us curtly to order appetizers as it will take 30 to 45 mins for our order to arrive. She repeated this twice in a condescending manner despite telling her that we had already ordered the bread basket and would be fine with that.

I must say that I later found out that she was the sister of the restaurant owner which surprised me that she used such a tone with her customers. Anyway never again as they charge premium for this food but the service is a far cry from being even worthy of an Italian Restaurant where hospitality is key."
Most Friendly and fun restaurant,"The staff there are friendly. Knowing that we are the first time been to such place so he introduce us one by one slowly and they are super friendly.
When I told them is my colleague birthday, they gave her a whole cake to let us have the celebration with everyone has a share of the cake.

The food there is nice, ambience superb.

Thanks"
Great Italian Food with Passion,"Da Valentino is a classic It is like everyones' favourite Italian canteen where you can get great, sometimes outstanding traditional Italian food. I love especially the Irish beef and the warm efficient service provided. Great wine selection at reasonable prices make Da Valentino together with Ristorante Takada two of the great bargains in Singapore. Perfect for a celebration or an intimate dinner for two. As a bonus Chef Valentino has to be one of the friendliest, most obliging Chefs in Singapore."
Last dinner of long vacation,"One of my favorite restaurants in the world. The perfect ending to such a memorable vacation. Hands down, the world's best veal milanese. Amazing house olive oil. And the highest world class service. Cant wait to come back my next trip to Singapore."
dinner,ristorante da valentino used to be at rifle range road and my friend introduced me to this place. service is professional and food quality is on par with that of other well known italian restaurants.
Hearty food and good service,"Entrees were good, Pastas were al dente and well cooked. Good hearty italian fare. Service was on point."
nice place and good food,"We enjoyed everything we ate. Burrata cheese was excellent. Beef, pasta squid were also good. Ambiance and service were also excellent. Authentic Italian food!"
Good Italian place with great ambience,"This Italian restaurant is tucked away within Turf Club. Thus quite a commute if you are not familiar with the area..

Nice ambience and spacious.

Food was good. My favourite was the Tiramisu thou..

Pricey but a good place if you want to have some good Italian food. Also a good choice for parties and birthdays..

Very friendly service...

Again would rate it GOOD but TripAdvisor does not have that rating..

If the food was better and prices abit more reasonable would have rated Very Good."
Great service and Comfortable Ambience,"I was there for a business dinner with a group of colleagues - a total of 16 pax.

The ambience of the restaurant is welcoming . The owner of the restaurant and his team are very professional, patient and friendly and made us feel like we are home. This place has been visited by numerous celebrities and politicians (local and overseas).

The food are served to perfection and though the price is towards the higher side, the portion served justify the costs.

The service team led by Dennis is very detailed and will attend to any request we have rather immediately (even when they are busy)."
The best food and service ever,"The food at this restaurant is probably the best Italian food you will ever have anywhere in the world. The service is at another level altogether. It was exceptional. And not one, but every waiter was fantastic. It‚Äôs the culture at this restaurant... to ensure the client is happy."
Great food but expensive!,"10 of us came for dinner (my brother's treat). The food was good but expensive, each entree around $30. We tried pizza, pasta, steak, the soups and desserts. We had a great dinner but I wouldn't pay the prices to come back. There are cheaper restaurants that aren't so far away from the main strip that are just as good."
"Great food and top notch service, but really expensive","Wanted to eat at this place but never expected the food to be so so good, our server recommended a few dishes to share all were superbly executed, the kids even had 2 orders of the grilled octopus, this place was packed on a Saturday evening. Overall a enjoyable evening."
Anniversary dinner,"We came here to celebrate our anniversary. The food was delicious and filling. They offered set meals vs ala carte. We were told that ala carte is a better option, so we order the burrata cheese as a starter, fettuccini spicy sausage and moscato marinated pork chop as mains, and rum&raisin pannatone with icecream as dessert (special Xmas menu)- which they prepare on a special plate to celebrate our anniversary.

The waiters were friendly and approachable. The ambience was good.

The only down side was they don‚Äôt allow us to purchase pre-paid Chope vouchers on the spot, unlike other restaurants which we went such as spuds and aprons. This should be written clearly on the webpage.

Otherwise, I will still recommend it."
"A pasta, a Buschetta, a pizza, a chop and breads.","Supposedly an authentic Italian restaurant, situated quite far away from the Garden by bays, yet we took the trouble of spending a small fortune in just getting there.
It was a family celebration, and the chosen cuisine was Italian. Hence here we were, a party of 4 adults and two small children.
The children are not choosy. They love their pasta, wherever they go. The adults have a problem. They have to choose.
We ordered a Buschetta, a favorite of mine. Unfortunately, not up to expectations. I have had better at home. The Pizza was however quite tasty but the chop, though cooked to perfection, with the meat falling off, did not really tickle my taste buds. The fish in a lime sauce was the only dish, i could get myself to like.
It is a fine dining restaurant with prices to match and you need an appointment to get in.
Frankly, I think it is over hyped and I may not, left to me, go again."
Great ambience and good food,Great ambience and good food. Service was pretty good and it has that Europe vibe. Price was alright too
Exceeded our expectations,We certainly did not expect the elegance of the restaurant judging from the ambiance outside! Once we sat down we realized that we were in for a great meal. The service was excellent and the food even better. Unfortunately because of our scheduled departure in two days we will not be able to try other dishes and we missed the deserts so we will definitely return the next time we return to Singapore. Bravo
Great Food,"the food is fantastic, service is great. However too many people seems to have found out the same and the place was very crowded even on a weekday night. the setting looks romantic but too noisy for couple dinners."
Great food,"Second time here. Although location a bit out, it‚Äôs not difficult to find. Had the squid ink fettuccine- portion not big but enough for me - creamy and delicious. My friends had lobster pasta which was on promotion. Tasted great too. Staff are friendly."
"Excellent food, lovely ambience","This restaurant is run by an Italian family and their food is just devine. Everything I've had there had been just delicious and the staff are also very good in advising on portions/ amounts. The burrata is just scrumptious and really worth a taste.
If you book in advance, it's nice to sit in one of the little alcoves, great for a group of 4 adults.
(I'm almost conflicting in my thoughts of putting this review/ tip on as now it might be so much harder for me to get the seat!) ha ha. Go and enjoy, it's great here."
One of the best!,"One of the best Italian restaurant in Singapore! Nice food, ambience, and the experience server will recommend the dishes for your group. A world class service experience!"
Good food and ambience,"The food here was truly tasty and authentic. We just visited Italy over the summer and the food is comparable. Slightly costly for the pasta dishes though I have to say that the quality is great. Service was excellent. We ordered the 1kg Florentine steak to share, and fortunately it was steak night, so we got a good discount for it."
Greatest Showman,"What a wonderful dinner yet again by Valentino, who put on a great mushroom risotto dish that featured a healthy dose of truffles. Everyone enjoyed the evening with a recommended pairing of both white and barbaresco wines. The wild boar penne was simply delicious and well blended as a pair. Valentino is always quite the showman but the risotto served from the large cheese block was memorable."
Food With a Soul,I had the lamb penne ragu and it felt so heartwarming to eat it. The service staff were attentive and it made my visit a very pleasant experience.
The restaurant with nice atomosphere,"Food, drink, people and atmosphere are very nice.I heard this restaurant is the best Italian restaurant in Singapore and I agree this.Especially I love the pasta! I wanna go there again."
A tad underwhelming,"What's good:
1. Sincere service- staff really serve with heart
2. Great variety and food is ok
3. A lot of rich and famous people have visited (? Not sure if that's a plus point but lots of nice framed pics)

What's not so good:
1. Food is kinda mediocre for the price
2. Everything tastes like it is doused in a lot of salt. Could be our tastebuds though..

On the whole, worth visiting if u like saltier food! Otherwise the after taste is not great cos of the salt..."
Absolutely delicious !!,What a memorable meal was a bit of a drive to get to but soso glad I did !!! The food was spectacular tried 3 dishes all were outstanding and what can I say about the service was beyond perfect absolute gem of a restaurant a must must visit
Good pasta average pizza,"This restaurant has been around since 2005, and is run by real Italians. The decor is reminiscent of Italy. Apparently they come from Milan.

The truffle pappardelle and saffron fettuccine with prawns were both delicious. Hand made pasta as it should be.

The pizza however was not Naples style.

The tiramisu was among the best in Singapore!"
Ladies‚Äô night,Great place for catch up over a good meal! Ladies‚Äô night and pampered with good service too. Thank you.
Italian Restaurant,"Been here few times. Had very good experiences the first few times but was rather disappointed with the standard and consistency of the food this time. Hosted a business lunch for table of 10 this time. Disappointed with the steak which was medium to well done. I‚Äôve asked the waiter why didn‚Äôt they ask for our preference for the doneness of the steak, they replied we don‚Äôt because we will cook it medium rare. I told them it was medium to well done. The waiter just shrugged his shoulders and walked away.

My client also spotted a cockroach on the next table and alerted the waiter about it. A few of them quickly scrambled to catch it. No apologies whatsoever was made by the waiter nor the manager.

Overall I am disappointed with the service, cleanliness, inconsistency and quality of the food."
Awesome Italian and great tomahawk .. restaurant entrance is near the tennis center,"We were a group of 9 and had a mix of 3 different types of pasta/risotto, tomahawk steak and pork.. all in all everyone said everything tasted awesome

This was the first time visiting this place for a number of us. The one complaint is that it was hard to find the restaurant as many walked through turf city only to find that the restaurant entrance was not in turf city but on the outer end of it (near the tennis center).."
"The food of da Valentino is always consistently good, and you can always look forward to have a great meal here.","Ristorante Da Valentino is our favourite Italian restaurant in Singapore. The food is always consistently good, and you can always look forward to have a great meal here."
Great food with excellent service and a personal touch - Love going back!,"My fiance and I decided to go back to Ristorante Da Valentino's on Saturday evening. It was the location of our very first date three years prior so will always be a special place to us. We have been multiple times since but this, I must admit was the first trip back for a while.

As usual you are greeted warmly at the front entrance and guided to your table by smiling and attentive staff, passed a menu and not hurried to place your order.

The restaurant was full on Saturday however the staff are always attentive to all the tables whilst keeping a relaxed and friendly attitude at all times, a sign of quality.

Now the food, it is always good, I just always make the mistake of ordering too much!

I had two courses this time around starting with the Fettuccine al Granchio followed by the Ossobuco with cheese risotto. Both dishes were beautiful and well presented.

At Valentinos you can, if you like, spend a fortune on the wine however they are also well stocked on the more moderately priced selections for those of us without endlessly deep pockets. We selected a nice Sauvignon Blanc to enjoy with our meal.

Although we did not choose to have dessert this time around, we were still treated to a complimentary scoop of ice cream as it was our anniversary, a nice touch from the restaurant who had taken the time to read my comments when placing my reservation, something which is simply not done by most other places!

Valentinos really is a fantastically well run Italian family restaurant that stands alone in Singapore for it's quality of service and friendliness of staff who clearly want to work there and are actually interested in the food and wines that they are serving.

We will continue to go back for as long as they choose to stay open."
"Delicious Food, Great Ambience & Service,","Our party of 6 had dinner. The place was very spacious, with a cosy Italian ambience. The staff were friendly & helpful.
The food was great but comes in small portions.
The location wasn't great - we got lost looking for the restaurant.
We enjoyed our evening but find dinner a little expensive."
Great Italy food for family or biz meal,"Can see why this is a popular place. Food is made meticulously and nice wine pairing. Kumar was especially helpful and we just kept ordering more. Advice when they serve the hone made bread, ask for the cheese to come along if u have the wine, it is really good cheese that they have to. I chose the beef stew and it is especially tender and close to melt away in my mouth. Portion is not huge but ask for the squid ink pasta with crabmeat to go along.

Great Italian food by the Valentino family. Thanks for being here in Singapore."
Rejected. No interest in returning.,"Turned away at the door. Restaurant was empty. Was told 'full this evening."" Called 5 min later as was able to make reservation."
Italy,It feels like Italy. When you are almost growing up in Italy it feels like Home. I love the place. Thanks
Must apologise to my taste buds for not dining here before,"This place is without a doubt one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore. I was so unfortunate to have only tried it now.

A restaurant run by an Italian family, I felt I was walking into an underground cellar as I came in. The main dining area is big and spacious. The stars for the evening though: the food and the service staff.

Not only were the waiters always on hand to refill our glasses, they even went out of their way to help us as we had our 2 month old baby girl to tend to through the evening.

Our table was filled with delicious Italian dishes (burrata, parma ham, ciabatta, calamari, pizzas, panna cotta). Our top picks were, however, the squid ink fettuccine with crabmeat, and the fettuccine with prawns in Saffron sauce.

One down side is the fact that it is one of the harder to locate restaurants at the Grandstand. Best route is to turn right where the cage football pitches are, then make a left and go straight till the end to find a small parking area just in front of the restaurant."
Excellent Italian food,"Our go to restaurant every year for Italian food!! Love their squid ink pasta, burrata cheese and lobster pasta"
Wondeful dining experience,Overall the experiemce was fantastic. Food is fantastic with good service and the ambience is great.. Would definately be back here again for next occasion.
Authentic,"I have always heard about this family-run restaurant are so I decided to pay a visit. Eaten linguine with clams and lobster pasta too, truly delicious....pasta is cooked the Italian way...al dente, which is excellent. Desserts were good too, I recommend the semifreddo; bruschetta should have a little more garlic spread over the bread and chopped tomato could be a little more seasoned however the food was tasty, simple and authentic so this restaurant definitely met my expectations."
Great Service and Good Food,Cosy Atmosphere for a meal and the service by the staff were great. The food was nice and was even told by the staff we ordered enough for 2 (Pretty good for us in case we over ordered) . Overall recommended!
"Great food, good service",Had the crab pasta & my husband had the grilled lamb. Both were delicious. The service was very attentive too! Place was full on a Tuesday night!
The best Italian in Singapore,"This place is run by an Italian family and has been around for a few years now. It serves the best Italian fare alone with an unparalleled wine collection. If u want the best Italian in spore, Look no further"
"great food, great service, great afternoon","we just reached home and can‚Äôt wait to get my finger in putting in a review of our lunch today. we were at turf club and our friend selected this restaurant by random. we were lucky to have a table. obviously we did not make any reservation since it was a random choice. the food tasted excellent. the siciliana fish was wonderful. the fish meat was tender and fragrance. the sauce was flavorful. the salad drizzled with olive oil on the side was fresh. i wish there‚Äôs room for desert. next time, perhaps. yea, we had an expensive lunch but with such great food and service, they were reasonably priced. we will return again!"
All I Can Say Is ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù,"This is an amazing restaurant, fantastic food and gracious, attentive service. It is expensive, but for that special occasion, it is well worth the price."
Excellent food and great hospitality!,"LOVED the place and the food. Neatly tucked away from the predominant Singaporean hustle and bustle, Valentino's offers hearty Italian food that is sure to satisfy everyone's taste buds. Had the best burrata and panna cotta in the city. The food is divine and traditional with a bit of modernity. The mushroom risotto with saffron was heavenly. Loved the salad with pine nuts, burrata, penne arrabiata, marinated artichokes and the coconut gelato. By far the best Italian fare I have had in Singapore. Highly recommend the restaurant! They have gained a regular :)"
great good with amazing services,"8 of us arrive during lunch time and we let the chef pick for us..

well - it just superb super quality with a great services from the host .. like a family stay

thank you for a great hospitality which is very rare in singapore to have those original warm services"
Great Food and Ambience,The food is delicious and reasonably priced. Definitely worth the visit. The lunch buffet priced at $45++ is worth the money
Delicious food with amazing staff,"Went there to celebrate my sister's birthday. Food was extremely delicious. Staffs are friendly, approachable and jovial. They gave advise/suggestions on how to enjoy the food better. They celebrated my sister's birthday lively. Overall, it's a beautiful, yummlicious and happy lunch we had! (: Highly recommended!!"

Family Dinner,"Valentino‚Äôs is our favorite family restaurant. For us it‚Äôs all occasion place and we‚Äôre there at least once a month. Hosted my mother-in-law to dinner on Sunday. For starters we had the grilled octopus, Bromio Salad and the baked eggplant. We ordered 2 portions of the grilled octopus (because we like it that much!!). Succulent and it was grilled to perfection. Highly recommend this. The Bromio Salad is also an all time favorite. The garden mix with pine nuts, apple slices, cheese and olives is a refreshing summer salad. For mains, we shared a crabmeat pizza. It‚Äôs slightly spicy, topped generously with fresh crabmeat. My wife and I had the baked sea bass fillet. The fillet is freshly sliced and oven baked for 20 minutes. Serves on fresh tomato slices and greens on the side. Highly recommend. My mother-in-law ordered a crabmeat pasta which was done with a light tomato based sauce and the fresh crabmeat made all the difference. Ye children ordered a seafood risotto, king prawn pasta (a special for day) and a crabmeat squid inked pasta. They all throughly enjoyed their mains. And indeed it was the quality of the seafood that really made the difference. The staff are knowledgeable and attentive. Kumar and Priya, the seniors there never fail to make us feel welcomed. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to enjoy a great Italian meal and fantastic ambience."
Heartwarming meal for a birthday celebration,"As usual, Valentino goes extra mile to make our meal special. When we entered, we were greeted by friendly family members of the chef. Food wise it's always spot on. Loved the carpaccio, vongole, pizza and crab meat pasta in pink sauce. Wine selection was amazing. Staff surprised us with a birthday cake upon learning we went there for a birthday meal."
Homely italian,"Came here a few times for celebratory meals. I like the homely, friendly ambience. Just like some italian restuarant in florence. We had the fresh oysters which was that day's special, although fresh, i think they were overpriced. We ordered the burrata, nice but could do with more of the balsamic vinegar bits. Risotto was very good. We had the tomahawk, also excellently done. I love the panna cotta with just the right consistency and level of wobbliness. We also had the freshly made donuts as dessert. I found the service staff, although friendly, but tried to hardsell us some daily special items. I thought it sounded abit pushy. And at a nice restaurant, they shouldnt be doing that.

Overall, i would come back since the food is nice and reasonably priced."
We were recommended & so glad to have sampled!,"We had emailed our booking from UK before the trip & all was confirmed. Due to heavy traffic & a taxi driver not totally sure of location, we were 10 mins late - we were lucky as our table was about to be given away!
This is a positive comment in that the restaurant was buzzing & space could not be wasted. The food, ambience, experience was a joy. The local staff were a little too enthusiastic thinking us greenhorn tourists but it was a thoroughly good evening with great attention to detail."
Fantastic!,The buffet lunch is fantastic value and you can eat a good range of delicious dishes. I love the crab meat pasta and miss it when I'm not in Singapore!
Venerable authentic Italian family restaurant,"Located at Grandstand and used to be known as Turf City, this authentic Italian restaurant is run by a Italian family. The walls are covered with photos of VIPs and celebrities. The quality of the food lives up to the hype and the service is impressive as well. The menu is quite comprehensive, requiring more visits soon ..."
Tell them Mario sent you. For Those Who Know Authentic Northern Italian Food....Search No More!,"I have read many of the reviews and am humored by those who had a less than pleasant experience. My family is actually from Ticino (Actually Switzerland) but very familiar with Northern Italian cooking. The Risotto Milanese is very authentic which is difficult to find outside of Milano! The last serving of Risotto I had that was this good was sitting on a roof top in Milan looking at the Duomo and conversing with my wife. The Buratta is exquisite if you love creamy deliciousness! Panna Cotta for dessert is always a favorite of mine and if you like Panna Cotta I think you too will enjoy it. The staff is very attentive, the wine is authentic and enjoyable and the owners are a wonderful family for anyone that is willing to get to know them. So if you are looking for traditional Northern Italian food this is a great choice. Remember that you are one half of the experience so if you walk in a Stugots you probably won't have a good time but if your heart is light and you are friendly it will be a night to remember!"
Delicious food and great service,A little pricey but really great value for food! - Good cuts of meat and the grilled octopus special for the day was yummy!
Good food,"Great pastas. There are some well priced dishes. But I tend to avoid chef's recommendations as they can be quite expensive. To steer clear of too high a bill, stick to menu items."
"Good Service, Good food, Pricey","Food was exquisite, though pricey. Selection of wine limited. Service was attentive and commendable. The only complaint was the female toilet was dirty and messy (due to a faulty flush), else it will be a near perfect experience."
Love love love this place!!!,"Valentino had always been my personal go-to place for Italian food.

Brought my family here for a casual dinner and it became their favourite as well.

I need not recommend as all their food is amazing.

Wait staff are well informed about the menu and always ready with recommendations.

Try it - I strongly recommend this place!!!"
