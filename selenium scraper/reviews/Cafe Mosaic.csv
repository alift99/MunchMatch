Cafe Mosaic Lunch Buffet,The spread was good. The waitresses and staff were professional and polite. They were helpful and very accommodating. The food at the different stations was always replenished.
We will be back!,"Special Thanks to Mr Shan (F&B Manager) for your excellent and most pleasant service! Other than the dessert spread being a little limited, everything else was just lovely! Thanks."
Buffet offer differs after Covid,Used to have exceptional spread across all table counter for 1:1 offers but somehow they have cut down alot probably due to inflation and higher cost
Worth the money,"I book for 6.30 but i was late cos i have to shower my kid after school and there was slow traffic during that busy timing.
I was late. But nevertheless the table was kept for us with a table of 12. I went straight to the sashimi area. Gosh it was so fresh n chewy.. alaksa crab legs too.. . My favorite station is still the oysters! It was plump n juicy. Well as for other food cooked food the variety was more than engf for me and family. The service is good too and before i left at ard 9pm. I still see them refill the cakes where not much customers left. The oni thing i hope to see next time is probably some juices? Cos i dont take coffee nor tea. $118++ 1 for 1 is worth the price. Will visit again."
Great food and great service,"Zee was attentive and very helpful. Food was amazing.
Service was excellent.Wouldd definitely come again."
Zeeshan,Very good service from zeeshan. He is very humble and take care of our table very well. Food was great and ambience was very nice
So So Good ...,"Firstly, we were let into the inner hall. We told the Supervisor or manager that we prefer a table nearer to the main hall as the inner hall have a big group of diners. But was told that the whole hall is fully booked. From 12 pm to 2pm, the inner hall was not fully booked as advised. There are still many tables available at the main hall. The foods range was not great so as the desserts too.The worse was the almond with barley dessert, which was tasteless!"
"have only coffee and tea, surprisingly that no juices, not worth to try at this price!","Very limited choices of food, the taste is just ok, surprisingly they have only got coffee and tea, no juices, not worth at this price, will not visit again"
Above average experience,"As it‚Äôs seafood buffet, had high expectations for it. However felt that the variety was not as much as I expected. Would have been better if there was a wider selection of seafood. The oysters were at another side of the dining area. Didn‚Äôt know about it until we saw someone with it. The cooked food and dessert selections were okay. We felt that it was still overpriced despite the 1 for 1 promotion. Good for experience and occasional indulgence"
Extravagant Buffet Experience,Loved everything from A-Z. The fresh oysters were so succulent and every other available dishes were prepared to perfection. Was amazed at the culinary skills of the chefs. Enjoy my dining experience with pleasant diners and service staff. Deserved more than 5 stars. Will definitely put this is restaurant on my top list for all future celebrations.
Back Again ... (Terrible),"Regular of Mosaic before Covid cause their oysters were good & fresh. This time round back, the serving style changed and properly carter for the crowd and turn over rate brought down the standard and quality of the food. As oyster lover, I used to take up to 40 but that night I only took 20 or more cause it simply too awful to put into my mouth.

Varies of food also cut down a lot. That was feedback to me from my kids & wife, without me asking them.

My last visit 3-Sep'22 will be my last time patronize them."
Satisfactory dinning but can be better!,"It was about 2.5 years since our last visit here and riding on the extended holidays from national day, we revisited again recently on a weekday instead. (our previous visit was on a weekend)

The cafe has recently reopened for buffet. It has a cosy and nice ambience and think it has been renovated.

The lunch buffet spread was quite limited with International, Asian and local dishes that included seafood on ice (though quite limited variety), stir-fried and deep fried food items, pastries and desserts etc. There were ""hits and misses"" of the food items.

Some of the nice dishes on the day of our visit included the black bean steamed fish, stir fried long beans, stir fried prawns, herbal soup, honey pork ribs, noodles and selfmade salad.

On the other hand, the not so good dishes included the sushi maki (they were generally hard like stone and not fresh), there wasn't salmon sashimi, the mee siam was not cooked well with the rice vermicelli were not thoroughly cooked and were hard and the gravy was not sour enough as it should be. Some cakes were overly sweet.

Coffee and tea were inclusive in the buffet, together with the cut fruits and ice cream. Although there were a few varieties of tea sachets, there was one, the more popular and common one (green tea and related).

Service by staff were generally good and efficient in clearing used plates and utensils to the extent that even one spoon not used, the staff would walk over and cleared it. Then we realized the lady staff who served the area where we were seated was a ""trainee"" and probably that explained why she's so super efficient in clearing the table so often. That's good but if too often and over a fork or spoon, it could be a disturbance. On the kitchen side, food were regularly replenished and that's good.

On value for money would say was fairly reasonable as it was $38++ per pax but there wasn't any credit card or membership discounts though at some places, they were slightly cheaper with more/tastier food. (do check out my earlier reviews)

Overall we had a satisfactory lunch but surely there were areas for improvement. Given this experience, we are unlikely to try it's dinner (though we had previously tried before too) as they are having 1-for-1 promotions.

Not worth for the money,"Even though it was so-called 1-for-1, the price came up was not cheap, SGD70/person. The food is very disappointed that sashimi is only salmon and octopus; 2 types of buns without any cheese; seafood spread is very common with additional long leg crab(leg only); no dim sum; very few counters serving food."
underwhelmed by the selection and the food,"It was an underwhelming experience. No sashimi (the closest alternative was the smoked salmon). The selection was also very limited. Dessert and Sushi station took some time to ""replenish"" the empty trays. Would have expected more for the amount we were paying. There were a few trainees serving us. They were attentive and cleared our plates in a timely manner."
Choices of seafood is limited,"If you‚Äôre here for seafood, it‚Äôs very limited. I feel that cooked food has more variety. Dessert was a disappointment. As a sweet tooth person, I skipped that. Yep. Will not visit again."
Not worth the price before 1 for 1 discount,"Not much variety of food can be select, most disappointed part on drinks, only plain cold water and coffee type allow for choose, no juice found on dinner buffet."
Good service,"I am very happy with the good service experience with one of the manager, did not manage to get his name. Thank you for the out of the box experience."
Excellent,Good service and nice foods. The price is reasonable and the foods are very yummy. My family enjoyed it very much. Hope that Carlton will keep the same price til end of the year because we will definitely come again.
Buffer dinner on 27 May 2022,"the reservation team responded to email request was superfast/and accommodating.
Requested for a surprise for my son's birthday, Cafe offer a slide of cake for the surprise celebration.
Thank you Michele and her team as well as the Cafe staff for the wonderful experience and service."
Terrible service - Just walk off without dining-in,"Reservation made a month ago for hotpot set lunch for 5pax on 8/5/21. A day before, I made initiative to call the cafe for confirmation. On actual day upon arrival, we were informed that the cafe have limited hotpots and each table will only be limited to 2 hotpots orders and was even suggested we share the 2 hotpots amongst the 5pax even thou it is supposed to be an individual hotpot set meal as advertised on their website. At that moment, there was only a table of 2 diners, how can there be a shortage of hotpots !  Isnt it ridiculous excuses for whatever reasons they have ? If the cafe has such a limitation for set meal, why we were not being inform beforehand as it was a pre-reservation a month ago  ?  You have spoiled our prearranged occasion. What a disappointment  with the service of a ""4 Star Hotel""  !"
Good affordable food and service.,"Good affordable food and service.
Lunch set meals at $9.90++ local cuisine.
Spacious.
Breakfast can be crowded but sitting is fast. Good variety of choices. Bread, juices, coffee/tea and fruits served separately after your own your main course- continental breakfast, American breakfast, congee or Nasi Lemak.
Good service."
HOT POT & TASTE OF SINGAPORE,Excellent staff service. Fresh food ingredients. Cleaniless and tidy. Conducive environment. Good value with discount.
Affordable ala carte lunch SGD 9.90,"Impress of their service staff, beside serving, attentive offer meal and set recommendation. It's rare to find in Singapore. Decor in the reception is comfortable and warm, giving guest a place like home. üëç"
Good,"Have a good and nice dinner with my wife at Cafe Mosaic.Everything is good for the food,environment and service.Thanks to Cafe Mosiac."
"Nice ambience, fresh food and good service.","A must go place if you are looking for a buffet. has got food variety and seafood was very fresh, especially oyster. staffs are friendly also so willing to go back again."
"Nice ambience, Good service and Wide spread of food~","It has been 10 years since our last visit (August 2010) and so we decided to come back to try out the cafe again and see any surprises or changes from our last visit. As it was weekend, the cafe was quite crowded.

Upon arriving at the hotel, guests were required to have their body temperature taken in wake of the Covid-19 scare. Shortly we were at the entrance of the cafe and then ushered to our table by the friendly staff. Must commend that the service staff here are all very friendly and polite, attentive and efficient in clearing the used plates and credit must go to them!

The cafe has indeed undergone some renovations and now is much more spacious, cosy and nice, especially with the ceiling blue lights. There's also a small section for kids where on the day of our visit, there was balloon decoration activities!

In terms of food spread, it had quite a wide variety, ranging from seafood, to local delights, Japanese sushi and salmon, a live cooking station for porridge and laksa, good wide of pastries and kuehs, fresh and cut fruits, ice cream, tea and coffee. The variety surely surpassed our expectations as we have read from recent reviews about their lack of spread. Having said that, there were several ""hits and misses"" of the food which I will briefly state.

In terms of nice food, that included the pig intestine's soup (pig maw) that was flavourful and nice! The seafood, like the mini crayfish and prawns were fresh; the chicken (white and roast) were nice; the pastries and kuehs were overall tasty! The spread of fruits was excellent with water melon, papaya, pineapple and dragon fruits and also got apples and oranges!

For poor faring food, that included the Sushi and salmon, they were frozen and hard, not fresh; the porridge and laksa though at live cooking, were disappointing. For the former, very bland and tasteless and the latter, more like chilli noodles soup and not laksa, as there wasn't any feel of coconut milk or fragrance and too watery and not milky as it should be. Some dim sum items like the siew mai was not nice and too hard despite being steamed but the soon kueh was satisfactory.

There were many other items like the stir fried lamp, spaghetti, squids, ice cream, bread, ice kachang etc, either they were passable or didn't leave much of the impression for me.

Something happened towards the end of the dinning. One of the ceiling light bulbs (behind me) exploded with a loud sound! The glasses scattered around but fortunately, I was not at all affected but noticed the glasses on the table behind me (luckily no one was sitting there). With that, some diners nearby looked a bit shocked and the staff had to switch off all the ceiling lights and activated the engineering team to come by. The captain or manager, also came forward to me and asked if I was ok or being ""hurt"".

Well, not surprising for me as not long ago, I read from newspapers and watched on TV news that the hotel had fire alarm activated due to short-circuit or smoke detected in the power room. This maybe a common issue to the hotel.

Other than this, our dinning experience was overall pleasant and nice.

And finally, we were using DBS card and that entitled to 50% discount for each diner and so it was quite a good value for money."
Dinner buffet,I don‚Äôt find the food is good. Limited selection not much variety. Food not much replenish too when finished. Service is average.
Family Gathering,I booked a table for 5 person but a day before Tuesday night the number went up to 11 person. That night was my birthday celebration plus a send off for my niece to University in Australia. It was really a fun filled night.
Good service and kids activities,"The service was good and there are some kids activities my kids enjoyed. However, the food selection is not so good. Maybe because there is 50% off."
Cheap and good,"Overall not bad for a family lunch. Do not expecting too much varieties but it is acceptable. Pretty crowded and noisy, perhap it is priced quite affordable using credit card promo."
Great spacious hotel restaurant with good service,Huge and spacious space. Great service from staffs. Fresh seafood and sashimi. Fast top up of food and great deal for wine.
Good standard buffet breakfast,"If you are after an easy going hotel buffet breakfast which is not bad value compared to other hotels, then this is not bad. There is english breakfast standards as well as asian options. The omelette that the chef cooks in front of you was delicious. The coffee is very ordinary though. Good selection of juices, cereals and also pastries. The tables are also a decent size, not the mini tables that can barely fit two peoples plates on them."
Food Menu,Lack of food varieties. Lack of gravy menu.Could have been better if the hotel offer menu for the kids as well. Lack of local cuisine.
Excellent servvice and food,"I had a Christmas dinner with my family for the very time in this restaurant. I was greeted from the beginning, enjoyed the well prepared buffet spread and service rendered. Highly recommended."
Very popular buffet here in,Very popular buffet here in Singapore and it is definitely one of the more value for money (if there‚Äôs some perks with certain credit cards) Good spread of warm dishes but pales in the cold cuts though. However they are all fresh and tasty. It would definitely be better if there‚Äôs fresh salmon sashimi instead of smoked. The saving grace is the scallops.
Good Service and good food,Friendly and helpful staff although buffet style. Directions asked were politely given and food was replenish fast and table quickly cleared. Good food.Oyster was yummy fresh and clean. Very good spread of local and other food.
Buffet lunch at Cafe Mosaic,Went for buffet lunch at Cafe Mosaic at Carlton Hotel. The spread and variety was good and fresh. i like the duck noodle soup and fried carrot cake. They also have good soups and desserts.
Buffet Seafood and meat dinner,"We went for the Sunday dinner. More costly for weekends as it was seafood and meat theme. Use of POSB/DBS card offer it at 50%discount per pax, paid SGD 65 per pax. Food was considered good for price paid. Included coffee and tea. Free flow free drinks and fruit juice chargeable at SGD5++. The soups were v good. We had seafood soup and lotus peanut soup that day. Egg tart was great too. The oysters were freshly shelled by your choice."
Good place for dinner,The location is very good that just a short distance from the MRT Station. The overall service is excellent.
Totally disappointed,Went to celebrate my wedding anniversary on 13 Nov & was shocked & disappointed that 75% of the restaurant was filled with ppl attending seminar in the hotel. It was noisy n not a relaxing place to be at. Food variety not many. Total about 8 including 2 carbs. Lotus leaf rice was dry n hard. Mee goreng soggy. Both like overnight food. Cakes variety not many too. Cakes & fruits were not replenished though left an hour before buffet ended at 230pm. Gave feedback to cashier n her reply was because it's 1 for 1 & it's cheap. If it's because of these reasons then hotel should not have promotions & give these lousy food. Will never ever go there for any meal agn & will not recommend anybody there for meals too.
An enjoyable lunch buffet setting,"The buffet has a variety of cooked food, seafood and sushi available. There were several condiments such as honey mustard sauce, shoyu (soy) sauce and wasabi. Breads and salads have a selection to choose. The desserts were mainly cakes.

The view was calming to look at and the tables were set neatly. I want to thank the staff on 17 November 2019 (lunchtime) for their efforts to make our lunch gratifying, and how they were friendly towards diners at the buffet.

Overall, the atmosphere and staff were pleasing as they made our time spent delightful."
Buffet lunch,"Smoked salmon is very nice.. The activity for kids also good. The cakes also nice.. I like the peanut butter chocolate cake, jelly cake"
Worth of money,"I love the restaurant's atmosphere, it makes people fell so relax while enjoying the meal. 5 stars for fresh food expecially sashimi & prawn as well as nice staff."
Not bad But...,"Ok but can‚Äôt redeem car park since only 3 of us. Anyway, was told only $3 redemption with 4 paying adults."
Great service and activities for kids,"Good service by cafe mosaic, and arranged for birthday cake with a candle.
Special mentioned staff- Kelvin and his team who are always checking on clearing the tables as well as other needs of the diners. Kelvin is always in his best smile and approachable self.

Food wise , can have more variety , though the seafood spread is really huge! Some sushi section though but no sashimi.only smoked salmon.

Interesting to have activities to engage the young ones. First, balloon sculptures were given to the kids, next- kids are invited to muffin making and story telling. The staff at the station are always doing their best to engage the kids!"
Excellent Food! Excellent Staff!,"Fanstasic spread of food, ranging from seafood to sushi and even vegetarian selection. The crayfish chilli was so delicious. Fresh oysters! I love their prawn mee soup and pork ribs water cress soup.

Service staff were all very polite and friendly. Dirty plates were cleared promptly. Thank you Amy, Lim,and all service staff, etc for the excellent service.

I will definitely come back here for another family gathering!"
Great dinner experience,"Second time at Cafe Mosaic, its as good as the first. Wide variety of meats and seafood. Also received a call to inform about the change of a dish.Staff also offered a bowl of lemon water for us to wash our hands."
Dinner,"It was my 3rd time eating. Everything was good, Except the Snow Crab Legs. It was a disappointment . The shells was soft and the meat has shrink. Not the usual one which i have ate."
Dinner buffet,"Food variety is poor for the price. There are many others buffet in this price range that offer better value and taste better, example Marriott Cafe at tangs."
Fresh Oyster,Second time visited Very fresh oyster Worth the price 1 for 1 cozy place and service team very attentive and polite
Food average and limited selection,Average food and limited selection. Limited food selection despite on a weekend. Better opinion elsewhere given the same price range.
Dinner with Habibi,It was a great dinner though the choices were not as expected. Would be great if the choices would be expanded. It was a meat and seafood dinner but the menu is mostly on seafoods.
Good food and good service,The dishes are nice and fresh. The crab meat are intact but not sticking to the shell. The oysters are freshly open on the spot. The services are absolutely good. They clear your plate quickly.
Dining Experience at Cafe Mosaic,It's my second visit and satisfied with the food provided. The service served by the serving crew members also very good especially with their polite and smiling face. The ambience is good and will consider for coming celebration again if there is 1 for 1 buffet offer available.
Not Bad!,Decided to check out Cafe Mosaic since DBS offer 50% on lunch buffet. What I like about this restaurant is that table are huge unlike most other hotel buffet restaurant. Service associate generally friendly and very accommodating. Buffet selection rather ordinary but hey... how much can one eat for lunch. Best to call to make advance booking as we noticed lots of office staff tend to go large group booking. Overall experience is great.
Great service & awesome food,Cafe Mosaic has provide very good variety of buffet spread. Staffs were efficient and friendly. Food was also refill promptly. And we chat till late. My friends and I enjoy the the ambienc.
Excellent Customer Service,"We are 8 person book from App(sad that app don't know how to rate), the tall western guy(looks like), customer service really excellents, keep to eyes contact and smilling with every customers. Food not bad, worth value."
Fresh seafood n Yummy BBQ,Was there on 12Jul for a gathering of 10paxs. Right place to be. Everyone is happily eating n chatting. Will be back!!
overall very good nice,nice Restaurant . for buffet . many food for me to choose and eat .for DBS card have 50 % off .during payment .
Restaurant with Two World standards,"We have come to a point in our life that we face the delimma of providing outstanding food or face the consequences of busting your food cost budget which I am sure many fnb managers do. It was my anniversary dinner not to say the least and I made a booking thru chope platform mentioning that it was an anniversary dinner. The manager in charge didnt notice it at all. Service staff James was nice and continue to engage the customers in friendly conversation. The food started great, snow crab, french mussels, fresh boiled prawns, fresh shuck oysters and sashimi. As we went along the way we notice something odd: the so call roast beef is overcooked and hard, the counter offered grilled vegi and in one container, sauteed short beans?There's no connection here to western food perhaps some grilled cauliflower should be better, the Chinese section was a total letdown, they offered a whole sea bass in oyster sauce. Perhaps a boneless fish should be safer when it comes to old folks and toddlers. Fried rice , rice used was fresh and not the overnight rice which is required for proper fried rice, the kway teow has no wok hei, chilli crab doesnt taste like chilli crab and it was not fresh, the stir fried mix vegi counter serves cheap vegis, when cooked tasted bland and most dishes does not have enough deco in it like chilli flowers, chive carrot flowers, etc. The mee rubus was nice or perhaps the sauce was ordered from outside, I dont know. It taste like the same ones I had in other hotels. The indian vegi food was a let down too: dhall used was wrong and too much cardomon, suppose to be a bit watery but this one like a dried up version, the palak paneer was address as bhatain bhatar which is totally different dishes. The Chinese Vegi dishes lack creativity. Even a zhi zar stall would have those items. All the chinese foods were amateurish, not a five star hotel standard. The saving grace was the dessert. The peanut butter, rasberry and tirimisu cake were gorgeous but strange to have a waffle counter next to a oyster counter. These two items dont mix in a buffet counter due to the high contamination rate of food. The wine was reasonable but not memorable. If they want repeated customers, cafe mosaic must buck up or ship out, thats my opinion."
Buffet lunch,There was a card promo at 50% off. Food selection was v.limited and taste was very very average. Dessert was also of limited selection. ... some tasteless. Very dissappointed and will not give this a try. Making it affordable is one thing but has to be value for $$$
"Excellent service, great food!",Great range of food including excellent seafood selection. Best service by waiters Kevin and James. Thanks Kevin - you are a star!
"1 for 1 Buffet Dinner at Caf√© Mosaic, Carlton Hotel",Had a Friday buffet dinner last week. Spread selection was good and food served hot. Lots of service staff and so clearing of plates and requests were prompt. Kuddos to the restaurant staff and managers!
Cafe Mosaic nice food and warm staff,Shout out to Mr Shan F&B Supervisor of Cafe Mosaic he is the most friendliest staff we have encountered for buffet lunch here in SG as most staff from diff hotels are not friendly these days. Good job guys! and the cakes are super yummy also he gave us complimentary slice of cake as my friend is celebrating her bday. coffee was nice. bread yummy. salmon super yummy! thank u carlton plus the one for one buffet if u pay via posb dbs is a plus!
Will be back for more/,"Had a wonderful celebration, Food quality and selection was good, Kids' were well taken care of as there are programs to entertain them."
Overall food above average but overpriced,"The live sections/ grill were great. Beef, lamb and pork were tender and nice. Cook food were super limited though and not really up to my liking. Good that there was oysters and sashimi for Saturday dinner but for 98++ per pax, it is way too overpriced. I went with 50% off and felt the price is more reasonable given the taste and variety of spread. Food and spread can be better improved. Overall still a good meal."
The dessert spread was so good!,We went for the lunch buffet and the spread was so good especially the desserts! So mouth watering till we kept eating and eating!
DISAPPOINTED,"Quite few food choice, and the dessert also let me disappointed. I think its not worth for buffet to having here."
Decent breakfast spread,We enjoyed the buffet breakfast here whilst staying in Singapore. The range is great with both Western and Asian options. The staff are very attentive and quick to offer assistance. The only negative is there is only machine coffee and not the option of barista coffee.
Food and Service,"Staff top up food very fast, so that we still can enjoy fresh food even there was a long queue. Waiters are very polite and efficient. Clear the used dish quickly to make our table tidy."
Excellent food choices at reasonable cost; friendly professional service,During our 5 days stay at Carlton Hotel we used Mosaic for daily breakfasts and some dinners. Food choices and quality were excellent and all staff we encountered were engaging and professional. Recommended.
Nice place for Sunday lunch,"Went for lunch with family after church on Sunday - enjoyed a pleasant meal together at Cafe Mosaic. Buffet food was good blend of local Asian favourites, eg. laksa, pork rib soup,and some cold fresh seafood and sushi. Spacious place, not too expensive, not crowded and with attentive, friendly staff. Ice-kachang for desert and good coffee too !"
GREAT SERVICE,wonderful service. used plate and cup were cleared promptly. Food was delicious especially the rack of Lamb/chop
buffet dinner,"another buffet worth checking out if you are in the city hall area. though the range is wide, the quality is not compromised."
Good selection of breakfast food even for the fussy eater.,"Our accommodation package came with daily breakfast at the Mosiac Cafe. There was good selection of breakfast food even for the fussy eater. Had the usual western styled hot foods, breads and pastries, including a counter where you could order your eggs cooked to your desire. Coffee, although dispensed from a machine, was surprisingly good. We were showed to our table by the maitre d', Peter, who without fail always got us a table for 8 without much fuss. There were fresh fruits but a bit disappointed there was no juice or smoothie bar."
Food and Service very good,Attended for two lunches. Staff were most attentive and the selection from the Menu was very expansive. Not expensive. Nice atmosphere.
Overall still acceptable,Food choice is very limited. No crab available and dishes did not top up after 9 plus close to 10 pm. The variety of buffet foods could be improve.
clean place and very good taste of meal,"we took our breakfast there which is very adequate choices for me. there is a very tasty muesli, yogurt with fresh fruit, fresh salad with honey mustard sauce which I like it very much. you may have as many cups of any kind of coffee as you want . the omelette station is also very efficient not long waiting even though they are busy. at least I have every thing that I need for my breakfast
Thank you Cafe Mosaic"

A Feast of Gastronomical Delights!,"I was privileged enough to visit Cafe Mosaic with my wife at The Carlton Hotel, for a buffet dinner 2 days ago. To state that my taste buds worked in perfect coherence as would a chorus band at a Mozart concert, from the very first bite of the salad concoction, is an understatement of gargantuan proportions. The buffet consisted of an astounding ensemble of international cuisine, from delectable fresh oysters, sashimi, and sushi, to toothsome meat varieties, rice, noodles, to action stations that served beef, chicken, and a scrumptious concoction of vegetables for those of you who are health-conscious, to a luscious array of desserts and fruits, and much more. The chefs have, without a doubt, outdone themselves. Hence, I raise my glass to them.

The overall ambience was soothing, with the right amount of lighting, and proper utilisation of space. The staff members were very well trained, and made us feel at home, even though it was quite a busy night for them. They were genial, amiable, and pleasant; this is extremely rare to find in many restaurants in Singapore. Furthermore, the fact that the restaurant was full, on a Thursday night no less, speaks volumes for its service and quality.

In conclusion, it was a Gastronomical delight of mammoth proportions, and as a person who relishes good food, and is a self-proclaimed food connoisseur, I can without the slightest sliver of hesitation, recommend Cafe Mosaic if you are in need to fulfil all your culinary desires."
Value for money,"Good value for one for one deal as there was oysters, prawns, scallops and sashimi. Quite a good spread with international and local items."
Christmas lunch,"What a lovely Christmas lunch we had here. For just over $100, there was a fantastic choice in the buffet. Extensive seafood section, roast turkey and ham (although the ham wasn‚Äôt off the bone), salads, meats, hot vegetables, sushi, Asian foods, fruit, breads and the desserts which were to die for. There was ice cream too, it we didn‚Äôt find this until we were leaving. Waiters were outstanding. Santa visited as did a choir singing some carols. Children were given ballloons in Christmas themed shapes. The ony criticism was that there was too much choice and my tummy wasn‚Äôt big enough to sample all the delicious offerings. A really lovely way to spend Christmas lunch."
Fresh Oyster,"We visited Cafe Mosaic last weekend for the dinner buffet. The oyster counter is behind the sashimi counter. We select the oysters and the chef will shucked them on the spot. This is different from other buffet.

The oyster is big and fresh. The rest of the buffets dishes are average."
The worst Christmas Buffet,"I am so shocked to look at some of the positive reviews in here about the buffet spread, etc. We went for the Christmas buffet and they had a 1 for 1 promotion for a certain credit card. Worth the money? NOT AT ALL!!! The only Christmas meal was the Turkey and Ham which the Turkeys tastes so BAD!!! One bite and spoilt my entire appetite.

Very normal buffet spread with food tasting so horrible. Sad that all of us had the same opinion and that its not worth returning to that place for any meals! To the chef, do you even try your food before they leave the kitchen? The only thing that is awesome is the freshness of oyster and sashimi. The rest was an absolute disappointment.

Please for your own sake, do something about the quality of your food. With all fairness, I was there in October and it was good back then. This week Christmas dinner was a disaster. A a happy occasion spoilt by really bad tasting food!

My colleagues stayed at the hotel and had breakfast included in the room. She took an apple and its rotten. Can you not check your fruits when you have them in your restaurant?

Service team is great and that made a difference to us all. Thank you only to the Service team. Kitchen guys, really disappointed."
Great value family-style hotel buffet,"We celebrated my mother-in-law's birthday here and enjoyed the 4 for 3 dining offer. The buffet had a great selection of sushi, sashimi, seafood, mains and live station (laksa and christmas turkey). We requested for a birthday dessert which the staff gladly prepared. Thank you so much!"
Blaming Game Manager,"Instead of acknowledging overlooked of billing, on-duty manager blame it on waiter Telling guest if we do not rectify, he will make the waiter pay for mistake"
Centrally located,"This busy cafe serves a dinner Buffet for S$88 per head. The varieties of dishes was an interesting spread: we did not wish to eat a large meal so went ala carte instead.
We ordered chicken satay which was delicious and served nice and hot. We also enjoyed their fish soup which was cooked with a generous ginger broth. The Mee Goreng was tasty and the chef was able to tone down the chilli content suitably."
Fantastic service,"Had a birthday celebration for our group of friends that had their birthdays in November.
Decided on this venue due to their 1 for 1 promotion.
Spread was good, ( although in my opinion the meat options could be increased )
Service was fantastic, servers were super attentive and cleared the plates each time it was emptied.. Two thumbs up.."
Good 1 for 1 deal,"Celebrated my moms birthday at the cafe. Food is value for money and seafood serves fresh. The venue is suitable for family and kids friendly. We enjoyed the ambience and spacious environment.There is cutlery for kids and free flow of drinks served Coffee, Tea and pre mixed."
Satisfied Customer,Dinner buffet has a wide variety of high quality foods to choose from. Great service from the staff and the place is clean and tidy.
"Good food, good service","Service was efficient - we were shown to our seats without having to wait; plates were cleared quick enough; etc. There is no reason for any complaint except perhaps for the 2 staff managing the noodle station. They could do with a smile or at least acknowledging our orders rather than performing like 2 robots without any facial expression or basic courtesy.The selection was impressive - freshly shucked oysters, a good selection of cold dishes, salads and seafood; love the biryani and mutton curry; fruits and cheese platter and of course desserts. I normally don't care so much for the cooked dishes so I can't really comment on those. Everything was good safe for the sushi which could have been better.Overall a very enjoyable dinner."
Excellent buffet dinner,"I went mainly for the seafood spread. The fresh big oysters are the steal of the night! juicy, big and really yum! The sashimi were very good too and the Alaskan crabs were just so sweet! The sambal grayfish or yubbies go very well with some bread that were served on the side.The cake selection was adequate and so beautifully done and they tasted yum, yum, yum:)Kudos to the chefs who did an excellent job:) And also the many attentive staff who serve at the tables:)"
Excellent Food Experience,Thank you for a great experience for a first-timer at Cafe Mosaic. The spread of food was fresh and enormous and customer-service superb. Well done! Maria Lee üòò
Better than expected,"It has been a year since I was here but needed a buffet on Sunday evening with oysters and Cafe Mosaic always has freshly shucked oysters. With 1 for 1 dinner deal, it is really a good deal. We turned up to a packed restaurant but there were more than enough staff to clear table and top up food. Water is self service and that is not a problem. Seafood selection variety include snow crabs, scallops and prawns. All fresh and non-salty. Oysters were very juicy from Canada. Cakes were delicious and sushi choices were good too. Prawn noodles store only serve yellow noodles so I did not try. Teriyaki chicken and soup were great. All in all it was a scrumptious meal. Unfortunately, no complimentary parking but if one takes public transport, it is of no issue. Nice place for buffet."
Wide variety of food,"My family and I liked the delicious range of food available. Our favourites were the fresh oysters, teochew steamed fish, stir fried vegetables, roast duck, black pepper crayfish, the lovely range of cakes, Thai milk tea ice cream. Our server, Daniel, was attentive and friendly. He gave us good tips on which dishes were good."
"Great Food, Great Ambience and A relaxing evening with friends","Choice of food variety was excellent! Be sure to go for their freshly-shucked oysters - simply awesome! For mee lovers, you may also opt for the mee-rubus - the gravy was simply rich and yet not too pungent. Also don't forget to try out their fried brussel sprouts - with the slightly burned taste, it was indeed cook to perfection! Great place to meet up with friends."
"Review of buffet at Carlton Hotel, Cafe Mosaic","Food is average, service is good. Price is reasonable. Should have more cook on the spot sections. Salmon sashimi is very disappointing. Laksa, taiwan porridge & Herb grilled salmon are fine."
Good variety and value for money,"Food taste, quality and variety is not bad for the price. Replenishment happens quite often. Service is good, used plates cleared quickly."
Had a very very enjoyable birthday celebration for my one-year-old,"I am surprised one can hardly find any (good) reviews on Cafe Mosaic‚Äôs lunch buffet over here. I was looking for a hotel cafe to hold a decent celebration for my one-year-old, and with a leap of faith, decided on Carlton Hotel‚Äôs Cafe Mosaic. Chose the place because of its central location and proximity to MRT station, making it convenient for my guests who may not necessarily drive.

The service I received from Michelle/Jasmine‚Äôs team has been nothing but exceptional. Queries over emails were always answered promptly within 24 hrs, and everything that has been discussed prior to event was well noted and executed.

My guests had a really enjoyable time.

They even gave me a complimentary and gorgeous 500g red velvet cake.

Kids under 6 eat for free and there are kids activities (balloon sculpting, origami and cupcake making) from 12-3 to keep the little ones occupied so that adults can enjoy the food and each others‚Äô company. How cool is that! (The kids were having their own private kiddy party in a corner.)

I catered extras for my guests: house wine ($49+++), freshly shucked oysters and salmon sashimi.

I have nothing but praises for the team. Keep up the good job!"
