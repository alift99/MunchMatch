Heart of Darkness,"Called by Heart of Darkness after a lunch nearby. The selection of beers is quite extensive and appears to change regularly. We chose to sit outside as the weather was not too hot. A good place for a chat with friends, a beer and to watch the world go by. Indoors is well air conditioned and at hotter time of year would take this option.
Did not try any of the food options but from what I saw it looked good!"
We decided to become regulars,"Great music, great beer and great staff. We really enjoy being there and are working on becoming regulars.
If you don't know what beer to order (as the selection is so huge), can always ask the staff for recommendations.
I'm already looking forward to my next visit."
Good gathering spot!,"Food was good, and a wide selection of beer, plus it was busy and servers were still attentive. Me and my group had a couple of beers each and they had a good selection of ipas there. Ordered some wings and the day was perfect."
Great beers,"I visited the Ho Chi Mingh brewery in 2019 and loved there beers. I noticed they had a Singapore location, so now I'm in Singapore and decided to try it out.

They have like 25 beers on tap so there is a wide range of different varieties of beer available as well as some guest taps for other breweries.

The beer was great. Service was good.
Also had dinner, ordered pork ribs and some onion rings which were pretty good.

Overall will definitely be back, when ever in Singapore or Ho Chi Mingh."
Amazing Craft beer restaurant in Singapore,"Had an amazing experience in Heart of Darkness. Service was spectacular, felt really welcome and taken care of. They also had a huge selection of craft beers. Food was also worth trying. Will definitely visit again!"
Happy experience @ Heart of Darkness,"Visited here multiple times. A wide array of beers, from lagers to IPAs to Stouts. Beers are uniquely curated by Heart of Darkness. Beers are given fresh and cold! Bartenders (Edmond and Chirag) are very friendly, and attentive, and recommend you beers according to your taste bud. Food is also good, especially recommend the Crispy prawns, prawns are big and juicy! Nachos are good too. Definitely worth a visit, especially for the huge selection of beers! :)"
Awesome,"Nice ambience, nice food too! But music can be softer so customers can talk to each other without shouting. Price wise a bit steep. But overall ok!"
Great place but different vibes,Great selection of beers as always but the vibes of the place is no longer the same. Always nice for a drink though.
"Overpriced, reasonable quality","Food beer ok, price ridiculous compared to peers, setting ok. Malthouse wins for me on variety and value."
Amazing!,Good food and selection of beer! Tasty tacos and good service. Definitely recommend and is my go to bar.
"Nice, cozy ambience for a get-together","Great ambience for a relaxed get-together .. great range of craft beer. Bit on pricey side for food and drinks, but good quality."
Best bar in SG,"Edmond is a very helpful and best staff I ever encounter, lovely guy and fun to be with. Bars drinks and food is the best I ever had in Singapore."
NUT BHAD,Food was good but the customers are noisyyyyy as expected of a restaurant bar. Really amazing beers for even a non beer drinker
ASIA‚ÄôS BEST BEER & MY FAVOURITE RESTAURANT,"YES I‚Äôve reviewed this place MANY times because it KEEPS delivering!!! AWESOME FOOD, BEER AND SERVICE. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. If you haven‚Äôt tried the Heart of Darkness hospitality you are missing out‚Ä¶"
Best bar in Singapore!,One of the best craft beer bars in Singapore. Wonderful service by all the crews at the bar! Would definitely come back again.
best craft beer,"super good service with wonderful range of craft beers. Edmond is super friendly and welcoming. highly recommended to come over this bar for their food service, food and drinks!"
The ideal place to chill out,"Located at the start of Keong Saik Road, this brewery with a wide variety of beers brewed and imported from Saigon is the best place to relax with friends or to de-stress after a long day's work with a beer or two. Just ask the ever-friendly staff for recommendations and they'll get you started"
Awesome experience,Food was good. Service was prompt. Beers were also delicious as well. Love the vibes and ambience. Will definitely be back.
Vietnam & Roll!,I‚Äôve visited HoD in SG many times as well as the one in HCMC and I‚Äôm always pleased with their grasp of hospitality and the variety of craft beers on tap. The ambiance is also very cozy and playlists are well curated to make you feel welcomed!
Good food and great service,I love Caroline and her awesome service. Great drinks and great food! The fusion of Vietnamese and western food is definitely worth the try.
Great service and great food,Caroline is so amazing! Great service and super friendly. Good introduction by her if you need for the beers. All the food are amazing. Only the music is a tad loud.
An ok place to dine in,"The pizza dough is thin and biscuity not my kind of pizza but ok. Ate the meat lovers, toppings is ok, a bit on the sweet side. (I believe the dough is the pre made type) . Fried wings are so so. Nachos are ok.
The dumplings are good, the beef one is pan fried, the chicken one is steamed. Think it is better to try the Vietnamese dishes. (Its a Vietnamese company)

The taps, tried the kumquat do not taste the kumquat, cucumber pilsner is better, the American IPA is ok, but nothing special. The flight sample is no longer available, but they could do it if you asked, but it would be SGD $10 per glass.

The service is pretty good."
Fliendly place,This place is a nice one if you really want to enjoy a nice beer and very good food! thanks to the owner eddy and his team see you soon again Cheers
Friendly staff & good beers!,"Celebrated birthday here & had a blast! served by Suven & Edmond, friendly & knowledgeable staffs! Excellent beers & food! Would definitely be back :)"
DRINKS!,"Super pleasant visit! Came here for a birthday drink with my friend, thankful for the great service by Suven and Edmond, would definitely come back again!!"
Definitely a must go,Thoroughly enjoyed my time with the wide and delicious selection of beer there. Was well taken care of by Suve and thanks to General manager
Great Atmos as usual,And i was not referring to Dolby. Looking forward to another new beer to try in the next visit. Great service as well.
Best beer with even better service!,"Went to Heart of Darkness for my friend's birthday celebration. Suben and Edmund were both very hospitable and always attentive to our needs. There are a wide range of beer for you to choose from. If you are unsure about what you like, go for a small glass and sample them as you go."
Too much fun !! üòÅ,"In the bar now, having a great time, the bar is buzzing, great ! Wide selection of beers, great staff. Food is very tasty, if you get round to Noor making cocktails you'll be blown away, either way you're in for a good night !"
Great craft beer. Excellent food quality. Excellent service.,"Went to try out this craft beer bar near the office. Was pleasantly surprised by the vast craft beer choices and options, but was capably served by Edmond. He recommended great beers and gave us great service throughout the night. Would definitely return again to try their pizza. Can't speak enough for the quality of their food and kitchen. Food was fresh and delectable! Definitely a must visit!"
My Fav Bar in Singapore,"Ive been around to many different bars, but the best the one closest to my office which is Heart of Darkness. I'm here every other week. Love the fish tacos and the Poutine othe Menu, Amazing beer selection. Czech Bia is my fav. The staff there are amazing. Outside tables or inside all good."
"Place is nice, with good vibe, good service and nice selection of beers but food is not good.","The experience was nice because the place is cool and the service was good, I mean, there were only 3 staff persons but they were really trying to do their best to please everyone so I really appreciated that but to be honest, food was not good, it was not terrible but it is not a place you go for the food."
"Great beer, even awesome service","Went there a couple of weeks back. It was my first time in the Singapore branch. I've been to the Ho Chi Minh branch many times.

The beer selection and quality is good as always. Also asides from beer from their brewery, HoD brings in beers from other breweries as well.

Most importantly, the service here is very warm and friendly. Suven, Edmond and Jai are very prompt in their service, made great recommendations and making sure everything was great for us :)"
ALL ROUND AMAZING,"Got pizza (yes!!! they've got pizzas) delivered to us from the darling team at Heart Of Darkness, even when dine ins are prevented, it doesnt stop this bunch from providing stellar service.

They've recently added some pizza's to their menu, they taste just as good as they look. My favourite was the Pepperoni and Cheese!!

100% will recommend for dine ins & takeaway!"
Great beer. Ok food.,"Beers are fresh and delicious‚Ä¶ huge selection too. Staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Ambiance is dark and grungey‚Ä¶ in a good way. The only downside was the food. Greasy and testeless. However, the pork belly was fantastic. Would go again for the beer and pork belly only."
Good good and vibe,"Good vibe, great food. Also heart of darkness have a great initiative to save f&b sg, check out their insta and fb"
"Excellent customer service, great variety of food, wonderful beer!","I came here a few times, and after a long hiatus due to Covid, I came again with one of the waiters remembering my choice of beer and gin. Unbelievable! Thus I decided to drop this review.=)

There are always a great choice of food as well from Asian, Mexican, Western, will never get bored as to what to go with your drinks. ( Guess I don't have to mention the beers? They are well known for their craft beers.)

Great work and thank you to all staff at HOD!"
Mega!,"I love this bar... the people, the ambience, the food, the beer! Right from entry, you are greeted warmly (usually by Eddy, and with an enormous grin) and treated like part of a club... it really is heartwarming and sets the tone right to take a perch at the bar and gaze at the array of phenomenal beers on tap. Cannot go wrong here... If you need some help though, the amiable and insightful bar tenders will guide you on your taste profile and will often give you a sample if you want to try something out of your comfort zone.

If you are hungry - get yer laughing gear around some of the top scran on offer too - it‚Äôs got it all!

I‚Äôve come here for many differing occasions, and all ended well be it business meetings, dates with women well out of my league, or just come on my own to experience what is in my mind one of the most welcoming bars in town - it‚Äôs always a great pleasure, and one always walks away well fed and watered with new friends.

Give it a whirl; you will NOT be disappointed.

Check out their stash too - pukka nice Tshirts and get some bottled beers for home."
Awesome beers and food,"I was overwhelmed with the choices of beers on tap. Honestly recommended to try the flight (tasting beers platter) for those who never try their beer. Staff was helpful in recommending the selections of beers. On the other hand, food was also delicious with a huge range of tapas food and also main courses . Good for dinner as well.. the plus point for me was the recommended Kurt‚Äôs Insane beer and with their decent rendang wagyu burger which was cook to perfection .Not forgetting the miso edamame which was awesome..
Can‚Äôt wait to come back again and try their upcoming menu, which the staff told me , they will have a fresh handmade pizza with Asian twist .."
All round AMAZING!!!,"Wow! It's hard finding a bar with great drinks, food and service all together! Top of my list to visit in town!"
Amazing place to lepaks,"Awesome place to chill after work... Great vibes with amazing staffs... Kudos to Eddy, Edmond, Suven and all the team..."
Great Service!,"Food and service are great. Staff is very friendly. Remember to make reservation first, packed even on weekdays. Good job!"
FAV BEER BAR!,"Love the vibe over here. Great staff, amazing food (the rendang burger is a must try) big variety on beer taps,bottles and cans. defenitely a go to spot to chill and hang"
"Awesome hospitality, great food, and the best craft beer in town","This is, hands down, the best craft beer place in town. I‚Äôve been a long term follower of Heart of Darkness Saigon, Vietnam, it‚Äôs home turf. HoD‚Äôs Singapore outlet does not disappoint! Give the food a shot, too, to go along with the brews. It‚Äôs interesting and unique, with a Vietnamese twist. The staff is super friendly, accommodating, and knows it‚Äôs beers. Ask for a recommendation, based on your taste. And make sure to say hello to Eddy the fully tattooed, slightly intimidating at first, but super warm-hearted manager!! You‚Äôll quickly be part of the HoD family!"
A Hidden Gem,"I visited Heart of Darkness a week ago before booking through chope. The reason I returned it was truly a hidden gem in atmosphere and decor with over 20 taps to choose from, to top it off their staffs are really friendly in making sure you are taken care of although they are busy. I'm gonna give 4 just so they can go challenge themselves to go further"
üëçüèªüí™üèªüíöheart is full üíÄLove this place üòã,"This is the best beer place in Singapore ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êmy second time here to support Suven. He is very dedicated in his job and knowledgeable about his beer. He recommended me a very good Vietnamese beer at my first visit. Absolutely memorable sour plum beer. Back here for the second time with friends and I was curious to check out their hand-cut fries fresh from oven. Chef Jai was very sweet and kind in telling me the steps in making the fries. They pair so well for my afternoon beer.

I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys some characters and awesome cool selection of beer.

Thank you for being so wonderful!"
Great experience at the Heart of Darkness!,"Service was great, beer was amazing, what more can you ask for? The team (Suven, Michelle and Faiz) was really welcoming and attentive, making it such a really great time! Great selection of beer with guest tap menus that are changed every Thursday, definitely worth a visit!"
Great family outing,"We made a reservation on a lark after seeing the bar pop up on a reservation app. It did not disappoint, we had the bone marrow, fish tacos, pardron peppers, a cocktail and a fruit larger. The staff were extremely helpful and attentive to the needs of our kids aged 4 and 6. Highly recommended, shout out to the service by Suven, Wdmond and Faez"
warm welcome to Keong Saik,"Great beers, nice wines, awesome cocktails, great crew. Nachos are also dope. Perfect for any time of the day! What else?"
Awesome crew!,"Suven, Edmund, Faiz, excellent service and engagement with us. Sharing about the various selections in an engaging manner and entertaining jokes. Will come again!"
Place is nice. Beer good.,Place is nice. Beer good. Suven and Michelle are awesome! I have a good time here. Will come back soon!
Best beer and servers in town,"Had the best beers in town at Heart Of Darkness. Ask for Juan, tell him Tim sent ya. He‚Äôs the best. Get the Mistress IPA."
"Unique venue, great night!","Always fun vibe here! amazing beer selections, quality dishes, great service. Impressed every time I've been"
Brilliant atmosphere,"Beautifully decorated place, nicely spaced out. Food is great too, serving several types of Vietnamese foods. Serving portions were surprisingly huge even for sides. Great to see some local taps in here as well."
Great beer and great service,"Came in on a busy saturday evening without reservations. They kindly accommodated to our request to move to a more comfortable spot once it became available. We had an enjoyable dinner and this was made possible by Suven. Despite the crowd and our spot in the far corner, he attended to us and check back frequently. Good selection of food and beer. Will definitely be back."
Come for the beer- but stay for the food.,"The beer is extremely high quality- great tasting and a wide variety. Always a wide selection to fit any taste. Its so much fun trying different types of beer. Just be careful though some are pretty strong! The surprising thing is the food! The octopus croquette, fish tacos- my wife is hard to please but she loved it. Full disclosure I'm also a fan of the bar in Vietnam. But Singapore is just as good! Service of course is fantastic!"
"Great, attentive service on a weekend evening","Walked in for a table for 2 on a Saturday evening, our request to move to a more comfortable seat once available was nicely and promptly met with no complaints. Suven was attentive to us even though we were far at a corner outside, never left us waiting and always checked in with us. Really great experience, really great beers. Definitely gonna return."
Amazing place to visit,"Best craft beer in SG, & made even better by Paolo üòú had a great time with my friends & can‚Äôt wait to be back!"
I‚Äôm sold!,"Love the ambience and theme of the place. Food was delicious and they have a great selection of craft beers!

Thanks to Suven and Faiz for the great service and being very welcoming, attentive and giving great recommendations of their menu and beers.

Would definitely come back again!"
Heart of darkness experience,The service staff Suven is excellent. Chef Jai is awesome. Craft beers here are crazy. Don‚Äôt miss. When you come to Singapore. Must visit. Food n beer are really awesome n the service staff are very polite n helpful.
amazing service,"It was my first visit there greeted by edmond,faiz and juno who where super accomodting. They were keen to know about my preferences about beer and their suggestions were on point. I left heart of darkness feeling light and refreshed. I will definitely patronis this bar again."

Best Beer,"Excellent service from Edmond, Michelle , Paulo and crew. Best beer and food in town. Love the vibes!"
Service is top notch with,"Service is top notch with great selection of craft beer. Service staff Michelle very sexy and cute, Edmond very attentive."
Best craft beer in singapore!,Best craft beer in singapore! Tons of great craft beer and food and wonderful service. Service staff michelle was super friendly and prettyüòâ
Awesomer than one would thought,"Met up with an old friend stating that she needed beer that day.
Was spoilt with choices, and we just leave it to Faiz (if i spell correctly) to make the flights.
Totally spoilt us silly with the awesome choices & flavours.
Would return there for the sake of just the service, and the beer would be the best bonus,"
Great beers,What more can be said of one of Vietnam premier breweries? Great beers. The hostess Michelle also very cute.
Awesome place to hangout,Team Heart of the darkness is awesome and food is good and drinks are so many option. I came with my friends and tacos is the best and beer is good
"Beer average, not impressed","Beer - ordered a paddle of 4 small beers - Mellow, KumQuat, Fume Purpose, Dream Alone. Maybe should try out their IPA. Pale ale average only.

Food. - not bad but expensive. Came for Vietnamese Scallops but no longer serve.

Service - one of waiter pulled mask while talking which made us uncomfortable , as he talking facing the food and drink"
Best craft beer ever!,So happy to see HOD opened since 2018 and this new location has good vibes and awesome fun team! The ambiance and good vibes make this a weekly visit to come back to the venue.
Highly recommended,Suvan and Paulo are very friendly and nice service. A lot of options of tasty bract beer with fast service.
St. Patrick's Day 2021,"Lovely service, the staff were very attentive to our needs and the food was to die for. Loved their wings and the tacos and edamame. Nice variety of beer available. Husband and I enjoyed our time here."
Great vibe and service,"Agree with other reviews, it‚Äôs beer lovers heaven, but gotta highlight also food, vibe and particularly the great service - Real pleasure!"
People with Heart!,"So I went on 8 March with my gfs which was International Women‚Äôs Day and received a super lovely surprise from the team. The pic says it all! We also received free pink gin martini cocktails this night which were yummy. Besides the exceptional service, this is my fave place for craft beers which they are known for. I was pleasantly surprised there‚Äôs quite a few vegetarian options ( we tried the nachos and fries which were both yum) as well as non alcoholic spirits that looked interesting. I would definitely come and check out their food and cocktails menu the next time with my friends ! Wonderful job Eddie & team!"
Great atmosphere with great choice of beers,"Since they have moved from Tras Street to Keong Saik, I feel that the place has gotten much better in terms of vibe, presentation and staff efficiency. A good place to start the evening with huge choice of beers. Food is also good."
"Great Atmosphere, Beer and food","Was my second visit, the atmosphere is a cross between a British Pub and an American Bar with an Asian twist, the food was great especially the tacos and wings and the variety of beers will keep me coming back, to be honest if you are visiting and want a great place to catch up with friends this is the perfect place."
STILL SINGAPORE'S BEST,AMAZING BEER - TICK!!! AMAZING FOOD - TICK!!. WORLD-CLASS SERVICE - TICK!!! Honestly can't fault this place. It is my GO TO bar in Singapore and the new location continues to get better. What else can I say - go here now!!!
"Great Food, good vibe & good service","Group of 4, ordered the Fish Taco, meat platter with Fries, all tasted great, Staff recommended craft beer to go with the food. All in all, wonderful experience, will definitely make a few more trips here. Highly recommend it !"
Memorable sunday,"Love the food. My favourite is the char siew ribs ,it's tasty, very tender and juicy, impressive! Excellent service, happy, helpful and friendly staff. I will come back again and for sure recommend Heart of Darkness to everyone."
Horrible,"The food at this restaurant is the worst I have had in Singapore. The fish tacos tasted like detergent. The 4 people I was there with screwed up their face at each dish we had from the hummus to the wings. Nothing tasted like it was advertised, wings that tasted of chilli not chicken fir instance. Can‚Äôt believe this place is even open in Singapore. Avoid it at all costs if u are hungry. The service is fine, the only positive."
Best craft beers in Singapore,"Amazing craft beers, personal favorite is the Loose Rivet New England and to pair this off with a range of great tasting & interesting menu! You could also give the cocktails a go - they are a great starter to enjoy casual gastro experience!"
Good vibes and excellent beers,"One of the best beer selections in Singapore brought to you by a fun and welcoming team! My understanding is that the beer listing changes regularly with a selection of craft beers from Heart of Darkness and ""guest beers"" from other craft brewers from around the world."
Awesome Food and Service,Very nice beer place. Food was awesome and services from the floor staff were amazing. We will visit again for the beer.
Great selection of beer and cocktails. Nice crowd mix of locals and expats. Upscale Western bar fare with a twist!,We went on a Friday night for an after work drink. Sat at the bar and had a great time. Incredibly busy bartenders still made time to offer suggestions and explain finer details of the various cocktails being crafted. Loved the knowledgeable staff-suggested pairings and the eclectic mix of music. Only recommended improvement would be addition of sound deadening material to ceiling as was done at last location. It is definitely too loud on a Friday to host any work meetings.
Cool bar on Keong Saik!,"I didn‚Äôt expect such a cool bar on Keong Saik! The staff were amazing, the food was delicious and the ambience is awesome. Even though it‚Äôs more of a pub, the cocktails are pretty good too! Will come back Ed!"
Refreshing Gin!,"The service crew there were all very friendly and helpful, they were very fast in responding. The food there tasted great, tried the butter edamame, the octopus croquette. I also tried the Gin recommended by the crew there, it was awesome, very refreshing and smooth!

Keep up the great work Heart of Darkness!"
"Good vibes, awesome staff","This has quickly become one of my favorite bars to go to. There‚Äôs a wide selection of beer to choose from, and good food. There‚Äôs always good music playing, but best of all the staff is awesome...which goes a long way!"
Amazing service!,"You need to try this place. You will come for the beer and you will come back for the food, cocktails and super efficient and nice service!! A must in Singapore"
"Good beer, good vibes","No brainer it has good beer, but i was impressed by the food. We had the fish tacos, which were amazing, along with the sausage platter. The middle sausage was the best, but we didn't know what it was.
the service was fast and proper too.
i only have 1 qualm, the food portions could be better though.
all in all, will definitely be back."
Great time,"First time with my wife there, great cocktails, atmosphere and food, lovely staff, cool musics. Will come back with friends"
Change your name,"Bar area was too dark. Couldn't read the menu until we put the menu under the lights or with a phone torch. Other than that, Heart of Dankness."
Super Tasty Yummy Food and Nice Setting!,"Celebrated my birthday last night! Had such a wonderful joyful experience with such good yummy food and especially tip-top beer that made your taste-bud non-stop drinking and eating.

To add-on, service was tip-top and on the ball with very courteous and delightful service staff.

Worth patronising definitely!"
10/10 for everything!,"First off, service is great‚Äî staff's nice and friendly. The food really blew me away, I don't fancy tacos much but I loved theirs and of course, the beer! I love their selection and if you ever get too spoilt for choice, just look for Jonodon: his recommendations never failed me and really understands what we're looking for.

I'd also like to add on that they have t-shirts with amazing designs based on their drinks."
Beers here are amazing,Shoutout to Jonodon for his hospitality and recommendations on beer. The selection of beers available may seem overwhelming but have a chat with him and he‚Äôll definitely get you sorted in no time.
Best service ever,"Best service ever, awesome atmosphere -staff are friendly as ever. Will come back every chance... the craft beer is unique, tasty and you can‚Äôt get beer this good anywhere.

Shoutout to Niden for being awesome!"
Solid service and drinks. No regrets coming down,"Solid ambience. Damm good drinks. Best service. Top 3 bars in Singapore! Always a good experience coming down here. Good for friends and family. Guaranteed more than once in a life time to come here. Awesome, amazing and all time great. Would come here a thousand times more. Shout out to the stuff and Niden!"
Best service ever,Niden was really helpful and friendly and the beers were amazing. Love the industrial vibe with the grungy brick walls and low lighting.
Casual and perfect ambience,"A variety of delectable craft beers available. To be honest, it doesnt get better than this. Niden was especially attentive, and the customer service was impeccable. It might be my bias, but it has been flawless everytime i visit."
