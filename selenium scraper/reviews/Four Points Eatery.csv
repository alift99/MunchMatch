Visit this place for a refreshing feel and good experience.,"You will like the experience.

I was with a group of 13 for CNY lunch at the restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by the clean and neat environment, good food and staff that consistently attended to us. I must re-visit. Of course, the standard of service is not to be compared with top brand name hotels. But definitely, nothing short of feeling good and satisfied after the meal. If you seat near the glass wall, you may even like the river views outside."
NUS Corporate Workshop Dinner,"Thank you Mr Daniel Yuen, Mr Mohan, Margarita and Team at Four Points Eatery for the wonderful service we had this evening for our 40 over guests. Food is great and everyone enjoyed thoroughly. Special thanks to Mr Alexander Goh and Mr Daniel Chua too for the impeccable care and attention given to the CIL-ANCORS group. I am truly appreciative and grateful!"

Amazing service and experience,"I am currently staying at the four points by Sheraton riverview. Its been an amazing experience and the hospitality extended by everyone right from the check in staff, the restaurant staff, concierge is exemplary. A special mention of Mr. Mohan from the restaurant who goes out of his way to make the guests feel at home and ensures that the best service is rendered. Great hotel, great staff !"
The Eatery by Four Points,"It is a fairly good restaurant. The only drawback for me, was they almost didn‚Äôt change their food offerings while we were there for 14 days. But generally a good restaurant."
Delayed stay over,I was stayed here for just a few hours after flight delays. The room was spotless. The restaurant had great food and friendly staff who were very accommodating after the buffet had long finished.
Another great stay in Singapore,"My fourth stay here. Great property, friendly staff, delightful service..
Particularly enjoy the breakfast buffet, the outdoor seating with a view of the river. Mr Ganapathy and the team do a great job in checking up on guests and make sure that you are well taken care off."
Mookata + Four Points at Sheraton Hotel Stay Promo,"Promo mentioned a night‚Äôs stay with complimentary Mookata platter with Thai milk tea. Didn‚Äôt expect much since it is complimentary but when the platter came, our jaws dropped. It was HUGE and even came with oysters and 2 king prawns. The staff and service was top notch as well. They really outdid themselves. We‚Äôll be coming again for sure!!"

Excellent service!,"Every staff we have interacted with were efficient, helpful and friendly. They anticipate what their guests need and offer assistance. Even when they are busy we never have to follow up on any requests, which is usually the case at restaurants!"
Eatery,"Seri from the restaurant team at Four Points Eatery is amazing! We are foreigners staying in Singapore for quite a long time, and she has given us outstanding service everyday. We usually have special requests for our food and she always makes sure we get our food exactly the way we requested. Seri goes above and beyond to make her customers happy and most importantly she always has a smile on her face. I recommend Seri and the restaurant team here 100%."
Dinner,Thank you Seri for a nice birthday cake on my Birth month. Good service provider. Experience & Knowledgeable in service.
Birthday month,Special thanks to Seri for her exceptional service during my visits to four points. She was very helpful and attentive. Even going out of her way to
The BEST breakfast buffet service!,"We always look forward to staying in any asian hotels. Four Points Sheraton in Riverview, Singapore did not disappoint. Customer service is EXCELLENT. From the time of check in and in the dining room. Sathia and the rest of the staff are friendly and efficient and serves the best buffet breakfast in town."
Late lunch at Four Points,Great food. Always back for the mee goreng and char kway teow with generous portions of seafood. Nice ambience with a good view of the Singapore River.
Big and spacious restaurant with wide variety of food choice!!!,"Staff Kit was very friendly, efficient and helpful, answered all my queries fast and accurate. Love to have such staff around."
Four Points Eatery,"Good place to eate especially if you're on a business trip. Food served quick, delicious, and extremely friendly staff. Would definitely eat here again."
PSA: Check price before ordering,"We went to Four Points Eatery for ùêÄùê° ùêèùêÆùê¢ ùêôùê¢ ùêÇùê°ùêöùê´ ùêÅùêÆùêüùêüùêûùê≠, last advertised on Facebook as S$49 nett (in March 2022). It's actually now S$58++, and I wished the staff could have informed us when we decided to order this."
"Think 5 star Mookata, hawker price!","My friends and I are simply blown away during yesterday's dinner at Eatery. We were served by a bubbly supervisor, a dynamic and bubbly few days old junior staff and a first day joiner! So sorry that we were busy eating and didn't ask for your names!

Supervisor (gentlemen in glasses):
‚Ä¢ Dynamic and friendly
‚Ä¢ Robust and helpful

Few days senior girl:
‚Ä¢ She was an uproar!
‚Ä¢ Lively and had a great sense of humour
‚Ä¢ Great potential with customer handling

First day new joiner chap:
‚Ä¢ Humble and hardworking
‚Ä¢ Efficient and meticulous

The entire team made our dining experience ever so enjoyable. Come on lets face it. The team did an amazing job and especially considering how ""experience"" they are. This is a classic example of service from the heart. The product changes all the time. But when you are genuine and sincere in what you do, it doesnt matter if you're in the job 1 day or even 10 years. The difference is obvious!"
High quality service,"Food is real good, but the high point is the service. Mohan and Hana do a really great job, they are very attentive, polite and do everything to make you have a pleasant meal. Really enjoyed my time there."
Excelent service,Thank you all the team. The ambience and hospitality was extremely good. It is a really pleasure to meet you during the breakfast. Special thank to Mr Mohan for your help during my long week ...... Arnaud
So damn suckÔºÅ,"Really terrible
88 for 1 pax
but it was a nightmare
I think the Maximum value just 18 for one person"
Overcooked Rock Lobster,"For a hotel, one would have thought Chef could control degree of cooking. Top overcooked. Spoiled the highlight of this signature dish"
Delightful Zi Char buffet,"The dishes were served hot and fresh, we enjoyed our ala carte buffet and most likely to come back again. The curry fish head was a hit among us, it has good amount of spices and meat to it. It was definitely value for $$ as I gotten the Chope‚Äôs bday deal $28 per pax. Side note; their drinks are overpriced! So do check before ordering $7++ for cola"
Depressing atmosphere and teribble food,The food was served very slow although there were only few customers. This is one of the worst Zir Char I have been eaten. Some of the food is cold when serving to us. The sambal vege is spicy. NOt recommended.
Standard drop,"Compared to previous times, the items on the menu has become lesser. They don't even have fresh juices which is quite disappointing. Some of the staff are friendly.

Saw their ala carte buffet zi char - not worth it. Around $50+ per pax, minimum 2 pax and those dishes like curry fish head, herbal prawn can only order 1 serving. The other cheaper one like eggs and vegetables are unlimited. Not worth in my opinion. I saw that they have mookata as well."
Rock Lobster laksa,Everything on the menu is rather overpriced( it is housed within a hotel afterall) . But the rock lobster laksa is rather worth its price of sgd23. Came in 3 halves . Large amount of thick rice vermicelli. Not too oily. Good tasting sambal chilli at the side
Feedback For The Service,This is my 5th visits Staycation at Four Point By Sheraton.I have dine at the Eatery Restaurant.My favourite dish is Laksa.The Staff by the name Mr Farid is very Pleasant to serve us.He is very Good and attentive for the order foods.He serve us with a pleasant smile and we are very happy the Service.His teamates Mr Mohan also very please to served us.We are very happy with the foods and enviroments.I will strongly recommend to give a credit to noth of them.
Bad food and service,"Asked for vegetarian noodles and all I get is tough noodles with black sauce. Barely anything in it. They could put some vegetables. Service is very very slow, unbelievably poor. The coffee already turned cold the food never came. We followed up with 3 crews but still no food. We found out later on that they seemed to mix up the orders. Please avoid eating here."
During my staycation here,"During my staycation here, ate dinner and breakfast at this restaurant. The food is average, and not what I expected for a hotel restaurant standard.
Perhaps the western selections would have tasted better.
Honestly, believe the nearby Tiong Bahru Food Centre would have better food selections and tasted much better.
Felt really disappointed, as I did not feel that it was value-for-money at all."
"Great Staff, Great Service",Had our dinner here today. The food was above average but the whole experience were made great because of Mr Mohan! He was attentive to our needs and always tries his best to delight us :)
Service very terrible,"Worst place I have been so far ... no cutlery no water no service despite being seated for 30 mins .. no body bother to come to u for service .. mookata came and no cutlery, no soup, no chilli, no butter .. it‚Äôs a horrible experience."
Disappointing 1st visit - far cry from the Chope ads!,"Purchased a Chope deal during Chope Birthday 2020 campaign for a 1 for 1 Seafood Madness Set at Four Points Eatery.

1 for 1 Seafood Madness SET at $44.73 nett.
Indulge in ‚Äúluxurious seafood‚Äù:
Fresh prawns
Mussels
Flower clams
SNOW CRAB CLAWS
Corn or live CRAB

We were informed by the waitress when we asked abt the missing crab that chef ran out of crab and he had replaced it with snow crab but this is what we were served!
Does it look equivalent to the crab as described in the deal? Or anywhere near to what‚Äôs being featured in the Chope ads?
We were offered juices and plain rice by the apologetic waitress as a service recovery.

Four Points Eatery should not be branded as a Marriott as they clearly can‚Äôt live up to the Marriott brand standard.

And I were never step foot into Four Point Eatery ever."
Food was mediocre but service was superb,"Went there to try the lobster laksa which unfortunately wasn't available that day, so I got the seafood aglio olio instead. Didn't wait too long for the food to be served. However I found the pasta to not be spicy enough for me and feedback to the staff to check with the chef if the chilli was added in. Kitchen refired and served the pasta quickly. The food was not the best I've had but the service made it worthwhile to return again. Service was superb from when I step foot into the restaurant till when I left. Might possibly be due to the lack of crowd when I'm there as I was there at about 6pm before the dinner crowd comes in."
Wait and wait,"Seat and Waited for 45 min to get the first dish. Waited for another 30 minutes for the next round. I dun quite understand, the dishes are in small portion, not freshly cooked and microwaved, why do we have to wait for so long? How do I know they are microwave? The small porcelain bowls are hot but the food in the bowl is warmed. We spent 2 plus hours and did not manage to finish the second round."
Worse experience ever,"I arrived at the eatery around 8pm for dinner. The service was very slow even though the restaurant was empty with only a few customer. When I finally got a table, to my horror most of the items on the menu were not available and it was only 8pm. Almost half of the menu were not available to order. The excuse the staff gave was that there was a crowd before but the eatery only closes at 10pm, there shouldn‚Äôt be a problem making the menu available. When questioned, staff was unable to answer my queries. Shouldn‚Äôt they anticipate for dinner crowd as well? When my order finally went through, it took 1 hour to come. This is the worse experience I have. I DO NOT recommend eatery by Fourpoints Sheraton"
Worst place to visit,"My first time here with family for bday dinner celebration ""ala cart zi char buffet"" but we had the worse experience ever. 7pm was our reservation but we were rejected from going in due to too many customers from either walk in/ too many reservations at one go.
We waited till 730pm thn we can get in and already seen many angry customers as well. Complaining of waiting time too long, food was too long as well. Waited for 1hr 10mins for the food.
Service was alright but i guess kitchen side must have short of manpower or so.
Worst experience ever."
"Good service, terrible food","Service staff were polite. Had the seafood madness set. Crab was very far from fresh, could hardly eat it. Prawns were seared till they were dry. Not worth even after the chope deal"
Food and service could be better,"Food was below average, service by the staff was poor and slow. One of the staff gave attitude and was not service oriented."
Good service but average food,"Visited on a weekday lunch. Ordered the 1-for-1 seafreast madness set at around 12:35pm but the food only came half an hour later, which was surprising considering the restaurant was quite quiet. No complain on the waitress as she had informed us that it would take a while. Taste of the food is still ok, though the white wine sauce is on the saity side. The crab meat is a bit tough in my opinion, not sure if they are overcook or not really fresh. Initially, read from other reviews they the serving was so big that they need to takeaway the leftovers. However, not in my case, as we don't feel full, and still need to get something to eat at Chinatown Point less than 2 hours later after we left the restaurant. Overall, I think the food is average, but the staff service can be considered quite good."
Worst seafood platter ever,The price you pay over Chope is not worth the money. This is because the portion is small and seafood simply NOT FRESH!
Breakfast while on Staycation!,"Staff were very cheerful and hospitable despite being busy, as it was a buffet spread through an order form (to reduce risk of any infection spread). Food was prepared relatively quickly and served, and you can order more along the way. View is great too as it‚Äôs along the river, an overall great experience! :) thank you!"
Attention Given...Perfect,"The restaurant on the first floor diagonal to the hotel lobby is spacious with tables kept apart for safe distancing. The QR code of the digital menu placed on each table makes ordering so convenient. From the menu, I noticed the restaurant also offers itself as a co-working space, for an affordable price. Way to go, Four Points!

The menu, with a mix of Western and Asian dishes, has something for everyone. For dinner, I decided on the Hainanese Chicken Baquette. The bread was soft and the chicken pieces delightfully tasty. The fries accompanying it could do with more salt though, in my opinion. Nevertheless, flexibility was applied when I asked to exclude the tomato slices, which satisfied me.

The team members are friendly and caring, and I had two of them coming round to the table asking if everything was alright. With the attention given, what can I say but ‚ÄúPerfect‚Äù."
It's now Zhi-char ala cart buffet,"It has been over 2 years since my last visit (which we had a good dinner buffet then back in 2018) here and so decided to come back, knowingly that due to the Covid19 social distancing measures, the buffet has now changed to ala cart, which means we place order the food, they will be cooked and served to us.

It was a Saturday and rainy day, the restaurant was empty throughout our entire dinning session, with only 3 tables occupied, in total about 12 diners. But the ambience remained cosy, bright and nice.

We were instantly ushered by the friendly staff to the table by the window which we could have a good view outside.

Honestly, the spread of this zhi char buffet is quite limited, with a total of about 12+ dishes, that included a complimentary curry fish head and glass jelly with longan, the others were mainly fried vegetables, pork and chicken.

While the spread is limited, the food was generally nice and yummy. Some of the dishes that I must compliment included the curry fish head (nice and fragrance, not too milky), Prawn paste chicken (crispy and fragrant), oyster omelette, sweet and sour pork, seafood bee hoon and pig trotters.

The food were served quite fast and in right portion so that wastage can be minimized.

Service by staff were great, not only they were friendly, our used plates were regularly cleared off by the efficient and attentive staff. They also initiated conversations requesting for feedback for the food etc.

As for value for money, originally, the price is $40 per pax but they have a promotion ongoing and so the price is $28.80. With the spread and quality of food, it's reasonable, considering this is from a 4-star hotel with great ambience.

However, I would like to suggest some areas for improvements.

First, for the menu, it will be great to include a soup, as most Chinese start their meal with soup, it can be radish or water cress soup etc. Next, can include 1~2 seafood dishes like steamed/grilled fish or prawns since not everyone like to eat so much meat these days due to health reasons (they can balance this by reducing 1~2 meat dishes). Third, though they include a complimentary glass jelly, it will be good if they can provide some cut fruits or Chinese tea will be perfect.

Overall, we had a satisfactory dinning experience and hope they will improve and we will surely return again."
Excellent lunch on a Monday,"Excellent lunch on a Monday 16th March 2020.

Thank you Chef who prepared a very tasty Chicken Rice (served in an unique plate), Full Monty (perfectly cooked and plated) and we-will-crave-for-more Durian Pengat.

Staff were very helpful, prompt and precise! Shout out to Min Hui and Jasmine! Both of you took care of us throughout. Ë∞¢‰∫ÜÔºÅ"
Four Points Eatery,"Only went for Breakfast but had a Great variety of food, always hot, great service and friendly staff who always had a smile on their face."
Good Service By Entire Team,SUJATA MAM Has Served The Food Perfectly And Mr Majesh Sir Has Made The Delicious Food And All of us Relished the Food
Excellent service,"It was really interesting to eat here, the food was nice, the service was great though, music is on point.Sujata here was a really good company, knew how to handle customers."
"As usual, very good buffet...","As many time said, staff, quality, service.... everything is there to make us enjoying.... for sure a place to come back... as often as possible...."
Restaurant,Food was awesome . The ambience and hospitality was extremely good . No words to say.. the staff name Sujata was very friendly with my wife
not really a choice,staffs were friendly and service was good. however the variety of dishes are limited. the herbal prawn soup is really tasteless.
Buffet visit,"The food was really satisfactory and the service is good as well. For the price, highly recommended!"
Nice combination of outdoor and indoor dining ambient,The Alaskan King Crab was awesome! Nice mix of western and local delight. But the service was a bit disappointing. Not up to international standard buffer service
Unequal treatment,Service crew was nice and friendly but the food service was way too slow. This is especially true if you are having the seafood madness because they prioritise ala carte orders over that and if more ala carte orders go in then your order will just get shift backwards.
Buffet Dinner,staff is friendly and responsive.Food is average. still love the Durian Penget. Missing is Raw oyster.
Good place for dinner,Good dishes and nice staffs. They changed my desert because they feel I don't really enjoy it and it is impressive. Will be back
One for one promotion,One for one promotion should extend to reservation via cash payment also and not to diners with voucher
Good Brunch to end my week,"Free flow Apple Cider and Prosecco, 1 for 1 for this deal. Can‚Äôt ask more for it. This brunch deal is a steal!"
Excellent service from Mohan,"Excellent service from the restaurant manager, Mohan and his team. Mohan is Personable, approachable and greeted me at the door step. Pleasant dining experience."
Birthday treat,"Was there with my wife to celebrate my birthday. It was a pleasant experience with good food, good service & value for money"
Decent food but limited varieties,"Ate buffet dinner at Four Points Eatery with Chope 1-for-1 weekend buffet dinner voucher. Ambience was cosy, staffs were attentive and fast in clearing the used plates. However varieties were limited especially the desserts. It‚Äôs probably still worth the money with the 1‚Äìfor-1 voucher used, if without the promo, I would suggest dine at somewhere else as it would be too expensive given that choices were limited and no oysters either. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the herbal prawns. Prawns were big and sweet. I like the durian pengat too and that was the only dessert I ate from the dessert section as other cakes didn‚Äôt appeal to me at all. The Dilmah tea selection was quite good too.

From our table, we had a good view of Robertson Bridge. I asked a young female staff how to get to the bridge, she just answered ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù and walked away. Well she did sound apologetic but I think she could do it better with ‚ÄúI am not sure, but let me check with my colleagues.‚Äù Anyway, I later checked with another more senior looking male staff and turned out we could access to the bridge just by going through the outdoor seating section via either of the 2 exits."
Seafood madness meal at Four Points Eatery,"Bought a seafood madness meal for 2 on Chope.I ordered the one with chilli crab sauce.Redemption wof voucher was easy.
Portion was generous was many prawns,some Alaskan crab claws,mussels and crabs. There were also sausages ,sweet corn and baby potatoes. Sauce wasn't too spicy which is fine with me.
We had so much to eat and ended up packing away some of it. Service was good. Enjoyed my meal."
Good meal with good service,The Eatery at 4 Points Singapore was a welcome surprise with one of the better chicken rice lunches I have tried in Singapore. There is indoor and outdoor seating with nice background music. The restaurant has a spacious interior and Patio is facing the riverwalk for great views.
Good Spread.,"Enjoyed the wide spread of dishes. friendly staff. Hmmm,prefer to have bowl ice cream instead of stick ones."
Dinner buffet has not much varieties .,"If seated outside, there was not enough staff. Very hard to get attention. There wasn't much choices. Even with 1-for-1 voucher, it's $40+. I rather spend more money and go other buffets."
Food is a bit disappointing,Food is a bit disappointment. Cereal crab meat is a bit tough and dry which I look forward to it. Complimentary prawn is a bit soggy.
Birthday cake was not served even reminded few times,"My family went there to celebrate my son's 21st Birthday. We booked a table for 4 persons, during booking told the staff is for birthday celebrations, and was told will give a small cake specially for Birthday, request was recorded as told by the staff.
On the actual day, while went in for the buffet dinner, at the counter also told one of the staff, and reply was the cake will be served at the end. But when almost to leave after the buffet, approach the counter staff and asked, he said nothing was recorded and he said he was not the one to answer my call and I did not talk to him about the birthday cakes at all. Very disappointed with this type of service.
Just pushing away the responsibility"
food was varied and plentiful for breakfast. the have gluten free options for both breakfast and dinner,staff were very helpful and went out of their way to accommodate my specific dietary needs. The food was well cooked and there was a separate GF menu
Not worth it,"Food choice was super limited. Not worth it even with 1 for 1 promotion. Even though it was supposed to be a birthday celebration and we talked to a few staff about it and they said they will prepare a small cake, after we finished dining we went to the staff again and he said ‚Äòare you sure you talk to me just now?‚Äô ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs no record here‚Äô"
Buffet,Prompt in getting my reservations. Service of the staff was great! Will recommend it to my friends and family.
Second visit,"Love the quality of food hence back for the second time. However observed that the crab becomes much smaller in size and tuna sashimi not as fresh. Other than that, love the spread. The plus point is the great customer service from the team. Special thanks to Alex for being very attentive too!"
Terrible buffet!,"Only service crew deserve some praise, thanks for their dedication and clear my table. Thank you!

Is the worst hotel buffet my wife and i had.

1. Poor variety of food, felt like being cheated. 4 star hotels like this serve less than 10 proper hot dish. The only decent poultry dish i had is roasted pork and grill lamb.
2. Menu said have lobster laksa, end up served chicken laksa.
3. The dang-gui prawn soup is a jokes, 2 prawn dipped inside water.no taste.
4. Meat and poultry taste either over cooked or not fresh, can smell the stench from meat. Not properly process before cooked.
5. The baguette and choice of dinner bun is stone hard and able to kill any strays dog, damn hard and not fresh.
6. Poor serving, food finished and not replenish on time.
7. No soft drink serve, i must repeat 3 times! NO compliment soft drink! only coffee and plain water not even some fruit punch serve.
8. Stingy serving, only 1 customer is entitle to ONLY 1 baked prawn! and the prawn was over baked.
9. Raw Salmon belly is fibery, not well processed
10. Poor cold seafood selection, picture shows oyster but serve cold LALA, what a jokes!
12. Curry crab - worst seafood crab cooking i have ever hard, taste like curry powder marinate crab. Smell stench too and not fresh.
13. All foods doesn't not look like a 4 stars hotel standard, for a premium like $80+ plus, i expect a quality equivalent to it and not a quality of $30 dollar. Sorry i will never never never recommend to any friend nor come back."
Good service by Alex and Suresh,Excellent service by Alex‚Äôs team. Exceptional and highly recommended üòÄ food was great and overall environment was pleasant :)
"Food is good, but not much choices.","The food is good, only comment is not much choices, if compare to bigger buffet restaurant. The service can be improve. Overall for the price, is okay."
Disappointed,"Disappointed by the service and the food varieties. Clearing of dishes was slow. Complimentary dish was served to other tables that arrived after us (not just 1, but more than 3 tables) and was given the reason by the server ""Not sure how the kitchen prepare the order."" This is unprofessional and so unwelcoming. By the time the dish was served, we were full and was having our desserts."
Food is just normal,Not worth the money. Food taste average .nothing special . Feels like normal 30 dollar buffet or even worse .
Excellent,"Super fresh and very high quality seafood, fantastic chili crab sauce and nice atmosphere. I think their dish (Seafeast Madness Set) is better than Jumbo's. The restaurant doesn't serve fried bun though."
sunday brunch,"the service is better than the food lol. I was impressed by a trainee whose name is Shaftnie i believe. He is very courteous, kept my 2 year old boy entertained, gave him complimentary colour pencils and my glass of presseco full.
The buffet itself is decent. There's seafood on ice, sashimi, liver herbal prawns and roast beef. With a chope 1 for 1, it works out to be a good deal."
Ok breakfast buffet,"For a 4* hotel, the breakfast buffet was acceptable. There was a bit of everything- eggs, usual breads, fruit, Chinese noodles, local food (fried rice), Indian, and Japanese miso. But nothing stood out."
Excellent service with nice location,"I stayed this hotel more than 50 nights for business this year, i went to restaurant for breakfast, lunch or dinner every day.

I would recommend the restaurant service rather than food, because the serivce completely consistency, especally ackowledge Joanne, she really treating guest as family, and you will feel you are stay with family and thanks for your great serve during my lunch or dinner time."
Great taste,"Eat inside or out just in front of the lovely Singapore river, the service was excellent the food delicious and the drink lovey and cold not cheap but not the most expensive either and if your a guest at the hotel you get a good discount which makes it even more affordable give it a try you won‚Äôt be disappointed we weren‚Äôt."
