DISAPPOINTING Supposely a 5* (star!?) F&D Outlets !!,"1)Poor Ambience
2)Food Quality Poor @ High price level
3)Very POOR Patronage explain ALL
4)Restaurant ASPIRES to be TOP Level 5* (stars!?) per the prices they hag on their dishes. This FAILS Miserably. The BEST the Restaurant can qualify likely 3* star rating !! The LOW Patronage Clearly verify this.
5)We repeat our visit after decades and Surprise the overall qualities/aspects have Gone DOWN !! SAD for HEONG LEONG Group, who owns this Outlet, which likely cause LOSES year after Year !!"
Chinese Restaurant With Ambience inspired by Shanghai‚Äôs Golden Age,"I was impressed and wow-ed by the ambience of this chinese restaurant. Surprised by its nostalgic setting! High Ceiling, Elegant Chandeliers, Roman styled Wall Cladding (East meets West) and a Stage with Singer singing ‚ÄúYe Lai Xiang‚Äù type of songs‚Ä¶ setting of restaurants during Shanghai‚Äôs golden age of 1930s, as mentioned in their webpage.

Food served were good too, tried their Sweet & Sour Pork (Well executed and balanced in terms of flavours, sauce and texture of meat), Braised Beancurd (Sauce was thick & savoury, prawns were fresh & chewy, but feel they can do better for their beancurd, else could have been perfect!) and Shanghainess Fried Rice (Highly recommended by their manager - Not bad, but it could have been better if its more flavourful).

Overall, it was still a pleasant dining experience. Service Staffs were attentive and patient. Will return to try more dishes."
Dinner with professor!,"As another treat, professor introduced us to the Grand Shanghai Restaurant located in downtown Singapore. Unfortunately, because TEL3 has not commenced service yet in September 2022, therefore we exchanged to a bus which took us to the restaurant‚Äôs door. We enjoyed lovely service as we entered the restaurant, and had a lovely discussion with my professor. The food was very good- despite the soup being slightly too heavy on oil, the other dishes including the fried rice, the chicken, and the Shanghainese dim sums were all really tasty. One thing to commend on is the live performances in the restaurant- this was a really enjoyable experience!! Plus it added on to the fun during our dinner meal. The ambience was lovely and we had a very nice evening in the restaurant. Overall, the price was very reasonable in a lovely Chinese restaurant- and I definitely recommend this restaurant to other visitors coming over to Singapore. Very enjoyable evening!"
"Bad service, food a great disappointment","Service was a disappointment from the start. Where do I even start? We booked 2 private rooms 6 months in advance for a 70th birthday celebration for Sep‚Äô22. Only to be informed weeks before as we didn‚Äôt place a deposit to secure the booking, they had to cancel our booking that was due to their internal mismanagement that was not properly communicated internally and trying to accuse me! Utterly disappointment!!! Out of goodwill, we settled for an alternative date. Come actual event day, service was hostile and horrible, food was utterly disappointing, cold and bland. The staff keep chasing us to end our party around 10 pm with black face while there were guests outside the private rooms! We will never come back to the restaurant anymore. Sucks big time!"
Our favorite restaurant!!!,"Good food, nice atmosphere, reasonable prices by Sing standards. So many restaurants in Sing have bad service nowadays but this restaurant is still as good as ever. My family's favorite for Sunday lunch...or dinner!!!"
Grand Shanghai Restaurant Service Staff : Li Zong Miao (Ms),"My in-laws were full of praise for her prompt and attentive service despite checking on few tables at one shot, thumbs up!"
Great service and delicious food,Was served by Li Zong Miao and very happy with the service and food The pig ear and deliciou cold dish was very delicious
lunch,"We had a wonderful lunch here with family friend. The service staff were excellent and attentive. nice food, we will come back again soon."
"Grand Shanghai, Grand Indeed","GRAND SHANGHAI

At Kings Center has been around for some time & is a favourite with many Singaporeans! Very much a trip down memory lane for those that are familiar with the Old Shanghai, including the life entertainment!

Service was decent, and forthcoming! A true classic in many ways!

Of course such food is best enjoyed with a group of friends, and a table of 10 is recommended to be able to enjoy the full menu, but a selection of 4-6 dishes will suffice for a smaller group!

Traditionally you start with between 6-8 Appetizers! The classics include the Crispy Eel, marinated chicken & cucumbers! Turnips, Tofu skin filled & of course a classic broth!

The steamed Fish stood out, loved the Camphor smoked duck, crisp prawns, outstanding the Fried Egg White with Crabmeat!

Overall a very decent representation of Shanghainese Cuisine, certainly worth a visit!

Great Ambience,"Chose this restaurant for our 10th-year anniversary dinner after seeing good reviews on TripAdvisor. The ambiance of the restaurant was great. There was no live band performing due to Covid. The restaurant was not crowded on a Friday night. The food was very good and the staff was very attentive throughout our dinner. The price may be a bit expensive but acceptable to come here on special occasions. Love the smoked duck as there is really the smoked smell to it. Can skip the roasted chicken as it was pretty average.

Wedding at Grand Shanghai,"We had our wedding dinner at Grand Shanghai on the 18th of September. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic we had to postpone our original date but our wedding coordinator Iling was very accommodating and allowed us to shift our schedule twice.

The quality of the food for the food tasting and the actual day was excellent and we made some changes to the final menu but only due to our guests taste preferences.

On the actual day most of it went quite well and our guests throughly enjoyed the dinner and the ambience of the restaurant. There were some slight hiccups that occured on the actual day however we appreciate the restaurant's kind gesture to make it up to us with a complimentary meal for our families.

I would like to thank all the staff at Grand Shanghai for making our experience on our big day a positive and memorable one. Overall we had a great experience at Grand Shanghai and their food quality and service is really excellent :)"
