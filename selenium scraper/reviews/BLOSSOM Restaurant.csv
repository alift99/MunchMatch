Lunch post Christmas,"We had a lovely lunch at Blossom. Food was served very quick and service was prompt and attentive. Tea was filled without being asked and dirty plates were cleared quickly. Staff was also attentive to the elderly members of my family. I find the tim sum served, tasty without being salty."
service excellent,"service was amazing and excellent from Sandy and Cinny. For food was average, Peking duck meat cut too big, unable to wrap and for old people unable to bite. some dishes presentation was bad also."
"Nice food, service, ambience","Everything's good. The food and the service were very nice. Definitely will come back here when i go back to SG. I tried the beef, pork, roasted chicken and spicy chicken. All are very nice."
Good Service & Modern Ambience,"Pleasantly attended by Emilia who is thoughtful in my preferences, bringing me the types of chilli i like to match with my dishes, polite & cordial. The manager Roger is service oriented too, assisted me with my reservations & patient with my requests. Food is delectable."
"Friendly staffs, good food","Good varieties of food, attentive staffs especially Carol Lee and Mei See. good location, located at sands hotel at ground floor"
Good food and great staff,Food was amazing and the staff were super nice (especially Judy who was very friendly and accommodating). We had a lot of the dim sum and the Peking Duck. The mini cheese pie with waygu and foie gras was our favorite.
Delicious Meal,My husband and I had a delicious meal at Blossom. We had the peking duck which was amazing! Sandy taught us how to eat it and helped us order two delicious desserts. We had the steamed lava salted egg yolk bun and chilled glutinous rice with ice cream served in a coconut. Both were excellent and unlike anything we‚Äôve had in the US.

Dinner at Blossom on 29/10/2022,I visited on 29/10/2022. Excellent service by Carol and Xiu Wen! They were attentive to details. Food was good!
Mr,Excellent smoked duck. Smell like from charcoal oven. Must bring family to go eat again. Pricing reasonable for such a well decorated and high class restaunt at MBS hotel lobby.
Mouldy duck,We ordered Peking duck and unfortunately both the duck as well as the bread was mouldy! Total disaster and not recommendable. Better choose one of the other restaurants in MBS!
Blossom,Good service from emilia. Food is good too! Will come back and have it again sometime soon! Price is reasonable. üòã

Blossom Restaurant Review,Excellent service by Lynn and Peggy. They are very efficient and helpful towards customers. My family and I are well taken care of throughout our dining experience here. Food tastes good and served fast and hot. Would highly recommend for anyone to try.
Bad Super Bad,"Just entered menu given and was like rushing. Open menu not for 5 mins asking what we want to eat. Don‚Äòt have time for us to see clearly for every dishes (there is only 2/3 table being served at the time). During the time waiting for our food, worker chit chatting in loud voices. After finishing our food, not even a second they start to keep away the plates. Every second is rushing the customer. Food nice, service no comment. Please train your workers again in order to let your customers have good experience while eating."
Great Service,"Great Service from Feng Yu and Sze Huei! Fast, quick, constantly refilling our tea, polite and respectful"
Wow,"This is one of the best Chinese restaurants I have been in in the whole city. Top quality stuff, bravo. I am staying in the sands hotel and the restaurant is right down stairs in the lobby area"
Great dining experience,"Attentive staff, great food and nice dining. Special call out to the service staff at the restaurants"
Outstanding,"First, kudos to Blossom for outstanding service. Sandy took excellent care of us and made great recommendations. Do not miss the cold Sichuan chicken appetizer and their scallop and crispy prawn appetizer. The smoked duck is to die for and they make a good mojitos."
Delicious food,"We found ourselves at Blossom as we foolishly hadn‚Äôt made a booking at MBS on a Friday eve and thought we could just waltz in. Luckily Blossom had free tables and we were so pleased. Friendly and helpful staff (Emilia), great food. I‚Äôm a pescatarian and the rice with avocado and sweet n sour mushroom were great. Husband had beef cubes in garlic and was very happy. No room left for desert"
Lunch at the Marina Blossom - thumbs up!,"We took some of our dearest friends from the UK to this restaurant even if we have never tried it ourselves. Everything went perfectly from the time we were shown to our table, and we had exceptional customer service from Roger and Carol. The Peking duck was divine and they served the pancakes to us and spared us the trouble of putting them together ourselves. We ordered some dimsum delights and a few dishes from the a la carte menu. They all tasted so good. My favorite apart from the Peking duck was the steak cubes in garlic. We did not have room for dessert so we had to skip it. Overall a great culinary experience and I would not hesitate to dine there again (and again)."

Top quality for Chinese food !!!,"Location of Blossom is in between the three towers at the lobby level of Marina Bay sands. Even tough it can be a bit noisy and location is just in the middle of the active life of the lobby pass byers, the food is just excellent. Quality is above your expectations and service was efficient and very friendly. Particularly I would like to thank Roger who made our dinner so special with his professional manners and kindness, very good job!!

Lunch at Blossom,"Food and service are generally good.
There was hair found in one of the bowls of classic dumpling soup. A bowl was replaced.

Spinach with cordycep flowers was tender and delicious. Sweet sour pork was crisp and flavorful, though a tad too big for bite sized eating."

Fantastic food and great service!,"We tried Blossom for the first time and the food was excellent. We ordered the peking duck and had it in noodle form. There was alot of duck meat and the noodles were flavourful.

Peking duck meat was spot on as well. So was the garoupa in preserved vegetables.

Another memorable dish was the fish maw with conch. The broth was delightfully fishy and it was piping hot!!

To top it off excellent service from all staff especially Feng Yu and Yoke Lin!!!

We shall be back!!!"

Best Chinese Cuisine at Marina Bay Sands,"We decided to come to Blossom‚Äôs for lunch at Marina Bay Sands. The party of 10 of us, 5 adults 5 kids had a great time at Blossom. Good food, great service by the crew. First we had Roger taking our order. Roger made ordering a fun process as he chatted with my husband while ordering, he was even able making us laugh. Food was great! We had Peking Duck and Dim Sum. The service crew Judy, Emilia, Sandy, Cinny were very helpful and courteous. They were very sincere and even interacted with the kids, make them happy. We enjoyed our lunch at Blossom immensely! Thank you for the great service!"
Terrible service,"Went down to have lunch with my friends and was disappointed at the service provided by the male server and female server that wore black jacket. They were rude and disgruntled tone when we want order our food. I was amazed at this price point and how established this restaurant was, the service provided not even up to the standard of a normal restaurant. Nevertheless, food was good, but i won‚Äôt visit with such lousy services provided."
Family‚Äôs to-go for occasions,Serves dimsum during lunch and Chinese food during dinner. Service staff are very friendly - shoutout to Auntie Kelly and Chee Wei! Must try: bamboo clam with vermicelli & peking duck.

Always our go-to Chinese restaurant,"Situated in MBS, Blossom has been our family fave and wallet-friendly restaurant with a wide selection of great canton dishes and dim sum.

Our fave dishes are the peking duck, with just a top up of $10, you can request to have the remaining duck meat wok fry with ee-fu noodles and its our Must Order dish everytime we are here.

We love all the service staff too who are very friendly and attentive, especially Auntie Kelly!! She'll always make sure we end our meal with sweet desserts although we cant fill our tummy with anymore food."

She was super helpful and did a super good job recommending the food for the big group. We really appreciate her services and will look forward to be back! Thanks
Chinese,"Stayed at MBS and had dinner here 1 evening. They stopped taking online bookings as people do not turn up. üòÖ Front desk service was friendly, the servers less so Food is ok"
Lacklustre service in Blossom branch Marina Bay Sands,"The waiters keep intervening with our private conversations by asking us how much food has arrived and ignoring our request to leave the menu behind.
When they clear away the plates they do not ask your permission, especially when there is still food left.
When we ask to speak with the restaurant manager, no one came. This is very bad service as compared to other restaurants in Marina Bay Sands."
Couple family-style dinning experience,"Good food, attentive staff and service. Our favourite restaurant in Marina Bay Sand complex. Tonight we happily enjoy two claypot dishes and dry fried beef noodle. Will come back for Peking duck next week. Thank you excellent service by Chee Wee, Ken and Judy."
