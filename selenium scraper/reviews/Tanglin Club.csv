Very good club,"I had been to Tanglin Club some years ago with friends and was there again recently as a reciprocal club member for a short time - had dinner at the tavern was amazing and delicious
Had a dim sum lunch in the Chinese Restaurant that was very nice though the restaurant was small but food and service was very good
Hope travellers to Singapore having friends of relatives who are members of this Tanglin club should visit for a meal at the club"
Location.Food. Room -quality,"Stayed here for 2 nights stopover for business. This old club exudes understated quality. An excellent room, great bed, nice bathroom, great food and facilities"
Well run and efficient,"The staff were all excellent
We stayed 3 times and we were impressed as they always had the room ready in the original building
The choice of restaurants was excellent 5 restaurants
The only negative is from Monday to Friday for breakfast we have to use the sports bar with limited breakfast
The sport facilities are excellent
The prices in comparison to Singapore is good value"
The Churchill Room restaurant for no corkage Mondays,"We went there on a Monday because that day you can take your own wine and there's no corkage charge. My husband is a wine buff who organizes wine lunches and dinners. Everything in the Churchill room looks delicious.

How is this restaurant better than the Tavern across the hall? The Tavern has a buffet. Here your main course is presented under a lift off gleaming dome. The tables are more spaced out for more privacy.

The best part is the Crepes Suzette, made on a trolley with the flames visible under the frying pan. The chocolate dessert, less dramatic, tasted equally good."
Classy yet comfortable rooms & great restaurants!,Stayed at the Club two nights and tried out a few restaurants. The rooms were spacious and well appointed. The Chinese Restaurant Tang Yun was simply outstanding. The Poolside Restaurant had a nice casual ambience and a bustling busy spirit about it. Enjoyed our stay and will repeat
"Great room, delicious food","My son and I stayed here for 2 nights during our visit to Singapore. We managed to get a room through a member of Tanglin Club. Our room charge included $20 a day to spend on food and drinks. We bought Chinese New Year goodies to bring home with the money so it was much appreciated.

The room we stayed in was huge and had a balcony overlooking the pool area. It also had a large bathroom with a tub and a separate shower. The rollaway bed was very hard so after a night, my son decided to share my bed instead.

Although we didn't use it, the library in Tanglin Club is stocked with books and dvds you can check out. We did eat at the pool side restaurant for a breakfast and lunch and both times, the meals were great. We especially liked the fish and chips and immunity smoothies!

We will definitely stay here again given the chance!"
I saved five stars for this,"Every dish was a delight for the eyes and the tastebuds. I had salmon, lamb and crepes suzette. For drinks, a glass of Prosecco and a pint mug of water melon juice. Can't wait to go back. The bring your own bottle night is Monday, and I believe there is corkage to pay."
Lunch Treat with 3 friends,"We had 2 bowls of mushroom soup to start with and ordered a gent’s and ladies set comprising beef steak, mashed potatoes and salad greens plus an Asian char kwayteow & ended the meal with 2 plates of lava cake with Vanilla ice cream. The restaurant was packed during lunch hour and we enjoyed our lunch."
Premier club in Singapore with...,"... a really nice site, huge pool, roomy rooms and a very relaxed breakfast athmosphere. Thru my membership in London Oriental Club I had the pkeasure to get a temp membership. Recommend, not cheap, but stylish"
A great colonial club,An amazing club located in central Singapore with a very nice colonial style setting and service. All personal is very service-minded and the overall atmosphere is amazing at this club. Food is some of the best in Singapore.
Wonderful dining experience,"We had a fabulous dinner. Everything was perfect! The meal was incredible, the staff really helpful and we enjoyed listening to the live music performance."
Still the place to go in Singapore.,"Still the place to go in Singapore. The club maintains a happy mix between old colonial and modern Singapore, backed up by thoroughly modern facilities and pleasant but unobtrusive staff. The rooms are well equipped, large and airy. Every meal I had was good, both western and local dishes. I’m not too keen on the current system of paying, trying to balance how much cash to put on your card rather than just pay when you depart but I guess they’ve had some bad experiences. Thoroughly recommended."
A Premier Club,"Very nice club. Maintained & Administered as it should be. Everything from convinience, service and ambiance is as should be. Recommended to join the waiting list."
The Club,"Visited the club for some drinks and dinner,with my host who has been a member for a long time!
It was an awesome experience, as it had the decor and class of history,alongwith all the modernity!
Staff very really really exceptional as well as personal,as that is rarity.
The food as well was excellent!
Revisit to Singapore after 25 years,but it was definitely a highlight!"
Great food with company to match!,"Our friends took us to 1 of the newer restaurants & ordered foods to engage our palette as well as try new dishes. We enjoyed the fresh produce & innovative cooking styles with warm, friendly staff who took exceptional care of us. I particularly enjoyed the delicately crumbed & fried eggplant and Chinese broccoli plus desserts. My daughter said it was the best Peking duck she had tasted! The desserts were beautifully presented and flavoursome. The club itself is kind of majestic with other interesting restaurants.
A historic place and I believe the oldest club in Singapore, Tanglin is located in the midst of shopping areas although in itself quite tranquil. You need to be a member or have membership of a reciprocal club to enjoy to attend the Tanglin Club.
A thoroughly enjoyable experience."
Party at the Tanglin Club,"The second visit to the restaurant for a large party dinner. Overall food and service were very good, and ambience was fantastic as well."
National Day Event,The Tanglin Club is an exclusive private club with patronage only by members. The event is a charity fundraiser for scholarships to help needy girls to pursue education for social mobility. The main hall was the venue and the Peranakan theme in the food spread and the decor were most apt to highlight the meaningful event.
Old World charm,You almost felt that you were in a bastion of the last days of the British Raj It’s a wonderful Club with discrete service and a charm of its own I was surprised by how big it was Fantastic service
"Good ambience, good food",The Tanglin Club is one of Singapore’s oldest social clubs where those that can afford memberships come and gather to share meals and cocktails. My wife and I were invited to have dinner The Tavern and the first thing I noticed was how extensive the menu was. Our group had a pretty eclectic set of entrees from rack of lamb to HK style braised cod to satay skewers.
THE TAVERN: NOTHING WRONG & DECENT QPR,This is a classic casual and favorite meeting place since it is so well located. Food is fine and prices are reasonable but wish they could serve red wine at correctly temp of 18C since room temp for Singapore is far too warm...
Tang Yuan,Invited to dine in the Chinese restaurant on the 2nd storey of the Club among old friends. Good & tasty Chinese Zhi char style food but within a posh setting. Nice decor & attentive staff. Good for leisurely eating & chit chat away from the hustle & bustle of local Zhu char restaurants or stalls.
"Tanglin Club Has Fine Dining Class, Ambiance & Service to Match","My wife and I have dined at this premier club ( established in 1865 ) on at least four other occasions. On each visit, it proved to have been a great choice. It was the same on this occasion.
We were in the city state for a show / performance at the Sands Theatre, at Marina Bay Sands the night before.
On this visit, we decided to dine again at the Tavern Restaurant & Pub. We were given a cheery welcome by the head waiter and promptly shown to a nice table.
We looked at the menu and were suitably impressed by the wide and varied choices before us.
We settled for a Seafood Risotto dish for my wife and I opted for a Wagyu Steak ( 180 gm ). It was simply excellent. Prior to that, I had a half dozen baked oysters with cheese. For drinks, I had a beer and then a glass of delicious Chianti.
For dessert, we shared crepe suzette. The orange tang to it gave it a special taste.
I finished the meal with a glass of Irish Coffee.
The service by the waiters and waitress was knowledgeable, courteous, alert and friendly. I have dined at many premier and private clubs in Malaysia and if I had to rate this club for its overall dining experience, I would readily give it 3 Michelin stars. It is that good."
Amazing club,Have a very close friend staying in Singapore as i was here for a conference he took me out of dinner at this place lobe this club very colonial like British setup huge first had couple of drinks at there bar watching the Monaco Grad Prix then moved inside the restaurant for dinner the food was outstanding to die for so were the desserts its only members and there guest club so if you guys want to go you will need a member who could sign in for this wonderful experience.
Wonderful club - if you are invited say yes quickly!,"I first visited the Tanglin Club in 1978(!) and in recent years I have been lucky enough to be entertained at the club a few times. It was good 40 years ago and it is good now. The differences are that back then it was very much a club for expats and now it is quite definitely a club for locals, though only the very well-heeled kind. It is expensive to join and there is a long waiting list. It is in an excellent, easily accessible location. The Tanglin is far superior to the American Club in Singapore.

The club is extensive and has a wide range of entertaining and sports facilities, including a big, family-friendly swimming pool and tennis and squash courts; there is even a bowling green! There are restaurants that range from the informal, family-friendly by the pool, to a coffee-shop easy dining restaurant, and then there are the formal upscale restaurants such as the Chinese restaurant on the first floor and the Churchill on the entrance level. The club even has guest bedrooms.

As a non-member you can only go to the club if you are invited as a member - unless you are a member of another club that has reciprocal rights with the Tanglin. If you are invited to join someone at the club do not hesitate - be grateful and say yes quickly."
Early Evening Drink by Pool then Dinner,My wife’s family are members. We had drinks by the pool - Tiger beers and gin and tonics - followed by dinner in the restaurant. I opted for pasta with pesto and it was excellent. Family members wondered why not local but then I can get great local food for much less in a hawker centre. I sampled a their leftovers.
Dinner and drinks,Always love visiting the Tangling club in Singapore!! The Asian food is always good here and the staff friendly. U can fine dine or casual. They have a nice pool area too. I love the lift for the wheelchairs as there are many stairs to climb to reception. All in all we always have a enjoyable time at the club
Always consistant,"I have been staying at the Tanglin Club for over 30 years when visiting Singapore. During that time the Club has remained consistent in providing good service, varied meals to suit all tastes, interesting clientele and clean spacious rooms. I have been tempted to try some of the newer hotels which constantly seem to appear on Orchid Rd but I always fall back on the the consistent Tanglin Club."
Great club and experience,"Went with a member and had a great night out.

Drinks in the bar were lovely, quickly served and replenished quickly.

Dinner in the restaurant was equally good. Delicious meals and great service.

Churchill Room was very interesting to check out.

If we lived in Singapore this would be a Club we would be happy to be members at."
Excellent city club!,"This club is very user friendly, centrally located and quietly elegant, and has rooms and a few restaurants for various preferences. It has an excellent bright gym, and a mid size swimming pool with slightly salty water. Their restaurants are good. The Churchill Room is elegant fine dining, spacious, with a bar. The Tavern reminds you of an English pub - it serves a good menu with a few fusion choices. Their Chinese Tung Yuen restaurant serves good Cantonese dim sum and ala Carte dishes. There is a cosy Tea Lounge for quick bites and a relaxed afternoon tea. Their Tangles serve a nice range of salads and wraps, in addition to fruit juices and smoothies. Look out for their special events and festivities - they do it really well!"
Coffee & Dessert at the restaurant by the pool,We ordered coffee and dessert at The Tanglin Club and it was good. Not spectacular but good. Choc lava cake was ok. Gula Melaka was excellent.
The Tavern at The Tanglin Club,"We had a farewell gathering dinner for a friend. Ambience was nice. Service was slow as the restaurant was full house for the night. We ordered the seafood platter, free flow salad, British fish and chip and ends it off with apple pie and coffee. The British fish and chip took a long time to be served as the restaurant was clearly understaff. We were a group and most finished our meal before my friend was served her fish and chip. The free flow salad was pathetic and the top up was delayed although the captain promised that it would be done soon. We didn't see that being done by the time we ended our meals. The seafood platter and apple pies were delicious though."
tang yun restaurant,"if you are lucky enough to be a member, know someone who is or can somehow get into the Tanglin Club then eating at this restaurant is a must do.
It is probably the finest Chinese food i have been served. Everything is understated but perfectly presented.
The food arrives presented as an art form and has taste to match. Prices are reasonable too.
A Singaporean friend of mine described the Tanglin Club as one of the finest eateries in Singapore. He wasn'r exaggerating!!"
Excellent Tasting Menu,The Churchill room is a little “old style” but the food was extremely good and the service attentive. Four of us had the tasting menu and none of us was disappointed. Actually really surprised to find such high quality food here - close to if not Michelin star standard.
Comfortable overnight stay,"I have previously written a poor review about the Tanglin Club when an admin error meant that I was not allowed entry with my reciprocal membership. This time, paperwork all correct and I booked an overnight stay when passing through Singapore and credit where credit is due, I was impressed by the accommodation. An extremely large well appointed room with a nice outlook (we were pool facing) and it made a change not to be in a hotel but a more 'homely' location. Only criticism is that the windows were quite thin and it was a bit noisy when people were using the pool, and note, there are a lot of swimming lessons scheduled at w/es so guests do not have full use of the pool. But, good accommodation and I would stay again if the opportunity arose. To other reciprocal members: just make sure your paperwork is all correct, though they seemed less of a stickler about it for overnight bookings than day visits."
Very Tasty Food and memorable experience,"This is a members-only club in Singapore. One of our friends is a member of the club and we had lunch at the club. The ambiance is very good. The food and service are exceptional. We had Indian food: Naan, yellow dal and pulao rice.A memorable experience."
Nice buffet,"This is a members-only social club in an upscale neighbourhood of Singapore. One of our hosts had membership with this club, and so I had the treat to try them.

We had buffet dinner in a private room. The dishes were very good, and the staff kept pouring wine to my glass, which was also delicious as well. Although there weren't any eye opening dishes, the experience was very nice."
Exceptional meal,"We were there to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary.
Champagne gifted by no1 child all secretly organised with the staff. Fabulous staff, truely helpful.
All the food was glorious., we were so tempted to eat here on our final night but ate in the club Chinese restaurant."
A Typical English Club,"The Tanglin Club is quintessential British. You have to be a member to dine here and to use the facilities. There are a few restaurants to chose from. I particularly love the English Pub/Tudor Styled restaurant. Try the Fish and Chips, you'll love it."
Best place in town,"You either have to be a visiting member or know someone who is a member. Whatever you do try and in. You won’t regret it. A quiet hub in a bustling city. The amenities and service are 5 star, the restaurants amongst the best in Singapore. Sensational!!"
The 'Tavern' is one of Singapore's happening places,"If you're invited to the club for a meal by a member (members only), definitely choose the Tavern over the other options. It's the happening place with lots of buzz and comfort tavern food with a good range of local, Indian, and traditional British pub. Prices are also very fair, although as a guest you won't be allowed to pay. The Tavern's buffet (both lunch and dinner) is a favourite of its members and should definitely be checked out."
3 nights as guest in one of Singapore’s oldest institutions.,It offers the privicy of a club with hotel like rooms and service. The Tanglin Club can not just be booked but requires an introduction from a partner club.
Evening Meal with Family,"Dined at the restaurant whilst visiting family in Singapore - open to members only and their guests.
We ate in the Tavern - an oldy worldy British themed restaurant (bar type).
Gentlemen's cut rib eye steak, liver and onion, Guinness lamb stew.
Cherry confit, bread and butter pudding and a wonderful chocolate lava cake.
Good salad bar, excellent staff.
8/10."
An excellent reminder of the good things associated with tradition.,"Last days stay in Singapore - where to have lunch before enjoying your last few Singapore slings at Raffles prior to departing to the airport> Answer - Tanglin Club. Excellent location and a perfect preserved reminder of bye-gone days. Traditional food and drinks in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. Food selection is great - something that will suite everyone, excellent service and realistic pricing. Make sure when you visit Singapore you have affiliation arranged or know someone who can invite you into this excellent facility."
"Charm, elegance and utility","This is a very good city club upholding tradition and charm, providing a good range of restaurants, has an excellent gym, swimming pool, theatre, Libraries for adults and children, and even indoor tennis courts. Their restaurants serve different food for various dietary and social connection level preferences. You can be as casual or formal as you like here, and there are spaces and dress codes appropriate for the respective areas. Our favourite foods include Laksa, Nasi Goreng with Satay, avocado and coffee dessert and fried rice with fish eggs and scallops from Tang Yun restaurant, and dishes from their menu of North Indian cuisine. A great place to be healthy and engage socially."
Ideal for members of overseas affiliated clubs,"Most conveniently located and elegance of old times.
Reasonably priced variety of dining options.
Members of clubs outside Singapore having reciprocal affiliations and travelling to Singapore for short durations either for business or for tourism will find this club a boon. One can also stay as the club has residential facilities."
Fabulous club to stay at...if you have reciprocal membership,"This review is for those we are considering staying here if you are visiting Singapore and your Club has reciprocal privileges. We stayed in a room in the Club house (vs sports complex) which was HUGE. The Room included $40 for food and drink ($20/person) and free minibar which is stocked with cold drinks, sprite, coke light and coke. They provided toothbrush. Toothpaste, and standard bath toiletries. Since we had 2 young kids with us we were limited in which restaurants we could use. The Roundhouse which serves bkft, lunch and dinner had a great menu of western, local and Asian cuisine. The staff was super friendly and helpful. It was a great way to start our visit in Singapore.

There is a kids library as well as an adult one. A great pool and sports facilities.

It was an easy walk to orchard and easy place for taxis.

Would definitely stay there again!"
Good,"Not quite 4 but good nonetheless— good food, reasonable prices in a stodgy but pretty nice atmosphere"
"Superb location, but management is a bit snobbish","Great location in centre town near Orchard Road. Large premises allow for lots of activities and services, many more than the nearby American Club: tennis (indoor & outdoor), squash, pool, billiards, darts, movies, multiple dining facilities, rooms for members and overseas guests, etc. The quality of the food is, however, as mediocre, equal to a second-tier commercial restaurant. Outdated rules and dress codes - eg. no young children in many restaurants; must wear socks in the Churchill room; no open-toe footwear; etc. Fortunately, they have recently relaxed the enforcement of these rules. After all, this is not exactly an exclusive London club located on Pall Mall!"
Tavern - great ambience and food,"Tavern has a very nice British pub-like ambience with good food. Service was courteous and efficient. The menu selection has a good variety to choose from, which is helpful when coming in a large group."
Grand Old Lady Updated,"As a member of the Tanglin Club with a long waiting list to get in, it is certainly a throw back on interesting 'relics' of the British Raj ie, the ""Tavern"" with overtones of a gentleman's English pub cum white starched table cloths for international lunch or dinner. Functions at the Churchill Room carries over the tone set by the name of the room itself. Lots of amenities including a classy Chinese restaurant, a large area for members in an informal sports bar self service bridge room & watch indoor tennis or get a chance to play squash/out doors tennis, swim in the Olympic size pool and children's area; the list goes on. So if you are ever invited in as a guest or get booked into one of the 27 well appointed suites - it certainly is something to talk about if you are visiting Singapore."
Fantastic experience,"I am not sure if I should comment on the Tanglin Club as this is a membership club and I was invited to a large party, however I decided to comment on Churchill Room as the experience at the restaurant was fantastic. Excellent ambience, professional staff and very good food. Surprisingly roast beef was much better than expected (equal to top class quality in London)."
Colonial Comfort,"It is important to state that this is a Club, not a public venue. I have been privileged to have access thanks to my membership of a British Club which enjoys a reciprocal relationship, so I am grateful to the members and staff for putting up with us.
This is a very well run organisation. The swimming pool is terrific and is supported by a small play area and pool for little people. My eldest granddaughter absolutely loves the play room, where she spent hours playing with Lego.
And the food is absolutely up to standard, with excellent service. Thank you the Tanglin Club"
"Lovely Experience, but the club should be more outward in providing Rules and Information","We were guests at The Tanglin Club, and we loved the experience. The Guest Rooms are all one could wish for. The Rooms are modern and fully equipped, with Smart TV, Comfortable workspace, USB Wall Sockets for Charging, an extremely comfortable bed. There is plenty of storage space throughout the room. The shower en-suite is also great, with his and hers sinks, an extremely large mirror and a very comfortable dual-head shower. The cleanliness across the club is incredible, and house-keeping is top notch.

What we didn't appreciate is that we were not provided the necessary information, rules and regulations before hand. We were visiting with our daughter who is just 18 months old, and from 6 dining places on site, 4 off them do not allow children. We were not informed about this. We were also not informed which restaurants are open on which days, and so we had a very bad experience with trying to dine here on a number of occasions.

The Charge when paying by Card also was not appreciated.

The food in the restaurants we tried was always really good. Service tends to be hasty close to closing hours."
Nice evening Dinner,Dinner with family and friends.Homely club atmosphere with many restaurants and bars to eat and drink.Good food.Nice architecture.
Tang Yun for special occasions,"The Tanglin Club has lovely food in The Tavern which is jolly and has a bar and the coffee lounge both on the ground floor and the grand pricey restaurant called The Churchill also on the ground floor delivers great food for special occasions but is too big to be cosy. Tang Yun the Chinese restaurant upstairs is just right. The decor is perfect. Flowing lines on the ceiling. Whites and colours. Cloth and napkins. Not too noisy.
Nuts on the table whilst we are waiting to order. Water comes up straight away, fast.
Every dish a delight.
Reasonably priced sparkling wine. However, nowhere in the building has yet got a sweet dessert wine because they claim there's no call for it. I can't understand why a place this size with four restaurants can't manage what almost any pub and restaurant in the UK can provide in terms of range of drinks.
What else is missing? The sweetmeat such as a chocolate at the end of the meal. Toilets are elegant."
Excellent molecular food! Worth a visit,"A very nice restaurant. Great menu, great wines and excellent service. A must go to while in Singapore. In the evening the place is pretty hip."
Old graceful club,"It's very old club with well maintained building . We went here on an invitation by a friend who is members here . Enjoyed awesome Indian food here . Just too good beyond expectations . Not to miss coconut water , cheese parantha ."
"Private, but excellent if you can get a booking","This is a private club, but it's in the heart of Singapore, and has all the services of a good hotel - lovely rooms - but with the advantage of amazing value in terms of restaurants and sports facilities. As it's a club, the pool is brilliant, there are squash and tennis courts, and even a theatre which shows films. There is a strict dress code, but nothing too onerous. BUT you have to be booked in by a member, so it's very exclusive and hard to book."
Oasis in the centre of Singapore,"Open to club members and guests, the Tanglin club is steeped in tradition but moving into the 21st century with modern and comfortable hotel rooms, Cantonese restaurant, poolside restaurant, bars and of course the Churchill fine dining room.
Kids are relatively welcome and the club has nice outdoor play and poolside areas for the kids to spend time. The pool is salt water and superb for swimming. On weekends the underground cinema opens up for screening of recent run movies.
If you know a member or you have reciprocal rights its worth the bucks to stay at the Tanglin club for some well earned R+R when next you have the chance."
Laksa,Love their laksa. Very nice and authentic. Prices are also ok because they charge at a private club price. Recommended.
Best Cantonese food we have had in many a moon,"There are several dining venues at The Tanglin Club but this relates to our experience at Tang Yun restaurant. We spent two nights at the club as reciprocal members after disembarking our cruise in Singapore. The hotel accommodations were quite nice, well cared for and spotless and the rooms very large though the furnishings somewhat dated and lighting level was quite low compared to a deluxe accommodation. Brighter lighting would have made for a better stay. In addition, a room key card inserted into a slot near the entry door was required to activate the lights and air conditioning. Reverting to our old tricks, I placed a forgotten to return hotel key card in the slot and was amazed to find it didn't work as the lighting card receptacle apparently was computerized to read only the Tanglin key card rather than being a simple pressure switch. Well this meant my wife and I had only one key card between us as Singapore without air conditioning can be quite unpleasant.

But as for the Tang Yun, wow what a meal? The hot and sour soup (which I didn't know was Cantonese) was easily the best any of four diners had ever experienced. Three diners had it with seafood, but I opted for the non sea food version. Abalone, a great treat. Soft vegetarian noodles unbelievably scrumptious. The duck beyond compare and the list goes on.

Over the years we have dined on a lot of Chinese cooking, varying from Sunday take-out to family style banquets in China and gourmet restaurants in Beijing, but this meal ranked with the best we have ever eaten. And the service was correct and perfect."
Avoid the paella,"Avoid the paella in the wheelhouse restaurant, Tasteless, dry and lukewarm. The crabmeat was particularly disappointing and tasted like old soap left to dry in the sun. And it took nearly an hour to appear - the last 30 minutes doubtless spent 'resting' in the kitchen.
The wasabi prawns were excellent as was the Berenger Chardonnay."
Old style private club,"This is the heart of gentile Singapore society. Lots of dark wood paneling and quiet attention by the staff. An introduction as a guest or membership of a reciprocal club is required for entry, but is well worth it. We had the full afternoon tea, which was delicious. My only small gripe was that I like orange slice in my Earl Grey, but was told they could only provide lemon??"
Old style colonial,"Visited the club daily on our two week holiday to Singapore. We had family staying at the club, but we decided the accommodation was too highly priced. We obtained reciprocal membership through the scots club. My father in law and family have been visiting the club for over 60yrs. I found it to be very nice, old school. A lot of rules about dress etc in certain areas but by the pool and poolside restaurant it was fine. The price though was far above the standard of the service, there were a couple of very good waiting staff who were in charge but the majority were rushed off their feet and not great. The food was average/good standard (at the pool) overall I liked the place I just can't give it a higher than average rating because it is so expensive, 5 star prices with 3-4 star service. This place could be a real 5 star with not too much work."
An off-day?,"Had a business lunch there and since the place has the atmosphere of a grand colonial hangover, I'd expected better service than what was delivered. Forget the small error of delivering the wrong dish (though they had the table placement ""map"" on a side table), the food was nothing to rave about. In fact, the paella was way off standards. The colour of it was a dead giveaway and hint: it was not squid ink paella. And the lingering aftertaste made me suspect the kitchen crew or chef had not bothered doing much of the cleansing work needed for the seafood. Enough said, disappointment with what has been a classic."
"Excellent food and service at the Wheelhouse Restaurant, Tanglin Club","We had a family gathering at the Wheelhouse Restaurant, Tanglin Club. We ordered heaps of dishes including Nonya food. Everybody was happy with the food as it was delicious. We will certainly be back for more."
Fun Activities To Do At A Great Club!,"I love the Tanglin Club! It is very fun as they have loads of good activities. For kids and adults. They have a pool, with a kid pool To and has lots of slides and areas they can play! The Staff are usually very kind and friendly and overall a fun day at the Tanglin Club! Although, you have to pay a LOT to be a member or guest. It is rivarly with the British Club in Singapore, which is very popular! Also it is related to the Hurligham Club back in London, which I am a member there."
Having teat time with a spot of milk,"This place is indeed very prim and proper as they pay special attention to your dressing. Certain areas are dress code sensitive.

The food served here is great and the standards have been consistent throughout the years.

I had the opportunity to have high tea in the afternoon with a friend and I still enjoy the ambience of the place."
Great Pool - Just A Little Dirty!,"It is very pleasant at The Tanglin Club. Good rooms. Good for Children. Good service. Good food. Great pool, and a nice playground! The pool is just a little dirty, but excellent!"
Sunday by the pool,"The Tanglin Club should be absolutely embarrassed by the terrible service, shocking food quality and cost of guest parking at this so called exclusive club. As a member of clubs in many countries I would be embarrassed to take guests to this club. The food is disgraceful. The toilets are dirty and when I saw a restaurant person leave the toilets without washing their hands I was shocked. To park in that guest parking station on a Sunday for 3hrs cost $13.50 which is more expensive then Orchard Rd and is just a clear cash grab.

Anyway all I can say is I am glad I don't pay the amount of money they want each month for the privilege of being treated rudely by poorly qualified waiters in a poorly run organisation serving sub standard food. That club is surviving on its past glory and needs a complete revamp of people and facilities."
Nice food - Excellent service!,"If you are lucky enough to be a member of a club with reciprocal arrangements with this club then you really must pay a visit for lunch, or dinner, or afternoon tea, or drinks at the bars! I recommend the Tavern which is both a pub and dining room done up in old English style. But there is an outdoor terrace and an expensive posh dining room - the Churchill Room as well, plus a more casual eatery beside the pool. Great British grub here! - Kate & Sidney, Shepherds' Pie, 2 kinds of Fish 'n Chips with 2 kinds of batter!

Not to be missed if you are visiting Singapore!

Tip - bring your letter of introduction from your club, your club membership card, passport, Singapore Immigration Disembarkation Card, on your first visit to the Tanglin Club and get a little temporary Reciprocal Member's card for use at all their outlets."
Very pleasant,"Nice place to stay. Ice big rooms. Great restaurants. Excellent service. Lots of atmosphere, of Colonial Singapore."
Private club,"We were invited to this private club for our school reunion and judging from what we saw, it is a beautiful building with good restaurants and wealthy members. The concierge was fierce, telling a female member walking and talking on her mobile phone in no uncertain terms that use of mobile phones was not allowed. Yay, finally a place in Singapore where people cannot be frighteningly glued to their devices. Food was good, but this is to be expected in this marvellously foodie country. The club has a deep colonial history, is in the centre of town, and was where we as children would come to swim with our member friends (we were members of other clubs - Dutch, Swiss etc). It was fun to be back."
Wonderful members club,As this is a members club you are not able to just rock up but should you be a member of a reciprocal club or have friends in singapore that are members then I would suggest a visit here. The pool is great and he food at the tavern is really good value and decent. It also has one of the very few (if only) indoor tennis courts in singapore. If you are planning on staying in the guest rooms they are very good value with full use of the facilities and complimentary breakfast.
Nice old charm,"I just finished my lunch with my Singaporean associate at the newly opened Chinese restaurant at the first floor of this 125 year old club in Singapore. This signature restaurant serves traditional Chinese food. We had roasted duck with palm sauce, steamed fish with ginger and soya sauce and steamed rice. Food was well cooked and tasty. Decor of the place is modern but true to tradition. The Sauvignon Blanc we ordered was nice dry New Zealand wine. Post lunch we went to Tavern Bar cum restaurant at the ground floor where we ordered some crape with vanilla ice cream and coffee. I visit this club with my host every time I come to Singapore. Unfortunately, this facility is not open to general public and you need to have a member of this club who only can bring you here."
nice old (historical) club,"151 years old club. went their for a dinner in charchill room. there is also bar facility. very professional service. we have tried the special set menu of S$ 68. The quantity of food (main dish) is very small.

however, enjoyed the evening and had a wonderful dinner."
Disappointed,"I have been going here for over 30 years and arranged reciprocal membership on a recent Singapore however, due to an administrative error, I was not allowed in for lunch with my sister and our 82 year old father visiting from Australia. The front desk were unhelpful, intransigent and verging on being outright rude when they could tell we were visiting from a far, and there was a genuine mix administrative mix up. Very disappointed as I have many happy memories of meals and family events at this Singapore institution but after my treatment on this occasion, I will not be attempting to go back on my next visit to Singapore."
"Good food, though could be noisy at times.","My late mom's family friends treated me to the above place for afternoon tea on two separate occasions.

For the first time that we went, we were sitting at the corner. That was a rather busy Monday afternoon, thus it was rather noisy to talk.

On the 2nd occasion, it was not that busy, thus we managed to sit and had a nice chat.

We had the afternoon tea set, which was huge, with a variety of sandwich selections. We also had the apple pie, which was large and not too sweet luckily. We had the scorns and the curry puffs etc, for bringing back home to eat. In my view, these are best eaten hot then reheat them in the microwave oven.

This is one of the best places to go for afternoon tea. The only downside is that you need a member to sign you into the club.

We were each allowed servings of 2 different types of teas.

Another disadvantage is that the table was too small, since we ordered a lot of food, so we ended up having to put the tea pot on the floor."
Poor Information,"Called the club on two occasions to clarify their dress code and reciprocal club arrangements. Was told that a letter of introduction was needed, passport required and club membership card too. On arrival we were mugged for the taxi by an elderly group prior to entering. On presentation of our credentials to the desk staff we were informed that entry was to be denied. Why - because both of us did not have the white departure card. Why was this, because one member is a resident through work and thus does NOT have the White departure card. We were told under no uncertain terms would entry be allowed and out club had be informed of the rules which they had now. All in all frightfully disappointing and this left a sour taste in the mouth. Singapore at its worst!"
Lunch with my sister,The Peranakan and Western foods were gorgeous. But the place was pretty busy and noisy since it was a family restaurant. After all it was a lovely lunch.
Great atmosphere and good food,"Great location just off Scotts Road. Went with friends for lunch on Thursday. Beside a la carte, the day's special at Wheelhouse restaurant was Indian buffet.. wide range of salads, soup, curries, desserts . Food was tasty, and service excellent. Well recommended. However, you need a member to take you there."
Very pleasant and quiet place to stay - great pool,"Second visit as a reciprocal club member. A lovely, peaceful oasis close to Orchard MRT and many bus routes. There is a gorgeous and very large pool, several restaurants and the accommodation is spacious and well maintained. All the other things you would expect from this kind of club, including sports facilities.
The main restaurant is the Churchill Room, where we had an excellent dinner, with good service. The Wheelhouse, by the pool, is where they “serve” breakfast. The choice is limited and I put serve in quotes because it was poor – slow and not a smile evident anywhere. In fact, this was true elsewhere in the facility, including the front desk. The front desk was efficient and helpful if asked, but are the staff trained to not smile? Our air conditioning wasn’t working when we arrived and when I asked the front desk if it could be fixed (it was 36C outside) they shrugged and suggested it was a hot day. She agreed to report it to maintenance, but noted that it was a Sunday. Nevertheless, a little later a cheerful maintenance man showed up and agreed there was a problem. He called in another engineer and they fixed it. This was the best service of the entire stay.
Our last meal was in the tavern – excellent pub grub and friendly service.
NOTE that the comments below relate only to food and, since we ate in trhee reataurants (hence ""other"", below), it was difficult to rate. I tried to rate collectively."
Nice Club,"Very nice club in the heart of Singapore, walking distance from Orchard MRT, good food and nice surroundings. Expensive $9.60 for the cheapest pint."
Odd service for club,"Was refused entry to their main area for wearing a dark blue jeans. Well its their rules. So went to the more casual side.
Their service staff was ODD. For a club, their service staff was no better than hawker center - hawker center style singlish. Could have been a bit more decent?
Food wise - also not impressed. Had their bread-crusted prawns. Scallops for sharing looked like frozen scallops out of bag and tossed with some gravy and was good enough for 2 people.
Sure it was CNY and busy time but that is the time when not to compromise on service and food quality."
Great for all Occasions! Superb food and Staff,My family has been members here for years! we have spent many a new year celebrating in the Churchill room! No matter what the occasion the TC always has a restaurant to fit! Superb service and food throughout the club!
Rule Change,"Apparently Reciprocal Club members who are Singapore Residents are no longer welcome at Tanglin Club any more, since a rule change in October 2015. Very disappointing, as previous visits were excellent. Wont spend any time mourning Tanglin Club's loss, and happy to go elsewhere."
One of my favourites,As someone that grew up in Singapore this place is a Singapore institution. Every time I visit Singapore I make sure to stop by the Tanglin Club. The staff are wonderful and friendly and the service is great! Some may find the club to be old but it has a great colonial feel to it which I love! It is my home away from home
Well located colonial club,"This is a well located anachronism of a place to stay. Wonderful welcoming staff, the room was superb, very quite and clean, very nice bed, great wifi. Wonderful,sports facilities. Remember that this is a members club, and they do have rules and standards,but this added to the stay, rather that spoiled it.

The food was homely,with and they were very obliging . Great breakfast. Nice mixture of travellers and members.

Very good for shopping centre and transit."
Huge but dangerous house steak,"Ordered the daily house steak. Probably 500g. 25% was burned and inedible. 25% was pure fat so had to shear off 50% leaving 50%. Side dish was the highlight of the meal. Tasty, fragrant and colourful. House red wine was acidic. Would return but not order same item."
Fabulous colonial setting and excellent food in the centre of Singapore,"The Tanglin Club is a great institution. My wife and I paid our second visit to the Tavern and Fireplace restaurant and bar and, as always, were welcomed with friendly staff. The food is straightforward and in no way pretentious. It is also sensibly priced, as you would expect from a club. Better still, they offer good wines at sensible prices. Sadly, you cannot book a table but we have not had a problem – and you can always have a drink at the bar first. We love it!"
The Best.,"I love the Tangling Club. I cannot imagine any where better to stay in Singapore or any where else. The restaurants and bars are first class. The rooms are large and the views over the pool are lovely. The staff look after you so well, especially Mr Kuma on the front desk. I have had my best holidays here."
Colonial building with excellent food,"Well I didn't stay here but was there only for a meal. And I did sample many dishes - from malay curries to British fish and chips followed by some coffee! The food overall was excellent. It helps that I loved the ambience as well. Bit old school, colonial setting with seating that's both indoors as well as extended into a large balcony kind of an area. The service was crisp and polite. I would love to go back just for more food here but hey who knows maybe I stay here too the next time I am in singapore!"
"Lovely big room, food less interesting than it used to be","This was our first time staying in the Tanglin Club. It is in a great position, near Orchard Road, and the swimming pool and its environs are absolutely fantastic. Our room was huge, compared to a normal hotel room. The bed was also wonderfully big and very comfortable indeed. We had dinner in the ChurchIll room on Sunday evening. The restaurant was quiet, but the food was very good. My impression is that the menus in the Tavern restaurant and poolside have become much shorter, and certainly several of my old favourites no longer appear. Service in the Churchill room was very competent, but poolside was a different story. It proved quite hard to attract the attention of passing waiting staff and almost impossible to get anyone to clear up dirty dishes, which remained sitting on the side tables for an inordinately long time."
Very comfortable,"Had a pool view room which was comfortable for our family (two boys 10&8). Service is very helpful and there are various restaurant options, though there are restrictions to most for children (except Sundays). The pool is excellent and there is a nice poolside menu available. Close walk to the orchard MRT. I would stay here again, no doubt."
Enjoyed our stay,"We stayed as reciprocal members for 5 days. We only ate in the poolside restaurant and, as others reviews note, it can get crowded and the service can be slow(ish) at peak times. However the food was always excellent, the staff very friendly, and the prices very reasonable. The location of the Club is good being only a 10 minute walk to Orchard Road and the MRT (metro) station.
We would rate the Club as excellent and the poolside restaurant as very good."
Poor service,"This Christmas trip we spent in Singapore and visited 3 clubs, the service at the Tanglin was the worse. Although two staff were courteous and helpful but the rest ignored our wavings.
Chicken masala chicken vindaloo were delicious, but the service was below par.

We are now enjoying breakfast at Singapore island country club the waiters waitresses so attentive that's why we want to write to tripadvisor about the appalling service in the tanglin.
We waited for a long time for pots of hot water, there was a waiter chatting along with our next table (2 persons). He chose to ignore our waving, I waved at him, my son in law waved at him. When the pots of hot water came he didn't give it to us, he asked another waitress to give hot water to us. The club needs to train their staff"
Super Facility,"As a reciprocal member, we've stayed here many times over the years and would unreservedly recommend the club to anyone who is eligible. The facilities are generally excellent, the last upgrade to the rooms wasn't strictly needed but the results are excellent. All the dining facilities are good, the restaurant by the pool can get busy at lunchtimes. The club has managed to retain a bit of old colonial style mixed with the modern Singapore, not an easy task. If you were to stay at a hotel in the area, you would pay a huge amount more for such an establishment. There was a bit of an upheaval some months ago when some members of the committee resigned but it seems to have had no effect and the club runs as it always has done.

Two tips, ask for a room overlooking the pool and always try 'The Meat From The Wagon' at dinner, you won't be disappointed."
Famous club which perhaps lacks the ambience of the past,"This is a famous and well-situated venue offering stylish surroundings and good food and drink. We enjoyed a light lunch by the pool and, though the standard of the food was high, the atmosphere slightly lacked the elegance and magic of the past. Staff were friendly but a touch off-hand. Notwithsatnding this minor criticism, it remains a privilege to experience a brief visit to the Tanglin Club"
Popular private club,"This is well-patronized by members. The dining hall looks faintly Olde English, and is quite large. On a Tuesday evening it was just packed, and there was a constant turnover of tables.
Our food was good, typical for a private club with a bit of everything, designed to satisfy an appetite rather than make a culinary statement.
If a member should ever invite you, you'll have a good, hearty meal and friendly service."
"Food is great and it's ok to stay for a short period, but whoa if u decide to linger...","The food at the Tanglin Club is good in general, and if you stay here for a short period to enjoy the facilities etc.,it's comfortably enjoyable, BUT if you decide to join as a member or linger, be aware that this club has many rules and regulations and it can get quite unfriendly, as the members are generally old and grumpy.(literally)
AND will have no qualms about calling security on you to enforce such petty rules such as having a collared shirt at the reading room.
There is much politicking to be enjoyed as a member of this club, so if you desire to stay clear, look elsewhere to join as a member. There is a bald old time staff who goes around ensuring rules are followed are this gentleman should have been sacked long time ago, as he is rude and devisive."
