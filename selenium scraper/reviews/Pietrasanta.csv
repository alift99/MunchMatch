Authentic Italian cuisine,"Excellent service, delicious food, authentic Italian cuisine. The pasta and pizza is a must try. The lamb shark could be better. The steak was great. The Tiramisu is fantastic. Will visit again."
Wonderful Italian,"Wonderful, authentic, unpretentious Italian - lovely evening, warm service - started with the Burrata special, followed by the penne special and a pizza. Also a fantastic bottle of wine picked from their cellar"
First time visit let down by AC duct over table,"We had a lunch over the week end.
Nice ambience , bright place with cozy interior.
Food was great or as nice as most Tuscany menus go.
However, do avoid table number 8.
The AC duct blows directly over the table and within minutes any hot beverage or food turns cold.
Worth a return visit for dinner maybe.
Overall 3/5"
10/10 authentic ITALIANO food,100/100 food i would defo go again for the food. Worth every penny. Prompt and polite service from the team. Thanks for the brilliant food
"Charming Tuscany, at Fusionopolis","A very nice charming Italian restaurant in that area, with alfresco dining too. The overall look and feel is very charming and chic too . Lovely ambience

The staff was very attentive and service was prompt, I was impressed.

I love the choice of items on the menu. The ciabatta bread was soft yet crunchy and fresh.

The pasta with the pesto sauce, was fantastic !!! So was the sirloin steak !!

My linguine Vongole was simply divine !!! That sauce in there had great depths and flavours that soaked up the pasta !! The clams were fresh and yum too

As with every Italian restaurant I go to for the first time , I must always try their Tiramisu for dessert. It’s freshly made and very very nice :-))"
3 visits in 2 weeks,"A few impressions I have by trying different menu items in lunch and dinner with a group of company staffs, business associates and family: 1. Wonderful bread/pizza remind us of our days in Europe. 2. Rich flavors especially cheeses balanced with vinegar satisfying my palate for strong flavors without much salt. Black truffle and cheese pizza was split with the other half with real meat cuts. Special pasta with meats and mushroom has the richness hard to forget. 3. Sublime cheesecake with vinegar is perfect. I had it twice in lunch and dinner. The traditional Italian cheesecake is not too sweet unlike the American version. Vinegar adds the extra flavors to stimulate my sense without making it too rich so I am encouraged to keep eating. 4. The portion is large so the initial perception of the higher price is justified. E.g. in the company dinner I ordered a cod fish and it’s a big piece. My staff ordered a pork ribs that was huge even for a young man. 5. The lunch and dinner time even during pandemic is full of people. The waiters are knowledgeable and helpful but are too busy to maintain attentions."
Expected more..,"Visited at their new premise in Fusionolopolis, dined at the alfresco area, the place is quiet and nice.
Service is kind and fast, nothing to say.
Food wise, I was a bit disappointed, I talk for what we tried:
- pici al sugo di quaglia cacio e pepe: for 29 SGD the quantity of pasta was ridiculous. I don't love the huge portions, but here at least 2 more forkfuls were welcome. Maybe they did a mistake?
- pizza is nothing special, moreover it was burned, thing that spoiled the taste of it.
- tiramisu: 16 sgd, definitively overpriced.
Conclusion: for the price paid, I am a bit disappointed. Not sure I will come back again."
Dine at your own risk.,"Lousy service, food is overpriced and average. Not value for money. Restaurant is hot like sauna. 1 of the worse restaurant."
A visit to Pietrasanta on a quiet Sunday,"An unexpected find in the business district in the west area at Fusionpolis.
It was not so packed the afternoon I visited. The restaurant has 2 birthday celebrations that time. Seems like a nice place for group gathering. It has a patio for those who like the alfresco feel.

Food wise, I ordered the crab ravioli. It was simply amazing! I can't say more.

Worth a try!"
New premises at Fusionopolis,"They have shifted from their lovely rustic and bucolic Portsdown Rd premises (where they have been located for more than a decade) to the commercial urban hub of bustling Fusionopolis. A bit of a jarring change for someone like me who was so used to the leafy surroundings of their previous location, where they were somewhat of an institution there. But they are nonetheless doing pretty well at their present location, due to the huge captive lunch market at the Fusionopolis complex. It is very easy to access via the MRT. I was there for a business lunch and it was an obvious decor change due to its location within the site at the Fusionopolis building itself. Their new premises are more modern and much brighter with more glass windows all round and an altogether more buzzing hip type of vibe (compared to their old restaurant which had a definite countryside feel to it). The food though remains very much the same : excellent authentic classic Tuscan dishes faithful to the original Pietrasanta. The starter of salad and burrata cheese was very good , and the pasta main course was as fabulous as it has always been. Good and reassuring to know that the quality of the food remains very much unchanged, as well as the staff, despite the new location. The packed lunch room attests to its continued popularity......long may it live in this new locale as it is the only really authentic high end Italian restaurant in this part of town."
Still A Friend Of Mine,"My first visit to Pietrasanta since it moved from the charming black and white colonial building to its current location bolted onto the side of a shopping centre.

The charm and non pretentious decadence is still there, helped by familiar smiling staff. The menu is very similar with some new inclusions (because you have to).

Food is still as authentic and rustic as before. The simple grilled squid with olive oil has been removed, which is a shame. It has been replaced with a squid salad which doesnt work as well.

It was nice to come back to Pietrasanta. A little slither of Tuscany surrounded by concrete and glass.

P.S Eat inside."
Phone reservation not captured,"Called on 24 Nov late afternoon to make a dinner reservation for 23 Dec dinner. My 2 friends were with me when I made the call. We showed up today and there was no reservation!!! Unfortunately I forgot the name of person I spoke with.
Not funny when one came from Changi, one from Tampines, one from Eunos - vis public transport."
Tasty authentic Italian food,Tasty authentic Italian food. Truly warm atmosphere. Great wines. Very good experience. We recommend.
"Nice ambience, good service","The staff are very mannerly and courteous.
The restaurant atmosphere is very relaxing, although we visited at a non-peak hour.
We ordered lasagne, which could have been a little hotter. The fettuccine was nice and the pizza was so-so. Found the desserts a little overpriced... $15.90 for that amount of tiramisu just isn’t worth it."
"Better location, same good food and less cosy/romantic ambience","The restaurant has shifted to Fusionopolis Way which is reachable via mrt and ample proper parking lots. Quality of food was as good as previous. Ambience wise was not as cosy/romantic as before. Nevertheless, we still get to enjoy our favorite T-bone and desserts. Service was good too."
Casual Italian,The new location is near At Connexion South near the taxi stand. The decoration is more modern but not as cosy as before. The food generally tasted good but it’s a bit noisy.
Great food and nice ambience,"Food is delicious, and location is quite scenic. Staff is quite helpful as well. Would recommend for a romantic date :)"
good italian but location is remote,was there recently for my daughter birthday. food is good and our server Alex is friendly and approachable. I would recommend the T bone steak and truffle pasta. the tiramisu also good.
Great food,"Food is delicious, ambience is great. Not for couples cos it gets pretty noisy inside. But very suitable for a bunch of friends to meet up over good authentic Italian food and wine. It’s quite expensive - not your regular hangout place.
It’s a little off the beaten path cos it’s at portsdown but that adds to the entire ambience. Hence only accessible by car or taxi. Parking is available so no worries."
Wonderful dining experience,"A very unique dining experience. This quaint restaurant in a very peaceful part of the city offers a great collection of wines, al fresco dining, efficient service and good food. The menu could use some reimagining though, with more options especially for vegetarians. Have spotted a few lizards on the walls - something the restaurant should address."
Great dinner in a lovely setting,"We sat outside originally but as the rain got heavier we decided to move inside.

The indoor decor was cosy and warm. The service was very good overall with clear explanation of specials of the day.

We decided to try out the “tonno di chianti” which is a pork dish served cold in olive oil with a few bruschetta. It was different but tasty. However, it was also quite heavy (and we shared it between the two of us) so I wasn’t as hungry once we finished it.

I had the spaghetti frutti di mare which was beautiful. So much seafood and the pasta was well cooked and seasoned. I enjoyed it a lot. We also had the Pietrasanta pizza which had sliced beef on it. We wouldn’t usually go for beef on top of pizza but we were intrigued as it’s called Pietrasanta.

The pizza did taste wonderful. The cheese and the dough both were delicious. How we, if we return again, I doubt if we would have this pizza again.

We finished off the meal with the cheese cake with balsamic vinegar. One piece was enough for 2 to share. It was light and tasty.

All in all, we had a wonderful dinner here and are talking about what we would order when we return next time!"
Dont go,"Simple Sunday lunch ruined by poor food.

Linguine vongole is a staple Italian dish. Ordered it as it was a suggested pasta 'special', too bad there was sand in it. The presence of single clam shells should have warned me of what was in the sauce!

We also ordered grilled barramundi, specifically asking for the cream sauce to be on the side. The fish came swimming in the sauce, and the skin completely burnt.

We asked to speak with the manager. He or she did not have the courtesy to meet us.

The main courses took 30 minutes after the starter to arrive.

My first and definitely last visit"
Lovely Italian,Had a lovely lunch here - service and the quality of the food we're both fantastic would highly recommend as an option for a nice quiet lunch
A nice italian away from Busy center.,Very nice cosy place (15 min away from city centre) great outside seating in front and even better at the back. Nuce choice Fantastic pasta. (Fettucini with italian sausage and truffles) Large selection of wine at every price Could improve the desert menu.
Excellent,"Totally recommend for family friends or business, menu is excellent, select your wine from the cellar and get advice from the manager, we took his advice for the wine and the food and had a great evening,Fabulous food, highly recommend the linguine with spicy sausage and truffle. Everyone enjoyed there meal. Wine and service excellent also, will definitely be back"
Authentic Italian,"Cosy, quaint and casual restaurant away from the hustle and bustle of the city in the quiet surbabia of Portsdown Road. It’s very popular so reservations are highly encouraged. We were a party of 8 and so took seats outdoors. It was surprisingly cool and windy.
The appetisers were good esp the burrito salad, the sautéed mushrooms and the sautéed clams. The freshly baked focaccia was excellent and we managed to work our way through a double serving!
The seafood spaghetti, risotto mushroom and squid ink Bolognese were decent mains but do leave space for the excellent desserts - melting chocolate cake, cheesecake and tiramisu in that ranked order."
Comfort food and good service,"This was my second visit following a great experience some months earlier and I was not disappointed.

We ordered the grilled squid, clams (which was off the menu), squid ink pasta, focaccia bread, and the roasted deboned organic spring chicken, and they were all excellent!

The two little ones were whining as they were hungry (that’s for not listening to Papa and having their egg for breakfast!) and the staff obliged with some bread quickly.

The focaccia bread was fresh and the girls loved dipping it in the tomato-based dip.

The squid was tender and went well with the salad. The girls weren’t in the mood for it so the Wife and I happily gobbled it up.

My elder girl loves clams and it was really good. The accompanying sauce was so light and delicious we were all dipping our bread in it. I even scooped up the sauce with a spoon and drank it on its own. Lovely!

The chicken was delicious and it being mostly boneless helped as far as feeding the two young ones was concerned. We all loved the flavour and taste of the chicken which was moist and tender.

The pasta was really good too but the girls were so full of bread and chicken they could finish their share. I gratefully mopped up.

Co-owner, Giuseppe, one half of a two-Brother team, recommended a Ripasso which was delicious! What pleases me most was seeing my Wife enjoy it as much as I. Giuseppe even stopped by to chat and I learnt that he gave his restaurant the name of his hometown.

Service is attentive and prompt.

Our meal cost us $270 with the wine costing about $120, so it was a treat but money well spent for the quality of food, cooking, wine and service.

A thoroughly enjoyable meal and I’ll be back!"
Best Italian vegetarian food!,"Pleasantly surprised to find a vegetarian Italian with superb selection of finest food. This was a perfect choice to bring my family from the uk visiting for dinner.

Chef Carlos is a fantastic passionate chef who brings Italy to Singapore! He can tailor anything on the menu to your preference and rustle something up that isn’t on the menue. The quality of ingredients really shows in the taste making this place one of my favourite worldwide.

I absolutely love the rustic look and feel of the restaurant which is a hidden gem, located outside the hustle and bustle of the city.

Highly recommend!"
Farewell Lunch,Went with a group of colleagues to this little gem near our office for a farewell lunch. For starters we had burrata and calamari which both were superb! We ordered pasta and everyone cleared their dishes clean ... and of course to end it off desserts definitely a must!!! Second time here and definitely will return again one evening to enjoy cheese and wine somehow everyone was so excited about the food that we didn’t take any pics as we were busy digging in
Reliably consistent good Tuscan fare,"It’s a family favourite and yet not one we go so frequently. Maybe because it’s always busy. Maybe its rustic setting is somewhat at odds with the closer to expensive dining pricing. Still every time we come back we always wonder why don’t go back more often. And it’s always packed.

Owned and run by 2 brothers looking after front and back, a new partner has joined the scene. Nothing to worry about. Everything still the same high quality - both food and service. Old favourites are tripe stew, clams in tomato and wine sauce, steaks, beef cheeks, buffalo sausage meat pasta etc. Risotto and Pizzas also good. Burrata good for sharing is served with rocket and cherry plum tomatos. Freshly baked bread to order if there’s a hungry table otherwise standard bread basket is pretty good. Frito misto or any of the lightly battered seafood are also worth a try. We normally order and just share all across the table if there’s enough of us.

Desserts wise, the Tuscan chocolate pistocchi is great amongst a decent desert offering.

Wine cellar has nice selection and we’ve bought to take away. As we did their premium olive oil."
Fantastic food and wine list!,"Absolutely love Pietrasanta. There's this rustic Italian feel. The table, the tables, the wood and the wine- it's like a little Italian oasis. Highly recommend the eggplant parmigiana, the pizzas, the burrata and the great wines. I love the reds on the menu. Save room for dessert! Homemade plates of pasta- perfect for brunch. Love Pietrasanta!"
Really worth a try,"The menu is not too big, and the daily specials take it to another level. I think with so many specials, if you could just list them down for us - we are not as good as you are at remembering them all.
The food is very good, the staff and service is excellent. Home made pastas teamed with old fashioned accompaniments.
Cocktails could be presented better and wine option by the glass is just okay.
A very good restaurant, and really worth a try. We liked it a lot. Sunday lunch."
Authentic Italian,"Came here for business lunch meeting. Restaurant was a retrofit from the old colonial house. Some parkings lot available but limited. The Italian food is pretty authentic especially on the burrata cheese, salad and Parma ham. This is a dish that you could tell the authenticity of an Italian cuisine. Ordered the pasta, grilled sea bass and stewed beef cheek and both are really good. The service is attentive despite quite a lunch crowd today. The ambience is great despite a bit warm during the lunch time. There’s outdoor seating with alfresco seating. Good for both business and personal eating place. A bit too noisy if you are sitting at the open airing area as the echo could be quite bad to hear someone talking opposite you."
Good food!,"We were invited to a birthday dinner at the La Bussolo of Pietrasanta. Food is yummy. We especially like the Linguine Sea Urchin and Angus T-bone. We had a private room to ourselves. There were other tables outside in the open served from the same kitchen and staff. Staff went in and out of the room to serve patrons outside. Rather disruptive to us in the inside especially when friends started giving speeches, the door kept opening and close with staff moving around serving other guests outside. Guests outside would also come through the room to access the washroom. Not a really conducive place for private function but still a pleasant place for fine dining. It opens till quite late. We left after 11:30pm."
Good food and service with a smile,"Visited this nice italian place for dinner. Good food, fresh and well made.
Burrata was very good. A bit pricy but worth it.
Rack of lamb very nice and reasonable. A good portion well cooked. Pork Chop good but cannot compare to the lamb.
Everyone should try the cheese cake to finish off a good meal.
Should try this place for some good food."
Good for pasta not pizza,"This authentic ristorante is run by Italians.

Their pizza not Naples style.

Many hand-made pasta. My fettuccine was delicious.

The cheesecake with 20 year old balsamic was delicious but at $19 too expensive even for me!

There is Brunello by the glass.

Worth a visit.
Not sure if it is worth a repeat visit."
Birthday Dinner,We went here for the first time to celebrate a birthday having been recommended the place by friends. We really enjoyed the meal and the service and hope to return. The antipasto was excellent - very fresh and tasty. Pasta and pizzas for main course excellent. Good value for the quality of the food
Yummy Italian,"Casual cozy warm Italian restaurant in the middle of nowhere (Grab driver couldn't find it) BUT the food is yummy. We didn't get our burrata (off season it seems) but the fried parma ham cheese made up for it. The other starters we had were not very memorable but the mains were superb. I loved my truffles carbonara pasta and my friends' cod and pork looked and tasted divine. The portions were also huge and good for sharing.

Service was warm and friendly. Will come back again (if my Grab driver can find it :))"
Will return. Good Tuscan fare.,"We were a group of 12, so we sampled quite a few dishes. There were no complaints.

They started us off with shots of gazpacho (on the house). We had a few starters to share:
- Melanzane alla Parmigiana - among one of the better ones I’ve had in Singapore
- the humble Calamari Fritti, which was lightly battered and flavourful
- Focaccia - what can I say, it’s bread.

I had the grilled cod with roasted potatoes as my main. The cod was good, the potatoes were better - nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

Also tried the pizza. A good size (enough for two to share if you’re having starters), though the dough was a bit heavy for my liking.

Prices are a little steep for daily dining but fine for business lunches. Good service. Will be back to sample more from their sizeable menu."
Super area,Sunny during the day and cold in the night. Nice views with mountains and clear hot water very good for swimming especially for children. In week end fishing is forbitten.
Outstanding Italian food in Singapore,"Of all Singapore’s attractions,
(And the attractions are good!),
The one that I like the best
Is the amazing variety of food.

There’s British food you can get in a pub,
And every sort of Asian grub,
There are all great, but if you really want a
Classic Italian, try Pietrasanta.

For pasta or Pesci, suppa or meats,
The menu is full of culinary feats,
There’s a fabulous wine list and then you will see a
Beer to excite you - the great Menabrea!

The veranda was cool to sample our feast,
In this Italian taverna, transported out East.
The service was splendid, the prices were fair,
We were so glad that we ended up there!"
Charming and rustic,"This is a spacious rustic relaxing informal dining place with many car park spaces. The service was good, and the food acceptable . Altogether a pleasant dining experience. Many tables were celebrating birthdays that evening. The appetisers were good - Squid salad, burratta, tomatoes n prosciutto, and grilled vegetables. The bistecca Florentina was the fattest I had ever seen, so by the time we had removed the huge amounts of fat layers, there was little left to eat. The mixed seafood pasta was moist and served hot with a lot of sauce, but not interesting to the tastebuds. The desserts were good - Panacotta a tad bit too sweet, and tiramisu a good balance. If you can take the humidity, sitting alfresco can be charming."
Awesome food and service,"Loved the atmosphere, food and staff were the best! Food was so yummilicious and authentic Italian! Loved it! We had so much food and honestly could not fault any of them. Will definitely be back for another visit."
A little hidden gem,"After nearly 4 years in Singapore I have never visited this little Italian gem before. And wow, I have been missing out!
A lovely Saturday evening, started with cold cuts and cheese, then ossobucco with risotto and finished off with panna cotta.
The Panna cotta is probably one of the best I have ever tasted!"
"Nice atmosphere, average food","Atmosphere was upbeat, full house inside & outside. Staff were helpful.

Mains was mediocre. Four-cheese pizza was bland & dough not completely cooked through. Cod fish texture was cooked well, not over- or undercooked, but zero taste.

Dessert was a panna cotta & it was tasty.

Drinks were decent enough in size & taste.

Would I return? No."
Nice Lunch Venue,"A nice secluded place with excellent service and very good Italian food! Pleasant to sit on the verandah, alfresco. The sole was filetted to perfection! They serve pretty quickly and the waiting staff is pleasant & courteous. Should visit for dinner too."
Best Italian restaurants in Singapore?,"I live in Singapore and used to live near Pietra Santa, so I used to go there all the time. I went last week for the first time in about a year. I had forgotten what a great restaurant it is. While it is not inexpensive, it is not much more than Jamie's Italian, but it is a whole different league in terms of quality. The menu is quite extensive, as is the wine list, and the food is excellent, whether it is the pasta, the excellent pizza, or the more substantial meat courses. The jumbo steak Florentina is outstanding, although to be fair, it is pretty expensive. They have a little wine room with a great selection, and great after dinner drinks. The service is also friendly and efficient , and it has a country Italian ambiance that is welcoming and cozy, rather than formal and stuffy. Exactly my kind of place... I will be going back soon."
Dinner for 2,"The place has a good vibe and excellent staff, the staff were knowledgeable and attentive but not overly so that you feel uncomfortable. I had the Pappardelle con Ragù Chiantigiano, the sauce was lovely but the pasta was a little on the dry side I felt. This was I felt a letdown. My wife had the vongole and it was enjoyable with the plump clams tasting nice and fresh. The dish of the day for us both was the Burrata, at 300grams this dish could have fed 3! It was one of the best I have had locally for some time. For dessert we shared the dark chocolate cake, and it was lovely."
Lovely evening with comforting service at Pietrasanta...,"It had been quite a long awhile since I stepped into Pietrasanta. As I was nearby, I decided to drop in for dinner. As I did not have any reservation, I settled for an outdoor table.

It turned out to be one of my most comforting evenings this year, and I cannot emphasize enough that it was down to Guna. Guna was running the floor that night.

My guests and I were (very) well attended to from the moment we sat down. The wine recommended (without being pushy) was to our liking and our food/dietary restrictions were heartily negotiated. We paid the price for being too enthusiastic with our appetites by having to pack our left over wine and pizza home.

Still we were embraced by the calm presence of Guna throughout the night. His wide and energetic smile never left his face. His service was passionate to all around, despite him having to run around tirelessly on a humid night. My humble cup of tap water never ran dry and Guna insisted that everyone had their plates changed for each course.

He would be the main reason for my subsequent returns to Pietrasanta.

Thank you Guna Ji!"
Great food though noisy,"Visited on a Sunday evening and was quite surprised that it was full.

The burrata was a bit disappointing- seemed not to be that fresh. The sea bass though was excellent. Wonderfully grilled - light and delicious.

The cod was also very good and the roast chicken was average."
Great lunch spot,"Always fantastic Italian food, wine and service. Great spot sitting on the verandah having Sunday lunch in the tropics. Must do on the bucket list"
Disappointed,"We went to a party at their La Bussola and the food was amazing, so we decided to go to Pietrasanta for valentines dinner and were really disappointed. I love eating and the experience was so sad. We ordered the antipasto misto toscano and the cold cuts were ok but the olives were horrible, somehow they marinated in a weird way they were sweet. Looked like canned black olives of the cheapest quality. The bread was nice. Then my husband ordered the fettuccine con salsiccia & tartufo nero, it was only ok but not tasty. I ordered the gnocchi gorgonzola & noci and was so disgusting I couldn’t finish it. It looked like cream thickened with cornstarch and 2 little crumbles of cheese (literally). Completely tasteless. We didn’t dare trying any desserts. The organic wine was good. Definitely we will not go back."
Excellent Italian Food but the acoustics inside is terrible,"I decided to try this place after good reviews from my friends.

Let me tell you, the food and service is excellent. It's classic Italian food that matches the quality in Italy.

I had the lasagna and it was so creamy and tart at the same time. I also had the truffle fetucine and it tasted so yummy. You will not be disappointed by the food.

However, the location isn't that great especially if you don't drive and I would recommend that you sit outside because the acoustics inside is terrible. You can't really have a decent conversation inside."
Homely Italian cooking,"Ristorante Pietrasanta located at 5B Portsdown Road, Singapore .There are many fine Italian restaurants in Singapore, Pietrasanta restaurant has to be one of them. The rustic homey interior is an ideal getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city to enjoy homely Italian cooking .it is a family business run by 2 Italian brothers, inspired by the quaint simplicity of the town of Pietrasanta in Tuscany, Italy. It’s focused on an authentic Tuscan dining cuisine, that one can expect fresh and delicious Italian fare. The food here is amazing, better than most Italian restaurants in Italy. The food prices aren't unreasonable. All The food that we tried were all really tasty, and Very well presented and nice portions, seasoned and cooked to perfection. One dish that really stand out it’s the handmade square pasta with lobster sauce, it was to die for. About the Service and atmosphere also get really high marks! Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night, beautiful ambience and gorgeous food. Would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will be back. I truly recommend this place if you want high quality Northern Italian cuisine."
Best Italian,"Reservations a must. However in the rainy period, seemed less crowded than usual. Great food, we shared a pasta and beef and they were divine! The portions were split in the kitchen. Prosecco was good too. Service is always responsive."
Nice Authentic Italian Food,"A bit far from city center but its worth it. Food n drinks are amazing n very Italian. The staff and service are very good, they are very friendly."
Special Evening,"I would like to thank Niccolo and the staff of Pietrasanta for an wonderful evening. We had reserved their private room, La Bussola, to celebrate our 20th anniversary with our friends. The food was the one of the best Italian we've had in Singapore. Their buffalo mozzarella was fresh and delicious. The serving portions were sufficient for all our guests. The tiramisu just melted in our mouths.
They had plenty of choices for wine.
Impeccable service and excellent food. We will definitely recommend this restaurant for any occasion."
Excellent Italian Food,Italian food at its best. Great quality food match with attentive and friendly service. Try the homemade pasta with homemade sausage. Salads and pizza are also very good. Nice selection of wine. Try the Amarone and Barolo.
Shocking service and dessert quality,"he starters and main courses were good but I was shocked by the service and poor quality of the desserts. The owner whom I initially thought was the manager agreed to help me place a birthday candle on one of the desserts I ordered as I forgot to buy the cake for the birthday celebration. He agreed but it never came. The desserts were plonked on the table -vanilla ice-cream that sounded like ice when you knock a spoon on it. The dark chocolate cake was so thin it is seriously should be described as a tart. Finally after requesting for a candle again, the waiter stuck a candle on a plate with 4 awful chocolates which we left behind. MOST SHOCKINGLY - the bill came back without our visa card and the waiter whom we informed took so long to get back we thought they lost the card. The restaurant is under-staffed and for the amount they charge - it is disrespectful to the diners."
Authentic food from Tuscany,Amazing burrata and grilled calamari Great service! We were on a business dinner and the waiters were able to serve us food and wine without letting anybody wait. Will come back again!
Sumptuous Italian hospitality,I was taken here by a visiting Italian and some others who dine there regularly. We were welcomed like family and had a wonderful meal. The atmosphere is informal and festive - not at all stuffy - but the food is superb. Worth a visit.
"Food is good, but...","Burrata cheese with the ham, rocket and tomato plate were very nice. The foccacia was great too. The (prosciutto e porcini) pizza was very nice as well. However, the spaghetti (ai fruti di mare) was a little bit too hard to our taste.
Outdoor seating is just not recommended at all. Ants just never stopped visiting the plates from the ceiling. Mosquitoes are fighting for your blood."
Best burrata!!,"The first time I dined in this restaurant, i was introduced to the burrata and I got hooked! The burrata is served with rockets, tomatoes and some Prosciutto. The taste of their burrata is very refreshing. This is their specialty and it’s not on the menu. The portion is good for 2 people. We usually order a burrata and a main like pizza. Very fulfilling lunch

Highly recommended burrata. I like their service as well. Attentive servers"
OOh yeah,The burrata salami rocket salad is very good compliments to the Chef The truffle pasta is my preferred dish with the sliced beef. Relaxed and calm atmosphere which is perfect way to unwind after a busy day
Lovely meal!,"We were a party of 6. We ordered a few appertizers to share. grilled squid , clams in tomato based soup were excellent. Fried squid too salty we did not finish it. Pizza was good too. I love the complimentary thin bread so crispy n warm from the oven! We ordered 2 prosecco (reasonably priced n very good) n 1 red wine (though a little pricey but worth the price it was excellent). The meals came up to less than S$600 which I think with the amount of food n drinks plus we had tea n coffee after the meal was reasonably priced. Is out of the way but is worth the trip there. very rustic setting. Will go back again."
Really good authentic Italian,"Highly recommended from a friend of friend. Some of them would even drive down from Malaysia to Singapore just to have this. The staffs were very friendly. We had a chunky tomato soup and the best grilled squid salad I ever had! The grilled squid was juicy and tender, not rubbery, served on top of balanced dressed arugula and cherry tomatoes. For mains we had spinach ravioli in butter sage sauce, tagliatelle with black truffle pate, and the house signature Pietrasanta pizza. The ravioli was good, the black truffle pate was heavenly! The pizza was just average. Overall, we had a very pleasant dining experience. Will definitely come back again for the squid and black truffle pate!"
Always consistent always superb 👌🏻,We visit pretty often and never once were we disappointed. Excellent food ! Great service! Great for lunch or dinner - in this heat you may want to book a table inside.
"Nice Atmosphere, Great Food","Pietrasanta is a great dinner spot. The owners often stop by our table to say hello. Their personal touch adds to the ambiance. The entire menu is fantastic. Some of my family's go-to dishes include the burrata appetizer, black truffle and sausage pasta, the black cabbage appetizer, and the cod. Enjoy!"
"Exquisite Italian cuisine, excellent choice for business and leisure","Having lived in Rome, Italy in 1964-1966, I was introduced to this restaurant by my Singapore friend and his family.
We were welcomed by our host Lucca and hostess Priscilla, and entertained by them with their famous bread and buratta cheese and prosciutto, excellent wine choices, and an unforgettable main dish of lamb and beef grill.
All of this accentuated by a quite environment, with a colonial sphere.
I would not hesitate to start planning my next visit ..."
Very expensive for a casual dining experience,"It used to be a great place to hang out with a bunch of friends over buratta, pizza and wine. That was the experience we went for to have a casual dinner. But now we need to think twice because they have really jacked up their pricing. We spent $200 for 2 adults and 2 kids with just 2 glasses of wine.
The buratta and pizza is still great but not worth the $$$"
Best Burrata Cheese,It has been our Italian fix for years. They have best burrata cheese with tomatoes and rocket leaves! Of coz it doesn't hurt to have Parma ham with it as well! Beef Tenderloin is very good too. I mostly eat seafood pasta in tomatoes spicy sauce. It's always a pleasure to end the meal with ice cream..
Attitude...,I've been coming to this restaurant for a long time and loved it. Tonite I gave feedback on the unacceptable conditions of the toilets and this was shrugged off. Hygiene is everything.
Great food and ambience!,Had dinner last Saturday and the place was packed. The decor gives the place a nice rustic feel and the food and service was outstanding. Well recommended but please book early as this place is always busy!
Awesome Italian Cuisine,"Went there on a sunday for lunch . Cosy location and great food . Fresh and tasty ingredients. We had the ravioli con burrata , it was awesome . The tomato sauce was incredibly good. Pizza are also delicious. Good value for money .
We will go back for sure."
A big Disappointment,"Recommended to us as a good Italian restaurant, I'm afraid it did not come up to expectations. Certainly, the staff were pleasant and helpful and seated us outside as the weather was so warm. We started off with an aperitif and then ordered our food.. I fancied Ministrone Soup which said on the menu that it was thick - it was like water with a few peas floating on the top. I then had Spaghetti which had a few minute prawns , mussels
and maybe a few cockles in the tomato sauce. We couldn't face the dessert, had a coffee and left. We liked the location, staff, but oh dear, the food........"
Two stars: service terrible,"The PLACE: very charming and warm.
The FOOD: not great.
The Seafood pasta - seafood completely deshelled, pre-made hours ago so seafood is tough, and sauce not as tasty as many other places I have been in Singapore (La braceria)
The pizza: ok but not as good as many other places I have been (Cicheti)
The calamari grilled: very good.

SERVICE: TERRIBLE. They gave us a dirty spoon for my son gelato!!! They got the order wrong for my son's pizza. First course and main courses all arrived together at the same time.

This place is highly overrated now. It used to be much better. Now it is very disappointing."
"Excellent, always delivers","I have been going to Pietrasanta since they opened 8+ years ago. Food is always delicious, their service is attentive and they will go off the book to cater to your tastes."
Hit and miss,Had dinner with a few friends. The burrata was excellent. Creamy and rich and it went well with the tomatoes and rocket. The barramundi I had for my main course was average at best. My wife's fettuccine with pork sausage was not bad but not great and a little salty. Service was excellent though and extremely pleasant and efficient throughout the night.
Easter lunch,"As usual a perfect Italian restaurant. The best burrata in town and wonderful taste on all foods, either pasta, meat or fish. Good place for celebrations. And last, dogs friendly !"
Casual Italian Trattoria,One of the authentic Italian trattoria in Singapore. Located in a black and white colonial house inside the forest. Good selection of dishes and good wine selection. Has become one of my weekly restaurants
Great,"Burrata, Risotto, chocolate cake, Service, lovely outdoor and indoor setting, customization!!!👍🏼👍🏼👌🏼"
Great service! Great food!,Have been here 4 times and not once disappointed with service or food! Great place for family dinners or just to catch up with friends.
"Lovely dinner, great mozzarella!","Went here tonight with my husband and two children, 2 & 5 years old. It was lovely, the food was great, especially the mozzarella (and I've had a lot, my husband's Italian) and the beef cheeks with mash were lovely (but could have done with something green like beans or spinach).
The service was top notch and very efficient and accommodating."
Great service and burrata,"Was here last December for department lunch in order to finish our allocated annual department staff bonding budget before the year ends.

Location is out of the way though there's a public SBS bus stop right outside the 1 way main road. We drove here and there were around 5-6 parking lots in front of the restaurant though many other cars had parked parallel to the parking lots.

We had made a reservation and they had arranged a long row of table for the 12 of us. The 7 of us from one end shared the following dishes:-
1. Burrata with parma ham, Italian tomatoes and rocket salad (dish and price both not indicated on menu)
2. Fettuccine con salsiccis e tartufo (aka fettuccine with hand made pork sausage and black truffle) - S$27.90
3. Tartufo nero (aka pizza with mozzarella cheese, black truffle and truffle oil) - S$24.90
4. Tagliata di filetto alla griglia (aka grilled angus tenderloin with parmesan cheese, tomatoes and rocket salad) - S$35.90
5. Merluzzo al forno con vino bianco, olive nere e pomodorini (aka cod fish with white wine, black olives, rosemary and Italian tomatoes) - S$35.90

Instead of the standard bread basket and olive oil dips one will be served upon seating, we were served toasted pizza-like-dough and salsa sauce. These were so delicious that any carbo conscious dieter will throw away the diet just for this basket! I can definitely eat these on its own as a main dish!

The server recommended us the burrata with parma ham, fettuccine con salsiccis e tartufo and tartufo nero.

The first dish was the burrata with parma ham, italian tomatoes and rocket salad, which the server kindly helped to apportion and served them into 7 sets. He brought out a different bottle of extra virgin olive oil and recommended us to eat with this instead. I am not a cheese person and was a little hesitant when I saw that blob of burrata. However, it was not cloying and all the ingredients blended well with it. Also another dish I can eat it as a main dish instead.

The fettuccine con salsiccis e tartufo was visually interesting as I was expecting to see sliced sausages. Instead, it was minced pork. Even though we shared this (and I tried this the last), I felt the dish was a little heavy perhaps from combination of the sausage, black truffle oil and fettuccine).

The tartufo nero looks simple with just mozzarella cheese, black truffle and truffle oil. It was not too greasy though there was truffle oil and I did wonder why they needed it since there was already black truffle on it. I guess the truffle oil was to enhance the smell of the truffle. This was not too bad - one can easy devour the entire pizza without feeling stuffed and sinful.

I had ordered the tagliata di filetto alla griglia and requested for it to be medium well done. However the server recommended it to be done medium rare instead though I explained that I don't like the taste of blood or rawness in my beef. He ensured that there will not be the taste of rawness in it. The angus steak was lightly seasoned with salt and pepper. When I sliced it through, the steak was pinkish in the centre and the blood was oozing out. Taste wise, it did not blow me away as I had expected to be. The meat was grainy with lots of fibrous texture like. I was pretty disappointed with this dish and forced myself to swallow it.

The cut of the cod fish was cod fillet steak but there was a distinct fishy smell (I am very taste and smell sensitive to fish. I do know this cod was not fresh).

The restaurant was around 80% packed for a Thursday lunch and the ambience is not conductive for dates or business lunches as we had to speak quite loudly to hear one another despite us being seated close to each other.

It was raining heavily half way through our lunch and was surprised to discover that the restaurant does provide huge umbrellas at the entrance for patrons to get to their cars."
Good food but seafood pasta to improve,"We started with a very good and fresh rucola Salad. Very fresh indeed!
We had 3 mains:
- The grilled sole fish which was very well executed
- Penne with bolognese sauce was really good as well and well al dente; however
- The seafood spaghetti were disappointing. The sauce was pre made and although it was tasty, you could tell it was not a freshly executed dish...

Overall I would try it again but the seafood pasta is a no."
Nice Italian food at Portsdown road,"Restaurant is nested in idyllic surroundings of Wessex Estate, accessible by car. Great food and excellent service."
Good food with relaxed atmosphere,"Solid food, greenery, good service and relaxed atmosphere. Great place for family dinner or dinner with friends. Seating options both inside and outside. Great selection of dishes, fresh pasta. Excellent opportunity to relax."
"Delicious Italian food, relaxing vibe","I enjoyed my visit to Pietrasanta which had a nice relaxing vibe and great service staff. The food was good too. I had the lemon sole which was a special of the day - the fish was moist and tasty. My friend had the guinea fowl pasta which was also a special of the day and the dish was flavourful. We also placed an advanced order for their burrata and foccacia which served as a great appetizer. The burrata came with some prosciutto, tomatoes and rocket. Portsdown Road is not the easiest place to get to without a car or taxi, but it's well worth the journey if you want to get away from the crowds."
"""Another level""","Family enjoyed dinner en famille with osso bucco over risotto, steamed clams, pizza = half tartuffo nero and half pietrasanta and squid ink pasta w red sauce.
My nephew says its a whole new level in Italian food in Singapore
They were crowded and service was haphazard, forgot our antipasto misto! But we didnt need it.
Its crowded, its noisy but the rustica ambience is just fine!"
Pathetic service ; lousy food,"Read rave reviews on trip advisor about the restaurant and went with some apprehension as I had read some not so good reviews as well and didn't know which to believe.

To begin with our table outdoor was pathetic; very stuffy , lot of mossies as it's surrounded by green, so we requested for a table indoors. Fortunately they had one and we waited in the nearby alley as the lady was so rude and literally asked us to go out and wait. As my Daughter had exams we requested if we could order while waiting to minimise the time. But couldn't get a single person to talk to!

When we finally got the table: we waited yet another 15 minutes to place our order. Here's the icing on the cake! They ran out of burrata ; they ran out of caprese salad; they didn't have pesto in stock to make a simple pesto sauce pasta for my Son!! The risotto with porcini mushrooms had not one piece of mushroom in it. When I asked the man; he said it had been puréed ; and that was a blatant lie as the risotto was a plain pale ghostly white with no hint of mushroom in it! They did not even serve us house bread while we waited!! When we ordered some focaccia; we got a plain crusted pizza instead in a basket which they claimed is what real focaccia is!! I had ordered penne in pink sauce (out of the menu) with broccoli and carrots and that came with neither broccoli Nor carrot but a slight hint mushroom and zucchini. We ordered a truffle pizza which they forgot to bring!!! And when we asked in the end if it was coming; they said no without a hint of apology or regret or humility!!! The gnocchi was interesting and the stuffed ravioli with burrata was really tasteless!

The Panacotta was lousy and the tiramisu was very good!

I certainly didn't understand how a restauarant in singapore is allowed to run full while being so short staffed and so ill prepared with ingredients!!! It's a sham! And I would certainly ask you to ignore the good reviews as a full restaurant is a true reflection of the availing of the Chef and the servers and they failed on all fronts !!"
A place at a hidden corner,"Drive passed this place and decided to have a bit of me time, coffee and maybe cake for afternoon tea. Ambience was nice. The price was a bit on the high side. I ordered a cage latte and Tuscan dessert. It amount to about S $24 including tax. Kind of pricy for one person having a cake and latte."
Good food - Good Service..,"Authentic Italian restaurant serving up great selection of fresh pastas, pizzas and mains. This place is always buzzing and a reservation is highly recommended - along with clarifications of preference for seating locations. Its a bit of a stretch for the wait staff as seating is all over the restaurant. Seafood Pasta, Veg Ravioli & Eggplant dish were very well served!"
Very disappointed,"Came a few times before and thought their food is good. Made a reservation before hand, got to the place and we were given a table right at the back of the restaurant. Sat there for 15mins and nobody came to serve us or promote about their special menu for the day. It was outdoor and there isn't a fan to our table, It was after a rainy day too, so was feeling really stuffy and damp. We requested for a change of table and although it was more than half empty, they said they were fully booked and unable to allocate us to another table. Am really disappointed with their service. So we left. Was looking forward to another nice dinner but was surprised by their lack of flexibility adjustment. Might not go back because of this experience."
Awesome,"The whole family had dinner.

You feel welcome from the minute you arrive. You can sit either inside or outside and the staff is very attentive.

We had a ""prima"" and a ""secondi"". We all has the Ravioli for first course. Really great.

For second course - half the table had the backed Cod and other half of the table had the Ossebuco. The youngest had a pizza. Everyone was very satisfied.

To pock a decent wine we were let into the wine cellar to choose aided by a competent help. We had a bottle of Barolo (Gaja).

Desserts were coco sorbet, ice cream, tiramisu and panna cotta - each their own choice.

It seemed like it was just one of those evenings were things just click :-) We will be back!"
Consistent,Many years as customer and quality always high and consistent. Truly italian food cooked with simplicity as real italian trattorias
Authentic food and brilliant wine cellar,Kitchen is authentic Tuscan style and the selection of wine (Bussola Amarone) outstanding. Eating in the hard makes you feel you are in Tuscany
Simply amazing,"A truly magnificent place for amazing rustic Italian. We were offerred the Burrata, and we got heaps (maybe 200gr or more) of one of the best quality Burrata we've ever tasted....the ingredients (balsamic, olive oil) are just top notch quality.

Then the Ravioli, w/ tomato and burrata is another amazing dish. The tomato and pasta were of exceptional quality.

Another pasta w/ truffle oil was also superb.

The mackerel (grilled n smoked) w/ thyme and garlic matches well with the wine that Davide, the sommelier, paired with."
"Very good fish, but pricey vine","Visited this place several times for business and with the family. Food never disappoints, expecially the fish specialties but the vine seems overpriced.
Loved the grappa after the dinner and the attentiveness of the staff, primarily the young Italian fellow (sorry forgot the name) who was fun and friendly."
Was a favourite but now inconsistent,"Still great ambience and service, but honestly the food used to be better. The seafood soup has prawns that were chewy and clearly frozen and the salads were forgetful. The main course of the angus beef and pasta were clearly better but there are so many choices of good italian food today that provides wider choice for the customer. Service is still fantastic though."
Cosy and homely Italian ..,"Good atmosphere with a outdoor environment . friendly owner, chef and staff. in a area that is not so crowded nor touristy .."
