little disappointed,"Eel congee was cold, rest of the dishes was just Ok... However, we quite enjoy the decoration and the new year atmosphere."
What a memorable experience!,"Absolutely Fabulous , beyond expectations and a real experience, if your a foodie it‚Äôs a must do .. it was faultless , everything was cooked perfectly and the choice was mind blowing ."
Review,"We were abit disappointed as the lunch we were looking forward to, have changed to a breakfast buffet and we were only informed the day before, 31 Dec 2022. It was hard for us to look for another place so last minute so we proceeded anyway."
It's Kempinski so that means quality!,"Sunday Brunch. The Kempinski is a pretty well known 5 star hotel so I had high hopes before today's Sunday brunch. The decor and food set up was great and there was even someone playing a harp and singing while she plays. Perfect to start off the festive mood in December and also a rainy Sunday. Now to get the bad part out of the way, its really not that fantastic as the ang moh beside my table commented to his partner that there were no lobster offered (which I silently whispered ""and no foie gras!""). The seafood bar while beautiful layout only has 3 types of sashimi, salmon, hamachi and tuna, while the sushi was a meh. Points were awarded for their table spread of charcuterie and cheese board section. Special mention to their carvings station which has hits in their 3 different beef cuts, Wagyu Rump, Wagyu Skirt and USDA Angus Stripling. The Barramundi is worth more than just a second helping and the Hokkaido pork ribs are yum. Those that do not like the gamey smell should skip the lamb. Their desserts section consist of a myriad of western and local sweets and while I usually cater only 30 minutes for desserts, let's just say I ran out of inspiration with the savouries and started at the dessert section with 50 minutes to spare (given the limited spread). Of course if you are looking for a beautiful brunch restaurant in a. conserved building and food is not your top priority (The entry level Champagne served here is the Louis Roederer Brut!). This should definitely be checked off your list."
Excellent venue for team dinner,Excellent food and wine. Great setting for team dinner. 4 stars as drinks arrived after the third course and food was bit cold.
Disappointing Seafood Quality,The recommended seafood platter is not worth the price. The prawns and clams‚Äô quality is disappointing.
"Spotty service, not value for money.","Service was spotty. Was rather difficult to get the attention of the wait staff to order, have drinks topped up, make payment. The food was not too bad but the serving size was rather paltry. Ordered the toothfish and venison plus sides and starters. For the mains, got a piece of fish and two rather small pieces of venison, and one baby carrot each. No potatoes, no parsnips, no salad etc. To me, this is not acceptable."
Buffet breakfast at the KEMPINSKI hotel Singapore,"During our stay at the KEMPINSKI Hotel Singapore, we had our buffet breakfast at the 15 Stamford by Alvin Leung restaurant every morning. The buffet selection was huge- there was a lot of different food including Nasi Lemak, bread, scrambled eggs, tomatoes, and even a daily choice of noodles like Laksa or Ban Meen. Unfortunately the type of breakfast does not change very often throughout our five night stay.

The service- however, was problematic. On our first four days of breakfast, we had some erratic service. The staff members were ignorant, walked around customers without any purpose, gave us one pot of tea even though we said it was for two people, and even took away our dishes OR cleared up the table when we were fetching food outside!! This clearly indicates a lack of communication and organisation in the restaurant- and must be improved. However, on our final day of breakfast, there was a change of staff members- and instead we experienced excellent service in the restaurant. One staff member even chatted to me casually!!

Really enjoyed the ambience around the restaurant and made our days when we had breakfast."
Sunday Brunch for Family with Roasts,"Great Sunday brunch with the family. Excellent Roasts - Wagyu, Lamb, Barrumadi, Iberica+Cheese counter, Pasta with Seafood, Oysters counter with Sashimi, . Live sax music with DJ."
Birthday Celebration with Best Friend,Gery was very warm and friendly. She made us feel welcome. Took lovely photos of us and the food (some people just don't have the eye for it!) Recommended all the items with explanation on why the recommendations. Exceptional experience from a Intern. Wish you all the best and never settle for less when it comes to hospitality!
This is not a M Star restaurant... Definitely not fit to be in the Kempinski...,"2 star M... You must be joking...
This is supposed to be Chef A L who is a 2M star chef at the Kempinski... Its a joke... See my images...
Nothing about this place is better than a cafe... I was do so disappointed... Do not visit... This is a place that needs a M inspector to visit... It cannot be on the list... Bhagwan"
Good lunch,"Third visit, ordered the lunch set and added SGD8 for the foie gras kaya toast, I missed this dish, it was as usual good. My third time eating this.
The red snapper was good too, although I still prefer the barramundi which was on the menu during my previous two visits. Probably here they are pretty good at preparing fish dishes.
The mango sago, pomelo, coconut snow, yuzu was okay.
Staff pretty attentive, topped up my drink and removed plate promptly. First time seated in the main dining hall, a good place for business lunch.
Nice ambience and excellent service."
AMAZED BY THE 4-hand dinner by Chef Alvin & Chef Jay,"The FOUR HAND DINNER by Chef Alvin & Chef Jay, is legendary superb amazinggggg !!

Is my pleasure to get this chance to try these 8 course at a very affordable price $220+ .

The food is amazing, the service staff is friendly and catch up all kinds of requests by us.

Each of the dishes w beef tuned up by chef with their superb skill. Memorable dinner, love it so much"
Pretty Dishes,"The dishes are still pretty and well plated. Tastewise, most were good though a few needed some oomph. Eg the braised Angus beef was nice but could have used a boost of chilli.

The kueh koh sui was quite hard while the mango sago was okay. We had it the previous time so there was nothing special about it.

Quality of ingredients is still good. The portions were still smallish.

Service this time was a tad hit and miss."
Worth coming back again.,We had our wedding there 2 years ago. Good to be back and eat my favorite Laksa there again.. it was worth it.
Very good mains and dessert in a lovely location,"What a hidden gem! Loved the restaurant, setting and my main and desert. The ice plant starter left something to be desired. The tomato puree with the ice plan was awkward to eat and the flavors just didn't go. My main - chicken rice - was DELICIOUS. The chocolate 'soup' at the end was heavenly!"
Quality food in a great setting,"We were really looking forward to dining in this restaurant. Whilst a limited menu, there were some exciting dishes, especially the entrees. All of our steaks were cooked very well and service was efficient although not all staff were as well trained as one would expect in this quality of the restaurant."
Great Ambiance,"It was for a business meeting for 4 people. We had the 3 course set lunch. The service was lacklustre as the wait staff were not attentive most times.

However food arrival was timely and unified so very minimal interruptions on business conversations which is great.

Food was alright. Nothing mind blowing. However it wasn‚Äôt bad either.

I would certainly come again just for the atmosphere."
breakfast and service review,"breakfast is excellent, lot of choices and very friendly staff‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.the ambience is nice and cozy‚Ä¶ Reminds one of being in a Crazy Rich Asian (movie and book) setting :)"
Waiter‚Äôs recommendation is top notch,"Mr Suman, is extremely knowledgeable in his field of work, his recommendation has never failed me as he recommended mixing still water with sparkling water and my oh my, it is mind blowing, now I have a glass of regular sparkling water and another glass of mildly sparkling water. Insane combo if I do say so myself.

Miss Jermaine is an extremely hardworking individual. She is knowledgeable in a field of teas, and coffees, recommending me a wide array of variety each and everyday. It‚Äôs always a surprise when she is serving me, extremely diligent and honest. Who would have known she was an Ex National Bowler for Singapore, INSANE STAFF, I love it!"
Excellent customer service,"Excellent customer service , got a free small size cake for our anniversary dinnerüòç food is average to compare to other hotel restaurants we‚Äôve been to"
Felt cheated,Came all the all for the Ruinart champagne brunch. Found out they are not serving Ruinart upon sitted . The menu still stated as Ruinart but servicing Louis Roederer. Will not come back again . If you are running low in stock then don't list In Ruinart then dont list it. Really disappointed and cheated
Wonderful Dinner,"Special combination of food and its really nice, ambience is quiet and romantic, I really enjoy my night with my boy friend, but the aircon is too cold."
"Great ambience, modern take on local favorites","Enjoyed my set lunch, nice servers, but the Old World atmosphere is the clincher‚Ä¶ Modern colonial style decor sets the tone."
Great fine dining experience with local flavor,"Had a great lunch with husband there. Food is great, price is good, and service is top notch. We like the ambience. Will be back!"
Set Course Dinner,"A wonderful meal, every dish including the dessert was so delectable. Nice ambience with good service, would love to visit again."
Terrible service for a luxury establishment,"There are minimum standards expected of a restaurant helmed by a Michelin-starred chef, in a luxurious Kempinski hotel:

1. Wait staff should readily avail if customer needs assistance.
2. Empty plates should be cleared promptly.
3. Mains and sides should be served AT THE SAME TIME.

When we had dinner on Sunday, 19 Jun 2022, from 7pm to 9.30pm, none of these minimum standards were met. And it's worth noting that the restaurant was barely half full.

We were a table of 4pax. From the very beginning, it was already a challenge to get the attention of a wait staff to take our order. Following that, more vigorous waving of our hands in the air for
1. Two missing napkins (the table was not set completely),
2. A replacement knife which we had clumsily dropped, made a din, but no one had noticed
3. We had finished our starters but the empty plates sat on the table for 15 mins until we could get someone's attention, as well to remind on our mains.

10 mins after our mains were served (and mostly eaten), our 3 sides had still not arrived. As usual, it was impossible to get a server's attention, so I had to put on my mask, leave the table, and speak with the hostess at the entrance who sat us. I had asked to speak to the manager about the utter lack of service, but she said the manager is not in, and helped to hurry our order.

When the sides were finally served (by now it was 15mins after our mains), the fries were cold, the grilled eggplant lukewarm and only the okra was hot. Extremely disappointing and there was no apologies for the long wait.

The same areas that were lacking in service were repeated in other reviews over the years, only to receive the same textbook reply, by the same F&B Director Mladen Sinjeri. Clearly no want for improvement.

Our experience was nothing like its opening statement on their website - ""You haven‚Äôt experienced the full luxury of The Capitol Kempinski Hotel Singapore until you have dined at our signature Asian bistro and grill restaurant, 15 Stamford by Alvin Leung.""

1 star for the utterly failed promise."
Enjoyable set lunch at 15 Stamford,Set lunch is more worth than Ala Carte. Lots of lovely main courses to choose. Need a few visits to try all. Murals are lively and improves my appetite. Attentive service provided by Honey and Gery.
Nice food but over embellished and priced,"We had the set menu for which the laksa was very good, along with the salmon starter. The main meat dishes were okay but the beef was cold and didn't taste great. The atmosphere was very quite but I appreciate it was a Monday. Unfortunately it felt over priced for what it was and we left somewhat underwhelmed."
Laksa for the win,Best Laksa Ever 10/10. We undertand the service due to lack of staff but yeah we need to raise our hands in everything. We still want to order drinks but no one has came. They were busy too. But we will still visit.
Feel so cheated,"We chose the hotel because of the restaurant which offered wine pairing. Halfway through dinner we discovered that our wine glasses were smaller than the neighboring table!!! Also, if you take the 3-wine pairing, you pay more (and with a smaller serving) than if you order a la carte! What a rip off!!!"
Substandard Service,Service standards for not befits a high end restaurant! Waiter and waitress are not trained in serving customers! The waiter removed 2 plates while both forks and spoons were still leaning on them! The utensils created loud cranking sound upon landing on the table but this was ignored ! The waitress delivered the completed bill and then disappeared!
Excellent taste for Michelin Star Restaurant,"A very nice restaurant with good ambience. I order Four course set menu, and it was excellent, the salmon amd Laksa is very recommended. And very unique presentation of their dessert. Services also the best, a must visit in Singapore."
Inattentive service,"For a well branded restaurant‚Ä¶ with a reputable oversea chef branding‚Ä¶ beautifully decorated restaurant‚Ä¶ the hardwares are well thought of and designed. Sadly the software needs great improvements‚Ä¶
1. Staffs are not attentive‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a lot of servicing staffs working from 11am to 2pm‚Ä¶ but after that only 2 are left‚Ä¶ no eye contact through out our meals‚Ä¶ one can waves and keep your arm up and still no one service personal will notice ‚Ä¶
2.when I was unable to do the next booking for my guests online‚Ä¶ had ask the service personnel for assistance but was told to approach to host at the front counter to check myself
3.Water are never top up‚Ä¶ staffs are move concern to set up tables then to service existing diners‚Ä¶asking them for refills seems like interrupting their table setting tasks
4.asking for check is nothing different‚Ä¶ near to 3pm with only 3tables of diners left and 2 service staffs around‚Ä¶ getting their attention for check is still a challenge.
I highly recommend that the staff training has great room for improvement."
Good Meal In Beautiful Surroundings,"The place looks lovely and the ambience is great. Service was also super friendly yet professional and quick, and the dishes were plated beautifully.

Foodwise, it was pretty good. Only complaint, if you can call it that, is that portions are small.

The foie gras with Java glaze and banana rum raisins was a nice starter, and called to mind char siu when the smell hit the nose. The foie gras was delicious.

The spiced beef short ribs were the best dish, and tasted like excellent beef rendang. It was a smallish piece (to me) and I was wishing for some rice to go with it and the cucumber and radish pickle.

Desserts were so so. The mango with sago looked impressive with the coconut snow, but was ordinary tastewise. The coconut taste was lost in the strong mango flavour.

The mascarpone cane in a nice martini glass but the best thing of the dish was the plantation ice cream."
Set Lunch for Singapore Restaurant Walk 2022,"Lovely lunch in the Capitol full of colonial Art Deco ambience. Our leather booth was comfortable, with views all around of the main dining area and bar side entrance.
Set lunch had a choice of 2 appetisers, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts, so we had both options.
The Amberjack sashimi was yummy in coconut foam and cilantro sauce. The foie gras was satisfyingly savoury and sweet at the same time, served with slivers of caramelised banana.
The sea perch was a generous portion with a lively sriracha hollandaise and side of artichoke. Rendang sauce set off the very tender and juicy short rib, with a side of achar.
Dessert was a mango-sago soup topped with coconut snow sprinkled at the table. The other sweet was a parfait of espresso mascarpone mousse with chocolate streusel and ice cream, dusted with cocoa.
A very good value for 3 courses, and we enjoyed Suman‚Äôs and the staff‚Äôs attentive service.
We will be back."
Excellent twist to local food,"I have been wanting to try this restaurant with my family but due to COVID, have to delay it till now. It is well worth the ""wait""

Kaya toast was excellent with the right amount of aromatic kaya.
Laksa is the best. The spices balance out so well that you crave for more even at the price!
Satay is very tender and juicy and well BBQed. The pineapple peanut sauce is so forgotten old-school type but unforgettably tasty!
They ran out of hand-cut fries and offered us the normal fries and it is also very well done with the right crunch on the outside and softness on the inside.
Unfortunately we were not able to try the souffle as the machine was down.
Chicken rice is the only dish that we think it is below standard."
"Dont eat here if you value your time, worst birthday lunch. Should have eaten somewhere.","Less than a week before my birthday surprisingly 15 Stamford still has a table for lunch so off we booked one. Thought we were so lucky because weve been looking for other popular restaurants and most were fullybooked. Now I know why

Appetizers were good, looks fancy so we took photos. But what pissed us most was the serving time of our Mains. No one was even bothering to check if we wanted it to be served considering that we are not touching our Appetizers anymore. Finally a poker faced waiter approached us and asked it we wanted our mains to be served. I said yes! because its too long already. Even after saying so, still we waited for another 5 minutes or more. Whats more annoying is we arrived earlier than other guests but they were being served first.

Come the Mains, we didnt even bother taking photos of it. Steak was good but red snapper was a-ok. We immediately asked the waitress to serve our desserts, still it took long for them to serve.

It was the worst birthday lunch I ever had.
Now we know why we got a table."
Enjoyable ASEAN fusion food,"This restaurant served fusion food using lots of the Asean spices. Very creative and refreshing taste of food. Especially the appetiser of salmon and tuna with refreshing yuzu seasoning and watermelon to blend well with the ASEAN based style food. Mixture of Asia and western food style cooking. I also tried the laksa which is really surprisingly good other than price could be too much compare to outside hawker for sure. Enjoy very special laksa birth and spice used here. I would suggest a simple ingredients and charges lesser so many can afford to enjoy this very local flavour food. Love the chicken satay, threadfin fish, grilled beef ribs and octopus. The ambience is really nice for you to chill. A nice bar with varieties of cocktail and is very chill bar in my view. Extensive wine list with choices from French to Australia! Love the plate used for food display symbolises south Asian cuisine. Enjoyable the service and very helpful staffs."
Please remove the unlimited servings from your menu,"Had Sunday brunch on 10 April. Pass Around and Desserts platters were supposed to be unlimited servings but when we placed order for second serving of Pass Arounf, was told have to wait for all dishes served. Fine. Then after all dishes served we requested second servings of Pass Around and Desserts, the waitress then informed that some of the items are not available. It is really surprising to hear that unlimited servings can run out, given that the Pass Around is served in such a tiny bit and we could not order earlier. Sunday Brunch is only served on Sunday, I am sure the number of guests with reservation should provide indication of how much food to prepare, that day was also not public holiday nor school holiday.
Overall, we are disappointed with the Sunday Brunch experience, food was great but the fact that unlimited servings is subject to time of ordering and availability just missed the mark.
I would suggest removing the word unlimited serving from your menu card and also from your website menu if we could not even get second serving for Pass Around and Dessert Platter, it is just misleading."
Four stars out of five but the fifth is within reach,"We had a very enjoyable evening; the food was excellent and so was the service. I still feel
there is a bit of room for improvement though: it took quite a while for the wine to be served, the sharing platter arrived half way through the meal while we had asked to start with it and, lastly, we were politely encouraged to leave at 2230 even if that restriction is no longer in place. Having said that, it is definitely a place where I will be happy to go again soon."
The restaurant charged me twice,"The food and service at restaurant were fine. However to my shocked, the restaurant charged me twice. I called to inform receptionist around 2pm. The receptionist informed someone would call me, however till 6pm no one called me and I needed to call back again. Finally the staff called me back. For such as prominent name of premises, I didn‚Äôt feel the management take this issue seriously. This mistake should not have happened and unacceptable for a reputable high-end restaurant at the first place. If I didn‚Äôt receive any sms or check my credit card bill, I would not realize I was charged twice. I was expecting the call immediately when i called around 2pm. Although the staff apologized, it seems he is the staff in charge for my bill and he repeatedly said the restaurant doesn‚Äôt intend to cheat my money‚Ä¶. Of course I didn‚Äôt expect the restaurant is a scammer. Finally he said he will do reversal and I will get back the refund only weeks later."
"Lovely breakfast, Sunday brunch and lunch venue.",The menu was varied enough that I enjoyed the breakfast and lunch we ate here. Sunday brunch was also a treat - this looks to be very popular and needs booking in advance..
Not much value-add to the creativity of the ingredients,"We were looking forward to dining at 15 Stamford multiple times during our stay here as the menu sounded very creative & inviting, exactly the sort of fusion food fine dining we gravitate towards.

However, at our first dinner the dishes were average and so the meal was disappointing. It felt as if the chefs did not work particularly hard to bring out the flavours in the dishes, or perhaps another way to put it was that there was not much value-add to the creativity of the ingredients.

It was disappointing enough not to give this place another go."
Comeback kid,"Feel your mood lift when you step into the luxe Kempinski. Continue wending to 15 Stamford and you‚Äôre greeted by the resplendent bar. The restaurant with booth seats is just such a sight to behold with tasteful pieces. This is my second visit and I was turned off by the first. I am so impressed by the leaps and bounds in food quality. Once pedestrian, it is now haute Mod-Sin. Soft shell crab was caked in curry spice richness. Atlantic salmon nori pie tie was the best on the table for me. Beautifully presented with a wow Gochujang sesame dressing. Three-styled corn with popcorn was such a surprise, I absolutely love the creative touches. 15 Stamford has staged a total comeback and knocked my socks off. #eatstylishtravelstylish"
"Great food, good ambience and service","This is a great restaurant to try. The food choices are unique in its own way. The ambience of the restaurant is also very good, feels very cozy and homely. The service staff is warm and friendly too."
Outstanding food & ambience!,"It‚Äôs always a delight to dine in this beautiful restaurant with Asian fusion cuisines. We had the 5-course dinner set, starting with a delicate Japanese shrimp dish and then a charred octopus leg. The third starter was our favorite foie gras cooked with Asian ingredients. We choose the Black Angus Beef Short Rib cooked in rendang sauce for the main dish. And a mixture of desserts like spiced pineapple and Pandan mascarpone. Total bill for 2, including 2 aperitifs and a bottle of wine is S$536."
Service can be better,"Food was generally good as it is a 2 Michelin-starred restaurant but service was not up to standard. Given it is a 2 Michelin-Starred restaurant located in a 5 stars hotel, my guests had to ask for disinfectant wet wipes and mask bag to keep the masks which the restaurant should have provided in the first place. The dinner set menu comes with wine pairing but the waiter forgot to serve the wine for 1 guest which appalled the other guests."
"long wait, above average food","food was honestly not bad, but service was just real slow. made a booking for 630pm, made our orders at around 645, but only got served our food at 730. we know good things are worth the wait, but...45 mins of wait when the restaurant isn't that packed on a weekday evening just didn't make much sense.."
26/02 ‚Äî dinner set + alacarte,"food was amazing. as a student, im not any rich person. so the food was mad expensive. thanks to my parents, i managed to taste a bit of attas-ness. It was wow to say the least. the beef short ribs was bomb and i had a great time savouring every bit of the 4 courses.

unfortunately, there were some delay in the food of around 40mins. im not sure if it is common among expensive places, but all good coz of the thick cushioning i was sitting on. the bar was just next to the dining area, so it was rather noisy and coupled with the music‚Ä¶ it was Loud okay.

hey, but chef leung‚Äôs food was rly tip top and the food surpassed any service flaws. so thanks 15 stamford :)"
15 Stamford,"Prices are steep and there is a $100 minimum spend but it's easily met by two mains. The ""bak kut teh"" ribs are tender, the sweet barbecue sauce has a nice herbal hint and the compressed watermelon refreshes the palate. Bomba rice is unusual because it's starchy and slightly risotto-like, yet the brisket and the other toppings recall claypot rice. The staff were busy but attentive and maintained their smiles behind their masks."
Returned and was not let down,"I came here for New Year‚Äôs Day and thoroughly enjoyed myself and promptly made another booking for valentines. This valentines, the meal was superb. Michael was such an amazing host and I simply love how the rum bar is next door for an amazing finish!"
Tasty fusion food,"We had family dinner on 2nd day of CNY, decided not to order the special CNY menu. Appetisers were good especially the chargrilled octopus and baked brie cheese with chinese fried dough (you-tiao). The meat land platter was well served with all meats and enough for 5! Pandan souffle very soft, but the CNY dessert for $20 is too small with bits of nian gao with no special taste of what is in the menu."
"Wonderful food, ambience & service","Had dinner & breakfast at this restaurant and we were blown away by the selections both time. Great variety and wonderful tastes. Service was excellent as well, especially from Dustin, Chaplin & Michael.

P.S. please send my compliments to the chef. The lobster mac & cheese was exquisite!"
Everything Nice,flawless executions on the dishes we had. Tentalizing treat to all senses. Creativity meets quality at its best
Anniversary Dinner,"Dinner was wonderful, interesting dishes and well explained by staffs; Vera and Michael. Thank you for the great service!"
Excellent food and service,"Personal personal. The ribs were very good Nice ambience , entrance to hotel was hard to find . Will recommend to friends"
Very average Christmas dinner - nothing special,"For a fine dining restaurant, a very average experience for Christmas dinner. For one, the service was not st fine dining levels. I think we interacted with almost 10 staff throughout the evening - no consistency and a general sense of confusion. The food was mediocre. The wine parings looks like they went to the >$25 bottles at Fairprice. Nothing special."
"A last-minute decision, but a good decision","We had planned to go for a walk to Boat Quay for dinner, but the rain came down and down and down, so we decided to eat at 15 Stamford by Alvin Leung, conveniently located inside the hotel we were staying at, The Capitol Kempinski.

A good decision.

We only had one course each, plus drinks. We enjoyed the meal, we thought the look and feel of the place was good and the person handling our table was very efficient. An overall good experience."
Great breakfast with poor attitude,"Had breakfast here during a staycation at Capitol Kempinski. Took a while before there was someone who attended to us and assigned a table. Menu was not provided for hygiene purposes and ordering done through the servers.

All the food we ordered tasted great, apart from a gingery watermelon juice which was resolved quickly.

Heard about the honeycomb that was served during breakfast and we requested for it. After a reminder, we were told that ‚Äúit is on the way‚Äù. A few minutes later, the staff realised that it was still not served and went to check with his manager. So we slowly finished up our last plate and juice. And even after that, it was still not on our table. So we assume that the manager brushed the staff off when he helped to check on our honeycomb. The manager should at least have the courtesy to inform us that it is no longer available for whatever reason if they are not serving it. This totally ruined the experience and start of my birthday."
New Year‚Äôs Day Dinner,"We ordered the 5 course set menu, while the first course arrived on time, the rest of the courses took so long that it took us 2.5 hours to finish and we had to keep chasing for the food to arrive, also as we were seated next to the kitchen, the smell from it is very strong and they should do more to improve the exhaust system, the service is great though, very attentive, they should improve on the timing of the food and the smell from the kitchen"
Amazing dinner and service at 15 Stamford,"We were so glad to have tried their New Year‚Äôs Eve menu and their food, flavours were sublime. We were well taken care of by Mr Michael Macabulos. Michael is the go to guy if you want impeccable and meticulous service, he is extremely attention to detail and also extremely friendly. 15 Stamford should be proud to have such a wonderful staff such as Michael. Kudos to Michael and I hope that you would have a very pleasant new year and God bless you and your family with good health always."
Parking services were horrible for a renowned hotel!,Food and service was excellent. Interpretation of the dishes and flavours were enticing. Parking services were disastrous with no valet. When it was brought up the staff said that an email was sent to inform of parking situation. This email was not received!
Wine pairing without an explanation and 5 courses rushed through in less than 120 minutes.,"Christmas Eve 7pm. The restaurant seemed to be in a rush from the start. Almost like there were 2 seatings they had to get through. From 8:30pm onwards there were empty tables around us which were not cleared or cleaned. The courses were rushed onto the table with some explanation. The rather expensive wine pairing came with no explanation at all. Our ratings for the different courses where between 1 star (indeed that bad) an 4 stars. Sadly, we would not recommend going here."
Pricey,"Overall the food is really creative and one of a kind. However, we went for the Christmas Set Meal and is quite the pricy. However generally it is a one of a kind experience"
Birthday celebration,"It was a celebration for two birthday gals. It turned out to be a celebration of great food, good service and amazing ambience too.. We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch and will definitely return for more‚Ä¶"
Nice ambience with wide variety,"We went as a group of 5 for our Christmas lunch. Most will like the ambience, service and choice of food (Asian n International). We chose the 4 course set lunch and coffee/tea was not included in the set at that price ( Festive set lunch $68++).

The set lunch was priced quite expensive for a tasting portion. Must guys would have to find an alternative bite after lunch.

Overall go for the ambience but for food serving wise, there are much more choices in the neighborhood."
Creative and excellent cuisine in great ambiene,"The atmosphere is warm and friendly. Food is excellent in terms of presentation and puts alot of twist to the local Singaporean fare. We were recommended that the Big Plates in the A la Carte section is good enough for two persons.
Unfortunately, it is probably good enough for a person. We ordered two Big Plates to be shared amongst 3 ladies and myself(a man). Ended up, we were still hungry even though we ordered sides.
Two of us decided to two orders the Laksa for ourselves. My Laksa arrived , tastes great but not enough noodles.
Unfortunately, my guest's Laksa did not arrive and we were shocked when the waiter said that he did not take the order for the 2nd Laksa. We ordered two Laksas at the same time. As the kitchen was closing, we have no choice leaving my guest disappointed and hungry.
When I returned home, I have to grab a piece of bread and butter as I was not full at all.
Will visit again and hope to have a better experience.
Apparently, the kitchen brought out only"
Classy respite but expensive,"When I was there in early Dec, the lunch menu was excellent value and quality. When I dined there a week later, only the Festive lunch menu was available. This offered less choices and was not great. The ondeh ondeh dessert on the ala carte menu was disappointing. I was shocked that a pot of tea set me back $18! It‚Äôll be some time before I return."
Food was good but service could be improved.,"Had a team outing and spent around 600 sgd total for 4 pax. We ordered from Alacarte menu and all of the foods were really good and the staff was really friendly.

All was good but I had to -1 star because at around 9.45 pm after we ordered our last drink, it was not served for almost 30 min and I had to go to the bar myself. When I go and pick up the drink, i noticed that the bartender's mask was below his chin and was busy chit chatting with the customers which I find it very inappropriate.

Later on one staff came to apologize for the delay and offered us a free cup of tea but I thought of sharing this feedback as it is breaching covid rules."
Drink and dinner,"I have both reservations at Bar and Restaurant. I was late 10min from my Bar reservation time and a lady told me to wait awhile and someone from the bar will assist me after they clearing the table. On my Bar reservation I did not indicate for table or bar counter seating and I am fine with either seating.
At that time a lady who seated at the counter (presumably also waiting for table seating) then a waiter show her to her table and the same waiter show to me to the same exact seat without sanitise or wipe the counter table. When I ask for water, the bar tender pointed me the glass of water that on the counter ( which the previous lady seated) and he told me is a new glass ( given covid situation isn‚Äôt the restaurant/ bar will be more careful when handling the food and drink?) another Bar Tender helps me change a new one. I totally feel ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù after the situation. Worst I have a dinner reservation.

Glad that things turned out well at the restaurant- Michael is a great staff who recommended what to order and make sure I have good dining experience. We enjoy the food very much.Thank you."
Birthday celebration,"Food was excellent. However, considering that it is at Kempinski hotel, I was hugely disappointed at the fact that there was no valet service available. The hotel itself has no parking lot and the parking lot at the Capitol is small and quite cumbersome to park and go to the hotel, especially if you are dressed up for an occasion. I was celebrating my birthday and it was very troublesome to find a parking space, manage parking and walking all the way to the hotel restaurant. It took me nearly 20 min. Also, the service at the restaurant is very slow. I was quite disappointed at these two things but the food was delicious that I didn‚Äôt complain to the manager. However, I strongly advise people not to bring car there."
Mostly amazing at a high price.,"Firstly I say mostly amazing at a high price.

High prices are fine if everything is amazing.

Service: amazing.

Most dishes we had were amazing in the octopus (we even ordered a second plate later), chicken stay so amazing, chicken rice amazing, prawns, good, lobster average and certainly not worth the price.

Overall we ordered a lot of food, had 6 beers between two of us and the bill was $424.

If everything was a 10 I'd be fine with that however the prawns and lobsters had the same or similar sauces which where a miss and nothing special for the price.

Service was faultless

It's a high end experience in a relaxed environment however I falls short if 5 stars based on value for money based on the lobster and prawn dishes."
Delicious Asian fusion and fantastic service!,"Firstly Suman our lead waiter was very welcoming and knowledgeable about the wine menu and really
Contributed to our positive experience at 15 Stamford restaurant. Thank you Suman!
Then the all the dishes we had were amazing! Starting from the chicken satay which was probably the best we‚Äôve had in our 10 years in Singapore! The other favs were the fried kale and Brussel sprouts and the laksa and the Angus beef short ribs! Definitely a must have when you visit!"
Lovely Experience.,"Excellent service, love the honey wagon (something not commonly seen elsewhere) and enjoy every moment of our stay in Capitol kempinsk"
Excellent breakfast spread and service!,"Comfortable honeymoon stay Amazing breakfast service with attentive staff, wide spread of local and international food and drink Would recommend"
Excellent service and good ambiance,"Professional and Exceptional service by Timothy. We were impressed with the personalised service he gave us. It was the first time visiting this place, Timothy is friendly and approachable. He recommended few drinks and food to us and we love them. Especially, the saut√©ed mushrooms which frown from France weekly. It is quite nice. Thank you for the excellent service once again!"
Good lunch but....,"Second visit, ordered the set lunch, added SGD8 for the foie gras kaya toast and another SGD5 for the chendol. Main intention was to try out the chendol, pretty disappointed, my SGD2 chendol in Chinatown is very much better. First two pictures before and after mixing the chendol. The barramundi and the kaya toast were good, staff were friendly."
Dinner,"Great food, service and ambience. Michael, Francis and Edriane looked after us. Checking up on us every now and then. Will be back especially the bar! Keep up the good work!"
Good Lunch,"Had my lunch there today, first visit. Ordered the set menu, fish was fresh and good, portion not much, served by Miss Vera, excellent service, thank you. Will return soon."
Best ambience,"The restaurant has a particular ambiance and charm. Not too dimly lit but enough for a romantic dinner. The staff is courteous, polite, and fairly well versed in the degustation menu and its respective plates. The most outstanding dish would have to be the foie gras. It was served in a method reminiscent of a by-gone coffee shop breakfast. The infusion was placed in an espresso cup reflecting a demi tasse of espresso. The foie gras was layer on rectangular sandwich with the crust removed. And below is the sandwich that was grilled with the respective marks was the coconut jam. Now that it is how art meets function. Very well done."
Jin song,"Food was excellent, ingredients were fresh, well prepared and paced. Recommendation from Grace, our waitress was second to none. Champagne pairing made the evening more special than it already was. Will definitely be back when the menu changes next season"
In top form,Lovely food and service at 15 Stamford as always. We had the set lunch - the chicken rice was delicious and the condiments were excellent. The barramundi did not disappoint. Desserts were lovely - mango pomelo sago was light and refreshing and the chocolate dessert a perfect way to end the meal. Thanks to Grace and the team for a warm welcome and thoughtful service. Our fifth visit and we shall we back!
One of the best hotel restaurants in Singapore,"If you are around the area and out of dining ideas, I would strongly recommended to give 15 Stamford a try. Impressive plating and food quality. I would return on special occasions."
Better each time!,"Great experience at 15 Stamford. Even better than I remembered it on my last visit. Amazing laksa as usual. Tried the foie gras kaya toast, it was a great hit. Had the lobster mac & cheese, satay and char siew beef ribs (sounded strange but I loved it!)
Pandan souffle was great. Didn't like the pineapple one as much.
Will be back.

It's a pity it's no longer on Amex love dining, would be back more often if it was still on love dining."
"Bad experience, 5 person brunch but always come with 4 pax portion. Still have $100 deposit haven‚Äôt refund.","Hold my $100 deposit, don‚Äôt understand why cannot direct duduct from my bills. The food serve very slow. It make us can‚Äôt really enjoy the brunch. The pass around snacks was cold. Our seafood plate only serve 4 portion of lobster for five of us. The prawn was still hard and with ice, haven‚Äôt defrost. Very bad experience with this restaurant. It‚Äôs my daughter 19 years old celebration. Feel so dissatisfied with the quality of food."
So awesome,Everything was mind blowing from the start to the end. Be sure to keep your stomach empty before entering the place. Bring a good company as the whole course can last about 3-4hrs.
Excellent Restaurant,This is our first time at this restaurant. The ambience at the restaurant is very good. It makes one feels relax and comfortable. The food selection has variety and the food quality is high. Every dish that we tried are very yummy and of high standard. Makes us want to visit the restaurant again soon. I highly recommend this place.
Excellent service,"First time dining at 15 Stamford by Alvin Leung. Excellent service from Mark, Suman and Grace with good recommendations. Have great experience here. After dinner, we move to the bar, Francis have good knowledge and recommend the drinks, Edriane and Timothy take good care of us. We will definitely come back!!"
A gourmet dining experience,An absolutely stunning restaurant! We were made to feel welcomed by the staff right from the gate and the food was absolutely mouthwatering that we're already planning our next visit. Every bite was such a treat and it was truly a gourmet dining experience. The staff explained every single dish to us which made us appreciate the edible masterpiece even more and took care of us really well with the highest level of service. Our visit was incredibly memorable and this place is highly recommended for a special occasion. Thank you 15 Stamford for making our night. 
Fantastic Sunday Brunch,"The new introduced Sunday Brunch was mouth watering! The Seafood platter best ever Lobster, Oysters and Prawns just fantastic. Followed by some cold cuts and a then a great variety of different tapas.
For the main course you can choose between several options, I had the wagyu steak and it was lovely presented as well the taste was great. Even after the main we had 2 more courses to come with some sweets again a huge variety, followed by cheese.
For us it was the first Brunch in Kempinski and compared to others the quality of the food was best we had ever! On top the way it was presented made it even more yummy! On the drinking side you can choose between different options, they offer as well a Vintage Champagne Option which is seldom to find.
We truly enjoyed the experience and we will be back!"
Kaya toast is a major surprise,"Did not realise it was Singapore Restaurant Week but we booked it nevertheless. The menu was placed on the table and the selection seemed good. The star to me was the e Gras Kaya Toast.The egg foam at the side provided a savoury finish mixed with the sweetness of the small portion of the kaya next to the bread. The three flavours fused well.

Main course for me was the lack Angus Beef Char Siew which was well executed . Not too sweet and was done medium.

The dessert chargrilled Saba Banana was okay for me. Was not too impressed by it. It was rather sweet .

Overall wonderful place for a quiet dinner . Food menu is different from other places."
Excellent Lunch,"So three of us here have been meeting for lunch 3 or 4 times a year for some time now, and are always looking for somewhere new. This had been recommended by a couple of people and Friday saw its debut on our rotation.

Safe entry and all that done, we were shown to our table, all very well spaced of course and iced waters quickly delivered. Then menu perusal commenced, along with a round of gin and tonics for an apero. The set lunch had some interesting choices and at $42++ looked a decent bargain. We all chose the kaya toast with foie gras to start, rotisserie chicken rice and the chocolate lava cake - prima facie that doesn't sound too exciting but wait...

The kaya toasts arrived, with a pot of egg foam topped with dark soya sauce and pandan gel. The waiter advised us to dip the toast in the egg and munch away. Great combination of flavours, nothing overpowering, all very harmonious. My only reservation was the toast was quite thick cut and I prefer my kaya toast Ya Kun style, a bit thinner and crispier but that did not stop me scoffing the lot.

Chicken rice time: the waitress had told us this was a signature dish as one of the trio had been dithering towards the fish, and when the plates arrived we could see why. Beautifully presented on elegant chinaware, with the traditional dark soya sauce, ginger puree and chilli sauce, the chicken was tender and flavourful, good crispy skin and delicately flavoured rice. I've had some very good chicken rice, and this was one of the best.

Dessert time: on the menu the chocolate cake comes with a hae bee hiam biscuit but I am not a fan of dried shrimp so the waitress found me a different biscuit, again homemade with pistachio and pandan which went very nicely with the cake and Madagascar vanilla ice cream. My comrades who did not go off-piste reported that the saltiness of the shrimp biscuit worked very well and I could see the idea behind it.

Overall, excellent. The service was prompt, efficient and friendly, and the decor, table settings and ambience top notch. A return visit is certainly in the stars."
Great place for celebrations!,"It's my third time here already and I am still amazed by the food, service, and overall ambiance. We celebrated a friend‚Äôs birthday yesterday and the restaurant and bar crew really made sure we had the best night. Thank you for accommodating our requests and attending to us. (Date of visit 9 Apr, 7-10:30 PM) Keep it up and looking forward to our next visit."
Tasty plates of food and lovely service,"15 Stamford is a gem of a restaurant with inventive and delicious food. The use of local flavours and ingredients alway positively surprise. The charcoal grilled meats are lovely as are the ceviches and small plates. And do try the pandan souffl√© . I have never seen souffl√© with that amazing level of rise! The menu also changes so there‚Äôs always something to look forward to. Thanks and kudos to Dolly and all the team and of course the chefs for always making each and every experience a special, memorable one. Love it, love it, love it!"
Satisfied with great service,"Offers variety of creative menus, fusion food. Staff is very polite and attentive, asking for feedback after each dish so that they can improve. Good experience overall."
Great service and food,"Was at the restaurant during the restaurant week. Food was great and we ordered different variety from the menu to taste the different flavours.serving of the food was also just right.

What was most commendable was the service provided by Sanjay. His friendly and jovial personality made us feel at home. In addition, he was also attentive to our needs by asking if we require a shawl or cushion which both was provided!

Thanks for the memorable meal!"
Fantastic new menu,"Came with a friend to try the menu, ordered the beef tartar, lobster Mac and cheese and Tooth fish. All were spectacular topped with a flawless service from Grace, Neda and Kay. Looking forwards to coming back and trying more!!"
Brunch,"What a fantastic Sunday Brunch. One of the best brunches in town. Since the self-service concept is not allowed for the time being they have a very innovative concept. Food quality is excellent and a extremely friendly and attentive service. A new jewel is raising.
Remark: The price is compared to the market very competitive and a little bit negative is that the standard of the cheese wagon does not meet the Kempinski standard yet."
Marvellous experience,"From point of entry to end of the meal, we were pampered with warm elegant ambience and impeccable service. Had the restaurant week dinner menu. We decided on Norwegian salmon trout starter, barramundi with buah keluak sauce and for dessert, the grilled Saba banana with Madagascar vanilla ice cream for two of us and the mango sago dessert. We loved each dish especially the starterI -it was refreshing and had a great balance of flavours. Surprise addition on the house, chocolate to end the meal. One thing that marred my experience somewhat was that they would not apply happy hour or serve wine by the glass in the restaurant. I was politely invited to the bar to enjoy happy hour drink or other ""by the glass"" drink, which didn‚Äôt make sense as my companions are teetotallers. So I had to order a cocktail (Rose Spritz) which unfortunately, was somewhat of a disappointment. Bar this illogical refusal, I would have given the restaurant an ""excellent"" score."
