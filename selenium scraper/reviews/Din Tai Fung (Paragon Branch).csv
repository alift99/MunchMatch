topic,review
There's always Din Tai Tung for great meal in Singapore,First went to this one in the Paragon centre in 2006. It's was the only one in Singapore. Now there are many all over town. Same great quality food and always a go to place.
A different experience,"We went there for lunch today . A different experience where we did not have to wait too long even though we were a large group. A robot led us to our table .
The food was excellent . Loved the types of dumplings and vegetable varieties they had .
The service was fast.
Wish they had more chicken and shrimp combinations in the dumpling . The shrimp combinations were all with pork."
Not up to par with the others,"If this were the first time I had been to Din Tai Fung then I probably would've enjoyed the food. However, having been to a few locations in different countries I'd say this experience was possibly the weakest. While the food was alright, I certainly expect better - particularly with their signature Xiaolongbao. I'd prefer to go try another location than to go back to this one."
Always the first stop in Singapore,The standard remains excellent. The truffle Xiao Long Bao and prawn pancakes were stunning. Service was efficient. DTF has gone high tech now with robots and QR codes!
Usual DTF standard,"Cannot go wrong with DTF. The usual stuff there.

Enjoyed it.

One thing I would suggest is to improve air conditioning, lower the temperature by 1°C from whatever the ambience temp is set at, that would make it comfortable for diners. Maybe a cost cutting measure (cut energy bill).

Food, good.
Will go again."
Excellent,"Excellent food! They have become hi-tech. You place your order by scanning a QR Code, Vey cool! The beef soup, the peanut noodles, the xiao long bao, and the vegetables were all excellent. I love this place"
Fungtastic,"DTF is great and a must-visit for everyone and anyone who wants a decent bowl of noodles, dim sum or even classic egg fried rice. Absolutely delicious, left full and happy every time."
Excellent dim sum restaurant in Singapore,"Very good and tasty selection of dishes, including and especially dim sum. Sweet and sour soup is really great"
Din Tai Fung Paragon,Steam chicken pao was very good. So the custard pau. Red date glutinous rice was a bit strange but great in taste. Drunken chicken was awesome. Overall very good experience and so does the service.
Great food & nice atmosphere,"A tough to find huge sized Din Tai Fung in the basement of Paragon was a great choice for the family weekend lunch. The food never disappoints, but it was made special by “Joyce” who welcomed us at the entrance by suggesting variations of standard dishes. And her constant checking in, light banter & breadth of topics was such a refreshing experience in staid Singapore where clinical service dominates over human warmth & Joyce changed that expectation. To be fair she did a good sales job, but hey, why not, the experience was worth more than just a few dollars."
Boring but satisfying food,"Like Soup restaurant next door, the menu here hardly changes. Dishes are wholesome, a bit boring but quite satisfying. Prices are reasonable, and service is decent. No wonder people (including myself) keep coming back."
"Great food, not just the dumplings!","The food is great, they are very friendly including to children. Sometimes some dishes are sold out but I guess it can’t be helped that they are facing some shortages now."
delicious dumplings,service was a bit slow but overall it was very good. oh and also the noodles was very good. Every time we think of a place to eat and we can't decide what to eat I think din tai Fung. So that's why I will recommend it to you.
Delicious dumplings,"Service was a little slow but the dumplings were worth the wait.
Very much enjoyed the dumplings stuffed with mushrooms and finished with truffle oil. We had the spinach which was perfect. Only complaint was that the glass of water never arrived and the spinach came out after the dumplings were finished."
Very tasty steamed dumplings and great ambiance,"Please take note the restaurant is at basement One of the Paragon.

My relatives from Medan (Mother in law, Brother in law and Sister in law together with their children total 7 of us enjoyed our family gathering and Lunar New Year of the Rat lunch at this outlet.

We ordered various little dumping, spring rolls, fried tofu, fried port cutlet, fried rice with prawn, egg custard bun (sweet), noodles among others.

The outlet is clean and waitress and captains are friendly in their service. They have a basket with cover for you to put your handbag inside to avoid tea splitting. This outlet do serve YuSheng and the captain said all the auspicious words when putting the ingredients in the plate.

There are plenty of car park lots near basement two escalator go straight up to the restaurant.

Next time you are at Orchard Road, do go try the delicious food serve at this outlet."
5 star vist BEST RESTAURANT,I went back to this place after two years and the food did not disappoint at all we loved it so much i cant not explain its my favorite ever! Should be top of your list! Its a must see.
Love it,This brand never disappoints. As good as eating in Taiwan or China. I wish to have this chain in Mexico. Who knows? Maybe one day...
"Love this place! No airs or graces, just consistently great food","You just know what you're getting with DTF! Always tastes the same, always hot, always fast. This chain deserves to be success, they focus on all the right things! Service staff can sometimes be hard to get hold of, they charge for tap water, and you need to order a lot of food to fill yourself up, but we keep coming back so they're doing something right!"
Food never disappoints,"Had our first Yusheng of the year. the new Thai sauce for it was really good. Food took really long to be served. Overall it was a good experience, as always."
Food is always DELICIOUS. Setting Perfect.,"Food I can't say more- it's always according to its standard, QC is there, quality of food is there. Never a disappointment. Comparing this to Wisma Atria, the restaurant setting for this is much better than Wisma Atria for its ambience, rather quiet environment, and space. Wisma Atria's one is like a mini coffee shop with limited space so everyone has to squeeze together. My favorite branch to frequent DTF. Kudos to the team for professional service every time we go there."
Can not fault,This Din Tai Fung in Paragon is the most amazing dim sum I have ever eaten. I have never had a bad meal at the restaurant and can not fault this place. All staff are friendly and welcoming and I can’t recommend this place anymore.
Din Tai Fung,The xiao long bao is nice with various flavours. The la mian and fried rice are good too. The service is quite fast.
We love Din Tai Fung!,We love Din Tai Fung and enjoyed it frequently when we lived in Taiwan. The soup dumplings are the best. Not a huge fan of the cilantro now added to the chicken dumplings but the pork dumplings are still amazing. No tea served automatically at this one as in Taiwan which was a shame I thought but excellent food nonetheless.
Great service,"We was there in our holiday for visit and we stopped at this place for our food.Taste was really amazing,staffs was really professional and kind and helpful as well.We will definitely visit this place once again in near future.Thanks for the great food and the great services."
Consistently yummy xiao long bao!,"And professional, friendly staff to boot. Oftentimes not the norm when you see harried waitresses but they greeted diners with smiles... basically polite all round.

We like this outlet at Paragon for its quick turnover. Just avoid the normal meal hours and you'll never need to wait for a table. The famous xiao long bao is a must order and arrives piping hot. Poke that hole in each to let the hot steam out before wolfing them down to avoid scalding your mouth.

Their fried rice is lovely too to bulk up the meal and we like the chili/vinegar rendition of their wantons. You get a nice kick.

Ambiance is noisy and vibrant. Even great for a solo diner."
Unimpressed,"The quality of food here is not the same as other dinGB tai fung branches.

I've been to several DTF globally and this branch was very basic.

In addition to taste being basic, the server missed an item from my order.

This is an ok restaurant but a poor din tai fung.

Plz give this review a thumbs up"
Great food and very busy,"I went with a friend who lived here. Very busy and crowded restaurant where you have to wait to find a table.
Food is excellent, great choices of vegetables, soups, dumplings, noodles.
Famous restaurant with several places in Singapour. Mid-range prices.
Great spicy noodles
Highly recommended."
Lunch with friends,"Visited for lunch with friends, having heard wonderful things about their dim sum.
Wasnt disappointed at all. Had to wait about 20 min as we had a group of six. The food was excellent. Well presented and served quickly. Authentic dim sum at it's best. Recommend highly"
The best dumplings!,"Superb, silky dumplings and steamed buns! Their pork chop with fried rice was delicious. I have a nut allergy and our server kindly explained what was safe for me to eat. Great place for casual dining."
"Amazing food, aircon too cold",The food was very good. The Xiao Long Pao was great. It was on of the best fried rice I ever had. I wish I could give 5 stars but I cannot because the aircon was too cold for my wife and I.
Celebrating A birthday at din tai fung,the best restaurant ever ! if u havnt eaten there I feel bad for you. my favourite locations are paragon gwc and wisma
Fantastic,"We were jet-lagged, just looking for something quick and tasty. We ended up staying far longer than we planned, simply because the experience was so good. We chose it for the owners'confidence to have an open-plan kitchen and we were pleased we did. The food was delightful and the service outstanding. We thought it mot especially expensive and great value. We enjoyed our time there and will go back again without hesitation."
Worth the Experience,Worth the experience Really don't know if vegetarian with my indian food habbits would enjoy it. Dumplings weer just ok Prices are high
Will recommend to friends,Will recommend to friends just for experience. Food taste was actually ok. A little pricey but it's good to experience what the food is like so you can relate to people that actually recommends good food.🙂
Always a winner,"Wherever we visit Singapore, we always choose DTF. This time we went the paragon branch.

No reservation and no waiting, we got seats immediately.

Food: xiao long bao is a must order. This time we tried the truffle pork, very tasty. freshly steamed. Crab and pork is also great. Shrimp shao mai, hot and sour soup, century eggs...

Service: staff were bilingual, attentive.

Price: Reasonable"
For dumplings - the real thing,"Large variety of top-notch dumplings - all sorts. Perfectly made and steamed. Not short-cuts and nothing not fresh. Get some take-out and have a delightful, healthy food coma."
Poor service,"Every time I come to Singapore I make sure I visit DTF. The pork dumplings are to die for. Today’s dumplings were just as divine as I remember. However, for the first time ever we encountered really poor service.

After asking 4 times to have our tea cups refilled I eventually took matters into my own hands and walked over to the serving station.

And to top things off they forgot our pork chop rice!! We pointed this out and were told it would take 5 minutes. After waiting 10 minutes we decided to cut our losses and leave."
Favourite in Singapore,"For a chain, the food is consistently amazing, Visited twice and on both occasions very good - steamed dumplings are a must, chicken wings, egg fried rice, sweet and sour pork - all exceptional."
Excellent,"I always visit Din Tai Fung during my stay in Singapore and choose very famous Xiao long bao. Service and ambience are average, however the Xiao long bao is beyond ‘Excellent’, thus overall rating is excellent. Worth visiting."
Soup dumplings - amazing!!,We were recommended this place to try their soup dumplings- well worth the visit! We actually went to 2 different outlets over the course of our stay just to try them again. The restaurant in the Paragon shopping centre is a little hard to find (it’s right in the back corner of level B1) and there was a bit of a wait to get in and to get our dumplings but definitely less than the quoted times. We tried the pork and chicken dumplings as well as the a smaller portion of pork and truffle- all delicious!! The fact that you can see the dumplings being made fresh in the kitchen really adds to the authenticity. On our return visit we tried the pork chop and fried rice which was so yummy as well! No pictures to share unfortunately as we dove straight into the dumplings as soon as they landed on the table!
Very good,Dined on 5 Sept around 9 pm solo. I was not delighted to hear that no chicken xiao long bao was available which was the main reason of my presence there at thy time
I always enjoy this fresh dumpling chain restaurant,"Service is quick, all you have to do is chose from the menu, fill up the slit and after a few minutes you get what you ordered. The truffle and pork dumplings are just fantastic.
The price is above average but well deserved.
Incredible that they don’t offer WiFi"
Solid dumplings with no-nonsense service,"After hearing all the hype about Din Tai Fung, we braved the queues to try it in Singapore. Although there was a long line, it moved quickly and we were encouraged to fill out our order sheet in advance to expedite things. We ordered the pork chop fried rice, Xiao long bao, pork and shrimp dumplings and on a last minute recommendation, the special of chili crab Xiao long bao. The pork chop was extremely tender and seasoned simply but well. I thought the fried rice was a bit plain, but the table enjoyed it. The Xiao long bao were the best I’ve had - steamed on a cloth for a non-stick surface and very hot and flavorful. To me the highlight was the chilli crab bao. It had the great flavor of chilli crab along with the usual pork. Service was quick and efficient, if not personal. Like many Singapore establishments, we were charged for tap water (S$0.50). Definitely a solid choice for a meal when shopping around Orchard!"
Fantastic food and service,Visited twice with family for lunch in late August 2019. Food and service were spot on. The flavours of approximately 5 or 6 different dumplings were lovely. They were moist and hot as well. The service was great. There was no waiting beyond about 10 minutes on either occasion. It's family friendly and there were lots of families there with children of varying ages. Lemon grass tea was great too. Not too expensive
Very impressed,"Although we had a reservation, arrived 30 mins early and had to wait an additional 30 mins, it was definitely worth it. The service was excellent from the start to the end and the quality of the food was outstanding from the dumplings to the fresh vegetables, salad and entrees. Glad to see there is more than one of this restaurant because they are on our list in every town we visit....hope there is one."
"Same as in Taipei, Fantastic","I have been at the first Taiwanese restaurant, and I decided to try this one in SIngapore. Absolutely amazing. Taste is exactly the same as in Taipei, dumplings are very juicy and tasty. Remember to be patience because there is always queue."
Delicious!,"This is most favorite restaurant ""Din Tai Fung"".I have to followed from original in Taiwan. This branch is in basement of Paragon department orchard road. Pork dumping is recommend."
Clean and Convenient,Lots of seating so the wait for a table will not take too long during peak hours . Food is delicious although slightly pricy. Service is efficient and friendly. Good place to have a Chinese Dim sum meal during shopping break at Orchard Road .
""" Worth the Wait""","We were told to go here and there are alway's cue's, it,s worth waiting. the dumplings are all made fresh you order at the table. The staff were great and the chilli crab dumplings were the best.it was well priced and a lot of different food on the menu."
Come here for the Dumplings,Truffle & Pork dumplings. 'nuff said. Also loved the little foldable stand to dump your bag into -- so you can enjoy your meal unencumbered!
Great,Always a privilege to come here and enjoy dumplings and more. The atmosphere is ok and the service pretty weak
Yummy,Our daughter suggested coming here as she had been to one in Australia several times so we decided to go. We enjoyed trying a variety of Asian foods and particularly enjoyed the dumplings.
Nice service,"Both me and my family love this restaurant, Nice menu and healthy one as well. Also the service and the way they present menu was very very nice"
Best dumplings in Singapore,"We had lunch at Din Tai Fung and as advertised the pork dumplings are the best, the service is fast and courteous and you want be disappointed with the steamed dumplings. So give it a go"
A Worthy Michelin-Star Meal at Din Tai Fung Paragon,"Expecting a wait-to-be-seated routine might be a turn-off during dining peak times but Din Tai Fung handles it with such an efficiency expected in Singapore that such an experience is not unpleasant afterall.
Diners-on-queue are cordially led to their dining area which is surprisingly comfortable with the right amount of space & privacy for more intimate dining experience.
Nobody can go wrong with their specialties / bestsellers like Xiao Long Bao and Red Bean Rice Dumpling. Worth noting though is that Good Food comes with Good Service. Nothing left wanting for a restaurant worthy of its Michelin-Star fame."
Signature Xiao Long Bao,"Located in the basement of the upmarket Paragon Shopping Mall home to many international retail brands, you'll find Din Tai Fung. Hard to miss with its glass walled kitchen and the white coated staff busy prepping and meticulously weighing the dumplings. The service is fast although expect queues at peak lunch hours and week ends as you can't reserve a table. Apart from the signature dumpling dishes, there are plenty of choices from oriental salads, to noodles and pork chops. For dessert, why not try the red bean rice dumpling, a particular favourite of mine. No matter how busy, the staff are always pleasant and the food delicious.
Since the restaurant is in a mall, the toilets are located outside. Lifts are available to all levels if you can't use the escalators."
Amazing,As always the dim sum is amazing. Always fast service and very well organized and the staff cares. Best dim sum anywhere there many locations in Sing and I’ve tried them all
"A Quick Lunch At Din Tai Fung in Paragon, Orchard - Singapore.","Yesterday on our way to Changi Airport we had to stop at Paragon Orchard to buy something. While we were there my grand children wanted to have lunch and we chose Din Tai Fung which is located at the basement of this mall.

Because it was a quick lunch we chose a rather simple menu which was dried noodle plus fried tofu. Eventhough it was Sunday, may be brcause it was lunch time, the restaurant was very full so we had to wait for about 30 minutes to get a table with 7 chairs.

As usual the taste of the foods we ordered is delicious. No wonder if the New York Times declared Din Tai Fung as one of top 10 best Chinese Restaurants in the world. In Singapore, you can find Din Tai Fung in Paragon, Takashimaya, Suntec City, Marina Baysand and some other upper class malls."
All gets a bit same same after a while,Visited DTF twice this trip and was bored the second time. The food is good and the place is nice but have to knock off a star just to say “don’t rest on your laurels” mix it up guys !
Crowded yet Calm,The ambiance was amazing. The restaurant was huge yet when you sit at your table you don’t notice that it is so crowded. The food is amazing and the portion sizes were great. The price was actually quite reasonable for a family of four ordering. Amazing place.
Mouthwatering dim sums...,"The best value for money dim sums on the island. Great variety to choose from including some delicious vegetarian options. The Dan Dan noodles are spicy, all the dim sums are bursting with flavour and the price makes it totally worth it. Be prepared for long queues at peak times, but it is managed very well and moves pretty quickly. You visit here just for the sheer mouthwatering food - not so much the decor or the ambience, though its not bad at all."
Decent veg fare,"There are a few vegetarian dishes, we tried all. Think only the paragon outlet makes the veg mushroom dumplings, other outlets have this dumpling along with pork. good food. We had the egg fried rice(you can ask for it without the egg) both types of dumplings (veg and mushroom, steamed veg buns, a few sauteed green leafy veggies. some of the sauces on the table are not veg, ask waiters first"
Amazing dumplings and great service,The pork dumplings are super. The lemon grass drink is very addictive. And the salad is too good but you have to be in by 12.30 because it sells out fast!
Dinner,Very good range of dumplings and food from Taiwan. You get to see how food is prepared through glass windows by hygienic staff
Enjoyable Dim Sum,"The Paragon Branch is the biggest branch of all the Din Tai Fung restaurants I have been to in Singapore. The wait was only 15 minutes for the three of us, not bad considering it was a Saturday night. The food came fairly quickly, service was quick and efficient. The dim sum tasted nice, the Taiwanase chicken claypot was very enjoyable and the noodle dish and soup my family had was also very good. You can never go wrong with Din Tai Fung."
"Great Chinese Food, stand-out steamed buns","Wonderful Chinese meal at this restaurant at the basement level of Paragon Centre on Orchard Road. The highlight without a doubt was the mushroom steamed buns - the aroma, the taste, the texture. Out of this world!"
Convenient and top notch food,Great quality Chinese food. Surely its one of the best. The location is also very convenient. My family and I can definitely be back often.
Can’t go wrong Din Tai Fung,"I have visited many branches of Din Tai Fung in the city. They never fail to impress me - Superb service, wonderful food.

Love their chicken dumplings, wontons, crunchy cucumber, chilli stuffed with meat, egg fried is so addictive. And how can I forget mentioning lemongrass drink. I never had this amazing lemon grass drink even at any Thai restaurants in Singapore.

I love cleanliness of their kitchen. In the kitchen at least i have observed Crew wears cap and mask all the time. For this I would like to give one extra star to them.

Thanks for maintaining the authentic flavours and raising the higiene bar higher."
Reasonable Taiwanese restaurant,"Ordered Dry Noodles in fragrant mushrooms and minced port sauce, and Soup Noodle with vegetable add pork wantons. Thought wanton skin was thick and noodles were slightly hard. However both dishes were reasonably tasty. Thought it was pricey though. Understand if we had to pay for chinese tea but they charge for water."
Poor,Just not as good as Paradise dynasty! For quality of product or range of dishes. Very mediocre. The ambience resembles a 1970 supermarket. Please don’t go.
Best dim sum !!!!,"This is a chain of Dim Sum restaurant with singaporean efficiency! You order on a sheet, food is prepare and deliver as it is ready.. Excellent quality, fantastic soup dumpling and not expensive... it is a busy place but really worth going !!!"
Delectable Dumplings!,"on our trip to Singapore, we saw a lot of Din Tai Fung outlets with loads of people flocking to eat there, especially for dinner. A definite crowd puller, Din Tai Fung was one of the best restaurants we visited throughout our stay in the country. The dumplings here were definitely the best that I've ever had. Be it the taste, consistency, preparation or stuffing, everything about these dim sums was near perfect. The management of the restaurant is highly efficient even during the rush hour and I'd recommend it to anyone who has plans on visiting Singapore!"
Din Tai Fung (Paragon Branch),"Din Tai Fung (Paragon Branch).
We were able to view the world-class showmanship of Din Tai Fung’s chefs within the open concept kitchen, where edible masterpieces are created and executed with precision and skill. A good expereince for the family, young & old. We ordered the famous signature xiao long baos (steamed pork dumplings) and heart-warming steamed chicken soup and other side dishes which did not disappoint."
A favorite in our stopovers,"We found Din Tai Fung a few years ago whilst shopping at Paragon and intrigued by the packed resturant and queue outside decided it must be worth a try. So happy we did, as it’s now a favorite eating spot during our regular visits to Singapore.

Excellent steamed dumplings and wantons and the deep fried pork on fried rice is a winner. So many other tasty goodies that you could easily eat there every day for a month and not have to eat the same thing twice. And all equally delicious.

Don’t be put off by what might seem like a big queue during peak hours. It moves pretty quickly. Just grab a menu from the reception desk and you’ll receive a number. Just hang out outside until your number is called (also displayed on a screen). The whole process is very streamlined.

Your food arrives fairly quickly. Although can be delivered in any order. Sometimes main dish before dumplings for example.

Well worth a visit!"
that's a Must,"The local chain restaurant serving mainly Dim Sums, which are just perfect. Different types, sizes, with different filling. Ain't cheap for chain, but it definitely worth it. Recommend for visit"
Best Dim Sum in town,"This has always been my favourite restaurant. I have lived in Singapore for many years and when ever we go back to Singapore on holiday, this is still one of my favourite restaurants. Everything is freshly made and extremely tasty. Don't go there for the ambience but for the food. Usually long Q's to get in but worth waiting!"
Great Dumpling Meal,"Having previously lived in Singapore we were already familiar with Din Tia Fung (DTF) but we still make it our first meal stop whenever we visit. Among our group we have also dined at other DTF restaurants such as in Taiwan and California - which are also good - and we have been very happy with this Paragon location.

Last week was our first meal at the Singapore DTF in a few years and it was as good as ever. We had a wait to get a lunch table but that was fine and the receptionist managed expectations well (indicated a 30 minute wait and it was only 20 minutes). Service was good and the food was excellent as ever. Obviously the number 1 item to order is the Xiao Long Bao or “soup dumplings” which is a house specialty for DTF. We worked our way through several orders for the table (embarrassingly too many) along with some nice stir fried vegetables plus cold beer and/or hot tea to round out the meal.

Enjoy!"
Dim Sum heaven !!,"Had to try this in Singapore ......long wait but worth it !! Dim Sum ( pork , shrimp ) was excellent . Pork Wanton soup was very good too !! Definitely a place to visit to try out all their tasty stuff !!"
Good Taiwanese Food,Din Tai Fun has grown into a worldwide chain. Classic dish is their steamed dumplings or siu long pow. They have a variety of noodles and rice bowls. Very popular with locals and tourists alike. Clean efficient self ordering system and quick service geared to maximize seating turnover. Good food. Pleasant ambience. Reservations usually required. Many outlets in Singapore alone. Go and try. Its good
bad service,the food is good but the service is bad. When asked to help search for something they look as if they don't care and give excuses. Never going back there again.
Pork Chop Fried Rice is the best,"My 2 most fav dish, Pork chop fried rice and truffle pork xiao long bao. Premium price but taste is so much different from Din Tai Fung in Jakarta, maybe because of the pork supply."
Fabulous,"I really enjoy to go there. You can see how they prepare the food,and its amazing.
The food is fresh of good quality.
The service is super, a lot of attention for people
Unfortunately sometimes you need to queue a long time, but it is compensated by the quality of the food."
"Food, Service, hard to beat!","Best dumplings around. Excellent staff, good for casual dining, including attentive and patient service when younger family members involved. The so so review I saw is NOT indicative of this branch of DTF (I've been there previously and have family who visit regularly). Shrimp and pork dumplings, pork dumplings, vegetable and pork dumplings, vegetable dumplings, pork fried rice, carrot and pineapple juice, do miao, just a few of the great and wide variety!"
"Disappointing, expensive and a waste of money!",Service was so so. Food coming out of the kitchen was slow l received one item every 15 minutes. The tables around me didn’t wait like l did. When l asked to speak to the manager he just argued and spoke to me like l was stupid.. I have been in the hospitality industry for over 30 years and have eaten at plenty of DTF’s in many countries before and never had to wait for food.
DTF options for vegans,"Staff are always super understanding about special dietary needs, just ask them to clarify if not sure about anything!
My recommendations for vegans:
1. Fried rice - Specify that you don't want egg; it's just rice and veg but the wok hei is beautiful.
2. Vegetarian steamed dumplings
3. Red bean buns - Waaay better than any other steamed buns you've ever tried."
You can never go wrong with DTF,"Apparently this was the first DTF restaurant in Singapore, I think now there are 20+ dotted all around the city state.
This one was the closest to my hotel (The Quincy), only a 5 minutes' walk.
We ordered the usual DTF fare, i.e. Xiao Long Bao, Taiwanese Niu Rou Mian (Beef Noodle Soup) and some veggies and other dishes. If you don't ask, the Beef Noodle Soup might come with beef that could have a bit more fat and muscles than you would usually want, so just ask them to give you leaner parts of the beef if that's what you prefer, they'll do this happily.
As usual the quality of the food is very good. I've been to a dozen or more DTF restaurants all over Asia and found them all so lovely that I'm actively seeking this chain out wherever I go.
Fortunately there'll be one in London, too, can't wait :)"
"Consistent, Yummy, Affordable",Din Tai Fung is our family favorite. Our 2.5 yr old cant stop eating the dumplings and fried rice once he gets his hands on them. The chocolate and red bean dumplings are great too. Love everything in this place + it is consistent and affordable.
Family visit to Singapore and Chinese friends highly recommended this restaurant .,"Our friends told us not to be put off by the queue as it moves through quickly , much like L’Entrecot in Paris . There must have been 30 plus people in front of us all filling out their menu order list . My wife and I were seated in 20 mins.. This is traditional Chinese cuisine hand made and absolutely fresh and piplng hot . The wantons are to die for as are the noodles . The dim sum was special too . No mucking around as we were finished four courses in just under an hour . No real atmosphere , but great service and brilliant food . Can thoroughly recommend and not too pricey either"
The Best Din Tai Fung.,"Whenever we come to Singapore try to have at least one meal at Din Tai Fung since we know it is delicious and they are constantly the same. Have never been disappointed by any meal that is at Paragon Din Tai Fung.
One day decided to see if could make a booking to save time but was told they did not take bookings but it was just walk in, but knew there would be a queue and a bit of a wait. When we arrived there was a queue and were advised that there was a 30 minute wait and would be called when our table was ready. While waiting in the queue we were given a menu and pen so could order in advance before going in.
The wait was not that long as we were called after around 10 minutes and then taken to our table. We ordered two different styles of dumplings, prawn rice , a salad and a beef and noodle soup. For drinks we had the lemongrass drink as it had one stalk of lemongrass in the drink. This drink was nice and refreshing and it is a bit different.
If you ever have a chance and are at Singapore come to the Din Tai Fung at Paragon as you will not be disappointed by the food. The service can be sometimes off putting but you get used to it."
Always Good,We've never been let down. It's Taiwanese style dim sum is always consistently good no matter where we've tried it. We always come back to the Paragon one whenever we are in Singapore.
GREAT DIMSUM,"I visited on 25 Jun. The restaurant is beautiful and cleaning. I'm so busy in the morning, that why I ate breakfast early.. the brf is very delicious.. I love it. I will come back on December."
The Perfect Dim-Sum,"No visit to Singapore is complete without a meal at one of its several Din Tai Fung restaurants. This particular branch located in the high-end Paragon mall is just off the busy shopping district of Orchard Street, and is an ideal lunch place for those in search of the perfect dim-sum.

Like all Din Tai Fung branches, there is alway a wait before you are seated. They don’t take reservations, so you must take a number and wait till your table is announced. But while you wait, you are given a clip-Board, a menu and a pen and you can fill out your order for the meal.

I always ask for their delightful Chinese tea as a drink with my meal. It is topped up throughout the meal. The menu extends to many things beyond the dozens of varieties of steamed dumplings, but it’s the dim sums that rule. They are served in sets of six or ten, in steaming bamboo baskets. The Xao-Lang Bao is their most famous offerings small morsels of pork swimming in soup inside inside an artistically designed dumpling of the size of half a golf ball. It is to die for.

For dessert, while my family chose a mango custard, I took a starter- gluten is rice inside split dates.

I go to Din Tai Fung for my share of happiness."
The Best Din Tai Fung branch in Singapore,"I have been to many Din Tai Fung restaurants in Singapore and the best one is the Paragon Branch. The exclusive Menu is amazing, the people are super friendly and attentive, the tea has flavour !! It always busy but worth the wait"
Pop in dinner.,"We came around this restaurant whilst wandering around Singapore looking for lunch. The food was very good, service was first class and the cost was a pleasant surprise."
Always a Fav..Din Tai Fung,Had been to the Din Tai fung in Taipei 2 yrs ago and the first meak after landing in Singapore this time was once again at Din Tai Fung. Excellent vegetarian dim sum and spinach.
SO good !,"Had a bit of a wait but the system of seating works well. Order ,get a number ,wait to be called - great ! Lovely jasmine tea and selection we chose was just right. Spicy and sweet , hot and sour ! Lovely staff too."
TERRIBLE SERVICE,"The queue was long as usual. We’ve waited for more than 30mins just to be seated.

We’ve waited for another 30mins for the food.

I ordered my favourite fried rice with pork chop.

BUT when the food was served. The waiter dropped the food on the table.

He just said sorry and left.

How am I going to eat a food that was on the table.

I reported it to change but the staff was not friendly enough to replace it.

This was the most terrible experience.

No service recovery done.

The name of the waited is Yin Fei according to other staff"
Excellent food and service!,"Just came back from Singapore couple days ago. Dumpling, Xiao Long Bao and noodle lovers must go - Ding Tai Fung.
The Xiao Long Bao size is so perfect, just one bite, the whole Bao can be in the mouth, the broth and the meat can be enjoy in a time, so yummy. Of course, before biting it, wait for a while, don’t burn your tongue.
The dumpling appears like a piece of art, the pleats are so neat and even, I like it. The taste is same good as the look.
Noodles are so chewy, guarantee you want to bite it again and again.
Also waitress Yinz was very friendly, polite and professional! Always very helpful. The best service we’ve had in Singapore! We would like to see her again in London. Definitely recommended and will come back for sure."
"Consistent, easy and quick","We popped in here for Sunday lunch, and only had to wait 10 minutes to get seated. We are regulars all Over the island (once or twice a month) and love that the food, service, drinks and atmosphere is consistently good. If you have t been... the Xiao Long Bao are perfect, and pretty much everything on the menu is good (Xiao Long Bao, crunchy cucumber, fried rice, pork chop, pork dumplings and vegetarian dumplings are our regular dishes) service was good and responsive and the free flow tea was topped up regularly."
Just fantastic,"The reputation of this place is awesome, so we just had to try it with Singaporean friends. It is sensational, if you like dumplings and noodles! We like both, so it was a no brainer. The menu is extensive and needs some study, and the orders are all marked by the guests on a checklist. It’s fun, and when it all turns up, it’s so tasty. Don’t forget to have their signature dry dumplings, and the dry chili noodles! The queues for dining can be long, but it seems to move quickly; don’t be deterred. Best times to go are Sunday and Monday nights. Most crowded seem to be Thurs/Fri/Sat nights and Sunday lunch. Don’t miss it in Singapore!"
