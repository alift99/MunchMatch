Good,Very good food! Food was very fresh and the the drinks were great too! Would recommend the food here!
Tsukiji visit,The shop has another name Katachi style Sushi dining. Ordered omakase lunch set @ $68 promo price. Sashimi & sushi - normal Tempura - good üëç Cod fish set - good üëç Damage - $50 - $60 per pax
Good Visit,Was limited by choices as they were moving but I was very satisfied with what we ordered as it was very fresh. Might be a little expensive so it's best to visit with some vouchers instead haha. Staff also called before hand to inform me ahead of time of the limited menu choices. Very pleasant experience.
Nice Lunch At Top of Orchard Central,Came here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the good view of orchard road!!! Do request for a seat by the window if possible to get best view...food is decent too.....
"great view , good service","great view , good service and the food is really very good , it‚Äôs a good place to have family gathering ."
Not worth a second visit,We were informed that the entire grill menu was not available after we were seated and my Chope voucher was being utilised. We ordered a pot of spicy soup which tasted like Chinese mala soup. The is no Jap soup taste in it. Perhaps it's fusion which I couldn't appreciate. The salmon roll was perhaps the best item we ordered. Bill for 3 totaled to $180. I would say it was not worth it for the taste and service. The restaurant needs to improve a lot to remain competitive.
Nice sashimi and best beef,Nice place and nice foods...sashimi is good and fresh....the beef so tender and soft...nice hospitality too
Great experience overall,"Restaurant on 12th floor of orchard central building with breathtaking view, wide variety of food selection and excellent food quality. Recommended to pay a visit"
Awesome food,"Fresh sashimi, cosy environment! Awesomely good. I will definitely recommend you to come try the food here. :)"
Nice place,Nice place with fresh seafood. Went to this place for dinner with my son and daughter. The seafood sashimi was very fresh and the slices were thick. Worth while eating.
"Great ambience, great food, great service","Overlooking the singaporean skyline, Tsukiji is a quietly tucked away restaurant that is perfect for a date where you don‚Äôt want too many people around. Had the ramen and the stir fried squid and I must say that it was worth the dollar spent.
Only thing it could work on is the constant change in menu because there were a few items that were no longer available because of season change."
Casual setting with good variety of sashimi Don and small bites,"Good variety Reasonabld price for the quality Casual setting Family friendly Ordered scallops, five of a kind sashimi, karage chicken"
good time with friends,"We ordered a 7 type sashimi platter, waygu beef steak, korean fried chicken wings and tempura to share. The quality of the food was pretty good although we were unable to order any grill food that day as their kitchen grill had broken down."
Good value for money and stunning view,"Tsukiji fish market restaurant was very enjoyable, with a good atmosphere and view of the Singapore landscape! The food was alright and service was pretty goodüëçüèª"
1st time here for hubby‚Äôs,"1st time here for hubby‚Äôs birthday and indeed the right choice. Happy hubby=happy wife, as he praised the freshness and quality of food. Reserved early and got a view by window side - facing Orchard Rd and can see Istana view.

A rooftop gastronomic experience,"I was very pleased with the service rendered by Tsukiji Fish Market. It was a breeze making a reservation on chope and they gave us a cosy, private table to celebrate a friend's birthday. The food was delicious and truly a taste of Japan in every bite. We ordered the Sumo hotpot, Salmon foie gras sushi roll, Agedashi tofu, Salmon Don and Spicy Salmon Don with onsen egg. Jack provided a very personalized service. He helped to plate the birthday cake that we brought and paid close attention to our needs. Thank you for the good dining experience."

The beef was quite cold and not hot the spaghetti my friend ordered was quite salty although service was alright.
Fresh sashimi and great service!,"Ordered their Foie Gras Hokkai don, oysters with garlic butter, tempura which were really fresh and of good quality. The premium beef steak which was really value for money... plus a big bonus for a wonderful dining experience is when you get warm hospitality and great service despite dining during the peak hour on a Friday night!"
Fresh Seafood that Melts in your Mouth,"First time visit to Tsukiji Fish Market with my boyfriend. Ordered Foie Bara Chirashi, Salmon Ikura Don and Spicy Salmon Roll for sharing. The food portion is just nice for 2. The salmon served was fresh and simply melts in mouth. The salmon roll was a unforgettable one; the salmon was so smooth that I thought I was taking meat butter. Certainly one of the best Japanese restaurants I visited this year!"
Tgif,"My husband tried to call for a waitress, few pass by but ignored my husband calling. But when we asked for a bill within 1 minute the bill is here."

Dinner,"A satisfying dinner with great portion! Ordered the collagen pot to share and there‚Äôs more than enough for 5 pax to share on top of one main dish each. There‚Äôs a happy hour promotion for the drinks before 8pm, worth it for those who like to drink!

The place is also conducive for group meet up as it wasn‚Äôt overly crowded and noisy. Great place to catch up with friends over a good dinner with a beautiful overview of the city landscape!

Birthday dinner,Staff was very attentive and friendly. Food was great and there was a variety of choices. Pricing wise very affordable and would definitely come back again!
"Food is ok, ambience is just like any other Japanese restaurant","We came here for lunch, the ambience is not so great. The restaurant was almost empty. Same kind of interior as you find in any other Japanese restaurant. We ordered salmon Sashimi, fresh oysters, super spicy Ramen and yuzu cocktail drink. The oysters were not fresh, it had very bitter taste at the end. I was not able to take it. Salmon sashimi was not bad. Ramen served was not hot. Though the taste was good. Cocktail was good not so sweet, just the way I like it. Overall I will rate 3 stars. May not return."
"Good food, nice ambience","Came on a weekday for lunch and had nice views from our window booth. Our sashimi was fresh, fried chicken was a little fatty but taste was ok. We had the spicy ramen with miso butter which was not bad too. Sushi selection is not that big but the sushi we ordered (spicy tuna fusion roll) was not bad too. Overall a nice dining experience."

Review,The service and food is very good.will be come here often and introduce to my group of friends n colleagues
Very good service,My girlfriend and I have been here many times and will highly recommend this place. Their food is great and their service is impeccable. The biggest memorable experience was Jack as he recognises and acknowledge us when we visit the restaurant each time! He has never failed to recommend dishes and also try his best to anticipate our request. It is a place worth visiting again and will definitely drop by again!
"Hidden Jem! Good value,food & best service","Varieties choice of food:Fresh n good value Cosy, friendly staffs with great service. Manager Jack is extremely helpful n never forget to refill our Sake. Will definitely be back with friends."
Cosy Jap Dining @ Central,Great varieties of food choices. Prompt and friendly staff. Boss is very nice and down to earthen Black pepper chicken is superb! Will be back to try more stuff!
"Always been a fan, but disappointed today.",Today's sashimi was a flop - got me thinking if the usual chef is away; cuts were not made like the usual. Rice was unevenly cooked. Will not consider ordering any dish with clams again as we had debris in our dishes.
Really good,Food is worth the value. Fresh ingredients and set meals were filling. Would come again and recommend to friends
Good Food,The food is especially good. Highly recommend the tempura set as the foods are fresh and incredibly tasty
Awesome with nice service,Awesome with nice service and fresh food being serve! Thx for trip advisor letting me know this Japanese restaurant
Great ambience for a Date Night,"The presentation of the food is great, it tasted terrific as well. More room for improvement needed on the alcohol content of the Yuzu Zhu-Hai cocktail. Agedeshi tofu was fair in presentation and taste. Spicy Ramen was indeed spicy. Signature tempura bowl was well presented and tasted just as nice. Grilled scallop with mentaiko sauce is a must-try delicious item. Last but not least, after being satisfied with the above, we ordered and tried the premium beef with Ponzu sauce, and was pleasantly impressed even with an almost-full stomach.

Service was fairly prompt, with room for improvement.

Overall price is fair for the quality of food and service rendered. Satisfied!

Great food and ambience!,"Love the Aburi foir gras maki! üëçüòäawesome food, great service! Superb location and awesome view! Would most certainly come back again!"
Food worst than food court,Food court even taste better than this. Totally disappointed with the purchase of chope voucher and recommendation in this platform
Great views from the roof top but food & service was not as great as the view.,"Hello beautiful people!

Tsukiji Fish Market is located on the roof top of Orchard Central and 2 of us had lunch here during the week. The restaurant just opened for lunch and there was 1 other table (3 people) when we entered. We were seated by the windows.

We started with fresh oysters (12 pieces) which was great and shishamo karaage, 5 kinds of sashimi, agedashi tofu, and 1 or 2 other small plates which I can't remember. If you like fresh oysters then you've come to the right place. Sashimi was okay, it was fresh but the tuna was anemic in color, it just didn't have the deeper red color that I'm accustomed to. Presentation of the sashimi needs to improve to make it more appetizing in my opinion, and having that anemic tuna doesn't help.

Agedashi tofu was good, so was the shishamo karaage. Now the service, the wait staff was pleasant, she seemed a little unsure of herself, perhaps she just started working there. There was a male staff on the floor assisting the wait staffs and I'm going to assume he's the manager or assistant manager. I would of liked to see him smile and not too stiff and also to ""touch tables"" to see how's things are going with guest's dining experience which he didn't do.

In the end, the dining experience was okay, it needs improvement. Only thing great was the view and that probably saved the restaurant."
