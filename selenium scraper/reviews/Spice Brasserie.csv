Tasty Crabs,"Crabs were the highlight and they did not disappoint. Crayfish/ slipper lobsters were good too. The mantou was a tad over fried . It spoilt the taste when eating with the chilli crab. The local dishes were below average.
Nothing much to shout at. This is an area for improvement. They could have added local desserts like chendol ."
Excellent food and spread,Excellent Christmas Day buffet spread. Dishes were tasty especially the Christmas special roasts and desserts. Very good pricing too!
Disappointed,"Went there to eat the Sin Ma buffet however, was being inform they are serving only festive buffet lunch.
What the....
Should had let known earlier even before proceeding into dining area as there are few more queuing in front of us. They simply just led everyone else in and inform when were at the table.
Though i reserve at chope, I actually reserve another date from the restaurant or hotel web which also, did not mention about the change.
Nothing to shout about for the price we paid for a festive buffet. Can't really understand where the festive comes into play, beside charging festive price"
Enjoy the Breakfast Much,"We like the spread of the breakfast. It caters to the local, Indian and international.
The place is spacious so that we did not feel over crowded despite the stay rate is high during our time.
There is slight change on the morning breakfast so that we will not find it boring and repetitive."
Reasonable price for satisfying crab craves,"It was a Thursday night dinner for colleagues. We enjoyed the fresh selection of crabs especially the bak kut teh pepper crab!!!The thick flavourful gravy laksa (it's just the way we liked it), satay, roasted meat, soup, salad, durian pengat, sashimi, jackfruit cake, self prepared muah chee was fun and the attentiveness of the servers to promptly clear our plates. We will be back again!"
Wide variety of food.,Menu is always interesting and new each day. Great food. great service. Very conducive for families travelling together. Perfect holiday accomodation.
Crab Lover Buffet,"Generally, I am not a fan of hotel buffets that serve pre-dominantly local cuisine. But I do love mud crabs, and this place definitely serves up plenty of crab in their dinner buffet.

There seems to be a fair number of reviews here that say their crabs are not fresh. For me, I am pretty sensitive to that ammonia smell that is associated with crabs that are not very fresh at all. Perhaps it was a good night when I dined there, because I did not detect any of that non-fresh situation that many others have cited here.

Off my memory, I recall sampling chilli crabs, white pepper crabs, salted egg yolk crabs, and a dry curry powder one. Out of the lot, my favourite would still be the chilli crab style, as I love me an eggy gravy. You can have as many deep fried buns to complement the sauce.

Whilst the crabs were pretty good, the one item in the buffet that I thought was really nice was the pig stomach soup. I really did not think that I would be having a good time slurping 2 very full bowls of their tasty and peppery pig stomach soup. If you are here for the buffet, please do not skip the soup, and have at least a bowl of it.

They also have sashimi and a few kinds of sushi, but I really did not think the sashimi was very good at all. Not sure why - perhaps it was the way the sashimi were poorly sliced in very odd and uneven shapes. It came across to be as a tad sloppy. And it did not taste as fresh as sashimi can be. Not that it tasted stale - just not very fresh.

The salad station was a yawn-fest. Did not even bother touching anything there.

I had a lot of fun at the DIY muah-chee station making my own muah-chee like how they do it at the pasar malam. As it can take some time to snip yourself up a pile of muah chee, I would not advise it if there is a queue. You can always return to have some when there is no queue.

As a whole, I feel that this buffet has some ups and downs. Luckily for me, the freshness of the crab was not an issue. The spread is so-so, and definitely could have more additions. For $68 nett per pax on weeknights, I was expecting a bigger spread."
First buffet since Covid-19,"My family wanted to have our very first buffet since C19 and decided on this. We were delighted with the variety and was especially looking forward to the sashimi and the crabs. We were disappointed to find that the crabs were not fresh and the chilli crab was not at all spicy, more like tomato crab. The rest of the food was good. Overall, we enjoyed the buffet, it was good value."
Disappointing Lunch,There was not much items on the buffet table. Not even pastries. The hokkien noddle was very soft and wet. And there is porridge with few accompanying dishes. It's quite a wierd buffet spread and rather doo away the porridge! The refill of the braised duck was like chicken which was not the usual dark brown color but whitish which showed that it's not cooked and marinated with braised sauce.... there were 4-5 types of crackers which does not make sense? Truly disappointing even for $25/nett per pax. I rather pay more for a better and more variety of buffet spread...
Great place but food is a disappointed. The service staff was great. But just the food is really bad.,Just disappointed with the food. The crabs not fresh. Usually I don’t complain at all. The staffs were great.
Not up to expectation,"Went there for a birthday dinner, not all food item listed on the menu was provided. Service were slow, so food items took a long time, their cooked crabs disappointed us the most, it wasn’t fresh at all, the taste also seemed a little off. Overall all I can say is that there’s way better option out there for the price paid."
Buffet dinner at Spice Brasserie at PARKROYAL on Kitchener Road,"We had dinner on 24 Sep Sat, was served by Subas for being helpful and nice. My mom wants to have the Nonya Kueh from the buffet however there was none left. Subas was observant and quickly when to the kitchen to take out and placed it at the buffet. He informed to my mom about the top up."
Inexperienced staff,"Staff asked to see Chope voucher number, I bought 2 vouchers in one receipt so I only have 1 voucher number. She is obviously inexperienced and is inpatient and kept insisting I should have 2 voucher numbers. She then peeped over to my email and asked rather rudely ""you sure 2 vouchers? how much you paid"". That is really rude. We thought things have settled after she took down the voucher number, but she came over again when we are almost done with the dinner. She questioned me the same exact thing - ""you should have 2 voucher numbers, where is the other one?"". I went through the email again and asked exactly how to claim as she wants us to claim. She took a glance at my phone and replied ""I come back later"". We ended up showing it to another staff and she had settled it in seconds. I am sure Chope vouchers should be quite commonly used, even if the staff does not know how it works and is unable to advise, her attitude is really bad."
"Options are limited, taste normal","Quite surprised that the variety of food they have are so limited i can even rmb each of it. The taste was normal, i can find better ones at any coffeeshop lol. but thumbs up to the chili crab but i cant be only eating that right. Totally not worth the money. Staff there dont even smile also"
Delicious food with great hospitality,"I had a great time eating delicious food at your restaurant. The waiters Raj and Subas were committed to great service and were very friendly. The
atmosphere was awesome and I definitely liked that you have a very modern
style. Most importantly, every food and drink on the buffet were awesome."
Buffet dinner,"I went for buffet dinner with my partner. Food spread worth the price. Service was excellent, and a special thank you to Serene, whom we thought was a part timer at the restaurant as she was not wearing the same uniform as others. Only until we chatted then we realised she's from the front office but helping out at restaurant. Very impressed by her service and attitude. Serene also constantly attended to us and ensuring we are being well taken care. Thank u, Serene and staffs. We will be back for staycation when hotel open."
worst buffet i ever had,"selection of food -
ambience -
service -
verdict - first and last
non-halal. not only that, pork dishes were serve together with what i called ""halal"" food although its a non halal restaurant. a big NO to those muslim guest."
Not worth the money,The buffet is good and with plenty to choose. Just not worth the 68$ per person. For that price you can eat a la carte in much better restaurants. Desserts were very good.
Awesome place for dinner!,Great food and great ambience. Discount w passion card was great! Highly recommended for friends and family!
Food and service,The food very delicious and nice. The prawn and crab very fresh. A lot variety of foods. The service also very good. Especially Kavi
Succulent crab buffet! It’s crazy!,"Large mud crabs cooked in 4 different styles. Big claws as big as child’s palm. Unlimited flow of crabs, replenish at short intervals. Wow. Service crew Ms Kavi is a wonderful hostess. Prompt service, chatty and smile always. Family enjoy the buffet dinner."
Good and Friendly Service Crew - Kavi,"Kavi is very friendly, approachable and would go the extra mile to serve us. Our family had a wonderful time at the restaurant."

Went there for my anniversary, the price is reasonable too. Loves the crab."
Mages.Kenny.Raj,Fantastic service and was very friendly and welcoming. Did his best to ensure we had a great time as a family. Thanks Kenny Raj!!!
Lousy seafood buffet,"Lousy seafood buffet yet charged so much for the bill, crab meat is not fresh at all and not much options to choose"
Cheap and Good Buffet,"The laksa, kueh pie tee, otah and desserts were lovely. Plates and bowls were cleared regularly. Special thanks to Phoebe for helping us with the popiah."

"Average, just very average","Quality seems to have dropped since they switch from ala carte buffet style to self serve

Quite pricey at $68 nett without oysters or lobsters on the menu, and the rest of the spread could not make up for it"

It was a very recommend buffet restaurant. I definitely give a 5-star"
Staff Bonding,"It was a pleasant evening with good food at Spice Brasserie. Well recommended. Warm hospitality given by Mages (AM), Helen."
online ordering a miss,We are given QR code to order certain dishes and drinks. Somehow orders are confirmed yet there are missing items. Very disappointing to know such services existed in this Era. Food is good but not the services rendered to us.
Had a enjoyable lunch!!,Though the spread is not much but quality cooking. Every dish is superb! Love the assam noodles and fried hokkien noodle though I'm not a fan but these 2 dishes were just too good that you want yo go.back again! Good job by the chefs! Service was prompt and attentive
Staff Bonding,Nice food! Good service. They are very accomodating. The restaurant was very clean. Thanks for the nice experience.
A very disappointing lunch buffet,I brought my mum to the buffet 2 days ago. It was the worst buffet I ever had. I felt so bad n embarrassed that I brought my mum there. I had wanted to give her a good lunch. Presentation of food was bad. I honestly would have had a better meal at a food court. The bakkut teh pork was rough n tasteless. We couldn't swallow the pork. The soup was diluted. The portion of spiced ngoh hiang served was pathetic... just about 3 to 4 tiny pieces on a big plate. The food was less than average. A bad experience.
Lunch at Spice Brasserie,"I seldom write reviews but today had a great lunch at Spice Brasserie. Food was good and service crew were exceptional. Led by Mages who was very courteous and accommodating to our requests.. so were his team, Melissa and Helen. Great job.."
Dinner,"Very good service. Food very nice. Good environment. Excellent service from Ms Helen , Mr Mages, Ms Stefanie , Ms Phone and Mr Kasim ."
Dinner at spice,"All Perfect.The dinner was delicious and service quality was provide by Mr Kazim,Ms Helen,Mr Mages, Ms Stefanie and Ms Phoebe."
Beautiful restaurant with delicious food,"I have visited Spice Brasserie a total of 4 times, every visit is filled with great array of food and friendly staff like Mages and Melissa. I especially enjoy the high tea set served at the end of the lunch. I look forward to many more visits to Spice Brasserie and highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a chill buffet lunch plus high tea set."
Nice dining experience,"Enjoyed our dining experience in a cozy ambience with friendly staff (Mages, Helen, Phoenix, Gobi). The lunch & tea break combi buffet is value for money. Will definitely recommend to friends on the good deal and visit in the near future."
Pleasant dining experience,Our first visit trying out the lunch buffet. We were super full with the selection as well as the high-tea set. Love the high-tea set presentation. Staff was attentive and 3ven suggest the high-tea set for takeaway. Indeed value for money. Will be back again.
Spice Brasserie,"Thank you Alex, Mages, Kumaran, Melissa, Raj, Helen & Subash for the superb service!
Brought my daughter here for her birthday celebration for her fav crab feast, definitely worth the price and service!"
Birthday Dinner,Excellent food and service. Amazing and very attentive staffs and crew specially Kumaran. Will definitely come back and refer to friends.
Pleasant Experience,"It was our family's first experience dining here. We instantly knew the service was great when we were greeted with the very first staff, a very friendly lady at the reception counter. Thank you for that. She was on duty at 12:30pm 26Feb (Saturday).

Food was enjoyable but varieties wise not really probably due to the pandemic. But overall still good!
One thing to commend would still be the Service. Every serving staff served with their Hearts. At the Pig's organ soup counter, the staff assisted to serve me a bowl of rice although it was not his counter to do so. Appreciate you going the extra mile. The pleasant experience made our experience a great one! Also grateful for a staff helping us to capture family photos too. Made our day..made my daughter's day. It was a memorable family meal to celebrate
her Birthday!;)"
Buffet Dinner,"A la crate buffet where you can order as much as you want from a menu chit before food is prepared and served to table in a satisfied portion. However, the crabs are not fresh that caused me to visit toilet after my dinner many times."
"good food, friendly staff","Not a big spread but everything was delicious, especially the desserts! we liked that we were able to walk around and get some food ie the buffet experience which was missed during the pandemic. Staff were friendly and accomodating. Overall a very nice experience"
Seafood &desert delicious ! Good environment,"I am so surprised about the service & environment & food.
To be honest, it’s a bit down when we go there due to the entrance,
Butttt after arriving destination!
Amazing restaurant environment, quiet & slowly but all be in good order!
Girls will love it.
Nice food ~"
Disappointing buffet selections,"For the price of $68 per pax, the selections were disappointing. Will not recommend to anyone nor revisit this outlet"
Brilliant,"I love this place. Atmosphere very good. Quality very good. Big chilli crabs. Very yummy. Enjoy very much.

Kenneth is so committed in his job. Very thankful for him. Thanks also kumaran for his warm service. Gobi is very hospital, professional. Great team working there."
Best Buffet for Crab Lovers at Spice Brasserie,"We had a fabulous buffet dinner at Spice Brasserie last Friday. Wow surprisingly, 4 types of incredibly tasty crabs; chilli, kam-heong, creamy tom-yam and mongolian — all were distinctively flavourful !! Indeed, one of the best buffet dinner in town for any crab lovers. I sincerely compliment the chefs who cooked the delicious food, and would highly recommend this awesome restaurant. My family had an enjoyable dinner and the service was great too."
The Delicious Food Experience at Spice Brasserie,"Fantastic dishes, excellent savoury culinary quality! Leave wanting nothing more! <3
My bowl of lemon hand-wash was there even before I started ordering the delectable chilli & salted egg crab! Ooo la la! I wish I could give more stars! Each dish was carefully thought out, seasoned / pared & cooked to perfection! The grilled lamb was so soft & tender, it melts! I ate it with my chopsticks! Their desserts are an amalgamation of flavours and a work of art! Their log cake tastes like premium ice-cream cake! They even prepared more dessert surprises than their qr menu listed! Their food presentation is detailed & exquisite! & even the app guarded against food wastage by allowing one to order only 6 dishes at a time. But of course one is allowed to order 6x whatever is the amount! They even have healthy beverages, non-sugared tea with lemon & cold water before each person is seated at their table! <3<3<3 And I'm just beginning to list the menu! On the way out the choruses of Happy New Year will be sure to leave you beaming from ear to ear!!! Be sure to thank their staff lots! They love their job!!! :))))))) Memorable and very fresh delightful food! Thank you! Yum-my! Excellent & thoughtful service! Everything is done to perfection!"
Good customer services and nice food for buffet,"1st thing 1st, the lady Ms Jenny who answered my reservation call is very polite and helpful.
This is my 1st visit to this restaurant, On the day of dinning, Mr Kenneth explained clearly on how to use QR code to order foods and recommended some signature dishes. He will walk around to check and chat with customers if everything is in place, making sure the foods are on its way.
Lastly is the food is beyond our expectations, is so yummy, especially the Buffet cold favorite and desserts- Garden fresh lettuce with Yuzu dressing, Durian pengat with sticky rice & teppanyaki chocolate ice cream"
Excellent service and festive food,"My family & I thoroughly enjoyed our Christmas lunch at Spice Brasserie. Incredibly friendly and efficient service, quality food ordered by QR code and delivered to the table - nicely presented and in just the right small portions. Fantastic team & concept this year! Highly recommended."
Awesome Ala Carte Buffet at Spice Brasserie,"This is my absolute favourite restaurant. Ambiance is cozy, food is amazing and the service is unmatched. The staff are efficient, friendly and polite. Love the tasty food and will continue to visit."

Good Service at Spice Brasserie,"Had very good service from Ki Ki and Helen, although they were busy they tried their best to ensure we were well taken care of.
Thank you Ki Ki and Helen !"
Family dinner at Spice Brasserie,"We had dinner last night with family. Service was great all staff were very polite and attentive. Our dishes selection was quick to arrive to the table.

Personally appreciated the simple order system, choosing food items from the list, handing it over to team vs. using the QR code to scan. It is simple, kudos!
Food was good, prawns were large and juicy, char siew and siu yoke yummy. Prawn laksa was fragrant, tasty and a nice portion. Chilli, Salted egg crab was full and delicious.

On tables, were jars of ice tea and water. Buffet comes with hot tea/coffee.
We made the reservation via hotel site, promo for 4 persons.

Special mention to manager, Kenneth for his polite and professional manner and his entire team.

I've recommended this place to 2 groups of friends already.
Thanks for a great evening!"
"Spice Brasserie Buffet Dinner at ParkRoyal Kitchener, Singapore","My family enjoyed one of the best buffet dinner at Spice Brasserie. There is variety of delicious food : chilli & salted egg crabs were phenomenal! The other items were prepared on point - tasted just right not overly done with salt. We enjoyed the desserts too.
We also remember the excellent service provided by the staff which made that dining experience memorable.

Spice Brassreie is definitely recommended place to go for."
Spice brasserie buffet,"The customer service and cleanliness are excellent! Saw this FAVE voucher for $45.65 nett and decided to buy it. Otherwise, the price will be $58++. I prefer the salted egg crab to the chilli crab. Unlike other hotel buffet, the crabs here are bigger and much fresher. The chilli sauce for the crab is also a little spicy whereby other hotels are more like ketchup crab. One of the best crabs I had for hotel buffet. The durian pengat is great! The chempalat cake is very authentic that cannot be tasted anywhere else. Satay is soft and juicy except the beef which is a little tough. Food are less salty but still delicious. Clams and gonggong are not fantastic though. Desserts - ah boling in peanut soup, muahchee, ice cream, are all excellent! Thumbs up! Love the wide spread of variety. I’m now too full to walk!"
Spice Brasserie,"Food very fresh, service very good thank you Helen for the good service ,today salted crab super yummy"
Family lunch,Today ate at Spice Brasserie. Used Chope 1 for 1 lunch promotion. Service is very good. Food is not bad. It is value for money. Will consider to go again.
Dinner buffet,Good service. Very good food . Spread from burgers to chili crab. Roast meat was excellent. Dessert is to die for.
Revisit experience: Consistently good!,"It has been about 5 months since our last visit, we decided to revisit again and our verdict was - consistently good! (during the 5 months, we have visited it's sister restaurants, such as Lime, Ginger and others like Colony, Food Capital, Ellenbourough etc, do check my reviews on them too, posted earlier)

We are food gourmets and enjoy dinning and are regulars to this restaurant for the last 15 years and have witnessed drastical changes to it, in terms of layout, theme, decor and must say, the current setup was the best and most cosy and lovely.

As it was weekend, the restaurant was quite full, considering the implementation of the social distancing. The ambienace was great.

And the spread and quality of food were consistently good. As usual, the seafood platter, chilli crabs, roast meats were fresh and well cooked. The burgers, laksa, deep fried prawns, grilled prawns, satay, pasta with truffles were all very nice. The soup of the day was watercress with pork ribs, it was savoury and flavourful!

The same went for the dessert and the must try was the ice cream, durian penget, muah chee and grilled pineapples. The pastries were nice, though a little too sweet for me and our senior citizens. (the chocolates were extremely nice and flavourful though too ""hard"" for our senior citizens)

There are still many other dishes that we didn't try as we mainly focus on those we like and left out those ""indian cuisines"" in particular and the western food like steak and lamb as we tend to avoid red meats for health reasons.

Services were excellent. Staff were friendly and extremely efficient in serving food and clearing used plates very often from time to time, to the extend we felt it was just too much for the servers! Other than our very 1st order of the day when we had to wait a little longer than expected, the food served from our subsequent orders had sped up and quite prompt.

The manager in charge, Kenneath, did come by our table as he could remember us from our last visit and initiated conversations to solicit feedback on the food. And one of the good thing was that the restaurant, unlike many others, still have the ordering through paper (with menu), something senior citizens in particular would welcome, rather than ordering over phone or QR code scanning, as they maybe less IT savvy. This is a good gesture.

Btw, the restaurant is still practising the ""ala carte buffet"" (meaning you order the food and they will serve them to your table), but it's sister restaurant, Ginger, has resumed the ""take yourself"" buffet since 15 April, and I hope in time to come, this place will do the same, which I believe will be greatly welcomed by diners.

We had a great dinning here and it was extremely value for money considering the spread and quality of food. And again, we will surely return, probably visiting other restaurants next, and hoping that they will be able to keep up with the good work!"
Ala carte Buffet @Spice Brassiere,"Nice ambience n good customer service.
Food quality is good n fresh.
Delicious dessert, durian sticky rice n cempedak"
Family Lunch at Spicy Brasserie!,"Food is good, service is good, staff very accommodating. Very enjoyable experience, dessert is the one to look out for."
When you dun expect anything but it wow u,"The chilli crab is rly marvelous, so meaty and even have crab roe.
Love sashimi as well, fresh!
And last but not least the dessert station! Dutian Pengat & cempedak cake rly give a wow! Its smth u dun rly find in other hotel buffet
Service staffs were all excellent
Kudos to Mages, Helen, Kumaran, Kenneath and especially Mr Sabas who rly serve us well ! I can feel his smile even he is mask covered ☺️
They rly did a wonderful service and give us a great welcome vibe."
Weekend Buffet,There’s a variety of seafood selection for us to choose Manager and staffs are also very friendly and helpful! Will definitely come back here to dine again. Thank you for making our evening such a wonderful day:)
Amazing buffet!,"Really value for money at 48++ a person. Seafood, sashimi, grilled items, Indian cuisine and a very good dessert selection. The food quality is surprisingly good; they even have Ramly burgers as part of the buffet. Great service!"
Birthday Dinner,"The truffle noodle in Spice Brasserie is the best noodle of all that i have ate. The creamy rich truffle mixed with the noodles gives a sensation of satisfaction.
I strongly recommend the durian pengat with sticky rice and getting a large portion of Cempedak Crumble Cake for example (15) is the best as the more we have the more feeling of the cempedak taste it will, be like how we always did.

Don’t Play Play, come and try, promise no regrets!"
Great dinner experience!,"Visited Spice Brasserie for a weekend dinner and was not disappointed! Excellent food choices! The BBQ food selection had great smoky flavour and the seafood was fresh and delicious!
Staff were also extremely attentive, especially Kenneth, Mages, Helen and Zian Ping who attended to us. Great service! Always ready to change our plates or refill our drinks when needed. Would recommend to everyone to visit!"
Weekend buffet,"It’s my second time here.The service here is excellent, good food good environment. The variety of food is wide!"
Nice food with cozy atmosphere,"We went there for lunch. Love the chili crab, sashimi and durian penyet!
Prompt and polite service. Will visit again!"
Lunch on Easter,"This is a very good value buffet, with unlimited servings of fresh sashimi and sweetened by the Chope 1 for 1. I also found their indian cuisine to be surprisingly good! The grills, which are marketed as their speciality, are fairly average because i had a few pieces of steak which were just too tough on a skewer. Service is a little slow though, perhaps due to a few part timers. For example, i was one of the first to order but my neighbouring table was served much faster.

All in all, worth a second trip if they still have the one for one."
Room for improvement,"Taking advantages on the Chope offer 1-for-1 to try the lunch buffer on Sunday, overall experience was disappointed. The waitress misplaced our ordered dishes to other table and we have verified with the them for twice on the food status but they are reluctantly response to us"
Great services and good food,"The price is reasonable. And the service is excellent. The food is very delicious.
Highly recommend!"
A la carte dinner buffet,"Nice service, reasonable price, a wide range of options, a good place to host foreign friends. The best was the lotus pork rib soup and the beef rib fingers"
