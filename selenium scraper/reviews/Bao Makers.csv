Excellent service!!,The food was amazing and the service was even better! The staff knew their menu well and gave great recommendations.
Amazing food and incredible service,"Amazing food, both the bao's, fried rice and sushi. The guy that served and incredible service an was so friendly."
Delicious & thoughful buns! The best in town,Ordered the tasting platter & love all the different flavours. The portion is perfect for 2 people so you can share & try all flavours. The texture of the buns is soft & perfect
Highly Recommended,The food was very good and worth the price. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Tables for parties of 2 could be bigger though.
Great Food,Great Food and Services. Just the environment a bit too pack. Overall satisfied and recommended. Will revisit again
Must go for bao lovers!,Bao Platter is a must try and value for money too. Variety of food options available as well. Good atmosphere for a good meal with friends as well.
Authentic Singapore Touch With Chili Crab Bao,Chili crab bao is one of my favorites in the restaurant with sweet and tomato-ist flavor added little spicy touch to make taste bold. Other Japanese dishes are impressive too.
Good ambience,This branch around Keong Siak is much more comfortable compare to Westgate... loves the restaurant deco and a good place to catch up with frens. We tried the tasting set for the bao and they were really tasty
Restaurant Week worthy!,"Went for restaurant week at Bar Makers.
Food was delicious!
chilli crab and salted egg bao were delicious.
they had beef steak on foie gras and daikon which was 100/100 amazing!
Will go back again.
Price on average to high side.
Service was just on the slower side which was the only gripe."
Nice Concept of BAOs set,"Attracted by the concept store serving buns with flavours. Ordered e BAOs set wif greenie + edamame + a drink. Liked the salted egg chix, salmon mentaiko but not the oily chilli crab bun. Friend shared e blackened chix niCe too. We top-up $3 for Singapore Latte Peng + so-so sweet jelly. Good for chillax over afternoon Tea."
Warm and Friendly service,"Our 1st time at this restaurant and we are very happy with the service. Staff were warm and friendly.
Food overall was good except the fried bun was oily. The beef Sando could have been better if its minced beef or grill beef rather than fried."
Westgate outlet,"Simple , small cafe at corner of westgate after lady M. The baos had pretty presentation. Bite size but delicious.chilli crab bun tastes good."
Recommended for friends and family,"I love the atmosphere and ambient of the place. Quiet and cozy. The cafe is small but overall is good.

I like the salmon mentaiko nap due to the soft bao texture. I dislike fried bao.
Salmon Mentaiko roll is best, literally melts in my mouth. Highly recommend.

Lychee cold the drink is good, the tea and lychee combination is good. Soothing and calming."
Surprisingly lovely gem of a place!,"Quaint venue off with a lovely modern vibe. Service was great - fast & super friendly! Loved the mixed bao we ordered - blackened chicken was standout for me. The Beef Sando was another standout although sashimi - whilst good value - was just so-so for me. Desserts were also very memorable and I was very satisfied with Red Sangria (also quite unexpectedly good). Will definitely return again for great tasting, good value food."
Worth a try,It would be good if there are more vegetarian options on e menu. Overall the food is great. Serving time is longer than expected.
Very nice food and reasonably priced,"I tried this place at the suggestion of a colleague. I had sushi and a few baos. All was excellent, drinks included. Plus, it’s quite cheap for Singapore’s standards"
"The bao concept is exciting but alas, underwhelming","I only ordered their pork belly bao to evaluate their “standard” since they claim to be good in bao (implied claim given the name of the restaurant). If Westlake bao gets 10/10, then this would be a 8.5. The meat could be more tender. What added an interesting perspective is the use of garlic crumbs, though I’d prefer Chinese parsley. Minimal gravy.

The lobster pasta was fantastic - they got the taste just right! A tad too oily. As for the crabmeat pasta, too bad the crab meat came in morsels - looked ugly and tasted so so.

They ran out of chicken wings (it’s 6.30pm on a Saturday!?!?!), so we tried their crispy octopus. It’s alright: 7/10. Too much flour. Octopus pieces were cut to too tiny portions.

The table was definitely too small for two people. If we add one more side dish, we’ll have no space for anything else. Out main course dishes were already protruding way out of the table boundaries. This is bad.

Cups for water were so small (the daiso cups) they had to be constantly refilled. Oh, I had to call for them at least three times throughout my meal.

What a pity, overall. I thought this place has got some potential."
Great Bao,"We orderes a tasting platter which consist of 3 baos which we can choose our flavours. Truffle mushroom is still juicy after shallow frying, nice truffle smell. Pork belly taste like the traditional kong ba bao and the salmon metaiko goes very well with the bao. I side ordered charcoal chicken, on the sweet side.
The plating is cute, tiny bao in a nice tiny plate. I would however, give the rice bowl a miss. Rice is too moist and with the mayo sauce on the bowl, it is hard to swallow after a few bites."
Good place to chill,"Ordered their tasting bao set, and their chilli crab bao is the most delicious out of the others. Their crabmeat agile olio to me is the best. It has hae bee hiam taste. The truffle mushroom pasta is not bad. The lychee drink is great too.
I think this outlet has a different menu compared to the others. The service is not bad but quite slow in serving food. Tables may be abit too small if you are ordering a few dishes for sharing."
"Highly recommended, food were","Highly recommended, food were great. Excellent service! Host (Esther) was pleasant and attentive. Great place! Will come back again. Do look out for Esther!"
"Great food, some minor inconveniences","Came in on a Sunday with 4pax and had to wait approx 5 Min for a table as its walk in only on the weekend. No problem though. Very nice ambiance inside the restaurant. We ordered a couple of baos, Sushi, truffle fries, Karaage chicken balls and nori „tacos“. Nori tacos came after only 5 min before any drink was served. All the food was served as soon as it was finished. So It all came at different times which is not ideal when you want to eat with your friends. There were about 40 people dining in the restaurant but there was only one bartender and she, understandably, wasn’t able to hold up with the demand of drinks. One drink came after 15 min, then another one 5 mins later and so on. But they all were incredibly delicious as was the rest of the food. Sadly they didn’t bong our truffle fries so we had to reorder and wait about another 15 mins after we already finished our baos and sushi for them to arrive. The baos all were super delicious but our favorite was by far the salted egg chicken bao.
The prices are also not too high when you consider the quality of the ingredients.
In conclusion: Excellent food but organization and service have some room for improvement.
Give it a try when you are in the area :)"
In for a treat on the tastebuds,"Been wanting to try this place after wandering in one day to grab a takeaway coffee - the coffee was decently made.

So, wandered back here on a weekday for lunch and the vibe again was really nice & chill. Some crowd, but not ‘overcrowded’ - tables were spaced & comfortable. Service was attentive and the Japanese-Chinese fusion food was ok. Some dishes were great, while others were a hit & miss.

We tried their
- wagyu sando, which came with crispy lotus root chips. Thumbs up. Bread was heavily buttered, so a ton of umami, yet toasty & the beef was nice & crusty
- bun sandwiches (salted egg chicken, black truffle mushroom, belly pork & blackened chicken). Have to say, only the blackened chicken was nice - blackened with seaweed which gave its flavour a slightly different dimension and there was enough chicken in the bun. The buns were all fluffy & soft, which was great. But the salted egg chicken could do with a slightly bigger portion of chicken to have each bite with chicken, the truffle mushroom could be lighter on the truffle (the flavour was overpowering), and the belly pork could be lighter on the five spice (also overpowering). Because the sandwiches are small & the buns light accompaniments, each bite packs a punch on flavouring, so a lighter-hand on the ingredients’ seasonings would be just right!
- passionfruit & sangria drinks. The passionfruit one was refreshing and rounded, balanced nicely with the sharpness of the dried grapefruit.

Nice effort in mixing up the cuisines. Overall, would go back though to try their rice bowls and their sago/other drinks (their bar is larger than their kitchen :)"
I wished they had told me...,"It was our first time here today because I had cravings for gua bao. I wished they had told me the Bao set is now available all day because the menu stated it’s available from 12pm till 3 pm. We ordered 3 Bao by itself for dinner, only to find out later on the table next to us ordered two Bao set (the set includes 3 bao + edamame + salad) after we finished our meal. Disappointed with the service but happy with the food."
Good lunch set,"I ordered the salmon rice lunch set due to some miscommunication with the cashier girl. Was expecting Japanese styled salmon don from the photo review, but it was more like Chinese rice set. Not that it is not nice. The rice was quite a lot and fragrant, the salmon, I think poached with ginger and soy was fresh and tasty. The salad sauce was sour and refreshing, really help with the appetite. Nice fresh lemon tea (not the super sweet powder kind) to accompany the meal too. The only thing I didn't like was the egg, it was raw and quite eggy smelling, urgg... overall set lunch is quite worth it."
Delicious Bao,"The ambiance of the restaurant was cosy, with soft lighting and wide spaces. In fact, it does seems more like a bar than a restaurant, if you ask me.

Their speciality is the Bao, a steamed Chinese bun. A whole page on the menu is dedicated to them, with different fillings. As a non-seafood and non-red meat eater, I chose chicken as a filling, so I had the Blackened Chicken Bao (steamed sesame bun, house blend garlic mayo, seasoned charcoal fried chicken meat). It was delicious and a very good choice, with a soft bun and succulent chicken meat.

As I had a dinner companion with me, we decided to share a Bonito Fries (Tonkatsu, mayo, bonito flakes). The portion is huge, and definitely to be shared. For a main dish, the Kecap Manis Chicken rice bowl (deep-fried chicken cubes, kecap manis marinate, onsen egg) was for me. Again, it was satisfying.

Together with attentive service, I would give this gem of a restaurant a second visit."
Excellent bao,Excellent food. I very much enjoyed the baos. Very tasty! They also serve very refreshing juices and delicious desserts.
A good one for your to-do list,"A really good place to take just about anyone. The setting is surprisingly intimate considering the wide open space, and the food is the highlight of the show with some really tasty baos. The maki rolls are also worth pointing out. Strongly recommend getting a variety of baos from the tasting menu as they are all unique. Only negative point is for the service (no interaction with the guests, missed orders, and just generally left by yourself unless you call). Still though, this is a memorable place."
Lovely line up,4.4 out of 10. Gorgeous place. Beautiful modern Asian fusion here. We had four baos for the assembled which were each excellent. Same story with the bowls. The food was terrific overall. Same story with the service and the location and the presentation of the place. Highly recommended.
Great food in stylish setting,"We went on a midweek night when it seemed to be mostly couples, but our family table didn’t seem awkward or out of place.

The setting has an Instagramable quality to it, the minamilist, tastefully lit bar sets off the whole place nicely. The “whole place” is probably about 30 covers, so it’s small without being tiny. That lends itself to being a good setting for couples, but also small groups.

The food is really tasty and, if you’re well travelled, it’s something quite different. There are some unique dishes that are must-tries and some more recognizable items. I loved the Chilliest crab bao, the beef dishes were incredible. Even a bowl of rice has seasoning on it that makes it a dish in itself. The originality and Asian fusion nature makes any description of the food difficult for me. But let’s just say: I will be going back!!

Highly recommended."
Like watching paint dry,"Restaurant not even close to half full but waited almost 45 mins for some average bao for lunch.

Was like watching paint dry seeing one dish served every 5 minutes. Including 5 mins between my meal and my wifes... she was finished before mine arrived.

We were planning to order more but couldnt deal with the wait - also not great bao fillings."
Hot mess,"Food service is slow , got the order wrong multiple times , have to chase multiple times for every order Can't recommend , given that it was half empty at the time"
Bao,Visited on a Saturday evening for dinner and the place is quite crowded with every tables filled. Ordered the chilli crab bao and the bao it reminded me of fried man tou! Tried their rice bowls and the portion is a bit small. Overall nice experience but I prefer my traditional kou rou bao any day
"Lovely meal, highly recommended","Bao makers, as the name suggests, specializes in Bao. They have 7 kinds: Chili Crab, Salted Egg, Salmon Mentaiko, Veggie, Mala Beef, Blackened Chicken and Pork Belly. Apart from that, they have sides, appetizers, sashimi and sushi rolls for sharing and even two pasta dishes.

We ordered the Truffle Fries, Chili Bao, Salmon Mentaiko Bao and Blackened Chicken Bao and also Cheeseburger Spring roll. None of the dishes disappointed us. Each Bao was made perfect with the right sauce and texture. Ie, chili crab bao bread was fried like a mantou while the Salmon Mentaiko bao was the normal white bao.

Truffle fries portion was large and taste was not overpowering. The Cheeseburger in spring roll was a pleasant surprise because it tasted really like cheeseburger especially when you pair it with the mayonnaise that comes along with the dish.

Worth a try and I'll be back for more, probably to try out their lunch bowls :)"
1st and also the last time......,"Was at Keong Siak street on 19th Feb for lunch. Saw the restaurant and wifey exclaimed that this is one of her To Do Lunch list place. Went in and got a table in a flash as we are the 1st patrons of the day. Place the order for a Bao combo set (Wifey) and a beef rice bowl (Myself) with 2 glasses of cold roasted green tea. Another group of 3 ladies came in right behind us and their orders were also promptly taken care.

15mins later came the 1st dish, the Bao combo. I waited for another 15mins before asking the waitress regarding the beef rice bowl and she said she will check with the kitchen. Another 10mins later, all I can see was the other table (3 Ladies) orders were being fulfilled and there's still no sight of my beef rice bowl. Waved at the waitress again and was appalled by the answer that the kitchen forgot my order.

Hungry and upset, I asked for the bill. Left the place and told my wife this will be the 1st and also the last time I will ever patronized this place. I cannot accept the kind of sub standard service that this place delivered. I will STRONGLY not recommend this restaurant. Visit at your own risk."
Gone up a notch,"We first visited this place when it launched late last year. Now in its 6th month it’s turned a corner and it’s fast becoming a go to place in the Keong Saik enclave of amazing restaurants. Really nice and relaxed ambience, and unpretentious. Great for lunch and, as I’m quietly trying all the lunch bowls sets, I haven’t been let down yet. The coffee is also from roasted man so fantastic for one to one client meetings.

One fault, I wish they could accept AMEX."
Friends gathering,Nice ambience with good service. Perfect for a girls night out. The team platter at $100 is well-worth for sharing (4 to 5 pax). Love the steak in the platter! Juicy and tender... thumbs up!
No Big Deal,"Location: Located at the Keong Saik area of Outram. If you're not driving / cabbing, it would require a bit of walking.

Food: Ordered the classic bao, salted soft-shell crab bao, spicy crab meat spaghetti and beef bowl. It could be that because I make these baos too, I find it just mediocre. For those salted-egg lovers, the salted-egg soft-shell crab is disappointing. The taste of salted-egg is simply too mild and lacking in taste. It's more milky and diluted than having that savoury salted-egg taste and slightly grainy texture (I look for when ordering salted-egg to ensure they're using real salted eggs to make it). The spicy crab meat spaghetti, although generous in crab meat, the taste is not well-balanced. It's only spicy but lacking in sweetness to balance off the spicy taste. Also, it's a little bland. The beef bowl is just alright, meat is a little chewy and tough with a lot of tendon.

Price:Quite overpriced for something simple and lacking in quality

Services:Kind and attentive wait staff

Ambiance: A nice and cozy place. Perfect for gathering with friends as seating is spacious

Verdict: I couldn't feel the heart and soul in the taste of food or meal preparation. Felt like they're only churning out their orders for the sake of serving hungry people. Typically of a food fad. The food is really just average."
"tad pricey, but you pay for the novelty, food quality and ambience","visited on a sunday afternoon and the spacious cafe was rather empty (only 2 other tables occupied). love the clean and minimalistic cafe interior, which is also very spacious, and the staff were very friendly and responsive.
tried 4 different flavours of their baos, the chili crab, namba chicken, salted egg yolk chicken, and pork belly. The chili crab is more on the sweeter size, but they're so generous with the crab meat, and the fried bun was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, so good! Had high expectation for the salted egg yolk chicken, but it wasn't ""salted egg yolky"" enough for me. Pork belly was decent, just as expected while the namba chicken tasted a little off (according to the BF). Somehow the Japanese tartar sauce and fried chicken and the steamed buns just didn't complement each other that well.
Bao Makers have tried their best to be as generous with the servings (the fried chicken fillet is almost twice as big as the steamed bun, and the chili crab filling was stuffed to the max), but they're still greatly limited by the standard (tiny) size of those chinese steamed buns, hence having to pay almost $7 for such palm sized 'burgers' does feel quite pricey.
Choice of desserts is quite limited (they only have 2 kinds), but the cookie bomb was aptly named, for it's DA BOMB. It's impossible for their coffee to not be good, since they're supposedly using common man beans. Highly recommend that you try the SIngapore Latte Peng if you're good with sweet coffees."
"Tad overpriced, understaffed","We we're both stunned by the size of the food servings, my friend more as he'd been there before and thought the already measly sandwiches had gone through the dryer again.

The taste was there, us having the salted egg shrimp and some other bao. But at $7 for each whiff, they couldn't expect a lot of repeat business.

Nor was the demand huge when we lunched there. Yet service was slow on water fillups and attention low on our request to share the portions. Just one gal running around serving, one cashier, and possibly one chef."
It’s just too nice!,"I think the title says it all. I’m blown away by the creativity and the taste of each bao. Even the crab pasta, it was soo nice! The drinks are good quality as well. Didn’t taste much of the syrup. Overall, I just love it!"
Lovely baos!,Lovely place for meals. I love the baos (buns) presented in a different way as compared to traditional ones. The iced teas were great! The stuffings in the buns had different flavors. The salmon baos tasted really great!
Really nice,"We saw Bao Makers on here and thought it looked nice so gave it a try. It was a fair distance on the rail and then the walk though China Town but it was well worth it.
This is a very nice, clean and friendly restaurant. Staff were really good and we were seated and given a menu. We ordered and paid at the bar. I had a crab bao and pork belly bao with a beer. My partner had the same with a coke.
Food was made fresh and arrived quickly.
The food here was great... so so so good. I could have happily ordered more, but I was so full! Really flavoursome!
This is a really really good place, service really good, the baos here are great and not too expensive.
It is a bit of a wander through China Town but well worth the walk, you will not be disappointed.
I would highly recommend Bao Makers"
"Casual clubhouse feel, serving good food at fair prices","The rice bowl of salmon mentaiko is not bad; the pasta bowl with beef strips was delightful. Each below 17sgd; and filling. THe truffle fries topped with parmesan shavings made a good appetizer.
Clean and spacious interiors; I can imagine this a good venue for families and social gatherings."
Great Ambience & Affordable Prices,"Came here for Valentine’s Day and were amazed how we were even able to get a table here on hindsight seeing what a great experience we had. Service staff were friendly and prompt, loved the dim orange lighting and decor, food was surprisingly good at these competitive prices - we had 4 glasses of wine, a mojito, the steak, truffle fries with a chili crab bao and a salted egg yolk chicken bao, cream spinach, golden sand mushrooms, all for $128 on a Valentine’s Day night. Would come back again."
Great little place in Tanjong Pagar,"Lunch menu revolves around baos and rice bowls with some pasta options. We've tried two different baos and a bowl and they were all very tasty and very affordable.
Decoration is modern clean and although the place is not that big its feels very spacious, with some room between the bar and the tables.
During dinner hours it turns into a steakbar but the baos stay in the menu, pairing with mojitos. Will definitely go back to try this combo!"
Interesting Concept with Limited Menu Offerings,"The concept is an interesting one, replacing bread with buns for their burgers. I adore the chilli crab flavour one in particular. After awhile however, I started feeling sick as all the food items apart from the salad were deep fried. A real pity that the salmon in my rice bowl was also fried, even though salmon is already an oily fish."
Great Value,"Great place to order a few dishes to share and a bao each to not share. That they're moving to a ""better"" location is testimony to this café's success."
Super good food,Value for money and friendly staffs. would visit again soon. good selection of good as well. Love the creativity!
"bao was nice, but portion was small","ordered 3 baos and a serving of truffle fries. was empty on a friday at 6.30pm. got the salted egg chicken, salted egg prawn and chilli crab pau. were quite yummy/"
Thumps up!,"The Bao are fantastic..especially the salted egg shrimp bao. Overall the food get 4 stars. But the place itself not great. Too much echoes, it made the place too noisy to sit down for a good meal, can only get 1 star."
Food was awesomeeee,"Food was really good and unique. Will head back for more! Desserts were really unique too, love them!"
Yummy bao's,"The bao's were delicious and so tasty, service was great too. Thank you for helping my weekend hangover!"
Unique & Yummy,"Tasty, unique (yes, despite the preponderance of similar hipster cafes) fusion food with great presentation to match. Reasonable pricing also makes The Bao Makers worth returning to. 5 stars!"
Quality BAO!,"The bao is fluffy, unlike what I always had from the supermarket and it wont stick to your teeth. Been patronizing Bao Makers every now and than, update menu, price still so reasonable. Service staff was friendly but not over friendly. Definitely a place to visit for its not so common cafe menu."
Good for families and gatherings,Nice and cosy for gatherings big & small. Reasonably priced with good quality food. Food bites/appetizers snd Desserts could do with a wider range.
Good! Will return again,"We went there with a $30 voucher gotten from Chope. We ended up topping up $17 more because we wanted to try more. We had 2 buns, chili crab and salted egg prawns. They were so good! Chili crab was just nice, not too sweet and slightly spicy. Crab meat and prawns were both fresh and they didn't skimp on the amount. Buns were not soggy either. We also ordered the seafood carbonara which was just the right amount, pasta al dente, again, they don't skimp on the ingredients. The seafood were nicely charred and fresh. We had 2 homemade iced teas as well. They were refreshing and good. Skip the truffle fries though, it's just normal, not much truffle oil in it. Overall, the food is great and worth the price paid for. Good for sharing or individual. Will recommend and return again!"
Special cafe,"Love to try this interesting cafe which specialization in differ type of bao. Tried the chili crab and salted egg chicken bao, love it"
Chinese bao w a lot of twist,I'm in love w the chilli crab bao and the Salted egg shrimp bao. I'm glad that I've truffle fries at a lower rate when I order the two bao. Very delicious n it's a great afternoon to spent here before swimming at Jalan besar swimming pool!
Good food,2nd time here because I really really love their truffle fries!!! IT'S SO YUMMY and not forgetting their innovative baos as well!
Great and interesting food,Good combination of local favours with traditional chinese kon-bak Bao. Hope the restaurant keep improving to add more different tasteof Bao to the menu
Bao Makers is good,Bao Makers is good! Food portion is abit small. Ordered 2 buns. Location is more accessible with car.
Love their chili crab bao,"$5.90 for savoury bao, I would say its pretty decent and affordable.

I ordered chili crab bao, salted egg shrimp bao, BBQ pulled pork burger and salmon mentai bao.
All were pretty good but I think the pulled pork burger fall short to our expectations.
I would highly recommend the remaining three baos."
Good place,Food is quite good. Food choice is not much but they are generally ok in taste. Staff are nice. Good place to chat with friends
Local with a twist,"The pork belly bun (kong bak bao) is the legacy of the Hokkien in Singapore. The meat is a tad dry and not fatty enough. We also ordered the chilli crab bun which is probably the best of the lot we had. The salted egg sauce drizzled on the deep fried chicken is delish but the charcoal bun was soaked and too soft.

Nice ambience and cafe. Service was friendly and efficient."
"Nice Bao, Main so-so","Service was good. We tried the chilli crab bao and salted egg chicken bao.. the chilli crab dip needs more work, was watery and lacks ommph but the salted egg was super nice! Tried the seafood carbonara, a little too creamy for my liking. THe pork belly don was alright though it had a little too much garlic on top."
Enjoyable time,Food was surprisingly good. Loved the Don salmon and creamy mushroom pasta. Enjoyed their ice tea best!! Comfortable ambience.
Good food and chillax ambience,Come here for the salted egg chicken bao and beef steak don :) The food was overall quite good and my friends and I liked the atmosphere here.
Interesting concept!,A lovely cafe with nice ambience and a varied menu. Food prices were nett and good value. We tried the salted egg chicken bao and the chili crab bao. Both were yummy but quite rich! The mentaiko salmon bowl was yummy :)
Dinner date,Food was okay but i thought it was a little pricey for the portion. Will recommend the soft shell crab and the watermelon and cucumber tea.
Excelent choice,"Very cousy,clean and charmy... we choose this restaurant because is near of your hotel. Good options and is cheap."
Bao made delicious,"BAO MAKERS situated in the heritage district of Jalan Besar is a concept store serving buns (sliders). They also served mains such as pastas and rice bowls as well as specialty coffees and desserts. We were here for lunch today and had the crab meat aglio olio and signature baos with nanban chicken, salted egg yolk chicken in black seasame bun and Chilli crab with deep fried mantou. Prices ranged from SGD5 for baos and SGD13 for mains, desserts start from SGD7. No GST and service charges.

Overall a very refreshing and delightful experience if you fancy savoury fare. I will be back to sample the other flavourful baos on the menu."
Lobster Roll: Die die must try!,Very chill and nice cafe with minimalist decor. Oh and the lobster roll was simply out of this world. What an explosion of flavours in my mouth
Good lunch,The dishes were a little small but were very nice. The kong ba pau certainly does not disappoint and they are generous with the fillings for each pau.
A very pretty cafe,Loved the decor. Beautiful place for a casual afternoon tea. Baos were average though. Thought the salted egg sauce could have more salted egg taste. Chilli crab bun was really spicy..
Chinese 'sandwiches' with a difference!,"A re-porposed shophouse unit opposite the Jalan Besar Stadium, it sells the traditional steamed of fried Chinese 'Mantou' buns with interesting fillings.

Other than the traditional 'kong bak bao', fillings are both fusion and reimagined dishes, such as chilli crab, salted egg, and so on.

Nice, cosy, cafe atmosphere in an airconditioned enviroment, where you can sit and eat and watch the world go by.

A definite must-try."
Good food and ambience,"This is my 3rd time there and the last 2 times I have brought my overseas friends and they all love it. It's a casual and friendly ambience and most importantly, the food is delicious!"
Good food worth the price,"Friendly service, nice & creative foods (rice bowls, buns, puddings), and lovely ambience. Recommended for casual gatherings and lunches :)"
Bao you satisfy,"When you put something special into a Bao, it just melt in your mouth. The best is Chili crab and egg yolk prawn.

It is a self service place so not much service.

One big minus is the floor. It has elevated area by the window and elevated area in front door. If you don't watch your step you will easily trib"
It was a below average experience.,It's was a cafe with a nice fusion food theme with good ambience. The baos tasted good but salad was not fresh. Reflected to staff and they just say they will reflect to the chef. Never take a look at our food and never changed the salad for us. Long Black coffee was sour.
Brunch at Bao Makers,"With the entertainer app, I managed to enjoy 4 baos for the price of 2! My order was: chilli crab, salted egg chicken, satay chicken and veggie. All were great and I especially love the satay chicken with its fragrant and nutty peanut sauce. As well as the salted egg chicken with a savoury and flavourful salted egg sauce coupled with crisp deep fried chicken!The chilli crab came with a side of chilli crab sauce but unfortunately it was served cold :( The bun was deep fried to a slightly crisp exterior for the chilli crab but wasn't serve hot, just lukewarm. Nevertheless, the fillings were great and satisfying. We also tried the green tea pudding (since the cookie bomb was sold out) and it certainly exceeded our expectations! The green tea flavour was distinct and the pudding is milky, eggy, smooth and silky."
Great food!,"Went there on a Saturday morning. Staff was really friendly and nice. The atmosphere of the cafe was relaxing and quiet for a weekend. Feel like one of those hidden gems for the cafes in that area. Food and drinks were delicious and refreshing respectively. We ordered two baos (the salted egg yolk and satay chicken), the pork don and the chili crab pasta. All of it were well seasoned and tasty. Would definitely recommend this place!"
Baos,Nothing too fancy but good for a quick mid-day snack. Liked the fried chicken with salted sauce most!
Good concept,"Marrying the Chinese Pao with the chilli crab and salted egg sauce in a cafe setting, is a good concept. Coffee is of a good standard while food needs some adjustment. Cosy atmosphere for a slow meal."
Back for another visit,"Back for a second time today to this quirky little cafe not too far from Lavender mrt. Good selection of interesting baos to try, all quite tasty. Truffle chips also pretty good."
Good food and ambience,"Visited on a weekday night, wasnt crowded. Food was cooked well and neatly plated. I tried the beef steak don, salmon mentiko don, chilli crab bao and salted egg shrimp bao. Will definitely revisit to try other items on the menu."
Awesome salted egg chicken/ prawn bun,"Relax environment with very delicious salted egg buns (bao). Tried both chicken and prawn ones. Very tasty salted egg sauce with juicy/ succulent chicken and prawn sandwiched by very soft and fluffy bun. We also had a pasta (beef) to share which is not bad. Coffee is decent.
Ordered the Taro pudding which I feel is too rich. Overall would highly recommend to come here for the buns!
Buns are around $5/$6 per piece (min 2 piece).
Note that this place is not very accessible."
Interesting take on classics,"Just visited Bao Makers and tried their food. In general the food is decent to good. The food is inspired by local classics and the chef had managed to add a interesting twist to it.

The pork belly bao is good. It taste sumptuous and you have a nice garlic taste. The chilli crab bao was a bit disappointing because it didn't really taste like chilli crab.

The coffee was decent. I am willing to come back again to try the other items on the menu."
Sat Dinner,"2nd time visiting, friendly and good service staffs. We ordered all different kinds of Baos, crabmeat linguine, truffle fries and calamari. Baos were really awesome!"
Delicious Baos,"Bao is nice! Pasta wasn't that nice though. Accoustics of place was quite had, so when a bunch of patrons were laughing and talking loudly, the rest of us suffered. Would be good if they could put some deco to reduced the sound reflections."
2nd visit to the Bao makers,"the consistence of the food standard is up to the marked, however a small bao is abit pricey but food is delicious, will visit again."
Hits & Misses,"The salted egg chicken bao was delightful, but the rest of the dishes fell short of expectations. Would hope for some improvement in food quality consistency."
"Nice ambience, great innovation","Appearance: From the outside, it looks like a 'atas' restaurant feel. But upon entering inside, it gives a very spacious and comfy feel with the deco set up. Utensils and cutlery are interestingly chosen. With a deep bowl for rice meals and a nice personalised wooden basket to hold the bao gives it a modern feel.

Food:
personally I love the BBQ pulled pork and salted egg chicken baos the best! Filling is generous and flavourful. Very interesting fusion and remaking something common and plain into something exciting and appealing to the eye and mouth!
Salmon rice bowl is very nice as well. Rice used is very tasty and salmon is fried and drizzled with roe sauce.
Effort is also made to make the lemon tea shake. With a pinch of mint in it.
Nacho cheese fries came in a generous portion!

Closing remarks: it can be a bit pricey but for the quality of the food, it is ok! As the baos comes in minimum 2, might be a good idea to go with another, order a main and have a Bao each!

Owner says there's gonna be a new menu in oct '16! Looking forward to it."
$30 for two pax,Affordable price. We spend about $30 dollars for two persons. We tried the bao and noodles. Good for ppl who like eating Bao

"Good food, great service","Great place worth a visit. Food quality was really good and the menu is pretty innovative. Desserts were amazing. But the best part for me was the service at this place. Ambience (inside) was good too, nice spacious setting."
Great little find!,Nice little cafe serving interesting and tasty baos of different varieties - highly recommend the Bulgogi and Salted Egg versions as well as the Truffle Fries!
Innovative baos in a hipster setting,"Creative baos with interesting flavours. We tried the chili crab, pulled pork and salted egg chicken - all tasted wonderful! Really liked that there was a special chili crab dip sauce that came along."
Modern pao place gets classic right!,"It was a great concept. Open face paos with unusual concoctions. The salted egg pao was a hit but felt too rich for me. The nanban pao was good but the classic pork pao is perfect right down to the sauce. For a shop that aims for hipster fusion and contemporary, getting a classic right sets it apart. Well done."
Great vibe even better food,Minimalist interior and nice touches. The food is outstanding and reasonably priced. Had the classic bao and the salted egg shrimp. Would recommend both! Staff were wonderful. Was able to use their wifi :)
Bao to die for,"My friends and I decided to order all 8 of the Baos in the menu, we loved the Chilli Crab, PulledPork, Fried Chicken Bao as well as the salted egg prawn Bao. In addition, I loved the interior as it was rather spacious."
