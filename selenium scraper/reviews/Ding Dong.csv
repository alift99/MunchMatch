Farewell dinner,"We had our last date night before lockdown here, as it has always remained our favourite restaurant in Singapore.
My husband had the green curry red snapper, which was beautiful. I had the duck, which was ok. It was not one of the suggested top three, so I should have listened!
As always, the service and staff were delightful and the restaurant was full of people, like us, regulars, having their 'last supper'.
Wishing everyone at Ding Dong the best, stay safe and we will see you again soon."
Hong kong style of restaurant,The interior is made me feel I‚Äôm in Hong kong. There is lunch menu you can order as set. The food was delicious
Great choice!,"Wonderfully vibrant flavours, beautifully composed on the plate. A fantastic option for pan-south East Asian dining. And delightful staff. Love this place!"
Good food,We had a really good meal here and visited for a team lunch. Very nice Asian fusion food though not an extensive menu. The staff was very friendly. Really nice ambience + d√©cor with plenty of old retro posters and its located at a convenient location at CBD. Take the downtown line and its just 2-3 mins away walk from Telok Ayer Station.
Ding Dong recommended by a friend and it didnt disappoint,"Whilst staying on business I was recommend this place by a friend, within 5 days I went back 3 times. Nino was a great host, along with the rest of the team. Service is excellent and friendly, food was very good. if your looking for a relaxed vibe, good food and service, which is also quite cool, then don't miss-out. Next time I am back in Singapore I will be here..."
Just another funky fusion restaurant,Starter portions are quite small and undeserving of the price. The ambience is of a modern funky restaurant and We found the food to be quite average. Don‚Äôt see ourselves returning.
good local eats,nice local eats here. nothing too fancy but you get to experience the legit local food here. willl definitely go back
"Cool place, yummy food.","Cool place, yummy food, good service, nice decoration, cocktails, good location.
We will go back soon!"
Funky tasty fun,"Lawyers know the best restaurants. Happy to be taken to Ding Dong with a couple of legal friends. How lucky was I. Duck is always a good choice. Duck dumplings, duck leg, washed down with a little Australia rose. The decor and energy of the place is so much fun. I especially love the Jane Fonda Barbarella."
Pleasant change.....,"I‚Äôm over the Hawker centre vibe in Singapore at this point and this restaurant has certainly been a breath of fresh air.
We had the roasted duck dumpling for entree; barramundi on Thai sweet and sour sauce and Angus short ribs. The dishes were aesthetically pleasing and our tastebuds definitely enjoyed them! No room for desert afterwards.....
The restaurant setting is vibrant and comfortable - not your typical, let‚Äôs cram as much tables and seats as possible.
I‚Äôm looking forward to the next visit to try the rest of the food offerings including sweets."
"Great food, drinks pricey","Very nice food, great flavours and presentation and portion size was just right. Not an extensive menu but the quality was very good."
Delicious food,Delicious food with interesting flavours. A bit expensive but was worth it! Nice atmosphere and attentive staff.
Incredible Asian Food!,I highly recommend Ding Dong. The food is outstanding and the place has a very nice vibe. Drinks were also really good. It's particularly good when you have visitors in town. They serve all the main asian dishes with a little twist.
"Good Vibe, Professional Service Staff & Awesome Food üëç","Very great service and delicious modern South East Asian cuisines. the pork char siew, Pan Roasted Barramundi with their homemade thai sweet chili sauce and durian Alaska was amazing. attentive staff, definitely worth a visit, would go Again!

Suggest to come with a small group of friend to taste more of Ding Dong menu."
Ding Dong,Absolutely loved the food and the service was amazing!! Definitely be coming back when I‚Äôm next in SG!!
Terrible food. Overpriced!,"Zero effort in food. Douse of sweet Thai chili sauce pick up from any
supermarket over a pan fried fish and charge $29++!!everything else just taste like sweet and sour sauce. The wagyu bun patty could have made of chicken meat and I won‚Äôt taste any difference"
You've gotta love 80s music!,"A funky restaurant with a good menu.
Standout was the tuna tataki for a starter.
The mains were tasty too (although could have been served a little hotter).
Wine was expensive - and don't forget the additional 17% added on top.
Oh, and yes, the background music was all 80s (fine by me!).

Price point for 2 starters and 2 mains (excluding the wine): SGD $120"
Amazingly tasty food,"My husband and I had lunch here and ordered a mixture of dishes from the hot starters. Everything single item was so delicious!!! The beef rendang cheek was great, and a particular favourite was the duck dumplings. Would highly recommend!"
Delicious flavours in quirky ambience!,"Recommended by our local expat expert, we headed to Ding Dong in a district that was not part of our normal location in Singapore. Very pleasantly surprised with the vibe in Amory St just at the back of Chinatown.

The Bali pork belly satay and Beef rendang in lotus buns were clear winners for us, sensatoinal flavours. Good wine and cocktail list, solid and reasonable prices for Singapore. Our staff were attentive, the atmosphere was fun, a little loud from the table next to us, but that happens.. great night out!"
Average,"Made a reservation for 2 adults and baby with phone number and email address for confirmation. When we arrived were told that the restaurant would have called and told us they didn‚Äôt have high chairs. But was international call, I said you could have emailed me. Signature cocktail advertised not available, we planned to order one of the dishes advertised for baby with veggies. Not available. The staff were nice, the food was average and very, very expensive vs the restaurant quality, atmosphere etc. at the Shoppes at Marina Bay where we have been dining. Overall not recommended."
Sensational food & stylish interior,"Had dinner here with my husband after recommendation by Lonely Planet. We did not book a table but I do recommend you do so, as we were lucky to walk in off the street.
In my opinion the food was very special indeed with wonderful flavours and stylishly presented. We ordered their signature dishes of Vietnamese coleslaw, blue swimmer chilli crab, then for mains red snapper curry and the duck dish. All four dishes were cooked to perfection and were delicious. Good portion size too. I would give my right arm for the recipes!!
The lovely Filipina waitress who served us, was charming, professional and very friendly.
There is a warm friendly ambiance in this restaurant, and I would not hesitate to return. Most of the other diners looked expat, but there were some locals here too.
This is quite an expensive restaurant. I seem to recall the beers cost around $18 each, but if you want Michelin quality food, come here."
"Ding Dong, lunch is served!","Introduced to this place by our buddies. We're told the food is more like Vietnamese but the food was really interesting, well presented and tasted great too (which is the most important.

The 4 of us tried the following items:
Salad, rendang wrapped with white steam buns (its like eating kong bak bao except the filling is beef cheek done rendang style), char siew with a barbecued pineapple, grilled fish fillet (with green curry gravy - by the side - we requested for it not be poured in onto the fish), charcoal you-tiao stuffed with otah fish paste, brocolini, yam ring with an egg in the middle, some brown rice. for desserts we tried the shared a durian cake and a chendol. We thought the salad was the most basic and resembled something vietnamese with plenty of vegetable, especially bean sprouts (tau-geh). The rest of the items were really good. The grilled pineapple and its sweetness enhanced the char siew so well. The green curry gravy was the other thing that made the crispy grilled fish fillet outstanding. The black color you-char-kueh with otah filling is something different from the ones that are stuffed with squid/prawn paste and deep fried that we eat at Chinese restaurants/zi-char places. Do note that portions are small so we had all these items to share like small and medium tapas plates.

It was a quiet Sat lunch and the place was not crowded at all. We get the feeling that the place will be very noisy and squeezy when its crowded. It has an interesting decor with plenty of old / dated posters. Finding a car park will be a challenge along Amoy Street (CBD) during meal times (and its parallel parking too). Take the downtown line and walk from Telok Ayer Station - its just 2-3 mins away. Overall, we think this place is worth second visit."
Food was great! Service friendly but a bit loose,"Can‚Äôt rave enough about the food. Every single entree and main was delicious. Crab cup entree (there were three of us so we had to fight over the fourth cup - pet hate), scallop noodles amazing, steamed buns yum. Curry to die for, broccolini perfectly cooked and great sauce. Wine list decent too and relatively affordable options (it is Singapore, after all).
Service was lagging, we had to ask twice for nearly everything. Food came before plates and drinks. They were friendly but didn‚Äôt pay attention to the actual service aspects."
Spicy and rich,"Food rather too spicy, : barrimundi tasted of spices not fish! Appeared very popular :
Vegetarian option best considered as a surprise!"
Superb eating,"This was my favorite restaurant over all 10 days in Singapore. Order the papaya salad, the beef cheek buns, and duck leg!"
Quality creative dishes!,"FOOD
THAI GRILLED PORK COLLAR
Jaew Dipping Sauce

I thought ""jaew"" is a misspelling, but in fact it refers to a Thai dipping sauce. From ""mere"" greatness, the pork becomes heavenly when paired with the sauce!

STUFFED YOU TIAO
Otah Otah, Kaffir Lime Mayonnaise

Very innovative! The black you tiao somehow manages to remain crispy even as we got distracted by the other dishes which came speedily.

CURRIED PUMPKIN SOUP
Crayfish, Grilled Pumpkin

Smooth and soothing soup, I just wish the crayfish had a more significant presence.

CHICKEN LOR BAK
5-Spice Sauce, Orange Marmalade

This really tastes like pork!

DURIAN ALASKA
Pandan Sponge, Kaya

My highlight of the night, I spent some time admiring it before reluctantly tucking into its rich interiors.

KUIH BAHULU
Chocolate Aero, Nutella Powder

Solid chocolate ice cream, but I wasn't too impressed with the heavy textured kuih bahulu.

Quantity: 8/10
Quality: 9/10
Value For Money: 9/10

SERVICE
The restaurant was half-empty when we arrived, we'd made reservations prior, and yet we were given seats with no backing at first. They also didn't know to slow things down when our small and cramped table was already full of food.

Attentiveness: 6/10
Friendliness: 7/10
Speed: 8/10

SETTING
VERY NOISY once the place got more crowded, which affected my enjoyment of the food a lil. Love the deco and cheeky dings and dongs though

VERDICT
The quality and creativity of the dishes overrode my annoyance with some very rowdy patrons, I'll be back for more!"
Inventive cocktails and delicious small plates,"Ding Dong is a charming little restaurant that features a modern twist on regional Asian cuisine. We found it by leafing through a book in a local bookstore about the city's best-kept secrets -- and we were not disappointed. We sat at the bar and enjoyed watching their meticulous preparation of desserts (so much so that we had to order one). Besides the fact that all cocktails in Singapore are ridiculously expensive, the meal was reasonably priced. We paid $133 SD for two; if you subtract about $40 SD for drinks, the balance bought us three shared plates and a shared dessert. For our light appetites, it was enough food - you may want to spend more."
Excellent,"I noticed the poor review here from a couple of days ago... I'm baffled, as we had a really good meal with excellent service. I'm a fussy eater but I thought it all delicious, especially the Scotch eggs, the scallop ceviche and the amazing pork knuckle."
Poor / amateur service,"Location is the best thing going for this restaurant. Vibe inside is comic chic with sharing menu. Service was 3/10, no eye on topping up wine or water etc. I‚Äôm not a fussy customer but all on our table couldnt fail to notice the poor service- food was average, Pork Belly was 80% fat. Was my second and last visit."
Great restaurant with retro decor,"Quirky decor and friendly service. Food was excellent, particularly enjoyed beef cheek bun started . Main course dishes were also very tasty , portion size generous. Will definitely go back ."
Good food,"Pretty tasty Asian fusion food. Lunch menu is pretty value for money.

I‚Äôd suggest making a reservation beforehand. If not, the wait staff will curiously seat you at tables with round stools (with no backings) instead of ones with regular chairs/booth seats. Been there twice and was made to sit on these stools on both occasions."
Fantastic asian fusion food.,"A friend and I visited for lunch today, me for the first time, and I absolutely loved it.

We ordered the singapore chilli crab, chicken lor bak, pulled beef cheek bun, and Thai grilled pork collar. Everything was DELICIOUS.

The crab, pork and chicken were perfect portion sizes for sharing, but next time I think I‚Äôll order the pulled beef just for myself (2 buns per portion) as it was so good.

We finished the meal with a Vietnamese coffee served at the perfect temperature.

Staff were also great - attentive and helpful without being pushy.

My one question - where can I get a copy of the Bruce Lee poster on the wall?"
Very Good,"We visited this nice restaurant early in evening before it was busy. Food was good, value nice, but the best part was dessert. Get the Coconut snow - that was wonderful!"
"Amazing food, good service","Everything we tasted was top quality. Save some space for desert. We ate a coconut, icecream creation that was probably one of the best deserts we tasted. 18 dollar glas of beer pricy and the food was not cheap eather, but the food is really worth it."
Delicous food and relaxed Staff,If I ever go back to Singapore I would defintely go back to Ding Dong. The food was sooo good and the dumplings where eyeopening to how a good dumpling should taste. Staff was really service minded in a relaxed way.
Delicious fusion flavours,"Small restaurant with tables outside and inside. Some stools at the bar to watch the cooking. Old film poster wallpaper.
Efficient staff. Delicate flavours mixing all south east Asian cooking with European. Quality ingredients.
For 4 people Staff suggest 2 cold staters 2 hot and 2 mains. We chose Vietnamese coleslaw and chicken, tuna Tataki with calamansi sorbet, duck dumplings, Thai pork, beef short rib and barramundi Thai sweet and sour.
All delicious.
I cook every day in the UK and I always like to go out and eat food which has taken time to prepare.
Will definitely return to work through the menu."
Best dumplings we ever had!,Nice restaurant with friendly and helpful staff that served really nice food. The dumplings were the best we ever had. The fish is very fresh and tasty. Can definitely recommend this place. For sure not the cheapest place and the beer was quite pricy but worth the food experience!
Cute decor,"The wait to our reserved table seems long for an less than half filled restaurant. We were brought to table with high chairs without being asked if that was ok. And had to inform that the service staff that we preferred chairs with back rest. Although the service is not the best we could ask for, the food was good. It was interesting enough for us to want to go back again to try out other dishes."
Love the food,Loved every dish we had here - will need to go back to try them all! Very helpful staff helped us choose what to eat.
Delicious but cold,"The food, the ambiance, the drinks are wonderful. There is one downside. It is cold!!! If you sit at or near the bar, you are right under the air conditioning. Not only does that leave you shivering but subsequently the food comes out cold as well. Nevertheless the food is absolutely delicious! I chose the baby octopus and then the fish with green curry. Depth of flavour from both dishes but could use some additional spice for my taste. Perfect place for dates, dinner with friends or as a solo traveller sitting at the bar watching the magic in the kitchen."
Disappointing,"Price point-wise it was quite expensive for its proportion. Food was so-so (average), we ordered the scotch egg, chicken lor bak, beef short ribs, and pork belly. Overall taste is bland. The ambiance was quite good, they really captured a modern Asian fusion vibe.

I am really disappointed with the service, to think that we were the first one that in the restaurant. All the front of house staff were a bit rude and seems like they were not in the mood to serve. To think that we have the same nationality I would expect a little courtesy of 'How's the food?' and/or ""Do you need anything else?""

But no, they just took our orders, served our orders and took away our plates after we're finished eating.

Good to experience once but never come back after."
A surprising twist to Asian food,"We came here for business dinner and had the luxury of trying a variety of food, that‚Äôs a fusion of Asian food.

We had a go with Scotch Eggs, Vietnamese Coleslaw, Duck Leg in Satay Sauce.

But I particularly love their Kueh Pie Tee with chilli crab, a really innovative twist to the usual kueh pie tee.

As well as their red snapper with green curry and clams. The green curry although was a tad sweet, but I love how the fish was extremely fish and not too overly dry.

Also try their pulled beef cheek bun, again a twist to the Chinese Braised Pork bun (aka Kong Bak Pao). The buns are stuffed with Pulled beef cooked in rendang style. Not too overly rich like you would get out of a Kong Bak Pao."
Nice and cozy with decent food!,"Nice and cozy dinner place for gathering. The dishes were creative and tasted good too.
Duck leg with satay - tender and flavorful
Red snapper with green curry - curry was a little too sweet but fish was good
Rendang beef bun - creative although I preferred the traditional braised taste
Scotch egg - award winning! Really good! Must order
Vietnamese coleslaw - refreshing and tasty
Kueh pie tee - safe choice

I like the vibrant atmosphere inside. Toilet is available and location is very convenient (3mins walk from Telok Ayer MRT Station)"
Excellent food! Service can be a little faster...,"I have been to this place more than 4 times now and I find the food, especially the lunch set to be extremely good. It is also good value for money.

My only complaint would be that this place is in CBD and dealing with business professionals, we cannot be waiting for 15 mins between our courses."
Fabulous!,"Had a great evening at Ding Dong recently - we sat at the bar on a Saturday evening and enjoyed fantastic food, great atmosphere and outstanding service. Well done!"
A little exepensive for what it is,"We had the 'feed me' menu option, where the chef chooses surprise menu options for you. It was quite nice, however it did feel very rushed as courses were arriving before we'd finished the previous one. We also paid $32 per person for a wine pairing which I thought would mean one glass of wine with each course, however this was not the case as there are only 3 glasses included, which was a little disappointing.
The food was nice and the portions are generous, however I do think it's a bit overpriced. The cocktails were also very interesting."
Nice discovery,Dinner with friends. Food was good. The menu was a bit difficult to get but we all enjoyed our choice. Prices are a bit high though. I recommend !
good food experience and excellent cocktails if you can afford it,"this place is difficult to review. If you decide to go there, be prepared that you will spend at least 200 dollars for a couple and you will sit in a kind of bistro fast-food environment, packed together with many others at small tables, where you will not linger more than an hour in total. The food on the other hand, all small dishes to share, is simply delicious, try as many as possible and do not miss to order a cocktail, which are among the most sophisticated drinks I ever found"
Nice.,"Loved it! Everything from the service, food and ambiance. Good job! Love the Asian flavored being fusion with western. Nice concept."
"Just great - great food, service, decor",My daughter's took me here on my birthday. We loved it. Funky restaurant with great movie posters all over the world. Food was beautifully presented and tasted divine. Recommended
Great Food Great Atmosphere,"The Pork Belly is fantastic. I really like this place, great location with an interesting history. Close to Talok Ayre MRT in China town.
The service is really good it has a fusion menu and some great wines.
It‚Äôs a lively place and clearly popular with the after office crowd.
Apart from anything it has the best name of any restaurant I‚Äôve been to in a while.
Highly recommend it."
"Nice place for a long, lazy lunch!","Came here the other day to celebrate my mother's birthday. Found it online through a recommendation. Honestly, I was instantly attracted because of the name. We ordered all of the starters and the mains that were offered on the set menu + some brocollini and other dishes. My favourites would have to be the crab, brocollini and duck. I also had a cocktail with condensed milk and coconut milk, odd combination- but works well! Very delicious food and great service! The atmosphere is great, with 80's music playing throughout the cafe and funky decor, the afternoon couldn't have gone better."
Delightfully revisited Asian fusion greats,"In addition to making mean cocktails the staff are incredibly friendly and the dishes on the menu are each unique and memorable - ceviche, scotch eggs, pork belly... Each delivered with a flourish and consumed with relish..."
Fun and causal restaurant with lotsa buzz,It does get crowded here during lunch weekdays due to its popularity. Dishes are fun yet serious in taste. Using local dishes and twisting them lovingly around. Their alcoholic smoothie is great!
Ok,"I went with some friends and we order 12 different dishes,they really love thee place,so I went but or me was kind of average,bit overpriced but I understand the spot and the coo place.
What I really appreciated was the waiter,a girl that was
Really amazing!
I will give another try"
No opinion,"Well, it‚Äôs a contemporary interpretation of Asian food.
We were 5 friends and 2 of us loved all the dishes, the 3 others found that the taste were not strong enough. To blended, need spices kick !

The space is way to noisy, didn‚Äôt enjoy my friends as much as I wanted."
Ding-a-ling!,"Ding Dong always has such a good vibe. Is it the great food, the pink neon, friendly staff, the new location on Amoy? Probably a mix of them all.

Some highlights: Red snapper green curry is delicious, beef cheek rendang buns are epic, pork belly is not to be missed.

Huge fan of this place, highly recommended."
Good food; nice ambiance,This place has great energy and it's in a great location. The wasabi skewers were great and they drinks were good. They staff was awesome and I would definitely check it out again.
Great atmosphere and good food!,"A great fusion place. Fusion of Indochina and Indonesian flavors in many of the dishes. You can have a complete meal from just a having a variety of appetizers. All of the appetizers were great!!

The mains were good, the beef ribs and baramundi fish was awesome!!

Great place to dine with friends, music and atmosphere was fun!"
Incredible Singapore / fusion food,"I was brought here by a client for lunch on my first day in Singapore - it's a lovely restaurant, bright and brash decor, and incredible food. I really really enjoyed this place - good wine, good service. Charcoal prawns to die for, lovely duck, beautiful food from start to finish."
Healthy version of South East Asian food,Nice twist on the food. Small plates were good as were the big plates. However we thoroughly enjoyed dessert. They were all amazing!!
Fabulous,"Ding Dong may be a bit noisy but the food and service are worth the extra effort of straining to hear your company. Terrific food. A mix of refined and gutsy. Fabulous night, Will make it a date with good friends to have a meal when a little extra is required. Balance between casual surrounds and attention to quality, creativity and presentation."
Dont come here,Food is not value for money. Pork chop was tough and dry. Tempura was so salty. The alcohol was overpriced and just tasted sweet. Mainly customers r caucasians. Decor is not bad. But definitely no worth the visit
Not as good as before,"I went there with my bf, they ran out of the liquor that he wanted to order, he asked for another one...which was also not available. The food were a bit on the saltier side. The restaurant was not busy, but the waiters were happy chatting among themselves and not very into serving their clients. Overall, it was disappointing."
"Delicious, relaxed and friendly.","Visiting Singapore en route to Indonesia, we decided to give Ding Dong a go having seen a Lonely Planet recommendation and reviews on TripAdvisor. Very glad we did.

A lively Southeast Asian style, modern yet a full of flavour menu. Retro style as mentioned by others.

We started with a couple of cocktails, one based on gin, yuzu and ginger, it was zingy and delicious. We decided to try the tasting menu (S$80 pp) and took the chefs recommendations which included miso salmon, duck dumpling in consomm√©, tuna loin, pork char sui with pineapple salsa, wagyu beef with charred shallot and a chocolate dessert with many varieties of chocolate. All were faultlessly cooked and well presented.

The service was friendly, efficient yet not overly invasive and timing between courses was excellent.

2 cocktails, 6 course tasting menu for two, large bottle of water, service, tax. Sng$270 (~¬£150).

Whilst Singapore clearly has many places to eat...I‚Äôd definitely go back."
A very decent Ding Dong,Atmosphere is perfect for the style & decor of the restaurant. Casual dinners with friends makes this a good choice. Staff are friendly & attentive. Only reason I gave 4 stars is on my last 2 visits my choice of desserts were not available but goes to show how popular they are- sad for me though.
A Must Visit - Brilliant Dining,"Ding Dong is one of the standout dining experiences I have had in ages. The food is fantastic and definitely the best I have had in Singapore so far. An interesting range of exotic cocktails are on offer, there is a good selection of wines, and wonderful service. Couldn‚Äôt fault it (and I am fussy). Will be going back for sure. A must visit."
Interesting food,Selection of food is unique and tasteful. Ambience is very retro yet trendy..nice atmosphere and environment to chill with friends.
once is enough,expensive food. the taste was good. location was easy to find. decor was very nice. the ambience is not too bad for a catch up with friends. however it got really noisy towards the later part of the night. the cocktails wasnt good for the pirce paid.
"Great, as always!","Once we discovered Ding Dong, we go back practically every week! Great vibes, staff and food! Highly recommended"
Good Asian Fusion food with good vibes,"If you are looking for Asian Fusion, you may perfectly visit Ding-Dong Good vibes in this place with nice decoration, friendly service, good food and good beer Prices are reasonable and several dishes you may share"
Eccentric and eclectic,"Deco is very entertaining, a bit sad though that they kept the ceiling as bare ‚Äúindustrial chic‚Äù, when everything else was so well matching. Unique food choices including some very nice desserts."
Cozy place with great food,Ordered the char siu and tom yam lobster tail. Both are great üëç esp the tom yam gravy that blended well with the sriracha chilli
First lunch out in a while,"Just what we wanted, food that is subtle but yet simple, nice vibes and decor but not pretentious, various influences but not ""fusion"", we really liked this place. And the Chablis wasn't cheap but worth every cent."
Delicious,"For anyone who lives in Melbourne this is Singapore‚Äôs answer to Chin Chin‚Äôs. Cool & relaxed vibes, great tunes playing, efficient & friendly staff but most importantly delicious food. Sitting outside on Amoy St was good for people watching too"
Beautiful food,"We ate here about a year ago and have been meaning to return as we enjoyed it so much. Went last night and we were not disappointed! We had the red snapper with green curry and clams and the pork collar with pineapple, followed by the coconut desert (a modern take of chendol).
The food was beautifully presented and the flavours divine, with the pork, literally, melting in your mouth. My husband is not a dessert eater and normally has a token mouthful, but he loved this dessert as it was so light and full of suprise flavours.
The staff were lovely, smiling and friendly.
We won't leave it so long next time to return."
Good food but noisy place,All the movie posters on the walls create a very nice atmosphere. Food is good as well but music was playing too loud (we had to shout to hear each other)
Great food - funky atmosphere,"We were a couple, sharing.
Portions were excellent (despite a suggestion from a friend otherwise).
Our server was really helpful and honest in terms of the number of portions we needed for a balanced meal.
Starter was naturally small
Two mains were just right
And finished with a shared desert
Couple glasses of very nice wine"
Very nice dining place in Chinatown,One of the best dining place in Singapore in my opinion. A very friendly staff will introduce you. Plates are original and you could taste very different things.
"Bad food, small portions","Atmosphere is good. But food quality really poor. Offering sharing plates with 3 pieces on it, is not practical for a restaurant where most of the tables are serving 4. And the food was just not tasty."
Ding my Dong,"Had 4 mains which were amazing - Snapper Green Curry, Lobster Tom Yam, Tuna Loin and Char Siew. Atmosphere was also cosy and comfy, albeit we had a time limit because they needed the table back."
Marvelous,"Delicate, tasty, delicious and the team is just great!!! A new way to discover fusion kitchen... Do not miss this address in Singapore!!!"
A retro place for a cosy dinner with friends,"This was my second visit to Ding Dong and we were very glad to have chosen this place again for a cosy gathering with friends. Food was good, though prices were on the high side, and service was prompt. We will be back in future."
Cool and Amazing,"Their web site says ""...Well-loved for its playful and eclectic take on traditional Asian cuisine..."" My favourite - scotch eggs made with quails eggs and Asian spices. The food was amazing, the service terrific. Great for business or pleasure. Highly recommend."
Awesome food!,"I had a friend visit from overseas and thought we‚Äôd check out this place for lunch, glad we did! The lunch set menu was amazing!! The quality of the food and friendly service was mind blowing. The food was so good we decided to try a dessert which was creative and delicious! I‚Äôll be back again to try the dinner menu."
birthday lunch with colleagues,"The decor was great - so exciting and interesting. Food presentation was amazing too, a piece of art for every dish. Only thing was the portions were pretty small and did not fill us up even though we ordered 6 mains, 2 rendang brisket sets and 2 dessert."
Good friendly service with very average food,"Service was good, friendly staff and nice atmosphere. The food however was very small portions a little too small for the price. Had to send the wagyu back thinking it was overcooked and tough to be replaced by slightly more rare version but still tough. Wagyu for me should be much much softer and succulent. Expensive night and not totally full"
Great food! Great fun!,"Lively little place on Amoy street...one of my favorites in Singapore. Food is creative and delicious, applying high level technique to Asian classics...always hard to choose, but I really like the cole slaw, killer vietnamese scotch eggs, ribs, tuna, waygu sirloin, all superb! Cocktails, old school tunes and great service. Don't miss it!!"
Excellent value,Second time I have been here and does not dissappoint Great food- love the sharing plates - good service and all for a reasonable price for Singapore Highly recommended
Great vibe and great food!,Found this gem on one of the Singapore travel guides and must say it was excellent! It's in the Ann Siang Hill area which has such charm and the restaurant itself has a cool vibe. We had the shrimp tempura and curry red snapper - all super delicious! Like any Singapore restaurant be prepared to spend some food money - but it's well worth it.
Roaring '60s in a platter,"The ambiance is veri '60s. A bit loud inside but we simply asked for a table outside. The cocktails were the first surprise: black and gold (bourbon and honey) was delicious, it just went down too fast.. As a starter we got the scallop chemise and the salmon, bot very good, portions not huge. As main, the wagyu sirloin was bit difficult to eat with no knife (...) but juicy and tender. And the tuna delicious. Service bit slow but simply cause we were sitting outside I feel."
Surprising and creative dishes,"This was really a positive surprise to us - even better than expected! Both mains and desserts were a delight, combining tastes and textures in an usual way while keeping a distinctive southeast Asian style. Prices are definitely okay for what you get. We hope to return soon!"
Love this restaurant,"Great food but a bit slow service, no one checked if we wanted fresh drinks or if we were enjoying our lunch! But I will return."
"Great food, albeit a little pricey!","Food was fantastic as usual, just that the lobster dish was slightly saltier than when I had it during my previous visits. Restaurant may want to consider expanding or rotating the menu as the choices are quite limited."
Good interesting food in great casual setting,Great flavours and well structure plates. Attentive friendly service in great casual atmosphere. Will return again soon!
"Excellent food, bigger portion of rice please!","All we ordered was delicious, service was excellent too. It's just that every dish come with tiny bit of rice. Perhaps, just serve a big bowl of refillable rice for the table?"
Ding Dong a Ding Dong,"Living in Singapore we are not short of dining choices, but I keep going back to Ding Dong again and again.
If friends want to gather, or people are visiting, it is a fun, delicious and brilliant option that combines the spice and flavours of south east Asia - with 80's music and brilliant cocktails.
The Chef Ryan Clift (of Tippling Club fame) also has Ding Dong within his restaurant portfolio and it shows in the food and beverage experience. The cocktails are crafted and clever, always displayed in different vessels and reasonably prices.
The food is designed to share and features amazing dumplings, roasted and curry dishes, and great highlights such as Rendang beef bun that just melts in your mouth. Bigger plates include the pork collar, and duck - which has a hoisin treatment to die for.
The food and presentation is brilliant - put simply a funky and visual experience, where you are excited to see whats next, and how it will be brought to the table.
The mood and staff are young, funky and the 80's retro music soundtrack gives you some spring in your step as you enter. Its a bell ringer every time - great food - great decor and great staff - don't change Ding Dong!"
Great food at a reasonable price,"I was here for dinner only once, but I must say that it is probably been the best food I had in Singapore. The quality of the dishes is very high and prices are ""average"".

Definitely a place I would suggest to anybody having an hotel in the area !"
Fabulous,"All I can say is scotch eggs, a dish that I will remember for years. The rest of the food was also fabulous ( brisket Boa was also a standout) perhaps the small dishes outshone the mains and if I did return I would just have lots of those. I seriously considered going more than once on my trip to Singapore! But there is so much choice I didn't, and now just left dreaming of the scotch eggs and full of regret!"
Ding Dong!,"Fabulous time - food, service, set-up & music all great - highly recommend! Good for friends, couples and date nights!"
