its a sad closure,sad to hear the place is closing - been countless times to this place much for the view and service although food is much to be desired and nothing to wow about although the dessert art is a must try for 1st timers - see you soon and all the best
Horrible reservations system,"The view is supper, the food is good, the reservations system is horrible, I call early to reserve the window seat, the staff give me motherhood statement will try their best, although there is window seat available,"
"Fantastic view, terrible food","Went there to celebrate Valentine‚Äôs Day. Booked early so managed to secure a table by the window overlooking the bay. View was fantastic! Unfortunately everything else fell short of our expectations, considering this is supposed to be a high-end restaurant and we were paying $198++ for each 5 course Valentine‚Äôs Day set dinner.
The head waiter in a black jacket was quite polite, but his suit was obviously too small for him and it was stretched over his tummy. Rather unpresentable. He asked about our food restrictions so we told him. Didn‚Äôt expect to see the exact food we couldn‚Äôt eat to appear in the first dish! Oh dear‚Ä¶ The subsequent courses were so-so but what stood out as really terrible were the fish course and the duck mains which my partner had because he couldn‚Äôt eat beef. The fish over overcooked and tough. The duck just tasted terrible. The dessert however was nice and probably the best course out of the 5. I‚Äôm not sure why the food was of such poor standard but the restaurant needs to address this.
The service staff were all young and inexperienced, except for the head waiter of course. So service was not becoming of a high-end restaurant, but I guess we just accepted it because on the whole they were quite polite.
Needless to say, we won‚Äôt be making a second appearance."
Great experience!,"We were there for Valentine‚Äôs Day meal, it‚Äôs was nice and the staff services were good. We will consider visiting again for other occasions / celebrations."
Spectacular View!,Great Ambience at Level 62. Value for money for their lunch set course averaging $50 and top up with few selections. I would recommend this place to all my friends.
Anniversary Dinner,"First few minutes sat at our table wasnt good experience but i turned out unhappy with my experience for our 5th anniversary.

The person who serves i would say and not friendly at all given he is working at hospitality. we ordered the 5 meal course and he left right away before asking us what we want to drink so need to get his attention for our drink again. So its a piecemeal order basically. As am pregnant and cant drink alcohol and have asked what mocktail can you recommend and pleasantly said virgin mijito (fair enough) and took me 5 second to think and said back probably a juice?!!

Otherwise food is good and the rest of the staff was very kind and friendly."
One of my top picks to impress someone,"What can I say? Central location with stunning views (just make sure you book early to get the window seats), excellent food (quality and quantity) with elegant presentations, generally attentive service and superb ambience. Highly recommended by yours truly, a picky fusspot."
My Fav SG restaurant,"Definitely at the top of my list of fav Spore restaurants. Perfect ambience (top of the world) for all occasions. Professional and friendly staff. Delicious food. We had French oysters, Hokkaido scallops, Australian fish and US wagyu. A total delight. A must visit for all Spore visitors. And post dinner, one may adjourn to the rooftop bar 1-Altitude for drinks and a 360 degrees view of Singapore. Highly recommended. Super AAA+++"
Family Celebration,"The view will be great if seated by the window. Else there is not much difference dining on the ground or at high level. We thought due to celebration, a cake was sent to the table, but it was charged $16 for a slice. Though it was waived when queries."
Good Anniversary Experience,Pretty view while celebrating our anniversary! Thank you Hui Ting for making our anniversary a wonderful experience!
Lovely views and food,"Came for the 8 course dinner and was warmly served by Gab who took care of our every need. Views were great as we got a window table facing the city and although it rained we were treated to the spectacular view of lightning flashing against the city. Food was excellent, especially the dessert which tasted as good as it looked!"
Excellent service from Jovan,The service from Jovan was impeccable - warm and attentive. We enjoyed our lunch. Coupled with good views and food.
Great! STELLAR,Great food and service. Thanks Gab for taking care of us. We like the dessert presented and prepared at our table. Will see us more often in the future.
Nice but inexperienced staff,Very nice but inexperienced staff. For the money charged. Staff should properly be vetted. Offer additional bread. Explain the dishes. Ask how the food was. Don‚Äôt socialize among staff during service. Time should be spent on paying customers
Birthday Birthday Dinner,"Nice atmosphere. Manage to get window seat. The foods nice presentation plating. Foods was nice & fresh. Every dishes presented there is staff to inform of the foods contain of.

The service is awesome, Mr Gabriel is very polite and he will recommend us on the foods so that we can take his references. After all the desserts is nice not so sweet just like my preferred.

He also recommend on the wine. Ya, good recommended of the wine. He is also thoughtful towards us. Feel great to have such a good service.

Thank you."
Almost perfect experience,"Went there for my birthday treat and it was almost perfect. Great view by the windows looking across MBS, excellent service by the staff being friendly and engaging without being intrusive, delicious 5 course dinner and especially love the squid, cod fish and wagyu beef plus the recommended glass of wine (bonus point for allowing us to have a taste first before ordering). The night would have been perfect if not for being trapped in the lift for almost 30 minutes on the way out which dampened the experience just a little bit. Certainly won't fault the resturant for that though and will return again"
"Brilliant Service, Average Food, Great Views","I came here 11/11/21 for a business lunch with a friend of mine. Lunch menu was average 50SGD for both of us (without drinks), expect average Singapore prices for drinks.

Amuse b was fried crab, a tad suspicious as we both had the crab starter (i suspect it was expiring), with my mate having the barramundi and i had the angel hair uni butter pasta.

My pasta was great, possibly a tad difficult to eat for the sake of presentation but over all good. The highlight of the meal was the amuse b, starter was good but the meal didnt have legs. Desert was some black sesame sponge cake, which in reality too much was going on. Chefs dont need a crunch for the sake of textures.

Gab our server, was abolsute brillaint. He is the manager, runs a tight shift and I would return for his service.

View of course was fantastic, but if left up to the food, I wouldnt return."
so high in the sky is worth a visit,Episode 2 ‚Äì Asian Five Elements & Four Seasons by Ace Tan and Andy Yang - food meets art that‚Äôs my first experience it‚Äôs amazing. The service is very professional by GAB. Chef ACE explain every single dish.
Birthday dinner with great people.,"Greeted by Gab who served us. All other crew members were as helpful as he is.

The ambiance and view from the window table was fabulous though it rained.

The food was great and well presented. With the chef preparing our dessert at our table. And must say her hand drawing is perfect for the Birthday girl.

No regrets dining here.

Well done Gab and team."
Our Birthday,It was a wonderful lunch and memorable years for us to celebrate our Birthday in this place.. well appreciated and thank you for the Hospitality. The surprise Birthday with our names on the plates was so beautiful.. thanks to Ms. Jackleh and Charles.. hope to try next your dinner
"1 for 1, 8 Course Tasting Menu","We came in was treated very nicely by the service team. We were having the 1 for 1 8 course tasting menu. The food very underwhelming, some of the plates were oily and had fingerprints on them. The tile used for the dessert was chipped on all corners.

Octopus was rubbery and bitter.
Scallop was overcooked.
The Crustaceans Sauce for the Cod was thickened heavily.
Dessert was confusing and the chef didn‚Äôt really speak up loud enough for us to hear what was being plated tableside.

Overall it was a lackluster experience."
Romantic restaurant with scenic view,Love the food and warm ness from the staffs. Enjoy the quietness and romance with your love ones here! ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Fantastic food and ambience,l","Fantastic food and ambience, will be back. Service staff was attentive and polite. Nice dessert at the end"
High quality of food with excellent service and great view,Thanks to Gab and the team for the special arrangement for my proposal! Food is fresh and well prepared and presented! Dessert is also incredible! We enjoyed the time very much!!
Great view and service from,"Great view and service from GAB and team, highly recommended! Great value for lunch set. Under $100 per pax."
Great birthday lunch,"Came here for a birthday lunch with my partner,m, everything is fine for me. Great food, great service, great view, great environment and great value üòä"
Nice dinner,"nice location, good views from 62nd level; and food to match. Had a 8 course dinner there, really enjoyed the food and view."
First anniversary,Was here for our 1st anniversary lunch and was seated by Gabriel. He was attentive and welcoming and introduced us with the lunch menu. Keep on checking on our table and our well being. All the food was fine and deserts was great as i am a earl grey lover. Thank you for being such a great host.
Birthday lunch,"First time came. Nice atmosphere, was assigned to a centre seat and requested a window seat when available. Nice view and food quality is good."
Nice View !,Ambiance super good ! Nice view ! Friendly n attentive service! Food was rated 4.5/5 . Celebrating my anniversary ! Thanks for the services !
Inconsistent service,"Visited the restaurant to celebrate my gf‚Äôs bday on the 19th sep 2021. While making the reservation, I noted that it is my gf‚Äôs bday. Throughout all the fine dining restaurants we‚Äôve been to, they will serve the dessert with a happy birthday writing on the bowl. However, they did not do so that day. We did not think much about it until my gf visited the toilet and saw a staff escorting a lady to the toilet. My gf overheard the staff asking the lady if it was her son‚Äôs birthday today. When the lady said yes he said he will make arrangements and send over something to their table. Likewise, we also stated that it was my gf bday but they did not do the same? We recommended our friends to visit the restaurant as they wanted to celebrate their birthday. On an Instagram post they posted that they were being served a dessert with a happy birthday sign written there. Not saying this is a very big deal, but would just like to question this restaurant‚Äôs consistency in service."
Below expectation!,Disappointed on both food quality and service. Restaurant environment is under expectation. Only have a nice view. Luckily that we got window seat.
Dinner with a View,Great tasting food and service was excellent. Gabriel was attentive and provided good recommendations. Ask for a table overlooking the bay for a great view.
Excellent service and food,"Came to celebrate our wedding anniversary and was greeted by Gabriel and his wonderful team. Service was too notch and food was excellent, highly recommended!"
Had a great time at Stella restaurant,Great service by Gabriel V! He took great photos for us and the view was fantastic. Food looked lovely and enjoyed it.
Just Married,"Came here for dinner after our solemnisation. GAB and team gone great lengths to make sure we enjoy our time here. Very satisfied with their service! Great food packed with flavour, leaving us wanting to come again soon."
Lovely view and dinner,"Loved the staff , took good care of me, took beautiful photos of me!! Loved ur croissants or im not too sure what its called!food was amaazing i loved the desserts esp pavlova! Had a such a wonderful dinner"
Great view but food can be better,"The last I was here was many years ago. It was ordinary and wait staff were condescending hence it was written off the place to go.

After the 2nd lockdown I saw 1-Altitude has a weekend brunch which is of reasonable set price price and free flow of champagne add SGD 80+. Our server is polite and nice. Window seat only if you arrive there at 12pm sharp :)
We'd 3 and 4 course set lunch. The food is rather ordinary and pretty small portion. As we're there mostly for the champagne it was looked over. Even though the place is only filled up to max. 5 tables, our ""free flow"" champagne needs at least 3 times encouragement and signal to top up.

Food is ordinary and petite, so if you're there solely to catch up with friends and want to have a nice ambience + nice sparkling for 3hrs. Is a nice place to be. But if you're more into food than scenery, Fullerton, Four season, St. Regis will be better option with free flow of champagne too.

Overall is a 3 star place. They managed to survive as they do have good view (however only if you're early enough to grab the table as they won't reserve it for you)."
Romantic,Very professional service by Gabriel fast and friendly üëèüèª recommended for couples and family who like good food and good service
excellent choice,"Chose Stellar to celebrate my girlfriend‚Äôs birthday and thankfully it was an excellent choice, excellent view of MBS as i got transferred to the window seats after the guests at the windows left, food was good and value for money as we chose the 1-for-1 9C set, pace was good, did the pairing of wines which was paired well, my girlfriend loved the dessert art which was prepared in front of us towards the end to sum up the night. Special kudos to Charles and the dessert chefs for making all this possible and will be back soon, thanks Charles!"
Excellent,Great food and service as always. Gabriel was very attentive and welcoming. Thanks for a fantastic first meal out in 9 months.
Birthday dinner,"Great service by Gab and team, very attentive to our needs. Love the octopus! Visited Stellar for my partner‚Äôs birthday however a little disappointed that nothing was done despite indicating it‚Äôs a birthday, while I saw from reviews that there‚Äôs small arrangement made."
Lovely view and Super friendly staffs,Lovely view and Super friendly staffs served by Jackleh and Jill! üòä I felt so Welcomed by them and they are really professional! üòäüòä
Great service from Ju Matto and H.Ting,"Thanks to Ju Matto's recommendation we went for the 5-course dinner to celebrate our 100th monthsary and we didn't regret it. Ju was very kind in explaining all the dishes and made us feel very comfortable despite being our first time here. The view here is unbeatable, being only one of the few restaurants at this height in the area but the food was no less amazing with the presentation and also the complex flavours each dish had. Portion size was just right."
Highly recommended,"Money well spent. Delicious food accompanied with the view of Marina Bay at the tallest building of SG. Also, Ju Matto is very experience and did a very good job at servicing customers, from the ordering to the phototaking at the end. Fantastic! Highly recommended for special occasions."
"Amazing food, awesome view and even better service","Went here for dinner and the food was amazing! The view was also breathtaking, you can see the whole city, including MBS and the marina from above. The food was well made, the 5 course meal was curated thoughtfully and delicious. The service on the other hand, even better! I want to personally recommend Jackleh, the assistant manager. Although she was busy with many other diners, she made sure to keep all of us well serviced and recommended great wines/food suggestions. 5 stars! :)

Attaching my favorites from the 5 course :)"
Chef¬¥s signature series. Weekday lunch.,"We had a great time and it was an amazing experience overall. I would like to thank Mr. Ju Matto, who attended us and was fantastic.
We had the 4 dishes lunch menu and excluding the first one (just because it was a very small portion) the other three were to die for. Finally, what can I add about the view? IMPRESSIVE."
Weekday Lunch,"Great view, great food and also great service by Ju Matto. Took the 4 course set and it did not disappoint"
"Food was wonderful, views were amazing, service was spectacular!","We had a fantastic time! Our server Ju Matto was amazing and super accomodating - he gave us great recommendations and really went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. We went for my mother's birthday, and I called ahead and they got us a chocolate cake! Food was excellent and really a well-worthy experience. 10/10 would recommend!"
Romantic dinner <3,"The food was delicious! The service was great! The view was magnificent! The dessert art was the highlight! They even sent a personalised message on the dessert :) Priced on the higher side, but I guess you pay for a wonderful experience ;)"

Business Lunch,Very much enjoyed this months menu. The beef short rib and house cured trout were amazing. Also ambience when on a window table is great.
Awesome service and helpful team!,I had my birthday celebration at stellar and it was awesome! we were served by Mr. Ju Matto and the rest of the team. All of them are very very helpful and i can feel that they sincerely like to give their best service to the customers. Never had in my mind that my birthday celebration could be this meaningful!

Good food & service,Good food and good service from Ju Matto! Recommended to come during evening time to enjoy the view.
Amazing celebration,We were served by Fu Matts who was so heartwarming and helpful in his service. Great recommendation by him to take up the 5-course menu which came with a pleasant surprise for the dessert.
The perfect birthday lunch!,"Big big shout out to Zai and especially Alex for taking such great care of me and my partner! Customer service is very important and Alex delivered amazingly and made us feel very comfortable during our visit, the perfect man for the afternoon!
It is my first time trying Hamachi and it is the best thing i've ever tasted! 100/10 for the Hamachi as well as the Spinach and Basil soup!
Highly recommend Stellar as it would not burn a hole in your pocket, it is extremely worth it to come visit here!
Will be 101% coming back next month for lunch again!"
One month anniversary,"Went here for me and my boyfriend‚Äôs one month anniversary. 5 course menu was awesome and all dishes were well-prepared and each ingredient was carefully explained to us. Initially we got a table in the middle of the room, but the kind staff offered to move us near the window with a stunning view of the cityscape. Stellar really lives up to its name with great food, ambience and service. We‚Äôd also like to give our compliments to Jumato, the restaurant manager for being extremely hospitable and ensuring a lovely experience for us. Thank you!"
Birthday dinner made awesome dinner.,"Loved the ambience, hygiene, seating, view..everything! It was a surprise dinner organised by family for my birthday. Enjoyed every minute spent at Stellar. Food was awesome and perfectly cooked. Just the right amount of salt and spices. Service was spectacular. Serving ,cleaning, allocating table with good view and accomodating our requests was very appreciable. Allowing us to go to the roof top bar was icing on the cake. We were looked after by Mr.Ju Matto , he really made us feel special."

Awesome View,"Breathtaking view of Singapore, not too bad average food with excellent service. Especially love the beef cheeks they served for lunch."
Excellent service! and Fantastic view!,"A few things were clearly noticeable when I arrived at the restaurant. It had a pleasant ambiance and friendly staff. As soon as I was seated at the table, the menu was presented to me, without unnecessary delays. Mr.Ju Matto, who was assigned to take down my orders was clearly helpful in explaining some of the items on the menu, allowing me to make more informed choices of the dishes I wanted to try out. I was even more excited when the taste of each dish gave me a renewed sense gastronomical experience. This restaurant, along with it‚Äôs staff, as well as it‚Äôs fantastic view, makes it a definite 5-star dining experience. I would highly recommend it to friends and family."
Amazing restaurant,"It's exactly what you expect. Sky high restaurant with great views, great food (especially the rump cap) and amazing service. I've seen Gan and Ju Matto a couple times now and they're always perfect and accommodating for me and my partner. Not pricey at all either"
Wonderful birthday lunch,"Had lunch here to celebrate a birthday. Lovely food which was outdone only by the amazing panoramic views! Really appreciated the service provided by Mr Ju Matto and Mr Gan, who accommodated our request to shift to a window-side table which was vacated halfway through our meal."
Great service and food!,Excellent anniversary celebration at Stellar! Great service and lunch set menu. Definitely value for money!
"Stellar service, food and view",This is a belated post for a visit last month (February 2021) but still worthwhile to drop a review here on TripAdvisor given the stellar service by Ju Matto and his crew as well as the gastronomical delights that we enjoyed. The breathtaking view further complements the meal to make this a dining experience to remember.
Birthday celebration,"Good services , especially the supervisor Ju Matto Will be back soon .. the food is nice and the views awesome"
Great view with excellent service!,"The ambience and view is perfect for couples. Food was good, particularly enjoyed the smoked eel appetiser. Was served by Ju Matto who provided great service and recommended an excellent wine to go with the meal!"

Special shoutout to Sammy for making our night special by letting us have a coveted table by the window as a result of a no-show. Many thanks! Love the ambience . Great place for that special occasion"
Birthday dinner,"Beautiful and nice place , food is pretty good. Mr. Ju matto really friendly , he know what I need and intro what food prefer to me"
First fine dining experience,First fine dining experience at the Stellar and it was great (with minimal awkwardness). Kudos to Fu Matto for the excellent service and making us feel welcomed/comfortable throughout the entire night. Details/components of each dish was well explained when presented. Excellent view and ambience (big plus point!). Highly recommend for special occasion.
Birthday celebration,"We had a wonderful time and an exceptional experience dining at Stellar, warmthly served by JuMatto and Gan. Each course in the 6-course dinner was a delight, especially the Dessert Art. Thank you for the great food and service!"
Celebration Dinner,"Our family had a wonderful dinner at Stellar to celebrate my daughter‚Äôs excellent A levels results. We would like to commend Mr Ju Matto for his warmth, hospitality and for the special efforts made to accommodate our children‚Äôs dietary needs. We took his recommendation and go for the 5 course elements and Mr Ju Matto made a special request to the chef to modify our children‚Äôs first course to their preference. Also, he took the initiative to ask if we were there to celebrate a special occasion and asked for the special message that we may want for it to be written on the Dessert Art presentation.

Without us requesting, Mr Ju Matto also helped us to change table to one with a spectacular window view once the table was available and before commencement of the first course. Also, he volunteered to help us take many family photos throughout the course of our dinner.

The food was excellent and each course was well-prepared, with Mr Ju Matto explaining to us in detail each course upon it being served. Our children were awed by the Dessert Art presentation, which was truly an amazing culinary experience for them.

Upon completion of the entire course, Mr Ju Matto recommended that we made a visit to the outdoor rooftop. The staff at the alfresco rooftop dining volunteered to help us take a family photo even though we did not have our dinner outdoor.

Overall, we had an excellent and impeccable dining experience at Stellar. We would like to extend a Big Thank you to Mr Ju Matto for taking the special effort to make our celebration dinner extra special and memorable.

Thank you Stellar At 1-Altitude! You truly live up to your name for the service, ambience and food!"
Birthday Lunch,Glad and honoured to be assisted by Mr Ju Matto. He is kind and friendly. Had a great lunch for my fianc√©‚Äôs 30th birthday!
Wonderful proposal dinner,"Staff were friendly and proactive in helping me planning and also assisted me during my proposal. They went ahead to instruct the kitchen to write wording ""will you marry me"" in the dessert course without me requesting it. I had a wonderful and unforgettable dinner in this place."
Birthday Dinner,Amazing birthday dinner at stellar with a view to die for. We had a lovely time and the dessert at the end was really the ‚Äúcherry on top‚Äù.
Excellent view,"We had a table by the window and it was a sunny day. The view was excellent, which is a very good reason to come to this restaurant. Service was good as well. Set lunch was reasonably priced and our vegetarian guest was able to get a modified set meal with no fuss from the server. However, we were served sparkling water that was rather expensive, and I did not remember being asked about it prior to being served. In fact, we were charged for 2 bottles. The total bill was much higher than anticipated due to this. It would be better if the waiter was to ask before serving that."
Superb Service and view,"I've been meaning to visit and am certainly glad I did. I would like specially commend JuMatto for his warm and personal hospitality, making it a most memorable birthday lunch for my hubby and I. Food was different with interesting twist. Definitely impeccable."
Five-course menu,"The dishes were nice. Mr Ju Matto and Mr Zainom were attentive and friendly. Overall, its a nice fine experience with a ambient environment! Thank you Stellar At1altitude!! üòä"
"Fantastic view, excellent service and food",I was able to get table by the window and enjoy a good view. The service was great. The dessert Nine layers of chocolate was the best.
Excellent food and service,Mr Ju Matto provided a excellent and attentive serice. The foods are excellent . The service staffs provided excellent services.
"Amazing ambience and service, good for anniversary","The service and the ambience is really good. As expected, the view from the 62nd floor was amazing.

As for food, the plating was nice but the portions were smaller than expected. Taste was decent, nothing too extraordinary, but also nothing catastrophic.

But I must stress that the service and the ambience is amazing. Makes for a really pleasant anniversary date.

Was served mostly by Mr Ju Matto. This guy is amazing. Haha."
Jan Lunch,"Came back for the January lunch menu. Enjoyed the scallop dish, beef main and pannacotta. Atmosphere and service again was spot on"
Romantic ambience with stunning view,"Top-of-the-world feeling on the 62nd floor! Too bad it was raining so the view wasn‚Äôt as clear as we had wished. Delicious food, albeit a little too salty for the vegetables and sauces. Starters were scallops and smoked eel, mains were pan fried trout, snapper and pork fillet. Total price for 3 persons including one bottle of wine was S$411."
Anniversary celebration,"A good experience and nice view, splendid service from Fu Malto and Jovan. The foid was nice and good enough to make us full."
Birthday Meal,Very good service by Javon and Ju Matto. Delicious food and an amazing view! Love the ambience too!!
Stellar at 1 altitude,Best service to Mr Ju Matto. We enjoyed our wedding anniversary lunch here! Friendly and helpful staff. Offered us window seat once available without us request!
Warm and sincere service,"Special kudos to Tim Dopson for his warm and sincere service.

Food was not up to expectation and Stellar‚Äôs standards when we previously visited in October. Tim took special care to ensure our return visit in December was a pleasant one and importantly, that the food was good. I would say, it‚Äôs worth visiting Stellar, and should anything go wrong, people like Tim will take care of you and make things right. I‚Äôve already made plans to return next year periodically."
Birthday dinner,"We ordered burrata & scallops to share. The burrata is creamy & pairs well with sweet crunchy apples .the seared Scallops were faultless. Mains were Melt in the mouth Tasmanian ocean trout & the Australian rump was tender & has a lovely smokiness to it. Chef was really kind to specially prepare a vegetable risotto garnished with kale crisps for my vegetarian daughter. Chocoholics will love The chocolate mushroom tart that have different textures of choc combination in 1 choc dish! Another creative sweet is the citrus sorbet with an Unusual combinations of carrots, cherry tomatoes, mangoes & more that turns out well. Service is more than excellent & We were well taken care throughout the evening by Juno Matto. He was attentive without being intrusive. It was a great birthday dinner & we can‚Äôt wait to go back with friends for the great panoramic view, great food & service!"
Boxing day lunch,Staff that attended us are very friendly and attentive and the food and free flow wines are good as well.
Needs to improve on professionalism and image,Appetizer was nice but main course and dessert did not suit our taste. Not worth the money. Restaurant seemed to hire majority younger staff who looked like students.
The view is good,"And the staff are quite attentive. A very limited menu. Starter had scallops. Tasted asparagus and beef tongue. The scallops overcooked bland and poorly presented. The asparagus very ordinary. The tongue bland and tasteless
Main course had pork nondescript and plated in a very amateurish way. Tasted
The trout and the desserts weird . Mushrooms with chocolate desert kafir lime leaves in another. Very expensive and frankly not worth 50% of the cost
Didsppointed"
Lives up to its name!,"Enjoyed a lovely evening with 4 other colleagues over dinner last Wed night. Honestly, I had expected the view from the 62nd floor to be better than the food, but we were truly blown away by the food and service. The service was a true standout with being attentive yet not intrusive. Definitely plan to return again soon!"
Nice ambience and excellent service,The service was excellence especially a big thumb for ju matto and Alex. Will definitely pay a visit again
Good place for birthday dinner!,"We were served by Ju Maffo and Alex, their service is excellent! We were told that all window seats were booked 1 month ago, so we didn‚Äôt get the window table in the first place. After knowing that today is my birthday, Mr. Maffo shifted us to one of the window table which was cleared up not long ago! Appreciate it!
We ordered the 5 courses set. The Seaba fish is amazing! Overall, it‚Äôs a good dining place for special occasions!!:)"
Early Christmas Lunch with Bestie,Nice ambience and great view at level 62. Salad was so so.. But the main Red Snapper was really nice and also the Pork Belly. Dessert according to my friend was really enjoyable. Service at our table was really excellent. Thanks to Alvin and Ju Matto.
Special place for celebration,"Celebrated our wedding anniversary. Hostess found out about it. They took care to add special touches eg complimentary amuse bouche, giving us a window seat when available, which made it special. Our service staff Ju Matto provided excellent service. Very attentive. Food was good. Glad we came here for our special day."
Working lunch,"Excellent ambience, food and service care from Matto & Wee Chong! Will definitely be back for more! Views of the Singapore skylines are beautiful."
