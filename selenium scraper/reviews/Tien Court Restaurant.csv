Tien court,"Came with family for cny. Excellent food for the value. Friendly staff and service. Would highly recommend! Special thanks to Kinki, Ah Ho and Joanne."
Dining,"Execellent food, will be back soon Just book for CNY. My friend also book for their next visit as well."
Above average,"First visit, the double -boiled beauty collagen fish maw soup was okay.
The pomfret fish with tomato and pickled vegetable was also okay, pretty ordinary dish.
The teochew poached crispy with oyster was good, can repeat order this dish.
The home made Tau suan was okay better than the one at my hawker stall.
All these are their signature dishes. Total spending = SGD91, worth it?
Ambience okay and normal customer service."
Really good food and service,Food and service was good! All the staff were so friendly and efficient. Very positive vibes. A special mention to Kinki Teoh who was so patient with our requests and always so friendly and efficient. We will definitely come back again!
"Great food, must try",Would recommend this place. The food is good and the fish maw soups are a must order. Would be back again
Tasty Food,"Must try the cod fish cubes that were deep fried. The prawn mayo balls were also superb. First time visiting and definitely not the last.

Will be back for more!!"
Mother’s Day menu 2022,"Appetiser was a prawn/lobster ball, another course was one single spare rib. Requested for xo sauce in the noodles to be served separately but this was forgotten. Very very average experience for the price."
Excellent service and a great dining experience,"Very much enjoyed our dining experience, excellent food and service by our waiter Chris, who was always attentive and pro-active in making our lunch enjoyable."
Tien Court Restaurant,Superb food and service. The restaurant manager was informative and provided excellent information and recommendation.
Best Teochew food in SG,"Finally got round to tasting the food here and every serving was licked clean. Not only was food plated beautifully, tasty without leaving you thirsty, the wide range and quick service was such a delight. free parking too (complimentary carpark coupon issued when paying the bill). even if not a member, can still get discount with OCBC or UOB credit cards."
Excellent service,Outstanding service especially with manager Joanne Ooi makes me wanted to come back again.Approachable and knowledgeable
TIEN COURT Restaurant,Very polite service amd food is really delicious. Must try DEEP FRIED GLUTINOUS DUMPLING with MINCED CHICKEN. Wrap/skin is thin n crisp.
Waited 1 hour for my 3rd dish,3rd visit here. Ordered the set menu. Worst service experience I ever had in a restaurant. Restaurant is not crowded but waited for 1 hour for my 3rd dish. Worst is even after the dish they don't even bother to clear it.
Fantastic service and nice teochew food,"We went to Tien Court restaurant to celebrate new year and a birthday lunch. Service was excellent; Chris was very attentive to our table. We enjoyed the food , particularly he Black Pork dish (second picture); if you go to Tien Court, you definitely should order it! It was a good meal to start the year !"
Fantastic service,"Went for NYE dinner and was served by Chris. Very friendly and attentive. Thumbs up . Goodness pretty good as well but the salter egg prawns was below expectations, as we can't really taste the salter egg"
Excellent food and service,"It was my first time at the restaurant. The moment we entered the restaurant, we were greeted with warmth. We arrived at 630pm and restaurant started getting crowded by 7 to 730pm. It has a cosy and homely feel which I like. The staff were attentive and obliging. The Teochew style food is delectable and suited my palate very much. I had the pig stomach soup. The pig stomach soup is a combination of pig stomach and salted veg duck soup. I like both soups so I find the combi delicious. I love the tau suan with orange peel too. Very refreshing after taste - best dessert to end the meal with."
great experience,"good food, good service:)
had a great experience here
staff was very friendly
overall it was an amazing experience."
First timer,"Good food, good service, good experience, good wine
Even though, it was my first time here but the environment was my welcoming"
Great service,"Carina and team given us a great and awesome service
Will be back for more next time
Keep it up for the great service"
Hidden gem and a shame it is totally under the radar,"I was thinking hard of where to go for my dim sum and decided to give Tien Court a try after the usual suspects of Wah Lok and Hua Ting are full.

The ambience is elegant and the service staff are professional, pleasant and display a good balance of prompt attention but unrushed service.

Every of the 9 items we chose was immaculately cooked. We particularly loved the yam dim sum and prawn dumplings. Both are way better than all the branded restaurants we have tried in Singapore.

The only negative point is a relatively short list of dim sum. But we said we will return."
Regular dinner,"Excellent service and food from the Tien court team.

Good food, recommendation and hospitality

We wish the best for them in these difficult times"
Great brunch spot,The service rendered by Chris and his team was excellent! And the food was amazing! I would definitely come back again and recommend Tien Court to friends and family!
Nom Nom TV- valent’s edition,"food was fantastic! loved the plating and garnish! absolutely adored the black sea cucumber and abalone in oyster sauce ❤️❤️ crispy on the outside, soft and savoury in the inside saliva drop drop with the prawn and cabbage roll and crab meat!! hao chi orh!"
Tien Court,Nice cosy place for dinner. Good recommendations on dishes by Chris. The promfet needs some improvements. The chicken and the fish maw with fresh prawn is nice.
Wonderful restaurant ❤️,My family went to the restaurant for Mother’s Day celebration. The restaurant provided quality food and top notch service. Recommended food by Zhiling are so yummy. Food is reasonably priced. Thanks to the team for their excellent customer service. Definitely an under-rated restaurant. We will return!
Tien Court Dim Sum,Very good dim sum and service from Chris! The other dishes were crispy and hot which makes the whole experience very enjoyable.
Birthday dinner,"Well service provided by the staff especially Si Yuan and Joanne who are well trained.
Prompt services especially helping us to do the cutting of cakes and packing of food."
Tien Court King's Copthorne,"Teochew style Chilled crab around 400g was fresh and meaty. Do try Signature crispy noodle, worth to wait."
Ala Carte Buffet - Value for Money,"The last we went to Tien Court was like 20 years ago. Back then, food was superb & taste good.
This time, food was good too but kind of not as good as compared those years.
However, service was prompt and fast and the staff were warm and friendly."
Fantastic service. Authentic cuisine,"Fantastic service.food is good and staff is attentive.

Have been here for the original Cantonese dishes."
Delightful dining experience,"Delicious food, pleasant ambience, excellent service. Thanks to Chris for the exceptional service and friendliness☺️ Will be back again!"
Good Chinese food!,Good service and good food! Relaxing ambience too. Came to dinner with my family and parents really enjoyed.
Top Notch Service & Excellent Food Quality,"This is my first visit to Tien Court, my family and I were totally won over by the food quality and staff’s service.

Chris Toh was the staff who served us and he was a marvellous multi-tasker. As there was a wedding lunch going on, could tell that the restaurant was seriously under-staffed, Chris was simultaneously serving 3-4 tables but that did not affect the quality of service he delivered at all. He made great food recommendations and was very attentive, making sure that our needs were well taken care of.

Food was of high standard and portions were reasonable. Had dim sum and a few a la crate dishes for lunch, we would definitely return to the restaurant for more meals."
Enjoyable dinner at Tien Court,Had an excellent dinner with family at Tien court with impeccable service by Chris. The dishes suggested were tasty! Heard menu changing on 1st May
Tien Garden - Great Food & Service,"Have dinner at Tien court with wife and friend. Great food recommendation and service by Chris Toh!

Food was great too!"
Superb Cantonese Food Corpthorne King,"Great service, value for money and authentic ambience. Easy for folks who are driving as the parking and restaurant proximity is quite near.

Special mentioned of this super attentive service staff; from picking up the call to place reservation till bidding farewell at the restaurant, they fared really well in all angle.

Portion of staple food can be improved. That is my only feedback. Rest I can say it is all compliment.

A gem of restaurant under MCIL group.

Tips: one of the best Yam Paste with Ginko Nuts that I had in my life."
Delicious Cantonese cuisine & great service!,"It was our first time here and we celebrated my husband's and auntie's birthdays. Food was delicious, price reasonable and I'd like to thank Chris Toh for his excellent service. He even arranged complimentary longevity buns for the birthday peeps. Worth a visit!"
CNY 2021,"Cny set menu is delicious esp the braised pork. Service is excellent, staff are attentive to our table. Highly recommended!"
Dinner at Tien Court Restaurant,"We have always enjoyed the food her. Joanne the restaurant manager is attentive to our needs and very friendly. She makes our visits more satisfying. Their new captain Chris is a delightful addition.
Thank you Tien Court."
Dinner for the family,"Chris Toh is an excellent service staff. He recommended very good dishes. Pork shang with dried oysters and black moss what an apt dish fir CNY. Stir-fried beef cubes in Japanese style, fantastically tender. We enjoyed every dish.
Carpark is easily available. Check in was smooth. Very good dining experience."
Excellent Chinese cuisine,"Excellent Chinese food and dim sum , excellent service . Our server Chris was really helpful and attentive."
Interesting buffet spread to cater to covid regulations,"5 pax dining with Chinese cuisine buffet. Found the food to be value for money S$56++ per pax and some items are available for re-ordering. There were also some signature dishes for one-time consumption.
Found the staff to have improved and 'Ricky' who attended to us were helpful, patient and informative.
Keep it up!"
Good value ala carte buffet,"Tien court known for its taste and quality didn't fail to deliver in my return visit.

Special mention on server, Liu Siyuan for his excellent service and attentiveness. Thumbs up."
Have a most delicious Cantonese meal here!,"What a little gem. Restaurant small and cosy. Menu of modest spread. Food was distinctly Cantonese of a high quality. Make sure you order their soup of the day - rich, classic, mouth-watering. Every dish was excellently done - we had roast pork, scallops and egg white with crab meat, abalone and chicken in claypot.

It was full even on a Monday evening - it’s possible that patrons are making use of their ala carte card food vouchers, but hey, you get 15% off with Citi cards! Not many staff, but they were attentive and proactive.

Will come back. Maybe off-peak, when parking space is easier to find!"
Another of Singapore's great Chinese restaurants,"So many Chinese restaurants to choose from but Tien Court at the Copthorne King's Hotel is another one worth a visit. Attentive and efficient staff plus good quality food. Again, it's one of those must book restaurants especially at the weekend serving Cantonese and Szechaun cuisine"
Tien Court Customers Service,"Tien Court staff are very friendly and efficient. They are attentive to the customer needs and willing to serve. In term of food, I am impressed by their innovation of new dishes and all of them are delicious."
Dinner at tien court,Service was excellent. Food quality was good. Very satisfactory dinner. Everyone enjoyed the meal . The service staff was very attentive and helpful. She would recommend dishes to try.
Good food n excellent service,"The food is nice and the service of Joanne Ooi is excellent , prompt and she always serves with a smile .. every waitress and waiter should learn from her ."
Tien Court Dim Sum,Dim Sum was excellent as usual. Actually it has improved tremendously these few months. Definitely worth recommending to all.
Good Food and Service,The simple sauteed shiitake mushrooms were a joy to relish slowly while the red bean pastry crispy and satisfying. Adding very attentive excellent service was the proverbial icing on the cake.
Incredible Chinese cuisine with Excellent service standard,"You have to try to believe & Tien Court will leave you wanting more ! Along with impeccable service standard from Joanne, Miao Miao & Xiao Hong - double thumbs up for a Great job !!"
Birthday celebration,"I called the night earlier to reserve whole Peking duck. The Peking duck was good. Paid additional $22 to fry the duck meat with Yee fu noodle and mushroom which was yummy, the vegetable, tang Hoon , mushroom with a little
soup was delicious and the beef was really tasty and tender. The dinner was really good and the service was very attentive and very good. We will come again."
The service and the food : Double Thumbs Up !,Not often and not everywhere can you enjoy fine cuisine matched by excellent service standard. Come to Tien Court - you will find them both here.
Dinner,Good food and relax ambiance. Most tables are occupied however the space between is wide ..giving a sense of privacy. Food are timely serve and attentive staffs make the experience of dining nice.
Consistently Good Food With Great Service,"Last month i made several visits to this restaurant as it gives me satisfaction in their cuisine and their friendly , unpretentious & efficient service . I seemed to be specially attracted to their appetisers like Vegetarian Goose -amongst the best i tasted in town . Thanks also to the fine services given by Siow Hom and Joanna (Jolene?) ,just to name a few . Prices are bit on the high side however the ambience & the privacy make it worthwhile ."
Great good good service,Some items are not in their ala carte menu - including shark cartilage soup and claypot sea cucumber.... ooh they were so delicious. and the sea perch was also nicely done. It's not cheap but it makes for a nice birthday lunch for a couple... Didn't try their dim sum this time... will do so next round.
Interesting and good,"Spacious, relaxing and not crowded that day. We had a nice private room with good service: the food was low salt and good. No sign of high Ajinomoto content. We had the
Tea smoked duck, and tofu braised with roasted pork. The Scallop on Eggplant was superb! The Kai Choy with crabmeat was nice - crunchy n succulent. The Herbal double boiled soup was pleasant and appreciated.
Will return."
Good food as usual,The food is consistently good and delicious. Have been to Tien court several times and the food does not disappoint.
Slow service,"Visited on 26Nov (Mon) evening. Ordered one of their family set. Food was served very slowly, with a break of more than 15mins between each dish. Disappointed; was expecting a better standard. To be fair food was ok but definitely worth another visit."
Dim Sum Lunch with Excellent Service,"We had dim sum lunch at Tien Court.
It is located at level 2 of King Copthorne Hotel. We drove there and we missed the entrance to the carpark twice. Not very noticeable. And the Google map is not updated so we missed the entrance.

The hotel itself is quite deserted and the restaurant seems like very high class but not many people dine here.

We ordered the dim sum in the attached photos. Not too bad but of cos price is at a higher end.

Their service is excellent. Make you feel at ease. We spent about S$150 and they offer a car park coupon to us."
Yummy & Good Service,"Tien Court is an established Chinese restaurant that has been around for a long time. I can't remember when the last time I visited this restaurant and so I am happy to get invite for dinner on a Friday night.

Arriving earlier than the host, I asked the Captain how much is the corkage charge as I brought a bottle of red. To my surprise, she waived the corkage charge. Looking through the menu, it seems that most of the dishes are charged on a per person basis rather than per portion of small, medium or large.

We ordered the following dishes -
1. Black chicken soup with bamboo fibre - yummy soup till the last drop.
2. Pan fried prawns with lemon butter - may look normal, but the lemon really enhanced the whole taste of the prawns till you literally eat to whole prawn.
3. Black pepper lamb chop with mushrooms - tender lamb chop. Black Pepper not so over empowering to the overall taste. Good to eat with white rice as it may be salty on its own.
4. Sea cucumber with spinach and mushroom - a good dish but I would prefer it with XO sauce. This will make the sauce a little starchy and yummy.
5. Green marrow vegetables - for those who love bitterness in the veggie.
6. Red bean pan cake with sesame - crispy and puffy pancake with good fill of red bean. One of the better pancakes in town!

I wanted to order the glutinous sesame rice ball coated with peanuts but Tien Court version is coated with corn flaked. The thoughtful waitress arranges a complimentary plate of 4 balls for us to try. The glutinous rice ball is soft like a mochi with good fill of sesame. I still prefer my favourite with peanuts coated.

The total bill averages about $70 per pax without wine. What I like about Tien Court is the friendly service and ambience. You can really enjoy your meal quietly with good conversation."
Excellent Dinner,"It was a pleasure to visit this restaurant. Although we did not have a reservation we were quickly allocated a table and presented with meal and drinks menus. The waitresses were charming and efficient and took the time to explain each of the dishes that we were about to order. We started with 'Nine Belly Fish' and then progressed to the 'BBQ Trio Meat Combination' for myself and 'Seafood NDL' for my wife. Sumptuous food, outstanding presentation, enough to satisfy. The accompanying beer and wine complimented the meals. A real pleasant dining experience.."
Good quality,"Was here to celebrate a birthday and was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was. Tien Court is pretty low profile in the culinary scene here and hardly receives any publicity, if at all. The food here does not break new ground and doesn't try to be creative. They stick to the classics and they do it very well. Every dish was well seasoned and balanced and the service was efficient, polite and unobtrusive. Very pleasant experience."
Attentive Staff but big disappointment,"We ordered food around 7pm tonight. At this time, the restaurant was only half occupied. First dish was served at 7:20pm. There was no serving of other dishes until 8pm. We requested the waitress to check with the kitchen several times, each time we were told to wait a while more. At 8pm, we have no choice but to request for bill since the waitress was unable to tell us what time the second dish will be served, as we are so hungry that we have to move to another restaurant to have our dinner!"
Love their dim sums!,"My colleagues and I were looking out for a restaurant to have good dim sums for lunch and we were recommended Tien’s Court. So glad we went ahead as the food and service was soooooo good and they offered a 53% discount on dim sums in view of our nation’s 53rd birthday.

Everything we ordered was good. Discount or no discount, we will definitely return. Do allow at least 2 hours here though."
Perfect for a Veggie,"I was working in the Copthorne King's Hotel and on day two we had lunch in the Tien Court Restaurant. I am a vegetarian and I have to say the food was excellent. Clear soup made with various mushrooms, not just button mushrooms either!

Then a series of dishes with vegetables and another one with mushrooms all of excellent quality.

Chinese food so it was not hot and spicy, portions not too big. Served without fuss or stress and everything arrived hot at the table."
Excellent cuisine and decor Singapore,Staying at the Copthorne Kings Hotel this restaurant is on the second floor. The food is authentic Chinese . The service was extremely good. Very enjoyable. Good portions too.
Great service and food!,"My family and I had a dinner gathering at Tien Court restaurant recently. Despite been booked for a wedding dinner, the restaurant still set aside a space for normal customers and ensured that the ambience of the restaurant was not compromised. The restaurant manager, Ms Joanne Ooi, was very friendly and provided good recommendations for our dinner orders. She also went out of her way to prepare peanuts for my nephew as appetizers. We had a really enjoyable dinner and will definitely recommend this restaurant!"
Dim Sum Lunch,"My friend and I went there on Thursday afternoon. Although there were many people around, the ambience was good and we had a good conversation over meal. We ordered Dim Sum for lunch and the quality of the food was great and the staff were attentive in serving us."
Memorable birthday,"Went there last Sunday for dad's birthday. Food as ususl was very good except the prawns were a litle smaller than expected (thus a star deduction). Place was very busy and all the waitresses were rushed off their feet. Fortunately, we had an excellent lady named Hebe, who was so cheerful and smiling always despite being so busy serving ud as well as other diners. She made some excellent recommendations re dishes to order. We were treated like royalties. She truly made our day out and dad's birthday celebrations a truly memorable one - Thank you."
Great service and good food!,"This is not a new restaurant but it has been renovated to look upbeat and spacious contemporary. Their service was very attentive and the private room was cosy and comfortable. We ordered Coconut soup which came with a large steamed prawn on a Lemon Grass scewer- the dish presentation was a work of art!! Their scallops with brinjal dish was amazingly brilliant in taste and presentation and creativity .
Mustard leaves with crab meat was tender, cooked in lots of stock - it was almost soupy, easy to enjoy. Their beef with black garlic was tender, fragrant and just right. We ordered a crispy noodle which turned out to be flat in taste, and uninteresting. We had such a pleasant dining experience here, we will return to try their other dishes."
"Went during the Chinese New Year (CNY) period, round it up for a Marginal Pass","I saw an NOC video which gave high ratings about this restaurant, so I went w my family.
It was honestly not a busy day and we are the first customer who arrived

We ordered its new year set for 4pax (shouldn't look challenging to cook or prepare)

Its yusheng (raw fish platter) for CNY seemed a tad too sour for me
Its ingredients are fresh but the meat esp chicken was closed to overcooked hence it toughen the meat

Ordered its specialty tea ie Peony (牡丹)tea that costs S$6++ each- has no sweet Peony smell at all

The quiet and non-crampy environment along with the last yam dessert at the end (which was healthy and not too sweet), was its only saving grace
While the portion is not along and shared among 4adults and one kid, somehow it made us feel very filling"
Good for family gathering,"Tien Court offers some of the best Chinese cuisine & the collection of dishes are all suitable for the entire family, young & old.
The Steamed Grouper with Superior Soya Sauce was done to perfection by the chef. Fish was fresh & moisture was locked in by this steaming process. A very healthy dish!"
Tien Court,Food was delicious and service was prompt. Value for money if you use the M&C Ala Carte program. Would not mind returning for more!
Dim Sum Lunch,The food is so so only and quite expensive. Not much Variety for Dim Sum. The staff is very attentive.
Birthday Celebration at Tien Court,"The service staff tends to speak in Mandarin and so you can find yourself at a loss if you don't speak the language.

The food was tasty but on the pricey side. The dim sum is more expensive than at most Chinese Restaurant. We came in for the earlier sitting at 11:00 am and found it very strange that although the restaurant wasn't full, they insisted that our last order was at 12:15 pm and we had to leave the restaurant by 12:45 pm. When you pay for your food, you don't expect to be ""chased out"" when you haven't decided it's time to go.

We were given the later option of starting at 1:00 pm but didn't want it as we were afraid we would be kept waiting if the earlier round of patrons had not finished their lunch.

So if you are coming for dim sum, opt for the later sitting."
SHC,I invited a family of an old friend from Melbourne recently for dinner. They were very much impressed by the food. Tien Court is one of my favorite Chinese Restaurant in Singapore with Master Chef Ho Tien Tsai in charge not only for Cantonese but also for Sichuan and other types of cuisine as well. It is especially famous for Dim Sum during lunch time. The pricing is reasonable and the quality of food is never compromised. A good restaurant for all occasions dining.
Good food average service,Visited for dim sum on a Sunday afternoon. I wasn't informed that they had an event and that the main restaurant is closed for an event. The background music was too loud and gave me a headache. The dim sum was good but on the expensive side if not for a 50% discount voucher. The staff was not attentive to my table and I had to consistently ask for service.
Good Overall,Good food & environment. Paintings on the wall are too twee for my liking. Some abstractions please.
Excellent service n great food,"Waitress was helpful in food selection
The sharkfin cartillage soup is delectable.
2 of us ordered 5 dshes Waitress/supervisor informed we may have over order and suggested 4 dishes 1st. True to it the food was more than sufficient. This is our 3rd visit this year and will be back next month.
2 screaming kids spoil the atmosphere but your staff rectified it after we complain."
Good as always,"Has a dim sum celebration lunch here & as always, was not disappointed. Ordered the vermicelli with pig trotters & all I can say is, 'Yummy!' One disappointment was the dessert, Black Glutinous Rice with coconut ice-cream; wished that the glutinous rice was hot instead of cold."
A little disappointing,Booked at last minute. Service was slow and food indifferent. Starter was good but rest of food was a little disappointing. We were the only non-Chinese people there though so perhaps we just caught them on an off day as it was clearly popular.
Top class restaurant,"Food good; services good; price on high side. Restaurant small, but atmosphere good. Planning not so good in purchasinng the raw material. Can you imagine there was no 苋菜？ The manager said finished by lunch time. It should be replanished in the afternoon."
Bland and expensive restaurant food,"The environment and service of the restaurant is good. Tried the roested pork, long beans, soup and a few seafood abd vegetable dishes. However, these ala carte dishes are mostly bland and ""nothing special"". The price is high."
Good food and nice ambience,Best Peking duck in town and excellent service provided by the staff. A great place to host your special occasion.
Satisfying lunch. Burp,"Lunched at Tien, a cozily decked out venue with noteworthy food. Am still in the throes of food coma. But can recall some items – Peking Duck, crispy cod, vegetarian soup and a jellied dessert of sorts.

Duck was flavorful. And is recommended. Contrary to my expectation of all things vegetarian, my soup (including mushroom) was tasty! As though it was a meat dish. Crispy cod is worth returning to the restaurant for."
Yum,Highly exceptional service and delectable Cantonese food. It gets very busy so making a reservation is crucial. Dim sum is tasty. Desserts are great to cleanse the palatte. Try the avocodo coconut icecream.
✨ The outstanding waiter LIU SIYUAN ✨,"The acid test of hospitality is when the restaurant is packed and the waiters are few.

When I arrived, my Mom informed me that the waiter had already urged her to place our orders so as to shorten the waiting.

Courteous and considerate, Liu Siyuan recommended the right mix of dishes. What impressed me was his candor when he steered me away from expensive choices that would not meet the expectations of the 4 teenagers in our group.

In between several tables of guests demanding his attention, Siyuan maintained his composed smiles and even bothered to distribute our food into individual portions.

In contrast the other waitresses were slipshod in their work.

The Tien Court food was good, expensive unless you have the Millennial Ala Carte vouchers.

However, our family's time there was made pleasurable because of the impeccable hospitality of LIU SIYUAN. Thank you, Siyuan!!"
Nice dim sum,"Visited the restaurant for dim sum today. The food is refined and tasty. I liked the char siew pau, deep fried spring rolls, pan fried carrot cake, porridge and steamed Malay cake."
Great dim sum,"The restaurant serves a good range of dim sum for lunch. the dim sum was refined and tasty. As the restaurant is outside the CBD, it is not too busy and you get to enjoy an unhurried meal."
Tailored CNY Set Menu Dinner for 2,It was during the Chinese new year period which the restaurant offers set menu for minimum 4 persons. it was very nice of them to adjust the set menu for 2 so that we could also eat the Chinese new year dishes. Great table deco and ambiance too. Great!
Very expensive Chinese Food,Difficult to chose from the menu as the food was not well described. $88 for a bottle of very average Australian red wine. A bottle that would cost us $10... the service was slow. Don't accept the nuts or the green tea (tea bag included) as it will cost you $4 each. Even if you didn't order it!
Should be renamed MSG King's,"Went to the restaurant last week. Developed a massive headache after 5 mouthfuls of the fried bee hoon. Seems like the restaurant kitchen does not know how to cook anything without using MSG. Either that or the hotel must have gotten a great deal on MSG cos they were dishing it out in everything that came out of the kitchen. I had originally wanted to order more food, but with the throbbing headache, I just wanted to drink lots of water and get out of the place. I think the whole hotel chain specialises on MSG food."
Dissapointed,"As a regular diner, my last visit a few days ago was a little letdown,
The food portions seems to have shrank and the food wasn't to par.
Although the restaurant wasn't crowded, we waited quite a while for the food to be served.
Also, this is the only hotel carpark we know off that gives you a complimentary carpark only for you to discover that you have to pay a discounted fee of S$3.57 !"
Little Things Matter Big,"Resplendent Chinese Fine Dining restaurant. We had lobster noodle, sweet n sour pork, roast duck, fried cod fish, deep fried brinjal topped wth pork floss, soup in a bamboo cup, red bean pancake, jelly-like dessert (see photos)

Overall, the food was 'ok'... though I shudder to question if the re-used bamboo cup is safe to drink from.

Service was 'so-so' .. nothing exciting. A great deal more of ""customer focus"" is needed to delight dinners instead of stifling them with boring robotic attention.

For example, we had to ask for spoons when having our lobster noodle which was pleasantly drowned in superior broth. I guess common sense is not so common after all."
Tien Court Restaurant,"A group of us had Dinner at the Tien Court Restaurant, located Level 2, Copthorne King’s Hotel, Havelock Road.
This Chinese fine dining award-winning Restaurant serves Cantonese and Szechuan dishes and has a wide range of dishes on its menu for your choice. We had an eight course dinner and the dishes didn’t disappoint. The Yam Paste dessert is worth special mention as it was smooth and not too sweet.
We had a good meal and it is worth to check it out if you enjoy good food."
Terrific Meal,We dined one eevning whilst staying at the Copthorne Kings Hotel as this restaurant is on the second floor. The meal and service were excellent.
Great Service. Wonderful food,Came here for a business dinner. Set menu that we couldn't finish. Appetizer was great with slices of garlic. Duck noodles were great. Fish was delicious. didn't like the cheese scallops though. Dessert was great. Service was also good.
well prepared delicious,"Very nice restaurant, food excellent, staff friendly and efficient. I went in about 20 mins before closing and didn't feel rushed food was cooked properly and presented well and very good"
