Beautiful Bar & Drinks,"I was served and recommended at breakfast to this amazing bar. I loved everything about the Astor Bar. From the live Jazz music to the great service by the lovely staff. She made some of the best drinks I’ve ever had in Singapore. Thanks for the memories, I’ll definitely be back.

Many thanks to Chistianne & Rezza"
Amazing Imran!,"It’s my #1 spot to have a drink in Singapore Such a cosy and exquisite place to chill and have a drinks, the champ Imran always making top nudge cocktails driving back to Astor bar again and again."
One Drink & I Literally Go Home,"Stepped into the bar and was instantly greeted by a smiling face. Stopped in to just try their signature Bloody Mary and ended up striking up a conversation with the friendly team. Got a few amazing local recommendations and thoroughly enjoyed my time.

To Raza and Sahil, you guys are superstars and made my night."
Gorgeous Bar,"Gorgeous Bar, amazing food, and great service. Would definitely recommend a visit here. I would recommend ordering the truffle fries, they are delicious!"
Fabulous NYE cocktail brunch!,Fabulous cocktail brunch in Singapore! Child free makes it a laid back enjoyable adults only experience in keeping with the St Regis DNA. Great food and great cocktails. Excellent service. Who could ask for anything more!
Proposal success,"Amazing atmosphere, and wonderful service from both the counter staff and the jazz band! Special shout out to Ianne, Rena, Jisu and Virat for helping make this special occasion a success! They were all so helpful and accommodating with my request to make my proposal an excellent success . The band was also so helpful with playing our favourite Jazz standards for the evening. The complementary chocolate martini were really such a nice way to round up the celebration and evening. A must visit for jazz and cocktail lovers"
Wonderful night !,Visited the bar after my dinner upstairs. A very warm welcome from the lovely Korean lady - JinSoo. We were so happy to have her recommended cocktails. Just nice for that night! Great ambience and very good services. Sure will visit again. Thank you !
Such an incredible night!,"I brought a couple of friends to the Astor bar and met Christianne, who was so friendly and accommodating. She even recommended and made cocktails perfect for our liking! It was such a lovely night so we drink more than we planned to.😅"
Amazing chill out Bar,We’ve been to this bar numerous times and it’s out 1st time sitting by the bar because it’s full house tonight. Guess what? It’s amazing chatting with the bartender and pick up some skills in artisan cocktail. Can’t wait to try out some of the tips provided by Imran.
Good to be back!,"It is over three years since I last visited Singapore and I took the opportunity to pop into the Astor Bar, an old favourite haunt of mine.

I am delighted to report that I received an exceptionally warm welcome from Imran and Ron. Service and standards were impeccable as usual, but more importantly for me was the genuine friendship and hospitality of the team. This is a place where relationships are built as opposed to transactions undertaken. I felt valued."
Drinks are strong!,"If you like a strong drink, this is the place to go! Their specialties are spice infused drinks, if you like spices then worth a try!"
Cosy place,"Staff was very nice and friendly. Nice ambience and seating to have a nice chat and drinks. Maybe with Covid measure relaxed, music will make it even more conducive."
Super Good service and drink experience,Had a great glass of chablis recommended by the bartender Von. Service was immaculate and had a great drink experience! Will come back for more when dining-in is allowed
"Perfect ambience for a date, excellent bartender Von","Went to the bar for a celebration on Saturday night (12/12/20), and was served by Von. The ambience of the bar was great for a date night, and the service was impeccable. We want to extend our gratitude towards Von especially, who decided on the drinks for us when we couldn't, and her choices were perfect to each of our liking. Amazing experience, would definitely return!"
Relax after Black Friday,"Amazing bar....Astor was an awesome experience to visit.The staff Imran,Von is very freindly.Me and my freind visited there it was wonderful n enjoyable atmosphere. Drinks n food very nice ..one of the staff, Jinny was very very freindly.We wish to visit again n again ...."
special day in a special place,"my girlfriend and I always come here for for some lychee martinis, always good experience and satisfying everytime we visit astor bar. always a warm welcome from jo. she already knows what we want and prefer seat."
Great Cocktails!,Really nice hotel bar. Loved the food and cocktail selections here. We met up with some friends for drinks here.
Champagne hour magic,"My friends and I had another great night at the Astor Bar last week - their champagne hour from 6.30pm to 7.30pm (serving Ruinart) is a wonderful treat if you love bubbles!

We were very well looked after by Jinny, who was very helpful and understood what good service was. Thank you Jinny!

The bar itself has a lovely, comfortable yet classy vibe, and the live music is always an enjoyable part of the night. We will be back again soon! Thank you!"
Never disappoints,"Brought my client to the Astor Bar for his first time and I'm delighted to know he enjoyed the drinks and service rendered by Bantu, Jo and Von on that night. Kudos to the manager for leading such an exceptional team that never disappoints!"
Not a big fan of Bloody Mary,"Not a big fan of Bloody Mary but the staff here are so helpful to recommend their signature drink, I’m surprised that I kinda love it now. I’ll be back to try the other version of it. Recommend for special occasions,love the atmosphere cozy and quiet. Thanks to the staff for friendly recommendations. I can barely read your name,I think it’s Jo."
Pub food overpriced,"I am surprise with the high reviews. We live nearby and came here with the hope it could become one of our neighborhood options. After all we love cocktails, jazz and live music! The ONLY good thing about the place is the staff. Very polite and helpful. There are 2 reasons why I would not recommend at all this place: 1. Food is dreadful. I don't mind paying 24 dollars for a plate of veg somosas or satays or nearly 30 for simple sliders...but I do expect that the quality is significantly better that what I can get in an average restaurant. Clearly it is VERY average. To give you examples to compare: Cross Roads Cafe at the Marriot, The Hilton at Orchard or the Gin Bar at Fullerton by the Bay have similar prices but MUCH better quality food. 2. The music is dreadful. I am sorry for the couple that tries their best...but, really??? Is that the quality of music St Regis can put together? Again if you want good food with good music PIM Pam Orchard or the Bar @15 stamford (Kempinsky Hotel) are FAR BETTER. In the end we paid 250 dollars (2people) for pretty much at best average pub food and left after 30 minutes of listening to a very disappointing performance. A missed opportunity."
Impeccable service,"I was with a group of friends who was heading out for a night hang out, one of my friends told me to have a look for this bar at the St Regis - astor bar.. Bar was a bit busy that night, they also have a live band and a lovely Picasso collection...one of the staff name Ron greeted us a warm welcome and seated and politely presented the menu I was not pretty sure what to drink so I ask Ron to make something special, in about a few minutes my drinks is served I would say its was a perfect mix of drinks that I have name it my own truly this place is remarkable with an impeccable service thank you astor team lead by Ron

Surely will come back and will look for Ron speciality

Kudos"
Perfect,"Housed within the world famous St. Regis is the Astor Bar. I was very pleased with the overall experience. Classy bar mandated by professionals. Just tell them what you like, and they’ll do exactly what you need. Ron provided great hospitality. Thank you, Ron and the rest of the team! Live music was above and beyond, too."
This bar is so amazing!!,"Yesterday, I visited this bar with my boyfriend. We didn’t know much about cocktails. But server Jinny recommended us some cocktail, That cocktail was soo delicious. And Jinny was so kind and nice. She cared about us all the time. We felt comfortable thanks to her."
Get cosy in Tanglin most secretive,"Get cosy in Tanglin most secretive bar Located at St. Regis Hotel Astor Bar. It's the ultimate atmospheric space, a place to entertain, celebrate a birthday, enjoy time with colleagues.meetings,parties or settle in with friends and family for the unforgettable bar experience. With a fantastic bar menu paired with an extensive cocktail and drinks menu. This place boasts a good collection of whisky and you need to try all the aged cocktails in a barrels. The live jazz music every night was perfect too. The service as always is impeccable. Thanks to Ron and Bantu!"
Excellent service!!!,"Although we didn't go into the onsite restaurant, we ordered some food at the bar a few times and it was delicious. The bar area were nice and open, good place to relax and meet friends.The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. We especially enjoyed the special bar drinks which we requested from the bartenders. One of the best place to hangout!"
Cocktails are HYPE,"If you are looking for a place for a live jazz music this is the place to be! I found myself in the surreal position while listening to them plus the cocktails are really good! The service is impeccable everyone is very friendy and approchable. Thanks to Ron, Bantu, Jinny and Von."
Fulfills the high expectations,"Warm greeting, friendly smile, professional service as expected.
The interior design could be called elegant, the seatings are very comfortable.
We enjoyed a couple oft Old Fashioned - very nice

Live music with piano and singer was great and not too loud - conversation still possible

Everything was well organised and I can warmly recommend the bar if one wants to have a good quality drink in a nice, comfortable and old style bar environment."
Amazing As Always,"Brought my friends to the Astor Bar the other night and I was not disappointed. Consistent with their service, drinks and atmosphere. I would like to thank Mr Imran for taking good care of us as well as the other staff members."
Excellent Service,This is my second visit here. And the they did not disappoint. Lately I have been to so many bar in Orchard area. This one is of the standout place. Nice and cozy atmosphere. Good service staff. Good selections of Whiskies.
High quality & good service,"Went to the astor bar the other evening and I was very impressed by their level of service and quality. Their aged cocktails are a must try, especially the aged old fashioned. Overall the ambience is good with live jazz performance, friendly staff and a good time. Thank you to the astor bar team!"
Excellent service & classic interior,"All of the staffs are amazing! They are so friendly and helpful, including the bartenders!!! Couldn’t be more thankful to them.

Secret hideaway gem - rare bar with exceptional services,"Welcoming and friendly hidden gem bar, especially these days in Singapore.
Here you can find always a very welcoming team of crew members.
Mr Ron is always very accommodating and always strive to fulfill every request.
Kudos to a great team.
Wish more bar can learn from this great service team, after all this is all about #Hospitality #Services"
Never Fail to Impress Me,"Astor Bar has always been a finale to my barhopping activity and not a even once have I been disappointed. It's surprising to see new faces, but the service is still there paired with topnotch live music. Ron, as usual is the master of the bar. Very hospitable. It is as if I am drink at a friend'a gathering. And what better way to boost the experience? Customized drink. Just describe him how you'd like the drink to be, and he'll do the work. As usual, we enjoyed going here for the nth time."
Fine hospitality and exceptional service,"I checked-in on the night of 30th to watch the concert of U2 on Dec. 1 and stayed at St. Regis. It was my last night (Dec. 2, 2019) in Singapore and i took a peek at Astro Bar around 10:30pm and approached the bar and asked the Cashier if there was a band still going to play tonight and she told me that yes, they had one more set and was going to start in 15 minutes. So thought for a while whether i should go to Orchard Road and check the events there or just check out Astor Bar.

Astor was full except for a couple of tables and few seats at the bar. I decided to have a couple of drinks at the bar. I was amazed at the efficient service of Christianne who manager to take the orders, mix the drinks and handle the cashiering service with a smile. Although limited in support with Jinny and Ong, Christianne managed to see to it that all the guests were looked after, she knew their drinks, and her team, who were on their toes at all times ensured that I and all the guests had our refills and food that was ordered. They were polite, and just happy to serve their guests, even though i stayed late and i saw everyone having a fun time.

Kudoz to Christianne, who seemed tireless and had a very pleasing personality.

Thank you Astor Bar, management for keeping such a high standard despite the limited number of hands.

Definitely, i will recommend St. Regis to my friends visiting Singapore.

Keep up the good work, guys."
Great night and experience,"We had a few days stay at St Regis and decided to visit astor bar. I personally don't drink too much, but the cocktails selections here are just right for me. They are also kind enough to make cocktail that suits my preference. Love the ambiance as always, jazz music and staff here are also helpful. Cocktail recommendations was great. Thanks to jo and the other lady who was serving me."
Top notch,Went few times to the bar and Von was newly hired. Her warm greeting and impeccable service changes the whole ambience of the bar. If you like cocktail that is made to your tasting VON is the one. VON you are the BEST!
Fantastic Drinks,"Dropped by with a couple of my girlfriends on a Wednesday evening for some drinks. The bar had a nice atmosphere with sultry jazz live music by a female singer and a pianist. A wide variety of cocktails, including some with an Asian twist. The bartender on duty was a charming young lady named Von, who provided impeccable service and top notch cocktails - that charming smile of hers just added to the experience.

10/10 would come back to have the Chilli Padi Mary again, especially when made by Von."
A treat for the senses,"Great ambiance and cosy atmosphere! The carefully hand-crafted cocktails were nothing short of ezquisite, made only sweeter by the company of charming and friendly bartender,named Von."
Warm and Friendly Service,"Cozy ambiance with nice food and drinks.
The cocktails are really tasty. Astor bar is one of the best place to go when you want to chill and relax. Service was fantastic! Special thanks to Ms. Christianne for excellent service."
Sophisticated Homage to Yesteryear of NY Bars,"A sophisticated yet comfortable setting where one could visualize the yesteryear of black and white movies with clientele clad in tuxedos and gowns... with the singer adding lyrics to melody.

Astor is a place where you get finely crafted drinks with friendly/efficient service and one can enjoy you spot in a setting that fulfills all the senses.

My drink choice - a very very dry Tanqueray martini.

Astor is a must"
Very Good Live Jazz,Nice ambience. Very good live jazz. Good cocktails. Very friendly staff. Definitely will come back again here.
"""Best place and impeccable service""",Astor bar really set's the highest standard when it comes to quality of drinks and the service they provide.

Great Service,"Right place to be not because of the settings. Its with the people. Most are very attentive, and professional. They always deliver not just the service but the right service. Especially Ron, he’s always been very accommodating. He always goes out of his way .. sincerely, he’s the reason i always come back"

Great hospitality!,"Thank you to Imran, Jo, Ong and Von for the wonderful hospitality! I was greeted by Ong when i first stepped into the bar and he amazed me with his knowledge and expertise of the different types of wine. Would love to visit again."
Delighted by the service,"It was my vacation going on and I was in Singapore, since earlier I heard a lot about Astor bar and so was I curious to visit there.. My visit to Astor bar became worth since I experienced amazing cocktail which was made by Imran which happened to be the best cocktails I have ever tasted coz that cocktail did not only spoke about the good taste but also the proffesionality. Perfect combination of liquor and must try aged negroni. Visiting Astor bar made my vacation special. Can't wait for another vacation to visit Astor bar again and trying out more and more cocktails . It was a wonderful experience"
Excellent Service and Makes me feel like home!,"I've been staying at the St. Regis Singapore for over 6 years, and the excellent service, drinks and food at this bar is the main reason I keep going back.

I literally eat and drink there everyday when I'm on business trip in Singapore. The staff makes me feel like home, great smile and radiate strong sense of positive energy. After a long and stressful day at work, once I step foot into the bar, I feel a sense of relief and all my stress just went away.

The staff Imran, Ron, Bantu and Jo are simply amazing and very engaging with the customers. Giving great recommendations of drinks and food to have at the bar and very creative in their cocktails. Their service and attentiveness to customers are commendable. Hence a lot of regular guests go there because of them, me included. Never a disappointing experience there.

The bar serves awesome premium cocktails, whiskeys and bourbons and a good varieties of bar and or restaurant food. Highly recommend this bar and look for anyone of them and that will just finish off your day with a smile!"
Excellent Service As Ever,"As a regular guest who hold important business meetings in Astor Bar, having an excellent team who can be trusted to take good care of me and my VIP guests are extremely important to me.

Astor Bar team comprising of Mr Imran, Mr Ron, Ms Jo, Ms Christianne, Mr Bantu and Mr Ong never fail to impress my guests and myself with their impeccable service, patience and never-say-no attitude. I always feel safe to host my VIP clients and guests here at Astor Bar.

After my work and dinner, this is my Number 1 place to unwind till it closes. When my work ends late, this is THE place to have my dinner.

It is precisely this Astor Bar team who put a face and warmth to the brand and institution. I congratulate the management in having a great team in place. This place is like a second home to me.

Great job!"
Perfect for a Night Cap!,The aged cocktails are are really good for a night cap drink must try the aged manhattan and aged negroni and aged old fashioned! If your are looking for a very refreshing drinks you need to try the make your own gin and tonic. The bar staff is very attentive and helpful! Definitely one of the best hotel bar in Singapore!
Outstanding Service + Superb Booze,If you are looking for a very relaxing place to hang out you need to visit this awesome bar. Live jazz music every night plus the superb booze and the outstanding service from the team equals a memorable experience. The place is Super crowded especially during weekends but the atmosphere is really positive.
Best Cocktail Bar in SGP after a long day,"My favourite cocktail bar in SGP, esp after a long day at work, or for a celebration. Superb range of whisky, comfortable seating, great ambience. I go here for pre-dinner cocktails; Ron, the Chief Barman, makes the BEST Manhattens in SGP (or Asia... in fact the world!), and then post meal digestifs. ALL the staff are friendly, attentive (without being overly intrusive) and just thoroughly professional.
There is live ""music"", although the recently duo, whilst no doubt talented, seem to play modern jazz, which is not my scene. The last guy was more suited to helping you relax. Hey ho"
David's Birthday & Regular Visits On A Weekly Basis in St Regis Hotel S'pore.,"All along my impression of The Astor The Astor Bar is cosy,elegant & comfortable. I thank the ex General Manager, Mr Xavi & Miss Denise Matthijsse, Food & Beverage Director of The St Regis S'pore for having re-emphasized on the 6 star hotel's core value to all staffs in The Astor Bar. Whether you like it or not, guests' satisfaction & comfort are of paramount importance for the hotel industry. I would expect a 6 star hotel to be very service orientated & to treat every customer's feedback seriously. In my opinion, a successful hotel is one with happy guests, too besides huge profits because good image is necessary for long term future growth & word of mouth can be effective. Where you are at currently in your life is largely contributed by your belief & value system years ago & your future shall be determined by your belief & values today. Same for any organisation or hotel. Guests in your 6 star hotel pay for 6 star service & ambience; therefore, this must be catered for at all times! A piece of steak which is a bit rotten one part is entirely rotten! Any decent hotel's priority is their guests. Ron, the bartender is friendly & responsible. He exhibits professionalism, good attitude towards all guests & his service is excellent.I am very happy & impressed with the new team in The Astor Bar.They are professional, responsible, prompt, alert, approachable & hardworking. The Astor Bar seems to be a lot busier during the recent months.
I have discovered The Astor Bar in The St Regis hotel S'pore after having checked it out some two years ago. I frequent The Bar in The St Regis hotel New York each time I was on vacation in Manhattan, New York. It used to be a happening Bar in the evenings.The Astor Bar serves one of my favourite champagnes and a selection of good wines befitting that of a 6 star exquisite hotel. Some champagnes and wines in the market does cause me to have stomach ache & headache."
Amazing bar....,Hi it was an awesome experience to visit astro bar. The staff is very freindly and loyal . We group of freinds visited there it was wonderful n enjoyable atmosphere. Music was excellent... Drinks n food very nice ..one of the staff very very freindly and jolly Mr. Bantu & team staff members ... we wish to visit again n again ....
"Still the best... unparalleled, unmatched.","What makes a particular place the best is not the food nor the ambiance, what makes it a standout among the rest is the vibe and feelings that it gives you. Visiting Astor Bar is always a delight, friendly staffs, superstar level performances, and on top of that... decent selection of drinks and food items. I ordered the freshest burrata I’ve had in my life over the years, the chef was marvellous in drizzling it with truffles, and Ron was genius in recommending that we try it with a warm bread and gave it to us as a treat. Overall, the service, vibes and the food was outstanding. We will surely be coming back again."
Great staffs with excellent service ever !,"The atmosphere is great to relax with a soft music ,
Excellent service from the best staffs ever ! I really enjoyed for my first visit to St Regist at Singapore , Definitely I’ll come back here again , and clearly you need try the signature Bloody marry and Whiskey sour cocktails , Astor bar Definitely worth a visit ."
Best Service + Amazing Drinks,One of the best whisky collection in Singapore! The aged cocktails are phenomenal mostly are classic with a twist on it. The service is impeccable everyone is very attentive and friendly! Highly recommended if you're looking for a place to hangout.
"Great stop for a drink, amazing service",Had a quick stop for a GT and was blown away by the service. Will stop at the Astor again when in SG.
"Champagne ""Happy Hour""","Make sure you arrive in time for the Champagne ""Happy Hour"".
Do I need to explain why.
Champagne was great!"
Service not up to standards,We have been patrons for 10 years and it's been at least 4 years that we noticed that the service threes really not up to standards of a 5 star hotel.
"""Excellent staff, excellent bar""","I was there with a friend for a wonderful evening. Very excellent services from Imran and Ron. Would love to come back again. Well, they have absolutely the best services and cocktails in the town. Thumbs up."
good for an apertif,"could do without the lounge singer, but the drinks are pretty good albeit expensive, on par with the rest of singapore"
"Excellent Service, Disappointing Wine Selection","First of all, I am a regular guest at St Regis Singapore and its Astor Bar.

I am extremely well taken care of by the staff at Astor Bar, Mr Imran, Mr Ron, Ms Jo, Ms Christianne, Mr Bantu and Mr Kevin every single time I visited Astor Bar for my business meetings in the afternoons and relaxation in the late evenings.

Recently I’ve a few important guests who ordered a few good wines from the Astor Bar wine list and none of them was available. This is deeply disappointing and embarrassing as the brand Astor Bar means something. So in the end the guests’ mood were dampened and they left shortly.

This is not befitting the standard of St Regis Astor Bar, where the staff did an excellent job, only to be let down by the wine inventory.

The F&B management needs to look into this seriously and rectify this asap. Thank you."
Evening drinks with excellent entertainment,The staff were extremely friendly and efficient. The entertainment was also excellent. The Bar has a great atmosphere.
Par Excellence,"The ambiance, the singers and the service were excellent. It had a great atmosphere and the singers could sing really well. The lady server was very patient in taking our orders and even offered to let my friend try a small sample of wine when she did not know which type would suit her. It was a great night out for us. The server even checked with the kitchen and the chef accommodated our request for a smoked salmon salad. Thank you, Astor Bar! We had a great time. Hope to see you again soon!"
Picasso’s on the wall,"It’s not that often that a hotel bar has a collection of Picasso’s in the wall. Well the St Regis hotel has a couple of them and you can get pretty close to observe them. The bar is on the ground floor, right around the corner near the entrance. Clearly you need to try the signature Bloody Mary cocktail which has a few local variants as well. Definitely worth a visit."
Beautiful ambiance and awesome life jazz!,"Great place to relax, beautiful ambiance and great life Jazz to enjoy. I definitely would come back here again! The atmosphere is just great to relax."
The best staff ever!!!,"Just a shout out to ALL ASTOR BAR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! You guys are all amazing! Very professional, personable and excellent service!"
Memorable experience at St. Regis,"This is quite a nice bar. But, what makes it really special is the pianist, Ron. He sings and plays with passion, and knows many songs well. I requested him to play three classic oldies for my daughter to dance along. She had a wonderful time. That was one of the highlights of our stay at St. Regis Singapore. Thanks to Ron!"
"nice ambience, quiet at night (late night)",The waitress served us with a smile and the drinks were as expected. Enjoyed a late night conversation with colleagues.
"Nice bar , music is a bit loud","We called in for a drink as friends , unfortunately the piano player, who appears to be a nice chap, sings way to loud for a small bar and the key he sings in , is no base, makes it hard to have a relaxed conversation."
Cosy Atmosphere,An intimate and cosy bar next to the main entrance of the St Regis Hotel. Good selection of drinks and snacks with excellent and attentive service.
Great bar with amazing service,"Visiting the Astor Bar on a regular basis when in Singapore, as a couple and frequently with a group of friends. Service is always above and beyond standards, professional and warm making you feel very welcome all the time. Highly recommended for any occasion."
"Always good service, good light meals and good Dirty martinis","As per the brief overview. Liked their old crystal martini glasses better. Grilled prawns, Thai mango salad was perfect for a light dinner. I often go the St Regis as the service from the doorman and taxi stand to throughout is excellent."
Lovely athmosphereme,Lovely place for an afternoon drink. Nice piano music and perfect service. Maaany types of whiskey!!
Relaxing Bar,Met a Friend here for a few drinks. The service staff were excellent and the house wine extremely nice. Live piano player.
"great music, huge variety of drinks","Fast and friendly service, love the huge selection of whiskey available. The bloody mary is the signature drink though i did not enjoy it much, but all other drinks were great. Drinks are served with snacks, popcorn and nuts, and it comes with a little appetizer, scallop and the eggplant was so tasty.
The jazz pianist and singer, was soothing to the ears, only thing that annoyed me was the people who were speaking too loudly.
but would highly recommend this bar."
Another wonderful cisit,"Always enjoyed the exclusive and serene vibe at Astor Bar.

Today’s singer was amazing and it reminded me how much I missed this place. Looking forward to be back again!

PS: Thanks to Ron and team for their hospitality!"
Great drinks and fun atmosphere,"I love this bar! They make amazing negronis and when we were there, there was a gentleman playing the piano and he was great. In the evening, it is a classy, relaxed place. Highly recommend."
cool cocktail bar but questionable ethics on competition prizes,"Came here for the Time Out Shanghai cocktail evening and had some lovely cocktails and great service in a very cool bar but they did the wrong thing on the prize draw

The prize draw was given to one of the Time Out/Regis employees for the night, the bartender from Tippling Club who had just made a cocktail for everyone....the Regis emcee said ""this probably isn't legit"" and he's right it's not....you're not allowed to give prizes to people connected to you in anyway.. that surely is common sense and a PR own goal

they should have redrawn it

ethically and legally letting him keep the prize was the wrong thing to do

there were several marketing people in the room and they all agreed that St Regis were in the wrong and this does not reflect well on St Regis training"
Honeymoon drinks,We have come to Singapore to celebrate our honeymoon and celebrate we did. Hacket and the staff at the Astor bar were amazing. Having a nice personal chat and sharing a few moment of our families. Would highly recommend going to Astor bar to have a drink or maybe more.
Quick drink,Arrived early on a weekday night. Smallish space. Had to ask for snacks/peanuts after our drinks arrived. Thought it would be offered without prompting
Fantastic Jazz Bar,"I’m not usually blown away, but the pianist started out with an acapella version of “The Shadow of your Smile”. A 10 out of 10 is the only possible rating. Fantastic arrangement.
The bar is pricey, but a lot of fun. As with any St Regis, service is very good, and so are the drinks. Great place to relax and be with friends"
Familiar Faces,"Had the pleasure of returning to the Astor Bar at St Regis. Greeted by a couple of familiar faces, Ron St Clair outstanding on Piano, and friendly and attentive service from Lorna. Always a pleasure to visit this bar in the evening."
Great Vibe and Scotch Collection,If you want a place to chill and enjoy a nice drink then Astor bar is for you. The collection of fine spirits and wine will satisfy anyone. Live music is also a nice touch. The scotch collection is impressive for any bar in Singapore.
A great place to hang out with tremendous selection of whiskeys,"My partner and I had a couple of drinks here while meeting our friend. The bartender Imran and his team are exceptionally friendly and always smiling despite how busy the place was in the evening. This is a great place to hang out, an oasis from the hustle outside. A great way to wind down after a busy day."
Astor Bar is a really nice place!!!,"Good music, good food, good drinks and great people! I personally love their local version of their signature drink - the Chili Padi Mary, a must-try!"
great place to come,"always a great place to come for an a before or after brunch/dinner drink or after work drinks

great to met people and great service"
Process comes before clients,"“Sorry sir we don’t take reservations on Friday”
“We are a party of 8 don’t want to take a risk with walk in”
“Sorry sir, we won’t do it”
“Okay, plenty of other bars in Singapore, I will take my (high paying) business somewhere else”
“Okay sir”

When “process” comes before client experience, or business, you know this is a place you should avoid."
My home away from home in Singapore,"I can’t say enough wonderful things about this bar. The staff is exceptionally courteous, attentive and personable. Everyone eagerly greets me by name and treats me like family. Traveling here from New York is a pleasure because the staff at the Astor bar always make me feel at home. The food and drink is always delicious and served with attention to detail. I love being able to order off of any menu at the Saint Regis Hotel and have the food be hand delivered to me while relaxing and enjoying a cocktail at the bar. This establishment is extremely fortunate to have Hacket, Ron, Chris, Jo, Lorna, Margie and Imran running this bar. Keep up the good work and exquisite service. The piano music and perfectly dim ambiance is a warm welcome from the long flight from the states! Ps-Love the new bar snacks!

Date night,Our favourite to go place for a relax night out. A cozy piano bar with our favourite pianist. Their Wagyu burger is amazing. Staff is very attentive and come around to top up our water and asked if we want another glass. Our to go place for Datenight!
This is a Great Bar to spend some time in drinking some of the worlds finest Scotch.,We stayed at the St Regis for four days. we spent a late night at the Astor Bar and enjoyed it very much. The staff are great the live music (piano/singer) were at the perfect volume so conversations were easy...We loved the Bar Tender.
"nice, decent, St. Regis","One of the nicer parts of the hotel. Drinks are pricy, but the decent atmosphere, the lightening and music makes it an experience."
Very relaxing,We had a cocktail every night and it was relaxing with a piano player and singer playing in the background
Good bar for a few drinks,"Limited bar menu but nice list of cocktails. Elite SPG members get a free drink during happy hour but watch your room bill because we were charged every night for our ""free"" drink."
"Great drinks, fantastic live music, amazing stagg","We went to the Astor Bar for drinks. The drinks are very good, especially the gin and tea infusion. We were especially taken with the live music (fantastic singer!) and the amazing stuff. Lorna was wonderful to us! Thank you - we will be back!"
Great bar - live music - great service,Great bar at St Regis hotel. The live band plays well and the service is great. If you’re staying in the hotel definitely worth to stop for a drink.
