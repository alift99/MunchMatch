Definitely authentic Thai!!,Everything we had was absolutely delicious! My favorite dishes were the pomelo salad and the yellow curry. The service was excellent!
CNY (Chinese New Year）Loi Hei Harmony Festive set dinner.,"Total 8 of us on that night & we really enjoyed the food & the service. Every dish was colourful & nice. The abalone Yusheng,Tom Yum soup, prawns & Pineapple rice were fantastic! My colleagues mentioned will visit the restaurant again."
Great Food and Service,The staff were very flexible with our requests and were very friendly. Would definitely come here again
Good Authentic Thai Cuisine,"Above average quality of dishes but not matching its prices. The tum yam soup is authentic, duck curry is nice and tasty, good stir-fried kai lan, average pandan leave chicken, appetizer pork cracker and deserts mango/durian sticky rices are not up to standards."
Nice people serving ordinary Thai cuisine,"The staff are warm friendly and helpful but the food is pretty ordinary.Tastless spring rolls ,bland fish cakes followed by a passable green chicken curry and and a very disappointing red duck curry..The quality of the meat is an issue and the Thai flavours and spicing were absent.
I am not sure what the opposite of fluffy and separate is but the jasmine rice was a prime example.Lumpy and congealed perhaps.
It was not over expensive but a shame that such excellent staff have to serve up such mediocre fare."
"Good Thai restaurant, but a bit over priced","I would have given the food rating as 3.5/5 and said it was good and not very good. We ordered the assorted appetizer platter, the salads and fish cakes were average. The crab rolls and the coconut sauce were very good. The soups were great, along with the red fish fillet and jumbo prawns. The green beef curry was bland and the mushrooms were quite a disappointment. Very limited options to drink other than canned/bottled beverages and good tea. The ambience was that of a premium diner and not proportionate to the price. I guess the premium is for the Thai certificate. The overall service was very good. I suggest one can visit with lower expectations as compared to the other ratings and you might be pleasantly surprised."
Awesome Service,"Extremely polite and professional service. Food was good too, tom yum soup and green milk tea is a must get! Extremely aesthetic environment too!"
Pleasant Environment Atas Thai Restaurant,"Had a good lunch there. Good, pleasant environment with tasty Steam Sea Bass and Grilled Kurobuta Pork Strips. Overall dishes are excellent."
Great place for upscale Thai Cusine,"Was looking for a place to have authentic Thai food to celebrate family achievement. Did a good search and decided on Sawadee after reading all the reviews.

Fully concur with the reviews! Sawadee is an excellent place for upscale Thai cusine - worthy of the Select Thai award.

The Otah, Red Curry Roast Duck, Roast Pork collar, Seafood Pad Thai and creamy Tom Yum seafood were all outstanding.

Was an extremely memorable meal - and definitely be back again.

Only thing is the parking situation, so next time will park at Bugis Junction, and walk across - much easier."
"Excellent food, excellent service","Visited this restaurant for dinner and was not disappointed. Excellent choices on a varied menu and, once ordered, the food was served quickly and everything cooked fresh. Wine is expensive but that's in line with most restaurants. Very friendly staff and they were happy to organise a taxi for us after our meal. Highly recommend a meal at this restaurant."
Excellent Thai in the middle of Chinatown,"Great little Thai place in the middle of Chinatown Singapore. Staff are really friendly. This is the second time to visit this week and the food has been extremely flavoursome, fresh good quality ingredients and a generous portion size. Highly recommend"
Still the best,We love this Thai restaurant. We think it’s the most authentic in Singapore. Great menu and great service. We will be back many more time.
Fantastic & Awesome,"Fantastic food, awesome service by Ms Bird. We are becoming repeat customers thanks to her! Keep up the great work !!"
"Excellent service, delicious food","A very enjoyable experience, my guest & I loved it. Nice furnishings & excellent service, highly recommended for business lunches."
I do not know why this restaurant is rated so high on TA,"Poor service and food far from impressive. We had high hopes for our celebration at the restaurant, being lovers of Thai cuisine. Well, this was a restarant we will try to forget at fast as possible. Rude staff only made this worse for the five of us, and we all know perfectly well how to behave in a restaurant.
Will not return."
Average,Food a bit overpriced compare to it taste and portion for some. Environment wise is good. Overall not a must go every week or months for cravings
Friday Night Dinner,"Overall, very good. I think the reservation of $100 is to high but maybe its good to ensure only for serious customer :)"
First Visit,"Make a reservation to celebrate my Wedding Anniversary. Food was promptly served and they are very delicious, especially the papaya salad ,Olive fried rice , steam sea bass and Tom yum soup !"
Table take back for next reservation,"Staff never asked us anymore order and asked us to leave, she took back table for next reservation. Staff didn't mention we have only 2hrs when we entered into the restaurant. So sad"
Consistently good,Excellent food and service. My go to Thai restaurant in Singapore. Authentic taste. Not the cheapest but that reflect in the service and food quality.
Wonderful food!,Great food with authentic flavors and great hospitality! I particularly enjoyed the seabass and the crab meat red curry. I'll be back soon!
"Nice Thai Experience, just 10 minutes walk from Marina Bay","Whilst trying to decide where to have dinner last Friday afternoon, we decided to go for a Thai restaurant and Sawadee was well reviewed and had reservations available

The menu was interesting, with plenty of reasonably priced, appealing options. The staff were helpful and attentive and we enjoyed our meal"
Average,"3 flavoured seabass was okay, but can be better. At SGD38++ plus rice you paid almost SGD50 for this kind of food, just not worth it. Unlikely to return here for the fish. A few units away you can get much better and cheaper fish dishes."
Nice spice,"Food ingredients definitely taste better than usual and staff are friendly & helpful, just the price is slightly higher than expected. Will still return anyway for special occasions."
Beautiful Thai Restaurant,"Food, setting and staff all at a high level! Love the prettiness of the restaurant and the friendliness of the staff, and my Thai friend found the food excellent."
Have fun with Thai food,"The ambience was nice and the food tasted good. The value was reasonable. However the small portion was extremely small. Area for improvement, the waitress should be attentive as 1 item did not arrived until a reminder almost at the end of dinner. Restaurant not packed and water was not refilled unless you asked for it. Overall experience was good"
Down to earth Thai,Zero ambiance. The food however is good. Nice presentation. In my opinion Nom Nom Thai on Upper Thomson is better value. If you’re going to have cheap ambiance then your prices and quality of food need to match it.
Good Welcome!,"Pleasant ambience, delish cuisine promptly served by polite staff leaves a warm feel and smile on everyone!"
"Food ok, service so so",Not anything special and didn't feel specially Thai. The device wasnt friendly. When asked to explain the menu it felt like they couldn't be bothered. When repeating the order we misheard and the service lady was actually quite abrupt and rude. Not a friendly atmosphere at all. Plus side is the food comes quick. Service wise I wouldn't be back. For food from the land of smiles there wasn't a Smile in sight. Don't think I'll return
Excellent Thai Restaurant,"The service staff were friendly. Restaurant ambience was simple yet cosy. Price was reasonable. Food was served at a comfortable pace. Most importantly, we enjoyed all dishes ordered; one of the best Thai restaurants we’ve visited. We will be back."
Thai-riffic,"There are very few good Thai restaurants in Singapore. The options are either a shabby Thai cafe in the Golden Mile area or a Hawker centre. So it was good to find Sawadee made you feel like a fine dining experience with professional staff and quality ingredients.
The Manager Andrew was attentive and staff were swift. The mango salad is always a winner. The star dish was the Green duck curry with lychee. A great combination. The interior was simple and elegant with saffron silks draped from the ceiling.

Well Done to Andrew and the Team."
Excellent thai cuisine near Bugis,"We had the vegetarian menu and it was really good in all aspects.
Some of the best if not the best thai fine dining I have tried out side of Thailand truly worth a visit.
I already look forward to going again
A minor drawback is the drinks menu - especially if, as the case was, there are no juices available."
Just a normal dinner,"Recent visit ordered the deep fried pomfret, not fresh enough, ordered same dish on first visit, quality then much better. Second visit ordered fried rice, didn't like the taste, fish cake was ok."
Excellent food and service!,"Ordered some of our favourite Thai dishes - phad thai, tom yum and green curry chicken and even managed to squeeze in some room for dessert. All the dishes were phenomenal! The tom yum soup was exceptionally good and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves tom yum. Service staff were friendly and professional. Overall experience was lovely and it wasn't too pricey either. Would recommend those who enjoy thai food to drop by at least once, maybe for a special occasion."
Good Food and Excellent Service,"Excellent Service rendered, staffs are very friendly. One of the BEST Tom Yum soup in Town! Worth to the price :)"
Great service!,"Very prompt service, love the thoughtful gesture of a complimentary dessert for the birthday boy! Very welcoming experience, will be back!"
Satisfied experience,Quite satisfied dining experience. Environment and service are on par. Shall have a second visit if there is promotion.
Average?,"The place was simple. Service was just okay. Place smelt strongly of durian though. The food was okay and I thought price was reasonable and was open to visit again.

However, we had a delivery subsequently and the food was a total disappointment. The quality was at best an average take away from hawker stalls and not that of a restaurant.

I would avoid delivery again and may or not visit the restaurant again."
Nice environment,Service is fast and attentive. Food is well presented although quite pricey compared to other along the street
SON'S BIRTHDAY DINNER,"Great food, nice ambience, splendid service. Well informed updates and reminders by Chope. One of the best Thai Food."
Too spicy,"Me and my friends are Malaysians, Indonesians, Indians, and we felt so spicy all the time 😢 I liked the atmosphere everything is good except the spicy level. I wish we can pick the spicy level in the future"
My Thai husband approved 👍,"Me and my significant half organised a private dinner event for family and friends. We were offered with special menu list and they made necessary changes to suit our preference.
All of us are pleased with the food and services.
Many thanks to the manager and the crews who helped to make this happened."
Great food and good service,"This is my third time back at Sawadee. The food is consistently delicious. I am a bit sad that there are no more set lunches - I thought the platters were excellent value for money. Was very disappointed that the Mango sticky rice ran out - my guest could only eat soft food, and did not like the other desserts! I think the toilet needs a revamp. What i like about the restaurant is that it is streetside access. For the old folks I brought, they only had a few steps to take to enter - precisely what I needed!"
Excellent,Great food Great service Great value for money This place is a must try and you need to book. A real gem!
Will come again!,Excellent food and service! The pomelo salad was great! Seabass was so fresh and value for money. Staff was friendly and polite
Authentic Thai Food,"All the dishes we ordered are very authentic and came very fast. One suggestion, the amount of salt used can be a tad lesser. Will go again."
Service really good!,My friend was clumsy. Their service really good. They know how to communicate with us. Will recommend to go there!
Very average food,"We had Seafood Fried Rice, Lemongrass Beef, etc.
The seafood was just a lot of rice, not much seafood for SGD18 ++
The Lemongrass beef, had a lot of ""hard piece of lemongrass"" in which you could not chew but had to take out.
Very average food.
The service was good, very friendly staff"
"Good ambience, friendly staff, great food.","Good ambience, friendly staff, great food. Tried the pork collar, steamed fish, olive fried rice, sambal kang kong, pomelo salad and otah dish. All dishes tasted great. I would skip the otah dish as I didnt find it as tasty as the hype it had on other reviews. Maybe its not my thing. The pork collar and steamed fish were excellent. Price was around 150 dollars for 4 people excluding drinks and dessert. Considering the taste and ambience I think its value for money"
Wedding 10/10,"Came back on my friend ROM on 10th October. Warm and pleasant staffs gave a nice touch on hospitality especially where im from this field. Food served were prompt and noting my non spicy palettes, food served are certainly great and with the less spicy over. Kudos to the chefs and setvice team!"
"Went for ROM events, the ambience","Went for ROM events, the ambience and environment was pretty good. For food wise, it was fast and tasty. Kudos to all service staff"
The best 👍👍,"Food is sooo delicious, superb service, Marina is so friendly and outgoing💕💕 will definitely come back again!!!!!"
Excellent food but dessert selection can be be improved,Excellent food especially the pork collar. However dessert selections can be further improved. Can considering adding coconut ice cream with mango cubes as a selection.
"Food is good, everything else is average","Bad wines, average service, no ambiance, no options for drinks.. We were expecting amazing food, but the food is just good."
"The Best Green Curry , I have","The Best Green Curry , I have tasted in Singapore. Pity that discovered the restaurant only 3 days back after having lived in Singapore for 10 years . The food quality was outstanding. The serving staff eyes did the smiling as they were wearing masks . All in All a great experience"
Awesome birthday dinner,It was a good birthday dinner for my brother with perfect ambience. The staff were very nice to help out with the cake setup and also brought a special mango sticky rice special on the house for the celebration! My brother loved it!
Extra yummy Thai food,Exquisite Thai food. Especially love the green mango salad and seafood fried rice. Both dishes have this extra crunch which makes them extra delicious. Will definitely be coming back to try other dishes!
Very good and authentic Thai cuisine,Very good Thai cuisine in a nice place and at an acceptable price - definitely a good choice in Singapore
Tom yam kung tasted weird,"We ordered quite a number of dishes. Tom yam kung tasted very weird and got some smelly taste, informed the restaurant but they never say anything. Informed them 1 more time and they checked, said maybe prawn cooked too long. But I do cooking too, that's not the taste of overcooked prawns. Otak, fish, olive fried rice and fried rice are so-so. Fried chic wings and mango glutinous rice (with ice cream) are nice though. I might not go to this restaurant again, went here as it's near to the temple after CNY praying, will go to my all time favourite which is nearby next time."
small and good,We found the restaurant to be small but good. Food was delicious and so was the service. Not too spîcy. Good variety of foods.
Charming little restaurant,"Sawadee is a small and quaint restaurant on a street much quieter than the street beside it. So much difference compared to over there where there's lots of Chinese food with lots of touting.

I came on a weekday dinner with my husband, and was charmed by the decor. The dishes were beautifully plated, not quite so the normal Thai food that I have seen. The flavours packed a punch! The waitress had asked me how spicy could we take our food, we gamely said just do your normal... boy we were in for a treat. The mango salad exploded in our mouths cos it was really spicy and nice, and we asked for the other dishes to be toned down a notch.

We had the Duck curry, which was excellent. Sweet, salty and with a pinch of spice. Loved it.
The Kurobuta Pork was another star of the night. This pork ranks up there with the best that we ever had.

Overall, the experience was very good, the prices were very reasonable. I would definitely be back."
Completely different experience for me,"After reading the reviews here, I went to Sawadee with high expectations.

I tried this restaurant on two occasions to give it a fair chance. Both times I was disappointed, so I am giving this place a poor review.

The restaurant has all the Thai trappings and kitsch, but beyond appearances, it has little to offer.

The service was apathetic and slow. There were three wait staff for two customers, yet the servers seemed preoccupied with their phones and gossip.

The fried prawn was inedible. The server did not care that I left a large portion of food uneaten on the plate. Is this such a common occurrence that it does not merit the attention of kitchen staff?

The toilet smelled off. How is hygiene in the kitchen if the toilet is not clean?

Both times I had intestinal distress after the meal. I eat Thai food and spicy food regularly and do not have this problem unless there is something wrong with the food.

The location is convenient to public transit (and nearby hospitals with emergency rooms)."
must visit,"We loved the food, very classy for our anniversary dinner ,many varieties, great services! top-notch!"
Unique flavours but not perfect,"Flavours were unique and I felt Thailand outside Thailand. Foods were okay presented, but this could easily be improved further. I guess it might have been a kitchen accident, but 3/4 of us (yes, asian guests included) could not finish the coconut soup because of such an agressive amount of lemon grass that just clearly overwhelmed other ingredients."
Some unique dishes plus some old favourites,"Cozy little place with some standout dishes like the grilled kurobuta pork collar in addition to the usual red curry, som tam, pineapple rice etc. The dishes I would recommend getting are the pork collar, the rice noodles with Thai basil minced meat, the spicy steamed seabass and the pineapple rice.
They also have a separate vegetarian menu which was the reason we picked this as one of our party was a vegetarian, he enjoyed all his dishes as well.
I would recommend going early as their last order for lunch is at 2 pm and they close at 2:30. This was partly my mistake as we booked a table for 1:30 and a few people got late so we had to place the order before everyone arrived.
They did accommodate us by reordering a couple of our favourite dishes a few minutes after 2, but definitely go early to have a more relaxed meal. We also made the mistake of ordering it medium spicy so it was a little too mild for us, so if you like it spicy do tell them."
Classy thaï,"The decoration is very pleasant and the food is really tasty. Not too noisy, perfect for talking with friends or Family. I would recommend this restaurant and I will be back ! Mid-range prices"
Nice dinner,"I enjoyed the red curry duck (very rich and creamy), salad and Otah on clay plate. Thought the pad Thai was a bit salty."
Dinner at Sawadee Thai,"We had a birthday dinner at Sawadee Thai. Food was good without being too spicy for us, and was served quickly despite the restaurant being very full that day. The waitresses were helpful and had helped us to store our cake, and Ling, one of the waitresses, had been very lovely to our group."
In a sea of mediocrity...,"I normally spend a week or so in Singapore every year, and always struggle to find good restaurants. I know they are here, along with a huge number of mediocre and disappointing restaurants, but the good ones are expensive, and take some searching, and the bad ones are everywhere, or large, franchised, western chains. When we are here we like to eat Asian, - I can get a Pizza Express at home, (well I used to until they went tits-up).

Anyway, we found the Sawadee close to our usual hotel and it never disappoints. Great Thai food, good service, and reasonably priced (for Singapore). You can even get a good bottle of wine without a mortgage to pay for it. Everything is good on the menu, last nights mango salad was exceptional.

They always ask if you want it more or less spicy - with a fear of burning the western palette - but go with the spicy option, as it is gentle and fresh flavours throughout.

A nice loyalty discount structure is also now in place."
Great Thai cuisine with fingerlicking Vegetarian options,This is a cozy family fine dining restaurant which serves excellent Thai cuisine. All the ingredients used seem to be original. The food id flavorsome and fresh. Vegetarians are also taken care as they are willing to customise dishes as per requirement.
Heavenly Thai cuisine with great service,"Every dish at Sawadee is authentic and sumptuous and served with charming smiles.
From Som Tom to lemon grass steamed chilli fish to kai lan with garlic to thai fish cake are exquisite. The thai desserts of red ruby with coconut ice cream plus mango with sticky rice gives it delicious finish.
For authentic delicious Thai food served with smiles, Sawadee is the place to go.
Awesome!"
Great food and service,I went with my family for my sister's birthday dinner. The staff were very attentive and the food was delicious. The restaurant even went out of their way to make a special requested dish that wasn't on the menu. My family were visiting from overseas and everyone had an enjoyable dinner experience. We will be back for many more meals. Thank you Sawadee Thai and team.
Thai food with an elegance,"A colleague highly recommended me, so I bought my family here.

The food blew us away in many ways, as this is not your usual run of the mill Thai food. Thai staples like Phad Thai was good, tomyum soup was spicy with a kick, mango sticky rice was superb. Other less seen dishes were equally delicious like the crabmeat curry and the kurobuta pork collar. Oh the pork, that is possibly one of my top 3 dishes of 2019.

Service was good, attentive and elegant."
"Terrible Thai food, overpriced and impossible to park nearby","Avoid at all costs. The restaurant people queuing outside waiting to get in - mostly tourists - and after my meal here I felt very sorry for them as this is not what great food is in Singapore. To begin with, why is their green curry yellow - full of lumps and flavourless? Just how can Thai food be flavourless - it's supposed to be the complete opposite. Further, I like spicy food but their Tom Yam Kung was off the scales and almost impossible to enjoy. The olive rice was so full of pepper that it overpowered the dish. The mango sticky rice was a huge portion but tasteless. And forget about getting a parking spot nearby. Avoid at all costs."
Chris and Magda,"To be honest....THE BEST THAI FOOD IN AYIA NAPA! We went there 3 times for hot spicy Thai red curry, noodles and fried chicken. OMG so good, great and helpful service from two ladies in the kitchen! Hard working and doing everything by themselves! You really have to try it! They bleed out to please you with the food! Well deserved 5 stars. If you look for cheap and tasty food, you have to go there! All the best to you ladies and thank you for the food! Heaven!"
papaya-salad is very scharf (=spicy),"we liked a lot the service. they were so fast and friendly.

once i asked for bread because of the spicy food they explained me that they can offer me rice, because they have no bread in thailand.

when they offered me the rice, after two seconds the rice was brought to my table. so fast. i could not believe it.

durian sticky rice was also good."
"Authentic, very tasty Thai cuisine","My senses were in need of some spicing up. The reviews for this place made for a no brainer. It's a busy place, fairly intimate and we had to reserve a table. Service though was on the money, very friendly and efficient. Food came out one dish after another so it allowed for a fairly relaxed dining experience compared to some places where everything is just thrown on the table at once. Medium portions are great for sharing - the Tom Yum soup is a meal in itself. We also had Red Curry with Crabmeat and the special steamed Sea Bass with traditional sweet and sour sauce. All of it excellent, good heat without being too spicy. Probably a little bit more expensive than other Thai eateries but generally good value for what you get."
Our No 1 Thai restaurant in Singapore,"This little clean and elegant Thai restaurant in
Tan Quee. Lan Street # 9 is very good.
Service very good
Meals all fresh made and delicious:
Crystal Noodle Salad SGD 12
Red Roast Duck Curry SAGD 18. perfect!
Thai coconut soup with chicken SGD 14. —wonderful
Glass of Ochagavia Merlot SGD 10"
Fine Thai Cuisine,A beautifully and tastefully fitted out restaurant which was a feast for the tastebuds. Exceptional fine Thai dining and excellent service. I would hight recommend this restaurant for special Thai food.
Overrated and overpriced Thai food,The quality of food is average and you can find better tasting Thai food at Golden Mile Complex. The saving grace for the evening was their pomelo salad and maoshan wang durian sticky rice. Service is also average.
Fabulous,"Fine Thai cuisine at its best, unique tastes and wow factor all the way, if you want to do a really good and uncommon journey into south east Asia culinary experience just book at Sawadee."
Never had worse service,"This restaurant does not deserve good reviews. Everything is poor - authenticity of food, service particuarly, cleanliness. The one thing above par is the decor, but the ambiance is ruined because of the distorted trash they play through cheap speakers that is capable of inducing headaches.
Like someone else mentioned here, the restrooms are dirty and staff sullen, and frankly look like they would rather work anywhere but here. As a result, you are seldom attended to - they pay you no heed; you have to literally wave your hands around like a traffic coordinator to catch their attention. Ruined our afternoon."
Somewhat unsatisfying meal,"The ambience of the restaurant is alright and the staff are friendly enough. However, the food was found wanting. Most dishes were simply ok and on the bland side. The fish cakes stood out as the best dish despite the size being small for the price. The lemongrass beef was tough and literally hard to swallow."
Service,Food Serve was not hot at all and the service was bad and not organized. Ordered the food and food did not come out at once by the time we finish our food some dishes still not out yet.
Authentic Flavors,I was pleasantly surprised by the flavors on offer at this Thai restaurant in the Bugis area of Singapore. Service was courteous and speedy. I would highly recommend trying the beef green curry (great flavors) and the pad Thai (delicious). Check this place out if you happen to be in the neighborhood.
The best curry ever,The food was simply amazing. So tasty!!! I absolutely suggest the crab curry and the Pad Thai. I’d definitely return a second time.
A delight!,"Efficient and friendly service. Every mouthful delicious. Some of the best Thai food I’ve had anywhere. Recommend fish cakes, red curry crab & duck, papaya salad, mango sticky rice to finish... awesome!"
Good Thai Food,"This is my favorite Thai Restaurant in Singapore. They have a good mix of spicy and non-spicy food. All of the Thai favourites like Green Curry, Red Curry, Tom Yum Kung, Stuffed Chicken Wings, Otah are cooked well. They also have the best Red Ruby Dessert in Singapore!"
Service is not so good but dishes are tasty,"The staff needs to be more attentive and enthusiastic. Apart from this complaint, I must say that this restaurant serves yummy Thai dishes. I strongly recommend the stuffed chicken wings (so good we had 2 orders), steamed fish, steak and olive rice."
Not so delicious...,Service was great but food not so much. The dishes didn't delight the palette as I expected after reading the reviews. I would steer away from the Thai red curry with crab as it punches a hole in the wallet(S$26) but veers away from being authentic.
Nice Thai fusion,"We’ve visited Sawadee Thai on 2 occasions recently and had a nice time on both occasions. I would describe the food as Thai fusion as it may not be as authentic as I expected, but it was tasty nonetheless.

The mango salad was nice and had a good kick, but was quite a small portion for the price. The duck curry and the minced pork with basil were good portions however. The pineapple rice, whilst very yellow, seemed to have little pineapple in it which was a shame.

On another occasion we had the mixed starter which was good to share with a group.

Overall it was a nice place to visit. It can be chilly however as they had the aircon blasting on the 2 times we visited, so perhaps keep that in mind!"
Third visit as good as the first two!,"We brought friends who were traveling through Singapore to dinner here and, once again, we were not disappointed. The food is amazing! Flavours are so yummy! Lovely staff and a great atmosphere. Won't hesitate to go back again soon."
Everything is wrong,"I just can't understand how this restaurant can get so many good reviews. There must be a trick, because everything is wrong there.

You are greated by some terrible music coming out too loud of a substandard soundsystem. Then you visit the restrooms to find them particularly dirty, to the point that you have to mention it to the waitress, who hasn't smile once since you've met her. Then comes the food: tasteless, drowned in sugary gravy, with the feeling that everything that should be fresh (seefood, green leaves) has spent far too many days in a fridge and leaving you with an after-taste of MSG. And basically, it just does not taste thai.

For authentic Thai food we will just go next time to the hawker-style restaurants of Golden Mile. Unpretentious, cheap and authentic."
Authentic Thai Cuisine with homely taste.,Food taste like homely local Thai food. Presentable in somewhat traditional cutlery. Nice and neatly done.
Mild taste Thai Food,"Good Environment, nice service; 80% of the table was reserved;
Mango Salad: so so, but I like the small dried shrimps on top of it;
Tom yam soup: average level;
Olive Fried Rice: Okay;
Red curry duck: with coconut milk flavor, good company with plain rice;
Otah: Like it, mild with coconut milk flavor;
Mango with sticky rice: not my type;Sorry
Durian with sticky rice: yummy and satisfied!"
Not what was promised,"They pride themselves on being “vegetarian friendly”, but when ordering vegetarian food all they did what to remove the meat - so a fried olive rice was literally a pile of rice. No vegetables or tofu or anything to replace the meat. After some heavy discussion they finally gave us 5 tiny pieces of tofu to go along the dish...
Moreover, the portions were tiny. I will definitely not come back."
"Noisy, spicy and not too attentive service...","..., but apart from this, food quality is quite high ! So in case you are fan of Thai cousine, this the place you will like it. Tom Yum soup,is excellent ! Also try Red curry roast duck and Three Flavoured Prawns and Lemongrass beef"
Best Steak Ever,"We ate here for dinner on a Saturday night and got lucky not having a reservation. Service wasn’t great as our drinks were not served until 5 minutes after mains, and the appraisers arrive after we had finished our mains. The green curry was ok but had absolutely no spice at all. The starters (crab spring rolls and pan dan) we good. The steak on the other hand was fabulous 10/10! It was cooked perfectly and the coconut green curry sauce was a great pairing. You must try this! Overall nice dinner but service could be improved."
Good Thai Food (must try),"Went to try Sawadee as I heard a couple of friends mentioning their authenticity. The place offers a variety of different dishes and most of the common Thai dishes can be found. The selection of Thai Seafood dishes is amazing and everyone liked the steamed sea bass. Other great dishes were the grilled kurobuta pork collar and the thai red curry with roast duck, lychees and pineapples. Probably one of the best Thai restaurants and not too expensive."
Lunch with family,"Great Thai food, decent service, colourful ambience and ample parking space available (if you are traveling by your car. )

Just the cutlery looked a little sad. The plates were full of scratch marks. So yeah that is something they need to look into.

Overall a nice place to visit with friends and family."
