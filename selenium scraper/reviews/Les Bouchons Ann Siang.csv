Best service ever!,"Was served by Monsieur Mark on 27 Jan, service was perfect and immaculate! Would definitely recommend!"
Best steak,"Service is always immaculate, non intrusive and elegant. The food is always good and on point and consistent. One of the best place for steak in singapore"
Christmas menu had really nice cocktails,"Service and ambience were excellent. Christmas menu had nice cocktails. Food that would be recommended are - onion soup, wagyu & molten lava cake. Service by Ee Chin was also attentive and excellent!"
Would Recommend!!,The service was very good and the food was excellent! Perfectly grilled salmon and tender prime rib. Also got a really delicious Lava cake for my father‚Äôs birthday. Yum :)
Don‚Äôt waste your time,"Went there with friends, small place with no customers which is fine but then when ordering manager still can give remarks about ordering too little. Does it matter if I eat 1 set share or order 10 sets for 1. Still dare say so loud and even service staff at the back can gossip infront of their customers."
Average,"Overrated, fries was greasy and over salted. Salad is below average.
Steak was ok, not the best, condiments that came with it is terrible.

Overall, taste is average and not worth the price, better to go for dry-aged, grass fed or waygu steak.
Place is small, tables are very near one another, its hard to have privacy and enjoy your meal."
The Best Couscous Experience in Singapore,"Glad the place is still around as the area changed so much after Covid. The place is on the Weekend Friday/Saturday a place to treat yourself with a nice Couscous, generous dish to share among friends"
Meh,"I think I would have given it a higher rating if the menu was clearer and if there was more guidance given as to the sort of meat each item was. I was hoping for more hanger steak type of cut but I got a really fatty ribeye. The bread was the best part of the meal for me, fries were surprisingly feast even though they didn‚Äôt look the part, salad was fine given it‚Äôs ‚Äòpart of the meal‚Äô. We had two steaks and one glass of wine and it was 160$. Wouldn‚Äôt come back unless we ran out of other options."
Great Steaks,"Cannot rave enough about this place, best valued streak restaurant in Singapore. These guys knock it out the park, the food is fantastic and based on the very basic French style steak and chip restaurants you would see in France. I have been here 9 times now and never had a complaint. Try the sauces with the steaks personally i like the black pepper one but all are good.

The restaurant itself is in a great location in a busy area of Singapore but still remains quite and charming.

If you have the pleasure of having Zet look after you your experience will be doubled as he really goes out his way to make you feel special under the management of Rubin."
Great french restaurant,"Foods are great, good ambience, great services! Very recommended!! Thank you very much, we had a good time!!!"
Best French Restaurant,"First of all, all the staff were very kind and welcoming as you walk in. Though we didn‚Äôt reserve a table on a busy day Patrick was kind enough to give us a table. Outstanding service and he even gave us the entire 2nd floor to enjoy! You have got to try the onion soup! It will bring a warm smile..house fries are very crunchy and hot and the cream spinach just added extra flavour to the scrumptious meat. Thank you so much!
Hidden gem in Ann Siang road!!"

Good food and good portions!,Couscous was nice with decent portions of meat. Tenderloin was also nicely done. Overall satisfied with our lunch. Not the first time here and won‚Äôt be the last!
Nice ambience with good food,This is our second visit here! Serves delicious French onion soup and good steak. Nice ambience too.
Nice food and ambience,Love the bread and all the dishes we ordered! Ambience and music is nice and really make my day. Thank you
Excellent food! Kudos,"Been hearing so much on their steaks and Finally! I am Here. Steak was excellent, poulet was interesting, taste was nothing I had before.. will order again for my next visit‚Ä¶ Service was excellent, staffs were professional, friendly."
Great experience at Les Bouchons,"Impeccable service, cosy atmosphere and decent food! French onion soup was great! Escargot needs a little more taste and some pieces were fishy. The steak was great on its own but the herb butter gave it a strange aftertaste. Maybe Bordier butter can give it a better taste."
Dinner for 5,Came for dinner with 4 other friends. Wait was a little long but well worth the it. Steak was excellent and good value. Service was excellent. Zet was very helpful and friendly. Wines were also excellent.
Awesome service!,The service was top notch! We were well-taken care of by Mark and Elyssa all night and well-fed. Worth a trip!
Surprise birthday celebrate,"Good atmosphere, great food, very accomodative, friendly waiters and waitresses, we were late, but the waiter was helpful in extending our dining time and helping us with the surprise cake!"
Great spot on club street,"Nice French Restaurant on club street. Great food and wine, staff is very friendly. Indoor seating is air conditioned and nice setting for any business dinner"
New location at Rochester,Great service and amazing food at Rochester. Had steak tartare and Entrecote beef. Melt in your mouth. Dog friendly is also a plus.
Dinner at Les Bouchons Ann Siang,"Firstly, the service of the staff was excellent, special mention to Zet and Alyssa, who provided immaculate service. The food was great. Had the french onion soup for the first time, it was amazing."

Exellent value lunch,Good quality steak frites! Super friendly straff ( Gaya and Mark) will take care of all your needs..
Honest review!,"Great food, great service! Definitely 5/5! The embience is great with friendly staff. The food comes in generous portion n prefectly cooked!"
Monday Lunch,"Had a weekday lunch at Ann Siang outlet. Was greeted by Zet Liong with high energy and he recommended the menu to us patiently. We love the French onion soup, the ribeye and foie gras. The chocolate moouse is a must to end off the awesome meal. Love the service and dining experience here! Highly recommended to visit this place!"
Never again,"Was recommended the prime rib that was to be a signature dish and tender. Ordered medium rare. The dish that came was very tough, undercooked (50% raw in middle), sinewy, had no crust and had bit of what felt like 'tendons'. It was a terrible cut of meat!! Potato was over fried, salad tasteless but he bone marrow was good. The meal was not worth the $350 paid and I can do much better steak myself at home. Sorry, it will be my 1 and only time patronising."
Fantastic Service & Amazing Food,"My colleague and I visited on 15 Nov, and had an extremely pleasant experience. The service was impeccable - attentive and always smiling. The food recommendations were honest and solid - I loved the fries and creme brulee. We enjoyed ourselves so much that we lost track of time - the service team didn't even let us know that they were closed at 10pm and we unwittingly stayed until 10:45pm. Even then, it was all smiles from the staff. Thank you so much!"
Well above average!,"Excellent service, excellent food. The three-course meal was very enjoyable; french onion soup was hearty and authentic, and steaks were cooked perfectly (we had one ribeye and one sirloin). Dessert (one creme brulee and one creme caramel) was HUGE, but had to be finished up because it was so good."
Amazing birthday dinner,"Have not been back at Les Bouchons in months and the food is still amazing! We ordered our usual, the bone marrow, the C√¥te de B≈ìuf, cream spinach, and to top it off, the cr√®me br√ªl√©e.

The beef exceeded our expectations as always, having an beautifully flavored crust and tender medium rare center. The bone marrow and cream spinach were a delight, always great to pair with the steak. Dessert was a hit as well with the light cream and perfect brulee.

I would recommend coming for dinner dates as the ambiance is always great."
Food half prepared. Disappointed.,Ordered a steak hache with mesclun salad & cherry tomatoes instead of fries. Received two sad piece of leaves as side. How pathetic is this? Who is going the qc in your kitchen? Shame on you.
Great dinner spot,"Excellent steaks and the fries are free flow too. Nice ambience if you‚Äôre seated outside, perfect for a simple but nice dinner out. Great service by Mark and Helen as well."
Great meat and Fries,"This is our go to place for a great steak and free flow fries. Service is good, especially with Mark Andrew."
Wine & steak after work,Great evening with great waitress - would highly recommend. Alyssa was a star of the evening. Absolutely mega if you‚Äôre looking for a decent cost steak and wine evening - with a good location to boot
Nice food,"Food is fantastic, came back for second time and taste is consistent with first visit. Will be back again, love their impossible meat."

Love the ambience and space as if you travel to French cafe. But wish they would play French songs

Dishes are yummy, enjoy the steak cotedeuf , French fries, wine and desserts

The service of the crew is absolutely excellent ! They are friendly and always pro active in serving you.

Will definitely visit again."

Fantastic Classic L'Entrec√¥te,"Great ambience with classic French fare. Had steak frites, and creamed spinach - steak was perfectly done as medium rare with a hint of char."
Been to the Robertson Quay,"Been to the Robertson Quay outlet several times but now we are visiting the Ann Siang area one as the other outlet is closed on Mondays. Love the steak, so fatty and delicious, definitely the best we have tasted in Sg at this price point. Nice ambience and service too!"

Quaint little steakhouse,"Lovely ambience, great steaks as always. Meticulous service too! Thank you for the great meal! üëåüëåüëåüëå"
Great food but alright service,"Went on a Saturday night. The Ann Siang hill outlet is quite small with the first storey‚Äôs indoor seating only able to fit about 20 pax comfortably.

Food: hands down super crispy fries that were served warm upon order! My partner and I both enjoyed our ribeye a lot. Definitely worth coming back!
However, the complimentary bread came super cold and stale. I can barely tear the bread apart with my hands, let alone biting them. So bad... I think they are better off not serving those than ruining my appetite with the cold bread. I mean...I don‚Äôt think it harms to just toast it for awhile?

Service: alright... One of the waiters was explaining the sauces to us in a x3 speed and left hurriedly. Honestly none of us catch a single thing. If he is in such a hurry, I‚Äôd rather he just leave the sauces there and don‚Äôt explain anything?
Halfway through the dinner, we approached another male waiter for an additional serving of fries. 15-20mins later, still no news. We had to ask the restaurant manager (I believe) to chase on our order, only to realise that the earlier waiter did not place the order for us. Wow thank you.
I honestly don‚Äôt think it was a busy night for the size of the restaurant & with number of waiters available that night, but the service was just 5/10.
Probably might give the Robertson Quay‚Äôs outlet a try, their service might be better (I hope?)"
Excellent food and service,Food was excellent!! Mark and bernard took good care of us! Im Already thinking of when ill return again!
AMAZING FOOD AND EVEN BETTER SERVICE!,Food was absolutely great. Steak was to die for and gosh you need to keep the fries away!!! Too good!!! Thank you to Mark and Bernard. You made our friends‚Äô birthday very very special. P.S. the Cote de Boeuf feeds 3! Cheers!!
Never going back,"We ordered the steaks Ribeye and Sirloin. They were not expensive, but I understood why they provide 4 different condiments. You are going to need them. Low quality steak and one of them came grilled inconsistently in terms of doneness. Fries were over fried and oily."
Really great,So good we actually went to the sister restaurant the next night in Robertson quay. Tomahawk steak to share was great.
amazing couscous and service,"We came along with three friends for the Friday Couscous.... and had a wonderful dinner. Food was great, service extremely welcoming and friendly. Will definitely be coming back again, strongly recommended!!!"
Christmas Eve lunch,Our family had Christmas Eve lunch at Le Bouchons this covid 19 year. My daughter like the extra tender fillet mingnon. It was really tender. The dessert pistachio and hazelnut ice cream was great. When we were about to leave the credit card machine broke down and we had to scramble our cash on hand to foot the bill. The billing glitch shouldn‚Äôt happen on a day like Christmas Eve. Other than that all was good.
Birthday celebration,Good food! Steak platter is just amazing. The service is fantastic! Suitable for celebrations events
Zet‚Äôs and Alissa‚Äôs service,"Zet‚Äôs and Alissa‚Äôs service was amazing. Great recommendations, great customer relationship. Food was incredible, generously huge portions."

One of the best steak I've ever eaten!,"The title said it all. It comes with generous amount of deliciously fried french fries and a bowl of salad. I struggled a bit to finish the whole thing, but I enjoyed every bite of it.

Great experience at Les Bouchons!,First time dining at Les Bouchons and I‚Äôm amazed at the great quality food and romantic atmosphere. Impeccable service as well. Would definitely recommend to my friends and family! 5/5 stars!
Cosy steak frites for two,"Over the long weekend in a hot, humid night in Singapore, we fell into this cosy restaurant on the middle of Ann Siang Hill.

Boasting a small, well thought out menu, we enjoyed champagne, steak frites (Angus rib eye) with free flow fries and a salad (leaves, fennel, walnut, tomato, vinaigrette). Topped off with a red wine and caramel flan, I am going to roll on home.

The best part was the service by manager Karan and server Mark. Followed closely by the blink-and-you‚Äôll-miss-it chilli crab bisque with truffle cream (only a special during Singapore‚Äôs national day weekend).

Thanks for a memorable evening. Cheers."
Wonderful,Great steak and lovely ambiance. Visited in August 2020 for a birthday and would strongly recommend.
Lunch with a view,Fantastic food served in this restaurant. One of the best steaks in Singapore. Fries were fried from cut potatoes. Real comfort food.
Classy and delicious,"Service was prompt and on point. Ambience is the right mix of classy and comfy without being pretentious (difficult to find in Singapore). Most importantly, the food was great. We ordered the Angus steak and the Impossible burger. Highly recommend. Reserve a seat beforehand."
Best black angus beef!,Ordered the medium rare and its was awesome. thou i felt that the salad was a tad oily but all was good. beef lovers come visit les bouches
Nice meal,The rib eye is ok - not fantastic but not bad. However the fries and the breads are so delicious. Can finish huge portion of them.
Lovely evening,"Thank you to the warm welcome, Team Les Bouchons, we enjoyed your recommendation, the Prime Rib. We‚Äôll be back again!"
Great ambience and service,The food is always great and so is the service. Always satisfied and very full after every visit! Lovely ambience as well.

Niceee,Awesome service and food!! Try their beef steak. Lovely ambience. Nice escargots. Friendly and courteous staff.
Dinner at Les Bonchous,Good food and nice portion! Chips are crispy too :) Nice and chill out ambience. Servers are friendly and attentive. Practice safety distancing measures.
