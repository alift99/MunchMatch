Good food,Food and service were good. Parking is really difficult to get on a weekend. The Chappati set I had showed chickpea curry on the photo in the menu but no chickpeas in the curry I got. The badham (almond) milk is overloaded with spices.
Best Vegetarian Food Ever!,"One of the oldest vegetarian restaurants in Singapore. Clean, Hygienic and tasty South Indian cuisine."
Nice Restaurant,"This is the best South Indian restaurant in Little India, Singapore. There were varieties of dishes available at economic rates."
A decent place to try affordable south indian food,"I stayed in Singapore for almost 4 months and during my stay at Singapore, this place became a regular for me to have some light and healthy dinner around my stay. They serve regular south indian food which include idli, dosa, medu vada and pratas, however I would definitely recommend idli and dosa at this place. These options are less oily (since they are not fried) and provides you with good amount of protein in your diet."
for lunch,"so rushy place, in the lunchtime there is no space and not at all good customer service too. food is an average not any specialties"
Cheap food,"One of the best south Indian restaurant in Singapore. I loved their food, especially dosas. Very quick service."
Banging Biriyani,"Popped in here to get a take away to take back to our hotel. Went for the Vegetable Biriyani set meal. On unpacking the take away I didn’t realise there’d be so many different little pots and containers. Not too sure what they all were but the entire meal was absolutely amazing, lovely flavours and spicy too ! Delicious."
A average place to visit,Had veg dinner at this restra. The food served was just ok. It resembled more to a dining hall. The service was also average so was the cleanliness and the ambience. Can be skipped by tourist
One of the worst,"The briyani rice extremely salty and curry is spicy, the rice is sticky, cold and not fresh. The first and last for me, bad customer service too, the cashier doesn’t even care to serve people."
Except burger nothing is good.,"I have visited this place many times only because i am pure vegetarian so sometimes i am out of choice .
Komala quality is reducing day by day, their food taste is never the same. Many times they add too much spices.
The staff is occasionally rude and stupid, The keep water cup near them so people dont use them much. Similarly for having Sambhar with Dosa for refill you have to reach out to them to get cup for it and then self fill it.
Their washroom is also not maintained as in other part of Singapore."
Indian vegetarian fast food.,Indian vegetarian fast food. Basic and clean setting. Food not as good as I remember. Even the basic crackers comes soft. Service are good.
value for money no fuss hotel,"a value for money restuarent opposite to ferrer park MRT. All kinds of south India' veg dishes available at nominal costs(by singapore standards).
The place is crampy and acceptance of all cards is a question mark. Rest you can trust that your taste appepite for south Indian and other veg dishes is fulfilled."
Average food but clean and convenient,"Food was ok. Bit overpriced. The attitude at the billing counters is rather Curt but the serving staff are very nice

Taste wise it was so so. But at a great location and the place is clean. Mostly south indian food only

One should consider visiting this place for sure though"
Best Veg Restaurant in Singapore,"We tried few vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. Komala's is best of all. It's South Indian Meal, Dosa Meal and Poori Meal are very good. They can improve upon North India food options. Overall food was delicious and value for money.

I highly recommend Komala's as good vegetarian option in Singapore"
Excellent Veg Food,"We are South indian Vegetarian and when we found this hotel, we thought god saved us. A Small little hotel where u can get top quality South indian foods like iddly, dosa, pongal, vada etc. Excellent Quality. But costly too!!!"
Komalas Restaurant Singapore,"One of the finest south indian veg restaurant in Singapore. Well known brand and got too many branches. They also serve north indian vegetarian dishes, chaats and indian chinese. Their dosas are super good."
Good Veg Thali,"I was there with my father and we missed the hotel breakfast, we were looking to try some Indian breakfast. We randomly try here and they are pure veg restaurant. we got two options on thali so we tried and food was really good.

Food price is good and the taste is also good beside that I must say the amount of food is enough for a person."
Amazing Indian Cuisine,"Located in little India, Singapore. The place is having good ambience. Known for offering Indian food mainly south Indian cuisines. The Food quality and taste both were good. Must visit place for Indians and Indian food lovers. Price are nominal."
Paradise for Indian vegetarian,We were having tough time in Singapore being Indian vegetarians. This restaurant saved our lives. The masala tea was aptly prepared and took away all our tiredness. This restaurant is strongly recommended for its hygiene and cost effectiveness.
Indian McDonalds style,"No frills, fast food. Feels a lot like McDonalds only that it’s absolutely delish Indian food not garbage. You order at a cashier, there is combo meals available (we purchased a south & a North Indian combo) and pick up food from another area and on plastic trays. It’s normally not the way we like to eat but, for the price, ease and taste I’m not complaining. Worth trying!"
Good Vegetarian option,"This is a good south Indian restaurant at the corner of the Serangoon road and usually packed with people.

Various combo options are available and interesting, the dosas seem to be very popular and so are the noodles.

We tried the dosa, thali and noodles and the food was quite good - nothing great, but not bad either. This is a very good option for south Indian food in Little India"
Best south Indian cuisine,"Komalas has been always known for its nice, authentic south Indian food in Singapore.
This time also we went here for lunch.
It was a bit crowded and it took us some time to find a table.
We ordered masala dosa, idlis and vada.
The taste was not that good as we had found it during our last visit.
The coffee was good."
Not clean,We went there and it was not clean. The food was okay but sanitation wise wasn't good. People were spitting in one common sink and it had stains everywhere. Plus we had to ask for napkins twice and someone just pulled the napkins from the paper towel dispenser and handed them to us. I won't go again just because it wasn't clean.
Great food and prompt service,A veggie paradise in Singapore. Great tasting food and very prompt service. Worth every dollar spend. Keep up the great job !!
"Komalas lau pa sat worsed, no refund","Komalas don' accept or give cash. All with nets. I ordered masala tea, the guy on counter somehow heard 3 masala tea n deducted 2 * 3 i e 6 sgd. Wheni told him tht why he charged 6 sgd, he says it is for 3 n got surprised. Aftef tht no refund possible bc they use only Nets. 1 tea cost me 6$, can u imagine. Worst experience n this is not first time. Just avoid going to komalas"
Super cheap breakfast,"This is basically fast food - order at the cashier and collect at the servery. Various set options for breakfast. I had the ""set"" of a rolled pancake filled with potato, peas and I think okra, together with a spicy doughnut, served with a small pot of spicy vegetable curry, a plastic tray of three sorts of dips, and a cup of tea. The food was delicious and you can't argue with the price - S$6.50, equivalent to about £3.60 UK. Can hardly get a good cup of coffee for that at home!"
Good value for money,"Heard people say that the Indian PM Narendra Modi dined here. Heard someone say it has a history being established in 1947. Well, an eatery that has lasted for 70+ years must have something going for it. Sure did.
The place is small but their hearts are big. A co-guest felt that his Dosa was not crisp enough. It did not take them a minute to think. The plate was whisked off and replaced with another just to his liking.
The food was good, the variety was enough.
If you like Indian food, this should be high on the list of places,"
Komala,Best restaurant for veg at Little India. Combo meals option is too good and also affordable. Rcommended.
Self service,This south Indian food restaurant was across the road from City Square Mall. So we decided to have our dinner after watching a movie in Mall Cinema. We had to queue up to buy tokens and again queue up to take food. It is self service restaurant. Food was tasty and freshly prepared. Reasonable price. A favorite place for locals and tourists.
No Frills Homely Food,We had our Lunch here on 10th Jan 2019 and enjoyed their south Indian Thali (Meal Plate) with Rice and Chapati. It was enough for two of us and quite sumptuous too. A very simple basic Restaurant. It was clean and also had a Washroom both for Ladies and Gents. Strongly recommended for Budget Travelers. Our friends enjoyed Dosas and Idlis here and they were quite happy too.
Pretty decent Indian food,"Very good location - just opposite farrer park MRT and near city square mall. The food is not that authentic, but is still good and worth the money. You need to order and pay at the cashier, take the receipt and pass it to the counter nearby. There are water dispensers with plastic cups and you can get drinking water yourself. Tried dosa, idly, chappati, mango juice, coffee, rice and a variety of other items - definitely worth the money."
South Indian style food presented in afast food style,"This is a place if you want to have a quick south Indian meal.We visited Komalas at the corner of Serangoon Rd and Kitchner road at about 3PM for a quick bite while doing a little shopping at the City Square Mall and Mustafer.,We had the Masala Dosa and Vada which seems to be popular.The service was quick,relatively cheap and we were out of the Restaurant in 40 minutes.This is not a place one will visit to have a relaxing meal in an inviting environment.I noted the menu was vegetarian,extensive and well priced.Will recommend if you want a quick meai without any frills"
Really yummy and filling food:),I was walking towards City Square Mall and I came across this restaurant and decided to eat there. The food I ordered made me feel so full after eating finish.
Great place to eat vegetarian.,Very good quality and authentic Indian vegetarian food. Must try their masala dosas and chole bhature to name a few.
Good Food!,"We had a set meal and a biryani meal with poori. The food was hot and good, and served quickly. We enjoyed the meal."
Best vegetarian,Very affordable tasty vegetarian restaurants. Breakfast combos are yummy. Best dosas in singapore with appropriate chutneys.
Great vegeterian food,Great Indian food. Excellent prices. Placexa little crouded but its worth it. For vegeterians this is a perfect choice of restauranr
"worst service possible, avoid at all costs","It was worst experience dining there. No visa and mastercards accepted!! Billing girl has a lot of attitude with lack of incentive to work. No water on table also, will be givento plastic disposable cups to fetch water yourself.Crowded place due to location. Food is good but not 100% authentic.Ordered south indian full meals but shocked to see to more service of rice in full meals! gave cucumber raita as a item"
Decent South Indian Food,good south Indian food. value for money. can be a little more authentic. good for family eating out.
Non freindly and not accepting credit cards,"Visited for South indian food lots of option but very unfriendy staff
Aupringky they don't accept credit card only cash and nets payment
Amazing for Singapore !!!
We wanted crispy dosa and ordered paper masala even told they guy who took our slip but I think he was busy in other things or reastaurants has decided they serve only standard fare
Though lot of customers might also be because of startegic location"
Well priced and adequate quantity coupled with excellent service,"We dined there 3 times for lunch in the month of August, experience was good and satisfying on every occasion, dishes were properly prepared with great taste,service was excellent, we recommend this place and will love to go there again and again."
Excellent South Indian food.,This is a self service restaurant and for South Indians this is best in Little India Singapore. Its pocket friendly but there will be heavy rush during the peak dining period.
Awesome Vegetarian Resturant,Very good Indian vegetarian restaurant located at Serangoon. Nice and clean place. Order processing takes bit time but the wait is worthy. I really enjoyed the Cheese parota. Super tasty stuff. Prices are reasonable.
Mr Hemant Patel,Very nice restaurant Quick service Good value for money You have to order at the counter and pick up your order at the service counter Food was very nice and tasty Would definitely recommend
Good vegetarian Restaurant,Good and tasty vegetarian south Indian food. All the items are very well prepared and Reasonably priced.
Good Veg Food and value for money,They offer good vegetarian food. Cheese parata and cheese naan were best of its class. Staff is not that friendly although.
good Indian food,You get good indian food out here. the best part is this restaurant is open till lil late night. so this is a good option for dinner latenight. Plus the rates are also reasonable out here.
Veg.India Meal,If staying around the Farrer Park area this is a good restaurant for Vegetarians and India South Indian Meals. Good Food.
Average taste and poor staff service !!,"Visited the restaurant on 08th June 2018, 9:00 pm. The place is really very badly managed.
Unclean , staff at counter is rude, arrogant and similar behave from person serving the dishes at the dine in counter.

Seems from their behavior that the staff may be either under paid or lacks motivation to serve the customers in a friendly manner.

This may also be the case as they know in the area mostly people are tourist and not many return customers !!

Also finding a place for yourself is also a challenge on busy evenings and customers have to jostle up to hold a seat but may be self service restaurants this can be over looked.

Over all below par service and not so good food that can make it up for rude service.

Hence won’t advice !!"
Best for veg food,It good restaurant with good food South Indian food and with affordable price good for vegetarian people
Crowded.. Crowded,You can find Indian food at this place but it’s really crowded. Order South Indian Thali and Rava Dosa Combo (C5). Taste: average Service: average
Crowded and Average taste,"The restaurant is always crowded and difficult to get a seat. However the food tastes just average. You have better choices in little india (anand bhavan, sarvanna, etc)"
Hotel is Pure Veg restaurant in Singapore,Hotel is pure veg restaurant in singapore. We were happy to find this Pure Veg restaurant. Management needs to improve on customer management. Too much crowded and they keep selling coupons without any sitting table/chairs
Komala's Resturant - Singapore,"Komala’s South Indian restaurant is located near Park Royal Hotel on Syed Alwi Road, next the famous Mustafa Centre, Singapore. This is supposed to be a famous South Indian Chain of Resturant's in Singapore and has quite a few others all over Singapore.

When we visited this Resturant some group tour people were are there so the place was a bit crowded.

Presentation of food is very good but taste is not as good as any other good South Indian restaurant....

We ordered very basic items
Idli Samar
Medu Vada & Sambar
Dosa Sambar

Good option for veg or South Indian food are available near the famous Mustafa market !"
Eating paradise,"From the time we landed in Singapore, till the time we left - this one place was the most visited place for us.
Pure Veg foot with mid range pricing and good food to offer. We tried a lot of dishes there and all were upto the mark.

Must eat place - especially if you love pure veg stuffs."
Crowdy budget veg restaurant,"Average restuarant...better to say food court...as it is not at the level of a restaurant...no such service

Pro:
1. Excellent location, next to Ferrar Park MRT
2. Price is low, so good for budget meals

Con:
1. Too much crowded
2. Credit card or paywave payment is NOT accepted
3. Average food quality
4. No restaurant service, one has to collect the food from service point after payment
5. Not many choices except some set meals, dosai, pasta type foods..
6. Cleanness is average
7. Not suitable for private meals or peaceful dinner/lunch for a group or to celebrate some occasion"
Taste is good,"Food is great and staff is very friendly.
We had Plain Dosa / South Indian Thali , etc..
Compared to other Restaurants Komala provides good quantity, Only issue sometimes would be that it is crowded. Price vs Quality is balanced.
This restaurant was very close to our hotel where we stayed.
I enjoyed the food.
My suggestion would be to have Starters, So that some of them can prefer. As most of them are with combos"
Veg!,They serve 100% vegetarian food. Taste is so-so and so is cleanliness. Not too expensive. Everything in plastic!
"Good one, can improve on cleanliness","Been to here 2 times one time dinein and another time for takeaway. Taste is good, but quality is ok. Can improve on restaurant cleanliness. Overall ok for a quick visit for a traveler as it is next to ferrarpark MRT"
Good for meals,"Okay. Just a stones throw away is Komala Vilas and these guys are different and known as Komalas. The fare that they serve is similar except that here you get a much bigger thali that is very filling . There was a North Indian Thali too but its better skipped in favor of the South Indian thali because almost all the other food that is served here is more or less South Indain in origin.

So my thali had a maida roti (skip that for poori if possible) , two different vegetables, one sambar, a rasam , a lovely vetha kozhambu type liquid, a kaalan and of course curd.

They give extras at no charge and the thali is quite filling .

recommended."
Food not so good,we tried this place for dinner. Not so good. You can try other Indian places. Both the quality and the arrangements are not upto the mark. Only good thing is that the hotel is strategically located
Lunch,We had the south Indian thali with poori. The thali was just sufficient for a normal person. Quality of food was good. Good ambience and quick self service. It is a eat and get out type of place. Good value for money
Ok Lah,"Had a take out from Komala’s today. Veggie biryani with coriander rice. It comes with poppet and beets. Despite its spiciness level, the combo meal is enjoyable. But not a daily fare for me."
Authentic Delights,"For vegetarian Indians craving indian delicacies, this is the perfect place to dine at.

It's a self service restaurant. The interior is pretty big and can accommodate quite a lot of people. The place is hygienic. The cashiers should work on their attitude though.

The food is simply delicious. The spices are really well expressed. The presentation is good. The coffee is a must-try.

All in all, I highly recommend it to all my fellow travellers."
"""Variety of Meals thy name is Komalas""","Good south Indian Hotel with many variety of Combo meals. All types of dosas,meals or mini meas or dosa with meal & one optional drink are served here till 1030/11PM.Very much economical and budget restaurant.

Self service and always crowded hotel.

Staff are courteous and friendly.

Reasonably Clean and hygiene."
Fast Food Is Better,Just could not fathom the taste of the food. South Indian food tastes good. The food here tasted like it came from nowhere. Get yourself some better cooks. No big deal - nothing to talk home about.
Average restaurant for normal veg food,Self service restaurant typical madras is food. Go to this restaurant for just filling stomach with out expectations
Poor quality food,"We had Briyani Poori meal. The briyani was dry and tasteless. Worst briyani I have tasted so far. No clear direction on how to order food. Token concept should remain in India, not in Singapore please."
A good food joint for veggies,"A legendary chain with main outlets in SG. Focusses on South Indian Veg Food. Must Eats: Paper Thosai, Appam and Curd Rice"
Tasty food and fast service,Clean restaurant with good food and fast service. We ordered masala dosa which was good and chole bhature which was average.
Awesome Family Experience !!,"Great Menu comprising of a large variety of authentic vegetarian dishes as well as drinks and deserts. The food is awesome , service is fast and there is something for everyone !! The kids love the Cheese Dosa !!"
Good food!,People are really friendly to help you chose from the menu. My first time trying Indian food.. Great first experience.Food was fantastic
Great food with decent variety,"We had food here a couple of times and loved the fast service and food quality, the cost is ever so slightly higher but I would still say it to be a budget option.

This is a self service place which had multiple options for Indian food. You can have Idli or Dosa or even friend rice with Manchurian or Cholle Bhature. All were good and tasty.

We averaged around 40 SGD here for 2 couples (4 adults and 2 child) for a filling meal."
Great Breakfast,An exception customer service. The tea is extremely nice and I had breakfast there. it's a vegetarian restaurant and the food is great. well the cleanliness of the area isn't that great but the food was made fresh and it was delicious. Highly recommended to have a super vegetarian breakfast flushed down with a cup of Tea.
Nice South Indian Vegetarian Restaurant,Great place for South Indians and vegetarians looking forward to an Indian meal. Simple place. Great food. The staff is also very helpful. It is always crowded. If you're in Little India looking for Indian food then this place that won't disappoint you.
"Simple, fuss free food","This is an Indian fast food joint. The service was prompt. The food simple, yet good. Loved the batura set!"
Diwali visit,"very nice vegetarian restaurant. reasonably priced, gives you the taste of authentic Tamil dishes. great joint for vegans"
Nice food with good portions,We had our food at this place and found good quality food with masala Chhas (buttermilk) here. All items were excellent and perfectly cooked. Service was fast ( Self service from counter at other places). Must have food at any such counters.
Excellent Food,Excellent vegetarian restaurant with wide choice of food selection and combo meals. A homely food taste with both Eat in and Take away counters. Clean and tidy inside and i was a regular in Komalas in 2013/14 and was here now and dont get disappointed with the quality of food consistency.
Decent Food,I had heard about this place before coming to Singapore and when I visited there it didn't disappoint me. The quality of food is good and the service is very prompt. The only problem I saw with this was that restaurant accepted only cash payment or NETS card. As a visitor I was not having NETS card so ended up in paying in cash.
"Efficient service, great combos, good food","I am a regular at Komalas when I need a quick lunch or breakfast. Komalas has mastered the art of efficient service and maintains good quality of food across its various branches.

This branch is in the junction of Rangoon and Serangoon road. Being close to Mustafa, City Square Mall and Perumal temple, it is busy most of the times (especially at dinner time).

The staff at the counter are extremely helpful. One tip is to go for the combos as these are slightly cheaper. If have any special requests (masala to be offered separately in a masala dosa?!), feel free to request at the cash counter - they will be offer you some good suggestions.

Food is good as it is in any other branch of Komalas and the staff are friendly. Would certainly recommend this restaurant."
good food,the restaurant is having good vegetarian food and lot of options to choose from. the food quality is good.
Nice hospitality,This resturant has great satisfying food available. I enjoyed vegetarian set menu. Located in good location. The waiter provided the excellent cusypm
Economy Restaurant in little India,The restaurant has self service facility and offers vegetarian dishes only. The food is economical but with average taste
Loved it!,"Loved the pongal for breakfast! And the masala tea! Good value for money and a chilled out clean place to eat. The juices take some time to come out, I'm sure they can fasten up this service..... maybe prepare fruit earlier so it just has to be juiced?"
Service was too too bad,I have not good at all in Indian food. I went to this Komala at Tanglin Mall wanted to try some food. I ordered a Tosei Masala as I saw someone eating. After sometime a Filipino lady called so I went to pick up. While eating she approached me and said I have taken someone's food. I asked her what must I do now as I eaten half way through? She told me I have to pay again. I asked her why when I took from your table when you called and you did not stopped me? She said-It's not my fault you took it yourself she said it loudly. This embarrassing me as everyone was looking. Don't you have a system so other guest who are not familiar will not pick up the wrong food? The set that I ate was number D and it's not good at all. I will never want to eat such bad food again.
Best veg breakfast,One can have variety in veg breakfast at the best price. The quality is excellent and everything fresh. The place is neat and clean. One must watch the turnover of the place. For us this is the regular breakfast joint. For first time visitors they must visit this.
Good food,Food was good and tasty. Authentic veg food Value for money. Is crowded mostly. Located in little india
Good Quality food for affordable price,"Been here several times . Crowded but quick to get a table , it good to get a quick a meal and move on ."
Value for money,"Tasty Food, value for money, very conveniently located at Little India, ambience and maintenance could be better"
Authentic Indian food,Love the Authentic veggiterian food and their service style. Reasonable prices.love their Tea . Bit crowded always.
Good indian food,We went to this place for dinner as most other places nearby were closing down around 9.30 pm they welcomed us and we had a good dinner..Like most other places in Singapore they don't accept Visa or MasterCard..Also the waiter brought everything at once even after specific instructions..Money wise indian food is always costlier in Singapore compared to local food.
Very Good food!,This place serves great food! The taste is authentic and the service is fast. Good place to stop and catch a meal if you are missing Indian food OR if you want to try some Indian food. This caters to mostly south Indian food.
A good option for vegetarian food,"A quaint self serving restaurant. Not too great on ambience but makes up on lip smacking food.
Has a variety of Indian cuisines, but the the southern Indian cuisine excels beyond any competition.
The food preparation is very prompt and it's a good place for a quick bite."
Nice food but they push combo meals on you,"We went there for a late lunch. This is a self service restaurant - you buy food coupons, go to the counter to place your order and pick it up when ready. Extra sambar and chutney is kept at a separate counter.

We had the combo meal of dosa plus ildly plus coke / coffee. Although we were placing order for just dosas and idly wada, we were told that only combo meals were available. We later realised that the combo meals were forced on us by the lady at the cash counter. The food was nice and the chutney was excellent."
"Decent, affordable Indian food","Komala's is a chain of restaurants across Singapore and even amidst the vast choice of Indian eateries clustered around Mustafas in Little India, this one is my favourite ( caveat: I usually stay across the road in Hotels like The Park, Farrer Rad or The Fortuna so this is also convenient). This is a vegetarian place though the menu encompasses both north Indian and south Indian tastes. You prepay, hand in your invoice and wait... They are very fast even for items that need to be prepared -- like dosas -- and I have rarely had to wait for more than 5 minutes even during lunchtime rush hour. You can order individual items like Poori- masala or Idli or vada -- but the combos are better value. A breakfast combo could be pongal-vada-idli or idli-vada-dosa plus a beverage: tea/coffee or a cold ( non alcoholic) drink. At lunch time which extends to 3 pm or so can order only combos not individual ""tiffin"" items. Combos for 2 will cost around S$ 15. A good, clean value-for-money place and I find not just Indian tourists but some locals frequenting Komala's."
Food is good hygienic and tasty,"They provided good clean hygienic food mainly South Indian food like dosa medu Wada idli sambar chutney and tea or coffee. The service was really fast as there were two groups waiting already. Space is small making it congested. Staff is good enough and fast in their work too.
We were taken to this restaurant in a group of 40. Already another group inside made all fussy. It was almost brunch as we were taken from the airport directly to this restaurant at 10.30-11. Though everyone ate nicely and left this place peacefully.
Overall had good food and service."
Crave for south indian food ends here,"Being on business travel for 4 days and I good get to this restaurant on my last day. You get good authentic south indian food. Dosa lovers can really enjoy the food here.

Food was good, however all the restaurants are small and accomodates limited ppl. So whenever you are there don't wait and grab the table whichever is available."
Quality food,"Food quality for komalas is a trademark for them, very delicious and everyday taste is same, very good option for the north cusine and south cusine very well balanced food menu."
Quality South Indian food,"Loved the food here, the masala dosas were top notch and the service was decent as well,the best Indian food I had on my singapore trip."
