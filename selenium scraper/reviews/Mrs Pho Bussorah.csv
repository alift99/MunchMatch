Authentic pho,"I usually go to Mrs Pho at Rangoon Road. So this was my first time here.

Their Beef Pho was tasty as usual, and you don't feel thirsty after eating it. Today beef was a tad bit overcooked though.

There are many other dishes to try, but I had something simpler for lunch, just pho and springroll.

I love their Salted Lemonade

The robot is cute and helpful, but thought it was overkill when we asked for chilli, then they make the robot deliver just the sliced chill.

So when i wanted lime, I thought I better walk to get it myself, instead of creating more carbon footprint.

Pho Real in town,"Authentic Vietnamese food in a refreshing decor with friendly service, including a talking robot server! Vietnamese Specialties Set for 2 include Pork with Rice Noodles, mixed wrap platter, Stir-fried Luffa with oyster mushrooms, frog legs curry, cockles in garlic, lime juice & chili sauce. Finished by sweet coconut & agar agar dessert."
Not the same as “old Mrs.Pho”,"My wife and I went for dinner last night. Sadly it’s not the same quality and taste than before the move from Beach Road to Bussorah Street. The broth of the Pho Gha lacked in depth and flavor, the chicken was not as good as we are used to and no condiments like chili and lime are provided anymore. We also ordered the calamari wir tamarind sauce which are basically standard fried frozen calamari and the sauce was only provided after we asked.
The chicken and mango salad was good but sadly could not save the rest of the meal.
Don’t know if something changed regarding ownership with Gourmet Food Holdings but sadly it’s not the same level as before anymore."
Good Viet Plac by Beach Road,"We were in the Beach Road area and picked this place as we got consensus from all the kids for Vietnamese. It was a good decision as it turns out. The place a narrow outlet facing Beach Road. We came here on a Monday evening and the place was pretty packed up for a weekday. Managed to get two tables from our family of 6. Ordering process is simple = just check off what you want on a piece of paper and pass it to the waitress.

Kids and I had variation of soup or dry noodles. Beef Pho soup was rich and beef done nicely. The appetisers like the spring rolls and meat balls were off thr fryer and savoury.

No alcohol served here. Hence I had the drip coffee. It was a proper drip with fresh ground powder dripped through - so have to wait, just like all good things, it's worth the wait.

Glad we came here. All of us satisfied and we did order seconds for some of the appitisers."
Vivocity - Cockroach and bad cockles,"Not expecting the fresh spring rolls we get in Sydney and New York, those we had here were small, tough and dry. Clearly prepared hours ago. Fried prawn on sugar cane sticks were oily and tiny. Smallest cockles I have ever seen and not fresh cos most shells didn't open after cooked. Found cockroach running across the table when we were eating. Waitress said roaches were a sign they just had pest control service. Clearly, a lame excuse that came from being used to cockroaches around or she had no clue what hygiene is all about."
One of my go-to restaurants,"The service standard here seems to be set at a really high standard as we were greeted by a server and promptly seated. After our orders were taken, the same server approached us within the next 2 minutes to apologise for the ""long"" waiting time and said it usually takes a lot faster.
We were served within 5 minutes - we ordered 2 bowls of the combination beef pho that comes with an extra bowl of soup with egg. The food tastes great as usual, and I honestly really like the run-down feeling of this establishment as it adds to the experience of dining there."
NOT AUTHENTIC PHỞ,Open 6 years ago ... the food is NOT authentic ... TOO MUCH MSG ...so miser with the sauce .... no LEMON for PHO !! the place is not clean and horrible toilet ... not comfortable to sit !!!! Our first and our last time !
Authentic Vietnamese cuisine. Pho & Salt Lemon drink is best,Authentic Vietnamese cuisine. Pho & Salt Lemon drink is best Several locations in Sg Best to take cash
The food is indeed tasty,"We visited this eatery on a Sunday night arriving at 7.30pm. Being a rainy evening, there was no queue and a table was arranged for our party of 5.

We ordered Pho Bo Tai (sliced beef pho), Pho Bo Tai Nam (sliced beef and brisket pho) and Com Suon Cha Trung (grilled pork chop rice, egg and pork cake). For sides, we ordered Nem Nuong (mamma’s lucky meatball), Canh Ga Chien Nuoc Mam (Viet wings) and Bo Nuong Xa (grilled lemongrass beef sticks). We also ordered Ca Phe Phin Sua Nong (hot Viet coffee with milk).

The food arrived quickly. The beef pho was simply delicious and we finished everything including the soup. The chicken wings were crispy and very tasty, and so are the beef sticks. The eatery is interestingly decorated, and we did not experience any staff who was disinterested or rude. On the contrary, the wait staff enquired whether we were attended to and also explained the condiments when our orders arrived. Prices have gone up but the food is indeed tasty."
"Nice broth, interesting ambience",The beef pho comes in a delicious broth with sufficient beef slices and pho. The appetizers or sides (such as the prawn skewer) were tiny and could be bigger given the prices. The ambience at the Beach Road outlet is more striking as it mimics a hole-in-the-wall street eatery with Vietnamese music playing.
Excellent lunch !,Arrived early at midday but place was already half full. Small-ish menu but still plenty of choice. I chose the special Pho which was great but also recommend the vietnamese wings and fresh spring rolls - all super tasty and very reasonable prices.
Amazing Vietnamese Food,"My personal favorite place to go for Vietnamese food! Not only are the food authentic, it is extremely delicious! To start off, the place is located in near golden mile complex although it may be slightly further to most people, in my opinion it's worth the travelling time if you're craving a nice bowl of warm pho that's guaranteed to satisfy your tastes buds. Besides, the decoration of the place is aimed to replicate a little Hanoi within Singapore & the rustic appearance really brings out the vibe even more. My friends & family would often meet up at the place to have dinner, the great part about us going together is being able to try the variety of food in the menu but the cons would be dependent on how busy they are during the period due to the confined space resulting in limited seating areas. Alright let's just dive right into the food next! Of course, going to a Vietnamese place means having to order a bowl of Pho. As a beef lover, naturally I had to go with the beef option for my first try. Firstly, the soup had such an intense aroma that can be be smelled even a distance away (friend was just arriving) & the noodles were just the right texture, soft but not overcooked. Most importantly, the beef was incredible!! It was tender & full of flavor that had seeped into the broth of the soup within the short duration because I couldn't help but slurp everything up. My friend had the chicken version & she said it was incredible too! The pork meatballs are also a must order, these are handmade with painstaking effort packed with immense flavour that goes really well with a sip of soup too! All in all, they're pretty affordable & a good thing to note beforehand is that they only accept cash so make sure to go prepared because we weren't. What's worse is that there wasn't any ATM available in the area so we didn't manage to withdraw cash & had to gather all the cash we had in our pockets. We actually didn't have enough for the exact amount so we were counting & compiling all our coins as well because we were still a little short on the total amount. Thankfully, the boss was really kind to us throughout and at the end decided to only take our notes & even told us to keep the coins. We were so grateful!! Will always go back for more & recommend all my friends to give them a shot when visiting Singapore too!"
Decent Vietnamnese food around the neighbourhood,"Walked past this shop for a couple of times and I finally decided to drop by to give their food a shot. Ordered the Beef Pho as well as their spring rolls. The beef Pho was good, portion was sufficient to make me full, just that I find that the broth is a little more to the salty end, and I find that I was really thirsty after my lunch over there.

As for the spring roll, surprisingly it is more to the crispy soft end, and the meat was really well marinated. I really like the texture of the spring roll as a whole and I think it is worth ordering.

However, overall I feel that service wise, the staff appears to be nonchalant about serving customers in general which made me feel unwelcome. Recommendations made by them is more like a FYI with no particular reasons on why is it good or not. Price wise, I think not really value for money.

Hope they can work on their service, and maybe go easier on the richness of the soup broth."
Yammy Vietnam food,"Valuable price and delicious Vietnamese food, it’s my favorite place! But only can pay cash, no credit card service"
Great bun cha,"I always come here for the bun cha and clams. Food is great but the place is quite cramped. Service is pretty decent, considering peak hour crowds."
Not the best service,"Overrated place place with over price Vietnamese food. Food taste is ok, but service is terrible. Won’t offer you a better table even if you have a lot of Baggage. Waiter insists you remove your bag from a carry, and when asked if there is anywhere you can put the bag it’s just an ignored response. Ended up having my meal with one bag on my lap, another stuck in between my legs and one more on my girl’s lap. Waiters can’t wait to clear your bowls ASAP to get more customers in. One of the customer opposite our table got his noodles cleared off before he event finished them. This is simply atrocious. In a bit she’ll it’s more of a tourist trap, basically you will find tons of tourists here. I know times are hard, they wanna get more business but the service simply is unacceptable. If you are having a long day and wanna chill over dinner, I won’t recommend here. Oh, did I mention CASH only?"
"good food, poor service","I usually go to Singapore once or twice per year and as I live on a tiny island in Indonesia i miss a lot of different foods so I always visit Mrs Pho to get my fix of vietnamese.

I really enjoy the food here. The rice paper rolls are great and the sauce is heavenly. Th Pho is nice and the viet coffee will blow your socks off.

The biggest let down is their service. The people who work there are not very friendly and when you walk in they are not very welcoming. They are often talking to each other and ignore you. I want the food so I choose to see past this.

Once i went mid afternoon and was the only person there and was told I could not sit at a particular table as it was for four people and i was on my own. Understandable if it was busy but i was literally the ONLY person there at like 3pm.
I really do not like that they bring your bill to you whilst you are still eating, it's super rude and would discourage me from ordering more. I also find it frustrating that they only accept cash. It's Singapore and its 2020. time to get with the times."
Dinner,"Had dinner with two other friends. We tried the Phoever young in-house drink and like it a lot! Very refreshing and healthy feeling! I ate the crepe with seafood. And it was very delicious. Compared to the one at HCM city, this one is smaller and the bean sprouts are fried. The one I had at HCM city is raw. Nonetheless very delicious! Bring back fond memories of HCM holiday."
Wow. I really enjoyed it.,"Wow. I really enjoyed it. Rich flavors and great value. My friend and I shared meatballs (excellent), fried spring rolls (excellent) and I had bun cha (which was excellent, but on hindsight was a mistake because it had meatballs and spring rolls in it too). Bun cha pork seasoning was wonderful. I don’t recall what my friend ordered. He liked it though. Food came quickly. They do a good business here. It’s not a place to linger. I would DEFINITELY return. I read that a lot of people queued and didn’t like that. I recommend going around 1:00 and avoiding the queue!"
Disappointing,"I went to this place expecting a wonderful experience given the queue I noticed the day before in front of the restaurant.
I should have better looked...
First the good points: the decoration is nice (but not extraordinary). It gives you the feeling of being in a Vietnamese street. Ok, trendy.
Now the bad points:
Food is far from being fantastic. As a Vietnamese, I know what to expect ! Spring rolls were good but too small. The pho was just a normal pho. Normally you can add some seasonning (fish sauce, chili...) but there was nothing on the table.
When they served my bowl, they also gave me a wet towel that i did not ask for. And it was charged already (the bill was already printed and put in my table)... Not a very nice way to force people to buy what they do not need.
Another sad point is that nobody smile in this restaurant.
And finally, there is no wifi, and no beer... Ok, that's their choice but i was really disappointed.
Then I was wondering why so many people ? I saw many foreigners in the crowd. Probably looking for some trendy place more than authentic food."
Decent,"Had lunch here, and it went ok, food is ok, service is not the main thing here, average at that. Price point is fine, it is what to be expected. overall Ok."
NOT GOOD,"We had the pho soup, both kinds, it was okay.

What left a bad taste in my mouth was the charge for napkins. They attach them to your bill for food and add it to your total. It seems like a cheap cash grab. Shame on you!"
Great pho,Great pho - with ample servings of meat. I enjoy my meal here with my family and will come again very soon.
Not vegetarian friendly,"On the menu it wasn’t stated which meals contain meat so I ordered spring rolls and it turned out that they were filled with some kind of meat.
The only vegetarian meal I could find were plain noodles with salad. I wasn’t happy at all.
As a vegetarian I definitely wouldn’t go there again."
Not the best Vietnamese food in Singapore,Not the best Vietnamese pho I tasted as soup is kind of tasteless which I had to ask for chilli padi to enhance the taste. Chicken in the pho comes in “pancake” style Which tasted like can luncheon meat. My first visit but might also be the last as I tasted more authentic Vietnamese food.
"If you're in the area, go for the pho","After two weeks of eating lots of meat, rice and fried on my travels, I was on the lookout for some filling foods that were a little lighter on my stomach. I did a little investigating on the eateries near my hotel and came across Mrs Pho, a highly recommended spot across the web. I ordered the chicken pho; the food was great, but service/ staff interaction could have been better. Price definitely is value for money as you get more than enough food in a serving."
Super mean,"Well, gladly we actually speak Vietnamese, so we could understand everything they said. And it was super mean, so please: if you don't want to serve people then simply don't open a restaurant. At least the pho was quite okay."
Second visit,"After a few years and the food is still as good. The restaurant is small and reminds me of the ones in Hanoi. Can’t say much for the service, but definitely worth the walk. Best to go early otherwise the place fills up at lunch time. Didn’t have to wait long for the food after placing the order. Reasonable prices."
Rude staff and Average food,"I am not sure how this place ranks the best Vietnamese in Singapore. Their specialty of beef pho was average, not great flavour as others suggested, many other much better options in Singapore. The appetisers were all pre prepared and delivered seconds after we placed our orders. The fresh rolls were hard and fillings non existent, sugar cane prawns were nice but again lacked flavour.
The food was average and certainly not worth putting up with the staffs and managers surly attitude and rude manner. That was from the first minute but got even worse when they “the restaurant” made a mistake and delivered the wrong items to our table. To the point where one of the waitresses wanted to charge me when I took a sip from a drink that she wrongly delivered and I thought was mine. I wish I’d check my bill better, I’m sure I probably was charged however hard to check when the receipt has the Vietnamese name of items. Not worth it, certainly not worth queuing and won’t be back."
Crowded but nothing special,"We ordered M9 an M11 *we forgot the name of the menu. Nothing special for the taste, or maybe we ordered the wrong menu lol"
Great Beef Pho,A small place a bit further up from Kampong Glam. Nothing fancy inside but the Pho was one of the best I've had. Price point for 2 (just Pho and water): $24
Authentic,My go to is the beef pho and cockles cause it is so legit and a great comfort food. Do check them out if Vietnamese is up your alley!!
Good Tasty Vietnamese!,"Authentic, good Tasty Vietnamese food but certainly not amazing. Service does not exist, it cost nothing to smile and greet you guest, or to be friendly during service. It’s affordable, but not huge servings."
Great Pho!!,I went to Mrs. Pho my last day in Singapore. I wish I had gone sooner. The place was easy to get to by MRT. It is a small but clean place and the food was tasty. I had the combo pho with spring rolls appetizer. It had great taste and was alot of food. Prices were reasonable too!
Most Enjoyable,Small and very busy. Good service and reasonably priced. Very good beef brisket pho - delightful broth. Certainly worth a visit to enjoy
Cheap gem,Great fast food that was very authentic. Small venue so perfect for couples and the food is very well priced.
Little Vietnamese gem,"Passed by this little place, packed with people. We ordered their fresh prawn spring roll, fried pork spring roll and garlic fried cockles. Fried spring roll was very good, the cockles tastes yummy but a shame with a few bad ones else it would be perfect. It is a small place, so be prepare to wait if you have a big group."
Please try their Dry Pho!,"This place is still my #1 fave place to have Vietnamese food. You must try their dry pho! I loveeeeee it so much! Accompanied well by their spicy chili, yum! But please bear in mind, they don't have much capacity, thus, I don't recommend this place for big group."
So Phorry Good!,"Pardon the punt but it’s really the ultimate sin to not order the beef pho if you visit this super popular place. The soup is so rich and aromatic that it can heal the common cold. It’s is my failing eye sight or memory- the beef slices seems a wee bit thinner now but still succulent.

Unfortunately, the Goi Cuon (rice paper spring rolls) was a complete let down, lacking character and one-dimensionally flat, taste-wise. A far cry for the average HCM version. This was partially redeemed by competently grilled pork chops accompanied by terrine.

Do go there for the Phorry Good Beef Pho, of course!"
Best pho I've tried!,"I love Vietnamese food and the beef pho was almost the best I've ever tried in Singapore. Though it was pretty packed, I would still say that the wait was worth it since the pho was affordable as well! Great to visit with friends and family too! Would totally go back!"
Best Pho in Singapore,Consistent good authentic Vietnam food. love the Pho (rice noodle)Value for money. Can be quite pack during lunch and dinners time.
Very good pho and a cool restaurant,"We really enjoyed the beef pho!
I also liked my VietNamese coffee and the salted lemonade (that was a new one for me, but it's yummy!)
Fresh spring rolls were pretty good but not fantastic.

Service was mixed - one lady was really pleasant and another was...less so.

Definitely would return!"
So far it has the best Phở in towm,"I haven’t been back to this Vietnamese shop for sometimes. Few weeks ago, I tried to get there on Sunday for lunch but it was so crowded and the queue was long. The Phở at this place is still so far the best in town. That’s my humble opinion."
Authentic but pricey,"It is a rather dark and narrow shop, which gives the impression of being in an alley.

Foodwise, the beef pho we had was not bad. The broth could have been stronger and there could have been more mint or basil, but it was still satisfying. The prawn and vegetable spring rolls were also good, though I did think $1.50 for three smallish beef balls in a bowl of soup was slightly on the steep side.

Between Mrs Pho’s house tea and calamansi lime, the latter was nicer. We also ordered a Vietnamese coffee, which came in a little cup.

It was surprisingly expensive - we paid almost $50 for two pho, a plate of spring rolls, a prawn cracker dish, three beef balls and drinks."
The secret recipe,"Mrs Pho knows best how to make beautiful Vietnamese cuisines. The food is simply addictive.

My wife and I chanced upon this obscure place after a movie at The Projector. The large crowd was an indication of its popularity. Since then we had returned no fewer than three times.

The ambiance of the place was vibrant and happening. Service was basic but fast.

It’s a no fuss joint for those who want to experience delicious and authentic Vietnamese food. The soup base of the pho was flavorsome, and the grilled pork was tender. I liked their salty iced lemonade.

They accept cash only."
Mrs Pho's delightful place,"Excellent place to catch a meal at home feel. We feel so at home and another couple was even more at home; sharing a low table outside the restaurant just like in HCM city.

Food was very tasty and service brilliant. So happy we could share a family meal on New Year's Eve and celebrate a belated birthday meal at this awesome place."
Attitude with customers needs to be improved...,"I've been to Mrs Pho 3 times in 1 year as the food is cheap and OK. The 3 times I had a really bad experience with the staff: nobody is welcoming you, the restaurant closes at 10pm but they will warn you a few times around 9:15 and at 9:45 they will do everything to make you leaving, they arent smiling at all.
There are a lot of other good vietnamese restaurants that are providing better service: I wont never come back.
Change your staff !"
"Good food, but improvable service attitude","I checked this place out because of the reviews on TripAdvisor.
I ordered the fresh spring rolls and the Assam Seafood Soup. Both were prepared good and fast as one is used to by Vietnamese food.
And now comes the but: The first soup that was brought to my table was the one that my next tables neighbours ordered. I only realised after I stirred in the soup with my chopsticks. I called the waiter and told him about the mixup. He apologized to me but instead of bringing my neighbour a new soup, he placed the soup, that I already had my chopsticks and my spoon in, in front of my neighbour and asked him if he wanted to eat it. Although he agreed, this is a really bad behaviour for service staff. You screw up an order, you bring out new food. No matter what!!!
Secondly, it was about 30 minutes until closing time and all the remaining customers were asked if they wanted anything else to eat. So far, no problem. But then everybody was asked to pay, even though they still had food on their plates or in their bowls, which I found a bit rude. Then I was asked if I wanted the Vietnamese Coffee I ordered for Desert, to be served for here or to take away. I said that I would love to have it in the restaurant but it was pointed out that it was not possible since it was almost closing time (15 minutes before 10 pm). There would have been a more professional way to address this issue.
To sum up, I can say that the food was good, but the service and their attitude towards customers are improvable."
Excellent pho in Singapore,"It was packed at lunch time on a weekday but people don’t usually linger and the wait staff are excellent in getting people to share tables so you never have to wait too long.

The beef pho is excellent as is the dry vermicelli with grilled pork and spring rolls. There is a depth of flavour to the dishes that you don’t get in the chain cafes popular in Singapore malls (you know what I’m talking about).

So come here for a delicious meal that won’t cost you too much. For those in the CBD, its a 5-10 bus ride from raffles place. For those who drive, there is usually easy parking at the Concourse building right across the street from Mrs Pho."
Good pho along beach road.,"I fancied Pho today and headed out to beach road to try Mrs Pho.

I ordered the fresh prawn rolls and combination beef pho. Both were good. Broth was clear and tasty.

But i would like the soup to be pipping hot and beef very medium rare. It was fully cooked by the time it got to my table. Will ask for rare beef thr next time.

The lime provided for the noodles were calamansi which i do not prefer. They do not provide raw bean sprouts and basil leaves for the noodles. Its all in the noodles.

The restuarant is small and narrow. Perfect for small tables. It does.get crowded and lunch time, but the service is fast.

Food and drink menu is very extensive. Worth a trip and wont be my last visit."
Excellent Vietnamese food,"Very good food, savory and tasty. In addition not expensive. The service is nice. Good place to eat Vietnamese food."
Attitude sucks,"This is the second time I’m here. First time was just 2 weeks ago with a business associate who recommended the place.
My first trip was a pleasant one and because the food was fairly good and the ambience unique, I decided to bring my wife this morning to avoid the crowd. (They are always been on weekends and most timings, as I was told)
When we arrived at 10.50am, there was no other customers and we chose a table which had 4 chairs.
A waiter (who looks like local while the rest looked Viet) came over and promptly told us that table is for 4 and requested us to change table.
Service101 - inform the customer the table is for 4 and if it gets crowded later, he may have to move them...
I would’ve been happy to move if he had applied simple basic courtesy and service.
We sat down anyway because I didn’t want my wife to feel bad... but she too was angry with the attitude as I found out after sitting down. So we left and had one of the best Char Kway Teow along beach road! (To be shared in our next review)

Verdict: If you want good service, avoid the local guy and speak to a Vietnamese but be prepared to be patient and explain your order slowly if u need to customize your order. Else, the paper checklist will do just fine.

(Photos from previous session - which left a good impression)"
Best Pho in Town!,Decently priced good quality Pho and beef. What I must emphasize here is their avocado smoothie is the best I find so far!
Best dry vermicelli noodles with pork and spring rolls,"This is a super casual restaurant and stumbled upon it when trying to locate the best pho. Ironically, despite the name ""Mrs Pho"", i don't think their pho is anything special. Their Vermicelli with Pork and Spring Roll on the other hand is a major stand-out!! Highly recommend this dish! The flavours are incredible! Such a delight to the palette! At such an affordable price.

The restaurant itself is located along beach road. Its very small with tables rather close to one another. You tick your order yourself and payment is made at the till - Note they only accept cash! The service isn't the friendliest but it is extremely fast! Come here for the Vermicelli with Pork and Spring Roll!"
Great Vietnamese street food!,Brought my family to try out the food at Mrs Pho - the pancakes were great! Reminds me of the street food in Ho Chih Min City. And the broth for the pho is absolutely heavenly. Will recommend everyone to give this place a try!
Good food terrible staff won’t be back!,As we arrived we were seated by an emotionless staff member who pretty much just threw out menu on the table and walked off with out a word. After deciding on our order we started to play some card games as we do every family holiday we go on everywhere we eat or drink. The waitress came over to us and bluntly said “no play” and walked off. We respected this as it was their restaurant and that must have been their rules but she could have been more polite as there was no way for us to know that we couldn’t play cards. After this the food came very promptly but was again served by emotionless staff. The bill was placed on the table and there were some hand towels with it. We did not ask for these are place them on our order but we were charged for them which was peculiar. We ate our food and it was delicious. When we went to pay we saw a sign which said cash only at the counter but luckily we had cash on us. This would have been an awkward experience if we didn’t. Over all I don’t think I would choose to return to this restaurant due to the staff and service which is a real bummer as the food was good. Teach your staff some customer service skills Mrs Pho!!
Great bowl of Pho,"I eat at Mrs Pho regularly and benchmark other Vietnamese restaurants in Singapore again them. The chicken or beef pho here is difficult to match in Singapore, a very tasty bowl of food and at such a great price. I highly recommend the Pho here."
Worst service ever- rude staff,"Being a regular customer here to enjoy good food but the experience we encountered today made me realize that it's not worth to spend my money on that unprofessional service, staff were extremely rude. It was the worst service I ever encountered. I won't ever bring my colleagues here anymore and won't spend my money on this kind of rude service"
the best pho ive ever had.,"Stayed at a hotel 2 mins up the road. Biggest regret was not finding this gem sooner, i would have eatten there every day. Pho broth was tasty and not slicked with oil and fat, beef slices were good quality as was the noodles. Staff are friendly and atmosphere is chilled and comfortable."
"Awful service, bland pho","We walked in and absolutely no one welcomed us or offered us a menu, despite the fact that 5 servers were waiting around and playing on their phones. The service continued to be awful throughout the meal, and the food was terribly bland. Would not recommend."
Like In Vietnam,"Food was ok. Tasted some authentic Vietnamese pho elsewhere but I must say they did it very well to cut down the pungent smell in most pho dishes (which I like) but many others cannot bear.

To be fair, the food are tasty and prices were on the average scale. More tuned to the office crowd in the area who got sick of the usual options available in the vicinity. Good, but it's nothing I've never tasted before. I've had better.

The one thing that was really authentic are the faces of the staff - It's almost like I owe them a lot of money and have been owing them for ages. Black & tired face, No smile, not very warm most time. Overworked I suppose, but it's like what I received at most F&B outlets in HCMC and Hanoi. Most authentic in this department.
The waitress who helped us customised our pho from something else to beef strips was nice. She helped, expressionless....(||-.-) That's why I said..I cannot complain. They do help and do their job, but.......somehow I don't feel welcomed...

In all, I won't say I'll never return cos there is nothing wrong with the dishes and I can live with the attitude, which was not rude...just not responsive. (On the phone they are surprisingly ok and friendly tho. weird....) But I won't go all the way to eat pho there.

To bring cash if to visit. They accept only CASH."
Quick but Poor Service,"1. Staff were fairly unwelcoming/ unhelpful/ unfriendly. I was first seated at Table 13. As it had no caddy with the ordering forms/ utensils, I moved to Table 10. I got asked to move back to Table 13 because Table 10 was apparently for 6 people. Despite my mentioning to the staff that there was no caddy at Table 13, nobody brought a caddy to Table 13. Hence, I carried the caddy from Table 10 over to Table 13. Subsequently, I got asked to move to Table 21 because ""the restaurant was getting busy"". As both Tables 13 and 21 are supposed to seat 2 people, I fail to see the logic of this explanation.

2. Pho with sliced beef was decent. Slightly stingy with the beef but it was served quickly (within 5 minutes of ordering).

3. Central location (CBD fringe)."
Worst meal ever,"As soon as we walked in the atmosphere wasn’t great, wish we had gone elsewhere! The staff weren’t friendly, very unwelcoming and rude. We ordered food which turned out to be very disappointing. A very watery chicken soup and rice with chicken that barely passes as chicken."
Tasty pho and quick service,"Great place to stop for lunch if you have limited time. Excellent pho, quick service and friendly staff."
Best Pho in Singapore,"It’s easy to miss this place because the outside is nondescript. In fact, we walked right past it and had to turn back.

Inside was fairly crowded. This place must be good since so many people are there. We ordered pho. One of the best I have eaten. Prices very reasonable too. Next visit must try the other food. Wife said the ice Vietnamese coffee is excellent.

I would have give a 5 rating if not for the fact that:

- the waitresses were non-smiling & somewhat grumpy
- they gave me sliced beef only when mine was supposed to be mixed sliced beef & tendon. The waitresses were too grumpy for me to approach"
Pho-tastic!!,Felt like a hipster viet Pho house that served up real authentic Vietnamese food. Menu was quite basic with not a wide range of options but the food was great! Will definitely come back :)
Feel like in Vietnam,"There was a table with seats at the entrance and makes me feel like i wanted to have a feel eating along the street in Vietnam. Small cosy noisy environment, i can hear most of them are Vietnamese. Ordered beef Pho - soup was very authentic as well. My friend speak to them in Vietnamese hence i do not have a chance to comment on their service. Remember to bring enough cash as they have not NETS or Credit card services. Nearly had to wash the dishes if not for my friend who bought along cash =p"
A Vietnamese eatery gem,"I stumbled across this gem of an eatery and glad I did; food was delicious.

Pros
- Pho Ga was tasty
- Authentic Vietnamese style in Singapore
- Decent price ~$9 for Pho
- Nice ambiance, felt like you were in Hanoi

Cons
- staff were a little cold, to be frank, I've not come across cold ""leaning towards apathetic' Vietnamese people in all my trips to Vietnam and also eating in eateries across South East Asia and ANZ. I guess this is a management style, my recommendation would be to go with a smile and be polite!

I'll certainly be back when I'm in Singapore."
"Great little place, not just for Pho","----------------------------
OVERALL: HELL YEAH
----------------------------
It's a tiny busy place which serves good Vietnamese Food, which rightfully means, that if you arrive later than 6:30PM, there will be a long queue waiting to be cleared before you get to step inside Mrs Pho.

----------------------------
...BUT WILL WE BE BACK?
----------------------------
Probably not, firstly I don't like queuing, secondly their food was good, but not so much better than all of the other (some even directly next door) Vietnamese Restaurants in Singapore, so if I need my Pho fix, I happily go to a less hipster place without queue and will still be happy about my food.

----------------------------
SO ABOUT THE PHO
----------------------------
Strangely some of the best Pho we've eaten was in Hong Kong and Vancouver, so the stakes were high when we were told Mrs Pho would serve up the best you can find in Singapore, in short, it didn't live up to it's hype, but we were pleasantly surprised about the other dishes we tried. The chicken wings, Papaya Salad, Deep Fried Spring Rolls and the Dry Noodles with Pork Neck were all delicious.

----------------------------
RICH SMOOTHIES
----------------------------
We tried their Coconut and Avocado Smoothies which were freshly made and oh so rich, we had two and the calories kept on coming through those straws, if I would have to choose I would probably go for the Coconut smoothie just because it was a little bit less heavy, both were creamy to the max and delicious.

----------------------------
WHAT WE PAID
----------------------------
20$ per Person (after Taxes), the Mains are around 10$, and everything else is very reasonable priced as well, this might be one of the reasons people say it's the best Pho, they likely take the price point into the consideration.OH - And Cash only guys!"
"Great food, terrible people","After traveling several times to Vietnam we often get the urge for some last minute pho and this place does the trick.

It’s quick, central and usually has a table or two.. also has a nice vibe inside.

The downside is that they are a nice restaurant caught in the mindset of a hawker stand.. no tissues, cash only is hugely inconvenient .. the staff are extremely rude and snappy"
"Arrogant, rude, unfriendly and unhappy staff and terrible food","I heard from one of my well-traveled friends that Vietnam is not a place to go, because people are horrible in that country. I understood why just today. The place was packed but all the staff members (young chicks who may not be able to find a job elsewhere because of rudeness, perhaps?) were so arrogant, rude, unfriendly, and unhappy. Sad people. And food? Why is this place so popular? There's no comparison with the Vietnamese food you can get in Tokyo in quality and quantity. And they charge SG$0.30 for a wet napkin that you never asked.
こんなレベルの低い店がおいしい店として掲載されているのはどうかしていると思う。東京で食べられるベトナム料理とは比べ物にならない。新宿に行けば、ここより安くてもっとおいしくて、丁寧な接客を受けられる店はいくらでもある。シンガポールでベトナム料理を食べようと思ったのがそもそもの間違いだった。"
Very very delicious,"We had spring rolls, summer rolls, Pho beef, Chicken glassnoodle soup, fresh coconut, homemade icetea & papaya salad with prawns. All of the food was delicious, service was very fast. Some of the best food I had since I’m traveling. Will definitely go again."
Casual vienatmese,"[Good points]
: walkable distance from bugis mrt station
: reasonable price
: good pho & hue
: close to other attraction in Sg (if you are visitors)

[bad points]
: small space and small table
: lousy service
: uncomfortable to sit long
: no ban seo (vietnamese pancake)

Often when I miss vietnamese food,
I visit this restaurant. I quickly eat and leave. Price is not too bad. I like spicy beef soup but the meal balls are a bit smelly to me. Soup is good thou. The meat in the pho was tender and good. So go for the pho is you are sensitive.

If you are looking for a pleasant dinner, a place that provides a good mood, prob It is not so recommendable."
Uncomfortable and rude staff,"Place is too small, metal stools with no back are uncomfortable and the staff is totally rude. The only saving grace is the Pho was good, but not fantastic."
feel and price so right,"oh my good.... is a really good and authentic place to try. tried Beach Road, love it simple n easy structure."
Pho was yummy!!,"Love this place. Small but you get the atmosphere, the service was alright dont look for friendly service.... the food will pay it off.
Price not over rated for Singapore. The place so busy and small so you might wanna do booking if you worry but people will eat and go, so wont really matter if have to wait little bit."
good quality Viet Food,recommended by a friend. it's a popular eatery in the area. very authentic Vietnamese food. can be hard to even get a table. good quality food for reasonable price
Love this place,"It’s a small restaurant with seats tightly arranged, but it has one of the best pho in town. Especially love the hot and spicy beef noodle soup and the chicken noodle soup. The grilled pork balls are also very good. I can eat at mrs pho everyday."
Amazing food,"We found Mrs pho on TripAdvisor and its definitely worth a visit. Be prepared to wait as its busy and often full ( the wait won't be long). The food is amazing one of the best we had in our time in Singapore. You have to order on the tick sheet on your table numbering how much you want of each item. The prices are reasonable/cheap. Only slight downfall was the first time we visit the owners child kept touching our cutlery, moving things around on a table and shouting at us making it hard for us to talk."
Excellent authentic Vietnamese food in an indoor street food ambience,"I wish there could be more restaurants like this one in Singapore, where good quality food is served fast. Most of the other places, have either an ineffective service, or a poor food quality. This place really serves home-made food and you can feel the difference. Pho are of course fantastic!"
For soup lovers,"Great soups are served here. And more than soups with their lemongrass chicken (with a bite of chilli). They also serve a good Vietnamese coffee. The downside is that there is no tissues in a restaurant or alcohol, including no glasses for byo."
Delicious soup and well priced food,"Visited Mrs Pho with a friend that has been here a couple of times as he was raving about how good the Pho served here was.

We reached slightly pass 730 and it was moderately crowded on a Sunday night. During the duration of our meal the restaurant got rather crowded so I'd suggest arriving earlier to beat the crowd.

For starters we ordered the fried meat ball and fried chicken coated in fish sauce and for the mains I ordered the beef slice pho while my friend ordered the mixed brisket and beef slice pho.

The food arrived rather quickly and I was amazed at how robust the soup base was for the pho. The starters were well cooked and met our expectations.

Service was prompt but minimal."
Must try for a good viet meal,Love the pho and cockles. The lime juice came recommended by the server and we loved it. One of the cleanest kitchens ever encountered. Uncomfortable stools and tiny tables though so only good for a quick and good meal. Very friendly servers.
Good food but lousy service,"Had phó for dinner following recommandations of friends. The shop and its setting are very nice, and makes you feel like you are in Vietnam. The dish itself was ready in a few minutes and very tasty. The service was not that good however - little English spoken, inattentive waiters. No credit cards accepted."
Good Prices,"I called before going as I had few questions since it was my first visit and the girl was very quick to hang up the phone.
The place is really small with small tables and stools. Interesting decor interiorly.
The waitress wasn't the most talkative or nicest esp that this is my first visit here.
You write your order on paper then they come pick it up.
It took very little time to get my food.
I decided to go with the suggestions online and ordered the Beef Pho and I also got the spring rolls.
The Pho was good...i wished they had other condiments on the table that is typical at Vietnamese restaurants...some of the chili they had was too unbearable...and I like spicy food.
Spring rolls were good but very small in size. Not typical size.
The other thing I didn't like is they charge for a wet napkin And there's no napkin/tissue at the table either? I had to go to bathroom and get toilet paper to be able to wipe my mouth and wipe my fingers.
The price can't be beat...of all the places I've gone so far in Singapore.
Def a place to try out...."
So-So Pho,"This wasn't the place that we travelled across SG to eat at - it was closed and this was nearby. Going from good to bad, prices were reasonable, service a bit too relaxed and ambiguous, and the food very hum-drum. The beef noodles dish I had was luke-warm, the meat was chewy and not very tasty. The yoghurt drink was just yoghurt in a glass with ice. Once here was plenty."
Walk in and discover a small part of Viet Nam.,"As soon as you walk in you have the sense of discovering a small part of Viet Nam. The tables are full and close; there are electrical wires looping along the wall; diners are coming and going and when we sat down the person next to us was so positive about their experience and the meal. The meals come very quick and are tasty, could perhaps more fresh herbs but I enjoyed the spring rolls, chicken wings and the Pho! The prices are amazingly good for Singapore and with no alcohol served you are there for the food and service which is excellent and the tables turn quickly."
Nice Pho,You can get nice pho and other soup dishes. The location is also quite nice. Many locales as we’ve been there.
Authentic and really nice,"The food was really good and authentic. We had the beef pho, lemongrass chicken rice, dry vermicelli as mains. They were authentic, tender beef, well marinated chicken and very good sauce. We also had the spring rolls and fried chicken. The spring rolls were ok. Not too thick and the sauce was good. The fried chicken was a little hard and kinda stale. It wasn''t the cheapest and the place is kinda small but very highly recommended."
Authentic Vietnamese Food,This place serves good decent Vietnamese food. The soup is full of flavor. Pork chop is grilled to perfection.
"Food is not bad, but service is terrible","My first virgin dining at Mrs Pho. The store is cosy and has a nice ambience but extremely squeezy bcos how the table is lined up so close to one another. Service was another bad point.

Food was not too bad. Would give it another chance to to revisit"
Genuine experience of vietnamese food,"Went to this shack with the officemates of my wife when I went to singapore. Two of the coworkers were Vietnamese and they highly recommended this place, so i figured, it must be really good.

We went to the Bugis branch and ordered the house specialty noodles, the springroll, and the fried chicken. the food was great, especially the chicken and the dips. very much recommended.

the ambiance of the place was really nice, seemingly authentic resembling a local food stall in vietnam."
Not pho me,"The food and the service fell short of expectations. A few years ago, I travelled Vietnam for 3 months and loved the food so I was looking forward to evoking those fond memories. Sadly, the spring rolls, the papaya salad, the beef pho and the chopped chicken and rice failed to ignite a spark. It was a reasonable meal at a reasonable price in a pleasant enough setting but, when eating out, I'm looking for a bang not a fizzle."
Authentic Vietnamese Street foods,"Located along beach road and opposite Concourse building, this Vietnamese store serve authentic Vietnamese street foods such as Pho, spring roll both fried and non fried version. Great place for a quick lunch or dinner! BR Tony"
Nice pho in singapore,"Is hard to find nice pho in Singapore, this restaurant can consider the TOP 3 nice Vietnam food in Singapore. Especially their chicken pho is one of my favourite."
Good food,"Really yummy pho, food service was really fast too. Spring rolls were good, fried one was more average. Though the restaurant is quite small. They also only accept cash."
Absolutely Authentic!,Food here are great! It's like east meets west! I always love Vietnam food especially deep fried roll and the pork chop.
Authentic Viet food,"Last night my first visit in this Restaurant... authentic food, fast service, lovely ambience. Prices very reasonable and sure i will come back Highly recommend"
Bad service,"We intentionally brought our friend to Mrs Pho quite often because we enjoyed the food here and recommended to our friend who new here. But today we all encountered a very bad service. And right from the start when we came in, this man who served us wasn't very friendly and he was very rude constantly to us whether is before or after we ordered the meal. He also gave us wrong ordered (they changed to the right item afterward) and he talked rude to us which make a us here very unpleasant. It's quite annoying when we received this treatment repeatedly during this meal. I hope it won't happen next round again."
One of the best vietnamese Restaurants in Singapore!,"I am a frequent visitor of Mrs Pho and haven't been disappointed once. I love the authentic Pho, the Bun Bo Hue along with an avocado smoothie. It's absolutely delicious, would recommend it anytime!"
