More than a bar,"Sometimes a place just gets under your skin and if you let it, into your bloodstream.

Bitters & love is such a place.

It has all the ingredients for greatness; passionate people loving owners and staff, uncompromising standards and immaculate delivery of cocktails & food to rival the very best anywhere.

It‚Äôs a place that involves you & creates an atmosphere both intimate & convivial with effortless ease.

One of the best Negroni Classics on the island, not to mention their Pandan & Mescal variants.
Sublime Vespers & Espresso Martinis, try ‚ÄòThe last train to Tokyo‚Äô for an easy drinking classic with a bite.

Everything on the food menu is worth exploring, the best ingredients either delivered with theatre or classically with taste dialed up to eleven.

Do yourself a favour, book (you need to) & spend a night with these amazing friendly, inviting and passion infused folk - guaranteed you‚Äôll be back again & again."
Nothing bitter about this place,"The internet had only the nicest things to say about Bitters and Love, so me, my partner and my friends put on our skeptical spectacles (our skep-tacles, if you will) and went on in. The combination of the music, the ambience, the variety of drinks and their presentation were all absolute knock-outs (including fire, smoke, dry ice, you know, the works!). The staff were attentive, the quality of the drinks were excellent and thumbs up were repeatedly given. In the end we had to throw our skep-tacles away."
Creative cocktails,"One of the main reasons I wanted to try this bar was for its famed Kaya Toast Cocktail. Kaya is one of my favourite flavours and I was really excited to try this for its taste and for its appearance. From pictures online, I could tell that the cocktail comes in a kaya jar and served with a slice of toast on top. It didn't disappoint! It had a unique taste and aesthetic. Be sure to mix the bottom, as mine was a bit sweet at the end. My friends and I really liked the vibe here, it had good music and the bartender was friendly. It did tend to get loud at times, so not the best bar to go to if you intend to chat for long."
Cool bar - Fun helpful staff - Great drinks - Cool music,"Popped in here on a whim, and I was not disappointed at all!

Felt like I was part of a secret cool club - greeted by the bar staff I dived into the cocktail menu - I‚Äôm not even a cocktail fan and I loved everything - I saw the value and work/effort that went into each drink which was pretty cool.

Tip - sit at the bar and chat to the bartenders!"
Great ambience and cocktail menu!,Brought a friend here who was from out of town late on a Tues night. Wasn't packed and we got to hang by the bar and chat with the bartenders. Even made us a cocktail on request that wasn't in the menu! Also a great place to bring a date for some cocktails. Thanks guys!
Jeez is this what passes for a drinking establishment,"I‚Äôve been to some dives in my life but this hole takes the biscuit. So dark you can barely see your hand in front of your face or perhaps it‚Äôs to hide the small servings of overpriced spirits and any evidence of ambience. Music so loud you can barely hold a conversation without hurling a mouthful of spit and venom at the poor fellow drinker next to you who wandered into this pit of despair.

A soul crushing void of atmosphere - if you like overpriced drinks, crap service and even worse music then enjoy. If not then avoid like the plague"
Love love love,"First time at this place but was really impressed with the decor, ambience and service. Excellent all around.

Music playlist was fantastic, bartenders were entertaining and guests were generally cheerful and singing along to the songs played. (Good sign when it comes to bars like this!)

Unique menu items concocted by the mixologist and great presentation of each cocktail.

I asked for a recommendation and was asked for my preferred taste (sours) and wasn't disappointed. The staff really knows what's great for you so feel free to ask!

Overall, great visit and will definitely come back again.

Slightly pricey but expected with such service and ambience."
"Top Speakeasy Style Venue, Ambiance & Cocktails! This reminds me of a iconic cocktail bars you‚Äôd find in NYC and Chicago","Top Speakeasy Style Venue, Ambiance & Cocktails! This reminds me of iconic cocktail bars you‚Äôd find in NYC and Chicago. The staff was incredibly friendly and offered countless suggestions based on what we told them we liked, were in the mood for, etc. Hidden gem"
Very loud music,"Nice drinks. Good food. But the music is insanely loud. Also, they ran out of red wine. Quite a bad experience"
Best bar in town!,This place is amazing I literally had the time of my life! The music brought back so many old school feels and the vibe was exactly what I was needing! The drinks were really good and the staff was super accommodating! Would definitely make this a regular stop
Best bar in SG!,"Best vibe, best music, best cocktails! If anyone wants singalong music and amazing drinks, go here! All the things you need in a bar is served here."
love the cocktails,visiting singapore and we were recommended by a friend who loves her cocktail. cocktails are well executed. some are balanced while others are strong. the dinner is a gem too. try the scallop carparccio and their handmade burgers.
very disappointing experience,"went there with a group of friends. For a Saturday night, the bar was nearly empty which was surprising. And the cocktails were exceedingly ordinary and diluted. We described the type of drink we wanted and were told the mixologist would create something. What we got was absolutely terrible. Mixing gin with egg white and apple was disastrous. Even those who ordered beers were served almost lukewarm or barely cold bottles. So much so we had to return them and ask for ice with our beers. How pedestrian is that for a supposedly classy bar... And the gin and tonics were so diluted, one wondered if there was anything in it at all. And on top of that, the cocktails were served with two plastic straws each which was so very shabby (and eco unfriendly). A very very ordinary experience. For the prices they are charging, they just do not compare at all to soooo many other bars close by that serve up pricey yet fantastic cocktails."
Feel the love and taste the bitters,"As soon as you pick up the drink list at Bitters & Love it is obvious that a lot of thought has gone into the creation of these libations and that the staff and owners take their craft seriously.

It was late on a weeknight and the place was quiet on the night of our visit, the staff was hard at work cleaning up and preparing for the next day, but we still received attentive and friendly service. I tasted three different cocktails and each one was unique and interesting. The prices here are reasonable considering the ingredients being used and the work that is going into preparation of in house syrups, infusions, bitters and more. Definitely worth a return visit, I'll be back."
Great little hideaway,Great cocktails. Music a little too loud to talk though. Staff friendly. Drinks tasted great. Good for after work drinks or friends night out.
Love their mix!!!,"What a lovely place to have some amazing mixture. Listen to a grovey music and have fun filled evening. The staff over there are just super when it comes to serving your palate. They will give you so many recommendation, will discuss your taste and will then serve just that perfect taste for you

Everything can be customized, that you feel like a friend serving you"
i LOVE BITTERS & love,"bitters & love is the best bar, bar none. see the pun i did there? fully customizable cocktails, impeccable service and great GREAT vibes. didn‚Äôt expect this level of goodness from one tiny place. special shoutouts to stephanie and sarah who are excellent hosts. kaya toast cocktail a little too sweet for me even though its the most popular. the char siew pizza is to die for."
Fabulous bar,"Found the lid bar in the lonely planet, didn‚Äôt disappoint. Good staff + good cocktails + good tunes = good night out üòÄ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Absolutely love this place,"I came here twice, and maybe 3rd and more. Great place to hang out with friends/colleagues and even biz partners. Nice music, the drinks are awesome and the atmosphere is really great. I love it when the staffs are like family to each other :)"
Amazing cocktails - price not too bad for Singapore,"We stumbled across this place whilst searching for a Singapore Sling. Bear in mind that it's quite difficult to spot the entrance as there's no proper sign - however, it's worth seeking out! The Kaya Toast cocktail was one of the best and most unique cocktails I've ever had. Absolutely delicious! We had that and a really good Singapore Sling, which set us back about $25 each (Singapore dollars). We wished we could have stayed for more but our schedule and budget didn't allow it :( staff were really lovely and friendly too! Definitely worth a visit."
Loved their cocktails,"Was there last weekend with my colleagues and it was just wow! The place was nicely decorated and the vibes were just awesome. Their drinks selection won't disappoint you at all. We had a little chit chat with the bartenders before they were wrapped up again on a weekend night. In conclusion, the service was excellent and the cocktails we had were beyond our expectations. Keep it up, guys!"
Exceptional cocktails and service.,"This place is a lovely gem. I had some of the best cocktails I've ever had in my entire life here. The menu has a big selection of drinks that all seem delicious. What makes this place even better is the outstanding service. The bartenders and servers are super knowledgeable and friendly. I suggest you ask the bartenders for drink suggestions, you won't be disappointed. Super romantic and chill vibe."
Special Cocktails,"Paloma ($23+)
Kaya Toast Cocktail ($25+)

Can't speak much for the former because I only had a few sips of it (which I enjoyed). Drank most of the latter & here's what I think of it:

The Kaya was delicious, & I also appreciate the thickness & slight crispness of the toast. The cocktail itself wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be. Probably won't order it again because honestly, I ordered it because it's novel, interesting, & local. Also, the cocktail menu here is quite extensive, you can also let the bartenders whip up something for you depending on your preference. So the next time I come here, I'll probably get something else.

There aren't many seats here; in the small (cosy) space they have, it can get pretty crowded. The music is also really loud, so if you want to catch up/chit chat with your date/friend(s), this might not be the best place to be.

Accepts credit cards
Air-conditioned seats
No GST"
Fantastic!!!!,"Great air conditioning to greet you and after that, some of the best, most interesting concoctions I have ever had!!! A great staff that instantly made us feel welcome."
Great little speakeasy!,"Lovely little haunt! Awesome cocktails, knowledgeable and friendly staff. Huge drink list - plenty to choose from but the staff will help you through it - just tell them what you like! Great digs and open early till late Will definitely go again!"
"Great Atmosphere, Incredible Hospitality, and Creative Cocktails","Yes, y'all, the cocktails are pricy however it is Singapore and you are totally getting what you are paying for. The menu these mixologists have put together is incredible. My fiancee and I throughly enjoyed our experience from the bar food to the unique concoctions. Fiona was a gracious host and made us feel at home. When we come back to Singapore we will definitely pay a return visit!!"
Overpriced,Overpriced cocktails with a twist. The interiors need some updating as my chair was wobbly for the entire evening. I cannot fully recommend it at the price point.
"Great place to sit, drink and unwind.","What a great little spot in Singapore. Great place to go with people, enjoy there great cocktail selection unwind and shoot the breeze. This is a must do when in Singapore enjoy the atmosphere and you will be back. Enjoy"
Outstanding cocktails,"This place deserves a write up! It is not your typical cocktail bar - concealed, great music, excellent service and really delicious cocktails. Thanks to fiona for recommending your new cocktail menu! Try the nonya confession!"
Fantastic hang out place,"If you are looking for somewhere to hang out, bitters & love has great music and cocktails. Be awed by the Moroccan gun powder uses fire to prepare your cocktail."
Wonderful situation and Cocktails super!,"The place does not see much from the road but it is one of its features! When you are inside, try the Kaya Toast and let us advise you! For me was a great discovery!"
"As always, fun excellent cocktails.","New (ish) location is great. Fabulous cocktails, unpretentious, great atmosphere. This is one of my favourites."
Blah,If this was in any other city I'd give this 2 stars and what I mean by that is its Singapore so everything is expensive but this place seems especially so. We had cocktails and some nibbles and it cost more than I'd expect to pay for a dinner. I also booked ahead via email and they had no record of me - managed to get a table but that was luck rather than good management. Overall I left feeling a bit underwhelmed and cheated.
Our favorite bar in singapore,Best bar in singapore. Hands down. Love their cocktails. Great atmosphere and friendly staff! All in all we spent abt $23 per cocktail. Also try their burgers and nachos.
one of the best bars in singapore,"we had a fantastic time here at unassuming bar in singapore. the drinks were good, place is cosy, the music is good, prices are reasonably priced and service was top notch."
CELEBRATE FRIEND'S BIRTHDAY,"2013 May 17-18 @Bitters & Love.

Recently Started Review On TripAdvisor. This May Be OutDated But I Still Wish To Share Because My Experience Through Photos.

This Place Was Introduce By My Friend, Michelle. Celebration Of SY's Birthday, Who Visited SG With Vicky From Penang.

My First Unique Experience, Asking For A Drink List And The Reply Is ""Don't Have"". Have Tried Japanese Omakase Meal But Never For Drink We Either State What We Feel Like Having, Or Our Mood, Then Leave It To Bartenders To Prepare For Us. Great Experience & We Enjoyed All Our Drinks Very Much."
"Noisy, Overpriced, Unimpressed","As a Cufflink Club and 28 HKS regular, I had high hopes for this place. With blasting music, overpriced and unimpressive cocktails. I'll stick to Cufflink and 28HKS thank you."
Worth the effort to find this atmospheric cocktail bar,"It took quite a few trips up and down the street before we spotted the small sign to this bar, but we were so glad we managed to find it. Bitter & Love has a fantastic atmosphere, good music and great decor. The bar staff obviously enjoy making new cocktail creations, and the ones they made for us were really delicious (even if they were a little on the pricey side!). The sliders we had as bar snacks were yummy. We'll definitely be going back!"
Great atmosphere,We found Bitters and Love under bar section. It's hidden away through a 'Speakeasy ' door. Great music and bar staff enjoying their jobs. Cocktails were ok - nibbles average. If you are expecting glitz this is not the place for you. If you want a great buzz then choose here.
faboulos cocktails choice in cozy atmosphere,"IF you want to spend couple of hours enjoying great cocktails, from most traditional to more adventurous, this is THE place. The menu offer plenty choice but the best is to speak with bar tenders and tell them which kind of drink or spirits you like and they are super happy to make some special editor only for you. They use alchemist objects and fire creating not only superb drinks but also the mot astonishing athmosphere you would like to have as draining experience"
extensive cocktail list,"small bar, along the street - very cool cocktail list made it super hard to decide. settled for a yummy drink which i now cannot recall. the staff give good service - left a jug of ice water after being asked for refills.. haha. would return to try the other drinks. not noisy that you can't talk, so overall a good place to meet and drink."
delicious cocktails,"Best place in the city for a great cocktail after dinner. Pricey, but the cocktails quality deserves, as well as the service"
"Fun, creative place with fabulous service","From the moment I stepped through the door I felt right at home. I received a warm welcome, help picking out the perfect drink from their amazing, creative cocktail list ....and a thoughtful overview from the proprietors of the best ""local"" things to be sure to do and see. To top it off, the staff sincerely seem to enjoy working there, which is always a true sign of a great place."
Amazing cocktail,"Bitters and love is a speakeasy cocktail bar hidden behind a small door. The atmosphere is smoky and dark, very intimate and cocktails are amazing. There is even a backdoor after the bathroom where you can go outside to smoke a cigarette if you need to. If you don't know what cocktails to take, just take a Gin Tonic, it is simple and served with fresh cucumber slices , delicious!"
Cocktails with a local flavour,This hideaway bar does great cocktails with a local twist. We ordered their signature kaya cocktail made with kaya is a local coconut jam. It's like having breakfast in a cocktail. Yummy especially those with a sweet tooth. Great stuff!
Fantastic cocktail bar,One of the best bar we been to. Excellent cocktails made to measure. Mangosteen is in season so bartenders made mangosteen Martini. Great selection of whisky and premium gin.
Brilliant drinks and fantastic service,"We stopped by as we had read the excellent reviews on trip advisor and weren't disappointed! We walked past it twice before noticing the sign and distinctive door! The cocktails were fantastic, the bartenders customise them depending on your tastes and we had some wonderful drinks. The staff make you feel really welcome and the atmosphere is brilliant, with some great music and atmospheric lighting. They also serve a range of cocktails from a menu of you prefer to know what you will get. There is tapas available although we only drank so can't comment. If you're after somewhere to try some 'hip' cocktails, so try this place out! It's not cheap ($20-$25 a drink) but worth every penny in my opinion as the drinks are made with fresh, local ingredients."
This is what we call a real dive bar,"We have no idea where to begin. We had so much fun. great service, fantastic cocktails, music we were dancing and swaying to and great food. Try their homemade burgers and skinny pizza."
This is the definition of hidden gem,"Wow wow wow what a place!!! The concept is awesome, chose your base( vodka, rum, etc) chose how you like it ( sweet, fruity, sour, etc) and let them do their magic!!! We had the best drinks!!! We went back again the next day!

The drinks are served in different cool glasses each time and it is just an all around amazing experience!"
a divine evening,"we have never had better cocktails and we have seen many good bars around the world. we started with white spirits trying their customized cocktails and classics. we had one cocktail with gin, chartreuse and midori and that was out of this world and well balanced. the staff is knowledgeable, approachable and extremely helpful. though we wish the guy with the cap would smile abit more. worth every dollar spent."
Hidden gem in singapore,"Singapore's most unassuming bar. there is a hoarding on outside that makes the place looks under construction and only tell tale sign is the light shining above the door. Beyond the door transforms into another world and a pretty marble top bar with dim lights, exposed wall and a tree branch hanging across the airwell. That said they serve cocktails that are well crafted and bringing out the flavours of the spirits. Food is limited but each dish hit the right spot. Seafood pizza is served with succulent prawns and burger is delicious with homemade buns and patty."
Free the Robot,"Best coffee in town, Free the Robot is run by pros. Authentic artists at work. This place is a gem their regulars know."
Great atmopshere for late night drinks!,"Came here after our long flight, great atmosphere for drinks, drinks are also pretty good. They have music playing and people socializing in late hours. Great for after dinner drinks to come and chill."
Five bubble ratings!,"I can see why this cosy place is ranked highly. Fantastic cocktails, with vast selection, innovative & tasty drinks. Four bartensers behind the bar, young, casual & vibrant place. Bar bites, triffle roasted potatoes are made from potatoa and not frozen."
Great little cocktail bar!!,"Enter this special little cocktail bar, sit down and allow yourself to be introduced to new drinks and flavours. A very personal little bar, with hand crafted cocktails and a great ambiance. Sarah will come and help you choose the drink that suits your tastes and her broad experience will also help you to discover new drinks you never knew existed. Go give it a try!!"
finally a decent cocktail bar,"a tad hard to find as the facade had a hoarding. it was negroni week so we decided to try the nazgroni, a twist of the classic. well balanced drink and the smoke gave it a nice flavor to the drink. for dinner, service staff recommended the tiger prawn pasta made with lobster stock and burger. both dishes were good and tasty!"
Amazibg cocktails,We have been to Bitters & Love three times and each time it surpasses our expectations. Love the music and service. They recently revamped their dinner menu. Ask for their burgers with sunny side up eggs and bacon.
"Great vibe, great staff, great coxktails",This a fun place. The staff are excellent and they really make the place. The cocktails are good and innovatively served in a variety of different presentations. We come here often although it's getting harder to get a seat as it's becoming very popular.
Tasty cocktails but ambience was a turn off,"The cocktails here tasted good, but the place was way too cramped for comfort. Came here with a few gal pals and we found ourselves having to jostle through drunk people at the bar in order to get to the toilet, and the bar seats were also not very comfortable. When a table left, we were moved to the sofa/booth seats instead, but the lighting over the booth was too bright I find, and rather than being able to just chill and relax, we felt a little exposed. Honestly was a pity that the environment is a far cry from the standards we expected from all our bar crawls in Hong Kong. This was unfortunate, as we really did like the cocktails, but probably wont be back due to the ambience."
Great mixologist!,"great place to go for an after dinner drink in this part of town.
Let the guys at the bar do their job. just let them know what sort of drinks you want and you won;t be disappointed. nice mix of patrons.
don't tell too many people or it will become too crowded."
Good cocktails and experience,"We happened to walk past along telok ayer and we were curious about the nondescript frontage, opened the door and to our surprise we felt like we were taken to another place. Drinks were creative and hit the right spot. Try the Kaya toast cocktail if you have a sweet tooth. Music was a tad loud for us but everyone seemed to be having a good time."
Amazing venue,It was birthday celebration and we had an amazing time! Our waitress was friendly and took care of us so well. Cocktails were great and bar snacks too. Its better to make a reservation as we had to wait for a table.
Nice Quirky Bar,"You would walk past this place so easy! It's lovely on the inside, cool decor and great drinks. Music can be too loud to maintain comfortable conversation though."
Best drinks ever,"Quite expensive place, but really nice and friendly staff. Had the best drinks ever there and would go there definitely again!!!"
so far my favorite bar in singapore,we accidentally discovered this gem on our way to moosehead on telok ayer street. so decided to pop by after dinner. we were greeted by friendly staff who explained the cocktail menu and how we can customize the cocktails according to our preference. we wanted something strong and not sweet and when the drinks - a twist of the boulevardeier (not sure how you spell it) and it was spot on. will definitely return for more!
Only if you love cocktails,I went with friends and the service was superb. However I'm not a cocktail person and felt those were very very sweet. Innovative but too sweet and fruity. My girl friends loved it though. It was very loud on a Friday night so I suggest go somewhere else if you prefer a quiet time with wine or whiskey.
Delicious tapas and great malibu pineapple!,"I am a Malibu pineapple lover and they do have one of the best :D The tapas is really delicious too but a little bit pricy. Enjoy the environment very well, relaxing and chill:)"
"Quirky, delicious cocktails","Literally a hole in the door to peep through marks this small cocktail bar. Walked straight past it the first time but glad we tracked back to it. Unassuming and once inside relaxed. Had 2 first day staff who were keen and cheerful. Was pretty dark (used phone at one stage) but adds to the overall feel. Would recommend getting the ""made up"" cocktail. Presentation fantastic and tasted great. We had food as well which was good but not awesome. The Wagyu beef cubes were presented well but a little tough. Truffle chips were yummy though. Give it a try"
amazing cocktails and service,"great craft cocktails in a really nice laid back unpretentious atmosphere. a local place with a bit of speakeasy vibe to it. cocktails were fun, tasty and inventive."
lovely cocktails,Loved this place. Went there for the first time for pre drinks for my birthday. Ended up staying there for the majority of the evening! A good place to go and have a good cocktails made for you and just chill with your friends. A good ambience!
loved it,Amazing well balanced and carefully crafted cocktails. They serve up great food to graze on and place has awesome vibe. Our favorite cocktails of singapore trip.
enjoyable night at this hideout,"this bar is not the easiest bar to find however just look out for free the robot hoarding. once inside we are taken into another realm. the waitstaff were friendly, patient and explained the menu telling us the profiles of their housecocktails. we had a really good time and enjoyed the kaya toast and love stone cocktail. wagyu beef cubes and prawn gambas are delicious. great job guys. we will definitely be back."
One of the best cocktail bars,"If there is one cocktail bar to go in Singapore, we highly recommend Bitters & Love. The bartenders have good knowledge of their alcohol and spot on our drinks. We spent just under $75 for 3 drinks including taxes which was well worth it."
Love the blue blazer style,"Just a stop-by for a drink but ended up with 2 drinks. I was thrilled with the Moroccan Gun Powder...spicy, tense, warm enough to sooth my mind after hard days work. Will be back when I'm around"
An interesting place - though too dark,"I've been here three or four times here and had various cocktails, and even let the maestro make one up for me from the selections you can make.
It's ok when it's not too busy, but it's very dark - in fact too dark. When your customers have to use their phones to light up the menus then your interior designer needs sacking.
But, it's fairly well designed, for Singapore it's cutting edge, for Hoxton it's an antique!
Go to see the decor, and the amazing drinks maker who revels in his job...one for the ladies or the boys.
However, I've not tried the food, and there is one cocktail that comes in one of those bags that you can get a drink in here in Singapore. Sadly, it's hung on some wire contraption and looks like a colostomy bag with a straw!
So, advice to owners: sort your lights, and bin the colostomy bags. Oh, and although I like attentive staff, it's a fine line between attentive and looking as if you need the tips."
Amazing place,"Many thanks to staff for great proffessional service !!! Ofcourse the food and coctails was top notch as well , thanks for wondreful experience"
Cocktails to die for,While this place is not easy to find - you are likely to miss the small unassuming entrance as you pass by- inside you will get cocktails that are simply outstanding . You just tell your base spirit and what taste you would like and the amazing bartenders come up with their own innovations . And the snacks are also quite tasty - we specially liked the truffle fried chips. A small place and getting a table would be difficult.
Fantastic hidden gem!,"Have been reading the review all over TA as well as Singapore local magazines. Finally decided to give it a try, walk in without reservation on a Friday night. The place wasn't too crowded but perhaps it was because nearly xmas holiday thus a lot of people are away. I'd assume.

The bar is on the right hand side of Telok Ayer Street. It is a shop house but you can find it by looking a white door with a small post box with Bitters & Love written on it. Soonest you enter, you will see a narrow, low light dimmed setting with bar setting on the left and few tables on the right. The meeter greeter (female - i forgot her name) was quite friendly. Because we didnt rsvp thus we were seated at the bar. She asked if this is our first time to Bitters & Love or not, if so, then she will explain the option on order the cocktail. Coktail menu is quite vary but easy to understand.

You can either order B&L cocktails menu or you can create your own by choosing your liquor base then flavors, etc to the bartender. There were 2 bartenders when we visits B&L and both of them are awesome! They are friendly and clearly articulated the cocktail options when we asked. They also gave great suggestions for our drinks option.

I am a BIG fan of Moscow Mule. So far i have been searching for a good Moscow Mule in the city. Found 2 places already and this one also served a kicking one! Thus, now i have 3 places that could serve a fantastic Moscow mule.

Music were great when we came (R&B) but then they changed it to quite a love mellow tunes. Then, my friend requested the lady (greeter/ or perhaps she is manager, not sire) to change it. Then music went back On and awesome. Faster beats i mean ... Not a heartbreaking songs.

Not sure if they serve bar snacks since we came quite late around 10:30 and we weren't hungry.

The drink range is $24-30 if I'm not mistaken. But I'd say they are worth it.

yes - i will definitely come again and totally recommending this hidden gem to those who are after one or a lot of good cocktails in the city."
Midweek dinner,"After reading good reviews about this place, i decided to take my boyfriend here for dinner since it was his birthday.
The place was packed due to an ongoing event but we were lucky we came early so we were able to get a table.
The staff were very attentive and explains the menu well especially the drinks selection. We had the angus and chicken steak. Being a not so big-eater, the serving is just right for us. Boyfriend liked the beef but he didnt like his chosen drink. Mine was the chicken and the kaya toast cocktail which were both ok.
Wasnt able to take good photos coz of the lighting which they can consider improving. The price on the menu is net, GST added and no service charge. Overall, the visit was ok."
Customised cocktail joint,"I've been here a few times now and it doesn't disappoint. The basic concept is they serve their own cocktail inventions, and/or tailorize them to your own particular taste. They also do new twists on classics if you want to play safe. It is expensive here however, so not the kinda place you come to on a budget."
good,"This place is unique, providing a nice interior design, food and drink are elegant and classy . service does not disappoint. and everything was very neat and nice"
Drinks to die for! Great atmosphere and amazing crew!,"Wife and I headed to Bitters & Love for date-night. The nondescript front door is hard to miss. Just remember that the boarded up front window is artfully done, and the door has a peephole looking in.

Once in the door, we were in another world. We were offered a seat at the low bar counter, and drinks and food choices and specials were explained. We came for the drinks and the drinks were what took our breath away.

Choose your base liquor [eg Gin, Whiskey, Rum] and tell your bar tender how you like it. For example, your favoured brand of gin, and if you like it sweet, sour or 'surprise me'.

The wife and I had 3 drinks each, with an extra one which we took away. We felt like a local spin of the 'teh-tarik' you get at the 'mamak' [Indian muslim ""pulled"" tea]. This was an off-menu item, but can be done if they have the supplies; And they did!

Our other drinks were Whiskey, Gin, and even a dessert based item. it was wonderful to come into a bar and be surprised by the beautiful drinks seemingly created in the spot. We loved the energy of the place and the wait staff and bar team were just amazing.

Food-wise was pretty good. We would go with the western dishes the next time we come back, particularly the spaghetti prawns.

A great find and we will certainly be back!"
Terrific cocktails on Telok Ayer St,"I love a good craft cocktail, so when I was staying at a hotel on Telok Ayer Street the first thing I did after getting a wifi signal was to search for cocktail bars nearby. Bitters & Love was only a minute's walk away and having checked out some online reviews I knew it'd be the type of place I'd enjoy!

As other people have commented it's a little bit hard to find but once you step through the door into the dimly lit interior you're guaranteed to smile - the staff are really friendly, the music is great, and the wall of spirits is full of possibilities! Special thanks to Sarah for making us at home - she gave us some great tips on places to explore during our holiday, and told us which dishes on the Bitters & Love menu were the best. Yes, the pizza was really good, and the trio of burgers that my wife had were really nice too, I'm told!

Anyway, the food's good but it's not the real reason to visit Bitters & Love, of course - that'd be the COCKTAILS. There's a menu with some interesting choices among the classics, but it's more fun to go off menu and ask the bar staff to get creative. Tell them a few flavours or styles that you like (smoky, fresh, complex, whatever) and they'll make something individual for you. They're very creative and knowledgeable and they seem to enjoy a challenge. We had some truly amazing drinks here, among the best cocktails we've ever had, and we had fun sitting at the bar and chatting to the staff - they're not at all pretentious, like some cocktail bar staff can be.

Bitters & Love was so good that we made it our ""local"" during our holiday in Singapore, and visited four times in all. If you're in the area, don't miss it!"
A hidden gem,"Visited this cool venue while catching up with friends and was not disappointed. The staff are friendly and helpful and I loved my vodka with lemongrass, lime and ginger. Just let them know your favourite tipple and they will suggest what to add to the mix!!
There is a really chilled vibe to the place and I would definitely recommend a visit. I will be back for more next time I'm in Singapore."
A literal hole in the wall,"This is pretty tough to find, but luckily we had a guide book to tell us where to go! It was a door in the street - with nothing to tell you what you'll find the other side, but when you get in there you'll see beautiful cocktail creations, friendly staff and a great, broody/hipster vibe with decent music and some serious tasty drinks."
Well-deserved cult following,"Yes, it's a clever marketing ploy to keep the entrance obscure, but once inside & seated at the bar, you'll agree the bartenders & their bespoke cocktails deliver. The focused attention to detail & practiced movement of all 3 experts behind the bar evoked sushi chefs. I probably could've ordered a better pairing than the refreshing Monkey 47 gin/lime/grenadine/framboise & the umami-bomb wagyu sliders, but both were satisfying.

As other reviewers have said, you can go with a classic cocktail or simply choose your spirit & specify whether you want something fruity, spicy, smoky, etc. - sort of a cocktail omekase. Service was friendly despite the crowd - arrive early, or expect a scrum."
Do not miss this place,"A little hard to find but their neighbors were kind enough to point us to right place. We wanted to cover a few bars that night but we ended up staying for more cocktails. Well crafted and delicious cocktails. Atmosphere and music, lighting were perfect and crowd was pretty trendy on a Thursday night."
Unexpected highlight of our day,"From the minute you step inside the cute little door with the peep hole, you instantly feel welcomed! Sera is so lovely and spent time with us explaining the in's and outs of Singapore, recommending places to eat and things to see. Hubby and i ordered a cocktail each to begin with which was delicious and then our second cocktail, we left it upto the mixologists' to surprise us. We were not dissapointed. The 2nd cocktail was better than the first. A truly special place, where u can sit up at the bar watching your cocktails be made from fresh fruit only (no flavourings) When we are next in Singapore we will definately be back. Thank you to all the staff at Bitters & Love for great pre dinner drinks.

"Trendy, Funky, and Fun","Bitters & Love has a great environment for a fun night out with friends. Patrons select the type of liquor and a flavor (fruity, refreshing, etc) and the mixologists create a custom cocktail. Drinks are good, but food is average."
Funky cocktail bar,"Small, dimly lit, hard to find but so worth it. Mixologists add a twist of their own to your favourite cocktail. There was a limited range of eats but we enjoyed our beef sliders and truffle mash Cheeseballs. Cheery service"
"Eclectic, funky, sophisticated, with an underground vibe...","... The mixology is so good here they could probably turn that title into a cocktail!

This is a great bar which specialises in cocktails and also has a great range of straight drinks, beers etc.

You need to know the address or be some kind of miraculously sharp-eyed punter to be able to find the bar, a very subtle sign over the door well above eyeline is the only thing that gives it away - otherwise this would only be just another boarded up worn down shopfront. When you gather up the courage to walk through the door you find yourself in a buzzing, funky bar - high end and underground dive all at once, with sprinklings of an American speakeasy during the time of prohibition!

The cocktail menu is extensive, with some great ready designed cocktails - and if you are up for it you can also ask the bartender to mix you a custom made cocktail. Absolutely delicious! The bartenders can also make your own personal cocktail requests. You'll be amazed at their superb technique, watch them long enough and you'll see them use the 'blue flame technique' - one way to remove the hairs off their arms!

They also serve beers, sodas etc for those who don't want a cocktail. I can understand why this one ends up being a favourite of so many, we'll be going back!

In terms of food there are some nibbles, and a menu but the quality of menu and ingredients is not on a par with the drinks. We had the oysters (great), the nachos (ok - salsa was delicious, guacamole and cheese dip tasted artificial), the grilled wagyu beef cubes (fatty) and the truffle fries (nice, but chunky). Based on the snacks we decided to eat elsewhere - it wasn't bad but it certainly wasn't special, particularly when there are so many good food places close by at Duxton Hill - which was a shame in many ways as we would have loved to stay and try some more cocktails! Drinks were the best we've had in Singapore!"
Cool Creative Cocktails,"Following dinner nearby during a Singapore visit, we popped into B&L for a late night cocktail, after reading a blogger's rave review of the bespoke cocktails and cozy vibe. Blogger didn't lie! While the door was a bit hard to find (only a small sign above it, nothing showy) we were quickly greeted upon entering and given the only 2 seats left at the bar. Service was unfussy and gracious and bartender Dee was chatty and entertaining as he prepared some of the most unique drinks we'd ever seen. I chose a spirit (gin) and asked for a cocktail that was refreshing and fruity. My husband ordered a craft cocktail from the seasonal menu. Both were delicious and beautiful (mine with fresh raspberries and mint and a chocolate treat balanced on top; his garnished with a smoking stick of cinnamon creating amazing aroma.) The food items others ordered looked delicious, and if only for the spectacle of the prep and presentation, I'd order the kaya toast cocktail next time. Loved the place. Wish we'd had time to visit again."
Our favourite bar in Singapore,"Cool space, great selection of spirits. Although it may be tricky to find, Bitters and Love is well worth a visit. The hidden space leads to an awesome space with good music and more importantly great cocktails!"
highlight of our holiday!,"we were here during f1 weekend. their house cocktails were amazing from kaya toast cocktail to death by chocolate. if you are feeling more adventurous go for the customise cocktails. good food too. try the beef cubes, meat ball pasta and char siu pizza."
I love this place,"I found this restaurant on Tripadvisor and I decide to go with my husband for dinner during our Honeymoon on Singapore
This is not a restaurant but more a cocktail bar... The food and the cocktails are fabulous...Best Cocktails ƒ± never drink before!!!!
The staff is very friendly.
You can't enjoy this place before 6:00pm :-)
Magical ambiance with really respect of the quality of everything.
All cocktails and fruits are fresh, fresh, fresh...Try the oysters!!! Oh my God! :-)
We was there with my husband for our honeymoon.
We met the owner Ernesto who came in our table for take us photo.
Just after ƒ± say him that we re on Honeymoon he arrives 3 minutes after with 2 glass of champagne :-) Very nice !!! We was so happy with our delicious champagne...
We reserve 3 weeks before because this is not a big restaurant bar but a really friendly and peaceful place. Thank you to everybody on Tripadvisor for this recommendation."
relaxed ambience with excellent service,"Took us walking up and down the street but we finally found the location with unassuming door. It is a sophisticated but relaxed environment combined with excellent service, tasty cocktails, food and good music that is not pretentious like other bars. Highly recommend peeking behind the door of this hidden gem."
Great Cocktails,"Didn't try the food but spent many hours trying various cocktails. Best I've had in Singapore, bartender was incredible. Agree with other reviews that it is hard to find."
Amazing,This place doesnt have dessert but who needs that when you have dessert cocktails! Amazing food and sexy spot for couples. Dress casual or upscale you choose
What have they done!!!!!!,Used to be the best place in sg. Went last night to the new premises. Still had the smell of glue from the fit out. Service was well below par and more like a double bogey. Have to say that it will be the last time I walk through the door. Expect TripAdvisor rating to drop like a rock.
Very cool bar with unique cocktails,"Hidden away behind the restaurant, and you can eat at the bar. Food was really good too, but the highlight is the special cocktails. They have many different types of gin that you normally don't see."
