Great first time experience at Koma,"The service there is superb, from time to time they will address your concern if the food or drink is suitable to your taste and active in helping you to take photos to keep as a form of memories. Will visit again to Koma on another special occasion ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Food coma in KOMA,"I've always love the food in Koma. So this year, I made reservation for my family to celebrate our 12th wedding anniversary. Indeed, they were not disappointed. Food was great as always and the friendly service from Gina and Chloe made our night even more wonderful. Thank you! We're definitely coming back."
KOMA never disappoints!,"The food, service and ambience never disappoints. Staff is friendly and very efficient. Another thing to note‚Ä¶the place is always spotless!"
worth a visit,"One of the best ambience I have come across in top restaurants of Singapore. What I like most was the accommodating nature of the management. Ours was 25th anniversary and the reservations were not available. We still made a request , which was generously considered. The food was tatsy ( cant have critique as this was first experience of Japanese restaurant) espeecially shrimp tempura and scallion fried rice. The dessert -bonsai tree was yummy, the Japanese chese cake was OK but not exceptional. Definitely a worth visit resto in Singapore."
CNY lunch,Pretty much the same excellent standard as usual. Bought my kids there as they have never been to the restaurant before. Really enjoy themselves with the food and the ambience of the place. üëçüèºüòÅ
Had a great experience,Everything was good. The bartender Shah and Ram were friendly and attentive. All the other staff too
Birthday,Best place japanese eat. Had the best sashimi (sake) and the best cheesecake ever! will come again soon
Great experience.,"We enjoyed our time and celebration of my fianc√©'s birthday at Koma. We enjoyed all the food we ordered. Many thanks to mr. Manny for taking care of our needs and reccommending the best dishes that we truly enjoyed. Best service! We thank also other Filipino staff who served us as well, JR, Jim, Ken and Fenny. The ambience is so good and the interior fits well with the amazing food. Will definitely be back."
Lovely Experience,"It was our first time at Koma. Food was great, ambience was awesome and as we were early before the booked time, not only we were seated we were lucky at where we sat. Great photo opportunities"
10/10 a restaurant you need to try,"The restaurant, food, staff, drinks, atmosphere, just everything. It was something beyond. Thank you"
Lovely place for celebration,Came here for hubby's birthday It was the best setting and everything felt right Love it and want to be back for more next time
Great service & ambience!,The service is excellent except dessert option can be better:) Only disadvantage is that the tables are quite close to each other so there is no privacy in conversation.
"Amazing experience! The place is beautiful, Great atmosphere","Amazing experience! The place is beautiful, Great atmosphere, variety, and a fine value-tasting menu. Exciting delicious food with high-quality presentation, service, and inventiveness.

Fantastic food and the best Ambience in Singapore!,The eggplant and Salmon were phenomenal! We keep coming back.. A memorable experience each time.. Friendly staff!
Amazing birthday lunch at Koma!,Leah our server was the most AMAZING lady - she accommodated my coeliac parents and made special adjustments to the menu for them per my requests. She made us feel so welcome and greeted us all by our first names during our meal. She was so friendly and attentive and helpful with our food and drinks and took the time and care to chat with us and ensure all the food was safe for my parents. She was by far the best server we have ever experienced when dining out in Singapore - she was professional and extremely helpful. Please can this feedback regarding Leah be passed to the manager of Koma as it should be recognised what a first class experience we had at Koma today because of the amazing food and drinks but it also was because Leah was incredible with us - she made our dining experience and celebrating my birthday - with 2 diners with severe allergy requirements feel like an easy request and so fantastic - thank you Leah - you super star!!
Memorable Experience,First time experience was great! Staff are friendly and service was superb. I would like to commend Remy and Mark for making our dining experience a memorable one! We will definitely be back soon!
Birthday celebration,I have been to koma couple of times and it has always been good to go back there .beautiful ambience good food great cocktails and very friendly and helpful staff .
Family Union dinner,Overall over good experience. Food and ambience was good. Yusheng was good but standard yusheng service was v bad. Fish was shoved down and waitress ask us self service.
Birthday Celebration,"Good service but very little choices of food. However, food recommendations by staff was very much helpful thus we enjoyed our meal"
Birthday Celebration,"Definitely having a great time in Koma! The moment we went in their service and ambiance is so amazing, everything just provides warmth with their hospitality.
Not forgetting our server May she was amazing and definitely the most best service and hospitality goes to her! She never failed to put on a smile and being extremely patient to us while explaining the menu! Indeed my most pleasant visit and the food is really really really amazing worth every cents! Thank you every staff in Koma for leaving us such a special experience! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Delightful anniversary celebration,"Our dining experience at KOMA has been pleasant - a great tone has been set right from the welcoming.

Service was good as well as the food - I especially appreciated that there were many vegetarian options available and that the staff knew their dishes well and were happy to provide further information.

My partner ordered the 6-course Omakase and enjoyed the yellow tail in particular; only the Ootoro was not to his satisfaction as it did not taste like anything which was disappointing.

As we were celebrating our anniversary, the team offered a little treat that was delicious.

Overall, we enjoyed our dinner experience and would recommend paying KOMA a visit."
Fantastic food and beautiful restaurant,"Walled past this place in the mall and we're amazed at how beautiful it looked even from the outside! So we decided to stop and see if they took walk ins and lucky us they did!

Incredible food absolutely stunning! The servers and staff are all incredibly too! Could not fault it at all!

We got to sit at the sushi bar and watching the chefs was also incredibly entertaining and interesting!

We also got a special bonus desert as we mentioned to our server that we were on our Honeymoon!

Absolutely amazing will be back!"
Amazing Dinner with My Loving Family‚ù§Ô∏è,"We had a great time in Koma! From the hostesses, the service staffs, not to mention the amazing food and ambiance, everything just provides warmth with their hospitality. Lea was amazing in what she does, always willing to extend a hand to assist us. Marvin was attentive as well and takes great photos. Everyone was just smiling and made our dinner experience special. Kudos to the team!‚ù§Ô∏è"
First time in Koma,Food are awesome and the environment is best for couples and friends gathering. Their services are the best as i ever seen.
Enjoyed the food very much. Fantastic service and great ambience.,Set meal is value for money. The choices are very wide and each has its own special way of cooking. Presentation of the food is very interesting. The food is also delicious. Definitely will come back for more.
Theatrical venue with exquisite tasting food,"Among the most visually stunning venues for dining here in Singapore. After a tunnel through a series of Torii gates, we were greeted with a cavernous dining hall, the edges were raised so the whole place looks n feels like an arena. A Japanese bridge spans a pool of water that acts as a mirror to reflect the fan like installations in the ceiling. Beautiful lanterns hung on both sides of the bridge and guests are all drawn to the centrepiece which is a rather tacky replica of a giant bronze bell. That aside, the rest of the architecture and deco are first rate. From the folded crane chopsticks holder to the lacquer ware in which the delectable treats were served. This place is first rate in service, quality and taste of food and the ambience is unmatched, it‚Äôs as if u were transported into a fantastical theatre set in Japan‚Ä¶"
Happy 80th Birthday!,Perfect surprise! She was impressed! Thank you for partnering me in giving my Godmother a fantastic birthday lunch. Love the updated menu with increased options. Less rice please
Amazing experience with my family,Amazing experience! We were 9 people all the food was amazing. Service was very nice! The atmosphere and deco is stunning! A must if you are at MBS and wants Japanese foods! Presentation of every dish is amazing!

Best Experience,"We had the Best Experience at Koma...friendly welcome and seating...excellently attended and advised by Ron...and, of course, each course was delicious with faultless presentation. Absolutely no doubt we'll return again..."
A die die must try japanese restaurant,Overall the food and ambience is fantastic. The salmon pillow is a must try! The maki is really yummilicious. The staff are all very friendly and provide really good service. They also gave us a free slice of mango cake to celebrate my hubby's birthday. That was so thoughtful of them.
Koma Japanese food,"Nice food and good service, staffs helpful . Thanks for the free mini cake. Definitely will come back again."
Excellent service and enjoyable experience. Fabulous layout,"Mark and Donna were fabulous. They provided excellent service attitude, attentive, helpful and knowledgeable. Highly recommend them for services excellent award. A little disappointed with the Christmas Sirloin Steak dish which was overcooked n dry. Mark feedback to the chef and a nice touch with a complimentary chocolate dessert was provided. Thank you"
Great Ambience!,"Overall experience is great! Nice ambience! Food is very good as well. The only negative thing is too expensive. Great for experience once, will think twice for second visit."
Kona restuarent Singapore,Everything about this restuarent is an experience that you will not forget The food unbelievable quality and the bonsai dessert phenomenal
Great experience with family and friends for my friend's birthday!,"Great experience! Little to no waiting time to be seared. Staff were friendly and the food was professionally served. I would like to commend out waitress ""Remy"" who was friendly and charismatic! She went above and beyond to ensure we all enjoyed our dining experience! Surprise birthday cake was served at the right timing and the food was enjoyable."
"Pricey, but quality of food and service were worth it","The Christmas menu was great with excellent festive touches. I always order the Bonsai dessert, it is a visual and gustatory treat. Their servers, Ali and AJ, were super friendly and accomodating. The ambiance is also to die for"
KOMA With amazing vibes,"Very good experience with Japanese Restaurant, Koma isn‚Äôt not just the Japanese restaurant with amazing and delicious food but KOMA bring a different vibes. The foods, beverages, place , interiors and staff ( especially the bartenders) is perfectly amazing.
Could give 5 stars for this restaurant and surely will comeback again.."
Christmas celebration,Black cod and truffle unagi roll most satisfied so far. Sirloin steak too fat for me and easily get cold when we only consumed half way
3 set lunch course,I thought a restaurant like this i will never be full with the serving amount of food but damn i was wrong. I couldnt even finish the food eventhough the food was so delicious! Definitely coming back again üëåüèª
Superb environment and service!,"Me and my friend are seated at the bar counter. Service is excellent from reception to having our meal and drinks. Strongly recommend the shrimp tempura and black cod, they are so good! Bartender Sha caught our curious glances at their signature cocktail the Canary and took the initiative to explain and remembered to come back to us to continue after got cut off with busy service, and top it off with a free shot for us each to try it out! Kudos to Sha! Bartender Ram is also very friendly by checking on us for our satisfactory. All and all we had a great experience at Koma, will definitely come back!"
Serving Staff needs to be more trained,"Serving staff needs to be more attentive . I had to wait so long to get someone attention including my payment ‚Ä¶ they just left the bill on the table, had to wave to get their attention to collect the bill to make payment"
"Yes, it is ""exceptional""","When we told the doorman at the conrad that we were off to Koma he said ""that's exceptional"" (not ""good"", ""very nice"" etc)...and he was right. It has an amazing fit out, that feels like an experience from the moment you walk up the Kyoto-temple-style archway corridor, but the food doesn't let it down and portions are generous. We had a couple of delicious cocktails and then stayed with the Japanese food menu. The bill wasn't as toe-clenching as we were expecting, either. Note - we had tried to get a booking online but they were full. We happened to walk by the day before we were wanting to go and managed to secure a booking with seating in the bar area, but then when we showed up the following night we had been moved to a table in the restaurant - so advice is to book early if you can, but if not, do walk by and see if they can sort you out - service is very good."
Perfect food and ambiance,Staff were very nice; the service was very fast as well. I would recommend it for all kinds of occasions.
Koma perfection.,"Food and the cocktails were amazing, portions were very small but everything was on point. Make sure you are aware of the dress code before going."
25th Anniversary Lunch,"I wanted to celebrate my 25th wedding anniversary with my family & had to book 2 months ahead. Food was up to expectations. The 3 course set lunch had the right portions. The set lunches are value for money. The restaurant gave us a complimentary slice of cake for our anniversary. We love the dessserts!
Decor in the restaurant is indeed instagrammable! We had a blast taking photos & pretending that we are in Kyoto!
The only drawback of the place is that the air conditioning is way too cold. Our table was right beneath the air vents. Even thought the ceiling is very high, can still feel the draft.
Overall, a wonderful experience."
"Love the ambience, food and attentiveness of all the staff",Shoutout to Kath and all other filipina staff whoe were super nice and attentive also food super yummy thanks again and thanks for the complimentary bday cake :)
Lovely dining place and great food,Lovely place for dining with family and friends. The staff are very friendly and attentive. Do opt for the lunch set which is value for money. I will be back again

We hope to be back soon, thank you!"
A great place for the family.,We loved how baby-friendly and yet gorgeous the restaurant was. My 20mo absolutely enjoyed the truffle fried rice and the honey glazed salmon. The crispy duck was delicious and we loved how fresh the seafood was.

Good food and service,We visited Koma in Sg for a birthday dinner and had a great experience. Gina served us and she was soo wonderful and attentive. In general all the staff were super attentive and nice. Ambience and food were also amazing. Definitely a must visit in Sg!
Expensive and posh,"Very high-class place at the Marina Bay Shoppes. Reservation is a must and waiting list is very long. Service is great, decoration is very cool and clientele is upscale. Food is good, but organic banana dessert not so much."
Lunch get together,"It‚Äôs the first time visiting the restaurant because it‚Äôs always fully booked and not easy to get a table. You‚Äôve to make advance reservations or keep checking if there would be changes so you may grab one. Overall, the food is good, fresh and delicious. Nice ambiance."

Warning food Koma ahead.,"We stayed at MBS Hotel for 4 nights we went to Koma on the 1st night and it was brilliant, service, food, venue, music, lighting. It was so good we begged them to get us in 2 nights later.
Stand outs are many. The rainbow sushi lobster was the best sushi and the middo cod is The BEST FISH I've ever eaten.
My wife doesn't eat dessert but she did on these nights.
Please open a Koma in Australia"

Great restaurant,Service staff are friendly and helpful. Food tasted great! I will recommend to my friends and family. Overall experience with Koma has been amazing.

My 3rd Visit within 7 Months,"I am a loyal customer. If I love a brand, I will not change it. If I love a food, I can eat it often.
This is what happened to Koma.
I love the the whole package of Koma: Romantic Vibes, Quality Food, Professional Service!
This explains why for special occasions, I must celebrate at Koma.
It started in April with my hubby's birthday, August for my girl's birthday and yesterday 24 Nov, the eve of my 32nd wedding anniversary!
Well done, the entire team!"

Nice place for photos,My 4th visit to Koma . Mostly with friends and oversea clients . They were impressed . Not so much for the food but the ambience n friendly staffs
Birthday Lunch,"Very nice atmosphere, staffs was very friendly and busy. Food was nice and very thoughtful of the restaurant to make a birthday platter."
Not so value for money,Set lunch price of $58 per pax is not value for the food. Desserts are good but mains and starters are not as good

All the dishes were great, kudos to the team in the kitchen and also all front of house staff who were earnest and genuinely proud to serve‚Ä¶ have been bringing friends since my first visit a few years ago"
Excellent Japanese food in unique setting,You feel like you're walking into an ancient crypt decorated for an emperor. It is a stylish setting complete with a bridge and giant bell. Add to that some mild EDM and it's an experience. Service is super attentive and the food very nice done. Nothing over the top but well prepared and not excessly priced.. Hard to book. Be persistent and call. Ask for sushi bar seating for great food prep and people watching.
