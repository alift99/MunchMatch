Outstanding bar,"Came for a quick drink - stayed for few hours. Not a big fan of cocktails myself but Lime's ones are totally worth to try, such as the Darth Vader. Good selection of spirits. Nice atmosphere with the good music. And, of course, the wonderful service provided by the team, especially Suren, Ryan and Alice.
Definitely will be back in future for a drink... Or two."
Not worth,"Bought the Christmas Eve Lunch Buffet spread and it was indeed pricey. Despite it being pricey, the food spread was very poor. There was the hype of how good Lime Restaurant's food was but the quality of some dishes were just not up to standards. There was no cold dish - lobster at all with an average of spending of $150/pax.

The only thing that can make up the price was the service rendered. All the staff were friendly and attentive, and were really helpful. But really disappointed with such a small buffet spread of mediocre quality."
2nd visit was not as good as the first,"After a lovely experience at Lime in a few months ago (if I didn't recall wrongly we were super impressed by their staff Denzel), we decided to revisit for my birthday.
2 days before the reservation, a whatsapp message was sent to me to confirm the booking, and I shared my excitement about revisiting for my birthday. I didn't ask for anything, but Lime offered to put in a slice of birthday cake for me (not expecting it, but feel happy for such a kind gesture)
Fast forward 2 days later, when we arrived, we were given a table in a rather central location of the restaurant, and would have preferred 1 at the side, we tried to ask, but server was hesitant, so we erased the idea. Unfortunately the table beside us spoke loudly without pauses for the next 1.5hrs, but we understand that the restaurant can't do much about that too, so no fault was placed on them,
I enjoyed the durian pengat most, followed by the fresh chilled prawns, while my husband loved the laksa and pandan chiffon cake more.
No sign of the cake that was mentioned in their message was served though, and I didn't think I should be asking for it since it was meant as a goodwill gesture by Lime. Would have been better if they made an effort to remember, or they should not have even mentioned it while confirming the booking. Definitely not hard up for the cake, but we just didn't like the feeling of someone saying they will do something but it's not fulfilled.
There was a 15% discount by Citi when we paid at the reception counter, which was nice.
Food - Good
Service - Could be better"
Outstanding Hospitality,"The moment I stepfoot into the ParkRoyal Pickering, I was greeted and welcomed by Natasha and Murli at the entrance, which elevated my experience as I was excited to indulge in the Christmas-festive buffet food.

To add on, Ryan, Thu zar and Jay Rex served both me and my partner with great hospitality as we feast on the wide range of food available.

Thank you so much for your hospitality and service, kudos to you guys!"
Friends gathering,"Food was good, and the seafood especially the oysters were very fresh. Our waiter, Chang, was very helpful, efficient, and was very attentive and accommodating. The restaurant had great Christmas decor too."
Average,They should have informed on the page itself that there is additional top-up for festive lunch or even when customers just arrive at the place. Could have said something. And not halfway through the lunch you ask your customer to pay up.
Surprising Visit WOWed by James!,"It's a random visit to come to Lime for a catch up over some drinks. I was pleasantly surprised by James's service! He's friendly, a great conversation maker, and a very experienced mixologist who is able to give superb recommendations. We totally love interacting with him. He's meticulous and checks on the comfort & satisfaction.

Tried 'Darth Vader in Tight Jeans' & 'Punch by Bruce Lee'. Fantastic recommendation!

Will I return again? Definitely.
Will I recommend? Yes..please do.

Thank you Janes for adding an additional sweet touch to our lovely night."
What an awesome service- James at Lime,"James is such a dear! Polite, professional and so grounded. He knows his drinks excellently well and great recommendation. I enjoyed my wine recommended by James. And of course Punch by Bruce Lee. Thank you James for your excellent service! Well done!"
Chillin Birthday Night,"My friends and I celebrated my birthday at the Lime and it was amazing! I love the interior design it was different from the others high ceiling with the eco friendly style ambience. The food was decent its just had limited choices. They have these pass around dishes and its kinda unique from the other regular buffet restaurant. We loved their fresh seafood especially the oysters it was fresh and juicy! In addition, there lobster laksa was fantastic and you should try it!
The staff are very attentive and accomodating they even made an extra mile to have a free lucky draw! That was amazing! ☺️
Its worth the visit and a memorable night for us!
Thank you"
Special dish by Chef Shashi of Lime Restaurant,"We are delighted by the thoughtfulness of Chef Shashi from LIme restaurant. It was my birthday and was craving for something comforting. We described the noodle dish to Chef Shashi. He say he would try to whip it up for us. To our surprise, the noodle dish hits all the right spot! Never have we been so touched by this kind gesture to create a noodle dish just for us. We are not VVIPs but were treated like special guests! We later found out he ran over to the nearby supermarket to purchase the special noodles just for our dish. This service is what makes us return to Lime ... Lime bar bartender James is always exceptional, as well as Belgium, Suren and the whole gang.. Always very smiley and welcoming. This place marks a sweet ending to my birthday and will always hold a special spot for us! Thank U to the Lime gang! You are simply the best!!"
Great food! Wonderful Service!,"My family and I had a wonderful time with this restaurant. We enjoyed the food and all the staff were very attentive, cheerful and helpful especially Aesa and Dereck (hope i spelled their names correctly). We will come back for sure!"
Service and food,The service was fantastic. Staff was perfect and they were really kind. They tried their best to give a fantastic service and it met my expectations. A big round of applause to the staffs there. It was an awesome and an enjoyable experience. The food on the other hand was really delicious and gourmet. It was perfect and fit my taste buds. Props to the chefs there. They really satisfied my palate. The place has both beautiful interior and exterior. I recommend this place!
Tiers of Joy,"Tiers of Joy is the cutely named high tea at Lime, situated in the Parkroyal on Pickering, Singapore. Some of my family and I enjoyed this lovely experience as part of my birthday celebration and all of us were more than satisfied. The food was delicious and the endless cups of tea were more than welcome. And I can't forget the wonderful welcoming attention of both Satieeish and Michael. Thanks all for a lovely experience, one that I am happy to recommend."
Bleh buffet lunch,"Had buffet lunch to celebrate an occasion. I was so disappointed. Paying S$87 but the spread was so limited, ie no oyster, no lobster, cooked food tasted was so so."
Great Restourant,Great quality of food. Like the Asian food the most as well a the cheese cake from the LIME. Great chef. definitely will come back again
Lobster feast with no lobster bodies seen,Very disappointed as we came especially for lobsters but was told weekend lunch don't come with what indicated in the promotion. Paying more than 88sgd only had lobster claws in laksa and they limit our request. Payment showing lobster feast so unhappy with the over experience feeling cheated. Hearing many other customers questioning the waiters and waitress too.
Had the Lobsterfest set lunch on a weekday,"Could not get reservations for the Lobsterfest buffet as they were only taking reservations for big groups (not for 2 pax) so I settled for the Lobsterfest set lunch at SGD45/pax. It was amazingly disappointing, which made not getting reservations for the SGD162/pax buffet a welcome relief. The lobster bisque was devoid of lobster flavour or meat (far inferior to the lobster bisque at Jack's Place, which is served with pillowy warm garlic bread, compared to Lime's cold and hard garlic bread which seemed to be leftover from breakfast maybe). The mains (lobster risotto and lobster ee-fu noodles were mercifully forgettable) and dessert was an unfortunately memorable mishmash of small pieces of fruit reminiscent of what one associates with canned cocktail."
Disappointed,"lunch buffet with 2 friends here to celebrate my birthday, from the picture on website , food on menus looks impressive but not that fantastic actually. we made sure to be on time as was told by the restaurant reservation for that day was full house. Maybe the manager at counter was so overwhelm by the full house reservation, I don't feel welcome at all."
LobsterFest & Good Service,"Both my girlfriend and I enjoyed the LobsterFest , especially the lobster bisque and risotto, which were exceptional. We loved the ambience and table arrangements, and the staff was friendly, polite, and helpful, the training must have done them justice .
Satieeish in particular deserves recognition for his creditability, so I wish to thank him for that."
utter disappointment,"Limited lobster spread means a drop from 12 to merely 3 dishes, of which you can only find lobster meat from the laksa. Kitchen was really slow in refilling the dishes. And towards 1.30pm they stop refilling entriely. Variety was pathetic small and were in very small portions. Totally not worth the $88 price tag. Never going there again."
Lobster galore with just minor glitches,"The lobsters served are quite fresh and tasty. The service provided was also adequate but felt they having a manpower crunch coz their staff quite overwhelmed.

Only negative point was the slow replenishment of food at the buffet counters. Some dishes like chilli lobsters , halibut fish took quite a while to get replenished after it ran out.

Will be great if a wider variety of beer is offered instead of just one brand which is included in this buffet.

I would also suggest offering a wash bowl with lemon water for diners to wash their hands as eating lobsters can get messy esp for chilli lobster dish!"
RE: Very friend and helpful Restaurant staffs,"A lot of food choices, excellent dining and cleanness. this is my 3 times of visiting.
so as the in-room dinning."
A great buffet experience.,All the staff is very dedicated and friendly. The food selection is wide and interesting. The food quality is great. Even soft drinks are part of the package. A must revisit.
Great cocktails and interesting menu,"While staying in the Parkroyal Pickering Hotel, we visited the Lime Restaurant for a couple of meals and the bar for a couple more occasions. The bar staff know their stuff and have invented some really interesting cocktails as well as being able to provide house-made vanilla smoked whisky-very tasty and unusual. Food was good quality and not like usual hotel food. If you are staying at the hotel, you receive a discount on your bill. Would recommend."
Great food!,"It was our first time having buffet dinner at Lime Restaurant and the experience was excellent.
The restaurant is spacious, food selection is good and taste great, the service is excellent, too.
The waiter/waitress would clean our dirty plates very quickly, they even offered complimentary cake and candle for our birthday friends. I would come back for sure! Highly recommended!"
Like the spacious ambience and decor,"I was having an ala carte dinner here during a recent staycay. Tuna salad, seafood chowder, oysters and grilled cod.

I’ll give the grill cod a miss and the rest was good. Service was impeccable for me.

Love the overall ambience and the spacious feeling. Might want to try the buffet here next time."
Breakfast was good with options,Amazing restaurant with great view and breakfast was good with lots of options. Hotel was amazing and highly recommended.
How to ruin a nice place with bad service/unapropriate emplyoyees...,"I had dinner on 28 April around 8pm. I liked the location from outside while we were going next to it. Although it was almost empty we stoped to check it. We stayed for a while and no one came to us to bring us the menus. I went to ask them and we placed the food and drinks order. Food was very good, but when they brought the food they directly brought the bill although I didn't asked for it. I gave the the credit card and the lady left (we were on the terrace). Of course I told her that it is not normal to bring the bill now but she ignored me.
While we were eating she came to tell me that the credit card is not working. Of course it was working, but as strange as it seems she didn't know some basic things about credit card payments. I told her that it is not noemal to process payments while we are during lunch, but she ignored me again. Some seconds later she asked me if I want one more beer..:). Of course I refused becuse we didn't felt welcome. Otgerwise the location could be a bit more clean, but is overall a nice place with good food... so if you are lucky you might have a different experience."
Buffet dinner,"I would like to thank the restaurant manager, Yus, for his bubbly personality while making my 21st birthday memorable. The staff, waiter and waitresses — Wang Jian Ping, Eileen and a short-hair lady who served us throughout our time at Lime are surprisingly attentive. Such a service would not be possible without the proper management of the restaurant manager. My family and I had a worthwhile dinner. We appreciate the GEMS service from your fellow workers too!"
Excellent Service,"Nice ambience and definitely with good food to match. Perhaps the best of all is the exceptional service by Eileen, who very patiently took the time to explain the menu, food, recommendations, and also checking up on us along the night.

Walked away surprised and had a very pleasant night, thank you Eileen!"
Litmus paper test on Lime failed again,"Done a review for their xmas buffet in 2017, how is this acclaimed lime (turning sour)4yrs down the road (in the pandemic era of covid)? Esp it is in the top 400th in similar cuisine/catgeory out of the 13K restaurants, the more it need more honest regular reviews!
For the price we paid, having buffet in the pandemic is really no enjoyment, as everything is served by the wait-staff in bits and grab, you cannot self-grab the food on your own and decide how much u wanna

I have already mentally lowered my expectation! eg the selection of sashimi will be limited! The famous dessert- durian pengat is reduced to a pathetic small cups (but of cos u can go for as many rounds)
However, nearly all their soups are well-made! Luv them so muccchh!

I dont remember having any Foie Gras (have it in 2017!) this round

The chilli crab is small sized but would be better if they help the customers to crack the crabs more….
Seafood and most food selections are badly reduced , i thk Lime shd half the price!!! We shdnt be paying so muchhhh for rhe decor)

the beef is quite tender and well-roasted but isnt this a basic expectation??!
What more could i say then? The litmus test failed… Lime turned sour? Was expecting the Christmas pricing which we paid could be much more befitting!"
Excellent service,"Had an a-la-carte lunch at Lime on a Sunday afternoon, and was greeted by wonderful service from Amy, whose cheerfulness and attentiveness really made our days.
We had a Shellfish on Ice Platter, as well as Caesar Salad, and Fried Chicken & Waffle. The cooked shellfishes are relatively fresh and yummy, the chicken waffle... I probably love the waffle more than the fried chicken.
Overall, a very pleasant dining experience, and I will be back."
"Great Food, Superb Service","Celebrated my friend’s birthday at Lime restaurant. Had their international buffet dinner which was fabulous, especially the sashimi, oysters and scallops. We were especially impressed with the service provided by the waitress, Eileen Soo, who was always smiling and attentive. Love the ambience too! Would definitely come back again."
Only 4 tables occupied tables but no service,"Had been wanting to try famous high tea at Lime for years but was never able to secure a reservation. Finally dined there with a friend on Friday afternoon.

It’s a straight forward menu or either free flow coffee/tea for $74 or add 2 glasses of Prosecco for $78. No brained which one we chose.

We had to place our order for the Prosecco 3 times. Staff could not explain the low/high acidity of the Baccha coffees that were available. The French press coffee came with no cup. Placed an order with one staff and she took the order but when to get another staff to take the order again.

I empathize with the COVID staffing situation. But these staff appeared to have little training and just put to work. Pity."
Breakfast experience @ Lime Restaurant,"Staff
Friendly and approachable

Food
Glad that it was still full buffet style as some other hotels were still serving semi-buffet. *Thumbs up*"
Excellent service and great food,"I came with my family and the restaurant was full. Immediately, the staff tried to find a table for us. The manager, Nigel, even went an extra mile by decorating a cake to celebrate my girls birthday. I also ordered a lemon meringue pie and it was served warm. All the desserts were lovely! Will definitely be back with our friends and family!"
Worst buffet,"Visited the Lime restaurant and will never go back again. Worst buffet ever. Lady Chef who assisted us was rude. Ask her for fish maw soup and she told us don’t have, but the restaurant only have 3 tables join for buffet. Later then she brought out a big container of fish maw soup, but I think they cut all the cost with very little fish maw and other ingredient to cook the soup, the soup basically is a starch soup (refer to the picture).

Ask for the choice of juice available, the lady supervisor name twinkle told us to scan QR code to order. We only see orange and Coca Cola. We ask for other choices but was told there is no other choice. Refer to the discovery website, they mentioned choice of juices and soft drinks, coffee and tea inclusive in the buffet (refer to the picture). Turn up its a marketing gimmick to get people into the trap. Poor communication & marketing.

Buffet line basically not as good as mentioned in the menu. Choices are limited. Dessert taste meh.

Their famous laksa with mini lobster was tasteless with just spicy taste, no salt, no sweetness from the coconut cream. Me and my friend who had the laksa both of us got bad diarrhea and vomited few hours after the dinner.

Will not recommend them."
Lime Restaurant,The food here is of very high standard and it taste really nice. And not forgetting Eileen Soo who was truly amazing in her customer service. It has been a long time since I had such wonderful customer service experience in a restaurant. I don't know what her position is but I think she deserve a promotion for her outstanding attitude towards customers. Two thumbs up!
Lime Resturant,Food and drinks were very enjoyable and reasonably priced . Service was good . The bar staff were awesome
Unimpressed experience,"Went to the restaurant for CNY eve dinner. Reservation and entry was smooth. Area is spacious and staff are polite and friendly.
However service becomes disappointing because the plates are not cleared after finished. No service staff are around to be called. Took a while to come even when we ordered online to ask for clear plates. We even have to bring our own dirty plates to their counter/trolley to clear space.
Food wise is also so-so. There are only cold station, hot station for western and Asian food. However most of the food are salty on palate. However dessert station is more appetising. Online menu doesn’t offer alcoholic beverages and service staff are nowhere to be seen to ask about ordering alcoholic drinks. And when finally ordered, had my glass of Prosecco.. got a shock to see the bill that I had been charged a bottle instead. But thankfully the cashier crew were quick to rectify this misunderstanding."
Lime Restaurant,"Very disappointed with the buffet spread, absolutely not value for money even with the 20% credit card promotion."
Buffet breakfast at Lime,"Limes serves a good breakfast spread, which includes breads, cereals, asian, fruit and yogurt. It is not the biggest spread around but quality is high. The nasi lemak with fried chicken is the best I have ever had in a long time. Ambience is very nice and service is prompt and polite."
A so-so high tea experience...,"I was disappointed with the high tea menu of Lime. For one, of all the high tea experiences I had, Lime had the least number of variety of pastries served. Lime only had 10 kinds, excluding the scones. I wouldn't have minded if it's just 10 kinds of pastries if the taste was exceptional but no... the pastries were just so-so, nothing fantastic. One good thing that I'm looking for in my high tea experience is to be surprised with what kind of treats will be served and if the taste would be exceptional... sadly, Lime didn't have deliver or probably I expected too much... ☹"
Dinner at Lime,Very happy with the service and attention to the customers needs. The staff Eileen Soo is extremely friendly. We have a great experience at the restaurant
Brilliant service and amazing foods recommended,"Service was amazing. Well done team. Special thanks to Eileen Soo for making birthday surprise for my friend. He felt so happy!

Apart from that, the Executive Sous Chef did a great job. He recommended the laksa which I was not thinking to have it. And that taste has had made my day."
Delicious food made special by lovely customer service,"Attended midweek to celebrate my husband's birthday, turned up early (630pm) so no queue at all to get served. Food selection was great, good selection for both adults and 2 children. We mainly ate from the japanese, western and desserts selection. The waitresses came to say hello to the children as well, even though they it was getting quite busy after that, and you could see them all rushing around to try and serve the customers."
A number of tasteless dishes,"Surprisingly, quite a number of dishes were very under seasoned. The salad barely had any sauce, baked salmon had no taste, Peranakan prawns weren’t fresh (the flesh was chalky), achar and seasoned veg had little to no taste. Pretty disappointed, as they were food that my mum like and she did not enjoyed. Other dishes like the sashimi, the roasted pork, sirloin steak and laksa, durian pengat were decent. Overall, for the price it’s not worth the visit."
21/11 visit.,"Very friendly service staff. Can see everyone working really hard, even the chefs trying their best to give us the best experience they can give. Thank you for feeding me."
Excellent service made the food taste that much better,"Visited Lime for dinner as part of a birthday staycation at Pickering. The food options though not varied, were all of high quality. What really shined was the excellent service by the incredibly friendly and professional staff, notably Eileen and Liqiong.

This is especially true for the dessert section, the Durian Pengat and Basque Burnt Cheesecake were heavenly. If one were to visit, the ice creams are certainly not to be missed, Vanilla Ice cream tasted like it’s made with real vanilla, and the light brown colour seem to back that guess up. Coconut Lime Sorbet was luscious, with 0 ice crystals, a rarity where sorbets are concerned; Gula Melaka Ice cream was excellent too.

Food aside, what really impressed me was the extremely high quality of service and generosity of the restaurant. The buffet is in an actual buffet format where you point at what you want and the chef will plate your food for you. That’s right, they actually went the extra mile to plate the food like as if you were ordering ALC. Furthermore, the restaurant was also incredibly generous with their portion, my family love prawns and the Chef at the seafood station served us a HUGE plate full of delicious and fresh prawns after finding out. The older lady at the Peranakan section was also extremely friendly, giving us fantastic food recommendations that did not disappoint.

Lastly to the star of the night, Liqiong and Eileen, they were frankly two of the most service oriented staff I’ve encountered, it was such a pleasure having them serve us. For instance, they were constantly making sure that we were having a great time, and offering desserts and making sure we are are extremely satisfied. They noticed that we had lots to eat and again proactively offered some Hot tea to cleanse our palates for another round of sweet goodness! Props to these two rockstars.

If there’s one criticism I have to give, it’s that some of the food were quite cold, specifically the slow roasted beef. The lobster was also quite over cooked and slightly rubbery. That might be things to watch out for, but other than that it was an excellent dinner.

The restaurant also gave us a surprise birthday cake upon hearing that it was my birthday. Thank you Lime for the excellent experience and I look forward to more exceptional gastronomical adventures with you guys."
Anniversary celebration,"We checked in at Park Royal at Pickering for anniversary celebration. The checkin comes with free breakfast buffet. To maximize our staycation, we also tried the international dinner buffet and we were glad that we did. The buffet was the typical pre-pandemic setup, where you can head over to the food table and pick what you want. But as a safety measure, you will inform the Chef on what dish you want and they will load the plates. There were a lot of food choices and my most favorite was the mashed potato. That was the most delicious mashed potato version I have tried. The buffet comes with free flowing drinks such as orange juice, coffee or tea. The desserts have limited cake options but was compensated by the really nice tasting basque burnt cheesecake. Since it was our anniversary, we were given a complimentary lobster dish . Really grateful for that. Staff are all friendly, nice and approachable. We love the ambience of the restaurant. The buffet breakfast is nice as well, with lots of options to choose from. We enjoyed our experience."
Good ambiance yet unworthy,"Service is good, the staff were friendly and helpful but the food is dry, no taste, I mean everything the food shouldn’t be..I feel like food in the hawkers is way better than the food in this Restaurant. Tasteless. I cannot name one except for the bread for tomatoe soup that is nice or worthy of your penny. Really disappointing food.."
Lime Restaurant has great ambience and service for buffet lunch,"We are at Lime Restaurant for international buffet lunch. Ambience is good, the service is very good,
Each diner is srrved with a bottle of water and glass. This is more hygienic. The waitress noticed we have not order drinks after we are seated for a while and adviced on how to use the QR code to order drinks.
The variety of the food is just nice for 2 hours setting for us. Food quality is generally good except some items is a bit salty. Beef is roasted just right, pinkish on the inside. Dessert is great especially the Yuzu meringue.
When they heard that we are there for birthday celebration, they served us a dessert with a candle. Great service."
Buffet dinner,"Buffet dinner with family. Variety of food and flavours. Tried their famous lobster laksa and durian cream dessert. Snow crab was not so tasteful together with the roasted beef. The lamb chops were good. As well as the salmon and sushi.
Staff were attentive and friendly. As it was my daughter’s birthday they offered a small cake with candle for us. The tables were set apart more than a meter and number of dinners were also well within control. Overall food was good especially the desserts."
Good buffet lunch First meal,"Good buffet lunch
First meal of the day n staycation.
First Buffet in months- Japanese, roasted meats, salad, soup, noodles n cooked dishes. Free drinks, coffee or tea, fruits n cakes for desserts. Value for money for hotel guests. Good served hot. Crowded even on a Friday."
Excellent Service!,"My wife and I enjoyed a buffet lunch on the afternoon of 4 Sep at Lime Restaurant. The food was excellent, but the service really set it apart. I would like to specially mention the manager on duty at that time (wearing a grey suit) who was very kind and attentive, and offered all the patrons excellent service.

I found the food offerings to be extensive and diverse, and especially enjoyed the desserts. Staff also took precautions when serving, and they all wore masks and latex gloves.

I will patronise again."
Good service,Food is good and there are quite a variety of selection. Staff (Falini and Eileen) are efficient in serving and clearing of tables. Friendly and polite too. Thank you!
Lunch at the Lime,"Fantastic food and even better service! Thanks for a memorable Birthday Lunch!

Special thanks to Amy from the banquet crew for the friendly service! And Dervyn Chew for always going the extra mile! Will definitely be back!"
Wonderful hotel cafe,Wonderful hotel cafe with buffet and ala carte menu. Good service and good quality including nice ambience too. Suitable for business and friends gathering.
High Tea on 26/8/21,"First and foremost, deepest gratitude to the staff, Fahlini, for the outstanding and prompt service.
Ambience was pleasant and soothing.
Lastly, food was scrumptious and appealing.

My first dine- in and definitely not the last!"
Great time at Lime,"Went to Lime for their dinner buffet and had a great time. Checking in to the restaurant was fast and efficient with assistance from Yus. The food was very good, particularly the lobster laksa, fresh oysters and lime cake. The service was even better. The chefs (Alfirin, Alex, Sarhi) were very accommodating of our questions and food requests. Other staff (Ryan, Fal, Wan, Aisa) were friendly and patient with our questions. Also thankful to Eileen, Wei Feng and another staff (Clint or Chit) for keeping our table cleared of the used dishes. Wonderful experience overall."
Dining at Lime,Dined at Lime and food was great and service was even better. We were served by Amy making our dining experience a great one. Would recommend visits to this restaurant when you are staying or visiting nearby. Service has been great. Will definitely come back.
Great buffet for couples,"Lime offers an incredible array of food options, even vegan too, along with wine and desserts. Incredibly welcoming staff who are accommodating to random requests (we had to ask for tools to eat the crabs). Overall a great place for couples and dates and would highly recommend."
Credit Card dinner promotions,"We were disappointed with our buffet dinner within such a nice hotel. The food menu was limited. However, we still managed with a few better ones. Lobster laksa, roasted pork and durian penget were acceptable. End of the day, it was not valued for money."
Friendly place,"Cause of the new COVID-19 restrictions, I didn’t understand how to go about ordering in the buffet. But thankfully the chefs were really kind and patient with us."
Fantastic Buffet,"Great ambience with friendly staff, this restaurant also serve very good buffet where you can go and chose the pick up the items. Only thing is the server will help you pick, but most places after COVID has gone for a la carte. The raw station serves mussels and sashimi. There are also local delights with the famous Laksa, Satay and Rojak. I love the dessert station which featured many delectable local favs and English cakes."
You have to go back for seconds (& thirds)!,"Went with family of 5 on eve of Mother’s Day. Restaurant setting did not seem to have changed since the last time I visited a few years ago for the CNY Reunion lunch. Really enjoyed the food back then as they had items that were not available in some other buffets during the season.
There were 4 stations- the seafood on ice (very limited selection); the western (very limited selection); the Asian (very limited selection); & the dessert station (very limited selection). And because the selections were so limited, we had to go back for seconds & thirds not because of how great the food was, but because we were still hungry.
We already almost had 75% of whatever the restaurant was serving half an hour into dining, & the rest of the time was filled up with conversations around where we should have gone to, & how great the food at those other places were.
Service was crappy too, despite the restaurant being less than half occupied.
I made a cup of instant noodles after I went home & that cup of noodles was surprisingly more satisfying!"
Food selection very limited.,"Went with family to Lime Restaurant on 24 Apr 2021 for buffet dinner. Selection is really limited. Laksa was very good. Some meat was really very raw. There is no choice given - as to whether we want well done, medium rare, etc. We chose to go on Sat as we thought the famous Bak Chor Mee etc would be there. But last minute, they were taken off their website. Not worth the price."
Weekend buffet lunch,"Finally we are back to the buffet line where we can see the food instead! Some items like soup, salads, desserts, beef rendang and prata are still ordered off a menu. The rest like sashimi, chilled seafood, bbq, noodles, rojak, etc are self helped. There are only 2 Q, one for the chilled items, the other for hot, so diners thought they can just go straight to the noodle station, then it creates a bit of friction between people in the Q - would be good if wait staff gave a bit of explanation at the beginning when they bring diners to their table. We have never been to Lime b4 so although spread is not alot, we feel it is enough. You can have laksa, beef noodles, mee soto from the noodle station. Enjoyed the Grilled salmon, laksa, rojak, satay and sashimi. Durian green bean soup is weird but rest of desserts are good. We also loved the decor of the place. I guess we just miss the old buffets.
Standard coffee/tea is included in buffet but I wonder why is it not under the beverage tab on the online menu for easy ordering?"
Extremely disappointing.,"Was on a staycay (7-9 April 2021) at the hotel for the birthday of my wife and zero of the dishes we tried we're good and worth the price they charge. Standard dropped significantly compared to just a few years ago. Which the recent reviews seem to support.

1. Hygiene: Chefs were playing with their phone regularly even when wearing gloves, which totally defeats the purpose of wearing them. So hygiene wise less than 1 star if I was able to.
Wonder what NEA would say of these standards.

2. Meat (Beef, lamb and pork belly) was super dry most likely because they prepare way too much in advance while the restaurant is not yet busy enough at 7pm, not enough volume makes the dishes just sit there, even the pork belly was completely cooked dry.

None of the other dishes stood out. Less choice since the pandemic and lower quality basically.
Calamari were tasteless and instead of tartare they served it with low quality mayo.
Veg dishes can be found better at a cheap cai fan place and the seafood wasn't great either sadly.

Only the dessert station was decent, which was recommended by a great waitress after raising the issue with her of the food standard having dropped so much. So credit to her for the good customer service recovery attempt.
She admitted that similar complaints are more frequent nowadays, really sad to hear.

I received quite some empathy from the waitress when bringing up the standard dropped considerably, however we still ended up paying close to $100 pp for a mediocre buffet (house pours included).

Just received a standard reply from the manager on my Google review. Pathetic, so definitely not coming back to Park Royal and Lime or recommending the hotel in general for that matter, which I've done in the past."
Terrible,"Absolutely overpriced and not worth it at all. Variety is terrible, and quality is nothing worth raving either. Was celebrating my mother's birthday and this dinner absolutely crapped out. Will never visit again."
Cold food and not fresh,Food was served very cold and not fresh. The choices of food are very limited for dinner menu. Very disappointed dinner for an not so cheap price. Need a lot of improvement.
Worst high tea ever,"Lime restaurant used to be my first choice when it comes to high tea. To my dismay , the standard had dropped significantly in terms of food and the friendliness of the staff when we visited the restaurant on 17th March 2021. We were not allowed to enter the restaurant till 3pm and nobody informed us and we stood at the restaurant reception at 245pm stupidly and nobody attended to us.

The 3 tier afternoon tea definitely does not justify the price that we are paying for. It's so bad that me and my friend did not finish the food.

Dear Lime restaurant, please train your staff to be more attentive and dont let your guest standing in front of the restaurant. This is very rude and not acceptable. Thanks!"
Poor selection,Was a regular patron for this restaurant. Haven’t been there since a year ago but standard of food definitely dropped a lot. Very less selection for Sunday brunch and not worth for the $88 ++. Food was served cold and doesn’t look appealing at all.
"Excellent food, excellent service","Due to Covid19 restrictions, buffet isn’t what it used to be. Gone were the days when we can just pick what we like and go for unlimited serving of the food we like without troubling others.

At Lime, they have upgraded their system to ordering via mobile phone instead of writing on a piece of small order chit (they provide 4 copies previously) and you will feel Paisay to request for more.

Kudos to the waiter & waitress for being patient to us for repeating our orders and they always serve with a smile on their faces. I’ve been to other ala carte buffets whereby the servers will pretend not to receive your orders and will not walk pass you after a few rounds of orders.

Food is excellent and I would attest to say Lime is 1 of the best hotel ala carte buffet in Singapore. The mini steak n lamb chop are excellent and so are the Asian dishes. The fried rice can improve with a little more flavor but I’m not complaining, it’s just nice if you have kids.

I would like to commend on your waitress by the name of Mei Chuan. She was very attentive when she was clearing empty plates on my table and to my surprise she even ask if the food were alright for my children and offered recommendations on what would parents with children usually order. She’s a delight and she greets all other guest with a smile. Will also be good for Lime to include children friendly menu :)

Overall, I enjoyed dining at Lime and will recommend to all my friends. One of the best hotel buffet with excellent happy service staffs!"
Good breakfast,Had a breakfast which was very good. They arranged vegan food for us. There were some hiccups in service but Mr. Vincent and Ms. Aesa were very helpful and gave us a wonderful service. Highly recommended.
Friendly service and food spans across a variety of different dietary requirements,"Lime is the main restaurant of this hotel. I tried the crab balls ( plant based). Although it was meant to be an appetiser, the dish was enough for me as a main. It came in 8 small pieces with a wasabi mayonnaise at the side. Staff, Aesa was attentive and friendly"
Lime Restaurant,"Both morning and evening staff are warm and friendly. Although restaurant is not halal certified, their malay staff are quick enough to identify muslim visitors and advise them that the meat are from halal sources. Really appreciate their good gesture. Their lobster laksa and durian pengat will make us come back for more
Thks to Vita Wan and Amy for making our dining at Lime very comfortable."
Variety are limited,The oyster and seafood are very fresh but the variety of food are quite limited for the price paid. Not worth $99+++
7.30,"The food is tasty, especially lobster laksa & friendly staff. There is no regret to visit. The place is comfortable."
The Lime Restaurant,"Food served here are great! Restaurant staff and Services are excellent! Highly recommended! First time trying to dine in this restaurant and it was an amazing experience. Very fast delivery of food requested to be served , thank you"
Lunch getaway,"I brought my husband here for his birthday lunch. Ambience is great n food is super delicious. Whats more their service is fantastic. Staff so attentive to each and every detail. When i casually told staff Vita its my husband's bday, she surprised with a slice of cake with a candle. Super delighted. Will definitely come again for its wonderful cuisine n service. N not to forget the durian penget. Thumbs up."
Great service but food was disappointing,"Service was great and food was served promptly. However last order for Festive CNY Dinner Buffet was only till 9pm. Beef was tough and slightly cold, desserts selection was pathetic if you are looking forward to it. Only mini tarts and bite sized cakes were offered, felt like I was at Taka's Basement sampling session. Free Yu Sheng for every 5 pax dining and I must say it was the highlight of the meal. Overall, it was not worth the money at all ."
Standard dropped due to Covid restriction- Lime restaurant ?,"Went for business a la carte buffet dinner over Christmas 2020 at Lime restaurant. Booking was difficult over phone, no one picks up call. Operator took my reservation with no return confirmation on day of dinner, a usual practice. Parking is free for first 2 hours only. Ushered to table but without menu which staff took hurriedly cannibilised from another table. Food was mediocre standard, dropped from previous 2X visit- due to Covid restriction ? . Under-staffed so needed to wait to order, each time. For the price paid , better moved to other dining. End of future visits."
Service with a Smile at Lime,"I've been to a lot of Hotel Buffet Restaurants here in SG and I love giving good revuews esp if I really loved the service given by the staff. Sometimes what's important for me is the service then next is the food coz it's hard nowadays to find friendly staff esp in Food or Hotel Industry. But with Lime Resto I was truly amazed by the service given to us by Ms. Cathy of Lime Resto. She was super friendly and willing to take our pics and even gave me complimentary slice of cake! She was always have this ""Service with a Smile"" and very fast to give our requests! Please give some credits to this lovely lady as she really is doing her job well! We can't find people like her nowadays. I will be back for sure if u have staff like Cathy! By the way, shoutout also to Aesia or aeisha a pretty Filipina Lady who first helped us to take our orders, she is really accomodating & always smiling even with mask on :) she is super nice to our group also and always suggesting nice food which we can try. Thanks again to Lime Resto! Keep it up! Dinner buffet was superb my friends loves it! Esp the steak very tender and juicy and surprised that juices and softdrinks coffee tea included already as some hotels got extra charges although surprised thay oysters got additional
charge. Anyways, overall we will recommend the resto to our friends bec of the quality service provided to us! Keep it up guys! Thanks again Cheerful Charming Cathy!"
Impressive High Tea,"Excellent service by Vita, pleasantly surprised by the spread and felt very full even after the supposed small quantity of food associated with high tea, free flow of coffee and tea is great as well, highly recommended"
Satisfactory Buffet~,"It was weekend and we came by for the buffet lunch, which was now being converted to ala carte style due to Covid19 as social distancing policy is implemented.

The restaurant has a nice and cosy ambience with high ceiling and nice decors around. And surprisingly, the restaurant was almost full-house.

The lunch buffet actually started at 12.30pm (instead of 12.00pm when most restaurants do so) and we were ushered to our table by the friendly staff.

Menu and ordering of food was via scanning of QR code which we had encountered difficulties in which the staff came to and fro to fix the problem but was eventually resolved after the 3rd attempt (he was saying the network/server was down). Afterwhich, ordering was smooth.

Well, to be honest, the spread of the buffet was not great as we had expected, in fact, much lesser than it's counterpart at Ginger and Spice Brasserie which we recently visited. If I didn't remember wrongly, there were 5 main categories of food (like starters, seafood/cold, local flavours, western delights and pastries) and under each category, there were only about 4~5 dishes. So it's a little disappointing.

Having said that, the food were generally nice and yummy and generally there were no complains except a few suggestions to help them improve. For example, there was only chicken satay, which they can include mutton or beef too. There was only laksa and what if some diners cannot/dont like to eat spicy food, so good to include one other kind of noodles or say, fried rice. May can also include some street food like rojak (or salad and bread), popiah etc.

But the pastries were super nice and good! The cakes and ice creams and how perfect it would be if there's waffles to go along with it. Coffee and tea and orange juice were inclusive in the buffet, along with fresh cut fruits.

Service was prompt and staff were generally efficient in clearing plates.

Value for money. The quality of food was fine but as mentioned earlier, the spread was quite small and that made this factor, a little tough, not too worth it (since at about the same price or even cheaper, you can have much more choices of food and I am comparing it with it's own counterparts and not other restaurants which we went to recently too). If a few more dishes are to be included, it would be better.

Overall, we did enjoy our lunch here but unless they improve in this food spread (or if they have special promotions like 1-for-1), we would prefer to return to the other 2 Parkroyal restaurants and other restaurants we went. (do check them out in my earlier reviews)"
Wonderful and enjoyable lunch at the Lime Restaurant,"Had a wonderful a la carte lunch buffet at the Lime restaurant. Due to covid, we are unable to take the food ourselves. However, all the food was served quickly upon ordering via QR code. The sashimi is super fresh till I requested for a second plate. The roasted pork is crispy and not too oily . The food are all serve hot especially in the cold weather nowadays. The dessert is so appealing and yummy. Highly recommended the Durian Pengat. The smooth and creamy texture make us feel like having more but we are too full for that haha.

Last but not least , the stuffs over there are all very friendly. I would like to comment on Vita, Falini and Amy. Vita whom greeted us when we first stepped into the restaurant. Follow by asking what we want to drink so she can prepare while we ordering the food. Thanks Kak Falini that helps me to take more wasabi for my sashimi. I know the station is very far.

Overall the experience is excellent with good atmosphere. Would definitely come again !!"
Dinner time 😊,"週末帶老爺去5星級酒店吃好料，佢睇落好緊張
應該多點帶佢出來吃吃喝喝玩玩
Excellent place to hang out with family for dinner time.. The section is good, super ambience.. The staffs are very attentive. The place very clean with ensure we have the safety distances between tables even we are still in phase III period in Singapore..
Spacious truly a 5-stars dining experience.."
Disappointing buffet breakfast,"TLDR: limited selection and long wait for ala carte breakfast only to be served with sub par food

We had an à la cart breakfast at LINE restaurant on 4 January 2021. The food was sub par and the service was very slow and terrible.

There were two timings for the breakfast. One is from 730 to 9, and then at 9 to 10:30 am. We had to order the breakfast to our assigned table using a QR code, due to the current covid restrictions. The food items were quite limited, such as the bacon-hash brown-chicken sausage with scrambled eggs set, another set’s version with sunny side up eggs, pancakes set, omelette (vegetarian) set, fried beehoon with chicken wings, and congee set. The black coffee with milk, and black tea with milk were considered separate items during the order.

We were seated at our table at 9:40am, and ordered at 9:50am. We had the beehoon, omelette, bacon and sunny side up, and black coffee. We were waiting for some time, that one of the servers asked us if we placed our orders and that we can order more since service stops at 10:30. We said yes, and mentioned we wanted to see how the food was before ordering more. By then, we also requested orange juice, a few pastries and sliced fruits since it was taking a while.

By 10:05, still no food came. We ordered a set of pancakes. To our surprise, this arrived in about 5mins. But the other items haven’t been served. By 10:15, we opted to order more since it’s really taking a while.

It wasn’t until 10:20 when I had to call the attention of another server, that we’ve been waiting for 30mins with only 1 item served.

A couple mins later, the items arrived and it was such poor quality. The chicken sausage was cold. The bacon was crispy, but also cold. The omelette was quite warm, likely just cooked, but bland. The congee was also bland, and one bowl was with salted fish and the other bowl with just light soya sauce. The noodles were also bland. The saving grace? The chicken wings, and pancakes albeit slightly chewy instead of fluffy.

I honestly don’t mind waiting for food, especially if the quality is great. But to be served with cold food items after waiting for a while — that quite unacceptable. The quality and standard were quite sub-par. The food items that were served were also incomplete, and we had to follow-up a few times.

Overall, I was expecting a lot given this was highly rated restaurant. Will I go back? Probably to try other meal timings like lunch. But will I recommend to opt for the breakfast option when booking your stay? Probably not."
Extremely Disappointing Hi-Tea,"We came here for the Hi-Tea, but was not informed at all during the booking or when we sat down that they were serving a different menu for its Hi-Tea. When I enquired with the staff, I was then told that this was their festive menu, and it tasted really horrible. Extremely disappointing."
Lime @ Park Royal Pickering on 22 Dec 2020,"Went there for lunch, still prefer that we go get our preferred food selection.

Due to Covid and social distancing, we had to be served. It was a ""Festive"" theme but was not a very good one that I expected, reasons:

1. Food took a long time to be served, and some items we ordered were forgotten
2. Menu items like roasted pork, duck and chicken came served cold. Not even warm or hot.
3. Very limited selection of food and beverages. But claypot laksa was hot and good.

Basically we waited a long time for food to be served (around 20 minutes wait) and this does not include our forgotten order,

Personally I don't think it was a good and worthwhile meal. For such a festive price, indeed very pricey.

I feedback to the staff Mr Yuus, but he sounded quite defensive so....(No point and doubt will still return)"
First time visit to parkroyal Pickering,"First time visit to parkroyal Pickering that I stay 1 night in the hotel.

I feel amazing when I step into the hotel room as it has a cosy and warm feel

The dinner in the lime restaurant was great as the creme Brûlée was great and the log cake was great as well

The nature garden is so windy and feeling relax when I was there"
CHRISTMAS DAY LUNCH RUINED!!!,"To start,let me just share our experience at your Lime Restaurant. From the Cashier till we have the table assigned, we didn't even heard any of your staff greeted us. We placed our first order we actually enjoyed it, after we placed the sec6roynd, this is where the bad ser we experienced. Vita, your Filipino staff took our order list,and informed her that we didn't received our Roasted Meat, she gave us but with a rude service. I know you guys are into rush and trying everyone to serve all your guest. We were shocked when she placed the Roasted Meat on to our table without realising that it's kind of rude with a loud noise and almost dropped onto the floor. She ignored what had happened. We realised that our orders taking long for us to be serve. It's mostly like 25-30 minutes hence the restof the table especially the one beside the glass wall keep placing their orders and being serve fast as well. How about ours? Our second round when it is coming? Until I approached Vita (not sure if I get her name correctly), and sha said that it is already been keyed-in the system. But how long to be serve? The person in a Reindeer Costume named YUS, I believed he was the Restaurant Manager approached me. Yes he did, but he didn't take any immediate actions from the first time I approached and keep ignoring us. Even one of your Malay Staff told us ""if you want to make a complaint, go ahead"" and also saying that it depends on the Chef which dish to serve first.Fid he just said that to us?. What is this service of him? Until we really fed up and lost our appetite not to eat anymore whereas one by one of our ordered food serving us already but we already no appetite to eat.When YUS ( Restaurant Manager) came to our table and I asked himif he the Restaurant Manager and he said yes, he keep on apologising of the bad experience we had but its already been ruined. He then giving us an action to our bad experience which I think we deserved it as we did not enjoy our meals at all. Were not really sure if we are the only one experienced this but we don't deserved to be treated like this. We are also your guest but it seems we were the unlucky ones not given a proper treatment as a guest. Seems everyone is enjoying their meals but here we are waited a long period of time until we lost our appetite. We ordered the 3rd round ( but the 2nd round not even complete yet), and one by one being serve fast? What is this, is this a joke? Give complaint from us to be serve fast? I'm sorry but this is however were treated and this what we felt during our visit to your Lime Restaurant. It is supposed to be a Christmas Lunch fruitful but end up become Hungry and Angry more."
Festive buffet,"Was there this afternoon for the festive buffet and it was terrible! Food choices was very small, the portions even smaller and they all came cold. Ordered the satay and waited an hour for the 4 sticks to reach our table; they weren’t even cooked properly. Found fish scales on my hacked up pieces of sashimi fish and when we asked for more Kikkoman as the amount served was so little, we waited another 30mins. The restaurant was terribly under staffed so service was slow; I feel sorry for the service staff as we can see they are trying to get service done fast - it’s the system or lack of it that’s making a failure of this buffet event.
Save your $$ and time - don’t eat there!
Enclosed is a pic of the “Seafood Platter for 2” served to us, and beside it is the Sashimi Platter."
Lime Breakfast,"Had breakfast there as part of staycation. All the staff are polite and attentive especially Amy. The food was good, especially the Carrot Cake. Service was also pretty fast. The pastries came warmed. Even the plate was warmed. That impressed us."
What a mess,"Make earlier request via email to Twinkle Sta Monica
Senior Team Leader. Nothing was done though i was told a cake will be given for anniversary celebration.

Roasted meat set was cold n meat left on counter too long.

Wok fried broccoli with garlic & oyster sauce tasted nothing of the sort. More like steamed.

Heng kee curry chicken noodles tasted nothing like the stall at hong lim. Signature laksa was bland & tasteless.

Deserts were mediocre. Not fantastic.

Service was atrocious. U could wait anything between 1/2 an hr to 45 mins for one order to be served.

Waiters all over the place. One waiter delivered the same dishes 3 times. And 2 times delivered our order to the table beside us instead.

Lucky there was 1 plump macik who tried her best to make things right. Other than that, the price did not justify for the service & food paid.

And for goodness sake the Rudolph cos play by the manager in charge, don’t u think it was too late to start barking orders at ur subordinates when u realise a few tables are not getting correct orders n having other tables orders served to another table??

Empty plates for 30-45 mins before the waiter came over told us our slip was lost. 1.03pm pass slip, 1.42pm waiter retook lost order, revised order came at 1.45pm

Wont be coming back to this half baked standard restaurant."
Very bad experience at the,"Very bad experience at the Lime restaurant yesterday. We went w a group of 4 of us. When my friend arrived, the staff can’t find our reservations and was hold on at the counter for 10mins to look for our reservations when we had our reservations made few weeks back. We were practically rush through our meal as they need to rush us out by 2.15 pm cos they need to turn over for hi tea. Totally understand that constrict. And we were asked to place our order first for dessert when we were still have our mains. Our order was missed out many items and was told they lost the paper. Our order for tea for 4 persons came 2 to 3 x when we told the server that you guys had already serviced us , his reply is oh is okay and just placed on our table when we are already no space for food!! When we asked for our desert cos they missed out again. Asked for feedback form, unprofessionally told us sorry we don’t have you want you can go website. Oh dear a 5 stars service not even want to find out more .
. Honestly for the price we paid for we don’t expect such service and the menu choices was not a lot too. The beef was so so not tender the lamb wasn’t hArd . Turkey was dry so I wouldn’t even recommend to go for the buffet. We don’t enjoy our lunch and it’s supposed to be a birthday treat and Xmas celebration for us. Sadly, The standard has dropped substantially when the first time I went a year ago for their lobster buffet."
Lime's great tasting buffet,"It was tough getting a reservation at this restaurant which has been gaining popularity lately. I enjoyed a staycation and enjoyed the restaurant dining experience on the day I checked out as I could not get a spot for the day of my staycation. The food is very good and the serving size is good. I enjoyed the lobster laksa, the roast meat dish was good too. The Turkey was not that great. The veggie was great tasting broccoli and it was served piping hot. The lamb was good too.
The desert that was great tasting was their coconut kafir lime ice cream and the gula Melaka ice cream.
I would definitely recommend this restaurant as not only was the food good but their service too was very good."
Breakfast Menu,"The breakfast menu is nice, do try their carrot cake, chocolate muffin and definitely chicken wing!

Big shoutout to the staff especially Jason :)"
Buffet selection for festive menu was too little,"Due to covid we can’t pick the food we want, but we need to order thru menu form, service was pretty fast just not much selection

Staff fie was very attentive and keep asking if we need anything. Glazed ham was good and the chicken satay was superb wish they could have more variety and selection."
