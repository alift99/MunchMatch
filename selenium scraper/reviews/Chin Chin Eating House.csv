Above Average Chicken Rice,"Arrived around 6:40pm, the restaurant is already full. Managed to get a seat after waiting for 15 minutes. I ordered the steamed chicken and bitter gourd soup. The chicken is juicy and succulent, however the rice still have room for improvement. Overall it is an above average standard for the food and average for the environment!"
Tasty Chcken Rice At Reasonable Prices,"I had not been back here to dine for many years, so was happy that my sister and her husband suggested lunch here. It can get crowded at main meal times. Technically, they open at 11am, but are open earlier for coffee or tea etc.

The roast and steamed chicken rice are still tasty, and good value at @$5. We also ordered prawn paste chicken, pork chop and the Hainanese signature vegetables. The prawn paste chicken was okay. We wished the pork chop was crispier - it was pretty obvious these were pre fried, and the potato and peas were also tad cold, as was the sauce. The vegetables were like the nonya chap chye, but with a stronger taste of dried shrimp.

Prices were reasonable, and a meal for four came to $60."
Rude staff.,"Was yelled at by one of the staff, asking me to get out when I was actually instructed by another staff to get seated."
Good food but spoiled by terrible service,"Been patronizing their stall for a long time during lunch hours due to their good chicken rice, but their service has deteriorated to non-existent.
The lady serving our table was very impatient, to the extent that we were chased out the moment we finished eating. Our group had varied eating speed, so the lady was already eyeing our table for a while when some of us were done. The exact moment our last friend finished, the lady came over to tell us not to occupy the table with the most unfriendly look.
Asking where to make payment was also apparently a wrong question to ask as the angry lady replied, ""Can't you see the sign?""
Well, I understand that it's the lunch crowd but that attitude isn't something I'd give to a stranger, much less a customer.
Also, it's near impossible to hear much there due to ambience noise so it's not a place for chit-chat.
I'm there for lunch and not to be a punching bag so I don't foresee myself going back again regardless of the food."
The best Hainanese chicken rice in Singapore,"I have always visited this restaurant in town when I visit the National Library which is near Purvis St. This old Chinese restaurant serves the best. sambal kangkong, pork chop, Hainanese chicken rice and aromatic aloe vera drinks. The quality is good and the price is reasonable. The waiting time is about 10 min during the peak hours and this place is good for lunch and dinner. Located just about 100m from Raffles Hotel this restaurant attracts locals and tourists from far and near. When my friends from overseas visit me I would bring them to this restaurant because the best chicken rice is found here."
Good homey food at reasonable price,"Went for lunch at Chin Chin after a long time - partly due to the reduce social interaction measures during this covid19 period. Food was as good as before. We have good appetites, so the 5 of us shared 1 entire chicken, fried prawns, pork ribs with bittergourd, fish slice with black bean sauce, hotplate beancurd, hainan mix vegetables, and prawn roll — all for a very decent price of just about S$100! Definitely a safe place to go to for lunch or dinner - it is not michelin star fine dining. But you will not be disappointed by the home-style food."
Quick Lunchtime visit,"Popped in after Purvis Street being recommended for some good restaurants. Cafe style, rapid service. Wasnt hugely hungry so arder a $5 bowl of noodles in soup with greens, mean and prawn, I forget the dishes name but it was one of the cheapest things on the menu. a drop of ginger paste from the condiments on the table and a bit of soy sauce worked well.

Finished the lot. $6 inc a bottle of mineral water. Delicious and just what I needed."
Chicken rice & soya beans,"Another tasty lunch at Chin Chin. Opted again for simplicity with just the chicken rice and the soya beans. Crowded and very busy as usual, but still the service manages to be efficient. Hopefully one day they will take payment forms other than just cash."
Moist and Tender Chicken,"The chicken here is absolutely delusions! It's so moist and juicy. If you want to try Hainanese Chicken Rice, this is the place to come!"
I always take visitors to Chin Chin,"Chicken Rice is a dish that many a few regions in China claim to have created this dish. Within Singapore, many restaurants claim to have the “Best” chicken Rice. While I have not eaten at every restaurant that serves chicken rice to know which deserves the bragging rights, there is one place that I have gone back again and again for its authentic and honest cooking: Chin Chin. Located on Purvis Street, this restaurant has been serving this famous dish since the 1930s. Stepping into this place transport you back to have it must have been when it opened. For starters, there is no air conditioning, just old fashion ceiling fans. Your order is taken by an “Auntie or Uncle” the old fashion way, on a piece of paper. When you pay your bill, there is no cash register, but slips of paper held by a clothespin marked with the number of the table. When you enter, your eyes are greeted with a dozen steamed and roasted chickens tempting you to select either. At around 11:00 am the restaurant is filled with local patrons of multi-generational families, gathering as if this was an extension of their home. If you want to experience a no-nonsense honest home-style chicken rice, come here. And whatever diet you may have do not pass on the chicken rice. There is some food worth getting fat on; this rice is one of them."
No frills eating house but tasty food,We had Hananese chicken rice & fried  beans. Casual place no frills where locals went and food was very tasty. Service was quick. Recommended by Intercontinental hotel staff. We enjoyed this place much more than the expensive Empress restaurant.
Classic delicious Chinese food..,"Classic delicious Chinese food.. Everything is fresh, tasty, fast and exactly as it should be to the point of being comfort food. You really can't go wrong choosing anything on the menu from the chicken rice to fried noodles to Chinese broccoli.."
Hainanese chicken rice and pork chop,"Really great tze char food. We tried the Hainanese chicken rice, hainanese pork chop and sweet potato leaves, and I'd recommend all of them! We paid around $22 for 2 pax - and it was very filling."
Excellent Chicken rice,"Perfect chicken rice Singapore style, fresh and tender chicken with local sauces, available steamed or roasted."
Great authentic food,"We were recommended to try this place by our grab driver as the best Hainanese Chicken and rice in the city. It was delicious.

The place was packed with locals always a great sign. This appears to be a real family business with everyone from the younger to the older generation helping out.

The lady who seated us was very helpful with the menu and we ordered a mutton clay pot, half Hainanese Chicken and oily rice, bok choy and beers and lime juice. All three of us really enjoyed it.

The food was tasty and fresh and our waitress even came and mixed up a dipping sauce from the pots on the table for us to try how she liked to eat it.

Our driver was right we had tried Hainanese Chicken at one of the hawkers but this was wonderfully delicious and so much better. It was juicy and flavoursome and so good. The entire meal for three was under S$45 and so worth it.

Even though english was limited, the staff were very friendly and welcoming and did all they could to make us feel at home. Such a great place to eat."
Delicious hainanese chicken,"Chicken rice is aplenty in Singapore. If you want good roast chicken and you are in the vicinity, try Chin Chin. $14 for half a chicken. Throw in some dishes and you can have a good meal for less than $50 for 5 persons.

I had half a chicken, a big plate of seafood fried rice, seafood hor fun and salted vegetable soup for $37, for five persons. Good find within the city."
Great value tasty food,Arrived from Perth and weary but this reataurant was near our hotel and was a great find. Kong Po chicken was wonderful and Singapore fried bee hoon noodles fantastic.
Back for more,"Another decent chicken rice and bean sprouts experience here recently. Very crowded at lunchtime, but fast service and good quality food. Worth revisiting."
Good choice for chicken rice,I've been back here twice in the last few months for chicken rice and bean sprouts. Both times the food was tasty and inexpensive. Probably explains why this place is always so crowded. On one of the visits I took along an international guest for an authentic local experience - he was also quite pleased. Worth another visit.
Great recommendation,"The local tour guide recommended Chin Chin’s at the end of our tour. She suggested the chicken and rice as a sample of the local foods.

When we stepped inside the restaurant a waitress motioned us to a table. She pointed out what we asked for on the menu and also suggested some Chinese broccoli. We asked for a half chicken to share.

When she brought the order, she showed us how to prepare a sauce dish with some of the sauces on the table.

The food was delicious.

Service was prompt, friendly and helpful."
Nice local cuisine,"After we had checked into Hotel 81 Bugis, we needed to grab a bite to eat. This was just round the corner and had decent reviews and pricing on Google, so we decided to check it out. We had a hot plate beef, noodle and chicken dishes and a big bottle of tiger. It was tasty and reasonably priced, though cash only."
Well worth the visit!,We stopped by for a late lunch after reading reviews to avoid the lunch crowd. Food was delicious and served quickly. Hainanese boiled chicken rice was well worth the recommendation to visit and all our other dishes (sizzling beef plates and seafood) we delicious as well. Reasonably priced and local charm this was a great place to eat!
superb Hainan cuisine,"busy spot with locals but got a table outside on footpath.... great Hainan food.... had the boiled chicken & chicken rice, sambal Kangkung (spinach) and singapore noodles. All were excellent .. the sambal kangkung is particularly hot if you like spice... easy when washed down with a Tiger lager...staff are run off their feet but maintain a friendly demeanour despite the duress. Feel sorry for the guys cooking at the front, it's gotta be hot work, they never stop
cost was $34 for the 3 meals and drinks. Big Tick"
Avoid The Lunch Crowd 12.00-1.30pm,"Although I rated very highly on the food and prices of this restaurant previously,
my recent visit taught me a valuable lesson...... never never go during 12.00-1.30pm on weekdays. The place is packed with office workers resulting in non existent service and rude staff. Diners are squeezed in tables and one gets the feeling that you should vacate once you are done eating.So to have a relaxing and enjoyable meal best avoid the “ mad rush “ hours"
Hainanese Food Paradise,"The Chin Chin Restaurant @ Purvis Street serves one of the best Hainanese cuisines in Singapore. It’s a place you must try if you have never tried Hainanese cook food before. Here’s the list of must-try Hainanese dishes; the traditional chicken rice, the Hainanese prawn roll, the mix vegetable, and the Hainanese pork chop (a must try.)

Beware, the restaurant is always full of people especially during the lunchtime and dinner hours. Just wait patiently if you have no seats. Though the food may not be Instagram worthy - but it’s taste worthy!"
Chin chin Famous Chicken Rice,"We are full and we are happy.

We were within walking distance of this traditional eating house and how lucky were we. Unfortunately I only have a photo my plate after the meal.

The locals showed us how to eat the Steamed Chicken Rice the ""right way"" and we were glad they did.

Highly recommend!"
Chicken Rice *****,"If you are a fan for chicken rice head to Chin Chin Eating House. This no frills and non air conditioned restaurant serves one of the best steam chicken in Singapore. The chicken is succulent and tasty. Besides the steam chicken other nice dishes include Hainanese pork chop,morning glory fried with blachan and crispy pork. Food portions are generous.This is one of the cheapest restaurants I have patronized whilst in Singapore.We ordered steamed chicken ( S$ 14 ) and 4 other dishes plus 2 big bottles of Tiger Beer and the bill came to S$ 58 for 4 of us. This is really good value for our money"
Chicken done right!,"Our first night in Singapore we ate here. 6 starving people, I immediately took control of the situation and ordered the food:

1/2 chicken - so soft and tender!
Char Kway Teow - flavorful
Brocolli - I don't understand how a vegetable could be that tasty
Yang Chow Fried Rice - hot and smoky
Fried Beancurd with Minced Pork - Soft tofu with salty savory meat, it was heaven
Sweet and Sour Pork - can't help but order this whenever I see it on a menu. It did not disappoint, tender meat and crisp vegetables."
Great food,"We have eaten at Chin Chin Eating House on two visits to Singapore and eaten well on both occasions. The food is tasty and good value, there's a friendly atmosphere and our waiter was great fun. Speedy service."
Juicy Chicken Rice,"After walking back from Brash Basah for setting some instrument, we realized it's makan time in the afternoon, no wonder we felt so hungry. We came to this place cos friend of mine brought us here.

At first we felt walkin to this area was quite new for both of us, lots of shop houses around that area and it's beautiful until my husband said that we already knew this place, it's just we came for the other aisle and we stopped at the thai food just opposite this place.

It's quite spacious. Basically like family restaurant which you can have your family and colleage here to have makan Chinese food together.

We ordered half chicken, mixed vegetable, and beef black pepper with fresh thai botak coconut.

I'm amazed with the taste. It's nice, tender and juicy as what our friend said and recommended us, that's why she brought us here. Their portion was pretty generous, cos we thought the half chicken was already whole chicken. Haha...

Their vegetable just as per normal Chinese cuisine, fresh and tasty! My husband okay with the beef but for me our order was too much and I was already happy with the chicken and vegetable. The beef was okay tho, it's tender but it's not as thin as I expected, a bit crumpled. I love the thin slices beef not the crumpled hehe...

Thai botak coconut was refreshing!!! Price for all almost $50 if I'm not mistaken.

Overall it's satisfying! We can try other thing next time ♥"
Great local place :),"Known for its chicken and beef, and affordable food :) Nothing fancy but we enjoyed the atmosphere, and even got to chat with our table neighbors who were locals, got some nice tips for things to see and do. We liked it!"
steamed chicken rice ok,No frills dining in traditional noisy coffee shop setting with marble top tables wooden chairs and no aircondtioning . chicken rice is tasty and good value but not outstanding. Fish maw soup is ok.
Review by Dr H C Matthew Sim - Good Food. Basic Service. Basic Ambience.,"Review by Dr H C Matthew Sim - Good Food. Basic Service. Basic Ambience. Air-con which does not seem strong. Place is well know for Hainanese Food. Typical Singapore Coffee Shop with good food. We had the chicken rice, Hainanese Pork Chop, Hainanese Vegetables. See my Youtube Invest channel H C Matthew Sim. Place is a bit noisy but the good food makes up for the basic environment. Regards Dr H C Matthew Sim"
Authentic Hainanese food,"this place has been here for over 50 years I believe- its a SG instiution

the fish head curry is a standout- I think this is only available thurs and Friday

the Hainan chicken rice- the rice is so so- not that flavorsome, the chicken is tender and smooth.

the kong po chicken was nicely done as was the sweet sour pork

the Hainan fried pork chop/cutlet is ok- wasn't that tasty

portions are ok- not huge but not scummy small either

overall, a very satisfying meal and very good value for an expensive city like SG

would return"
Good Traditional Hainanese Cuisine,"Whenever in Singapore, I always come to this restaurant to satisfy my cravings for Hainanese Chicken Rice. This is a traditional Hainanese restaurant that serves delicious Hainanese Chicken Rice, Braised Mutton, Hainanese Chicken Chop, etc. I love this traditional style Hainanese Chicken Rice that served with delicious chili sauce and ginger sauce. The staffs are quite friendly and helpful. They even help us to take photo without requesting for it. This is a very good place for traditional Hainanese cuisine."
Great find.,Wandering Singapore to find somewhere to eat we came across Chin Chin. With lots of locals in there we ventured in. Nothing flashy but the food spoke for itself. By the time we finished our meal there wasn't a seat to be had inside or out. If you want to see how the locals eat this is a place to go. Good local food at a reasonable price and lovely atmosphere.
Very Rude. Unreasonable. Food so-so. Will not return,"The food is nothing special. Business appears brisk due to central location and tourists. The staff's attitude has always been lackluster but on our recent visit it was spectacularly spiteful. The woman at the cashier refused to pack in ginger and chilli with our takeaway of a whole chicken, when we checked and requested for it politely. Her spiteful attitude was totally unnecessary. When asked why not, since the shop serves it free flow for customers eating there, her response was to the effect of 'so, what can you do about it'. Their chicken is definitely not good enough to be eaten without ginger and chili, and one can only imagine how the food is handled if this is how they 'care' for the customers. Have not and will not return."
Past its glorious days and rivals offers better chicken rice but very affordable,"Sat down for coffee but ordered a small chicken rice to sample. The local thick coffee was much diluted.
The chicken rice was not bad but far from the best. Chicken itself did not have much natural flavour and the meat was far too tender - to an extent that the texture of breast reminded one of its liver. Portion of chicken and rice was decent. But it cost under $7 for the chicken rice and two coffees.

Told by locals that it was once very popular. Judging from the size of Chin Chin’s dining hall, perhaps it was a must-go two to three decades ago. Other chicken rice eatery rivals have certainly overtook its prestigious position.

Not missing anything to give this a pass."
A good find,"What a fantastic restaurant! The service was excellent, very friendly and we didn't have to wait long for our food. The Hainanese chicken rice was delicious, as was the Tong Choy. Washed down with a cold beer, it was a great way to replenish after the heat of the Singapore sun."
Affordable comfort food,"Right smack in the busy area of City Hall, you’ll find that this is truly a place that you get authentic Chinese cuisine at affordable price. I had a plate of delicious fried rice plus a bowl of bitter gourd soup and all for SGD$9. For locals, bitter gourd soup is a common dish to complement any meal and I would encourage overseas friends to have a go at it. There are just too many good dishes to name, just head on down and try it. Enjoy!"
Good enough for locals good enough for me,"This is a gem! It is a very busy restaurant where you get great food at a very reasonable price.
It is full of local Singaporean workers at lunch and dinner times. It’s a eat and go place. Do not eat and then expect to sit and chat for a hour. There are always people waiting for your table.
Food excellent + nice cold beer.
Price is great"
Very authentic used by locals,Not fancy decor or fine dining. However very good and very inexpensive. Traditional Chinese restaurant established for over 35 years. The speciality is poached chicken in rice. There are many other good Dishes to chose from. Staff are friendly and helpful. Expect to pay 7 Singapore dollars for a big bottle of beer and around 15-20 dollars per head for a very good meal.
Great great eating house,"One of my measures of an authentic eating house of the destination, is being the only non local in the establishment. The chin chin certainly passed that test.
Another favorite test is, would the local cab driver eat there? In this case, the cab driver delivering me to my hotel strongly advised me to go there.
Thirdly, do the only take cash. Yes to that too.
So, if you love Singapore asian food, get yourself here asap!"
Great Asian Food,"My Singaporean family take me to many places not on the usual tourist radar and this was one of them, good food, reasonably priced but sometimes a long wait but may be that is a good sign. I've visited this restaurant a few times and it's so much better than some touristy places plus terrific value."
"Excellent food, place where the locals queue up to eat","We walked past this restaurant and saw how busy it was with locals. Good food, don’t expect 5 star restaurant but it is really good food. We would go late afternoon for late lunch or early dinner, to avoid the queues. Great value, was close by JW Marriott where we were staying, and close to Raffles. If you don’t want to spend a fortune, as Singapore is expensive, this is a great place to eat."
Excellent Hainanese food at reasonable prices,"Great food at reasonable prices. Can be crowded at times but certainly worth going. Very casual place and central location. The chicken rice is good, but prawn roll and mutton claypot (certain days only) is spectacular."
Steamed chicken...yum,"Was walking and noticed a queue of customers in front of this restaurant. If there is a line...it must be good...right?!? So, we decided to wait in the queue. Wait time was around 10 minutes. We ordered the steam chicken, seasoned vegetables, sambal fried rice and hainanese pork chop. For drinks we ordered the longan juice. Service was quick and food came out in around 10 minutes."
Long waiting time,"We got there around 11am, served right away but the man told us the chefs still eating and start later after 1130am. We ordered abt 3 min dishes, drinks no variety only lime and coke for cold. Coz felt hungry then the food taste yum. V crowded. They take reserv if more than 8pax"
Late lunch 2pm,"Ambience average- wall fan filthy. Food quality 4 stars. Chap chye with shrimps was delicious, the rest is good but not wow. Staff service unfriendly, I am amazed as my sister who spoke highly of them visit them for 20 years and her family was treated as strangers. I will go back only if my family invites. Not very impressed."
much overrated and below average food,"No way this is a 4-star restaurant. Food is blend, chicken is tasteless, the best taste item is the soya sauce. I hope the managment is reading this, you might have years of success but your Hainan Chicken is one for the worst I have. Food is not cheap for this quality. Service ? Have to agree with other low scores reviewers, bad attitude zero smile, geek like talking to prison guards.

can skip, spend your time some where else"
Delicious refuge discovered coming in out of a thunderstorm,Classic high quality no-fuss asian food on purvis street (busy restaurant street in heart of raffles-area singapore). Had fabulous huge prawn roll and highly recommended mutton stew (for a lighter taste try the mutton soup). Terrific bargain prices. Friendly staff.
"Lousy Attitude, Average Food.",Lousy attitude. food average。 Lady who takes your order walks away halfway through your order. Shows attitude when you order more than 1 plate of drumstick rice. 食物一般。 态度恶劣。 点餐小姐点餐到中途就离开。 不让客人点多过一份鸡腿饭。
Very Good Hainanese Food. Singaporeans and Tourists Should Try,"Review by DrSim001 (Dr.H.C.M. Sim). Very Good Hainanese Food. Singaporeans and Tourists Should Try. No Air-conditioning. A bit Warm. Basic Ambience. Very crowded and noisy. Surprisingly, I see a sizeable number of expatriates eg, Americans and Europeans. Try the recommended dishes highlighted on the menu. So far, I have not been disappointed. Service is basic. Value for money. Pricing is from Cheap to Mid Range depending on what you order. Regards DrSim001 (Dr. H.C.M. Sim)"
Order the white chicken and Fu Yong egg,The white chicken is better than the roasted chicken.We tried both and my family prefers the white chicken. The chicken rice is fragrant and taste good. The cihilli packs a punch and the Fu yong Egg is also nice. Overall value for money.
Very good restaurant!,"Love the food and the price! Ate here randomly based on tripadvisor reviews and it did not disappoint. Ordered fried rice and their famous porkchop. Will be back to try other dishes.

Suggestion: come in groups so you can try more dishes and their servings are generous."
Comfort food!!,"Can't think of a better, comforting lunch than some good old hainanese pork chop, chicken rice and some chinese stir-fry dishes. The price is understandably pricier, given the location, but the food never really disappoints. I love this place :)"
Amazing food at cheap prices,"We loved our meals so much we ate here two nights running. Shared a few plates - highly recommend fried rice, pork ribs, sweet & sour pork, cereal prawns, and cashew chicken among others. Busy little place, no frills., but if it’s affordable tasty food you’re after I highly recommend chin chin."
Loved it,After reading reviews we decided to try this little place and we were not disappointed! Lots of locals frequent here and can be very busy! The food and service was excellent definitely worth visiting!
tasty,"delicious food. tomyum not really authentic can skip. the gem here would be hainanese pork chop served with a dipping sauce and green pees. pricing consider cheap in this area. disappointment on the drink, longan is actually prepacked. ice lemon tea should be home made."
"Good Hainanese Chinese Food, Good Price. Tourists should Visit.","Review by drsim001 (Dr HCM Sim, PhD). Good Hainanese Chinese Food, Good Price. Tourists should Visit. No air-conditioning. Very noisy but good atmosphere. Just like back in the old Singapore days. Service is Basic. They just put food on table. When I was eating, there were 2 large tables of American tourists/expatriates tucking in. Diners are Mostly Locals but a handful of tourists. Try the Hainanese Pork Chops, and Hainanese Mix Vegetables. Hainanese is a dialect group among the Chinese. Most foreigners think that all Chinese are the same, but there are actually subtle difference in languages and cultures and food depending on the different regions in China. Regards drsim001 (Dr HCM Sim, PhD)"
Best food and price!,"The chicken is tender and succulent, and the mutton soup is to die for, Ordered 5 other dishes (potato leave, fried prawn roll,curry fush head, omelette,claypot tofu), and none disappointed. A big group of 10, total bill was S$145. Fantastic place for family gatherings. will come again!"
Get the cereal prawns!,It was crowded during dinner time but we were seated quickly. Place was clean and the location was great. We had the chicken with cashew and cereal prawns. Both dishes were good but the cereal prawns was really delicious!
Fuss free casual dining for local food,"I've been a regular for many years now - Chin Chin eating house serves up a lot of local dishes (if you know what to order!)

The famous items here are the chicken rice (or you can just order a portion of chicken meat) and the mutton soup (subject to availability).

It tends to get crowded at 7pm, so if you have a large group (4 and above), be ready for a wait."
The best Hainanese restaurant in Singapore,"I visit this Hainanese restaurant at least once a week. Located at Purvis Street it is just a stone's throw from City Hall MRT station and also near Bugis MRT station. This is perhaps one of the oldest coffee shops along Purvis St which has a history dating from the 1900s.
This restaurant serves the best Hainanese food like fish head curry, pork chop, chicken rice, fish maw vegetables and drinks like Lohan guo. The restaurant is crowded during peak hours and more so on weekends. The food is excellent and the price is reasonable. Service is good and your waiting time is short., This restaurant is being run by a Hainanese family and has been here for a long time. During lunch time the place is packed to the brim with office workers from the nearby offices and shopping malls. However this is not a good place for diners with babies in prams as the place is usually very crowded. This restaurant is popular with locals and tourists."
Yummy,"Ate in this restaurant twice . Order different things each time. Love the vegetables and the Haines chicken.
They have Malaysian food, Chinese food and some other dishes. Service not bad. Not much atmosphere but local people watching. I would eat here again if I went back to Singapore although I’m sure there are more fancier places.Everything we ate tasty!"
Hainanese Chicken Rice ...plus!,"Whenever we want chicken rice, we go to Chin Chin in Bugis. The open air store may be a bit warm but the ceiling fans and super yummy food make the experience worth it! The chicken is poached or roasted to perfection. We only ordered two chicken rice orders because we also got a plate of Kuay Teow (chow fun), along with two kinds of vegetables for four of us. Love this place!"
Awesome chicken rice and more,"Whilst it may not look like much, this place serves really good local food.
I always end up with chicken rice, but believe me there is a lot of other local dishes to choose from. A great place to introduce friends to local food without having to travel out of town . Easy to find ."
Lunch,"Visited many times - Chicken rice and Pork Chop are my favorite. Paid $34 for half chicken, pork chop, dou miao, 4 plates of rice and 2 drinks."
Wow - Loved it,"My husband and I were staying in Singapore before and after a cruise. We had passed Chin Chin and saw how busy it was, there are other restaurants in Purvis Street not doing as well. Even though it was busy, they still found us a seat. We had kam kong (a lot like morning glory), pepper steak and a dish called vegetarian which was a very generous serve of fresh vegetables - snow peas, bok choy, mushrooms, beans, carrots etc. We had water and the bill came to $32 we were so full and we still left some. We loved the food so much that after the cruise we went back because the food was so tasty. Singapore has a lot of restaurants but this one was our favourite."
Lunch,"Chicken for two, two plates of rice, two lemon calamansi drinks # total bill s$14.40 We love the smooth texture of the chicken. Super yummy, refreshing calamansi drink to finish up."
Happy Babel,"House speciality is chicken, steamed or barbeque, with rice. It's always very busy and very noisy... Eating out in Singapore is like that, people talk and laugh non stop as they eat, and they're happy to talk to strangers too. My Kung Po chicken was delicious and very good value for money. If you want to eat like the locals do, you won't go wrong here."
Great food.,"Food was quick, tasty and cheap. Can't ask for more than that. Hainese chicken was superb. Main tip I would give is be nice to the staff and you will love the place!"
Lots of Variety,"Typical Chinese
Hainanese restaurant which serves both chicken rice and zi cha dishes. Lots of variety to choose from and could seme there are a lot regulars around. Chicken and rice was just average and claypot tofu taste like home cooked. With the place being air conditioned and big tables around, it is a good place for large family dinner as this is the time to order different dishes."
Two good times here already,"I have had the opportunity to eat here twice in the last 3 months while on business trip to SG office. The place is always crowded but if you don't mind sharing tables, it is still possible to find seats. The service is average with some staff being efficient and other simply plain rude. The price is decent and serving of food is fast. The roasted chicken rice, mixed veggie and chicken liver are all tasty and still worth the visit."
"Simple, easy and fast-food Singapore Style","Was caught in the pre-race mayhem and decided to ride a bike through Seah Street and Purvis Street. So I stopped over unexpectedly at Chin Chin's during the F1 weekend as the rest of the local eateries were closing up at 8pm.

Had a quick dinner between errands and was pleasantly surprised. Quick service and good food. Had traditional ""white"" Chicken rice, with all the chili and ginger condiments and a Chap Chai mixed vegetables with Tang Hoon. All for below $15 bucks SGD and a nice lime juice."
"Good old, authentic eating for lunch",My Singaporean colleague took me to the restaurant. It is located along a street with a lot of restaurants serving Hainan cuisine. Chicken was so tender. Getting toward noon it got so crowded with locals. Must try.
Ok food. Not a fancy restaurant.,"Well, if you are looking for a fancy restaurant who serve the local food than this place may disappoint you. Very basic local restaurant with only cash, no card. Food was ok. We ordered Fried Rice and Thai Chilli Chicken. Both were ok. Total bill was less than S$20. So cheap food. Would I go again? I doubt......."
Local food,Nice local food that was well prepared. The staff was nice and helpful. We enjoyed being there experiencing local food
Delicious food. Busy place.,"Great food, quickly served. English is spoken by the staff, but pronunciation ....a lot of fun. Cash terms only. Reasonable prices."
Go if you like Hainanese chicken rice,"Well known for their Hainanese chicken. Other dish-worthy items are its pork chop, chap cai and hei zou. Place is big but when it gets packed, it can be noisy with all the echo. Don't expect first class service, but it's food is 👍🏽"
Tender and juicy chicken,"Ordered the white hainanese chicken rice, and it's tender and juicy! The mixed vegetables is good with nice sauce too. The ngioh hieng is crispy and good too. Pork chop is a little too dry and hard."
The authentic Hainanese restaurant,"My favourite restaurant in Singapore is the Chin Chin Eating House or Chin Chin Restaurant. Take a train to Bugis MRT or City Hall MRT and walk to this restaurant at Purvis St. This restaurant has been in operation for the last 30 years. It serves authentic Hainanese food and the popular dishes are pork chop, beef stew, bittergourd with beef and the fragrant Hainanese chicken rice. The chilly and black sauce are excellent . The price is reasonable. If you come here on Saturdays and Sundays then you must be prepared to wait for a table as the restaurant is usually very crowded.
Service is fast and good and most patrons are regular diners who come from near and afar."
"Authentic Hainanese Food, Good Wok Hei, Reasonable Priced","I've been here numerous times and they serve a wide range of food selection, with a recommended section of their Hainanese specials. Their Steam Chicken is juicy and yummy with the right dose of sauce laden when served. The Hainanese Pork Chop is crispy (you have an option to have the tomato sauce served separately if you don't like mushy pork chop). The Hainanese Mix Vegetables is interesting as they fried it with small shrimps, lending the dish an umami taste. The Hainanese Claypot Mutton is delicious, served with a unique concoction chilli sauce.

It isn't expensive to have a whole family of 6 - 10 people dining here. It costs approx S$7 - S$10/pax with either chicken rice (rice cooked in chicken broth & pandan leaf) or plain rice. The restaurant is air conditioned with a couple of outdoor tables (if you prefer to dine along the five foot walkway). There are different sized dishes for different dining sizes, so do check with the staff if you want to downsize or upsize whatever you fancy. There are English & Mandarin speaking staff so communication won't be a problem. They may look grouchy but are actually very friendly."
Hainanese pork chop,The pork chop here is one of my favourites .It tastes so delicious you must try it and the prices of the foods here are all very reasonable too.
Locals Love This Singapore Eatery,"This is a cultural dining experience with lots of choices on the menu. A bit confusing for a tourist but a satisfying excursion into eating like a local.

Food was bland and is prepared for the masses. If you want flavor and texture this is not for you. Seating was crowded and shared tables the rule at meal times. Hot and not air conditioned.

Still, wanting to follow Anthony Bordain's experience, it was a nice thing to try. I won't be back though because there are many better places to eat."
Authentic,Check out this place for authentic Singapore Chicken Rice which was really tasty. I have had better Hainanese Pork Chop though. Still it was delicious and worth the visit. Lunch time is rather crowded. Be prepared to share tables. Was glad the restaurant staff spoke English and are quite helpful. Definitely recommended.
"Great service, great food","We ordered a half white chicken and half roasted chicken for four people, 4 plates of rice and soup as well as a small serving of vegetables for sharing. We also had four drinks. The total cost of that meal was about $31-$32.

The waitress was attentive and our food was served quickly. WE went during a quiet time at about 3pm, after the lunch crowd had gone. The food was delicious as always and I like that the chilli is spicy and tangy. We also have the option of grated ginger, which not many chicken rice places offer.

Great place for family meals at reasonable prices. The eating house is not air conditioned but there are high ceilings and fans. It could get a bit warm during peak hours.

Overall, very pleased with the food, service and environment."
Good Hainanese and local food at reasonable prices,"If you would like to try good authentic Hainanese cuisine and some other local dishes at reasonable prices, this is the place to go. Chin Chin Eating House has been in business for decades and is very popular with locals. Service is efficient. The eating house is particularly busy on weekends during dinner. They do accept reservations for large groups. This is a good place to bring friends from overseas who wish to try Hainanese chicken rice and other local dishes."
Great place to eat wide menu choice,"We eat at Chin Chin 3 night while stay in Singapore and we found the menu great, the Ginger beef was by far my favourite, but other meals also held their own.
It is an eating house so quite casual, but you can get a really good meal at a reasonable price.
There are lots of eating house/ restaurants in this area so very competitive.
It is well worth visiting this area and trying Chin Chin.
They cater for small and large groups"
Chicken and Pork Chop,The place was crowded with the older younger generation which indicates good food. We ordered both the white and roasted chicken and the hainanese pork chop. The chicken rice was lovely and my kids had second helpings. The chilli was potent but just the way I like it. Will be back.
Not what I expected!,"Great food. I was a little cautious of the school canteen type atmosphere. Good chicken and rice, good beef. No concerns at all. English can be a bit hit or miss with the staff and the diners we spoke to were all local."
Didn't like the food at all,"Wasn't sure this was even chinese food. It was bland, not that it needed to be spicy. Prawns in cereal, -tastless. Crab with salted egg, overcooked. Need I say more."
Bland food!,"Very disappointing! After the rave reviews we had the chicken rice and the pork chops. Bland parboiled chicken, plain lukewarm rice and dry overcooked tasteless pork (which had been hanging around somewhere)"
Authentic Hainanese Restaurant,"Serve Authentic Hainanese Chicken Rice and Western Pork Chop.
I simply like Singapore Hainanese Chicken Rice.
Chin Chin just so-so among the rest i had before, about taste and value.
Single Serve portion Chicken Rice cost $ 5.00, whereby you may get it somewhere else cheaper ($ 3.00 ~ $ 3.50), and taste much more better.
Just that, the restaurant located at the street that, Hainanese gather the most during the British Colonel era."
Good value for money,The place is obviously extremely popular as we were only just about able to get a table! We ordered Hainanese (sorry about spelling!) pork for 6$ and cashew chicken for 14$. The portion sizes are very big and the food is tasty... but not amazing.
Walked by and stopped in,"Happen to walk by going towards Raffles and saw this place. Crowded for a mod afternoon so decided to try. A lot locals in the place so had to be good.

Promptly seated with menu and order a Tiger beer. Big bottle beer was out with in second with chilled glass.

A lot of food choices noodles, rice. Duck chicken, spicy not spicy on and on....yum

Had the thai chicken and fried rice. Very good and spicy. Cant complain.

One note. Its cash only. Moderately priced and off Beach Blvd on the corner. Enjoy this find."
Famous Hainanese Pork Chop,Brought my wife here to try the famous Chin Chin Hainanese Pork Chop. The Pork Chop was served separately from the sauce thus keeping the crispiness but the sauce was a bit thin. The service also has much room for improvement. And the price is not cheap.
Very good traditional hainanese chicken rice and other hainanese dishes,"Non air conditioned but equivalent to the old swee kee restaurant in middle road. There are many other chices b sides chicken rice that you try like hainanese pork chop, mix d vegetable sour, ngoi hiamg, pepper beef, tofu"
Best Chicken Rice!,"Great offerings of a Chinese restaurant. The chicken rice is one of my personal favourite, great fragrant rice with an unbeatable chicken rice chilli."
Get the chicken rice,"Chin chin restaurant in Singapore is awesome, had some amazing chicken rice. A half chicken half a chicken and rice with chilly and a broth that I drank. Learn how to eat with a spoon. Another awesome meal in Singapore"
