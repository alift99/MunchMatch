A carnivore‚Äôs dream.,This is indeed a different dining experience. Free flow of meat delivered to your table. A carnivore‚Äôs dream. It wasn‚Äôt terribly busy so we could enjoy the service. The salad bar is self service.
Brazil üáßüá∑ in Singapore üá∏üá¨,"First time trying Brazilian here in Singapore! Made a booking quite easily through the linked Apps ! It was my son‚Äôs birthday and they included a lava cake for the celebration! The salad bar was free flow and at your own pace ‚Ä¶ was a great selection including banana fritters , beetroot, coleslaw and many of my favs! The BBQ meats came in fast and furious and the beef (many parts were served like back, shoulder, rump , etc‚Ä¶ was excellent 9/10 ! The rest of the meats were also good though the sausages became hard after a few minutes ! Cost 68 per pax buffet , wine is buy one and your own is free corkage , parking also free after 6pm just around the place ! Overall a good experience!"
Not recommended.,"Very bad experience, a very noisy place where the communication between us was nearly impossible. Meat nothing special and salad bar seemed not very fresh‚Ä¶"
Always Great,"I think this was my 5th time here and once again a fantastic evening. Great that now that COVID is over the salad bar was open again and there is a fantastic selection there. These guys do not mess around, they feed you. If you don't come with a hunger then don't go, if your a vegetarian your wish you weren't.

Vicky from Rio is always there and oversees the cooking to ensure its real Brazilian. After living in Rio for 6 years i know good Churrasco (Barbeque) and this is the real deal. Prepare for FOOD COMA :)"
Great dinner,"Went for a family dinner. Craving for meat, basically it became my routine to visit every quarter. Saturday night, the restaurant was quite full. Some of the waiters recognize after some visits and talk some jokes when serving, what makes the experience more pleasant, at home. We asked first for some salad plates and the black beans stew, simple but good as the main is to eat meat. The served portions are good and the types of meat are enough to enjoy a churrascaria experience.
By the time we were leaving, the restaurant became full. I don't enjoy a full time house environment since the meat servings rotation may become slow and undercooked. Just felt a local soda, guarana at 7.5 , overpriced.The meal is at SGD59, up from my previous visit but overall still an enjoyable dinner. I recommend and will come back again."
"First and Last Time, Never Again","PROS:

It's quite a hidden gem, away from the busy bees area.

CONS:

Everything seems so rush, the waiter never explained properly what they are serving us, what kind of meat it was, how it was cooked or seasoned.

It's all like ""Beef Rumps"", ""Chicken Heart"", ""Chicken Thigh"", ""Fish"" etc. All you know is you ended up with five or six different type of meat in one go.

Both of us felt like we're one of those ducks that are being fed with all these meat without knowing what they are. It just kills the entire experience. The meat, some are tough, some are juicy. Very inconsistent. Likewise for the service, somehow our table gets a pass most of the time. Why?

This was our first time and for the kind of price we're paying, it's surely our last.

I really have nothing else to say about this restaurant. It's really that special."
Great barbecue place - trust me I'm a Brazilian,"Went to Brazil Churrasco a couple of weeks ago. I'm a Brazilian and this was my first experience at a Brazilian Churrascaria in Asia. It was above my expectations. The picanha was excellent, caipirinha as well and the Brazilian waiter was extremely friendly."
Excellent Service & 5* for the lady host,"Had an excellent night with my friends!
Restaurant was packed. We were waiting for our turn to be seated and saw the lady host was trying to assist a group of friends infront of us.
Heard the guy saying 'your system is crap' and started to abuse the lady host with words which is terrible just because they are not able to show proof that they are vaccinated.
She looked so calmed and trying to help them out but the guy was sooo rude towards her!
When comes to our turn, she politely apologies for the delay and I told her ""hey u are doing your best and u did well by staying calm!
Dinner was excellent as ever. The lady host came to our table and asked is everything okay which we were very impressed despite her being busy running around helping her colleagues, she went around to make sure customer are all ok.
Dear patrons, if you ever read my comment, please treat the staff and especially the lady doing reservation with respect.

Overall excellent food & service!"
Main hostess had a burr up her hinny! Super off putting,"We have visited this restaurant several times and we invited some friends to go as a sort of celebration to being fully vaccinated. The main female hostess who manages the reservations and seats the guest was flat out rude, full of attitude and totally off putting for absolutely no reason at all. Upon arriving at the restaurant when we were checking in her tone was very short as she directed us to check in and stand in a specific place. After checking in when she informed us we had only 90min of dinning before the table needed to be released for the next reservation, which was totally fine but the way she talked to us you would of thought we just offended her. She had such and attitude and was so harsh with us we were very taken back. It made the start of dinner quite awkward to be honest. We tried to lighten the mood by joking that she would return exactly after 90 min to tell us to go and lo and behold she was back with the same nasty attitude, no greeting, no ‚Äúhow was your dinner‚Äù‚Ä¶just nasty/harsh ‚Äúyour 90min is up we need to release the table‚Äù‚Ä¶not even a thanks at the end. We were actually all finished, masked up and waiting for the bill. We almost just left because she was so nasty. The crazy thing is is that the rest of the staff was wonderful and the dinner was great but her pissy attitude soured it.

If you are the owner or manager reading this please speak to that lady. We have been several times and the friendly staff is one of the reasons we go back. I know times are stressful with all the COVID restrictions but it‚Äôs not the guests fault and with a greeting and exit like that we won‚Äôt be back any time soon. We had introduced our friends to this place for celebration dinner but that experience put them off as well so they will not be returning.

Hope someone gives that lady a hug because she needs it.

As for dinner, staff (excluding her), value‚Ä¶all is good!"
Another visit,"Due to the restrictions I was craving for meat and went on a Thursday night with a friend. The salad buffet was not back yet. The meat was good, probably it is the best option in Singapore compared to the other option. The servers came in a timed pace, serving good portions and the meat was well prepared and done. I hate when servers come at a very fast pace before you are able to enjoy the previous portion of meat. It was an enjoyable meal."
Terrible service,"The beef is acceptable and although there's a lot of typical dishes one would expect from a rodizio, considering the distance it's alright. Nevertheless, the service is incredible poor. The waiter rush giving you the beef cuts, without consideration, and being rude. In various occasions the waiter would only ""drop"" the beef cut in the plate (or miss the plate, altogether)"
Good alternative for a churrasco in Singapore,"Good service, frequency of servings. Due to Covid restriction buffet was not available however good portions brought to the table on small plates. Feijoada was good, well prepared. The meat offer , I felt limited but I guess the same of other Brazilian restaurants in Singapore....the meat quality was ok/ good. While the main churrasco course is similar all places around at 50 SGD, drinks and desserts were beyond expected. The traditional quindim, made with egg yoke at 14SGD was not exactly it. Stay with the meat and enjoy the course.Environment is good, you can have business meals and family gatherings."
"Great ambience, excellent","Great ambience, excellent service. We were served by a friendly passador with good sense of humour. The young lady who waited on our table was very cheerful n efficient, filing up our water, asking if we needed more meats, changing our plates. Food was delicious esp the beef hump, beef ribs, lamb, sausage and chicken livers. Even the sides were good, loved the deep fried crispy Kai lan and sweet potato. They serve delicious soup of the day in small little cups, I‚Äôve had the tomato n mushroom - both lip smacking authentic goodness. I had 2 servings of the beef hump - tender, fatty and melt in your mouth goodness. The chicken livers were crispy on the outside n oh so tender on the inside. I think I ate 6 livers! Advise if it‚Äôs your first time - go slow, ask for very small shavings of the meats the first time round to taste, then get a bigger portion of only the ones you like the second time round. And just enjoy!!"
Good food,This restaurant is well known among many diners. We drove to this place and reached in time for dinner. The ambience of the restaurant is good. The food we ordered were lamb pieces. They were delicious.
go with an appetite,"great selection of meats and sides - but you need to be hungry to go there and do it justice. not the cheapest place to eat unless you can really ""fill your boots"". friendly staff and nice selection of grilled meats etc - more selection in the evening. we love the chicken hearts hear, but they don't come around often enough for us..........."
No basil churros at Brasil Churrasco,"We first visited Brasil Churrasco 25 years ago, and amazingly the friendly passador from Rio is still there! Homey atmosphere, with a good salad bar that includes heart of palm, feijoada, and you can ask for yummy farofa too. The cuts of meat are not nearly as varied as at the best rodizios in Brasil, but you still find delicious picanha, cupim, chicken hearts, etc. For me, the best time to visit is for brunch on Sunday. You can enjoy a nice siesta afterwards, whereas after a dinner here you might not feel good for a long time! Anyway, you would not want to eat meat for at least a while unless you are a sumo wrestler!"
Family‚Äôs Favorite,Been introduced to Brazil Churrasco 20 years ago. We were there as newly weds then and now our 2 boys joins us. It‚Äôs our favourite go-to place whenever we crave a good cut of meat and not to mention their extensive choice of salad bar. Great service and excellent food.
Love the food and staff here,"Great cut of meats, friendly staff which are more like friends to us. Maya Fizah, Tiki, all staff there are just amazing."
Amazing Place,"Absolutely recommend everyone to experience this fantastic place, great food and wonderful friendly, knowledgeable staff and awesome owner who all make you feel at home. Greetings from Zambia, Southern Africa. See you on my next trip. Cheers Nims."
Muito bon !,"Consistent quality of the meat and great, smiling, friendly service make this place the best Churrasco in town, by far.
The caipirinha is great, tasty and well balanced, and the wine list offers a wide selection of Australian, southAmerican and European bottles to satisfy all palates.
A must try for the meat lovers."
Excellent Spread of Meat! Eat all you want,Been here a couple of times with family and friends.. It's one of the best so far. The meat selection is excellent. So is the salad bar. Good and friendly staff.
Carnivores fiesta,"Brought here by friends . Amazing place with excellent meats . All types of meat Grill to perfection - from salad bar , grill beef , lamb , chicken etc.... until the grill pineapple !! Speechless just enjoy !!
Will definitely come back .
Very good service too !"
Best option for Brazilian BBQ in Singapore,"This was my second time visiting and I can confirm this is the best Brazilian BBQ spot in Singapore. It's a little out of the way from the central hotels, but well worth the trip. All the meats were on point, the salads were good, even though we only had a few small helpings as we wanted to focus on the meat. But what makes the experience even more memorable is the service.
We were running very late due to rain and bad traffic, but one quick call to the restaurant and they held our table for us. We were ushered in upon arrival and the staff made sure we had everything we need, even said they can top up or bring to the table any special item we wanted.
The one piece of advice I can give is to pace yourself, as you may feel inundated with options, but it's ok to take a breather and pass one or two dishes for later as they will return to you eventually. So take your time to savour each serving of meat, and your experience will be all the better for it. Highly recommended."
Meat galore!,"It was our second visit after 10 years. We are so glad we came. There was a good selection of meats including beef, lamb, chicken, duck and fish. Even the salad bar ""put up a good fight"" for our attention. The friendly service staff topped it off and made our family night out a pleasant and satisfied one. Will definitely be back."
Great Food great service,"Food was amazing, customer service was perfect. The meat was seasoned to perfection and my favorite the pineapple they cook!! OMG!!!!!!!! well worth the price!!!!"
Meat lover's unite,"This is a great place for meat lovers, beef especially. We've been coming here since they opened in 25 years ago. Same consistent quality and friendly staff."
Meat lovers heaven,"Brazilian BBQ: we know what was coming! The buffet with sides is more than enough choices. Try the potato salad for sure!
And next - meat, meat, meat.
Excellent meat. We mainly stick to the beef but the pork sausages are nice too.
If the drinks would be more reasonable, we would have rated 5 stars."
Dinner for 7,"Great as always . Last time i was here was 5 years ago. Standard improved. The salad bar enough to make you full. Variety of meat, lamb soft and juicy, chicken, chicken liver, chicken heart, beef topside, ribs, pork sausage, all topped with red wine and smoked pineapple (never seen anywhere else). Will continue to come back."
The best Churrasco in Singapore,"This place is legit. I have tried many Brazilian restaurants in Singapore and none can beat this. They have been around at 6th Avenue for 20 years. The service staff is friendly and after all these years, the food standard remains excellent.
It's my to go place when I'm craving bbq meats."
Gratifying Wedding Anniversary-Family Dinner,"As a Family of Meat Lovers, this was a place that took us 2 years in waiting. So, having my Wedding Anniversary dinner here was timely great with full compliments to Ms. Maya for making this event unforgettable (Wifey-very-Happy) and to their very friendly ‚ÄúMen-in-Black‚Äù (or Meat Servers, who make sure your plate is full of their meats).
Salad Bar is awesome with wide selections that‚Äôll make u feel full (‚Ä¶ we were warned), from pastas, rice, greens, etc., before having the meats.
I‚Äôd say best of their Meats are the Smoked/Roast Duck (which leaves u wanting for more), Roast beef, Sausages & Ham. (‚Ä¶not sure if there was Pork)
Chicken was ok but thick parts tend to be dry inside. Special chicken parts (ex: Heart) was very appetising with no after-taste.
Grilled Pineapple was a healthy imitation of ‚Äújuicy-caramel‚Äù, that made me ask for more servings.
Drink selections can be improved though for more choices for youngsters.

Overall, we are coming back because we love‚Ä¶ our meats / friendly-smiling staffs (‚Ä¶most of them) / great service (Thank u Ms. Maya) & not-too-squeezy seating ambience. Value-for-your-Dollar ? ‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs a bit pricey but It‚Äôs well worth it !!!"
Any meat lover's dream,"Very very satisfied with the service of the staff & quality of the meats at this restaurant! Visited here for my bf's birthday last week and we left with an extremely full stomach. We opted for the buffet which added up to about $61/pax after GST and service charge. Price is a little bit steep, but I think was quite worth it especially if it's for a special occasion.
Website & Facebook both mentioned 14 different cuts of meat, and I'm not sure if that was true, but off the top of my head, here are the items I remember being served:
Chicken liver, chicken heart, roasted chicken breast, roasted chicken thigh, fish (I don't remember how it was cooked but it was yummy even though it could be seasoned more), garlic beef, beef hump, beef tenderloin, pork sausages, duck breast, lamb and of course, grilled pineapple.
The items will be served to you at your table; the staff will come around with the different cuts of meat to ask you if you would like some. They are incredibly attentive and if you say no enough times to what they offer, they will ask you if there are any kind of meats you prefer so that they can bring it out to you.
One waitress, in particular, even tried to accommodate to our request of getting our portion of garlic beef rare. Very amazing service!
Salad bar was nice too, I especially liked the pesto penne, but main star of the show was definitely the meats.
I will come back again soon! I really enjoyed this place."
Churrasco ok,"I was there for a dinner with friends, the place is nice, spacious, the number of servers are enough to cover even if the restaurant was full on a Saturday night. The staff follows with attention, asking if people wanted another round of meat type. The buffet salad has a good variety and is good. The variety of meat is not as much as in a real churrascaria, what is understandable however I felt it very limited, soon after the start, the service was all in a rush bringing meat after meat, while we were not able to finish on the servings, I would expect the servers to dose the timing, we had to ask them to slow down. Some meats were not grilled to the point I have experienced before, either too early, not hot enough/ warm or missing salt (and I don't like salty meat). It was the only churrascaria offering grilled chicken liver (what I felt interesting). The grilled pineapple that usually is good was very green, not sweet and not well grilled. At the end the final bill was around SGD70 a person (just the main with some drinks, no desserts and coffee). Disappointed for the quality of the food based on the price we paid for. For someone that wants to feast on meat from time to time, not sure if it was a bad night or if it may be good to try another place."
Farewell Dinner,"Just had another excellent dinner at Brazil Churasco and never fails to fulfill expectations of great food. Service is very good with staff pampering you with all the meats that you desire. For those who haven‚Äôt visited this place, it‚Äôs well worth your efforts and is highly recommended."
One word to describe. EXCELLENT,"This is my third visit to Brazil Churrasco and it has never fail to keep up to its standards of satisfying my need for meat. The salad counter is also filled with an array of choices. Different parts of the meat were cook to perfection and the smoked duck is a definite must try! I highly recommend this place to anybody who loves beef like I do. Great ambience, great service, great food!"
A family of regular customer‚Äôs great disappointment,"My family have been visiting this place for years and it is a special place for my parent‚Äôs wedding anniversary. Tonight we are back again but greatly disappointed.
1) My brother fished out a kitchen towel in the coleslaw. The waiter briskly whisked away his plate, tapped my dad‚Äôs shoulder to quietly say sorry and changed the coleslaw at the buffet counter like nothing happened. That was the last of the encounter.
2) The waiter barely know anything about the wine list. In the past, the waiter will describe the wine and make recommendations. Now, the waiter just state the obvious, which can be read off the wine list.
3) The standard of chef had dropped. The flavour of flamed meat no longer exist. It is no different from a piece of roasted beef that I make at home.
4) The familiar friendly staffs are gone. The perks of being a regular customer is the staffs knows exactly what you like and the personal touch, that was why we loved this place so much. Tonight the waiters are not attentive, it was a long wait before someone noticed that our plates are empty and meat have not been coming by for some time.

This place has great sentimental value to my family. For everyone to agree it is time to look for a new place, it really reflects our disappointment."
Average Brazilian BBQ steakhouse in Singapore,"Brazil Churras is an average place, the food is not so good, and it is an OK meal. I went there only once and never got back again"
Not Bad,"Having worked in Rio and appreciated the concept that this restaurant offers, I was pleased at the food and service. The salad bar was awesome and the staff carving the meat very friendly. Just when I thought I was full, along came the barbecued pineapple which was amazing.

Well worth a visit."
Pricey and not authentic,"I lived in Brazil for 13 years as a young adult. So my Family without fail would have Churrasco 1-2 a month. However we decided to try the Churrasco at Sixth Avenue, it was not good at all. It is more to suit the taste of Singaporeans. Sadly to say, the Cupin was way too salty and Meats were hard to chew. I would not go back to this place ever again."
Excellent!,I come here for every big celebration. The food is delicious and it's got a huge salad bar for vegetarians too. Looking forward to returning!
Great Churrasco,"In the pure Brazilian tradition, you can sample several beef meat cuts, chicken, sausages etc and also have a few vegetables to give you good conscience...
Start with a authentic caipirinha cacha√ßa and will feel transported in Ipanema.
A nice selection of red wines to go along with the meat, is available: Chile, Argentina, France you should find something to satisfy your palate there.
Excellent service from the staff: the waitress as well as the guys serving and cutting the meat. Well done!
Definitely a place for meat lovers!"
Meat lovers Paradise,"This restaurant has an amazing selection of meats... 5 types of meat (chicken, beef, lamb,pork,fish) and 14 cuts of meat. The servers come to your table very frequently with the different meats, which they carve off for you, as much as you like. You literally eat until you can‚Äôt eat anymore. The salad bar is very extensive and the best I have seen. The servers were very efficient and pleasant. I would like to mention Azza, who was particularly helpful in explaining the meats and making our evening more pleasurable. We had very good service overall. I would highly recommend this restaurant, especially to those who enjoy their meats."
Excellent restaurant and service,"The ambience is beautiful. The salad bar is great with many choices of vegetables.

Great cuts of various meat . Freshly cooked and succulent. The barbecue pineapples is everyone favourite.

Excellent staff service. Friendly and warm.

All of us enjoyed the food, wine and bonding in this restaurant. My second visit here this year."
I‚Äôd come here even if they charged double what they did.,"Let me just start by saying the service was impeccable. Especially from the hostess Maya and the server Briggs. Thank you both so much for making my birthday dinner an enjoyable one.

The food was amazing. The beef was great. The lamb was good and the fish was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I personally hate fish but this fish is a MUST TRY, even if you‚Äôre allergic.

Overall it was a great experience and I‚Äôll definitely be back here again. Thank you so much for the great birthday dinner."
A restaurant for meat lovers!!!,"Brazilian Barbeque Buffet Restaurant that serves a wide variety of meats, especially different parts of beef. Pork, chicken, fish also served with a wide variety of salads."
Great Brazillian steakhouse with friendly staff,"If you like your meat then this is the place for you. Great salad selection, and as much meat as you can eat hand-carved at the table. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, and great meat (try the chicken hearts!!).
Also a surprisingly good choice of single malt whiskies, and a small, but perfectly formed, desert menue"
Just great!,"Only for voracious meat eaters!

Don't full yourself with the salads... Just pick a few here and there to wash your palate.
I loved the lamb! Rest of the meats are also just so worth it and more.
Loved the place and locality... nice and quiet outside, but a meat festival inside :)"
The first and still the best Churrascaria in Singapore,"Great prices, very service focused I took a group of 20 men there for dinner, fantastic evening, to really enjoy I highly recommend going in a group"
Hidden Gem -great food and great service,"Authentic Brazilian churrascaria in Singapore - great food and great service,Great place to go for meat lovers .Meat grills are great and unique and have great variety .5 different types of Beef ,lamb ,Chicken heart ,liver ,smoked duck,Fish etc etc .Plus Grilled Pine apple and a great salad bar .Would recommend this place and would definitely come back
."
Not enough meet to go around,"Have eaten there quite a few times back in 2015-2016. Always been happy with the service and quality.
But this seems to have slipped as it appears that there is not enough meat to go around.
This goes especially for the beef.

All in all a disappointment.

We all four left with ‚Äúhalf‚Äù empty stomach.

Room for improvement."
Great dinner with friends,"I‚Äôm came by this churrasco by the recommendation from a work associate, and it really is something.

I will not tell you how much this space is great in a very special kind of way.
I will not tell you how the atmosphere is very friendly and perfect for family and close friends.
I will not tell you how rich is the buffet and diverse in all kinds of salads.
I will not tell you about great staff who will bombard you every two minutes with the grilled meat of finest quality.

I will tell you how you can get all this for 50 Singapore dollars (plus the cost of drinks of course)!
Which considering the amount and the general high prices which you will encounter as tourist in Singapore sounds like too good to be true.

The only drawback, if I have to say one, is the outside location/neighborhood where this hidden gem is located. It could be far better and some people will be thrown back by it.
(That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs lacking that fifth star)

But maybe that‚Äôs not such a bad thing after all, I mean if it was too visible and shiny then it couldn‚Äôt be our hidden little gem."
My only Choice for Churasco BBQ,Me and my family often come here and this time i brought my Nephew and kids. Had a good time. Fresh cut of meats and very gd Service. There is a Valet Service as well and i do advise to use it as parking is minimal around there. Priced Reasonably and from all the Churrasco out there. This Restaurant is tge best of them all. Highly recommend it.
"Amazing experience, can't fathom the complaints","This place is the best Brazilian buffet style place I've ever been anywhere in my life. I may actually go so far to say it's one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore.

The food is incredible, I don't know what they do to their meat, but it's indescribably tasty. Similarly, the server lads are super, super friendly, and I particularly love the one guy who is always grinning slyly everytime he tempts you into taking some extra beef or whatever, with his wonderfully encouraging, devil on the shoulder demeanor. I honestly can't speak highly enough about this place.

I've been here so many times, with so many large groups of people, every single one of whom loves the place. It therefore actually angers me reading the negative reviews that are on here. It's a nonsense, this place is absolutely wonderful and you should go."
Know this place over 20 years and i was never disappoint,"This meat restaurant maintain their popularity for many years. Excellent grilled meat, very good service and nice atmosphere. Always great to come back."
Birthday Dinner,Well I heard much about Brazilian food this evening friends wanted to take there son out for his birthday. Must admit as a meat eater from Louisiana it was not something I really really enjoyed. Would I eat here again? Only if friends wanted to come.
They'll meat you!,"Visited this place with family for dinner buffet for S$50 each. The way it works is that you help yourself from the salad buffet which is good but not too exciting. Then the waiters come to you with different meats on large skewers and slice off pieces onto your plate. They bring tons of smoked duck, fish, chicken, a variety of beef and pork. All the meat items I have tried were really good. They also serve flambed pineapple, sliced off the skewer just like the meat - it's also very good, especially to finish off your dinner. Service was great and very friendly."
A genuine experience with excellent service,"For those of us who have had Churrasco at restaurants a little closer to Latin America, the seasoning and preparation may seem a little off. However, it‚Äôs a genuine experience and the meat tender and flavorful. What takes it to a full 5 stars is the value, the service (best we‚Äôve gotten in Singapore thus far) and a bonus for us in that, per the restaurant staff, the chicken and beef are halal (the restaurant itself is not as it serves pork, but if you inform them in advance, they won‚Äôt offer it at your table)."
"The Original Brazil, and the Best!!","Have visited this restaurant since 2002 every year on an average of about 5 times a year. I think the record is ten times a year in one or two of those 15 years. Why do I keep coming back? The food is excellent, that is always important, but to me, especially through aging where I cannot eat as much as I used to, the staff are equally important. The staff treat you like friends instead of customers, and there is genuine warmth in them wanting to ensure you have the best possible experience. They get to know you and they often recognise repeat customers and great them like buddies. This is the restaurant which I often use to host friends as it has fantastic ambiance. They opened a branch at Gilman Barracks a few years back but that didn't work out. I have also tried other restaurants with this same concept but they don't measure up. So it will be, for many more years, me being back at The Original Brazil Churrasco at Sixth Avenue, because it is the best."
Great Food all you can eat!,"I have reviewed before and nothing has changed except perhaps got better. Fabulous Salad Bar, far more choices than usual. Staff are so very friendly (They need to be, their knives are so sharp!). The meat! Oh the meat! Here is not a suitable place for a vegan. Comes out on spits carved directly onto your plate and it keeps on arriving. Beef Lamb Chicken etc etc if you like meat you will most certainly enjoy, combine it with a selection of their very excellent wine.
My tip: Do not eat anything for a least 12 hours prior."
Best churrasco in town!,The Brazil Churrasco is by far the best churascaria in town. We love to eat there! If you enjoy meat this is the place to be!
Reasonable price and food,Treated my husband to dinner at the restaurant. Service was excellent. Salad bar was well stocked and food was good. I like the beef short ribs and grilled chicken especially. The waiters also sang a birthday song in Portuguese for us. It was a great experience!
"BRAZIL CHURRASCO, SIXTH AVENUE, SINGAPORE","This restaurant is popular with local crowds and serve WESTERN food. The salad is BUFFET style, whereby clients choose the selections of veg from a round section os serving table. The quality of the greens is good and the choice acceptable. The dinners will be offered a small cup of soup of the day. The main course are mainly MEAT (CHICKEN, LAMB, PORK, BEEF, CHICKEN LIVER....) being served via waiters. The serving is repeated, and clients can eat as much as they want. The quality of the meat is acceptable. The wine list is acceptable for normal dinning. Service is good. Seating arrangement is a bit crowded; as the restaurant has limited space. Prices is acceptable. Location is slightly out of the city, but can easily reached by most type of transport. A good place for a mid range meal."
Best Brazillian restaurant in town,"The location of Brazil Churrasco is a little far if you're staying on Orchard but it is well worth the cab ride, not so easy to get a ride back though. The staff seated us very quickly. The restaurant is very clean and not too noisy for the amount of waiters serving. There is a great salad bar but don't eat too much because there are so many meats to choose from. Don't miss the Caipirinha cocktail. Putting it all together; the ambiance, the staff, the delicious food we will definitely return."
Bring an empty tummy,"The meat is cooked beautifully and with fatty, lean, spiced, plain all available,so depending on your palette, there is something there for you.

The only disappointment is the salad bar, it was a little like 'why bother' as the offerings looked as though they had been done under sufferance and with no real effort....they were just as they looked to eat as well!

however meat is the star and that was brilliant...highly recommend it."
High quality!,"We've been visiting these places from Brazil to Dubai and everything in between, so our expectations are usually high.

This place was very good. Service was good, the buffet was good, but not too good, so you could really enjoy the meat.

Service pacing was ok, a bit fast, but again not too fast. They dont provide red/green tags, so everything is offered, but it didnt get pushy.

Quality of the meats was exellent. From chicken to Picanja it was cooked to perfection.

Price is desent, compared to the quality of the foods and service its cheap!

High reconmendation for everybody familiar with the concept."
Lunch,As good or better than any I have been to in South America. Huge salad bar and so so much meat how on earth anyone manages the complimentary ice cream for desert is beyond me. Make sure you are hungry before you go. Worth to visit. Sin $15 from downtown by taxi.
Decent Atmosphere but pricy,"Servers were quick to fill your plate, and they were polite and professional, but it seems to me as they were being polite and professional for the sake of it. With regards to the food, except for the chicken and fish which i find it ok, the rest of the food seemed a bit salty. Even the mushroom soup tasted salty and the cup that holds it is only as big as a wine cup. I have been to neighbourhood western food restaurants and their soup is a lot much nicer then that. I have not tasted brazilian cuisine before, so i am not sure are they really supposed to be a lot more saltier?

The salad, however, was a 5/5 for me which is why i rated food at 4. They have rice, fruits, Fries a lot more and overall, in comparison to other buffets i have been, the salad offering is definitely on par with some of the good buffets i have been. The place was filled with 90+% capacity, ambience is ok and if you would like to celebrate birthdays and stuff like that, i guess its fine provided the price range is ok for you. I do think the price is more on the expensive side though, like low high range."
Best mix of meats and greens,"We arrived very much earlier than our reservation had stated, but the manager welcomed us with open arms. The buffet of salads was a very pleasant surprise, and is bound to please any vegetable lover! The variety of meats was also another pleasant surprise, and the waiter who explained how things worked and the several meat cutters were very friendly and patient when interacting with a first-time customer like me. Just a little note - one should definitely visit this place with a very empty stomach... there are up to 14 types of salad and 10 types of meat waiting to be savoured. This is definitely a place worth returning to!"
Best churrasco in Southeast Asia,"Authentic Brazilian churrascaria in Singapore - great food and great service. Welcomed by a lady staffmember and promptly seated. Went for the $49 all you can eat deal. The buffet has typical Brazilian dishes like aipim frito (fried manioc/cassava) and palmito (hearts of palm, nicely grilled instead of cold). Farofa, feijoada, and caldinho available upon request. Then the meats started coming, including the star cut - the picanha, perfectly salted and grilled Brazilian style with a nice, smoky aroma. There is a reason why churrasco in Brasil is the paixao nacional, national passion because there is an art to grilling the meat, turning it to achieve the perfect temperature. Other cuts were equally delicious - maminha/alcatra, costelinha de boi (beef shortrib), picanha com alho (picanha laced with garlic), coracao/chicken hearts, etc. Pao de queijo was served on the table and two sauces - vinagrete and a sweet mint sauce (presumably for diners who prefer it for their lamb). They even have Guarana Antartica! Excellent service by the passadores/staff including the carioca Brazilian gentleman. The music coming through the soundsystem started off with Spanish guitar instrumentals (including a version of Manolo Escobar's Y Viva Espana) when they first started the dinner service, gradualling changing to Brazilian music including bossa nova (we heard Agua de Beber). Highly recommended, o sabor do Brasil em Cingapura, the taste of Brazil in Singapore - imperdivel - not to be missed - as they say in Brasil"
Superb!,"Was in Singapore to watch ""Air"" in concert on Esplanade with wifey. But we decided to go couple of days earlier and have some Singaporean dishes. Had an idea to have a nice ""meaty"" dinner, so we browsed the internet and found this ""Brazil Churrasco"" place.

First I tought it's a little expensive for a dinner... but when I sat down they just wont stop delivering great food to the table. From Beef Tenderloin, Brisket, to Roast Duck, in total 14 dishes if Im not mistaken. Great Food!

Loved the Tenderloin, Lamb Shoulder, Roast Duck, Chicken Liver, my wife was crazy about their Pinnaple Roast.

Staff was amazing, service was on point, ambience is very nice it's not to stiff like fine and dine spot, but it's not crowded like food court.

It doesn't end there, we had a smoke outside to let the food digest, since it's a LOT of food we ate. So the owner ""Martin"" was smoking outside too, we had a nice chat....
..
.

And our night ended with Martin took us to an authentic Singaporean Bar down at Far East Plaza. Cool guy!"
"Not as good as it used to be, service standards still great","We've been to this place several times over the past 11 years. It's probably the longest surviving and best Brazailian style churrascarria restaurant in Singapore. It's still reasonable value by local standards (the all the meat you can eat buffet is S$49), and they will overwhelm you with meat while you're there. The service standards are really good by local standards. The staff are friendly and very attentive. That's the good part.

So what's the downside?
1. Drinks are starting to get pricey. The Caipirinhas (about S$15 each) seem to have shrunk a bit, and the glass seems to have far too much ice in it. They don't seem as potent as they used to be either (in the olden days back in 2006 two of these would almost knock out the average Singaporean). Still nice, bit not as epically great as they once were.
2. Over-emphasis on less expensive cuts of beef (still nice topside). They only brought us tendeloin/fillet once towards the end of our meal. I don't recall any pork being offered even once.
3. The desert helpings are tiny for the (high) price and they are not included in the buffet.

So, by Singapore standards, I can still rate Brazil Chuuascaro as ""Very Good"" whereas in the past it was ""Excellent"". The service is still excellent, but the food and drink while still acceptable have declined.

Top Tips:
Don't pay for valet parking. Park across the street in the underground car park beneath Guthrie House. Don't bother with the desserts. Expensive drinks."
"True to their stellar reputation, they delivered a brilliant evening.","My partner loves meat, so for his birthday, I thought of bringing him for Churrasco. At first I made a reservation at another Churrascaria restaurant in town, which I've been to a few times. Yet after reading up on handfuls of average or poor reviews of them on this website, I found Brazil Churrasco and visited for the first time this evening!

True to what others have said about the wonderful service, most of the service staff and passadores were friendly and smiley. One lady staff, Maya, who got us seated was very attentive to us. After knowing that it was our first visit to the restaurant, she gave us an introduction to the menu and the extensive salad bar. When I checked the salad bar out, she was there to point out highly recommended dishes and what Brazilians usually have (Garlic rice and beans) I'm just an ordinary guest, but her service made me feel very special.

Other Passadores were also very personable. When I told one of them I was saving my stomach for medium rare meat, it came out almost instantly. When I nodded to one of the server's question about having more pineapples, it came in a snap. These people work very efficiently in a team, even though they do not seem to exchange much words with one another. Tikki, a cheery Brazilian passadore, brimmed with pride when we asked him how long he had been working with the restaurant. ""22 years!"" he chuckled as he went on to serve other guests, flashing his two rows of white teeth all the while. Aeson, a filipino passadore, also chatted with us like old friends.

The salad bar has an extensive range of vegetables from broccoli to fritters. My favourite is the fried kai lan, garlic rice and beans and the banana fritters.

Additionally, the cheese balls were PHENOMENAL and so were the glazed pineapples . A myriad of meats were served- chooks, beef, duck, pork sausages and ham. I'm no rotisseri connoisseur but i found the roasts to be well-salted and nicely done. Beef is my favourite and it was sensational.

To end off the scrumptious meal, we had lava cake. The vanilla ice-cream was very good and so was the moist chocolate cake.

From the service, to the variety and quality, this place makes every dollar worthwhile. Thanks guys, I'll definitely come back! :D

We went there on a Tuesday evening."
Best Brazilian Churrascaria in Singapore,"I have been to many churrascarias, both in Brazil as well as in the US and in Singapore. This place is the best one in Singapore and beats Carnivore hands down. The meats are fresher and better tasting and the service is great. The caipirinhas were nice and the salad buffet had enough variety to complement the several meats that the servers brought to our table."
Just average,"I'll start if by saying the service was really good. The majority of the meat however is just average, and over salted. Perhaps coming from a part of the world where the meat is of high quality my expectations were too high. The pork/ham came off a round processed roll not leg ham. Poor quality cuts of lamb and beef except the beef rib which was good and tenderloin was ok. Chicken was 90% bone and the fish was almost inedible. We have been to many Brazilian BBQs joints around the world and this falls well short unfortunately. Not bad just not great. Harsh but fair"
Meat lovers,"If you like your meat and visit or life in Singapore, this is a must visit. They have a nice salad buffet. And the servers come ate your table with big pieces of meat and slice parts directly on your plate so you get juicy meat. Think of pork, sirloin, chicken, lamb and so on. The sugar pineapple is nice ending to a great meal!"
Excellent !,"This is a restaurant I can strongly recommend. The service, the atmosphere and of course the food. Excellent all of it. The price is what to expect, average Singapore.
It's a bit far away from Orchard road and Clark key, but there is a few taxis in Singapore, so that is a minor problem. The only thing you shoud be aware of, do not go into the "" salat bar "" trap. Bon apetit."
A lovely experience,"I went with my family of four after we had been recommended by my father's friend. A lovely ambience. Staffs were friendly. Excellent service. Location is a little far from Orchard Road. There were a variety of meat and were delicious. But, pork hams were okay and chicken livers tasted weird. The little cheese balls were great as well! Will definitely visit more! :)"
For Beef lovers away from the tourist sites,"Located In 14/16 - 6th Ave - about 10 min from Orchard by Taxi (only 7 to 8 USD)

Nice simple restaurant with a buffet style menu - take the salad from the salad bar as well as the potatoes etc.

served is a small vegetable soup - very tasty (can have second one without extra charge), thereafter the waiters pass by frequently with all kinds of BBQ meat - Lamb, Chicken, Beef, Pork all in various varieties.

Actually it is impossible to leave without having enough.

No fresh fruit juice available, nice desserts like chocolate lava cake or banana with ice cream.

The waiters are very friendly and serving with much attention.

Prices are reasonable

Can warmly recommend this restaurant - the food is really tasty!"
Awesome food and great service,"The meat cuts are great choice and the salad bar with great selection of healthy food.
Ever smiling staffs that alway make me and my group feel right at home.
A place you wanna be to enjoy the meal and friends"
Date night with husband,"Was warmly welcomed when arrived, amazing food salad bar was good but the meat is the main and it was delicious. The wonderful staff are super attentive and always make you feel you're in a Brazilian atmosphere. Will definitely come back and recommend."
Great food and service,"Such fantastic service, so well explained and looked after. It was really impressive. Food was GREAT! A lot of food..... but the variety was awesome."
"If Churrasceria in S'pore, than only these one!","Located away from touri hotspots, at 6th Avenue, we found our place for meet!
For many years, Brazil was and is a must!
Fresh beautiful food, high quality, thats it.
Friendly staff is providing perfect service and let the guests enjoy the stay.
So do not try others, go there..."
The best Brazilian BBQ in Singapore,"Being from southern Brazil I have had BBQ almost at least twice a month over my lifetime. Tell you: This is the closest to the real thing you'll get in Singapore.

The variety of beef isn't what you should look for. The quality of what they offer is the the big attraction. My favourite is the hump, which is better than in most Brazilian places. The black beans (Brazilian staple) are also phenomenal. Courtesy of the resident Brazilian BBQ master and the lovely team that makes everyone feel welcome."
Birthday Dinner,"First time I have been to this restaurant for a long time and I was not disappointed. Service was good the food kept coming.

Meat was very good and the house wine reasonably priced at S$55. I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you want to have a meat feast.

A Carnivore's Delight,"If you are a meat lover like me, look no further... skewers of meat cooked to perfection. Well seasoned, char grilled and yet medium rare... Super scrumptious!

My fave dishes include Topside, Rump steak, Garlic beef and chicken hearts! For a fixed price, you can have as much meats as you can handle plus a good buffet spread of salads and sides!

Save room for dessert, which for me is the grilled pineapples! So sweet and so good!"
Focus on the beef,"Generally it's a decent experience for the price. Obviously they start with a big piece of chicken first (you can't take a small piece, so it's best to pass). The beef comes later - they have five different types of beef, and it's best to take as much as you can as it won't come back. While they have to turn a profit, it would be polite for the beef to come back some of the time. Perhaps I was disappointed because I had high expectations but I have tasted better outside Singapore. There's a good salad bar though. The low ceiling makes it deafening when the restaurant is full."
"Consistent quality, simply the BEST churrascaria in Singapore!","My whole family has been a regular here at Brazil Churrascaria since 2009. Everytime we have birthdays or overseas guests, we bring them here. From then until now, this is still our favorite! We did try other churrascarias but they're not even as close as this. Even our American friends agree this is one of the best churrascaria they've ever tasted. Selections at the salad bar are HUGE, it can satisfy both Western & Asian tastes. Try the banana fritters, Mango salad, fried baby spinach & other spicy mixed veggies which we never found somewhere else. Beware though: the sald bar can fill up your stomach before the meats come! Picanha is still our favorite from the meat selections, but the chicken heart, garlic beef, smoked duck & tenderloins are AWESOME too! Keep up the good work!"
Unexpected Churrascaria,"Sixth Avenue Singapore isn't exactly where I'd have expected to see a Brazilian Churrascaria, but there it is and has been there for over 20 years (apparently).

It's not quite S√£o Paulo's ""Fogo di Ch√£o"" but it does a great job of bringing out course after course of succulent meats, carved from the skewer, straight onto your plate.

And having taken a vegetarian with us (I know, right!!) she was pleasantly surprised to find a lavishly stocked salad bar, overflowing with nice little surprises like seafood of varying types.

It's not fine dining, but for a great night out with friends and a very enjoyable meal, we'll be going again."
Maintaining a high standard for years,"I always find that it is one thing for a restaurant to serve amazing food, it's another to keep doing it consistently. My first visit to Brazil Churrasco was 20 years back and my latest yesterday. The consistency in the quality of meat and the standard of cooking is what keeps me coming back. Never fails to disappoint."
Great Meat,Everybody knows Brazil Churrasco is one of the better Churrasco restaurants in Singapore. I would only like to suggest they train their servers to treat everyone of different races equally.
Delicious brazilian style place,"We had dinner with friends at this place, and it is a traditional Churrascaria. I have been to many brazilian restaurants, in Brazil, Mexico, the US and other LA countries. This is the good stuff, it has a salad table where you can balance your meal with vegetables and other kinds of food, on top of the different kind of meat served by the passadores.
The only reason it does not have 5 stars is that they do not have all sorts of meat. Don't get me wrong, it is enough and the meat is high quality.
We had a great time!"
Ronaldinho Approves!,"If all brazillian food tastes this good, I might be missing out in life. With Brazil Churrasco located at Sixth Avenue, it might not be necessary to hop on-board the next flight to Rio. Excellent variety of beef cuts and other choices of meat like chicken and smoked duck. Beef hump was very tender and beef topside was juicy and lightly marinated so you really get to taste the flavor of the cut. This buffet meal is inclusive of a salad bar. Pineapple was lightly seasoned with cinnamon and sugar glazed, very beautiful and enjoyable. Overall fantastic spread."
A sinnful feast!,"No matter how hungry you are or how much you like meat, this place will totally change your perspective about what ""too much"" means! With about S$40 per person you have unlimited portions of good meat (all possible kinds) and an ala carte buffet with complimentaries. For dinner, try around 6-7 o' clock, it's the best time!"
Excellent,"True Brazilian environment. Great meat, great service and for Singaporean standards fair price. Their Picanha was especially good and so was the caipirinha."
Great for meeting loving family,2nd trip here and just as good as first. More than enough meat and a very decent salad bar too. Ate far too much! Friendly service. Will be back.
meat lovers,need to go if you love meat. nice Brazil restaurant in Singapore. good service. have also a salad bar. and is al you can eat.
Still the best of all the Churrascaria in SG,"I've been coming here since I was 19. It still is the best of its kind of restaurants here in sg. The meats are delectable, the pineapples are always charred just right, and the chicken hearts are little salty charred explosions of flavour in your mouth. The service and excellent and friendly, and their Caprioska are perfectly made. I've been to some of their rival Churrascaria, and although the salad bar pales in comparison cos it's so small (who has salad at these places anyway??!?), everything else is at least 80% better quality. Choose Brazil, nowhere else."
Not just for meat lovers,"Yes, of course they have a great range of meats sliced straight from the skewer to your plate (most delicious rump steak, smoked duck, chicken and more). But I was surprised by the quality and range of the salad bar; I could happily dine on that alone.

I'm sure I visited many years ago, but it feels as fresh and friendly as ever (seems to have had a good refit/renovation in the meantime). The buffet style makes it any ideal venue for friends or colleagues to meet as you can dispense with all the fuss over menus and ordering and get straight down to enjoying yourselves."
Great food and Great Service,"A lovely night out, the food was simply superb and there was a lot of it. I would go back for the salads alone. Although the meat was superb and definitely the highlight. The service was fantastic, this is after all what makes a great meal a terrific meal and here it is done effortlessly and with a smile. We will be back the next time the carnivore in us needs feeding."
Best Churrascaria in Singapore,"Having Brazilian friends, we tried all of them in Singapore and this is surely the best and most authentic one. So now we only visit them when in need of real meat and Brazilian food! They have the best tasting saucy meat, so much choice and coming no stop. The buffet area is also very nice and with much variety to chose from. The waiters: I think they're the best in Singapore, so friendly and smiley, they always prepare for me a more ""well done"" meat when coming to serve it, it feels so nice to be pampered in a restaurant! Thank you guys! The menu has a fixed price and includes the buffet, the meat, some super nice little cheese breads with sauces and a little cup of soup. Don't forget to leave a space in the stomach for their grilled pineapple which is absolutely delicious! Highly recommended!"
Meat heaven for carnivorous,"+ wide variety of cold and hot salad
+ serving up to 10-15 different cuts of meats ranging from beef, pork, chicken, lamb and duck
+ don't forget about their barbecue pineapple, a must!!!
+ friendly Brazilian passadores (meat waiters) coming up to your table carving sumptuous meat
+ request more of your favorite cuts of meat to be serve to you
+ don't forget to try one of the classic drinks caipirinha like a true blue Brazilian

- limit parking space in front of resturant
- don't risk walking in, best to make reservations"
