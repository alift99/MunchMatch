Amazing food as always,"It's always a pleasure to dine in at iO Osteria! Highly recommended to make reservations before you get there as it's almost impossible to get a seat if you attempt to walk-in.

Every item that we had ordered was amazing - in both taste and quality.

As it's busy, it's always difficult to get full attention of the service staff but you can see that they are trying their very best to clear the tables, refill drinks and take orders while having to reset the tables.

Kudos to both culinary and service team for keeping up the standards of this restaurant. So far, haven't been disappointed yet!"
Fast Serving.,Ordered mostly Cheesy and overwhelmed that could not order more to try.Will not order io sparkling water as not suitable to our taste. Food wise got us surprise!
Delicious food,"Waiter had a good grasp of the variety of food on the menu, and recommended accordingly to our group size. Only that we were not aware of the off menu food prices and was quite shocked when we receive the bill."
Diner comfort level can be improve,"The air conditioning is not strong as itâ€™s warm and stuffy around noon. The air circulation was poor causing the food smell to linger around the space. However, the food is great away affordable price."
Crowdedo,I booked for a table for four and was given a table for 12 and I had to share that table with others. Eith the intense crowd and the very poor service there is no way I can enjoy my dinner.
Italian flavors in Singapore,"I am the guest of a Singaporean friend, who brings me there to evaluate, being Italian, howâ€™s the food level. And I have to say that itâ€™s up to the task. We try a few different bites, among which a focaccia romana filled with cheese and black truffles, the well known porchetta (really crispy pork skin!!), and a cold cuts platter with raw ham and some tasty burrata. Followed by an unusual pistachios tiramisu, which I liked, despite being an odd variation of the original recipe. The espresso coffee in ok, nothing memorable but better than the average in Asia.

The place was not overcrowded but rather full, but the service was anyway fast and we didnâ€™t have to wait for our food, so the staff know how to do their job, especially at lunchtime, when you donâ€™t have much time to waste.

Surely worth trying, the food is tasty and fairly close to the Italian original."
Good food but Expensive!,"The restaurant serves good authentic Italian food but their portion is a let down! For the pasta, an adult with three - four scoops can finish it in ten minutes.. so, be prepared to order more food if you are hungry and their prices are definitely expensive consider such kind of location!"
iO Italian Osteria Singapore,The food was good. Authentic Italian cuisine. The menu a bit confusing as there's the paper and QR code menu which are different.
Underwhelming,"Ordered roman bread, burrata, a stuff pork dish, orchiette, risotto, braised beef. For desserts, the cannoli and molten lava cake.
The orchiette was undercooked, the risotto was bland , the beef was not tender and the pork was dry.

The only things that were good was the molten lava cake and roman bread.
Ambience and service is very good.
However quality of food is just not there.
I would only order the desserts and roman bread for takeaway.

Damage for 4 people $ 188"
Iâ€™m back in Italy!,Remind me of my trip to Italy! Food is fabulous. Love the pasta and all the appetisers. Excellent service and voice of the chef in Italian .
Will be back,I came on a Saturday evening so the place was buzzing. Be sure to make your reservations before you come. There is a dining time of 2 hours. Wait staffs were all very friendly and attentive despite the full house. Food was consistently good based on past experiences.
Lovely food and service,"Brought my colleagues to celebrate a birthday over lunch and they were all singing praises about the wonderful food (ordered the seafood platter and tomahawk steak, lamb pasta). Service was excellent as well, very attentive, friendly and efficient. Will be definitely back again soon. Thank you!"
"GREAT FOOD, GREAT AMBIENCE","Settled in a ground to ceiling glass window, expect some sunshine into the restaurant as you sip your wine or coffee with the delicious food served from IO. This time round, I had a chance to savor their in house baked - Stracchino with cream truffle. The flat bread is light and crispy but still with some density, goes perfectly awesome with the cream truffle mushroom. I wished I had a 2nd piece or 3rd one. We ordered a seafood pasta shared among 4 of us. The seafood pasta was served in a big bronze pot. The pasta with creamy and tasty with lots of fresh seafood such as squid, big prawns, mussel, clams. Next we ordered a grilled fish served with some greens. The fish was very nicely grilled with charred crispy skin and the meat was flaky white, sweet and succulent. This session gives me another spectrum of eating an Italian meal. Explore their menu and enter the world of Italian cusine more than just a stanard pizza and pasta. You should really go and try, great food, great service, fast serving at affordable price."
Anniversary Dinner,The restaurant has a very pleasant environment and service staff very extremely helpful and friendly. Food was great and dining experience was good. Will be looking forward for a return visit. Thanks!
Fantastic Food and Good vibes,The food was so good. Worth the price. The ambience was nice although it was slightly stuffy. We feedback to the staff but they said that it's an issue that they deal with constantly.
authentic home cooked italian food,absolutely love the stuffed roman schiacciata! lovely authentic italian food and efficient service. gets awfully crowded so reservations are necessary. only downside are the small portions - could be a little more generous given the price. highly recommended!
Wrong Crowds,"Been here few times because the service and food were good. But the tables were too close to each other and if you happened to seated next to a big table, you could hear their loud conversations and I even could see the lady next to me, who did not shave her armpits, raised her hand and taken a selfie of their group. So you could imagine how my experience was. Definitely not a place for a couple who tried to be there for a relaxing meal."
best value italian meal in SG!,"always a great meal at IO osteria, service was super fast and food is amazing everytime. the lamb ragu, pizzas and schiaccato stands out the most"
As alwaysâ€¦ðŸ’¯,"We have always been coming to this restaurant ever sinceâ€¦ every time we have guests coming to visit Singapore, itâ€™s always a must for us to bring them here..what makes the food even better is the service that we get from their staffs, especially Leah, she/they are always attentive and approachable. Weâ€™ll definitely coming back! Our favourite is the schiacciata bread with truffle."
Like Being Back In Italy,"The taste of the food that we ordered took me back to Italy. While good Italian food can be found in most Asian countries, nothing can beat Italian food in its home country. iO Italian Osteria manages to offer Italian food as if one were dining in Italy itself.

The ambiance of the place is a perfect balance for semi-formal occasions to gatherings for family and friends. My group of three was seated at cozy corner of the restaurant.

Our meal of Porchetta (baked pork belly, wild fennel), Lasagna (baked Grandma style), Garganelli in slow-braised lamb ragout with lentils and the 4 types of pizza was marvelous.

For dessert, we opted for the Sicilian cannoli with ricotta filling. The restaurantâ€™s signature tiramisu would have been a safe choice but itâ€™s almost impossible to find delicious cannoli away from Italy. We were blown away by the soft ricotta cheese.

The gelato that was on the house on the occasion of my spouseâ€™s birthday was a thoughtful gesture. We appreciate it a lot. And yes, the gelato is worthy of its name.

On the prices, they wonâ€™t burn a hole in the pocket and thatâ€™s coming from me being a visitor to Singapore. Itâ€™s best to make reservations as my local host did. Weâ€™ll definitely return to this restaurant when we visit Singapore again."
"Good food, nice ambience",Enjoyed the authentic Italian food there. A bit pricey but the food is of a good quality. Do remember to book early as it is rather crowded in the evening.
Good food,Place was crowded when we arrived but food was served fast and great! One order was missed out for the but came quite quickly after it was highlighted. Good experience for a big group of 10 of us.
Great food!,"My friends and I went for dinner last Saturday. It was really crowded, but we did get our table quite fast and we able to order the food pretty quickly. The only issue was our appetiser came after we had finished our soup and pasta! Lucky it was pochetta."
Impressive food!,We were there to celebrate my son's birthday. We heard so much of this place and were not disappointed.
A taste of Italy in Singapore,"Went there for a family lunch and the dining experience we had exceeded all expectations. In fact, this little gem is one of the best Italian restaurant that I have been to in Singapore.

Service: 10/10
Food quality: 10/10
Value for money: 10/10

Seeing that it was lunch time in the middle of the week, the place was packed.

Would go there again even if it is a bit off the beaten track for me."
Amazing,"Delicious and authentic Italian food, at a reasonable price. The service was great even though the restaurant was full house. Thoroughly enjoyed the dinner with my family and will definitely be coming back again!"
Can do better,Music played was way too loud. Bacon was burnt. Ordered 3 medium-rare steaks but came well-done. Served espresso ice-cream that came with the lava cake to my 12 years old.
"Hearty menu, fast service, and a taste that stands out.","Have been to all sorts of Italian places here, but this is quite unique. There's a lot of hearty things on their menu that I haven't seen in other places like their schiacciatas and exciting pasta combinations. We had the truffle schiacciatas and tragliolini with prawn--most tables did.

And they make it well too. Seasoning is perfect and the food comes piping hot. Their porchetta is not dry at all and their gelatto is just wild.

For me, best Italian I've had in Singapore."
excellent food,"2nd time here and the food is still wonderful, the stuffed roman bread is still fantastic, we tried the saffron sauce pasta for the 1st time and it was quite delightful. baked eggplant was on point and the braised beef was good but out of all the amazing food, this was the least wow, but still very good. PLEASE OPEN A BRANCH IN THE EAST OF SINGAPORE!!!"
Great Place for Family Celebration,"Went there for daughterâ€™s 22 birthday. Could tell that it was a popular place as it was crowded. Food was excellent (just check Google reviews on what to order). Although it was busy lunchtime, wait staff were attentive. Price was reasonable for the quality you get. There was a great wine selection and my hubby actually made a booking for his wine kakis on the same day."
Awesome experience,"It was a good lunch. Food was good, environment was good. Service by crew is excellent. Waiting time for food is optimal as the restaurant is well staffed. Staffs know their stuffs well."
IO Never Fails.....,"The food is good and it's recommended that you share the food. This way, you'll be able to try a wide variety of items. IO never fails and we are always back for the food. Service was good too. The atmosphere is nice but it tends to get noisier in the evening as it is busy."
Too busy??,"This restaurent is very popular- it filled up very quickly, with enthusiastic hungry guests. We felt like enjoying only their yummy appetisers. The Seafood guazzetto soup stew was full bodied and delicious. The Stuffed Roman schiacciata was crispy and tasty.
Their signature Porchetta with wild fennel was tasty but itâ€™s skin was not crackly crispy enough today. The Burrata with Parma Ham was good. Service was rather impersonal."
Dinner at IO,Delicious & awesome food and drinks. But the service crew have a difficulty in understand our requests.
Disappointing experience,"Went for an early family dinner and were advised upon entry that the table would be needed back after 1hr (despite having a reservation).
Restaurant was not even half full, but we had to ask several times before our order was taken.
Food (assorted pizza, pasta, bruschetta ) arrived after (too?) short waiting time.
Before the pandemic, we used to patronise this place frequently, and had good memories of fresh, tasty and delicious food. This time, neither food taste nor service quality could catch up with that.
Not an overwhelming experience and disappointed about the overall drop of quality.
Donâ€™t think weâ€™ll come back any time soon."
Worth The Squeeze In!,"My first visit to this restaurant was recommended by my brother who went with his boss initially...

It was an Easter long weekend lead up to Hari Raya Puasa and the restaurant was almost full even at 6pm!

Initially we tried to make a reservation by phone and was told fully booked.

However the family suggested going earlier and see whether we could get seats and finish our dinner quickly before dinner reservation timings...

On arrival we were told fully booked again until we mentioned that we just have a quick dinner and if a table is available...

The Manageress came after being referred by reception and told us we can have an hour to have dinner.

We were very appreciative of this gesture and we were then shown to our table.

What surprised us was not just squeezing us in without a reservation but also given us a table by the window!

We ordered the Beer Braised Beef with Mashed, PotatoesBaked Lasagna â€œGrandma"" Style, Handmade Raviolacci, Beef Filling, Marsala Sauce, and Porchetta Baked Pork Belly Wild Fennel...

The Beer Braised Beef melts in the mouth and simply delicious! The Porcghetta Baked Pork Belly Wild Fennel also known as Char Siao Ba was definitely my favourite! The Lasagna though delicious, was a bit too mushy...

All im all a pleasant meal and the price was quite reasonable.

Service wise, apart from the greeter at the door who was a tad cold, the wait staff were very friendly, helpful and attentive. Food was served relatively fast as well...

We managed to finish our dinner in 50 mins and made it out before the dinner crowd came in!"
Exquisite Italian food with quality servicee,"Have been here multiple times.need to reserve a place ahead as it's popular. And deservedly so. Excellent taste, fast service and am amazing selection of aperitifs and other drinks. They have a vegetarian menu on their website."
Disappointed this time,I love this restaurant and frequently patronize it. However this time I was disappointed. I was there around 4pm.The veg pizza given was not fresh. I did not highlight as I was with a guest. I really hope this restaurant maintains its standards.
First visit to iO Italian Osteria,"Saw good reviews and decided to try out this place with my family. Service was fast n staff were friendly. Overall food is nice and of good size. We tried Stuffed Roman Schiacciata, Orecchiette with saffron sauce, beer braised beef, porchetta and seafood guazzetto. We ended dinner with Pistachio Tiramisu and dark chocolate lava cake. Will visit again to try out other dishes."
First Visit to IO Italian Osteria,"Excellent food and good service. We would recommend the Porchetta, Schiac Truffle and their Special Dessert. We will be back in the future."
Great Italian food in the suburbs,"This time for dinner, the restaurant is as popular as lunch time. Reservations is a must or come early! The food is still very good. From the small bites to pasta and seafood platter all tasted yum! The tiramisu is also good and popular. Price is affordable, environment is bistro style while the service is generally good. The teamwork is noticeable."
Good food and pricing,"Nice food, tables are a little small and seats aren't the best, plus other patrons tend to come within 1m distance due to proximity of tables."
Pleasant Dinner experience,"Although with booking, when we reached still need to wait for around 10mins for someone to assist us on booking and they realized they don't have my booking. After showed them my email then we are allow to enter."
"The octopus was terrible, service terrible, burrata small.","The octopus was terrible, burrata was really small, the service was terrible. The restaurant was really fully, I used to go there always but last time my friends and me didnâ€™t like it. The waitress didnâ€™t have patience and we need to eat fast."
Tasty food & great service!,"The homemade tagliolini & stuffed Roman schiacciata were delectable (almost ordered the wrong one, but luckily the staff asked if I wanted the truffle bread)! The porchetta was slightly too salty, but we enjoyed it for the tender meat and crispy skin. Service was great, our waitress was attentive and friendly (the cashier even check if we had umbrellas after payment, coz it was pouring outside). Went there with my family during weekday off-peak for a late lunch, so we almost had the whole restaurant to ourselves!"
A bustling Italian restaurant in Hillview,"This is a lively, bustling restaurant that fill you with a party mood as you steps in.

It was a busy Saturday evening. Even though we had arrived quite early in the evening (around 6.30pm) it was already packed.

We ordered our usual favourites. The porchetta pork belly had a crunchy skin but tender meat (with soft guilty fat). The tagliolini prawns pasta was delicious but such small servings and likewise the rectangular mushroom and ham pizza.

Our favourite for the evening was the pistachio tiramisu which was quite special.

Overall a vibrant place with good food."
A gem of a restaurant in the middle of Singapore!,"This is a gem of a restaurant in the middle of Singapore. Tucked away from the city center, nestled among apartment blocks is a serene and cosy place where one can find cafes, fast food joints, supermarket and this little Italian restaurant. Popular and has a crowd of customers. Open kitchen and cosy sittings. The food is also good tasting. Specials change weekly. Ordered a couple of small bites to share and test. Their crispy pork, meatballs ragu was yum! The truffle bruschetta was excellent and pork pasta was lovely. Burrata with Parma ham and salad was good too. I could observe from different tables customers were enjoying their food. Pistachio tiramisu was one of the best I tasted. Price was mid to high. Environment is cozy and eclectic. Service was good and can see good teamwork."
delicious as always!,"we have been to iO many times now. My husband and I made the decision to celebrate our wedding anniversary there this year. Food was always tasty and on point each time we go. I rarely drink alcohol because of its bitter taste. So, if you are like me, you can order the Moscato to pair with whatever yummy main course you get! Looking forward to try as much of their menu in future.

Must have:
- Porchetta, Baked Pork Belly
- Pistachio Tiramisu"
Fantastic!,"Food was excellent and fantastic service! The crew were attentive and very quick. Definitely worth the trip and will dine there, again!"
DELICIOUS ITALIAN FOOD,"While it is a bit out of normal path, we do not regret our decision to try this restaurant. I did not.have such a great octopus in a long time. The starters and the pizza were good too and we even bought some to go at the take out counter. While the restaurant was packed and busy, we still had a great and friendly service. To avoid any disappointment make sure you book your table well in advance."
Meal @ iO IOS,"The place was crowded. When first entered, all staff were busy n there was a queue outside. As I hv made reservation, I was trying to see how to get in. Took a while when we finally got a table. The waitress service was good so somehow covered for the earlier inconvenience. Overall was good n will be back."
"Poor service ,, even I had called up earlier about being 15 late ,, We were made to 30 mins out side with no communicati",Made to wait 30 mins without any reason reason Avg food & served cold Too crowded Seriously service was bad
Great service and Reasonable prices,"We had a great waiter who was very friendly and helpful. We had a full course meal at a little more than 100 dollars and that included drinks. The seafood platter and soup were both full of fresh and tasty seafood. The bread bin was filled with different yummy bread and the olive oil given was generous and of great quality. Then we ended our meal with the pistachio tiramisu on the house because it was my friends bday. Very good quality, no wonder it was filled with people. If you want a romantic quiet place to talk, this is not the place and if you want good food and great service, then this is the place to be."
Good food and good service,Food was excellent as usually. Saw lots of new faces in the kitchen but the quality of food remains the same. Service by Jason was great
Wonderful dinning experience,Staff are friendly and very helpful. Grateful that staff helped us managed the order. Food were great. Had great bonding time with friends
excellent food excellent service,"We were a party of 4. We were initially given a table next to the window which had the afternoon sun shining in. The service staff went out of their way to accommodate our request for a table away from the window. Our lunch menu consisted of pizza, baked pork belly, beer braised beef, grilled farmers' salad. Apart from the beef which did not taste exceptional, the rest of the dishes were excellent.
We were a party of 4. given a table"
Good food but..........,"Food was good. However, we were asked to settle the bill and leave after only an hour during lunch was a put-off. Such dining restrictions should be made known to patrons at the point of reservation."
Service can be improved,"Dishes are average but what threw us off was the bad service. The Philippino and Malay female staff who served us could not even prepare a lava cake for birthday celebration. They asked multiple times infront of the guest who was having her birthday today. Not to mentioned, birthday celebration was already indicated on the booking note and while thereâ€™s no complementary cake served. We expect the staff to at least be less annoying when we order a cake requesting for a candle on it. Horrible experience, just donâ€™t go here for special occasions."
Wonderful place to enjoy food,"Very impressed with the food, service from Alex and the environment. Definitely my top 1 choice to go for Italian food !"
Lunch at IO,"IO Italian Osteria lunch. Visited at 1:30, order sea salt grilled fish and seafood linguini, good choice"
Pizza lost the shine,"Use to like the square-sliced pizza & schiacciata. But now, it turns tough when cold. However the square-sliced shape is still a great size for easy bites. Pasta lacks the olive-oil smoothness. It sticks together when left cold. But it still as tasty though."
Everything great except one thing again,"food & price are excellent Service is well prepared. But Receptionist and cashier look rough manners. It made me very frustrated when i paid bill. She just chatted with her collogue when I was on making payment. and there was no any simple comments(ex thanks or thank you) and throw invoice out.
This is not a first time. but whenever I came here, these things happened again and again"
Friday Night,"Good food, good service, I should have listened to the waiter (Jason) on serving size for the pizza [oops] but it all turned out well!"
Nice birthday celebration with a friend,"We ordered the

Starters
- Porchetta (Must have!!!)
- Burrata w Parma Ham, Rucola, Cherry Tomatoes

Mains
- Handmade Raviolacci w Beef Filling, Marsala Sauce
- Risotto w Hazelnuts etc etc

Dessert
- Lemon Meringue Pie
- Black Forest Cake
+ Btl of Chardonnay

Service:
Was lovely, Jason was very attentive to us, he made sure we felt right at home and attended to all our questions and was very professional in his service. 10/10!

Ambience:
The restaurant was quite crowded on a Thursday evening surprisingly, many replied to my instagram stories and they also chimed in that it was indeed a good place to dine at.

Food:
- I felt that the portion for the pastas were quite small for a pretty steep price. Even after eating half the risotto for my friend along with my entire pasta, I still felt that I was quite hungry (But I'm not a huge appetite person/ big eater.)
- Dessert was lovely. My friend thoroughly enjoyed the black forest cake. I enjoyed the Tart. It was pretty steep for dessert as well but didn't mind as the dessert portion was quite big actually.
- The starters were the highlight though.

Thank you so much for the nice visit!"
Dinner on a Monday,"Their dishes are yummy and servers are helpful and friendly. Ordered the Traditional Stuffed Roman Schiacciata (Truffle), Porchetta Baked Pork Belly with Wild Fennel and Homemade Tagliolini Prawns Asparagus Lemon with Aromatic Breadcrumbs, none of it was a regret. Recommend to make a reservation before heading to the restaurant."
Lunch with fren,Love the ambient & food. The staff are helpful when needed help in recommendation for food especially the counter staff with gd personality & cheerful. Love their desserts too. Will definitely go bk for meals.
Bad service,"All I wanted was a nice meal on a Friday night but it was spoilt because of the bad system/ service.
Resvn was made but they kept letting those on waiting list in before me.
Will think twice before patronising again even though the food is good . Service plays a part too."
Amazing Italian food,We went there during lunch and had some excellent Italian dishes. Was surprised to find cannoli and was just like what we had in Sicily in 2019. The service by Jason was top quality. Will go back again. Keep us the good work guys.
Excellent service and food!,Food was true to its description. Price is reasonable. Service is exceptional! It's quiet and cosy. Their specials was mouth-watering. Negroni was strong and not diluted. Lasagne sheets were made from scratch
Meet our very high expectation,"We went with a high expectation coz itâ€™s quite far and we heard many good comments. The food was really good, even for common dishes like pasta and pizza. The price is very reasonable. recommend for a chilling out dinner on weekend!"
Great food,"Had to wait for quite awhile before we are being seated despite no people infront of us. Their pizza is quite a huge portion, can be shared by 2-4 pax. I love their potato and onion soup - really delicious! The pasta amatriciana and pistachio tiramisu are just average - there's better options out there. Service is not bad.
Will definitely come back again."
Loving the food,I was never disappointed with the food every time I had visited. Travelled across Singapore to have a definite good dining experience with my fam
Nice place,Gd value for money in terms of value and ingredients . Gd recommendation of red wine for my friends.
cheerful environment,the eating place and people around are cheerful and glad while dining. staff are friendly. food are good.
Nice ambience and food is average,"A very nice ambience restaurant and good for Instagram photoshoot. Food is average (my opinion is only applicable to the items which I ordered). Pork belly was crispy but a bit dry. Pizza, the crust was a bit hard (for me), and too salty. Stuffed Roman Schiacciata was good."
Still my fav italian restaurant,"Vibes are perfect, really rustic and feels authentic (obviously, ive not been to italy hahha). Just that this place got really popular over the years and its hard to dismiss the feeling of being rushed whenever i dine there, with waiters very promptly clearing your empty plates and pacing next to you waiting for you to leave. Otherwise, really good food for the prices."
Good homely Italian Food,"Cosy restaurant with good comfort Italian Food & good service. The Orecchiette, pork sausages in saffron sauce is SIMPLELICIOUS!!"
Everything great except one tihng,Food is excellent. Reception service need to be improving. i book 01:00PM but their time was wrong @6PM. But reception does not present any excuses. a bit frustrated.
Great quality of food!,"We had a reservation booked through Chope for 8pm. Arrived punctually but was told to wait outside and they'll get us shortly. We waited for exactly 40mins before getting our table and felt that this was slightly upsetting since we've made a reservation in advance.

Food was great as usual, especially the pasta and seafood platter. Will come back again but hope that the seatings will be improved."
Awesome gem in the west,"I love the food here- we had the traditional stuffed Roman schiacciata(cheese truffles bread), beef braised beef ending off with an awesome tiramisu !!! The waitressss are so friendly and nice!! Sinn gave us a quick walkthrough of the menu and Tiska is a wine expert. She gave us a profile of the wine . She is so knowledge and her nice personality draws us to her :) we would come again just to visit these two ladies! My fiancÃ© and I really love this place though itâ€™s our first visit. Will be back for more"
Business lunch,Food is good and service is friendly. Will bring business friends here for lunch again. Highly recommended
Delicious food and great ambience,"We had the chef's special pizza (4 cheese), porchetta, baked eggplant and grilled ribeye. All the dishes tasted amazing. The restaurant was also crowded when we arrive. We were lucky we had a reservations. Would definitely come back again!"
Excellent Food,The staffs are friendly and the food are very nice. Love the whole ambiance and setting. Great for casual dining and noisy gatheringâ€¦.
Good excerpt for a service blip,"Our family booked for 8pm on the eve of Hari Raya. We arrived early and were admitted at about 7:45pm. The service staff were very attentive and very prompt with requests and taking orders. Food was served promptly and quality was good. I would have given 5 stars except for a service blip. At about 8:25pm, we were asked if we had ordered our dessert and when we told the staff that we had already done, we were given the bill straightaway and was told that there were groups waiting to be seated at 8:30pm. When I looked around, there were groups that were there way before us yet they weren't told to leave before 8:30pm to make way for other groups. I thought they could manage this better knowing which the arrival timing of the groups. The other thing i found a little uncomfortable was the seating arrangement, I thought it was way too crowded and tables were placed too close to each other at this time of the COVID-19 issue."
Nice restaurant,"Good service, great ambience, food was served fast. Enjoyed the food and will return again to try more dishes!"
Good food n service,Went for lunch n from the moment we were shown our table to the time we left the service was attentive n polite. The food was well made n tasty
Very patchy service especially from the hostess,"Upon arriving , restaurant was not full, the lady hostess asked us to come in and take the temperature, she was busy with other guests paying and we just stood there and wait .. wait and waited then the man next to him attended to another guests that come after us till we said we are waiting table for two
Food is ok, just the service, always patchy
Our second visits
May not want to visit again , just so the neighbourhood here has limited eatery"
Very nice and enjoyable meal,"Finally get to visit and try the food after reading quite a bit about this place. Very happening place indeed. The food and service is good. We love the place, enjoyed all the items we ordered and most of all were blessed by the great company, love and friendship of our closest buddies over a birthday celebration meal."
great experience,"super tasty food, good service, nice ambiance. slow cooked beef was very tender, bread staffed with truffles fantastic."
Never disappoints..relaxed delicous dinner,Alex and his staff elevated a lovely dinner...we've always enjoyed dining at Os. Always order their mixed pizza cos always too much so my husband can enjoy leftovers:) and the ribeye with rosemary potatoes with a lush Tuscany red...mmmm. Expresso gelato is very naughty and nice..complimentary digestivo limoncellos like we had in Italy...brilliant!
4 stars if you're local; 3 stars if you need a 20 min drive,"There's a lot of hype about this restaurant that gets you excited. If you're driving in from Central, then you have high expectations. But you get a fairly standard 4-star dining experience - plenty of similar options closer to home. Ok, that said, this is nonetheless a terrific Italian restaurant - all the basics (pizza, pasta, etc.) but also side dishes like potatoes, salads and even octopus with an Italian touch. It's a bit pricey but that's to be expected in this upscale neighborhood for a restaurant in a lofty, industrial feel. The dining staff were polite, friendly and responsive. Food was good, just not great - in fact, a little bland for what I expected. So, a good restaurant that I question whether it's worth a 20 min or longer drive to experience."
A wonderful meal experience!,"This is a happy place! Popular, high energy, bright and cheerful. We ordered a few dishes, tried out our struggling Italian language with the Manager, and were delighted that Alex was game enough to engage us in his Native language! The service and meal experience was most pleasant. We loved their Porchetta, Orecchiette- little round pasta discs with creamy pork sausage, saffron sauce.
We enjoyed their stuffed light crunchy warm Schiacciata and loved their wonderfully moist and perfectly balanced Pistachio tiramisu . Their Lasagna and Burratta were also appreciated. My friends were so delighted they will bring their families to dine here. Park at level 2 as there are more lots there."
Happy Bellies!,Food was great and the serving sizes were adequate. service staff were almost flawless and made everyone at the table comfortable with great attention to details.
Get-together lunch,"We ordered bread, pasta and steak for 5-pax sharing as recommended by a staff. The portions were small. Bill per person was $65. We didn't even order wine or beer. Looking at printed menu, we would be better off ordering individually. Shouldn't have listened to staff's advice!"
Food was good service was not,"We made a reservation for 8.15pm but were only seated at 9pm because ""those who had a reservation still had to be on a waiting list"". What's the point of making a reservation?"
Excellent food,"Love their homemade pasta so much, cooked al-dente and flavourful. Order four dishes and finish with empty plate."
Great Food but Room For Improvement,"My girlfriend and I ordered the Bruschetta with Ham and Cheese (it was really tasty but much, much larger than expected), Burrata (super good), Orecchiette with Saffron Sauce (perfect pasta and deliciously rich sauce), Linguine with Prawns and Lemon (the best thing that evening), Braised Beef (the only disappointing thing that day) and finished off with the lemon sorbet.

If you're looking for a high class dining experience, this is not the place as it can get rather noisy when the restaurant is full. However, the service was spot on and the dishes and specials are great!"
Scrumptious Food & Great service,"Definitely requires a booking prior to your visit as the place seems pretty packed even on weekdays! Food selections were great and service was wonderful. Staffs were prompt on taking orders, sending food and checking on us. We ordered the Burrata, Lasagna, Prawn Pasta and Cuttlefish. Nothing negative to say about any of the items we ordered. All tasted great and definitely will come back again"
Feedback,Good food and friendly staffs. Only that this round the octopus is much smaller. It would be better if the price of the food is reduce.
Most affordable authentic Italian pizza,"The place is very Italian. From the location to the food quality. All very good. The pizza is not the classic round thin pizza, but rather a thicker cut with all the delicious toppings you can dream of. One portion can fill you up already and itâ€™s so cheap. Highly recommended."
