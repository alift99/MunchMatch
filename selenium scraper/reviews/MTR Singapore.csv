South Indian Vegetarian üå±,"The food is top notch. The flavour n aroma of the dishes are authentic. Recommend others to go on weekday and do a take away. Had a meal on weekend and it was overwhelming crowded and long queue. After having our table, it seems like all the service staff was waiting for us to finish our food so that the next patron could seat. It‚Äôs that popular. If you don t fancy that kind of stress it is best to do a takeaway but yes will come here again and again. Luv the food."
Superb south indian delicacies,"Not as good as the one in Bangalore, of course, but overall excellent food. Had rava idli, poori saagu, pudi Idli, Masala dosa and coffee. Loved it."
Utterly overrated,"I just don't understand why this place is so popular. I'm a big fan of South Indian food and of about 70 different places in Singapore (mainly in Little India) over the years where I have had some combination of idlis, dosais, and vadai, I would rank this one at about #50.
I had idlis and vadai this morning.
The sambar was like something you'd make by just adding water to a sambar mix and heating it up - very grainy, and a really rough, and not particularly pleasant, taste. The green chutney was OK, although quite bland. The idlis themselves were OK, not great - probably the most acceptable part of the meal. The vadai were really fresh but Oh my God, so, so greasy.
It wasn't the worst experience of my life. But, the pricing was full, and, come on guys, this place does not rate."
Nice and authentic Indian Taste,"Much needed in Singapore. Do visit if you want authentic Bangalore taste. Staff are courteous, do visit during weekend, though busy, good food."
Our second visit and still delicious,We came to MTR on our last trip to Singapore a few years ago and decided to visit again this time... we were not disappointed! The food is still delicious and the staff is very friendly. A must!
MTR is a Tourist Trap - Very high Prices - Prices Double of other South Indian Cuisine places in Little India Market,"Tourist trap ! High prices, poor service, poor taste !!! Just ripping off the MTR brand !

BEWARE - The MTR restaurant MENU does not have prices listed and you get the prices only when the bill comes

stay away and better visit the other dozens of authentic chef run, specialist, food made with LOVE and SKILLs - South Indian places in Little India"
Phenomenal food,"Incredible and authentic South Indian food! Their dosas were incredible, the idlis were soft steamy and absolutely delicious. And lovely mango Lassi!"
Best Indian Vegetarian food in Singapore!,"I have stopped visiting my favourite restaurants since a friend recommended MTR. This restaurant along Serangoon Road serves the tastiest, most mouth watering and addictive vegetarian food in Singapore. The pudi masala dosa is light, fluffy and crispy. The maddur vadai is fragrant with fennel and other spices. Lovely as a snack! My friend loved the rava idly. The variety is astounding. It is also great that they have descriptions of what they offer on a screen so non-Indians can learn about the cuisine and difference between neer and ragi dosa. Everything I have tried is delicious!"
Very average fare,"The quality has really gone downhill. While standard items like rava idli, kaara bath are as expected, the kesari bath, masala dosa and neer dosa were disappointing and the coffee was downright terrible. The standards of cleanliness and service have also deteriorated compared to my last visit 3 years back. There are far superior vegetarian restaurants like Nalan just up the street."
Loved the Dosa and Dessert,We went to this place for the first time and loved the crispy dosa and the Indian dessert. Excellent place for good Indian meal. Reasonable price.
"Rude, Arrogant, child intolerant staff..","Seated after 25 minutes of wait, our first time at this restaurant was supposed to be a nice little lunch family get together.
At the table, the staff warned that the child is not supposed to fiddle with the tissue paper boxes on the table, we tried our best to restrain but the child would not listen. We assured the staff that if the child wastes any tissues we accept to pay for the same. If taken away, the child will cry. But, the boxes were snatched from the child to our dismay.
Have seen/heard staff treating customers badly but snatching things from a child is a first!
This is invasion of personal space of the child and is nothing short of an harassment. The staff did not have any rights to confront a child to say the least, despite we assuring that we will pay for the tissue papers if at all that was the concern! Is this the example we as an adult would set for the child? Absolutely NO. We decided to walk away from the restaurant, hungry, with the child crying.
MTR's reputation is what these staff's pride upon, but is it worth the insult? There are better (child tolerant) options elsewhere.
Wonder if other customers are also treated this way, if so, this place is a disgrace to MTR franchise and the warm and embracing South-Indian culture!!"
"Hair bits in ""Saagu""","Visited MTR Singapore after a long time in early March this year. It very clean and food was tidily plated. Kept visiting MTR during our stay and observed gradual decline in standards of hygiene and cleanliness. Finally, on the 18th of April, Rava Idly with side of ""Saagu"" was served with little bits of hair along with one long strand. Brought it to the waiter's attention, who quickly swept up the plate and took it away, before I could stop him to take a picture. He came back asking if he could serve anything else, but we were too nauseated to eat anything more there."
Dont do home delivery,"We have been eating at this place for 4 years now- at the least twice a month and sometimes more. In the last 6-8months we started ordering home delivery because the line up system outside the restaurant is just nothing less than CHAOS.
1. We realised that they have started to become dodgy with the portion sizes. It all depends on who decides to pack the meal and what mood they are in.Some days a sambar, for example will come in a small container, some days it will be medium or large- THE PEICE WILL NEVER CHANGE! Just the size! If your lucky, u get the large‚Ä¶
2. If you order 2 of the same items, again lets say sambar- they will just decide to combine the 2 serves into 1 container without asking if you actually want it that way.
I bought food for my work college and myself, we dont want to eat out of the same container so why are you stupidly assuming that you can combine it and then try to justify to me that the one large is equal to 2 smalls.
3. When I say justify, i truly mean it- if you call the restaurant back and are lucky to get one of the men- he will start giving you packet measurements in grams and your head off in order to avoid a refund.
4. If your even more unlucky and get the women- JUST HANG UP AND SAVE YOURSELF!
She is the rudest and most hopeless one of all.
She will talk back and talk over you, will not listen to anything and also decide to hangup on you midway through your sentence!!

Extremely disgusting and disappointing service!"
Authenticity of South Indian Cuisine in Singapore!,Visited MTR for lunch on a working day today. Glad we reached there at 1230 for we got our desired table for two instantly. Minutes later we could see the ever growing line of loyal customers grow longer & longer. The secret clearly was the absolute ‚Äú authenticity‚Äù to South Indian cuisine maintained at very reasonable price. We had to have Masala Dosas for sure and opted for Vada Sambar and Filter coffee. Each item was mouth-wateringly authentic! Most definitely will return.
Very good vegetarian restaurant,"The restaurant entrance is simple and has 2 saloons, The staff is very attentive and well trained, they come check many times along the meal.Sometimes a bit slow in bringing plates and replace water bottles but overall, better than most of Singaporean restaurants. They look to check if someone is to ask something. The food was very good. We had a mini-meal and a dough soaked in a curry. We can taste 3 different kinds of rice in the mini-meal, plus it is a very fulfilling meal... price is reasonable also. Recommend if you want to go for a vegan meal."
"Crispy, Savoury, Melt-in-your mouth Dosa!","My absolute go-to place for Dosa. They are generous with ghee thus the piping hot dosa arrives to the table crispy, every time. With daily menu specials, you will never get bored eating at MTR as they have so many various options to try out. Each meal was satisfying and leaves you craving to come back for more. Highly recommend anyone and everyone to try, at least once. No regrets!"
Indulge@MTR Singapore,"Most authentic South Indian menu, must try my favourite - rasam vada, rava idli, masala dosa, bisi bele bath, end with a cup of filter coffee. Now, that's called Satisfaction !"
Mouth Drolling Dosa,"Amazingly Luscious Food. I went there with my Family and we were there for 2-3 times. We enjoyed our every order. The different styles of Dosa, Uttapam, Coffee everything was mouth watering. And the atmosphere was also very nice for the entire family. We would like to visit there again, if, we ever visit Singapore in future."
Casual lunch,"The food is good, and the service is satisfactory. The only issue is the ordering process. The cash counter is at the entrance and you need to order the food and pay before are seated. The causes a bit of a bottle neck as the customers are waiting in line as some customers who are not familiar with the menu will take more time to order. They have the menus with pictures of the food to identify and are huge binders. MTR Has spent good money to produce them. Instead, they should have some sort of a terminal at the table to order and pay so that the customer can sot at the table first and order at their pace. If there use terminals, it will be easy to change and produce those expensive menu binders."
Good and tasty Rava Dosa,"This was my second visit to MTR Restaurant and am impressed by the their strict observance of the heightened alert phase 3 sitting arrangements as well as temperature taking and Trace Token measures.

Easy to get here as it is just 2 bus stops after Tekka Market and opposite the Sri Srinivasa Temple. If taking the North East line, alight at Farrer Park Station and take exit G.

We ordered 2 Rava Dosa and 1 chow chow bath and 2 Masala teas. We really enjoyed the paper thin Rava Dosa served with a warm sambar sauce and minty sauce. The chow chow we ordered consists of 2 items - a sweet dessert made from semolina and milk, and the other a savory item.

Place is very hygienic though service is spotty. It took 3 reminders before our masala teas were served. The food is good and for an early evening, it was well patronised."
Hearty Dinner,"We ordered food tonight from MTR (Home Delivery). We received the items packed well in containers and had a very satisfying dinner. Timely delivery and as always very delicious.
Though we miss the lively ambience of MTR as there is no dining-in service owing to the current pandemic situation, we didn‚Äôt miss tasting the authentic MTR food. We ordered our favourites like Uddina Vada, Rava Idly, Veg Pulao etc. I couldn‚Äôt stop relishing the crispy vada, soothing rava idly and yummy tasting Karnataka style Veg Pulao‚Ä¶
If you want to try authentic Karnataka style food in Singapore, you should definitely try MTR even if it‚Äôs for ordering food home. Hope to be back to dine-in there."
Impressive!!,"Food n drinks were on the table really fast n warm. It‚Äôll give fast food chain a run for the money
Gosh!! I would have tried everything on the menu. But I was bursting at the seams. Go at 6-7pm The crowd starts spilling in at 7.30pm.
The toilet is amazingly clean n dry. Staff is polite n the manager double check the cleanliness of the table after every turn over of the customers. Not bad huh!!Keep it up MTR"
It‚Äôs home food and food is super good!,"My husband and I hail from Karnataka. So basically this is home. Always smiling faces, clean food and spic and span kitchen. Fast service, quality food. Please visit."
"Always fresh, always quick, tasty","Stopped in last night - hadn't been there recently.

MTR is a basic coffee shop and always clean, but, Covid 19, the place was sparkling. Food was fresh and delicious! Not the cheapest option on Serangoon Road, but very consistent.

Service is very good and attentive in its own way for a coffee shop.

Hope to be back again soon!"
Excellent Venue to dine in.,Excellent service by every staff. Special thanks to Chiru for serving. Great job and continue to strive!
Best South Indian Food,The Masala Dosai and Vadai I like so much served Quickly service excellent and friendly the whole experience was good we will visit again üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶
Most authentic South Indian restaurant,"Very tasty preparations which are clearly a class above the other South India restaurants in Singapore. Authentic Karnataka dishes like Masala Dosa, Neer Dosa, Sagu Masala, Akki Roti, etc can only be had here.

To top it all, it is one of the most clean & hygienic place."
"Super service,fantastic food, very clean","We had dinner here based on Trip Advisor reviews. We ordered the Rava Idly, Uddina Vada, Bisibele Bhath, Masala Dosa and a Mango Lassi. All great, but we really enjoyed the Dosa! Great service. The restaurant is very clean and has some nice photos with English writing about the families background on them.the staff was very helpful..."
Decent food but lacks in good customer service,"Food here is decent but little expensive for a South Indian, not a fine dining restaurant. They are no where closer to the authentic food that they serve at Bangalore in India. MTR is well known for their masala dosa, bisibellebath and filter coffee but here it is pretty average. Waiters and cashiers are rude as they rush you to finish your food and leave quickly. It‚Äôs a place where you can eat once in a while, not a place to go frequently."
"Good service, fast delivery, good food!","Its my first time at this restaurant. The place is clean, food is good. I tried the masala dosa and its really good.the food was really amazing The service was fast as well."
Good food but rude cashiers,"The food is very good but the cashiers are rude. Sometimes I feel as though I am having the food for free. We need to place the order in hurry. They do not even allow us to take a breather after finishing our food. My family was waiting for me at the table, keeping a watch on my bag, while I had gone to wash my hands. The cashier checked with my family if they have completed the meal, in a tone signaling my family to vacate the place immediately. My friends have also experienced rude behavior by the cashier when they visited the restaurant. The waiters on the other hand are extremely polite and well mannered."
Authentic Taste of South India,"Love the food here. The best part is that the quality is consistently maintained and they seldom disappoint. Today we ordered BisiBele Bhath and Pudi Idly. Both tasted great with the right amount of spices.

However, was disappointed with Badam Halwa which didn‚Äôt meet my expectation. I wanted my regular Kesari Bhath, but unfortunately, it got over so had to settle with the above.

Overall a great place to taste authentic South Indian food."
"Tasty food , very hygienic and clean restaurant","The food is very nice , though waiting time is long but it worth waiting for this. Very authentic cuisine."
Waiting time too long,"Definitely the best place for vegetarian food. I loved the podi dhosa, Puri and filter coffee.

But it took 20 minutes by for me queue before went inside. After stept in the cashier still engaged with a customer family of 3 bafore were before me (10 minutes). After took order from me, the cashier told me wait till the single table to be available as there was young lady still occupied. I waited about 15 minutes after did my order and payment to get seated in my single table.

I found some lack in customer service. A place where most people like to have a good vegetarian food should not let customer wait for longer time.

MTR need to improve on customer service."
"Consistency, Quality, Richness & Tradition","I have been to MTR from 1984 when there was only one main restaurant in Bangalore, India & no other branches. Had coffee in Silver cups those days. Open Kitchen. Separate waiting hall was there. I was amazed at their cleanliness for a kitchen, storage room, floor cleaning etc. The store room when i saw was full of fresh corianders, chillies all in clean plastic bags even puffed with air inside to allow not crush each other. Visited in 2019 & had lunch with same quality as before.
Singapore has a branch these days (including may be other places around the world & India) . Amazing thing is the consistency in which they get items each and every time without much difference as people may not it is most difficult thing in cooking. Cleanliness & service coupled with quality in the traditional way they cooked from long time before. During pandemic time they served out many take aways. Now dining in is allowed people flock the place. Not without reason."
Delicious South Indian Food,"Recently, I visited this place and was glad to taste some delicious delicacies from Andhra Pradesh, one of the southern states of India. It truly is the right place for people who prefer vegetarian food or would like to try an authentic meal. I also loved the cleanliness and the precautionary measures taken during these COVID times. I felt very reassured."
First Hand Experience,This is my first hand experience in MTR Singapore where i can find the indian food. My favt. food was indian dishes. Food quality was outclass also they have excellent services..!
Vegetarian delight!!,"What a estatic,aromatic,hot,fresh wanting for more were every dish we tried here.best service as soon as you order it's on your table.very clean.. don't miss if you like south indian delicacy.thank you MTR."
Great dosa,We visited here 3 times during our 5 days in Singapore. Amazing dosa at a fantastic price. One of the culinary highlights of our time in Singapore.
Food n Hygiene,"We always love the MTR foodüòä Hygiene, food quality, and hospitality is excellent. We specially like puri, Dosa and curd rice from this hotel"
MTR Singapore- a must visit place for foodies!,Delicious food. Great customer service. Keep up the good work. The perfect place for a happy meal. Highly recommend to all!
Wonderful service and great healthy food.,Authentic taste. Incredible cleanliness. Brilliant service. The best restaurant in Singapore. Way ahead in all aspects.
Delicious and a nice environment.,The food was fantastic. Lots of flavours and a bit of everything. Service was great. The food came very fast and the environment was lovely.
Best idli medu wada and filter coffee !!‚Äôn,"Today I went alone to try out the much renowned MTR restaurant in Singapore.
I loved the Idli- Medu Wada. The idli was super soft and moist and fresh from the steamer. The wada was delicious and crispy to perfection! The chutney and sambar were served in perfect quantity and tasty too.
To top it all I had a hot filter coffee. And it is the BEST one I have had so far ( and I have had many in India)... so for sure this one was great :)
I‚Äôll keep coming here for more of my solo breakfast outings!

The hygiene and promptness of service is amazing!
A must-try!!!"
Best restaurant MTR,"Food is amazing, the best..very authentic. The staff os super friendly,Service was very good.We crave for MTR sometimes! üòäüòä"
Best Dosa Ever!!!,"This great little family run restaurant tops the list of Indian vegetarian places to eat in Singapore. Food was brilliant and I mean every dish we ordered. Quite possibly the best dosa I‚Äôve ever had and if you are lucky enough to go, make sure you order the pudi masala dosa! Simple decor but neat and clean and the staff friendly and efficient. A must visit for locals and visitors to Singapore!"
"Very clean and hygeienic,good service","Very clean & hygienic atmosphere. The food is genuinely authentic test of Karnataka. Service is unbelivable, loved the food every time visited the place."
OVERHYPED. Try other around this area.,"OVERHYPED. Well, like everyone else , after seeing review I went to this shop. I am calling it SHOP because thats what it is. The staff here will snatch your plates away while you are eating your food. While I was having my drink , the staff came twice in 2 minutes to ask if I completed even when he can see that I am still sipping it .Angry on this , I asked him to call his manager . To my surprise , manager himself was saying ‚Äúenough time given to you‚Äú haha really. Now he will decide within what time I should have my food and drinks . Am I writing some exam paper or what ? Then I told I am going to write a really bad review on this . He is like ‚Äú you want to write review right , pls write it :).‚Äù
It‚Äôs a shop because I have not seen a cafe/resto serving food behaving like this . Not even in Food courts in Singapore.
Btw about food , it‚Äôs not that great as well. There are many better cafes / restos than this around this area . You can imagine , if they don‚Äôt want to give you time to have your food / drinks , they won‚Äôt care about food quality as well."
I have been lost the last 40 years,"I'm not a vegetarian, I have friends who are vegetarian and I always have trouble finding places to bring them for meals.

This little treasure has been so nearby and I never knew about it.

EVERYTHING was good on the menu. Unbelievable, tried the Set dosa, Bonda Soup, Vada, Idly, Vanghi Bhath, omg... The accompanying chutneys. Curries, Sambar, all amazing.

Service was fast, prompt.

Ridiculously good."
Authentic and Delicious South Indian Food,"I have been wandering up and down Serangoon Road for the past two years and until today, I had never been north of City Square Mall. Today, I finally made it past that invisible barrier and found a gem of a restaurant. As soon as I saw the line of people to get into MTR Singapore, I knew it must be good. Once I took my first bite of button idlis sambar, I was hooked. The idlis were soft and fluffy. The sambar had the perfect balance of spicy, sour, and subtly sweet notes. I also ate a masala dosa that came with a small side of sambar and mint chutney. It was heavenly and I felt a bit sad as I finished the delicious potato and onion filling. I ended my lunch with a masala chai that was piping hot and had all the right spices. Now I have one year to get through the entire menu!"
Authentic regional cuisine,"Around Little India there are quite a few restaurants serving south Indian staples like idlis, dosa with variations. MTR stands out as being consistently good. Try their daily specials. They have a few variations on the dosa which I don't think are available elsewhere. Good filter coffee. We also appreciate that they provide 'real' cutlery and plates. Drinks like 'lassi' do come in single use plastic however. We now try to avoid restaurants using disposable cutlery. MTR is closed on Mondays. Weekends are crowded, you have to wait. Service is quick, polite."
Sorry and Disappointed,"Not sure what the hype is about this restaurant!! We queued for over 30min, the worst masala tosa, the Podi tosa was ok, the coffee was very ordinary. The Kasari was excellent. We have had delicious meals in other Indian restaurants in Singapore."
best food ever,"the most beautiful food, so clean and friendly, the staff is wonderful would recommend the dosa, its just like being in india"
We will come back.,"The food is great, the service is fast and very professional.Uddin Vada and Pudy Idly are really amazing."
Improvisation with Masala,"Improvisation with Masala Rava Idili Excellent idea on the Masala Rava idili - always great service, clean, hygienic and friendly staff. Hope we can see more innovation on the menu"
Amazing Kesari Chandrahara,I have been a regular at MTR Singapore for years now. In my recent trip had the opportunity to order Kesari Chandrahara dessert. Perfect sweet to have it with coffee any time! Have a bite of it and two sips of coffee. Loved it!!!. cannot wait to have again. 5 star experience!
Wonderful,Super food Wonderful hospitality Enjoyed Masala Rava Idli Kesari Chandrahara... and Super veg Dosa.... now I feel fully satisfied of having authentic food
"Amazing, authentic South Indian dishes with great hospitality by staff of MTR","Authentic Pudi Masala Dosa, Masala Rava Idli, Kesari Chandrahara made with pure ingredients and tasted amazing. Had a great time at MTR with friends."
What a delight!,"What a delight! I walked in without doing any research and am pleasantly surprised with the hygiene, cleanliness and good food here. Straight forward and a simple menu makes it authentic. The most noticeable thing is the quality of food preparation here. Keep it up!"
Great Indian vegetarian restaurant!,"Best dosas ever! Food is delicious, there are many options for Indian vegetarian. Very clean, great service. Excellent value."
Food heaven!,"Authentic and very tasty food, superb service - friendly and fast. It‚Äôs my favourite idli/dosa place in Singapore. A must visit for newcomers to Singapore and once you‚Äôve been there once you are hooked!"
Amazing food and good service!,"Amazing food and good service! My family loves going to MTR whenever we go to Little India. Khali Dose, Sambhar WaDa, Masala dose, Rawa Idly and lassi/coffee are my family‚Äôs favourites! Food here reminds me of the taste of my hometown!
Edde Tindiglu, Edde Jana (Good food, Good people)"
Great Indian Restaurant,"love the food and the beverages especially the tea and the coffee. Also all the food recommendations from the waiter is excellent, and very clean."
"The Best Idlis, Rawa Masala and Awesome Filter coffee in town","Had visited MTR several times with and without family
The restaurant stands out for a high degree of cleanliness.
Consistent great quality of food
The idlis are piping hot , soft and amazing . Goes extremely well with the coffee
If you want to indulge then do try the Badam Halwa"
Best MTR outside Bengaluru,"A very surprisingly good food and service. It‚Äôs a small joint just opposite to Perumal temple. The food is very good, hygienic and very tasty. A must visit place for all vegetarians travelling to singapura. The place is little small though. But, the food tastes amazing. Also, it is very reasonably priced."
A Memorable Experience!,"Before I came to this restaurant I truly did not care for Indian food-- MTR Singapore immediately changed my mind! We had no idea what to order, but the staff was extremely helpful in suggesting not only what we should get, but also how much food could feed 2 people. The food was so amazing that I am still talking about it nearly a year after my trip! Please make it a stop on your trip to Singapore!"
Top Choice for South Indian Food,"This is the top choice if you want to have South Indian Food. I went here twice and both times there is a waiting line which moves quickly. They offer the seat after you place your order, so the waiting line directs you to the order counter which is pretty good as no time is wasted in finalizing the item.

Food is delicious and drinks are delightful(Especially the Coffee)."
Awesome authentic Indian food.,"Awesome authentic Indian food. Lots of choice, not spicy and very friendly accommodating staff. It‚Äôs busy though, may have to wait a while."
Good and cheap!,"So good! Now I know why they call it one of the best Indian vegetarian in Singapore! My friend and I ordered their specialty dish. The lines are pretty long at times, and most people eat here quickly and don't linger"
Lunch,Authentic mamma bengalooru in spore .....excellent taste ..exactly same as bengalooru....even the ‚Äòthuppa‚Äô(ghee).....
MTR- Supreme culinary experience,"Excellent delicious South Indian breakfast made with original ingredients. Warm staff and clean, hygienic premises make it an experience worth repeating . We did 3 days in a row!"
Ok,"We had lunch here on a recent trip to Singapore. The reviews had set our expectations high but they were not met. The food was ok, not particularly tasty and pretty unmemorable"
Undoubtedly the no.1 Indian veg restaurant in Singapore,Undoubtedly the no.1 Indian vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. Great Bangalore/Udupi food with highest level of quality and hygiene makes Namma MTR the NO.1 in Singapore.
"Cheap, tasty, authentic","This south-indian vegetarian restaurant is great, food is tasty, often crowded but quick turn around (we showed up at 9pm, perfect timing, got a table right away and food served super fast). We used to bring our guest from Europe to Din Tai Fung only as the typical local/Asia delicacies, now we have added MTR to our list, keep it up !!!"
Delicious South Indian food,"Love that I stumbled across this gem on my first day in Singapore! Delicious food, kind service, reasonable prices, credit cards accepted. I‚Äôve been working my way through the menu and everything I‚Äôve gotten so far has been fantastic. Always crowded, it‚Äôs that good. No wifi, closed Mondays."
Best Vegetarian restaurant in Singapore.,I visited MTR multiple times during my stay in Singapore and I must say that the food was simply amazing. I did tell the owner that the taste is better than the one in Bangalore. My kids simply loved this place with the mouth watering dosas and didn't want to go anywhere. It is also clean and hygienic.
loved it,"found this on google and decided to try it; we were very happy with the food. when we first showed up there was a crowd of folks waiting outside and we didn't really understand the system of how things work. basically you have to figure out what you want, order it, then they assign you a table. the gentleman working the ordering computer was very nice and gave us some great recommendations. honestly i can't remember the names of the dishes but we ordered several and they were all packed with great flavors. would definitely go again!!"
Great food,MTR has great food and fast service. I have been there many times and the standard of food and service has been the same
Very good food,Had our dinner during a short trip to Singapore. We had pudi dosa and pudi rava masala dosa. Both were very good and reasonably priced. I will visit this place again if I am in Singapore. Coffee was decent but dosa was much better.
Excellent!,"We go here every time we come to Singapore. Doesn‚Äôt fail to impress every time. Food is awesome and true to its taste. Not a long waiting time. Delicious dishes. Perfect for all meals or just a mid day snack.

Would love to see the lassis being served in reusable containers and for MTR to go 100% sustainable.
Lassi is still served in plastic cups which is disappointing."
South Indian Feast,"MTR never disappoints you and the one in Singapore is mo exception. If you want authentic South Indian Vegetarian food, don't miss MTR in Singapore."
Superb masala dosa and idly.,"Superb masala dosa and idly. Would absolute recommend this restaurant for the quality of food, service was prompt and pleasant"
Awesome vegetarian/jain food,we came here for the first time and we were astounded by the food quality. Would recommend for Jain people. 10/10 food
Tasty food,Excellent food at MTR. I would recommend the Pudi Masala Dosa. Definitely worth a visit (or several)!
"First impression, very clean","First impression, very clean & hygienic atmosphere. The food is genuinely authentic test of Karnataka. loved the food every time visited the place"
Excellent food,"We were told that MTR had the best vegetarian Indian food in Singapore and this is true.
Very busy and a little basic; you order your food on the way in, pay and then get assigned a table. You may have to share.
Service is very fast and the staff are all helpful. We ordered too much and they kindly advised what was the correct number of dishes and the best combinations.
A meal for two came to about $30. Highly recommended."
Authentic Indian Vegetarian Cuisines,Love to share the difference im cultures & cuisines. Simply great in service despite being packed. Highly recommend this place.
Best dosa in Singapore (and possibly India!),"Having been to India multiple times, was recommended to visit by an Indian friend. Absolutely fantastic, the onion masala dosa was so light, crispy and delicious I might come back tomorrow!"
The absolute one,"This is the absolute one, it‚Äôs the best Indian food I‚Äôve ever eaten, and I‚Äôve actually been to India."
BEST VEGETARIAN in SINGAPORE,"Restaurant is spic and span, service is very polite and unobtrusive, very very balanced food , NO OIL in most , but offcourse some pan dishes its needed , filter coffee is probably the best. Very creative in blends of spices .. very very rare that you have everything 'So Perfect'. Keep the good work up guys. Excellent value for money .. Note: PLS do not compare this restaurant to any Singapore or Malaysia based South Indian Restaurant ! This is a unique concept and weathered through time. Replicating the same quality here would have been so difficult."
Tasty and Satisfied Meal!,The restaurant was clean and provided good service. Food was tasty and we really enjoy the meal. But a little bit expensive for that portion of meal.
spicy and good,"Friendly staff explained what to do to order. Food came quickly and although it became busy we weren't made to rush when finished. There are two menus; one has the pictures of the meals, the other has the prices and the daily specials. Order at the counter. If you don't know what you want, you can sit down first and look at the menu before you order."
Flawless,No worries. Straight away go inside and order your food . Food is traditional but too tasty. Prices are absolutely perfect. No issues with cleanliness. 10/10
Authentic South Indian Karnataka Yummy Food!,"We always visit Saravana Bhawan for south indian food such as Dosas Sambhar Idli Vada. A friend recommended to try MTR and i am glad we did. We totally loved the hygienic clean place.. the yummiest fingerlicious lipsmacking food.
Must have - Pudi Masala Dosa (i'm still drooling over it and gonna visit to eat that again, sharing a picture of the same if that tempts u too)
Sambhar vada and idlis were so tasty as well.
Overall great service & lovely hospitality.

Excellent food,Excellent food. Excellent service. We enjoyed delicious dishes and more particularly Pody Masala Dosa. Very reasonable price and great hospitality.
Authentic Karnatak Taste :),"Each time i go, i always order the different assortments of foods; the Masala Dose, uttappa, Chow Chow bath, Ragi Dose, idli vada ,Tea etc. Eat dish is seasoned with it's own spices and herbs which come out smelling savory and appetizing, unlike other places that use the same seasoning for all dishes.

As per my knowledge MTR is the best Vegeterian Restaurant in Singapore. It fullfill your food desire.

its been a year i am visiting MTR. I am pure vegeterian so for me MTR is the ideal restaurant.

Thank you MTR for service."
Breakfast Delights,MTR Restaurant was an extraordinary delight to all my senses! Pure pleasure eating there! The food was delicious! I hope to be here again and again for many years!
Authentic bisibele,"MTR is very conveniently located. If you want to have good authentic Karnataka cuisine, then this is the place to go. Bisibele bath is rich and delightful as are dosai varieties and the 'baths'. Mini tiffen is a good option for a meal. The place is crowded usually and waiting time can be 30-40 mins during peak hours. But the wait is worth it. The staff are courteous and helpful. The ordering process can be smoothened a bit since many customers decide their menus upon reaching the counter only and this takes up lot of time."
Fantastic Indian Vegetarian Food,"Staff at the counter was friendly and explained the contents of the menu on my first visit and provided recommendations.

Waiters were pleasant and smiled everytime they served the dishes and cleared empty plates promptly.

Place was clean and well maintained and always filled with customers.

Tried the Masala Dosa, Rava Idli, and Masala Tea. Decided to take away the Poori Saagu to try later in the evening and boy was it delicious!

Favourite dishes so far were the Poori Saagu and the Masala Dosa. They're very tasty and satisfying!"
Very delicious Indian food,My friends bought me here for dinner and the food is awesome! Must try the Tomato rice which is the special dish on wednesday. Everyday has a different special dish.
