Best service from staff,Great service from Emmanuel and Tango. Thanks for being so attentive and it's bennnlong for getting out for eating out after lockdown
Great Service,"Had dinner there recently. Good food and great service, especially from staff Tango. Very attentive and knowledgeable with good recommendations for beverages."
High quality food with excellent service,"Seafood prawn platter was amazing! BBQ beef, lamb, fish and chicken were high quality as well. Free flow wine and sparkling were above expectation and crew was very attentive. Overall 5stars. Would be great if got aircon."
Great value and service,Went for the free flow BBQ evening and was NOT disappointed! Great selection of BBQed meats and I was pleasantly surprised that they left a full bottle of prosecco on the table each time so you could serve yourself.
Give The BBQ A Try,"Highly recommend. Food, drinks and service were top notch.
Seafood on ice (shelved prawns!), warm ciabatta garlic bread, mixture of salads and highlight of the meal - super bbq (tender meat). Not forgetting free flow alcohol for 2 hours!

Entire experience was just so amazing, special shoutout to the service team, thoroughly impressed with the level of service and attention to details. Thank you to the team!

If you are out looking for a nice bbq dinner with the right company and ambiance, Oasis wont let you down! Great food, great drinks and great people!"
Good service with reasonable price,"Kind staffs, delicious food with reasonable price, but a bit salty. Friendly restaurant for kinds below 4 years old."
We had the bbq dinner with,We had the bbq dinner with 5. Alvin made the most amazing lamb bbq dish we had in a long time. Be back soon.
Chill dinner spot,Great service by Emmanual and Team! Nice breezy evening and good ambience. Good lamb chops and excellent salad
Good service,"Was handled by Emmanuel and Jo, but changed seat due to it was near toilet. They were patient and helped us as much. Enjoyed the buffet and unlimited drinks. Only downside is we went in at 8pm but the buffet closes at 9pm."
"Generally good tasting food, but lacked service and sincerity","We decided to go for the BBQ dinner buffet on a Saturday evening. The spread of the buffet was very limited. But don't be deceived by the lack of variety, because the quality of the foods were good. Cold dishes like large prawns and oysters tasted fresh as well. Kudos to the team from the kitchen at Oasis!

The major letdown was actually the service. I'm not sure why I'm the only one with a conflicting review (possibly because I am local, and the staff couldn't care less about us?)

We made a reservation at 6pm and arrived promptly. Upon arrival, we were not introduced to the buffet line proper. Due to the fact that there were 2 tiers in pricing -- one with free flow alcohol, and one without. We had no idea which part of the buffet line was ""out of boundaries"" for us as patrons of the non-alcoholic buffet.

When clearing the used plates, the wait staff took them all and stacked them. Suddenly realizing that she's also taken the cutlery, she dumps them all back down onto the table into 1 pile.

It was a disappointing dinner and an embarrassing one (was a surprise anniversary dinner for the husband).

I suppose we can check this off our bucket list and not return again..."
Dinner,Good service bystaff. Food taste very ordinary Amboence is good. Value for money The fish portion is too small
We keep coming back to Grand,"We keep coming back to Grand Hyatt time and time again, the staff at Oasis is amazing and very accommodating. They always make us feel at home. They know us from our previous stays and they go above and beyond to make us feel welcome. Special mention to Tom, Emmanuel and Fahmi. They are extended family of ours."
Another great night at Oasis,This is one of our favourite places to eat in Singapore. The name says it all- this is a gem in the city. This time we were looked after by Fahmi who was very attentive- Thank you. We‚Äôve brought family & friends here and all have been impressed. Keep up the good work!
Great dinner at a beautiful soothing location!,"Great food, super friendly service by our waiter Fahmi and relaxing atmosphere at the poolside! The noise of the city disappears here..."
Dinner at Oasis,"Great food and service from Leny and Fahmi. Proactive and friendly, our plates were cleared promptly, and cups refilled constantly."
Wonderful service!,"Great time at the pool served by Fahmi. Wonderful staff and hotel, highly recommend! Recommend the noodles."
Drinks from the poolside.,Lovely to sit and have a few drinks at the Oasis even though there is no air conditioning inside he Oasis. Natural breeze is good enough.
Buffet dinner,"The pool side is relaxing and seafood is good, service was okie. Dessert and ice creme are good too."
Delicious quesadilla,"Visited here with my husband on a Tuesday evening via an Eatigo booking. Staff was cordial and food was served in a timely fashion.

I loved my chicken quesadilla and would return for it again. My husband ordered the lamb but I didn't like it much because it was tough to chew and didn't come with mint sauces. My husband liked his meal, tho. Both dishes were generous servings."
Amazing,"What can you say, location is just great , bbq was really special, consisting of fish, prawns, lamb, beef, great veg, staff were spot on , looking forward to another trip in the future"
Amazing free flowing Frozen Margaritas all night long,"Had a reunion party of 15 last Saturday night. The weather was very warm and the spirits were very high ...... on the free flowing frozen regular and strawberry margaritas. One of the best I have had in a long while.

The BBQ and drinks stopped early at 9pm. However our wonderful crew (chefs & servers) let us hang & continue sipping into the night..... (including other free flow beer, red & white wine, Prosecco......)

Thanks guy. √ú made our reunion a blast!!!"
Dinner,"Attended BY Mr Naveen during our dining. We'll groomed and mannered, kept checking on our concerns. Friendly and approachable. Overall good customer service and meal preparation was within requested style. Great time well spend."
dinner,had the BBQ buffet dinner on Sat. great service and good food quality. wonderful atmosphere. worth a visit.
Birthday Celeb.,"Thanks Fahmi for being so accommodating and for the good service! üëçü§ó The food was good as well the ambiance. Oh, the surprised for the celebrant was the best part.üëèüëçüòÅ"
Bday dinner,Fahmi is friendly and accomodating.He entertains queries regarding the place and the food. The food is good :)
Farewell/Birthday Party,"Booked a private party & were given the Gazebo package. It was great because service was excellent. Thank you, Fahmi & Singh for taking good care of us! Thanks to Tango too for being so kind & accommodating!"
"Fantastic staff, warm service, great hospitality - thanks Fahmi!","We had a rollicking good time at tonight‚Äôs dinner in Oasis. Food was great but the service was what knocked it out of the park. Our waiter Fahmi was genuinely warm, provided wonderful service, and made our dinner that much more fun - exactly what we needed for a laugh-filled evening out with friends. Thanks a lot Fahmi and thank you Oasis. We will definitely be back and when we do, we want Fahmi again!"
Drinks and nibbles after tennis,"Organized night time tennis with several colleagues all staying at GH. We settled in at Oasis for beers and nibbles afterwards. Service was attentive, food was made promptly. Nice satay, mee goreng and sliders - not amazing, but good. Overall had good experience and the night went really well."
Chill restaurant by the pool,"Visited this secluded restaurant near the far back of the hotel on level 5 for a late dinner on a Monday evening and was greeted by quiet poolside and balmy breezes with the sound of water flowing.

We ordered a roasted pumpkin salad with an add on of steak and a Angus beef burger. The burger looked simple and much like something from a heartland stall but thankfully it tasted great. The brioche bun was sinfully delicious. Would have preferred my burger undissected with everything in it instead of by the side as it seems like less work removing than adding.

Salad was delicious as well."
Uncomfortable and poor cuisine,"This cafe is in a non air conditioned, open air area next to the swimming pool. The fan was not working that day, and we almost melted in the heat during our lunch. Our Vegetarian Sausage hotdog was interesting and the serving was not large - it was served with a stir fried mixed vegetable. The Nasi Goreng was highly recommended but turned out to be most disappointing. Service was not attentive."
Not worth it,"The food was below expectations, dessert really not nice. It‚Äôs worth it if you are a heavy drinker as it‚Äôs free flow."
Oasis Dinner,One of the best dinning experience in Singapore. Tango and the team really made our stay comfortable. Excellent service. Goodjob! Cheers to Grand hyatt singapore. üí™üèº
Satay is fantastic,"I had lunch here after a swim in the pool and I must say the food was great. I had the Satay which is fantastic and the Nasi Goreng which was great too. The waiter asked if I wanted it spicy or not, so a nice touch. I went spicy and it was but not extreme and didn't take away from the flavours. There can't be a better way to spend a lunchtime with a range of food to suit most tastes and budgets."
disappointing,"this place is overrated.. went on a sunday. the grilled prawns were not very fresh with 1 that is mushy.. eww i put it aside and stopped eating. the staff offer to grill a newbatch but the fact that this reaturant which has been offering bbq as the main highlight shows the chefs‚Äô skills are lacking. the medium cook steak is ickky in colour, unappetising. Juices are just syrup water. fruits platter consist of banana, green apple, watermelon, oranges and strawberries which are sour.. we had a few morsels and that‚Äôs it. only the salads are good. the senior service staff boggles my mind, asking to clear the salad bowls which i indicated i want it, he says he needs to clear a space for the bbq platter.. wow sorry to inconvenience you! whole experience is a letdown, not a hyatt experience.
do not bother to visit, this is like an experimental playground for the inexperienced staffs from chef to service. go to other restaurants and hotels instead. psst try colony and atrium instead.."
Dinner,Good food and service was good. Staff was efficient. Good ambiance. Place was a bit hard to find though.
JON LIM,Attended by Yan Yuin at Oasis restaurant. Staff with Good attitude and very patience. Good environment and ambience as the restaurant is located at the pool side. Definitly a Thumbs up for this place.
Great place for gathering,Restaurant is near pool side. Great for big groups. Food is yummy. Ambience is good too. We have been attended by Yan Yun and we are very satisfied with her service. Thumbs up!
Retirement Dinner,Variety is limited but quality is good Open air seating is ok since December Price is relatively high for the food
Company Gathering,Attended by Ms Yan Yuin. Great service and nice food! Seated at a private area near the pool. Will Definitely come here again!
Variety is just too small,"Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that this restaurant has got everything wrong or is mediocre. In fact, the quality of the food they serve is good and the service is exceptional but when you pay a certain amount for food, you do have an expectation of the food being commensurate with the price you pay. For example, if you pay less than a dollar, you can't complain if they serve you instant noodles. On the other hand, if you pay $68++ or $88++ (with alcoholic drinks) then your expectation of the food increases. They do serve very nicely marinated roast lamb, wagyu beef (claimed), prawn (grilled and streamed, then iced), oysters (freshly shucked and baked), grilled salmon, portobello mushroom, sweet potato, chicken and salad and 3 types of cake. That's it and that's what's wrong with it. When you pay $68++ for a BBQ buffet, you would expect a wider menu. The freshness of the food is second to none except for the grilled prawn which was a little squishy. The quantity of the food is definitely sufficient to meet the needs of the diners. The restaurant does replenish the food timely. The service staff who attended to my table was very efficient and meticulous. She didn't miss a single detail. The experience was exceptional but alas, the main criteria for reviewing a restaurant would be the food itself and not so much the ambience or staff, though those definitely contribute to making the entire dining experience more enjoyable."
Big BBQ prawn,"I had the buffet on the Friday evening. Perhaps we are too early, hence not all BBQ are ready. We only managed to have prawn, beef, chicken, lamb & fish. I heard that later at late time they have more stuff coming out like oyster and grilled vegetables. However, we are too full for that. The fish and lamb also appear quite late. In term of taste, it is good especially the prawn is bigger than normally served. There is also salad bar, very little variety of deserts - 3 types and ice cream. May be because the main is the grilled food."
Oasis Indeed,The staffs are awesome and very accommodating. Food serving is accurate and quick. Try their Laksa and salads when dining here.
Friday bbq brunch,"A wonderful evening as always! Sienna and the team were so attentive and friendly for the duration of the evening. The drinks set up is free flow and they do not hold back on attending to your choice of bubbles, wine, red, margaritas etc. The bbq food is delicious and is the perfect assortment of options. We always enjoy our evening here and the wonderful service!"
Disappointed,"Had a birthday dinner at this place. Was disappointed at the spread of BBQ spread and for the price it charges.
Will not return unless it improves in the near future."
Great fun great food as always,Always fun great service an food in a wonderful ambience. Yanyuin (our waitress) was fantastic! The food is very well cooked and the service is attentive
Lovely Evening,My wife and I visited Oasis restaurant for the barbecue buffet by the pool. It was a really relaxed atmosphere with attentive service (not least the free flow wine) and excellent food. The oysters were lovely and the beef was cooked perfectly with a lovely charred exterior and deep pink inside. Our waitress Yanyuin could not have done more for us.
Chill out dining place,"Relaxing by the poolside with local or western cuisine, great quality food and staff, recommended for relaxation!"
Mountains of Meat!,"Excellent meal. We had the BBQ platter which delivered a constant supply of exquisite seafood and meat, plus a wide array if salads and sides. Excellent quality of food and extremely good value for money. To top it all off Tango our waiter offered a brilliant and attentive service! Would happily eat there again but advise an early sitting."
Best dining experience,This is one of the best places I have been so far. Impeccable service and warm hospitality on top of the undeniably delicious dishes that just blows me away. Thank you!
Great food and service!,Been here a couple of times and thoroughly enjoyed the evening BBQ! Attention to service was impeccable and everyone was attentive and obliging.
Fun times,Service was excellent and waiters very helpful. Great oysters. Relaxing and enjoyable setting. Highly recommended.
Great service.. awesome food!,The oysters were really good ... awesome location by the pool .. great ambience! service was excellent! Would definitely come back for more! High recommended!
Amazing!,Truely amazing place to just get away and have good food. I would recommend it to all my friends. We had a good sergeant named Yan Yuin.
Best bbq in town,We had 30 people come for CNY we were made to feel very welcome. A must if you are visiting Singapore and have a free day night.
"Every time in Singapore, I visit for a great meal","The staff are excellent, the food is wonderful and the ambience is also fantastic. We have been coming to this relaxing and casual poolside restaurant for years, every time we visit Singapore. The Mee Goreng is my favourite dish, also the menu is really, really good. The Manager is very professional and friendly, the team work very hard to make sure guests are happy. Cannot speak highly enough of them!!!!"
Very profesionnal !,"We organized a big networking event at Oasis restaurant.
Everything went perfectly.
The team was very professional. They perfectly respected the timing.
The food was very good.

We definitely recommend this place!
Thank you again!"
Extremely hospitable,"I would like to thank team of Oasis who has been looking after us during our stay.
Specially Tango, Sienna and Yan have been remarkable.
Would highly recommend the food and surroundings.
Thumbs up."
A real treat! Best service money can buy!,"Celebrating my friend‚Äôs birthday and we opted for their BBQ buffet with free flow drinks.
Impeccable service! The glass of bubbly in my hand were never emptied as they were so quick to refill the glasses every time we sipped. Service staff were attentive and always have a ready smile.
Food were served by courses, any item we liked, we could order again separately.
Loved their oysters and shrimp on ice as well as their BBQ fare, steak and rack of lamb were also cooked to perfection.

As this is an outdoor location, by the hotel pool, houseflies and huge ants would be present but all were quickly forgiven after the third glass of prosecco!"
Best,Amazing food and amazing booze!!! Staff is really friendly... if you‚Äôre an ex at in Singapore you should come here!
A chill bar overlooking the pool,"Great food, great staffs and great location.

A must chill bar with a few Pinot Grigio and ask for Francis to look after you.

A gem and a asset to this bar.

A must try his their tomatoes and water melon salad.

My 9th visit and I always have a drink in this bar. It‚Äôs an oasis.

"Oasis,Grand Hyatt, Scotts Road, Singapore","Brilliant. I do not want to write this review as I don't want too many people to go to Oasis!! It is my favourite location!!! We went there, by accident, and had a great time as the service was fantastic (make sure you get served by Tango and/or Senna). Location is brilliant, next to the pool on the 5th floor, so great atmosphere.
Food is not ""leading edge"" but good, solid reliable BBQ, roast, grilled foods as well as superb oysters and massive prawns. But it is good solid food - and with free flow alcoholic drinks it only costs SGD80+++. My sister came to visit us from UK and of all the places we took her, Oasis was the winner.
Will we go back? Yes, every other week we try and go back. We love it as does out daughter and the service makes us want to go back."
Wonderful Dining Experience in Oasis~Friendliest staff!,"We are doing hotel restaurant hopping for our vlog site and good thing we came across Grand Hyatt Hotel in Orchard as they said there's a nice cozy ambience on the 5th level where u can just chill and relax while enjoying the great food. They are famous for bbq dinner buffet with free flow of drinks and wine but unfortunately we were there at the middle of the day anyways we still enjoyed the ala carte menu being offered plus what's more important is the service provided by the staff..really knows how to value their customer as always showing ""service with a smile"". Kudos to Emmanuel and Sienna who are sooooo friendly and nice to us and Emmanuel knows how to suggest the best food they have! I hope Grand Hyatt Hotel will give compliment to these kind of staff as u can hardly see people like them in the hotel service line nowadays esp in SG..so keep it up! And we will be back soon..i want to try the dinner bbq buffet next time cheers!"
Oasis in busy Orchard Road,"Indeed an oasis in bustling Singapore shopping belt. Quiet & Serene up on 5th Level of the Grand Hyatt.

Food‚Äôs decent and the staff really outstanding especially Sienna from Korea. Extremely helpful and recommended the stuff that was good. My Wife and I ordered the nasi goreng & the bbq tiger prawns. It was good recommendations by Sienna.

Sienna was friendly, helpful and wow us with a cup of cut fruits after our meals.

Great job, Sienna!

Regards
D Ang"
One of Singapore's best deals,"Anyone who has ordered drinks in Singapore knows how expensive it can be. If you've ordered food in the Orchard Road area it can also be pretty pricey, and if you've ordered food and drink in Orchard you may have needed to take out a second mortgage.

So where can you get good quality food and free flow drinks in a really nice location on Orchard at a reasonable price? Oddly enough, at one of the smartest hotels! The BBQ at Oasis at the Hyatt is a really great deal. I've done it a few times and always had a great time. The food is barbecued right there and there's a good range of salads, veggies and fresh seafood as well.

Room for improvement would be a bit more variety on the meat options and more speed from BBQ to plate. If you get your timing wrong the food can be a bit dry. However, these are minor points. The food is great, the location is lovely, the staff are really nice and it's a really good deal."
Relaxed BBQ buffet night,"my family had BBQ buffet on this Friday night. At pool side, felt very relaxed.
I am very appreciated to kind and attentive staff. they r always smiling and caring.
Food was good , too(a bit limited range of food but still ok). especially free flow drinks r best benefit. We absolutely go back again.
Special thanks to staff Sienna. (love her smile :))"
"Great service, good food, very relaxing environment","We stayed here on two separate occasions in August. Dined here both times with the family. Fantastic food all around but the best part is the very attentive, friendly and professional staff. We are quite discerning travelers and this place rocks! Recommend their angus sirloin steak and oyster on half shelf. Highly recommend Oasis to unwind after a long day."
"Attentive staff, great value for money","With almost four hours of free flow drinks and buffet at just around $100, Oasis offers great value for money. While selection of food might be a little limited, it's still a fun place to go with big groups of friends for good weekday happy hour. The staff, especially Sienna, was very accommodating and attentive too."
BBQ Buffet,Came here on a Friday night. No air con. BBQ. The air was smokey so bad for dry eyes and nose. Range of food was limited. Long queue for the small burgers so I didn't get to eat that. Dessert was quite good.
Great fun,"I visited the buffet brunch about 6-8 weeks ago for a friends birthday, the buffet started a little early for me as I work until 6pm however Francis ensured that we were looked after very well to make up fro being a few hours late! The food was great, the red meat went very quickly though. And the cocktails/ prosecco were great. Big thanks to Francis for being the best host!"
Group dinner,"Excellent service, great staffs, superb food. They really took care of everyone be in house or business. Service with love"
Great value for money,Myself and 9 other friends went to the evening free flow buffet last week. Sienna was our waitress and she was fantastic - couldn't ask for any better service. All the food was very good and I would definitely recommend this dinner option to anyone living or visiting Singapore
Limited food selection,"I'll not recommend this place for food or drinks at the prices charged. Food selection limited and quality low for Hyatt's standard and price charged.
When I was there this evening, I was the only local.
There's a pool by the side...al fresco...probably cater more for expat. Definitely can get better quality & value somewhere else."
Good place & good staff,Great place near pool. Impressed food & service. Especially thanking staff Sirena. Really had a good time for her warm & kind service. I will be there with my boy & girl.
Good Service,"We went here last night for a birthday celebration and I wanted to thank Nami our waitress who kept the free flow drinks topped up with prosecco and Cloudy Bay sauvignon blanc. The food was lovely and setting was very nice.
Thank you."
Extremely Disappointed,"Having been a frequent customer over the years most recently only 6 weeks ago, I have just returned from an evening at Oasis with guests that has been utterly disappointing.

This event has changed in those 6 weeks from a delight to a disaster.

The event is billed as a BBQ. There was no steak. Hardly any red meat at all, some average cubed lamb was all that was on offer. 6 weeks ago the lamb chops (on the bone) were succulent and tender, 6 weeks ago they had sirloin steak which was beautiful. By 8pm tonight they'd either run out or never had any to start with.

Finally as we were told to make our final drinks order at 8:55pm for a 9pm ""bar closed"" imagine the disgust at the next table pouring from a fresh bottle of prosecco at 9:55pm.

I'm very upset that I billed this place as somewhat special to my visitor friends only to be treated to a below average night.

I will not return any time soon and would urge others to give it a miss.

Terrible disappointment this evening."
Great food and service,Very good selection of BBQ meat and mini burgers. Not the widest selection of food but it was all very good. The staff were very friendly and attentive.
My favourite late lunch spot while staying at the Hotel,"The restaurant is in the grounds of the hotel next to the pool. Its my restaurant of choice for a late breakfast or lunch. Nice back drop relaxing, chilled with good service. The food is always good and the perfect spot to kick back for a late afternoon cocktail"
Excellent Service,"Wonderful and friendly staff. A great place to enjoy the day and chill out with good food.
Will definitely visit again."
Great relaxing dining place,"Poolside, very chilled, great food and ambience, lives up to its oasis name. Really enjoyable time here"
Easter feast,What a great afternoon with friends. Food was fantastic and the service staff were so friendly and helpful. Kids enjoyed a swim and the adults got to enjoy the drinks! Best value in town
Easter Brunch,Great afternoon with the kids playing in the pool and some good food. Francis was friendly and made sure we were well looked after. Hyatt turned it on!
BBQ Buffet,Awesome food and awesome service. Loved the ambiance too. If you are ever looking for a quiet spot to enjoy great food with excellent company look no further.
Amazing experience!,"My company organised my farewell party in this beautifully located restaurant. It was a great experience mostly because it was a free flow (wine, beer, cocktails, bubbly....) and the most delicious food from the buffet. It included fresh oysters, seafood, different types of grilled meat, various salads, desserts and ""make your own"" noodles dishes.... Really good and fresh.
A great thank you to all the hard working staff members who really made an extra mile in serving us, especially to Francis who was very professional and entertaining! Well done!"
Hidden time limit. Virtually kicked out within 1.5 hours! Shocking service!,"The food at the Oasis BBQ was quite nice although the choice was very limited.

But be warned - there is a 9PM deadline for the ""last pour"" of the free flow drinks and from that moment on the staff will do anything they can to get rid of you as soon as possible even though the restaurant officially closes at 10. There was no advanced warning of this when we made our booking for a birthday party of 5 at 7:30. The BBQ stopped being refilled way before 9 (although the chef did cook an extra plate of stuff for our table) and the staff were cleaning away dessert before 9 too forcing us to make a grab for what was left before we'd even finished our other food.

When you're paying more than $100 a head being made to feel unwelcome and virtually swept still hungry out of the restaurant 1.5 hours after arriving is absolutely disgusting.

NOT recommended."
Delicious BBQ with excellent service,"Oasis restaurant is located next to the rooftop swimming pool at the Grand Hyatt hotel on Scotts Road. We have visited several times and the long serving staff are always attentive and tuned in to their customers, which is not always common in SG. Food is both delicious and plentiful. The free flow F&B BBQ has to be about the best value for money experiences that you will receive in Singapore.

A great place to bring family and friends that are visiting. We will continue to return to Oasis in the future."
"Great to chill out, friendly service","Had a number of lunches and evening dinners in Oasis. Menu doesn't change from lunch to dinner except there is a BBQ for dinner (all you can eat / drink). From the menu the food is good, all freshly cooked and arrives quickly, salads are crisp and fresh. Nasi Goreng is a good dish. In the evening the food is BBQ based and is good too...it could be a little warmer if you pick from the already cooked food but they will cook fresh for you as well. If you are vegetarian they will change the menus to suit you...Biggest drawback is that the evening food stops at 9pm, so this is a little early.
Overall though a lovely setting, absolutely superb team of people who go the extra mile to help... and the food is comforting and good! Will always eat here"
Lunch,"Had lunch with my wife on Sunday.
Menu not very extensive, but varied from Western fare to local type cuisine.
Food well prepared.
What stood out was the waiting staff. Very attentive & efficient.
Will definitely return."
Good,"Great location for chill. Nice environment. Good food and beverage. Great to try weekend bbq buffet, it's worth!"
Wonderful Thursday BBQ buffet dinner,Wonderful service by tango the oasis manager.The food is very fresh and well prepared. Had an great night! Definitely will come again!
Service excellent. Buffet not so excellent.,"Had dinner at the Oasis Pool-side Buffet over the weekend. I think if it wasn't raining so hard it would have been a lot nicer sitting around the pool, however, it wouldn't have done anything for the food options. Unlike Mezza that has a fantastic selection with excellent quality, Oasis was a disappointment. I believe if you're an oyster fan it is worth the money, however, if not I would suggesting eating at one of the other restaurants. If it wasn't for the vegetarian station (which was decent) my entire family would have had to go to dinner after ""going to dinner"". No one in our family is a vegetarian but it was the best option.

There was also a birthday party going on at the same time. I'm fine with a party, however, when the guests are all standing around the buffet chatting and drinking it made getting to the food very difficult. Seemed chaotic.

The best part of the restaurant is the service. The wait staff is attentive, professional and on-top of their job. Well done. It's truly a shame the food quality/options aren't held to the same standards. As a huge fan of the Hyatt and as a Club at the Hyatt member, this experience was very disappointing. If it wasn't for the free flow wine it would have been a total bust."
"Average restaurant, absurd drink price","The restaurant is next to the swimming pool. Actually it looks more like a pool bar than an actual restaurant. Not really much atmosphere there, it looks practical but not particularly good.
If you try the Dinner buffet menu - free flow of meat/vegetable/drinks, it is fine. Not great but not terrible.
Quality of the meat and the food is OK, vegetable are average, price of the menu is acceptable, drinks are included. Nothing special but for some situations, it may be a valuable offer.
Note that if you buy drink outside the Dinner buffet menu, price of drinks are absurd. I was quoted 29.5 SGD for a glass of poor-to-average white wine, which I returned as it is an absurd price even by Singapore standards."
Great weekend chill place,"Weekend happy hour promo, poolside dining, good quality food and excellent service staff, what more can you ask for"
Oasis,"Perfect place for a pit stop during this Formula one. Unlimited beef, chicken, lamp, seafood and oyster. Not forgetting the key attraction, unlimited pour of beer, wine, cocktails and juices. Unfortunately these have to be consumed by 930pm."
Dinner buffet,"Went there on 8th Jul 2016.
First time dining in alfresco. It was very warm and drinking wine is not helping the situation( wine comes in the buffet )
Food wise not much variety but the wine was good.
The worse thing is, the female washroom has no toilet rolls and that is the only washroom on that level when we ask the waiter. There is only one cubicle as the other cubicle is for shower. We asked three times for it after 1hour each and nothing materialise. Perhaps it is too ""grand"", thus it takes more than 24hours to replenish the toilet rolls"
okay for a snack but puts on a lousy buffet,"I've been to this restaurant several times over the last year as I am member of the spa and this restaurant is just next door. So, I've eaten here on at least half a dozen occasions only because it is convenient.

this bistro by the pool only an okay alternative for a brunch for locals and visitors if you happen to be on scotts road and can't think of any where else to go . The meals are average, coffee nothing to write home about, the juice has been sitting around for a long time and so has that bitter after taste. You are paying a lot for sub standard fare.

we tried the seafood buffet and it is an extremely poor way of spending 100$ per head as the wine they supplied is best described as a pipe cleaner and the seafood are all overly grilled and greasy. it is at best, a 20$ meal.

The only Plus point is that it is one of the few outdoor places that that is not like a sauna or a fish market. so, you can actually talk and eat in some comfort."
ladies nite,We had a enjoyable dinner at the restaurant. The staff were very attentive and polite. One suggestion is that it would be nice if they can have more fans around the restaurant as it can get very warm.
"Go on Thursdays, only if you are a female!","Ladies night on Thursdays @ $49++ seems like a pretty good deal. BBQ buffet, chilled oyster and giant prawns on ice, Peking duck station, choose your own stir fry mee station, softserve ice cream on tap. Sounds good right? Nope, the food is a shame, other than the delicious giant prawns (be it grilled or iced), the rest of the food are all a let down. BBQ stuff were cold and hard, oysters were flat and skinny... The food is really mediocre.. Saw two caucasian chefs walking around and tasting the food (maybe the executive chef and sous chef), I think they feel the same!

In the end, we were there for what its for, the free flow drinks: Prosecco, beer, Margaritas, juices, red and white wine. We just treated it as a visit to a free-flow bar, took some crackers from the peking duck station and chatted the warm, humid and mosquitoes-infested night away.

Pity the gentleman that came with us as they were charged S$99++ per person.

Is it worth it? Only if you drink (like a man) and is a lady and go on Thursday nights.

If you are not, then please do not go. You can spend your money better elsewhere.

Another thing to add: the staff were very rushed, but its not their fault as they are barely enough of them, and they practically have to run all over the place. They had no time to be serving slowly and delicately. I think each night is a fitness work out for them in that sweltering heat."
Food was excellent - Singapore slings fantastic,"Pool drink service, day beds for swimming..
Food was superb (we had buffet as part of a conference)
Staff fantastic, very attentive.
Best Singapore slings in Singapore!"
Gr8 value BBQ & free flow for the Laydeez!,"Thursday night is Ladies Night around Singapore. This is an excellent, central location. Oysters and huge prawns, tasty roast duck, sausage, grilled veg, fish, chicken,beef- small but well done .... good choice of side dishes... the service is lovely and they are very quick to top up to your glass (prosecco, red/white wine. margaritas)..... the biggest downside is that it is by the pool and outside - Lord knows what happens when it rains (it does in Singapore occasionally!) and it is very hot and humid. There are a few fans but no a/c as it is totally open. I would do it again but probably with a small group of no more than 3 or 4.... it is quite a short serving period (6.30-9pm)"
Disappointed by lack of spread,"With wines and spirits thrown in, Sgd49++ was a great deal for ladies.
Buffet started at 630pm and ended at 9pm. Bbq included steaks, lamb chops, chicken, fish and prawns. Cooks were slow in toppinv up the servings and by 8pm, there was always at least a 10min wait just to taste the steaks. Roast duck platter was not refilled. Stir fry veg also had no refills after a diner emptied tgd mushrooms. Cold platter of prawns was the best, oysters not bad. Did not get to taste desserts as they were cleared out by the staff by 9pm. Unlike other buffets, the staff did not come round to alert us to take our last helping of food before they are cleared.
Saving grace was the good service by the waitresses and quality of good served.
Advice to future diners is to be there as early as possible and try to sample everything by 8pm. Else, it becomes a struggle with the limited choices left."
