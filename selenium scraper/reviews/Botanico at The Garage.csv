I specially thanks to hakim because he gave us a outdoor terrace seating which is very good.
we enjoyed the food as well.
thanks to their staff because they are very friendly. definately we will come back again.."
Divine Dining in Nature,"An absolutely delightful 5-course wine pairing dinner, starting with fried oysters and salmon (Asian style), belly pork in a bun, choice of grilled tenderloin or lamp rump, and perfectly complemented with coconut & ice cream dessert. Also tasted exciting wines from Georgia, Lebanon, Australia, Italy & Hungary!"
"Nice ambience and service, OK food","Had a 5 course dinner with my wife, courtesy of a birthday gift voucher. It is a great location, good ambience and service staff are friendly and efficient.
But first about the reservation. I had made reservation more than a week in advance but on the day of the dinner, received a call telling me that the venue was sold out (which was not true, more on that later) and that we will be seated outside. For one that is something I should be told on the day I make the reservation. It urns out they have a bi-weekly Dinner in the Dark on Wednesdays and that is why the entire inside of the restaurant was booked.
Any case since the outside seating was actually better,I did not bring it up after arrival. But this is something that needs to be handled better.
Now about the food: The courses were brought out promptly, and consisted of bread, beetroot salad, mushroom soup, snapper (for us, since we don't eat beef or pork) and dessert. Bread was a cupcake shaped croissant, and soup was watery and lacked enough taste, I make mushroom soup all the time and that tastes many times better; definitely something that can be improved. Beetroot salad was good, but served on purred goat cheese; I would have preferred a thick slice of the cheese so cutting the salad doesn't make a mess on the plate. The main was the biggest disappointment: snapper was overdone (the edges were actually crispy) and was served with eggplant. Strange choice since not everyone relishes eggplant, and the main did not come with any carb, so the meal overall was short on carbs. Dessert was a chocolate mousse with strong wine flavour and some chocolate crumbs filling. That in my opinion was the best part of the meal, besides the beetroot salad. One more thing: the meal also came with a chef's starter which was a round piece of stiff bread presented nicely
So overall a great venue but the course menu was average. Besides if you check out their menu, ordering 3-4 of these dishes would actually save you money."
Great service !,It was a nice ambience to celebrate birthday lunch for my bff . Thank you Hakim and Annabelle for the extended service which make us feel cosy at the restaurant . Will come back again ! Sheryl
Terrible treatment of guest reservation,"**Review is not about food** Made a reservation for Nov 16 dinner a month in advance (seats are only open to be booked 30d in advance, so that's as early as it gets), and got a call less than 3hrs before the reserved time slot to confirm my reservation and ""ask"" me if I am ok with outdoor seating since indoor was occupied by some paid events. The afternoon already saw heavy rain and we didn't want to risk dining with mosquitos so I refused to be seated outdoors, and the staff who called couldn't offer any other options. LMFAO, next time tell your booked guests earlier if they are gonna be stuck with something they might not want. Fwiw this could be a big night for the booked guests and you guys just screwed it up."
Great place and staffs are friendly,"Great staff, great food and great vibes!!!! Definitely a place I will come again, good venue for business and friend gathering!!!"
Amazing food and service!!,"The food was great, ambience was amazing and staff were extremely helpful. We love our visit so much and will definitely come back again!"
Good service and excellent food,Ambience was perfect and the food was great with the vegetables appetisers being particularly great. Will definitely return for another occasion.
Very friendly staff and great food in a lush environment,"Nestled in a beautiful and lush area of the Botanics garden we were happy to spend our evening out here with our two daughters 5 and 7 years old. Overall good quality food-wise and the cherry on the cake was really the service here. A special thanks to Hakim and the rest of the staff, they were all very professional and friendly and made their outmost to meet our various food allergies and special wishes. Would come back again"
review,Everything is good for the dining.Good service，good food，good attitude. It seems perfect for this dining.
Unconventional & Romantic Set Dinner With Warm Service,"We seldom ordered set menu and always prefer a la carte. Since there was a great promotion for 6-course set dinner with usual combination , we jumped at it .
The set dinner didn't disappoint and in fact rather rewarding and they came in tapas- portion .
The ambience was soothing and the service by Mel was highly personalised and warm. She was in fact an engineer by training.!
Suggest a short walk before or after the meal to partake the beautiful & romantic stroll in the UNESCO Botanic Gardens."
Sugata,Amazing food and excellent ambience. A must for romantic occasions. Pork Belly n Wagyu beef were truly scrumptious. Overall a very memorable experience.
Fantastic service & good food at Botanico!,"Lovely ambience and fairy light setting for dining alfresco! Was served by Vijay, and he was attentive, friendly, and had a great attitude towards serving us—appreciate it :) The food was very good, especially the wagyu beef cheeks, melt in your mouth and oh so tender—devoured every morsel of what was on the plate and left me wanting more! Would’ve loved to have a wider selection on their menu or bigger portions for their nibbles, but that’s nothing to discount this place on :) definitely not your everyday place, coz it is on the pricier side, but for special occasions and a night out with your girlfriends / date, Botanico will be a place I highly recommend, and you can’t go wrong with choosing this setting :)

Also thankful for the chocolate cake they served to celebrate my birthday :) so yummy!

I’ll be back some other time, maybe when there’s additional items on their menu, or special occasions! :) thank you everyone who served us, greeted us, and made us feel welcome. A job well done!"
Inappropriate behaviour of staff,"I was helping to do up a wedding decor.We were so preoccupied we didn’t notice a few of the Botanico staff were beside us with a ladder near our wedding arch. The arch had been painstaking set up by us under the tremendous heat. Their actions were swift and rough. Out of the blue,a 20+ year old staff from Botanico approached me in a hurried manner and muttered under his breath that he wanted the space we were occupying so that he could remove an item. He wasn’t looking at me when he was making his request and was far from being cordial. Then he heard a word that triggered him.It wasn’t from me. He turned and started yelling at me, this time looking at me with his bloodshot eyes. He ranted on and gesticulated wildly in front of my face. I am not a worker but the bride's friend.His team were also watching him behaving rudely to someone 30 years his senior. When he stopped, we went on to do our stuff. A minute later, another Botanico staff came and gave me a cold look. That afternoon, I called the manager who apologised on behalf of his staff but told me that his staff was overstretched that day and I just happened to be at the wrong place and at the wrong time. Perhaps relevant authorities could look into the emotional well-being of the staff. This pandemic has been very hard on everyone at all levels but aggression like this shouldn’t be tolerated. Respect and courtesy are our ways of life here where our fore-leaders have poured out their blood and sweat to build, aren't they?"
State of chairs used for wedding solemnisation,"Attention Management of Botanico,

I had just attended the wedding solemnisation of my niece on Saturday 15May21 1000hrs and was shocked to witness the pathetic state, ie badly stained white chairs used for the event at about 0915hrs.
This is a special event and how could your management not have taken note of those chair's deplorable state? I immediately informed Event Mgr Lynn, which was later made known to Mgr Vijay.
I can't fault the effort of your staff who'd tried their best to clean up the stains, however it was still an 'eye-sore' to all invited guests for the solemnisation. The fault lies squarely on shoulders of the management and those chairs should never be used again unless a 'back-cover/cushion' is draped over it for future events. Please see to it that above is carried out expeditiously to avoid angering your valuable guests/customers, which accounted for this average 3-star rating.
Please extend my heartfelt appreciation for a job well done to your Mgrs Amelia/Vijay, along with servers Cheryl, Priya and Gopi, who'd all work as a team during the lunch reception, ensuring the excellent service was carried out, to the delight of all guests, which warrants a Very Good 4-star rating.
Special mention to Amelia as she displayed professionalism and poise during customer interactions, most of all, being exemplary as a team leader."
Excellent dinner night,"Excellent dinner night at Botanico at the garage. Food was great, the setting very nice and the service good. I recommend this place."
Manager Ms Emz was very friendly,Manager Ms Emz was very friendly and accomodating. She really helped us to find the nicest wine d even gave us complietary congratulations cake for the bride and groom. She knows everythinh on the menu and all the suggested food is super dooper yummy. We all love the food here. Kudos to the Chef as well its a fusion of meditarranean and asian and european dish! Really love the ambience and venue also good for weddings and intimate dates! Thanks Ms Emz! Look for her she is totally super friendly and nice and cheerful!
Celebration Dinner,"A great restaurant to go for a special occasion or any other occasion. Very creative and well thought of dishes. They even have a separate menu for vegans. We did the 10 course vegan tasting menu, wagyu beef cheeks, wagyu rump cap and herbal chicken. Had a wonderful dinner."
Southeast Asian inspired flavors,"Fantastic and interesting food available. Had the laksa ceviche, beef taco, crab risoni, pork belly and ondeh ondeh. Would recommend all. Service was great too."
"STUNNING, AMIABLE SERVICE",Beautiful ambience with staff that have truly shown the spirit of uplifting the mood for all diners. Thank you for making this birthday memorable!
Dinner,Had a dinner with my family. Food was superb from appitizer to dinner.. One of the Best service by emz.
Botanica,"I loooveeee the place! Very Cozy! Emz is very accomodating and very helpful. I can feel her sincerity with her actions and tone of voice. All her recommendations are the best! Will definitely come back again!

Rai & Shine Dizon"
Great birthday celebration! Thanks Emz and team!,We were a group of 5 friends celebrating my 40' and Emz and the team managed to accommodate us outside and we had an amazing time. Food and service were excellent! Thanks!!
Great service from Emz and delicious food!,"Nice ambience, delectable and unique dishes, matched with unparalleled service from Emz!
Will return!
Kenneth and Jil"
Great evening: good food & good service,"Came on a Tuesday evening for a family dinner. We had fabulous service from all, including a most delightful Amelina who took our orders and gave great recommendations. All the dishes were good. For mains, we particularly liked the wagyu beef cheek and crab rissoni. The lamb neck curry was good, while the assam snapper was ok.

For starters, both the rojak and assam laksa ceviche were great. For dessert, both lemongrass panna and ondeh ondeh were great. The Botanico team kindly gave our special dessert to my parents who were celebrating their wedding anniversary, really sweet of them. A lovely evening. We will be back to try more dishes. If you buy Chope vouchers its a pretty good deal :)"
Food (phenomenal) 6/5 Ambience 3/5 service 2/5,"It's our third time visiting Botanico. We keep coming back for the Laksa ceviche, wagyu beef and cauliflower and every single time, they never fail to disappoint. We also tried the new dishes crab orzo and herbal chicken which were mind-blowing. The exquisite blend of Asian and European flavors. The great ingredients. Compliments to the chef.
Also recently learnt that they cater 10-course menus for vegans and vegetarians as well.

Here's why service and ambience ratings were low.
Music was really inconsistent, soft at times and really loud at times. Lights were too bright. Toilet is dirty but the place is beautiful so they deserve a 3. Service crew were often out of sight and I had to stand up and walk to them to get their attention to get our water glasses filled. When food and drinks was served, they just put the food and drinks at random instead of asking who's having which of the dish or drink. This is a restaurant, shouldn't each guest at the table be served their dish since we chose our individual dishes ourselves when our order was taken? Lastly, Our bill took 15minutes,considering the fact the restaurant was pretty empty towards the end of the meal.

This review would have been a 5stars. I seldom do reviews this is my 2nd. but for this experience I really hope the management would take into consideration my comments. The lack in service truly dampened our mood. Nevertheless, we will be back for dinner."
Great dinner and excellent service by Cina :),Cina was really friendly and food was good! It was a perfect ambience and decor for a birthday celebration/ date night. Her bubbly personality made our dinner so enjoyable! It was a pleasant meal at Botanica and will definitely return.
Lovely post exam dinner with the fam at Botanical!,"Everything was perfect , the food, cocktails and ambienc. But what really stood out was the service by Ms Amelina- who attended to our family of 4 with utmost care and sharing her good recommendations. Would definitely visit again!yy"
amazing food,the asparagus tempura was very nice and the ambience was very relaxing :)) would recommend if you are looking for a chill place
"Very good food, refined","Very good food, refined with a good mix of spice and good cocktails. Good service as well and good dessert. The outdoor is very nice. Although the inside is a bit bright for a romantic dinner"
"Food is average, but great location and service","The food is average for the price, but the location and service quality by Amelina made up for it. We had a 4 course lunch menu. Recommended dishes: Appetizer: Chee cheong fun. Main: Sambal fish. Dessert: Ondeh ondeh and jalapeño ice cream."
Great service from staff!,"Pretty lights, with enough space between tables (so you don't overhear each other's conversation). Staff were all super friendly and accommodating, shout out to Emz, Amelina and Vijay!"
love it,REALLY LOVE the slow cooked pork belly!!!!!!! everyone agreed that's rlly good. i loved the oyster too!!! the sauce that came w it made it taste better than other oysters i had :-) everything else was not too bad too but here's a little shoutout to the asparagus tempura and baby squid. mojito was nice too :)) service tooooo will be back for the pork!!!!!
Very nice :),the food and drinks were amazing. the staff was very friendly. great experience and will definitely visit again.
Lovely location and friendly staff,Lovely location and very friendly staff. The food was nice and we had a great time for our anniversary brunch
"Brunch, Coffee and Cake","Initially, got table on ground level. Later discovered the restaurant on second level. Manage to get a table. Ordered TOMATO BASIL GOUDA “LATTE” with grilled sourdough, SEASONAL TOMATOES, BIG BREAKFAST, CHOCOLATE MERLOT CAKE and Cappuccino. Food is good and service was fast."
A place to come back to,"This place has a nice ambience and the food was amazing. The menu may not have much variant but the quality is good. The tasting menu is great and one can try the different food available. I would like to commend Amelina for her great service, friendliness and going extra mile to be attentive. Highly recommended"
"Amazing Ambiance, Great Food.","Innovative and interesting menu. Traditional with a twist. A bit ""inaccessible"" or easier if you drive. if you don't mind a nice walk in the garden it's well worth it. its a lovely place to chill and have a quiet dinner with friends. Veg options are avail."
Amelina was an attentive host,Amelina was an attentive host and Chef (unfortunately I didn’t get her name) had a pretty good tasting menu planned
Service is great by Amelina.,Service is great by Amelina. Food is ok only... pls dont order smoked duck which is very disappointing.
Delicious food! Good service,"First restaurant visited post service breaker and it did not disappoint!
Food was delicious! We tried almost all the vegetarian options and apart from the “tomato basil Gouda latte” I would recommend all of them. Such good nibbles and main dishes
Only cons were the service was a bit off based on the raves I see in other reviews. Definitely not on point tonight. The wine selection isn’t great- a bit disappointed on the lack of choices
Apart from that will definitely be coming back! It’s a nice break back to normalcy"
Birthday celebration,"Nice place to have a dinner, enjoy the relax environment, the food portion is just good enough for me,"
"Great service by the hostess, Amelina","We got in very late but Ms Amelina has treated us very well with awesome service. She recommended a nice bottle of wine and recommend perfect main course to pair with.

We will visit again for sure."
Thank you VJ!,"Great service from the manager tonight. He always made sure we were being taken well care of. We asked him to help us take some photos and he was very kind to help, he even took a photo from his own phone and surprised us with a printed photo when we checked out. Thank you VJ!

Food was great, wagyu beef cheek was our highlight tonight. Very tender!

Vibe was fantastic. I’d say the secret garden is the most romantic place in Singapore for couples. I was worried that it might be too warm at the garden given it is an alfresco dining area, but they have cool air flowing so it felt like Spring here. I was wearing long sleeves and pants and was very comfortable just like at home."
Birthday Dinner at Botanico,"My bestie and I celebrated my birthday here and we were served by Ameline. She was the hostess I believe, very very sweet and friendly lady! She also helped take photos of us to be printed to commemorate the occasion. The food was good, the Chef came out to talk to the diners which was great. I’d go back not just for the food, but also the service. The staff truly made the experience fantastic!"
Food was very good and so,Food was very good and so was the service. Love the ambience and atmosphere as well. 10/10 Would recommend
Review,The customer service staff are excellent! All of them are very friendly and efficient. Will definitely visit here again!
Wonderful place with pleasant service crew/staff.,"I have wonderful experience dining here. Although it was my first but it won’t be my last! Worth every cent. The food and the environment well blend together, not to forget their service crew/staff, especially the one that I encounter (won’t mentioned specific date) staff named Amelina. Good job. I truly appreciate it. Thanks!"
A good dating place,Beautiful decoration and comfortable dining environment，The service staff is very kind. The food is exquisite. The food is exquisite. We ordered the set menu and the wine paired well
Awesome ambience and sumptuous tasting menu,"We had the tasting menu and every dish was bursting with flavours. The service was impeccable and every dish was sumptuous. The ambience is one of the most romantic I’ve seen, with the fairy lights and leafy walls. Definitely recommended, especially for special occasions."
Friday Night out,We had a pleasant 'fridate' at the botanico. The food was great and the ambience and environment was great too. Would highly recommend anyone looking for a place to chill on a friday night.
Botanico,food was great and service was excellent. the staff were friendly which made our dinner a memorable one
"Great environment, but otherwise average","Located in the heart of the botanic gardens, the restaurant is located on the second floor of what looks like a colonial style house. There’s an indoor air conditioned area, and also a lovely alfresco space with plenty of fairy lights to excite anyone going ‘for the gram’.

That’s most of the good stuff summarized. Service could be better. No issues with the waiters who served our food and took our orders that night, though we thought the lady at front of house could have been more attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. When we decided to switch to another side of the table because the A/C was blowing straight at us, the lady clearly did not get the hint and we had to shift all the cutlery and table set up by ourselves, including the water that she continued to serve at the original seats. Granted it’s not fine dining and this is not a deal breaker, but for the prices it commands, I would have expected some service consistency.

As for the food, I enjoyed the bread of the day and its accompanying condiments, as well as the corn panipuri which had an interesting presentation style in line with its “botanical” theme. Foie gras latte and the ondeh ondeh dessert was good as well, though rather heavy in tastes (very creamy for the soup and rather sweet for the dessert). Mains were okay, but seemed to be missing something so did not wow us.

At the end, our bill ran up to $165 which I’m not sure is an amount I would pay given the overall experience. Thankfully I got some vouchers at a discount which made it easier to swallow."
Excellent cuisine and beautiful location,"This was one of the best meals I’ve had in Singapore for a long time. Everything we tried was exceptional and I particularly enjoyed the Hokkaido Scallops. Nice ambiance too and best of all they serve Archipelago beer on tap (by far the best local beer!).

The service was typically Singaporean - ie sub standard and our waiter knew nothing about any of the dishes. But that is normal and should not put you off going for what was an otherwise amazing experience."
Wedding experience,Was recently at the botanico for a wedding reception and I was really impressed with the ambience and comfy surroundings the restaurant provided. Not forgetting the fact that their food was superb despite the event being a catered event and they had to ensure the consistency of food for over 100+ pax. Will definitely visit again!
Good food let down by terrible service,"Service is amateurish at best. Took us 40min to get our food (including 10min where we observed the waiter taking our plates to another table and then taking them back to the kitchen in confusion before eventually returning to us). Then it took us another 40min to get the bill from the time when we called for it. Not to mention that not once during our visit did they offer to refill our glasses.

The food was very good though and for this reason only, this place avoids a one star rating."
Food far exceeded expectations,"I booked in advance for a group of 30 people. The restaurant kindly put together a suitable four-course menu which was reasonably priced but with enough options that there was something for everyone (meat/fish/veg for each course). We were seated on the outside terrace, which was perfect. It was very peaceful, and although outside if felt very private and cosy (and dry, despite all the rain). I wasn't expecting too much from the food given the number of people to be served at once, but the food was amazing - fresh, delicious and beautifully presented. It was one of the best meals I've had for a long time. Everyone was extremely pleased with their choice, whichever one they'd gone for. There was a slight mix-up with the starters we'd pre-ordered, but I still give five stars as the staff rectified this quietly without any fuss. The service was very friendly and the staff helpful. Drinks weren't cheap, but probably what's expected in Singapore."
Impressive food,"I attended a wedding here and I gotta say I was very happy with the food. The place also has a nature, minimalistic look."
Private Lunch at the Botanico at the Garage,"We have a private event at the 2 floor of the Botanico at the Garage, the venue is big enough to host 60 pax. We had buffet and drink package for the group. Food and drink is nice, staffs are very accommodating and helpful. We had a great event."
Kudos to Nina!,Had my birthday dinner here and Nina did a great job! From food knowledge to assistance we felt her sincerity! Thank you Nina and The Garage!
Lovely Breakfast,"We had breakfast here in September 2019, the restaurant has nice fans, very pleasant. The attendant at the front was very informative of menu, well done!"
The best brunch Oysters I have ever had.,I arrived a little bit late but was allowed a table as the management didn’t want me to rush. The balance of ingredients in all the dishes as exceptional. The setting is cool and ambient inside and colonial style outside which compliments the delicate flavours beautifully. Most impressed with the chefs talent care and attention to detail. Sunday brunch at its finest - Bravi ❤️
Unforgettable Experience,"I would like to give special thanks and mention to Sally from Botanico at the Garage. She has been really helpful and warm hearted thorough my interaction with her. On top of that, the food was tasty. Had tried the Truffle Mushrooms and Waffles. Ingredients were fresh and sauce was flavorful. Waffles were really crispy, much to my pleasant surprise. What more can you ask for when you can enjoy delectable food with the beauty of SBG! Surely I will be back and recommend to my friends and relatives for any occasion. 2 thumbs up! Keep it up"
Beautiful,I was great experience there.. Wide variety of plants and flowers I have seen.. If you are nature lover then must visit place..
The best restaurant near the Botanical Gardens,"A really lovely spot, right by the Botanical Gardens, with a chilled out terrace alongside the more formal inside dining room. The service was incredibly friendly, the food very good and great value for money (for Singapore). I have to single out my waitress Sally, who was very sweet and welcoming, making this particular dinner the best meal out I experienced during an entire two weeks in Singapore."
The Best White Gazpacho,"Botanical is set within the Singapore Botanic Gardens with both indoor and outdoor options.

The decor is relaxed but refined providing a great ambiance.

We had three courses each for six people and every dish was spectacular.

The white gazpacho is one of the best dishes I’ve ever eaten!

The wine list is also great and the signature cocktails creative and worth trying.

.... and the wait staff complete the package."
Birthday Dinner at Botanico with family,"Good ambience accentuated by an awesome live band which delivered our song requests with aplomb and Jazzy twist. Dishes, which came in tasting portions, were original, bold and inspiring. Unorthodox but tasty. Great, great value for the price."
Chill place but,"We have been to Botanico several times. It’s a nice and relaxing place with good service and food. It’s close to where we stay so it’s like our local place to hangout. The only downside is the small food portion and miserable wine serving.

For me and my husband it’s not really an issue as we have small appetites. But if you are one of those who has a bigger appetite, you might find the place expensive or go home and snack on something."
GREEN AND LEAN,"We ordered from the Brunch menu, choosing a la cart. Selection was good and while the portions were not large, the taste and presentation were very good. A better choice would have been from the set brunch menu. Staff were very friendly and the setting is relaxing being on the edge of the Botanic Gardens."
Great atmosphere and interesting food,"Food was great, especially the 5 course set dinner which proved to be great value! Must orders are the Mushroom Latte and Curry Lamb which were so satisfying"
Amazing,"I brought my other half here to celebrate her birthday and she enjoyed much.

A very welcoming entrance walking up the green carpeted stairway into an elegant interior seating, or a nature outdoor seating. There's mobile air-conditioning and adequate shelter so don't worry about temperature.

The food is great. Portions may seem small at first glance but it is actually very well portioned. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience, the service from the wait staff is good as well. Certainly worth a return trip.

A little more expensive than typical cafes but totally worth it. Will return!

She's thinking of holding a wedding right at Botanico."
European Affair,"One of the very beautiful restaurants set in the middle of the Botanical Gardens. The set up inside is simple yet elegant. We went for a four course brunch but not from the set menu though. To start with, we ordered something to drink to set the mood followed with Bread of the day and Soup. Then came the Mains and finally some Dessert to end with. The food in general was good, and I specially enjoyed the bread of the day along with soup. Overall a good place to spent a lazy sunday brunch with your friends or family."
Botanico at the Garage,"The restaurant ambience is excellent for a nice cosy dinner and quiet conversation. Food wise, very pleasant and presentation were really good. Portion wise also just right without being overwhelming. Do try their Garage Gin’onic which is very refreshing. T&S"
A Model Response to Customer Dissatisfaction,"What do you do when a customer expressed deep dissatisfaction over the quality of service? Mr. Nur Mohammed, the dining manager, did the right thing. In my previous review, I expressed my disappointment over the service experienced during a Mother's Day dinner there. Nur called to find out what happened, apologized un reservedly and invited us back for a complementary dinner to show his sincerity. We accepted his invitation graciously; the food was very good, the quality of service improved significantly. I complimented Nur for what he has done to regain the goodwill of his customers. (Note: We learnt that the evening we were there, their senior staff was involved in an accident and they were short of staff.)"
An interesting mix of hits and misses.,"Let's start with the positives... great location, lovely ambience. The menu is nicely thought out and presented, with an interesting selection of wines. We started with the Hokkaido scallop carpacio, which was excellent! Skipping to dessert, we selected the lemongrass panna cotta and the chocolate merlot infused cake. Both to die for!

Unfortunately, our mains selection was less successful. We selected the red bass served on couscous with what was described as orange braised fennel and fennel salad. Have to say it did not look or taste like fennel...more like a Savoy cabbage. It was not the fresh sharp accompaniment we were expecting.

Service was friendly but not quite there."
Tasty Drinks & Delicious Food,"Three's a crowd, but not one that'd I'd mind mingling with if it's with these three. Go nice & slow because tasty drinks are dangerous - the alcoholic punch only hits you thereafter!

Botanico's Lavender Martini ($19++), a gin-based cocktail with the best of both worlds of lavender & elderflower, was pleasant & fragrant... Dangerously so, because all you want to do is keep drinking!

The Orange Daze ($19++), which packs a punch with tequila, zesty green apple & orange with hints of mint & thyme, is also a winner for those who enjoy citrusy drinks.

My choice of poison, the Turmeric Twist ($20++), contains gin which I've lately been super into, & has the kick from turmeric (that makes it a healthy drink, right??) which I enjoy. The laksa leaves, along with the mint, make it fairly interesting as well. Would definitely order this again

Nestled inside the beautiful Botanic Gardens, I've always walked past The Garage, which used to actually function as an automobile garage, but never stepped inside. I was in awe as I walked up the stairs on the side of the building to discover Botanico so tastefully furnished. The fairy lights, while personally not quite my aesthetic, are ever-so-dreamy & I can definitely imagine this would be very popular amongst those who love taking pretty photos.

What impressed me about Botanico is that the outdoor area (where we started off with some tasty, innovative cocktails) is actually air-conditioned too. & it is particularly well executed with tentage that keeps the cool air in, yet allows the ""freshness"" of being surrounded by lush greenery to permeate & make you feel relaxed. No more worrying about being sweaty on your romantic dates

Thanks @botanicosg, Nick & KY for the hospitality, & @veronicaphua for the invite!

Accepts credit cards
Air-conditioned seats available

Excellent service.,"Excellent service provided by Sally Ong. Thanks for making my visit a memorable moment with my son in this special occasion. Foods are excellent!! A very Nice atmosphere for family, couple & friends."
Good meal,Great meal! Vijay served us well. Make sure to try the Inka dishes. Good for groups and families. :)
Fantastic!,Amazing mix of east and west cuisine. Every bite was a burst of flavour. The venue was so relaxing and service was great.
Lovely ambience but poor service,My family went there to celebrate Mother's Day early. The ambience is lovely because it is in the midst of Botanic Gardens. We ordered two of the dinner sets and a main dish of beef. The portions are small and the quality is ok. But the service was terrible. We were the first to arrive but almost the last group to leave because it took them such a long time to serve us - more than two hours. It was obvious that the staff was poorly trained because they kept on serving the wrong tables! It was unbelieveable.
Attentive!,"booked a table for 12 for a class gathering involving young children. Thoughtful staff called to confirm table arrangements and set us in a quiet corner. Captain Vijay was very attentive and settled us down nicely. Kids menu was yummy , even my picky son finished everything and asked for more. The rest of us found the food options interesting including vegetarian options. I’ll definitely be back!"
Love the ambience & attentiveness of the staff,"We went there to celebrate my bf’s birthday and we had a great experience! Loved the ambience and one of the staffs, Nina, took note that we were here for a birthday & prepared a cake for us before I even asked. She took great photos for us too! ☺️"
Cute,"So nice a place. After a tiring walk through trails in different sections of Singapore Botanic Gardend, one has the option to walking into this well appointed facility to sip a Can of chilled Beer followed by choicest items. Observed that many people drive down from the City to enjoy solitude, mouth watering preperations and get recharged."
Vday dinner,Great experience at Botanico. Nice ambience with both indoor and outdoor seats. Staff were attentive. A great place to chillax away from the busy city.
Great Sunday Brunch,This place is great. Their Sunday brunch is great and reasonable priced. IS a hidden gem in Singapore. Service was excellent. Their terrace is open but with Air condition. :-)
Charming place,I had a pitstop in this place after my walk in the beautiful botanic gardens. Nice terrace in the shade with attentive staff and good service.
Elegant but very small portions,"The foie gras latte was sublime! It is the most satisfying starter one can get in this part of town! The portions were very modest though, we were still hungry after a starter and a main each and had to order extra. Was tasty though!"
Escape from the heat,Looking for a quiet spot to shelter from the hot Singapore sun at the gardens we were delighted to find Botanico at the Garage. Had a lovely lunch with great service.
The best place to enjoy fine food at Singapore Botanic Gardens,"When we first walked past, the Garage at Singapore Botanic Gardens looked very busy and hot - but don't walk past - go upstairs to Botanico! It has a wonderful, cool verandah and the most exceptionally good food. I tried the three starters and each was outstanding. The chef is a gem. Try the oysters, the cauliflower, and the croquettes. Absolutely delicious. A wonderful place to escape the heat and enjoy outstanding food and service."
Great experience,"Went there with my partner for Valentine’s Day dinner. Although there was a crowd at the restaurant, the wait for the food was worth it as the quality of the food served was great and the service staff were very friendly.

Definitely a 10/10 experience for me and I would definitely return to patronize again!"
"Excellent food, service and ambience",My partner and i were contemplating and finally decide to have our valentine's day dinner over at Botanico and we had no regrets. The food was consistently top-notch. Excellent service!! Nice Ambience!! Overall a good experience and would definitely go back again!
"Lovely setting, nice food","Service was wonderful, friendly and prompt and most dishes were inventive, tasty, interesting and well presented. Great value for money though with nice portions and prices. Great location in the gardens and up high and well lit inside. Try to get a table outside (if evening) although we were told fully booked (although after two hours only one couple there). The snacks, appetizers and desserts were wonderful. Mains not quite to the same level or interest - fairly staid. Decor could be livened inside rather than couples tables flat on the edges like a cafe. Sweep the entrance stairs so one doesn’t feel it’s a backdoor entry. Noted there was a dress code, but it’s not enforced with one lady in gym clothes. Would return"
Excellent food,"Great location, amongst greenery. We had the 5 course set menu and it was excellent food. The started with octopus and oysters were great. The highlight was the beef cheek main. The soups/lattes were also very creative. We had truffle mushroom soup served as a latte and white gazpacho."
Special night,"We went there for my birthday and the staff were so lovely. They made the evening very special for me. We sat outside, which is actually a covered area and is surrounded by beautiful gardens. It is a lovely location. They have air conditioning outside as well, which helps.
We shared the croquettes for a starter and then I had the beef cheeks and my husband had the slipper lobsters. Both, were beautifully cooked and really tasty.
The wine list for wine by the glass only offers two white wine choices, which is limiting.
For desert we shared the lemongrass panna cotta with the ginger ice-cream. Really lovely.
Great staff, great food, perfect ambiance in the outdoors area.
Thanks to Rey and everyone else for making it a special night."
Awful,"The service was shocking, our group spent about 2k SGD, service was slow, food was average, wrong orders, no reaction to any of our comments.
Lovely ambience and location though, I think with some training, and an improvement on the food + drink quality this place would be a gem"
nothing to rave about,"sitting at the terrace area surrounded by lush greenery is nice i suppose if u like such environment but its nothing to rave about. the band is nice with a very good voice lead female singer. service is on a whimp, initially was sub par with only 2 tables at that time.. wondered if he heard my comment .. it improved during the night. pricy for the serving size, taste is fine but nothing to shout about.. think they gg for a bit of fine dining portion in casual environment concept. i would not go revisit for no reason.. maybe for those couple trying to impress each other but suggest go elsewhere .. spent abt $350 for 6 pax but still feel a bit peckish.."
Dinner in the Garden,Went to Botanico at the Garage Restaurant in the Botanic Gardens. Had a nice dinner with a business colleague. The ambience was very nice and quiet for meaningful and private conversation. Food was good and in the right portion and tested good. Must visit and try.
Fancy local place,"This fancy local restaurant is well regarded by locals for the ambience and food. We were there as a group and pre-selected the food, so they had a chance of prepare it without implying in too much wait. Food was good but not memorable (to my taste), If I were not part of a group, I would have preferred a small less fancy place."
Delightful,Visited with friends for dinner. Its another secret garden in Singapore. The ambience is very cosy & nice. The food is surprisingly interesting & its good. The service is excellent from the minute we arrive. Overall it is a very delightful experience. The location though is a little hard to find but its worth the journey. Make sure you tell the taxi driver to bring you to No50 Cluny park Road instead of just Cluny road. The restaurant is on the top floor. U can choose to dine indoors or outdoor. The ground floor is a cafe bistro where u can relax & chat with your friends after dinner. I would certainly recommend you try it at least once.
Dinner for 2,"We never tried this place before and we decided to have a dinner during the weekday.
Very quiet, nice outdoor seating surrounded by the forest.
Interesting mix of tastes, spice and flavor.
Definitely the place to try something unusual.
Service efficient and friendly.
A bit expensive."
