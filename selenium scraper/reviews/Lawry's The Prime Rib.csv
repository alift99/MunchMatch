Excellent Place for service & food,"The service was good with attentive waitress ready to serve to our needs. And the food was cook to perfection. Never had such tender, juicy steak. They really lift up to the expectation of the brand with wonderful ambiance. Was surprised the meal comes with complimentary accompanies of salad and bread rolls. The bread rolls are soft and hot served with butter. Salad was serve with generous portions. We ordered crab cake, 2 piece of single lobster, duck liver and mudpie along. The lobster was cooked to perfection. The crab cake was crispy on the outside and tender when bite in. The duck liver was very smooth; served hot; accompanied with sweet raisin sauce. It's to die for. The mudpie served was very refreshing, flavor of coffee, chocolate and vanilla ice-cream served with fudge and nuts. Overall the place is worth to visit for the price we're paying for. Thumbs up to the chefs and service staff giving us a wonderful experience."
Over-priced and mediocre food,"Food was mainly mediocre except for the cod fish which was very fresh and tasty. The lobsters didn‚Äôt smell fresh nor taste good. Dessert was a let-down too. ‚ÄúSundae‚Äù was merely a scoop of ice- cream with a slight drizzle of fudge. ‚ÄúMud- pie‚Äù was basically a very frozen ice-cream in shape of a cake slice with a tiny cup of fudge served at the side. There are no nuts, fruits, toppings whatsoever that could make them look tantalizing except for a tiny candied cherry each. Even with the promotional discount they threw in, the discounted price we paid still felt very over-priced."
Prime rib not even half the taste of Lawrys in the US,Execution is totally lacking. Bread roll served with packaged butter doesn‚Äôt quite fit the stature of the restaurant. What happened to the sour dough? Not sure the quality of beef but felt like taste and texture was lacking. Serving temperature of prime rib and beef was on the cold side. Puts the Lawrys brand to shame!!
A place I call excellence on Orchard,"Whenever i find myself in the Orchard area, which is close to my residence whilst in the beautiful and safe city of Singapore that has virtually everything i would make it a point especially if it is a sunday to drop by Lawrys! The staffs always treat me in such a manner that make me feel like i am royalty! Without a doubt please just have their prime rib, which is to DIE FOR! I wonder which cut will be your favourite? Iv got my own, aint on the menu, but apparently no one else but me can tackle that till today over here in Singapore......."
Christmas Lunch,"Horrible Christmas Meal, was so shocked at the bad service but worst was the food, not at all as expected. The only thing that made our Christmas lunch salvageable was the kind elderly gentleman who served us towards the end"
Environment Accompanied by great food,"The second time having fine dining. I would say that it definitely lives up to expectation, My wife and I got a medium rare steak accompanied with wine. The food and service was good. The view looking down onto orchard road at night played a good part in our meal."
Not a fan,"The food wasnt up to par, steak was cooked to well done even though I asked for medium. They did change it though, hence the good service. The meat was really flat and wide. I expected a thicker cut which was really disappointing. Meat was really lean and tough to chew on. Service was good, food just wasn‚Äôt For me."
Good but not memorable,The prime rib cart and spinning salad are novelties but the food was good but not great. Wine selection was very expensive for wines that are not that high end. Ambience is okay and service okay too.
Wonderful Meal at Lawry's,"This isy first visit. Great and proactive services by staff, wonderful beef steak and sides. Will definitely visit again."
Lawry‚Äôs Singapore compared to Vegas and Los Angeles,The salad dressing is a tad more sour than the other location and it seems the meat quality is not as tender as the one in Vegas or Los Angeles. As an American tourist I wouldn‚Äôt recommend eating Lawry‚Äôs in Singapore. However the foie gras starter was excellent. Service was not up to standard and the cost was not worth it.
Celebration for my nieces,"The food, services and ambience are excellent. I‚Äôm glad I decided to bring my nieces to celebrate. :)"
Happy Guest,"Tender steak and so juicy. We liked the ambience and service at Lawry‚Äôs. Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt get our server‚Äôs name. Will recommend this to others."
Good food and service,"Had dinner with family on thanksgiving, excellent food and services , especially I loved the pumpkin soup and really enjoyed the Prime rib with turkey and not to forget the Lobster Tail which was amazing.

Many thanks to Lawry's for the memorial day with my family."
Quality well done.,"I have visited for the longest time. Although being a steak restaurant, their choice of seafood has been intriguing. My fiance being a steak lover, this is his go to restaurant. This time around I had a trio platter of salmon, snapper and seabass on their special menu for Thanksgiving. All cooked to perfection served with a mixture of sauces. It was definitely an adventure to my taste buds. Greedy me also has the turkey. 3 slices were so soft and well cook throughout. They have amazed me this time around. If you are contemplating, always pick Lawrys for they well accommodate."
Crazy Prices and Bad Food,"I had high hopes based on stories about the American locations, but we had a bad experience.

First, dinner for two with no alcohol cost over 300 USD. For that, you should get perfect food. In the US, a similar meal would cost half as much.

Expense aside, the food isn't good.

The spinning salad is very ordinary. They ran out of their signature shrimp cocktail, so we had a tiny lobster tail. It was okay, but not worth $36.

The prime rib was tough and underseasoned, in addition to being small. A good prime rib is tender and has a nice browned crust.

The mashed potatoes were bland and lacking in seasoning. They were way too uniform, as though prepared in a machine. The gravy was about like canned gravy.

The other vegetable sides were boring and tasted like institutional food.

We had creme brulee. It was very small, and the texture was runny.

Lawry's sells soft drinks in containers, not fountain drinks. Forget the free refills Americans are used to.

The service was good, the staff was very polite, and the restaurant itself was very nice.

Asians who don't know American food probably think this place is great because it looks like an American steakhouse, but I'm American, so I am very familiar with places like Ruth's, Morton's, and Smith & Wollensky. In America, this place would close in two months. To stay open, they would have to drop the meal price to around $25 per person. Their food is about as good as Golden Corral's.

Great for Asians? Maybe. Americans should steer clear."
Good food and good experience,"First time visiting Lawry's to celebrate our wedding anniversary, the service staff were very polite and guided us to a window seat. Service was prompt and the staff offered to give us some recommendations on the food. They checked in constantly throughout our meal to ensure that we were well taken care of. I can see that the staff enjoyed working there as well. The two staff who were attending to us were Tuti and Joshi."
Dinner,"Very good as usual, my 5th visit here Thanks Ratheika for your service! Definitely worth giving 5 stars service from you!"
Fantastic evening,"Very quiet place, amazing food and very professional people, highly suggested! The waitress Ratheika has been wonderful!"
Lacklustre,"Service was their strong suit, attentive and friendly. Their food was generally middling and honestly quite disappointing at this price point. We had a decent sampling of 2 appetisers and 3 mains with added sides, and out of everything only enjoyed their prime rib. The lamb chop was so surprisingly poor we had to send it back, regrettably. Lobster wasn't too fresh either, with a noticeable fishy odor. Perhaps I found them on a bad day but I left quite disappointed overall"
Birthday Celebration,"This is the 4th time we visited Lawry's for celebration of our family events since 2019 (wife's birthday, son's birthdayand christmas), didn't manage to visit during covid in 2020 and 2021.

Asked about the soft toy for the kids meal but was informed due to supplier problem, there was no stock. Disappointed as my boy loved his 1st 3 Lawry's soft toys very much and was looking forward to the 4th one.

Standard at Lawry's has definitely suffered due to the recent inflation after covid restriction was lifted but we still enjoyed the food very much.

Time for Lawry's to review some processes like getting an alternate supplier to ensure there is stock for the famous Lawry's soft toy for the children instead of a reusable mask that will provide free advertising when used."
First experience and Bday dinner,"Food was excellent and Ratheika was very friendly and recommended what was good. Lobster Bisque was creamy and thick, the steak was juicy and the truffle lamb was amazing! Only got our spinach cream missed out but the sizzler mushroom was nice. Had a complimentary slice of Cake and our picture take by the host and printed out immediately for us. All in all service was superb and food is great, a pleasant birthday celebration."
Lawry's,"Good food, Good place! And Excellent service by Sue, Jazz, Janice and Eric! Keep it up! Definitely going back!"
Date night,"My bf and I had such a wonderful time there:) great food, great service (Special shout out to Joshi, Remy and Ratheika ) üíïüíïüíï thank you!"
Great Food and Customer Experience,"Worth the price. Highly recommended. Customer Service was superb. Wont be our last. We booked on a Wednesday, and luckily there was a promotion of 30% on all their steak."
Wife's birthday,"Food and ambience was great, really enjoyed myself. Waiters that attended to us gave us the right amount of attention and privacy."
Wonderful Visit,"After a long time, had a chance to visit again at lawrys. It was very good dining experience. Thanks to the staff specifically to Jazz, Tuti who give us excellent service. Would like to commend the spinning bowl salad that was done by Janice. Lastly, Thank you to Chef Eric who never failed me with the very good Prime Rib and will never forget Mr. Imran who assist me with my drinks orther and help me with my nephew‚Äôs food. Thank you!"
Birthdays Celebration,The prime steak is perfectly cut by Chef Eric. The service from him was amazing and delightful!. Would definitely come back here again!
Birthday celebration for my partner,Amazing experience at Lawry‚Äôs today. The ambience was really nice and chef eric was really friendly and generous. The steak was cut perfectly and also was given a cake!! and was able to take the couple photo back home too.
Try‚Äôs to hard,"Best part of a meal was the wine which we enjoyed‚Ä¶ stake was just ok given price. We ordered medium rare and came well done. (Maids costumes clash with atmosphere, better if all chic)."
Always an excellent choice,"My wife and I went to have dinner there for the first time since March 2020 (before lockdown). Everything is the as nice as it always was. We had our usual Lawry‚Äôs cut, which was always the perfect choice for us."
Billy‚Äôs Birthday,I‚Äôve been celebrating my birthdays dinners at Lawry‚Äôs since 2009 for its 50% birthday dinner deals and birthday photo! The grade of the cut and the ambience is comfortable
"Great services, foods and ambience !!","Kudos to Ms Mona, Mr Raymond and all the staffs!!! üëçüèº Enjoyed ourselves... Thank you for the wonderful and relaxing service!"
Ultimate Dining Experience as always! : ),"i have always been looking forward dining at Lawry‚Äôs! given that they offer amazing top notch quality food! It‚Äôs the quality of service that i am truly at awe! The team in Lawry‚Äôs has never failed to make you feel welcomed always warmed smile and very courteous! Shoutout to Sue, jazz,mona and tuti for making my bestfriend birthday extra special! kudos guys!"
lawrys night,"haven't gone to Lawrys for years because of the pandemic......came back to our favorite prime rib. best service, best food, it is like just yesterday. thank you Lawrys Singapore"
Top-notch service & food,"Had a dinner date with hubby here. Seafood option was excellent (even though it is a place also known for ribs). Staff were helpful and accommodating. And when I gave feedback regarding the beef, the service recovery by Manager Shiva was wonderfully warm and generous. Thank you Chef Eric, Zul, Suzzana, Mona and Janice for the wonderful time. Hoping to be back again!"
Birthday lunch,The service is excellent. sue and rathrika serve us and they were both very attentive and polite. 6 stars to both their service
One of the best services I‚Äôve ever experienced!,"Went to Lawry‚Äôs for a birthday celebration. From the front desk, we were already greeted with smiles and the staff welcomed us warmly to our table.

Everything from the starters up until the desserts, the service they gave us was outstanding and the staff we all friendly. Wine was consistently and continuously poured for us, the staff made sure that all our requests are not only fulfilled but fulfilled gracefully, and they made sure that we were comfortable during our dining experience.

The salad was prepared in a unique way wherein they‚Äôll spin a bowl which is on top of ice in front of the diners and splash the dressing into the spinning bowl. The serving sizes were generous!

Afterwards, we were served the Sauteed Vongole which was amazing! The flavours were just right and the flavor provided by the white wine all blended perfectly. The truffle fries were equally wonderful as well as the fresh raw oysters! Would recommend these 3 starters!

For the mains, we had the English Cut and Lawry‚Äôs Cut which were both tender and nicely done! Serving sizes were very generous and they even explained what the accompanying condiments do to the flavour of the steaks. Afterwards, we were given our small birthday cakes and they were light and delightful!

Overall, I would recommend Lawry‚Äôs to anyone who‚Äôd want to experience such nice and warm service to go along with awesome food! Our heartfelt thank you to the following staff who made our dining experience one of a kind:

Aquila, Jazz, Shiva, Janice, Musa, Lee, Rathika, and Zul! You are all the best!"
Dinning,Food was great & flavourful. Staff were really friendly and serve us very well. I had an amazing time‚ò∫Ô∏è
Lunch,"Excellent food and even better service from the wonderful crew Ratika, Joshi, Reing and Janice Thanks guys for making lunch so special"
Good but the Prices are getting Crazy!!,"It's been several years since we last visted and in the interim the prices have gone sky high. The Prime rib standard cut is now USD 100 so a dinner for two with and average bottle of Australian wine set us back USD 400. While the steak was as always great, that's no longer any kind of sensible value other than for expense accounts and special occasions. If that's the intended market, great, go for it.

Sadly, since The Stuart Andersen place at the end of Orchard Road closed down due to Covid, there aren't many alternatives in Singapore. We may return very occasionally but will now save most of our Prime Rib experiences to back in the US."
Pricey meat,Good formal-ish service. We found the food overpriced for the portion. Tasty tender prime rib but not worth the price.
Birthday dinner here at Lawry's!,Service is fantastic & my boyfriend enjoyed the steak so much i think this is his happiest moment in the 2+ year relationship. Highly recommend!
Great Atmosphere,I had a big group come in and we all split bills. They listed down the order per seat basis so it was easier to split the bill.
Loved it!,Food was tasty and impeccable as always and the service rendered was amazing. Made my bday a special one.
It is a memorable one!,Well served by the kind and experienced waitress throughout the meal. We will surprise to receive birthday cakes after chatting with her. Thank you!
only alright,"been to lawry's in states and Taiwan think the service/food/atmosphere in sg is only acceptable, nothing spectacular"
Best & closer alternative to L.A.,"I love the L.A. branch and was happy to see a closer one to me, being based in the Phils. Still the same quality food though I wish the salad and sides had bigger portions too. Would still definitely go back whenever I'm in Singapore."
Great experience,We had the July set menu dinner and all the items on the menu were great. Service helmed by Mr. Shiva was excellent! To top it all the place has a great ambience.
A must go to place!,Great ambience with good food! The staff service was impeccable and will definitely visit again! Highly recommended!
Good Steak with Great Service,"We are a big fan of Lawry's. We usually visit the restaurant whenever we traveled to the city with one. Anyway, the food is always good with generous portion. The service at this branch is exceptional amd very friendly."
Friendly staff and great food,"Mr Shiva and his staff were super friendly and welcoming. The food is delicious, especially the beef cut. Would love to come back again."
Best steak in the world.,Steak is fresh and gravy is delicious. Excellent wine. Comes with mashed potato. Salad is fresh and dressing is nice.
"Always a classic,best cold spin salad and the prime rib",I‚Äôve been coming herebwith my late dad whenever we come to singapore from jakarta and now coming here with my own kids to give them the same happy memory. The cold spin salad and prime rib is always good. Love the scallop appetizer too. Service is always nice too
Excellent dinner at Lawry's,a classic tradition that continues to exceed expectations. quality of food and service remains top notch and worth a journey to this restaurant!
Food is good,"We visited Lawrys the Prime Rib in Singapore few days ago, ordered the truffle lamb rack, tenderloin and the steaks. The food so nice and the doneness is just well. Price is also reasonable for such portions. My family totally love the ambience and the food. Definitely will visit again for the food!"
"Thank you Mr. Shiva for looking after us, it felt like he harbour back, saving us with a Kris discount for example.","Thank you Mr. Shiva for looking after. Atmospheric classical steakhouse. Wood paneled, high red seats, white linen table clothes. Tbh there are better places for meat but the staff are excellent."
Jul 9 22,The steak was not hot and medium-well as we requested. They could be flexible on portion sizes of sides to avoid wastage.
Lawry‚Äôs Singapore,"Glamorous place to bring a date. Service is excellent. However we went there for food and it was disappointing. They served ice cube salad, the cheapest on the market! Prime ribs meat was below average - tasted like canned corned beef;; would taste very dried without the jus. Deceivingly overrated ! Whipped cream horse radish was not served, as per indicated on website.

Website showed Complimentary Birthday Dessert Instant Photo Print Chandon Brut/Sparkling Ros√© at $79. No such thing. If you opt for the 50% main course discount, apparently you do t get to buy the wine @ $79. No transparency on this:

So bottom line, save ur time and money cause it‚Äôs not worth it! Spent about $400 for 2 pax and regret every cent of it."
Excellent dining experience. Really touched by Opn Mgr Imran‚Äôs service & initiative.,"My wife, son & I had an excellent steak birthday dinner on 6 Jul 2022, booking 7:15pm. We ordered steaks (come with salad & Yorkshire pudding), 1 plate of oysters, 2 glasses of Shiraz. The food was excellent. The service was attentive, friendly, caring & prompt. We were impressed in particular with Opn Mgr Imran Mohd Shahid. He took the initiative to analyse the best discount scheme for us (we were eligible for more than one scheme, but can only choose one), & then advised us, without our prompting. Excellent!"
Corporate dinner,Came here with 10 pax for my company‚Äôs mid year corporate dinner and got blown away by the amazing setting in the private room! Food served are beyond expectations and everyone enjoyed the time here! Good job!
Casual birthday dinner,"Excellent service and very luxurious place to dine in! Lawry‚Äôs cut is very huge, juicy and extremely satisfying! Recommend!"
"Nice ambience, good food","Had a dinner here recently. Ambience and service were good. Most important of all, the food was great!"
Still Good Post Pandemic,"Worth every penny , great prime rib , tender juicy and full flavour . And please , this is not steak so stop comparing to wagyu or sirloin kind of bullcrap.

Nice place to dine in , good service and a nice selection of wine list. I have been dinning with them while they were still at paragon , at least 20 years ago , i stll very much enjoy them .."
Excellent Beef Steak,"The steak was excellent- medium cooked is perfect. The salad was also very good but my daughter found it a bit sour so if it could be adjusted, would be perfect. Ambience was pleasant and staff were very attentive."
Terrible,"Nightmare dinner. Hesitated to leave this review but feel this has to be shared because Lawry's was not supposed to be like this!
Supposed to be a nice dinner with great ambience. But whole place was destroyed by choice of music - heavy and loud music in the restaurant.
Food - had steak and lamb. The lamb was overcooked and the sides that was supposed to come with portobello mushrooms were replaced by shiitake mushrooms - totally off!
Totally destroyed our palate and our night out for anniversary dinner! Sad and disappointed."
Simple lunch,It‚Äôs a good place to have lunch with ur love ones. Tasty foods and they do have wide range of wine collection. Nice staffs and gd service.
Family gathering,Goooood food thumps up. Strongly recommended for family dining for peace of mind with great ambience.
Great food and service as always,Have been dining at Lawry‚Äôs at least once a year for several years now. Food and service have always been excellent.
Great Service,"Great place for anniversaries. We keep coming back because we love the prime rib. And tonight, especially great and service from Shiva."
Very busy and understaffed,"I had dinner on a Saturday and the place was packed. They were clearly understaffed and we had to remind them of our order a few times to get it sent to us. The food was ok, but definitely not of the value at which it was priced. My total bill came to S$520 which included a S$180 bottle of wine."
Very Disappointed,"We appreciate the fact that everything is just going again after Covid but we feel Lawry's has lowered their standards. Supermarket bun is just one example, very cheap and nasty. Staff seem to lack training, incorrect order delivered to the table, which they put on our bill till we complained and it was removed. Salad was not the same. The prime rib was fine, but they only allowed mashed potatoes and we have always had fries and a baked potato. The dumpling was delivered half way through the meal so not needed really.
Lawry's has always been our favorite restaurant in Singapore, we book from Australia and go there every time we come to Singapore. Sadly we feel this visit will be our last and we will have to find a new favorite restaurant."
Timeless Classic,"Good place for a business lunch or just a friends/couples visit.

This a place where you come with expectations and everything turns out well.

Service good , wagyu good , desert good.

There is a good ambience for business lunch , you are not interrupted by staff and no background din.

Professional service.

Timeless Classic."
Melting Foie Gras,"Me and my friend come for a dinner; we have roasted prime rib as main course, amazing taste, the beef is juicy. I personally is Foie Gras loverü•Çthe Foie Gras is melting in mouth !!! üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª definitely will visit again soon"
Great dining experience,"Great experience, Great food, Great service! Nothing more we can ask for. My parents were very impressed and happy with the whole dining experience. Thank you Mr Shiva and team for your kind service and attention! :)"
First visit,"Excellent service provided by Mr Shiva, Mr Musa and their team. They were very observant even when they are fully packed. Came to check on us a few times just to make sure we are okay. Will definitely be back and they have a nice ambience as well !!"
Disappointed with food quality and service level,"My family and I went to Lawry's to celebrate my 10 year old daughter's birthday on 10 Apr. This restaurant used to be one of our favorites and we last visited her in Dec during last X'mas. The whole experience was one of our worst since we started patronising here. The service was so bad from the moment we sat down. We had to wave many times to get staff's attention whenever we needed services such as to order, refill water, clearing the table, bringing out the small piece of cake with candle. Even when we asked for the bill it took forever to come and I had to walk over to the cashier to speed things up. The prime rib was also tasteless and the menu took away the Singapore cut which is our usual portion as we find the rest of the cut sizes are too much for us to consume. Total disappointment and my husband already told me to find alternative place for future family dinner instead of coming here again. I would strongly advise the Management to look into improving and bring the standard up to mark again before losing repeated customers like us. We won't be dining at this place in the near future for sure!"
Awesome dining experience,5 star service from Restaurant manager Musa and his staffüôèüèºThey were very attentive in ensuring we had an exquisite and memorable evening for my son‚Äôs birthday. Will definitely be back to Lawry‚Äôs for more celebration eventsüëçüëèüëè
Love:)),Excellent service accompanied by nice ambience. Overall great food and experience ! Love the time here!
Best Prime Rib,The Prime Rib is the best in Singapore. The price is a bit steep but its good to give yourself a treat occasionally. Its good that the restaurant employs a couple of seniors!
Great place for a classic steak meal,"I love their California cut, which comes with traditional yorkshire pudding and horseradish sauce. Good service, and a good selection of wines, too!"
Wonderful dining,Dinner outing. This is the annual family dinner to celebrate my wife's birthday. She said she wants to collect as many family photograph that the restaurant takes for the birthday event
Perfect service & food,"The steak was perfect and service was out of this world. Highly recommended, & greatly appreciate the hospitality rendered by Mr Shiva!"
Great food and service!,"Food was great, service was superb, special mention to Shiva who coordinated the dinner service for my party! We had the 3 course menu and it was wonderful."
Best birthday dinner ever,"Great food, even the sides. Service was excellent, particularly Anna, Sue, and Mary. No suprise nearly every table was celebrating their birthday there."
Wonderful birthday celebration,"This restaurant has a super wonder atmosphere. The crews are very friendly and is always happy to bring the perfect service to us.
Celebrated my wife birthday and the complimentary birthday cake was a surprise even for me. (could have order other desserts. :P).
Lastly, the food were perfect. nothing less from Lawry's!"
Welcoming Service & Delicious Food!,Highly recommended. Every single food we ordered was delicious and the service was magnificent! Will come back again!
Excellent food. Ambience is good too.,"Good good and ambience. Service is on point too. As it was my first time there, I took the plunge for their recommendations and it was so worth it."
Attentive staff and sumptuous food,"We visited recently for my husband's birthday celebration. Not only were the staff attentive and helpful, they were considerate towards the children's needs and made sure everyone enjoyed our time at the restaurant.

As usual, very impressed by the level of service and food quality. Will definitely return for more good food. Keep up the good work, Lawry's team!"
Fine dining or Restaurant,"I came in with a friend in the afternoon, place was relatively empty atmosphere was good really quiet, food was good as well. Waited for quite awhile to be attended and order again, it look as though they were spacing out. Would like the next visit have slightly better service to make this feel like a fine diner."
Standard has not improved,The food standards has dropped even with significant price increases. The breads are now just buns like those typical western food restaurants. Seems like they have not improved over the last few years and I gonna skipped them again for the next few years. Disappointed as always.
Birthday Celebration in Lawry‚Äôs,"Celebrated my birthday here. Fabulous & delicious food and Chandon! Complimentary birthday dessert also provided and also an instant birthday photo. Wonderful service by Joy, Joshi and Musa!"
Fantastic Service + Food,"Kudos to the staff for being so attentive and friendly. There was not one moment where our glasses of water were empty - they would frequently top it up as well as checking with us how was everything. As it was my colleague's birthday they also brought him a complementary slice of cake as well as a free photo that they emailed to us to commemorate the occasion.
The prime rib was very flavourful and so tender that it melts in your mouth. We were given a table facing the window so the view of the orchard streets were amazing.
As it was my colleague's first time trying Lawry's, he was so impressed with the whole experience that he says he will be back again someday with his friends.

If there was anything to criticize, the creamed spinach that we ordered as a side could use a touch bit more salt, as it tasted slightly under-seasoned."
Still one of the best Prime Ribs restaurant in Singapore,"My wife and I had enjoyable lunch at Lawry‚Äôs last October 2021. We ordered the usual their signature dishes (prime ribs) that comes with special salad as well. Ambience was very nice, foods taste delicious and services were fast and efficient.
Pricing is on the high side but is a good value for money if you‚Äôre using Love Dining promo from AMEX. I would recommend this restaurant if you‚Äôd like prime ribs dishes."
A long way to for improving the overall standard,We felt like sitting in the middle of an upmarket food court.... Long waiting time for the food to be served. No Christmas atmosphere. All overpriced and poor quality food. Meal size a joke. You will see us never again. Total ripoff!
Birthday celebration,"My first visit to Lawry‚Äôs was nothing short of fantastic. Staffs were all very friendly and welcoming, especially Shiva. I think he is the manager there. It was my belated birthday and he gave us a free glass of champagne and even gave us free gifts. Super sweet and thoughtful of him. Food was amazing. Loved every bite. I hate salads but honestly i dont know how is lawry‚Äôs salad so good, like what did you feed the beetroots??? I finished a bowl of salad for the first time in my life. Will definitely come again soon. Thank you so much for the wonderful service. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
2nd trip to Lawry‚Äôs,My family decided to have our New Year‚Äôs dinner (1/1/2022) at Lawry‚Äôs Prime Rib. This is my 2nd time having dinner at Lawry‚Äôs. The ambience was Excellent as usual. The staffs are very friendly and customer service was great.
Best dining,"Our regular restaurant for family celebrations. Nice food, good atmosphere and service. We will be back again and again. Love it!"
Good service from staff,"My husband has booked a dinner for 4 of us to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. But he has forgotten to mention it to the staff during the booking . So when we informed staff Anna on the spot as we will like to have a photo memento if possible & she obliged us immediately & served us with a complimentary cake with candle . While my husband was trying to take a wefie ourselves, Anna saw & volunteer to take it for us . Rose is also attentive to us . They still give us a limited edition gold wine opener as a memento as we have hit a min spending .
Overall food is great as well & my boys enjoyed it ! We will return again soon :)"
"Food is great, but not the service.","I arrived at the restaurant at around 615pm. I informed the lady(I do not know her name as she's not wearing her name badge.) at the entrance that I have a reservations at 7pm. But I was told that I am too early and that I have to wait. She just stopped there and I was not sure what to do since it's my first time at Lawry's. The lady did not ask for my name or any details to take note. I reconfirmed with her that I should wait at the side and she merely replied yes.

I waited at the side for 30 minutes or so and I see people approaching the counter(manned by a different staff) and they were asked for their names. Thereafter, they have their reservations lined up. So I went back to the counter and explained the situation. She then took my name and placed me in the queue. She might have realised that at that point I am rather unhappy, she quickly informed her colleagues to arrange a table for us.

When I first made this reservation, I have informed the person whom I spoke to on the phone that it's a celebration for our wedding day and I would like to have a table with a nice view. He say that he can arrange that. Upon seeing the table we are placed at, my disappointment increased. We were placed in a corner with no window but the view of the defribillator. But since it's busy and packed on Christmas day, I did not request to have our table changed.

When the complimentary cake was served, I was informed that someone will be coming to have our photo taken. Prior to that I have seen other patrons taking photos by the aisle with the Christmas tree in their photo. So I requested for that too. But the lady who took the photo for us kept asking me ""how are you going to do that?"". And she seems like she do not want to waste any time further on us and just want to get the photo taken. Just to highlight, this lady who took the photo for us was the same lady who told me to wait at the side.

I do not like this kind of treatment and service standard at all.

The only thing that made up for the unpleasant experience was the food. I must say the food was really good."
Many times return visit ‚ù§Ô∏è,"Always recommend my friends to choose LAWRYS as our occasional celebration place! This round I brought my girl friend to celebrate. The service staff is so friendly and detailed in recommending us for some new items. We order appetizer, the Foie Gras is just so amazing; it melted in the mouth, portion so generous. Will definitely order again whenever we visit. The steak just nice on our requested medium rare ‚ù§Ô∏èthe environment & ambience is so comfortable to spend our time. Totally worth my visit, good choice. Thanks LAWRYS"
