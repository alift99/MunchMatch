Bday celeb!,"We had a good time at Kai Garden as the pace of the food served was great, nice atmosphere, good service and of course really good food! Would recommend!!"
The Dim sum is to die for and Must eat the colourful dumplings,Food was yummy and value for money. Service was attentive and I enjoyed every meal I have had. This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in town.
Kai Garden remains one of my favourite restaurants,"It was mainly a dim sum lunch for the family. The dim sum dishes were all very good. We also ordered the signature crispy peking duck that maintains its usual excellent standard. The only mild disappointment was the ee-fu noodle that I ordered as an add-on from the peking duck - there was a burnt smell and taste to it. This is a first time - probably because the restaurant was very busy.

The staff were all attentive enough and service was brisk. Although I was only informed a day before that I had to vacate my table within an hour or so, I was able to be seated earlier that the reserved time and we could finish our meal comfortably enough before the time."
Check price of highly recommended Turbot before ordering,"Celebrated my sister's 60th birthday with my other two other sibmibfs.. I personally like the food at Kai Garden and broght them there. We ordered birthday buns, signature peking duck, sweet and sour pork on the rocks, century egg jelly, veg, egg vermicelli, bamboo clams, red ruby dessert. What shocked us was the highly recommended turbot fish which the staff did not state the price clearly. Price quoted was in grammage but actual fish is 1kg when served. The fish cost us $200!. My birthday sis had an allergy with rashes on her face and neck as soon as we reached the car. Kinda disappointing as I highly recommended this restaurant. Do check the actual seafood price before ordering."
"Quality Food, Quality Environment",I was with my friends & family on 19/07/22 Tuesday for Dim sum.Good embience & Quality Food with Good customers service. Tried the other branch at Takashimaya but Marina Square is so much better in overall. Will definitely return & recommend to friends & relative. Thanks
"Tasty food, quick service",9 of us had Tim sum lunch here today. We also ordered a Beijing duck. The food here is tasty and prices are reasonable. They have few different sauces for the Beijing duck. Total bill was about $500 for the 9 of us.
Poor service! Not recommended! Dine in at your risk!,"My friends and I have dined in from 11.30am to 2.30pm on 23 May 2022. The five of us were utterly shocked by our experience at Kai.

Firstly, we ordered Peking duck, and after eating the skin, I told the service crew to chop the balanced duck and remove the bone for us. It took 1.5hr for our duck to be served to us and the bone was not even removed(photo attached) Since we are rushing for next appointment, we left half the duck not eaten! We could have enjoyed the duck completely if it was served earlier! Was it so difficult to chop the duck? Or was it simply overlooked by your staffs?

Secondly, before our duck and vermicelli(last 2 dishes) were served, the service crew has cleared away all our cutlery. This shows that poor management or staff lack of knowledge at Kai.

Thirdly, I already requested for complimentary longevity buns since 13 May and I received a call back that all will be arranged at no cost. However, Mr Philip Tang(name-card as attached) has approached me very rudely and said loudly that I did not inform him properly so he actually key into the system that it was chargeable. Isn’t that his internal issue that he failed to check properly before charging me. Yes, in the end he did waive off the charges on longevity buns. He even said loudly ‘I already give you FREE!’ I felt that this gesture is very inappropriate and it is embarrassing to me!"
Great food great place,"Great place to dine your family alongside a great service team, food is fantastic! Easy to access! Great food accompanied with great view."
Good food and excellent service,Location a bit secluded. Concierge polite and efficient. Manager explained each dish patiently. Loved the ducks tongue and fish porridge
Great quality dimsum,"We enjoyed the dimsum here. Quality of food, presentation and cleanliness is great. My family especially enjoyed the pan fried siew may, the roast meat items and the polo bun."
Remarkable service,Has been a frequent regular to this place. Authentic canto cuisine. Remarkable service by this manager BoBo and assistant Justin
Good service & food taste superb,Very good customer service and friendly staff. Good recommendation of signature dishes. The food taste are Cantonese style taste and very good. Food presentation also nice. Staff name BoBo very polite and good service.
Kai Garden never disappoints,"This is the place for good Chinese food and a really good place to bring guests. Order the Signature Crispy Peking Duck - it comes with 5 different dips and 5 types of crepes: beetroot, pumpkin, charcoal, spinach and original. Yummy and pretty."
Top quality dishes,"Peking duck and stir fry beef cubes were amazing. Beef cubes so tender, melts in your mouth, can't stop at one!"
Experience at Kai!,"Food was excellent! We had peking duck, mixed veg with scallop, asparagus, combo char siew and roasted pork and carrot cake."
5 stars!,5 stars! The service was excellent and the food was superb. We especially loved the fish maw soup which turned out to be really filling too. Thank you for the wonderful experience!
Left bad taste,"Went early upon restaurant opening, and there were only a handful of tables occupied. Immediately ordered the peking duck which came very quickly. However, the skin of the peking duck fell on the floor and all the staff did was try to hide this. Ended up there were too many pieces of wrap (at least 5) without peking duck skin left to include so we had to eat the wrap plain, maybe with sauce. Not worth the price and experience.

Towards the end, restaurant got filled up and it was too loud to enjoy the food. Atmosphere is like a food court. Also when we asked for tea to be filled with hot water, the teapot was not returned until we had to ask for it back and only got it just when we asked for bill. Only managed to drink 2 cups of tea in total and it was pretty diluted, not worth the 3 dollars cover charge per pax."
Birthday Lunch,Service was brisk. Quality of food still retains the high standard. Somewhat pricy but that’s offset by quality.
"Food 4/5, Price 2/5","First time trying - food above average, long waiting for food to be served, portion a bit small for sharing, price not cheap. Overall 3/5"
Great service by staff Yuen Ling Dim Sum Lunch with friends,"Great service by staff Yuen Ling and she is very cheerful and patient. Ambience and food tasty.
Will definitely come again."
"Great food, great service and great view",Had the dimsum lunch and all i can say is the food and service was great! Went on a weekday so we managed to snag the window seat too! Not my first visit and wont be my last either! Only gripe was the drinks (chinese tea) was more expensive than my dimsum!
Great food and service,"Most of the dishes were pretty good, particularly enjoyed their Fried Yam & Pumpkin, Salted Egg Lava, XO Carrot cake and eggtarts. Bolo was alright, and sadly the XLB had a strong pork taste which I didn't really enjoy. The soup was good though!"
Like their peking duck,We had the executive set lunch for 4. Food is nice and value for money. Hope they can maintain the same standard in the future. We definitely go back again.
Set lunch for 1,"My husband dined alone during lunch on 24 Sept after reading that there's a Set Menu for 1 on Chope's online menu. Upon ordering, he was informed that there's a minimum 2 to order this set. Then why the heck was this super important information not published on the menu in Chope? Super disappointed. Made the impression really bad, even if your food is ok."
Nice food with original flavour of each ingredient,"Nice food flavoured on every dish. Good ambience, service can be better as payment took too long to complete as we need to chase for it. Sweet and sour pork unique served on ice, soup was yummy, scallop with net and whites were delicious"
Over Priced and nothing fantastic,"Double boiled soup was $88... miserable portion for the char siew and shao rou combination.. the peking duck was okay.. but nothing fantastic.. told the staff to just chop and serve the remaining meat... but had to wait almost 1hour before it was served. Ordered the Claypole rice and it was blend and tasteless. Overall.. my bill came up to $400,for only 5 dishes..not worth the price.. would have gone to Black society or imperial treasure instead. Disappointing."
Delicious Cantonese Dishes and Excellent Service,"Went there for lunch yesterday, Food was good and the staff were all very friendly! I was especially impressed by Yuan Ling who was happened to serve our table. She was cheerful, quick and extremely helpful. We enjoyed our lunch and it was a pleasant experience for us. Will definitely visit again soon."
Excellent dimsum lunch; exceptionally good dumpling soup,"Came for dimsum today. We are completely impressed - standards haven’t changed one bit.

What I felt was truly outstanding was the shark fin dumpling soup. I have never tasted such a common Dimsum offering with skin so tender and soup so rich.

Will return without hesitation."
Value for Money and Superb Food!,"They had a 1-for-1 fine dinner menu promotion going. Definitely worth the money. The chef took great deliberations to plate the food to make it stand out from the local cantonese restaurants. The best compliment I can give is, there is no need to for condiments to the carefully calculated palate that the chef has set to the food. Sit back, relax, engage your company and let the chef handle the rest."
Excellent Cantonese Cuisine,"Ambience are great, especially if during ang bao chinese festival @ marina float. You can dine and view fireworks!
The food are great with quality ingredients.
They have live seafood and seasonal specialities as well, do check with the staff."
"totally disorganised, over booked poor management of queue","there were at least 16 or 17 tables booked for the same time on 7 may 2021 730pm. everyone who came later were allowed to enter before us. we were number 6 on the list of reservations. the receptionist just kept calling other patrons n telling us to wait. so totally poor customer service. rest assured no matter how good anyone may rate your food, i will never recommend your restaurant to anyone neither will i come back. u need better queue management and reservation system. dont overbook just because u want to earn money. please learn to manage your capacity better."
Dinner @ Kai Garden,"Ordered all the recommended dishes amongst all, Peking Duck which came with the 5 unique pairing sauces. Service was prompt despite the restaurant being filled up quickly on the Friday evening we went to.

All in all, if only the quantity can be improved upon, the food quality was good & the overall experience pleasant."
Artistry presentation of food and nice view,"Booked in advance for their special 4 pax Set dinner on 24th April. Our family of 2A and 2C (13 & 7) Presentation of food was lovely, remarkable food, staff were fantastic and friendly. Luckily we booked in advance as the restaurant was almost full house!

Lovely view from where we were seated, MBS and Business District in sight.

Peking duck skin salad with Pan seared foie gras was lovely, presentation was remarkable. The first bite on foie gras literally melted my heart. Double boiled soup was heavenly, thick and rich. Even my 7 years old son loved it very much.

The fish was extremely large portion of us. As there's little bones while eating, my boys refrained from eating which I agreed. But fish was fresh, just right, not overtly cooked and smooth. Soup stock was rich and hmmm.... Collagen goodness in broth.

Pork was extremely tender and soft, nicely charred served with two types of mushroom. Love at first bite!

Noodle served with Boston lobster was unfortunately too salty. We informed the staff( I didn't get her name, but definitely remembered her professionalism and her smile behind her mask) and she suggested to replace immediately. But we politely declined as we won't be able to eat nor finished a new serving as we were full. My guess, probably the broth from Lobster was too rich (?)

Dessert aloe vera was good, with a taste of sour plum, pleasant, refreshing and just right after a full tummy!

Overall, it was a lovely dinner experience and we definitely would patronise the restaurant again!"
Unprofessional service,"We had make a reservation for 8 adults and plus 1 child. In view of covid 19 dining arrangement, On the day of reservation, we have specifically mentioned the number of pax.

The mentioned it is not an issue as long we can split 2 table of 4 pax each and even
quote me for dining.

However, on the eve of the actual day, another person called me and say they are not able to accomodate our request. The previous staff had already left the organisation and have no idea what she agree with me.

It is so unethical of them to informed us so last minute. Our plan have to be changed because of their incompentcy level to understand the customer."
A pleasant dinning experience,"My family of four had dinner at Kai Garden on 2/4/21 . We were supposed to dine at another restaurant but as it was already fully booked when we arrived , we decided on Kai Garden as a table was available when we requested. The restaurant was rather busy at that time . Ambiance is not really that sophisticated or unique but the items and prices in the menu tell you that one is at a fine dinning restaurant. We ordered some dishes and were eagerly waiting to try if they were indeed good. I
must say that the food did not disappoint. All the dishes came in good portion and were tasty and delicious and so is their sambal chilli. We didn’t order any dessert as we were quite full . However, I found out only the next day that the restaurant has charged me for two servings of dessert which I did not order. When the bill was initially presented to me there was no indication of any dessert orders but during charging the additional amount was charged . Thinking that the amount is correct, I simply signed without verifying amount on bill and charge slip. When I went back to the restaurant to enquire, one of the staff who served us immediately told us that he was aware of their mistake but could not reach us as we have already left the restaurant. Was told overpayment will be offset against our next bill. Was happy with their frank and honest service. Will try their Tim sum lunch next."
KAI GARDEN,My friends and I were blowed away by the delicious yummy food and dim sum. The pekingese duck is a must to try... I must said the food taste is original oriental that is just right for the taste bud. Me and my family will go back for more again. The standard is of equal standard to high class hotel.
If you want all right Cantonese food but absolutely horrible service... this place is well-placed for that.,"1. The restaurant touts itself as a 'fine dining' restaurant. Nope, it is a fine enough Cantonese restaurant, but definitely not fine dining. The bustle and activity of the restaurant is typical of any Cantonese restaurant, which is nice, but there is absolutely no quiet dining ambience to speak of, which leads to #2..

2. Dumbass me wanted to pop a marriage proposal to my SO during the visit, but promptly called it off when (a) the place isn't the quiet place 'fine dining' place I was expecting, and yes it was my fault to not check the place out beforehand, and (b) they placed me right smack in the middle of the restaurant when I requested for a quiet corner, which they gave to another couple, which seemed to be having a dinner out with no special significance. Why would I give so much attention to this, you ask? Oh yes, because I had plenty on time on hand with my SO while waiting for our food, leading to #3..

3. We visited on 31 Dec 2020, which we could understand is a busy day. But if the restaurant relies on the customers to tell them their appetisers were not served after 45 minutes, and then it takes 4-5 different staff (including who appears to be a silently fuming floor captain/ manager) checking the order chit on your table and frantically going to check your order, and then a further 15 minutes for the appetiser to be finally served... it simply doesn't speak well for the service there. My SO and I had plenty of time in the meanwhile, observing other tables and seeing obviously preferential service for some. Do we understand that this is normal in a Cantonese restaurant? Yes, we do. Do we feel amused? Absolutely not, if a table is served within 10 minutes of being seated and you observe them eating while feeling miserable.

4. The food, to the kitchen's credit, is pretty good. My SO and I enjoyed the food somewhat, and they are served in rather quick succession after the appetiser appeared on our table. The only thing we absolutely cannot wrap our head around is this skewer thing they serve with a piece of yellowing raw cucumber and a piece of oddly coloured raw carrot with 2 pieces of tasteless siu yok (roasted pork belly). That is disgusting.

5. For reference, we had Set A on their menu for 2. For $98 per person, I feel it is overpriced. $60 before taxes might be more reasonable.

6. Visit this place if you have time to burn, and like paying a premium for all right Cantonese food.

7. Yes, I am dumb and deserve to be miserable."
A very pleasant dinning experience with my family!,"Great services were provided by the manager and staff since we stepped into the restaurant. The food was incredibly delicious, well portioned and presented. The dishes are rich in flavour without being overpowering, striking a good balance while maintaining a high quality. Definitely worth the dining!"
Team meal,NIce ambience for a team meal. Food is good and location is accessible. Visiting around is convenient.
Good service and food,"Had an enjoyable meal with good service, Peking duck is highly recommended, other dishes were also of above average standard. I’ll definitely come back again."
BAD SERVICE NOT IN LINE OF THE GOOD SERVICE REVIEWS,"Had lunch with a friend. Service was bad. Waiter named Ken literally waved his hand rudely at us to clear dishes even we were having a conversation. After he cleared the plates he put the soiled forks and knives back in front of us on the table cloth! I had to tell him to bring plates or stands for them. He looked shocked, lol, murmured something and went off!!! We had to keep waving to whoever sees us for any service we need.
Each time food was served, the dishes were just put in front of us but never adjusted properly!
Would I go back again? NO. Given the food standard and service. Many lower priced restaurants are more worthy in terms of food quality and price."
Great lunch,We had another enjoyable family lunch. Food is always excellent. Service was top notch despite the crowd. Manager Philip is doing a great job in this restaurant.
Cantonese Cuisine,I had set lunch and the quality of food is very good. Presentation of food is also good. The cod fish is tastefully done. The glutinous rice with mushroom is very tasty. The cold coconut with pomelo dessert is refreshing. The restaurant was running full house during lunch hour and the staff tried their best to serve well.
Excelllent Food with Wonderful Service,"Excellent food, tasty, well cooked. Service was excellent. On a weekday lunch, they were full. Highly recommended."
Superb Peking Duck,"Impeccable service, excellent, creative food, nice ambience. Good for informal lunches as well as formal dinners."
Food is to die for,Definitely one of the best dim sum experiences in Singapore. Been here twice now and both times was blown away. The peking duck is superb and the various dim sum options are all incredible. This is a must go for all dim sum and Chinese food lovers. Thanks to Philip for the great service as well!
Great food,My friend said this restaurant got very good dimsum and Peking duck. So we decided to come today. It tastes very delicious. The presentation of dimsum is so attractive and colourful. Peking duck got 5 different sauce. Service was excellent and thanks Chef for your hospitality. We will visit again.
Always great to dine here,"I have been to Kai Garden on many occasions and every visit was good.
Food is good, service is not bad too."
Memorable Birthday for my Mother @ Kai,"Not the first time I brought guests to Kai Garden.... every time tasting delicious dishes recommended by Manager Philip Tang....especially the Peking Duck, the double boiled soups and the dim sum (Siew Mai a must!). Yesterday was my mother’s birthday, and Philip arranged for lovely decorations on the birthday cake we brought and got the staff to sing the birthday song together with us. My mum loved it and we really appreciate how Philip made each time we visit such a lovely experience."
Superb food and great service!,"We had a very pleasant Lunch visit with a big family of 5 on a busy Sunday. Manager Philip Tang warmly assisted us - we got a table almost immediately, food rolled out really fast and we enjoyed every item that was served. Special thumbs up to their charcoal pan fired bun, Siew mai and stir fry carrot cake. If you’re a fan of braised chicken feet, their abalone chicken feet is a must order!! Finished off with a super creamy and soothing almond paste dessert. Will come back again"
"Superb dim sum lunch, one of the best in Singapore","The food here is great. Ambience very nice. The presentation of the dim sum is outstanding. Service by restaurant manager Philip Tang is just wonderful. He is v attentive and caring esp to my old folks.

The dim sum is really value for money. Delicious. Must save space for dessert."
Great service by staff Philip Tang,"Food was delicious and looked good.
Service provided by staff Phillip Tang was excellent! Will definitely come back again!"
Delicious Peking Duck & Other Dishes,"Honestly, if you just order their starters you will be very full and satisfied already. They are so delicious and generous in portion. We particularly love the deep fried dace fish in home made black bean sauce and the deep fried brinjal coated with chicken floss. Crunchy, juicy and full of flavours. The carrot cake in XO sauce is a must try too. Love it when the dishes are served hot - not lukewarm.

The Peking duck is interesting because it comes with different vegetable infused wraps
and 5 different sauces. The duck is roasted to perfection with a glistening and crispy skin. But I can’t say that I like all the sauces. Still, it is a good dish. Balance of the duck meat was cooked into a rich delicious gravy to drizzle over crispy Shang Mee - so satisfying! We ended our meal with a vegetable soup. Simple but so full of flavours.

Will definitely be back!"
Visit to Kai Garden,"Overall I am pretty disappointed with my visit to Kai Garden this time as the service is very bad. Staffs and manager are not responsive. At a point, 3 people are at the counter when we could not get anyone to place an order. Food quality had also downgraded which no longer maintain their standard."
Good food as always,"The Roast Peking Duck was fantastic! Missed it during the CB phase 1 period.
As usual, the fried rice as was equally good..
Fortunately, the standard of food was still there!"
"Thx, Philip and team","The food is fantastic; the service even better. Thanks to Philip and team! And here's wishing you a blessed Father's Day too, Philip!!"
Good service by staff name mr Philip,"Good service provided by Mr Philip , well manners, we have happy meals at this Restuarant food are nice reasonable price. You will love it"
I LOVE Kai Garden!,"Every visit to Kai Garden had been a delightful experience for me. Be it a birthday celebration, business lunch or even a meal with friends or family, Kai Garden rises to any occasion with their wide selection of delectable Cantonese delicacies. One of my favourite dish is their Signature Crispy Peking Duck. Their duck meat is succulent, coupled with a variety of mouthwatering fanciful sauces. I love their refreshing coconut pudding dessert too. Aside from their luscious food offerings, their service level is impeccable, especially so from the manager Philip Tang, who has never failed to pamper his guests with his attentive and professional mannerism. I feel that it is really value for money considering their palatable dishes as well as their distinctly high quality of service. I would highly recommend Kai Garden to anyone who wants to try out authentic Cantonese cuisine."
Big brother of Kai Duck and very good,"Good food, though lacking in set menus. Not that flexible in changing set menus to cater for allergies, so ended up with ala carte. Though much more range of nice food compared to Kai Duck."
Agency Dinner 2020,"We had an enjoyable agency dinner for 20 guests in one of the private rooms. We especially liked the Peking duck crispy skin, shark’s fin soup with thick & rich broth, Inada noodles with Boston lobster, minced duck meat served in lettuce and steam garoupa. The service provided by Yoyo was excellent as she promptly catered to our requests in making the necessary arrangements for our dinner and award presentation. All our guests enjoyed the meal so much that 2 of them decided to make a booking for their own families in the coming week."
Best dim sum and chinese cuisine in singapore and my standards are usually high,"Whenever I have important guests or friends from overseas craving for chinese food and dim sum, I bring them to Kai Garden. This place has some of the best tasting and creative dim sums. I give an example with their xiao long bao. Most people cannot tell the difference between most of the xiao long bao from restaurant like ding tai fung, paradise, imperial, yum cha and etc. Kai Garden has the best xiao long bao, the soup base is unique on top of the typical very thin, almost tearing skin. I don't have a michellin star palate but a good enough one to notice the difference.

The beijing duck here is unique too. They serve only the duck skin with your multi subtle taste of wrappers and sauces to go with your beijing duck. This is imo the best way to appreciate beijing duck, only tasting the essence of the duck via the well fried skin absorbing the duck fats flavor.

Lastly being a somewhat regular customer (I mean I'm not even like a monthly regular), I must appreciate the dedicated and professional service from Phillip Tang as he would remember me personally and take good care of my visits. In fact, most of the time, I would ask him to recommend dishes to my guests."
Fantastic Food and Service at Kai Garden Marina Square,"I have been going to Kai for more than 2 years and the service and food there is fantastic, particularly Philip who is the captain there. It doesnt matter if you order small dishes or expensive ones, the service there is still impeccable. The food is always very fresh and nicely done, i really enjoy the ambience and the meals i had there each time. I bring many guests there from different countries and also locals and everyone only has good things to say about it. Will definitely go back again. Kudos to Philip and the rest of the servers for a fantastic experience as well!"
Excellent Restaurant and a Must Go,"Great service by Service Captain -Chooi Ping

Had a 2020 CNY dinner with close friends over at Kai Garden @ Marina Square. The food standard is excellent and the service from Chooi Ping is exceptionally good even though the restaurant is running full house. Definitely will bring my family and friends back again. Its Cantonese food with a twist and I love their take on innovation!"
Yummy food and excellent service by Philip Tang,"Hidden gem at Marina Square! Philip is attention to details and always do his best to service his customers. Good recommendation on the dishes too and always go extra mile to ensure all his customers are well taken care despite he is busy at work.
Must try the Peking duck and the almond dessert! ^^"
Professional service and knowledge of menu by Phillip Tang,"Professional service and knowledge of menu by Phillip Tang....Excellent! The environment is comfortable add with the classic music, so merge together with the dinner! Definitely will come back again!"
Just had a CNY dinner at Kai,Just had a CNY dinner at Kai Garden! Nvr fail to impress me with the food quality and service!! Special thanks to Philip for the ever good service and food recommendation
Excellent food & service received.,"This restaurant served fusion Cantonese cuisine. Food was excellent & suits my family liking. I would like to compliment the manager Philip Tang, he recommended dishes which is good & affordable. He did not hard sell & push those expensive dishes. His service was top notch, he often came to our table to check if everything was good & changes our plates regularly. I will continue to patronize & highly recommend my friends to look for Philip Tang for his top notch service."
"Great food, ambience and services","Was there on 29 Jan 2020 with a group of friends to celebrate the Chinese New Year. First of all, great service by all the staff of Kai Garden led by the manager, Philip Tang who went out of his way to make us feel “at home” to enjoy the delicious food! Beijing duck was the main highlight but all the dishes ordered were delicious and fantastic. Ambience was great and conducive for friends and family gatherings. Will definitely recommend my friends to visit!"
Food offerings are authentic,"Food offerings are authentic and great tasting! Service is truly genuine and warm! All the staff were extremely friendly and attentive, not to mention their high degree of professionalism! Of particular mention is the restaurant manager Mr Philip Tang who fully anticipated our needs and made sure that our dining experience was unforgettably wonderful! Great job!"
"Reunion dinner @ Kai Garden, Marina Square","Chinese Reunion Dinner, very packed, 2 seatings, delayed in billings and setting but totally understandable and acceptable. Staff and cashiers were doing their best to meet demand. Philip Tang - friendly and patience, fantastic service.
Will definitely recommend friends, colleagues to repeat
Dining."
Great Taste,A hidden gem like a diamond in a forest where you must visit this restaurant serve excellent tasty food and presentation. Ambience is nice and what makes me to visit again and again is the attentive servers and friendly and warm service given by the manager Philip Tang. Professional and always recommend sufficient serving. Worth visiting!
Chinese new year reunion,Went to the restaurant multiple time for various set lunch and set dinner. Very impress by the thoughtful arrangement and planning by manager phillip in recommending valued for money tasty food. Will definately return for furture gathering and dim sum.
"Great food, service and ambience","Had a really great time at this restaurant, we had food that I have never seen before, very creative chefs they have here. When we had the yusheng, the staff sang new year song for us, I never experienced VIP service like this before! Highly recommended. Kudos to manager Ms. Zhou Xiaomei for making our meal memorable"
Went to resturant for a company,"Went to resturant for a company event. Been there many times and know that Philip can take care of everything. Ask for a recommended menu for 15 pax and a budget. Philip never fail. Put together a fantastic menu. Sumptuous and of course the food was excellent. All guests were pleasantly happy that they get quality and quantity. Some make reservation for their own family events. Great food, great service and reasonable price."
Modern Cantonese Food,"Chef Fung is a well known chef in local culinary circles. He was the founding executive chef of the paradise group before leaving the group to go solo

Kai Garden is a good platform for his skills. Some of his old signature dishes can be found here - the stone pot sharksfin for example

His suckling pig and peking duck are excellent as well.

The dimsum offering for lunch is not to be missed. The hargau, char siew soh, egg tart, char siew pao are all among the best of the best of Singapore dimsum.

The double boiled soups are also as good as any you can find here or even in HK"
"dishes are nice, service average","The Beijing duck $80++, and they have a promotion package set $108++ for 4 pax. But when we order the set, manager told us this set need to pre order, ( set included Beijing duck + 2 dim sum + vegetable + dessert). We 4 pax order a whole duck + 3 dim sum + pot tea+Beijing duck meat fried noodle. Question: why the 4pax $108++ set can’t order on spot ,but you do the promotion and never wrote that need to be pre order. Dishes taste nice, overall service not worth 10%service charge."
Gastronomical experience!,"I attended company dinner at Kai Garden and the food and service did not disappoint. Modern Cantonese/Chinese cuisine with an interesting twist to every dish-The crispy yam cracker added to the Peking duck, the ultra fresh Garoupa paired with the sweetness of Lobster broth and truffle Angel hair pasta left u craving for more.
The restaurant manager Philip and his team were super attentive and kudos to them for their superb service."
Awesome food and services,"Came with my colleague for a celebration dinner. We loved our mains and sides that were amazing with lots of flavour, soothing to the taste bud and very nicely served for each mains. Call out for Philip and his crew for the great services that night. Highly recommended for company events...Cheers SE"
Outstanding Service!!,Superb food with outstanding service! Great for visitors & company function. Highly recommended! Conducive environment!
Good Cantonese restaurant at great location,"first time to try it with family. Overall good review from all members of 3 gens. Soup is specially well done. Some dish very creative yet delicious. Peking duck a bit cold tho. Served warmer, tastier. Service is attentive enough."
Authentic Cantonese cuisine!,"Came here last night for my Mum birthday celebration and also marked the 1st day of new decade 2020! The food quality is superb especially the Peking duck that served with array of sauces and variety of the skin cum special barley crackers.. something unique compare to many other restaurants in Spore that served Peking duck. I would say the crackers shouldn’t be added as it would overpowering the taste of the Peking duck skin as well as the sauce too. Sometime keep the traditional style is the best. However, the skin is homemade and I loved it as it is soft compare to many “factory” made skin to wrap the skin. I would say there are the probably 2nd best in Spore and worth a try.

The live fish cooked in 2 ways is blowing my mind! The lobster made broth with the fish meat cooked right in front of you and served you hot! Tasty and fresh.. the bone would be deep fried and chew it all! The sweet and sour pork wasn’t great but uniquely presented don the ice. The homemade tofu bean curb with mixed mushroom was good. The stone pot fish maw soup with fried stickers to dip was so so good.. the duck web is ok and average . The fried noodle with duck meat was excellent in term of taste but rather too much to finish.

The fired fish skin with salted egg is tasty .. overall ambience is good but rather cramped. They have private room if you need quite moment for eating. The service was great as they even sing the birthday song for my mum. Captain Philip tang is very helpful and also very knowledgeable about wine! He shared his wine experience and ensure great choices of our dinner dishes. One thing is the food serve is rather slow and we have to remind it to speed up. Lever all is great and I would come back for dim sum since lots of review to talk about it!"
Excellent service and food,"I had a light lunch at Kai Duck, and was impressed with the service from its friendly staff, especially Miss Ai Xin, her colleagues and serving ladies. The food was excellent, just like in Kai Garden. Keep up the good work!"
Fabulous duck but so-so service and bitter sliced fish,"Their famous Peking Duck with the 'five colours' wrap was interesting and certainly very tasty, and as a member of my family had been there before on a number of occasions, she knew what to order. However their menu did not present the options of preparing the Peking in ways easy to understand, and there was some difficulty even as a local in communicating what was available and what we wanted. Recommend updating the menu to show what sets of options there are for their signature dishes. We also ordered the fried eggplant which was well cooked but not so well cut-up (kitchen scissors do not do a good job), and sliced fish. The sliced fish was rather disappointing, as the sprinkle of herbs on top was too bitter and spoiled the taste of the dish. The air conditioning was also too cold, and the location hard to find. The junior waiter was trying his best, but the senior management could be more proactive in asking for feedback. A restaurant with a lot of potential but needing improvement."
Excellent Chinese food,"The chef was previously from Taste Paradise so expect the unique sharks fin in stone pot with a crispy pastry stick.
The braised vermicelli with fish and scallop was very good too.
Service was efficient though somewhat inattentive."
Dinner,Food was great; front desk service was poor. Overall pleasant but will not return for family dinners
food is good,"We ordered a lunch set for 4 with the peking duck although we were only 3 of us.
We ordered ala cart dim sums and they were good.
They helped us with the wrapping of the po piah skin with the cut out duck skins. The po piah skins were so colorful and so appetizing to eat. After they cut the duck skins, they used the duck meat for our noodles. Their service was personalized and would go and eat again."
Yummy Lunch at Kai Garden,"Yummy lunch trying Kai Garden at Takashimaya orchard rd instead. The Peking Duck was super nice, “carrot cake” is a must try!!! Everything was good and service was excellent too. Will go back again soon-ish :)"
"Great Food, Awesome Service","It's my second visit to Kai Garden. Once for Dinner, and the second time for Dim Sum.
Both visits did not disappoint.
Food is good, especially the Peking Duck which had really crisp skin.
Service staff were polite and attentive. will definitely revisit again."
Best Chinese restaurant in singapore,I think this is the best mid-upper Chinese restaurant in singapore for price and value. Outstanding dim sum and dinner food too.
Creative designs,"Restaurant manager Philip Tang was professional, eager to please and efficient. Their famous duck has crispiest skin ever with an array of sauces. Dim sum to try is their pumpkin w yam, fried xiu mai. Lobster soup noodle is another must try."
Business Lunch on 9th OCTOBER 2019,"Food was good.
The table we were allocated to was next to a group of noisy office workers. So conducting Business Lunch was a challenge."
Excellent Cantonese food. Must try their Peking Duck,Went to this restaurant for a birthday celebration dinner. All the food we ordered were definitely very good. The beef was tender and nice. Almost felt like eating wagyu beef. I love the “wat tan” horfun and had eaten this dish in many restaurants. This one here is about the best. My family members also felt that the tofu dish was excellent. The cod fish was also excellent – so fresh and melt in the mouth. Fried rice was perfectly done. The highlight must be the Peking Duck dish. Very well presented with many types of sauces. A “must order” in this restaurant.
People can spy on you as you eat duck thigh at Kai Duck,"Review of the new Kai Duck restaurant at Takashimaya. Understated, casual but chic atmosphere. No doors, so people standing outside can watch you devour your meal. The long menu scores high on innovation, with lots of creative dishes or classic ones with a new touch. Unfortunately- and this may be teething issue only - execution can be improved: the duck tongues are too soft, the poached rice a bit too bland, the chilled black fungus a bit too salty, the roasted duck is less good than at ImpTreas or Crystal Jade, etc. The high-on-innovation/average-on-execution comment also applies to the staff uniform: unusual but highly unlikely to win any fashion award."
Welcome to the fish market,"Had timsum lunch with my family this afternoon.

The place was swamped and service was severely under expectations.

We ordered seafood eefu noodle which was not in the menu. The service staff unapologetically said they cannot do it for me.

Undeterred I asked for seafood beancurd in a claypot which was also not in the menu and the same answers bounced back at me. At the end I settled for the mixed mushrooms noodle which was listed in the menu.

Hello. Are you there? How difficult or inconvenient is it for you to dish out the 2 common dishes which were easily available in most Chinese restaurant. I scratched my head.

The dishes were served randomly with the noodle being served as the second dishes amidst my other Long list of timsum dishes.

And mind you, they served water but only water in a bottle that cost a hefty $8 each before taxes. This is absurd.

I will resolutely bid adieu to Kai Gardens. As sure as the sun will rise, it will be my very last visit there."
Family lunch,We had a family lunch on the weekend and enjoyed the food there especially Crispy Pork Belly which was especially delicious.
Good Cantonese food,Kai Garden serves good quality Cantonese food with great service. The food is of good quality in terms of freshness and preparations.
Outstanding Dim Sum Lunch!,"We celebrated my sister's birthday on Sunday at Kai Garden. Once again, the food was excellent! Every dim sum dish was unqiue & tasty with beautiful presentation. Service was top notch! Price wise, reasonable. It's our favourite place for awesome Cantonese cuisine. We will be going there again this coming Sunday for another birthday celebration! Keep up the good work Kai Garden!"

Delicious dim sum,"The spread is different from other dim sum restaurant.

Unique and tasty which increases my appetite. Besides it’s reasonably priced.
