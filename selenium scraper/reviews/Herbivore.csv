Fave Veg Eat in SG!,"Unassuming Japanese vego place in the middle of Bencoolen area. Easy to find in Fortune Center. Herbivore is probably my fave place to eat at in Singapore. I wouldn‚Äôt say the best for I have not visited all the veg places in SG. I stayed for 6 days and I barely scratched the surface of plantbased dining. But so far, in those 6 days of eating out, Herbivore is defo on top of my list. Full on flavour, delicious eats, good service. Attentive staff even when they‚Äôre packed. Highly recommended and will definitely go back again in the near future."
Lousy place,"We were there for lunch. Servers packed 3 different couples all sitting together when the whole resturant was totally empty. With this kind of price,its not worth the money to be treated like sheep no matter how good the food is supposed to be and it was not good.The king mushrooms we had were so chewy. Will never go again."
Not worth the money,Average food. And tables crammed together. Chewy mushrooms. Bland broths. Indifferent staff bordering on rude.
Very realistic unagi roll & salmon sashimi,"Was amazed on how realistic these vegetarian versions of unagi roll & salmon sashimi are. The unagi roll was very delicious and could pass of for the real thing. The salmon sashimi texture was a bit on the gummy side tho. Would return again as a special treat, prices are slightly high for what it is. My bill came up to $30 for these 2 items. Kudos to the service staff who were friendly and prompt"
Good alternative option for Vegetarians/Vegans,"I tried booking a table for 6 at Herbivore without success as no one answered the call so I left a voice message. They promptly returned my call, apologized saying they were extremely busy during the day and confirmed my table booking. When the say busy, they literally mean it as the restaurant was full and all the staffs were busy serving the customers. Not a quiet place to dine in but we were not looking for one so its absolutely fine. Food was really good with decent portions especially the bento set meals. I am not a fan of mock meats so I am glad that they have different plant based options for people like me. Food price is expensive as they even charge you for a glass of water but it was expected as they cater to a specific group of people. Our bill came about $200+ for a group of 6 adults including drinks and we had a good time. Overall, the food, service and ambience is good and will definitely recommend this place."
Unusual,"The place itself looks nondescript, plain sturdy tables,hardly any decor to speak of but menu is fairly wide and everything seems like your regular Japanese restaurant except that it's all vegetarian. We ordered the sashimi platter at $35, four types of 'fish', looking like tuna,abalone,salmon and prawn but gluten and soya-based obviously,all on a pile of grated carrot,daikin and lettuce with a smudge of wasabi and slices of lemon. Doesnt taste like fish except for the mock abalone. We each had a bowl of hot noodles, one curry ramen and the other two with seaweed and taupok. All were tasty but not remarkably so. It is the novelty of the imitation and presentation that impressed.
Hot water (refillable)at 50 cents per person. Service was adequate but not exceptional.
However,looked like a popular lunch spot and neighboring tables were ordering the bentos and maki which looked colourful and interesting. Worth subsequent visits to try out the different sets which looked good value from $23 to $26 with rice, salad and mains like tempura.
The restaurant is on ground level, easy to find,but all toilets in the building charge a fee,20 or 50 cents, forgot exact amount."
Can‚Äôt believe it is not sashimi üò±,"we love Japanese and we do have mostly vegetarian ( plant based) lifestyle at home. So i was intrigued to find this little place. It is a combination of both worlds : Japanese and Vegetarian

My husband did not listen well, when I told him where we going. So when we sat down to order. He ordered Asparagus wrapped in bacon and burger for my son and meatballs sushi.

He was surprised when I told him it was ‚Äúmock‚Äù meals. Haha

I myself went there to try the sashimi, they looked so real! And I must say, they tasted almost like real salmon sashimi. Wow!

Place is child friendly.
Kids loved to order food and ice creams on iPad menus.
Parents would not mind a glass of wine or sake But we got so excited about food , we forgot about wine quickly.

Highly recommend . Great experience

( no alcohol and no BYO here!)"
Top Vegan spot in Kona,"Hands down hearty healthy food that makes us feel good. Made with love clearly and happy hands. Quick and legit. Looking forward to some more modifications on the dishes as it‚Äôs epic for me I like to sub potato chips for purple sweet potato rounds. Add avocado and Bacun, hit the vegan cheese and feel good after."
Delicious japanese food,Very tasty vegetarian food! Quite pricy but worth the visit. Clean and nice place with good service.
Vegan and vegetarian friendly,"Vegan and vegetarian friendly Japanese cuisine at Herbivore was one of the best experiences in Singapore. We visited for a lunch and found that the plane didn't even use eggs and onions.
The menu has sushi, noodles, soups and desserts.
Spicy Ramen and avacado maki was good.
Seating is comfortable and interior is pleasant. Services were decent.
Menu price exclude GST and service charges.
A meal for two would cost $40-50."
Singapore vegetarian places,"Singapore vegetarian places which once‚Äôs felt warm, are no more good experience.

Servers -get the mains first.
Get offended if directed to at least not get desserts first.

Serve very abrupt and mixed. Very unorganised and too many serving staff just hanging around .

One star for the food only.

Better be checking out for other Japanese vegetarian arnd. This place would have been better left out of the list!

Lousy staff"
Excellent vegetarian food,Wow! The food is amazing for a vegetarian like me. Such amazing flavours.please go and order all the sushis and sashimis and soba noodles.
Will Herbivore outlast Carnivore?,"Don‚Äôt be deceived by the unassuming - even ‚Äòbeaten up‚Äô - looks of this restaurant. It serves amazing Japanese dishes, that look like the real thing (sashimi, ramen, unagi, etc) but are vegetarian. Only the tempura needs improvement. The place is always full at mealtime, with often a queue. Contrast the fortune of this modest outlet located at Fortune Centre, with that of the Brazilian rodizio (churrascaria) chain Carnivore, which once had multiple outlets all over Singapore, but is now reduced to one."
"Great Food, Nice Atmosphere","My nickname is often Herbivore, so when I saw this restaurant by the same name I had to try it. What a great pleasure. I enjoyed some pot stickers, a bowl of soup, and a mango smoothie. All excellent."
Awessome food!,"Herbivore serves vegetarian cuisine featuring a wide variety of choices using organic ingredients. The menu is presented on a tablet with pictures of each item and a legend indicating if it‚Äôs dairy-free or gluten-free. From vegan sushi to mock meat, everything was delicious. Herbivore proves that vegetarian cuisine does not mean that you have to give up on tasty food. Visit my Instagram (IG: kelledstyle) for more pictures :)"
Tossed and Cooked to Perfection!,"An amazing range for vegetarians, tasty to perfection, a must-meal in Singapore! I ignored all the mock-meat because thats not my thing and what I got was flavourful to the hilt. Some pleasant outdoor tables and even there the service was excellent!"
A must visit,"Came here for my evening meal; took a while to decide what to have as there were plenty of vegan options. I‚Äôd planned to have the katsu curry that I‚Äôd seen mentioned in reviews but couldn‚Äôt see that so went with the chicken teriyaki and a side dish of rice. The chicken is very meat like so I found that a bit strange to start with but I did enjoy it. If I ordered this again I‚Äôd want to have some sort of ‚Äòwet‚Äô option alongside it as the sauce was just a slight drizzle so overall the meal was quite dry (due to the lack of sauce, not the chicken itself). If I had more time in Singapore I‚Äôd definitely visit here again but there are just too many other places to try out.
I would have given it 5* if there menu included clear descriptions to help with meal choices."
one of the best vegetarian places I have been to,"The food is amazing, very nice atmosphere, the staff are kind and helping, you got a large verity of colorful vegetarian food, I wish there were more places like this"
Variation on the theme of veggies,"A very good take on familar favourites on the theme of veggies,,, Something that is refreshing experience, nice ambience n good service,,, Food nicely presented. Good flavors no msg, definitely will return, Great place for get togethers,,,, close by 9.30pm ."
Recommended,"Really enjoyed our meal there. They were very accommodating letting us in even though we were very close to closing time. The food was excellent. The only minor criticism is that too many of the menu items are mock meat, which we don't particularly like; however there were certainly enough options. Everything we did have was really good. The restaurant itself was also nice."
Wonderful birthday dinner,The food here was delicious. The bento box gave a good variety of a vegetarian take on Japanese food. Really loved the mushroom sushi. Highly recommend
Great vegetarian Japanese restaurant,"My wife and are vegetarians and we love this place and are regular visitors. Our favourites are the avocado salad and katsu curry.

The service is great and good value for money.

Taken a lot of friends and visitors from abroad and they all loved the food."
Japanese vegetarian,"A birthday lunch (not mine) with a group of ladies who always have my back, no matter what.
Herbivore Japanese Vegetarian restaurant, our favourite since years, and the quality of food has been maintained all through. Would also like to make a special mention of the ever smiling and courteous staff. I love it when they recognise my daughter and her special dishes.
In the pictures, cheesy shiitake (sinful but yum), fresh seaweed salad, avocado maki, curry udon, vegetarian unagi maki, yakitori and a radish salad. A lunch filled with fun, amazing food and lots of laughter
Lots of gluten free and vegan options"
Mock meat !,"I ordered plant-based sushi sashimi bento. The bento presentation was look like the real sushi/sashimi but all of them were mock sushi/sashimi. When I taste it, oh It's like I ate some plastic !!! Tempura was very oily. Very expensive for this taste. You can find food cheaper and delicious than this in this bldg (Fortune center). ‡πÑ‡∏°‡πà‡∏≠‡∏£‡πà‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏Å‡πÜ ‡πÅ‡∏û‡∏á‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏Å ‡πÑ‡∏°‡πà‡πÅ‡∏ô‡∏∞‡∏ô‡∏≥‡∏Ñ‡πà‡∏∞ ‡∏°‡∏µ‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏°‡∏±‡∏á‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏¥‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏´‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏Å‡πÜ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏Ñ‡∏≤‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≠‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏¢‡∏≤‡πÉ‡∏ô‡∏ï‡∏∂‡∏Å‡∏ô‡∏µ‡πâ"
Amazing Food,The food here taste amazingly good especially their fried sushi!! Definitely a must try!!!! The ambiance was also really good. I had an enjoyable dinner there.
Obsessed!!,This is my favourite vegan/vegetarian restaurant in Singapore! Lovely staff and the food is insanely good!
Amazing place!,This is one of my favorite restaurant in Singapore! The food is truly delicious and the vegan options are a gem. I always bring new friends to let them try and it's always a success. Service is fast and reliable.
Great lunch place,"Definitely amazed at how ‚Äúmeat like‚Äù all these dishes are. We tried an array of dishes. All was good apart from the cheese sushi - not my cup of tea and the cheese was tasteless.
Everything else was delicious and really well put together!
Service is a bit ‚Äúmeh‚Äù - typical Singapore service."
Dinner,Excellent vegetarian Japanese restaurant with well prepared and flavourful dishes. Even the drink options like their hot teas are great. A must come for non vegetarians too.
Vegetarian Japanese ... for a bit of a change,"This restaurant was a bit of a novelty to us - a Japanese vegetarian restaurant, located within a small enclave of other vegetarian (mainly Chinese) eateries. Herbivore seemed easily the most upmarket of the group, nicely decorated with low light levels - the others all brightly lit. So we gave it a go. We both had bento boxes, which looked great - meal presentation is another strength of the place. My meal included gyoza which I really liked, even if it was based on 'fake meat'. However, my partner was much less happy her meal, partially because she found some of the dishes bland and also because she has a fundamental aversion to the idea of fake meat. I thought it an interesting experience but doubt if I would return. It also proved quite an expensive meal after the addition of the service charge of 10% and the local GST of 7%."
Vegetarian Japanese Restaurant,"Hide in a corner of the Fortune Centre. Though it is small place, the business is robust. Delicious, nice presentation of the food."
"Delicious loved everything, best meal I had in Singapore","Was so delicious, everything about this restaurant is fabulous. Wonderful service, great atmosphere."
6/5,"This restaurant is a japanise heaven for vegetarians/vegans. Best sushi I have ever had, and the while family agrees."
Yum,"Found this great veggie restaurant.
The Bento box was great value at $25, and good eating. Some took convincing that it was veggie. Order via smart pads so you know what you're getting, the options were generous. 5 weeks in Asia and this is up there with the best food we have had. Thanks"
Little gem,Totally blown away by the flavours and the variety on their menu. Everything we ordered was top notch! It was so good! Was a skeptic initially but was totally converted after the scrumptious food..yum yum. Will be back again to try out more on the menu.
Even carnivores would love Herbivore,"The food looks amazing, and tastes as delicious as a good version of the real thing, from sashimi to unagi to ramen. Only the tempura is less than succulent. They should try to make mock uni. Excellent service."
Japanese restaurant - 100% vegetarian,It is difficult to take friends/relatives who are vegetarians to a normal Japanese restaurant .This is the perfect place as it is 100% vegetarian and also they don't use any alcohol. Very wide choice. Ordering via iPad. Bento portions are big. A bit expensive. Best would be to order dishes to share.
Delicious,"This is the perfect place to bring a non vegan to enjoy a meal together!

The iPad to order food yourself is useful and very clearly labelled with dairy and non dairy dishes.

There‚Äôs is a really good selection of western, sushi, noodles, soup etc.

The food and service is great. I‚Äôd definitely recommend this restaurant"
Great vegetarian for a non vegetarian!,This place has delicious options to enjoy with your vegetarian friends!!! Every time I try something different it‚Äôs incredible yummy! Prices are midrange but it totally worth it!
Vegetarian Japanese Restaurant,This is a gem! It is so hard to get good vegetarian places and usually they are Indian or Chinese Buddhists. But this is gold!! Love the variety and the portions are big. The taste is not compromised. It‚Äôs as authentic as the real thing. The Miso soup is so yummy. Will leave you wanting more.
The best vegetarian restaurant in the world!,"This is simply the best vegetarian restaurant I‚Äôve ever been to. EVER. Japanese vegetarian food isn‚Äôt that easy to find, considering all the fish and seafood products that are used (even when there is no red meat envolved). In Herbivore, they managed to use meat substitutes SOOOO WELL that it felt like eating real meat! The ‚Äúchicken‚Äù robata was perfectly seasoned and roasted, the taste and texture was indeed chicken. Everything else we had (starters, ramen, bento box) was cooked perfectly and had a great presentation. I don‚Äôt usually go more than once to a restaurant while traveling, but we just had to go back 2 or 3 times to indulge ourselves with this amazing food! Congrats Herbivore!!!!!"
Best vegan Japanese restaurant,"This is one of the best veggie places I've ever been to. Dishes look perfect and are full of flavor. The first time we visited we had a bento box. Lots of food! Like go there when you are really hungry! The katsu was really good although the 'sashimi' looked spot on, the taste was kind of blend. We were happy to have tried it tho, looked really interesting. All the other sushis looked and tasted great! Last time I had the katsu curry, which was tasteful but not as good as the bento.
Staff is kind but service could be better. Two of our members in our party were running late but we all had to wait outside as we were not given a table. They do not take reservations. The restaurant was filling up fast with other visitors. After asking a couple of times one of the staff members got annoyed and gave us the table any way. She moved 2 seats aside and mentioned they have 10 min to come otherwise the table will be gone... Also when sitting outside you will not see the waiters as often as inside. After serving our food we were basically left alone. We could have just walked off and no one would have noticed. Can highly recommend this place for the food."
best vegan sushi in sg,"good atmosphere, a nice retreat . very generous portions for the maki and the unagi was simply unbelivably good. staff were lovely and super helpful. If you‚Äôre vegan and like japanese cuisine, this place is for you!"
Vegetarian Japansese,"Pleasantly surprised by this place. They have so many different items even in Japanese Vegetarian Restaurant. The Ambience was very good and the staffs were very polite, helpful and courteous. They have an ipad in each table through which you can browse the menu and then place the order. The serving portions are excellent. Loved the desserts."
Veg Sushi,"As we were staying close by we visited this restaurant one day. We ordered the Veg Sushi with Avacado. It was really tough to make the staff understand that we didnt prefer any mock meats and wanted the one which was 'pure' veg.

The Sushi was really delicious especially the mayo dressing on the top."
For vegan who loves vegetarian food!,"I was very surprised about the food presentation despite the fact that it's vegetarian, it looks exactly how the usual japanese restaurant presents their food. They even serve mock salmon sashimi, although it tastes a little different from the usual. Worth visiting if you are keen to try out vegan japanese food! But it doesn't come cheap so be prepared to pay for it!"
Herbivore scores more than Carnivore in ecological war,"The food looks amazing and tastes like the real thing, from ramen and udon to katsu curry, unagi sushi, and especially salmon sashimi. It‚Äôd be a feat if they could make mock uni. Fun has its price, but you‚Äôre not going to come here every week, are you?"
Vegan gem! üå±,Great restaurant for vegan who would like to try Japanese style food! Yummy food and relaxed atmosphere. Staff was very friendly and helped with food choice! Recommended!
Fantastic - 3rd visit and as good as ever,This was my 3rd visit to the amazing restaurant. Had the cold cha soba noddles and avocado maki which were delicious. My companion had grill plant-based chicken gyzo bento box which he also enjoyed. A bit pricey but well worth it. The staff are attentive and the atmosphere relaxing.
Amazing!,"We found out about this place when researching vegetarian places to eat whilst on a 5 day trip. It was simply amazing. The food looked & tasted great. The staff were really friendly and really accommodating with families - when my daughter spilled her drink were really cool about it!!!
We liked it so much that we went back especially into the city when we had few hours for a flight stopover on our way back to uk! This time we with some of our family who live in Singapore. They eat meat but were wowed by how tasty and realistic the food was. Absolutely must visit!"
Interesting food option,Japanese vegetarian with many varieties to choose from. Love their pot soup which is serve in small cup. The sushi is good as well. Bento with fish curry is good option if you come with many people since I find it too much to eat all by myself. Overall is worth a try and many interesting menu to choose from. Ambience is good and the restaurant is clean.
Vegan options,Really enjoyed the options here. Great to have some vegan mock meat. Staff were nice. Zen atmosphere. Overall a good experience.
Back for more Japanese Vegetarian,"Returned here for a Japanese vegetarian lunch experience again recently with a friend. Relative to other places in the Fortune Centre, pricing is higher here - around $25++ for a typical bento box. But the preparation is impressive and the quality is good, service is also friendly and efficient."
Yummy vegetarian food,Ambience was cosy. Location is excellent. Food was tasty and delicious. Salad was fresh. Staff are attentive Happy to have found such restaurant in the city
Amazing,Group of 5 of us came and loved it here. The selection is incredible and you get so much food! All the dishes were presented well and tasted amazing. Will be back to try more.
Absolutely amazing vegan and vegetarian food that anyone will love!,"As a sushi lover I would eat here every day!

Herbivore has done a fantastic job making meatless sushi Delicious! It tastes better than the real deal and is certainly better for you and the environment!

If you're vegan, the menu specifies which items are made without any dairy. Veg dishes have some milk and eggs so just ask if you're not sure.

Everything we had was out of this world. My only complain is that I'm leaving Singapore right now and didn't get another fix in!

Try the vegan fish, it's genius!

Thanks for creating this restaurant, it's places like this that will change the world of food!"
great!,"My family & I had a great dinner at Herbivore. We tried their salads, unagi sushi & gyoza, they were all fantastic, and staffs were courteous.. however it was quite expensive to dine here.."
Modern japanese style vegetarian food,"We went for dinner before catching Infinity War. I ordered one benton set and the rest ordered soba set and udon set. The food was good, and all of us enjoyed it. Not typical vegetarian food, but more towards Japanese food. The sushi roll we ordered was delicious."
Perfect place for Vegetarians,"Hi, I am Indian and vegetarian and I also do not eat Onions and Garlic. It is difficult for me to have Japanese food with this many limitations. Their food was amazing and so is set up. It‚Äôs a place to visit. Next time in June coming back to Singapore and will definitely come back here."
Excellent Japanese vegetarian food,"A very good experience at Herbivore. we really appreciate the menu and the variety of choices. Even a non 100 % vegetarian like me will appreciate the food.
We had a great lunch for 3 and the bill was around 85SGD. My only disappointment is you have to pay the water from the tap. I found this a very poor practice for such good restaurant. I will be thinking twice before going back!"
BEST Japanese-vegetarian Food,"One of the best vegetarian food and decorated the food delicately and I highly recommend vegan gyoza, cheese shiitake and Enoki mushroom with Bacon roll! This vegetarian restaurant has become one of my weekly food place for lunch and dinner. The presentation of the food, the quality of the food was very good and look like those Japanese food styles, hence the price of the food may be slightly higher than other vegetarian food. But I find it worth the money!

Except that the staffs are not nice and do not smile to the customer."
Spectacular,Food was amazing. Could not believe there was no meat or fish served.All the prawns and meat balls which tasted fabulous were vegetarian.Presentation was perfect.It was a little expensive but well worth it.Will always return when I stop over on my way back to Europe
"Reasonably priced, especially for sushi!","We came here and shared the vegan gyoza and the vegan shiitake sushi roll both were delicious and I thought the pricing was so cheap, especially for Singapore! Highly recommend coming here."
Vegetarian Food,"This is a Japanese restaurant with no meat on the menu.
Even the sushi , unagi, meat on ramen are all fake !
But presentation is appetising.
Service and ambiance is ok, lighting a little on the dark.side .
We preferred the real vegetables such as green salads and vegetable tempura and the mushroom dishes on the menu to the artificial flour imitations of fish and pork.
This place is ok for first experience but I am not sure if I will go back ."
Amazing vegetarian sushi,This is one of my favourite vegetarian places to eat in singapore. Love all of their dishes but i must add they are expensive. For the taste and quality...well worth it.
Must Try for All Vegeterians,Excellent vegetarian food. Tried few things and all were amazing. No need to think twice :) Reasonably priced.
Perfect Evening,Absolutely incredible plant based restaurant tucked into the Fortune Centre right next to one of the entrances. Vast variety of dishes that look and taste as delicious as the pictures. Ordering is done on an iPad and the speed of service is mind blowing. Very reasonably priced and very close to other attractions. All round perfect evening.
The best vegan sushi I‚Äôve ever had,"Cute little place in fortune center and by far my favorite place there, if not my favorite place in the entire city.
You order by iPad which allows you plenty time to look at pictures for every menu item. Specify vegan in the notes sections.

We ordered the unagi sushi roll, katsu curry and dumplings. All were delicious. I wish I had more than 1 day in Singapore because I would have went there multiple times to try more things on the menu. Excellent!"
Tasty vegetarian food,Japanese vegetarian food that is presented as nicely as any other Japanese cuisine. Matched with greens and other vegetables. Not at all dull. Worth a visit.
Tasty and inventive food,"My friends arrived earlier last Friday and even though the staff initially said the busy restaurant did not accept reservations on weekends, they relented after my friends showed the staff a Messenger correspondence between me and a staff in Nov, stating that they got my reservation. The Jap food menu was quite extensive, although the burger choices were limited. We ordered 3 different maki and all were great! I also ordered the katsu curry with rice and I liked that it was spicier than the usual Japanese curry. The sashimi was the most interesting: it had the texture of koniyaku jelly or chewy agar but the colour of boiled carrot and tasted like fresh salmon! It was really amazing. I especially liked the maki and tempura. The 3 different maki has unique sauces and flavours, and came with a variety of textures in a bite. The tempura was crunchy and fresh. The only thing could be improved was the service. After I called for the bill twice, the staff acknowledged my request but did not act on it. One of my friends had to leave early so we became anxious, wondering why our bill took so long to come when we noticed that many staff were just standing around (one of them was already informing other customers that the kitchen was closing so last orders were being taken). Turns out, nobody processed our bill at all. Another minor issue was that our tiny drinking water cups were not refilled throughout our dinner and only refilled after the staff processed our bill. Nonetheless I still liked the dining experience in spite of the minor billing service issue. But will I return?"
Bento Veg,Ive walked past this restaurant many times but never really thought much about what it was u til last night. I realised it was vegetarian and have always liked vegetarian food so decided to try it. I‚Äôm so glad I did. I really enjoyed the teriyaki chicken bento box meal. All vegetarian and tasted amazing. Was actually a very big and filling meal for bento size. I‚Äôll be visiting this place again when I visit Singapore
"So, so happy I found such good veggie food!","I have just finished my meal and the ladies who served me were lovely, and really helpful. They explained the most popular dishes and I opted for the pan fried gyoza first and then unagi maki. Both were extremely tasty and fresh! I would have taken a picture of the gyoza (which are an in house recipe), but they were demolished in seconds.
Well worth a visit!"
My favourite vegetarian restaurant in SG,Cant begin to express my love for this place. Try it all and come again and try more. My fave is the vegetarian unagi
Revolutionary Vegetarian Food,This is my second visit to Herbivore and the food variety and quality is simply outstanding. They have such huge variety to choose from and every dish is unique in its own way. I will have to make a few trips to taste all the dishes they serve. For someone who is a vegetarian I feel such restaurants make us feel inclusive as there was no other way I could have tasted some yummy Japanese food. Highly recommend all vegetarians to go down and taste the food.
Awesome thanks,I eat here twice...i must say the best asian food ever loved it would highly recommend The stuff is also very kind
Mock meat heaven or hell,"I'm really not sure about Herbivore. I just popped in as have been wanting to try. As a vegetarian I love eating vegetables, I celebrate eating a healthy plant based diet . Herbivore is vegetarian and some dishes vegan but most comprise of mock meat which I'm not sure about. Even the sushi is mock fish made from sushi. I had a the Soba Set that comprised of mushrooms in a gravy like soup, with super soft noodles, a tasteless mock omelette and mushrooms plus a little salad covered in a mock what seemed like a Marie Rose mayo plus 2 pieces of fried food that seemed like a tomatoes and mock meat filling. I didn't want to try. If you like mock meat you are in heaven but for me no thank you."
Good place for trying out Japanese food for veggies!,Our second Japanese vegetarian restaurant visit in Singapore. The menu was an iPad which was locked every time we wanted to order (making us wonder why automate the process of ordering when the waiter needs to unlock the system when we want to order.) The items were good and the waitress explained each of the item on the menu. The food was good and the tea varieties they have here are excellent. Definitely recommend if you are vegan/vegetarian and would like to try Japanese food.
Yum!,"This place is awesome! It's so nice to have the freedom to choose anything on the menu! The food was delicious and I really enjoyed all the different way they cooked and formed their protein alternative, really awesome concept. The restaurant is quite packed and it's quite little, staff was really efficient but not so friendly but the food did it for me! Would def go back on my next visit!"
Good vegan options,Enjoyed some nice vegan sushi - and the restaurant has a menu card that is vegan / vegetarian friendly.
Hated everything.,After reading the reviews on tripadvisor we went here for lunch. Now quite frankly I don't understand the concept of mock meat because we are vegetarian for a reason. Maybe this place is meant for people who've turned vegetarian or miss meat. My wife & I ordered 2-3 dishes and had to leave after taking a bite of each. Not only does the mock meat look like meat it smells like meat as well (sea food kind of a smell) making the entire experience unbearable for us. We paid our bill and left for another restaurant.
Good Japanese vegetarian food,"As a vegetarian, this is a place I frequented.

It is located in Fortune Center, widely regarded as the vegetarian hub of Singapore, at the corner of Waterloo Street, next to the famous Kwan Yi Temple.

Food here is good and reasonably priced with huge serving size.

I like the bento set, Japanese curry chicken/fish rice, avocado sushi, and the jelly. My son like to order with their iPads.

Two things you have to take notes, first, serving size is quite big, please come with more people or order less. Secondly, the restaurant is quite small and popular. Better come here early or you might need to wait for a long time."
Weird seating,"It was my man's birthday dinner, so we went. Firstly they seated us next to the door (ugh) so we requested for a change. Done. We sat at the middle table that has four seating. We ordered unagi bento set and soba set with salmon sashimi plate. Unagi set was two Beancurd with sauce. I was expecting mock meat and was disappointed. My soba was a comforting bowl of noodles. Unfortunately, the waitress asked if I should move to opposite my man ( as we were seated side by side to each other) to make space for other customers. However, even after finishing my food, there were no other customers seated beside my man.( so why the move). Food was on the pricey side, but at least my man likes it. (Virgin Japanese vegetarian experience )"
Best Veg Restaurant in Singapore! :),I've been ordering from here for a couple years and its hands down the best vegetarian restaurant in Singapore! Spicy ramen set is a favourite! :)
One of the best vegetarian restaurant,"Hi,
I visited Zen Herbivore restaurant once. I ordered Unagi don and a sushi... Food was super delicious... This is a vegetarian restaurant... Though on menu you will find chicken , fish and meat but that's all fake meat... Staff was very courteous.
I would strongly recommend this to anyone looking to Japanese cuisine.
Regards,
Prakash Matuwani"
Another good experience,"This restaurant is 100% vegetarian and the vegetarians will surely relish this place and love the food. Just visited this restaurant the third time and this time tried something different apart from their curry and rice set. It is the spicy ramen set with noodles,gyoza(dumplings) with pickles served separately. The noodles come in a soup form. It may look similar to the local dish laksa but is completely different in taste. These set meals are apt for 1 person. Really enjoyed the food once again. It's Japanese vegetarian food which you may not find anywhere in Singapore. Recommended"
Japanese Vegetarian/Vegan restaurant,An extensive vegetarian/vegan menu with wonderful Japanese dishes. There are also a selection of western dishes for the not-so-adventurous. The computer menu makes it easy to 'see' exactly what you are ordering. Flavours were very good with friendly service. We revisited Herbivore as we enjoyed the first meal so much. Hint: try the gyoza
Herbivore - I'll be going back for more!,My wife and I have been to Herbivore a couple of time and love the food. The menu is really extensive and food delicious. They do a great job with the mock meat. Our favorite dish is the meatball sushi. It's a really odd sounding dish but tastes awesome! The bento box options are really good as well as are the noodle dishes.
Excellent food and service,"We both had bento boxes and they were outstandingly good. No cheap but not expensive either, for Singapore. A very popular place with locals. Highly recommended if you are staying nearby."
Best vegetarian restaurant!,One of the best vegetarian restaurants that I have eaten in Singapore! It serves huge portion with specially prepared ingredients. My favourite is the cheese mushroom! :) Highly recommended to all who want to try vegetarian food!
Vegetarian Japanese,Came back here for lunch today for the first time in quite a while. Opted for a bento consisting of miso ramen and gyoza. All quite tasty. Surprisingly empty at lunchtime.
Excellent food!!!!,"True blue vegetarian delight!It is a must try place( even for those who do not have a palette for mock meat).We enjoyed our Unagi Stir Fry Bento set lunch.Each portion was appealing & appetising.Loved the ""Kurogoma""(black sesame) ice cream.Very friendly staff and the service is very good."
Nice dinner,"It has good variety of choices, reasonable price range with good ambience. It's a good place to meet up with friends or families gathering as well."
You can't go wrong here,"We've been here several times and have been delighted with each visit. Friendly, professional service, super salads and drinks, and great main courses. These folks know what they're doing and they appear to genuinely enjoy their work. A 'must visit' in our book, regardless of whether or not you're vegan or vegetarian. A great choice for locovores and carnivores too!"
Nice vegetarian japanese food at a very high price,"A fully vegetarian restaurant dedicated to selling japanese food is very rare in Singapore, even though Singapore has quite a vibrant vegetarian community. While japanese food fills up majority of the menu items, you can also find some western food choices. Food quality is high, but the prices is even higher. Fortune Centre is a place with many vegetarian food choices, so unless on special occasion which i need to impress my date, i will definitely give this place a skip."
Nice food but alternative for dairy,"Came here the second time. We ate spicy noodle and avocado sushi and they taste great. We told the staff that we are vegan, the staff was nice to suggest vegan options or changes to the food to make it vegan. We realised that there were much lesser options and were disappointed. We were most disappointed that there was no replacement of dairy milk with plant-based milk such as coconut milk when we wanted to order cappuccino to try."
Excellent place for Jap style vegetarian food,"We have frequently visit Herbivore. Their food are excellent. The restaurant also made the efforts to refresh the menu. It meant you could definitely find something new to try on every visit.

During our last visit, a tourist ordered a lot of food and shared with us that she wanted to try more on her last day in Singapore."
Good if you want to try different style of Vegetarian food,"This place is very popular during evening, especially weekend. So come early if you dont want to wait for an hour because they dont accept reservation. I like the avocado sushi, the bento set, Shitake mushroom, & the Japanese curry rice. My son loves here because he get to use tablet for ordering. Price is reasonable considering the serving size is huge, you could order 2 main and shared for three pax."
Nice place for vegan,"Its a nice place for fancy meal , they accommodated me alone even though it was crowded . I ordered for a sushi platter , thought slightly expensive I was happy with the experience. I will go there again"
"High quality, not our taste of sushi.","This place is the new restaurant of the old recommended Zen which we found on happy cow app. Unfortunately we found that out after going there once and not founding the place. They get bad remark from us for wasting our time and not being clear online about their status and new location. About the food : their substitutes for fish are made from a mix of highly processed materials like tofu, beans fremmented soy and other. We didn't like it and felt a little bed after we ate this. For a vegetarian or vegan there were no options for strictly veggies rolls and that's a shame. We also tried the avocado salad which was great but quite expensive - 15$. To conclude : It was a nice experience, nice vibe, not nearly as good as strictly veggies rolls you find in other vegan sushi restaurants."
"Good food, but iverpriced","I came across Herbivore online and was excited to eat there. It was wonderful that they had so many vegetarian options, but the prices were high! My friend and I decided to split an item and eat elsewhere. It would be a nice place to go to celebrate something special though. The atmosphere is nice and quiet and they have iPads that you order everything on, which was kind of cool. The food was delicious, but the price was a bit of a surprise for me. It was just more than I had expected. In the same mall, there are plenty of other places that you can eat for much cheaper."
