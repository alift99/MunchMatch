Good good and good ambience,Such a lovely ambience and the schnitzel was delicious and authentic. I would definitely recommend this place
One of the best places to get beer on-tap in this side of the world.,"Visiting this place was my ""personal"" highlight during a family staycation here in Singapore. I even visited the place on 2 consecutive days.

The place wasn't crowded since I went there on a weekday afternoon. The waiter/staff were very knowledgeable about their beverages.

Looking forward to my next visit."
Advantages of the Restaurant,It is a great place. Staff are attentive and friendly. The food is delicious and fresh. The price is reasonable.
Flammkuchen,"The worst Flammkuchen I ever got served in a restaurant. Dough was still white and sweet. Sour cream hat a yellow color and the few slices of old ham had a bad smell.
Food quality dropped again after a few years of solid German cooking."
Oktoberfest at Paulaner Br√§uhaus,"I visited the Paulaner Br√§uhaus Singapore with two friends in the time of the Oktoberfest. We are three friends from Germany who were not able to visit the Oktoberfest in Munich this year because of our Asia trip. In this Brew Pub you get an excellent insight how it feels like to be in an authentic Brauhaus. Liezel and David made an amazing job to feel like home.

Prost and Mahlzeit,

Niklas, Alex & Christian Uli Mr"
Oktoberfest at Paulaner in Singapore,"Great location and vibes during Oktoberfest!
Liezel and David are really funny and sympathic. I can fully recommend to visit the Paulaner Br√§uhaus in Singapore to get some German Oktoberfest vibes.
One of the best places in Singapore! It's worth a visit.

Cheers,
Alex"

Nice and Cosy restaurant. Very spacious and can accommodate friends & family looking for a good time. Good service from the staff - Very polite and friendly. Overall a fantastic experience!!"
Wonderful environment and place for Beers,The atmosphere is great and beer recommended by Bee is super yummy! Service was attentive and wonderful. I do wish the music was softer...
Beautiful Venue,"Enjoy Beerfest the simple and relaxed way. Staff very accomodating, pushing the limits of what is possible. Come here and enjoy!"
Cozy & Cool Place,"Great place, food is taste absolutely great and staffs are friendly. This is my 2nd time to visit in this year and sure will visit again."
Oktoberfest,"Five stars for the atmosphere, we were seated under the umbrella in the drizzle. It was a great place to catch up with old friends who have just returned from overseas."
Dinner for 3 on 23 August 2022,"Upon arrival, being too early, we were not being served. Could be due to the capacity crowd. After asking, was asked to go upstairs. Beer was excellent, food was great, service was great too. $70 per pax was a bit high."
WOW... JUST WOW...,I grew up in Germany yet live in the USA. This is the BEST GERMAN FOOD & BEER I've had besides being in Germany! I travel the world and this place is EXCELLENT. PROST...ü•≤üòãü•≥üëèüëç
Sunday afternoon,Enjoyed the beer and food. Crew was attentive to my orders. Had a great time here. Thank you all for this.
Appalling restaurant!,Had a very bad experience when this appalling restaurant refused to honour the terms of the Amex Love Dining programme despite being listed on Amex's website as a participating restaurant and being shown the terms thereto. Their insistence that their restaurant is acting in accordance with their own terms they did not bother to disclose to me is shocking. Will never patronise a business with such an appalling lack of regard for ethical practices.
Paulaner Brauhaus restaurant visit,"Service and food was consistently good . Except this time, I was told to sit on the ground floor rather than the 2nd level where the music was a little louder. I used to sit on the restaurant floor where it is a lot more saner and quieter , so I could have some peace and enjoy my meal. Sensing a slight dissatisfaction, the restaurant staff frequently checked back with me on the beer and food and to see if all is well. Am grateful for that. Service staff also helped me with some directions as to where to take public transport after my meal. Will be returning soon with my family for the Fruhshoppen."
Poor service,"The service was not great, waited 45 mins before the food arrived (simple starters), and the drinks that we ordered didn‚Äôt come eventually. When asked one of the servers to take order, was diverted to another server instead."
Great German beer and food,"Great place to have some good German beer and food. Place seems to be busy all the time.

The restaurant cooked up some great tasting German traditional food like the pork knuckles and of course, the German sausages.

There are two levels where patrons can sit and there is also an alfresco area at level one of you don‚Äôt mind the humidity.

Parking lots available right in front of the restaurant which is very convenient."
Great food and ambience,"Been here dozens times, always good German food and beer and nice ambience with company of friends and family."
Family Visit,Thank you Brother David for taking care of my family. His service and love was exceptional. You are solid and thank you for the hospitality.
Great German beer experience in Singapore,Great beers in cozy atmosphere. Indoors has three floors to choose from with German decor. Outdoors is great especially later when sun is not shining anymore.
Mr,"Excellent service from Felicia and fantastic beer!
Foods are good. Beer is fresh will definitely be here every week with friends"
Greg Ang,Never stop coming back. Excellent dining experience by the servicing staff especially Manju. Always there with pleasant smile and great personalise service! Great job Manju! You deserve it
Great place !,"Good location, good food and awesome beer ! Special thanks to David for the friendly service !! Definitely back for more !"
Business Lunch,"Had a good business lunch with my client and partner recently. Food was very well done and the ambience was relaxed but not too noisy for a casual Friday business lunch meet up.

Service was good but because they were probably a bit shorthanded (understandably), not as attentive or prompt as they usually are. However, when we did get their attention, they were fast and friendly."
Great experience at Pailaner,"Great service the beer kept coming.
Felicia and liezel both were very nice and made the experience great. Thanks again for the great food and beer."
Excellent gathering,"I hosted a gathering here for my University friends as 1 of them has flew to SG from HKG for work. We all enjoyed ourselves.
Food was excellent. Beers were excellent as always.
Staff was good, however I noticed a bit short handed, which is the new normal, post covid!
Will definitely come back again!"

Awesome German Place,"Great place with a true German Vibe. Great service and great bar area with some good decor. Went with a pretzel w cheese, beer and roast beef and couldn‚Äôt be happier."
Missing my Munchen bier and food fix‚Ä¶..and celebrating great granddaughter birth,"Having spent so much time in Bavaria and living is SG for the past two years, we have been craving the fantastic bier and food from Bavaria. We love Paulaner in Singapore."
Awesome trip almost like being in Munich,Liezel was a awesome host and made us feel like we are almost back in Munich. The food selection is traditional German eg Bavarian. We opened for the seasonal beer and shandy for the girls. Don't miss the desert and next time I'll be wearing my lederhosen
Best beer at Paulaner with good service,"The service is excellent, as always. Beer is the best. Service staff Erlia always serves us with a smile. Remembers our order and very attentive to our needs. Would highly recommend try their beer. Love to chill as it always brightens up my day. Must give it a try! Look for Erlia if you have a chance! She will serve u beer with a smile!"
Great night,"Great beer and great staff. If you are looking to get some good german beer, this is one of the rare places in SG. David attended our table and he was very courteous and helpful throughout the night."

Great dinner,"What a great location.
Our waitress Liezel and Bee were suuuuper friendly and served us in the best way. Beer and food is great, waitress best !!!!!
Highly recommended"
Excellent free beers and food at the weekend although the staff could be a bit more friendly and smile once in a,"Excellent free flow of beers and food at the weekend although the staff could be a bit more friendly and smile once in a while.

As part of the freeflow we ordered the platter and ate 90% of it and the guy serving us said if you leave this we'll weigh it and charge you for wastage!

Not great when you're spending all day there making them money and don't eat a small part! Customer service fail."
Best dinner ever,"Super food, super beer, super kind waiter. Our waitress Lizel made an amazing job ... Recommend to come here üëçüëçüëç"
