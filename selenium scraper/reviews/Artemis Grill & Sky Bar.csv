"Great venue, good food and good service",Held a cocktail networking event at Artemis Grill & Sky Bar. Like to thank Adrian (Group Event Manager) for making the arrangement and accommodated to our requests. Also appreciated Celestine for overseeing our needs on the ground and great cocktail drinks by Francis. Thank you team!
exceptional lunch and dinner venue,"Exceptional lunch and dinner venue with wonderful ambience and a great place to do business.

Top notch service by Wes, Daniele and the team too, can't be beaten, very client focused.

Fantastic dining experience with a fabulous range of dishes for all tastes for both lunch and dinner. Amazing quality.

Great range of reasonably priced wines to share too.

Also some of the best views in Singapore from a fine dining restaurant.

What more could you want from a dining experience? Perfect!

Highly recommended."
Spectacular view,"Of course the view is spectacular, but the food, drinks and the staff were terrific too! The combination of octopuss, creamcheese and chickpeas was amazing and I have never eaten such a good iberico pork chop."""
Pre-dinner drinks and snacks,I chose Artemis to surprise my husband with pre-dinner drinks on our anniversary. It was his first visit to Singapore and the spectacular views from Artemis did not disappoint! The cocktails were delicious and the service was excellent. We were both surprised when one of the waiters appeared with a dessert for our anniversary! Would definitely return and stay for dinner next time as the snacks we had were excellent. Thank you to the Artemis team for making our night extra special!
Unsavoury experience,"I visited with family on a rare Friday evening opportunity. Booked well in advance, and had submitted a post-booking email request for a window-side table. On arrival, they showed us to a corner table on a platform, which seemed quite isolated from the main restaurant space. They had never bothered to inform me that my request wasn’t going to be honoured. Clearly a devious strategy, because they ask for credit card details while booking, and have a cancellation fee, thus not leaving me with the option of “walking”.

Upon asking to see the GM, I was made to wait for 10 minutes. When he showed up, the stance wasn’t friendly at all. The position was that my request wasn’t received and that I was in any case given a window seat. Well, I was not, because it was a platform seat in one corner with a partial view. Be that as it may, I didn’t argue, but simply requested for my table to be swapped with one that had a proper window view. This is where the proverbial “rubber met the road” and the GM declined, stating that they were all booked 40 days in advance. Really?? Obviously I couldn’t ask for proof (and, at the end of the day, I was out for a “pleasant” family dinner), but is it believable that ALL window seats were booked 40 days in advance??? Secondly, it invalidated his stance that I was given a “window seat”; reminds me of George Orwell’s Animal Farm: all window seats are equal, but some are less equal than others.

I then requested for ANY table in the main hall, instead of on the platform. The GM declined, saying that ALL were booked. Whilst I get that the restaurant was 100% booked, but surely they could have changed the table to another regular table, albeit not a “precious” window table? Especially when the restaurant was quite empty at 6:15 pm!

Finally - to all potential visitors to this restaurant - please note this: the GM made a mocking “namaste” gesture. Why?? Because I am a South Asian? Did this person think that because I am a South Asian, this is the right gesture to use with me? In an international city like Singapore? I found this DOWNRIGHT UNSAVOURY AND OFFENSIVE!!!

I am a regular visitor to top restaurants in Singapore: Garibaldi, Pietrasanta, Morton’s, Lavo, Zafferano. I have never ever had such a bitter experience.

Finally, the end note: there are two of these platform tables at the far end of the restaurant, isolated from the main hall. We were seated at one. May be it’s a coincidence that the other one was also allotted to a South Asian family? May be not??"
A great place for multiple occasions,"Was looking for a place to host a foreign dignitary before he ends his term in Singapore. Made the decision for Artemis as it was also a place he had not yet visited during his stint.

Though he came late for the dinner as he was held up, the restaurant made sure I was comfortable while waiting (45 minutes actually) and didn’t asked if my guest was coming yet.

We were given a table by the window which had a fantastic view and my guest loved every bit of it. We really appreciated that we could get the window table as it was a nice gesture for my guest who would be leaving Singapore by end of this month, so having a great sight of Singapore would anchor such into his memories.

We ordered our food and everything was good as expected. My guest commented how fresh the Barramundi was and that the food was excellent. It was the first I tried the Burrata and the peaches created a very nice complementary flavor to the overall taste.

Artemis is a place highly recommended, great for romantic evenings, business, hosting of important guests.

Would be sure to have this as one of our regular visits."
Impressed and will return,"The gem lettuce salad and ancient grain ones were tasty. Balanced flavours and good mix of textures
The black cod was a little over cooked but lamb chop was tender and well flavoured
Enjoyed the sides
The “dulce/ crème brûlée was smooth and not too sweet.
The view was awesome, service was pleasant and so thankful the restaurant doesn’t charge for still water"
Wonderful experience,"We booked for the bar experience but decided to stay for dinner and luckily they had a table for two available, the last one.

The food menu isn’t extensive but covers off most tastes. We skipped entree and went straight to mains, choosing chicken breast which was done in a sun dried sauce with a polenta base - very tasty and delicious. The other main course was black cod with a cream sauce, the fish was cooked perfectly. We had two sides; Greek salad and mashed potato but not as you know it - the mashed potato was the best surprise, coming as a rectangular block which contained shredded potato, really awesome and different way of serving potato.

All dishes were awesome, tasty and well presented, nothing out of place.

The only reason for providing 4 stars instead of 5 was two-fold.......they asked me if I wanted another glass of wine and despite not finishing the previous glass, poured the next glass on top of the previous glass. Secondly, we had barely finished our mains and the wait staff asked if we wanted sweet. Timing is everything, always great to let people savour what they’ve just eaten before landing the next course on them.

That aside, would recommend this restaurant."
A first class restaurant to celebrate birthday!,"I went to Artemis for lunch to celebrate my birthday. It was a memorable experience, and I highly recommend. First of all, they reserved a window table for us, just as I requested for, with a great view of the MBS. Second, their service is first class. They took pictures for us. And most importantly, they offered a free birthday cake with candle and beautifully written “happy birthday” on the plate. Finally, the food is excellent. The fish I had was very tender. And my friend is vegetarian, and she is also very happy with her dishes. It is definitely a five star experience!"
The poor iberico pork marred the dinner experience,"The setting and locale of this restaurant is fantastic - the night views are quite amazing. We were seated indoors but if weather is fine, outdoors seating at the bar area is even better. The menu is pretty short - which is a good sign because that means the dishes should all be well executed. The starters we ordered - the Scallops Crudo and the Burrata were excellent. The Octopus was decent as well but I wouldn't say is extraordinary. Then comes the grilled platter which cost a cool $350. The Cote de Boeuf was great - grilled to perfection. The lamb chops were good too. But the reason why I did not gave 5* is the iberico pork chops. I know what Iberico pork look and taste like, I have personally bought lots of iberico pork and cooked them myself. Let me state categorically the 4 pieces of Iberico pork that came WAS NOT IBERICO PORK. It was drier than the Arabian desert and pretty tough. Unfortunately my guests have already consumed 2 pieces of the pork and it was brought to my attention. I complained to the head waiter who was quite defensive - told me that it was Iberico and that I should have raised this complaint earlier. To his credit, he replaced with a dish and this time, I know it was Iberico. So - my message to the restaurant - don't challenge your guests - I know my meat because I buy and cook meat very often. I know how Iberico taste like...so don't assume guests are ignorant. Otherwise, the rest of the night was good and service was good as well."
Friends-NY Celebration,"We were amazed by the Service of Dinesh. The way he help us to decide on what we need to order and not to aggresive on selling, not rush. He continuously look after us even he was busy on the other table too. Kudos also to the Manager serve our wine( wearing blue coat) and the one who serve our GT’s when he notice something he straight away change the glass. Staff are attentive even at the Bar outside helping us to take photos ( Francis and the other guy (curly hair) we ddnt manage to get their name. But overall we enjoyed our experience. Cote De Beuaf was as Star. We will definitely be back again."
Beautiful view,The view and the ambience is really great! Super love it and their service is great too. Had the soursop cocktail which is delicious. We ordered the Artemis grill set which is for 4-5pax. The iberico pork that is with the set is so dry and tough even when we ordered medium. The lamb is not bad but the beef that we ordered which is medium rare is a bit too rare.
Love the view from the top. Gorgeous,"The waiters were simply amazing and efficient. Food came on time, regardless of peak lunch hour. The scenery took my breath away."
Epic dining and drinking experience with exceptional service,"Just gets better and better!

Epic dining and drinking experience!

Top notch service by Wes, Daniele and the team.

One of the best rooftop bars in Singapore for networking.

Fantastic dining experience with a fabulous range of dishes for all tastes.

Great range of reasonably priced wines and some lovely cocktails too.

Oh and some of the best views in Singapore!

What more could you want from a dining experience? Perfect!"
"Good food, with a nice view",Polite staff when I had an issues checking in they were patient. Food was nice and the Angus Steak was spot on. Mocktail was good too! Tasted refreshing.
Superb set lunch menue,"A big thank you to Dan and his excellent team for a great lunch, very much appreciated. Do love the set lunch options and the speed of service, the view makes any wait more pleasurable...!Mav"
Awesome dining experience for couples,"This is my 2nd visit to Artemis in a year. First I came with my friends, liked it so much. This time I brought my wife there for her birthday. She was very impressed with the ambience, food and the staff. Definitely, worth going there. Both of us loved the twilight evening dinner timing from 6.00pm to 8.00pm. You go in when the sun is still up and see the surrounding getting dark as you dine. A wonderful experience not to be missed."
Drinks with a view,"Came here for drinks and some food. Service was excellent - waiter knew his gins, whiskies and cocktails and had some fantastic recommendations. Great views of the city. Ordered a veggie sharing platter, to eat, which was spot on."
Not entirely impressed,"It took around 10 minutes for someone to come to me after am seated, and guess what it was a weekday. I was disappointed by that as I had high expectations on service after reading great reviews. O well, nothing is ever the same. I am glad they confirmed the reservation by sms and as we were celebrating my best friend's birthday, the cake was complimentary :)
The Moroccan Chops were amazing, juicy and well-down, I couldn't have done it better.
Will I go again? No, but it was a good experience to try out whatever is available here in Singapore always."
Great spot for lunching,"It was our second time of visiting and it didn’t disappoint. The service was amazing, the food delicious and with the great ambiance and stunning views, it was most enjoyable!!"
Amazing Dinner with a view,"Went there to celebrate my wedding anniversary. From the start we were welcomed and pampered all the way.
Great hospitality from all the staff.
Food was excellent, flavorful e well presented.
Special mention for manager Daniele that really take good care of us and did give us advises on the menu selections.
Will definitely recommend and will be back!
Grazie!"
Artemis never disappoints,"Ever since the start of the pandemic, I’ve been longing to visit Artemis again for their drinks, the view, and most importantly, the warm and friendly service staff that makes you feel like you’re visiting a friend that you haven’t seen in a long time. Despite the many new faces, the service that made me appreciate this place had largely remain intact.

The outdoor bar is one of the best kept secrets of Singapore in my opinion. And the best part is that the cocktails served here is always consistently great. Which is why I keep coming back.

A big shout out to the team, with special mention of Celeste and Francis, for making our visit, special as always. Artemis is the sort of place where you feel happy to splurge and have many many rounds of drinks without leaving a sour taste in your mouth when you see the bill.

Check this joint out. Really."
Really good service in a very nice rooftop setting.,Artemis is perfect for dinner or drinks with a nice view. The highlight of the place is it's service as the staff is way warm to guests ( as per Singapore norms).
Great view and cocktails,Great view and cocktails. Not as expensive as compared to other restaurants of the similar nature in SG. Definitely try sky bar and not the indoor dining
Fabulous Time at Artemis,"This is my fifth visit to the restaurant and the quality of service and food is beyond good at this scenic restaurant. The bread, cheese platter and lamb chops are dishes I will never miss ordering."
Poor restaurant environment @ Artemis,My wife and I went home with serious backache from sitting on the chairs in the restaurant. They are not ergonomically suitable for a few hours of dining. These chairs should be changed if you asked me on something that can be improved on.
Sky high ambience and service,"A great choice for a romantic dinner or meeting up with a good friend. We had a lovely evening from the outset, despite the cloud burst as we arrived which put paid to cocktails on the outdoor terrace adjoining the indoor dining area. We enjoyed the friendly, professional greeting and superb service throughout and remarked on how comfortable we felt in the restaurant, a compliment to the ambience and attentive service. Our meals were absolutely delicious. Many compliments to the Chef. I will definitely be back."
Excellence,"Excellent view , excellent staff overall (everyone, from reservation call to coffee being served in terrace), excellent food. Took my wife for lunch yesterday, well worth the little splurge given the above standards."
Surpassed my expectations,"First time in this restaurant, selected this as the venue for celebrating my girlfriend’s birthday and I’m really glad that I made the right choice. It has beautiful decor with an extremely nice view especially from our window seat.

The service of the staff was excellent and there was a server (not sure of his name) that was super friendly and accommodating, the rest of the staff were also great in their service too.

The food was outstanding and actually surpassed my expectations. The beef tartare was amazing and I definitely recommend it. We also tried the Coute de Boeuf and the Iberico pork as well and it was magnificent.

Have to say that I really enjoyed my time here and would definitely return sometime in the future."
Filipino Staff Joy and Head Bartender Francis San Juan Kudos to these staff,"Staff Joy and Head Bartender Francis San Juan Kudos to these staff! They will really make u feel like a VIP guest and they accomodate all our request! We super love the Amaretto sour which Francis came up with since its not on the bar menu as we want some amaretto. On the other hand, Joy helped us to decide which food to order and we do super love all her reco like the fried artichokes, beetroot couscous and mixed grilled platter super yummy!!!!! i want to go back again for this actually! and the ambience perfect for intimate dates with overlooking view and the lemon tree on the corner of the bar was really amazin as it got its real lemon fruit on it ehehe..anyways superb nice experience we had at Artemis! Thanks again guys!"
Wonderful birthday experience,"Made a reservation for my wife’s 50th birthday and they obliged with some special requests. Food is excellent. We had the Pumpkin & Kale salad and Freekeh & Strawberry salad for starters, O’Connor Striploin medium for main, Poached Pear and Coconut Rice Pudding for dessert.
Was pleasantly surprised when they brought out a birthday cake with candle for my wife. Service was superb too. Especially to Helmi who was very attentive and impeccable in timing. Highly recommend this place if you like to celebrate special occasions"
Great food and views for business lunch,Nice food options in lunch menu set. Good atmosphere for discussions over lunch or dinner. Views are great.
Pleasant service and food menu,"Celebrated early Christmas dinner here with my partner and we had a pleasant experience at Artemis. We started our dinner with 6 fine de claire oysters and a bottle of prosecco. The restaurant also has an interesting take on the burrata and this is highly recommended. Must try on the mains are the Black Cod and Red Pepper Risotto - quite satisfying and deliciously prepared. For sides, the cauliflower couscous is a great choice.

The restaurant also offered us complimentary celebration cake on top of our dessert - do try the pistachio kataifi. Kudos to the restaurant staff, all professional and all attentive! Thank you for making our dinner at Artemis a memorable one."
Best steak - cooked perfectly,"Best steak - I love how you can choose outside or inside for more casual or more formal dinner . Staff were so friendly and excited when they over heard it was our 26yrs together, the brought a gift desert as a treat 🙏. AAAAA+++++"
"Great ambience, good food, good service","I had my birthday celebration at Artemis and it was rather pleasant. The food is really good - we had salmon and Iberico pork ribs - both are nicely cooked and well presented. The portion is rather good too for restaurant of the class.

I would have given it a 5 star rating if the service level is good - while the service crew shows good attitude on the table it’s quite difficult to get their attention. And they seem to ‘serve your food and go’ - not what I would expect from restaurant of the kind."
Disappointed in the service and customer focus,"We were celebrating our anniversary and had made a reservation . When we walked in we requested for a table by the window. We saw 2 tables available but were told straight off by the staff without even checking that its not possible. No reason given. Halfway through our meal we saw another table being made available, so we asked again. This time the new server tried to check and again said we cant do it... no reasonable explanation given , even though we again requested and explained that its our anniversary. Food was average. Drinks were ok. The lack of attention to customer requests and no real effort taken to delight customers is disappointing, especially when you are paying top dollar. May not go back."
It was our 2nd time in Artemis,"It was our 2nd time in Artemis grill to celebrate our special day. And
Artemis, never disappointed us!

Food:
Pre-dinner bread was still the best. We love it so so much to re-order few times more. It was just nicely crunchy and tasty. We prefer this bread than the flat bread comes with goat cheese
Lamb steak, super tender and beautifully cooked. And the side dishes - rice pilaf, asparagus and greek salad. Tasty & Portion was big and good for sharing.

Service:
Surprisingly Dinesh who assisted us in Dec 2019, still remember us and welcomed for the return. I felt so warmed by his kindness and great service again. He just made our day once again :)
Appreciate it.

We can’t wait to come back to try more dishes. Keep it up your services & food standards. Cheers"
"Great food & service, unusual & excellent view","The view, looking towards MBS, the bay & the ships at sea beyond is a very nice, interesting & different view for Singapore.
The restaurant is very nicely laid out, modern, functional & has a nice ambience.
The staff were professional, friendly & helpful.
The modern is reasonably small but the selection is nice & varied & the food was excellent."
Arguably the best venue for lunch in the CBD,"Visited Artemis for a casual lunch with my colleagues as we've heard good things about them, and was immediately blown away by how amazing our lunch experience was.

We all ordered from the set lunch menu, which includes many tantalizing options. The Fremantle octopus starter I had was nothing short of amazing and I couldn't believe how soft and well cooked it was. For the main course, I picked the chicken breast; the artichoke puree, savoy cabbage, and confit Garlic blended and interacted so well together. The chicken breast itself was just nicely done, as expected. As for deserts, the Turkish coffee chocolate tart stood out from the menu the most and it is one of the best chocolate tarts I've had in a while.

To top the experience off, service was attentive and quick, with requests handled in a prompt and timely manner. The waiters were also very well trained, taking time to explain the dishes in a concise, and easy to understand manner.

Lastly, the view is amazing, and it will surely impress any guests without being charged exorbitantly.

TLDR: food + view + everything else was great."
Birthday lunch,"Happiness is spending time eating with your loved ones. Came across this place through website search for a roof top restaurant to celebrate my birthday. Reservation can only be made 1 month before. We’re happy to get a table near window with an unblocked view.
We ordered a 3-course executive set lunch. The tomato and peach gazpacho is a surprise as this is our 1st time having a chilled soup. It’s souper-licious. It’s a must try! The main course - iberico pork is evenly marinated and tender but you have to add an extra S$12. The dessert - Turkish coffee chocolate torte is simply too rich for my liking. I would suggest sharing with your diner.
A nice gesture from the restaurant for serving a birthday cake.
Overall ambience is good and ideal for business & casual dining."
Celebrations,"The place looks great . But unfortunately the staff was not that warm. We were late by 10/12 mins and we were told that our table with the view has been given to someone else . Well , I guess for courtesy sake they could have given a call before releasing our table . During ourreservation they asked if there is any celebration and we told them it was a birthday . Unfortunately no one even wished us or made any effort to make us feel special !
I liked the place and ambience but I don’t think I will go back again !"
"Great Service, Great View!","Highly recommended. :)

celebrated my godmum's bday recently.
Food, Drinks, View and Service were great. And I think it is good value for the money you pay.

oh ya, they gave a free bday cake and it was out of sight till the last moment and definitely surprised my godmum. Amazing and well done! have went twice now and will definitely revisit them often."
Epic dining and drinking experience!,"Epic dining and drinking experience!

Top notch service by Wes, Daniele and the team.

One of the best rooftop bars in Singapore for networking.

Fantastic dining experience with a fabulous range of vegetarian dishes. My favourites being the red pepper risotto and crispy artichokes.

Great range of reasonably priced wines and some lovely cocktails too.

Oh and some of the best views in Singapore!

What more could you want from a dining experience? Perfect!"
"Great service, dinner and view","Headed here for dinner with the wife and was really impressed with the food, service and view. Service is one of the beat experiences I have had in Singapore which notoriously doesn’t have great customer service. My wife is pregnant and they went the extra mile to help clarify ingredients to Ensure everything was appropriate.

The food was delicious, I had an amazing steak, the wife who is extremely picking about food even before pregnancy also loved it and the view from the restaurant is incredible, highly recommended."
Nice Mediterranean Foods but not the reservation service,"My wife and I recently had lunch here with our Son before his posting abroad. The restaurant is located on the top of Capita Green office building located at Market Street, overlooking MBS and Singapore Bay, very nice view.
They serve Mediterranean dishes and we ordered executive lunch set for each of us, with Chicken Breast, Pork Loin and Lamb as the main dishes.
All those main dishes taste very nice, delicious and enjoyable. The appetizers and desserts were delicious too.
Services are nice, fast and efficient, ambience is very nice due to the view, pricing is slightly on the upper side but justifiable.
One thing that needs to be improved and make it missing one star was the reservation process and team. They didn’t give us the table near the window as clearly requested. Her excuse was they are all have been booked first by others, which hard to believe because my Son made the reservation a few weeks ago!"
Lunch Set is GOOD!,"Many resto are offering great lunch sets. And many high end resto unfortunately try to skim on the quality and quantity when they're offering cheap lunch sets. Not for Artemis! Quality and quantity of their lunch set is good. Impressed by our both starter Freekah Salad and Quinoa Falafel. Main course Salmon is cook to perfection. We'd glass of Vetliner Austria white wine each. However, I wish their wine by the glass can be priced better (cheapest wine by the glass for white is SGD 21). Service is excellent.

I did voice out my discontent upon reaching to the concierge nice Pinoy lady why did they send me an email at 11am to ask me to leave the resto by 1pm? If I knew they're planning to ask us to leave in 1.5hrs, I would have find another resto. In the end, they did not ask us to leave and we had a good time at Artemis."
Desserts and Drinks,"Part 2 of our night out to celebrate a good friend's birthday. Checked in at 845pm and got a window side table for 4, overlooking the marina bay night scene. Everything turned out well. Tried 3 desserts to to share. The restaurant put a candle on one of the desserts as i alerted them before hand when making reservations almost 2 weeks back.
Each of us ordered our own drinks. Service was good. Its a place to come with friends to catch up and talk."
A real mixed bag....,"Some good, some not so good... Room for improvement.

Great view. Enjoyed the bar pre-dinner. Nice selection of Gin. Dinner... This is where things were a bit all over the place, frankly, not to the standard expected.

We were served by three different waiters. One was great, the other two below average.

We ordered the ribeye steak and the lamb, both medium. They arrived medium, well seasoned with good flavour, but the steak in particular was very chewy. Gave my jaw a good workout. The lamb was also chewy, though not as bad. Given it looked to be cooked about right, it raises questions about the quality of the cuts being served.

One of the waiters asked mid-meal how the steak was. When I explained to him it was too chewy, he didn't seem to understand, or for that matter care. No suggestion he would provide feedback to the chef or offer to remedy things.

When we had finished, another waiter came to clear our table. He was very task orientated. Didn't ask how the food was, just wanted to clear the table and move on. Then plonked me us back on the table and asked if we wanted desert. Showed no interest in his customers whatsoever. Couldn't help but think he's simply in the wrong job...

Views were amazing, bar was great as was the service there, but we came for the restaurant, which frankly was a little disappointing...

Certainly in no hurry to return, and suggest for the money, there are better options.!"
Lovely anniversary dinner,"We had a fantastic anniversary dinner; the food, service and view were awesome. For appetizer, we both tried the gazpacho, which was a great paring of tomatoes, peaches, and avocado. I tried the risotto for dinner, and my husband had the lamb.

The dinner with wine was on the pricier side, but it was a great Singapore experience. This is an excellent restaurant for celebrating a special occasion."
Fantastic experience,Was looking for a unique lunch experience. Artemis has a reasonably priced 2 or 3 course executive lunch set. View was fantastic. Plating of food was a joy to admire. Food taste was very good. Service staff were attentive.
KNOCK OUT VIEW AND GOOD FOOD,"By chance, we we’re introduced to their good Mediterranean cuisine and California wines. A real pleasure slurping up the gazpacho with caviar and cutting into a medium rare lamb loin. Both good!

Finished up with a chocolate torte.

All good.

Wes is the perennial host and restauranteur."
Lockdown/CB Mothers Day Delivery special was such a treat,"We ordered the Mothers Day delivery special as it was lockdown/CB - my eye was caught by the Pavlova and we werent disappointed!
A very happy and surprised mum as I'd only recently mentioned a craving for pav!
Cant wait to come back and dine in!!"
Had cocktails at scenic bar a week before borders closed,"Was here on a Friday night for cocktails before dinner, just as Covid-19 started to affect other countries. Excellent views of the Marina Bay Sands, and good drinks. We were there with a friend who lives in Singapore and he saw several friends there."
A valentine trio,Enjoyed the atmosphere and the food is good. Will bring other to have a quiet and fulfilling time. Not high class food but good.
Great steak and amazing view,We had a nice steak lunch here and loved the good. The view was really nice as well as we could walk into the balcony
Great meal at Artemis,Staff friendly and appropriately attentive. Artemis has a dedicated vegan menu which was inspired and very enjoyable.
Unforgettable - superlative outlook!,"I was treated to a special dinner at the Artemis Restaurant on Feb 4. Our waiter was brilliant. The view was superlative and the special unexpected birthday dessert was superb. We really appreciated the toasted focaccia bread served before our meal . Without it we would have been very hungry as our starter serve was the smallest half lobster (the size of a shrimp) we have ever seen, especially at $35!! The dish, though minute was delicious but hardly as advertised on the menu. Everything else was
superb. Thank you for a memorable evening.
The booking was made by my friend Carol . Our gracious waiter even took us to view the Bar area."
Will be back again soon!,View from 40th floor was amazing. Food was pretty decent. The appetizers were nicer than the mains. Was too full to try desserts which is a pity for my stomach. Service was good and wait staff were knowledgeable in the food and drinks menu + able to provide recommendations based on preferences. Will be back again soon!
Innovative and delicious meals,Impressive please with great treatment and very delicious food mostly Arabic and Mediterranean in contemporary style.
Top notch,This place had everything GREAT!! great venue great view great staff great drinks great atmosphere great food just the bill is the thing i didn't like but hey it was worth it and i didn't expect anything less
Mind blowing iberico pork secreto,"My gf book a reservation to surprise me on my birthday and knowing I love pork dishes and atmosphere of nice restaurant, she brought me to Artemis Grill and I was really impressed with the Iberico Pork Secreto. The marbling of the pork was great and it really melt in your mouth and the best way to have it is by grilling. Highly recommend it and the apple tarte tartin is a must try too."
Leisurely lunch with great views,"Enjoyed a very civilised lunch over the Christmas break with a friend and colleague. Very impressive setting commanding panoramic views of Singapore’s spectacular skyline. Beautifully prepared steak served with a simple but elegant watercress salad, followed by a great cheeseboard. 2006 Pomerol not to bad either :)"
Love the food. Great service. Enjoyable night.,"I’ve been to Artemis multiple times as they changed the menu seasonally so I always find new things to try when I visit.
We went for dinner recently and few dishes deserved a call-out. We ordered Cod fish seasoned with pumpkins, pears and capers, which is amazingly delicious; parsley risotto was a creative and tasty dish (they used barley in it which is a nice surprise). We ordered coconut semifreddo for dessert, having mango, pineapple, coconut and black sesame. It is such a perfect blend and the black sesame ice cream added a great touch to it.
Service staff and the restaurant manager were attentive and friendly. We definitely had a wonderful night out and will go back again."
Amazing views!,Had a very memorable experience dining here last month with the other half. The views are some of the best in Singapore and the food is very very good. Service was spot on as well. Great place for a special occasion.
Memorable NYE Celebration!,Went to Artemis for New Year’s Eve last night with my family. Had an amazing night - massive thank you to the staff who did a great job! Will definitely be going back soon!
Excellent service and experience,"New years eve 2019, had a lovely dinner and drinks at the bar. Service was simply great. Everything worked, staff was attentive and relaxed. Atmosphere was nice, not too stiff or serious. Special things like party poppers delivered to everyone for the countdown.
Food was great. Good view to the fireworks.
Recommended, will come again. Compared to the other bars and restaurants in the high rise buildings in Singapore, this is in top3."
Great location,"We attended a NYE dinner at Artemis. The view was amazing, but other buildings did block quite a lot of the view of the NYE fireworks.

The food was excellent, but quite small portions (especially considering the price) service was great. Staff very good in terms of greeting, getting taxis post the event etc."
Lovely dinner ♥️,"Came here for my birthday celebration.
Amazed by the view, food and service. Everything was perfect.

I love the breads they serve, beginning of the meal. It was crispy and tasty!

We ordered burrata and octopus for the starter, followed by iberico pork and venison for the main course. And they were just excellent and perfectly cooked.
I would like to try other dishes next time!

Special thanks to the tall and handsome Indian server who assisted us. Couldn’t get his name but he was very attentive and friendly. Really appreciate it.

Looking forward to visiting again for more delicious food! Keep it up!♥️"
Ideal Buzzing Venue for a Casual Biz Dinner,"For a first time intro meeting with an incoming London visitor, on a Thurs evening, the atmosphere was simply ideal. Happening bar in a distance from our quiet corner booth table, our brief episodes of formal business exchanges were beautifully elevated by the casual talks, which came naturally with the buzzing social scene. Food lived up to the standard and the wine menu was solid."
Great lunch with a great view,"Went to Artemis for a Friday lunch date. Excellent service, great view, reasonably priced wine options and good food. Thanks Artemis team!"
Ok,"Went for lunch with work earlier this week, there was 6 of us and we opted for 2 courses. A few of us tried the baked feta which was literally just a bowl of baked feta, you couldn’t really stomach much of it as it was so rich and heavy and not quite what I was expecting. We then had over a 30min wait for our 2nd course, which when you’re out for work isn’t ideal. I had the sea bass for my main, the fish was cooked well but I wasn’t overly enamoured with my dish, one colleague had the octopus which she said was good and a few others had the stuffed peppers which they also enjoyed, it may have been the wrong choice for me. If I do go back then I’d maybe try the peppers or maybe the snapper.

It was a busy restaurant which maybe accounted for the delays. Great views and good spot to take clients and visitors but not sure I would be rushing back unfortunately, if I do I’ll be opting for something else next time!"
Celebration,"Service very professional, love the view but food just normal, my beef overcooked and abit dry, can be better."
tasty and nice view,All the food was very good and nice view than I expected. all of staff was very kind and have happy smile. My friend’s birthday party was successfull at Artemis.
Very nice,All food was excellent except for the sea bass with crispy crab. Absolutely destroyed the dish. The crab was very oily and inedible.
Decent evening dinner at Artemis,"Consistent quality, decent value for the location and a thoughtful varied menu. Wine list is fine a pricing representative of location in CBD."
"great meal, and even better service","Have you ever made a reservation for the wrong day... I did, and arrived with 2 clients. I caused a little confusing, but the front office at Artemis sorted all of this put, had a lovely table and not for one moment did they skip a beat. Now that's service"
Cosy and great place to celebrate special occasions.,"Celebrated my wedding anniversary . Food and wine was excellent based on restaurant's recommendation. If you love steak, must go for the ribeye steak for 2pax. To date the best steak i have tasted in my life."
Better than expected,"Hosted a get together with client to celebrate the completion of project and thank them too. 14 of us were settled into a nice corner at the open bar. We tried the bar food - beef steak sliced, fries, pop corn chicken, grilled chilli peppers, BLT sandwiches, cheese and cherry tomatoes. The drinks menu offered a good range of beer and stout. We were there from 6 plus to 8 plus. Crowded at first. Music was on the loud side but things got quiet and comfy around 7 plus. Service staff was very friendly, responsive and helpful and patient. Left a good experience for must of us who are first time visitors.
The views are great from level 40. After our drinks session ended, I bumped into my sister in law and her hubby who were having dinner there in the restaurant section and crashed their table to share dessert - baked apple tartin with salted caramel icecream. See pic. It was delicious.
Must say the restaurant service staff are good. The moment I sat down with the couple, they soon set a plate and cutlery for me as well. Very observant and responsive, experienced. Impressive. My sis in law said the food was great, mentioned the iberico pork. They were impressed by the views too.

I would to come back with my family for dinner some time in the future."
Good for special occasion,It was a lovely evening for us. We ordered steak and it was delicious. They’re flexible when we wanted to have bread basket which is not in the BM menu.. the staff are friendly.
Sublime,First time visit to this restaurant and very impressed. The food is exquisitely presented and exceptionally tasty. Service very attentive but also very discreet. Great views too from the 49th floor.
Nice Grill Nice view,"If you ask my honest opinion this place is over-rated.

Firstly they made a mess of my reservation which I made by phone two days prior.I finally got a table with a wonderful view and that's what sells the place-The View!

My starters the wonderful Roasted Fremantle Octopus very succulent and the Charcuterie board.It was enjoyable.

The floor staff serving was very professional and my next dish was satisfying too-Pasture Fed Beef Tenderloin and O'Connors striploin with bone marrow butter.

It was enjoyable but not something to go nuts over...

But thank you Artemis floor staff you made up for my disappointment at the reservations desk.

Cheers

Great views great food,Stylish design and decor with expansive views. Staff were efficient and helpful. Octopus entree was good. Fish mains excellent. There is an outdoor bar but it allows smoking so not so pleasant. The music can be a bit loud over dinner.
Why only 4 when it is mostly awesome,"This is a hard review to write, as the good parts about my dinner experience at the Artemis was truely awesome. I mean the service was impeccable, the main course tenderloin all as juicy, soft, tastefull and even thinking about how well prepared it was makes me hungry again and the desert was an snesational variaty of tasty and with every bite and a little different mix of what was on the plate revealed new details.

So whay only a rating of four...
As the title sais, my experience was mostly awesome. There are two factors which, in my opinion, deducts one (and for other less awesome places maybe even more).
First of all, the starter. There was no love in that. I had the octopus, which usually is a dish I really like. It was to be honest a bit on the bland side and the alternatives were just simply unappealing to me - as I am not a vegan.
Secondly and this is actually where my struggle in my initial evaluation of scoring started. At a point during the evening I had to releave myself and went to the mens room. To get there I had to walk through the smoking area - way to kill all good taste and smell for the rest of the evening.

So I ask my self will I go back, no probably not as there are evenly good restaurants in Signapore where I do not have to get the great taste ruined by a smokers area."
Lovely restaurant with sensational food,"Three of us came here for a business lunch. The service was slick and the food extremely tasty. I had the tabbouleh salad and the Iberico pork, both of which were excellent. I would really recommend this restaurant."
Very bad and slow service at the bar,"We went there with few guests from the US and it was semi informal meeting. While waiting for dinner we ordered few drinks - very simple ones- wine, few beers and 2 cocktails. WE have been waiting for 15-20min till I had to complain to the waiter. Only then they bothered to start preparing them. Horrible"
Striploin Steak too dry.,All good with the exception of the Striploin Steak. Too dry. It wasnt like this before. I suspect there could a change of chef or some sort.
Fantastic view and food!,The food and ambience was great! And we got super service ! The table was perfect with a great view.
Great Service from Head Bartender!,"We held a corporate drinks event at Artemis recently. The Head Bartender, Francis San Juan, provided fantastic service all night to us and our guests. Thank you Francis for a great evening!"
Intimate wedding venue at picturesque vantage of Singapore,"Great food, ambiance and service. A one of a kind hidden gem of a wedding venue in Singapore, you won't find another venue like this."
Classy dining,"We were part of a lunch and the food was incredible. Although it was a set meal and the options 'limited', it was a worthwhile experience dining in comfort on the 40th floor. The dinner too was great. They have a fine choice of whiskies and cocktails. Perhaps, what is slightly discomforting is that the last order is taken by 9.45 pm. Rather early by Singapore standards... But what a meal. The choices of fish, lamb and chicken were not only good but more than expected. Cheers"
Nice food but really not your money’s worth,"My main problem was that I had requested for a table with bay view and had called to request for it. They assured me of it but when we reached they said bay view tables are not available and they don’t like saying no in the phone. After speaking to the manager we were given a table outside at the bar with no aircon. But since it was a pleasant evening we didn’t mind. So be careful when you make a booking.
The food was fine but not worth the money. The hummus was too dry, the falafels too hard, the sauce of chicken breast too greasy, the focaccia was too buttery and was served without any olive oil. Overall not a great experience."
Huge portion delicious food,Riesling Peached Peach/st Maurer goat cheese/hazelnuts and basil on a bed of wild rockets....super yummy.attentive service. Huge servings.
Best restaurant in Singapore,"Amazing location with beautiful skyline view of Singapore
The food was delicious, we started with shared platters of
Tabbouleh, falafel, Chicken liver & selection of Charcuterie, for main I had braised Oxtail pasta with side dishes of chickpea fries, tomato salad & grilled broccolini
The device was outstanding, they catered to the needs of the younger kids in our group, highly recommended."
A lovely dinner with friends!,"We had dinner here to celebrate a friends birthday as we had heard some very good things about the restaurant....we were certainly not disappointed. Artemis is located on the 40th floor of the Capitagreen building in CBD area and as such, it has stunning views out across the Marina Bay area. On arrival, we were warmly welcomed by the maître-dee and shown to our table. The appearance of the restaurant is very chic, the décor is smart and the ambience soothing with gentle background music playing! The menu is simple but ""flash"" - what you'd expect in a fine dining restaurant and with enough choices for meat, veggie and vegan diners. Personally I had ""Hokkaido Scallop Crudo"" to start and ""Iberico Pork Secreto"" for a main. Both were simply stunning. Very rich and tasty with all the flavors gelling together nicely. The wine list is equally impressive so we were able to enjoy a nice bottle of white and red. After dinner, we moved to their ""outside bar"" area which was equally impressive. Overall the food was excellent and the service first class. As a fine dining restaurant, it is not cheap but considering the quality of the food, the service and the view, its definitely worth it....certainly for special occasions. we shall certainly be going back."
Cannot fault this restaurant - epic views and incredible food with fantastic service,"I had heard good things about Artemis so was a bit worried it wouldnt live up to the hype...but I absolutely loved my experience here for dinner.

As soon as I arrived the staff were welcoming, friendly, helpful and i felt almost a VIP (I wasnt) with their attentive service.

The views are just breathtaking - esp at sunset - and you can watch the Marina Bay light show and Gardens by the Bay light show all from the comfort of your dining chair.

The food was well cooked, beautifully presented and came out of the kitchen in good time too. I absolutely loved the scallops and the steak as a main - it was so delicious.

Really glad I came and will be returning for sure - incredible dining experience."
"Great view, good food, efficient service",A good place for a business lunch that is raised above the ordinary by its view. Good vegetarian options make it an inclusive choice.
overrated,"We decided to hold our company dinner at Artemis for it nice view and relaxed ambiance. Some of my colleagues ordered Pasture-Fed Beef Tenderloin and literally, we are serve with a piece of meat on the plate WITHOUT any salad!! What a delight!!!

It was a quiet weekday evening and there are plenty of empty tables around. Mr. A the manager of Artemis still choose to blame us for not informing him in advance that we have lesser guests. Causing lost of business since he could allocate smaller space for our group.

His offensive remarks really turned us off and we swear this will be the last time visiting this restaurant."
"Artemis - A great place to chill out,hang out and just relax.","One of my favourite bar and restaurant featuring a modern Mediterranean rooftop restaurant and bar with panoramic views of the iconic Singapore skyline from the CBD which is breath taking in the night as you can see. Its located at 138 Market Street CapitaGreen Rooftop (Level 40).
The F and B/bar team, Eugene, Nana,Dominique, Francis,vMarion (the sommelier) a bunch of efficient, enthusiastic and friendly staff.Kudos to the Event Manager Adrian Yuen who is creative in event/party themes but yet has a good listening ear to the likes and fancies of clients and guests He played a great part in making a memorable event on 11th May for my daughter in law surprise birthday celebration for 40 over pax and another great private evening on 25th May at the bar and restaurant with my long tim and great German friend who was visiting Spore whom I have known in the shipping trade since 1982 when we were in our adolescence age. The burratini, pork Secreto and Waygu Striploin were amazing in taste and flavours which went very well with our bottle of Graziano Pra Amarone 2012. Could enjoyed another same bottle had we not had a couple of predinner cocktails at the bar. The cocktails are pretty exotic along with the appertising bar bites. The Aussie Waygu beef, Marissa prawns, popcorn chicken and Truffle and herb fries as appertisers are great accompaniment with their alcohol selection. Always a pleasant experience to be back at Artemis."
5stars,"I made the reservation from their website and got a prompt confirmation via email. The restaurant is located on 40th floor in Capita green building which is just a block away from mrt station. Service was impeccable. We got a table right next to the window and the view was amazing you could see a bit of marina from there. Food was lovely.
Thank you Artemis team for a great evening."
Good food and scenary,"Was hosted by corporate partner to dinner. The restaurant has very good view of the Marina Bay as it is on the 40th floor. Due to it being as bad and grill, the background music can be slightly loud. Service and food are enjoyable."
