Not up to usual standard,"Over the past 5 years we have enjoyed the restaurant many times. The sole meuniere never disappoints. Lunch always has a nice buzz and service is attentive.
The jazz playing in the background is my favorite. The ambiance is very close to a true Parisienne experience.
We decided to choose what was our favorite restaurant to celebrate Christmas eve.
What we thought was nice was the expanded menu for christmas, one of the drawbacks is that Granpa Henri only seems to have one or two pages in his cook book. maybe lost over time?
However although a limited menu with infrequent changes, the food is always wonderful, freshly cooked with good ingredients.
Unfortunately there were a few problems with our experience this evening.
After looking forward to this for several months we were surprised by the following issues;-
1. Christmas Music was too loud and such pop tunes as Wizzard, Slade and other such nonsense. What happened to Michael Bublé, Franck Sinatra, Harry Connick Jnr? so many Jazz greats singing yuletide romantic cheer.
2. Service was very slow and not personal. Whilst even after 5 years they don't know our names, we do usually get acknowledged and Chef does nod, whilst sharing French conversation with his Chef Neighbour from next door proping up the bar together, which we also visit frequently as excellent fine dining option. Both suffer from lack of ambience with lighting too bright! Fleur de Sel even more since makeover! and too small portions.
Anyway Gavroche Chef was Missing.
The restaurant was not too busy, with staff in numbers so conclusion was thy were new?
My message to both restaurants is don't rest on your laurels, if you want to keep your michelin star or grow, please take care of Ambience, Music and lighting.
Train staff better, change menu more! Food and cooking is already there!"
Lovely place for lunch,"Had the steak tartare with French fries. Lovely flavour to the meat. Service was prompt and efficient. Altogether, a reasonably priced meal in a lovely setting on Tras Street."
One of my favourites,"This restaurant is consistently one of my favourites in Singapore. I visited most recently on a Thursday evening with 2 work colleagues at around 7.30pm. The design, layout and staff all combine to create a fine ambiance whether at lunch or dinner service. The wine and food are excellent and comparable to any established French restaurants in Paris or London. Our group enjoyed oysters, venison and superb steaks. Great attention to detail contributes to an overall feel of class and quality, but in an unpretentious and relaxed way. Certainly not cheap but why should it be?"
Surprisingly good French food in popular & charming Brasserie in Tanjong Pagar,"My family had an excellent meal at the Gavroche. Our mains included Steak, Vegetarian Risotto & seafood Quenelles; which was all very good. We shared a Tarte Tatin which did not disappoint. Prices were surprisingly reasonable (by Singapore standards)"
Good lunch,"Great lunch as always, menu has lots of options and daily specials. Service is prompt and welcoming with genuine service which is nice"
Bistro french done right,"Friendly staff. Excellent food. Bone marrow on toast, steak frites, garlic spinach, tarte tatin all superb. Proper french bistro. Bernaise a tad stiffer than used to. I requested a sauterns with my marrow and they thoughtfully brought a gewurztraminer to try, which might have been better in hindsight. Good ambience. Reasonable price for the location and quality. Would go again. Only misses a 5/5 because the spinach was late. I think the pro move would’ve been to deduct it from the bill as a courtesy. But even so, classic french done right. Will be back."
European feel in a typical Singapore Shophouse,Difficult to secure a table but managed to book a high table for lunch in the front bar area. Pleasant atmosphere and attentive staff. Great food (chicken and steak) in a brasserie that reminds of those in Europe. Would visit again.
If you like authentic French bistro food then definitely check this place out.,Absolutely beautiful authentic French food. We enjoyed it so much we went back again during our visit. The duck confit was the best I have ever had. Highly recommended
Wonderful French fare,"Gorgeous Parisienne bistro . Great part of town as well . Loved the French onion soup followed by beautifully done chateaubriand.

Appreciated being welcomed by the chef when we arrived .

Be great to have more professional servers as the wait staff were quite transactional and pushed wine which was double the price of the ones i selected (for no reason). Other than that: perfect."
"Great Service, Ambience, Decent French Fare","The ambience is simply beautiful - like a real Brasserie you find in Paris. The servers were wonderfully efficient and welcoming. We ordered escargots and the smoked salmon special - both were competently executed. The Onion Soup was a delight - highly recommended. The mains - Welsh Lamb Chops were good but not great - I felt that the crust could have been grilled more crispy- I had better lamb chops elsewhere. The Duck Confit was very better done - crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. They have a very good wine list - all French wine of course. We had the 2013 St Emmilion Grand Cru - it was a light red and went down really well with the food. For the price we paid, it deserved the four stars."
Great value for money,"This restaurant was recommended by my French friend. Their food was so tasty and portion was very generous that could even satisfy my husband's big appetite. Their foie gras terrine was the best. This place is not a fancy French restaurant, but really good quality&affordable French restaurant. I'll definitely go back!"
"Excellent food, great service! Wonderful evening!",This is the 3rd time I have been here and I am happy to give this place a solid endorsement. The rump steak I had this past week was better than much more expensive cuts I've had at other higher ranked steak houses in Singapore. The service was impeccable and the overall atmosphere only adds to the great experience we had there. Great job!
Almost a good experience,"It was a birthday dinner with my friends who are frequent diners at Michel restaurants.
The duck confit & quail was excellent.
But the dessert was most disappointing, the apple tart tart in was totally unexpected....apparently a chef’s family recipe. The apple topping was sweet & mushy and pastry was hard (see photo)
We gave our feedback to the chef, but we were told that it’s just the way it is....a unique family recipe.
Pity!"
Authentic French Parisian vibe.,"Visited twice in the last few weeks, which speaks volumes.
Both meals were excellent. Very authentic French food, not boring, not messed about with, like these ridiculous fusion, Omikase nonsense.
Grand pa Henri will keep me coming back for more.
Only constructive critiscism, wine could be better, the storage system seems not to help flavour profile, choice of vintages not the best, overall though Excellent.
We will be back very soon!"
Extremely rude and unprofessional,"Extremely rude and unprofessional service. Waited at the entrance, no one came to greet us and no one seemed to be in charge. So, we walked in and were rudely told to wait outside and that had we done so, someone will surely greet us. We explained that precisely because this didn’t happen that we proceeded to walk in. Nonetheless we were told to go out and wait outside - unbelievable when we’re right in front of you. Why bother being in the restaurant and service trade if you don’t actually enjoy interacting with people."
"Mon evening dinner ""a deux""","First visit.
Great authentic French food. Excellent service.
Went for a birthday meal, got a reservation on the day and only half full @8pm.
Having lived in Paris, I almost felt I was back there except for the powerful AC which they kindly turned off .
Wine recommendation was great - thanks!
Recommend duck and the mousse au chocolat for dessert.

It is more an expensive treat than a regular eatery for us but will return."
Always a good moment to enjoy Diner at Gavroche,"Aude, the manager, is very friendly and welcoming. She does regularly the cocktail of the week. Mainly finger food. Never disappointed. The French specialities are always fresh and delicious. Nice terrace ton enjoy a glass of rosé. I love this French vibe and the efficient staff. One of my preferred restaurant in town"
Lovely dinner at Brasserie Gavroche,Meal: I ordered the steak.The steak is wonderfully prepared. Atmosphere: Great for couple dining Service: Staff were prompt and helpful with their recommendations.
Occupe-toi de tes oignons!,"A personal favourite & as close as you can get in Singapore to an authentic French brasserie experience. This place is also in my top 5 for spontaneous dinners with friends or colleagues.
Confess I am always amazed by commentators who bemoan the intimacy of the place which is what brasseries always are. If you want privacy for that imagined multi million dollar deal you & only you are negotiating, then go somewhere else but for a good social evening or celebration this place is hard to beat.
The menu is uniformly excellent and well chosen from the Tasmanian Ocean Trout Tartare to Grandpa Henri’s Baked Pork Terrine with mains similarly good.my favourites remain so the Hanger Steak, Shallot Confit Red Wine Sauce & the Hand-Cut Angus Beef Tartare . As you would expect the wines are superb & reasonably priced given their quality. Not least the service.Very friendly and informed,flexible and accommodating -we arrived very late once and despite being 'last orders' we dined enjoyably with no pressure to order,eat quickly or pay and get out.Unlike some other places I could name.
Overall I must have been here at least 20 times now in some capacity -as a guest is better by the way - and can heartily recommend it to people who understand what brasseries are & recognise quality when they get it as here."
Don't dine here if you want privacy,"Came here with the intention of a romantic dinner with my wife.

Food is good and authentic, albeit expensive for standard brasserie fare, but it was difficult to enjoy it given that the layout of the restaurant forces tables of strangers ridiculously too close together. There is literally only a 50cm gap between tables, meaning diners sitting on the inside have to squeeze through with their arse only millimetres from their neighbour's face. Very appetising.

I guess they would claim they do this to create an 'intimate atmosphere' but all it did was make us very uncomfortable and almost afraid to talk because every word can be heard by the table next to us. Our neighbours, for what it's worth, had no such inhibitions. I now know more about those strangers' lives than my own. (I hope Steve's divorce goes through as smoothly as he hopes.)

I suppose this place would be alright if you are going as a group, but avoid going as a couple at all costs."
Authentic brasserie food,"Nice place, full of natural light thanks to a glass well in the roof, the dining room is like a real French brasserie.
Pictures and frames on the walls, staff dressed in black and white, a real surprise in Singapore !
The menu offers a good selection of meats like duck, pork, beef of course, a nice and tempting selection of cheese, and a few good desserts.
Go for the lemon tart!
Decent selection of wines by the glass, and a beautiful list of bottles too. Impressive choice of Cognac...for next time.
According to the wine you will choose, the bill can go easily to $100 per person, but it was worth it."
A Brasserie worth its name (in food as in service!),"Gavroche brasserie looks like a brasserie, taste like a brasserie and serves food like a brasserie. I’d recommend the foie gas as a starter to share and then, simply, the steak-frites which is of quality. All that with a Chateau Simard and you’re all set. Service is alright but could be improved. Some waiters played hide&seek and that was a bit aggravating (It’s one major downside in France’s bistros that need not be copied in Singapore)
This apart, an acceptable quality / price experience.
Yours truly, your taster
Salomon"
Authentic French Brasserie,"Great service, decor and atmosphere. After all these years, Gavroche has maintained quality food and warmth. My favourite French joint"
One of the best French restaurants in Asia!,My Parisian friend in Singapore recommended this restaurant for authentic flavours and it did not disappoint. Well done to the Chef through to the Sommelier for a fantastic dinning experience. We will be back.
Can be better....,"Everything is good.
Except the staff seriously lack of personal touch. (Had a birthday dinner with friends there, a birthday bouquet was arranged to hand delivered to the restaurant to us. The service staff called rudely for verification. Instead of a birthday greetings, was impolitely informed that time had been wasted to look for us. Very disappointing experience. )"
Delicious!,"Fantastic, relaxed evening here (on a Monday evening) with colleagues to celebrate some new arrivals into the team.

Beautifully appointed, attentive staff and decent choice of drinks.

Menu was fairly large, but not in a bad way. Most around the table had steak - it was the best steak I’ve ever eaten in Singapore. Rounded off some desserts and calvados.

Would thoroughly recommend."
Reasonable,"Had a dinner there with a good friend. The food was ok. The four gras for two was the highlight for me. Generous portion. My friend enjoyed his lamp very much but my steak was average - bit tough to be honest.
Overall reasonable food but price is a tad high for this level."
Average meal,"I have ordered the same food as some people who has left great review however I just find the food average and extremely expensive for the quality/ taste. Maybe I have different taste as I do see a lot of patrons even on weekdays and there were so many good reviews. Onion soup almost does not have cheese but big portion. Cheese ravioli has too much flour in it, also big portion. Foie gras was ok. They served all 3 dishes at the same time which is unusual to me. By the time I move to 3rd dish (ravioli), it is already cold and cream sauce dried."
A perfect French brasserie experience in a lively and upcoming neighbourhood,"Simply every dish on the menu looks (and probably) tastes amazing.
The spirit of this French brasserie is fully authentic, with a friendly and efficient service, a great, not too noisy, atmosphere.
Our only regret is that the 3 of us could not try more dishes between us."
Best beef tartare in Singapore,"Excellent French restaurant. Nice atmosphere, good service and best beef tartare in town! Wines could be priced a bit lower I reckon."
Our preferred restaurant in Singapore,"High quality fresh products, the cuisine gives credit to the product and is not overly sophisticated neither awfully expensive for a French restaurant in Singapore."
Genuinely Good Food,"Food was delicious! Onion soup was rich in flavour but incredibly light and easy to drink. The lamb chops were a tad overdone for what I ordered but still very tender and juicy. The ravioli is my ultimate favorite, served with light cream and the freshest chives Ive ever tasted. However there’s room for improvement from the waiters, seems like the place is understaff as our wine and water glass would go empty and we had to ask multiple times for it to be refilled."
Authentic French cuisine,First time visit. Love the onion soup. My husband had a steak I had quail. All good. Will come back again.
Food with soul,"Nice discrete entrance. Cosy atmosphere inside yet crisp and clean and neat. Excellent waiters. Truly refined. Unusual in Singapore.
The portions are hearty and not stingy like other French restaurants in Singapore . The wine glass is filled with a heart, the simple bread and butter is delicious which indicates what’s to come. Simple yet correct brasserie classic dishes and crepes Suzette !! In fact the desert menu is perfect. I had almost stopped going to french restaurants in Singapore as they usually disappoint and are very petty with the food ( the opposite of France itself ) A bientot !"
Prestige Paris Brasserie in a Singapore foods street,"The atmosphere is brasserie Paris, and the foods is gourmet Paris. If you like it gourmet and NOT over salted, the tartine d’Os à Moelle is waow, you would give everything for the Œufs meurette, and the gratin de fruits de Mer et Homard is crazy. You add a good wine card to the whole, and here you are...."
Delightful experience,"Located in an authentic part of town, Brassiere Gavroche welcomes guests to a pleasant environment. Added value is that despite the clear French imprint, tables are of standard size! Those familiar with French typical settings will appreciate not having to struggle to dine on postcard size table.

Attentive service, food quality and presentation, and an adequate wine lists are the pillars of a delightful experience, something this fine outlet delivers with flying colours.

Will definitely visit again when in Singapore."
"Food is Nice, Ambience is good","Staff is friendly. Food is pretty good , and love it. Ordered the scallop is very nice, but mussels were not available before Thursday. Will come back again !"
Overall not enough staff to serve clients. Good food but far too long for order to be taken and food to be served. Will,Overall not enough staff to serve clients. Good food but far too long for order to be taken and food to be served.
Average food and no personal touch.,"This place clearly rely on its ambiance to attract customers.
From all the dishes we ordered none of them was anything special and all were overpriced.
The service was more than basic.
With all the choices in the city, this is definitely not a place we'll come back to."
(One of) Best French Food in Singapore,"We went to this place with no expectation what so ever but the it is by far One of the Best French restaurant in town

We had Foie Gras Terrine and Bone Marrow for appetizer and it was excellent.

The terrine portion was good size (big).

We had Steak Frites and Sea Bream fish.
The steak Frites was excellent on how they cook it. It was medium rare (as requested) but crispy on the outside (it was rib eye).

The sea bream with vegetable was very secullent and tasty.

We had crepe suzette for dessert and they are swimming in Grand Marnier sauce.... Amazingly Tasty!!

We are very satisfied and will return for more tasty food"
Great birthday dinner with friends!,"Great food and service for this birthday dinner with friends. We have a couple of favorite French restaurants in Singapore and wanted to try a new one. I particularly appreciated that they give you bread and ice water, oysters were super fresh and tasty, meet was perfect and they had my favorite dessert tarte tatin. I will be coming back to Brasserie Gavroche with my family very soon."
Don’t believe the hype,"Inconsistent food, in attentive service and way over priced. Too bad because has potential. Don’t go."
"Best value for french food in Singapore, great cuisine",I am french and I have tried a few french restaurants in Singapore and this is my favorite. The menu is awesome really bringing a lot of traditionnal dishes to the table and all of them cooked with great art. The flavors are just amazing and it's a great pleasure from the first bite till the end... Price is fair given Singapore market standard. Would go back in a heartbeat....
Pure indulgence in a Parisian setting,"Ten of us enjoyed an excellent evening together at this truly authentic restaurant over the weekend and we couldn’t have been any happier with our dinner party choice. Stepping out of the humidity of Tras street only to be instantly transported into a Parisian brasserie was a wonderful experience. Delicately furnished, Brasserie Gavroche feels informal and dare I say it, ‘French’ from the get go and things only got better as we progressed towards the food!

Accompanied by a delicious Sancerre, the bone marrow on toasted Sourdough seemed to unanimously win over most of our group as the starter of choice, a generous serving that not only filled us with delicious, garlicy goodness but also with anticipation for what the main courses would deliver.

For three of us sharing, that was a rare Côte de boeuf that is as good as any I have ever had in Singapore, a truly special event in itself that was only made better thanks to a few bottles of full bodied red that the waitress on our table attentively poured thus ensuring that no glass on our table ever went empty.

Desserts followed for some, cheese for others, everyone was clearly more than satisfied. A round of Islay single malts capped the meal off nicely before we graciously thanked the team and went on our various merry ways although sitting here typing this review a couple of days later, I doubt that it will be long before we make the return trip and I am even not sure that I have even really left at all!"
Vegetarian Friendly French - Finally!,"We chose Brasserie Gavroche because it has a vegetarian dish on the menu that isn't truffled something or other. Most French restaurants in Singapore don't even offer a vegetarian option so we had to try one that did.

We had the Onion Soup - classic French and very nice. We also had the escargot with looked quite small but what we really liked was the dish wasn't swimming in butter. There was just enough left over sauce for the bread and that's all we needed.

The vegetarian option is a couscous stuffed tomato which looked a little small on arrival compared to the giant plate of duck confit and accompaniments that were on the other side of the table. The stuffed tomato was great though and actually quite filling. I really didn't need any more. The duck confit was classically prepared and fell off the bone beautifully. We also had the green beans and spinach which were both excellent.

Even though we were both stuffed the cheese board was calling and so we ordered that as well as the apple tart. The tart was disappointing. It was served slightly luke warm so wasn't really great. The thing we thought was really great about it was that it was layered with a massive amount of apples. Had we had it when it was fresh, I'm sure it would have been impressive.

This is not a pretentious French restaurant. It's rustic and homely. We really liked that aspect of it. The service was present but not dripping all over us. We had a great bottle of wine and just enjoyed the meal."
good times with friends,"2 bottles of red wine with 3 glasses of cognac armagnac 1970, 2 appetisers and 4 main - total damage $699. the food was good. we had a very enjoyable and fun evening."
Disappointing,"This place promised much, but ultimately didn't deliver, in my opinion there is a surfeit of style over actual substance. There appeared to be some sort of issue between some of the waiting staff and the Sommelier, who appeared preoccupied with other matters than serving guests. The food is somewhat pretentious and expensive, even allowing for the fact that it is a restaurant trying to be a French Brasserie 10,000+ miles from France."
No personal touch,We were recommended this restaurant. Food and drinks were excellent. But no personal touch for a cosy restaurant. The sommelier disappeared after taking wine order. No welcome from the host. Couple of random waiters no consistency of service. When there is so much choice not sure if we wish to return.
Good Ambience,Love the rustic ambience and good service. The boss Frédéric is a friendly guy. We came on a Saturday and it was packed. Need to make reservations in advance. The food in general is acceptable considering the price in comparison with posh French restaurants. The hanger steak done medium rare was exceptionally good. Saint-Jacques (scallops ) was not bad. Desserts were so so.
"Small, friendly place with authemtic French food.",I was taken here by friends who had been several times and loved the food and atmosphere. I was very pleased at the authentic feel and ambiance. Service was excellent. They have a nice wine list. Two of us shared steak frites - perfect. The other had a beef bone marrow dish - also perfect. We shared a cheese tray for desert. Will definitely come again.
Dinner with family,"We were early, arrived by 6:25pm. We were forewarned they are fully booked with a bit of snob tone to vacate and leave by 8:20pm. I didn’t mind, I knew we would finish and be on our way. Our young waiters are very nice, serious servers. The sommelier could use a smile, the description and recommendation of wine was good. Wine was reasonably priced. They had our orders wrong, food went to wrong patrons and doubled on the Tarte tatin instead of Mille feuille but they apologized immediately recovered wonderfully. Best of all they didn’t have to warn us to leave. Pricey but good food. Good ambiance. A bit noisy if you just want conversation."
Tartare,It’s been a Long time since I last had a French meal and this was all worth it. I had the beef tartare and it was fresh and well put together with little or no mayonnaise and a little mustard.
Amazing French meal- highly recommend,"We recently ate here for dinner and had an absolutely delicious meal. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and it is very authentic (makes you feel as if you are in France, rather than on the other side of the world!), It is a very nice setting for a date night and had a lovely ambiance about the place. We would recommend booking a table to avoid any disappointment as it was very busy and popular.

We shared bone marrow to start which was fantastic and then had steak and duck confit for mains- both fantastic and perfectly cooked. It was honestly one of the best meals we have had since coming to Singapore and the waiting staff were very friendly and professional too. The restaurant offers a good selection of wine and came round with a complimentary freshly baked Madeline at the end of the meal too, which was a nice touch. Looking forward to our next visit already."
Popular French but busy on Saturday evening,"Our early Valentine's night out and glad to find a good French brasserie. We arrived an hour early and were seated at the high table by the bar. It was a better choice given the very crowded seating in the back. We enjoyed the privacy for about an hour until a large group started to have drinks by the bar. Given the shortage of staff, we could see the owner had to roll his sleeves up to care of a full house. As such, service level dropped as we progress with our dinner. Nonetheless, we enjoyed the excellent food; and portions were rather generous. The cold cuts had a combination of various styles of pork and plenty for two. The oxtail was superb but very filling and heavy. We also tried the rump steak and loved the tender and sauces that matched well. No room for dessert. We ordered the wines by the glass but thought they could do better on the selection of reds. In any event, we would recommend but do make reservations."
"My ""go to"" French Restaurant in Singapore",I always enjoy dining at Brasserie Gavroche and it has become my french restaurant of choice n Singapore. The food is always great and the prices are not over the top.
My fav French bistro in Singapore,"Love this place...classy, great food, awesome wine list, top class service. Business dinner for 7 of us...started with bone marrow on toast, pork pate, cold cuts & pickles, aged goats cheese salad. Most of us has the steaks for mains...either the 21 day dry aged rumps or the rib-eye. The scallops looked really good to. Finished off with a round of Calvados

Lovely meal again. Thanks to the Gavroche team"
A wonderful family birthday meal,"We experienced only the best hospitality and service during our recent visit for the birthday of a family member. We were given a wonderful table and attentive service, especially appreciated when we had two small children with us. The food was beautifully prepared and prompt, we enjoyed excellent wine and shared amazing desserts between us. The atmosphere on a Saturday night was busy but still cosy and relaxed, with authentic décor and tucked neatly away in a beautiful shop house in Tras Street. I highly recommend this restaurant for special occasions and for excellent French brasserie food."
Classical French fare,"Had a lunch there. Very good lamb shoulder, but the potato gratin was more on the watery side than creamy side. I hesitated having a half bottle of Rollan de By Bordeaux, but it was priced at 75sgd (this half-bottle is sold EUR9 in retail in France- it is a usual winner in blind tests). The glass of the same wine (with a better vintage) is priced at 19sgd, so we opted for th glasses instead, wondering about the price policy here. Very fine profiteroles. A good experience, but wine pricing is on the high side."
Good classic french fare,"If your are looking for something classic, cosy and yummy, you will enjoy Brasserie Gavroche. The service is good and attentive and is a good place to chill for the night."
Very good French food in little paris,A very good ambience taking you out of Singapore and into France. Service was friendly and attentive. The food we had was high quality. Great cold cuts with fantastic pate and excellent steak tartare and salads. Wines are awesome.
Dinner at Gavroche on 16/12/2017,"Good food, good wines, good service. Cheeseboard was disappointing: both selection and quality. We love to come to Gavroche and would definitely be coming again. It's a great combination of relaxed athmosphere, attentive service and authentic food. We also love the house selection of brandies."
Stylish and cho place,"One of the finest french food - great duck confit , excellent appetisers served here. Service is very good - staff attentive. Variety of food is good."
Dinner at BG,"Excellent service from our table waiter - Robin. Food was very good we had the snails, the foie gras, the special - Cote De Beouf and desert of pavlova. Also had a great bottle of St Emilion 2008. Bill of 400+ was reasonable given the high quality overall."
Another excellent lunch at the Brassierie Gravroche!,"When you need some culinary pampering on a Friday, you can't beat fresh moules mariniere and tender cote de boeuf, simple but extremely well cooked.."
Still as good 2nd time round,Visited 2nd time. This time with my in-laws. This is the first time they had French food. All 4 of us enjoyed the food greatly!
Bon!,"With so many new and modern restaurants in Singapore, it is rather refreshing to revisit a traditional French brasserie in Brasserie Gavroche. They might have been a French no-signboard as one can walk past it unknowingly along the many shophouses along Tras Street in the Tanjong Pagar vicinity.

The antique and beautiful powder blue doors opens to the classic French décor which provided the perfect segue to a wonderful traditional Parisian dinner. I reckon the best uniform for waiters is still the French’s white shirts, black waistcoat and long white apron.

The menu is also as French as you can get, starting with terrines, escargots, oysters, onion soup and salad nicoise. The three of us shared an entrée of poultry terrine with a mustard sauce and rather interesting mache (a small leafy green) salad.

For our main courses, we had steak frite with béarnaise, lamb shoulder confite and monkfish cheek with cream sauce of mushrooms and young potatoes respectively. We ordered a side of spinach to add greens to the meal. My daughter loves the French’s steak frite because of its perfect size but she reckoned Gavroche’s could have more “wok hei”. But the béarnaise sauce made up for it. Trust the French with sauces. So’s my sauce for the monkfish. Taste of France you might say. Some say monkfish is not tender for a fish and even tough. But then again, that’s why they call them the poor man’s lobster. And Gavroche’s memorable for me to return for.

We completed dinner with a tarte tatin. Theirs is an upside-down version with the ample apples showing rather than the pastry. I like the natural sweetness of the apple and perfectly complemented with the vanilla ice cream.

As I looked around the Brasserie that Saturday evening, I can’t help but noticed that there were mainly Caucasians and we and two other were the only Asians. Perhaps another testimony to the authenticity of the cuisine. The service was prompt and immaculate. They were noticeably shorthanded that day but everyone including the maître d chipped in and we were none the worse.

Our dinner worked out to be about $100 a head including a glass of Cote du Rhone each. Not inexpensive for a meal but together with the charm of Gavroche it was worthwhile. I forgot to mention that they also have a bar as you walk in for your champagne before dinner or as you wait for your table.

I can now count Gavroche as one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore."
"Great experience, As in tradition","Super experience as usual. Not the first time going, definitely not the last. Brasserie Gavroche is providing great food, with an outstanding service."
Nice french restaurant!,"Good ambience, food was awesome too. I tried the duck confit and its really good. The appetiziser we had (some crab dish) was so good too"
"Excellent steak, great wine selection.","Been to Le Gavroche over 15 times. Love the steak frites and the prawn avocado salad. Nice retro feeling and good for couples, small groups or even larger parties. Great selection of wine too. No complaints."
One of the French restaurants in Singapore,"Consistently the go to place for a proper long-lunch with friends. A place that you immediate forget you are in Singapore, but instead somewhere in Paris.

The service is professional, unhurried, and reflective of a top notch Paris brasserie.

The food, simple, understated, unfussy, with fresh ingredients but very well executed.

The ambience, laid back and not the first time one has spent 2.5 hour there, nor is it the last time.

Chef Owner Frederic Colin keep it going!"
Good,It is very French in a good way. I had the lemon sole for mains. They told us that the fish was bigger than normal and was $10 more expensive. Now I have been at this restaurant 5-6 times (yes it is that good) but they have said the same each an every time. Why not just price it like that in the menu? This time the fish was not fully cooked - slightly raw in the middle. The potatoes were a bit overcooked. My wife had the mussels - and they were a bit undercooked to my taste. The sauce was and bread was nice.
Excellent and authentic French cuisine,Cuisine as you find it in an upper class French bistro in France. The service is very good and the restaurant atmosphere transports you to the center of Paris
Average and overpriced,It’s the only one on the street and therefore usually busy. The drinks are all overpriced service is strictly ok and the food average. There are much better places close by so do explore and venture out
Absolutely divine,"Everything was great from bread basket to desert. We had the oxtail, duck confit, and fish quentelles."
Great food and service!,"This restaurant has great authentic French food! Service was good too. The duck confit didn't look refined but tasted delicious. The hanger steak was tender and well seasoned. Our lamb rump was excellently cooked. Our upside down apple tart was out of this world.

Overall a wonderful dining experience."
Authentic French Food,"For an authentic French food, you can never go wrong at the Gavroche. Fig is in season. We had figs salad with blue cheese. Pate de foie gras is a must when I have French food. Gavroche always serves very good fresh oysters from France."
Nice food..good ambience.,Nice food and service is good too. The servers are very attentive. However there are 2 hours of limit for the table and they will served us the dessert menu when we are still eating our French fries.
"prompt, accurate and efficient","Nothing to add to the title.prompt, accurate and efficient. Ambience is truly brasserie and the quality and value consistent with Gavroche in Sydney."
Good French and Western Food,"Rump Steak is of good size and good value ($38), Poach Cod Fish and the scallop dish is equally good, Profiteroles Dessert is excellent."
A touch of France in Singapore,"Very good menu and attentive service on arrival. Took some time however for a drinks order to be taken and again for the food order. A bit frustrating given they were not very busy. Food when it arrived was good, as was the dessert.

Overall a pleasant night however for the cost we felt something was lacking.

Nevertheless a pleasant experience dining in a themed restaurant in a shop house in downtown Singapore."
Great food,"A very cosy place with exquisitely prepared French food. I ordered trout while my friend ordered duck confit. In the end I preferred the duck confit! I will be back again to try on some other dishes.
Side note: Well, I hope the staff can be more friendly."
No Snails,"My wife ordered Snails for a starter, when they arrived 3 of the 6 shells were empty, she advised the waitress who just took the plate away without saying anything, a few moments later she returned with the same plate and said ""just eat the three and will bring three more"" to which my wife refused, she returned 5 minutes later with 6 snails...3 hot for new preparation and 3 cold from the previous prep, no apologies or anything.....first time there has now turned into the last time there, super bad service and average food."
Authentic French Brasserie,"Authentic setting, good music, very good service and the food was great. The menu is simple with enough choices. They have a fine wine list so go for it, even by the glass."
Great authentic brasserie,"Great authentic brasserie that gives you the feel of being somewhere in France. Nice atmosphere in the restaurant with a generally well-dressed clientele, and comfortable layout with reasonable distance between tables. The service is good albeit a bit distant/business-like (except for the French maitre who is a bit more personable). The food is great, from the super fresh oysters to the great foie gras terrine, everything is excellent. The steak frites is also great: good quality meat and well-prepared (although there was some initial confusion between medium-rare vs medium-well which was swiftly resolved). The profiteroles were also good but my wife and I had to share this as the portions are quite sizeable so we had no space left for individual desserts...speaking of desserts, the choices on the menu all look so good that I wish they had a grand dessert option where you could get a small taste of everything...will definitely be back as this has quickly become one of my favourite spots to enjoy a steak and I am sure I will also give the sole meuniere, duck confit etc a try on a future visit!"
"Good food, Good value for money.and warm service","For dinner menu - Duck confit, lamb and beef steak were excellent. Very good value for money as price is reasonable. We paid about $85 per pax for 4 pax's consuming 4 main course, 4 starters/appetizers. Staff was friendly and warm. Very good service. We will definitely go back again."
Great French bistro,"We had a very nice dinner at Brasserie Gavroche.

Service is very attentive and unhurried.

We found the steak and seafood dishes a highlight - lovely presentation and beautifully prepared. The restaurant has an extensive wine list and we found some beautiful white wines that complimented our food choices.

The restaurant has a great atmosphere and is well worth a visit for a great night out!

Highly recommended."
Gd decent French food,Good food and service but slight on the expensive side for simple bistro food like escargot and duck confit.
Best bistro in Singapore,"Just loved this place. You have a feeling you are truly in Paris with the decor, the menu and the French accents of the waiters. The ""os a Moelle"" appetizer is to die for. Then the duck Parmentier is my favorite dish. Great wine selection as well. We will come back."
Love it,Awesome food and atmosphere. Excellent attentive service. Highly recommend this place. Definitely will visit again.
Great experience!,Had a fantastic experience on the occasion of birthday. The hosts did a great job to make everything perfect
Worth a try,"Came here to celebrate my daughter's birthday with her godmother. The cold cuts platter was outstanding! My daughter's rump steak was better than my ribeye. I also enjoyed the homemade Earl Grey Ice Cream and Peach Sorbet. Gavroche gave us free orange madeleines after our meal. Restaurant is quite accessible, about 10 minutes walk from Tanjong Pagar station."
"Good good, great atmosphere","Very cute and intimate French restaurant. The moment you step in, you forget that you are in the middle of Singapore. The restaurant arranged some tables in the middle, which I'm not sure how it feels in terms of privacy. We got a table on the side which is just perfect.
The menu is good, easy to navigate with all the classics. The salmon tartar had too much avocado and not very well balanced in my opinion, the foie gras tartine didn't come with enough bread which comes as a waste since the foie piece is quite big. Quail was great. Be aware that the floor can be slippery!

Overall I'd definitely be back here again, great atmosphere and decent food. This is a good place to take 1,2 intimate friends or your first dates."
Right feel but not convinced by food.,"Business lunch a Friday. Visually nice environment but smell of mold at entrance. Fabulous old wooden bar. Friendly waiter.
Supposedly French food.
I ordered veal rump medium rare and my colleague order boef tartare.

In came something looking like fried ham slices on top of a nicely tasting hash browns. Unconvinced about whether or not meat was veal. Okish dish.

My colleague witnessed he has been there many times and like their food.

The boef tartare looked like raw meat mixed with some sauce or perhaps with egg yolk and looked kind of gooey. I personally prefer when you see the beautifully grounded meat and add the condiments by oneself.

Anyway - probably good for business lunches but nothing I saw convinced this restaurant is worth a detour. The moldy smell at the entrance needs investigating and remedy."
Delightful Place,"Great place for dinner. Lots of delicious food to choose from (pity the egg with split peas is not on the menu anymore), great wines by the glass or bottle, and good service. It can be noisy when it's busy but I think it's part of the ambience and they are good at pre-warning you if you're next to a big group."
Very good time at Brasserie Gavroche,"We had a great time at Brasserie Gavroche were we pent 2 hours drinking home made sangria and rose wine. We also shared charcuterie and cheese plates, what a pleasure to savour it ! Well decorated place and good service also."
Great evening with wonderful service,"Service and food were great! I brought my friend for his birthday dinner and wrote in the note to request for a good seat. We were not only given a good seat, my friend was presented with birthday madeleines and a instant photo souvenir. Thank you for the great experience!!"
Great brasserie food and service,"Authentic French brasserie with great traditional food and attentive service. Nice casual ambience, good menu and excellent wine list."
French food in traditional bistro,I really like the decoration and the atmosphere. The waiters were polite and helpful. The food was really good. I tried the special Pea soup and tartare. I recommend.
Service level not up to expectation,"Went to restaurant for nice french food but experience was not great. (1) Booking come in 3 seatings with specific hours you can stay in restaurant, for example booking for 630pm needs to leave by 830pm. (2) Did a booking for 730pm and arrived early for pre-dinner drinks. Can't do it in the restaurant and also the bar opposite (belonging to same restaurant) are not connected. (3) Requested for corner table but was provided a table right in the middle of busy restaurant. (4) Restaurant seems short of staff and they tried to serve but they are apparently really busy. (5) We ordered a bottle of wine, the service staff arrived with the wine and then disappeared for 15 minutes. It is unusual as we expected the bottle to be opened for tasting and then poured for consumption. We thought the restaurant was having the wine poured into a decanter but it did not happened."
Impeccable French dining.,"Unassuming restaurant front adds to the charm of the entire dining experience. I felt I was in a different time and place. Beyond the good food, everything else was so well considered! Great ambience from the lighting, music selection etc. I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner there and would definitely return. So glad to have been able to introduce the restaurant to my husband and friends."
