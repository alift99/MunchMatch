Impressive plating and superb quality of food,"I thought the restaurant has an interesting theme and decided to bring my family to try out.
Great choice. Food was as delicious as it was visually to look at. Plating of the dishes were top notch.
Service was great too. We were seated at the end of the restaurant, but we were not neglected at all.
To our surprise, we were treated to a small dessert (very yummy) and a small can of Asahi beer.
The only downside is that space was small.
But it’s like sitting in Economy class but fed First class food.
Very enjoyable dinner. We will definitely return."
First class ticket to Japan,Miniscule Sushi Airways is your first-class ticket to Japan seafood freshness direct. I’ve always loved this spot. Premium sashimi platter celebrates seafood fresh - fish is skilfully sliced and gorgeously presented on a bed of ice. It’s almost as if you’ve fished them straight out of the sea. Live sea urchin is the star of this neat ensemble. Lobster is charcoal-grilled with the smoky flavours sliding off the tender succulent flesh. Trip to Japan? Take off now.
Very satisfying visit to Sushi Airways,"Customer Service is top notch! We had a wonderful time at the cozy corner of 5 seats. Food is also well prepared, well presented and definitely with excellent quality, especially the A5 grade steak. I recommend people to go and experience the airplane dining style Japanese restaurant. Thanks for the great service and the free birthday slice cake!"

Food,Such a good place to dine in..nice food nice service..the waitress was talkative and friendly and the chefs was good in skill..keep it up and will bring more friends to come often..
Interesting theme restaurant with excellent food and service !,"Excellent food quality and service at Sushi Airways last night.

Restaurant ambience - Interesting concept restaurant and greatly appreciate the corner private booth table. Able to see the Sushi Airways signboard from the window of the corner booth.

Food - Restaurant Manager Henry recommended several nice dishes which my best friend and I thoroughly enjoyed. Food presentation was excellent. Love the grilled lobster and the double salmon roll with crispy salmon skin, ebi maki (deep fried prawns with snow crab sushi roll), wagyu beef melts In the mouth and the grilled sea bream was very fresh. Dessert was yuzu ice cream which was refreshing!

Greatly appreciate thecomplimentary cheesecake and Asahi mini beers!"
Birthday celebration,"Disappointed. Was there on 10 September 2022 to celebrate birthday with husband, spend more than 200sgd for 2 pax with complimentary of a slice of cake instead of sushi cake. Called was made on 28 July 2022 at 1240pm to Sushi Airways restaurant, enquire with the term and condition of the sushi cake as for birthday celebration and asked them whether I need to book early for the food/ cake etc… that’s why I called early .The operator told me no need to do booking, can order right away when we at the restaurant. I was shocked when a slice cake came when I expected a sushi cake ( the reason I chosen this restaurant because the birthday cake looks special but at the end never get to taste it ). Really disappointing. The staff on board told me that I cannot write birthday celebration, must write specifically ‘request for sushi cake’, hey man, how do I know when no staff is telling me to do so when I called. What was told is I can order when Im on board.
Such a disappointment"
Food is nice but the service must improve.,"Today I went with my wife to have dinner there ,the waitress is talking to my wife, and the manager is very rude, he use his hand to poke my wife shoulder below hand and poke at least 3 times, I was shocked, I ask him why you poke my wife?He still say no ,he said he calling the waitress, than I ask him got my wife problem, why you poke my wife hand. I think he have some illness.i am so sad hope that the boss can go and see the cctv thanks."
Sushi at a whole new level,"The quality of the ingredients in the hands of the skilled chefs at Sushi Airways a delightful dining experience! Your senses will definitely be elevated - the food looks, smells, tastes divine."
The best sushi restaurant ever!,"I recently visited Singapore and was recommended to try the sushi at Sushi Airways. It was a gastronomic delight and a feast for the eyes! Almost too pretty to eat, every mouthful left our group in gourmet heaven. This restaurant is defintely one of the top sushi restaurants in Singapore and well worth a visit. Top quality ingredients are used in abundance and both the sushi as well as the non sushi dishes are simply delicious. The ambience is cozy and the decor subtle with an aircraft in the air theme. Cranes can be found on the walls, the glass partitions and are the origami ceramic chopstick holders. We felt as if we were fine dining in the clouds! The service was excellent; the servers very attentive with each dish explained to us. Overall a simply unforgettable experience! Take a look at the photos!"
Exquisite food in a unique setting,"This is my favourite Japanese restaurant by far. The food is consistently excellent and the service is good. I had my usual double salmon maki roll and ebi maki roll, the soft shell crab salad and the grilled lobster. I intend to go back for the Omakase, as the chef 's Omakase is one of the best in town."
Boarded economy class,"Raw food is generally fresh with good presentation. Cooked food was on a more salty side. The service was a little tad bad when we patronised. Not sure if we boarded the economy seat, that’s y!"
Horrific scammish service; see other 1-star reviews!,"FYI: I have deleted my original review to post this review. However, I have attached here screenshots of my original review together with the manager response. As is my style, I will refrain from ad-hominem attacks and disparaging comments that detract from an objective review of events.

Before giving a detailed description of what actually happened back in Jan 2021 when I visited Sushi Airways (SA), I need to clarify that:

(1) My original review stated clearly that my visit to SA was back in Jan 2021, even though the review was only written and posted in Nov 2021. I see no issues with this since TripAdvisor's review system offers this as a feature.

(2) My original review was deliberately kept short and concise because I did not wish to further escalate things. However, since I have been ""invited"" by SA's management to prove myself, this review shall describe clearly the events of that day.

(3) I take offense to SA's response to my original review since it implied that I have a questionable and nasty character/personality. I will personally refrain from unbecoming ad-hominem attacks of specific individuals.

(4) I stand by my original review and I give credit where it's due. I do not lie, make up stories, or twist facts to make myself look good/better. My verdict was/is: SA offers 5-star food with 0-star service.

And now, on to the description of what transpired, in chronological order.

10 days before my visit to SA, I called in to make a reservation. I was advised, repeatedly, over the phone, when I enquired about the usage of Klook vouchers, that I could buy as many Klook vouchers as I wanted and stacked them to offset the bill of the meal.

To confirm this, I asked the person over the phone a few times: ""as many vouchers as I want?"", ""sure can stack?"", ""multiple vouchers can be used?"". The person responded in the affirmative each and every time.

Subsequently, I got a message on WhatsApp to confirm my omakase booking. I confirmed once again that I wanted the $200 omakase meal for 2 pax. I was asked to send them a screenshot of my Klook voucher after I have made the purchase, to which I acquiesce.

On the day of the dinner itself, some time after being seated, I was abruptly approached by Li Min to settle the bill, at the table, in the middle of a conversation with my BF. I was asked to confirm that I had purchased a total of 5 Klook vouchers (4 x $100, and 1 x $50) amounting to a total of $450. Upon my confirmation, Li Min pulled out a device to scan and redeem ALL of my vouchers. Up till this point, I was still pretty happy with the progress of things and was eagerly waiting for the food to be served.

Note that before the scanning and redeeming of vouchers, I was not advised of the actual final amount on my bill. There was also no mention of conflicting terms and conditions that would invalidate my redemption of said vouchers.

The redemption of ALL my vouchers succeeded without a hitch. However, halfway through my meal, we were once again disturbed by Li Min who finally came to inform me that I have an unutilized amount of $10. This was definitely news to me! I had originally thought that I would still have to top up with cash/card to pay for the meal given GST & service charge. I decided to ask for some time to look through the menu.

Barely a few minutes later, Li Min returned to ask us if we had decided on what we wanted. We told her that we were not interested in any of the other offerings available in the menu. She then recommended sake, to which we politely declined, as we did not wish to consume alcohol. I then asked Li Min if it was possible to un-redeem the $50 voucher. She was unsure but agreed to check and left the table.

At this point, my BF was beginning to wonder if he could help because he could clearly observe that there was an ongoing issue from the frequent visits by Li Min and her less-than-happy face. I explained to him the going-ons.

Some time after, a different server came to our table to advise us that it was time for the last order. We confirmed that we did not want anything else. I naively believed that my request for the voucher to be un-redeemed had been fulfilled since Li Min did not return to my table to advise otherwise.

To my shock, I was only approached by Li Min after the completion of our meal, and was advised that my unutilized $10 voucher value will be forfeited since she was not able to reverse the redemption process. I then asked if it was possible for me to make an additional drink order at this point, but was firmly rejected.

Upset, I protested and reminded them of the various problems with the entire process that led to this result: Firstly, I was not advised of the bill before my vouchers were redeemed. Secondly, I was not advised before last order that the reversal of my voucher redemption was not possible. I requested for a $10 return voucher that can be used on my next visit.

In response, Li Min advised that since the vouchers actually came with terms and conditions that would have invalidated their use for my omakase meal, they were already doing me a favour, and did not owe me anything. I was shocked and flabbergasted.

On the next day, I left a 1-star review on Klook, and was promptly approached by a friendly Klook staff via email to explain my experience. You can read the entire correspondence that details this Klook intervention for yourself in the attached screenshots. Ultimately, SA failed to provide a satisfactory explanation and their listing was taken down from the Klook platform.

Personally, I do not really expect or demand stellar 5-star service; after all, this is Singapore. Unfortunately, the service that I received at SA was truly horrific for a dining establishment of its calibre and price tag. Even though the amount of $10 is hardly ""princely"", as sarcastically described by SA in its reply to my original review, what really grated me was the entire process that led to this unhappy outcome.

Even more shockingly, the person who wrote the reply to my original review is the very owner of SA.

Should SA persist in such lackluster service, to put it mildly, I would not be surprised if they eventually end up on social media for all the wrong reasons. A quick search on TripAdvisor shows that I am not the only one to have been at the receiving end of such ""unapologetically lousy service"".

To end off, I would like to provide a brief summary of what I believe would have made for the ideal dining experience at SA:

- making sure to give your customers the correct information before encouraging them to buy your vouchers
- advising your customers of the total amount on their bill before actually redeeming their vouchers
- asking for payment BEFORE or AFTER the meal, and not during"
"Nice food, Good service","Nice food and nice environment to chill with friends! The baby octopus was definitely my FAVOURITEEEEEE, also the beef don, the salmon sashimi! !"
"Not too bad, great food. Make a reservation to avoid queue","Restaurant really had aviation themed features - service staff dressed like flight attendants + each guest was given a boarding pass.

Food overall was great - I really liked the Bara Chirashi and Chicken Ball. Service was good, staff was friendly.

Price was definitely on the higher end.

IMPORTANT TIPS - MAKE A RESERVATION. Restaurant seating isn't huge."
Innovative and very yum,Wd had a wonderful experience. We went for the chef’s tasting menu and it was exquisite from start to finish. Lobster dish was just amazing. Everything single dish was beautifully presented. Choice of sake was good and we got excellent advice on the options. Fun ambience. Memorable dinner / event.
A must go place in Singapore.,"A must go place in Singapore. The food is fresh and the taste is good, also the staff provide good service, friendly and humble. The chef are friendly too will chat with customer and asking for feedback. Sure will go back again."
Nice ambience,Unqiue place for a cafe.. A good replica of a plane. Service was prompt and customer oriented. Cafe was small but still ca maneuver around. Food was great.. Lots of variety. Sake upon request. Price was slightly over priced.
Good restaurant ( die die must try ),"Good dining experience, absolutely a must try Japanese Restaurant. Foods absolutely fresh just imagine getting the taste straight from sea. And foods presentation top notch, colorful decoration and unique way too. Services is good and fast , especially chef given his ample of time to explaining each of every dishes. Thank you. I’ll BE BACK . Let me shares my experience with u , pic tell the thousand words."
Amazing Sushi with Excellent Sushi.,Me and my wife had omakase meal. and was surprised that it was so beautifully decorated using pretty plates and Japanese crockery. Service was excellent and Chef all very friendly. One of my best restaurant and will definitely come again.
Great dining experience,"Our omakase dinner was very thoughtfully planned by Chef. Quality of food and presentation were superb. Thank you Chef, for making our dining experience so special. We had a great time."
Mediocre sushi with unapologetically bad service,"Mediocre sushi with unapologetically bad service to complete your meal. The ambience was that of a budget airline at best, and food was served an hour after my order was placed. If anything, this is the only sushi place I've been to that takes so long to prepare a meal that does not require any cooking (at least not after the rice is made). I placed an order for 2, but only received 1(and mind you, after an hour of sitting at the restaurant). The staff did not apologize, and did not display any sign of remorse for making a mistake. It must be a crime to have your customers leave hungry after dropping a bomb on the bill. Thank goodness, they only fulfilled half of my order, I guess? Not a place I would recommend for sushi. Trust me, there are plenty of better ones around."
Outstanding fresh sushi and fun environment.,"We try to come to Sushi Airways as often as possible. Tucked away upstairs in Arab St area, you are transported into the inside of a stainless steel airplane. Kid's love it with boarding passes on the table. It's a small restaurant and with social distancing, tables are limited but can book online or call. The food is creative and fresh. High quality Japanese ingredients and Sake. Look for the seasonal specials. I had the 3 types of uni, and we ordered 2 serves of the tuna sashimi which was just amazing. Kid's like the sushi and the grilled items (grilled salmon with salt is great). Service is efficient, professional and friendly. We'll be back as soon as we can."
Fantastic,Nice foods and comfortable place....staff and chef all very friendly.special experience will come back again
Consistently Excellent Experience,"One of the must-go restaurants whenever I am back in Singapore. Chef Chee Long never fails to deliver a wonderful gastronomic experience in freshness, flavours and feast for the eyes."
Sushi Airways great sashimi great prices,"My wife and I have been talking about going here for months. Saturday night we finally made it. The restaurant is small and in the second story of a shophouse. Seating is cosy and it has tables for two or four. Window seats afford a view of the bustling street

We opted for the large sashimi platter. Portion was generous, quality good and pretty much a meal for two!

We will be back!"
outstanding ....,"this is a hidden gem that I dont want to really divulge.... the best sashimi sushi lobster dishes.. wagu beef ..... soft shell crab .. blah blah blah.
the food is super fresh and high quality .. the standard of service superb ... the chef fully complimented.
the edaname beans are not good though and would suggest frozen not fresh ... good saki choice although limited.
highly recommended ... make a booking it has only 20 covers pre covid ..
definately a new favourite.... outstanding"
Mini episode of Come Fly with Me,"Little Britain fans might get the joke. Otherwise – It’s day 1 of Phase 2 post lockdown and the crowds are vulturishly thronging the streets. So a small cute aviation-themed Japanese eatery is sushi-perfect in keeping with my young son’s aviation passion. It’s his birthday treat.

We gave some of the alluring raw and meat-based dishes a miss. I wasn’t even allowed to have lobster due to my son’s new animal love (sorry shrimp, fish and crab you don’t qualify). Presentations are beautiful and oh-so-Japan quaint. The torched salmon and ebi maki’s are the true delight as you smell the torched whiffs lingering in the small confines. Grilled salmon is picture-perfect and tender. Softshell crab was good and the sauce is what elevates the flavour.

The aviation touch is the raison d’etre of our arrival here. There are 2 seatings given the first-class cabin sized eatery – 6 and 8 PM. Don’t expect first class treatment though although we were thankful for a comp drink and a birthday cake that worked through the rich and creamy tastes of matcha, red bean and what tasted like cheese. All aboard?"
The food was so great. Service is excellent,"I have been longing to try this out because of the unique settings and not because of the food.
But actually the main plus point of this place is the freshness of the sashimi and the excellent sushi that we had. It has been so long since we had such a high quality of Japanese food in Singapore.
I'd definitely come back to try more of the food in the menu"
The sushi was very fresh,The sushi was very fresh and the beer was very fresh. And it is very affordable especially for a place like this
Love love love the food here!,"This is my second visit and I had the grilled lobster uni (finally) and it is as good as it looks! Rich sea urchin roe sauce is generously brushed onto fresh lobster halves and grilled over a charcoal fire. A must-try. I also had the kurobuta pork tonkatsu. The kurobuta pork loin is really flavourful, coated in a homemade breadcrumb batter and deep fried to a crisp flaky finish. Dipped in the tonkatsu sauce it was the best tonkatsu I've ever had. I also tried the ebi maki, which is one of their signature sushi rolls. It's wonderfully crunchy, with a deep fried tempura prawn filling and topped with flying fish roe. The waitress/stewardess was very friendly and knowledgeable, and I love her stewardess's uniform, I think it is really unique! Will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu."
Mouthwatering and fantastic meal every single time!,"I always expect a great meal every time I dine here, and each time it manages to surpass my expectation! Recently, I went to Sushi Airways for a lunch with three friends. The chefs were in top form, turning out one perfectly executed dish after another. We started with the mouthwatering sashimi moriawase which is one of the best I've had anywhere. The prawns with uni sauce was the highlight, beautifully served on a Japanese charcoal burner and garnished with flowers. Stunning. We also tried a number of off-menu items. The double grilled eel (unagi and anago) had a fantastic charred flavour and the textures were excellent. I also had my favourite double salmon maki roll, which is something I order every single visit. We ended the meal with delicious juicy musk melon from Japan. My friends were over the moon. Fantastic meal every single time."
Average. But a lot of Jap restaurants in Sg is below average.,"Booking:
Had problem with official website (can't process the booking, unsure reason) and quandoo (said only 9.30pm available and no slot for even few days to weeks later)
I contacted the shop via messenger, responded within minutes. Helped me to secure a table at 6pm but they will release the table at 6.15pm. Fair enough

Deco: ok loh. Can see the effort

Food:
We order
- sashimi bowl, my friend said OK
- soft Shell Crab salad: average, meet expectation.
- sth like alaska roll plus salmon skin:
Average, meet expectation
- chicken meat ball skewer: the meatball is fine but the sauce and seasoning is too salty (teriyaki sauce, mayonese and a lot of bonito flakes)
(the yakitori stalls in Japan is already very salty, and this is saltire.. Maybe good to have just a skewer with a pint of beer?)

Price:
4 dishes above costs 101 Sgd net.
I guess the price is acceptable given the fact that the restaurant uniquely decorated and located in Haji Lane. Nth can go too economic in Haji Lane I suppose.

In short :
Average (don't get me wrong, a lot of Japanese restaurants in Singapore is way below average compared to Japan's), except the chicken skewer: too salty"
Good food and best service!,"1) Visited this cozy Japanese restaurant 4 nights in a row. That's how pleased I was with the food and service!
2) Service was always with a smile and prompt from both the floor and sushi station.
3) The food quality, to me, was exceptional. The sashimi was fresh and they were so accommodating to my dietary needs, which is good news from clean-eaters out there like me.
4) Victor and the pretty lady checked up on me every now and then, which was done professionally and non intrusively.
5) Ask the friendly staff for recommendations. I savoured the Ebi Botan which was a seasonal item and boy was it good!

Things to note:
I usually saunter in around 8pm and by then the crowds have thinned out. They close at 9.30pm so do take note this. If you have a slightly bigger party, please do make a reservation ahead so that they can try to arrange as best as they can for you.

They have a very attractive Set Lunch, which I missed out due to work. Hopefully I'll get to sample it in my future visit.

The washroom is near to the wet kitchen (washing area) or ask if you are unsure. I made the mistake of going to their storeroom instead.

The tables near to the sushi station has neat little hooks for your coat or handbag. Very nicely thought!

Take a look at their ""boarding pass"". It's so darn cute.

Sit back and enjoy the ""flight"""
Wonderful Lunch Experience,Interesting and cool decor in flight. Food was fresh and amazing especially the sashimi and lobster. The set lunch came with a reasonable priced.The service staffs are attentive especially Victor. We were very happy with our delicious lunch.
Not just a gimmick,"I was slightly concerned that, apart from the aircraft theme (yes, boarding passes and porthole windows) this place would have little to commend it. Fortunately, my fears were unfounded. The food was fresh and worth the visit. We had the soft shell crab maki, chirashi don, salmon ikura don and matcha cake - all were delicious and well-presented. And don’t worry, you don’t have to eat on a small tray using plastic cutlery!"
This place made me so happy!,"We went to eat at Sushi Airways last night/ just stumbled across it, having no idea how delightful the interior would be. It looks like an old school airplane and the waitresses wear Asian stewardess outfits! So cute. And the sushi was BOMB. So fresh and melt in your mouth."
Top notch sushi!,"Great place, great food and a super cute concept. Loved the views out the airplane windows to the street below. It was a small place, quite, would be a great first date."
A must try!,"A most delicious dinner with one delicious dish after another. Servings were generous, the service excellent, the seafood as fresh as you can get and the food simply exquisite and out of this world. An absolute must try and certainly to return to again and again.

."
Better than what I had in Japan!,"I love this place! It has a really unique concept, an airplane restaurant that serves amazing Japanese food. The sashimi moriawase, ebi maki and lobster mango roll are some of the best tasting dishes I have ever had, period. The service is excellent, and what I really like is that they serve the food in these very cute ceramic dishes from Japan. My chopstick rest was a miniature origami crane, so perfect for an airplane theme restaurant!"
Tastebud nirvana while flying Sushi Airways,"What a superb lunch I had at Sushi Airways! The team of chefs turned out one stunning dish after another. I was so impressed by the level of creativity that went into each dish, both in taste and presentation. The chawan mushi flavoured with black truffles was served in adorable perfectly cut egg shells, with deep fried freshwater crabs appearing to crawl around them. I have never come across a better version of chawan mushi, a simple Japanese dish here elevated to umami heaven. The makis have always been my favourite in the past and now they seem to have gotten even better, every mouthful bursting with textures and flavours while looking like works of art. The stewed pork was intense and meltingly soft, the chef informing us that it had been slow cooked for 36 hours! A signature dish here is the crayfish with uni sauce grilled over a small charcoal fire. It was definitely a highlight and was so good that I have to go back for more."
A revisit after my first review,"Revamping my previous comment , the owner took some previous comments more positively and made the place better than ever in terms of service , food quality , taste of food love , presentations and ambience ...

I would surely suggest this place for my circle of food lovers as it’s beyond worth the price for fine dining quality . Way beyond.

All the best to owner and crew members . Fly safe ❤️"
Outstanding Food,"Very cool location with an airline concept. Amazing staff, they were very helpful during the order and explained everything which we did not understand. The food was outstanding delicious."
Best sushis on Singapore,"If you need the Best sushi adress in Singapore, come here !!! Very good food, amazing crew, Nice local"
Worth a try!,"Interesting concept, cosy (not for big groups, max. 5 pax), food is good and refreshing. Very attentive service staff."
Try Before You Fly,"Once checked in and shown to our seats our 1st Class experience began with the Chief Pilot Arul introducing himself and thanking us for joining the Sushi Airways experience.

The entire flight was a gastronomic delight, presented like a Michelin starred restaurant, yes that good, rich with flavours that were tantalising.

Superb staff that were attentive anticipating your needs with a professional approach and service level. This is a must try restaurant for all, we had the Omakase degustation menu sensational and a must have accompanied with a great Saki.
."
Excellent and delicious!,"Nice and unique theme, especially the iconic DC-3. Everything we had was excellent and delicious and on par with the best in Tokyo. Save the plane (pun intended) ticket to Japan and go check this out."
An incredible experience with quality food,"Went with bestie for her birthday meal and we could stop praising Sushi Airways in all aspects. It is a very cosy restaurant, brilliantly designed and replicated the charms of an airplane. The chef and staffs are also very friendly and attentive.

We had the Soft Shell Crab Salad for starters and Bara Chirashi and Salmon Ikura Don for mains. The ingredients for the meal was very fresh, and although we ordered the lunch set, the portion was generous.

For desserts, Coffee Mousse was part of the lunch set and it was a fine balance between the taste of coffee and sweetness of a dessert. My friend and I agreed that the portion was too small and we were craving for more!

While it was a birthday meal, I didn't think of pre-ordering a cake beforehand but the chef and team were very thoughtful and served us their Uber Dark Chocolate Cake (with a candle too!). I would say both desserts are must-try besides their sashimi (and of course the rest of their menu looks promising). Would definitely be back to Sushi Airways to try other food!"
"Unique interior, great service and even better food!","We ordered varieties of starters and main courses to share. Really enjoy our dinner very much. The restaurant is quiet, service is good and food excellent. My favourite are Soft Shell Crab Salad, Saikoro Steak, Salmon Harasu Sashimi, and Double Shake Roll. Kushiyaki Don was nice too."
Excellent,Excellent Bara Chirashi Don. Yummy soft shell crab appetizer. Best is the Double Shake Roll! Good service too.
Fresh and Affordable,"Fresh and generous portions, great service and value for money set lunch! restaurant is small, so advisable to make reservations beforehand."
Excellent good & service,"Very fresh ingredients and excellent service!
Wifey said she gave the Omakase 100%!
They even provided a beautiful cake for her. The head Chef was very personal in his services to us, he personally explained each and every one of the dishes.
Decide to make this place a regular Omakase place for us!"
Such a great experience,Went with my wife and daughter. Such a funny restaurant by its original design. when it comes to sushi choices this is also an amazing restaurant. Day selection are really fresh and well prepared. Maitre d’hotel looks carefully after you and you feel well taken care off.
Airplane theme birthday celebration,"First time having omakase at Sushi Airways, starting from $150 per pax. Chef is thoughtful by asking our taste preferences if we prefer more raw or cooked food. Visual presentation is good, ingredients are also fresh. I like the grilled lobster with miso the most as it isn't too salty and would not leave you feeling sick of it. However the last stewed pork dish was quite a disappointment. No doubt it is very tender, it did not give any surprise and it is a tad salty. As it is a birthday celebration, a complimentary sushi cake is provided. What an innovative idea. Overall, I'm a fan of planes so I like the airplane concept of this restaurant and will visit again."
Sushi Always,"Looking for Japanese food around Kampung Glam to celebrate and chance on this peculiar joint.
Interesting theme of having a Jap meal on the go.. Meaning onboard an aircraft decor restaurant.
We ordered the Avocado Mango Maki, Gyoza, Double Salmon Maki and the beef.
Everything was so fresh and tasty.
Might be a little expensive and the freshness was something to celebrate an evening with my family.
Might drop in one day for lunch!"
Airplane Atmosphere,"Interesting location, its on the 2nd floor, once you enter you will be transported to an airplane atmosphere(without seatbelts :)).

Food is sufficiently fresh. get served by a ""stewardess"".

Do make reservations, limited seating available."
Flavorful & Fresh,Such a surprise in the heart of Baghdad Street. It’s cosy yet eye-catching. The food was so so very delicious. Every dish that came before us was simply mouth-watering. A definitely must visit again place.
Good for One Time Visit Only,"The airline theme is unique but the restaurant is small. The limited space means that it gets noisy when the restaurant is crowded or if there are boisterous customers. It wasn’t a great experience for us because it felt like we were in a hawker centre with all the noise around. Food is alright, fresh and promptly served. Nothing spectacular to shout about. If you are willing to pay a little bit more, you could dine in better restaurants in town (same food portion, more options and better ambience). This is a restaurant which we will only visit once to satisfy our curiosity and that’s it. There are numerous restaurants in Singapore that serve delicious sushi, so do keep your options open."
Dinner,"Food is fresh, staff is friendly and attentive. Highly recommended especially for occasion celebration and tourist as it is airway theme restaurant. Personally like oyster with ponzu jelly source and yellow tail cheek."
Fly on and on,"I called for a reservation the day before but it wasnt really necessary for our weekday lunch as it turned out, the restaurant was one third full only, even with walk ins. We arrived earlier than their starting time and waited outside.

You can see that they really put in effort to make it resemble a douglas dc series planes. The decor is really nice and had many wow factors. The 2 seater which we sat, i think it was A5, it wasnt really comfortable for me, as theres a protruding wall/object there, they could had told us, not to take that table and furthermore there were ants climbing up, from the glass panels area around the end of our meals.

Service - I would give them 5 stars, cos for our visit, they left the foot off the pedal for the topping up of our green tea automatically as we had to call them twice. Only 4 tables occupied so unfortunately being full wasn't an excuse they can use. There isnt any waitress or matured wait staff on our day of visit. It was for my girlfriend birthday treat so not being spot on, was a little bit disappointing as our expectations were high with all the excellent reviews.

Food - we had one executive set and one mini don. The presentation was fabulous for the mini don and good for the executive set. Similar to what one earlier reviewer said, looks small but well put together and quite filling.
The executive set is definitely more filling.

value- total was about $55 for the 2 of us, executive set was approx 26, the other 18 green tea 3 each (there was a service charge added)."
Affordable,"I called the restaurant at 10.30am to make a reservation for dinner. No one pick up. At around 11.30 received a call from Chef that they have a missed call. I was really impressed. More impressed when I checkin to find a cosy small restaurant with interior set up of a plane. Attentive, friendly chef and staff looking after you. Food is fresh and good. Depending what you order, the price is affordable. Must have the Salad with Sashimi. Worth the price. Grilled Lobster cost alot but do pamper yourself for once. Its worth it. I will go back there again to try the rest of their authenic Japanese dishes. Remember to make a reservation. The place can't take big group. If you going with friends max 4 and let them know you want to share the ""big table"" as the other table is good for 2 or 3. Enjoy"
A little bit of exquisite Japan in the middle of Middle East!,"It is surprising to find a Japanese restaurant right in the middle of boisterous middle Eastern restaurants.
The tiny Jap restaurant on second level offers peace away from the noisy though fun crowd downstairs.
The decor of the restaurant is also surprising; a little like the inside of a cargo plane with windows which look out to the busy street below.
We ordered their best sellers, the salmon n salman skin maki, the unagi with crab maki n the pork katsu. Food was very fresh; one could hear the crackle in the fried items and prepared n presented in unusual ways.
The only downside is that it was a tad expensive (esp if u r paying!)"
Dainty and pretty,"The lunch mini-don set looks tiny but is very filling and well put together. If you're a lady who likes variety, this is the dish for you! May take a while to come because they make it fresh - can't go too wrong with a sushi place that makes food fresh."
Interesting theme. Decent food.,"Wanted to try something different at lunchtime and found Sushi Airways! It immediately caught our attention.

Had the bara chirashi don lunch set. It was decent and hearty. The fellow table diners ordered stuff that was beautifully plated by the chefs in the kitchen, who were focused on their craft.

Loved the ""airplane"" windows most in terms of the decor in keeping with the restaurant's theme.

Limited seating avail so reservations are recommended."
Very unique setting,Chance upon sushi airway and decided to book there for our 3rd anniversary dinner. The restaurant setting will make you think that you are inside an aeroplane. The restaurant is a bit small so reservation is preferred to ensure seat is given. The menu has quite a varieties and food is being served fast. The waitress is very attentive and help us topped up the green tea every now and then. The sashimi is very fresh and I liked the chicken wing most. Highly recommended and restaurant is easy to find since located in Arab street.
Fresh fish well prepared,"I was at Sushi Airways for lunch. The fish was really fresh, the preparation well done and the service fast. A good place to eat in the area if you are not up to Arab food."
What a breath of fresh air - a unique and fun dining experience,"I hosted a birthday omakase dinner at Sushi Airways and all of us were impressed by the whole dining experience; the design concept, the level of staff engagement and knowledge about the food, and quality of the food were of a high standard.

Singapore's Japanese restaurants tend to be quite bland (copying the same formula), with most churning out the same menus and the same decor. Here is a fun restaurant where the staff are extremely service-oriented, and the chef personally took us through the various dishes prepared and displayed such enthusiasm for his craft. The plating was phenomenal, attention to detail very high and quality of ingredients extremely fresh. The chef also prepared a delicious cake as a surprise to round up the dinner service.

I highly recommend this restaurant to diners looking for something different. The menu is wide and the chef can whip up food items for those with particular allergies, preferences etc."
"Good food in a fun, quirky setting, but overpriced and small portion","It's fresh, tasty, and well prepared. However, it's by far the smallest sushi I've ever encountered, and at these prices that's a little hard to swallow. The service is good too, and the airplane-themed decor is cute. I just wish the sushi was bigger."
Nice concept,Nice concept of the restaurant. Service was excellent as they pay attention to each and everyone’ needs. Price was a little bit steep compared to other Japanese restaurants but the quality of the food fare way better. Will revisit again and a place to recommend to others too.
Wow,"Excellent food in a very smart and particular place. My local friend took me there and we had a nice lunch. Not far from the sultan Mosquee, you can a pleasant walk after lunch."
"Good food, nice ambiance, amazing service (“,)","We went here for a last minute dinner but luckily managed to reserved a table for two. It was cozy place like those in Japan. The ambiance is An airplane like with the steward outfit of the person who are serving us complete with boarding pass upon arrival. We tried the California maki roll and teriyaki salmon, salad and Sapporo beer."
Amazing sensational experience!,"A group of 6 had dinner on a Sat night, taking the second seating.
We found the restaurant to be unique as it resembles an aeroplane. The wait staff's outfit resembled air stewardess's, the windows were exactly like the ones on the plane, the chairs as well!
We had ordered the Omakase in advance...and that meant each dish was a surprise as it was the chef's selection.

It was no doubt the highest quality, freshest, most beautifully presented dishes that I had for the price we paid!
We had 1) fresh clam and scallop 2) slices of shashimi tuna belly 3) little crunchy crabs 4) melt in your mouth pork 5) grilled lobster 6) soup 7) fried rice with beef 8) fruit! The chef grinded some fresh wasabi to go with our meal... And we topped the meal with sake.
What an exquisite sensational experience! Tingling to the senses!!

The service was top notch! I applaud the restaurant for giving an older wait staff an opportunity to work - the waitress was friendly, topped up my green tea regularly and gave us more wet napkins when she saw we had used up ours.
The chef came to our table and explained the dishes we were having and that made the meal more interesting!

I am definitely planning my next visit and cannot wait for the surprise dishes in another Omakase meal!"
"Great place, funny setting.","I was impress by how much the commit to the decoration and the theme of being an airline.

It makes for a fun setting and overall the sushi is quite good.

I would recommend it for a night out."
Best sushi in my life,Simply excellent food and service! I highly recommend it for everybody that is looking for special kind of sushi.
Chirashi for lunch,Came here recently for lunch with some colleagues and opted for the Chirashi lunch set. This was quite tasty but a little small for me - ended up still hungry afterwards. A little bigger would be better. Service was efficient if lacking a little in warmth. Interesting concept and layout. Not very big so might be a bit tough to get a seat here at night.
Fresh Sashimi and Sushi,"This was my 3rd visit to Sushi Airways. It is located on the 2nd floor of the row of shophouses along Baghdad Street. The street is lined with eateries.

Overall, the quality of sushi and sashimi was good on all of my 3 visits. The fish is fresh as they have 3 batches of fish air flown in direct from JAPAN. The Chef however was not trained in cutting OTORO (red tuna belly), as the angle of cut present the fish with a lot of veins.

The other dishes which I enjoyed include the NZ Fresh Oysters, tiny deep fried crabs and the Aburi Hotate with mentai sauce.

I would not recommend the Kurobuta Katsu though. The meat is not fresh and have the frozen taste. You can’t really blame the restaurant though. Their speciality is in fish.

If you are a tourist strolling along the touristic Arab Street, and has a crave for Japanese food, this place is worth a visit."
"Superb service, excellent food, friendly chef","We been here many times but this is the first time we're so deeply impressed. Special thanks to Chef Zi Long 子龙 for whipping up such sumptuous dinner. Awesome service, excellent food & presentation. Thumbs up!!"
"Bad Service, Lousy Quality","Brought my business associates for lunch. Ootoro ($49++) was chewy and like breaking into pieces not the normal slice type. Anyway was quick lunch so didn't feedback though sub standard.

The thing that piss me was during payment the credit card machine broke down. The staff was extremely rude and unhelpful. Claim not their problem and ask me to call the bank on their behalf. I was like what the... Who is working here? Me?

The staff was the old aunty that wore spectacles. Not a single apology and not her fault attitude. My last visit to this place. I hope it run out of business soon. Good riddance."
Atrocious service!,"We had a reservation,when we arrive there were no tables available. When we finally got our table, the waitress decided to attend the other 2 tables that came after us! We waited at least a good 20mins.... on TOP of all that, apparently setting the empty tables were more important then taking our orders. Walked out on them! Not worth even trying the food (which could be, but I will never find out... )"
Atrocious Service,"We reserved for 8am but not only got our tables later, we were made to wait as they served 2 other tables that came after us. With the waitress no where in sight, we walked off 22 mins later."
Unique place for Jap!,Sushi Airways is pretty unique which offers an opportunity to enjoy good Japanese food in an airline atmosphere. Staff are dressed as cabin attendants. Good for a quiet and simple lunch. Place isn't very big but good enough for a quick meal.
Nice theme and good food,"Came here at noon on a Sunday. Nobody so nice and quiet. :D we ordered yummy wagyu beef yakiniku lunch set at $16 and chirashi don at $17. Comes with miso soup, salad and retty decent matcha ice cream."
Great thematic sushi restaurant!,"Food - The sashimi here is really fresh, with nice and seasonal selections too. My go-to is the Bara Chiraishi Set. Never fails to amaze :)

Ambience - What I particularly like about this place is the airline theme they adopt! The whole interior is designed to look like a plane interior.

Tip - The name your call to book with will be the ""boarding pass"" for your reservation. So you can make your experience a little more special if you're planning this for a special someone :)"
Unique and delicious,"The airplane theme has been meticulously carried out which makes it both charming and clever...simply loved the landing videos shown. But it is the food...fish I had never tried or perhaps it was the parts of fish I never tried but loved! Original presentations such as the scallop dish with all parts of the scallop. The restaurant is up a flight of stars and small, so you should have reservations. No cocktails or wine sadly but great selection of sake (appropriate) and beer. Hope to return to Singapore again and will head directly to Sushi Airways!"
Lovely meal,"Was here for a dinner date with my fiancée and I loved the setting of the place. Definitely something fresh from the places we've been. As an ex airline staff, entering this place brought back some nice memory's

I think the amount we pay for comes with the quality of the food. We had quite an enjoyable session and will definitely come back again.

Attached photo is the yakiniku beef, eel sushi and something else I can't remember.
Ordered the rice as well."
"Tasty, professional and personal","A client invited us here since they are themselves Japanese and wanted us to get the right impression of the country's sushi traditions. Which is exactly what we got in several ways. Very clean and inviting L-shaped desk which fitted the 9 of us. Behind the counter a ""grown up"" Japanese chef who made most of the food with his bare hands. Our Japanese clients could inform us that since men have colder hands, there are not many Japanese sushi chefs because their hands are too warm! I dont know! Anyway, the chef gave us interesting and useful information as we ate. The many different types of fish and small mixes of vegetables, sauces and other ingredients were delicately laid out and had a wide range of taste. Some good and some challenging for a Norwegian! Hence my hesitation of top score, a bit unfair really. Anyone looking for the real Japanese sushi exoerience should order ahead and go here. Recommended without hesitation!"
Japanese restaurant with stylish furnishing,"Sushi Airways offers an opportunity to enjoy good Japanese dishes in an outstanding atmosphere. The restaurant uses quite a lot of metal and aluminum elements for the appearance of sitting in a very old airplane. In addition, waiters are dressed as cabin attendants.

Prices are high as most places in Singapore. Quality of served dishes is adequate, however not superior.

It's worth a visit."
"Fresh food, melts in the mouth","I am not much of a sushi person and, therefore, preferred to order some lightly cooked or fried Japanese food. The double shake roll was excellent with some added crunch from a crisply fried top up. Ebi fry was so fresh and perfectly fried that it literally melted in the mouth. Potato Koroke was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Goma soba was cooked just right. For dessert, tried the uber dark chocolate cake (Belgian?) which was very good. There are other favourable reviews of sushi items and I thought I would add mine about the fried items!"
"Excellent service, delicious food","The restaurant is pretty unique as it is in a design of an aircraft with a pretty good ambience. Beside that, You will get excellent service from the waitress in the restaurant. And of course the food prepared by the restaurant was really very fresh, especially the seafood. Although the location is a little inconvenient but it really worth going."
Uni galore!,Here again for my fresh live Uni - Sushi Airways never fail to deliver! Do order their sashimi set and my fav rolls are: ebi maki roll and Mango Lobster roll!!!
Freshest seafood in Singapore,"Price was really reasonable, especially during lunch time!
Even though location is a bit inconvenient, it is worth having a try!
In the concept of a DC-3, aviators will love to be there!

However, seens from the television was not shown and the service is not really good. Thus losing 1/5 . However, will come back for the fresh seafood again!"
Impressive Ambience,"The restaurant is decorated around the theme of an airline- unique and creative. There was even a boarding pass on the table with the wait staff's name. The food was also creative and tasty, but I think I was more impressed with the ambience."
Set lunch menu,"I went for the 3 course lunch menu for about $16. It came with a small bowl of miso soup, the teriyaki main was nice but small and a scoop of ice cream. I guess this is good value for this place as I saw some of the normal prices and they were insane. I had only just arrived in Singapore and had only changed a small amount of money into Singapore dollars, we worked it out and we had a couple of dollars left over. We asked for the bill and a 10% service charge had been added that wasn't mentioned on the menu which put us 25 cent over what we had. We told the woman how much we had hoping she would say it was okay because to be honest they didn't deserve a 10% tip anyway but she just let me go out on my own to find a money changer while my boyfriend waited inside. Very irksome indeed. The grape fizzy drink was nice and the plane theme very different but I wouldn't return. You can get more filling cheaper food from the many hawker stalls in Singapore."
"Incredible sushi, poor experience.","Potentially the best sushi I have ever had, and the theme of a DC3 was also really cool and original. My Dad is a pilot so he loved the footage of the DC3!

But, it's a big and sad but and has been noted before in previous reviews - it got to 9:30pm and we were just finishing our meal for the waitress to ask if we would like to order any more food as they're closing the kitchen. Which we declined. About 10/15 minutes after (940), my father thought it would be nice to share 3 sakes together as it was a celebratory meal, only for them to say ""sorry we close at 9:30"" ... We didn't realise it was food AND drink they couldn't serve.

What is normal protocol in the hospitality industry is that if you have customers you will serve them until they would like to leave. I understand there are policies and time restrictions but 9:30pm?! And all we wanted was a drink. We found it really disappointing and quite frankly rude to be kicked out when at the end of the day, you could have made more money from our custom and it was so early on in the evening. We did question this politely with the staff but they seemed rather rude and simply waiting for us to leave. Really not welcoming and it ruined our celebratory family night out.

On the way out about 6 people were about to walk in - we had to tell them you're closed. Massive shame for you. You're losing money.

Despite this, I would probably come back for the food because it is some seriously good sushi you're serving. But at like 6pm."
Puffer Fish - Grilled Fugu!,"The location of this restaurant is not very clear as it is on the upper level. The sushi and sashimi were way above my expectation and for the first time, I had puffer fish - Grilled Fugu! It tasted like our Chinese Bak Kwa that is freshly baked out from the BBQ pit, sweet and tender. The downside is that for 2 pax, their smallest maki comes in set of 8! Hence I only managed to try 2 types. So if you have 4 pax or more, you can order more maki to try out the different varieties. The price is high but the dishes are totally different from those you find in common sushi chain - the texture, to the rice they used. I have to say one of the most unique Japanese food I have eaten in Singapore."
I thought it was cool!,"Of course the price was a bit steep, but for me, it was an awesome experience. What i thought from outside to be a laidback sushi bar turns out to be a total enlightening concept dining experience. Trying to emulate cabin indoors of an airplane, it was definitely compact. But the other people dining did not bother us. With friendly chefs who are easy-going and warm, flight attendant-like gestures, it was fun.

The food was brilliant. Or i supposed, unexpectedly brilliant. Sashimis melted in your mouth, rolls were tastefully different and we sat by the window with a view of baghdad/bussorah st on a post-rainy evening. Definitely chilled and gave us a heartwarming feeling. Try it for the experience!"
"Excellent meal, good service","We turned up without a reservation, and were lucky to get a table. The food was excellent and service efficient. It's not the cheapest place in town, but doesn't pretend to be, and given the freshness of the fish, I'm not surprised. I will definitely visit again when I am next in Singapore."
"Nice experience, but portion is small, food is not of good value","Ate here after reading of this place on lady iron chef website. This is quite a small restaurant on the 2nd level of another restaurant along Baghdad Street. The place is quite interesting, and some of the features and the bar resembles closely to that of an aircraft. There are limited seats here. Probably only less than 30 people can be accommodated in here. Service is not too fast, and the food portion is pretty small. The upside is that the food served was pretty decent. Cost-wise, the lunch set was of decent value, but all other stuff seems a little expensive. Overall, would recommend to come once to check out the place and take some photos, other than that nothing much spectacular about the food."
