Excellent services by William,"Went on Wednesday evening and was served by William. He was extremely attentive and patience with us. He patiently guide us on the wine list and explained in details on the food menu. I had very bad eye sight and hated using phone to do ordering. But William was so meticulous and offer to do the ordering for us on his tablet.

Went to few other wine connections and William gave us the best impression. Now with him around, we will definitely go back to this branch.

Thank you William"
Not a place for Senior Citizens. Not inclusive.,"I would not recommend for senior citizens. There is no hard copy of menu. They expect guests to squint into the handphone. Their ordering ipad pictures and wordings are so small, unable to see to order. When I asked the waiter for help, he said, ""I can't help you"". No wonder there wasn't a single soul in the restaurant!

Definitely not an inclusive restaurant in a world where diversity and inclusively is becoming more important."
Half a cockroach under pizza slice,"As the title suggests, this is what we found as we were having dinner at this restaurant recently. Serving staff were shocked, but their response was to bring another pizza!!! Obviously threw that away immediately and will never eat here again."
Dinner at HillV2,"We visited Wine Connection at HillV2 after a long gap since our last visit.

My wife and I ordered truffle fries, mushroom soup and a Spanish paella. Overall the food is good.

Staff are friendly and helpful. The reservation service was straightforward.

We were just surprised that the restaurant was full on a Wednesday evening."
Wonderful experience!,"Visiting Wine Connection at HillV2 is always a pleasure. Had an enjoyable evening today as well. The food was nice, and the staff, very helpful. Special mention for William and Syaiful, who were friendly and very accommodating to manage our orders and requests very well. Thanks for that!"
Nice ambience and environment,"Nice ambience and environment and good service by staff especially Herman. Will
Surely come again...."
Good Service Good Ambience,Not the first time at wine connection hillv2. Always had pleasant visits but today's good service made me justifiable to write a review. I was served by Jane during my visit and I only have praises for her. Food and drinks recommendation were good and of course the food quality was good. Jane was so attentive that never once my wine glass was left empty - It was always filled and we were always being checked by the staffs if everything was good. Thank you for the enjoyable dinner. :)
"Steaks good, good wine range","Steaks good, good wine range, just really hard to get a table and they don’t take reservations. Can’t wait to go back again!"
Wonderful dining at such an affordable price,"The meals are great at excellent values. We had pasta, pizza and steak. Service is great. A large selection of wines at a much lower the price than what you normally see at other restaurants. Ambiance is fantastic, especially if you are able to get the sitting facing the street with the greenery. Overall, it was fantastic!"
SD & daughter,"We always look forward to our Saturdays at WCHV2. The warm welcome by Gurmit, Mark and their wonderful friendly crew makes us feel right at home! Tasty food at great value and good wines that won’t bust your wallet!"
Nice Steak and ambience,"This wine connection bistro located at HillV2 is serving nice food, so not only wine as the name suggested.
Their special steak sirloin dishes is a good value for money at S$19.90++, and taste nice too, make sure to order it ‘medium’ or ‘medium rare’.
Ambience is nice, service is fast and efficient but can be improved further. The waiters and waitresses need to be trained further on how to serve the dishes / plates to the customers... not from across the table for sure.
As can be guessed they also serve nice wine ..."
Great food and excellent Service !,"Wine Connection HV2 is our go to for a casual dining experience with friends and colleagues. It has a great, cozy ambience and is excellent value for money. Most importantly, the food and wine never disappoints!
Big thanks to Gurjit and his team for the attentive service and consistently good wine recommendations. Definitely recommend starting your meal with their ""fresh'' Burrata. Overall a great dining experience and always looking forward to going back."
"Great food, good service and will be back again.","We booked the place for 13pax on Christmas Eve for our company lunch and all of us had good time. Order was well taken note and served timely.
Great food , economically price on the set lunches which are served the usual menu portion. Servers were attentive and changed our wine glass promptly as we ordered few bottles of different wine.
Good service extended by the Manager and team with a big smile on the face even though the place was busy and with the few request from us. All of us enjoyed our visit there.
Would definitely visit Wine Connection@HV2 again.
Thumbs up"
Like the seafood paella,We’d visited the Wine Connection HillV2 on a Saturday evening. We had a gambas with extra bread and a seafood paella. I like the paella - fragrant and not too wet.
"Great food, very poor customer care","The food was good and they have vegetarian options. The problem was the service, not only was the service slow. Our meals came over 30 minutes apart so when one part of the table was finished the other had not received their meals. The waitress and management did not say sorry or seek to do anything to fix the situation."
"Great food, terrible service & management","The food was well presented and delicious.The problem was that it took over 25 minutes for 2 appetizers to be served while our group of friends came together. We had to consistently ask for our water glasses to be refilled. Then, when main meals were served, it took over 45 minutes from the first main course served to the last in a group of only seven (and the restaurant was not full, it was a quiet night). So most of the group were finished before the final meal was served. Clearly it was forgotten, but the wait staff were reminded 3 times during the meal service and nothing was done until it was abundantly clear that one meal had been overlooked. Meals were served singly or in twos rather the food being managed so that all could have been served around the same time.
Not the kind of place for a meal if you value polite, efficient service. BIG THUMBS DOWN!"
Great service,Come here for dinner. The service is great. The waiter is very eager to help us to choose the wine. Pizza is delicious as well.
Excellent service,"I hosted my friends for dinner at Wine connection HillV2, the manager Mr Gujit has served us well. He recommended the French wine which is very excellent. He is friendly and recommended few dishes for us, which all my friends given a high five. Definitely will come back to look for Gujit."
Disappointed with poor attitude of Manager,"I have been a long time patron of this outlet, coming here at least thrice a week for dine and wine. I used to enjoy the cosy ambience and friendly service staff until recently. Ever since this bistro participated in Eatigo, I have utilized the promotion whenever available. I noticed a change in the service level. More than once, we were rushed for last orders and bill closed before we are done with our meals. These I believed were on the instructions of Mary, the manager, who never failed to throw rude glares at us or blacked faced us. I feel we were being penalized for making use of the Eatigo promotions. This is no Michelin restaurant, hence I do not expect 5-stars service level. However, I certainly do not expect such horrible service acts and I am greatly offended by Mary throwing us black faces. These have become intolerable for me and it’s no longer enjoyable to dine at this outlet."
consistently good,"I m a regular diner here coz I live in the area. Parking or public transport here is a breeze as with spacious quarters where you are sitting too close to the next diner.

service is a bit mixed and slow at times as my daughter finished her pasta before my steak arrived(not great steak by the way)

well located for residents in the vicinity but there are many other locations to choose from if you r living outside the suburb"
Value for money,"Food was good, wine served was not too expensive and it was an enjoyable experience. Visited this restaurant when hillv2 first opened and I've always been back for a good social evening. Thank you!"
Very disappointed with the service. Food are average,"Went there to celebrate my birthday, as I had tried the outlet at Somerset and was very happy about the food and service. However, at this Hillview Outlet, the waitress got the order wrong and yet refused to take back the food. Need to talk to the manager, in order to cancel the order and bring the food that we actually ordered.

Lousy service. Finished the water for a long time and no one bothered to top up. To top it off, gave us the wrong bill at the end of the meal.

should have just paid for the lower cost, instead of highlighting it to the staff. Lol...

Great disappointment. Wonder why such great difference in service quality between the 2 outlets."
Good wine with good food at good prices,"Most restaurants in singapore u have to pay really high prices (2-3x more ) to have a bottle of wine during dinner... One of the reasons why I miss Europe cos wine there is really affordable.

Decided to give this place a try since u can order wine @ ‘retail’ prices so it’s not grossly overcharged...

The food is good value for money which makes this place ideal if u r in mood to have a bottle of wine for dinner"
Bad service - do not go after 9:45PM,"I have visited Wine Connection HillV2 for umpteenth times. Frankly speaking, the food has always been great and I love this place. However, my recent experience was lackluster due to the terrible service rendered.

I searched online and found out that this restaurant is open till 11PM on weekdays so I visited the restaurant at 9:45PM. The staff reminded me that last order will be at 10PM and I have to leave the restaurant by 10:30PM. I said ok and entered the restaurant.

Throughout my stay in the restaurant between 9:45PM till 1020PM, I was repeatedly reminded that the restaurant will close at 10:30PM. It was at least 5 times that different staff came over to remind me of this fact. This made my stay in the restaurant uncomfortable because I felt very rushed.

I ordered 4 dishes: their Christmas pudding, tenderloin (medium well), mussels in white wine, and Christmas turkey dish. I asked them to serve the dessert last (after all other main dishes have been served) but my request was rejected because they are closing soon. Ironically, the first dish that came was the Christmas pudding!

At about 1005PM, I felt rushed and I then asked one of the staff if I can takeaway my food but I was roundly rejected because the reason he citied was he had already keyed in the order. That’s fine and I let it go — I just have to hurry when I eat.

Then 5 minutes later, I was given the bill to make payment (when none of the main courses had been served yet). I thought it was ok so I made the requisite payment first (my folly). And it was only moments later they returned me my credit card and gave me my food — packed snugly into containers and served as a takeaway order. It was a frustrating affair because they charged me full 10% service charge on all my food items yet I had to eat at home and I had received such very bad treatment at the restaurant.

I had asked for a refund of the service charge but I was rejected. To “compensate”, the restaurant manager (Jordan) offered me a free dessert of my choice the next time I visit the restaurant. I took the offer as it was late and I was tired and I wanted to close this matter out peacefully. (Epilogue: Subsequently I went back for my dessert, chocolate lava cake, and the experience was unfortunately not too pleasant.)

All in, I would recommend all customers NOT to visit this restaurant anytime after 9:45PM (though they close at 11PM) for your own sake."
Plethora of wine options; simple main course,"Extensive wine options simple starters and main course. Good staff, fast service, quiet location - would recommend friends."
"Good food, good wine",Went early Sep 2918 for a birthday dinner for family. Friendly service and attentive... Everything is so good and nice. Will come again.
Nice ambiance & food,"Great ambiance with choice of window seating, food was good, they’re now having a wine tasting option ($19.90++ For 5 x 75cl), service could be friendlier and less rushed though (checking to clear our drinks when it’s not empty)"
Always worth to come back...,Enjoying.... A lot. The staff is so warming and friendly.. Always feel that will come back again and again.. Mr Faizal thank you very much .
Awesome place with great staff!,This is my repeat visit and the staff Faizal is awesome to recommend us suitable wine which is perfect for us! Friendly and patient and able to recommend us drinks that suit our budget too! Especially when I brought friends who are appreciating wine for the first time.
Good food and wine,"The shrimp starter was good.

Fish dishes good, salmon medium rare was excellent.

Kebabs were very tasty.

Paella was different, good sized portion, and we loved it.

good selection of Wine and very reasonable prices."
Value for money,Food and wine are value for money. We are regulars since the restaurant first opened. Staff always try their best even when they are busy. We keep coming back.
Enjoying a nice meal,"Located in sub urban area, it is a nice place to get your food and also your wine. The selection of wine is good too."
Service excellence,"The staffs here make sure you enjoy your experience here. Great food. Great drinks. Definitely coming back here again. Look for Shidah on your visit!

Service 5 stars
Food 5 stars
Value 5 stars!!

Reviewing the stars here cause iPad decided not to let me click."
Great Wine,After our dinner we decided to go to Wine Connection to taste the great wines there. Excellent service and recommendations helped us to find and try marvellous wines. Best are the prices and the possibility to take away our favourite in the shop. We will come back soon.
Wednesday Dinner,"Nice little - well laid out restaurant to be enjoyed by all
We were looked after by Mary who could not do enough off us including an ice bucket for our Pinot Noir from South Australia
Bass fillet as a main was absolutely A grade could not fault presentation or taste
So we finished off with dessert-how filing
Fantastic we will be backThank You"
Wine tasting,We went to Wine Connection at HV2 for a gathering. We enjoyed the wine which is reasonable priced. A very pleasant lady (Ryna) served us with a constant smile. What an evening.
Ryna,She was very informative and knowledgeable about wine connection range of wine and even introduce us on the Tuesday wine promotion. Very pleasant lady and is a plus to the establishment.
Amazing in every aspect,"I reckon that 340 excellent reviews beat the 14 whingers who probably never been to a nice restaurant, are impossible to please or are just plain kients!

Anyhow, I have believed the majority and was still surprised in more than just a positive way:

- Top service personnel, friendly, prompt and attentive
- Gourmet food!
- Great wine!

Started with the prawns which blew me away and as an Australian I reckon we are spoiled with quality but those gambas were nothing shy of the stuff you would get down under.

The Pizza was outstanding and would rival anything out of Naples and the pork ribs succulent and tasty AF!

Had the Weissbier right out of Bavaria which would beat the stuff they make locally at Paulaner and the Spanish Red, Tempranillo Reserva, was more than good value and outstanding!

To finish off, I had the creme brulee with their dessert wines and if their would be one point of criticism it would be the absence of a herbal liqueur or any spirit at all.
They explained to me that the strong stuff is not moving and knowing Singas tax on booze I wouldn’t keep 1000s of dollars of cash flow bound on a shelf neither so def not a reason to rate down the experience.
Will be back on me own and def with me wife as well, great place, great experience, great service and most of all: Great food!"
Taste is relative,"An american or an aussie eating steak weekly will have high expectation of their steak so no surprises if they don’t rate this high as there re tons of great steak houses back home

To be fair, this restaurant caters to majority of singaporean middle class living around hillview or working in the nearby industrial zones whom would like their steak here.

i had mine and it was good ! there s always comparisons with steak back home and chain stores including ruby tuesday etc and the comments can be pretty legit

Management need not be apologetic here over what is expensive steak in view of the high overheads !

however the thin pizza could be fatter !

i will return"
Ok but overpriced food,"The food quality is mostly acceptable but it’s not worth the price. Pasta portions are barely sufficient for one. The pizza dough is almost paper thin and pretty burnt because of that. The steak is small for the price but reasonably cooked and not over dry. The root vegetables that comes with the steak are swimming in oil, a lot of oil. We opted not to have the dessert. Basically, the quality has been sacrificed for profits. When I asked for Parmesan cheese, it came in a small little saucer. Never again."
Didn’t live up to ranking,Felt like a step above Olive Garden (chain US restaurant). Surprised it is ranked as a top 500 restaurant in Singapore (let alone top 30). We won’t be back.
Inspired by the ranking,"We went there following the tripadvisor suggestion: in general good but not a real italian flavours...pizza too thin, carpaccio and meat with too much sauces, spicy and heavy...overall a good restaurant, but indeed not an excellent italian restaurant"
Great place for cozy Lunch and dinner,"One of my favourites in Singapore. The cozy little place is easy to get to and food and services is good!

You can just relax and have a good meal with friends! Add a bottle of wine to your relaxing meal!

Hassle free, quiet place for heart to heart talk with friends !!"
Nice ambiance,"Good menu options and nice ambiance. Accessible via MRT to Hillview station. Parking is easy especially on weekdays. Would recommend the pizza and braised lamb shank. Servers are not very attentive, diners just need to be patient."
Favourite away from the city,I have been a regular for much of 2017 the location I feel sets the stage in amongst lush greenery and the quietness of a residential area. the Wine selection is fabulous for this type of establishment and a great deal of food to either graze on or have a complete meal.....cold cuts and cheese are high on the list as well as a few of the pasta dishes. great value for Singapore
In praise of your staff Satish (not sure if correctly spelled),"Hi there! I haven't even eaten at your restaurant but I am in high praise of one of your staff Satish (again not sure if correctly spelled, apologies if I got it wrong) who took my reservation first about a week ago. I mentioned to him I would be celebrating my girlfriend's birthday there and was wondering whether a slice of cake could be arranged and he unassumingly told me that it could be.

Fast forward one week later. I called in to change my reservation from evening to lunch and he not only remembered my name just by hearing my voice but also kindly offered to arrange for the cake for my girlfriend with one of his fellow staff even though he won't be working during that shift. This is service at it's most dedicated excellence. I salute you Satish for going the extra mile and I look forward to dining at Wine Connection for a memorable experience with my girlfriend and also to meet you in person again soon Satish. :)

God Bless,
Andrew"
Peaceful experience!,Food here is awesome! Shidah our waitress was an excellent host! Very warm and friendly. She really provided us with excellent service and recommended what to order. We will definitely come back for the quality food and wonderful service:)
Horrible foods and lousy service !!!,"First time dine at this outlet, the Fish and chip is horrible, it taste like the fish did not defrost probably before it cook, we complaint to a Philippino waitress, her face is not happy and tell us will check but never come back to us. Cheese pizza is horrible, we only eat less then half. Will never come here again."
Once in a lifetime service exprerience.,"Interestingly, my wine glass didn't fall below the 50% mark. Those who knows how to appreciate wine out there, that was the highest calling ever. Join me. Shidah and Satish is a very good at service and friendly"
Another example of great food and service of the Wine Connection group,"I am very familiar with some of the Wine Connection outlets but this was my first time in the Wine Connection Bistro at HillV2. We had a Roast Beef Salad, Penne Carbonara, Lamb Shank and a Cheese Platter with a bottle of Negromaro wine.
As a summary ........ i will become a regular here!
Great food and wine, great service and atmosphere. Very very reasonable prices.
Excellent value for money.

See you soon!!!!!"
Good is good but slowwwwwwwww service,Finished my mains and my Mum’s sea bass is not served. Really slow service. Had to wait another 15 mins for the bill to come.
"Stick to wine, food was horrid","Their paella was an orange coloured pan of steamed rice. No char or flavour. The crab meat linguine was poorly cooked and stuck together.
Avoid."
"Once again, Utterly disappointed with the service","I got in at 6.34pm and have been waiting for my food till 7.45pm . *Officially bad listing this place*

We just had a bad encounter a couple of months back. We decided to give it a try as we like the food there. My girl & I ended up leaving the place without having our dinner. They only managed to serve my son & hubby's mains (sequence: my son finished his pasta then my hubby's steak was served). Sadly, our starter was no where to be found. Those diners who came in so much later was served with the starter and mains we ordered. .

No apologies and explanation from the waitress and manager. I was upset the way the manager replied to our query. He turned away before he could finish a conversation with us! .

I almost lost my cool to that bad service attitude. If you can't tolerate bad service attitude and proud behaviour, would recommend you not to go there."
Reservation mandatory,Great selection of wines at Singaporean prices (high). Perfect wine pairing made by the someller if you happen to need some help
Just Fine,"Just fine... Went there 1.5 hour before closing time, so not much to say. I think better to come there early evening, food is okay and wine is good..."
Foods and ambience are good. Need reservation.,Banger and mash is yummy. Parma ham and seafood appetizer are just ok. The wine is good. Overall the price is reasonable. Need to make reservation before coming here.
Cold Service,"came here at 10pm for some post dinner drinks. after getting seated, we waited for 15mins and still no one came to take our orders, so we tried to walk up to a server to place our orders. to our surprise, he said he will come find us later. some other odd service experiences would be the cold shrugs and unhappy expressions (when we thanked them for the receipt), or when they dripped some water on us, or when they eagerly poured out the wine from the bottle to fill up our glasses (nearly to the brim) so as to quickly clear up. have been a regular customer here and enjoyed the convenience of a trusted wine place near my home, but my most unsatisfying experience to date. would avoid this place for awhile till the service standards buck up!"
Fantastic quality set lunch at an affordable price,The food here is simply amazing. Had the set lunch with a friend and both of us enjoyed it tremendously. For $18 I had a Greek salad and chicken parmigiana. My friend had the mushroom soup and fish and chips. Will definitely be coming here often.
Thumbs up!,Great food with amazing serving sizes. Staff are attentive and friendly. Value for money. Definitely better than expected. We'll be back for more with the rest of the family!
Excellent,"Server Igor was very attentive :) Ambience is good, food is good. excellent! Will be back. Highly recommended."
Celebrating our 6th year wedding anniversary/nice place,Nice to be here again next time with the gangs. Nice place good ambiance and nice foods. We like the taste of layered eggplant & zucchini with feta.
Lovely food and ambiance,I came with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised! The food is top notch and I found lots of choices as a vegetarian.
"Good food, awesome service",The staff are very accommodating even if we arrived from our scheduled reservation time. They also accommodated our request for moving from one table to another. Food is delist. We will definitely come back here.
"Good ambience, food, and service!","I took my wife here for a surprise dinner, after getting our kids situated at home. Parking is around back and you MUST enjoy the use of the complimentary valet parking!!
We called ahead but found out reservations not needed after 7pm...got there at 7:30pm and were seated right away.
We found the ambience, food, and service (mainly by Zack) were excellent at Wjne Connection. The food menu and wine list were broad and can meet everyone's tastes.
I would highly recommend the appetisers, steaks, and red wines (chateau de lisse). Unfortunately my date does not drink, so I could not take the bottle of Bordeaux Malbec for only 38 SGD!
We enjoyed our evening greatly and left filled with great food and memories. We would definitely recommend this place and come back again soon!"
Satisfying dining experience,"The sides, mains and desserts here are amazing! Coupled with the good ambience, this is the perfect place for a satisfying dining experience."
Worst Reservation Handling Experience,"I called up Wine Connection Hillview 2 outlet a while ago ( @ Singapore Time 2135hrs on 24 April ) to make a reservation for coming Saturday (29 April) for 3 persons at 730pm. A male staff who perhaps can't converse in English made me repeat my surname (Chang) 8 times, mobile number more than 10 times till he gave up and simply said 'your reservation is confirmed'. I made him repeat my reservation details and realized he still got my name&number wrong! Only correct information is 3 persons on Saturday at 730pm. I thus requested him to get another staff to take over this call, since total 4 mins were wasted in incredible frustration. I could hear clearly the said male staff passed nasty remarks against me in his broken English before a female staff took over after a minute or so. After made me repeat all the information again, to my greatest surprise, she said 'we don't take reservation at 730pm on Saturdays..' Well, after much time and effort wasted, I decided to go another restaurant on Saturday since Wine Connection Hillview2 staff have spared no efforts to invite us out. Nevertheless, were I the owner of this Restaurant, I wouldn't keep such staff to go all the way to chase customers away!"
Dinning gathering,Been here couple of times. Foods quality and variety was good. Service level was good in general though could be better if the crowd is not big in the restaurant. Wine selection has improved over time. Great place to chill up in the evening. Booking is necessary for weekend.
Lunch with bff,"Nice ambient, good service and the food was great! Excellent service, despite the distance away from the city, but this place is worth the visit"
Cozy dinner,Ambience is good and is very suitable for couples looking for a place to sit down and chill. friendly and attentive staff.
Dining,The atmosphere is good and have a wonderful time and enjoy the food. The service is very good and the staff is very friendly
"decent food, and wine!","food here is pretty decent, but this place is mainly for wine lovers! has an area to shop for wholesale wine as well. good service, and nice relaxing vibes."
Repeat customer,"I love going to this place over and over again simply bcos the food, ambience and staff are awesome. The lava cake especially with vanilla ice cream was exceptionally wonderful."
Drinks at Wine Connection,"Cosy ambience, great value for money for drinks. Attentive service, waitress was knowledgable about the wines on the menu. 'Twas a great help. Amazing experience overall. Will definitely come back , no doubt."
Hillv2,"Great place, location & prices. food is good and prices are reasonable will surely return again. escpecially for dinner. ambienece is great"
Dinner at Wine Conn,"Cosy ambience, attentive service and great value for money for food and drinks! Always love coming back!"
Great Sunday Lunch,The food was good. The service was great. It was an overall pleasant lunch. We had the paella which was very tasty. The fish and chips and chicken parmigiana were well made.
Wine Connection,"I took a friend for her birthday dinner to Wine Connection at HILLV2. The service was horrible. Alrhough I had made reservations, we waited at the entrance for the staff to notice us. The staff did notice us standing there for quite sometime but chose to ignore us. Finally, we were seated. When I questioned one of the service staff, she replied it was because they are very busy. Being busy is not a valid reason to ignore customers. Then the waiter who took our order rambled through and was in a hurry and didnt seem interested. There was a floor manager who was walking about asking customers about how their dinner was. He asked the people on our left and on our right who were about 2 feet away from us. We must have looked so scary that he didnt dare to approach us or was too shy to ask us. Poor customer service. This will be the first and the last time we will dine at Wine Connection. I hope they look into their practices and put in place a system. Hopefully they will treat all customers equally. A true disappointment and over rated"
Excellent time!,"Great dinner with the family. The food and ambience were excellent. So was the service. We ordered the garden salad which was a tad sour for our palate. We informed the waiter who quickly replace it with another helping, this time the salad separated from the sauce. The apple crumble was enjoyable - it is THE recommended dessert. We will indeed return for another meal!"
Beautiful and romantic ambience,Staff were very helpful and service oriented. Food is also affordable and inexpensive so were the wines (bottle). Definitely will go back for more.
Puzzeled by serious difference between this location and other Wine Connection's other locations,"On the day of my visit this place seemed to be like a noisy children playground ! Disagreeable in what should be a ""bistro"" and ""wine"" place. Just for this prefer to go back to the other locations (e.g. Cuppage). Service awful , slow disorganized, serve one person and make other persons at the table wait 20 min at least ! Unacceptable.
Food came cold !! When brought this to the attention of a waiter , shocked by the blunt out of place reply he gave us ""no it's not cold"" !!! Shocking ! we told him in a different tone ""hold the plate (which was cold) and tell us if it is warm "" , more shocking this fellow put his index finger ON ONE OF THE SAUSAGES in our plate for a while to check the veracity of our complaint !!! Never seen , nor experienced this NOWHERE in the world (I am in my sixties ). This is utterly disgusting. Waiters should be trained very very properly before being allowed to serve customers."
Good recommendation,Jerrick has good knowledge when it comes to wine and is very helpful. Will come back again. Wide selection of wine.
Nice pasta,Great service. Knowledgeable staff and nice ambience. Mi like the idea that this place is quiet and the server jerriek is really attentive and convinced us to try the wine which turned out great
Extremely slow service,Extremely slow service. Food served was hardly warm. I can see that your service crew are overwhelmed. They were literally running from table to table. This is clearly a management issue.
Needs improvement to maintain high ranking Hill V branch,The food is good. But the way it is serve is very bad. 2 of us have spaghetti and 1 ordered steak. Steaks comes 10min after the spaghetti. This is embarrassing for the host as the guest have to wait to begin eating. The same desert we ordered 2 apple crumble and 1 come out and the other few min later. The same desert but come out different time. Complained and as usual they have excuse saying it's the way they serve.
Good food and service,"I came upon the review for Wine Connection Bistro on Tripadvisor while looking for idea of where to go for dinner. So we decided to give it a try. The restaurant at first glance was that it was quite cozy and not too noisy.

We have tried quite a bit of the menu, and most items are pretty decent. The pizza and steak is pretty good. Even my young son enjoys the Spaghetti Bolognese and would finish every morsel of it even though it is a pretty decent sized serving.

The selection of wine is pretty decent as well, especially since they have their own wine store next to the restaurant.

We have since been back to the restaurant many times, and we are always greeted and served by friendly staffs.

The restaurant is suitable for a nice dinner among friends or family."
Good for a casual family meal,"This is a nice resturant for a family outing with good choices of pizza, pasta and mains. Prices are very reasonable from $13 onwards for pizza and pasta. They also service set lunches from $18 that comes with a main and salad or soup. Service is fast and they still serve water for free! The place can get crowded but they don't linger, so your wait should not be too long. The only ""con"" about this place is the parking on weekends!"
Christmas lunch,Good ambiance and services. We ordered pizzas which is quite good. My Daughter ordered chorizo fettuccini which she found superb.
Chill week night,excellent service and value for money prices especially with wine. cosy ambience. away form the bustle of the city
"Good service, great value wines","I have been to all the wine connection branches in Singapore and in my opinion the hillview one is the best in terms of service. Menu and range of wine is more or less the same in all branches. Although the hillview branch is a bit out of the way, the ambience and service definitely makes up for it. Look out for their monthly wine deals. Great place to hang out with friends."
Customer service ok but not very experienced,I had a gathering at this place w my old friends- maybe there were too many of us but I feel service crew keep mixing up our orders from ordering to serving. But overall atmosphere is nice and a good place to chillax.
Family dinner,"Went with the family for a Sunday night dinner ,ordered steak, pasta and soup. The menu is not modern or innovative but traditional French all well cooked."
Wonderful service,"Wanted to have a peaceful dinner with a glass of wine . Stepped inside wine connection expecting it's not gonna be busy as it was Monday . But the place was quite busy . Even though they has very less staff they were very attentive. The service was so fast and the food and drinks came very fast as

Have to mention about the manager Jonalyn and staff Satish , they were very attentive and gave a great service . The water was topped up every time when the glass was empty. The food was so nice the Caesar salad is highly recommended if you wanna start with a salad . The Zinfandel by the glass was really worth for the price. Over all it's a place where you can have a great service and tasty food at very reasonable price"
Birthday celebration,They've recently changed their menu and there's a lot more variety! The seafood bowl was really good. I also recommend the assorted platter to go with the wine. The service staff were very attentive and friendly as well.
Nothing like it!,I visited this restaurant twice when I was in Singapore. Couldn't try everything in the menu. I recommend the cheese platter along with the wine. Garlic prawns are good as starters and pasta is a must try. Beautiful and lively ambience. Recommended.
Very nice,"Popped in on the off chance and glad we did. Food was excellent and reasonably priced. We had a bottle of proseco too which was also very well priced. There were new waiting staff being trained that day and they were all lovely, friendly and rounded off a very nice dining experience. I will use again for sure."
Birthday Celebration!,Great service! Wine knowledge established with the effort to connect to customers. Recommended for a relaxed chill.
-,"What is attractive is the good lighting and ambience, coupled with hearty food at affordable prices."
The ambience of the place is really calming,The food was in appropriate portions and the servers are really professional. Servers will check in with you to enquirer if you have any other needs.
Family gathering,The food was not bad and service exemplary. The servers were gracious enough to change us to another table when we had more people joining us. I would recommend trying the Apple crumble as it came out warm like it should! My Uncle and cousins enjoyed the food here!
Gathering with friends,"Unanimous agreement that the food was delicious and the portions were generous. The burrata was tasty while the Gambas were tantalising and fresh. For main course, the sirloin steak and the pork chop won hands down. Ended off with Creme burlee (didn't really enjoy it) but the lava cake saved dessert. Service was impeccable."
