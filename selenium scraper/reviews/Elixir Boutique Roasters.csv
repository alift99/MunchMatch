Rude waiters,"The staff was extremely rude at our visit. Even though we had queued for 20 minutes, we simply walked out. Have ordered in before via delivery, so we know their food is good, but I will not stand for rudeness."
Wasn’t blown away,"Came here for brunch and it was alright. Coffee wasn’t up our alley, milk texturing is not silky. The food wasn’t bad but it is typical cafe food. Also gotta leave 45 mins after your last dish is served."
Simple quick food and nice coffee,Simple quick food and nice coffee Had breakfast here- eggs were delicious and served quickly. Some of the staff extremely friendly and very accommodating with children.
Late brunch,"Went in for a late brunch with my friend. Their coffee is full bodied and strong the way I like it. Breakfast items has all the usual with bacon, eggs sausages. The unsual is this portion I ordered with is a shakshouka. Essentially Greek cheese with poached eggs and semi sweet. Interesting to me. Others in the lunch menu also have local flavors like Rendang. I would have gotten that if not for the fact it is the first meal of the day and it might be too much. Social distancing measures in place. Sanitizers in place."
Brunch place near botanic gardens,Very conveniently located near botanic gardens. I had brunch before the circuit breaker some time in the afternoon. Generous portions for the brunch set. Give it a try if u are near botanic gardens. The sausage in the brunch set is good
Lunch,"Got recommended this charming place and visited before the start of circuit breaker. The atmosphere was nice and calming, a great place to visit after a walk at Botanic Gardens which is nearby. I ordered the Wagyu Beef Cheek Rendang which was a great dish with succulent beef and flavourful rice. There was also a side of keropok which is was a tasty addition to the meal. Would love to visit again."
Hearty brunch,"Vistited this place before the start of circuit breaker; nice atmosphere with very good food! I ordered the Breakfast Works and the scrambled eggs were to die for; amazing creamy eggs and overall hearty dish. The atmosphere was nice and elegant, a great place to visit with friends and family and only a short walk from Botanic Gardens MRT.
Would love to visit again soon!"
good coffee,"i went there for breakfast as serene centre is more crowded at lunchtime. the coffee was nice and strong, the way I like it. for sure I will go back for coffee!"
Pleasant dining experience,"Visited Elixir Boutique for the first time and I must say that I really love the place. The staff was friendly and the ambience was nice. More importantly, the food turned out great! I ordered The Breakfast Works and my friend ordered the creme brulee! We finished the meal with 2 cups of coffee with latte art on it. Lovely place."
Great ambience & food,"Ordered the Smoked Shimeiji Mushroom &Ricotta at Elixir Boutique Roasters. The food came in a generous portion and service was prompt. The dish itself was very rich, creamy and substantial. Would definitely recommend it and come back again myself :)"
Excellent food and friendly staff,"Tried The Breakfast Works, which is made up of a safe yet wide variety of premium ingredients that is hard to disappoint. The scrambled eggs particularly exceeded my expectations, as they were soft and fluffy. Despite visiting during a peak brunch hour on a saturday morning, service was great and the food arrived without delays."
A little bit of everything,"2 weeks ago, I visited Elixir Boutique Roasters and their breakfast platter is just amazing. The scrambled eggs are textbook level, soft and just a little runny. The brioche tastes slightly sweet, and is toasted to that optimal spot where it's crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. The veggies taste fresh, and salt from the meats amplifies that freshness. The whole dish is a brilliant bland of all tastes and colors, a great way to energize your day.

The temperature of the vanilla latte I ordered is well-handled that I was able to sip it as soon as it came to me.

The setting of the place is great too, it receives just enough sunlight to make you feel refreshed without becoming too hot.
If you decide to visit the Botanic Gardens in the morning, be sure to check this place out!

p.s. the platter is big enough to feed 2 adults; so, if you are only there for breakfast, order with caution"
Elixir boutique roasters,"Good food and good ambience, enjoyed the truffle eggs prosciutto and the hot chocolate! Really nice place to chill at"
Great options for vegetarian dishes!,"I ordered the Grilled Halloumi, Truffle Fries and Cold Brew Iced Tea (the seasonal was a black tea with something citrusy?). Portions were good for a filling brunch session, and tea was superb =) Our photos definitely don't do the food justice!
Atmosphere was chill enough to have a pleasant conversation. Overall would recommend for anyone looking to spend a nice morning/afternoon unwinding with a good cuppa."
Brunch Idea,"Surprisingly good food! Ordered the Wagyu Beef cheek rendang today at ELIXIR. It was well-cooked and you can just taste the flavourful rendang. The blue rice was also super tasty(As an ethnic Chinese, I don't use this lightly)!"
Chill Place,"A place with amazing ambiance, chill vibes and good food. The service was excellent and the staff was warm and friendly. I would totally recommend coming here for a quick meal or even to study while enjoying a cup of coffee. I tried the Duck Cassoulet and it tastes absolutely amazing, I would totally recommend if you want a light meal."
Great food,My partner and I had a hearty breakfast this morning. We ordered the Truffle Eggs Prosciutto and Breakfast Works which seem to be popular choices among customers. The food was appetising and filling. There was also a generous portion of eggs (I love eggs!!!). Would love to be back to try their Brûlée French Toast :-)
"Calming Ambience, Savoury Food","If you're looking for a scenic, quiet spot to take the edge off after a hectic week, Elixir is the place to be.

A friend and I ordered The Breakfast Works and Truffle Eggs Prosciutto and was pleasantly surprised how well the truffle oil was mixed in with the eggs. The scent of truffle oil came right through once we sliced into the toast. Both dishes lean towards savoury and are value for money, we almost couldn't finish as the portions were very generous. Coffee here is great too, the caffeine doesn't come on too strong and the coffee art is beautiful. Service is quick and the staff are responsive. If you're lucky, you may even come across some furry friends as some patrons may bring their pets.

A wonderful lunch spot overall!"

My experience,Food was amazing and so was the music. Really enjoyed myself and felt really relaxed. Friendly staff too

Amazing experience! 10/10,Amazing experience! The Truffles eggs prosciutto was simply amazing! Love it! Generous portion! I’ll highly recommend it!
Delicious food and great atmosphere!,"I had a really good catch up with a friend at this brunch spot. The food was delicious -- totally Instagram-worthy, and the place was a really good spot to spend an early afternoon chatting away. The service took quite a while though, and it is quite a popular spot, so it would be best to plan ahead!"
A great spot for brunch!,"The food was amazing! We tried their truffle fries, scrambled eggs and french toast, the french toast being the best of three. It was decadent though the waiting time for the dish was a bit long. The store had good ambiance, boasting a clean and modern look. I recommend this place for friends and families as it has quite a casual feel. A great spot for brunch!"
Cozy brunch place with great food,"My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed their amazing french toast, eggs, and truffle fries. The ambience and stylish decor was perfect for a cozy brunch and get-together, and made us feel right at home. The staff were patient and friendly with us, and really made our experience all the better."
Cozy!,I loved the dim lighting and leisurely vibes in there. The food was also terrific. It was my first time eating a Western breakfast and Turkish eggs in a while and I really enjoyed it a lot. Definitely a good place to slow down a bit and take a rest
Wonderful Food and Ambience,"The store has comfortable lighting and atmosphere for hanging out with friends for a chat, and the staff explained the inquiries regarding the menu well too. The Breakfast Work that I ate has nice fluffy eggs and juicy sausages. Would definitely recommend people to come by!"
Breakfast,"The servings are generous and the location is ideal for quiet meetings and discussions.Definitely a step up from the western breakfast offerings at Holland Village. We had Sourdough Toast & Eggs, with a helping of bacon on the side, and my daughter had the Brulee French Toast which she tried to finish."
hearty breakfast,"The food came in a huge serving, and was very filling ! I ordered the breakfast wok and truffle fries while my friend ordered the truffle egg prosciutto. The bread was really well toasted and buttered and the truffle fries was really savoury and would definitely recommend !"
Filling and satisfying,Ordered breakfast works and it was so filling. Loved the sausages especially. Ordered truffle fries as well and it was awesome. Very very filling and satisfying.
Good food and good vibes near botanic gardens,"The scrambled eggs came in a big portion and was soft and delectable. The choice of sausage was great and the salad (aragula/rocket) was refreshing. To top it off, the drinks had latte art (swans?) which was a pleasant surprise. We would certainly return to try the other items on the menu!"
Huge portion,"Decided to treat myself to Truffle Egg Prosciutto for lunch with my friend, and it turned out to be a delightful and filling meal. The eggs and ham went well with the brioche and truffle oil. The richness of the meal was complemented by the English breakfast tea. My friend and I cleaned our plates and left the store very satisfied. The ambiance of the store was very cosy, and the staff were very friendly. Would definitely be popping by again with more friends!"
Great Brunch - Large Portions,"Elixir Boutique Roaster is an amazing location for friends to have a chill get-together! It was very conducive for friends to catch-up over great food.

The Breakfast Works set was also extremely well prepared and is a great value for money. The scrambled eggs deserve a special mention too and it complemented the other dishes of the set very well!

The cosy atmosphere and helpful staff topped off this great experience too!

Will definitely come back again!"
Good coffee,Nice alfesco dine-in with good food and great coffee. Ambience was cosy and the staff were friendly!
"Great food, great location!","Ooh fancy glasses :D good first impression
@elixir.boutiqueroasters
Overall i give the place a perfect 5/7
Most importantly, the food actually filled the plate. None of this big plate small food bullstuff
I appreciate the JoJo reference in the menu, also the most badass sounding cocktail ever
I've never chamomile tea before, but I can confirm that the tea here is made out of tea
Also TIL what a 'market leaf' is"
Great Saturday Breakfast,"Great food, great service, great experience. Highly recommended for a casual day out with its relaxing ambience. Especially loved the aesthetic presentation of food (perfect for photo-taking) and the chamomile tea!"
Class Act,"Woke up early on a Saturday to try out the brunch here and I was really enjoyed dining there!

Didn’t have to wait too long for the food too, around 20-25mins. I ordered the Turkish Eggs, something I’ve never tried before. The spiced yogurt was interesting and I thought the sourdough bread was good. Portions was large too! Would definitely recommend others to try this place out :+1:"
To-go Place for Brunch along Bukit Timah,"Generous portion of Turkish Eggs that came with sourdough bread and salmon but it was too sour for my liking. However, the yogurt complemented well with the crispy bread!

This restaurant is also strategically located a few minutes walk from Botanic Gardens MRT and the service staff was friendly."
One of the Best Brunches in Bukit Timah!,"Had the The Breakfast Works - The scrambled eggs were a fairly generous portion the brioche was toasted to perfection!

Creme Brulee french toast was one of the best I've ever had! Just the right amount of crunch and fluff from the brioche. And a big helping of the freshest fruits too!"
Good food good mood,"Came here on the Sunday for some brunch time with the bestie. Elixir is actually the “day version” of Fat Belly, that serves amazing flat iron steak. With lush greeneries around the Botanic Gardens precinct, it sets the mood for a refreshing Sunday morning brunch.

The Breakfast Works is the elixir to fixing the grumpy early morning moods. The portion was generous, topped off with the fluffiest scrambled eggs ever!!

Brûlée French Toast was great, loved the crunchy layer of brûlée on top of the toast which added an edge to the texture.

Too bad I didn’t have enough stomach space to eat more, if not I would’ve ordered the Truffle Eggs Prosciutto. Oh well, till next time!"
Elixir boutique,"Went down for brunch at Elixir boutique last weekend and it definitely lived up to my expectations. The place was still kind of empty at 9.30am but during our meal, it became full.
I ordered the scrambled eggs prosciutto with toast and the truffle taste was just right, not too over powering. The eggs were cooked just right, very fluffy. The dish was a delight.
The truffle fries to share was amazing as well.
Will definitely come back for more!"
Very nice eggs! Had brunch,Very nice eggs! Had brunch at this place and it was really nice. We ordered truffle toast and requested for soy milk and he restaurant was so kind to create soy milk drink that was only available as an add on to the normal brewed coffee/tea. Must eat the eggs it is mostly as creamy as Hong Kong’s Australian dairy farm!
Cafe Visit,"Location is good, easy to find.
Felt that the food is little overpriced though.

Tried both the Carbonara with Onsen Egg and The Breakfast Works.

The carbonara portion is pretty good, but taste turns cloying after a few mouthful.
Waiting time for the food is pretty long as well.

The breakfast platter, on the other hand, is delicious! With real potatoes as wedges! Had a varieties of dishes on the plate too.
However, waiting time is a bit too long (about 45 mins). So by the time the food is served, the appetite were gone."
BEST SCRAMBLED EGG FOR BRUNCH,"A small but great ambience for brunch. Had the best scrambled egg with toast, will be back for more! Highly recommend getting the scrambled egg, it’s really done to perfection."
Best food. Huge Serving,"The Carbonara with Onsen Eggs is the best Carbonara I've ever eaten. The Breakfast Work serving is humongous, it make sure that you're full enough from this breakfast to work the full day."
Delicious brunch with generous portions,"The Onsen Egg Carbonara is a must-try and is deliciously creamy! I also had the Breakfast Works which came with HUGE portions of toast, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, wedges and smoked salmon. Insanely satisfying brunch and will be back again!! 😍"
Breakfast,"Love the coffee and runny scrambled eggs 😍 place was nice and quiet in the early morning, really enjoyed my breakfast"
Filling and yummy brunch!,A stone throw from nearest train station. A good selection of brunch. Filling yummy brunch with big portions! Very worth it! Go try it now! Will definitely visit again soon!
"Great food, generous portions",Had a lovely brunch today - smoked mushrooms & home made ricotta was delicious and something different from the usual brunch fare. Price is affordable and portions are generous! Do also check out their coffee :)
Lovely Breakfast Place in Serene Center,"Stumbled upon this cosy little brunch corner tucked away in Serene center when I wanted to grab a hearty breakfast with my Boyfriend before work. We were both really impressed by the aromatic coffee and the portions were really generous. The Breakfast Works was really yummy with the perfectly buttery scrambled egg and soft brioche toast!

If you’re feeling a little peckish, the Truffle Eggs Prosciutto is an equally excellent choice.

Yummy!"
Brunch over the weekends,"Met up with a friend over brunch at elixir over the weekends at elixir and had the truffle eggs prosciutto. Even thou i consider myself a big eater, their servings were huge and filled me up.
The eggs were very fluffy and was really surprised with the amount of truffle flavour in the eggs. The prosciutto was nice and not overly salty which really complimented the eggs nicely.
Overall had a great time there and will go back there again if i am in the neighborhood."
Amazing Breakfast/Brunch,Amazing place for an amazing weekend breakfast experience. Had their Breakfast Works coupled with their Lemon Mint Tea. The tea complemented the hearty breakfast well and it felt simply amazing. Fair warning; you need a hearty appetite to stomach their generous portions.
Truffle egg prosciutto,"The ham had a nice texture, and was very flavourful. The egg was also very well done, not too watery or hard. They were generous with the toast, it’s quite thick! It was a good order!"
Carbonara w Onsen Egg & Mocha,"I had the Carbonara with Onsen Egg ($18) and Mocha ($5.50). Really enjoyed the carbonara , it was creamy but not overwhelming. They were really generous with their portions and the service staff was really friendly. Will definitely come back again!"
"Really nice and large portions, perfect for weekends!","Tried Elixir on a weekend for early brunch, was really impressed by their large portions and overall good quality. The bread from the breakfast platter and French toast was really good, and the coffee was also of good quality. Was really full with just one dish per person."
Sunday breakfast at Elixir!,"Perfect place for a lazy, cosy Sunday breakfast :') we had the breakfast works (large generous portions with the most flavourful sausage) and the Brulee French toast topped with the juciest and freshest fruits.

I could tell that Elixir had top notch ingredients and took pride in what they were making. Even to the finest details like the fruits, they were so sweet and lovely I really appreciated that.

Already eyeing the blue pea beef rendang for lunch the next time I come here!"
Three cheers for elixir!,"Cozy stylish cafe, botanic gardens being the nearest mrt! The portions were generous and the food was tasty. Great place for couples and small groups.

The big breakfast was a classic o’ dish with fluffy toast, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, bacon, sausage and potato wedges.

What really stood out for me was the French toast. They caramelized a side of the French toast and topped it off with fresh berries! The toast was really fluffy too. Would head back for that!

Extra bonus of latte art :D"
A Brunch Gem!!,"During my visit to Elixir my girlfriend and I ordered The Breakfast Works and the Brulee French Toast. The Breakfast Works really gave us the works. The plate was brimmed, full of classic breakfast goodness. From tasty smoked salmon to juicy and fresh grilled tomatoes, fluffy toasts, succulent and juicy sausages, well-seasoned potato wedges, crispy bacon and creamy and frothy scrambled eggs that Gordon Ramsay would probably approve of. There was no weak link in the dish. Everything was perfect in their own right and came together to make the perfect breakfast platter. if you're at the Elixir I highly recommend you get the Breakfast Works, but I warn you, best come with a big appetite, it isn't for small eaters. The Brulee French Toast was a sweet treat to the eyes as much as it was a treat for the mouth. The French toast was so beautifully plated with an assortment of berries and cream on the side. The toast itself was something I have never seen before. Traditionally the bread was coated with eggs and goes into the pan. The Brulee French toast, as the same suggest, has a special layer of hardened, caramelised coating similar to the toppings on a crème Brule which gave the toast an extra texture element to it in addition to the fragrant egg coating that French toast had. It was so unique and tasted so good. Kudos to whoever thought of such a dish as the Brulee French toast!"
Great Brunch Place with Amazing Portion!,My favourite had to the eggs from The Breakfast Work and the Truffle Fries! The portion were generous and was enough to serve 2! If you are looking for something on the sweeter side would definitely recommend the Brûlée French Toast! Overall would come back again with friends to share more main ◡̈
Elixir Review,"The food was really nice. The portion for the breakfast is super huge and definitely worth for it’s price. My favorite dish was the Brûlée French Toast, it has a thin layer melted sugar that gives it a crunchy taste, super good if you love to have a sweet dessert for breakfast/lunch."
Duck done cassoulet style!,"Previously I gave the Beef Rendang a shot, and now I'm back for more. This time I tried the duck cassoulet. A rich and flavourful duck in tomato laid underneath a thick layer of pancetta. Pretty appetizing for lunch!"
Silky! Buttery! What more could I ask for?,"An excellent take on the classics! Silky truffled scrambled eggs paired with the prosciutto, laid on a thick brioche toast. Would definitely be back for more."
Excellent place for relaxing weekend brunch,"Coffee is fantastic. Food is great! Portions are hearty. The scramble eggs are very creamy and satisfying. I love the brioche bread, buttery and delicious. The interior is very chic, has a very chill vibe. Good place for a relaxing weekend brunch."
Great food and cozy cafe for brunch,"The Truffle Egg Prosciutto would be a strong contender for an umami contest, if there ever is one. Sitting on top of a thick slice of brioche, the generous slices of prosciutto pairs really well with creamy scrambled eggs and shaved truffles.

Also enjoyed the duck cassoulet with sourdough. The duck leg confit was tender and went really well with the stew.

Apart from the food, the cozy environment also makes for a nice place to relax over a cuppa.

Will definitely visit this place again!"
Lovely brunch location and food,"A cozy brunch location and the mocha was well prepared to my liking. The Duck Cassoulet with Sourdough is the perfect comfort food if you do not feel like having something sweet that day. We also ordered the Truffle Scrambled Prosciutto Toast, a must have if you visit."
"Great coffee, lovely brunch","Awesome coffee, robust and nutty, even without sugar its great! The truffle broche is light and fluffy, presented beautifully with a rose crafted with ham. A must try!"
Smoked Mushroom and ricotta,"The toast and the hot chocolate were delicious. Their smoked mushroom toast is really earthy and unique.
Their hot chocolate is nice for me as its really chocolaty and perfect to my liking.

The service is good and the environment is perfect for studying and working. Its quiet and not crowded during lunch time. The music is also not very loud. It is really peaceful eating and reading there.

The price is alright too for a cafe that is at a high end location."
Breakfast and coffee hangout,"Had their turkish breakfast for brunch. Came with salmon, turkish styled eggs and sough dough bread. Loved how crispy the toast was! Paired my brunch with a cup of mocha latte and I really enjoyed it!

My friend ordered the smoked mushroom with toast & I really loved how the toast tasted! It was fluffy & I would totally just eat it by itself!

Cafe was cosy, with both outdoors & indoors seating. Staff was quick to attend to my friend and I. I would recommend business partners here to discuss plans as it was not too noisy or crowded."
Best coffee I’ve had in a long while.,"Love the coffee, and the fact that the nosh here is so unusual. The Turkish eggs with yoghurt dukkah is just what I needed after a particularly big dinner the night before. Am waiting to go back to try the very photogenic brûlée French toast next!"
Sunday Brunch,"Very satisfied with ""The Breakfast Work"". It has many items like scramble egg, smoke salmon, sausage etc and my favourite wild rocket. The aroma of the coffee is unforgettable 😀"
Worth a visit,"Had a nice brunch on a Saturday morning. Ordered Turkish eggs which didn’t suit my palette as it was more on the sour side and had other herbs to it. However the bread that came with it was delish! Haha

I do like the coffee and would certainly come back here to try other dishes."
Chill and relaxing breakfast spot,"Nice and relaxing place for breakfast, service was quick and food portions were generous. Had ""The breakfast works"" and would really recommend it for anyone that loves a scrumptious breakfast!"
Lovely morning brunch,"This mains called ""The Breakfast Works"" is HUGE and enough to feed two. Decently done scrambled eggs, streaky bacons, herb sausage, smoke salmon and griddled plum tomatoes blend perfectly well with the toast and coffee. I was told that the coffee beans were specially blended and roasted by the owner/ chef. Lovely coffee to start the morning!"
The Breakfast Works and Ice Mocha,"Dropped by for breakfast here after a walk at Botanic Gardens on Sunday. It has a lovely, cozy ambience and the staff are very helpful and attentive as well.

Ordered The Breakfast Works and Ice Mocha. Wait time was around 8 to 10 minutes.

The Breakfast Works is a really generous serving of grilled bacon slab, kurobuta sausage, scrambled eggs, rocket leaves, potato wedges, grilled tomato and brioche toast. The bacon slab was a tad chewy but well-seasoned. The kurobuta sausage was amazing, great flavor, great texture, exactly what I want in a sausage. Scrambled eggs were nicely done; the rocket leaves pair really well with the meat. Overall a pretty big and satisfying meal.

The Mocha (Ice) was well made. Fragrant, enjoyable and the barista accounted for the ice melting so it didn’t lose much flavor even after it melted. The chocolate sauce was a nice touch as it was balanced pretty well and didn’t make the coffee too sweet. I’d love to come back and try their other coffees."
Great breakfast,"Having a truffle eggs prosciutto was creamy scrambled eggs on a thick toasted brioche with shaved truffle and parma ham. Great portion and great service. Also, hot chocolate to go with such all-day breakfast made it all so more warmer. Also tried the carbonara with onsen egg my friend ordered."
Saturday chill out,"Visited for brunch with a friend.. this place has a chill ambiance with the best french toast I've ever had! Portions were really huge, great for sharing. Staff was also approachable and friendly (:"
Great food at Serene centre!,My Best Friend and I went there for an early breakfast. The potion is quite big for 1 and so we shared. I love how they decorated the sweet toast. Would be back for more again. :)
Relaxing brunch,"Went for a brunch with my partner, upon reaching i can feel that the atmosphere very chilling and relaxing. Duck confit was de-boned and tender soft, however personally i felt that the serving not very filling for me."
Brunch,"My partner and I got a Truffle egg prosciutto and Duck Cassoulet to share. The truffle scrambled eggs was creamy and light and it really went well with the fresh parma ham and toast. I really liked how the flavours come together and enjoyed it.
The portion of duck was rather small but the Cannelloni bean stew was quite tasty with the pairing of sourdough. I had Iced chocolate which tasted more like chocolate milk but it was refreshing. The ambience was good and relaxing."
Perfect for a lazy Sunday brunch,"Had a perfect Sunday brunch with a really thicccc cut of brioche, fluffy eggs and a genorous portion of proscuitto! To top it all off, the atmosphere here was super cosy with a lazy Sunday morning vibe."
Lovely Breakfast,"Breakfast was served promptly, friendly service and to add on, the ambience was really cozy and chill! Food wise is pretty westernised as well as the Latte. The hot choc ain't bad too (:"
Scrambled eggs from heaven,"they serve a full breakfast till 4pm! Which is great for a weekend sleep in. The scrambled eggs that come with the full breakfast are not to be missed. We were recommended the French toast which was a feat in itself, definitely not to be missed!"
Super satisfying brunch!,"Super good brunch food at Elixir Boutique Roasters! :) One of my favourites was the Brûlée French Toast! The plating is so gorgeous and it tastes even better than it looks. The Breakfast Works was really delicious too with soft fluffy scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, juicy sausages and smoked salmon.

We also ordered a side of Truffle fries to share along with the two mains. I was pleasantly surprised at how affordable Elixir's Truffle Fries are, without compromising its taste! The fries were crispy with clear hints of truffle oil and topped off with shaved parmesan on top. It was super addictive and I wish I had more stomach space to order another side of truffle fries! Overall, Elixir Boutique Roasters is a perfect place to relax and enjoy a sumptuous brunch while catching up with friends. Would definitely bring my family and friends to Elixir to try out other dishes on the menu next time! :)"
Satisfied,"Had the Carbonara with Onsen Egg along with a cup of iced vanilla latte. Carbonara was great and despite not having any cream, the parmigiano reggiano and onset egg tied the dish nicely together. Serving portion was more than enough to fill an average appetite. Iced latte was good as well."
Generous portions of delicious brunch,"Coming here for brunch was a really good start to my day. The food was savoury and left me very full after I was done, and paired my main dishes with a side of fries and some soothing coffee. Loved it!"
Good morning vibes,"The dish “The Breakfast Works” indeed works wonder for a good breakfast. And since it is located near Botanic Gardens, I recommend that patrons can visit the elixir boutique roasters before/ after a nice morning walk"
Need a reason for 2nd visit...,"Maybe we had read all the good reviews and went with high expectation.

Not clear if cafe takes reservation. We called, no answer. We decided to make our way to cafe. Cafe was crowded but bar seats were available. Was told any sort of food would take 45min wait. Since it was our first time we decided to wait. The wait wasnt too bad, it was roughly 30min. We moved from bar to outside seating. At that point, the seats outside were already half cleared and available. When another customer came, we overheard staff telling customer about half hour wait for all food... not too sure at this point if the was necessary since half the tables were empty.

The coffee came, nicely executed.

Next came the beef cheek rendang, our first reaction at the appearance was meh, since we saw all the photos and writeup. Flavour of the rendang was thumbs up, but it was tough using a fork and spoon to separate the meat... the difference could be due to the thickness of the tendon binding the cut. Hub commented maybe the reviews and photos had us come with high expectation of the dish.

The halloumi dish we ordered was beautifully executed. We enjoyed to the last mouthful... a light olive drizzle, some almond and spice sprinkles over the kale.

The food was tasty overall. But I need a good reason to come back again for brunch/lunch... the parking? The wait for food? The beef cheek rendang which we came for?"
Who said brunch is reserved for Sundays?😎,How my Mon morning RIGHT BEFORE CLASS looked: some dope ass beef cheek rendang on coconut blue pea grains & my fav french toast which they did above and beyond justice to can I just add how reasonable the prices are for the quality? think I just found a new go-to bfast spot and a Monday blues-free formula hehe
Great food and service,"Adored the brûléed french toast in front so much I didn’t think anything else could top it, well, until the other main came along. Not just any rendang but fall-off-the-bone beef CHEEK rendang on pretty blue grains that’s not just for the aesthetics but packed the coconut blue pea fragrance it promised not a fan of sunny side ups but the awesome peeps thr kindly switched it up into my fav scrambled eggs for me, which, by the way, they also perfected"
Decent Brunch,Nice cafe with friendly counter staff. Loved the scrambled eggs. Bacon Slab too tough for my liking. Glad that I can customize my food as I'm on a Low carb diet.
Tasty and very affordable brunch!,"Had a wonderful brunch at Elixir Boutique Roasters! Tried their iced tea and it was just the right amount of sweetness coupled with a refreshing aroma - a great way to start my weekend! Decided to try their Duck Cassoulet, I must say it was very well done; tender duck meat (deboned i must add) in a very delicious and sharp tomato-based cannelloni stew. Snagged seats at the bar where it wasn't too squeezy at around 11am and got to see the barista handle the drinks so that was cool!

Loved it and will be back for more!"
Overall decent experience.,Overall decent brunch with a generous portion and fluffy eggs. Coffee was strong and well proportioned.
Great for brunch!,"Had a great meal at Elixir today! Their truffled eggs toast was delicious and aromatic, and it definitely gave me the energy boost i needed for the morning. The portion was really generous as well, and definitely well worth the price.

Would recommend for a great brunch experience, especially with family or friends!"
Cosy Morning coffee with delectable fair.,"Lovely cosy spot with good in house roasted coffee. Brunch was really appetising, their mains well crafted and delicious. The Brulee Toast was nicely balanced and beautiful done up. The Truffle Eggs Prosciutto was delicate and flavorful. Great for a midday chill out ☺️ (and coffee cocktails!)"
Great Brunch!,"Enjoyed a later morning brunch at Elixir. Good Mocha, great Brûlée French Toast, and an amazing Truffle Eggs Proscuitto. Thank you!"
Great experience!,"Fat Belly at night; Elixir Boutique Coffee in the day. I was surprised to find out that both Elixir and Fat Belly shared the same establishment, albeit at different timings. I've always been a sucker for good brunch food, but the food here was really something else.

Scrambled eggs and prosciutto ham sit upon a fluffy brioche toast in Elixir's Truffle Eggs Prosciutto dish. The eggs were silky and creamy, and the prosciutto's flavour complemented the eggs really well. The buttered brioche toast was lightly sweet and had wonderful mouthfeel, with a cripsy crust but fluffy insides.

However, the star of the brunch had to be the Brulée French Toast. Decorated with fresh fruits and flowers, the Brulée French Toast was not only aesthetically pleasing to the eyes, but incredibly delicious as well. Every bite was greeted with the slightly burnt fragrance of caramelized sugar, the fluffy toast, and the different flavours of the various fruits. It truly was a beautiful dish.

Overall, I had a great time at Elixir Boutique Roasters. Would love to come back again to try more of their dishes."
Halloumi Salad,"Tried their halloumi salad - it was a grilled slab of cheese along with some grilled veges which were so tasty!! I’m not usually a huge fan of scallions nor baby corn, but these were amazing!! The tahini aioli paired very well too. Every component came together so well but each also being so flavourful on its own.

The bar seats were quite cosy and we got to see our drinks being made in front of us. The staff were also super friendly which makes the whole meal very pleasant!"
Interesting and attractive menu,"Great location, peaceful vibes in the area. Very interesting and attractive menu. Had my first try of grilled halloumi and it was really nice though I am not fond of cheese! The toasted bread is soft and nicely buttered. Generous serving of smoked salmon. The yoghurt is very sour."
Nice cafe and nice interior!,"Came here for lunch with a friend and we tried their mains! I ordered the duck cassoulet and my friend got the carbonara. The duck cassoulet was really tasty, had a lot of meat in at and was definitely substantial. The meat was really sweet as well. Came with some sourdough bread and a side of salad. The salad was really special, was halfway between veggie chips and salad, sprinkled with some salt. Really yummy!
Not a coffee person, so sadly didn't try the coffee. Instead, my friend and I shared a pot of tea which was great and really value for money! I would recommend it :)"
:),Good service and great ambience. Liked the fragrant earl grey tea. The carbonara with onsen egg had an interesting presentation with crispy fried bacon.
