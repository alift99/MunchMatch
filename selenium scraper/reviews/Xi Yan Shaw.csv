Good Food,"My family went there for lunch two days ago to celebrate my sis. birthday. Wow, what a surprise. Ordered 10 dishes. Food was just awesome. Just want to say that the roast pepper chicken a bit tough, could be better but overall we did enjoy the food. Mum esp. commented the abacus seed has lots of flavour and ingredients , abacus seeds which came in not so many pieces were really soft ! Prawn chill crab came with 3 pcs of mantou but there were 7 of us so they are so nice to give us extras w/o charging. Same goes for Prawn ball that came in 6 pcs and they made extra pc for our table. We will come back again for sure."
Nice food,"Ordered Hakka Abacus , fried olive rice , prawn ball and fried yellow flower fish ( croaker) . Nice food except fried rice on salty side from ingredient like salted fish and seasoned shrimp . Else all be perfect"
Noodle broth was bland,"Been going to this restaurant at different locations. My guests complained the broth for the noodles was bland. Very disappointing. Previous times, my guests liked the food. Guess the quality dropped."
Food is great and pricing is reasonable,Food is great and pricing is reasonable. My parents like the traditional hakka chinese food. Every dishes we have ordered so far are above what we expected. So 👍
Great food at very reasonable prices,"A great place to have local favorites like yong tau foo, fried carrot cake, tong po rou, Hakka abacus (suan pan), with a different rendition from what you are more familiar with at food courts and hawker centers. The casual ambience adds to the dining experience. Service is fuss-free and efficient. Great place for a family meal or one with friends."
Decent pricing and good food,"Servers are friendly and the pricing is good for the quality. Only hiccup is the food arrival. Even though we were told that our order of fresh steam fish would take time, it was way too long like 45 mins. The other dishes were served promptly and waiting for the fish kinda missed the enjoyment of all the dishes together."
"Eating well, simply","Id recommend XiYan if you are looking to eat ""well"" simply, or when you want to eat simply ""well"".

Ambience is cosy.

Service is no fuss but attentive. With shortage of service manpower being blatant all over town, the two who hosted and waited on the tables that night did a good job, did not make us feel neglected throughout the night.

Menu has something for everyone.
Not extensive but there are enough picks. First timers, if you wanna try more dishes, go in a good size of 4pax.

We were fully satisfied with the fish soup (modified, minus the carbs), 2 vegetables, 2 meats. We could have done 1 meat and still be filled, to trim the bill for 2.

So glad we did not miss sharing the matcha black seseme tang yuan in ginger soup - absolutely divine. They served us 3 balls instead of the usual 2.
1 each for sharing.
1 more to make ""double pleasure"" - who could refuse a good tasty well cooked fragrant tang yuan in sweet hot ginger soup ?

The usual dietary requirement of No MSG, low salt and less oil, was not necessary. But we could still and XiYan accomodates it.

My guest is a repeated customer. First timer, i am planning my next for the ""fish soup"" and ""fried pork strips"" yums!!"
OMG It's SOOOO GOOD - Go ahead and OVER ORDER!,"Our party of six had not been back for a while and was craving some of the usual suspects. We ordered like we hadn't eaten for a month, and the waiter came back to suggest that we scale back our order. Undeterred the only thing we did was reduce the carrot cake order from medium to small. When the food came - it was a blur and before we knew it - everything except for two dishes had leftovers to be packed. Every dish is a sensory experience and unique. Must order: XO carrot cake, salivating chicken, chilli crab prawns, lou shi fan, pork trotters bee hoon, abacus, bitter gourd, eggplant claypot."
Rather disappointing,Service was rude and ambience poor - no crowd at all on a Sunday evening. Not a good place to bring business guests.
Always on my mind if I am looking for Chinese food,"Every time I visit with friends, they are all so happy with the taste and quality of the food. > Duck - yummy > Steamed Fish - very fresh and tasty >Tofu with ChaiPoh - delicious >Vegetable - cooked just right"
Zi char,"This used to be chinese fine dining at keong siak road and now evolved into a zi char place. Food is ok, and service is below par. The teeanager waitress is so disinterested and over it"
Always so good!,Another delightful lunch bringing a friend there for her first time! The CKT is so ‘char’ and the generous amount of sausages and kway teow is another notch up for us! Service and food make it simply so wonderful being there. Keep it up!
Good Price for Good Authentic Chinese Food,Good Price for Good Authentic Chinese Food Friendly staffs and nice place to eat and chat Will come back for more.;)
Meal @ Xi Yan Shaw,Not too bad ; food is basically zichar but in a nice air conditioned place. Service is not too bad. Esp one very friendly and pleasant waiter. Last part dessert was spoilt by smell of 'chicken soup' Could be using a ladle that was used to scoop something with chicken on it. Desserts were the glutinous rice balls with peanuts/sesame.
Excellent food at a reasonable price,"Very generous portions combined with very high quality. Those listed under ""Chef's recommendation"" are probably very safe bets. Menu is quite comprehensive. Cuisine is a mixture of differnt regions. Service is of an acceptable level. We went back to the same restaurant twice in a week after stumbling upon this gem!"
A Casual Chinese Dining Place,"From Singapore to Hong Kong and back to SG now, the homely Hakka taste of Xi Yan has never failed us."
Good food at good price points!,"First time trying out this eatery. Wont be the last. The food was delicious, even small/medium portions were more than enough for 4 pax."
Needs refurbishment,The standard has dropped slightly but still good tasting. There were also tiny cockroaches in between the sofa seats on the right to the entrance. The dining experience was spoilt.
Lunch,Food portions were big and great value for money. Service was brisk and efficient. The quality was as expected of the establishment and brand.
"Excellent food, generous portion","Haven't had hakka food for a long time. Dishes were delicious & generous portion. My must have would be the ""suan pa zhi""... really enjoyed such traditional dishes. Service was good, probably there wasn't a crowd yet. Would love to support them, you should too!"
Always great!😊,"Always love coming back here
Hits the spot every visit. their bitter gourd is one of the faves. Really enjoy their char kway tiao with lapcheong (hope hk lapcheong stocks come back soon) ! Will be visiting again
Also shout out to the waiter and chefs in the kitchen for making our visit very pleasant, food came at a timely pace, fresh, hot, and super tasty (as usual)"
Best dish was the yong tau fu!,"Went to Xi Yan a couple of years ago and thought the yong tau fu was really good, so was keen to return again. We went on a weekday lunchtime and it was pretty quiet. Ordered a few dishes including the YTF which was just as generously filled, plump and delicious as before – defo recommended! We also had a veg dish which we enjoyed (can’t remember the name of the veg). Sadly, the other dishes were not as good - we had the yam abacus which was a bit wet for our liking, and also had weird ingredients like onions, which we have not seen in other yam abacus we have eaten. We also had a bee hoon dish which was way too sweet. Not sure whether it’s the addition of onions in these dishes which makes them sweeter than they should be, rather than savoury. Xi Yan’s interpretation of traditional dishes can be interesting but it also doesn’t quite hit the spot on some occasions which is a shame."
Good hakka food,Reasonable ambience nothing fancy But good hakka food Pregnant woman rice was tasty and the fried bitter goud was excellent Service was very good and warm
Excellent Taste and Generous Portions!,"The white bee hoon in broth was simply delicious! Ingredients was fresh and quantity was adequate. The egg tofu with crispy cai po was excellent - the tofu was silky smooth, cai po was just right, crispy and not salty. Donjo sake port belly was melt-in-your mouth good! Overall, a most satisfying meal."
Mediocre,"I was so looking forward to lo shi fun and their Hakka Yong tow Foo but found the dishes not up to expectations. Lo Shi fun was good but overall sauce and measly mince was nothing to wow about. The Yong tow Foo was overstuffed, again, with little mince pork to chew on. One waiter’s service was unprofessional whilst the young lady waitress service superseded his with apologies, politeness and great observation."
Great service personnel with good food.,"I had a great time with my friend there. Great lunch set, value for money and food tasted great. Is Hakka cuisine.
The male manager (didn’t get his name) made sure we are comfortable, went extra mile to help me to celebrate my friend birthday, we had a great time!"
Very good service,Staff was patient when taking our food orders when we were indecisive. One of them even chit chat with us while clearing our finished dished. Food was served fast and hot.
Reasonably priced amazing food,"Went for lunch mid December. Was on a Sunday. The experience was great, fast service and the food is spot on. Homely, delicious comfort food. We had the toufu, dongpuo pork, qinglong vege, fried rice much to the approval of the family. Loved it. Will return"
Home Cooked Hakka & Sichuan lunch,"This is a cosy probably family run restaurant. The menu is made up of some Hakka dishes & some Sichuan dishes. We tried mainly the Hakka dishes, it tasted home cooked and reasonably priced. Service is a little slow, as there was only 1 server and was quite over whelmed & stressed, the owner had to help out.
We brought a birthday cake to celebrate the occasion, when most of the office lunch crowd left, they were able to give us the attention needed."
Hakka specials are a mixed bag,"We came back to try out the limited-time Hakka specials.

The noodles with minced pork and lard is a steal at $1.50++, and quite good. Unless you like duck for dessert, avoid the Hakka duck: it is so sweet (without even a hint of sour flavour to balance) that it might knock out the diabetics among us. Adobo is better! The stuffed bean curd skin is too chewy-would gain from more crispiness.

Other dishes remain innovative and very good. Because of cost cuttings, there’s only one guy to take care of everything in the dining room; he’s totally overwhelmed, so be patient and prepared to wait for service."
Lunch @Xi Yan Shaw,Reservation is in order when I have reached the restaurant and the restaurant staff is very efficient and friendly although I didn't see other staff around. Dishes are awesome and my friends enjoyed very much.
Hurried lunch,"It was a hurried lunch. Before we go in the waiter already advised us to hv to leave by 3pm and my lunch appt was 2pm. Was not told earlier that the restaurant will close at 3pm.
We felt stressed by the waiter hurrying here n there n standing there waiting for us to finish our food.
Wasn’t a pleasant way of having our lunch"
Innovative and very tasty Hakka and Canto fare,"Went on a Sunday for lunch and was placed in the outer area where the service was slightly lacking as the inside area was quite busy.

One orders by noting down the selection on an order sheet - same as dim sum restaurants. Food came quickly and I enjoyed the bitter gourd and salivating spicy chicken. The chips and chicken wing had too much batter for the paltry amount of flesh.

The atmosphere at most can be considered functional. No extravagance noted anywhere.

I will return to try other intriguing dishes on the menu but will ask for an inner table."
CD Dinnet,"The dinner is during the circuit breaker (lockdown) and of course has to go through the safety entry.
The restaurant is on level 3 unit 12. When we reach there it is totally empty without any guest except the two staffs.
Ordered chicken cold dish, okinawa zj ribs, seafood white beehoon, spinach with eggs soup, hakka abacus, truffle fried rice, mala chicken, and glutinous dumplings. Overall the dishes are bad except abacus is just so-so, mala chicken which just spicy and glutinous rice a bit bitter and sweet."
"Great food, lousy takeaway service","One of our fav Chinese eateries. Even for takeaways during Covid19, the innovative food remains delish. However, the ordering system is a nightmare. The online system is confusing, insisting on PayNow but still accepting my order without advance payment. When I came to pick up the food, they forgot to give the 20% discount for self-collection.

I also received an email advertising their scrumptious rice dumplings, which gave numerous options for ordering, none of which is via their website. When I called, I was told to WhatsApp, but when I WhatsApp’d, only the number for Xi Yàn Maxwell works!

They should sort out the IT and back office fast!"
Is the food at Xi Yan better than in Xi’an?,"One of my fav casual restos - unusual dishes rarely found elsewhere in Singapore; most are not good-looking (if not downright ugly) but so yummy. The classics (eg. salivating chicken, rice in fish broth, deep fried pork belly strips, tofu with cai po, radish cake, pregnant woman fried rice, etc). Service is not very proactive, but you come here for the food lah!! Fortunately, the feet odour from the reflexology parkour across the hallway doesn’t interfere with the delicious smell of the yummy food."
Average only,"Not sure if it’s because it’s the CNY reunion dinner “rush”, the food tasted average. Service was lacking too due to insufficient staff, I supposed. They didn’t bother to refill our glasses of water, until we asked. And even asked, they only refilled those asked and not the rest and didn’t know I have to pay for the water only when I was billed. Kind of disappointing as I really liked the Xi Yan private dining which was at Craig Road."
Seafood white beehoon,The Seafood white beehoon tasted blan unlike before (a week before) So the kitchen is not consistent.
The foods are great except for the hakka duck and Okinawa black sugar pork rib,The foods are quite nice except for hakka duck with sweet sauce and Okinawa black sugar rib are too sweet. The name has self-explanatory but I would like to try. I personally don't like sweet foods. Other people may like it.
Normal fare,"The menu looked promising - familiar favourites with a contemporary touch. We usually leave no food to waste, however none of us wanted seconds. Maybe it was the combination of dishes we ordered - every dish was olive vegetable and dried shrimps galore. Too much of a good thing."
Food at shaw outlet,The white Bee Hoon & the stir fried bittergourd were well done:) ambience is not bad... Staff at the shaw branch are not very welcoming unfortunately:(
Yummy Lunch,Great food. Portion is huge. We need to ta-bao as we can't finish. We only orders 2 set lunch (fried rice & fried noodle)
Casual Dining With Innovative/Traditional Chinese Cuisine,"This lesser known Casual outlet is a gem to be unearthed . It is a scaled down version of the upmarket private dining restaurant founded by Hong Kong celebrity chef Jacky Wu..
The food here is more Cantonese/Hakka. We ordered:
Jerry Fish & Cucumber In Wasabi Sesame Sauce medium for $11.70
Pork Patty with Salted Fish & Water Chestnut .
Yunnam Ham Niang Dou Fu( Yong Tou Fu) In Special Broth medium for $ 16.20
We also ordered Fried Lo Shi Fan ( Mee Tai Mak) with XO Sauce $ 12.80 and
Hakka Abacus $ 12.80 as substitutions for rice .
The serving portions were generous and we were more than satisfied and would be back !"
Good helpful staff,Accidentally booked wrong timing but luckily managed to get seating for 8 pax. Excellent food and helpful staff. Would love to come back again. Food is good and affordable.
Great food. Poor service,Food is great as usual. Waitress are playing hide and seek from diners. Can never get any service unless you are asking for the bill.
Yong tau fu was the star!,"Visited with recommendations of the YTF and ordered a number of dishes- dumplings in chilli oil, veg, abacus seeds and YTF in sauce and also in soup. Enjoyed the dishes esp the YTF in sauce. The YTF pieces were huge and stuffed full of yumminess The abacus seeds dish is not easy to come across so I am glad we had it though it was a bit wet for me & I have more memorable ones in the past. I took away a portion of fried beancurd skin which looked a bit miserable. Not sure about the flavours as I didn't get much feedback. Yan was somewhere where after dining, I was keen to share with people I knew. If I was in town for longer, would have liked to return to sample more dishes, including the good value lunch sets!"
Tourist Foodie Treasure,"I chose this title especially for all the visitors who are shopping along Orchard Road and wish to enjoy great delicious value for money dishes

The set lunch offers a astounding variety of dishes which a couple can chose from n share with a appetizer / main / dessert & drink

We had a fried noodle dish n a soup noodle dish. The fried noodle was very tastily done with a generous helping of bean sprouts egg n a right dash of Chilli. The noodles were nice and moist n not over fried. A generous portion.
The sake pork belly noodle was absolutely delicious having a rich broth like a Ichiran ramen one. The 4 generous slices of pork belly were soft and yet having sufficient bite. The fat amount was really good making the pieces extra delicious when chewed.
The ice cream dessert were really great having a creamy texture and rich sweet flavor making us polish both off
I had a hot kamquat drink which washed down the Rick dishes at the end of our lunch
Service was warm friendly and efficient and seating was good."
Good variety of dishes,"Truffle prawn omelette was delicious, the salted egg prawns was big and fresh (this was new, so my first time trying). The pregnant fried rice was too filling for 2 pax, so better order it if you have like at least 3 pax. It was abit too salty towards the end, but otherwise overall taste was good.

The seating was cramped as compared to the old Craig Road outlet, and hard to hold a conversation coz of the noise level. But I guess that is due to the low ceiling structure.

Price was on the high side, but manageable coz I had vouchers. Only wish I had stomach space for the desserts.."
Simply average dinner for 2,"Had dinner for two. Ordered their Hakka abacus but after they took our order, the kitchen informed that it was sold out. Then tried to order Hakka fried lo shi fun, but also sold out.

Dishes that we had:
spicy dan-dan noodles - warm, borderline cold noodles, with some watery sauce instead of the creamy sauce usual with dan-dan noodles
pregnant woman fried rice - couldn't figure out why it is ""pregnant woman's fried rice"" but it was the most tasty dish we ordered
bitter gourd - it was an okay dish
shrimp paste and fermented bean chicken chop - this dish was greasy, and pretty tasteless, despite with ""shrimp paste and femented bean""
pork patty with salted fish and water chestnut - another greasy, bland mince pork patty that didn't have any taste

The restaurant was based on HK's kitschy cha chaan teng, slightly cramped casual dining restaurant. So overall, everything was sub-par."
Good and value for money,Visited last week for lunch with friend . Food taste good and set lunch is value for money . Come with dessert as well
"Fast service, tasty dishes",Xi Yan is a good place for meeting friends over interesting casual Chinese cuisine. Service is quick and mostly attentive. It's quite popular so either book a table or go early!
Falling standards,"Standards have plunged dramatically. Used to like the innovative menu and good cooking, but now the quality now sub-standard"
Chinese food and Yu Sheng reasonable prices,This is a nice place for good Chinese food in Orchard area. The Yu Sheng is very colourful with vegetables and fruits. Every unique. Will definitely return.
Not too bad,"Food is nice. Staff can afford to be more attentive but so far so good, no complains. In other words, service is good. Food is good."
Keep in coming back as it’s really good,"I was last here with my ex boss & always felt this place is under rated. The dishes like pig trotters fried bee hoon, pork belly with bean curd were simply dishes so delicious. Even the Hakka yong tau foo was awesome.
Returning again in less than 2 months at the invite of my neighbour. We had their signature dish of white bee hoon with king prawns, squids, pork belly broth. It was seriously awesome, delicious without a touch of MSG. For lovers of egg plant. Die die, must try the dish with salted egg. I want more .... two other dishes ordered weren’t that bad either. The bitter gourd, carrot cake with radish ... was good.
Yes, I will be back again soon. Keep it up."
Good food value for money,"Very delicious traditional Chinese cuisine, generous serves and value for money. The place is small but can accomodate long table for big group, and the service is pretty quick. All in all, will be happy to visit again."
Siblings,"Excellent food quality. Service staff were very attentive, especially a lady by the name “mei ji”. The food flavours were unique, and very enjoyable and satisfying to the taste buds. The ambience and decor were not exactly posh restaurant settings, but the company, awesome quality food and service more than make up for it. It’s definitely a restaurant that commands a re-visit."
So so,"Service is not bad, place also good, but the food just so so only. 菜色清淡，吃不出有什么特别之处，普通的请客吃饭因为地点的关系还可以"
Consistently good,I have always enjoyed my meal here. The ingredients are of good quality and the dishes are deliciously tasty and most importantly consistent. Highly recommended.
Dinner 3 paxs,"After a while since I last came here must I say its still one of the better restaurants around for authentic chinese food. Definitely keeps up its reputation and standard. Had the xo sauce mee tai mak, prawn noodles (special promotion) dan dan noodles fried pork and green dragon vegetables. Every dish is above average with ample wok hei which makes all very tasty and delicious. Price is also reasonable for a star kitchen."
nice food,the food is good especially the okinawa ribs . like the sauce very much. but the seating there is too narrow.
Thumbs up!,"Celebrated Father's Day at Xi Yan. Food was yummy, service for great and the price was reasonable! Definitely coming back for other family gatherings"
Excellent food,"We went to this restaurant by accident. Usually, we will either choose a restaurant which we had frequent or places that were recommended by others. It is quite seldom that I can bump into such a good restaurant and yet we walk out saying that we will go back again.

The signature prawn mee is excellent. My husband and I dont have enough when we ordered a medium size prawn mee. I understand from my in laws and children that the fried rice was good as well (I didnt try it as I dont take fried rice) The fried hakka lao shu fen was also good. The only dish that we dont like is the fried kway tiao as it was oily. The fried meat is also quite nice.

The desert was excellent as well. The dumpling was very nice that we ordered another bowl. The peanut is mixed with salted egg. The soup was excellent. The ginger smell was very strong yet it was not spicy at all!
The other desert that we ordered is the pumpkin salted egg ice-cream. Usually I dont take cold stuff or even ice cream but the fancy name make me ordered my desert. Excellent choice! Must try!

I will definitely come back again! and recommend this restaurant to all! Unique food that is tasty and very good service by all friendly staff.

Keep up the good work!"
A different kind of Chinese food,I found the food quite different from what I would get in other Chinese restaurants in Singapore. They offered different portions and we ordered many dishes with the smallest serving. Every dish that we tried was very good. The food was a bit oily. The price was very good for the quality of the food. I will definitely go back.
Dinner after Cinema,"Tugged away on the third floor of Shaw Center, one can mistakingly walk by this restaurant. A small restaurant but the food is somewhat unique Chinese restaurant. We began with jelly fish and cucumber in sesame wasabi sauce (served cold), steamed cod fish with white noodles in pickled Chili, string beans with olives and pork, pork leg with egg in Chinese vinegar, ginger and garlic, black truffles prawn omelette, roasted kafir leaves chicken. All the food tastes good and presented in small portion. Finally we had the Pregnant woman fried rice which was acceptable. It was full of flavour of radish, ginger, olives and fried shrimps! Overall the food taste good and quite reasonable. Ambience is modern and quite cramp! Not crowded on a holiday evening!"
Family dinner,First time there and the place is small so recommended to call first and make bookings. Food was delicious and we wanted to try all dishes but with four of us is impossible so we are coming back again. The menu is a mixture of dialects and different types of fried rice even for pregnant ladies. Service is excellent. The server will explain the dishes if you are unsure. Beer and wine is served too.
No Xi’an fish maw at Xi Yan Shaw,"Not only the food is innovative with interesting, modern interpretations of traditional Chinese cuisine, but the dishes are also scrumptuous. It’s a bit hidden, so it attracts a mainly local clientèle. Don’t miss the signature dishes, like salivating chicken, deep fried pork belly, rice in fragrant fish broth, bitter gourd with minced pork. The place is small but not intimate, as it’s open, and one can see people walking by, or having a foot massage across the hallway; fortunately, the foot odour doesn’t interfere with the nourishing smell of the delicious food. Prices are very reasonable given the quality."
Reasonable price with good food,Reasonable price with good food. The restaurant is pretty small and thus the service from the servers are good and they are attentive.
"Excellent food, value for money",Enjoyed almost every dish ordered! The vegetables with eggs three way was really delicious too. standard portions were good for four to five ppl to share.
SHC,"Xi Yan Shaw is having a different approach and image as compared to Xi Yan Private Dining in Craig Road. Xi Yan Shaw is focusing on casual dining for family and small gatherings with lower pricing and wide variety for the diners. Out of the 6 dishes we ordered and only 1 dish which we found to be below our expectation. In general, we think it is a value for money dining venue."
Great service great food,Prompt And courteous service. Food was good. Serving size is good for small groups. Good place to gather friends.
Yummy food,I am back to Xi Yan Shaw again as the food is tastefully creative with new dishes and affordable. Service is not bad.
Average HK style food,It was our first time to Xi Yan restaurant in Singapore though we have been to a few of their outlets in HK. The one in Singapore has been localised I reckon to suit the local tastebuds. However the service was good but food was a bit pricey. The zhejiang tang chu pai koo and the si ji dou was ok but the kou sui ji came shredded instead of whole slices and white noodle had a strong ginger taste.
Superb dishes,Ordered the dan dan noodles and the Yong Dao fu soup. It was superb. I didn't have the msg effect though the dishes are tasty. My first visit as recommended by my frd at this branch and will visit again.
Ready to Close Down,"Had lunch on 27 Dec, restaurant was 50% full upon our visit, only 2 waitress on duty. Stood at entrance for 5 minutes, in the end walked in and asked for 2 seats.

All customers had to look for waitress in order to place order. Requested for sauce, got to remind twice.

Food quality and portion had dropped tremendously, clearly tastes msg and chicken stock which is available from supermarket. Prices are incredibly high with quality of food. Must take into consideration that everything thing is service charge (compulsory tips)!

Perhaps this outlet is ready to close down in no time."
Good but tad noisy,Nice food though portions rather small for the price. Service adequate but rather noisy given the open setting and low ceiling.
Family dinner,"We had the daily soup, steamed cod on rice noodles etc and tang yuen for desserts. Restaurant was full and noisy!"
"a regular at XI Yan, tasty food at affordable prices","not my first time at XI YAN SHAW, tried their fried rice this round, its extremely tasty and portion was gd enough for 3 pax. their coconut ice cream dessert with pudding was quite gd as well."
Cool,Great foods all tge fiids are very nice... Clean place soft music..... Nice stuffs cool.. We'll come again.
Good,"the food was good, except for the salted egg squid was quite disappointing. the price is reasonable. this is singapore, short-handed is common."
Good quality food,Visited Xi Yan Shaw again after some time. The food quality is still good. We loved the steamed cod fish fillet with rice noddles. Soup of the day is also value for money. Service was fast and the staff is attentive.
Simple traditional dishes,"Food was served quite fast,considering the night crowd. Food was presented well. We like the fried beehoon w pork leg very much."
Value-for-money,Was trying to find an affordable place for lunch with the kids but not more of the same-old. Decided to go back to Xiyan. The restaurant delighted us with its Hakka food. Tasty. Kids loved it.
The whole place is too cold for comfort,Service and food are both good but the whole place is simply too cold for comfort. The food turned cold after 3 mins upon arrival!
Xi you soon,"@TheKuoKnows

Hakka cuisine is still a bit of a rarity in Singapore. It shouldn’t be. But it is.

Xi Yan Shaw on Scotts Road is a real credit to Hakka style cooking. It is the simplicity that makes it so delicious. Hats off to the chef.

The Zheng Jiang Vinegar Spare Ribs are melt-in-the mouth delicious. The Fried Squid in Salted Egg Yolk is beyond superb. The Hakka Abacus Mushrooms are definitely worth a try too.

Service is top drawer. The food was despatched from kitchen to table without too much delay, even though it was a busy lunchtime.

Xi Yan Shaw gets a big thumbs-up from me. Can wait for the next visit, which I am hoping will be very soon."
Unique and a place that you will visit again,"Great Chinese fusion food in Shaw Center. The Pregnant Woman Fried Rice is highly recommended. The combination of olive, dried radish and dry shrimps are perfect. Simply mind blowing due to the uniqueness. The eggplant and pork patties are good choices too."
Chinese Cuisine,The food presentation is OK. The general taste especially the Water Chestnut and Pomelo Salad is above average. Customer service is good.
Experience in Xi Yan Shaw,"It is a place that I will recommend - Be it with friends or family, small or big group.
The dishes are unique and some are 'traditional' that remind me of home cooked food by our grannies. Don't miss out the desserts - I love the ""tang-yuen"" especially.
Staffs were friendly and service was prompt. Price was reasonable - around $35 per pax
Overall, it is a place that I will visit always."
Excellent food,We enjoyed the seafood beehoon and the rest of the food. Ambience was nice yet casual which was a perfect setting for meet ups with friends.
Great food - always a winner with my friends,Authentic and uncommon Hokkien and Cantonese dishes with a flair - don't miss the pig trotters fried bee hoon and yong tau foo.
Reasonable price,"Dishes were reasonably priced and food were tasty. However, seemed to be slow in service although it is a small restaurant."
Heartwarming and delicious food,"The food was very delicious, and the flavours were mostly on point. We loved almost all the dishes we ordered, and the desserts were good as well. We will definitely head back there for another meal in future."
Reliable chinese food,"Xiyan used to have dishes that are delightful surprises, but these days, it's just a nice reliable place for comfort food.The service has dipped as well, from warm and competent staff to those who don't really know their stuff and instead of finding out, try to get by with calling everyone ""帥哥"" ""美女"", which is a tad low and a major turnoff."
Not as good as our first visit.,"This was our second visit and we left feeling disappointed. At 7 p.m. had already run out of their daily special, the Ginger Chicken as well as their roast chicken. The pork trotter with bee hoon was also not available. The deep fried pork belly was tough like leather. We ordered another daily special, the prawn balls; the serving consisted of 4 pieces round balls, each diameter was not bigger than a 20cent coin! The pea sprouts though tasty were stringy ie old shoots. The abacus beads and cai poh kuay teow were tasty but oily. Not sure if we will ever be back."
Good food,We shared a number of dishes and were happy with them all. Most memorable was the cheese wings. Staff were friendly and efficient.
Another great experience,We came back with friends and everyone packed a dish back to share with their family cuz it's SOOO good.
"""sweet"" dinner","went for dinner at Xi Yan shaw. saw pictures of the dishes and decided to try out. We ordered a few recommended dishes to share. we did not like any of the dishes at all. perhaps people who enjoy sweet chinese dishes might like them???
Hakka marinated duck with sweet sauce, salivating spicy chicken are ok, sort of tasted as what we expected. although not something that we would come back for, but at least tasted ok.
Disappointingly, tofu with crispy cai po and XO minced meat with eggplant were both pretty sweet. Even Dan Dan noodles tasted sweet. These dishes are not supposed to be sweet. Dan Dan noodles tasted like being mixed with peanut butter, and its not spicy even though we asked for spicy. sweet dishes tend to make us feel full very fast and after having all these sweet dishes, we no longer had any urge to have any dessert. because we were already overdosed with sugar."
simple and tasty food,"The food is simply prepared but full of flavor. We had the salted duck, pork ribs, qing long veggies, mall tofu w preserved olives and pregnant woman fried rice. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs! The food is full of strong flavors that are not shy about invading your taste buds. My favorite was the fried rice which had good texture and balance of flavors, completely unpretentious and meant to sate hungry people (no I'm not pregnant)"
Great food,Came here with my godma and we both thoroughly enjoyed the food. Every dish we ordered was good. Unfortunately we sat nxt to a very loud inconsiderate table debating a fmly issue which dampened our otherwise outstanding experience.
Xi Yan Shaw,Very impressive!!! Must try the fried xo sauce cai po raddish cake & hakka marinated duck with sweet sauce!
