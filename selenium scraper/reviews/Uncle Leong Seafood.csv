Company CNY Lunch 2023,"Held a company lunch and pre-order their CNY set lunch for 2 tables at the Fairprice Hub- Joo Koon. The experience was extremely disappointing. Though we were given VIP table but there were no table setting when we arrived. Waited 35 mins for the food to be served and 4 dishes came at the same time and without the Lohei which we had pre-ordered too. Their reason was there is a shortage of ingredients. Service staff didn't bother to serve the shark's fin soup, its ""help yourself"". No bowls and spoons provided which we need to self help too. Its like putting you in a VIP room and forgotten all about you! No drinks were served even though we would like to place an order.
Its a complete disaster. Taste of the food is below average for a restaurant standard even for the crab which they are proud of. The crabs are not even probably chopped. There is also no manager in the branch to manage the restaurant which is strange. This is like a zichar stall charging a restaurant price.
I would not recommend if you are hosting a lunch or dinner. Maybe standard hor fun or 1 dish rice set can be considered.
Certainly not worth paying this price to get yourself embarrassed along with a bad experience if you are hosting or as a gathering venue."
"Excellent food, but disorganised at Reception","Staff at reception was disorganised - served customers who had no reservations over those that had ready tables waiting. But besides that, service after seated was great, and the food was excellent as well. Will come back, but avoid peak periods."
Disappointed by an old favourite,"The Tebing Lane Uncle Leong has always been the go-to for birthday celebrations in the family, where we order almost the same dishes each time. This time, it was quite disappointing as the service was no longer as prompt (and server to guest was even better than covid times) and the crabs and broth didn’t taste as fresh nor as evenly cooked as previously (we’ve had better ones even during seasons when crabs were scarcer or not of great quality).

The usual staff/manager were not around so we’re not sure if there has been a change in management. For the standard, there are many competitors which are on par for about the same price. Sorry, but this outlet has lost its unique proposition for us."
Crab Bee Hoon,"Signature Crab Bee Hoon. Freshly cooked in a claypot and accompanied by lime juice. Other variety of crabs - Chili style, Black Pepper, Salted Egg available too. Ample parking. No queue."
Excellent seafood in a suburban district,"This restaurant is off the beaten path, but it may be worthwhile driving up here to eat. No frills, solid seafood cuisine prepared with strong fires and passion.

Of note, the pumpkin prawns were a delight. Crispy prawn balls with a sweet creamy pumpkin sauce. By mistake they served us the butter creamy crab instead of chilli crab, but we were pleasantly impressed. Guess we were also lucky we came on full moon, so the crabs were very large-sized. The flavour was just right, not too overwhelming. Crispy fried baby sotong was lovely too. Interestingly the garlic fried pork ribs were very good too!

Beverage selection was limited but I suppose it’s alright since it has decided to stick to its forte which is good seafood.

I would be happy to come back some time, to try out other dishes… see if the rest is as good as those of my first encounter."
NOT RECOMMENDED,"BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD.
Came on Mother's day with my family (5 pax including my mum).
On the mother's day set menu, it has superior crab roe shark fin stated for mummy only. So when we received only 1 bowl of shark fin, i checked with the staff only to find out that only 1 mummy per table gets the shark fin soup. All other mummies who dine together are not eligible. But it's mother's day? and it's a mother's day set menu? Lol. how ridiculous.
Rice was also not part of the set meals but was not mentioned to us during ordering until we asked when the mains were all served.
The Shimmering Sand Crab was terrible too."
Everything is so so.,Price is no diff from Jumbo seafood. Jumbo seafood chilli crab is really good and they surely their fish is fresh too. At uncle Leong the chilli crab n fish were disappointing.
YUMMILIOUS!,"Uncle Leong is still superb, still serving delectable and fresh as before. Highly recommend all to come back to support them."
Birthday Dinner Celebration,"Service from the servers were below standard just as what other reviews mentioned. Only the cashier which might be the owner is friendly. Gloves were not issued to us even though we ordered $200+ worth of crabs. Made the booking 2-3 weeks before but was not granted an indoor seats.

Food taste and quality was acceptable, however the crabs were not serve hot like its fresh from the kitchen. For the price charged, i think it can be better."
Awesome butter crab,"The queue can really be long ( for us it took 1 hour plus) and its really worth it. Butter crab was awesome, we had it with salted egg brinjal and a few bottles of beer. Setvice was very good and waiters were really attentive beyond the expectation. One Improvement point is really limited beer selection. But prices were much reasonable compared to its equally famous peers."
Way below expectations,My neighbourhood zi char is better. That should be my first and last time to this restaurant. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.
Nice place. Good food.,"Came here with my family for dinner. The location was a little out of place (Tebing @ Pungol East) but the restaurant and atmosphere kinda made up for it. Went there at 530pm and we were the first customers for the night. Overall, the food was not bad. Good thing about this restaurant chain is that the food served here is not overpriced as compared to some higher-end Chinese restaurants out there like Jumbo and No Signboard seafood etc.

Cons:
For Chinese tea lovers/drinkers, there is only tea with teabags there. No pu er cha or tie guan yin. Just fyi. Desserts are rather limited in choices with only two selections."
Very unique location to have meal,1st time to this seafood restaurant during COVID period. Staff are responsible for the safety and hygiene and follow closely to he regulations. Well serve and food is nice.
Suggest to go there for non-seafood dishes,"We ordered crab, prawns and other non-seafood dishes. With the price we paid, we expected better quality from this seafood restaurant. However, the size of prawns are rather small, hence leaving one unsatisfied. Crab had an average taste, falling below our expectation. Other than seafood, the other dishes are fine."
Chilli crab was good,"The chilli crab was different from the usual. Not the usual tomato sweet kind and had a nice spicy kick to it. I really enjoyed it. The salted egg prawns were decent. The prawns were fresh but would have preferred more of the salted egg taste. We had the scallop and tofu as well. The scallops were rubbery and not fresh, the tofu was alright. The cuttlefish youtiao was below average. This is the only dish I won’t order again."
Yummy & affordable,Enjoyed the yummy zhichar dishes. Friendly staff. Good outdoor setting. Friends surprised with the big selection of menu. Easy to book. It’s a gem in Punggol.
Enjoyable dinner,Their black pepper and beehoon crabs were superb and so were their non-seafood dishes. Service was attentive and recovery quick!
"Nice Ambience, Grest Seafood and Reasonable Price","Visited the restaurant with friends for dinner. Ordered their signature dishes like Shimmering Sand Crab, Guinness Pork Ribs, Chinese Spinach with 3 types of eggs and Fried Mee Sua. Food was good, generous portion and price was quite reasonable.
The ambience of the restaurant was also very nice, next to cannal but do watch out for mosquitoes and sand flies if you are sittnig in the open.
Staffs were helpful and friendly. Will definitely visit again."
Bad Service from Waitress,We encountered very bad service from the waitress who took order for our food. Sort of rude and seems like getting very frustrated
Great Birthday Dinner @Uncle Leong's,"Great staff, excellent food... enjoyed my birthday dinner with my family. My son especially loved the chilie crab and cereal prawns, thank you for the excellent service."
UNCLE LEONG,"I constantly need to ask waiter/waitress to change the used bowl/plate, this should not be the case, change of bowl/plate should be their own initiative, the service staff is not focus to serve customer, not easy to ask them do work, like remove the empty dish, clean the table, all the service staff look very busy, I feel my group were neglected."
Delish,"Excellent service here and very nice food. There's always one person who speaks English too and that's always welcome for me who is effectively monolingual. The 1-4-1 crab needs to be booked in advance, which I found weird, but it's definitely worth it. You can't go wrong with the pepper crab."
Dining @ Uncle Leong Seafood Tebing Lane,"Food was generally good. The crabs are meaty (restaurant quality) - similar to the ones at Mellben (sister group of restaurants) and No Signboard Seafood Restaurant.
Prices are similar anywhere you go for crabs. I went through 3 crab dinners within 10 days - good quality, price is about SGD 80-100 per kg."
Worst seafood in Singapore,Do not be cheated with all the good reviews! The price is really ridiculous and the food is really bad. worst than hawker food.
Great service,"Staff was always attentive, service was fantastic. Food was served pretty quickly and most of all their crab quality was good!"
Good food but super expensive . Crab seasonal price at $96 per kg,"Went there to celebrate birthday. Ordered crabs as family was looking forward to it. Even though I know the price of crabs is seasonal, I shocked to hear $96 per kg for Sri Langka Crab. As family was looking to it, have to bite the bullet and ordered. Beware of the seasonal price"
"Great service staff, great food","Third time at this place and never fails everytime. My father, who is a picky crab eater, had nothing to complain. Crabs are fresh and the sauce of shimmery sand crab is fantastic."
A good place to have decent Chinese food and crabs,A good place to have decent Chinese food and crabs with friends and families. Been here for couple of times and the standard still maintain.
Awesomely Yummy!,Never disappoint me with the freshness of crab and other seafood! The creamy butter crab is to die for 😋
Good food for our anniversary,I wanted my Wife to celebrate our 17th Wedding Anniversary at Uncle’s Leong restaurant. I told her that our last visit was 3 years ago since we had moved to west area. The food was still as good as in the past. The only new food we tried was chilli crab as we used to have black pepper or salted egg crabs. We were quite surprised that it was spicy and good. It could have been better if the crab meat was as tasty as the gravy.
Love the Salted Egg Crab.,"I was usually here for the salted egg crab, salted egg brinjal and signature Hor Fun. Always here for my family events. Highly recommended. After a dinner here, there's other restaurant around there that you can get a drink and chill for the night."
Incredible Seafood,"If you like great seafood, this is your place. The only problem I had with the menu was that there were too many great items to choose from. Everyone in our group was thrilled with this place. Service was fast and friendly."
Dining@Uncle Leong Restaurant,Food overall was pleasant. Nice ambience and smooth table arrangement for reservation made. Thumbs up!
Not really affordable,"Paid $80plus per crab.. so I don't think this is affordable.
There were 4 of us. I was shocked. Don't remember that from the last time I ate there.
One black pepper and one chilli.
We had three other dishes with the crabs.. almost 75-80$ per head."
A Saturday lunch there,"Lunch on a Saturday. Went at 2pm. Ordered quite abit of food for 6 pax
Food was good esp their Celereal prawns n Coffee pork Ribs.
Chilli crab was abit dissappointing. Tasted much better at other places. The 2 vege we took were also not that tasty."
Brought my Taiwanese friends and they loved it,"The 金沙螃蟹 is extraordinary, taste the same as the original AMK site before they moved off. The surroundings has many pubs for another round of drinks but the natural green habitat Opp this restaurant makes it a kampong feel. Good place to bring your foreign friends as not the usual East Coast or aircon place. More like upscale Tze Char feel. My / Taiwanese friends love it, except that the only beer they have here is Calsburg and it’s bottle not even draft on tap. Need to improve on that."
Chilli crab and shimmering sand crab,"I went to the toa payoh branch. Its the typical coffeeshop setting without aircon. Saw a fee tables of tourists going there as well. Ordered 2 crabs to eat along with 8 mini buns. The shimmering sand crab came first. The base of the gravy i supposed is butter. The gravy is infused with bits of black pepper and oats. Quite an interesting taste, however, the paste seems abit too thick for my own personal liking. Overall the crab gave ample meat. The chilli crab came next and the gravy is spicy-sweet. It tasted as what i was expecting. Very good gravy to drip my mini buns. As the mini buns were depleted, i ordered 1 bowl of white rice so that i can eat with both types of gravy. The 2 crabs were around S$72 each. They were selling the crabs at S$75/kg. I ultimately ended the dinner with hor fun. The hor fun tasted normal. Will visit the place again but maybe next time round to test the crab beehoon which many tables had ordered."
"Great meal , great service","We went to the restaurant at Anchorpoint - 368 Alexander Rd for dinner and had Claypot Crab bee hoon soup, Black pepper crab and Chinese spinach with egg.

The dishes were served quite fast and were generous in size and tasted delicious.
The restaurant was full with diners and the staff service was great.

This place is recommended for visiting and it was a great culinary start to our Singapore holiday."
"Good food, generous portion",Went for early family reunion. The food quality is very high with ample amount to share for 7. The services for children can be improved.
Zhi Char & Seafood at good price,Service & Food were quick . Prices are reasonable as well. Child friendly. Abit noisy though. Sure to visit again.
Casual dining,"The common dishes like chicken, fry egg, pork rib and etc taste not that fantastic and may not comparerable to those coffeeshop zi char. The seafood yet to try hopefully will taste better then normal average ."
Excellent,"Service staff were great, food excellent. Only thing is the indoor area was quite smelly. Outdoor is better."
Yummy Dishes!!,"I dined at Uncle Leong Seafood with my family, using the Chope 50% off vouchers on a Sat. All the dishes were yummy. All would have been really perfect if the chilli crab could be less salty. The drunken prawns were unbelievable!!! Even my dad who refrains from eating seafood, could not resist the alluring aroma!! He ended up having 2 bowls of soup and 2 big prawns! LOL.. Great laidback atmosphere! We will return for sure!!"
Overpriced Crab,Crab is selling at 1kg $75 which is almost 50% higher than the usual. Overall was not really very fantastic but with the use of the voucher is still consider value for money.
Nice food and fast,Food is nice and service is good booked through CHOPE fast and no waiting. Ordered set meal for 6 the Guinness stout pork was surprisingly nice can choose 2 different cooking styles of crab as it was for 1.8kg. Nice! Price wise a bit pricy but to me it was worth paying for.
One of the best Chili Crab in Singapore!,"Went there a bit late in the evening and there weren't much people dining then. We ordered the crab roe shark Fin soup, chili crab etc. We enjoyed dining there! I am pretty sure I am going back for the signature hor fun some time!"
Fresh Crab Great Service!,We ordered 2 crabs pepper and salted egg.The food came in fast. The crabs took longer to prepare. Since we were 4 people the staff asked again if we wanted the 2nd crab - each 1.9 kg - which is very thoughtful.Only thing is that mantou only comes with chilli crab. We just had to order on top.
My preferred restaurant for crabs,"Great food, great service. Good offer 50% off with chope vouchers. But need to make reservation with chope first. It’s also important to note the conditions required in order to use the vouchers"
"Big portion, Value for money",The portion was quite big given for 2 person which we can’t finish. Ordered crab and it was good! Service is good as the waitress bother to come over and change for a new plate upon seeing our plates full of shell. Ambience a bit hot as there is direct sunlight into the dining area.
The Claypot Bee Hoon Crab is awesome,"1st of all, The food portion is big & the set meal is worthwhile . My Family and I (5adults and a kid) had ordered a set for $188 which consists of Chilli Crab & Claypot Bee Hoon Crab , and 3 or 4 dishes and a dessert . These food are just nice for 6 of us . The crabs are weighted at around 750g per dish.

We would usually go for House of Seafood in Punggol , But this time , I wanted to give Uncle Leong a try . And it never disappoint me.

Mpreover , the staff are polite and promptly. & the Punggol Outlet is extremely peaceful and clean.

I would strongly recommend to my friends."
Great food and service!,Uncle Leong never fails to provide a great dining experience for my family and friends! I would highly recommend this place.
Good food and friendly staff,"Seafood price is reasonable. With chope discounts, that makes it all the more attractive.We tried the golden sand crab which is superb. The cereal prawns was good too. Will definitely recommend it to anyone who loves seafood."
excellent service and food,the crabs are fresh and big. the staff is so sweet that she called me 1 day before to tell me the crab was not so good therefore as me to change to another day and she promise me to keepgood crab for me. and she keep her promise.
Good food at affordable price and great service,Brought friends from America to dine there. The food was great. My friends enjoyed it alot. The price is affordable. The service staff did well in servicing and attentive.
First time having chili crab!!!,"Wow! This restaurant blew me away.

I visited this restaurant with a couple of local friends and their daughter. They told me this was their go-to when they had friends in town, and I definitely see why!

On our menu: chili crab with mantou, fish skin, drunken shrimp (soup), blanched spinach, sweet & sour pork.

It was my first exposure to chili crab and it was so amazing. I can see why it is Singapore's national dish! The chili sauce was more of a stew and there were egg whites mixed in the sauce as well.

Another new dish to me was the fish skin, and wow it was dangerously addicting. Why do I say that? Well as with many people I know my skin is sensitive to deep fried foods. But I could not stop eating the fish skin - it was that addicting!

The great thing about Uncle Leong is that it is in a very local area so there are no tourists in the area at all. If the locals are willing, it would be a great place to mix and mingle with local people!"
"good food, good service","the staff were very attentive, food tastes good and service is fast. a well organized restaurant. nothing more to ask for."
Good food and service,"I visited this restaurant with 3 other colleagues during a weekday. We ordered the crab in vermicelli claypot, chilli crab, beer ribs and a vegetable dish. The crabs were mid size and fleshy with good amount of roe. The chilli had a good amount of heat and is fairly well balanced but a tad oily. Vermicelli was thick and had a good texture. Beer ribs were flavorful and sumptuous. Overall, the food was great. Although it was a Thu night, the restaurant was packed at around 8 PM. Service was excellent as they regularly changed the plates for us.
Tip: I booked using Chope and bought a $200 voucher at 50% discount. Very good value. The final bill for us came up to SGD 180 after discount."
Fantastic service with good food,"We were very happy with the service of Ms Liew/ Liu, was a very helpful lady with great smile all time."
"Good food, excellent customer service","I have been to Uncle Leong Seafood @ Punggol for a few times, and they never fail to impress me with their professional customer service, and the quality of the food is well maintained. The price is also reasonable. Will always go back for seafood."
Nice food,"Went for dinner at 5.15pm on a Sunday, the restaurant was still quite empty on arrival. However the crowded started to come around 6.30pm. Staffs were polite and friendly. Food is overall quite nice. The sand crab is sweet and tasty. Some of my family members commented that the toufu crabmeat soup can taste better without the toufu. For me, I find it ok. Next time, might try the chilli or black pepper crab, as I saw other tables ordering them. Price is not cheap. Fortunately, there is Chope voucher. The only negative experience there is that there is an irritating housefly flying around. Hope management can get rid of it."
Great service,"Nice food, the portion are quite big too.Ordered claypot crab bee Hoon soup, the soup is good. The staffs are friendly too. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
Great crabs,Crabs are fresh and meat is solid. Over all the mee Hoon crabs are great. We had another crab in chilli source but it was too spicy for us. Another worth while to order are the chicken wings. Taste crispy and nice.
Dinner at Uncle Leong's restaurant Punggol,"The food was great but the environment feels a bit stuffy and hot as the doors at the air-conditioned area was not closed off completely. This resulted in an environment that feels less than comfortable while consuming the hot meals served. The service staff was very friendly, courteous and helpful, they also controlled the pace of the food delivery to avoid overcrowding the table with food."
Annoying music,Given a table outdoor and next door played loud music which very irritating and uncomfortable when we dine. Perhaps restaurant can fence up for a little privacy
Great service but room for improvement in the food,"This is our first time visiting this restaurant as we wanted to try something new. Searching online n the name Uncle Leong came out frequently.

Nice place with indoor n outdoor seats. We chose outdoor as it is in front of the sea n we can feel the sea breeze n it is veey cooling alhtough without aircon. Staffs came immediately to serve us with friendly smiles. Once step into the restaurant, one will feel very welcomed bybthe staffs, which this is very essential for a successful service oriented business, a restaurant.

Really have to compliment the staffs' level of service. Excellent service, attentive, polite, welcoming. Can see that they are really into serving the guests.

As for the food, the gravy of the chillie crabs are too sweet, but the crab thick soup is delicious, vegetables and claypot seafood mix are also nice. Anyway the staff did come forward to ask for comments, which not many rrstaurabts practice that. Hopefully they can really improve on their chillie crabs.

Price wise, 75 dollars per kilogram for crabs is considered higher as compared to other restaurants such as, Keng Eng Kee at Alexandra village, one good restaurant that we always visited. But overall, for that kind of service and the environment(Sea breeze when sit outside), it is still considered a good place to have dinner with family and friends.

Will come back and try crabs cook in other ways n enjoying the seabreeze again."
Best crab I've ever had,"I have never eaten so much crab at one single sitting in my life, but it just happened at Uncle Leong Seafood. The crab was done very well! One cannot go wrong with the chili crab style but we particularly found the butter crab very uniquely tasty (and also sinful on the calories). There was also plenty of crab meat which was easy to eat. The crab is a must eat here! That aside, I enjoyed the other dishes like the fried rice and venison. The mee goreng was good but a tad spicy for most of us. It was a nice way to celebrate Father's Day here. It can get extremely crowded during weekends so be prepared."
Ok,"I got taken to Uncle Leong’s by some friends on a visit to Singapore in February.

We got a range of dishes including a speciality of the restaurant which was crab in coconut and evaporated milk sauce. To be honest, I didn’t think it was that great or the crab as full as it could have been.

There were some pork ribs which were nice and the vegetables excellent.

Not a cheap meal either!"
5 star for their service,"5 star for their service. Food wise, was delicious as usual. Portion was good. Ordered the signature hor fan, which is flat rice noodle. Will be back again."
Return visit - Disappointment,"A birthday celebration with family. Ordered the set menu; though the 2 crabs were good, the chilli crab sauce was bland, tasteless. A real disappointment!! We added 2 ala carte dishes of 2 pepper crabs and sambal fried rice. These fared much better. The fried rice had wok-hei, could be slightly more sambal spicy for the 'Wow sambal factor' Service staff were polite though a little forgetful, had to be reminded for the ice cubes and the bowl of white rice. The Guinness pork ribs tasted more like regular sweet sour pork ribs. Pls do justice to the name given to the dish. Yam paste gingko nut dessert no longer authentic mixed with overly sweet condensed. A plus point however is serving and allowing us to eat the dessert at a clean table next to ours. I've not experienced this at any other seafood restaurant! Overall, food standard has definitely deteriorated compared to last year."
Good food and excellent service,"On 27 Jan,2018, my family and I went Uncle Leong for dinner to celebrate my birthday. The waiters and waitresses are very friendly and keen to serve. Food is nice and not too pricey. Value for money."
Night for eating out,"Enjoyed the food, the service, the ambience. Lovely place for a simple night out to eat, chat and just relax."
Excellent Food & Service!,Excellent Service. The waiting time was long but it was worth it. Very impressed with the level of service and attentiveness of the staff. Staff was worried that the children may be hungry with the long wait and offered fried buns for us. They even offered to let us have free dessert as a form of service recovery! Really appreciate their effort for making a difference with such good customer experience! Excellent team and surely will recommend to my friends and return for more good food!
Chilli and butter crab!!,"Ordered both Chilli and butter crab. Chilli crab had the right consistency and flavour, without being too spicy. Butter crab was rich and creamy, without being too overpowering."
Recommended for crab lovers,"Good service as always. Apart from its crab dishes, other dishes are great too. This place is popular so resevation is required to avoid the wait during peak hours."
Best Mee Goreng,"Been a long time since i ate such good Mee Goreng. This place famous for their seafood, but have to say that their mee goreng is very well done. GOOD!"
Attentive service,It feel good to be attended to before you signal intention. It was quite a busy evening but the service personnel is good.
Still ok,"Salted egg crab is quite fresh, chilli crab was not flavourful enough. Service is not bad. Food was decent :)"
First time at this branch,"Been to many Uncle Leong branches and this is our first time to this Punggol branch. Overall, good atmosphere and very condusive indoor and outdoor seatings. But the signature chilli crab was slightly disappointing with watery and too-sweet gravy."
Good food n good service,I had my dinner with my family on 5th Dec. The food were delicious and e waitress was patient to share with us the selection of food n the portion to order. Overall a nice experience eating there
Excellent Services,Food and services were excellent! Friendly and approachable staff! Thumbs up! Chilli crabs are their signature dish! Love their crab bee hoon as well!
Great crab dishes but reservation service does not make sense,"The food is great. My overseas friends loved the shimmering sand crab. It is a family orientated restaurant and the waiting staff service were great and polite too.

I have to comment on how the restaurant manages reservations and walk in customers. Since I had overseas guests visiting, I thought I should make reservations to prevent them from waiting too long. When we got to the restaurant, there were two lines - one for walk ins and one for reservations. Instead of any priority given to the guests with reservations, the restaurant alternate between walk in and reservation. If that is the case, then what is the point of anyone making any reservations at all? We had to wait about 30 minutes before we were seated.

Other than that, I think this place has great food. Great crabs."
Birthday Celebration,"The crab bee hoon standard has dropped, not sure if the chef is different or what. Will not order it again."
Uncle Leong,Fresh and good crab and other dishes is also good! Worth the visit and will definitely return again. Most probably the best crab restaurant in Singapore
Nice and pleasant to enjoy the Dinner,"Food is nice and delicious. Service is also very good, both the waiter and waitress were very polite. Provide good advise and recommendation in term of the quantity of food for the right no. of people. Atmosphere is great inside and spacial to move around. The crab was fresh and price was reasonable, all the dishes was delicious and it was an enjoyable dinner throughout the night. There is one thing missing as there was no complementary parking provided. There are other dishes have not try and will go back again to try different type of Crab in the menu."
Uncle leong crab,"Must ti try the shimmering , chilli crabs. Super nice. Perfect to go with the buns. Three eggs veggies is a must to eat. N the fish over there is very fresh. Ask for steam de."
Still very good,Try the crab bee hoon soup. crab is very fresh. value for money. nice ambience facing the greenery. the coffee ribs is tasty but the coffee aroma can be stronger
Crab was excellent,Chilli crab with Mantou was excellent. Guiness pork ribs were good too. However I advised anyone visiting the place wear mosquito patch there. I got 4 huge nasty bites on both my legs.
Food and services are good,We have ordered shimmering sand crab taste good.. butter sauce with light pepper and curry leaves :)
Good food. Excellent service,"When my friends from overseas requested for me to bring them to a seafood place I frequent, I knew I had to choose Uncle Leong. And we were not disappointed. My friends loved the food. And service was really prompt and friendly."
Great food and ambience!,"Service was prompt and efficient, food came shortly after we ordered. Food was delicious. My family and I can’t wait to go back again :)"
"Good location, good food",Not crowded even on Friday night. Great customer service and great environment. Food wise is not bad.
Great food! Great experience!,"It was my first time experience to eat here, becoz of the huge crab. I also like the taste of cereal prawns, creamy butter crabs a good thumbs up. 👍"
Fresh seafood and value for money!,Although the location is abit far from the city centre it’s by the punggol waterway and has nice views. Food is very fresh and value for money. Really liked the golden sand crab! Very solid meat.
Nice foods especially delicious crab,It is a nice restaurant away from crowded place. Plenty of car parking space so no need to rush. Crab and seafood are nicely cooked and delicious.
Feast with overseas friends,Make a booking at the restaurant as wanted our overseas friends to have a feast with our local food especially our chilli crab and bee join crab. Never disappoint you with the friendly service and prompt responses. Have to say never been disappointed with them in terms of food quality and service. Only down side is the location which is a bit off.
So so only,The weekly family dinner brought us to this restaurant. The service crew were very good . We had many dishes. Three types of crab. Chilli . Pepper. And shimmering sand. The shimmering sand crabs was the best. Anyway the curry prawns was so blend. The tau fu was nothing to shout about. But the price that was paid did not justify the quality. I would say recommended if you have a steep pocket and a craving for shimmering sand crabs. It's just a name they put on. Nothing fantastic
Nice Ambiance,Food was served very promptly. Good service from the waiters and waitresses. They served us free desserts because it was a birthday celebration for my sister. Nice gesture.
"Friendly Staffs, Great Crab, Noisy Environment","I would say the staffs are very friendly and helpful. Love the chilli crab, it was our expectation. The chai po steam fish was disappointed. Fish served cold and was not fresh. The place is very noisy, we could hardly hear each other, so it is not a good place for business chat."
"Big crabs, great taste and satisfying!","My colleagues and I had a great time dining at Uncle Leong and will definitely come back again!
A few things we ordered were: creamy butter crab, black pepper crab and cereal prawns, all of which were very nice :) and oh, the staff service was great too :)"
Recommendation,The crew service well. The environment still consider quite nice. The food still can be improve and also the price can be slightly more reasonable.
