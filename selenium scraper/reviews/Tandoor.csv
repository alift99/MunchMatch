Terrible service - anti customer restaurant,"Terrible service - anti customer restaurant....I made a reservation and 8 days before I was due to go they cancelled it without even talking to me or saying why! I just got an email which may as well have said that we don't want your kind in our restaurant, maybe they don't like mohawks or don't like certain kinds of customers....

Apparently it was because I hadn't picked up a call from an unknown number (which no one does in Singapore) which turned out to be them! But why would you cancel a reservation 8 days out because someone doesn't answer a call when they have already confirmed it?

Bizarre service. Clearly they don't want customers."
Great experience,Tandoor at Holiday Inn has reopened. We had dined there Sunday 17th. January 2021. The food and the service was good. Special thanks goes to the staff and chefs
Ta$$$ty!,"Nice ambience. Tasty North Indian food. Good service. Friendly staff.
$$$. Hard to find. Were it not for a hotel staff who showed us the way we would have missed it despite being there. It is located in the basement of the Holiday Inn."
Located inside the Holiday,"Located inside the Holiday Inn you find this gem! The food that was serves to us was outstanding , explosion of all these wonderful flavors! Starting from the appetizer all the way to the desert !! This of course was complimented by the superb service!! Highly recommended"
Great Indian Food,"This restaurant is at Holiday Inn Hotel and is a fine dine restaurant. As the new suggest it Specilaizes in Indian Tandoori food/Mughlai food.

We were a big group of 30-40 ppl and the service was good. We tried their veg, non veg snacks, main course and everything was good.

A great place to be at."
"Nice place, quality food","This place does not disappoint when it comes to fine dining Indian cuisine. The quality of seats, and cutlery and nice ambient surrounding.

The quality of ingredients can be tasted in their dishes. The price was a bit high with a standard service charge, but nothing unexpected."
Hosted an office party at maharaja suite,"Tandoor continues to impress me in terms of quality of food, ambience and service. I have hosted events multiple times and have always been impressed with guests equally raving about food and service.

In particular Nitin the assistant manager is amazing, very helpful and customer focused, taking care of every minute detail.

Thanks you Nitin and Holiday Inn. We had a great time."
NOT PLEASED AT ALL,"Very unfortunate of us to have experienced a rather opposite review from the rest of the people here with their waiter Boon Leong. 6 of us had visited the restaurant for last Sunday Dinner whereby I had made prior reservations. 2 of them were very special guests of ours from overseas and I truly wanted to impress them.However upon reaching, and informing of our reservations, he obviously had no prepared table and went to adjust tables for 6 of us at the corner we chose. That was still fine enough for us. However upon sitting we had to wait and wait for someone to take our order. Again Boon Leong just robotically came to our table to take orders and can see the impatience on his face. Serving was done in the same manner and for again asking the menu to choose dessert it took so much time and we had to request 3 times. That we still silently tolerated. By the way the restaurant was not full at all and only 4 tables were being served at that time. Anyways we just ate quietly and when the time came to make the payment. I quietly tried to signal to him through my phone app of my chope vouchers which i had purchased earlier.He so rudely announced loudly that his phone could not read the QR code and refuse to help in anyways. My son immediately showed him how its done on his phone and he had to again loudly say he will deduct $200 !!. OMG that was the last bit. i could not take it anymore and had to tell him how embarrassing it was for us. It became so awkward truly. The last time will we ever bring our special guest to this restaurant. Apart from Fine dining we expect some Fine service too. Maybe he thought we were just locals and not very much deserve good service!! Truly dissappointed!"
Very pleasant revisit in January 2020.,"We have been to the Indian buffet previously & had a great experience. This visit was just the same. Good variety of dishes to sample & very nice flavours. The food is fresh & the dosas & some other dishes are made as you request them.
The friendly, attentive staff top off the experience. They even suggest some dishes to consider trying.
The cost is commensurate with the experience.
Will return again on our next visit to Singapore."
Awesome Service and Great food,"Before 2 weeks, i was in Holiday Inn with my friends to eat vegetarian food in Indian Restaurant called Tandoor. And i had very nice experience with food and service. When I entered the restaurant, a chinese man welcomed us very nicely. Having a chinese person in Indian Restaurant shocked us first. And then we confused to choose a nice vegetarian dishes from menu. After then the same Chinese guy helped and explained everything very nicely with a smiling face. That was really awesome to have knowledge about Indian dishes as a Chinese person. His name is Mr. Boon Leong. And He was very good in his service. We like not only his service but also his friendly attitude towards customers.
Food was also very delicious. So i can say that i will again visit this restaurant because of nice food and nice service.

Thanks,
Viraj Rajput"
Great food and standard service,"We visited Tandoor with the entire family. The food was super tasty and amazing. Even the Thali preparation was superb. Hospitality was bang on. Mr. Boon Leong was very helpful and helped us decide what we should order. The vegetarian thali was very good. I had super awesome time at tandoor,
Thank you Mr.Boon ."
"Great food, ambience, service and overall experience!","Got to know of this place when I attended an Indian Wedding at Holiday Inn Hotel. They catered the wedding buffet and was blown away at the quality and spread of the food.

Came back with some overseas friends just for the Indian buffet spread. We enjoyed the entire experience, my guest loved the entire variety as this was their first time trying so many different Indian dishes. Truth be told, some dishes were new to me too. Loved the decor and also the ambience of the entire place.

Shoutout to Boon Leong and Harzot (I hope I got his name right) for the wonderful hospitality and also conversations. We really appreciate you guys. All in all great value for groups and wonderful experience."
Good option for fine dining,"It is situated inside the hotel Holiday inn. With very less options for Indian cuisine near busy orchard road, it is a good and quite place for fine dining. Little expensive but given the ambience and location it's justified. You can opt for buffet
Only down side was their service. It is so slow that it kills your appetite. They should really consider increasing their staff.
Reservation on weekends is advisable. Their starter 'Aloo ki nazakat' is a must. They serve free chips in beginning which was very different than regular 'papad'. Cutlery is very stylish and clean. They provide with hot towel at the end which is very thoughtful."
Rude waiter and far below standard service,"My Bf and I came in and was served by the Chinese waiter, Boon Leong. When we asked him about entertainer app he showed his face of annoyance and explain the first page for vegetarian dishes, we asked him if there is any meat. He uses his index finger and pointed to my bf saying, let me explain to you. This act is extremely rude to any customer.
When he served the food to table he just literally put it on the table and walked away without adjusting the table setting to fit the dishes properly.

Upon paying, I opened the app and couldn’t find the restaurant to get the code he stood there and make a loud “tzek” sound and walk to the next table. When he came back, my bf hand him the cc and he just grab it from his hand and walk away.

My glass for water was emptied for a while (10 mins) and we have to ask the waiter to please pour us more water. He brought the jug and pour it very hurriedly and you can see the water splash out.

Such a Low standard in providing services in a 4stars hotel, felt like the coffee shop uncle is more attentive and polite than this waiter.

Extremely disappointing"
"Tasty food, slow service","From very beginning we got feeling waiters were only working here, not really serving customers. Every step we need to wait. Luckily food was good, however not the best indian food, I have been eating."
Great experience.. fine Indian dining,"We thoroughly enjoyed the sunday lunch buffet at Tandoor!
The menu was interesting, food was very tasty and appetizing supported by professional service.
Good for a special occasion or if craving for authentic north Indian cuisine."
Tandoori Dinner,"We ordered the a mixed seafood Tandoori plater, lady's finger (good recommended by the staff), dal curry, 2 Naan, 1 rice. The food quality and freshness are excellent esp the Tandoori prawn and fish. Unlike the strong spice and curry flavor which is common in most Indian food I find the cooking here taste more natural with only a small hint of spices. Overall we rate the food and ambience to be 4/5 except it is quite pricey. One portion of white rice or Naan cost $15. The total bill came up to around $200 (with 17% service and GST) for 3 persons"
The best Indian restaurant in Singapore!,An old favourite! Always try to go there on very special occasions or when we have special guests. Never disappoints! The service is always great.
Fact of the matter !!......Never order vegetarian dishes,"I have been to this restaurant twice and this review is based on my last visit this year. My first visit (in September 2018) with my vegetarian guests was a nightmare!.....both in terms of service and the quality of the food. In my first visit there was a certain waiter who for some unknown reason appeared to be totally inattentive from the moment my guests read out the vegetarian dishes that they wish to eat from the menu. Is it because they ordered vegetarian dishes ??...I don't know....but from that point onwards his service became tardy.

I remember that he brought the breads first and kept them on the table and went back to the kitchen purportedly to get the dishes to go with it. However he did not and instead was focusing on another table which appeared to be having more guests and who had ordered some non-vegetarian dishes as I could see from my table.

Eventually he did serve us but by that time the breads in the basket became cold. Apparently it seemed as if he was ""looking down upon"" my vegetarian colleagues as if they were ""sinners"" for not being meat eaters !! ;)

To cut the story short my vegetarian friends left with a poor impression about this supposedly ""high end"" premier restaurant.

Coincidentally, the same story was repeated on my second visit (in May this year) with another group of vegan office colleagues that I had accompanied. I believe it was the same or some other waiter (I can""t remember) who attended to our table.

Hence I conclude that if anyone ever comes to this restaurant its better not to order vegetarian dishes alone and subsequently get charged premium, ""5 star prices"" for shoddy service and poor quality dishes !!....Although, ironically, Indian cuisine is replete with many interesting and delicious vegetarian dishes loved and admired around the world !"
A Suitable Finer Indian Dining Experience,"I've been to the Tandoor several times and they have not failed to impress. Whether it is to host foreign business guests or family friends, Tandoor does provide a suitably sophisticated ambience. Although it can be a bit more pricey, it will leave a good impression with friends and business partners. We had their set dinner for $68 per head, and it came with a delicious starter, a good variety of mains, and 3 deserts. The service staff were excellent, and were empowered to provide an additional dessert that we had wanted to try as well."
Best in India we've had in Singapore,"authentic, hot oven -> fresh roti and dosa; great selection; they surprised us with a birthday cake at the end. Would go back in a heartbeat"
Not worth the salt,Poor. The food was too dry for our liking. Service was rather shoddy and the Chinese waiter was curt and cold. Never coming back!
Love Food and Friendly Service,We have dined here before when staying at the hotel. The service was very good and friendly. Would recommend the Lamb Chops and Mutton Curry and of course the signature dish of this restaurant is the Mango Curry I would just go to this restaurant for the Mango Curry I told our waiter this and he then went and printed out a copy of the recipe for it. Thanks very much.
Best Indian Restaurant at Orchard Singapore,"Since 1985 Tandoor an award-winning Indian restaurant in Singapore has offered a carefully handcrafted dish using classic recipes and time-honoured methods which date back in time across India’s rich history. The beautiful interior design has a story behind it, Full-length windows give diners an intimate view of the kitchen where two custom-made copper tandoors (or clay ovens) stand. From the dining hall, you will be able to see our chefs at work, from making Indian breads to preparing kebabs of tandoori meats and vegetables that are served fresh to your table, presents an inviting atmosphere where you can enjoy good food and great conversations with family, friends and clients alike."
"Used to be a good place, but no more!","Tandoor has had excellent reviews in the past and used to be known for good food and service. No more. We went there for lunch on Thursday (couple) and were really disappointed with our experience when we ordered a simple executive set lunch (vegetarian). First, the chinese waiter who took our order was in a hurry to take away the menu-he did not explain anything to us and then he was completely inattentive to us, much more attentive to a bunch of visitors on the table next to us.
Then when we made requests to the (new) indian waiter- he was clueless as to WHAT they were serving us. He was a good man trying to be helpful, but just completely untrained. He did bring us papads when we asked him. But then when we asked what the kebab was made of, he said it's non-vegetarian and scared us! Then he checked with the kitchen, came back and said it was vegetarian. Then we asked him if we will get rice later on, he said yes, so we held on with some of the dal etc. (which were served in very small 'katoris'- and only at the very end we realised that we could have asked for refills-which of course no one told us at the beginning!). Anyway, we kept waiting and then he comes back and says no, rice is not part of the set meal.
Then we asked if we can get rotis- he said it's two per person so did we get it? We said we were served two across both of us-so he said he will go in and get. Then he comes back and says no, sorry, it's one per person! I was getting tired- still said ok, get it, we will pay for it. So he came back with that.
As for the food itself -we had one soup, one kebab, one dal, one mango based vegetable (sweet, decent) and one paneer vegetable-the paneer was really hard and really not tasty.
Throughout all this, the MAIN waiter who took our order never bothered to ask us if we needed anything, instead he was more interested in clearing our trays! So even though he could SEE that my wife had not finished her soup while I had, he came in to take it away-and she told him to hold on! REALLY Pathetic service.
At the very end, the manager came around asking 'I trust the food was ok'? with half a leg ready to step out- he never expected us to say anything other than OK or good. Very insincere attempt to ask for feedback. H stopped in his tracks when we did give him feedback in a very calm tone. He said he would take it up with the staff, and then asked us if we wanted more food etc. We said no, we were good.
He said ok, your dessert will come- kulfi. He goes away, and it took them 10 minutes to get kulfi! That too after I followed up with the main waiter who-without thinking-said-it's coming. Still took 5 more minutes to get a kulfi which is surely just waiting in the fridge to be served, since it's not freshly made!!
Another lead manager came around at the end, apologising for our experience and asking if we wanted masala tea, we said no thank you, asked for the bill and left.
We are surely not coming back. This was our second attempt- we wanted to give it a chance and were looking forward to a better experience, but it just left a bad taste in the mouth-literally and figuratively too!!"
EXCELLENT FOOD,"I think you can not get such good Indian food in Singapore elsewhere.
Very calm and nice fine dining.
Prices are bit higher but looking to ambiance it is very reasonable.
Taste is really very good and same the presentation is.
Must try there chicken dishes and deserts.
I was staying at holiday inn where this restaurant is situated.
I dont clearly remember the name but I think it was Mr. Vikas a well educated and very nice in behavior man was really good in suggesting us the food options for kids.
Thanks a lot to all staff"
Awful experience,My family and I have been a very loyal guest of this restaurant since almost 10 years now. Giving them business almost every week as well. But unfortunately my last experience absolutely changed everything. The food and service was horrible! The food was so bad that I left half the food and came back home and ended up throwing up thrice. Mr. Boon (server) from this restaurant used to be very nice but I think now he is just a moody man and does not care at all. In fact his service and way of talking really makes us feel like we are beggars. Don't go here! Go to Yantra if you are looking for good quality food and service
Great food spoilt by the clientele,"This is a great restaurant, hidden in the basement of the Holiday inn. The food is marvellous, with a regular speciality the Tandoori fish dish

It’s a shame that what i considered 5 star really is now operating as a 2 star.

This is due to the management failure to control their guests children who last night were abominable.

I know it should be the responsibility of parents, but 2 large groups had no control of screaming and yelping children using the restaurant as a playground last night.

21:30 on a Saturday night should not be the place for parents and management to let this happen!!!"
Wonderful Indian taste,Not to be missed while in Singapore. The food is like at home. There are plenty of choice and the chef makes one if not in the menu.
"Lovely Ambiance , tasty food , BUT EXPENSIVE","PROS :

1) Calm Ambiance

2) Staff is well mannered ,

3) food is tasty (tikka , daal makhni , jeera rice , recommended )

Cons :

1) way to expensive , ( i know singapore is expensive , but this is too much )

2) we , 4 people eat there , (dinner ) , we order the prawns , tikka , daal makhni , rice and dum aloo , and the bill was around 400 dollars , wowww , addition of taxes and service charges ,

3) they said , 20% discount for guest staying in Holiday-inn hotel , but when I order the food in my room , there was no discount , , only discount if u dine-in , , otherwise NO , this was really weird ,"
"Terrible service, horrible atmosphere. Do not recommend.",The service staff was extremely disorganized and not proactive. We had to ask multiple times for what we needed. We visited on New Year's Eve and were made to order the set menu (understandable) but the food was slow (we waited an hour for the appetizers and for the mains) and the food was only averaged and offered very little value for money. The acoustics were also abysmal and a big crowd in the restaurant made it absolutely unbearable to be there. There are plenty more Indian restaurants in Singapore that offer much better quality of food and value for money. This is not one of them.
Best North Indian food,Great north indian food.. Good options for vegetarians..Perhaps better than what restaurants in India serve. Must visit!!
Indian Restaurant that dates back over 30 years,"It has been a long while since I ate at Tandoor and although the food and service is really good, there are so many new Indian restaurants that have sprung up over the years that it needs to re-invent itself. The service is exceptional but without the clientele the dining room feels pretty empty and forlorn. Also located in the basement of the Holiday Inn means it doesn't even get the footfall."
Don't waste your money,I order the chicken curry and 2 other vegetable items. I spent 100 dollars. There were only 4 pieces of chicken in the 40 dollar curry and the vegetables were only half full in the pint container.
Authentic Indian Food,This is a very well located and spacious restaurant to enjoy authentic Indian cuisines in Singapore. Needs special mention of Mr Boon Kong (Service) who was very courteous and efficient during our visit to the restaurant..
Michelin-starred prices for below average food,"The prices on the menu is nothing short of daylight robbery: $15 for a small bowl of basmati rice, a staggering $20 for 6 bite sized samosas. The restaurant is not a Michelin-starred one and in any case $15 for rice is just purely a rip-off. A word to management: customers are NOT dumb!

The food: ordered rice, garlic naan, samosas and 3 mains (dal tadka, aloo ghobi and sheekh kebab). The rice was dry, garlic naan was under-cooked with NO garlic (shocking!). The dal tadka was served lukewarm with a strand of hair floating at the top (the horror!). The cauliflower and potatoes in the aloo ghobi was soggy with a hint of staleness.

Will not be returning again. My advice: Avoid like the plague"
"Good food, ambience, service",I've been visiting this restaurant regularly and am never disappointed. The food taste is good and consistent.
Reservation not honoured despite confirmation,"The reservation was for at 12 noon and once we reached the place, they told that they are overbooked."
Amazing!,"The Sunday brunch is so good! It’s totally worth it. Live counters,brilliant taste, awesome staff. It’s a must go restraunt. It has become a ritual for me to get my guests visiting from India to this restraunt and trust me, the decision always proves right. I’d highly recommend this if you are looking for good food, beautiful ambience and amazing experience.
Thanks!"
Delivery,"Ordered chicken dum biryani and murtaban gosht with 2 naan for delivery through Deliveroo. Below average taste, highly inaccurate description of food. Both quantity and quality very under whelming! Indian mama stalls serve much better Indian food.
Highly over priced for the quality received. Will never order again"
A very underwhelming experience,"We just went for a birthday dinner and ordered their five course set meal - a vegetarian and a non vegetarian. The starter was a really poorly made samosa in corn base and a ketchupy gravy - it just didn’t work. The soups were actually nice. The vegetarian kebabs were extremely unimpressive, bland and sans any creativity. The only good thing in kebabs was the lamb chop! The main course was unbelievably poor. Gravies tasted all the same, stale and were a complete put off. I am a complete dessert person and was hoping a lot from it but again was disappointed with all the three items on the plate.

Moreover the ambiance of the place is quite dull - in basement with no windows and next to conference halls. Would not recommend."
Good food good service,"Really appreciate the good service at Tandoor, of course complemented by the good food. Have to say that the Indian desserts are not really our cup of tea (we are Chinese) but they seem quite authentic from our inexperienced perspective. Try this place out!"
Worth every cent,"@TheKuoKnows

This is probably one of the classiest North Indian restaurants in Singapore. From the moment you enter to the time you leave, the service is faultless.

The food is a cut above the rest too. The Nimbu Murg Tikka was wonderfully succulent. The Seekh Kebab was outstandingly tender.

The Classic Mutton Curry was in a league of its own. Fragrant and spicy but not overpoweringly hot. Loved the Naan bread too. There’s nothing quite like bread fresh from the oven.

Tandoor is not cheap. Good things rarely are. But it’s worth every cent."
Disappointing evening,"I had previously dined at Tandoor with local Chinese friends a couple of months ago and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I therefore didn't hesitate to book the restaurant when my niece and sister-in-law, who were visiting from Sydney, said they would like to eat Indian.

What a contrast with my previous experience.

When seating us at our table, the waiter passed us two menus - one containing the set menus and the other being the 'a la carte' menu. Once we realised this I asked if we could have three 'a la carte' menus: a second was reluctantly provided after quite a wait.

We proceeded to place our order including a chicken curry. The waiter's response: words to the effect of '...that is not a good choice as it has a whole green chilli...'. I said that wasn't a problem but he was adamant in trying to get me to change our order - in an almost condescending manner. In the end I pointed out that as we'd eaten street food including stuffed peppers in India we were perfectly capable of handling a dish with a single chilli so he reluctantly accepted the order.

Perhaps it was the fact that we were three 'ang mo' ladies so he assumed we were all tourists and hence needed to be told what curries to eat. Why assume that all 'ang mo' diners are not familiar with, or cannot tolerate, spicy Indian food?

In the event, the chicken curry was quite bland - in spite of the single green chilli. The remaining dishes were okay, but it is difficult to see value in $12 for a single bowl of plain white rice.

There are many good Indian restaurants in Singapore so I'll not be rushing to take other visitors to Tandoor."
Great Food and Service,We have dined here before when we have been staying at the Holiday Inn. The food is lovely especially the Mango Curry we also had the fish in Banana Leaves which I would recommend. Service is excellent. Would also recommend the Lamb Chops they are very tasty. It is not a cheap restaurant but the food is well worth the money. It is a must when we are in Singapore.
Great Food and Good Service,Food was excellent. Recommended the chicken tandoori and the breads. The lamb was very tender in the curry. The Goan fish curry is also worth a try. Good place to bring people for a special occasion.
Fine Dining Indian Restaurent,"I have been here many times. This is one of the best Indian restaurants in the central area. Overpriced, but the food is very good. Ajwaini macchi (Fish tikka) is heavenly. We loved their mutton biriyani, baingan bharta (Oven-roasted eggplant minced and cooked with onions and tomatoes), Malmali sheekh kebab (Spiced lamb mince rolls flavoured with fresh Indian herbs and spices, skewered and cooked in Tandoor)."
Try the Tandoori Fish mmmmmmmm,"It’s just a quick comment on the great quality you deliver at this restaurant

The highlight always for me is the Tandoori fish. It’s a must do experience

Keep up the good work"
Ridiculous,We ordered a starter main course and naan. Food was ok but the things were ridiculously overpriced considering the amount they served. Never Coming Back here again. There are many more restaurants that served less priced food with the same quality
Ridiculously overpriced,"I was really looking forward to eating here after a recommendation from a friend and we went on Friday night. There were 4 of us and we ordered the tandoori mixed meat platter and the tandoori vegetarian mixed platter, a daal, a crab masala, garlic naan and rice. When they brought the two tandoori platters i thought there was a mistake as they were so small and the waiter said these were appetizers. I asked for the menu again as i wanted to check as i didn't see the option of this dish as an appetiser instead of a main course. When i pointed out the dish to the waiter he said that was what he had served us. The cost for this single ridiculous dish, 60 dollars without tax. It was pathetic i could have eaten the whole plate myself, it consisted of 3 limp pieces of chicken and fish, 2 shrimps and one sausage cut into 3 pieces. The equally small vegetarian version was 45 dollars, the one piece of garlic naan was 12 dollars. Anyway I thought I would warn fellow diners, expect high prices and in the case of these two dishes, very average taste."
A convenient Location BUT Service levels needs improvments,"Whilst you are at teh Hotel this is a convenient place.

Please make a booking in Advance.

The service levels needs to improve in terms of taking the correct order,
getting the right dishes and serving."
"The best in Singapore, but overpriced.","Tandoor is my go to restaurant for home delivery as they use the very best quality ingredients (which I don't mind paying for) and little or no food colouring which I'm allergic to (especially red from insects) and I don't find any issue with the food from Tandoor. The flavours are to die for and their Jhinga Jalandhari (even at 48 dollars per dish delivery) is my favourite. It's a beautiful mix of fresh prawns and bell peppers in a wonderful rich masala sauce with just the perfect amount of heat.

We normally add in a tarka dhal and some wonderful spiced potatoes (Aloo Jeera Kastori Methi), some naan and rice for the perfect meal.

On the subject of the rice and the reason this is a 4 star review and not a 5+... I don't mind paying for quality but 14.98 dollars for a portion of steamed rice (basmati or not) isn't really acceptable when others are selling it at 4.50 or below... Again, I'll pay, and can afford to pay, whatever it takes for proper quality, but plain steamed rice is plain steamed rice. I'd strongly advice you reconsider your pricing on this one dish..."
Food,The food was great. There was lot of variety in the buffet. Both the options in the vegetarian food and non vegetarian food were good.
Tandoor - A great cuisine experience!,We ordered the set dinner and it was wonderful! Everything freshly cooked in the tandoor open kitchen. Even my kids loved it! We will be back!
Authentic Indian food,Authentic Indian food and the naan is light and fluffy. Butter chicken is just nice - not too rich or watery - and sauce is delicious with naan.
Excellent,"Went there for a business dinner with colleagues. Very nice ambience, attentive and responsive staff and very good food. We had vegetarian food only, it was great. Would recommend this as a top Indian restaurant in Singapore."
Good Indian buffet & great service,"We attended the Sunday buffet without a reservation. The venue wasn't busy at all.
This is a very good restaurant. Very nice ambience.
The service staff were very friendly, attentive & offered suggestions on what to try (if you weren't sure & asked). Their knowledge of the food was very good too.
There was a very good variety of dishes available from meat, fish & chicken to vegetarian. The buffet caters to most tastes & the curries aren't too hot. They also serve dishes from the tandoori oven.There were several different rice dishes & you could order different types of dosas & naans as well.
There was also a good array of desserts that you could try.
All the food was fresh & flavoursome.
We really enjoyed the meal in a relaxed atmosphere. Needless to say, none of us could even think of dinner that evening.
I would definitely return on my next trip to Singapore & plan to be there on a Sunday!
Great non-intrusive service & good food. The cost is not cheap but is commensurate with the experience."
Poor communication skills on waiter's part,"While the food (Gourmet 5-course) was generally enjoyable and up to standard, my friend and I were shocked to find the overall bill to be twice what we expected. We found out what we had been served had been the equivalent of two 5-courses. Even though we had asked the waiter while ordering if the 5-course was ""enough for two people"" and he had indicated it was, the waiter recorded our order as two portions. Whether it is incompetency on the part of the waiter or otherwise, my friend and I left the restaurant in a sour mood since we ended up forking out way more than we expected."
Top notch Indian Cuisine,If not for some vouchers I probably would not have found out about this place. Lucky I did. Top notch Indian food! Had a Naan basket and the different flavours were all good. The palek paneer was a stand out. I could not finish it but we packed the left overs and gobbled it all up the next day. It was that good. Highly recommended!
Food is just ok but the service is good.,"I didn't find anything exceptional in this resto except maybe that its a little bit pricey. Food served on time, accommodating in our requests since we have kids with us."
Best Indian food in Singapore,Have been coming here since past 2 years during my trip to singapore. The quality of food has been maintained and is just excellent. The menu is limited but it has the best dishes. Authentic indian food and the staff is too good.
Excellent service and food,Excellent service and food with wide variety with many options even for vegetarians! Desserts were also very delicious. Most pleasant Indian food brunch!
A place to be,"Great Indian Food,
Traditional north and South Indian Food. Price Range, ok
My Singaporean Friends say, the best one in town. But there is another one around the corner. I love all of them."
Excellent Indian lunch,"We had a family event here with 20+ people and enjoyed the Indian dishes served very much. Very authentic, great spice, very fine presentation and delicious taste. A highlight in SG ...."
Poor man would be shown the door at Tandoor,"We went here over twenty years ago, when it was one of the better Indian restaurants in Singapore. How times have changed! The food is still pretty good - the crab masala is delicious, other dishes less unique but above average. However, although there were only 3 occupied tables when we were there, the (extremely polite) service staff were remarkably absent. The décor is dated, and the restaurant is located in a dreary basement of a fairly depressing hotel. At the high price they charge, one would be spoiled for choice in Singapore (Rang Mahal, Song of India, Punjab Grill, Yantra, etc)."
Good food,"This restaurant is in the basement of Holiday Inn Hotel, which has plentiful car park spaces normally. It has always been known for good food, and the chef did not disappoint during our visit today. The service was good, and toilet very clean. We ordered many dishes, and they were almost all good. The chicken tikka was tender and fragrant, so was the cod, and kebab. The butter chicken was good. Somehow we felt the palak paneer and Keema was not to our taste."
Excellent Tandoor Appetizers,"***Recommended***

Away from my country, did not expect much, the hospitality at this place was very good. We had variety of tandoor based appetizer. All of them excellent.
The Chicken Biryani was a sheer disappointment."
I am travelling in Singapore often since 1993.,Tandoor is one of the very famous Indian vegetarian and non-vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. Location is very convenient. Restaurant environment is lively. Really manus of Tandoor are specially like everyone .
Pricey but good,"We were surprised at how high the prices were at Tandoor but we really enjoyed the food (butter chicken, saffron rice and naan)."
Dinner with friends,"Dinning at Tandoor is always a lovely experience. The food, the service and the ambience is awesome."
Excellent food and nice service,If you are looking for Indian food this place is among the best! They serve best of Vegetarian and non vegetarian food.
A satisfying experience,"As this was my first visit to the restaurant since its renovation some 3 years ago , I find the ambience nice and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and helpful particularly with regard to the number and appropriate type of dishes to order to complement naan . The food turned out to be well balanced authentic and satisfying."
Good Food but service not so much,We had been here for a team dinner. The staff somehow was not welcoming and gave a condescending impression initially. But later they were quite helpful in suggesting what to order. The food was quite delicious but the delivery was very delayed. It was delayed even for the drinks.
Excellent food with good service,"Good choice of food to whet our appetite. Curry just nice for my family, not too spicy. Tandoori chicken is our favourite"
Really decent Indian food.,"I usually make it to tandoor once a month these days if not more and they have consistently been good when it comes to north Indian food.
My last visit was just this week with my parents who were in town for a short while. We ordered palak paneer, yellow dal, paneer starter, rice and different breads. Every single thing was done well. High light of the evening though was gulkand ras malai! Highly recommended, if you are craving an authentic Indian fare..."
Amazing food in a perfect setting!,Always love to dine at Tandoor. Food is fabulous and the ambience is amazing. Service was good . Location is in the heart of the city.
Tandoor Restaurant Review,Had lunch together with the family. Cannot fault the service. Waiters were attentive and the head manger provided excellent service. Was dissapointed with the Biryani though. Was basically cooked rice covered in curry sauce. Not what you would expect for a restaurant claiming traditional cooking techniques. Other dishes ordered were excellent.
First Visit,"Pro: Good ambience, The Naan was excellent, so was the Mango curry
Con: The Mango Lassi was extremely sweet and the Spinach dish was salty
Service: Cold"
Vermav,Its very tasty food and excelkent service by staff which delighted to come again and sgsin for dining
Excellent food and nice range of veg food,Food was excellent. We prefer veg and menu has nice range of veg food options. if restaurant can have some activity for toddlers that will be great. Something like coloring etc.
Exquisite,"Love the food, exquisite fine dining North Indian cuisine. Level of spicy chilly adjusted to my non-chilly taste buds. Use eatigo app to get discounts"
Splendid Indian cuisine and exceptional service,"We had no idea what is good at Tandoor, and honestly slightly afraid of trying authentic indian cuisine. But since Tandoor is so highly rated, there must be something excellent about them.

The decor was opulent and modernly designed. When we arrived, there are only 3 tables filled with guests. We did not engage the assistance of servers, instead we browse through instagram and tripadvisor to understand what is popular among guests who had dine here.
We decided on tender lamb shanks served in mild curry, fresh spinach, accompanied by some butter naan and basmati rice.

We did not anticipate that the spinach was so peppery hot, we spent most of our time trying to put out the heat in our tongue. However, the spinach was tasty and fantastic despite being pepperish. Our actions probably caught the attention of the chefs, and they sent a server over to see how we are doing. He understand that the spinach was too much for our taste buds and insisted on changing it to Mango curry, compliment from Tandoor. We were so caught by surprise with the kind gesture, despite repeatedly declining the offer.

In conclusion, we would prefer the spinach to the mango curry, only because of personal preferences as mango is not our most favourite fruit. The butter naan was buttery, the lamb shanks were so tender and succulent, it wasn't at all dry."
Lunch at Tandoor with family n friend,"Having lunch at Tandoor is always a very pleasant visit outside home. The food is delicious, light, the staff very polite and service oriented."
Excellent Food and Service,"I arranged a party for my Daughter's Birthday and indeed happy to share the feedback that the service and food was Excellent. Special Thanks to Satyendra, Nitin and Ravindra for thier Support."
Always pampering service,Great Indian food with excellent and consistent service. The Sunday buffet brunch is one the best Indian buffet selection.
Great Indian curry in heart of Singapore,One of the restaurant where you can have a peaceful lunch or dinner with family peacefully in a nice ambience. Great vegetarian food options. Mangalore mango curry is an all time favourite and a speciality at this place. One should try all chef specials and desserts! Great service and they have maintained the quality over the years...
Sunday brunch is very good,"We had Sunday brunch many times here. The food quality, taste, temperature and variety is just excellent."
Food and ambience was worth more than it was,Good tasty Indian food that left our tummies feeling the right amount of full. Surprised that the bill was well within the budget for what we experienced.
Fantastic food and great service. Expensive.,"We had dinner at Tandoor with a large party of friends for a birthday, and the service and food were delicious, authentic and classy.

The buffet and portions were very resonable, but the star of the show was the Fish Tandoori - amazingly succulent and delicate.

One of the best Indian restaurants in Singapore. Highly recommended. Expect a price point commensurate with the high quality of the restaurant."
great food and warm service,"Food in Tandoor is always good, especially the butter chicken, paneer and the fish! the service was quite slow during this visit, but very warm and accomodating nonetheless"
50-50,"It is a mixed feeling - like some......if you are looking for best food, you could get disappointed."
Good and delicious brunch,We've been to Tandoor for Sunday brunch twice and love it. The fresh naan and dosas are fantastic. A large selection of meat and vegetarian curries plus briyani to enjoy. Free flow mango lassi as well and ice cream which was a hit with the kids. We highly recommend as this is one of the best in Singapore
Such a hospitable restaurant with delicious food!,"The experience was amazing and so was the food! Our waiter Boon Leong was great, paid attention to detail and so hospitable"
