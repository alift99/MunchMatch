Great Food & Ambiance!,"Food was great! The Mediterranean platter was a good choice for a light meal. Dessert of Poire Belle-Helene was just right! Raymond was very attentive, friendly and accommodating with our requests. Would most certainly recommend to friends!"
Lunch was amazing!,Food was amazing!! Just right amount of salt and flavours were on point. We were seated in a corner but Raymond and Jeffrey were very attentive.
Miss,"Amazing food! And fantastic service from Raymond and Jeffrey! We had the steak which was a perfect medium rare and the shrimp which was flavourful and generously portioned..

I also saw them taking in a large group from a neighbouring restaurant and offering them a place to sit for a drink while they wait-I’ve never seen such neighbourly spirit!

Great job and I’d highly recommend this cute spot!"
Lunch @loulou,"I took the 3 course set meal while my wife ordered the 2 course one. Sensing we want to share the food, the service staff , Raymond & Jeffrey were proactive in providing the necessary cutleries for that. The set meals are good values and nice."
French food for reunion dinner,"Food was amazing, service was really good too. Jeffrey is nice. And they kept the bread coming too !"
Well worth the visit! Highly recommended:)).,"The grilled octopus, prawns and seafood stew is delicious and the restaurant has a nice ambience. Good & friendly service by Raymond & Jeffrey. Will visit again😊."
Brunch with friends.,"Came to Lou Lou for a long overdue catch up with friends. We had the brunch and the free flow mimosa and Prosecco. Excellent service with these duo. Jeffrey and Raymond, thank you. We shall be back!"
A-list Service,"Who would have thought an inadvertent flight delay on a rainy Friday evening would land us the best dining experience in Singapore since moving back.

Thank you for the exceptional hospitality, Jeffrey & Raymond. You have raised the bar on superb service in a competitive industry. We will be back!"
Will definitely come back!,"Food was good - had stuffed calamari, fish and sharing board. Ambience was amazing, service was attentive."
Best experience. Perfect cuisine,This would be the best place to gather with your best friends! The cuisine is super French traditional!!!
Beautiful French fare,"Lou Lou Restaurant, Keong Saik: Gorgeous and miniscule Lou Lou is the sister restaurant of the tres cute Josephine which has 2 levels including a French le jardin outdoor seating. You won’t miss the romantic drapery and seating at the front of the restaurant. The interior is just as pleasing to the eye. It was puzzling why it was empty at lunch time as the food was pretty good. We had the set menu and the stand out dishes are Fregola pasta (the broth was so hearty) and the calamari (so perfectly grilled and tantalising in presentation). We turned the well executed strawberry mille feuille into a birthday cake. When it comes to good looks and elevated tastes, the French got it well patted down. #eatstylishtravelstylish"
Pleasant casual reasonably priced French bistro,"My wife and I had an enjoyable dinner at Loulous. The food had Mediterranean & Spanish influences. We shared the seafood bouillabaisse (signature dish) which was good, although I found a little too salty; and the stuffed cuttlefish with rice. Portions are generous, & prices reasonable. The place has a nice casual vibe, & service is friendly & helpful"
Good Service,"This’s first visit for us,we enjoyed very much Raymond & Jeffrey wonderful service and Good knowledge Thank you very much we will be back 🥰🥰🥰"

Bday treat,"Served by Raymond and he was helpful and amazing! The wine by glass list was interesting and definitely great for ppl who is looking for a place to just dine and chill! Food wise, not too keen on the sauce but gf really liked the lobster and asparagus!"

Loulou - good food and excellent service,Look for Raymond / Jeffrey they’ll give you VIP service and authentic southern french cuisine. Very good especially the steak and the shrimps + potato mash.
As good as in the best restaurants in France,Fantastic French cuisine. As good as in the best restaurants in France. We were in Singapore just for 3 days and decided to come back for the 2nd time to Loulou because we liked it so much. Service is very good too. Highly recommended.

Superb food and service,"Four of us booked New Year's Day lunch. Inside can get a bit noisy so we chose the outside table with sofa seating. Very comfortable under the fan and nicely shaded from the sun.
It was our first time here and thanks to Jeff, our restaurant host, who handled the reservation and made sure everything was spot on during the lunch.
The food is excellent and well priced. Same for the free-flow drinks packages.
We started off with the ample sharing platter -- cold cuts, dips, lots of bread and other extras, then had mains including fish and prawn skewers and stuffed aubergine. Then we moved on to dessert.
We really enjoyed Loulou, from the service and the food to the reasonable price. I highly recommend the restaurant. Handy location in the centre of town along Keong Saik Road, too. Looking forward to returning."
Great service and awesome food,"The best services! Thanks to Jeff,Ray, Eriq for making us feel like home! Definitely recommend and coming back for sure! Highly recommended! The food was amazing too!!!"

Great food!,"Had the truffle risotto and it was amazing! The staffs are great! Jeff, ray and eriq had great vibes!"
First Visit,"This was the conclusion to our Christmas/New Year's culinary events.
Luckily ending on a high note. Although we were expecting Lunch it turned out to be Brunch menu, many of the mains were from the charcoal grill, which we had actually cancelled Josephine's due to that fact! I was also disappointed there was a lack of true French classic dishes.
However we had Gaspacho (Spanish) for starters which was delicious! fresh with great taste and texture including a few twists to the original that were inspired.
We then had the monkfish kebab which was excellent and again took me to Spain!
So a more accurate description would have been Mediterrean or Catalan cooking.
Throughout the service was excellent, and very engaging. Quite and some excellent French music at a good level.
the final desserts were huge, a beautiful new Year's eve chestnut puree creation and a Sundae which I should not eat but was totally out of this world, reminded me of America. Although our first experience at this relatively new restaurant, it certainly won't be our last!"
New Year Brunch,"The food is absolutely lovely, great experience with friendly staff recommended by Raymond
Great job to Jeffrey and Eric,awesome food,thank you for the Chefs making a great food,I will highly recommend it to my friends and colleagues,and definitely come more to this place,happy new year"

Fantastic food and great service,"Santos really looked after us, we had a great time with good food and company. This is a great place to hang out on a lazy Sunday afternoon, relaxed and unpretentious. Highly recommended."
Simply the perfect place to chill and enjoy great food,"Delicious food, super nice staff, great music and wonderful atmosphere. We went 2 times, for a brunch and a dinner. The best restaurant so far in Singapore to taste French Mediterranean food. All was perfect from spritzers to deserts. Not to miss under any circumstances: the chorizo sandwich, the fregola pasta, the mongkfish and the lemon tart!
Rare in Singapore to have a perfect mix between great tasty food and excellent service !
Oh, and I almost forgot, the Frozé cocktail is divine !!!"
Excellent service great food!,"Amazing service, friendly staff and owner, such a wonderful place and experience. Definitely keen to become a regular!"
Wonderful birthday dinner,"We celebrated my wife's birthday at LouLou while visiting Singapore. We were met by Santos who also took our reservation the day before. Wow - what a great and attentive service. Both Santos and Sheila were outstanding and took great care of our table, the bday girl and our friends. Food was delicious and nicely presented. We totally enjoyed our evening, the food and the service. It was pretty packed on Thursday night but still the service was always attentive and personal. I can highly recommend LouLou and will try to squeeze in another visit during our short stay in Singapore if time permits."
Enjoyable food and experience,"Pretty decorations and lovely ambience. For starters - we ordered Pâté en Croûte (pate was good with the puff pastry coating), South West Duck Rillettes (duck meat was generous. I matched this with bread.), Sobrasada croquettes (love this! The croquettes and the sauce match very well too.) and Iberico Ham & Melon (nice and interesting match). For mains - we ordered Fregola Pasta (overall flavourful. The bisque broth was rich with lobster/prawn taste and the prawns were fresh. However it gets gelat after 3/4 of the dish. ) and Grilled Pork Secreto (this is super good! The pork was nicely charred and meat is soaked with flavour). Desert of the day was Mocha cake and it was so good! It was rich and moist. The decorated cookies that came with it was delicious too.

Would like to shout out to Chef Watson for his amazing culinary skills and all of the dishes were delicious. He was very friendly and patient when we asked him about the ingredients in the dishes. Manager Santos and waitress Sheila were attentive and always smiling.

Overall we had a very happy and pleasant experience! Would definitely visit again!"

Enjoyed their sharing boards, truffle risotto, the burrata, loulou sundae as well as various charcoal grilled. Fantastic service and food recommendations from Jeff Ray. We had a great time of celebration at Loulou."
Charming French bistro,"Celebrated my niece’s birthday at Loulou . On learning it was my niece’s birthday Ramon and his wonderful colleagues put in a lot of effort in making the dinner an happy occasion. They ensured she is happy with the special table they had reserved for her and without hesitation changed it for us when we preferred to be seated inside . The birthday cake was presented by him and his staff with a cherry happy birthday song . What a group of charming and warm people .
Loving this charming bistro. Food is very good too - the Large Mediterranean Board that comes with homemade aioli, anchoiade, eggplant caviar, Iberico ham,comte cheese, marinated goat cheese, crudités servedwith warm French baguette. The creamy Duck Rillettes and smoky Pastis Flambéd Prawn are delicious too. Only gripe is the steak does not come with French fries ."
Wonderful dinner,"Great food! Excellent service from Ray/Jeff/Sheila! Thank you We had ham with melon, grill scallops, pastis prawns and bouillabaisse"
Amazing lunch,Amazing food... Especially the prawns.. And the service was amazing.. Both Jeff and Raymond were amazing at looking after us.. Highly recommended
A nice hangout for wine and good food,"It was a busy night at lou lou but service staff was attentive and prompt.

Nice date place in Keong Saik,"The restaurant has a cozy atmosphere, but what I really like is the price point of their dishes vis-a-vis the size of the dishes. The food size is quite generous but the price is quite affordable compared to other restos within the area. Raymond, Sheila and Jeff have been amazing as well! We would definitely come back."
Great value,"Thanks Raymond, Sheila and Jeff for making our date night memorable. Great food and good value. Staff is pleasant and attentive."

"Lured by the Floral Decor and Impressed with the Food and Friendly, Warm Service","The beautiful flowers and vines twirling around beams above the wooden high tables immediately caught my attention while I was strolling on the opposite side of the road. So I take the plunge to try out the food here.

I'm immediately greeted by the friendly, easy-going staff when arriving at the wide entrance that feels like an open concept restaurant. The interior has this cozy yet chic feel. It is like being ushered into a classic French private party in a vineyard.

The Charcoal Grilled Grill is very interesting in the sense that patrons can customise the dish by choosing the side and sauce. Quite unheard of in lots of French restaurants, and I absolutely love this concept. I'm definitely very happy with my choice of French Pilaf Onion Rice for side dish. The tasty fragrant rice is perfectly cooked to ensure the grains remain separate from each other and is yet super fluffy and light, thoroughly soaked with the broth it was cooked in.

The well-seasoned Grilled Pork Secreto is so juicy and flavourful, with a very thin layer of char to perk things up. Firm in texture but very easy to cut and bite. Savouring this is one of those few times where I have no problem finishing the whole slab of meat by myself. When paired with Garlic and Parlsey sauce, the pungent flavours really brings up the taste profile a notch. I highly recommend this dish. Maybe I can try this with white wine sauce next time.

Deconstructed Lemon & Meringue Pie looks so pretty. The taste really packs a punch, lots of lemons are added to the custard and sorbet. When eating these with the sweet cookie and meringue, the whole taste comes together well. I like it a lot but I do think more cookies added will be even better for more harmonious taste and varied texture.

Free Flow Frose has the kick of alcohol and the refreshing zest of real strawberry, perfect for summer.

It is so easy to feel very comfortable dining at this place due to its coziness, open concept and the great service. Raymond and his team are very warm, friendly, meticulous, always on the go and respond to requests fast. In fact, they look so cheerful that this cheerfulness rubs off the patrons. I'm really impressed.

While this is a new restaurant, the operations looks to be smooth and the food is really good. I'm glad I decided to be adventurous and found this gem. Definitely look forward to going back."
France in Singapore,"A very good evening in Loulou, the food is incredibly good and reminds perfectly of French cuisine. After 3 months abroad, of France, I finally find a restaurant making me feeling like one home. The products are fresh and very tasty. The service was perfect: quick and friendly. The mood was really cool, with a live music singer making the mood even better. The price seems to be quite normal for Singapore.

I deeply recommend this restaurant for a dinner, with friends, family or in couple"
Great ambience and French cuisine,"We celebrated a friend's birthday at Loulou yesterday and enjoyed the experience. The food and ambience were fantastic. Thank you to Jeff, Raymond and Sheila for the attentive service, cheerful presence, and great wine/food recommendations."
"Attentive service, delicious food with laid backed atmosphere","This is my second time at LouLou. I found the food to be delicious and value for money when I went during my first time. The wine selection is fairly extensive and reasonably priced too. Ray and Jeff were very attentive to our requests, cheerful and professional. They made sure our wines are topped up and food served in sequence. The resturant has a homely feel and I would gladly go for the third time again!"
Birthday lunch with my partner - highly recommended!,My partner and i came down for the freeflow option for drinks and french inspired Mediterranean food. Jeffery and Raymond really took care of us and the food truly satisfying. Highly recommend the bone marrow with beef tartare and the Mediterranean platter!
Awesome brunch menu + free flow options.,Great support and service by Raymond and Jeffrey! A must to come place! Awesome food and good selection of drinks. Please make reservation in advance as they are fully booked.
Perfect food with 5 star service,"Lulu French Restaurant is a perfect place to have a great food and enjoy it with wine. Their south French menu is great menu and offerings is one of the best in Singapore. The selections of wines are so good too.

But what we really enjoy is the service from the staff. Jeffrey is very professional and accommodating. He makes sure that our table receives everything we need and he is very attentive to all the diners.

I ordered the steak and the calamari paired with red wine and I really enjoyed this meal as recommended by Raymond.

Thank you for the wonder experience at your restaurant. I will sure be back again. Kuddos to your team."
Perfect Amalgamation of French & Spanish Culture & Food,"Celebrated my mother in law’s birthday with my family and the awesome team at Lou Lou! Raymond, Jeff and Sheila brought life to the night with their warm personalities while we enjoyed the signature seafood bouillabaisse, iced seafood tower, grilled pork secreto and the surprise champagne poached pear birthday dessert! We’ll be sure to come back for Jonas and his catchy upbeat Spanish music. Unforgettable night for us all!"
"Delicious food, Good Ambience and Service!","Cosy & lively place to chill. The foods was good! Love love the steak, grilled calamari, risotto. Thank you Jeffrey and Raymond for entertaining us! Good service 👍! Will definitely visit again soon!"
