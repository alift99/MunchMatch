"Hospitality, ambience and a great meal","After a long day at Gardens in the Bay (we walked 15 km) we ambled along Robertson Quay scanning the various cafe menus. We settled on Verre for its offering of a light meal that nevertheless was flash enough to mark our 40th wedding anniversary. The attention of the waiting staff, their swift, friendly service and the offer to take the obligatory photo and complimentary dessert won us over completely. It was a restful, relaxed al fresco meal in balmy conditions. We will dine out on it for some time to come!"
Simply Fabulous,"This place serves great Happy Hour selection of wines and champagne. I particularly love the champagne they serve, value for money accompanied by great view by the riverside. Service was attentive and staff were always smiling. This is now my go to place to unwind!"
My favourite place in Singapore,"My favourite restaurant in Singapore.
The atmosphere in Robertson Quay next to Singapore River is fantastic.
We have tried the entire menu and everything is great.
The wine list is spectacular and during happy hour you can get a bargain.
Service and prices is also great.
Maybe not Micheline, but atmosphere, service, location and wine selection is excellent. 6/6"
A great meal,Just had a fantastic meal Lamb and baked vegetables was awesome The service was great prices were good
Great food and excellent service,"We had an excellent meal with great service, a very romantic location. and good value. I would certainly go there again."
Neighbourhood wine bar restaurant,Amazing unpretentious restaurant with 1 for 1 during happy hour. We loved our alfresco dining experience watching people walk their dogs and going for their evening strolls. Extensive wine list and food was great!
Outstanding food and service,"We used to eat here regularly when we lived in Singapore in 2014 and came back here for a nostalgic revisit while on holiday and we were not disappointed. The food was absolutely outstanding and the service excellent.
We shared the cauliflower steak to start, which was so delicious, we were sorry it wasn’t our main course and then we had the roasted salmon and the chicken with tiny raviolis in a beautiful creamy mushroom sauce. These were both excellent. Congratulations for maintaining such a good standard of food for this length of time."
Fantastic place for dinner,"Lovely Eurooean food, the staff were attentive and really polite, and the scenery being by the river is great! A great place for dinner with the option to go to a local bar afterwards."
Delicious,"This was our second visit as we were very impressed the first time. We both had the chorizo and octopus salad again, it is very good. Service is friendly and efficient. Wine by glass offerings have a good range. We will be back!"
Good wine bar - nice choices,"Couple dinner with. The bar has decent, and good quality wine choices. We liked the cotes du Rhone and Gigondas."
Delicious diner,"The food was great and the waiters very friendly. Both inside or outside are nice. I really recommend this place for a great french diner, especially with ""tarte flambée""."
"What an enjoyable dinner, thumbs up!","Sat outdoors, cos the restaurant was fully booked on Vday. Indoors look really classy but outdoors was nice and breezy too.

1. Excellent food: fried squid, sea urchin and king prawn linguine, wagyu beef
2. Amazing variety of wine by the glass. High quality wine available by glass too. Really liked that they measured/aerated the wine with a small decanter (?) before pouring into glass
3. Fantastic service. Restaurant was full and food came a bit slow. But we totally had no complaints cos of the amazing staff- every single waiter that attended to us were prompt (running towards us to take our order), super polite (checking if plates can be cleared even when they were quite empty, making some small talk, wishing us happy v day) and altogether v professional

Thumbs up and recommended!"
drinks with friends,"Great service, superb selection and good ambience - not too busy but nice buzz.Attentive friendly staff. Liked a lot."
Excellent Wine Bar,"I don’t give many five star reviews but well deserved here. Serious wine drinkers will need to request their wine list, which is extensive. Heavily focused on French wines but some additional selections as well. We had a 2012 Barolo, which was excellent. Upon ordering the wine, they switched our stemware and brought a decanter without a request, clearly showing that they know wine. Had bruschetta, which was very fresh and and tasty. Wasn’t planning on dinner but it started to rain so we stayed. Had the roasted chicken with mini ravioli and the Wagu beef. Both were superb! Atmosphere is much quieter than the typical business of Singapore, a welcomed oasis. And the service, without question was the best we’ve had in Singapore. Not a cheap eat but if you appreciate great food and wine, it’s worth it!"
Nice Food with Nice Ambiance,"Celebrated a friend’s birthday during one of the weekday, the restaurant setting sets a nice and relaxing ambiance with a beautiful wine cellar parked at the center of the restaurant.

We wanted something different from the menu and the chef curated a bespoke menu for us for a 5 course meal that is off the menu.

The experience we had is one of a kind, the mushroom soup and Wagyu is superb and a must try!

Will definitely go back again!"
good food excellent wine selection,Food is good the waiters are great and the wine selection is excellent. The one thing they do not have however is a sommelier. Would be good to have someone with good understanding of wine to help the people choose the right bottle/s
"Great ambience , drinks and food","Lovely place to chill out and have a quiet conversation with friends. The range of wines is great and it is accompanied with suggested wine bites. The food is good too, while there is Happy Hour every day. Worth going again!"
Humble and excellent,"Going there regularly for the Traditional Munster Tarte flambée (I can revive the real taste of the Tartes flambées from north of France that I like so much)
Also discovered that the other parts of the menu are excellent, especially the Hamachi tartare and the Roasted lamb
Service is friendly and humble.
All in all, a restaurant without big show-off, but at the end with excellent food and very friendly service. That's what I like !"
Great place to unwind.,"Verre. Located at 8 Rodyk St, #01-05/06, Singapore. Decent wine bar but quite pricey. While the list is extensive, it's French bias. The food is not the best either. The major selling point is the venue itself. Best seating is the outdoor section facing the river, cosy enough for conversation as well as to enjoy the activity of people watching. Perfect place to chill-out. Overall nice atmosphere, and medium ocker food .The waiters and staff are friendly and professional. Good place to meet to catch-up with friends and family. Definitely must try."
Overpriced and average food,"1 for 1 glass of wine but nothing cheaper than $14 a glass.
$8 for a lemonade for a kid.
$9 for water.
This is before service charge and GST!
We ordered several ""Wine Bites"" and kid's pasta ($9 for a tiny plate of butter and garlic pasta) and asked for everything to be served together, except kid's pasta that could come first. It all came at different times.
The food itself was OK. Nothing to rave about or justify the price.
Go somewhere else, there is so much choice that surely money can be better spent elsewhere."
Verre serves the best lamb ever tasted!,I enjoyed tonight a friendly service and excellent food at the Modern Bistro & Wine Bar Verre. Due to an allergy they had to adjust the ordered meal and they did that very well. It was the best roasted lamb I ever tasted and the roasted vegetables with it tasted also very well. I will come back and order more from their menu.
Try the lamb!,Oysters and lamb were the standouts. Great selection of wines and service was outstanding. Prices standard for Singapore. Definitely recommended
Relax with excellent wines on the terrasse next to Singapore river,The bistro is located at the Singapore river with a nice terrasse to enjoy a glass of wine outside. Very friendly service.
Cosy wine bar,Lovely small wine bar next to river. Away from busy streets. Enjoyed wine and beer in the afternoon.
Great food,I went there with the second time. Absolutely delicious food in a french cuisine approach. The terrace is brilliant and very calm which is rare in the area.
Great happy hour,"Verre has several wines by the glass, and during happy hour they are all 1 for 1, even the champagne!
The food was great and service very good.
We will be back.
p.s. stay away from the Sangria, it was awful, but did not affect our overall experience. When we were there we saw three other tables leaving nearly full glasses of Sangria, so it was not just us crinching from it's taste."
"Gorgeous food and wine, eerily quiet!",We had an old French Bordeaux which was wonderful and competitively priced. We ordered lots of little plates to share all of which were delicious especially the truffle flambee tart (thin pizza) and the raw fish dishes. The restaurant itself was quite cold and strangely empty compared to the others along the river. It’s definitely a smarter vibe than some of the other places along the front so I wonder if this put them off!
Always a pleasant moment...,"This nice restaurant just in front of the SG river (best place to walk around in the city) has a nice terrace and a delicious menu (mostly french dishes)
Every dish is made with fineness and care, and the staff always very friendly and professional.
You can even find Tarte flambée ! (delicious...)
Totally recommended :)"
Tasty meal & good wine,"Atmosphere was very pleasant. Tall ceilings, elegant decor. Waitstaff were mostly well trained, other than one who was a little absent, I asked her for a napkin twice & by the third time I decided to ask someone else.

Food was tasty. Deep fried baby squid was deliciously crunchy with a saffron & garlic ailoli that gave a mustard-like kick to the tastebuds. Molten cheese soufflé was nicely cooked. Truffled portobello & asparagus tarte flambee was decent but could have had a little more taste. Aglio olio butter linguine was so memorable with very nicely cooked large green asparagus and roasted Portobello. Roasted lamb leg was nicely medium cooked with very tasty vegetables and silky mashed potato.

Waiter knows his wine & recommended two good red & white choices to suit our individual tastes.

Unfortunately, the dessert could have been better. Molten chocolate lava cake was not molten. When I sliced it through, nothing oozed out, needs a good injection of lava. Caramelized apple tart was visually appealling but not cooked through, I could taste uncooked pastry dough.

Would I go back? YES! But will head elsewhere for dessert."
Dinner by the river,"We found this quiet restaurant while strolling by the river at Robertson Quai, and sat outside. The menu is small and well thought out. My duck Confit was delicious, and my husband said he really enjoyed his chicken. We both had creme brulee to finish.

The service was unobtrusive and excellent."
Verre very bad!!!! So much other choice in Singapore. Please read and avoid!,"Spent a horrible evening here. Why can’t you have negative ratings for some restaurants on TripAdvisor. Avoid Verre at all costs!!!!! Our friends and I eat out every weekend. This evening we were a group of 10. You can see from my TripAdvisor restaurant rankings that I do take the time to rate restaurants - fairly. Most are decent to good. Verre is a disaster. Epic proportions disaster!

Firstly, the food is hard to actually rate, since we did not get half meals ordered and in the right time. It probably would have been alright; although the steak I specifically ordered as medium rare (see picture) was clearly well done. That was probably the positive highlight of the evening.

The lowlight is basically being insulted by the “manager”, and eventually the “owner” of the restaurant. If you like that kind of masochistic treatment, and also your mains served before the starters (or not at all - 3 of our friends did not even get their starters/mains), then this is the place for you. After asking several times with the wait staff, the orders still did not come on time. There was over an hour gap between the first few starters arriving and the mains that trickled in!

We asked to speak to management. We got the runaround from a couple of people claiming to be managers, without being able to actually take a management level decision. In the case of the lady “manager”, add a lack of customer facing skills to the mix. There was an initial attempt by her to sort out the situation, but it ended up in resulting in a war of words. Hello, we are the customers, or so we thought. At Verre, the customer is always a a necessary evil. I think that is their motto.

We were willing to pay fairly for what was consumed, but not for their mistakes in timing, and insolence. Finally, what we thought to be an owner showed up, only to be further engaged in a verbal battle, about what was or wasn’t served and in time. What we wanted was to pay for the wine and food we consumed, and let them come back with a solution to the painful experience of having a Friday evening dinner absolutely destroyed.

At this point, the single of bottle of wine they offered as compensation was a micro attempt to patch up an already tense stand-off between restaurant staff and customers. I think they lost a few other customers who walked by and heard the hearty discussion about bad service. They ended up discounting the remaining food items by 20%. We all would have gladly paid 50% more, had the service and food been good, or at least acceptable.

Anyway, I could spend even more time ventilating, but it isn’t worth my time and effort. Just move on. That is what I would advise any potential customers of Verre. Please just move on and don’t patronize this place, unless you would like to personally experience what a bad, Verre bad review is all about.

I will add that the waitress who took our order was not at fault at all. She double checked the order, but it was incompetently messed up by the kitchen/system/management.

Verre very bad indeed!!!"
Excellent food and service!,Exceptional value. Service was excellent without being overbearing. The salmon and roasted lamb entrees were cooked to perfection and the desserts were likewise excellent. I highly recommend this place!
Lovely food and wine,Modern style restaurant in a nice location with inside (AC) and outside seating. The food was well made and presented and very tasty. I loved the choices of wine by the glass as I was in my own.
Next to the river,"We searched for a nice spot to drink and eat. By accident, we found the Verre which convinced us immediately with good wine and a lovely location as well as a small menu.

You could go there just for wine and wine bites as well as for having a good dinner.

Tim"
Underrated Understated,"Great food, tip top tarte flambé and excellent roast lamb, served with a wonderful creamy mash. Food here is constantly good and the service is always friendly and efficient. Wine choice and price is generally good as well. It looks a bit cavernous inside and often gets overlooked for other restaurants along the front, I don’t know why as it is really good here.

Usually it’s me and she who must be obeyed eating here, even flying solo it’s a decent spot to watch Singapore stroll by."
amazing 1-for-1 happy hour pours,Verre is a quiet and nice place for an early evening meetup. extensive wine selection for glass pours.
Great place for wine and food,"This place is awesome. Casual, relaxed vibe with French food and wine appreciation. Modern bistro it is! I sat outside and watched the world go by: runners, children on scooters, lovers hold hands all while I drank a lovely Sancerre and ate a tarte flambé! I would highly recommend this place."
Nice place,We had a table outside at the terrace. You look over the river. We had a hamburger and lamb chops. Both were good. Location is very good. Surrounded by many bars and restaurants.
Great value happy hour and decent food,"It has been quite some time since I last visited this place, but the opportunity arose for a return visit recently. The happy hour is a really good deal with 1:1 on most of the wines by the glass up until 8pm (whereas most of the other happy hour deals in the area end at 7pm). The wine is served in decent wine glasses too which somehow enhances the experience. We also chose a few of the appetisers to accompany the wine - also very tasty. Friendly and efficient service. Well worth another visit."
"Great staff,Wide selection of wines and beer very good location",Food choices are good and price are reasonable .I really enjoy the food and wine . service staff very friendly and Excellent.I recommend for excellent food for sg
Good time out with wife.,It was a quite night out with mu wife. Food was good and we had a good time. Limited dessert choices but not an issue. Atmosphere was good
"Good Food, Good win",Great food and a superb wine (2008 Barossa Shiraz) at a very reasonable price - a real find. We will definitely be back to try more of the menu.
Fabulous dining,Marvelous wine & awesome food that made us to return as many times as possible. It will be good to have membership & rewards!
Fantastic wine and friendly staff,"We visited Verre wine bar as it was only a few metres from our hotel, we were not disappointed! The wine selection was fantastic and the food was scrumptious. The staff were very welcoming, helpful and friendly."
Pathetic,"Saturday night. Not that busy. Sat down for 5mins and went totally unnoticed. I got up and left. If I have to beg for service, the Verre gets one star just because I can't rate you anything less than that."
To avoid,"Wine is very expensive, starting at 80SGD for a bottle of very low quality French wine. We tried one and asked it to be replaced as it was corcked. Waiter was not happy at all and said wine was fine. After few arguments, he agreed to replace it. Charcuterie platter was basic without bread and served with weird biscuit. Overall staff have no knowledge about wine or whatsoever, this is not a wine bar at all, very bad experience"
Great French bistro,Grab a bottle of wine with a plate of cheese or charcuterie and you won’t be disappointed. Outside seats are great with a view on the river.
Some hits and misses,"We were in search of a wine bar for a dinner on a Sunday night and we came across Verre. Actually we have passed this bistro many times during our stroll in Robertson Quay area, but every time we skipped it and chose another place instead. One thing I recall, this place never looked crowded at all.

So anyway, we finally tried it. Restaurant was empty but we needed to push to get our preferred table by the window. The waitress mentioned it is their restaurant policy, but after awhile did let us sit there. Not a very good first impression. But please do not get me wrong, the waitress who waited on us was friendly, and trying her best, but in general there are some misses, this being one of them. And btw, we were not being rude as well.

At the time of ordering, the waitress recommended their daily special menu and specifically recommended the suckling pig. Alas, the suckling pig was out of stock. My message to service staff everywhere, please check inventory with the kitchen staff before strongly recommending a daily special menu with limited quantity!

The food itself has some highlights. We ordered the spicy crusted chicken mid-wing --- very crispy, very nicely spiced and fried, and accompanied by spicy sauce. I could come back again to this place just to eat this withy a glass of cold beer. Besides that, we ordered the pate board and wagyu tenderloin. Pate board consists of 3 types of duck pate with different flavoring --- orange, french onion, and burgundy, and some baguette. Duck pate is good, I prefer the burgundy and french onion as they are less sweet. Wagyu tenderloin is good (but then you would expect no less from a $59 wagyu beef). Both pate board and wagyu tenderloin came with salad on the side --- too sweet for our liking. From the general tone of the food --- from the spicy sauce, the pate, the salad --- I would say they are more on the sweet side. Hope to have more balance next time.

Net, a good place with nice ambience to hang out with friends or family, for wine or even beer, and some nice snacks. One of those places you can come back time and time again. I for sure will try again and hope that the next time the experience will be nicer than this!"
Outstanding food & service,"Fabulous meal tonight, lamb outstanding, wonderful ambience. You should go ! Best meal out in Singapore by miles."
Could not fault,Being a Tuesday around 10 pm this was one of the only restaurants willing to accommodate our party of nine. We were not disappointed service was good as was the food.
Excellent food and wine,"I had a very enjoyable evening here, with excellent food and wine (from a substantial list by the glass), in a relaxed and quiet setting. There was also a generous weekday happy hour promotion, so I could get 2 glasses of the same wine for the price of one, which was fantastic value.

I ordered the grilled salmon, the Marcel Deiss Gewürztraminer, and the Massolino Barbera d'Alba.

The grilled salmon was excellent; the fish was very well-cooked, and the banana dressing + avocado gave the quinoa plenty of flavour and texture. The fragrance from the bananas paired really nicely with the floral rose notes of my Gewürztraminer wine.

The next wine, a Barbera, was excellent. Young leather, blackberries, and a long-lasting spicy finish. A great end to a peaceful evening.

I was also very happy with the service, which was prompt and effective. I also appreciated that they had a sommelier to recommend me wines based on my preferences and what I am having.

This is definitely a place to return to for more of their food and wines."
All But the Service,"Great location, good wine list, comfortable environment, and very tasty food. But for the service - slow and inattentive - a good find."
Passing by,"Was strolling along the riverside early evening and spotted this place. Noticed an excellent Happy Hour,generously extended to 9pm,and decided to give it a go. Surprisingly quiet,but we were inside. Al Fresco,was the popular choice. Nice Staff and food. Good Value too"
Nice bistro,I became a client.. the wines always good quality and the food too. Love the oysters and some special platters as cheese and terrine ones. Nice tarte flambé too. From the staff is the best you can have in the area Kumar David Christy ... also Joshua inside the bar doing some plates is always a good welcome. I can't forget a French waiter who for French community makes it a French bistro ... have inside or outside is always a pleasure with the view of the river. Happy hours during week till 9 and weekend till 6 but always good double check. Also there you will met uncle who is a lovely man who take care of the business always with a treat for who comes outside with the dogs . Many reasons for me and some other people become Verre clients...
Good wine and cheese spot,Luckily ended up at here at happy hour and so this ended up being quite a relaxing wine and cheese afternoon that didn't end up costing too much. Definitely would return.
Great place to chill with wine,This is a nice place to chill with friends. They have an extensive wine selection. Most places only offer 2 types of wine for HH. At Verre they have much more and they are all good wine! The cheese tarte flambee and spicy crusted chicken paired well with the wine. Will definitely visit again to try their mains.
Petra loves classy Verre,"I visit Verre at least once a week...I I live in Robertson Quay. I enjoy the very fresh oysters, creamy and luxurious duck rilletes, garlic prawns and all other dishes are often made perfectly and the wide choices of wines."
"Good French wine, nice location.","Really a nice place to have good wines at a very decent price especially during their happy hours. We have been coming every Saturday afternoon for more than 2 years, never been disappointed by the venue, the drinks, the food and the smiling staff. We have been missing Emerson for the last 2 months. It was the waiter who was key to create this special atmosphere. Hope it will be back soon here"
Wish we had found it sooner,"Essentially a wine bar but with a very good menu of tapas and main courses, the salad was delicious with an excellent vinaigrette. We had the prawns which were as good as we have had anywhere (and we live in Spain!) also had the spring chicken which was excellent.
For those of you in the Clarkes quay area where there is so much fast food of iffy quality walk a little further inland on the river bank to Robertson quay, a good choice of bars and restaurants but Verre is well worth a visit."
Positive suprise,"We wanted a beer or wine to relax and selected Verre Wine Bar just randomly as a Bar. However, The wine by glass list made us to consider also something to eat. We selected sea food pasta and scallops as portions. Suprise was really positive when the scallops were served. The portion was very nice and the scallops fresh and not overcooked. The sauce for the scallops was just amazing. Also the green side salad was fresh with sweet and vinegar taste. The food was almost unreally good for a Bar. I can highly recommend the scallops with a glass of your favourite white wine. Also need to point out the prompt and polite service."
Overall,"This a great place to bring with your soul mate out for a romantic place for dinner or can even hang out with colleague after work for luxury gathering. You can choose the seat either indoor or outdoor. Service are too way beyond just average (excellent ). Food and wine are up to my standard and worth the price. More important last part, they still provide us a Beautiful Rose in Valentine's Day!"
Disappointed,"The Wagyu steak and prawn with fries and salad sounded appetizing. I asked for dressing on the side, which they forgot. The fries and steak were not even warm. It was difficult to communicate with the servers. Chambolle Musigny by the glass was good but pricey. Will look elsewhere"
Friendly but expensive.,"The service and food was excellent but by our standards expensive, but then everything in Singapore appears to be expensive by UK standards."
"Excellent service and food, perfect for people watching","While visiting an expat friend in Singapore, she suggested we try out Verre, a lovely little spot right on the river in the heart of Robertson Quay. Sitting outside gave us the opportunity to people watch while enjoying a great meal in the shade. We had the duck and the roast chicken, both of which were delicious. Lots of beverage options, both alcoholic and non and the best part of the night was a visit from the owners' golden retriever, whose sad sad eyes almost made me share my duck. Almost. Highly recommended for great fare and perfect ambiance."
Nice and beautiful restaurant,The restaurant ambience is really cosy and beautiful. Great for some good couple time and also gathering with friends
Great place to share wine with friends,"Extensive wine collection, great selection available by the glass. Had a nice time catching up with JC classmates here."
Delishious Verre,"On a Saturday night walking along the edge of the Singapore River, I and a local friend came upon Verre and decided a French-inspired dinner was in order.
The stylish wine bar (with impressive European selection inside and on the menu) was just the choice.
We sat outside watching the passing parade of walkers, runners and tourists.
The food was very good.
A shared plate of escargots in garlic and parsley was yum.
My simple tuna Nicoise salad and my friend's Angus steak were very good, with the tuna just seared and the steak meltingly good.
Our desserts, a tart tart citron and the oozingly good chocolate fondant rounded out the night.
Very enjoyable!"
4 stars,Service staff is friendly. Food is great. Ambience and atmosphere is no longer as cosy as the last time we went on a date in June 2014.
Very good Verre,"We recently spent five days in Singapore after a cruise. We came across Verre restaurant while walking alongside the Singapore river, nestled amongst lots of other restaurants. Verre stood out from all the rest, it is a classy bistro with beautifully laid tables, rustic tableware and each table decorated with a fresh small squash, a lovely natural touch. We ate there every day and enjoyed the prawns, steak and the delicious salads. The staff were so pleasant and welcoming and did an excellent job. Even the chef came out to speak to us on our last night. A really friendly place with great staff and fantastic food. We highly recommend Verre."
Quite nice for a light meal,"We ate at Verre on a Friday night. It was quite quiet and it was easy to get a table. The venue was reasonably plain. Service was efficient. The crowd is mainly local residences from around the area. The wine list wasn't bad.

We had some light bites and wine which were pretty good and better than we expected.

We will be back."
Too many niggles,"Has potential but too many niggles to return. Food good. Ambiance very good. Service mainly ok.

Now for the niggles:
- cheapest beer $14 for 300ml bottle
- empty restaurant. But we had to push for our preferred table. Restaurant stayed quiet all night.
- on bill we were charged for $19 wine rather than $15. ""Company Policy""
- extra bread charged at $5 without warning
- would not mix 2f1 wines."
Nice Environment,Environment is good.. Wine is nice.. Good recommendations from the restaurant manager.. Definitely will visit again..
Dinner,So many places to choose from in Singapore. My wife and I had a Salmon fillet grilled. A side order of asparagus and assorted mushrooms. The fish was served on potato mash with some sautéed onions. The taste was sumptuous and the service was non fuss and efficient. Mid to high price range but worth the money. Good selection of wine.
World class restaurant at Robertson Quay,If you are looking for great service and great food with a wine list to match Verre is the place. The menu is simple but has something for everyone definitely start with some of there platters. The service is exceptional and goes with the perfect setting. Sit outside and enjoy the experience. Make sure you book not to be disappointed. Enjoy
"Great staff, wide selection of wines and beers, quiet location","This bistro has been our local for nearly 2 years. We are there most of tge SaturdaysGreat and professional staff, very nice wines, happy hours, really like the atmosphere and the food. Strongly recommended for couples, family or for special events."
Mid-week date night,"A good, quiet spot for an affordable high end meal. Nice ambience, quiet setting and very good service"
"Wonderful for dinner, drinks and the best, friendliest service around!","We visit Verre a lot for Sunday dinner or for drinks during the week. We recently rented the entire restaurant for a special event and it was FANTASTIC. All of our guests raved about the food, atmosphere and the amazing service. We met with the chef who helped us design a special menu - mushroom confit soup served in little cappuccino cups, mini burrata tomato canapes, melon and prosciutto, followed by sliders, lobster pasta and a number of other Verre specialties. Restaurant manager Saravana and his team of servers were attentive and passionate about making our event so special and unforgettable. The chef outdid himself on all menu items including an array of fantastic homemade desserts including macaroons. Whether you're looking for a glass of wine in a nice location or a venue for a special event, I recommend Verre without reservation!"
"Good service, overpriced wine","Good attentive service. Food was alright and competently executed (I had the duck confit) but not spectacular for the price. They have a good wine collection, just that they are rather overpriced!"
Wines and some food,"Good place - classy and modern menu. So good selection of wine, and the waiter actually knew a lot about wine! Living in Bangkok thats become a rareity. Expensive, as everything else in Singapore. The food was good, but due to lack of some cources it was quite few dishes to select from. Overall very good, but has potential to exellent!!"
"Extensive, super-expensive wine list","Incredibly expensive wine list : we enjoyed a bottle of Barbera d'Alba but with tax/service it was over £50!!! It was almost the lowest priced wine on the list as well. Served at correct temperature, good service, but fifty quid for a bottle I would pay HALF that in a central London restaurant. An indication of how Singapore is pricing itself out of reality for so many visitors driven perhaps by the misplaced association with status accorded wine drinkers locally. Get real people!!!"
Service? What service?!?,"Nice location next to Singapore River, good choice of wines, incredibly incompetent and slow service! We will avoid the place."
Very French but pricey.,"Excellent restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. Good French style food and wines, but not cheap."
Best restaurant in Singapore,"Top service, awesome wines, tasty food and lovely ambiance, as always! I'm getting used to coming here for special dinners. I've never been disappointed, quite the contrary! I'm glad I discovered this place where you can experience top restaurant service to the western standards"
Great Wine List,Great wine list and a good nibble menu to accompany. My only grumble was that I felt the staff were a little over zealous refilling the wine glasses. It wasn't cheap plonk and they would come along and slosh it all in. That apart can recommend :-)
Perfect for family,"We had the lamb, rib eye, fish and duck confit for main course. Beside the duck being too salty, we were satisfied with the overall of the taste. Service was attentive. Ambience was cosy and elegant."
"best service one can find in Singapore, impressive wine list, delicious food and lovely ambiance","First, they've got an impressive wine list for glass pour. There's delicious food (made by Michelin-starred chef), lovely chill ambiance with indoors and outdoors seating by the river, affordable prices. And most importantly, the best service one can find in Singapore"
Awesome experience.,It was a very pleasant experience. It was a surprise birthday celebration for my partner. The staffs are very nice. :) the preped the cake as requested!
New Upsized Menu At Verre,"This wine bar has been around. Recently, they have upsized their menu and now have a full menu which has a range of selections across appetisers, mains and desserts.

On entering the restaurant, you are greeted by high ceilings, and a glass enclosed wine cellar. There are over 150 labels in the cellar. Wine lovers will be spoilt for choice!

They have indoor air-conditioned and outdoor alfresco dining areas. Outside, you can sit back and watch the boats go by, literally on Singapore River!

I came by for dinner with some friends and here are the highlights:
- Tarte Flambee Forest: $22. Appetisers of 'Filo-ish' pastry with button mushroom and onions which has a nice vinegrette flavour.

- Chicken Liver Parfait: $24. Served in a glass jar, you scoop out some parfait and spread it over some slices of baguette. I like the Australian dehydrated mandarin orange, which was unique and nice. It pairs well with the parfait.

- Half Lobster Salad: $38. Love the presentation of this dish. It's presented in a glass dome, which the nice staff lifted to present. Love the dressing and the 'guacamole' at the bottom of the dish.

- Seafood Papilotte: $30. Break open the oven-baked paper bag for an irresistible aroma and the contents of cut onions, de-shelled prawns, octopus and clams in a fish broth, which absorbed all the flavors of the seafood to become a stock reminiscent of lobster bisque. In love with this. Not forgetting the bread on the side, which you can dip into the stock. Lovely. Kudos to the chef!

- Black garlic soup: $19. At the bottom is a bun, layered with a sesame 'wafer' and topped with a clove of black garlic that had a caramelised vinegrette flavor. I love this.

- Pan-seared lobster with sweet corn: $38. The sweet corn makes up the bottom of the plate. Garnished with cheese crisps, pop corn and espuma foam. The black konbu atop the scallops are the perfect complement to the scallops. Mildly salty and opens up the appetite.

- Suckling Pig: $42. You get to enjoy 2 types of suckling pig, one roasted and one stewed in this dish. Topped with pieces of Parma ham, whole stewed onions and endives.

- Lamb Chop with Moroccan couscous and mint sauce: $46. Lamb chops were done really well, with a nice searing on the outside and you get pink fat-layered meat inside. The couscous was also tasty.

- Filet of Wagyu Beef: $62. Filet of Wagyu Beef with a bucket of truffle fries and forest ketchup. This was the highlight of my meal. Thick cut of beef done medium rare. The forest ketchup is house-made with mushrooms and onions. Definitely not the tomato ketchup that we know. Has a nice starchy mushroom flavor, which complements the beef. Once you start on the fries, you can't stop!

For desserts, we had:
- Canele: $4. Traditional recipe: Vanilla milk, dark rum, icing sugar, eggs and butter

- St Honore: $10. The St Honoré was made with Pâte Feuilletée, Profiteroles and Vanilla Chantilly. I am totally in love with the Canele, which has a nice crisp exterior and you cut into it to have a soft spongy inside. Really good!

- Jasmine Tea Verrine: $16. Subtle hints of Jasmine tea and I like the different textures of smooth custard and crushed ice when you put your spoon into it. too pretty to eat.

- Vanilla Cheesecake: $17. This was a deconstructed cheesecake.

I like the food here and the staff is more than happy to recommend wines to pair with your food, or to suit your palate for the day. Service is also good.

With the cool weather these days, I might just opt to sit in the alfresco area and savour my glass of wine!"
Overpriced for mediocre service,"While the cook allegedly worked in Michelin star restaurants, and the dishes show that, the service is far away from that standards, yet the prices are quite heavy for what you get. We were five for dinner, and we were served in intervals of 4-5 min each, so that when the last was served the first had already finished. Same story with cleaning, where dishes were taken away in the order they finished - not an issue in a casual place, but at dishes priced at this level you expect better service. Finally, had a big discussion about lamb chops that were 80-90% fat - the cook insisted this is normal, but it is the first time I got something where the edible portion is about 10% of the total. I am afraid this will not become one of my favs..."
Fantastic place for a date!,Impressive list of wine for glass-pour. Food and presentation well above average. Attentive service.
A welcoming bar,"Surrounded by numerous other establishment this bar just has a little bit extra that makes it stand out, terrific attentive service, grea range of food and drinks that won't break the bank. Thanks to the staff for always making us welcome and see you again soon when next in town."
Check what you order is what you expect.,It is our first visit to Singapore. We chose the Bistro for a meal as some dishes sounded similar to UK food we were familiar with. The confit of duck ordered was much as expected. The Dover Sole Citrus could not have been further from my expectations. Sole is a delicate fish and normally soft when cooked. Citrus suggested to me it was grilled and with a lemon sauce. It arrived with a dark sauce like a wine or lobster gravy. The fish was raw with slight cooking on the outside and it was also cold. I could not ear it and at 36 dollars it was expensive to throw away. Such a shame but I did not feel I could complain as it is likely to be local taste as is sushi. Just to say check it out before you order. The staff serving were excellent.
"Great Food, Good Wine",We visited this place for the first time last night and were very impressed with the quality of the food. Everything was delicious and there was a good selection of wine. The staff was very friendly too. We had a fun night. Definitely will be back!
"Dinner - food good, service great","Verre is in a perfect people watching location right by the river. The staff there are fantastic, always friendly and attentive, Emerson is my fave. New menu is really yummy, altho it is a little pricey, the food is always very good."
Excellent option in a nice and quiet riverside setting,"Just walking down along the river at my last visit to Singapore, I dropped into Verre. A very welcoming and helpful waiter guided me to a nice outdoor table with a view towards the river with boats commuting up and down.
A pleasant surprise was both food and wine. Perfectly prepared lamb rack and a combining delicious Bourgogne red wine rounding off with a tasty expresso made it all a great dinner experience.
An excellent quiet and nice place, professional service and for sure a place to return to."
Good food for a wine bar,"This location is very good. The river is next to the restaurant and its peaceful unlike the more ""party-like"" area nearby. There are so many people who are jogging or walking their babies it gives a nice neighborhood food.
Most wine places I know serve really bad food. This place is different. There is a wide menu range and pretty decent food. There are appetizers, toast (which is like thin-crusted pizza), main food etc. This is not gourmet but certainly quite good. Of course we can do small bites and share all the food."
Great service,Another great Singapore river side restaurant service excellent food great there's not much more to say it was a great night enjoyed by all
"Great local restaurant with good food, nice wine list and great staff","Verre has become a local neighbourhood restaurant for us, we eat here probably once every 2 weeks. The food is of good quality with generous proportions particularly the starters, the wine list is simple but of good quality and not the usual overpriced, mass produced commercial wine lists that are the staple of most Singapore restaurants.

However the best thing about this restaurant is the wait staff, very obliging and a very capable team our thanks to Emerson who always manages to provide great service regardless of how busy the restaurant is."
Great location and good value during happy hour,"Before 7pm this place has a deal where you get 2 for 1 on glasses of wine. So instead of paying $18++ for a glass it ends up being just $9++, and there's a good selection of wines available by the glass. We also tried the seafood pizza which was quite tasty. Service was friendly and seemed genuine. A great place to take visitors from out of town."
if you want a cold dinner... go here,"staff is friendly, great location at the Singapore river; steak frittes were cold, Salmon (although sufficiently cooked) also served cold, staff acknowledged our comments, but nothing happened would we return: NOPE, there are better option within walking distance"
