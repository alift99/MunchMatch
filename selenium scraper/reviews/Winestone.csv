"Tranasctional Service, Mediocre Food","My wife and I cam here for our last dinenr in Singapore, attarcted by the promised wine-bar vibe and interesting menu. Hadn't realised it was part of a hotel. Overall food was OK - burger and chicken, so hard to go too wrong and definitely nothing special, but issue was the service. We booked for 8.30 and arrived on time - we just ordered main course - but then as we were eating or meal at just after 9pm, we are told that the restaurant was closing - we finished and were then rather quickly ushered away by 9.10pm without asking for dessert etc. Basically my message to the management is IF you are closing at 9pm, then don't accept orders at 8.30!!"
Birthday Celebration,"Catherine is very patient, we mentioned the coffee is not so nice and she changed total of 3 cups till we are satisfied. Overall service of our serving staff is also very prompt and good, Muqlish and Pandian."
Lovely family dinner,"Had a lovely family meal for the 7of us. Ordered 2 dozens of oysters, pork chop, 2 beef cheek tagliatelle, bolognese tagliatelle, tomahawk steak, free flow wine and a few desserts to end.

Everything was delicious.

Special shout out to Pandian. He recommended the Tomahawk steak which is not on the menu yet. The kitchen is trying out the tomahawk steak now for customers to see the feedback as to whether or not to include it into the menu. It was cooked perfectly and seasoned nicely. Come with 2 sauces, some grilled veges and some Caesar kind of salad.

Service was exemplary. Good job to Pandian and the team!"
Worth a try!,"Visited Winestone for dinner with the family on 1.1.23.

4 course set for NY
Food Taste - Excellent and very flavourful
Seafood Chowder Soup - very tasty and creamy
Prawn kale salad - prawns were fresh and tasty! Salad very refreshing
Tender beef cheek for mains - simply melts in your mouth making you want to have more!
Matcha Lava Cake - sweet ending to an awesome dinner

Service staff - pretty attentive, helpful and friendly, in particular Syahed and Lance

Ambience - warm and inviting, pretty cool. Can improve on cleanliness would be great (leftover food crumbs seen on floor)

Price - reasonably priced. Worth every cent! Value for $

Happy to visit them again in the near future!"
Birthday Celebration,"Excellent service provided by the team & good ambience! Birthday song was sang without us requesting, impressive service! Mr Sayed the manager also constantly came over to check on our dinner, would recommend coming here for any celebration events!"

Excellent service and food!,"Came to Winestone to celebrate my brother’s birthday and we had a fantastic time! The food was amazing, gotta love their burger and cod fish fillet. What was most impressive is the service here. Mr Sayed, the manager and his team on 27th December, gave us impeccable service for that night. Extremely friendly, fast and catered to our every request, we couldn't have asked for a better way to spend this important night. I will highly recommend Winestone if you are looking for a chill night out with your friends or even to celebrate an important day."
Unique experience,"While the food is nice and value for money, we find the hospitality of the staff here commendable . The staff, May and team, kept checking in on us and tended to our requests promptly. They catered a personalised service to us by making small talk and were very bubbly!"

"Perfect Mood, Service for Wedding Anniversary.","Lovely ambience, AWESOME Service, Worth the money! I will like to compliment the staff at Winestone Novotel at Stevens Road. All of them had postive energy, polite with an upbeat attitude!

In particular, 3 staff I would like to compliment: Catherine, Wilson and Brenda.

Upon entering into restaurant, Carherine the manager, immediately recognised us and greeted us cheerfully and in an upbeat positive tone. She even remembered the red wine we loved, our food preference and even my sprained ankle from 2019! We always valued her service, thus had frequent this restaurant frequently before covid19. Loved her personalised service! Keep up the excellent service!!

Wilson who was quiet but really polite and attentive, he would serve our food politely and wasvery prompt in fulfilling our requests such as servings of chilli sauce.

Brenda, who ensured we had clean plates and cutleries were prompt and efficient. 

Food recommendation by Catherine was awesome and perfect for celebration. Pan-seared scallops, Lobster squid bisquette soup, Beer-battered calamari, Mushroom truffle risotto."
Dinner at Winestone,Good & cozy atmosphere in the restaurant. Friendly waiters. The food taste was alright and can do better.

A Wonderful Birthday Celebration,"We celebrated a close friend birthday at this restaurant over the weekend .

We were attended by two very young servers Masters Muqlish & Handel. They looked little raw but made up with very sincere , fast & enthusiastic service . We ordered Ribeye steak , Kurubuta Pork Chop& Cod Fish plus Lobster Bisque & Porcini Soup .
All tasted as they should be but we were not impressed by the Rustica Pizza !
The Highlight of the evening arrived when the mentor of the boys Ms Catherine presented the lovely Birthday Cake together with the mentee belting out a wonderful birthday song ! So sincere that i could see the birthday boy & his lovely wife Tai beaming from ear to ear to Mouth . We knew we hit the jackpot liao!!!"
Birthday Celebration Nov22,Service was great! Handel & Muqlish were very helpful in explaining the menu and their service was top notched. Highly recommended and we will be back!

Awesome food,We had great food and service by Sayed. Thank you so much for a wonderful evening! We really enjoyed it.
Amazing Catherine,Food was tasty and I stained my T-shirt! Thanks to Catherine help it got saved. Thank you for a good service!
Good Food,Nice ambience and the food is good. It was a Tuesday Oyster night hence my friend ordered the oysters which came very plump and juicy. We ordered the Cod fish too and it was a very thick slab with such smooth and flaky texture. Mild and sweet. One of fav dish together with the lamb rack and steak. Great service from the team too. Will visit soon again. Cheers!
Family dinner at Winestone,Dinner at Winestone with my family. Food is yummy 😋. Ambience is great with nice music. Service by Catherine and team is excellent! 👍
Winestone,"This restaurant is located in Novotel Stevens road. Great service , good food ! It’s has a nice ambience and the service is quick."
Wedding Lunch- Highly recommend,"Me and My wife hosted our wedding lunch at Winestone @ stevens for around 30pax and had a wonderful time. Some highlights below:

1) Mr Deep, the bar and restaurant manager is great and made the planning and booking process straight forward. He was highly attentive on emails or Whatsapp and gave me a good price per pax. All costs are inclusive of GST and service charge which made my job easy. Highly professional and did not push the sale.

2) On the day, the tables were beautifully decorated. The restaurant went out their way to provide flowers for each table, a reception table was also provided at the entrance.

3) Fantastic food with good quality ingredients. Seafood risotto, mushroom soup and the Cod fish were the highlights and got rave reviews from our guests.

4) Great table service from all members of staff. Highly efficient, polite and attentive.

Highly recommend. Thank you to all staff members."
dinner at winestone,the service staff were v attentive and food was good. highlight was the lobster risotto. nice ambience as well. recommend for people to come for any occasion
Great selection of food with reasonable portions,"Great ambience with a really good selection of food. Food was reasonably portioned and tasty. Service staff were helpful and polite.

Only drawback was that the dishes were not served together or at least planned to be served quickly back to back. There were 8 of us, and by the time the last dish was served, the first few members who had receive their food have finished theirs. This was despite the fact that there were around 3 to 4 group of patrons (mostly in twos or fours).

But would definitely still go back again to try other food in the menu."
Satisfying on all counts,"The reservation was made easy enough, with great reception on the line.
Upon our arrival, our party of 6 was warmly brought to a table that was ideally situated in the restaurant. Despite being near the entrance to the wash room, the petitioning auto sliding door never for once, made us feel uncomfortable. The washrooms were clean and very well equipped beyond the basics.

The mains which we ordered included beef cheeks, lobster risotto and The Cataplana. The cheeks weee tender and flavourful… and the extra time taken to prepare the rest sufficiently proved the reward in the waiting!! Not a fan of risotto, I thoroughly enjoyed every morsel, as both mussel and lobster tails were not over cooked but tasted of the freshness of the Ocean. The Cataplana proved a hit with my guest once more as every piece of fish was well cooked and seasoned.. one could tell the extent of care to cook each type of fish according to its cooking time .. it simply would not work if all the prawns, squid and fish pieces all went into the fire with equal amounts of time!
Bravissimo!

The desserts were something less to sing about. The lava cake did not ooze and the apple crumble tasted rather pedestrian. The cheese board was our joy at this time as all the flavours of the sweet, tart and cream all gave us much to speak about.

The service at Winestones at Stevens was attentive but at times, lacked initiative.. even as the crowd around us, thinned. Despite the delay in setting the table for dessert and coffee, the servers were respectful and patient… kudos to Mr. Sayed, who was clearly the very able leader among them. They have a good mentor in him.

Thank you Winestones for a wonderful lunch.. we dined, we laughed, we ate.. both tummy and hearts are full!!

Bravissimo!"
Birthday celebration,"My wife happen to found this restaurant with a good review, and we give it a try. We order lobster bisque, mix ham and cheese plater, mushroom truffle risotto, and rusticca pizza.

The food is worth to try, especially the mushroom truffle risotto, my wife is enjoy the risotto. The hotel also have the cool free flow wine option, which i never opt for this time, probably for the next visit.

And is for birthday celebration, when we call for bill, as the staff know that my wife is book for my birthday, to my surprise the staff is bring out small cake to celebrate for me and also suprise me with birthday songs.

Good job, good food, good ambience! Worth it!"
Anniversary dinner,"Friendly staff, good food and reasonably priced. Nice and quiet ambience. Easy parking. Good for family and couple."
Disappointed,"Complete disappointment after looking at other comments. This is absolutely far too expensive in regards to the food quality.
The porcini soup was good but not unforgettable. Simply served in a ball.
The main dish was a black angus rib eye 59$ served with some small and rare green salad pieces, and a pepper sauce which is just the dripping with pepper powder on top. This is not a sauce. You have to take a side if you want to have enough, I took truffle fries (+12$!), that were simple frozen fries topped with some cheese atomatized with truffle artificial taste."
Dinner for 2 + Birthday celebration,"Wonderful experience here. Had the T-bone steak and it was done perfectly, and the truffle fries we ordered for our sides was amazing too! Customer service was excellent - the staff went above and beyond to make my girlfriend's birthday memorable. Would definitely recommend!"
Nice ambience and friendly staff,"Had a lovely bday celebration at winestone. They gave me a complementary bday cake and all the staff even came to the table to sing me the bday song! The food was really good and my lobster tail was cooked perfectly. Portion sizes were also quite decent. Definitely worth multiple visits, especially with the various discounts (eatigo, accorhitels, etc) available:)"
"Superb beef burger and pizza, great hospitality","Really tasty beef burger - it hit all the right notes! we had an enjoyable meal, good ambience and great hospitality from Sayed and Kimmy. would definitely return for more soon."
Good lunch experience at Winestone,"Decided to try this place for my mom's birthday and was pleasantly surprised with the offerings. we had the grilled pork chop, salmon and the beef cheek spaghetti.
the restaurant manager Sayed was the most hospitable and ensured that we had a good meal. even shared with me which benefits gave me the best valvue. he even presented my mom with a small cake and sang her a song. she was really surprised and happy. glad to have made the choice for a lunch here!

good space and vibe for a business lunch or an ibtimate chat!"
Dinner on a Saturday night,"Great service, ambience and food! Staff was very attentive and friendly. Would definitely come again."
Thank You! 👍🏼💖,"A dear couple pampered us to a night of double date and double birthday celebration at Winestone. Such a good choice! Nice ambience, good food and great service by Sayed Ahmed. Enjoyed the evening thoroughly. Thank you!"
Dining at Winestone Stevens,"Staffs are very approachable and attentive. Thanks to Catherine, Giselle, May and Yusoff for a very fine dining experience. Restaurant ambience is very cozy and food is great. A go to place for a satisfying dinner with friends and family. lol"
"Great Ambiance, Friendly Staff",It’s such a cozy place to catch up with friends. The food is good! I don’t usually eat oyster but the oysters were fresh. Shout out to Mr. Sayed for an excellence service!
Below Average Dining Experience,"Came here with high expectations, but found the quality of food to be below average. There was a hair in my starter (beer battered calamari). Ordered lamb rack in my main course which was again very avaerage in terms of quality of meat as well as preparation. Dessert was also average at best.

Would not recommend the place"
Good place for chilling and dining,"This place is a gem for dining and chilling, would recommend for a visit to eat. The T-Bone is very big and delicious! The staff here is very polite, have a pleasant experience when dining here"
Good ambience and spacious dining,"Food here is wonderful, do try the T bone medium rare. The chicken pasta is savoury as well. Worth a try! Staffs are friendly and polite, had a good time with my friends!"
Nice dinner place,The service was impeccable especially from both managers. Very friendly crew and good food too! Had a pleasant birthday surprise.
"Lovely food, Friendly staff","celebrated my anniversary with my bf w amazing food and catherine, may & yusof (our waiters) even came up with a cute song/jingle for us ♥️ the sweetest!"
Wonderful lunch,"I made a reservation via DiningCity app but the restaurant doesn't sem to have a record of it. Nevertheless we were given a seat immediately as it wasn't crowded. It was National Day and ""discounts do not apply"". I have no problem with that except I really do not need to be reminded 3 times within 5 minutes.

We were later attended to by a Mr Sayed, who is most friendly and attentive. He constantly checked that everything is ok, and made good recommendations with regard to food and wine. His excellent service certainly made my day. I will definitely consider coming again."
Birthday celebration,"The staff serving us was very considerate and had excellent service! Will visit again. Their names were: Yusof, Catherine, Jeselle"
Great service and ambience,"Food was great, staff were friendly, service was also wonderful. Thank you Winestone for a leisurely dinner"
Family dinner,Excellent food and service. Jeselle has been attentive to our request and provided great service. Very happy with the restaurant
"Great food, great service!","Had a wonderful evening of food and drinks at Winsestone. We were served by Katherine, Yusof and Jeselle with great service. All of them were outstanding in their service. The seafood risotto and lobster tail pasta was exceptionally well prepared by the kitchen. The restaurant ambience was cosy and peaceful. Will definitely be back again!"
"Great ambience, good wine, great service","Had a wonderful evening of wine and dine at Winsestone. Great service from the excellent team there. We were served by Katherine and Jeselle. As well as Sayeed. All of them were outstanding in their service. We ordered what was recommended by Katherine and Jeselle and the food was great, especially the beef cheek pasta which we repeated the order. The recommended wine was also excellent. The restaurant ambience was cosy and peaceful. Will definitely be back again."
Excellent place for a lunch date!,"Food was great, got the kurobuta pork and cataplana with free flow bread. Seafood was fresh! Great deal with Burpple or entertainer app. Service was great, very attentive and friendly. Ambience is lovely with soft music in the background. Wines are really reasonable, per glass starts from 8. Reccomend!"
First timers,food was lovey. Sevice was very great! Will come again. Food was decent amount. Was full after our main course
Compliment,"It was our first time at this restaurant but it will definitively not be our last. Sayed and his team were amazing and attentive throughout our dinner. We were initially seated at a spot where the lights were too bright and Sayed promptly arranged us to cosy seating. Food and ambience were great. They even brought us a mango cheesecake after knowing we were celebrating our anniversary, which also tasted great as well. All in all, it was a truly wonderful experience. Well done Sayed and team! You guys deserved full marks!"
"Great food, best value","And really good service too! The pastas and pizzas are amazing. Comfortable seating arrangement, romantic ambience."
Cozy Environment and Great Service,"The service and ambience was great. Syed and his team made our dining experience a great one. The only thing that could have been improved was the pork chop, which was slightly dry. Other than that, it was a great dining experience."
Great Experience,"My husband and I had our anniversary dinner at Winestone. Being first-time customers here, I was very impressed with their service as they knew their work very well. I would like to thank Sayed who was able to introduce wine that matches our main course

Secondly, I will also like the complement Catherine for being meticulous and going the extra mile with her service. Food quality wise was great, portion of food was just right!

Will recommend and come back again"
Nice dinner,Nice ambience for birthday celebration ! Mains were good and 1 for 1 deal on burpple. Great night spent here with nice service
First visit,"Having received some vouchers for Winestones I decided to try this restaurant. We ordered the steak, salmon fillet and egg chorizo from the weekend brunch menu lunch. We were very satisfied with the food, esp the steak. If I have one feedback it's for the chorizo eggs. The way it was thinly sliced didn't do justice to Chorizos! Ambience was good & Service was impeccable, thanks to Sayed and Syed."
Excellent restaurant.,"Excellent location, ambience was great, peaceful, ideal for conversation. Sayed was friendly and provide good recommendations and suggestions."
Birthday,Excellent service and food. All staff were attentive and offered gd recommendations. We were greeted by Sayed was great and very friendly...
"Nice place, wished the menu selection could be more though","Nice place with very nice music. Ambience and food is very lovely, nice place to hang out with family and friends. Only wished that the menu selection for the brunch could be more though (11-3). We only had a few dishes to select from, would have liked it if there was more variety. Otherwise, lovely place with delicious food."
Low Hygiene Protocols,"Ambience at the restaurant was excellent. Service was average. We ordered a pizza and after two of us took a slice each we realised its very cold and stale. We requested for the pizza to be replaced. They took back the pizza but instead of serving a new one, they put it back in the oven and mildly warmed it. It looks like they could not really warm it for too long since it had rocket leaves on top. When they brought it back the pizza was worse.

How does a restaurant of this stature put a pizza that has been partially consumed back in the oven? It is the same oven that is used to make food for other guests. When I told them that this is poor hygiene protocol and needs to be reported to NEA, one of the waiters (Sayed) said they welcome me reporting this matter to NEA! I was almost shocked to hear this. I did report the matter to Singapore Food Agency immediately.

Now I had to fight with the restaurant to delete the pizza from the bill. They refused and after some arguments still included the pizza in the bill but gave me a takeaway! Will not be visiting this restaurant anymore."
Wedding Lunch,"Had a wedding lunch organised at Winestone by mr. Deep and his competent team. The entire wedding was charted in an absolute organised manner. Our beloved guest gave numerous positive feedbacks that the food was delectable and the service was tremendous. No regret holding our wedding at this gratified venue. People who are plannig to hold thier wedding or sourcing for good food, pls contact Mr. Deep for a seamless wedding planning."
Good stuff,Food quality is good. Service also great. Recommends were good. We really enjoyed ourselves. Sayed was of great help to my family.
Great Ambience and Service,"Good food, quiet and serene environment. Great personalized service. Mr Sayed who served us was genuine and personable. Attention to details and catered warmly to our needs. A great experience."
Great birthday celebration!,Great service and great food! Reserved for birthday dinner. Had a beautiful ambiance and enjoyable dinner :)
Birthday celebration,The service was really good. They made us felt comfortable and we enjoyed the meal without stress. Overall the ambience and the service staff did a good job providing us a place to have a nice meal
Worth A Try,"I am a pizza fan, so was looking forward to eating here. Generally, the food was of a good standard, using fresh ingredients.

The bread was fresh, but did have a slightly heavy doughy consistency. I loved the fennel and avocado salad, but did not really taste much fennel. But the avocado slices and the arugula etc were fresh. My wife liked her porcini truffle soup.

I went for the Rustica pizza with chorizo. It took longer to arrive than my wife’s beef cheek pasta, but it was freshly made and the olives gave a nice tartness to the dish. There was a little too much onions for me but, overall, it was a tasty dish. The beef cheek pasta was okay and the meat was fork tender, but my wife felt the sauce tasted more bovril-like, rather like a old school Hainanese beef hor fun.

Service was friendly but the time between the starters and the mains was about 50 minutes, which was a tad long for lunch when diners might be in a hurry. The decor was okay and the dishes were presented well. The apple crumble was okay as well.

A previous reviewer said there was free parking, but that is only at the hotel basement carpark and from 12-2 pm, whereas most diners would park at the paid surface lots next to the eatery. Moreover, the hotel carpark was not noticeable from the entrance, and there was quite a bit of renovations works at the entranceway. The hotel was also earmarked as a Covid-quarantine site and access was restricted."
GREAT FOOD AND WARM SERVICE!,"Had a wonderful dinner with fam at Winestone. They are currently running a Oh-my-shrooms 4 course dinner at $78++ per pax. We tried everything except salmon. They were competent and I would recommend:
Smoked duck with Hon-Shimeji mushrooms, peso prawns with maitake mushrooms and tomatoes, grilled ribeye with morel mushrooms and truffle burnt cheesecake.

We also ordered a couple of our favourite mains, Winestone Supreme Platter, Rack of Lamb, Kurobuta Pork Chop and added a Grilled Seafood Platter this time round which were all very well executed.

Love the ambience here too given the large space but yet service was not comprised even on a busy Saturday night. The crew was attentive and warm. Will be back for sure!"
Visit to Winestone was Fabulous,"We had a birthday celebration there and my family thoroughly enjoyed it. Service was top notch and attentive and when my son couldnt eat, gave complimentary fries. food was great . Gave us a
cake for My father bday as a surprise. Will come back again . Well done team"
Great food! Great service!,"The food is amazing as always. Totally love the promotion but what really stood out for me was Jeselle’s service.

She was courteous and helpful from the start. Very friendly too and outgoing, definitely made my experience there really good. It was my second time here, and I’ve always had a great experience.

Would definitely come back and bring more friends."
Winstone resa,"Went for a family meal, the ambiance was very good and food especially the pizza and risotto was very delicious. Would like to commend Catherine who served us as she was very attentive and friendly."
Good food and service,"Food, service and ambience were wonderful. Brought my boyfriend enjoyed the birthday surprise from the restaurant at the end."
Great place to chill,"My friends and I came here to celebrate my friend's birthday. Really love the ambience and food. Excellent service from all the staff especially Jeselle, Cath, Sayed, and May. They made sure the celebrant enjoyed her birthday. We all had a great time as well. Will definitely come back to try their other food."
Great night out at Winestone,"The entire group of friends are so impressed and delighted with Sayed service. One of the most memorable dining experience we had!

Kudos and keep up the great service and effort Sayed!"
Birthday Celebration,Called and reserved a table to celebrate for my mum and sister birthday. They prepared two cakes for us and provide us with excellent service. Deeply appreciate the service given. The food was amazing as well. Would definitely recommend.
Birthday celebration,"First time at Winestone and we really enjoyed ourselves. Food and service were great. The Tueday oyster promotion was well worth it, with the oysters being fresh & plump. Goes well with the Pol Remy Brut & Luberon Blanc recommended by Catherine. For mains, we had black Angus MB3+ ribeye and rack of lamb. The Joel Gott Zinfandel recommended by Catherine pairs well with our mains.
Finally the staff also sprang a surprise for my wife with a birthday song and cake.
Great ending to a wonderful night.
Thank you once again to Catherine & her colleagues for making this an unforgettable birthday celebration for my wife!"
Birthday party,"Excellent food especially the lamb racks, great service with very welcoming staffs, will definitely return again"
Dinner visit,"I like to thank Ms.May & Catherine for their professional service. They are friendly, helpful & courtesy staff. We enjoyed your yummy food , affordable prices& Ambience excellent."
Excellent Service and Food,The food and service were top notch. We had the steak which was not cooked to our expectations but Sayed immediately resolved the issue by asking us what could be done to change the steak and providing us with a new plate of steak cooked to our medium rare standard with an explanation of what happened. Thank you Sayed for the excellent service and it really made us want to come back for a repeat visit.
Birthday dinner - awesome experience,The foods was pretty good but even better the service was great! Super friendly staff! Loved the prawn risotto and steak!
Disappointed 2nd visit,"This is my 2nd visit & it was a shock and disappointment since our 1st visit was wonderful…
Firstly waitress described a food item in the menu wrongly, usual serving of bread was forgotten until we asked for it, food came 45mins late (restaurant was less than half filled), doneness of lamb and beef was mixed up.
We thank the staff and chef who apologise as well as to explain the situation but truly the whole experience was already dampened. Finally they offered a free desert and I hoped it would salvage the situation but alas it was not to be…as the tart n sorbet was so-so.
Truly hope to see improvements should I visit again…"
Great food and excellent service,Was pleasantly surprised with the food especially the signature prawn pasta and the great service from Mr Sayed. He recommended the food and was great to chat with. Excellent five star service.
Excellent service with good food,"My family enjoyed our dinner very much! Food was good and service was excellent as always. Tenderloin and mango cheesecake was good. Really want to commend Sayed who provided such good service, making the dinner very memorable! Love the ambience too."
Superb services,"Catherine is second to none in delivering superb services, she is very attention detailed and with excellent attitude"
