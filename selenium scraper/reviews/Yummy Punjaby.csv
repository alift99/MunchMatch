I tried the punjabi curry with mint paratha.I will give it a 5 star rating!,"The food is very tasty , fresh and healthy -Everything including the pickle ! One place I don’t mind to go and eat out . Recommend highly to give it a go at this restaurant …"
The most tasty Indian restaurant in Singapore,"This is my third time to visit this restaurant it’s very delicious and clean. Also the team their are very respectful, helpful, and fast. Specifically MG he is always smiling and he is very fast. I have tried many Indian restaurants the last two months in Singapore and I can tell and guarantee that this one is the best and you have to try it. You can feel the authentic spices in your mouth. Also the prices are reasonable and the quantity is perfect. I love this Resturant it’s the best place that I chose when I want to treat myself l.

Waad"
Excellent food,It was yummy and tasty breakfast. We had ordered for team breakfast and eveyone enjoyed it. and it was nicely packed. Thank you very much
Amazing Food!!,"We tried the veg Manchurian and sag, it was delicious! They went out of their way to cater to dietary restrictions and it was overall a great experience.
The last time we tried the malai chicken tikka and the fish to go with the fresh crisp beer. Again two thumbs up there!!"
Simply delicious. Must try!,A place that makes you wanna go back for more. I frequent here for their naans and curry and trying out a new dish each time I visit. It never disappoints me.
Writing this review following a visit and take away orders for my wife’s Birthday on back to back days,"Below were the dishes ordered
01) Veg and Non-Veg platter
02) Chicken and Veg Biryani
03) dal Makhani
04) Mutton Bhona Ghosh
Without a doubt all the above dishes were absolutely awesome , tasted like home made and fresh,

Highly recommend Yummy Punjaby as they can cater to your taste. Well done and keep it up"
Must try for a wonderful experience.,"Ordered family special delivery set and it was indeed 'Yummy' both in quality (each items) and portion size (more than sufficient for 4 persons).
Must try for a wonderful experience."
"Love their desserts, naans and sauces","We came here mainly for their desserts. While it is easy to get gulab jamun at most restaurants, gajar halwa (an indian pudding made with fresh carrots, milk, sugar, ghee and nuts) seems to be more difficult to find. Explaining why they stopped serving this dessert, a waiter at another restaurant explained it's rather time consuming to make. The other dessert we love is the ras malai. I prefer this to rasguilla as this is coooked in sugar syrup while rasmalai is further immersed in milk. The second time we went to the restaurant, we tried their garlic and methi naan. Loved the garlic naan which was full of garlic. Couldn't quite figure out the taste of methi (fenugreek), which is some sort of a herb. We tried the chicken kasturi, with a rich tasty sauce. The pineapple raita was Ok - it's a mix of pineapples and salted yoghurt. The taste was fine - just felt it was something we could have easily put together ourselves and it cost as much as the dessert which takes a lot more effort to cook."
Yummylicious Indian & Indo-Chinese food,"I have always been a fan of this place for dal makhani , Malai kofta , garlic naan and chilli chicken ..love the ambience of the restaurant and always a good place to enjoy evening with family and Frenz!!"
Best Indian food in singapore,"This is the best Indian Resturant in singapore that I have been to in my last 4 years of stay in singapore....whether it’s Indian Chinese , or North Indian...you can be assured of the best quality at reasonable price... amazing place for family get togethers or office outings with colleague for a drink or snack."
Lunch takeaway,Timely delivery. Seven different items. Excellent taste. Made it an enjoyable day. Will definitely make it a regular go to place.
Delicious food. Great experience.,Lovely place with good atmosphere. Wide range of tasty food for both vegetarians and meet eaters. Must visit! Highly recommended!
Lovely evening,"The food is always great at Jummy Punjabi, but what sets this place apart is that you are always welcomed as a friend rather than a customer! Such a pleasant experience!"
Love is all around- in the food and ambience !,"The food touched my heart as it’s made with a lot of love !
Whole wheat breads here are the best I have ever had in SG, impressive tandoori rotis !
Highly recommend the chicken tikka masala, and yellow dal tadka is must try- it’s unlike dal in most shops and restaurants - but full of homely love!
Great music in the ambience, peaceful and well lit.
Great for group dinners or lunch or romantic meals with your partner!
Btw The bar is stocked with the best deals !"
Home Delivery,"Yummy Punjabi can really do better and increase their standards if they start taking customers feedback seriously. Unfortunately, they don’t do it . This is my second time when I have order for some food and they have sent me , half cooked -burnt samosa. Highly disappointed with their food quality."
Poor food and poor staff,"Hi, last time I visited there. The restaurant review is very good but I haven't see anything like that. When I enter in restaurant there was a smell. And not enough staff also. I'll was siting around 20 minutes. Staff comes very late. I'll order of food Dahi ke kabab it's not available,that's fine then I ordered of chicken tikka. That's was not cooked properly. Then I order of Chinese chicken manchurian or fried chicken rice. Manchurian was very dark and extra bitter. Totally tasteless, rice was good.but I give you advise...Please give good food to guest and make good atmosphere of your restaurant. Thanks"
"Memorable Evening at Yummy Punjaby, Singapore","As we wanted to explore indian cuisine in Singapore, we decided to try the Yummy Punjaby restaurant at 321, Alexandra Road. We were prepared for usual indian stuff but were surprised after seeing the presentation and the sumptuous delicacies. Specially chicken and fish tikka with super delicious garlic naan with dal makhani. Everything was meticulously arranged and served.

And not to forget the good variety of alcoholic beverages within the reasonable reach. We were very happy with our choice of choosing Yummy Punjaby as an evening to remember forever.

Our 100% recommendations for a visit to this Restaurant."
Excellent yumilicious,"We stayed at Park hotel Alexandra for a week and dined at yummy punjabi almost all the days. Tried almost all dishes, delicious, fresh and healthy& hygienic Indian taste.. nice decent set up for family dining. Very friendly staff."
"Soya chaps, Dal Makhni and much more",We are vegetarians but there is no dearth of choices that taste as yummy as the name sounds. Their food has a distinct pie Punjaby taste that you will find in an authentic dhaba cooked food - the owner IJ told me their spices come from India sent by his mother... go for it!
Great little local Indian,Always fresh and quick. Been here very many times. It's a great spot after work for a quick snack or large meal if you can't get into central Singapore.
Food Quality and location,I had been almost all parts of India plus I visiting other countries just because of my Job.The food quality which I found there is Marvelous really yummy.Staff over their so nice gave me feeling as I am not away from my home. Really Yummy...
OMG the food is YUM!,"I stayed at the hotel next door Hotel Alexander, nice place.
The Yummy Punjab was so good, we could sit outside in the lovely Singapore weather drinks beers, eat and eat the lovely food. Ladies who served were very nice.
So if you stay at the hotel, eat at Yummy Punjab :)"
A Lunch party,"Yummy Punjaby one of the best north Indian restaurant in Singapore. The aloo paratha, dal fry and sweet lassi are my favorite combo here. Try this out. Recommended!"
It’s just not yummy!,I’m sorry but for the price this was way below expectation. Aloo gobi tasted like was made last week. Fish tikka masala bland and mostly fish skin. Nana bread and service great! Won’t be going again!!!!
Tasty Indian Cuisine!,"We were happy to see the Yummy Punjaby at the Alexandra Road on our visit to the City. They serve tasty Indian cuisine, we enjoyed their Tandoori Roti, Yellow Dal and Aloo Dum Punjabi with Beer. The dishes were well cooked and not too spicy. The staff were friendly and helpful. The decor is nice and we enjoyed our dinner."
"Best Dal Makhani, Convenient Location","I am a regular customer at the restaurant. Whenever I have hunger pangs for some good north indian food, this is my go to place.

Also very convenient location, next to Ikea. So whenever we go Ikea shopping, the dinner has to be at Yummy Punjaby. :)"
Great food and service with a smile,We have been frequenting Yummy Punjaby for a few years now (earlier at the Arab Street) and now at Alexandra Road. The most striking quality is that the food is still delicious and the service is warm and welcoming. Absolutely love going there. Definitely recommend to anyone in the vicinity to try the food.
Good Indian Cuisine with a Punjabi touch,"Located in The Park Hotel complex, the restaurant offers an array of North Indian Cuisine at affordable rates. The food was good and tasty with a quick and fast service. Loved the Baingan Bartha with nice rotis."
Very nice food!,"This is the only restaurant in Queenstown-Redhill area that serves quality North Indian food. I have visited this restaurant a few times and found the food very impressive. Paneer shaslik kabab, Sarson ka saag were very tasty. Naans & rotis were served hot and well cooked. I am very happy to have such a quality Indian restaurant in my neighbourhood."
Terrible,Quality of food on delivery is really bad! Food floats in a lard of oil (looks like an oil spill)! Tasteless
"Good food, good service",Authentic north indian cuisine. Very clean silverware. Great location (just beside IKEA). Good service. Good variety to choose from.
Excellent food,"I love this place, went for the first time and was delighted by the authentic Indian food, love the food here, recommend this place for anyone who is looking for good Indian food with a fabulous ambience."
"Indian Food - Yes. Punjabi Food - Nah, Nah, Nah! DEFINATELY NOT!","For the longest time ever, I wanted to check out Yummy Punjaby.
And finally I did last week after 2 failed attempts(once they were closed between 3-6pm, and again on a particular Tuesday(where they are not open).
The menu is wideeeeeeeeeee! The have loads and loads to choose(Indian chinese fusion food). I had the chicken briyani(briyani rice cooked with gravy and chicken pieces - so it way too wet and soggy!) and the chicken saag(boneless chicken in the darkest and fake-est green coloring gravy that you can imagine).
The food is Indian. But this isn't PUNJABI food. Punjabi food has its distinct flavour - there was none. I was disappointed. I was hoping this could be my 2nd Punjabi haunt. But it failed. It was like any other Indian restaurant in Serangoon Road. I suppose, I should have known better as there were no Punjabi customers in there but more Madrasis - I guess the former they already knew that this isn't Punjabi unlike that other Punjabi place in Race Course Road.
So if you want Indian food, or Indian fusion food - that's what they serve.
But if you want really yummy flavourful Punjabi food - this is NOT the place. Sadly."
"Not friendly to kids, average food, not worth the price","We went to the restaurant at 7:30 PM . There was not another diner, we were the only ones. We had 3 small kids with us, and when we requested them to provide smaller sized plates for the kids (which is a standard request at any Singapore restaurant) the waiter made a funny face as if we were requesting something very special. Then, after they had laid out the plates, they asked us to move to another small table . The waitress was quite rude and when I tried to give her some feedback politely, she responded in a very aggressive manner.
Food was average and quite pricey. Will not recommend and we will never go back. I believe they have gotten their entire village in Punjab to post positive reviews for them, otherwise this place cannot be getting such rave reviews. As you can see from the attached pic, my visit was a genuine one."
Yaar velli,Excellent place Sandeep sir loves it so do I because ajith sir and guru sir come here Discounted Ani also comes
"Very tasty food, and really nice staff","Randomly found this place while playing darts tonight. The staff were exceptionally kind and helpful, they even brought my food over to me (they knew us was just down the walkway).

I ended up ordering the butter chicken, some butter naan and some samosa Chaat.

I love butter chicken, and this was a great version ... very flavorful (creamy, warm spices, and bright), a little Smokey, with big chunks of juicy chicken. The samosa chaat was well balanced. The Butter naan was fresh and crispy.

Overall a surprisingly tasty meal, will definitely come again when I’m in the area."
Its tooooo YUMMMMMMY,The Preparation of Food at Yummy Punjaby is really tooo yummy.........Enjoyed with my dear ones. Have an outing for a dinner it will be a great !
Good food,"Visited on two occasions in the last few months. Food was good on both occasions (biryani, saag paneer, dal, etc) - authentic North Indian. Service though on both occasions could be improved - its friendly but could be made more customer focussed and efficient."
"delightful North Indian Punjabi treats -you cant go wrong with the traditional dal makhni, paneer tikka and gobi!","delightful North Indian Punjabi treats -you cant go wrong with the traditional dal makhni, paneer tikka and gobi! do try the pani puri! must do again. menu is very wide with a lot of choices for veg and non-veg. service is slightly slow but food makes up for everything!"
Amazing food,Love the cholle bhature and the paneer paratha! Finally found a place in singapore that serves authentic North Indian food that not only tastes great but also is pocket friendly.
Amazing Staff - Great Food,"I ate dinner at Yummy Punjbay for almost all of my Singapore trip of 2 weeks!
Ambience - 7/10 - Regular Indian Vibes!
Music - 9/10 - Nice Indian Punjabi Playlist!
Food - 8/10 - Very close to authentic Indian!
Price - 7/10 - Not Inexpensive! Meal for two SG$ 80-90 (without Alcohol)

Best Saag and Missi Roti,"Wonderful food, comfortable seating. Would surely visit again! Must try the sarso saag and afgan soya chaap"
Family meal,"Delicious food, cooked fresh and great service in a comfortable, small restaurant. We were all pleased with our meal, would recommend."
The perfect family Indian restaurant,"The food has delicious authentic flavors, the ambiance is great and service is really good. Prices at yummy punjabi are reasonable for the quantity they serv. It's an amazing family restaurant that I highly recommend."
really yummy,excellent food excellent service excellent staff ....no words to describe...next time and every time i will visit Yummy Punjaby
Great food !,"The food is authentic punjabi / Indian and best eaten warm. The service at restaurant is nice and Responsive to special requests including less spicy food etc - especially reccomend afghani soya chap , Gol grappa and saag! and very nice Malai kofta also !"
Good food,"First time there, dishes are cooked upon order, tasty and good not so spicy. Naan are well done and nice. Will go back again"
Extremely lovely food,The food here is lovely. Makes me remember Indian food really. This is must eat place specially for Indian. I highly recommend this place to everybody out there who are fond of good food.
Yummy Punjaby Diwali outdoor Carering,"We had ordered for outdoor catering at our condominium for the annual Diwali party for over 70 Pax, the food was excellent and true to its name Yummy Punjaby!!! Finger licking good yummy Punjabi food and an experience not to miss..
Keep up the good work team IJ..."
Superb but heavy !!,Lovely food - recommend for lunch. The paneer Sabzi was out of the world and dal was good too. But quite filling so be prepared!
The title of restaurant is an irony !,"This is my worst experience in terms of service in Singapore ! we were just out for a stroll last evening when we happen to see this restaurant (Alexandra road , downstairs of Park Hotel) , we thought to have some snacks , when we went inside and asked is this place open as it was 6-ish , they said yes . Then when we went inside they asked us to sit outside , then we thought ok ,No worries ! we sat outside ... lots of mosquitoes (rare in Singapore) .... started to bite us... then we said can we sit inside , they said we are not ready now.... how can they be not ready after placing order ... the person who received order was very rude and then food arrived... we had ordered chicken chili and Carrot Halwa , Manchurian , paneer pakoda . Except Halwa all dishes had high salt and tasted bad .Lot of added color in the food. the quality that is offered at that price is not good... I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone... as food , service every thing is worst !!!!"
Good food but lacking a bit in decor,"If you want to eat in a quiet, swish surroundings this is not the place to go. Tables seem very close together and the music they play whilst sounding Indian is very loud and not great conducive to conversation! Having said that, if you want good food at a reasonable price then this could be the place to eat. There was a good choice of dishes on the menu and the two curries we chose was very tasty"
Good food,Good indian food option for indians. Staff are very nice. Must visit. Nonveg is very good. All options are available here.
Best Indian food ever in my life.,"The food was absolutely wonderful,it was fresh, properly prepared and a great value for the price. I would highly recommend it.
Specially the taste was truly enjoyable. At one moment I felt like I am back in India.

Restaurant Staff were well groomed. They all were smiling and greeting everyone.Their product knowledge was amazing. They helped me with so many things.

Best service and delicious food made my day in yummy punjaby"
Good food,"Visited on two occasions in the last few months. Food was good on both occasions (biryani, saag paneer, dal, etc) - authentic North Indian. Service though on both occasions could be improved - its friendly but could be made more customer focussed and efficient."
Superior North Indian,Healthy portions and distinctive spices across an unusually broad menu. Very reliable Skinny space. Annoying decorative lasers and funny video TV.
Super Yummy Punjabi Food,"To be honest I have yet to visit this restaurant but I catered food from Yummy Punjaby for a birthday party. And I have no regrets and would surely love to write my review on the food and service which I am sure would be the same if I was to dine there.
The food was medium spicy and well laid out. The Kofta vegetable curry was thick, creamy, a little tangy base with firm and well flavoured koftas - not soggy though. The Dal Makhani had a unique aromatic blend of spices falvour which came through quite well when I took a spoonful of it. I also ordered the following: Butter Chx (my guest loved it), Rogan Gosh (feedback from my guest - the mutton was soft and juicy), Lacha parathas were well made and soft. Bryani rice had a little too many mixed of spices though. The Vegetable Korma was not too bad. But the Fruit Spritzer was a good choice for a party - great fizzy fruit punch which was not too sweet; refreshing. Thank You Yummy Punjaby and Inderjeet!"
Authentic North Indian Food,"If you are looking for authentic North Indian food, this is the place to go. Starters and Main Course are both delicious. Love the food there and u can enjoy punjabi music too. Staff is very cheerful and friendly. Visited it 2 times and no complaints."
A saviour for Indian in Singapore,Very hungry unable to get indian food at the place of my stay. Suddenly saw this place. yummy food with large variety. good hospitality. Cleanliness is good can be better. very sweet host. Food taste and options didnt allow me miss Indian taste. Chinese food only thing that needs correction in terms of taste.
Best Naan Ever!,"We went in with low expectations and it's unfortunately surrounded by some shady pubs/discos but the food was simply outstanding. We had chicken 65, dal makhani, samosa and butter Naan. Everything was top notch, but the naan was heavenly. We've not eaten such good naan even back home in India. Will definitely be going there frequently."
Lovely place for an Indian meal,Really enjoyed the service and the food. Butter Paneer dish was to die for. Mango Lassi was a perfect end to my meal.
Costly with very average food,"We ordered sweet lassi, chicken clear soup, sizzler fish, dal amritsari and rotis.

Lassi was very sweet and very thin. Felt like drinking water.

Chicken clear soup was average in taste. My daughter ate chicken from it.
Fish sizzler was over done and felt like i was eating paneer.

Daal was good.

Ambience of restaurant is fine. Staff is okay."
Great service!,"It's not often that you get really good service in Singapore, but they look after you well here. Good food too. Thank you!"
Great Indian Halal Food,"excellent taste and choice for Indian food lovers, little expensive but worth going. Below Park hotel Alexandra Singapore."
Service is good but food a big no no !!,"We ordered chat items and chicken soup after eating that I literally puked .. this happened twice , hope they are using fresh products to prepare food. Though chat items were nice and service was also ok ."
Fantastic Indian food in Singapore,Must go if you are looking for good Indian food in Singapore. Went with family and enjoyed the Laccha parathas with Various veg and non veg dishes. Enjoyed.
"Poor service, average food","Due to it's convenient location (near Alexandra Road IKEA), I wanted to give this restaurant a try but was disappointed upon arrival as staff were not ready to serve guests. They were also not knowledgeable about the food in the menu. Had Chicken Tikka Masala & Mutton Biryani which was average & took a long time to come even tho' there were no other guests in the restaurant."
Good food - staff need a bit of training,"The chicken dishes my wife and I ordered were very tasty. We enjoy eating Indian food and to find a good Indian restaurant in Singapore next to the Alexandra Hotel where we were staying was a pleasant surprise. We had a really nice chat with the owner - a very nice fellow. The wait staff do need a bit of training though. They didn't seem to have much idea of what they were doing. Not much help explaining the menu, getting the order wrong and no attention during the meal to fill empty water. The food is very expensive but I guess that is Singapore!"
Dinner with Wife and Friend - Really yummy,"Our first time to Yummy Punjabi...the best ever North Indian food we had tasted in Singapore...It is absolutely yummy...the paneer is too soft...kinda melted...tandoori roti/puthina prata excellent...staff were very friendly...one of them,Selvindajith Kaur (sorry if I got your name wrong) who served us made us feel as if we are already a regular customer...
Price - it is Expensive, although happy to pay for the quality and tasty food.."
Lunch with friends,Yummy Panjaby very nice food taste like those in Punjab. Staff are friendly and attentive. Service was excellent. Food presentation was authentic. Highly recommended.
Good Indian food!,It's a relief to find vegetarian Indian food in this part of Singapore. The food is expensive though. A simple meal for two would cost around 30 SGD... but we're in Singapore so that's pretty expected.
Yummy really punjaby,"Amidst the business centres, it is nice to have an authentic punjabi food restaurant in Singapore Their food is not very spicy so that everyone : even non Indians can relish the food. Aloo gobhi and dal makhani was really awesome Great job done!"
"Excellent Food, Superb Service","Great Food, Excellent service. We host regular get-togethers where all catering is from Yummy Punjaby. Our guests (of varying nationalities) have always complimented the food."
Best catering in Singapore,Ordered chat items from YP for catering. Received fantastic reception from whoever had the food. No hassles in negotiations as well.
"Excellent food , great prices",Excellent dining experience. Nice ambience Ang great service. The roti was to die for. Plus other signature dishes. Will definitely come back.
Excellent Food,Authentic indian food. Best north indian food in the town. The food was delicious and served in good quantity. The whole surrounding is north Indian and excellent variety of indian cousines.
Not bad,I have eaten more delicious Indian food many times so I can’t say that here is good/best. Prices are a bit expensive. Atmosphere is ok.
BEST RESTAURANT SINCE CANADA,"IT WAS AMAZING!!!! We have been to so many restaurants in Singapore AND WE HATE ALL OF THEM EXPECT for yummy PUNJABIIIIII. It is simply amazing. Everything on the menu is great. We went there more than once. The service is outstanding and they make you feel just like family. Never been to such a welcoming restaurant. It feels just like home!!!!
Thank you Yummy Punjaby for making feel at home! This was one of the best parts of traveling to Singapore."
Amazing food and hospitality,Let me start with food. The best food I have ever eaten. I have eaten food for continuous three weeks. The quality of food is excellent. Hospitality is great. I am back in India and I still miss the food.
Delicious food!,"Love the vegetarian ghobi manchurian,vegetarian biryani and samosa!! My all time favourite whenever i visit this place.. Good food, good place !!"
Healthy authentic indian food,Mango lassi is a must try! Lovely ambiance and friendly staff. Healthy authentic indian food is hard to find.
Getting better for Seniors,"Reviewed this place last year with a cautious ""shows promise"" tag. Certainly much improved on this family visit. We shared four spicy dishes and rice and found them all good standard. Service was fine and overall looking like a successful Indian restaurant should. Keep up the good work."
Good curry,"Very tasty chicken kardai and spinach paneer dish washed down with a large bottle of Kingfisher. The garlic naan wasn't the best, being too thin and greasy but apart from that a nice meal."
Home delivery,We ordered home delivered food from Yummy Punjaby on Diwali. Fantastic food and fast delivery. Spoke to Inderjeet at the restaurant and he went out of his way to deliver our special request which was out of the menu. I will not hesitate to recommend this restaurant for great Indian cuisine and professional service Thank you.
Yummy food at yummy panjaby,Excellent food and mouth watering dishes. Delicious dishes and One can feel the real Panjaby flavour in the dishes. Wonderful location. Will strongly recommend to visit once and taste the food if you haven’t been to yummy Panjaby.
Good Food,"Good Indian food in Singapore. If you are done with seafood and wants to eat spicy one, then ho for it."
Tasty Food & Quick Service,"I visited this restaurant with my family waling as its nearby my son's home. We ordered Indian vegetarian and non vegetarian food. All the side dishes were upto the mark. The best plus point is its quick service. It is centrally located also. If one wants to relish Indian food, sure to try and enjoy."
Hidden Gem,"Whilst staying at Park Hotel Alexandra I happened across this hidden gem. Yummy Punjaby (Naff name) is a small restaurant tucked away near the entrance to the hotel car park. First impressions as a guy from England was the fact it was populated by native Indians, I was the only European in there. Good sign. The ice cold draft beet was a welcome refreshment whilst I ordered. The meal was a delight, fresh, full of flavor and authentic. We took the chicken tikka masala and mutton rogan josh, wonderful."
Good Tandoori food and Curries,Recently we had an outdoor dinner with family and relatives from Zurich. They were very impressed with personalised service and great food. He promised to come back and try the Tandoori food again. Please keep up your quality and hope you will do better.
Tasty North Indian Food. Great Hospitality,Brilliant tasting food. Paneer wrap was amazing - the best I had to date. Preparation is nice and not too heavy which makes it easy to go back to Yummy Punjaby when feeling hungry. Great options for vegetarians. Excellent quality and great folks running the place. Kudos.
Good food!,The food is good. Authentic Indian food with a nice vibe in the restaurant. I recommend the sizzlers.
Amazing Indian food,Yummy Punjaby ...we visited n revisited while in Singapore for amazing food n hospitality. Must try their stuffed parathas . All the paneer preparations and dal take u closer to home . Best chefs and ever smiling staff is welcoming .
Awesome,"The ambiance, the food & the quantity & quality was fantastic. Have been to other joints serving India cuisine, but this one was outstanding. Really liked the place & the very hospitable hosts. If you are an Asian, must visit.. must dine at Yummy Punjaby, when in Singapore !"
Best food in town,Yummy punjaby is the best food joint ever visisted......they serve delicious food . I become a big fan and insists my freinds to have a visit. My kids enjoy the food as well.
Mark of great Indian food in Singapore!!,"This place is on top of my list for worthy Indian authentic food restaurants in Singapore. Have been a regular customer to this place for about a year mainly for its great ambiance, amazing food quality and service. A must visit restaurant for all the locals and visitors. Special mention for its Owner Mr. Indrajeet Singh who is great buddy for all its customers, he and his staff really takes good care."
Great north indian food,"Great north indian punjaby food.Afgani murgtikka and soyachop, Dal tadka, Naan basket and Mutton briyani was the best, service is good but it can be more better."
Great food!,The food is very tasty and good value for money. Highly recommend the tandoori chicken and reshmi kababs.
Yummy Punjabi true sense,Just had a lunch here. Good ambience. Super courteous staff. Good north indian preparation. Not very hard at pocket. Wifi given. Play english music . Must play hindi/punjabi music that shall go with the theme. Good combos but only at selected time.
Nice Restaurant with Good Indian Food,We have visited the Singapore in May 2017 and this is the only reason why we survive there. The only restaurant near our Hotel with Good and only Indian serving. The staff is also good. The service is excellent.
Lunch with a big group,"I liked the name so I planned to go there with my big group.
The place is bit small.
Service was good and food was also good. No complain or issues.
Starters and main course was all good and no one in the group said anything negative.

Little Pricy (mid to high) so group says that we may go some other place next time."
