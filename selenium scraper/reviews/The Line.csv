Best in town!,"This is my second visit. The buffet here definitely one of the best in Singapore, coupled with excellent service by Mdm New and Mr Nelson. Will definitely be back again soon."
Good food and staff,Friendly and helpful staff New and Nelson. They were thoughtful and cater to our needs. Went for our son and helper‚Äôs birthday celebration. The food were great with great variety to choose from. I
Kids Friendly Buffet,Good experience. My child enjoyed the food at The Line. Excellent service provided by Rachel. Highly recommended.
Fantastic Service Staff,Good food. Good selection Friendly and fantastic service. Especially from Mdm New Ms Ruby. Well done.
Great service at The Line,"Excellent environment and food. Commendable service from staff New who is fast, polite and has initiative to ensure our needs are met :)"
Amazing breakfast,"The breakfast spread at The Line is amazing. Many different cuisines and while the vegetarian options in some cuisines are limited, overall there‚Äôs a lot of vegetarian options as well. In fact they even bake fresh eggless croissants if requested.
The best section for me was the Indian cuisine especially the fresh Dosa and Uttapam.

Chef Ayyappa at the Indian section is super friendly and he ensures that you get the food exactly as you ask for. Even our young kids (both below 5 years) enjoyed the food cooked by the chef.

The one downside is that during peak season (we had visited during the Christmas holidays), there will be waiting to get a table so plan accordingly if you are visiting during peak season."
Fantastic Buffet Experience but with Signs of Deterioration,"It has always been wonderful dining at this establishment. You can always expect high quality food and service. The international spread was balanced and it's difficult to get disappointed by the variety offered.
The dessert station should be one of the highlights as it offered so many different dishes to choose from!

However, I am giving it 4/5 because there were some letdowns. A table was assembled on the spot even though I reserved it. The seafood selection and quality seems lackluster. Oysters weren't even offered. A fish dish (which I believe was grilled) was dry. There wasn't much gravy nor sauce to go with it. It wasn't trivial to uncover the pots (at Indian station) and find space to place the lids. And not to mention that those lids were really hot. Some handles were missing protective towels.

My experience was redeemed by the attending staff, Manoj New who had been attentive and went the extra mile to help us out on different requests. Thank you New!

I used to be more impressed by this place and it's a go-to whenever I want to impress my guests too. I hope the rough edges can be smoothened and it still remained as one of my top buffet dining locations!"
Birthday celebration,We went for dinner buffet to celebrate my hubby birthday. Great variety of choices available and kids friendly food choices available. Great service provided by Sarah and extra mile service for taking caring of needs of my kids. Thank you very much for the great service and good food! We will sure be back for more celebrations and occasions with The Line!
Great and wonderful,"Great atmosphere, wonderful food and staff. Been here for the third time. Every time experience just keeps getting better. Thank you Ruby, Ameen and Dolores."
Cute and lovely service,"New took care of our table and she was gorgeous, kind and helpful. Amazing selection of food, need Chicken rice next time. Thank you :)"
Great place to meet up with friends.,"Amazing spread of food. Love the desserts üòã Great service. Very attentive, especially, LingLing. She reminded us to get our desserts before closely, which was the best part of the buffet."
Fantastic buffet lunch,"A big range of buffet options ranging from Japanese, Chinese, western, Indian. The dessert range was fabulous. Brought a friend here for her birthday and was given a chocolate cake. Great service too by attentive staff."
Great food and service with all the Singaporean hits!,I visited with my wife and 2 young children. The food and service was great - I am a Singaporean living overseas and visiting the Line allowed me to have a taste of all the best Singapore food which I missed (the kid-friendly food was a great bonus). The service provided by Brianna and New was exceptional and the food quality was amazing and we will be back the next trip!
Good start!,The service atThe Line was lovely this morning. We had a great breakfast and kind attention from employee New Samer who obviously knows all the ropes. Thanks everyone for a really pleasant start to our day! :)
Great breakfast and service,With so many choices and fresh food. We love the conge and fresh fruit. We also get food service from New and Samer.
Great service at the Line at Shangri-La Singapore,"While morning buffet breakfasts are typically a crazy and hectic activity with hotel guests rushing to have their meals, I had an lovely experience seated at Neu‚Äôs and Sameer‚Äôs section - they were so attentive, working very hard to quickly clear the plates for our next dish, and helpful to top up or recommend things to try.

I would love it if more Resturant staff were as attentive and hardworking as Neu and Sameer :) thank you for the lovely morning!

(Breakfast dishes are the same every morning for the 2 days I came down - might be nice to have least few dishes ‚Äúnew‚Äù for variety).

Overall, always a great experience at The Line Shangri-La Singapore !!"
The Line - Great Service,"The dining experience at The Line was awesome. Great food and great customer service. Especially to the lady named, New. She was always attentive to all our needs and very friendly. Thumbs up."
Good food and service,"The food is very good with amazing service, would like to mention Mr Samar for his attentive and good service. I liked the verity of every cuisine."
Great food and excellent service,"My friends and I had an amazing experience during our lunch dated 8 Jan 2023, Shan Shan provided us great service. Will recommend The Line and will come back again!"
Excellent Christmas Eve Lunch buffet,"Excellent as always. Needs to be booked early as the holiday bookings close out fast.
Nice spread of items with dishes from various parts of the world.
Middle eastern and the fresh seafood really stand out.
Used plates are cleared away quickly
Service is great considering its a busy buffet."
Christmas Brunch,Seafood are fresh. Great food and excellent service. Their service never disappoints. We were served by Shan Shan. She is helpful and attentive. We‚Äôll definitely be back again.
Disappointing,"Haven‚Äôt been here for a couple of years. It has really deteriorated. Some of the options they used to have are gone. No miso soup, no dumplings, no chicken broth in the noodle bar, no one makes up the pasta any more.

Very few options of any appeal were left, and what we ate was very very ordinary. Disappointed."
A wonderful buffet to wrap up 2022,A Wonderful spread of Asian and international cuisine. Excellent service by friendly staff especially Shirley who served us.
Great food excellent service.,"The variety was extensive. Love the fresh ingredients at cold sections. The meats were cooked to melting perfection - beef cheeks : best ever. The desserts were fresh n nicely sized. Chef Michael at the salad bar served an interesting Raclette cheese. He patiently explained that it was best enjoyed heated and chatted with my son who is a cheese fan. Having found out it was our 22 wedding anniversary, he surprised us with a lovely choc cake. The impeccable and warm service made the dining experience a memorable one! We‚Äôll definitely be back again with more family n friends."
Excellent service,"Specially thanks to the line staff Angela and Ling ling , they were very friendly and attentive, with smiles all time. We had an excellent lunch today."
Wonderful experience,"Visited The Line for lunch with my friends today. Loved every Bit of the experience especially the dessert corner.
Pleasant staffs who served me include Angela, Shan Shan, Ameen and Doris who supported me much as I have difficulties in walking. Also special thanks to Victor who made sure all my needs were met well.

Thank you so much~"
Lunch with friends,Haven't been to The Line for a while. The spread is great. Love the dessert counter. Many thanks to Angela who surpised my friend with a birthday cake and Ameen and Dolores for their excellent service. They are very friendly and make the dining vety pleasant
Breakfast,Excellent service from Taya Raj will definitely be back. He gave me great food and was always smiling.
Anniversary,Great service by your staff Shirley. Good ambience and huge selection of food. Really enjoy our time at this restaurant.
Attentive service,"I was here for a casual lunch with friends. Having not visited in a few years, the crowd surprised men especially on a Monday lunch. It wouldn‚Äôt have been as pleasant an experience if not for Hadifa who made her best effort to be attentive in serving our table, and quick to respond to all our requests. We really are grateful!"
"Good spread, good quality",Good dining experience. Spread was better than before (compared to covid period). Only complaints would be that the durian cake dessert was not available and there‚Äôs a lack of variety for beverages
Good service,"Staffs are nice and friendly, especially the one served us (Nikki). Food tastes good, seafoods are fresh. Dessert is good as well! Love their mango ice cream!"
engineer,"Nice food
Nice service
Nice wine
Nice place to visit
recommended to all family member
definitely will come back again"
Unbelievable choices,"Had dinner with a group of friends. i liked the choices presented however1/2 hour close to closing time, food was not being replenished. as they lost our reservation of 10 we had to wait to be seated so was a bit hurried in getting our food before the kitchen closed.
cannot fault the quality but disappointed that they lost our reservation which was done via reception."
Great festive spread. Attentive service from waiter & waitress.,"Skip the sushi counter and desserts. Otherwise, a great festive buffet spread. If the dessert counter chef refused to make waffles before closing time, speak with the restaurant manager."
Mr Frank,Very good service from Nikki very accommodating the food was always fresh and a big variety from different continents
Excellent food and service,Food and dining experience was excellent. Shirleyn and Manoj were awesome is assisting us at our table. It was a pleseant suprise when they gave us a log cake for our wedding annivesery. Will definatly visit again
Birthday celebration at The Line,"We visited here as a family of 8 pax including 3 kids, and was served by Rachel & Ruby. They were very patient and we cannot praise them enough of their attentiveness towards our needs. They were very friendly, and we thoroughly enjoyed our evening. It was a memorable dinner, Thank you!"
NO HOT FOOD AT JAPANESE SECTION,It was a little disappointing that there was no hot food at the Japanese section eg. soba and tempura. Also I didn't see much vegetable dishes and chicken wings.
Amazing breakfast and service.,"They had an awesome breakfast spread from all around the world, to be accompanied by phenomenal service. Shirley was very attentive and helpful. Highly recommend!"
Best Sunday Brunch,"The Line Sunday Brunch offers an amazing variety of food items, the selection is huge. I dont know where to start but the food options are outstanding and eveything is very authentically prepared in its highest quality. Especially the seafood corner, japanese corner and Indian food options impressed me a lot. It is a great value for money deal for all the options you get."
My sunday brunch experience at the LINE restaurant at SHANGRILA.,"Let me tell you one thing, this has been the best Sunday Brunch so far that i have tried in my life. The food choices and varieties are just mind blowing, very attentive and friendly service staff even though the place is super packed but they really try their best to take care of your table. I will definitely come here again.

Dont worry about the price , it's worth it trust me."
Good customer service and good food,Was having buffet lunch at The Line and was very pleased with Brianna. She had very good attitude. I made few requests and she willing assisted with smile. A great staff.
The best experience with family,"I visited the line with family, and it was the best experience! Their service was amazing, all the staffs took care our table. Especially thanks to chef Jimmy, Michael and Wang who helped us to explain every food whenever we asked, Service Rinny, Rhea, Ruby, Rosy, and Olivia who smiled all the time and helped us while we dined in. Thanks again!"
Visit to Shangri-la line buffet,Great experience at Shangri-la line buffet. Served by Shirley and Mugi. Professional and friendly. Thanks!!
Wonderful food and service,Rachel was an excellent server who took care of our request. Excellect and personalized service. Food is fantastic
Good food good environment Good service,"First time visit The Line for anniversary, food variety is good, environment is good. Was served by Shirley, Mugi, and Rachel, thanks for the hospitality. Definitely will come back again"
Good food and service,Enjoyed the food at The Line last night. The rojak was especially nice with some cuttlefish. On the whole food tasted better than when i was there in July. Service by Rachel and Ameen was especially good! They were very helpful and cheerful‚Äô
Celebration make even pleasant,We have a great evening of family celebration top up with very fine service by Rhea who serve with great smile thought under a mask camouflage. The pleasant experience has won us over for the next visit soon.
Not value for money.,"Poor Food taste and variety not up to recommendation standard and overprice. I‚Äôve not visited the line for past 2 years till lately on our staycation. Actually, I‚Äôm looking forward for the line buffet for long time but to my disappointment that the standards has drop. Food taste and food spread no good. They put nuggets, spaghetti and mash potatoes as into one of the main dish. Chinese counter put steam chicken bao and 2 more type of Bao. The seafood is not fresh. I cannot believe such cheap food they are charging high buffet price."
"Shangri-La ""The Line"" experience",There are good variety of food options and service are very courteous. Shirley in particular attended to our requests - always with a smile.
1st lunch buffet with my wife,"It was a great experience here, all the food was amazing especially the seafood on ice. All the staff is very friendly and generous especially Ms. Shirley."
Value For Money Buffet,The waitresses at this place is very attentative. They changed us a table that was nearer to the buffet knowing my wife is not so mobile. The service staff that attended were Rhea and Ameen. For the price paid to this buffet is defintely value for money compared to Park Royal Hotel where we were recently . In terms of the size of spread and quality the Line defintely beat it hands down with more to offer. The downside is that reservations have to been made at least 1 week due to its popularity.
Great Family time!,We had a amazing time at the Line! Service stuff were super friendly and helpful! Special mention to Shirley for going out of the way to make things work for us!
Breakfast at The Line,Excellent Service with Shirley taking great care and attention to our needs. The kids love her smiles! Food wise - lots of choice and selection. Tasty and fueled up a good stomach for a fun family day in the hotel. Recommend for family with kids!
"Good food, great service","Good variety of quality food. Shout out to Shirley who attended to us and made our dining experience feel like home.

Also shout out to Jonathan, Director of Accounts, for taking the time to attend to our queries and entertained us with conversation despite it being his lunch time."
Comfortable ambience & good service,"Was there to reminisce some good old times as it had been some time we‚Äôve been to The Line. Service was still real good. As we were there to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday, Shang surprised us with a birthday cake on the house. What a nice gesture!

As for the spread, though still much variety avail, somehow the taste or standard of the food has dropped a bit. Also missing the fresh oysters that used to be available."
Dinner Birthday Celebration with Family,"During our dinner we where served and attended by Ruby who was very polite and soft spoken. She was very attentive to our request for a birthday cake and even go the extra mile to offer us some wine.
There was plenty of food to choose from western to asian cuisine.
One of our favourites was the sushi and seafoods.
If you are sweet lover there are also a variety of dessert to choose from."
Lacklustre experience,Variety of food was limited and food presentation was not enticing. Seafood selection was unfortunately rather disappointing. Wouldn‚Äôt spend such money for the service nor food in future.
Service standards,"Got the pleasure of being served by Shirley today and she was very patient, attentive and took the time to do small talk despite the busy atmosphere at lunch. She took the time to serve off-menu items that was really a difference maker.

This is a totally different experience than what we had the day before. We just checked in and the Filipina who greeted us at the entrance was cold, told us off the bat that if they let us in we have to leave by 5pm. The Chinese lady got our orders wrong and when we refused the wrong order, she came back a few minutes later to emphasize on giving us the wrong pasta for ‚Äúfree‚Äù. It didnt matter we didnt want it! if we wanted it we would have ordered it! Suffice it to say, she offered a cold apology and didnt even mind to ask how they could do a service recovery. We are also in the service industry so we took it as she was just having a bad day. Not a good look for Shangri La Hotel as a whole.

But, BIG Kudos to Shirley!!"
"Nice food, great experience",Came to the restaurant to celebrate our anniversary. The food and variety is good and we want to give a special shout out to their staff Rhea. She surprises us with an anniversary cake and the restaurant also make a special palek paneer for my husband even though its not on their menu.
A massive selection of great food‚Ä¶,"‚Ä¶welcomed us at The Line each morning of our stay, providing us with endless different combinations to choose! Aesthetically the restaurant is utterly at odds with the rest of the hotel but that doesn‚Äôt really matter when the food is this good. Friendly staff and plenty of space as well."
The Line Breakfast,Our go to hotel and our go to breakfast. Gotta say...Jaya at the egg station runs it's like a military operation. Another wonderful stay.
Anniversary lunch buffet,"Good mix of variety, food was delicious too. Shirley was helpful and thoughtful. Presented us with a anniversary cake towards the end of of meal. Thank you."
AWESOME SERVICE,"The breakfast was buffet type, but every morning we get to eat breakfast, Ms Shirley was always there and very accommodating and always answers our inquiry with an everlasting smile on her face. What a great way to start our day. Thank you Ms Shirley for an awesome service."
Had a good seafood night,"First timer had a dinner on The Line Restaurant with families. Thursday is seafood night, there‚Äôs nanya food section, noodles, indian, asian, japanese etc.
The seafood is legit & fresh! We had a great night, we celebrate the wedding dinner there and got cake & wine as complimentary.
The service also very good, Thanks Ruby for the hospitality."
Fantastic seafood buffet,"You can‚Äôt beat the service, Rachel is so helpful and attentive and always assured our table was well catered for. The food is amazing, a large variety of fresh seafood. There is something for everyone even if you don‚Äôt like seafood. Sushi, Indian, western, Asian and a beautiful dessert bar. The noodle man is my favourite though."
Thanks chef prepare a good food.,"The food is nice and fresh,service staff is friendly, i would like to thank chef jimmy wong,wei quan ,ching wang and Ara. They got prepare few dish for my family and taste good."
"Waiter & Waitress by the name of Mugi, Ruby and Ling Ling @ The Line","Appreciate their excellent customer service and they are very friendly, helpful and actively serving customers."

Dinner at The Line,"Had a great time here and was served by Brianna who was warm and welcoming to us, would definitely visit again! :)"
Great dinner at the Line,"Always a great time at the Line. Fresh seafood, great service, wide selection Happy to get a birthday cake too! Great service crew too. (Rachel)"
Seafood Buffet,"Seafood spread was of high quality especially the Fresh Oysters. Waffle Texture and Taste can be improved. Chocolate Ice Cream Texture can be improved. Thank you Ameen, for your great customer service."
First time dinning in The Line,"Our first time dinning in The Line, and it was my birthday. The staff always quick in clearing the used plates and was always smelly and friendly. They even presented a free birthday cake to me.
Food was good but the seafood can have more to serve as its always fast to be taken away by diners before us."
Birthday celebration,The variety of food was worth the price paid. There was good ambience and the service provided by Rhea was excellent. There was complimentary parking but it does not cover per entry and would be better if it was complimentary to per entry.
One of the best hotel breakfast buffets in Singapore,"The food and and customer service is always excellent. My favorites are the nuts, jams & lox, croissants, fresh fruits, roti prata and the egg station.

The staff are always courteous and efficient and somehow manage to keep this popular breakfast buffet running smoothly and maintain a high standard.

At the egg station, despite it being one of the more popular areas of the buffet with many people lining up, the chef Jaya and his team always delivers service with a warm smile while working very quickly."
"Wonderful dinner buffet, great service","The Indian Cuisine was so delicious... Great variety and very authentic. Especially enjoyed chef Sanjoy's tandori king prawn and butter chicken. They were so tasty, and I am thankful for the great experience. Also appreciate Chef Michael's beautiful cheese platter.
Also thanking Ruby for providing great service, she was very fast and bright. Ameen & Rachel served me nicely with a big smile too."
Birthday celebration,Yummy food with a great spread of all you can eat buffet. Service was awesome too. We were served by Rachel and Kuberen who provided great service to us. Super attentive and polite in attending to us.
The Line - Breakfast Buffet,"As a patron of The Line's breakfast buffet, today's service was always as every other time I visited this establishment.

The food was consistently hot, fresh and delicious. The fruits were freshly cut and of good quality. The drinks were plentiful and never out of stock.

The waitresses (Nicki and Tasha) who took care of me today were very warm and attentive to my needs.

Chef Fauzan and Jaya did a fantastic job for me today as well.

Chef Fauzan was very accommodating to my off-menu requests and went the extra mile to give me a dish that tastes damn good.

Chef Jaya at the eggs station at did a very good job at making my scrambled eggs, the eggs were still runny and fluffy; exactly how I like it."
good service,it‚Äôs my birthday today free Birthday cake from Shangri-La thank you awesome! extremely good service and my Table is Table 206 served by a female staff called Daisy. üòá overall food is good! dessert is extremely nice.
Lunch buffet,Tasha Good service and very helpful is our company lunch here and is our first time here at the line

Company's conference,We had lunch at the hotel and Tasha so friendly helpful. Giving me a surprise my birthday's cake and busy helping us taking photos. Thank-you üôè
Employee attitude are very important,"I‚Äôve been coming to the Line for many years, my grandma used to live in the Shangri-La service apartment for almost a decade until she passed away. Every other day we ate at the Line, trough the years we started to make friends with the employees. Some of the staff that leaves very good impression are the egg station. Jaya and Fengmoi (the small Chinese girl). They are very cheerful and friendly to customers and try do their best in what they do. It‚Äôs a great way to start your day when you interact with good attitude people. I hope Shangri-La company appreciates these employees and take a good care of them. As for the food are great and many variations, it‚Äôll make you full for at least half a day."
Great service and food at The Line,"The Line is one of the best buffet places. Food is good and the service by the wait staff was really good. Especially, Ling Ling, who was attentive and friendly when we interacted with her."
Fabtastic birthday celeb ü•≥üôèüèªüôÇ,"Had a fabulous birthday dinner buffet at THE LINE and was well taken care of by Ms Dolores. Her warm and accomodating personality made sure we are having the best celebration that night . Wide variety of cuisines and scrumptuous desserts were present. I personally enjoyed the fresh array of seafood,sushi bar and the Indian section.
If you are heading here for a celebration or a simple dinner,do look for Ms Dolores and rest assured you are well taken care of :) Thank you so much for your hospitality."
Dinner at The Line,"Enjoyed a scrumptious dinner buffet at The Line which left us amazed and fully satisfied with the wide variety of dishes. As delicious as the food was, the accommodating, excellent, and ever refined service by Ruby, Akshey, and Ameen meant that our evening was much better.

Ruby, in particular, was very attentive to our needs and made sure to delight and interact with us whenever possible, although it seemed busy at the time. All in all, it was definitely worth a visit, and I highly recommend others to give the buffet a try."
Highly recommended service,"Catered to our needs whenever possible. 2 staffs in particular, ruby and akshey made us feel welcomed"
Excellent,Finally we can all let ourselves out at the buffet lines again. Excellent food quality and wide variety. Well done team Shangri-La at the line. Everyone here was clearly impressed and left with a little tummy protruding out. Special mention to our sweet grandmother lady server Mdm chew who is so attentive and always smiling and coming by to clear our plates so promptly. She has absolutely elevated my line buffet experience. What a joy to have such a great service staff.
Great to catch up with Mr Teck (chef) and Ms Chew,Lovely to catch up with both Mr Teck and Ms Chew. Both have excellent memory even though I am not patronising The Line regularly. Happy to see them working at Shang after the covid phrase. :)
Diner de fleurs,"Booked an intimate dinner for our honeymoon at Diner de Fleurs and had an amazing time. Chef Wong went out of his way to prepare a menu with our dietary requirements and both him and Ruby made us feel very comfortable and were friendly and accomodating. We had a lovely experience, would recommend to anyone!"
Food is served cold ü•∂. Service is lousy. Price is expensive üòî,Food is served cold ü•∂ service is terrible ü§¨ staff is slow in clearly our plates since is a buffet setting.
Wonderful experience,"Ameen was meticulous and assisted with our birthday celebration seamlessly! Was a wonderful dining experience, will be back!"
"Still good after all these years, but getting expensive, no fresh oysters on sat night","The Line buffet has been around for many years, and consistently, there is a good range to select from - Japanese, Seafood, Western, Asian, Indian, Peranakan. Love the beef cheek satay! However, this time, it is no longer 5 stars for me as it is now at a pricey $98+ for a Sat night buffet. And for that price, there are no fresh oysters and we felt the japanese sashimi was not that great anymore. The restaurant... is full-house kind of crowded, and tables are packed closed together and it gets a bit too noisy for my liking. I also find the orange decor of The Line rather jarring as well, a sad departure from the overall sophisticated design of the hotel decor. The service staff try their best, but it is at best functional service and little details that used to make The Line so memorable goes out the window. E.g. while I appreciate the hot drink station, it also means you are expected to make your own hot drinks, and it took close to 10 minutes for the bill to arrive after 2 promptings."
Great service,Great service from staff. Fauzan was exceptional. The tandoori fish curry he cooked was just so yummy. He also made a crispy dosa for my elderly mum and she enjoyed it very much. Thank you so so much . It is pleasure to come for breakfast at the Shangri la
"Food Quality Needs to be Improved, Service was Good","I brought my parents for the lunch buffet at the Line. The whole experience was really underwhelming. Laksa certainly disappoints! There were no other ingredients in the bowl of Laksa except for bean sprouts and fishcakes. The noodles were clumped together as well. The chef did not make it a point to ask if my dad wanted other ingredients like eggs or prawns. Overall the food tasted so so even though there was a wide selection. The roast beef could be better as it was way too rare for my parents‚Äô liking even though I asked for the doneness to be medium. Roast pork and Pipa Duck were salty and quite tough. The sashimi were sliced too thinly and presentation was pretty messy. Didn‚Äôt make me want to go for seconds. Thankfully the desserts saved the day. All of us love the durian coconut cake. Your staff, Mdm Chew was so attentive to our needs. She was always prompt to clear the plates once we were done and so very helpful with our drinks. Thanks to her impeccable service, she made our lunch experience a whole lot better that day. I doubt I would ever make a return visit."
The line restaurant,Had a pleasant experience at the line buffet. Our service staff Rhea was polite and accommodative to our needs and request. The food was excellent and we get to see and taste a wide spread of food choices. Will come back for a second time.
The Line Buffet Lunch - Thursday,"The hotel entrance was grand and nice, and my partner brought me here to celebrate my birthday. I have to say that the spread and range was fantastic, seating was spacious and cosy, and brightly lit for eating comfortably. We had an amazing time, and i have to say the service by all staff, in particular Aunt Ling Ling, was fantastic. The buffet plates were cleared regularly giving space to the table for more food, there was a nice birthday cake as a surprise, and Ling Ling promptly asked if we needed a parking coupon for our visit. Truly an enjoyable experience and we will definitely be back! Great staff service 10/10, great food! 8.5/10!"
"Nice ambiance,nice staff and food except no halal food",I recommand the breakfast buffet. Nice quality food . The only negative point for me is no halal food.Thank you to jaya raj at the egg station for is job and smile. Very professional
