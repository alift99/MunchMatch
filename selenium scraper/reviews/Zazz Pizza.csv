Cozy dinner venue with friends,"This is by far the best Italian restaurant that I've ever been to here in singapore. I love the ambiance and the jovial personality of MJ, the best staff I've ever mer. She deserves a raise and/or a promotion."
Best Italian Restaurant Ever!,"By far, the best Italian restaurant that I‚Äôve ever been in Singapore. To top that, one of the staff, MJ, was very accommodating. Will definitely recommend the place to everyone!"
Delicious pizza,We had a perfect Italian dinner. The pizza is tasteful with a spending botten. A place where we come again for sure. We where served trough a trainee who was very polite and handy. Thank you.
Excellent wood fired pizza.,Especially love the Parma burrata pizza. Even the crust is delicious. Boss is passionate about his pizza. Ingredients are really top quality.
Amazing Pizza,The pizza was so good (we are italians üáÆüáπ) and the service was excellent! I will definitely come back!
Authentic Italian,"Fabulous pizza. We actually ate here twice during our stay. Quality Italian ingredients and great service, thank you!!"
Highly reccommend,"Food is very good with amazing service. Food was served fast too when we visit on Sunday evening. We had salad with sass dressing, aglio olio and Parma burrata pizza"
Best Italian food in Singapore,"If you're looking for great tasting, authentic Italian pizza and pasta, this is the place. I consider myself very picky when it comes to my Italian food (pasta must be al dente, pizza dough must be chewy and crust crunchy, etc), and this place delivers. Fernando is an experienced chef and it shows. Best of all, this is value for money. Prices may seem steep on the menu but when you eat it you will understand what I mean. There's a lot more ingredients for what you are paying. You will not be disappointed!"
Good pizza and risotto,Very good pizza and risotto. Had the meat lovers pizza and mushroom risotto. Right at the entrance of the mall at South Bridge Rd and Upper Cross St.
Best pizzas in Singapore,"It‚Äôs been a while since we returned. We used to frequent Zazz when they were at short street because it was in our neighbourhood. This is our first visit to the cross street place.

Still our fav pizzas. we ordered diavola, burrata pizza and lasagna, they were delicious, will definitely come back to support more frequently."
yummyyyy,not the first time here. staff are super friendly! wood fire pizza and pasta is delicious and consistent portions are big :) highly recommended.
"Fresh Pizza, great staff","Very friendly and helpful staff with a very accommodating owner. All ingredients were fresh and the food felt homemade, being served at a considerable pace. Would definitely recommend!"
Authentic üëåüèª,Best pizza and pasta place in town. I feel like im in Italy again and having a vacation. The ambience was good and the service was excellent. Will recommend this to other friends who's looking for an Authentic Italian dish! Good job to the entire team
Nice place for pizza,Chance upon this place for pizza. The spicy pizza was great. Will go again and order other pizza to try.
Pizza,They make pizzas like italians. Excellent spicy food. I had Sicilian with extra meatballs. Good service and crew
Pizza with delicious mozzarella,The food was delicious especially the fried calamari and the pizza with real mozzarella di buffala. Would definitely go back!
Amazing food and excellent service,"The food here is amazing, paired with great ambience and excellent service from MJ and Fernando, it is the perfect choice for anyone looking to having an enjoyable meal. Their pizza and pasta is truly exceptional. Came here for a birthday meal and the service and food they provided is nothing short of amazing. Shoutout to MJ and Fernando again for the warm hospitality and amazing food."
Best pizza,"My husband and I are always on the lookout for good pizza and we have to look no further with Zazz pizza. Delicious flavours, good thin crispy crust, wonderful service and it was lovely getting to know the owner. 10/10 recommend!!"
Excellent and satisfying dinner! One of the best dining experience in Singapore,"Excellent fire wood pizza! The best I had in Singapore. They‚Äôre also very generous with the portion of ingredients on pizza. Mushroom risotto was also fantastic.
They‚Äôre also giving free glass of wine or peroni beer from mondays to wednesdays. Will definitely be back with different groups of family and friends."
Satisfying and food rich in flavour! Best fire wood pizza in Singapore!,"Heard a lot about this pizza.. and it really lives up to the expectations! :) the food was Amazing! They were very generous with the serving and ingredients on the pizza.. mushroom risotto was heavenly! Generous portion of mushrooms as well!
Most importantly, good ambience and excellent customer service! Free drinks to go with the pizza on weekdays.. highly recommended!"
"Authentic, Delicious, No-nonsense Pizza",An underrated gem. Pasta and pizza is great. Highly recommend the beef cheek pasta. A really good deal if you come on Mon-Wed since you get a drink on the house with every main course!
Average casual Italian cafe or trattoria that's not really value for money,"Considering the menu prices are not that low, we expected much better food. None of the dishes made it to our table piping hot which was a disappointed and they were of middling quality at best. While the cafe is styled as self-service, it was surprising that the 3-4 service staff did not attempt to be more helpful in refilling our glasses with water when they were clearly not busy and there were no other diners in the cafe. What was most troubling was when the only other diner in the cafe started coughing and blowing his nose, none of the cafe staff approached him to persuade him to move to an alfresco table. Fortunately, we had pretty much finished eating and was contemplating whether to have dessert and coffee. To be covid safe, we decided to head elsewhere for coffee."
Decent pizza in SG,"Hi guys,

I ordered a pizza there last Saturday (take away).

The staff was rather fast and, from what I observed, willing to help. I can't comment on the service since I didn't have dinner there. I didn't have to wait long.

The pizza taste was good but not amazing. I see excellent reviews here. I bit over-rated I feel. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying it's bad. Thin crust (positive), was bit too cooked (like when it starts to burn a bit), tasted like a typical ""average"" pizza (so the taste you expect from a pizza). But you don't get much on it. A pizza should be generous if you get what I mean. It was too small, especially for a Napoli at SGD 29 (Napoli has no fancy add-on). Napoli wasn't even on the menu (although it's a classic) so I had to ""create your own"".
For that price, the restaurant should ensure you don't starve...a happy belly wins clients' loyalty.

All in all good if you want a quick pizza when you are around. Don't expect the best one in town.

Best,
D."
AMAZING PIZZA PERIOD!,"AMAZING PIZZA PERIOD! The fennel sausage is to die for! My suggestion after delivery arrival, heat up a pan with olive oil and make crust crispy=excellent! The only sad part .....I wish they were bigger!!! LOL My kids love it too;) I can‚Äôt stop thinking about that fennel sausage though, next time I am making a custom....fennel sausage and peppers:)

Bday celebrations,"Been there 2x and the pizzas were fabulous. The burrata pizza was the best. The zazz pizza second. Both times we ordered them. For the pasta, the mac n cheese was a disappointment. It was very bland. Need more cheese please. We also tried the sorbet. Love the yuzu lychee and dark chocolate sorbet. Yummy."
Still fabulous,"On holiday from work and thought about how to fill my days. Zazz for lunch came top priority. Its an hour away from my home by public transport but it is so worth it. From the really friendly and welcoming two waitresses to the cheery wave from the chef, as soon as you walk in you feel a warm embrace! I knew I had made the right choice. The pizzas here are fabulous. I cannot get past the diavola. Crunchy crispy outer rim, chewy stringy mozzarella and a really beautiful tasting salami. Add the rosemary and garlic infused olive oil on all the tables (chilli oil and garlic flakes also on the table) and its just delicious. I have reviewed zazz before but something this good and service so warm deserves to be cherished. Fabulous. So God I am going back today. A two hour round trip is worth it."
The pizzas are delicious perfectly executed with not too much of base sauce and toppings,"The pizzas are delicious perfectly cooked in a traditional pizza brick oven the ambience you can choose between indoors and outdoors
Service from Manju and interaction with Chef Fernando is an absolute delight
P.S. Ask for a tasting of ice cream and you‚Äôd be delighted with it"
Singapore‚Äôs best Pizzeria,Zazz is clearly the best pizzeria in Singapore. Reasonably priced as well. Chef Fernando is not only a great Chef but an even better human being and very humble. The staff is always professional. Will visit again soon.
Best Pizza in Singapore,"Unassuming restaurant, but one that serves the best pizza in Singapore. Really recommend a visit. Impressively, they can also do gluten free pizza (with 24 hours notice), and better still, the gluten free pizza tastes really good . . . ."
One of the best pizzas in Singapore,"I came here for dinner & had the Bismarck pizza, Zazz salad, saffron seafood fettuccine & burrata with ham platter. The food came pretty quickly too. And Wow, the pizza was really good, and it was my fav dish among the nice dishes we ordered. The crust is crispy yet soft & flavourful & the flavour of pizza (it‚Äôs got truffle, ham, runny egg - yummy) was really good. We were given a spicy olive oil & it goes really well with the pizza too. The pasta was really good too. Highly recommended; will return more more"
Best pizza in Singapore,"Been living in Singapore for 12 years and i believe i have finally found the best pizza in town! From the smokey chewy base, the gorgeous tomatoe sauce (is that basil in it) to the gorgeous salami! WOW. I ordered delivery online and my wife and i were just blown away by the taste. Dont bother with any of the imposters - bella pizza, pepperoni, alt, extra virgin, blue label, limoncello etc etc. This is the deal!"
Mouthwatering food,"Tucked away from the buzz of daily life, the food was such a good soul food. The staff were so friendly that the our date night was made even more cozy and memorable."
Zazz pizza party,Food was really nice!! ü§©ü§© 12/10‚ù§Ô∏è Tried the Bismark pizza üçïand it‚Äôs crust was very thin and delicious!üòä
definitely one of the best,definitely one of the best pizza in singapore. the kids love the pepperoni pizza and we love the burrata pizza. service is warm and friendly. reasonable priced alcohol!
Soggy and oily pizza,"Ordered the meat lover and Quattro through grab delivery, delivery was fast but pizza was soggy and oily. Taste terrible."
Favourite Pizza Place in Singapore,The pizza here is by far the best I had in Singapore so far. The parma burrata is a must try! I would also recommend the fettuccine prawn & scallop in saffron sauce.
One of the best pizzas in,"One of the best pizzas in town, unpretentious & yet surpasses many top Italian places. You must try their Parma ham Burrata pizza."
Pizzazz!,"If you are looking for small eatery with good pizza and pasta, you must try Zazz Pizza.

Although I‚Äôve worked in the arts schools neighbourhood for a bit, I wouldn‚Äôt have known or patronized Zazz Pizza if not for a colleague‚Äôs invitation.

First, the shop‚Äôs off main Selegie Road, on rarely used Short Street and further obscured by a large awning in the day. Even if I‚Äôve seen the sign and name - not an English word although plenty of definitions in the urban dictionary ‚Äì I would not have been attracted to shop and missed their delicious food and warm service amidst a simple ambience only spruced up by a wooden fired oven.

Yes, they serve a variety of red or white pizzas which are fired with oak wood imported from the United States. The posters promote their burrata pizzas and owner Chef Harin proudly suggests that their burrata‚Äôs are imported from Italy; and I agree its very nice. It is interesting to watch Chef Harin navigate the pizzas with experience in the wood fire; for us to enjoy the extra flavour. I wonder if there‚Äôs an Italian equivalent of wok hei? Or the al dente of pizzas?

Chef Harin hails from Sri Lanka and has been in the f&b business beginning in Colombo then Dubai before being brought to Singapore by a top Italian Restaurant, and then starting his own restaurant business with Zazz. One of my dining friends like me, naturally surmised if Chef may have spent some time in Italy to offer this fine Italian eatery in Selegie!

They also serve a good variety of pastas ‚Äì red, white, clear and even black - and starters like calamari and interesting crab cake and risotto balls. My colleagues tended to the spicy angel hair with prawns. I like both their aglio olio and squid ink. They have a salad of 10 different ingredients which I‚Äôve been meaning to try. What impressed me with Zazz during my maiden visit was when Chef Harin would go around to offer his home-made olive oil infused with chillies and peppers to garnish our food with ‚Ä¶ Zazz (there goes my spell check again)?

In the evenings, the alfresco dining is well patronized as I reckon the pizzas go well with beers. They have a small but interesting selection of Italian wines. I also saw the delivery people come in and out suggesting a popular takeaway business.

Although they are rather busy in the evenings, Chef Harin and his couple of staff remain efficient, cheerful and personable with their service.

The prices for pastas and pizzas range from the teens to twentysomething; therefore, not inexpensive but reasonable for the quality and taste.

Is there something I‚Äôd provide feedback on? Perhaps the name Pizzazz was taken?"
Appetizing Food & Exceptional Service!!,"This pizzeria provides good quality pizza & its really tasty! I'll be back again with my friends to have a try on the pasta! The service staff is exceptionally great & attentive to my needs, given there's no service charge & GST which is a bonus for that!!!! Thank you Mj for making us feel welcomed :)"
Fantastic Pizza,"Reading the reviews, I had to come and try it for myself and it did not disappoint! Really well made pizza. We had the white base mixed mushroom and the red base burrata pizza. I personally preferred the red base one. Crust and base were chewy. Sauce on point. Cheese excellent. What more could you want from a pizza. Two thumbs up."
They have great pizzas here,"They have great pizzas here, the best I have had outside of Italy. The chicken wings were good too but not as surprising as some reviews say, they were still as good. The homemade lemon iced tea was great too."
Pretty Tasty,"This place is fairy hidden, on a carpark under a HDB and across the road from a Church. We had the Parma and a Salami pizza. Both were good and were brought to the table very quickly. Not the destination for a romantic dinner, but good for a quick feed."
I love ZAZZ Pizza!,Amazing food and great atmosphere!! Service 10/10!! Owner's oldest daughter very cute :-) I tried the squid ink pasta and diavola pizza @ $22 each. Both were delicious! Highly recommend squid ink pasta! Best squid ink pasta I've ever tasted!
GOOD PIZZA,"This is a pizza joint, and they do pizza well. The place is quite small, but the manage to bake delicious pizzas in their wood burning oven. Most of seating is outdoor, which is OK if its not too hot outside. Prices are reasonable."
Mama Mia! I will come again..,"Came here to find a substitute for 4P's Burrata with Parma ham pizza (this is in Vietnam). Turned out we struck gold here. We ordered Parma Burrata@$36 and Hawaii@$20 (for kid, as usual). Both adults and kid are happy. Pineapple was caramelized so it was much sweeter than usual. The sweetness is kind of blend in and balance out the acidity of the tomato base, combining with the ham topping, it was simply delicious. Then there's the Parma Burrata... I kind of love the version here more than 4P thanks to the more bread-like base. The more you chew the wood-smoked base, the more intense the flavor is. Though the Burrata - star of the show in my book- seems smaller :P. Overall, happy, if not for the higher price, I would come here every other week to eat Parma Burrata. Will try our the Calzone next time, saw the next table order and it looked so interesting."
Hidden jewel,"Very local place with the best pizza in town!! The staff was super friendly, the prices are good and the tastes were amazing!!"
Delicious pizza,Delicious pizza and friendly service. Many vegetarian options and fantastic value. Beer only $6 per bottle.
Great Pizza,Small pizzeria worth visiting. Had a lovely BYO pizza and some cold beer. Tried the crab cakes but too much chilli in them. Pasta also looked good around us. Staff were great
Good.,This pizzeria is a very good option for a quick bite.Friendly service and very good pizza and beef lasagne.If you are around you can go to it.
"Great Pizzas, Friendly Staff","We really enjoyed the wood-fired pizzas. The arrabiata pasta was excellent too. So was the bruschetta.

The restaurant isn‚Äôt the most fancy, something one expects out of an Italian restaurant in Singapore. But we really liked that it wasn‚Äôt. Very laid back. Although they don‚Äôt include service charges, the food is pretty pricey on its own. Not sure if it‚Äôs the cost of ingredients? Or that people are accustomed to paying a lot for Italian food in Singapore. I would recommend the place a 100% but felt a little ripped off with the pricing."
AMAZING!!,"This was one of the best food experiences of my life. I love the pizza from Princi in London, and this one is as good. The pizza has the perfect ratio of dough, tomatosauce and cheese. We also ordered the truffle fries, and they were magical as was the garlic bread. Super nice staff. They had a chili oliveoil that gave the perfect kick to the food :)"
Great little wood fired pizza,Great little wood fired pizza place. Very friendly staff and good food. Ate here a few times and would do it again. Outdoor seating perfect for kids. The also have ice cream! Menu online I think.
Good pizza,"This place has good pizza, not too expensive, friendly staff and quick service. Laid back atmosphere."
"Food is excellent, friendly","Food is excellent, friendly staff, love the ice cream too! Pizzas are freshly made to order using fresh produce. I‚Äôll be back for more and to try the pasta next time."
Great food,"Excellent pizza and pasta and even a non-alcoholic beer.
Kind of strange to sit close so to a parking-place but if the food is good and service is good you will not notice after a while."
Love the PIZZZZZA!,"My husband and I had a thoroughly enjoyable lunch at Zazz. It was 2pm on a Sunday, and the tables inside were all taken so we sat outside. Was worried that it would be too hot but it was actually rather pleasant and we didn‚Äôt get sweaty. We build our own pizzas using the Margarita as a base. Simply outstanding! Pics show my pizza with extra topping of really tasty pesto."
better to eat in,"is actually pretty good pizza, the only thing that prevented me from a 5 star rating is that we order delivery and by the time we got the food was a bit cold, but very good taste and ingredients"
What a surprise.,"We noticed this restaurant earlier in the day and decided to check it out for dinner as we fancied something 'simple' and different to what we had tried in Singapore up to that point. The food was exactly as described or shown in the menu which is not always the case. Especially enjoyed the salad and the wine was a pleasant change from what we had experienced in the city so far. Pizza from a proper wood fired oven was delicious too.

Service is such an important part of any dining experience and the staff in Zazz really do a great job without being over the top.

Funny thing to go half way round the world and have pizza but we really enjoyed it. Thanks."
Nice pizza,It a nice clean place the staff is friendly and helpful. They got a lot of choices of pizza that we can chose
Tom L.,"Great pizza, super friendly staff, very casual ambiance but it‚Äôs all about the food here-would definitely return! Had the Margherita pizza, simple fresh ingredients, dough was perfect texture. If in the mood for Italian style pizza try it-you‚Äôll be glad you did!"
Great pizzas & pastas!,Ordered the chicken wings which was crispy on the outside and super juicy on the outside; very well marinated and yummy. Also came with their homemade spicy arrabiata sauce with was a good complement! Had their Zazz pizza and it could be one of the best pizzas I‚Äôve had.. they cook their pizzas in a wood fired oven. Service was quick and staff very attentive and friendly. Great quality food and will definitely come back for more!
Amazing Pizza and Service,"We took the Burrata and Parma Pizza , it was delicious !!! Its the best place to eat a Pizza in Singapore !
Its a really good experience. We recommand this address.
The service is great , we have talked to MJ, very smiling and enthusiast.
We 'll come back for sure !
Camille & Alex"
Isn't no.1 Italian restt,"It was crowded last night. U order n pay inside but food is served. Had most exp pizza @36/- n signature salad @12/-. Told to wait maybe 25 mins but pizza came within 10 min, followed a short while later by salad. Pizza had generous topping of parma ham, rocket n large burrata, but this obvious quality was offset by slightly overburnt pizza base, blackened areas around edges__not leopard spots, despite which, there was also lack of heat. Plate wasn't hot either. Well u/stand this pizza has its base prepared 1st, then toppings aƒèded, but time gap was clearly too long, phps to handle crowd. Shortcuts were taken, pity. Salad was good. Alcoholic drinks pricing looked very reasonable, but we had home made iced lemon tea..just nice balance. Warning: Car parking expensive,cost 5/- tho we couldn't hv been there much longer than about 1 hr 15 mins."
Perfect food & service! Recommended!,"Came across this Pizzeria and dined in with a couple of my friends, we ordered the pasta and bruschetta 10/10 would recommend, especially the squid tagliolini, no doubt will order again!! Great ambience and service the waitresses are very friendly and welcoming esp munju who is very bubbly. Thank you for the great night!"
Small restaurant but serving,Small restaurant but serving very good pizza. Thank you for moving us to better table. We definitely will come back again!
Great food and service,"The food is really good:pizza, burrata plater...
Service ++:+: Thanks MJ for the warm welcome each time we come !"
"Great pizza, great service","Small place near Little India with a great margherita pizza!! If you want a pizza with good price in Singapore, that‚Äôs the place!"
Good find,"This is a small, unassuming casual restaurant between Short Street and Selegie Road - there are tables inside and a few outside. We arrived at our accommodation mid-evening and Zazz was just around the corner and was a great choice for a quick bite after a long day of travel. The service was welcoming and very friendly and we were seated straight away. Their menu is a nice selection of popular light meals executed really well. We chose one of their pizzas and it was one of the best pizzas I‚Äôve had in recent times. They do other meals such as pasta, burgers, salads and they all looked really good and well presented as we saw meals being delivered to other tables. The price represented excellent value for money and we would definitely eat there again if in that area of the city and highly recommend Zazz Pizza to others."
Yummy Italian,"First night in Singapore after a tough two weeks in Nepal and India and wanted a good safe meal! Found this great little eatery on TA and it did not disappoint.

We had a sharing platter of mozzarella, Parma ham rocket olives followed by Fettuccini Aglio Olio and Fettuccini with chicken and pesto cream. One of the best Italians I have had in a long time. Very happy with the food and the service."
Nice soft shell crab pasta in Singapore,"Searching best Italian food in Singapore and it led me to Zazz pizza via TripAdvisor. I had soft shell crab pasta that is incredible with unique sauce. Also had Burrata cheese Parma ham pizza is nice but Burrata cheese not strong enough. Overall it‚Äôs affordable and great food as well. Need to go to cashier to order and If you want to have water, you need to go to cashier bar again. But it‚Äôs ok cause no gst and service charge !!"
Authentic Pizza!,"Dined in a couple nights back, we ordered the highly recommended Burrata Pizza and for myself Meat-Lover it was phenomenal and very rich in flavour! Enjoyed my night here with great food, atmosphere and service. Plus the young waitress offered to book us a cab back to our hotel thank you!!"
Amazing Amazing Food,This is like a Boutique restaurant very hip vibes. The food here is amazing some unusual pizzas but the fusion seems to work I wish I could have tried all of them. The kids had the spaghetti meatballs which they loved my favorite was the Chili Crab Burger which I didn't know even existed it was just incredible. This place is a definite must try it is on the expensive side but well worth it.
Friendly and quite atmosphere.,"Friendly and quite atmosphere. Pizzas are just awesome, fine crust and delicious burrata... Family friendly"
Delicious,"Must try! The food is really wonderful. We loved it. I and my husband can‚Äôt eat Singapore food because it is too much oil. And we found Zazz pizza by Tripadvisor, my husband really loved it for the first time"
Great Place For Food,"Had Some Buretto Pizza and Iced Tea. They were great. Ambience, Location, Price everything makes it an awesome place to be."
For me personally the best pizza ever!,Close to the Orchard street perfect stop over after shopping. Pizza is big with crunchy side but thick filling. Really much of everything on top and chili oil/garlic oil provided additionally. Very recommend!
Friendly service,Came because of the reviews. Pizza is great like everyone else says. Try the strawberry sorbet it‚Äôs a winner. These guys are super friendly and it was a nice change to get real service! I‚Äôll be back for the pasta.
Amazing Pizza,"Believe the reviews! The Pizza here is excellent, with both more traditional and unusual combinations. If we hadn‚Äôt had such a packed trip we definitely would have returned for more! Service was great, good selection of beers and wine. Highly recommended"
Pizza for the gods,Happened to pass this place while in my taxi-and it was the best decision I‚Äôve made all day! The menu was super unique and the staff (Shout-out to MJ) were amazingly friendly and welcoming. If you are in town this is a must have! Worth the travel and good value
Veeeeeery good pizza!!!,Amazing pizza!! Burrata rules! I already came because of trip advisor and really deserves the rating!!!
Best pizza,"Amazing pizza, probably the best Ive ever had!Burrata, excellent texture, good sauce and an amazing mozzarela on top."
"Good pizzas, bad service","We were waiting 40 minutes for 2 pizzas. They started serving people that arrived after us. Also if you ask for a second drink the waiter says you need to go personally to the bar.
Pizzas really tasty."
Fantastic find!,"We decided to look up this place after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor. It's only a small restaurant but it all adds to the charm of the place. Seating is inside or out and at busy times, you may be asked to share a larger table with other diners. We ordred beers while we waited for our chilli crab pizza and a meat lover pizza. The pizzas were freshly made to order and delicious - thin bases and lots of topping. Staff were very friendly, service was efficient and prices very reasonable. Highly recommended."
great pizza,"loved the pizza, Napolitana was really good. indoor sitting with AC cleanliness this restaurant was really good, the service excellent. all was good recomended"
Delicious !,I ordered a Margherita pizza on Grab and it was one of the best takeaway pizzas I have ever had. Excellent value too - I will definitely be returning.
Good Italian food,"A small establishment, good food, salad was excellent, attentive service. Some outdoor seating and indoor A/C tables as well."
Must try!!,"Excellent pizza, probably closes to real Napolitan pizza you will find in Singapore! Really polite and friendly staff as well. üï∫üèªüëåüèª"
Excellent Pizza!,Excellent Pizza! Great ingredients and very pleasant staff! Exceeded my expectations and i would definately recomend the place to anyone who wishes real italian pizza.
Hidden gem,"As a local I thought this place had surprisingly reasonable prices for good quality food. Don‚Äôt let any poor quality images fool you, the pizzas were super flavourful and the pastas were rich and delicious!"
Great little pizza place,"Only stayed in Singapore for 4 nights and went here for dinner two night in a row. Both the pizzas and Zazz salad were excellent. I have visited Italy many times and I can say that the pizzas at Zazz were just as good as any we‚Äôve had in Italy! Staff were also lovely. Great value for money as well, especially in Singapore."
"Delicious pizza, simple setting","I really enjoyed the pizza and cold beer I had here. The service is very friendly and welcoming. You see the chef working in front of you and he certainly knows how to make a good pizza. Get here early as there is only seating for 16 inside, about the same outside but that wasn‚Äôt suitable as it was pouring heavily with rain."
Top notch ingredients,"A lot love goes into these pies! The burrata one was great, but the burrata is chilled, which makes an odd temperature contrast with the hot crust."
Great food!,"We had the Deluxe double party burger, and it was amazing. It's the perfect combination of ingredients to make up a truly delicious burger. One of the best I've had in Singapore!!"
Pizzaa,"Best pizza in the town, they have a very experienced chef. After a hard time finding good food , here was the surprise at zazz pizza üòã"
Great pizza,Beautiful wood fired pizza worthy of Italy. It‚Äôs a very simple place but worth it for the pizza. The service is excellent.
Nice pizza in got setting,Me and some friends went to celebrate a birthday and found this restaurant on tripadvisor. We didn't know what to expect but was happily suprised. The pizza was really high quality and Napolean styled which i prefer over the Roman style. The staff was very nice and helpful 5+. Worth noting is that the restaurant interior is very much like a ordinary pizzeria but if you sit outside like we did you get a nice urban setting.
Pizza in Singapore,"We ate the pizza and it was delicious, exactly as a perfect pizza should be. Thin, crispy and with fresh ingredients, for a good price. The local is not that cozy, but good enough for a pizza place. The staff was very friendly and helpful! Worth a visit!"
Great Place for Italian Food!!!,"So many things to compliment with this restaurant. Given that I have background with F&B, the following feedback I thought would be great to share:
1. Of course pretty close to our home. Perfect

2. I like the simplicity of the ambience of this restaurant, makes it more homey feeling and far away from other typical Italian fancy restaurants in SG. However, just thought that the outside small tables kind of unattractive as it looks really old, rusty and not steady. Perhaps other customers might find it not great place to eat. Always great to have pleasant furniture outside (first impression - just a thought)

3. I thought it‚Äôs smart strategy that once customers ready to order, just go to the cashier and order you want and pay at the same time. This to Ensure that first you know what you‚Äôve ordered coz you have the receipt, second you already paid for what you‚Äôre about to eat (less hassle for customers in case a lot of customers around where normally you have to get the waiter/waitress attention for your bill) and it‚Äôs also more practical for the staff as well (so they don‚Äôt have to worry, whether the customers have paid or not)

4. Serving Time - pretty fast, I think overall - we waited less than 10mins for our 3 dishes including salad.

5. Quality of Food - Delizioso. My partner is very particular with pizza quality even though he‚Äôs not Italian. And this Quattro Stagioni - confirmed approved for his taste great
As for Seafood Spaghetti - I love the portion, it‚Äôs just nice for me. Not so much, not less. Just nice. Great taste (you can really taste the freshness of the seafood in the pasta), generous with seafood and pasta al dente.

Zazz Salad - I would say very unusual for us. Great mix of greens, veggies, fruits and nuts with selection of your sauce (we asked for Balsamic Vinaigrette), we loved the taste and portion of the salad as well. Good for sharing.

6. Staff - very helpful, quick in serving and very friendly as well

7. Price - on TOP of 3 dishes we ordered, we had tea and white wine. We paid about SGD67. Which we thought, not bad for overall experience.

Definitely recommended to everyone to try this place if you‚Äôre craving or just love Italian food. And let me know if your experience‚Äôs the same as ours"
Dinner with the family,The best pizzas we ate in Asia by far. Nice and friendly people - fresh ingredients on an real Italian thin pizza. It definitely makes up for the place - near to a parking lot - go their you visit Singapore.
Not bad,The place is small and very casual. Staff is very friendly. Pizzas are good. Payment in advanced not justified (small place) - maybe just for tables outside (brakes all the mood of the meal). The price is fair for the offer. Safe choice mainly for the pizzas.
