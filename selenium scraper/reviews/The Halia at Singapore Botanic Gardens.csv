Delicious food,Foods and beverages are delicious. But need to be careful of the bird which will try to rob food....
Great Ambiance,Halia’s customer service is great! Thank you tho we changed our booking timing. Love the ambiance. Food was great!
Average food but ambience is good,"Food was so so but serving was quick. Table was dirty. The fan and ceilings lights placement makes it alittle giddy. The light shadow on the table flickers. Receptionist is friendly, patient and observant. Unable to locate toilet. No signs. But ambience is good. The greenery surroundings makes it a good location for dining."
Don’t bring guests to entertain here,"I had guests from Hong Kong visiting me and I thought long and hard where to bring them to a nice halal restaurant. My wife suggested Halia . I agreed because we have been here several times and we’re quite satisfied with the food and ambience I thought it would be a great place to bring my foreign guests.

I must say this , I refrain from writing negative reviews but I think I have to share my experience.

I will start with a commendation first , the staff was good . friendly ,and I can see they were trying their best. however the food is extremely disappointing.

Firstly I booked a 7pm slot for dinner and my guests wanted the tomahawk to share. it was sold out, then he wanted a ribeye - also not available. I was getting irritated I mean it’s the start of dinner service and you have ran out of things on your already sparse menu?? It’s embarrassing that my guests had to settle for other cuts or food which they didn’t really want. how can I possibly ever bring my foreign guests who just want to have an enjoyable time here for dinner ever again? I suppose Halia is an ok place for family and friends but if you need to do proper entertaining of guests please, I don’t recommend you bring them here. I was really embarrassed. The medium rare tenderloin was also not properly done and the meat was tough. I didn’t complain there and then , because I didn’t want to make a scene and ruin the evening for my guests. The rest of the food was also really sub par .it’s honestly mediocre quality food for a place which is supposed to be a nice place to dine. I’ve been here before but standards have really dropped. I’m quite upset at how the restaurant has embarrassed me with their menu items and poor food quality. Halia is just a glorified overpriced cafeteria with polite staff. I will never forget how Halia embarrassed me in front of my guests todaY"
"Fine-dining prices, cafe-standard food","Halia is set in the very beautiful Botanic Garden, which raised hopes for a good dinner. Unfortunately, it was not meant to be. The servers were distracted and service was not polished. The atmosphere was too racuous for the fine-dining prices Halia charged, and the decor looked rather too casual as well. On top of that, the food was not stellar. My slow-cooked lamb loin consisted of two small squares of ordinary-tasting lamb and cost $48. The ribeye was $76 and you could get better quality beef at one of those budget chain steakhouses.

A regret."
Birthday dinner on 7th Jan,"Would like to commend the staff for the attentive service. Thank you for remembering my request and surprise my friend with a birthday dessert. We especially enjoyed the mango prawn salad, truffle fries and paper baked halibut."
Corporate lunch,"Attended a corporate lunch - 3 courses; 1 starter, 1 main and 1 dessert.

Had the lemongrass and ginger prawn salad which has mango, tomato, glass noodles and ginger flower dressing which was refreshing. The serving was generous.

Had the salmon fillet with asparagus, pearl cous cous, Yuzu, coconut, soft herbs. Salmon cooked to the right doneness and the coconut taste was different in a good way.

Didn’t include in my photo is the dessert which is a seasonal scoop of ice cream.

Will be back to try their full menu."
Quite a disappointing experience,"Been to Halia Restaurant a couple of times and this is the worst by far. We ordered Wagyu steak and requested it to be 'Medium Rare' but it came close to 'Well Done'. It also taste like a regular steak.

Items are rather pricey perhaps due to the location but do not expect food or drinks to be anything better than a regular chained restaurant.

Don't think we will come again anytime soon."
bland,"the food was fresh but it was rather bland and extremely.. meh and disappointing. chairs weren’t that comfortable. service was so so. outdoor seating didn’t have strong enough fans to feel cooling in such hot weather. overall, just way way overpriced for this level of subpar mediocrity."
"Great ambience, excellent food, wonderful service.",A gem of a restaurant. Excellent food in an equally excellent setting. Lovely cool December weather; great menu selection and quality servings with service to match. A plus that it’s Halal certified too.
Had high expectations for the food quality and taste,"My friends and I visited this place for the first time as the atmosphere of the place is calming and beautiful. However, we had high expectations for the taste of the food as the prices were on the higher end. The food is of quality but we did not enjoy the taste as all of them were quite bland. We did not enjoy any of the main menu options, and desert. The only delicious food we loved was the truffle fries. The drinks were ok."
Worn out place and poor service,"Booked this place for anniversary dinner just looking at the photos on Instagram. But the place is so worn out, not just the place itself, all the tables, chairs and even water bottle. They are charging the price premium but the service is so poor. Even the payment, we had to go and pay at the counter on our own. The staff are not welcoming as well. Only the food and drinks are ok but still not worth the price. And normally, all the restaurants that we went for our anniversaries or birthday will always arrange small birthday cake or dessert if put a note in the reservation, this place, they didn't even give say ""Happy Anniversary"", didn't even dare to think about the dessert. So, we ended up getting the dessert somewhere else in Dempsey. The vibe and atmosphere is way more better than The Halia. I'll never go back to this place and would not recommend to any of my friends as well."
Fam dinner,Enjoyed the atmosphere and good service as always. Food was nice we had truffle fries some lamb and steak. All good. Satisfying dinner
"Delicious food, nice vibes, pricey","Enjoyed the fried lamb chops very much even though they were part of a seasonal menu Shrimp salad had a delicious mango dressing Chilli crab pasta was so-so, on the sweet side Ordered oysters as well, those were small and too pricey"
Good and beautiful dinner,"We went as a group of 5, celebrating my birthday. My daughter ordered salmon, my boy ordered wagyu cheek, my husband got the braised duck, my friend and I oredered the wrapped hallibut. All are ok. Service is good, although when we asked for an extra rice it took so long to get it. But overall nice atmosphere, good service. The price is steep but somehow it is worth it."
Decent food,"While the food was of decent quality, the experience could be improved with more attentive and pleasant service. Paper menus looked worn and old."
A restauarnt thag has past its time,"The pictures shown here are from better days when this was a well run higher end restuarant with great ambiance.
Today its wooden tables, centralise spoons and knives water on table (its dry) and ok service. The food from limited menu is ok but overall dissapointing for such a super location."
"Great service by staff, excellent ambience","Although there were a lot of requirements from the client, Tao Ha and team were great! Provided great service and was empathetic towards the guests. Flexible, and prompt service. Thank you for assisting us with the event and helped us so much :)"
Wedding of Lin & Colin,"We had a wonderful time at Lin & Colin’s wedding gathering with our family and friends, thanks to The Villa Botanic Gardens! The food’s delicious and the crew’s very proactive in serving the guests! Ryan, Tao Ha and Chelsea were especially amazing, and helpful throughout the event! Each time we called on them for help, they were ever ready to render their assistance! Their customer service, polite nature and friendliness has made us all feel welcomed at The Villa! Kudos to the entire team, and thank you!"
Holiday with my wife 2022,"We had a very nice lunch here after walking around the Botanic Gardens. We arrived at the Ginger gardens where this restaurant is, that uses ginger products in all its menu`s.
It was nice to sit in the middle of the garden surrounded by many types of gingers.
Very nice menu for lunch & not too expensive."
Not bad - the drinks are perhaps the best,"Small menu with dishes that sound more interesting than they are, but a large variety of non-alcoholic fruit and spice concoction drinks that are excellent. A good spot to rest for a while before continuing through the huge gardens"
Can be done better,The chairs are a bit dirty... The blinds should not use bright colour as mould can be seen very clear if blinds are down
Overall pleasant experience at Botanic garden,"We dined in for dinner with orders of four fresh drinks from bar, truffle fries, chili crab pasta n grilled barramundi. Fries come in gigantic portion while the mains are just decent. The ambiance was utterly comfy on a breezy night."
Not worth,Honest review from someone who likes to eat and not picky. And eating here is such a dissapoint. Overpriced and cannot even praise food is ok because it is not. Please review all you dishes and have a taste.
Great lunch,"Not my first time here, great to sit outdoors, ordered the same Chilli Crab Spaghettini and the juices. Good food and nice staff. Thank you!"
"Dining in a room with a view of gorgeous, colorful flowers and tropical foliage","The Malaysian word for ginger is ""halia"" which is where this restaurant is located in the Ginger Garden. Luxuriate in a tropical garden environment where the tasty food is also the star of the show. I had a grilled Barramundi fish with a wonderful fennel salad, roasted grapes and ginger flower hotsauce. The flavors complement each other and the portion was just right. Service was exceptional."
My Favorite Hidden Gem,"My #1 choice when friends come over from Indonesia and need a halal, cozy, delisg, awesome ambience place. Service was also excellent 👍🏽 One suggestion, brightened the indoor lighting by abiiit only hence still cozy but not dark."
Great food,"Visiting the Botanic Gardens we looked around for something to eat. The prawn salad with mango and glass noodles was amazing. The avocado on toast with a line of sliced tomatoes on top, tiny salad leaves and flowers. There was a crumble on it too that looked like feta. So beautiful looking at it, and even more beautiful eating it. Highly recommend going there."
A good cafe for a rest,"Decided to take a break from walking around the Botanic gardens for a short time and chose The Halia as it seemed relaxing.
We had the Cheese board with soft and hard cheeses, with condiments and a some fresh juices,
All were surprisingly nice, service was attentive as well.
it's worth a visit.
SGD $38.85 all up"
Birthday lunch,Amazed by the hospitality and warmth of Mdm Alice who took the initiative to surprise us with a plate of birthday dessert accompanied by a birthday song after she knew that we were here for a birthday lunch! :)
Great experience,"Such an amazing experience. Beautiful ambiance, great food and incredible service. Thank you so much Alice Lim for your warm welcoming and hospitality, thank you for putting a smile on our face 💚"
Little Gem,"In the middle of the botanical gardens, surrounded by green and nature, a perfect get away from the city's hustle, great food, and as important great friendly service, by Alice and the rest of the staff highly recommended"
Food was not great,The food was not that great. Not worth the price I paid for. I ordered she salmon which is not cooked properly still very pink inside and it was dry no sauce or flavour. The asparagus and cous cous also no flavour. My friend had crab pasta which was also not that flavourful. Was very disappointed with the food as I brought my friend there to treat her for her birthday.
Good Ambience and Food,"Went with a friend from US last week. The weather was good in the evening and so it was a perfect location in the Botanics. Ordered a Lemongrass and Prawn Salad, a Beef Curry and a Baked Halibut. The best dish was the baked Halibut as it was really tender, moist and flavorful in a Shitake mushroom sauce. The salad was good too although I think it can be slightly more spicy. The least to mention was the beef curry appetizer as it was rather dry and plain. Overall, my friend from the US really liked the environment and the food that was exotic for him. As with many other SG restaurants, I believe the service could be better if it wasn't under-staffed."
Chīllax al-fresco botanical surroundings Restaurant,"Address - 1 Cluny Rd, Ginger Garden Singapore Botanic Gardens, Singapore 259569
Highlights - Botanical al-fresco surroundings, Western fusion food & drinks
Avg. Price per Person - $50-$70
Rating - Our party of 3 managed to make a same day reservation for dinner at 7pm at The Halia, the pretty restaurant is enchantingly surrounded by greenery as it's situated within 200m from entrance of the Botanical gardens.
We enjoyed our hot ginger-honey cinnamon tea while overlooking the many leafy plants dancing in the evening breeze! Mains that were served shortly were all well executed in terms of flavours- paper-baked oven fish in savoury jap-soy sauce w mushroom made us clean off last grain of pearl rice in bowl, Waygu rump steak perfectly tender n seasoned, chilli crab spahagtti nothing to complain about too.
The Halia is indeed a chillax al-fresco dining restaurant suited for celebratory occasions with mid-priced point."
First & Last,"Ambience - don’t be conned by their online portal picture. It was not well kept & floor was dirty in the indoor seating. (3/10)
Service - so so. (3/10)
Food quality - so so (4/10)
Value for money - not worth it all in all given my above review (2/10)

Note for the restaurant owner: please replace your metal cups/flask that you use for water serving, the cup has very strong rusty smell… I stopped drinking after 1 sip. The cups for your ice tea etc, about time to replace them too..

No picture to share."
Unique dinner experience among tropical plants.,"The outside room of the Halia is my favourite place for business dinners in Singapore. After a few sub-optimal experiences, this restaurant seems to have recovered its pre-pandemic level of quality. The delicious fresh mussels in coconut cream are back to the menu."
"Delicious food on pricy side, attentive service, conducive for chatting, lots of hungry mosquitoes!","Beware of mosquitoes especially at outdoor seats in evening. Handful of bites on my ankles, that swells to elephant trunk-like for 3 days. Otherwise, love the chilli crab spaghetti and not too noisy environment (good for chatting)."
Bad,"The service was bad, the table was nearly broken and they were refused to change for us. And so many ants on the table, even in the watermelon juice, so disgusting."
Disappointed with the menu selection,"With a name like Halia, I thought they would have a fusion of Malay or Peranakan food however we could only find western menu. The taste was good however nothing spectacular. The price is a little on the expensive side. The surroundings is beautiful. The only saving grace is the service. They do have good people working there."
Good service & decent food,The service was good and the staff very friendly. The food were served in decent sized portions…overall everything is great.
not as good as pre-COVID!,"I took an overseas visitor there as I had fond memories from three years ago. It was less well maintained, one main course arrived with the starters, and the service was poor."
Delicious food in lovely setting,Had a delightful lunch at The Halia - we sat on the veranda and enjoyed the view whilst enjoying a leisurely lunch. The prawn and mango salad was beautifully presented and the perfect light lunch before a walk through the Botanic Gardens. The staff were pleasant. I look forward to my next visit.
It cannot be only about the location,"Well in short I am not going to the restaurant to eat a salad out of bag, Halia do have a very nice location but the experience has to be about the food as well. Trust with the reopening and now more affluence they will reconnect with their past quality"
Bitten By Unknown Insects - Service Recovery,"Went to celebrate my birthday dinner but was bitten by unknow insects. We feedback to the cashier 1 hour later after our dinning, while waiting for the bill, only then she offered an insect repellent and switched on the electrical insect repellent under our table.
I wrote in to them on the 3rd day morning as the itch was unberable from the 2nd night. It's not any common mosquitoe bites and it looked serious. A lady contacted me the following day to advise me to see a doctor and offered a reimbursement, she is kind to include a returned value voucher although I didn't mention anything about birthday. I am happy with their response but my concern is on the 16 bitten areas that might left me with scar."
Worth the experience,Food portion are abit too little. Pasta was just few mouthful. Veggies side dish are a little over the cost with such small portion. Desserts and Main course too little choices.
Halia,"Wish they have nicer tables and chairs, existing old. Greenery environment Service and food was fast and good. Will revisit again."
Sweet memorable experience,"We had a wonderful 80th Birthday celebration for my mom at The Villa by Halia at Singapore Botanic Gardens. Every food item that was served up was a surprise, unexpectedly bursting with delightful flavors and pleasing to the eyes! Just love them all the way to the desserts! The warmth and attentiveness of the service staff Ha and Irwan made this evening in every way a memorable one. Thank you all!"
Nestled in a quaint corner of Bot Gdn - a taste and sight experience,Spices make Southeast Asian food rich and unique and The Halia exemplify this very well. The food and drinks were tastefully done and layered with various spices enhancing the overall tastes. It was a wet afternoon. It was enjoyable sitting at the open air area of the restaurant.
GREAT EXPECTATIONS SQUASHED,"The main course was served too fast. We have not finished our appetizer and the main course was served. It was a rainy evening and hence the food turned cold rather quickly. Especially the pasta which great flavour vanquished.
Service was so-so. maybe not enough staff. One of the staff was rather chop-chop and impatient."
Delightful setting,"Halia is in the heart of the Botanical Gardens, next to the ginger garden from which it is occasionally visited by sunbirds. It's a beautiful setting with a choice between indoor and outdoor seating. For drinks (no alcohol) there is an imaginative range of fresh mixes with the emphasis on ginger. The mains were beautifully prepared from fine ingredients and served promptly. It's a great place for a relaxing dinner in the heart of bustling Singapore."
Garden Bliss,"I have been coming to The Halia for several years during my business travels to Singapore. Indeed, on my last trip I managed three dinners at the Halia in the short time I was there. What keeps me coming back? Certainly the location is a huge draw for me. To have dinner in the open air (or inside if you prefer) amongst the Botanic Gardens and then know a relaxing stroll is in order afterwards seems to be the perfect way to end a long work day. The staff are caring and attentive and have always made me feel at home. All of that would be reason to dine there. Still, it is the attention to detail in the cooking that brings me back. Every dish I've enjoyed has been of the highest quality ingredients, cooked and seasoned to perfection. The construction of the meal is thoughtful, with each component lifting the other. My favorite this last time out was the salmon with pearl couscous and asparagus. Sublime cookery. I will continue to return whenever I have the opportunity to be in Singapore."
Food choices,Just felt the food was not so nice with high value . The vacinity of the place is awesome. Only that the foodwise is not so good . Need to improve on that. Definitely not coming back . Sorry Halia
Dining at Halia in Botanic Gardens,"The salmon we ordered is nicely cooked, tender and juicy. The truffle fragrance of truffle fries is just nice. The only thing need to improve is the controlling over mosquitos. I know it's hard at out door diving area. Perhaps can provide guests with mosquito repellent upon request."
A relaxing lunch,Great as always. My friend and I had a lovely lunch at Halia. We love the tropical garden setting and relaxing atmosphere. Quality of food is good although the items on the menu for a light meal tends to be very limited. Likewise the range of tea offerings is also small. We also thought that Halia could benefit from some touch ups to refresh itself.
Had a pleasant dinner with my friends,"Great food, friendly staff, and a pleasant atmosphere. Couldn’t have asked for more. Thanks Halia for the great service."
Overpriced and average food,"$18 for a basket of fries is unseen in the world. Never paid that much for simple fries.
Also, the cheese plate is disappointing. How can you sell three tiny pieces of cheese for $18 ?!!
The location is great but prices and food quality are a real let down. Will not come back again..."
Overrated.,"Front of house is superb but can't say the same for their food. It's not terrible, but overrated. My first visit here but definitely will be my last."
Food,"My partner and i had our lunch at Halia, and we werent too please with the food. I had the spaghettini chili crab, felt that there was a strong tomato taste which im not a fan of. my partner had halibut paperbag, the sauce(?) is actually bland. not really worth the money"
"Fast service, not too pricey, nice location","Pleasant experience. Weather was nice too. Food was alright, servers were very attentive. The food came out very quickly"
Good ambience with great service,"We booked this place for a farewell dinner, the dessert we ordered came with farewell themed captions. Thank you to the thoughtful crew members at this restaurant.

The only down side was we could not use the Chope voucher as we did not inform the waitress at the concierge (but we informed her when ordering the food).

Overall a good experience. Will visit again."
Breakkie at Halia,The ambience and staff was very good. Could have more dishes. Drinks were excellent. Will come back again.
A disappointing experience,The food is tasteless and dry. There isn't too much varieties or choice that we can choose from the menu. Very disappointing as I as the birthday girl left your restaurant hungry there is nothing for me to as except french fries and omellete!
Treat for the palate,"An absolutely delectable meal. Everything was just so perfect. Never quite tasted anything quite like the way they prepare the dishes. Highly recommended - chicken breast, chilli crab pasta, yuzu cheesecake."
Great food lack attention in service,"Came to celebrate my wife's birthday. Greeted immediately at the door by a friendly host. He walked us to our table and gave us the menu and left. We were not familiar with the menu and had questions and was hoping to get a staff to answer them however everyone was busy. The staff passed by our table without eye contact. Even when I tried to call out they just walked pass us. However when I did manage to get the attention of one of the staff, he was kind and polite to answer us. When we were ready to order we experienced the same thing where no one approached us to ask if we are ready or did not make eye contact towards our table to check on us. I had to stand up to call the staff to let them know we are ready. We were seated right at the front of the bar where it should be easy to for the staff to see us

Food was great. It was delicious. We ordered the cheese platter, lamb loin, salmon, beef cheek, and 2 other mains. No complains, they were all really good.

During our dinner, no staff checked on us. Water wasn't refilled until requested which took us another effort to get their attention.

Overall I think the food saved the day. All the staff were wonderful when interacted with. Just needs them to be more attentive towards the customers. It felt like a transaction where we came, we are and we left. Expected more from such a renowned establishment."
Humble Halia,"Nestled in the botanic gardens, this is a restaurant that truly remains unknown by many. (which is good!) Service staff are warm and friendly, not overly intrusive, and attentive to details. The mains are a wonder, the appetisers could be worked on. Yet, overall, a good option for those who want a quiet night out with an ambience in nature."
Birthday 🎁,"Good service from frontline, very nature feels. All foods served is so fresh and gd services with smiles. This is my first time been e restaurant with best services only abit disappointed as requested for birthday 🎂 did not provide & it had been ignored."
Mediocre at best,"Food quality and portion versus value is not great. Service was sincere but server ignorantly dished out inaccuracy on the menu when asked; what does “organically farmed lacto chicken mean?”, he said it meant that the chicken was slow cooked for 48 hrs hence very tender. Drinks in carafe were rather pretentious too."
Will come again!,"Came here to celebrate my girlfriend’s and I 3rd anniversary. Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly by the hostess. Along the way to our table, the staffs welcomed us with a smile and we immediately love the vibe there!

The menu for brunch was quite limited but we both managed to settle in for their Signature Chill Crab Spaghetti and Slow Cooked Beef Rendang Toasted Sourdough. It came pretty quick and we were stunned by the presentation of the food. If only we can buy it for display haha!

Anyways, the rendang was amazing! I have been finding for a good rendang and I believe this is it. The taste was superb, the sourdough bread was good too! The portion was also enough for me. My girlfriend loves the chill crab spaghetti. It was not so spicy and suits her preference. The bonus point for it...there was so much crab meat!!! They are so generous with it!

Dessert was the best part. We got the Honeydew Sago and Sticky Toffee Pudding. Both was incredibly delicious! We were also surprised by the dessert as the staff went the extra mile to have a “Happy 3rd Anniversary” decorated on the plate and even wished us! It truly made our dining experience even better.

Overall, it is a good place to have a get together with friends or family. The ambiance of the place makes us comfortable and relaxed. Will definitely recommend this place to everyone I know and we would love to come here again!"
Excellent restaurant,"Employees were all very nice and helpful. On top of that, energetic and very attentive! Food was well made and had a nice presentation. Thank you for the amazing dinner!"
Really nice for a fancy brunch,"Good ambience, service and great food! We had the cauliflower & shallot, Halia's breakfast, toffee pudding and a jug of appletini - all perfect!"
Lunch at Halia,"Lovely ambiance , amazing dessert and amazing service. A very cosy place for a relaxed meal. Recommend."
Good dinner experience,The service crew were very friendly and helpful. All were very professional. The food came in good time and was tasty. Well portioned as well
Delightful Meal Nestled within Botanic Gardens,"Wonderful atmosphere for lunch or dinner, short 2min walk on slight gradient from drop off access point (Holland Road) past the ""waterfall"" feature. Good quality fusion food. We had the beef cheeks and cod fish in a paper bag - both very good - came with mash and rice respectively. The CGC drink (cumin, ginger, cinnamon was a tad strong for me. Service was attentive although they looked like they were short handed - periods where there were no staff around. Aircon or al fresco dining available. My only unhappiness was that I had been charged 4 CGCs instead of the 3 CGCs we had and only realized after we left."
ordinary but expensive food,The atmosphere is nice but the food is very ordinary but super expensive. The brunch options are very limited. I ordered a tea which cost me $8.
Everything is great!,I have been visiting The Halia as a yearly affair. The service and quality of food have never disappoint me. Highly recommended!
"Pleasant Vibe, Accommodating Staff","First thing I'll say is that the brunch food was delicious! We had a cocktail jug, avocado toast, the halia breakfast, and the charred broccolini. Surprisingly the charred broccolini was by far the tastiest of everything.

Initially we waited quite a while for our food. It was more than 30 minutes before we had gotten our food and a neighboring table, with more people who had arrived later, got their food first. However, before we even asked about it, when the waiter brought out our food they covered our cocktail jug as compensation for the long delay. The fact that we didn't have to even ask was nice!"
Lunch at Halia restaurant at Botanical gardens,"The salmon and prawn salad were delicious and fresh. The tea was great too.
We had enjoyed our meal very much. The ambience inside was cooling and we have more than enough time to finish our meal though we are told to leave after 90 min.
Thank you"
Lovely restaurant in the Botanical gardens,Halal fine dining in Singapore. In the midst of the botanical gardens. - even in the rain at night -a lovely environment. Food was generous and tasty using great selection of exotic ingredients in traditional European dining. Highly recommend. Service is fine and friendly albeit menu options re a little inflexible.Great looking desserts regrettably made with nuts - so could not enjoy.-
Excellent,The food was awesome and amazing i like so much!! The service was excellent such a great experience!
Family lunch,"booked 2 tables a wk ago, upon arrival waited more than 20 min b4 let in & only 1 table given.ordered food waited more than half hr, I went to washrm & my plate was removed, I haven't finished eating, ordered additional rice came aft more than half hr. It's a real waiting game, I really don't feel comfortable, the place is very old, drink flask & other utensils also old. Our first & last visit we're locals Singaporeans, luckily we didn't bring in guests imagine the embarrassment with such poor service & environment"
psa,"probably won't be back at night. I requested and sat indoors but staff didn't close the doors so insects still went in and I had really bad sandfly bites which became really swollen the next day. :(

food was okay, I think their brunch menu is nicer and has more choices. Dinner menu was probably just not our palate. but overall, the service was good and staff was friendly."
Left as soon as possible,"Unfortunately, we will not be coming back. My partner and I were celebrate our anniversary and booked a reservation! We were disappointed on multiple instances.

Mosquito bites under the table
We were seated outdoors, which was fine. But there were so many mosquitoes that were feasting on our legs even though we were covered up. At least the mosquitoes had a nice meal :'( Certainly, there are organic ways to repel them.

Poor Ambience
Ambience is overhyped. The place was just too noisy to converse properly, perhaps it was the acoustics of the place but the conversations of our neighbouring tables were amplified. I wouldn't recommend it all for those who prefer a more peaceful ambience for an important date night. The outdoor lighting was pretty dim. Coupled with the mosquito bites, the flickering lights caused by the ceiling fan was beginning to be headache inducing.

Unsatisfactory Food and Service
Utensils served were not cleaned properly. On top of the already lacking menu selection, the steak of the day was unavailable. Food was substandard, especially for the price. The price for the drinks were alright, but nothing special either. You would fare better eating at the nearby Dempsey Hill for the same price. My partner and I ended up trying to finish our meal as quick as possible just to leave the venue.

Spent a hundred dollars for a very poor experience.

The staff were really nice though, thank you for trying your best. My partner and I are not usually the type to leave reviews - but this experience was most memorable and not in a positive way."
Great setting & location. Very nice food,"Very good quality of food. Friendly service staff. Some highlighted menu items infused with the signature ginger (""halia"" in Malay) ingredient."
will not come again,"Had prawn salad, to be honest it's just mediocre, some cheap thai food serve better and tasty salad.
we ordered lamb loin, which was on high price side. the sauce was okay and we loved the quinoa porride with the green bean.
and order a chili crab pasta, it definetely nor worth the price, the taste is not as good as others hawkers i had tried.
and the most memorable of this restaurant? i was stung by unknown insects and i suffered itchyness and pain, red lump with sac filled fluid. :("
So so,"Seems the standard have dip quite significantly. This is our 2nd time here, the prices getting steeper, yet the portion getting smaller. The taste is off for most of the food. Except for the service, only go if someone else is paying it."
Great Ambience,"ambience was great and service was excellent. athough there was a time limit, time given was sufficient"
Brunch By The Garden,Had my first brunch @ The Halia with my bff. LOVE the ambience. Staff was friendly and food was AWESOME!!
Great atmosphere,Venue was away from the sight of the city. That was a plus point. Restaurant located at the heart of Botanic Garden. The food was wonderfully good. We love it.
Dinner with friends,"Great ambience, very close to nature. Great service, adhering to our needs and request and great food"
Cozy Lunch at Singapore Botanic Gdn,"Plenty of parking space around Botanic Garden, the dining experience is cozy with good food and clean space."
Dinig Reservation,"Excellent ambience, service and food. Looking forward to my next visit! The food was great. Staff manage to assist me in celebrating my wife’s birthday brunch."
Fantastic Place. You won't regret!,"I've heard from my friends that the food and services are great there. Since I was having a staycation near Botanic Garden, I decided to dine there. The steak was fantastic! My friend's chili crab pasta was also superb. Their services was excellence. I will definitely come again to try other dishes there."
don’t come here,food was expensive yet small in portion - ordered the halibut which cost $33 for only 1 small fillet that barely makes an appetizer. staff was rude - snatched the menu out of my hands. mosquitos everywhere.
"Menu a total letdown. Not balance with the price that you charge the customers. Chef, please wake up and look at your co","Service Is awesome but the selection of food is a letdown. Mgt of halia, please do something about your menu selection. Chef of the halia, please wake up. Your competitor able to provide more variety than u have. U will start to lose customers if u are not improving. Mgt please wake up. Work closely with your chef"
Nice setting in Botanical Gardens,"Had an enjoyable lunch at the HALIA. The prawn mango salad was good, as was the beef cheeks. Seating was in an outdoor patio. The place seemed quite crowded & noisy. Seems more suitable to visit in evenings with family & friends.
Not so convenient to get there"
Food and service,"Love the food. It’s so delicious. Best steak I ever heard… plating and desert were on point. Attention to details. The waiter, is nice and helpful."
Refreshing,I really enjoy having breakfast in the park. The staff from the time you enter until you leave are very nice. Special thanks to Alice Tan.
Wedding anniversary brunch,We were there with our daughter. Ordered her bolognese kids meal but she ended up eating a bit of our halibut and beef cheek instead. Flavours there are spiced infused and was too overwhelming for the kid. But the adults appreciated the fine tastes. I heard there was truffle fries before this. Might be good to bring it back at least as finger food for the kids. Ambience is great because botanic Gardens :)
Will come again!,This is the 2nd visit for my husband and I. We love the food; they are well-cooked and delicious! The service provided was great!
