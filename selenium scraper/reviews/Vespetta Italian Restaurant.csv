Great Italian!,"A little gem by the river! I had the Bruschetta and pasta vongole, both delicious, generous portions and good value for money! Great service from our Italian waiter, very welcoming. Lovely atmosphere! I will be back!"
Excellent restaurant,Had a really good Italian meal here in the middle of the Singapore Grand Prix - very nice lamb and a really good steak washed down with some Chianti! Recommended
The best Italian restaurant,"After having tried three different restaurant in Singapore, this was the best to us. Wonderful and fantastic ""Bolognese"" and ""Orecchiette con la burrata"". I advice the ""Bruschette"" as well."
Okay pizza but great dessert!,"The pizza at this Italian restaurant just.. alright. The pasta was mediocre as well. However, the apple pie dessert was excellent!"
Decent,Very generous serving of chicken - quite pricey but was definitely worth it. Although a very small serving of posties alongside it. Pizza was also not bad - decent priced
Excellent.,I regularly come to this place for excellent food and nice atmosphere. Friendly service and good quality makes this a good choice.
Fair Italian fare - nothing stands out,"Came here on a quiet weekday - made a reservation but it was not necessary at all - hardly a crowd along Boat Quay. Ordered the Buratta as a starter - it was not bad but I had much better renditions elsewhere. The pasta - Alio Olio and Risotto were not bad - decent sized portions. The clams were quite fresh on the risotto. I ordered the Milanese - this is a letdown. First of all, it was not Veal - which should be the meat Milanese should be cooked with. Parts of the Veal was cooked well done but other parts were quite rare. Service wise - it was quick and efficient. The setting should be much nicer in the evenings when it is cool and breezy."
Food is mediocre but service is TERRIBLE,"The food was not too bad but the service was TERRIBLE. I booked a reservation was 7:30 pm and specifically called in earlier in the morning to have outdoor seating by the riverside. I was informed that in order to have that, I would have to arrive earlier around 7:00 pm. We arrived at 6:30 pm and was seated outside. However, we were not given the tables we requested for.

We checked and queried and was repeatedly turned down by the Manager / Owner (caucasian male). Only when my order was taken by the lady that took my call earlier, were we given the seat we requested for. But this was clearly done with absolute reluctance.

To make things worse, the manager/owner mentioned that the table was reserved. Only to give it up for caucasian diners with no reservations and just walking in.

Throughout dinner, the manager/owner had no qualms going around table to table asking about the food and service but conveniently skipped over us. ONLY US. Furthermore, when it was time to pay there was no communication. He took my card and returned it. No thank yous, no nothing.

IF YOU'RE ASIAN STAY AWAY. As they only seem to communicate and cater to the caucasian customers.

Additional Information from his unpleasant and dreadful reply: as people can judge from the owner's reply, his defence is to generalise the rude and atrocious behaviour exhibited by his staff, as 'hospitable service from Italy', be elusive and apologise to shift the blame thereafter shows what kind of restaurant this is. Stay away unless you're caucasian from this rude and racist restaurant."
Homely place with good food.,Good quality food and service from the owner/manager. Wide ranging menu in a relatively small place with homely ambiance.
Good food!,Good food and ambience! Authentic Italian food! Quality 5/5 and quantity3/5(if you’re a big eater). Would visit again
Delicious food along the Singapore river,"Fanciful location for a romantic dinner in the busy city center.
The spaces by the river is great with a pleasant view, food was great from starter to dessert.
Perfect spot along Boat Quay for an authentic Italian fare, with good wines.
The restaurant has as well a private room on second floor."
Best Italian Restaurant in Singapore!!!,"Vespetta is one of the Top Italian restaurant in Singapore that you must try! The food is absolutely outstanding in terms of taste & presentation. A careful thought through menu of a Classic Italian Food that is paired with outstanding combinations of flavors. Wonderful Italian Restaurant with attentive waiters. Presentation of food was beautiful & preparation by Italian Chef was thoughtful. This restaurant is perfect to visit for any occasion.

I will definetly fo back for more!"
Italian wine pairing,"Another beautiful dinner and wine pairing. The food is wonderful but the set menu hasn’t changed in over a year so only four stars. Would like to have some new options. Leave room for the tiramisu, it’s delicious!"
Good food with beautiful view,"Ordered carpaccio ( very delicious), calamari (normal), ravioli ( can't remember which one, but it was very good). Their wine is good too. Used chop voucher which makes it quite value for the money."
Poor & Unprofessional Customer Service,"Based on all good reviews of this restaurant - I made a booking 3 weeks in advance for dinner to celebrate Valentine's day. We reached 10 minutes early only to find out that our tables were not reserved and the tables were all been given to other diners. Not sure why take the reservation and not hold it for the diners who have booked early in advance.

Manager and the staff were very busy and after standing for 5 minutes and complaining, manager said that every single one of the diners have booked 3 weeks in advance - don't think I will believe that - a bit unprofessional not to have a reserved table when already booked in advance, messed up all our plans for the night.

Maybe they have amazing food but we never got a chance to try it and I don't think I will visit this restaurant again nor would I recommend it based on this bad customer service."
Good place for celebration,"We having birthday celebration for friend in this restaurant. We bring our own cake, and they are kind enough to deco for it when serve to the birthday girl.

Good foods and good view. Is chills and relax place to having dinner here with natural windy"
"Amazing View, Amazing Food and Service","We were seated by the river, which is strongly recommended. You can see the beautiful city while dining. We were also fortunate to see rainbow too. The food is beyond satisfaction. Wine collection is sufficient. Service is beyond average."
BEWARE Diners if you're using your Entertainer App promotion - Underwhelming Experience,"Restaurant is not genuine with the Entertainer App promotion. We have a party of 5, ordered 6 main courses and a bottle of wine. The manager did not allow us to use 3 sets of 1for1 voucher bacause we only have 5 persons. We'd to pay full price for the other 2 main courses.
I have never had this issue with any of the other participating restaurants.
Food is very average - I will never be back and will not recommend this restaurant to anyone"
Decent Italian food but not amazing,"Booked during restaurant week for a Friday dinner date. The food took quite long to come, probably due to the crowd on that night. So far it was quite a nice experience. The food was decent, though not really fall of the chair quality. The starter seafood soup was surprisingly good. Same for the nice calamari, with very thin and light batter. The squid was fresh and chewy. As for main course, the squid ink pasta was quite good, but the rib eye steak was just normal, a bit heavy on the seasoning. Desserts were good too. I love the tiramisu, very creamy and not so sweet and not so strong alcoholic taste. Chocolate salami was a pleasant surprise despite the confusing name, and went well with the vanilla chocolate. Nice glasses of chianti red, strong and crisp and a bit spicy. But aperol spritz was a bit too bitter.

Overall a good but not amazing meal. As there are so many Italian restaurants, I would say the chance of us coming back here is at most 50%.

Very good view towards the river and opposite ACM. We had a cool and relaxing walk back to Esplanade after the meal, and the scene was beautiful. That capped off a nice night out. Love the bustling night club scene of Boat Quay on Friday night too. It made Covid less scary and brought back some sense of normalcy for us."
Lack of humility,"We had ordered the Calzone Alla Nutella which as per the menu description is supposed to be served with strawberries and vanilla gelato. In our case was served without strawberries so we asked for it. The staff called their owner and their owner said, ' the strawberries are just served on the side, it is not a big deal'. The point is not that it was a big deal or not, they should have mentioned either at the time of taking the order or serving it. They cant decide whether it is a small or big thing for us. We wanted to have it with strawberries and we would have changed our order if strawberries weren't available. Looks like they were out of strawberries and hence, didn't call it out. Later, they did serve a complimentary strawberry gelato but by then we were almost through with our meal. This was our 2nd visit to Vespetta, the first visit was amazing though."
Authentic Italian,This is place is a find for Italian food- the real deal- especially seafood. Everything we ate was excellent. Not that we were surprised but for a boat quay restaurant- it's a find. Service was very good too. Nothing disappointed at all. will go back- many times. Good prices as well. Lovely view too.
Fake Italian,"I ordered tagliatele ragu and they brought me fettuccine ragu. It was take away so I didn't notice until I was at my hotel.

They do not even know the difference beteeen fettucini and tagliatelle.

I won't waste my time or money on this overpriced Fake Italian Restaurant again."
Finger nails found in Food!!!,"My friend bit into a finger nail look alike in their torta de mele!!! When we told the serving staff, we did not get a respond from them at all!!!
This is unacceptable for a restaurant, especially at times like now where cleanliness is utmost important."
great Pasta authentic sauce,Nice Food but expensive. Would be nice to have happy hour for drinks & Dinner set allows choices for main course.
A piece of Italy award fronte home,"it is not the first time that my family and I come to Singapore, so once again dominated by the coronavirus covid 19 we are here for the holidays, as good Italians looking for a restaurant that satisfies our immediate homesickness ... ..and we found it! The ""vespetta"" restaurant pleasantly surprised us for the high quality of the food, for their cooking in respect of the most genuine tradition, that is, the simplicity of the flavors that make you appreciate true good food. the courtesy and discretion of its manager / owner Mr. Ciccone closes the quality circle of the restaurant, located in Boat Quay on the Marina Bay canal in one of the most suggestive places in Singapore for an evening of good food! .... definitely to be recommended and brought in memory of a piece of Italy away from home."
Impressed by the value,Incredibly nice staff and manager Francesco. Amazing value for such an original italian food! I will be back sure here to try more of the menu!
genuinely Italian,"I am glad to be back visiting this restaurant La Vespetta Italiana. I am always here when I visit Singapore, to taste some amazing genuinely Italian food!"
Tiramisu just like nonna’s!,"Walking around Boat Quay we dropped in for a coffee then decided to stay for lunch. Everything was great, service, food, view over the river. Fried cuttlefish and a mixed grill were perfect. The steak in the grill was a perfect medium rare, tender and flavourful. The highlight was definitely the tiramisu we shared for dessert, home made, just like nonna’s! It was like an angel crying on your tongue :)"
Great dinner along the river,"Had a really good dinner here while on business. Riverside tables were ""reserved"" but was able to get one right on the water. Nice breeze kept it comfortable. Maitre D was clearly Italian and the cuisine reflected it. Gnocchi with gorgonzola and walnuts was really good. Rosemary chicken was excellent - succulent and juicy and large portions. Decent wine selection and service was very good."
"A perfectly nice pizza, but nothing special","A perfectly nice pizza, but nothing special. They don’t seem to do a happy hour like most of the bars around them"
More than expected,Wide variety and fresh ingredients that made everything come together perfectly. The husband is a picky eater - especially having worked and lived in Italy for 5 years thus has expectations when it comes to Italian cuisine. This restaurant doesn't fail and we will definitely come back for more. We can't wait to try out the rest of the dishes soon!
Great food,"Recently we tried the food at Vespetta Italian Restaurant where we had a variety of pizza and pasta and all dishes were delightful. The service from Michael just added to the experience with his genuine Italian warmth and attention to customer service
As i looked around at other dinners their, they all seemed to be enjoying their meals.
A pleasant area to sit along the boardwalk whilst enjoying a glass of wine with your dinner."
Birthday dinner,"The foods are authentic. Presentation and the taste of the foods are excellent too. Price wise if there is a discount given it will be very worth. Downside, restaurant abit warm and limited manpower."
Great pizza in Singapore,The pizza was authentic and delicious. Margarita pizza with focaccia bread and bruschetta to start with. We ended with the coffee ice cream dessert. The views were amazing and food was terrific. It’s a happening area.
Great service and fab food,"Wonderful service and great Italian food in a very nice setting. Sometimes as a solo diner I'm given the worst table, but not as Vespetta, that's the sign of a restaurant that cares about delighting it's customers over a little extra profit."
It’s fine but I wouldn’t recommend it if any one asked.,"The food was ok. Mediocre.
Ordered a vongole and some of clam shells were cracked. Accidentally chewed on several shells and was painful when I least expected it.

The service was ok as well. I booked this place about 3 weeks in advance. I requested for a candle on my dessert as i was celebrating someone’s bday. Just bfr the dessert, i personally went to remind them that ive alr ordered a dessert and it can be served when i’m at my seat. The waiter agreed. However, when it was served, there wasn’t any candle.... oh wells.

I think with only two waiters they were pretty overwhelmed on a saturday night so I just let it slide.

Sat outdoors, ambience was fine too."
Delightful and delicious,"We love Asian food, but sometimes you need a break from it, and it was not easy to find a good variety of vegetarian offerings in Singapore.

We were strolling around Boat Quay when we found this lovely little waterfront restaurant opposite the Asian Civilisations Museum. The staff are simply wonderful- attentive, polite, friendly, informative and charming Italians, fluent in English.

We sat at a white dining table and chairs under a retractable shade roof, enjoying the scenery and ambience.

We had the Four cheese pizza and spinach gnocchi with Gorgonzola and walnuts. Both were absolutely delicious. Our waiter expedited our order as we had a flight to catch that evening. A delightful last night in Singapore."
dinner,a nice little restaurant at boat quay. sit outdoor for a view of the river. had the beef and tiramisu. good food quality. decent service.
Amazed,"I have to admit I’m not a fan of mussels but this time I fight with my friend to have the last one!!! The mussels were fresh and not fish smelling, the tomato sauce so good that I couldn’t refrain myself to clean the plate with the focaccia!
We closed the dinner with amazing Sicilian cannoli and delicious pistachio ice cream.
Great location on the river.
Michael that helped us to choose the food, was very professional and attentive.
The staff allowed us to stay at the table and finish our wine after closing the restaurant and without moving the wine into plastic glasses! Really appreciate it!
Highly recommended!"
"Delightful tastes, attentive service.","Two of us dined on two appetizers, the mussels and the polpo salad. The mussels were perfectly cooked and had an exceptional tomato-based sauce. We were amazed. So much so that we ordered foccacia to dip in it, thus making a satisfying dinner. The salad was okay but I'd try something different next time with the mussels. Michael was our waiter and was friendly, attentive, and explained the dishes well. He said some dishes were from Puglia. Probably a place to save for a special occasion, as the prices are as 'special' as the views from Boat Quay."
"Recommend terrace , quasi Italian","Restaurant in Barbour area, said to be Italian , no really, kind of as many other places said to be Italian restaurants around the globe. If you go there, recommend a table In the terrace and dinner. Extremely warm, better go when no so hot outside. Pasta is acceptable, too cooked for Italian."
Expensive with average food and pricey wine,"Waiters arrogant and kept interrupting us. Didnt want to tell us the year of the 16.00++ for a small glass of chilled house red wine ,had to ask 3 times,after which they reluctantly said 2017.they said 2017 is the best wine in all italy . No free bread anymore when you order wine ,they have rebranded themselves as a ""fine Italian restaurant "" so no more happy hours etc. 98 for a bottle of primitivo that sells for 26.00 at Wine Connection

Give this pricey place a miss ,there are far better ones for the same price"
Stunning is a good word,I quite like Italian restaurants where the white sauce has just enough cream and doesn't make you sick. This place surely has that. The food is delicious and views are great. It's ideal for an evening out after one has a long stroll to eat here.
Delicious,"Delicious pastas, good service and great location. About $100/pp for a shared starter, a main each and a bottle of wine. Service could be a bit more personable/engaging but good regardless."
Great place for amazing dinner!!!,"After a stroll up from Marina Bay Sands passes Vespetta, fantastic attentive service and delicious meals with great view... We all loved it!!!"
Lovely view and service,"The restaurant is by the river and it has lovely views and there was a gentle breeze in the evening. The staff were attentive and provided prompt service. Foodwise, I had the Calzone and recommended red wine. Calzone could be better as it tend to get slightly sloggy as I was eating it. The salami was kinda hard to break with my teeth (I struggled slightly while trying to be ladylike :)). It didn't spoil anything though and I had a lovely evening. It will be perfect if they can provide Happy Hours and the stay could be longer while enjoying a drink."
lunch sets,came here for a business lunch and the lunch sets were pretty decent - I ordered a pasta while my boss tried the pizza service staff were friendly as well the outdoor seating provided us a relaxing view of the Singapore River
Lunch Break.....,"My initial impression of Vespetta is pleasant, warm & cosy.
Genuine authenticity of southern Italiano food and wine is just superb!
I'd enjoyed the freshness and well prepared Grilled Chicken with fresh cherry tomatoes and greens...super yummy!
The Tiramisu is to die for!
The services are top notch!
Will definitely be back for a second run, well done!"
Great location,"We went to the waterfront location where Vespetta is and initially intended on Indian as we hadn’t had a curry for a while, however, when you have so many choices, we opted for Italian.

Though there were a few Italian options to choose from we chose Vespetta & there wa no deciding factor.

Pleased we did as probably the main thing we enjoyed from a service aspect was the waiter.

He was Italian who spoke excellent English, was knowledgeable about wine and food, had traveled and was aware of what was happening in the world.

When we placed our order, he tried to get us to change to a Pinot Grigio as opposed to a Kiwi Pinot Gris, good try we told him, but being Kiwis we wanted a wine we knew before heading off to Thailand where wine options are less apparent.

The food we ordered was great, the location was lovely and to dine outside was enjoyable as the temp had dropped from earlier in the day.

Though we had a good meal and an enjoyable time, there are that many options in Singers, that I probably wouldn’t make a bee line for Vespetta when I return."
"Great location, good service and tasty food","Wandering around looking for somewhere that inspired us for dinner. No hassling here and menu looked good so we took a chance. Glad we did....the bruschetta was perfect, the wagyu lasagne very tasty as was the house salad and there was even an Nz wine on the menu! Sitting by the water watching the world go by...perfect evening."
5.30pm,"We came here for an early dinner at 5.30pm. The staff are all very attentive and kind. The food is wonderful. There is a big selection of starters and pasta. We highly recommend the funghi risotto. And the two ravioli dishes are fantastic, whether stuffed with spinach or mushrooms, the ravioli pieces are just the right degree of al dented and the sauces are on point.

The dessert calzone (for 2 persons) is wonderful!

The wine selection is extensive too. We had the bottle of Prosecco and the Abruzzo.

We will definitely come back again."
What happened?,"One of our favorite restaurant to hang out with family for an easy pizza dinner. The service and food quality were always excellent. Unfortunately staff has changed. The quality of all our pizzas was not good. They were cold, dough chewy, taste was flat. Pizza with burata was substituted with mozzarella. We know the difference staff, do not scam clients !
So what happened?
Call to the owners to investigate and revive the old formula."
Lunch by the River,"We had lunch recently at Vespetta. The restaurant is at Boat Quay and has tables inside the restaurant and also along then river.
Food was very good. We shared an Octopus Salad (which was excellent) and a Parma Pizza washed down by a nice Italian Pino Grigio.
It was a very relaxing spot to sit and watch the world go by.
A lovely spot for lunch!"
Table with a view,"One of the delights of Singapore is the Boat Key where dozens of restaurants encircle the water like the Venetian canals in Las Vegas (only these are not “fake’ canals).

With dozens of choices along the quay, I opted, finally, for an outdoor table right on the water--one false step and I wouldn’t need a shower!

It being relatively early (5:00 p.m.), the crowd had yet to arrive (great marketing strategy that every table sported a “reserved” sign). Accordingly, service was excellent and I was soon sipping an Italian Peroni Draft, admiring the view and perusing the menu--with a backdrop of the tasteful blue-and-white table cloths.

The Norwegian smoked salmon starter was generous enough for two. Obviously not from frozen, the bed of salad was crisp but suffered slightly from too much oil.

The Wagyu Lasagna arrived piping hot, well-proportioned if a tad bland. The glass of Pinot Grigio Varese--cool and refreshing--complemented the meal and kept the tongue from burning.

Looking forward to a return visit."
Jshah,"Excellent restaurant, friendly people with delicious food, lovely collection of wines with best location on Boat qay. Hidden Gem of Singapore.must a visit."
Evening meal,"Nicely place nect to the rive good views to finicial district one way Helux bridge the other. Food very good. I had the risotto, with proper porcini mushrooms. Wine list geographically varied, Chile,NZ and of course Italy. Had gluten free spaghetti"
Didn’t disappoint,"When you get to the end of a holiday and have little tolerance for imperfection I would suggest coming here. Food amazing, cold beer, quality wine, great coffee, service was a classy as it gets. Don’t be fooled here - a hidden gem along the river in Boat Quay."
Excellent,"The best pizza in this part of Singapore. Very good Italian base, excellent fresh ingredients and served piping hot. Whenever I stay in a new area I look for the best local pizza place. After trying a number of alternatives Vespetta wins for Clarke Quay/Boat Quay without question."
Overall a very good italien restaurant in Singapore,"nice place at the Riverside in Singapore. Service of the owner was perfect. we felt a Little bit like in Italy. It is a bit narrow all over the place, but all bars/restaurants in this area are like this. ………..."
An On the Spot Italian Meal,"While strolling along Boat Quay when in Singapore recently it was getting close to dinner time so we thought while we were here we would get something to eat. Everyone was approaching us to come and eat at their restaurant, however, we didn't want to be hassled. We soon came across the Vespetta Italian Bar and a lovely man by the name of Francesco said to us very politely did we feel like an Italian meal, however, the space was limited where we wanted to sit away from the smokers. Francesco quickly moved tables and chairs for us and made us very comfortable. He then proceeded to send out a lovely free appetiser free of charge which I thought was very good of him. He made sure everything was ok and that our meals were good. Well they were and so was Francesco who we found out later was the owner / chef / maitre d and a very lovely young man. Thank you Francesco for a great Italian meal with excellent customer service and a friendly smile. When next in Singapore we will be back."
Terrible service,"The food was average. Perhaps it was good, but the terrible service ruined the whole experience for me and my friend.

the service here was absolutely horrible. The wait staff don’t give a crap about how long you have been waiting there. They don’t even bother to apologize for the extreme delay and act like they do a favor by serving us the food. I would steer clear of this service black hole."
The best !!,"I went twice with my boyfriend at Vespetta, we tried tagliatelle with zucchini and prawns and spaghetti alla marinara!!! It was delicious!!!
Tonight we came again and tried pizza of 4 formaggi and vespetta pizza. It was very good except the prosciutto parma (that it was really thick). Michele, the waiter was really nice and polite!!! I reckon this place!!! It has a good tast"
"Italian food ""Mamma Mia""","Fantastic Italian food; friendly staff; felt like the chef was making home-made food! We stumbled upon it by accident, and feel grateful to the accident ;)"
Outstanding,"We stumbled upon Vespetta after finding our reservation at another highly rated pizza restaurant nearby had not been honoured. This was to our benefit as the service and dinner provided by Vespetta was magic. Michaela was very attentive and we felt very welcome. The drinks were great, but the food spectacular. We enjoyed the meat and bread platter followed by a Margherita pizza. My husband thinks the pizza would rival those he has tasted in Italy. Next visit to Singapore, Vespetta in on our list."
True,"Sitting amidst the fuzzy and busy Boat Quai river walk this is a great find. Too many ""street pushers"" trying to get patrons . This place relies on their food quality as they only decoy. Its a two story restaurant but obviously, the terrace is the most popular spot. Right on the river side.Service is impeccable and sincere. We tried the bruschettas made with really fresh tomatoes followed by perhaps the best ever Parmiggiana. Comes in clay pot, oven cooked and is simply delicious. This dish is frequently mistreated at most Italian restaurants but not here. Pure love. And then we went for the Ravioli Porcini e Tartufo which were again terrific. Aroma, quality of products and fantastic execution. I will definitely come back."
Italian hospitality,"In the middle of Thai-Chinese and Corean restaurants, at the BoatQuai in Singapore, you can find a little friendly piece of Puglia/ITALY. The guys running the place are authentic and so is the food and the coffee! When you stomach had enough of Asian food, I suggest you go to the Vespetta Gastro place and have a nice dish of pasta and a beer or red wine.
And, even just for a chat, you’ll be happy to have stopped there. Good job guys, a presto. Thanks for the coffee."
Good Italian dishes,"Great location in Boat Quay with outdoor seating. Italian menu with great selection of pastas, pizza and desserts."
What a great place to relax,"Booked in here with 9 people for drinks and food by the water. Really great night. Started with buckets of Italian beer and excellent starters. Followed by a tour de force of Italian red wines that were excellent, coupled with that well known staple match
- pizzas. The only negative was that we would finish one selection of wine and be told there were no more - and have to move to another after just a few bottles. The positive was that the suggestions we had on the next wines were superb and we were able to taste such a broad selection of great wine.

Food was great, wine was great, service was excellent. Great night out. Thanks!"
Heerlijke pizza,"We spotted this street from The viewpoint of Marina Bay Sands. Walked our way here and got a pizza from Vespetta. Delicious! Really really good. Don’t hesitate, go get yourself a pizza here! Yum!"
Authentic Italian food and great hospitality,"Vespetta is a delightful Italian dining place along Boat Quay. The southern Italian pasta was delicious with rich textures. The steak was perfect. We had a couple of shared starters, we particularly enjoyed the Parma ham and mozzarella cheese. The service was friendly and professional, and welcoming. Definitely a place worth returning to again."
An italian surprise in Singapore,"Along the river in Singapore we found this very authentic southern Italian restaurant serving top food as they would do in Puglia in Italy. We visited the restaurant various times and tried a number of their dishes, all great with good Italian ingredients. The wine list is good and reasonably priced. come before 7 pm. to take advantage of their happy our offers."
Love this pizza and Tiramisu with amazing views!,Italian restaurant in a lovely lacation with Fullerton Hotel and Marina Bay views while boats are sailing in the river.
Nice food and place,"Romantic place for dinner, nice food and service. Someone was smoking at the nearby bar and a bit annoying."
Nice,Nice Italian food in a place full of tourist traps. Quite pleasantly surprised to find the good better than average. We had the calamari which was fresh. Mains were the ravioli (nice n tasty cream base) and the pizza which was of a decent size.
Dash of Puglia at the center of Singapore,"Great time out and, considering we are in Singapore, very close to authentic food. I know ingredients are local and not as tasty as ones you can get at home in Puglia. Very affordable as well, considering you are sitting in the center of Boat quay. Beer and wine prices are lower than nearby places and you are drinking original Italian Peroni beer too!
Staff was great and helpful too. Definitely worth a visit!"
Great little Italian joint at Boat Quay,"A hidden gem. Serves very good food. Offers very affordable set lunch, 2 courses at $20 & 3 courses at $25. Good place for business lunch. Happy hours from 12-7pm."
Dinner,"Brief walk from hotel for dinner. Welcomed to a view of the quay. Drinks ordered and quickly arrived. Shared a starter of burrito and Parma ham which was ample for two. Delicious and good quality. Both chose a lasagne - looked small but deceiving. Again very nice and piping hot! Would recommend- nice views, good service and good food."
Always good Italian food,"Vespetta always delivers gret Italian food, plenty of choices and decent prices. Wine happy hoir delivers as well with several good choices of both white, red and sparkling."
"Good Italian Bites, Nice Terrace Water side albeit Small","Fairly new place that is nestled in between busy other places that are larger, staff does their best to serve you well, the chef often comes out and talks to customers. Bruschetta is well done and Ravioli are good too. Would only recommend for small bites and a nice glass of wine or other beverage. Felt that it is quite civilized even though it looks super casual but for sure a place where you can enjoy quietly. People make the place and unfortunately staff changes too often, however the chef is a constant which is good."
Amazing Italian gastro bar,"Food was all wonderful. I had some cold cut and buffalo mozzarella cheese, steak, pasta and pizza. Every bite was wonderful. Even cannot say which only one was nice or specialty. So authentic and lovely. Definately will come back to try different wine. Made me having amazing dinner"
Frequent guest,"I enjoy this place - simple but very good authentic Italian food. Excellent service - the staff are friendly, attentive and make you feel at home. Good ambience."
Authentic Italian - Recommended,"Authentic Italian food is not complicated. But with quality ingredients and good preparation it is always tasty. Many Italian restaurants put their own spin on classic Italian dishes and end up losing the essential qualities of the original. Not so with Vespetta. The food here is just like you would get in a family run restaurant in Italy. Simple. Authentic. Delicious.
And, as a bonus, you get the wonderful views views over the Singapore River."
Best Spritz in Singapore,"First of all, I am not saying it because I am Italian.
This is the place where you can drink the best Spritz in Singapore.
The location of the place helps to make it a wonderful place where to have an ""Aperitivo"" or drinks after dinner.
I can't say anything about the dinner because I never dining here but I am sure the food will be more than fine."
Aperitif by the singapore river enjoying the sunset,"Was here for a early dinner with friends and enjoyed a really good evening, by the river.. good vibes of teh boat quay nightlife, and nice setting indoor and outdoor.
The Aperol spritz was really good and they have good deal on happy hours for beers.
I had burrata and pizza, and while it was cheaper than the usual city prices, the quality was very good!
nice tiramisu too!"
Drink and dine by the river in the best spot in Boat Quay,"Lovely little Italian restaurant bar, that offer big variety of affordable and tasty italian delicatess, the outdoor seating by the river are really romantic. great of a healthy dinner before starting your drinking night."
Wonderful casual Italian restaurant,"We went there for dinner. The place is small and tables are small too. The ambience is definitely casual and simple. But the food was very good and so was the price. Some restaurants in Boat Quay area usually charge more due to its heavy tourist area. We ordered Rib eye steak, spring chicken with rosemary, spaghetti, quatro
Formaggi pizza, smoke salmon insalatta and a side order of fries. It costs only $220 inclusive of gst and service tax and a bottle of wine, juices and mimosa. Absolutely a great value.
Host (owner?) is an Italian, and very cordial and nice. The food was very good too. We'll be back for sure."
Good service and good food:),"Highly recommended:) good view...and Staffs our nice. We ordered cocktails, raviolli, calamari, spag..and all are amazing.. Vespetta cocktail is must have😊..visit and enjoy yourselves😊"
Amazing authentic food and good cocktails,I was our second visit at vespetta. It's really obvious that is authentic restaurant as the owners been always there. The Aperol spritz taste exactly the same as in Italy (not watery as in other places in Singapore). Deffinettely the place where we will go again l.
Great food great servicd,"Really authentic and delicious Italian food, coupled with lovely service from the staff- who are also Italians. We enjoyed our dinner immensely. Probably one of the best choices along the crowded Quay!"
Amazing dinner,"Happened upon this place while searching for a bite for my birthday dinner. Chef treated me with a plate of homemade gnocchi and a dessert that was just sublime. Couldnt have asked for a better night out for dinner with the wife. The Mojitos were top notch as well. Hopefully, i will have time for a return visit."
Best italian restaurant in Singapore,"It was like to be at home in Italy with very friendly staff ,Michele the chef Francesco very great time , excellent food and ambience ! Well done !!"
Fabulous Italian food!,"Vespetta is conveniently located in Clarke Quay in Singapore. If you get riverside tables, do take them coz it's much nicer to sit by the water and eat :). The margarita pizza is fab, but the truffle pasta is to DIE for! Service is prompt and friendly, and the place has a lovely happening vibe to it. One more thing is that it's vegetarian friendly, which is tough to find in Clarke Quay. Do go for a meal here and you will enjoy!"
Unexpected good Italian food!,"Normally you won't expect ""good"" food on this strip but this new Italian gem was a real find! Attentive stuff( nice view and simple but yet very tasty Italian food, had some Appetizers and will come back to try the pizza!"
"Excellent Food, Attentive Service","Went to this restaurant for dinner on 18 May, Friday. On the menu was pizza with ham and mushrooms. We request for the waiter to replace ham with salami instead. The waiter agreed immediately without even needing to check with the chef. Pizza was tasty. We also had calmari. It is crispy on the outside and the squid is nice and soft in the inside. Excellent food! The waiter came over to check with us regularly whether we need anything else and feedback for the food items."
Real Italian Quality,"This restaurant is an example of authentic Italian gourmet food. I come here often and every time I try something different: all the menu is good and as good as in Italy.
The staff is very kind and efficient. Also the location is perfect, particularly at night.
Strongly recommended."
Authentic Italian - reasonable price for river side on Boat Quay,Really impressed - not many reasonably priced quality Italian restaurants around. Glasses of wine $9.50 at happy hour and $11 non. Meat dishes around $26. Really happy with the food
A good option at Boat Quay,There is so much to choose from at Boat Quay but this place is worth a try if you are overindulged in Asian cuisine. You have the benefit of that lovely waterside position and so if you try hard enough you could even imagine you are transported to Venice! Service is not rushed and the quality was good at a reasonable price
Very nice new Italian!,Visited twice . They have a good set lunch at attractive prices! Food tastes very good! Friendly and quick service! Definitely one of our new places to more frequently come for lunch.
"Great location, excellent pizza and a laidback ambience!","After enjoying Asian food for over a week, it was time for pizza. In the evenings, the Boat Quay is a great location by the water for dinner. We met the owner and Chef of this new restaurant, Francesco, who prepared the great authentic south Italian pizzas for us. We warmly recommend this Gastro Bar!"
Viva Italia,"Besides the great view over the Singapore river, experienced very good Italian food for reasonable prices, And as a Swiss I'm probably hard to please :). I had the day special - chicken grilled with rosemary & hand cut fries served on a nice wooden board. Loved the Day's special price SGD 16.-- (ca. USD 11). Chef threw in a free bruschetta. will definitely come back. Grazie mille!"
