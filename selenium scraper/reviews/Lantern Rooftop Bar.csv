"Strong drinks, great views","Went to Lantern as part of the Club Experience with our staycay at Fullerton Bay Hotel (the staycay itself wasn‚Äôt that great).

The drinks were strong, we had Singapore Sling, Classic Mojito and Negroni.

Service was really great, shout-out to Fairuz who was very attentive and friendly."
"Expensive drinks, great views and loud music","This rooftop bar is located next to the Fullerton Bay Hotel.

I prebooked this venue for drinks and Im glad I did as it was fully booked when I arrived.

Whilst drinks are expensive and the music too loud the view was fantastic.; Views across the water towards Marina Bay Sands.

Drinks must be ordered via the QR code and on the second order drinks didnt arrive so I had to follow this up.

For the views alone a great place to visit."
"Great view but service, drinks, food and music terrible",Service terrible. Food expensive and terrible Music super loud and horrible taste Nothing great in drinks Do not go there you will be disappointed
View & staff kindness,Meal was very poor but Atmosphere was excellent. Plate meal what I was ordered was too salt to eat for us
Cocktail on the rooftop !,Definitely a place to stop just for the view and the music ! Enjoyed cocktail from the rooftop ! We went there with my wife just to chill and nuit a nice evening with a perfect cool weather !
Well made drinks,"We came here around 9 pm on a weeknight with no reservation and were lucky to get a table for drinks. The drinks were very expensive but in line with prices of drinks at other nice restaurants/bars. We thought that the drinks were creative and well made. Our waiter (MK??) was friendly, attentive and helpful. The views were outstanding. And the breeze was lovely!!!"
Great views,"We went for drinks, that are rather expensive. But - what the hekk, having traveled around the globe to come her, we gladly accepted. Really liked the views, despite that fact this is not very elevated."
Girls' Night Out,"We had gone there as a group to celebrate some birthdays. The ambience was nice. Awesome view of the MBS. Food was up to the mark too but unfortunately the waiters were not. My friend was told to help herself to the water when clearly there was service charges included in the bill. The other waiter who served the food was clumsy and had poor concept of space. After being informed that the food was for the person seated at the other end of the table, he still haphazardly left the food on the other end. There was lack of finesse and poor training that didn't quite match up to the place. I would expect better service standards when I'm visiting a hotel."
Wedding anniversary celebration,Wonderful memories for me and my husband and surprise from Alvin was unexpected! Thank you Daniel for the amazing and best hospitality. üëçüëçüëçüëç
Go for the view only,"Visited as guests of the hotel.

On the positive side the setting and view are great and the service was excellent - v friendly and professional.

On the downside the cocktails were not very good, music was terrible and v loud and the food was appalling - we sent back the lobster roll the waitress agreed to remove it from the bill.

If you go I would stick to a beer and just pop by to take a picture - otherwise many better places to try."
Visit early,"Due to the pandemic they are open till 10:30pm, make sure you make it before 10 pm for the last order. Drinks are decent and view is absolutely breathtaking especially if your looking for that Singapore Insta picture with view of marina bay. Menu looked good. Will definitely be back for dinner"
Best before-dinner drink!,"The perfect spot for a before-dinner drink. Definitely will set up your mood, from the time you arrive, a warm welcome from beautiful staff. And great choices of drinks, which is a bit it‚Äôs a bit more expensive than the usual price of a cocktail. But you will get what you paid for - drinking a lovely cocktail with the view of the iconic MBS plus superb service."
Experience,"Lantern üèÆ Bar is one of my favorite Rooftop Bar restaurants, with friendly Staffs, good service, great place to chill out overlooking such a fascinating view of the Marina Bay Sands"
Top the notch,I always love lantern. From the view to the cocktails to food. We were seated in the front sofa thus we get the best seat.
"perfect view, but even better service!","Perfect view. Great drinks, and great food (both for the snacks and mains).

While most other reviews talk about the food, drinks and view, I will be talking about the service.

I was intending to propose, and was looking hard for Singapore bars / restaurants with the BEST views. While bars with breathtaking views are not too difficult to find in Singapore, which would be the perfect one?

I sent emails and called several of these bars / restaurants. From my interactions with the managers, the bar that stood out heads over shoulders all others was Lantern.

From making the reservation, to planning, to offering suggestions on the best spots / times and ideas, Germa from Lantern was extremely helpful.

While I did wish to try the food at some of the other restaurants I considered, Lantern‚Äôs and Germa‚Äôs outstanding service really swayed my decision to choose Lantern as my proposal spot.

The food, drinks and the view were superb. These items, however, can only take you so far. Personally, ""service"" at F&B outlets have never been high up on my agenda. However, the service from Germa and the team elevated my entire gastronomic experience into a night I will not forget.

I will definitely be back."
Marvellous view,Bird eyes and romantic view of the Marina Bay area . Good place to chill in the evening. They are only opened at 5pm to 1030pm. Lobster Taco was great. However choices could have been more. Menu was not extensive enough. But overall a great place to spend the evening at.
Great chill-out place with an awesome ambience & view,We went for a drink after dinner and were given a table with a great view thanks to Ms. Germa. There is a good selection of drinks & some food choices. Our group of 5 has enjoyed the nice cosy atmosphere throughout.
One of the al fresco with best view of the marina bay,"Service is the best. Accommodate special occasion with a little surprise. The view of the Marina Bay is breathtaking. No rush, just enjoy the sunset and watch the marina light up."
Disappointing food,"Third visit ,ordered lobster roll and beef sliders,food was served cold and the truffle fries has no truffle taste. Ordered a bottle of wine served with plastic cups totally spoil the taste and experience. The wine tasted so bad."
No senses of customer recognition,"I was quite disappointed. When we arrived we asked for front row seating and we‚Äôre told that it‚Äôs only for people who buy the current promotion package
Later in the evening the seats were given to random People and there was no package served there. We btw. consumed at lot more at the evening more than a package was worth but were treated with second class row seating.
All front rows were empty when we came! Apparently when they realised that the packages won‚Äôt sell they gave the seats to anybody just not to us.
The couple next to us nibbled the whole evening from one glass of wine and could sit there but we with a bill of few hundred dollars couldn‚Äôt"
Never fails to impress,"Every time I come here I love it! The views and ambiance are stunning, the food good, and the staff excellent."
What a horrible service!,"We decided to pay a last visit to the ‚ÄúLantern ‚Äú yesterday before leaving Singapore with a friend. We wanted to treat ourselves and opted for an expensive Rose Champagne. After being asked to taste the champagne, we both agreed with my friend that something was wrong with the bottle as there was no bubble at all after being poured. We asked for the bottle to be changed and to our surprise, the sommelier refused and showed an arrogance that I have rarely seen in hotels at that level. After arguing for few minutes and threatening to leave, he finally accepted to change to another bottle but ultimately poured the new champagne with the rest of the Rose! So much for being a certified sommelier as he claimed! Food wise, we ordered cheese and charcuterie platter as well as dips and lobster rolls. The bread, nuts and crackers were all soft and did not seem very fresh. Maybe the rainy weather did not help but still, you expect a bit more for the price. The overall experience was really underwhelming and I honestly hope not to be served again by this terrible sommelier."
An anniversary‚Äî ruined,"I won‚Äôt ever forget this night, for the wrong reasons. I had come here to celebrate a special anniversary with a loved one and it has become one of the worst occasions to date. We were served by Jaga, a man who somehow seemed to be adamant to make it a bad experience for us.

Complete unprofessionalism in serving us. He cut me off mid sentence when speaking, was rude and unclear when serving us, and was completely unprofessional when serving- telling us details about lanterns contact with American Express (details that we did not need to know at all, let alone on our anniversary).

Rest of staff was fine, food was so so (overpriced), view was very beautiful. I guess you pay for the view when you come here- nothing more.

I feel sorry to have spent such a special day and had such a bad experience. They changed the food item and gave us a cake slice on the house, but I‚Äôm sure we all know- once a night it ruined nothing can really be done to redeem it."
Not let us in,"Me and my friend book a table as she wanted to celeb her birthday,worse happen the lady receptionist dont let us in as she said we cannot dine in because we are not live at the same house as government policy, we know you can dine in regardless you live or not live together in one house as long just 2 person in the table as we speak of course i bring a friend with me and also my friend brought 1 person with her also so we can dine in separately at the same time. This lady ( short black hair we assumed shes asian a filipino) we can tell because of her accent) receptionist insisted that we cannot dine even we booked already. After 30mins walking to find that restaurant and we just rejected if they have that kind of policy it should put in the booking site so people not be disappointed ."
Birthday dinner,Went to Lantern to celebrate friends birthday and the waiter Loges was really nice and made out of his way to take a nice photo of us and made it into a nice card. Amazing service! Totally recommend to have any celebration here!
You've got to be there,"Really loved the whole atmosphere . This is hands down the best rooftop bar to me, the swimming pool is just cherry on top. The service was also superb, especially from the Filipino asst manager (I think). She was very happy to help us take great pictures for our wedding anniversary and was quick on her feet and fast. The cocktails were also very special, i tried the Chilli drink, but unique lol, props to the bartender. We had the best view in the restaurant facing the MBS. Food is great too, cheers to the whole restaurant team"
Disappointing wasted trip,"Disappointing service and a wasted trip- made reservations for 2 tables and called up beforehand to understand safe distancing measures.

Upon reaching, they denied entry to 1 of our reservations simply because we knew each other, even though we agreed to be seated far apart and abide by safe distancing measures.

What bugs me most is that they should've informed us over the call we made earlier to avoid this wasted trip. In addition, the manager in charge failed to explain the logic behind this strict policy.

Decided not to eat there since they were so unaccomodating. Surprised they were willing to turn away good business."
Dinner at Lantern Fullerton Bay Hotel,Tried food not eaten as an every meal basis. Pleasant experience with great ambience and rooftop city skyline scenery
lantern visit,"place and location gets a 10/10 however with the changing scenario of digital menu and ordering, directly affects the service. It is cumbersome (especially for aging people like us) to navigate our way through the digital platform just to order a simple meal / drink and wish even though the menu is read digitally but ordering can be in person. Must mention service was below expectations and bordering on the 'poor' line. For a future visit.... might give it a skip for a long while."
Night Out,"Great night out. Great view, great service, great bar food, and great ambience. Everyone enjoyed the eveving"
Great views and I guess that‚Äôs what you pay for,Great views of Singapore - looking directly over at Marina Bay Sands but the drinks and snacks were just way overpriced. I guess it‚Äôs expected as it‚Äôs a hotel. Won‚Äôt be back.
Fabulous services,"Wow, this place is fantastic. The services were great too. The lady who recommended us the food and drinks were yummy. We love the ambience and the scenery. Feel so good chillax there. Would definitely go back there."
"Great People, Great Service, Great View","Revisiting Lantern Bar again for special celebration. Special shout-out to Germa whom assisted to reserve a table to us and her team (Charisma, Roy, Loges, Zool & Jag) for the wonderful service and drinks for that evening. Me and my partner really enjoyed the evening.

We will be back again in Aug to stay at Fullerton Bay Hotel. See you all in couple of weeks time!"
"You guys are amazing - Germa, Zool, Charisma, Roy, Loges & Jag","A visit at Lantern bar wouldn‚Äôt be complete without their amazing team (Germa, Zool, Charisma, Roy, Loges & Jag) You will be warmly welcomed with their smiles behind the masks and their joyful conversations make your visit a memorable one. We will be back soon."
Awesome birthday celebration,"Besides the view, the service has been amazing. Anna was attentive and kind. They made my birthday celebration memorable with a complimentary personalised card and birthday cake. We will definitely return for more. The drinks are pretty good and would definitely recommend the Mad About Yuzu. Thank you Anna and the Lantern team."
Found my spot in Phnom Penh,"I came here at PP for a short vacation and my friends invited me to the most sought after rooftop bar in Phnom Penh and I had to go see it for myself. Indeed an incredible place, great service and superb atmosphere."
Good vibes & good food,"The vibe, views & food were all great. We hadn‚Äôt planned on eating here but we‚Äôre so glad we did. Would definitely recommend, even if just for drinks."
Feast on view,"This restaurant is located in open air roof top of the Fullerton Bay Hotel, so you will be treated to an amazing view of the Marina Bay area.
Food here is average. We found the fish and chip dry and duck confit average. The wagyu mini burgers and risotto were nice. So we concluded that this would be a nice place to chill for drinks and view, but not great dining place."
Drinks with friend,The price is certainly not worth the drinks or food. Ordered 2 martinis and 2 Negronis a fries and chicken pop and bill cost $200. Martinis are super tasteless. Negronis are super light. View is nothing compared to many roof top bars. This is just a pool bar. Waiters are constantly busy and have to ask for water twice. Certainly won‚Äôt go back
1st visit,Food is good and waiters are very attentive and see to my every need and checking in on how is the food.
Great service for a special night,"Arranged a special birthday celebration for my wife with friends and the whole Lantern team did a great job, starting with Deo in Guest Relations who handled my reservation. She answered all my questions and accommodated all my (reasonable) requests in terms of table location, coordination with the Fullerton Bay bakery (for the cake) and an external balloon company. On the day the team arranged the balloons nicely and the service was good (thank you Leges (?-sorry if name is not quite right)), although the team was busy with a full house. Drinks and food were good although a bit pricey, as expected. The view was amazing and the night was wonderful. For all that, money well spent. Thank you, Lantern team!"
Wonderful Night!,"Lantern seriously does not disappoint when it comes to the view, service, ambience, food (although options are limited, everything that we ordered was amazing), and drinks.

I must say the best part about the night was the amazing staff. Knowing that we were there to celebrate a birthday, Deo (our hostess for the night) took care of us right from the beginning, and assisted in arranging for the to die for Earl Grey Creme Br√ªl√©e. To top everything off, the staff prepared a personalised handwritten birthday card, with a photo of our group (with the wonderful bay view as the background of course)

I‚Äôm glad we chose Lantern to celebrate the special occasion. Thank you, Deo, Zool, Anna, Loges and Jag, for making our night!"
Amazing Night,"Went to lantern and as always it didn't disappoint! Service from Haizul, alex , germa and the rest is very warm , friendly and on point. Really nice view aswell. Very relaxing evening. Food and of course drinks are super tasty! Will definitely be back here! Love it ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Christmas and Bday drinks,"view is amazing, drinks were great and surprise cake is heartwarming. I've been to lantern once and the recent visit did not disappoint. we had a great chill christmas day drinks."
Wait was too long..,"Came here for the first time with hubby. Ordered Lobster roll, Vegetables Spring Roll, Popcorn chicken, Christmas blossom cocktail, sunset soiree and London Mandarin Orange Zest. Despite being a Tuesday evening, the waiting time was really long, an hour for the first food item to arrive. Sunsequent items took another hour to arrive. Staff was very apologetic and explained that the kitchen was overwhelmed with orders. Lobster roll was a very small portion, and not worth the price ($39). It was nice and tasty though. The experience could have been nicer if not for the long wait. Otherwise with the nice and fantastic view of the Marina Bay Sands skyline, this would have been a romantic and memorable evening."
"Nice view, wide selection of drinks","Lantern has a cosy setting with nice view of the Downtown Core. There is a wide selection of drinks, particularly the cocktail and wine ranges. There are also mocktails and other beverages as non alcoholic options. Will visit again.

Reservation made through Chope was a breeze."
Family dinner,"We planed to see the light show, unfortunately the light show didn‚Äôt happen. But we had a good time at the rooftop bar with great front seats. Perfect view of MBS. The service guy Alex was very friendly, he helped us took family pictures. Good memories!"
Nice place but limited choice of food,"Too little choice of food, I think less than 10items, could have more choices. Other than that everything was good."
Great,"Loved the atmosphere, view & ambience. Food was very good & the Service was excellent. They figured it was our anniversary & offered complimentary cake which I thought was very sweet of them."
Amazing experience!,"Fantastic customer service, great ambience and super friendly staff - Katrina in particular took great care of us and reserved one of the best tables for us :)"
Must Go in Singapore,"Stunning scenery, great drinks and food. A must go if you have family or friends in town. A truly special spot!"
"Great place to have a sip,very quiet during the epidemic time","Great place to have a sip,very very quiet during the epidemic time,basically around 5 tables throughout Friday golden hour:8-11pm.a little sad about the impact and wish it will pass soon"
Really disappointed,"I booked this restaurant 3 weeks in advance ( the maximum you could book it for) for our last night in Singapore for the incredible views of the Marina Bay Sands- which is why I gave this 2* instead of 1*.

We were immediately disappointed when we were shown to our table and it was right at the back with a column directly in our view of the MBS. We were then ignored for 20 minutes- after booking so far in advance I really expected we would have had better views and considering we were there for dinner thought we would have better service.

We spoke to one of the waitresses who apologised and said she would keep an eye out for a better table and in fairness she did manage to get us a much better table and the service was then better- just a shame we had to complain to get this?

The food was extremely expensive considering the size of it, but admittedly it was very tasty.

This is fine for drinks and nibbles before dinner, just don‚Äôt book it as a dinner reservation."
Service at its finest ‚ù§Ô∏è,"Went for night capping at lantern bar, and the service never fail to impress me.. EVERYTIME!! Kudos to ‚ÄúGERMA‚Äù who kept on checking on us if we are okay taken order and recommend the signature drinks and keep on coming back as she‚Äôs like a mind reader I‚Äôm impressed! To ‚ÄúKAT‚Äù who welcomed us joyfully, and to ‚ÄúHANA‚Äù checking off we wanted more drinks."
Good for girls‚Äô night out,"Hung out with my girlfriends for supper.
We ordered a drink each and shared the truffle fries.

The drinks were quite strong - good amount of alcohol in them :)

The food serving was quite small though.

Throughout the night the music was playing and it was nice. The place also offers a nice view of the Marina Bay Sands across the bay. So it was very pretty.

It was quite crowded when we were there and with alcohol the crowd can get pretty rowdy. But still all good."
Beautiful view of Singapore,Great cocktails and amazing views over the bay and at night the light show is spectacular from the high vantage point
Beautiful views,It‚Äôs a great place to hang out for a drink after work as its located in the city centre at the Fullerton Bay Hotel roof top. It has excellent views of MBS across the water and the Melion. They have happy hours till 6pm and the general pricing is not very expensive considering the location. Would recommend making a prior reservation as it does get crowded later in the evening.
"Poor, offhand service at the bar","We were not residents but went for a drink at the Lantern Bar, as we like to do on our first night in Singapore. The members of staff were courteous and helpful right up to the moment we got to the actual bar. The bartender was very keen to tell us what he thought we wanted rather than listen properly. I asked for a classic margarita, he checked as he hadn‚Äôt been listening the first time, then called over to the guy making the cocktails for a mojito. I couldn‚Äôt get his attention so the wrong drink showed up. I said no, I‚Äôd asked for a margarita and for some reason he thought this was very funny and joked with the guy who‚Äôd made the mistake and they laughed among themselves.
I‚Äôm not a very fussy person, but at those prices and in a hotel of such a high standard I do expect an apology, so sorry, I‚Äôll make you another one straight away, rather than the casual unprofessional attitude we were confronted with. It was really annoying. Of course mistakes can be made, but listen to your guests and apologise if you get it wrong! We will find somewhere else next time. A shame, as the views are so fabulous."
Excellent service! Beautiful views!,"Excellent service! Beautiful bar to chill with fantastic views! Amy, Ivy & Germa were very accomodating, friendly & overall they presented themselves very well! Menu prices were affordable & it was a such a relaxing place to hang out with friends. Thank you!"
Amazing spot,"What a gorgeous hotel and in a fantastic location, very central and with fab views to MBS. We called by during Happy Hour for cocktails in Lantern Rooftop Bar where locals, hotel guests and visitors all enjoyed relaxing, enjoying the atmosphere and views. Highly recommend and would love to return."
Beautiful views,Loved this bar. Amazing views of the marina bay. Good to watch the light show. The cocktail menu had a great selection.
Simply breathtaking view with,"Simply breathtaking view with great service! Ordered Gins and Tonic with Monkey 47 gin, then ros√© wine - all excellent. The snacks kept coming (free). No pressure sales, we stayed there for a few hours. Love this place. Highly recommended for a very cool place with a great view and vibe for drinks and food."
Amazing Bar with view,We went to the LANTERN rooftop bar. what an amazing location facing the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The weather was perfect and we had a great time with awesome drinks. The service was excellent and the price reasonable. They also have a Happy Hour.
What a view,"We took a chance and dropped by here for the late laser show over the bay and were really lucky to find a vacant table with a fantastic view. Great drinks, quick service in a small and quaint bar on top of the fullerton. Its not the easiest place to find so don't be afraid to ask for help. The only negative I had was there is a smoking area at the top that blows straight into the non smoking areas."
Magic View and great party for NYE,"We attended the Lantern Bar's NYE (2019/2020) party and it was phenomenal! It was expensive for just finger food, but the position for the fireworks was unbeatable."
Awesome view,"The food is decent but expensive. We went during Xmas eve and managed to catch the firework from Gardens by the Bay. If you are going for the fireworks, definitely worth it!"
Amazing view and good drinks.,"Amazing view and good drinks.
But the food was terrible. The sliders were cold and the fries were stale. The food was expensive compared to the quality."
WOW,It is my first visit to this amazing place. It is just WOW! Food was really good and service was amazing as well. You can enjoy fantastic views!
Farewell Party Swiss guests ‚Äû outstanding‚Äú,"We finished our great Australia VIP tour in Singapore on the Lantern Bar terrace. The Fulerton Bay manager and his nice waiters made our farewell to a unforgettable experience. I would love to thank everyone for this great evening,
Especially Mr Kalal who was very helpful and accomodating."
Bar dining at Lantern,"Perfect spot for a good view! Good service and the place is stunning. Had a perfect date with my girlfriend, thanks for the cake!"
Birthday bust,"Reserved a table for 8 with notes that we'd be celebrating my hubby's birthday as the reason for the celebration. They replied quickly, even saying they'd arrange with management for a complimentary slice of cake and candle for my hubby. The first impression was promising. The table they gave us what great, but that was about all that was great that night. We ordered the cheese platter, truffle fries and tortilla chips with guacamole as finger food, and ordered 2 drinks each. The cheese was old and very dry, the crackers were stale, the tortilla chips were also stale, the guacamole didn't taste Mike anything at all. I arranged for a bottle of champagne to be brought out at 10 mins to 12mn to toast my hubby's birthday, and we only got the bubbly 7 mins past midnight after several follow ups (totally defeating the purpose of arranging this bottle an hour in advance to toast at exactly midnight). They also apparently forgot that there was supposed to be complimentary cake. If you have an important milestone to celebrate, DO NOT CELEBRATE HERE. The service will disappoint you and as you are paying top dollar, you shouldn't be getting this low level service. Take your business elsewhere. It's clear they don't think they need to make an effort for people as there will always be someone bringing their guests here. Don't fall for this tourist trap!!!"
Wonderful position,"Having just a few hours in Singapore we felt that this bar was an essential place to visit. Really wonderful position looking onto the Marina sands hotel.
Yes cocktails are expensive a d the staff need some lessons in service but with this view I can forgive a few negatives."
Great view and nice swimming pool,"The Lantern is located at the Rooftop of the Fullerton bay Hotel. It has a great swimming pool and beautiful view in town. Went there to start the night and have a few drinks with friends (cocktail and glass of champagne). Prices are high but you pay for the view. Service is good. Nice choices of cocktail.
Great place to start the evening or for business meetings. Highly recommended."
Beautiful view and great roof top bar,"I was there with four other friends and we had dinner and drinks. Great service, good foods, drinks and music! Very beautiful view and we were there at 7:30pm, watched the daily light show across from Marina Sands started at 8pm, it was so fantastic! It's a great place to go if you're looking for a rooftop bar!"
Really disappointed with service this time,"Very slow service - completely under staffed. One waiter for about 30 people. Not his fault; management failed to anticipate. Cocktails were highly watered down and expensive. Ordered two snacks, with the fries taking 30 minutes to arrive; and quite separate from the other snack. Waited a further 20 minutes for drink service before having to approach the bar myself. GREAT CALLOUT to the barman who acknowledged how bad the service had been and offered two wines free of charge. Really poor support of the staff on this occasion..really disappointed LANTERN...really."
Amazing views and great cocktails,"We were not residents of the hotel, but we wanted a special pre-meal drink in an iconic rooftop bar at the Fullerton and we were not disappointed. Its not signposted per se as the restaurant is, but the staff will guide you once you come out of the elevator. We didn't have a table booked, but the barman made room for us and we had a Singapore Sling over looking MBS and the financial district, just a fantastic view. Service was exceptional and I would highly recommend coming here for a drink."
Love the place,"An amazing bar with nice views. Cozy interior, amazing atmosphere, simple and understated. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable. A great great place to spend the evening."
A nice bar,Great atmosphere. Low level but also has a nice view. Drinks are good. I'd recommended a Singapore Sling which I had one and it tasted good & because you're in Singapore! lol
Amazing,Amazing 70th Birthday stay ! with personal attentions in the Fullerton Bay Hotel. Staff of hotel and Lantern Rooftop Bar are top !
Honeymoon dinner,We had the most beautiful night in Singapore and the restaurant and staff were so nice and kind. The views from the bar are also stunning and we both had an amazing dinner and night.
Relaxing and beautiful experience,"Relaxing and beautiful experience in the pool during the day and night. Stunning views. Clean, pretty gardens and enjoyable background music. Opportunity for privacy. Will return."
Fantastic Views,"We selected Lantern for an adults only late afternoon / early evening get together. We booked a table in advance and were a bit shocked at the $400 minimum spend which was paid for to reserve our table.

However, drinks and food for four in a great Singapore location was always going to cost this amount (and much more) so we went ahead and were not disapointed.

Cocktails during happy hour were good prices for Singapore and the plates of food we ordered to share excellent. Our seats gave us a great view without the extreme height of other well known options - perfect for those who have a fear of heights! We were lucky enough to watch a military fly by and had great views of the early evening fireworks.

Unfortunately as Lantern is in the pool area drinks are served in plastic which is a shame, but unavoidable.

The service was excellent and this was certainly a great one off experience during our 12 day stay in Singapore. Our bill well exceeded the $400 minimum spend, but it wasn't unexpected. Just do your research if on a tight budget!"
Spectacular night view by the bay!,"Visited Lantern on a Friday evening and we were glad to be allocated the front view table. The day view is nice but it gets cooler as the night falls with their great drinks (love their Berry Mojito) and building lights. It's also breezy but not too windy as compared to taller rooftop bars. We got to see the laser light show at MBS from another point of view at Lantern, which is very lovely (8pm). There are some mains and sides available for order. All in all an enjoyable night."
Horrible service,"My wife and family from korea went there today. Wanted good view seating. Initially told to sit somehwere first and once the good view area is vacant, will shift to the table.
After awhile there was empty table to shift. Requested to shift but the waiter said the group that left the table went to see laser show and will be back. But they didnt. Next they invited a new couple who went in later than us to the table. Then why lie in the first place? All the staffs there were rude to us. Just because not singaporean. Think we are pushovers? The attitude of the staffs were so bad. Lastly she said not happy can go to my supervisor. Wow what kind of attitude is this for service line?

Nobody was paying attention to us throughout our stay here. Even when we wanted to pay, we went to the counter to make payment and 1 of the staff thought we dont want to pay? Say must pay at table? Scared we just run away. After informing him then he felt awkward and walked away with a sarcastic smile

So much stereotyping to foreigners at this place. Last time my wife went and loved the place that was why she brought her family from overseas there. However the service and attitude today was totally terrible! and disrespectful!

For tourists. Highly recommend not to visit this place unless you want to be treated without respect and to experience the lousy service to foreigners. Seems that the staffs or management service level has downgraded too much to be worth your visit"
"Great Service, even when packed!","We visited on a night when Fullerton Bay Hotel was hosting two separate events- including one at Lantern Bar. Even without a reservation, the hostess was super friendly to our group and helped us to get a table with only a short wait. We really appreciated the effort and enjoyed our drinks & small bites while taking in the view!"
Fantastic drinks and food with a location and view to go with it.,"We found the Lantern after reading reviews, we made the booking for 6:15pm. we found the service to very polite, the drinks and food were great and the view just leaves appreciating the luck you had in choosing to attend this venue."
Great place for a nightcap,"We booked a table at this rooftop bar for every night of our holiday ( and its a very lovely hotel to stay in), perfect way to round off an evening. Some good cocktails. Wine comes in plastic ‚Äúglasses‚Äù unfortunately but aside from that, all good. Service can be hit and miss.
But its the view you‚Äôre here for, and it is fantastic. The lift doors open onto a glorious vista of illuminated pool and flowers and plants and lights reflected in the water, it is the best."
Stunning views.,Beautiful views. Staff were lovely. We got a table late on a Friday evening. Singapore sling was brilliant. You will not get better views in Singapore.
Happy Hour Gin n Tonic - fabulous view!,"I was walking along the river / shore from Clarke Quay and was wilting in the heat; the path took me to the door of the Fullerton Bay Hotel, and I saw a sign for the Lantern Bar and took the lift up. When the doors opened, there was the most lovely view - across the rooftop pool, through the bar, is the Marina Bay Sands Hotel - a really excellent view of it. I had a lovely ice cold Gin and Tonic - it was delicious and refreshing - and what a view to enjoy whilst drinking it! I would love to stay in one of the rooms beneath the Lantern - what superb views and facilities. Next time if I get to Sinapore again, this will be my #1 choice to stay!"
Superb!,"We came here whilst on honeymoon and the staff were wonderful. Germa, our waitress was wonderful and really looked after us - thanks so much! The food was lovely, and the cocktails were great. It‚Äôs expensive, but the views of the bay make it completely worthwhile."
Utter disappointment from start to finish,"Having stayed at the Fullerton a few years ago, I was looking forward to eating out at the Lantern bar tonight. I went on line, and on the page clearly marked ‚ÄòDining‚Äô I booked a table for 5.

On arrival we were shown to a sofa with a low table. I asked for a dining table and 5 adults were seated round a tiny circular bar table. Eventually the table next to us came free and we had two tiny circular tables pushed together.

Food was also so very disappointing. I order the rack of lamb and got 3 small lamb cutlets which yielded 6 small mouthfuls of meat for the bargain price of $66 + taxes and service charge. Nothing else. No vegetables or potatoes so I had to pay extra for a side of fries - utterly outrageous and in now way should this claim to be a main course.

Then after our meal we sat for 20mins watching staff gather round the bar whilst we had empty glasses. Eventually we decided enough was enough and returned to our hotel for better cocktails and service for two-thirds of the price.

On the plus side the venue is beautiful and affords a great view of the MBS light show. But so do many other places, so don‚Äôt waste your time, your money or your appetite here."
Ultimate indulgence chill with light show.,"Having recently relocated to SIngapore, i was trying to get my wife to stop work for a little while and to enjoy Singapore our new home. We had booked the Lanterns on a number of dates, but had to keep moving the date due to work reasons. When we finally made it, is was worth the wait. Sitting on top of teh Fullerton Bay Hotel, this open air bar and lounge is a fantastic place to chill, have a cocktail or two and just enjoy the view over Marina Bay and the nightly light show. The customer srvice is good and they treat you well. Yes, it is a little bit expensive to do every week, but once in a while, to enjoy the fruits of your hard work is ideal. Highly recommend it to everyone"
Anniversary Visit,"Lota was our waiter , she was great . She was very hospitable and we got a complementary cake also . Excellent place for couple evening ."
Date Night,Awesome night view of the Marina Bay area. Cosy ambience at the sofa. Customer service could be improved.
Great place for a view of the light show...,"Situated in top of one of the many Fullerton establishments on the Marina front in Singapore, Lantern is a very cool venue with an amazing view of Marina Bay Sands and with it the light show which takes place on the water at 8pm and 9pm every night.

The lift opens out to a swimming pool
And the view and the tables are situated on three sides around the pool.

We ordered a beer and a gin cocktail, served with two types of complimentary nuts, and sat back and waited for the light and laser show.

A hyper cool bar and restaurant."
"Stunning, Spectacular waterfront","Lantern stunning rooftop bar at Fullerton Bay Hotel, waterfront, panoramic amidst skyscrapers on the one side, seating relaxed, to die-for pool with in-the-water sunloungers - spectacular views over Marina Bay, boats and cityscapes. Stylish trendy bar, like burnished-steel overlapping armadillo- scales ‚Äì very chic. Music & Light show in the evening each night at Marina Bay Sands, at Marina Bay, across the water; check the show times. I have gait/walking challenges (stroke), all sightseeing has to be well-researched and not overly taxing; I wear a legbrace. Watched the light show from Lantern, wines, beers, cocktails or two (Singapore sling, Mojito...); two birds with one stone ‚Äì great vibe, chilled upmarket ambience, will definitely come again."
Amazing View,It is always a pleasure to enjoy a nice cold drink overseeing the magnificent Marina Bay rom the comfort of a comfortable sofa by the edge of the water.
Birthday Gathering @ Lantern,Fabulous Service. It is our 2nd time to this restaurant and enjoyed our time there! great and very hardworking team!
"Great views with a lovely rooftop set-up, but all this with a steep Price tag!","If you aren't keen on entries or the main course, just a digger for posh crowd, a lovely evening with fine drinks and great views of Singapore, this is a 'must drink here' kinda place.

I would sure love to visit again, but with a little more added to the menu when it comes to food."
Great view,The lantern rooftop bar has fantastic Views of marina bay and has a calmness about it when having cocktails. The service is very slow and as with most well known bars in Singapore the drinks are expensive $54-¬£30 for 2 drinks
