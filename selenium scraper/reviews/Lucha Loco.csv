Best serve from George the waiter! Someone that cares about the service and the customer!,Best serve from George l. What a great food and the serve was simply outstanding! Cozy place and a place to come!
Close to authentic to mexican/american food,Busy place with excellent food and friendly staff. Good selection of beers. Outside seating is preferred.
Great food and service!,"Thank you to the lovely staff and Aisyah the hostess. Wonderful service! Food and drinks were good too.

Had the chicken quesadilla and it was perfect paired with the frozen margarita. Staff were always attentive."
Yummy Mexican Food,"We had the chicken chimichanga and fish tacos with corn chips as sides. Food was yummy, even though a little pricey. Really enjoyed the nice ambiance!"
"Excellent Food, Average Service","The food here was delicious and service was average. We tasted the menu and recommend the elotes, pumpkin enchiladas, churros, and a glass of the sauvignon blanc. Personally, we’d pass on ordering the mixta salad and guacamole in the future."
Amazing Evening,"Great atmosphere, good food, super drinks and fantastic service. Ask for George Chacko get him to recommend the dishes and then just relax and enjoy the evening."
Sad burrito,"Ordered fried buttermilk chicken burrito and it was one of the worst burritos I’ve ever had. Chicken was dry and not crispy at all, no hint of serrano Mayo and a very bitter-tasting and soggy greens was used inside. Barely any hint of cheese. It is a sad tribute to the cuisine. I knew it’s going to be an unusual burrito (no beans, rice) but yet this seemed too skimpy for one and a real challenge to consume. Only saving grace was an attentive waitress who saw my agony and asked if the meal was alright."
"Tasty food, great service and great drinks, what more do you want?","Food was excellent, wide ranges of choices and all very tasty. Got recommendations from George throughout (who was excellent), and each one was better than the next. Highly recommend Lucha Loco for those looking for a fun atmosphere, with good drinks and tasty food. Highly recommend the Waygu & Crab tostados!!"
Yummy!,"the lamb taco was so good, it is a must get. The staff were very friendly too! Will definitely go back again"
Excellent food & service,I’ve chosen Lucha Luco many times for catch up meetings & treats to various groups of friends & colleagues and each time the standards have been maintained with absolutely yummy food and awesome service and totally chill atmosphere.
Overall a good experience!,"Had a very pleasant dinner at Lucia Loco. We had good food, ambience was great and the service was good. Unfortunately, we felt a bit rush towards the end, mainly because of the 90mins dine in duration. Overall had a good time"
Love Taco Tuesday at Lucha Loco Duxton Hill,Taco Tuesday in the garden patio was lovely. Such great service from staff and delicious food. Will definitely be back soon.
Great first visit,"Drinks - Ample of choices however happy hour prices are pretty poor compared to a lot of places , margaritas were 6/10 . Quite a selection of choices

Meals - Did not order but plenty choices ( vegans, v vegetarian, GF)
from appetizers to main courses.

Ambience - 9/10 Romantic and cosy. Lack the one star for cleanliness wise."
Great service...,"It was a packed Friday evening but the service crew were superb ... attentive, friendly, food drinks came fast... one of best service have had at a casual joint in Spore.."
Poor service and value,My wife booked this restaurant for my birthday. There were 5 of us. The service was terrible - more waitresses and waiters than diners and they were all on their mobile phones. The food was terrible - small portions and what tasted like microwave food. Total will of over $220. We left feeling very disappointed. So many better Mexican restaurants that offer much better value.
Cheeky lunch,Lunch with work colleagues. The service was spot on. The waitress and waiters ensured us we were always had our water glasses topped up. We ordered the Duo lunch. Came with two tacos each which are amazing especially the Baja (a bit spicy). Also soft drink and corn on the cob. This is upmarket Mexico that shows off the quality of good Mexican food. The outside seating area is fabulous but can get a bit hot. Would recommend eating in the evening for cocktails and tacos.
Disappointing.,"Food was decent and fast.
Ambience was good.
Beverage was a total disappointment.
Bill of $330 for 4pax reasonable if beverage was better."
will surely make a reservation on my next visit,"After long meeting in Tg Pagar, I decided to end the night with the crew at one of the watering holes in Duxton. We settled for thisnlittle known establishment called Lucha Loco. It was kinda packed and we were made to understand that most customers had made prior reservations. We wanted to sit outside but was told they were fully booked. As we were about to leave, the greeter approached and offered a table near the entrance that could accommodate us. By the time we settled in, it was past 7pm and happy hour had ended. The sweet greeter named Noren accommodated our request for our order to be charged at the happy hour price. I ordered the set menu and she once again accommodated my request to remove the coriander. Love the service and environment but wish there were less pricey options. Will surely return when in the area again.Thank you Lucha Loco especially More for making our day."
Great Atmosphere for a Night Out... BUT....,"Lucho Loco has one of the best patios I've seen in Singapore. Plenty of vibrant air and a decent variety of music. On the weekends they even have a live DJ (love the T-Rex video in the back!). The food is good and the variety of Margaritas are tasty.

BUT... The only downside is that I find it to be a bit overpriced and the customer service didn't really help. When I ordered the ""taco(s)"" I assumed it would come with maybe 2, but it only came with 1... and at over $10 for a taco, I struggle to justify the price. I have found others that are just as good around Singapore, for a more reasonable price. In addition to that, the customer service is a little disorganised (I've been here 3x and it hasn't changed). Sometimes there will be more than one person trying to help us, or we'll be forgotten hidden on the side waiting... Like when I was waiting for my card for 20 minutes trying to pay."
Was there on the valentines,"Was there on the valentines night with my wife and another couple of our friends. While I feel that the food has lost the edge compared to 2~3 years ago, we still enjoyed most of the tacos and the drinks.

We did however had to wait for 45 minutes before I finally got my credit card back. We asked the waiting staff for our card four times while we waited. All four times we were told that the card is being processed by the bar counter. It turns out that non of them bothered to check on our bill until I asked for the fifth time. I was then told to proceed to the bar counter to process the payment. I understand that there was an event going on and they were possibly short on staff. But am I asking too much to expect a waiting staff to walk over to the bar for one minute and ask for our bill? I waited thinking oh maybe they are all busy and I actually felt bad everytime I had to ask them for our bill. But I did see a few of them idling around with apparently nothing to do. One of them was even embracing and kissing her boyfriend who was apparently visiting her at work (nothing wrong with that mind you. I think it’s sweet of him to have dropped by her to say hi on valentines night. What I’m trying to say is that the waiting staff had resources at the time to attend to their customers) The indifference of the waiting staff, their refusal to carry out a simple request from a customer, insincere non-apology-gesture the counter staff gave me left a bitter taste in my mouth as we left the place. It’s very sad to see the standard of service drop so much after all these years. Maybe it’s time to look for some other joint for Mexican food."
Best Known Mexican Restaurant in Duxton,"You can’t give them a miss if you are a big fan of Mexican food, beer or the tequila.

Get warmed up with Crispy Corn Chips and Guacamole with a Tequila Sunrise or Sol/ Corona Beer, followed by some Taco (try the beef or chicken), I bet you, you ain’t stopping with one taco for sure.

The best Mexican restaurant around, I have taken most of my friends (both local and overseas), and they definitely loved it."
Terrible experience,"Visited lucha loco for some dinner and drinks with a few friends after work and the waiter who was taking our orders had his nose flowing and looked dazed. As he was serving our drinks his nose was still flowing and he kept sniffing into a tissue at the area where I assume the plates and cups were kept.

Being concerned with the viruses going around now, I decided to ask him if he was alright and why is he still serving the table with a flu. He replied that the restaurant didn't have enough staff and he's a full time staff so he had to clock in his X number of hours per week.

Is that what our service line has become in Singapore? When someone is sick, they have to work their hours WITH FOOD AND DRINKS just because the restaurant has not enough staff?"
Great tasting food in a cool location but sadly lacks attentive service,"We had booked a large table for a double birthday celebration. There was no welcome, explanation of the menu or help given whilst ordering for a larger party. There was one sweet lady Noreen who was overwhelmed being the only person serving on a busy lunchtime service. She did a great job with no support. Thankfully the food was delicious and the corn a huge hit! The chefs are doing a great job sending out unique Mexican flavours in the food.... but are being let down by the front of house. We left before dessert,,, we gave up asking for more items. Our bill would have been double if we would have had an attentive manager checking in on our group... more drinks/food/coffee/desserts. This restaurant has potential to elevate itself based on the food alone. A lost business opportunity."
Worst Mexican. PLEASE DONT. They have nothing that is close to Mexican. Unwanted food. Just a hype,Worst Mexican. PLEASE DONT COME just a Hype. Nothing more. Food is indigestible. Don’t have words to comment.
Alright,"Decent drinks and mexican food. Casual environment. Given that it's Duxton Hill, expect prices to be a little higher. In exchange, you get a nice ambience. Service was professional. Not a bad place to relax on a friday night."
Great location and good tacos,"Lucho Loco is the perfect spot to hang out, eat some nachos, some tacos and drink some margaritas with friends. Given it's location expect it to be pretty busy Thurs-Sat as everyone descends for after work drinks and dinner at the weekends. I've been a few times and i've now been for a birthday party where they put together a pinata which was great fun!
Food is good although the tacos can be pretty small but if you're there with a group order plenty and share!

I highly recommend their version of a negroni with the cinnamon cigar - it's so good. Give me one of them and a bowl of their pineapple salsa and chips and i'd be happy!"
Expensive but good for spicy food lovers,"Cute Mexican place with nice garden seating. Waitstaff not very friendly or helpful. Two of us asked for no chili and food was still extremely spicy (we accept that it can be hard to remove chilli from premade meals but staff could have at least told us instead of agreeing and then disregarding the request). Food itself was good quality and tasty. Margaritas were great. Portions were very small and very expensive. For 3 people, with very small meals and 4 drinks in total was AUD $165."
Delicious Mexican in Singapore,"Loved this place! Tasty, fun, good atmosphere and a break from the usual. Staff was friendly. Very relaxed, very lively place with affordable delicious authentic tasting Mexican food.
Nice garden seating, though we were in the inside since our reservation started early and it was still hot out."
Lunch,"Enjoyed almost everything about this restaurant. Great ambiance & service, and most food items we had were very tasty. My least fav was the lamb burrito as it had way too much quinoa & not enough of the pulled lamb.
The grilled corn & fish tacos, were very good. The Roasted beetroot salad was different & divine!!"
Quesadilla was amazing,"Their beef quesadilla was out of this world. Really really enjoyed it!!! Shared a jug of sangria with my pals too, it was such a great night!"
Mexican paradise in singapore,"Having eaten a lot of great Mexican food in the 5 years I lived in the US, I was apprehensive of what I would find here. But having gotten great recommendations from some locals I decided to give it a try.

Definitely make reservations before you go as it was completely packed the day we went. Thankfully we had reservations and we considering the weather was really nice we took one of the tables outside.

Service was exceptional. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and patient to explain the dishes. My parents have never had Mexican food and she was explaining the dishes to them very well.

Now to the main topic, food! It was amazing and tasted really well. We tried the corn, some small starters, tacos and quesadillas. All of them tasted really good and portion sizes were good too.

Definitely a great place to visit, good food, good service and good value for money. Must visit!"
Delicious Food - relaxed atmosphere,"Visited Duxton Hill after a local friend recommended. How annoyed am I that I have stayed just 500m away from this area for years and never been here! We chose Lucha Loco primarily because it was the first place we walked past and has a great open garden at the back. It's easy to forget you are in SGP sitting here. We ordered Magaritas and a few small plates, including Tacos, Calamari and chicken wings. The chicken wings are VERY spicy, but delicious. I would describe the service as relaxed, rather than slow - it;s the kind of place you should kick back and chill."
Service with Attitude,"Went to LL for drinks after dinner with a group of friends. We were sitting outside and received such bad service from the staff. Service came with real attitude making you feel like they were doing you a favour by serving you such expensive drinks. Had to ask 3 times for ice cubes and table water. Then received the bill which cake well before our last round of drinks.
It is unfortunate that places like this still exist with such bad service. My wife works in the F&B industry so I know the difficulties but she always has a smile. If you don’t want to work in the industry then get out!! Up your game LL..."
Never go back again,"We used to patronize this place A lot. After a good 6 mths, we returned as we were in the neighbourhood. Only to leave with huge disappointment and decided we will never go back anymore.

The signature dishes (grilled octopus) was removed form the menu and more deep fried options. We ordered a calamari and it was awful - tasteless and full of flour.
The other dishes the same, standard has dropped significantly. So were the drinks!

The only saving grace is the polite waitress who helped us cancelled one of our orders (after we tried what was served, we decided to go to other places for 2nd dinner)"
OH MY GARDEN! After work perfect authentic Mexican foods and drinks,"Best is the outdoor seating and lush greenery along with the casual seating and ambiance. I love the tacos there, particularly the fish taco is great! And the drinks... on Fridays a must have margarita..."
"Great Mexican, brilliant service","Stopped by on a wander around lovely Duxton Hill. Got a table at the front door and did a bit of people watching. Cannot say enough good things about the main guy offering friendly and fun chat and great service. Everyone was lovely but I’d go back just to see him again and enjoy his banter. You’ll know him when you meet him suffice to say. Apart from that, the chicken wings are worth travelling for and the Tommy’s were fantastic which is all we had before wandering off again. They also do tasting paddles of Mezcal and Tequila which are worth checking out. I may have tried one of them too."
Good products and cuisine but not what I was expecting,"Just passing in Singapore, I wanted to eat as many different types of cuisine I could and I love mexican food !
I was a bit disappointed upon reading the menu, which was not offering the traditionnal fajitas, enchiladas... but that's on me, I should've done more reasearch before coming.
I then ordered tacos... and got exactly one small tacos, for what I consider to be a hefty price ! Albeit, it cas very very good and the products appear fresh.
However, the churros in dessert were big enough and the sauces (jam and chocolate) were truly tasty and amazing.
The service was really fast and the outdoor area is very nice.

To sum up : if you are looking for ""basic"" mexican food without too much decorum, this is not really the place, it is a little to trendy and the prices are too high for the size of the portions (at least for the tacos).
But if you are not looking for that and not on a budget, this is a nice place !"
Good for an evening with friends or colleagues,"We went there with a group of 10 which the restaurant can easily cater for in their outdoor area. It’s a very casual atmosphere which we enjoyed. The staff was very attentive and friendly. Food was average, nothing special. It didn’t matter to us that much as atmosphere and service were very pleasant. Great for after work drinks and some snacks."
Worth a visit :),Great food Great service Great atmosphere Ticks all the boxes if you’re looking for a bit of a buzz. Well worth a visit.
Terrible service!!!!,"We dined here on Saturday 16th Feb in the early evening and sat out the front.

We ordered chips, guacamole, corn and three types of tacos.

The guacamole was lovely and so were two of the tacos. Especially the lamb!! However the third taco (the beef cheek) arrived cold. The meat was cold and chewy in the middle.

We politely asked our waitress to send the taco back and explained it was cold. She said nothing and just took the plate away.

About 10 minutes later I asked another waiter where the taco was, having eaten our other dishes, he assured us it was en route. However, it still wasn’t with us another 10 minutes later.

During this time we watched multiple new arrival tables around us get their meals when were still waiting for our order to be fulfilled!

We asked the waitress what was going on and she said it was on its way. We said we no longer wanted the dish as it was an unreasonable time to wait!! She replied with “well the garnish was cold so that was why you thought it was cold”! I was absolutely shocked - such a barefaced lieI I would not send food back unless it was actually inedible.

Ultimately if a customer is not happy with the food they should be treated with respect when discussing this with the restaurants staff. They should not be spoken down to and accused of lying about the temperature of the food they received.

As a result another waiter came over to help resolve the matter and apologised by removing the taco and guacamole from our bill.

In summary - absolutely horrific service. I will not be returning to a restaurant where staff do not respect their patrons and accuse them of lying to wriggle out of a tricky situation."
Friday night dinner,Best service in Singapore. Great food and great margaritas. Atmosphere is nice and friendly. We will be back !
Table plan fail but good food therefore the Average rating,"We are a party of 6 and made a booking in advance for dinner. We were greeted by the staff warmly and was impressed with the alfresco area at Duxton. Only to be greatly disappointed with the table that was reserved for us - it is made up of a bench and 2 seats with the staff INSISTING that it is meant for up to 7! We could not believe it and even told her to look at other table configuration who clearly only sits 4 pax. Still they are not keen to change our seating (in our group we have 4 men who are 1.78m and above). In the end, we had to combine 2 tables in the middle area and it already created a bad impression. Their saving grace is the service that was prompt and delicious food. I would still go back again and be clear when reserving seats."
Best Mexican food I’ve had in Singapore!,"First time ever at this Mexican restaurant and I must say I’m impressed. The vibes are decidedly charming, right down to the cactus hedges to make you feel like you’re in Mexico.

The servers are warm and friendly and our birthday celebration came complete with Mexican music-infused Happy Birthday song and a rainbow-coloured sombrero hat for the birthday girl.

The margaritas here are really tasty and flavourful and I particularly liked the pineapple margarita. The stout that they do in-house tasted somewhat salty and weird though.

All the dishes we ordered were good, especially the tacos. I highly recommend the fish taco."
Beautiful night of Mexican delight,"Discovered this gem on a recent trip to Singapore, great atmosphere and service made our evening really special. Amazing drinks and excellent menu. A must try for any trip to Singapore."
An is the Best!,"We are at Lucha Loco’s tonight as part of a large hen party. An was our server and could not have been happier or more helpful - all our needs were attended to with good humour and efficiency, and we all had a great time. The food and drinks were great but it was the service that made it - thank you!"
Great Mexican food,"Part of the same group that owns Super Loco, and the food quality is consistent with the other restaurants of the group. It has the capacity to serve large groups and can offer set menus, which is very convenient in a group. Great drinks and good ambience both inside and outside."
Great margarita!,"We happened by this restaurant & were seated at the bar without a reservation. The margaritas were excellent. We enjoyed the ceviche and jicama salad and of, course, the guacamole that you season yourself with the condiments provided. Would definitely go back..."
A Hidden Gem!,"I visited this place on a ""surprise date"" with my husband. I had no clue about this hidden gem in Singapore!
When we reached the area, I thought it would be another indoor food-bar kind of a place. But I was impressed with the outdoor deco and the seating area.

The place is nice and the staff is friendly.
You can go by their recommendation to choose the drink or food.
I was not sure to order from the varieties of cocktail they have. The lady suggested some nice ones and that surpassed my expectations.
The food is good too!

Overall it was a good experience with a nice ambience, good food and great drinks!"
Very good,Very good food and drinks. Love the ambiance. A go to place to catch up with friends. I would definitely recommend to friends and relatives.
Overrated,"The place is nice if you manage to get a place outside even tough the table space is quite small. The food is average: small quantities for expensive price! To me, it's not worth it but the service is excellent"
Mexican offering in Duxton Hill,"Was invited for dinner here on 09 Aug by one of my customers during a visit to Singapore. We enjoyed several cocktails and tacos and everything was delicious, especially the margaritas, tacos and carne asada. Service very efficient. The outdoor garden is very appealing with an buzzing weekend ambiance. Would definitely recommend if you are craving Mexican food or looking for a fun place to enjoy with friends or a classy date venue"
Excellent Ambiance and Food,"this place offers a very good ambiance to enjoy your evening. Great cocktails and they offer small portions in their different dishes so that you can try variety over there which is stomach friendly but not pocket friendly. But yea I liked the drinks and food here and good atmosphere was adding more charm in the evening !!

please reserve your table before you go and ask for outside sitting it's more fun to sit outdoors :)"
Great for weekend and outings with friends,"The tacos were good, great crowd and usually quite lively on weekends. Expect it to be packed around 10pm+. Great place if you wanna hang out and just chill on Duxton"
This happy hour will have you a little loco,"Vibe is perfect for drinks after work with friends, if the weather is nice take advantage of their great patio. At $9 SGD happy hour Margaritas are a steal! Overall they do a very nice margarita, both frozen and on the rocks. The food is good and I like the fact that they try bold, new, flavor combinations—even if they are a bit of a miss. Waitstaff is friendly, but like many places in Singapore, can be a bit inattentive. Downside? Bathrooms here are unisex and there are only two of them, makes for a bit of a line. I would gladly visit again."
VERY NICE WAITER,"It's not often that the waiters are nice/good, it's almost if it's not there own choice to work in a restaurant. But here, this guy loves his work, I can tell. Really nice. All though the food was less special, it was okay but not ''good''. But we had a lovely evening, the Corona tasted very good:p"
Great food. Great service,"This place is a gem. The food is magnificent but the best thing about Lucha Loco is the service. The staff bend over backward to assist and ensure you have a great experience. My wife and I have been back 4 times now, with different groups of friends and it never disappoints."
Wrong day to have visited. Food okay,"Was looking for some good Mexican food. Checked on line and was recommended this Restuarant. I called but misunderstood that there was a private function and hence had to be at the bar only. On reaching was advised that the food was also limited. But disappointing.

Anyways having reached I ordered a martini which was delicious. The bar lady was very helpful.

Ordered nacho and Guacamole. It was okay

Then I order a mushroom taco which was very tasty

I ended with the beef taco but it was not nice. The meat was full of fat

On the whole not a great experience. Maybe I will try one day when they don’t have a private party"
Average food for the hype.,"Walked in with 6friends. The hostess was super nice and arrange a table for us, even tough we didn’t had a reservation. We was seated at the bar and arrange a proper table for us. The waitress who took our order was very clear and she knows her food knowledge. Our food arrive with we having very high expectation, but it went wrong. The food was not that great. There are a lot of room for improvement. Overall the flavours lacking with poor presentation."
Evening meal whilst on holiday,"We went here last night after reading several recommendations. The place has a very chilled vibe. We were seated promptly in the garden area amidst the sparkly lights which was just sweet! We had guacomole to start (the make it your own aspect was delightful), and then 2 veggie tacos, the baja fish tacos and the chicken quesidilla. We had churros for dessert all washed down with a jug of their lime frozen margarita. I have to say, I thought the whole experience was great. The food was fresh and tasty, the margarita has the perfect balance of slush and the service was prompt. I would definitely visit again - shame I live on the other side of the world!"
Wonderful service and great food,"We popped by Lucha Loco almost by accident and were immediately happy upon looking at the menu as we had been craving Mexican food. The place was pretty busy (happy hour was on) but we were given a table right away despite being only walk-in guests. They were prompt in taking our order for happy hour even though happy hour was ending in 5 mins and we even were asked again if we had any last orders for happy hour after that.

We had the mushroom quesadilla, Baja fish taco, and DIY guacamole. You can choose whatever condiments you would like to mix into your guacamole so that it’s done to your liking and we also asked for salt and pepper which they quickly obliged. Along with the guacamole came a basket of corn chips and there was so much guacamole (think about 2 avocados worth) we ordered another basket of chips to finish it up. We were told the chips would be an additional $5, which we were totally willing to pay, but upon serving the second basket of chips they told us it was complimentary. Such a nice gesture, we were so touched by the generosity!

Ambience was perfect - not too noisy, not too quiet, and the music good too. I like how when the bar gets busy all three bartenders coordinate their drink shaking so it’s one big party behind the bar. We also witnessed the staff singing happy birthday to a guest and it was the most enthusiastic restaurant birthday song I’d ever seen, complete with a sombrero for the birthday girl.

Service was AMAZING. Our server, Andik, is a gem. Friendly and attentive and he even made time to make jokes with us. My friend had trouble pronouncing an item on the menu and he very generously offered to teach her and after that even checked back to see if she’d remembered it!

While the restaurant seemed a tad understaffed for a Friday night, all the staff were in good spirits and everything was executed with a smile. Water was topped up promptly and done so subtly sometimes we didn’t even notice it. They also check back on you many times to make sure your table is alright and if you need anything else, which to me is a high level of service standards.

Food is not too pricey (and totally satisfied our cravings for Mexican food) and for the service and the ambience, I would go back over and over. Keep up the fantastic work!"
You must be loco!!,"I have been to the various outlets of Lucha Loco since they first opened at Robertson Quay & they were always great venues on all fronts. Now not so much. I went to the Duxton Hill outlet with friends & while the staff, location & decor were all excellent as always,sadly the F&B has taken a nose dive. It's very clear the management have cut back on portion sizes while maintaining prices. Cocktails were clearly ' diluted eg Maya Mules, Margheritas with about the same kick as Coke Zero !! Food quality was mixed eg the stuffed jalapenos were tasteless, empty & had to be sent back. The cevice, listed as a main was barely adequate for a fish hating toddler & the staff were clearly embarrassed when this was commented on. Service was good & we really liked the staff but they are being done a disservice by this decline in the food & drinks offerings. Such a shame, Lucha used to be one if my favourites in town.My advice - by all means go for the atmosphere & service but no longer expect a great night of drinks and dining. Today's Lucha has become thoroughly average."
Lovely,"The mexican food was good, altough maybe not too abundant. The service was attentive and kind, but the best of all was the location. The big terrace is a dream place. It was busy on Friday night but they managed to find us a spot."
Nice Mexican food and setting,"The setting of Lucha Loco makes it one of my favorites when craving mexican food in Singapore. The patio is great on a cooler evening.

The food is also really great. Coming from Texas, I crave a Mexican fix and this is as close to the fancier mexican as Texas as I can get, especially the tacos. I really enjoy the tacos here, would recommend the chicken"
Great evening ending in disaster,"Chose this place to catch up with close friends traveling to Singapore for a holiday. Our experience was a classic case of a very good evening ruined by inexcusable service. We were told early in the evening that a particular dish is not available only to see it served to three other tables after us. Not withstanding that we wanted to move on an enjoy the evening. When the final bill came, we pointed out that the item which was denied to us was billed. Astonishingly we were told that the ‘staff’ believes we were lying. Shocking !! For a $8 appetizer on a $600+ billing"
Awesome Service Great Mexican Food,"The Margaritas were fabulous, up there with Mexico!!!! The food was outstanding, “ Not really Nachos “ with pulled pork,chicharron sour cream, avocado and jalapeño and a great range of 6” Tacos with various fillings. Well worth a visit to Lucha Loco in Singapore"
Extremely Poor Standards of SERVICE,"This is the worst experience of service in my years in Singapore. Despite telling the waiter my dietary restrictions I was served exactly what I had requested 'NOT' to included in my food.

After the blunder made they tried to pacify by merely not charging for the particular dish and the cheek to give me a dessert as compensation. Such restaurants should ideally be penalized for grave mistakes especially since the requests (owing to religious beliefs & morals) were made clear and completely ignored.

I'd never go back to this place ever again and strongly recommend anyone who wants good service to stay 'Very far away' from this place."
A true mexican nightmare,"The staff was impatient with our seating arrangement and did'nt seem to care much about our comfort. I especially disliked how they disregarded our request to be seated / moved to a specific area of the restaurant. The staff seemed cold and disinterested. A couple of them angry too !

The nachos was average and the margaritas light !
Don't bother going to this place."
Great to sit outside when weather is cool,"A great place to be outside when the weather is cool. Tucked away at the corner, nice and quiet.

Service is good and prompt. Food however is not something one would remember much. We had the vegetarian quesadilla and the grain bowl to share. They were okay, not to write about. The brownie we had was a bit dry and the flavour was average.

I would come back for drinks but not for food."
Amazing experience!,"Overall experience was perfect - the food, drinks, ambiance and the service. The place was immaculate, with extensive menu and interesting cocktails. Would definitely return to Lucha Loco again with my friends!"
Best Mexican Food,My partner and I loved Lucia Loco! We shared a few entrees and each had a taco. The food was amazing and the drinks were excellent. We sat outside in the garden area which was very charming with good atmosphere and music. The waiters were also very friendly and ours was particularly funny so we enjoyed a few laughs. The surrounding neighbourhood is very cute and if you wanted you are only a short walk away from Chinatown.
Ladies night out,Great place to go after cocktails for a ladies night out. They have so many different types of tacos - btw all freshly made! Would recommend the sweet potato and chicken. My friends ordered the tortillas - yum. Washed it down with sangria or red wine. Happy evening!
Umm,"The area is a fun place to visit with plenty of bars and places to eat. Lucha Loco is a popular Mexican and the staff are lovely but the food....Umm! Basic is probably the best way to describe it. We had a number of different dishes between us and nothing stood out.

In short - If the food was half as good as the team who serve it we would be regulars. Unfortunately it’s not."
Lovely cocktails and great food.,"We had dinner in this restaurant and the food was amazing. The tacos are small in size but taste good. The frozen pineapple margaritas were gorgeous and went down very easily.
The restaurant can be busy in the evening time for dinner so be prepared as you may need to wait at the bar."
Cocktails and small plates,Had a nice supper here. A few dishes with jugs of cocktails. The grilled stuffed peppers are excellent. Gauc and pineapple salsa not so great. Tacos are nice and the crab tostaditas are tasty. You will want more!
Tasty tacos,"Came here for lunch today and tried a selection of the tacos. These were very tasty but a little on the small side. Nice location, good ambience and efficient service."
Excellent Ambiance .................,"Selected this place to celebrate wife's birthday and was right in the choice.
Made a reservation to play safe and was highly impressed with the ambiance which is so lively due to the right music being played.Good service and excellent food and drinks specially the Margaritas (AMAZING)
Would rate it 9.5 out of 10 for overall experience......."
Amazing Mexican Tapas,"Visited this lively restaurant with friends. Chose a table in the garden area but under the extendable canopy (just in case it rained which it did very briefly). Very attentive, friendly and enthusiastic staff. Took our drink order first - a fantastic range or margaritas- the blood orange and guava one was our favourite. Chipa salsa and delicious home made guacamole to start. Then onto some amazing tacos - ordered a couple each to try with the option to order more later depending on appetite. Baja Fish, Chorizo com Res Tea and Carnitas were our top favourites but others equally tasty. Nice Singapore spicy hear added to these Mexican dishes.

No room for dessert.

Not cheap but well priced considering we had alcoholic drinks."
Nice ambience but pushy staff,Had pre-dinner drinks here. Nice outdoor seating area and good margaritas. Really like the wrestling themes. Only issue is the staff are a bit too attentive and kept pushing for more orders. Spoilt the evening a bit.
"Yummy Mexican food, cute restaurant, excellent service",The restaurant itself is really really cute and the food is awesome. They also have good beer on their happy hours promotion in the evening too. The Guacamole is a little sour but so far the food is perfect and great service
"Fresh, fun, stunning food","To carry off a Mexican theme so far from Mexico is a big achievement and Lucia Loco does it brilliantly. Not since Wahaca first opened in London have I tasted such fresh lively ingredients. The outdoor area with the fairy lights is magical and combined with a balmy Singapore evening and a few excellent cocktails (El Megroni) it makes for a very special night, congratulations."
great vibes and tacos,"lively outdoor setting with wooden communal tables for larger groups and smaller ones for couples. We ordered margaritas - bloody orange & guava (7/10) and tamarind (8/10). Had a tuna tostada and mango ceviche for starters. Tostada was good, ceviche was overly tangy for my taste.
Star of the day was the Baja Fish Taco, we liked it so much that we had a second helping. Its a much recommended taco. Saw people ordering corn cob which looked delicious as well.
This is a solid mexican option in Singapore!"
Awesome food with lovely ambience,"Glad that we chose to sit outdoors instead which had lovely lights and ambience around. The service crew were excellent! Food was delicious, love their margaritas! Great place for a date and friends gathering!"
Sit outside and enjoy the magic,"My friend said we must go and take a look at Singapore Lan Kwai Fong (hong kong).

Like everything else it was walking distance. Agree a bit uphill like in HK but comparison stops here.

We came into the street and the guy fm Lucha Loco stood outside and described all places along the street for us. Fantastic, not to sell his own place but to help us to find our best choice for the evening. We looked for drinks only he suggested their outside garden, we have no reason to regret.
Wonderful garden to sit on a hot evening. Staff where caring and attentive. We simple had a nice stay for our drinks.

Place is actually a Mexican can't say anything about the food, but got her to hand out and chill down for some drinks."
"Great food, brilliant staff and perfect location","This is our ""go to"" family restaurant in Singapore. The waiting staff are great, especially Aelfira, the outside seating is lovely and the food, especially the tostaditas, is delicious."
Worst Mexican food that I never has,"Food is just bad, meat was dry and without flavour..is really difficult find Mexican food as bad as lucha loco....and very expensive!!"
"Great, great and great","We came here on a Saturday night and we left wanting more time to enjoy everything they offered. The group of us has the set menu of 5 different plates. Our waiter Reggie was amazing. He kept coming over and making sure that everything was fine and that we were enjoying our meals and drinks. Next time we are in Singapore, we will be coming here again for sure!"
Fantastic real mexican food,Real mexican food is hard to find. Then I mean mais tortillas in stead of flour and not the texmex food. At lucha loco we took the 5 course chefs special and it was very good!!! My husband is mexican and even he thought it was lovely! One of the best restaurants in singapore. They also serve really good sangria's and cocktails. In the weekend you can stay after dinner for drinks and the music will be louder.
Mexican food with a view,"With the hot humid weather in Singapore, it's hard to get a bunch of diners to want to sit in the open for their meals. But it's a refreshing sight at Lucha Loco on Duxton Hill, where one could enjoy a glass of wine while enjoying the view of the sunset. The food was good and in bite size portion, the savoury squid with deep fried pork was good, mushrooms and pollo quesadilla a must order. The chipotle chicken wings was roasted to perfection and so was the roasted sweet corn. By the time we finished the mains, our tummy was too full for deserts. Overall a good place for a great catch-up with friends."
They forgot my order! lol,"I'm a international chef who lives in Australia at the moment, Originally from Mexico and after spend a few year in USA and now in OZ I always try to find some time in my trips to visit mexican ""authentic"" food places! Everything starts ok till the waiter took my order and 40 min later after everyone around was finishing their meals even when I arrived first I decided to leave! Waiters didn't help and hostess was nice but she didn't know how to handle the situation and I could even try the food! Be careful! nice atmosphere, bad service and high prices!"
Great place for tacos and margaritas!,"Have been to Lucha a number of times, both when I used to visit Singapore and now as a resident. Never fails to disappoint. Great outdoor areas, awesome margaritas and great Mexican fare.
Really worth the effort if you are looking for a casual night out. In a good area surrounded by a number of other bars, in case you fancy a cleansing ale before bedtime."
Amazing place,Best mexican food I have had in a very long time. The vibe is really cool and the waiters are so sweet and welcoming. Really worth a visit!!!
"Ambience, drinks, Mexican food. Great for kicking back on a Friday night!","Best thing about the restaurant: the ambience. Great open air area, with some funky 90s tunes playing on a Friday night. Open till late (well, late for Singapore), and the drinks, though not cheap, were likewise not overpriced.

Can be a good spot for a small group of friends, or for post-dinner dates.

In a district with mostly tiny shophouse-sized restaurants, the wide, open layout of the place, combined with well thought interior designs, makes Lucha Loco a refreshing sight.

Would go back."
Fantastic mexican at Singapore prices,"The food here is amazing and would highly recommend it. We would recommend trying the corn appetizer. Please do not book here expecting cheap mexican food, this is Singapore it is expensive, but definitely worth it!"
recommended by Lonely Planet with NO reasons,"we love Mexican food and we are very pleased to enjoy a good restaurant while travelling around the world.
we picked few appetizers: ceviche ( 20 SGD: tasting only of coriander and big slices of onions ); nachos con guacamole ( 5 SGD: ok ); brown rice with gualapenos ( 7 SGD: too too too too much spicy and too much onion slices; no way to feel all the other ingredients ); tacos with squid ( 8 SGD: simply disgusting, can't recognize the seafood inside ); mini tortillas with crab ( 10-15 SGD: ok but we ate them after all the rest, too late to be able to avoid the onion/coriander odors. )
in total, adding an orange juice and a bottle of water we spent 86 SGD.
Mexico is far away from Lucha Loco."
The best Mexican food in town!,"The best Mexican food in town. That salsa is the best i've had in Singapore hands down! If you are a lacto vegetarian looking for that perfect taco, this is the place for it."
finger licking.............,"A group of us went to Lucha Loco..it has a great atmosphere and the food is fresh and spicy. The drinks menu was varied with lots of choice. The ribs and the pork taco were good. The staff were pacy and overall we enjoyed the night. If you are a BIG eater, this may be a pricey night compared to others! The naco's are not the biggest!"
Mexican Street Food in very happening areas,"This place is in Tanjong Pagar area filled with the double storey pre-war shop houses. There are many good restaurant around the vicinity.

We visited on Friday evening and the restaurant is super busy. Fortunately we have make the booking earlier and managed to get a good seat next to the bar.

One of us is Mexican and according to him the food here are street food. However, the serving size is very small. The nacho I ordered is about the size of my iphone 7, and it costs S$7. The Grilled chicken is very good.

Nevertheless, the ambience here resemble alley in Mexico with Mexican music playing at the background except in Singapore people do not dance with the music."
Very nice Mexican restaurant in Duxton Hill,"Restaurant located in a very nice and relaxed neighbourhood. It is especially nice if you dine outside on the patio. You can come and have a drink and eat with a large group of friends. We were 10 of us. Excellent tapas and quesadillas, very good frozen Margaritas, and cocktails. Very nice and cool atmosphere."
Chicken wings!,"Located in a cozy neighbourhodd, Lucha Loco delivered good food and prompt service. The chicken wings were excellent as well the frozen margarita. Tacos were average, highs & lows."
Birthday,My friend organised a surprise birthday meal for me. The food was excellent and I had a lovely birthday cake with candles and a sombrero.
