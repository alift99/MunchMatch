A good venue for celebration,"Good food to celebrate the coming spring festival. Even better was the attentive staff who have provided very good personal service despite the crowds. Please convey my gratitude to the staff, Fanny, Yoke Khuen, Kar Woon, Kihki, May, Carmen, Juy… and also the kitchen staff for their culinary skills."
Authentic food in Holiday Inn Atrium,"Authentic Cantonese food, we ordered their signature duck, house noodle, soup vegetable and tofu claypot and all tastes great. It seems they recently increased their price compare to the online menu and we came to about $50 USD per person."
32 Years Old Restaurant That Serve Cantonese Cuisine,"Operating since 1990, this 32 year old restaurant still serve great authentic Cantonese Cuisines, especially their Dim Sum dishes … with old flavours.

Like their Yam Dumpling with Chicken & Seafood fillings shaped like a Duck (Able to feel the texture and taste of each well flavoured components in the fillings after bitting through the crispy crust).

Was also Wow by their Radish Cake with Preserved Meat (Went well together, both presented with good texture and taste), Brown Rice and Glutinous Rice with Chicken (Enjoyed every bite - it was Awesome! With no issue of Glutinous Rice sticking to your teeth as there are mixture of Brown).

Egg Tarts were average, crust abit hard but fillings soft and not too sweet. Salted Egg Yolk Custard Buns didnt looked good but were comparable or slightly better to others.

X.O. Yangzhou Fried Rice from their main menu was also average as rice was abit too moist and lack flavours. Sweet and Sour Pork was great though (Well executed .. good texture from the mix and flavours from the Savoury Sauce)

Overall it was a great Sunday Lunch at this restaurant, but experience could have been better if they could have sufficient trained staffs (Not overworked Staffs) to handle their weekend crowd (Even though its not filled) or at least be attentive to every table, not just big table in private rooms."
"Tea smoked duck, whisky and excellent service","Came here with family to celebrate a birthday. Food was excellent. Service was great. To top it off, there is no corkage on the first bottle of whisky.

The tea smoked duck had subtle sense of tea that brought out the sweetness of the duck.

The yuzu pomelo prawns was very unique.

The appetizers, roast pork and white bait paired very well with whisky!"
Good dim sum lunch & excellent service,"Steam pork ribs were meaty, only few bones. Dace balls were tasty & succulent. Service was great & fast. We really enjoyed our lunch.."
Good,"My friend recommended me to come here, no referent, food is good and love the lobster noodles and dessert"
Good,"Food is good, waiters very friendly and approachable Environment good Not very crowded, 10/10 will visit again"
Dinner at Xin Cuisine,"Was a nice and warm restaurant. Very good for family dinner gathering. Celebrating my birthday as well.

Carmen was the manager in charge of my table. She was very well versed in the menu and recommended the right amount of food to us.

Just nice and just like Xin Cuisine. Nothing overboard and is just what a nice dinner should be.

Good food, good ambience and good services.

Thanks Xin Cuisine, Carmen and her team."
Family dinner,"Have a good dinner. Kids friendly Portion of good was reasonable, and was accessible as near to mrt."
Above average,"Second visit, the braised live lobster ee-fu noodle was almost good.
The braised abalone, sea cucumber, prawn, mushroom and roast duck served in mini pumpkin was above average.
The poached sea perch with Chinese rice wine was just okay, could taste a bit of fishiness.

Nice ambience and normal customer service."
Dinner Gathering with friends @ Xin Cuisine at Holiday Inn Singapore Atrium,"Food is awesome and Restaurant team with Excellent service (Carmen, Ivy & May) 5 Star service😉💯 We will definately come back again to dine in and recommend to my friends and relatives."
Birthday celebration,"Excellent food and service! Little known gem. Good value for money:) the mango pudding and the roast pork, and duck are worth having. Please order :)"
Great food and service,Service is good and food that we ordered all of them taste delicious ! Recommended place for friends and family.
Friend’s gathering,Great food!!!!! You have to order the trio platter to try.. The mango sago was a great dessert after.
Value for money,Excellent service and delicious food. Great place to celebrate special ocassion. The miso fish and Wayu Beef is a must order.
Good dinner,"First visit, the stir-fried lobster with egg white and crab roe was good, but the broccoli which was part of the dish was a bit too hard for me.
The Xin's crispy roast pork with mustard dip was good too, seldom ordered dishes that are easily available in the hawker centre stall, ordered this because of the good reviews here.
Deep-fried sesame ball with red bean and chocolate liqueur filling was above average, didn't like the liqueur taste.

Nice ambience and normal customer service."
Great experience,"First time here and I must say....the food is awesome! Especially if one is a fan of duck, most definitely will love the taste of the Peking Duck (北京片皮鸭) and the Home-style Roasted Duck with Tea Leaves (故乡茶皇鸭), and how well it's being made. Their Peking Duck dish is slightly different from the usual I have in other places, as it comes with this squarish crispy stuff as one of the condiments amongst the common rest.
As for the rest of the dishes, taste was just right. Really a Cantonese cuisine place where if you are hunting for a place for the older folks, this will be it.
For the desserts served, I certainly have no qualms about it. The Chilled Puree of Mango, Sago and Pomelo (杨枝甘露), although the outlook gave a ""too milky feel"", the taste turned out otherwise and it's yumz! As for the Deep-fried Sesame Ball with Red Bean and Chocolate Liqueur Filling (酒酿煎堆仔), do note that before sinking teeth into the sesame ball, give it a little 'shake up' to ensure the liqueur and red bean filling mixes well together.....otherwise might end up tasting too much of the warm/hot liqueur, making the whole dessert taste too overwhelming for delectable satisfaction.
My next round of trying out at this place will be for their dim sum....looking forward! =)"
Under rated Cantonese restaurant,"Refined, quiet Cantonese restaurant on the 4th floor of Holiday Inn Atrium hotel. The food we tried were well executed and reasonably priced - in particular, roast duck with tea leaves, kung pao chicken, bean curd with prawns and sea cucumber, and crab meat fried rice.

Excellent food and service,Attentive and friendly service with a smile. The fish and beef were delicious. Nice and quiet place for small gathering with family and friends.
Awesome NYE Dinner Experience,"It was indeed a fantastic experience as always! The food was great and quality always consistent, service by all Xin’s staff (Ivy, Kar Woon, May, Carmen, and everyone else) were all awesome and welcoming! Always feels at home when I’m back for a meal! Thank you so much for the great and peaceful dinner! ◡̈ 10/10 recommended!"
Wonderful dinner gathering,A group of four went for a simple dinner. The dishes were simply delicious. Portioning wise was also enough. 4 of us had 3 dishes and one fried rice with dessert as finale. Great to come back and the taste was still consistent!
Good food good environment good services,Book a table of 5 and enjoyed the good food offered by the restaurant. First time in this restaurant and was surprised of the high standard of the food offered. Was also surprised to see the restaurant packed with customer as I thought it would not be so crowded as it is a weekday and the location of the restaurant is quite out of place.
Food,Very nice Chinese cuisine by hongkong chef. Highly recommend will come back again. Staff are professional as well
A hidden Food Paradize,"just nowNEW

Overall,""it is a good dining experience with delicious food. Staff are great and take pride in what they do. They offered to clean up the table after our dinner before havibg our dessert as well. Carmen is specially attentive and provide excellent service to us. We will come back again"
Lunch,Xin cushion is good food to recommend for all my friends Delicious yummy food Here is good for birthday celebrations Timsum is the best food and good price. Love ot
Xin Cuisine Service Excellence,"I would like to give my sincere appreciation and thanks to Ivy from the Xin Cusine Mooncake Team. Despite handling massive orders and enquiries, she was patient and explained to me in detail. As they were closed on a PH, she even reached out to me the following day to catch up on my orders. Additionally, she managed to understand my preference and was perfect in delivering a customer-centric experience to me.

Her service is beyond expectations and one that deserves recognition. For her service, my decision on annual mooncake orders is easily set to order from Xin Cuisine. Thank you for your service, it is greatly appreciated!"
Good food and staff,A good venue for a simple meal with wonderful staff and simple dishes which are delicious. A good consideration for people who’d like to have an early dinner.
Dinner,Love how the chef executed simple dishes so well. The roast duck skin was crispy and meat was juicy. Steamed prawns with garlic was flavorful. Wagyu beef was tender. Longan was a nice compliment to the beef. Crabmeat fried rice was clean tasting and not oily at all! They are also very careful to handle my friend’s many allergies. Attentive and thoughtful service.
Excellent,"I have been ordering takeaway dinners for family from Xin Cuisine since Circuit Breaker period, the delicious dishes have indeed brightened our life and we would like to express our heartfelt appreciation to the chefs at Xin Cuisine who have prepared our meals with great passion in cooking.

Service staff have been extremely attentive and considerate in packing / preparing our takeaway meals. They even go extra miles to remind me in advance of my upcoming order to ensure we get our food while it's piping hot.

We have to continue with takeaway meals from Xin Cuisine even though we are tempted to dine at the restaurant since it's open for dining in now, as we have elderly parents and we try to minimize their outings till situation gets better.

We look forward to more excellent meals and more varieties of dish from Xin Cuisine."
Memorable Dining Experience,"Our foody instinct has pressurised us to explore authentic chinese cuisine this time hence we chose to try the famous Xin Cuisine restaurant in Hotel Holiday INN Atrium located on 317,Outram Road , Singapore on 6th March 20.

The movement we entered there,the ambiance and light chinese music was a pleasant surprise.

We have ordered a mix of seafood and chicken with seasonal veggies.
Appetizer, Main course and Dessert, all delicacies were made to perfection and presented with finnese. And on top of it, the service with smile by the always attentive attendants was impeccable.

Our 100% recommendations for this restaurant to try sumptuous and savoury chinese cuisine."
Great vegan selections with a great ambience,"We always come here for the vegan food as they have very good substitutions and also a decent vegan selection. The staffs are well aware of veganism (mostly referred to as Chinese vegetarian) and so, will notify the chefs accordingly! We get the stewed vermicelli with pan fried gluten and it never disappoints. The “gong Bao” gluten dish is also amazing; a medley of sweet yet tangy sauce which leaves one wanting more."
Very good food and service,"Food was great and service by Alvin and team was very efficient and pleasant.

We especially loved the spinach in superior stock and the fish noodles. The dim sum was also very good."
Birthday celebration,"They offered extremely good service & excellent Chinese cuisine.
Tim sum is so freshly made & the camphor duck is so crazy om outside - succulent on inside.
All the service staff are friendly & they made us so at home dining there.
Thanks Carmen & your team!"
Disappointing dinner at Xin Cuisine,"On 26 September ‘19, I made a reservation for dinner with a very good Friend at Xin Cuisine. The last time I patronised Xin Cuisine was about 10 years ago and the food then was good and it was well patronised with good service. This revisit after so many years was met with disappointment. First of all the reception was not welcoming and the service staff all looked rather uninterested and unfriendly except for a young bespectacled female wait staff who was rather helpful.I ordered quite a few dishes. Appetiser was assorted mushrooms with truffle oil. It was just plain stirred fried oyster sauce mushrooms without even a hint of truffle. It was served unceremoniously on a plate unlike the picture in the menu which was nicely plated. I asked a plump dark skinned short haired waitress who looked rather unfriendly and she rudely said that picture in the menu is for illustration only and the lack of truffle flavour is due to the supplier. How poor an attitude can it get?! It’s like saying take it or leave it ! I also ordered their signature abalone with sea cucumber @ $58 per person. I ordered 2 servings and to my consternation the abalone was only size of a thumb and the sea cucumber was size of a dainty lady’s index finger and shorter . The abalone was tough and not well braised . The dish was not flavorful and tasted bland. At $58 a serving it was a ripoff. I had much much better tasting food and value at other high end restaurants. The rest of the dishes were only passable.
After such a disappointing meal, I realized the reason why the restaurant was almost empty with only 3 tables of 2 pax each and table of 8. Unless they improve the service attitude and food standards and value, things will only languish at this stage"
Real Chinese Delight,Our family just spent a wonderful time at Xin Cuisine and was simply thrilled by the exquisite dishes. We especially love the soup and roast duck! Wonderful times.
Great restaurant for family gathering,"We celebrated a birthday with a table of about 10 pax. Having been here about 6 months back, I noticed that the food is still just as good as before. The roast duck is excellent and so is the braised beef. We also liked the noodle soup with clams - tasty and fresh. Good to also note that service is attentive and pleasant. Recommended for family gatherings for the food, service and ambiance. Only downside is that the quality of the tea can be improved as they charge $4++ per pax."
Well done,"Good Chinese food, great service. Surprisingly good for a hotel restaurant. Dumplings, hot pots, roasted meats, the works."
"Wow, probably one of the best.","So we’ve had a lot of dim sums in our lifetimes, being both from Chinese descent, so when my Wife suggested we go to the Holiday Inn for dim sum I was a little sceptical, as I’ve never been a fan of hotel food.

Now the interior isn’t saying much (1980 style) and the service is a little slow, but from the fried rice to the simplest Cheung fun and Ha Gao, each individual morsel was hand-made and delicious, and the Xiao Long Bao was probably twice as juicy as Din Tai Fung’s. We had a simple fare but we’ll be back for a proper Chinese meal as soon as we have something to celebrate.

I had a quick word with the manager who told me the Hong Kong Chef has been with the same restaurant for 30 years, and when I looked up from my food I realised we were the only Caucasians in the packed room, I guess this is the local local’s favourite.

Honestly, don’t come as I don’t want more people to spoil it. But if you have to, please enjoy."
Went with a local and it was great!,"Outside of a hawker stand, Xin is the best Chinese I've had in Singapore. From Chinese dishes to Singapore specialties, this place is excellent. The service is excellent and very helpful in choosing dishes. don't be put off by the location in a Holiday Inn -- it is an excellent restaurant."
Dim Xin,"After having dim Xin food lunch, I felt thirsty as the food contain a lot of MSG to taste good. I need to drink a lot of water after the lunch."
Nice Cantonese cuisine !!!,Xin cuisine Chinese restaurant at level 4 of Holiday Inn Atrium hotel has good interiors and comfortable seating. We went there during our stay in Christmas holidays. The vegetarian options were also quite good and we were happy with prompt service and the suggestions made by the staff. We tried most stuff recommended by them and were happy with the overall experience. Pricing is slightly on higher side though !!!
Nice and Interesting Dim Sum,"This year, I do not intend to write lots of posts for this site since I had kind of foreseen that I will not be visiting new restaurants within the year plus the plan to focus on my other writing projects. But guess what, here I am writing about another restaurant! This is where those vouchers get me to: checking out new restaurants. And when the food at the restaurant is good, I feel obliged to write about it.

While the interior is of nice modern Chinese theme, Xin Cuisine mainly wins me over with its selection of interesting and unique dim sum items, especially those under Sunday Special.

One of the highlights is Seafood Dumpling with Pumpkin Paste. This is a very interesting dim sum in which the tasty meat filling, completed with juices like what is found in Xiao Long Bao, is wrapped within a thin layer of deep fried pumpkin paste. The exterior of the pumpkin paste is very crispy, contrasting so well with the moist filling. And the earthly sweetness of pumkpin adds dimension to the saltiness of the meat. I like this creation a lot.

Highly recommend the Steamed Shrimp Paste Ball with Marinated Glutinous Rice and Chinese Wine. Yes, this is one of the Sunday Specials. I like the unique texture of the glutinous rice coating the shrimp ball. And one bite into this, one can immediately catch whiffs of the light floral aroma of Chinese wine. The shrimp is fresh, tasty and springy in texture. This is my favourite among Xin’s offerings because it is so unique.

Shrimp Dumping with Fish Roe, more commonly known as Siew Mai, is packed with lots of ingredients such as fish roe and prawns, so this staple dim sum is a good choice to consider. I am expecting Xin’s Sweet, Sour and Spicy Dumpings to be like those spicy dumplings soaked in vinegar and served with chopped spring onion and chillies. Alas, I am wrong. But smooth texture of the dumping skin and generous meat filling make this a pretty nice treat.

Pan-fried Pork Bun aka Gou Bu Li is another must order. The bun is so fluffy and its surface is slightly pan-fried to bring out the flavour of the dough. The meat filling is very flavourful and juicy.

Stir-fried Radish Cake in X.O sauce here is spicer than its counterparts in other restaurants, and I like it, surprisingly as I am generally not really into real spicy food.

Yam Dumpling with Chicken and Mushroom looks really pretty and I enjoy savouring the crispy exterior that shatters at a light bite. But I will like it more if the yam coating is thinner since too much sticky yam eclipses the taste of the filling.

Service is pretty much the same as the standard of most Chinese restaurants, efficient and the aunties are friendly.

With so many interesting dim sum items that I have yet tried, I am really looking forward to go back and check them out."
Can be better given its a Cantonese restaurant,"Cantonese are well known for good food hence certain level of expectation is there. Ordered veal meat, vegetable, tofu, suckling pig and prawns. All taste as expected, nothing overwhelms me thus abit disappointed. But to be fair, the dishes were all well cooked and nice. Can revisit still."
Excellent food,We had new year eve dinner at the Xin. Food was good and surprisingly services was good too. They were happy to show me some vegetarian options. Prices are not very high either. Overall highly recommended.
Alacarte dinner with family,"Nice environment and the restaurant was filled even on a Monday night. The signature dishes were creative and yummy, especially the wagyu beef with black pepper & longan and the deep fried prawn with yuzu mayonaisse. A slight disappointment - the chilled mango coulis & hashima was supposed to be served in a pumpkin shell but it appeared in a bowl as they had run out of pumpkin shells We were glad to offset the bill with Chope vouchers purchased at 25% discount."
Foods vs Service,"Just have a visit to this Restaurant cos a friend staying in the hotel.

While we walk in a lady staff serve us but without any smile.

This let me have a feeling we're not welcome, although it might not be the case, however, I think a simple smile is much better.

We order some dim sum and Chinese tea. As my friend do not drink tea, I only call for me one person, again no warm feeling, look cool on this lady staff.

Beside that, waited about 20-25mins for my dim sum, porridges tasteless, but others dim sum ok to me.

Overall, foods satisfied but not the services, this was my own experience, perhaps we encountered a staff which not in good mode on that day, but in the service line try to simle to Customer is a important matters.

Hope next time see some improvement."
First Visit to Xin Cuisine,"The service personnel welcome us wwarmly and lead us to our table.
We were approached by Mr. Alvin who recommended us a few dishes for our selections. As this was our first visit we tried a few dishses which he recommended. We enjoyed our food as they were prepared according to our requests of not too salty.
Throughout our meal the service personnel were very courteous and cheerful."
Very good lunch & dim sum,"Me and my wife came back here for lunch for our 1st anniversary, our last visit was the day after our wedding. This time we ordered mostly from the dim sum menu, along with the signature roasted duck from the main menu. Firstly, the dim sum was amazing, our personal favourite being the siew mai: very tasty and authentic. Secondly, the duck was delicious and not too fatty and the century egg congee was thick and full of ingredients with the century egg being especially fresh and full of taste. Finally, the thing we were most eager to try again: the deep-fried Häagen-Dazs ice cream. WOW. Still just as sinful and yummy as we remember it being last year. All in all, couldn't be happier with the food. (We even took away 3 boxes of the salted egg fish skin for our family to try. Seriously, if you dine here, you HAVE to try them!)
The waitresses and the restaurant manager were very attentive and friendly, happy to chat and give advice on choice of dishes and teas.
All in all, so very glad we came back for our anniversary. A perfect lunch spent together with lovely food and service!"
Tasty Dim Sum,"Located in Holiday Inn in Outram/Havelock, the restaurant is not big. They offer dim sum buffet before 12:30 on Sun & we had the a la carte. Their fried beef rice noodles is the best we had in Singapore so far - tasty and non greasy using normal beef slices rather than the thinly sliced waygu beef. The other dim sums are mostly authentic except for the crab & scallop dumpling in soup & the taro swan. The ambience is good. In general, it’s a good place for dim sum lunch."
DimSum is terrible,The worst dimsun i have in singapore. don't waste your time and money. I didn't order any dishes so can't provide comment.
Unknowledgeable staff and poor hygiene,"Visited with family. Beautiful and cosy restaurant. Dishes were good and reasonably priced. However, main grievances were:- Male waiter serving our table had no clue of the menu. He could not even name the restaurant's signature dishes.- Same male waiter handled our food with his HAND which was rather shocking. (Could have been a $300 fine and demerit points under food safety regulations)- Ordered 2 baskets of the same dim sum and they squeeze it in 1 basket (Chef is lazy)- Dessert was served with the side of the bowl still dripping. Apparently no one checks the presentation before serving- Refused to provide carpark for members despite clearly listed as a member benefit - Extremely slow (First table for lunch but last dish served 1 hour later)"
Good Saturday brunch,Good Saturday Brunch with family. Dim sum is decent for all family perusal. Recommended for family brunch that you can spend the whole afternoon there.
Good Cantonese fare with fruity innovations,"Haven’t been here in a while, so am pleasantly surprised to discover interesting angles to food - clearly, the chef likes fruits. We found longans in the pepper stir fried beef tenderloin (very nice!), and in the lime sherbet and lemon grass jelly dessert. The dish featured in my photo is smoked goose with sliced apple (definitely don’t find that anywhere else). The crispy pork belly, Baked codfish, and simple boiled kailan are predictably good.

Ask for soup of the day - very homely Cantonese soup. Very nice, especially for someone who frequently eats out.

Service is attentive."
satisfying family dinner,"the roast duck, salted egg yolk prawns, and three cups chicken was one of the best i had! but sadly not their desserts in my opinion. we had the fried ice cream. the batter was too oily and ice cream inside was too hard to eat. so we waited for it soften and melt. but we will still come back for the mains!"
Cantonese restaurant Tiong Bahru and Robertson Quay,"On the fourth floor of a hotel that has been standing on Outram road for as long as I can remember. Currently the hotel is managed by Holiday Inn.

We had suckling pig, beef tenderloin, yuzu prawns and some dim sum. The food was decent but not spectacular. A very filling meal for three came up to around $200.

There were a lot of local families in the restaurant for lunch on Saturday. So it seems to be popular! Having said that we had no trouble booking a table at the last minute."
Great Cantonese cuisine,Came here because I had IHG vouchers to use and I am very glad I did. Almost all the dishes we ordered were great but the star of the night was the roast duck with tea leaves. Nice simple ambience and service was good. Will definitely come back.
Extremely memorable,"Xin Cuisine Chinese restaurant Located at Holiday Inn Singapore Atrium, 317 Outram Road Singapore. There are abundance of great Cantonese Chinese restaurants in Singapore... so I feel knowledgeable to say the Xin Cuisine Chinese Restaurant in Singapore is an absolutely fabulous place to spend an evening. It is a stylishly furnished Chinese restaurant that's found a home at the Holiday Inn Hotel. It has a tastefully ambience, unique blend of warm and cool tones, and a modern, sophisticated very comfortable place where you can enjoy an authentic fine dining experience. It is a distinctive but good up-market Chinese restaurant with Good service, and tasty harmonious food. What we really love about the exquisite mouthwatering Chinese cuisine is the usage of fresh, premium ingredients. Some of The food that we ordered were all outstanding full of flavour and well presented. The price tags are definitely high, but I guess that is the way in Singapore everything is quite inflated. Lastly, thumbs up to the service, it was impeccably...very professional and sophisticated, yet friendly. Many thanks to staff/manager Ivy to assist us on the right food choice. A perfect night. I truly recommend this place if you want high quality fine dining Chinese cuisine. Will definitely come back. Very soooon. Awesome!!!"
High-end Chinese restaurant,"We dined here many times, whenever we visited Singapore. Food was usually pretty good though relatively expensive. One of our favorites was the Crispy Sucking Pig.

We had Chinese New Year Eve dinner here this year. You had to pay in full when you reserved a table (most places only asked for a deposit). The meal was expensive (∼US$100 person, not including wine), and the food was subpar. Service was excellent as usual.

Four star rating was based on our prior visits. I would not recommend this place for Chinese New year banquet."
Good quality,"We had a wonderful dinner at Xin, even though they got an order wrong (got us 2 portions instead of 1). We started off with the soup of the day which had a wonderful stock and was full of ingredients (exotic mushrooms, dried scallops, chicken, pork, abalone). Next came the wagyu beef cubes (tender!), vegetable in stock (stock was a bit salty) and baked perch (this was the one that came in 2 portions instead if the 1 we ordered, but because it was so tasty, we didn't mind. Service was also professional and efficient. Recommended."
Good Food,I like the menu and the food was good. Value for money and there are very interesting dishes. I enjoyed it.
Great good!,Ambience of restaurant is good and food is tasty. Reasonable price and will definitely visit again. Good!
Great Chinese Dinner,We went here for dinner on our first night in Singapore. We were wanting dim sum but they only serve dim sum at lunch. With the help of the staff we were able to choose 3 very good dishes to share. I especially liked the chicken dish with the cashews. It was a little expensive but worth it. I also recommend the tiger beer.
Impeccable service after feedback on food,"Dining experience was generally satisfactory. After our feedback on one of the dishes, the manager was very apologetic about it and quick to wanting to change for another dish."
Excellent service and food,"First the ambience in the restaurant was good, and I love the prompt services by the staff. Good food recommendation by the kinki for us, group of 5 girls. The portion was just nice and Food was really awesome, especially the duck and the soup! Appreciate the extra service by Ivy, it was my birthday when we visited the restaurant and they prepared a cake for me. Will definitely visit the restaurant again!"
Excellent Service and Food,"First experience at this restaurant left a lasting impression on me. When me and my friends entered the restaurant we were quickly and efficiently brought to our seats, after which we were given the menu for us to order the dishes, many of the dish looked mouth-watering and we were at a lost on what to order. Fortunately, a staff/manager, Ivy, was there to assist us and gave us various recommendations on the restaurant's signature dishes. Throughout the meal Ivy was very attentive, she constantly refilled our tea. Another mark of excellent service by Ivy was when she realised that we really enjoyed the appetizer and took the initiative to help us get another serving of appetizer. Her good service has left a lasting impression on me and she should be a role model to all service staff. The service at this restaurant has made this experience extremely memorable, me and my friends had a great time there and we will definitely be back again soon!!"
Fantastic Dim Sum,"Had dim sum here for lunch. Everything was great! The dishes were spot on. If anything can be improved, it is the service as dishes were really slow to serve. But overall a good experience!"
Excellent service!!,"The service by Manager Ivy was excellent! She ensured everything was in place for my cousin’s birthday celebration from recommending dishes, ensuring the dishes only came when everyone has arrived and even checking with us if the food was alright! :) Would definitely come back again!"
Another excellent experience,Food was again delicious and service excellent. Manager Alvin and team provide made good recommendation and attentive services throughout the meal...well done once again...
Family lunch at Xin,"Food was good but for the price, it's not as worth. We used the membership card so it was a 25% discount. Ambience was good and staff were great!"
This was a great experience,"The food was delicious and the level of service was also excellent. The assistant manager Carmen Lee was very hospitable and helped us gave us good recommendation and also help quickly get our food prepared.
5 stars"
Exquisite Cantonese food..hidden gem in the city..!,"My family of 10 visited Xin cuisine located at HolidayInn Atrium for a birthday celebration.
We booked the Private Dining Room and was pleasantly surprise by the elegant decor and spaciousness.

The service was attentive and very thoughtful..providing shawls to the ladies who felt cold and a cute toy car for the toddler. The waitress who served us was knowledgeable and provided good recommendations.

The best part was the food! We ordered the signature dishes and were blown away dish after dish. We started with beautifully prepared soup, served in individual portions so we tried a few different soups. My favourite was the cordycep, fish maw broth which was flavourful. The tea leaf duck and roast pork were tasty and done well. The Yuzu prawns and sea perch with miso sauce were DELICIOUS and I would definitely return for these dishes.

The only dish that we did not enjoy much was the Claypot rice, as it lacked flavour.

The price of the meal commensurates the good quality of food.. will definitely recommend Xin cuisine to anyone who appreciates good Cantonese food."
Cantonese Cuisine near Zion Road,"Went to Xin Cuisine last night for dinner with family for the first time. The staff service was very good. Ordered roast pork, signature duck, fish soup, and some veg. Overall food were ok except for the Kai Lan with Ginger soup which was too salty.

Best regards
Tony"
Disappointed,The rice rolls was thicker than my face. Honestly the food doesn't meet up to my expectation. The signature duck with tea leave was average. Congee portion way too small. Omg the xiao long bao pork smells like something gone bad inside the pork. Not sure it it's mixed with salted fish. Not my kind of dim sum. Only thing nice was the lime sorbet desert and barbecue pork bun.
"Comfort food, slightly pricey","Good food must be a reasons why Xin has been around for many years.

Ambience has been updated but nothing really outstanding or lavish. Still very comfortable.

Service wasn't refined and elegant, but was friendly and welcoming.

Food:
Ginseng Chicken Soup - A very fine soup, though not the best.
Scotland Peking Duck - Outstanding duck quality, Peking duck wrapper was on the thick side.
Ginger Kai Lan - Not the best dish of the evening
Stir-fried Pork Neck in XO Sauce - Star of the show. Would definitely order this on every return visit.
Grilled Perch with Miso - Good quality fish, well-executed, slightly small portion.
Lemongrass Jelly with Lime Sorbet - Quite a refreshing palate cleanser.

Prices are definitely on the very high side. Expect to spend upwards of S$65 per person, including taxes."
Delicious food with nice ambience,Dim sum very fresh & nice food presentation. Many varieties of dim sum. Service staff very polite. We did not order from the ala Carte menu but will visit again.
Birthday lunch,I celebrated my birthday with my family here. Booking was easy with their online reservation system. Service was great. We ordered dim sum and some ala Carte dishes. Must try is the roast duck tea leaves immersed. The duck was succulent and non-greasy. The dim sum arrived timely. They had no problem with the birthday cake we brought. Sang the birthday song for me! All in all we had a great time. Thank you Xin for making my birthday special!!
Great food,"Located on the 4th floor of the Holiday Inn Singapore Atrium, this Chinese restaurant serves very good Chinese food and is fairly priced in pleasant surroundings."
Comforting & Affordable Meal,We enjoyed our meal there especially their signature dish- Poached Rice with Seafood broth. The overall service was good and the serving time was efficient. We finished our meal within 40 minutes. It was pretty fast!
A gem in Havelock Road,Tucked away in Havelock Road is this gem of a restaurant. Serving up authentic Cantonese cuisine which is both delicious and affordable.. Good ambience and service as well.
As usual excellence food n service,"Came on a public holiday for lunch. Restaurant was full but staff never fail to deliver efficient services as usual. Although they were working on a fast pace, but still always served with a smile...Great Job."
Ever obliging,"The servers were extremely patient and when we needed extra utensils or extra orders, they undertook without feeling troubled or irritated."
Awesome Experience,This is an expensive option but if you love non vegetarian food then do try their duck and pork preparations. The food is superior in taste and the service is impeccable. Do not miss if you are staying in this hotel
"Awesome food, excellent service!","Great food, e bbq meat platter is a must order. Awesome service provided by e staff too, especially from Alvin. You can surely trust him for food recommendations. Highly recommended!"
"""Crab"" dinner","Xin is usually one of our favourite place for dinner. Somehow tonight dinner was poor. Keep in mind that we have a 80+ lady with us.
Sevice was seen as the poorest time as none attend to us from we sat down at a table. Waited for good 8-10mins for a waitress to approach us for asking the drink and hand in the menu.
We were curious about its National Day promotion of crab, so we made an order. Was told that it will be 1.1kg weight but the dish served to us did not tally with the said weight. Chilli sauce taste was good as we told them not to make so spicy. Main point was that the meat crab was not meaty at all. Expressed twice to waitress and manager/superviosr regarding the quality, the manager/supervisor simply replied would feedback to sipplier?!
Good thing we had Eatigo discount but still feel that the experience was at the bottom."
Wonderful menu with very good service,"Compare to my last visit here about a year ago, great improvement in term of food and services. Old staff with new management shown great service and excellent food selection. Hope that the standard can maintain for long...Keep it up...."
Very good service,"Nice food, good services, nice place, nice people, especially the student intern Mr. Brian Zeyu, nice guy. Strongly recommended!"
Excellent service,"Decoration was good and staffs are all friendly. Fish is fresh and tasty, good place for family and friends"
Wonderful bespoke menu,"Came here for a family dinner and was bowled over by the wonderful service of the staff and the creative, special menu created. The staff was incredibly attentive and the chef also came over personally to check on how we found the food, very nice touch. The dishes were great, especially the coffee ribs and claypot rice. Would recommend this restaurant for Cantonese fine dining."
Sunday Dinner,Lovely and excellent cuisine!! Highly impressed with Chef Dennis and Chef Lee's dishes!! Also great service by the staff here. My favourites are the coffee pork ribs and the coconut abalone soup! Highly creative dishes which look great too! Strongly recommended for family dinners!
Best Chinese restaurant in town .,"Beijing duck, sea braised cucumber tofu, fried chicken, steamed seafood beehoon. These are the few dishes that I highly recommend. Good value, nice food. We like Chef Lee and Chef Daniel Teo recommendations. They are full of creativity. Excellent service team led by Alvin, Ivy, Carmen. Received excellent service from them."
Sunday dim sum lunch,Was at Xin for last sunday dim sum lunch with family.the dim sum was excellent& the signature roast duck with tea leaves too.staff cheerful & efficient.I found Carmen the assistant manager very helpful & attentive.we enjoyed the experience & definitely return for more meals
Good Food with Great Service,Was here last week with family. Very traditional Cantonese cuisine served in a warm and friendly restaurant. Staff always willing to assist whenever we wanted somethings. Manager Alvin and teams provide an excellent dining experience throughout our meal. He shared with us a lot of food knowledge which you can hardly find in other restaurant. Great job and will come back for more visits... Keep it up...
"Amazing food, Great staff and atmosphere","Xin has been my go-to place to satisfy my craving for Cantonese cuisine for almost two years; the food is consistently good regardless of time and day of the week, and the staff are always warm, friendly and helpful, much like a family. Their innovative style adds variety and surprise to typical dim sum and Cantonese dishes. My favourite alacarte items are their 避风塘烧鸡 (roast chicken) and 烧味三拼 (trio barbecue plate)."
Wonderful!,"The food here was amazing and I would really visit again! The staff were so kind and friendly, greeting us with a bright smile across their faces. The dishes they serve are of top notch quality, extremely fresh and hot. I can't help but write this feedback as their service were really fabulous! I would like to specially compliment Carmen, Ivy and Kinki. They were so courteous and never hesitated to serve us! Great job!"
Good food and good service,"Like the restaurant, the food and the staff. Price is very competitive and the spacing between tables is comfortable. Though the location is a bit out of the way but there will be an MRT close by soon."
Fantastic service and food,"We had a very good dinner tonight with friends . Xin Cruisine 's service is great , thanks Carmen and Ivy for the great introduction of new dishes: we had yellow tailed fish on clay pot, truffle mee poh , all very well done . We finished with a plate of very cute Merlion manto ( compliments from the house ). The cook is of good standard . Highly recommended."
Great food and great service,"Their must try dish is their tea leaf roast duck. It's the most fragrant roast duck I've ever seen and the tea leaf infusion makes it a very unique Cantonese roast duck unlike any others. Another dish I really enjoy is their Yusu infused prawns. It's tangy sweet and sour with a slightly crusty exterior and is really superb. Your dining experience will be made even more special by the staff members they employ. I've become a regular there and I've come to know them well. Their supervisory staff of Alvin, Carmen and Ivy are all great people who makes the extra effort to ensure you'll have a great time. All the other supporting staff are also great people."
Nice chinese food with very reasonable price & great service,"Had our friends gathering at Xin Cuisine recently. was recommended by a friend of ours to give it a try. We all love the claypot tanghoon, steamed chicken with mushroom and Chinese sausages which was recommended by Alvin.

Great service, always ensuring our requests are met.

Will definitely go back again."
Delicious Chinese Cuisine,Delicious and affordable if using the Amex Platinum Card. Very nice atmosphere and comfortable seating. Look forward to my next visit.
