Good food and value for money,"Love this restaurant and service is excellent.
Food_____Beef Brisket is a must try and the spring rolls is the bomb I always end up ordering more for the corn bread with smoked butter ____Im drooling thinking about that fluffy cornbread melts into your mouth :) yum, and the cheeseburger is the must order too. nothing beats that juicy tender meat and oozing with cheese.
its a good place if you're a meat eater"
Lukewarm food.,"Lukewarm food, staff told us they need the table back at 2pm. 3 couples were squeezed onto a long table even tho there was plenty of tables."
Perfect place to hangout,"The food is good, excellent service. Good location. A good place go out with friends But floor is very slippery and a bit cram."
Kinda disappointed,"I have high expectations, however the brisket and pork ribs I ordered were dry and kinda disappointing. The best thing I had was the wagyu beef burger, which were really juicy.

: Their staff are attentive and friendly too.

The aircond is leaking and could see mould on the ceiling, staff try to wipe it away (without us telling her). The floor is so slippery!! Seriously, they should improve on this. The staff is aware and give us a heads up to be extra careful too which was really nice of them. I would suggest the management to invest to upkeep their environment as I can tell the staff are trying they best to keep it clean."
No fries with burger?,"I have never came across a restaurant that serves a burger without fries. Especially when the burger is priced at $20++.

But at this restaurant - where the brisket 'sandwich' comes in lukewarm small (about 3 in diameter) brioche, it is so. It was such a shock - but unfortunately, uncorrectable. You just have to order a whole serving - which however was for a small group of 3-4 persons.

I went on a Fri, without a reservation, arriving about 11.45am. Immediately, I was informed that I must vacate my seat by 1pm.

The filling (about 6 slices of brisket) wasn't too bad - but again, my whole burger was so lukewarm - I was tempted to send it back. But thought better of it, and decided to just finish the meal.

When I tried to order wine by the glass, 2 of the 4 listed wines were not available. So just had to settle for 3rd choice.

In summary, while the brisket was not too bad, the whole experience just felt the restaurant was over-hyped. In my view, a solo customer generally don't take 2 hrs to finish a meal.

Worse was not including a small serving of fries with the burger. Then serving my burger lukewarm. And not having stock of the wines you have listed.....

Not quite a happy experience."
Authentic American BBQ in Singapore,"Excellent smoked BBQ and authentic southern flavoured brisket and ribs. Great service, good seating and a good place for meetings."
Meats were disappointing,"The premium meat platter we ordered for 4 ppl failed to impress. The entrées were good, but mains were subpar for a place supposedly known for their meats. 2 out of the 4 meats were edible while the others were either dry or too sweet. Also we wanted to have coffee after dinner, and since meatsmith does not serve it, we went to the store opposite to get it. Once we got back, we were informed that the coffee smell was too strong and asked to consume it at the side of the road (?!) After spending 600+ bucks at this place, we will not be coming back."
Very disappointing,"Third time eating at Meatsmith. This time, food was soso only, tasted like they have dropped standard. Ordered the meat platter for 2, amount to $150. The portion was quite small. The pork ribs were very tough, had to spit out a couple of times. Corn bread, Beef brisket were still good. Didn't have a good time there as the staffs weren't friendly, especially the purple-haired woman. Was trying to claim chope vouchers but didn't know how it works so when I bought it and have her come over, she told me ""don't touch the phone, I do something first"" I was shocked.

Don't really write reviews often, but it was my partner's birthday, and a really disappointing one. Overall, will not be back."
Good food but prices has doubled since covid.,Prices doubled quietly and couldnt use my chope vouchers despite specifying in my chope reservation that I would be using it.
Dinner,"Food was good and staff service is good. However i am annoyed with the booking which requires credit card and it may take 5-7 days time to refund. Also would appreciate if we can be seated at the booking time, as that is the purpose of booking not walk in."
Overpaid,"The bill is around $80 per person.
We ordered platter and additional ribeye steak (asked for medium rare but got medium/well done).

The most annoying part is my card is overcharged by $75 (charged by Chope during booking). Sent message to Meatsmith’s IG account but so far no response."
Delivery service so slow,I ordered delivery. The restaurant is 15 minutes away by car but 45 minutes by public transport. When I called the restaurant they said they would check with the driver. When the driver called me he was on the MRT as I could hear the announcement of the doors closing. Our dinner order arrived one hour after promised and 2.5 hours after ordering. Of course the food was cold. Distance for delivery must be taken into account. I wasted over $100.
Authorization reversal,Food was nice but have yet to receive the authorization amount 100 till date. Noted that no deduction but the amount was I hold by bank and has yet to reverse back to my bank account.
Cold Steak,Quality strip loin was spoiled as it was cold. As my meal arrived last the decision was to return it to be reheated or eat at the same time as everyone else. I prioritised everyone else’s enjoyment and didn’t delay them. The steak itself was otherwise excellent but will avoid the restaurant in future due to the poor kitchen management.
Meat place,"Delicious food and relaxing ambiance. Why not 5 stars? The staff should have informed that the order (starter and main course) would come all together. In sum, long wait for both platters arriving together. Next time I will know how to deal with their system."
"Meat Smith, but Not Much Meat","We sat outside, to soak in the atmosphere,
Our waiter was lovely, great chap
We went for the $75 per head banquet,
I’m my opinion the food was just average,
Calling the restaurant “meat smith” and ordering the banquet, I thought there would have been plenty of meat?, No the hero on the main course was a lamb chop (1), nice but just ok,
Ordering wine, the waiter knew nothing about wine, that’s fine for a cafe, I would expect more for a restaurant charging these prices for wine."
"Uninterested service staff, overpriced, very sour salad","First impression at the door- the phrase FOR YOUR INFORMATION a was used. We had to leave within one and a half hour. It could have been put more gently and in a friendlier tone. I felt pretty unwelcome. The meat items I ordered , pork ribs, beef brisket and pulled pork sandwich was pretty good but the portion was very small for the price. The kale salad I had was good in terms of ingredient mix but the cider was too heavy. The first taste that hit my palate was…. SOUR… very sour. They could actually serve the salad with the dressing on the side so that patrons can choose how much of the dressing they would like in their salad. Otherwise, overall, cleanliness is ok. The music was terribly loud tho, should tone down a few notches. Overall I’ll rate this place a pass. 3/5"
Business meeting dinner. Had private dining room. Loved the time there,"I had dinner at the Jakarta location last night. Was great. Very good steak, great side dishes. Service was top notch. Outstanding dinner. Also has quick pickup burgers in lower level. If you are in Jakarta and want a great steak this is the place"
The dining experience has left me completely afraid of ever going back. Please do not dine here.,"From arriving to waiting for my booked table to ordering, receiving the food and the service (including paying). Everything was a disaster. I could be a little forgiving and suggest to not dine in but take away their food especially if it is their Tuesday cheeseburger offer days.

We had a group of five for a quick lunch and I requested for a small platter and firmly stated we would order food individually and sides.

We were instead served a 375++ platter for five which came in an appetizer plate followed by the main platter which came 1.5hours later after all our individual food orders and sides had already come.

The platter was massive and served very late without caution. We all were already full We had to pack everything or risk the food wastage. A total nightmare of a lunch."
Not the restaurant it was,"This was once one of my favourite restaurants, unfortunately it has seriously declined. We ordered at 7:15 and our food didn't arrive for over an hour. No updates, no apologies, no bread to at least keep us going while we waited. After asking several times when our food would arrive it when it finally did it was largely forgettable and surprisingly cold. As an apology we were offered a 20% discount on one bottle of wine, which really wasn't good enough. They need to get back to basics, and focus on food and service!"
Juicy meat!,"Waitress made no fuss and was spot on with her recommendations. Juicy home made sausage, flavourfull. The kale salad - a pleasant surprise. It's taste allows us to enjoy the ribs without feeling oily. Food is great though price a little on the high side."
Not Worth,"Don’t go if you think it might be good since this restaurant is under Burnt Ends. The seasoning is overwhelming and the taste of the meat is very strange. I think is because they cook the meat over 14 or 18 hours. So if you are a meat lover, this is not the place. Unless you are a salt lover or sauce lover. The price is also way more expensive by comparing to the serving size. So, don’t go unless you want to waste money."
A cheeseburger 2nd to none,"Every mouthful bursts with juices and flavors. The bacon is well mixed in the meat patty and accompanied by two soft buns. The sweet crunchy pickles complements the saltiness of the meat patty perfectly, Only downside is that it does not come with any sides for a $16 burger."
Awesome food & service by Jac,"We ordered the mother of platter , and all the meats are so good, moist, tasty, amazing! Jac attended to us, & she's very knowledgeable about the food & explaining to us. She's v friendly too. We had a great time!"
Worst online experience,"I must imagine they lose 90% of potential revenue and no one there try's to order like a patron.

Useless.

Good luck.

Got once and burger was smallest burger I've seen and average but try to support and you can't order as worst software versions ever!"
Delicious meal,"It’s was crowded that day as Singapore just allowed 5 pax fully vaxx to gather. Had dinner with my friend, lovely meal. Friendly and attentive staff. Food was delicious. We loved it."
Certainly terrible via Grab delivery,"Took 30mins from leaving the restaurant to arriving as multiple deliveries which is on Grab.

Arrived barley warm burger, soggy bread, warm can of coke and a bad of cold fries also not the fries I ordered.

Regardless the burgers are shockingly small for the price.

Over all very disappointing and don't order delivery is my advice."
"excellent service, disappointing food","Excellent service, staff made us feel comfortable and attended to. However rather disappointing meat."
Never again,"Platters were disgustingly overpriced for what was offered. Extremely poor value for money. Service definitely wasn't great either, took a long time to get anyone's attention. Food was so-so, especially given the price. Following the restaurant's advice, we took the time to pre-order and yet the food was served at least 20-30mins later and that was after a reminder to the wait staff."
Great food! Hip ambience,Visited twice. Food were great and we all like the Kona Big wave! Purchase the voucher and save 10%. Busy night on Friday. Remember to make a reservation
Great burgers!,The service was good and the burger was mind blowing. We had a great time! Would definitely come back again
A Brisket-smoking class is in order...,"And throw in a double cheese-burger during break time :) Do let us know if this is ever in the pipeline cos I'd love to be the first in line to sign up for it. Better yet, a one-on-one would be the ultimate experience! I'd give an arm and a leg for that because I'm your biggest Brisket fan! You know it is da bomb! And thanks to you folks at Meatsmith, I have constant wet dreams about it. In the meantime, I'll be looking forward to my next home delivery!"
Juicy Cheeseburger,"Their MS cheeseburger was exceptional. Using potato buns, the flavourful double patties came with ample American Sliced Cheddar Cheese. This combination was enough to make it a winner."
Not worth it.,"Ordered takeaway today from Meatsmith. The size of their beef brisket burger was exactly 2 mouthfuls and that was it. At the prices they charge, never again. To top it off, they short delivered 1 item and mis-delivered a wrong item."
Fookin hell,"That was the beer we ordered.
Food was so so soooo good! Got the mother of all platter! Everything was amazing!!! Servers and bartenders were friendly! We were mainly served by Mr Mani. Place was busy but the wide smile never left his face! That’s what we call amazing customer service!! Hope you guys increase his pay soon, he totally deserves a recognition"
"Great food, attentive service","Had bbq craving and decided to head to Meatsmith to satisfy it. The ribs and brisket reminded me of the ones we had in Austin, tender and full of flavour. The pastrimi burnt ends were nice, salty, and I could taste some peppercorn on them. The smoked butter was out of the world! The warm corn bread was already delicious on its' own, but the butter and honey elevated it to another level.
The staff were attentive, always ensuring that our water cups were filled, and even took the trouble to entertain our little one. Will definitely be back for more meats soon!"
Very Good Service but Meat was dry,It was a crowded Saturday evening at 5.30. Noisy Rock music was blasting away. Service was very good but our pork ribs and brisket were dry and stringy. The fries were good though.
Excellent service,"Service delivered from Ganesh was top notch. Excellent asset to the team, very attentive and knowledgeable!"
Waited for 30mins with reservation.,"Waited for 30mins with reservation. Also, asked us change seats during just dinner started. No suggestion for a birthday plate even if Caucasians and you guys sang a birthday song. Never come back even if there’s nice meat. Definitely choose Burnt End. The boy with comb head and bold Indian aren’t friendly."
Long wait for at best average food,"Booked well in advance and yet had to wait for our table. Then was asked to move tables after we had sat for at least 10 mins so they could accommodate other guests - would have thought planning would be better given you even have to provide a credit card at time of booking . First dish of two spring rolls took 40 mins to arrive then another 25 min wait for the rest of the food. No one seemed in charge in the kitchen - a lot of time spent moving chits around rather than getting the food out. Arrived 730pm and left 930pm and without any lingering, that’s how slow and poor the whole experience was. Burger was good; everything else really not worth the wait at all."
Cartilage in wagyu cheeseburger,"Bad experience at meatsmith today. Encountered a large cartilage in my wagyu cheeseburger, as large as a 20cent coin. Completely ruined the whole burger experience, waiter took the burger to the chef and best part is they returned me back saying that it is safe to eat it. Point is im not expecting something hard in my cheeseburger, there shouldnt even be such a big cartilage in the burger in the first place. Terrible chef. Staff were nice to not charge the burger which both me and my wife stopped eating after as we completely lost appetite. Staff were nice to not charge my burger and i appreciate that but will never return here again. Completely put off by the chef's response."
Great food and excellent service!,"Service was great. The ambiance was nice, although the music was quite loud. We had the Platter for 2 which was very tasty. Improvement would be to increase the portion of pork belly - was extremely small. The other components were spot on. Well done and keep up the great work"
Average service and food,"Music was so loud, could barely hear any conversation. Everything was very over salted, ribs were cold when served. Service also average, for the prices being charged I think it can be considered to be a restaurant and I would expect a certain level of service. However wait staff never seem to be looking at diners and always needed to be flagged down. And they seem to only do one thing when they approach the table. E.g. would bring the drinks or plates but walk away immediately without asking if we were ready to order."
Amazing Meat-ing place!,"Celebrated my son's birthday over dinner at Meatsmith Telok Ayer and ordered the platter that came with the appetizers. Not only were the portions more than enough even on the portions of barbeque for the Tomahawk and beef briskets, they were right on the texture and flavors and the service was excellent as they guided us really well on the portions and not to over order. Got to come again for the cheese burger and pastramis. Want to acknowledge the great help we got from Jac who was attentive and really explain to us how best to enjoy the barbeque including our 打包 back home! Rem to make reservations before you go and I was fortunate in that they were kind enough to allow for one more persons to join us 2 hours before hand."
Always a fun night out,"We really appreciate how the staffs are friendly and professional. Went there on christmas eve and ordered a 1.4kg Tomahawk steak, well roasted, succulent with the right amount of fats. Enjoyed some starters of scotch quail eggs with caviar and deliciously baked corn bread. The corn bread was so good we ordered more to take away.

Our meal was paired with Pabst Blue Ribbon lager and some bourbon old fashioned. The staff offered us some shots to round off the evening in merry good spirits!

Would love to see more underrated cuts of steaks on the menu like denver, tri tip, flatiron and with higher marbling score.

Special mention to Fiona and Kaye for making our evening a memorable one !"
Worth the price,"We got the platter for 2. Added on the fries and Mac & cheese. The meats were done so well. Tender and well seasoned. The fries were done right. Mac & cheese was just nice. We loved the cornbread and the pickles at the side. We couldn’t finish our food. I guess only the cocktails could have been better, felt very watered down."
"No fuss, no frill. Straight to business.",They mean serious business when it comes to meat. I had a lovely brisket that left me wanting more. Yum
Top quality,"Can't fault either the food or the service. Having not had the good fortune to sample Burnt Ends Meat Smith represents the best barbecue in Singapore. Incredibly juicy and tender meats, perfectly cooked, together with sumptuous sides and an outstanding array of bourbon marshalled by an equally outstanding bar manager. Great service from all the service and always the warmest welcome. Long may Meat Smith continue!"
"Food is great, service not so.",Food is great! Had the burgers and they definitely did not disappoint! Room for improvement on service aspect. I had difficulty calling in to make amendments to my reservation and also had to wait in line despite having a booking (noticed other patrons also had the same experience).
"Good food, great service","Was recommended with a set lunch when I wasn’t aware of the option. Good food, good service, enjoyed the visit. One constructed feedback if I may add is abt the slippery floor. Almost fell twice, I’m sure this would be an easy fix."
Great Hang Out,"Super relaxed venue - food is good quality for what you pay - but a great hang out. Don't expect fine dining, but if your chatting and with friends its a good spot."
"Fear food, great Service at affordable price !","Great place to chill with family and friends. Variety of meat choice from beef, pork and chicken. Chooses the 5 pax platter and you get to try the different type of meats. Typical American style bbq meat : tomahawk, ribs, chicken and served with corn bread. You get 20% discount of your wine if you chose the 5 pax platter.. limited choice of wine and I would at the precise is reasonable with amount of meat served. We enjoyed it especially Jac service is excellent till she kind of rich us to pay the bill at 845pm as another group is waiting.. but she realised we were there for my son birthday celebration.. she quickly said no worry till we blow our cake ! A bit cramp but overall great service ..."
Friendly staffs,Me and my friend got flooded with the services and the food is amazing! Must go for the tenderloin and wine choices are great as well. Will definitely pay another visit again next time👌🏻
Certainly lived up to its name!,The beef ribs and brisket that we ordered were slowly cooked to very tender and moist. The burnt ends and brisket nachos were excellent too. I also appreciate the friendly and attentive staff at this outlet.
Amazing marmalade burger and,"Amazing marmalade burger and our favourite. We can tell this based on our travel experience throughout the globe. Hands down this is the best. However only issue is the delivery which really is not the fault of the restaurant but instead their delivery partner Lalamove/oddle who took more than 2 hours to deliver due to multiple deliveries. Maybe such a move by delivery partners are cheap and cost effective but customers don’t get the right food experience as quality goes down the longer the food is in transit. We reported the issue to the restaurant. Kei from the restaurant gave us a callback, addressed our concerns and gracefully rectified by redoing the whole order for next day. We are happy customers and all thanks to Kei. We will continue to support."
"Great food, great service!","We ordered the platter for 2 and it was amazing. Our server recommended to have the cheese burger as well, which we initially thought was too much, but we’re glad we took her advice! She also recommended the Creme Brûlée to finish off. Food was amazing and the atmosphere was great! Shout out to Fiona our server for looking after us! Thanks again!"
"I would not call it steak. It is roast beef at most, uncooked roast beef, to be precise.","Ordered Wague beef steak. Then we were informed that it will take 45 mins to cook it in the oven to medium. It should be called roasted beef then, not steak...... Did not enjoy this uncooked meat from oven."
This meat's myth lives up to the hype,"Great food, great service, great setting. Hard to fault :)
Torrential rain meant they were short of seats, but it was handled beautifully, staff were pro-active, attentive without being overbearing, and best of all, good fun. Meat was superb - my girlfriend said the veges were good too"
Disappointing,"My partner and I were craving some barbecued meats and we decided on Meatsmith for dinner - his first experience here; the last time I diner in was 2018.
We ordered the beef brisket nachos and pastrami burnt ends to start - the nachos were fine, but the pickled cabbage that came with the burnt ends just tasted of vinegar and the sauce was basically just mayonnaise.
For entrees, we had the beef brisket and pork ribs, as well as a side of cornbread. The cornbread was perhaps the best bite of the night - gently perfumed, perfectly sweet and savory from the salted butter on the side. The beef brisket we would like to forget - it was dry, insipid, and the peppercorns were all we could taste for the rest of the meal. The sauce it came with was equally uninspiring. The ribs were tender, but the glaze was too sweet and the side salad was overdressed.
The Smores tart for dessert was fairly tasty, but did not quite taste like Smores.
Overall, the food was disappointing in taste and portion sizes were on the smaller side - definitely not worth the money. Combined with the exceedingly long waiting time, the only saving grace was the fantastic service (and the cornbread, which deserves a second mention). I don't think I would be in a hurry to come back any time soon, unless the food quality and portion sizes improve."
Saturday At Meatsmith,"Take note inspite of requesting for indoor seating when pre-booking, the restaurant if full will provide you with outdoor seating.
It was raining when we went and were provided wit an outdoor seating arrangement.
We received our food before our drinks arrived.They provided water to start.
The experience was good and the food was excellent.
Would definitely go back again."
Slow service,Unfortunately the service was terribly slow on the Monday PH lunchtime. We arrived a little before midday and I don't think our main courses arrived until 1.20pm or so. I believe this was due to the kitchen working on too many food deliveries/pick ups.
🍔🥗,"Delicious 🍔, the double patties were nicely done; tender and juicy. And not forgetting the Romaine salad which was a perfect pairing with the 🍔!"
Great food great vibe,"Brilliant little gem of a place full recommend, especially the short beef chop. A singapore must and one for all."
Could be better,"We ordered the meat platter for 2 and portions were just nice. Food was pretty good but they got cold really quickly with 2 fans blowing straight at us. The restaurant also ran out of their cheeseburger by 6pm which was a little surprising since dinner just started, what a pity.

Made a reservation for indoor seating but was given outdoor seats instead, restaurant mentioned that is not guaranteed, so do take note. Probably okay for group of friends or family, but definitely hoped for a better atmosphere since it was a date night. Also, long waiting time (about 40mins - 1 hour) for the food. Overall, many things could have been better!"
Get your safe entry act together,"We were ignored at the entrance and despite after sharing our reservation info and yet they served someone who came after us.

Requested for lukewarm water but I was served with iced cold water and when I asked again, it was tap water. I gave up.

Thank goodness, the overall food was nice enough, however, the mac and cheese tasted abit stale."
Ordered the pull pork burger,"Ordered the pull pork burger and beef brisket. Pull pork burger was so average with chunks of tough pork. The beef brisket is terrible, dried, felt overnight and extremely tough. Skip at all cost."
lunch,"ordered lunch takeaway, combo meal, smores tart and lemon meringue. delicious burger and fries. will be back soon."
Love it!,"Read a review of this place... in times like this.. coved-19 lockdown... and with cravings for a good burger..
This is definitely a surprise! We ordered online for a meal for 2 - (A) with 2 burgers, fries, slaw, spring rolls, wings @ $54..
Chose “pick up” rather then delivery..

When I first took the burgers out from it’s wrapping.. I was stunned!
It’s so small!
Took my first bite.. and it was OMG! We had a Fried chicken sandwich and a cheeseburger... they were simply delicious.
Both has its own “awesomeness”... but my personal preference leaned toward the cheeseburger ... it’s simple perfect!
I really supposed.. for big eaters.. the meal seemed small...
But between my missus and myself... slaw and wings were left over.. it was just too filling..
And we wanna enjoy the food rather than gorge!

Overall... amazing experience.. will be back!"
Carnivores delight,Decided to partake in platter for two. Our fav was the brisket. The cornbread had a smoky taste making it even more scrumptious. I love veggies to and the romaine salad was uniquely tasty. I’ll be back!
"Second visit, great service and food","First visit was a dinner on a weekday so it was relatively quiet. But because it was quiet, they took the time to talk to us and explain about the food. Second visit was busy office lunch hour. Despite being busy, water was filled without having to ask. My pork ribs were delicious! My colleague’s burger too. Always love their tasty fries! Just on the pricier side but very worth the price!!"
BBQ Fix in CBD,"Always packed and service isn't the best but we were compensated for our wait. Foodwise its pretty decent, loved the brisket and burnt ends in the platter."
Great Burgers - maybe a bit bigger portions for starters,"nothing to say on quality of food - awesome flavors, rustic presentation which fits the place, buzzing place for sure - Service sometimes is hot and miss, had a business lunch thus we waited for a while for our items to arrive. other than that it was great and will be back for sure"
Great food and great service,"A great dinner and drinks place for friends and family. The atmosphere is friendly and relaxed, service is really good."
Excellent BBQ in Singapore,"Really good Texas style beef brisket- probably the best in Singapore. The Pork Belly and Pastrami Burnt Ends were also delicious; only wish they were a larger portion. Great specialty cocktails (Old Fashioned, Smoked Negroni). Friendly staff. The only downside is I think the Meats and Platters selections are overpriced."
"Always fantastic, especially for a great burger!","I have dined at Meatsmith several times, and have always had a fantastic experience. Even before my meals the service has been great, they're quick to reply to any emails I send and questions I have about their hours or menu, which I really appreciate!

The food is consistently excellent; the cornbread, mac and cheese, brisket spring rolls, ribs and beef brisket are always well-prepared and delicious. On my most recent visit earlier this week I finally made it down for lunch so had a chance to try the beef marmalade burger. I was particularly excited about this as the beef marmalade at Burnt Ends is my favourite of their dishes, so I was thrilled to be able to try it on the famous Meatsmith burger. And even these high expectations were exceeded. This is probably the best burger I've had in Singapore! It was perfect, the patty was cooked medium and was juicy and moist but held together well, the cheese was perfectly melted, the burger sauce was delicious, the housemade pickles nicely acidic and the brioche bun was buttery and soft, but still held up to all the burger juices. And the highlight of course was that beef marmalade! Just as good as Burnt Ends, and the perfect sweet accompaniment to the rest of the burger. The combination was amazing. I added on crinkle cut fries which were crispy outside, soft inside, and well seasoned, and ended my meal with the s'mores, which were a small but tasty way to end the meal.

Service was top notch as always, even though they were super busy the staff were attentive, checked in to ensure I was enjoying my meal, and refilled my water glass unprompted. Meatsmith remains one of my favourite spots in Singapore when I'm craving some great American style bbq and burgers."
Simply the BEST Cheeseburger in SG.,"I've been going to Meatsmith on a regular basis for the last 2 years and it's simply an excellent experience every time. Their Cheeseburger is a Singapore ""MUST"". Potato flour bun, owned made pickles, beef patty and a perfect assembly. Their appetizers I would go for their version of spring rolls and burnt end pastrami. Their staff is super nice and hardworking. Shot out to James and Kenny who are delivering a consistent, yet friendly service experience."
Great Daily Specials,"Fantastic daily specials with different $10 sandwiches from Monday to Thursday. The quality of the food isn't compromised one bit. A must visit if you are into burgers, meat and sandwiches."
Great BBQ and the sharing platter was excellent,"Went along with my wife, daughter and a work colleague from the UK for a late Sunday lunch. Restaurant is in a good location on Telok Ayer st with a nice ambiance (& some good 80s tunes :-) )
The BBQ is the star though with a number of great meat options barbecued to perfection. We had a Meat Platter for 3 and it was exceptional - a number of really tasty cuts of meet all expertly flavoured. The Burnt ends were the stand out closely followed by the Buffalo wings...
Supported by decent side dishes and some interesting beers and soft drinks - I'd highly recommend it."
Sharing platter was excellent,"Sharing platter was excellent especially the brisket which melted in your mouth. Cheeseburger was amazing, one of the best ever and on the night we went was only SGD10"
The Real Deal,"Possibly the best smoked rib and meat joint in Singapore.
The burger is absolutely phenomenal and sits up there in the top 3 or 4 in Singapore. So good and juicy, and the bread it sits between is excellent. No condiments needed when eating this one!
The beef brisket delivers and so do the beers on tap. Try the Kona for something smooth and slightly fruity.
Also look for the famous fried chicken burger which is not on the menu and only served on discretion.
Highly recommend this place."
Quantity not quality,"The quality of the meats and their sauces are fantastic. Even the spring rolls were properly crispy.

My only grouse will be the portioning - we ordered a platter for 2 for S$90 and the food given was miniscule (see pic for reference):

Two pieces of pork belly
4 ribs
2 springrolls
1 slice of beef brisket
2 pieces of pastrami
2 chicken wings

This is more a platter for one and I can’t imagine how small their platter for one looks like. Left the joint hungry and disappointed despite the excellent cooking and taste."
Great for casual business lunch,"Excellent accommodative, unobtrusive service for a casual business lunch. And the food. What can we say, its Meatsmith. The blend of spices goes very well, especially the starters."
"Great Service, but food portion is small","Service is very good, taste is good, but food portion is very small considering the price. I ordered smoked beef brisket, ($22), came beef maybe 100g, with 2 tablespoon of coleslaw, and BBQ sauce ina small metal tray."
Too busy,Went there but too busy and noisy. Difficult to sit down for a meal. Price also not the most competitive in the area.
"Good service, average variety of food","Saturday lunch, variety average, but the meat was really tender! The good is pricey, considering the portion. Good service, but a pretty loud (noisy) atmosphere to be seated inside. Worth a go for the meat, but not a place I'd frequent."
Truly the best cheeseburger in Singapore,"Now I know why Iron Man craves cheeseburgers - if this cheeseburger is truly the American standard, then I also want to eat it all the time. The smokiness and full, rich flavour of the beef brisket patty is simply unparalleled. Combined with the splendid cheese and superb potato bun, this burger sets the high water mark for me. The corn bread here is fantastic as well. I am most definitely dining here again and again."
Favourite restaurant in Singapore,This is my 4th visit to Meatsmith- and also we have visited Little India meatsmith twice. Faultless every time. Meat quality is second to none. Service superb. Great value for money. This is our go to. Can’t recomend more highly. You have to try.
Great place,"Loved this little place and the smoked meats were amazing, especially so far from America! Service was decent and venue nice. I would recommend to my American friends who miss their barbecue."
Food was good,The food platter seemed small but was very filling. Food was barbecued well but the veggies on the side seemed tad too sour as it was pickled. The food was delicious.
Disappointing Beef Rib!,"I tried the beef rib and was very disappointed. First, it was served cold. Also, it seemed rather dry and possibly because it was left too long. The battered onion rings were very crispy and fresh. The price paid $48 is unjustified for the quality and taste offered."
Singapore stopover,Third visit to Meat Smith and again loved the experience. This time for lunch. Wanted to go to the Little India outlet but it was closed on Mondays. My wife loved her first visit. We shared a platter
Eat your meats,Highly recommended to secure a reservation because this is a popular joint for many yuppies and family. Meat literally falls off the bone. Good flavor. Yummy burgers. I wish the portion of the watermelon salad would be larger.
Not bad but busy,"Went there for a family birthday celebration - 10 pax. It was packed out with diners and really noisy but we enjoyed the atmosphere. Service was as good as they could be under the busy circumstances - drinks came quickly but food took a little longer. Food was great and worth the wait. Starters wee a little small
But very tasty. Short rib flavourful but a little fatty. Watermelon salad fantastic! All in all a great nice was had by all"
I will be back!,The title speaks alot about my view for this restaurant. One of the best burgers I had in SG (and i had tried a pretty decent no of burgers). Must visit on tuesday cos their cheese burgers are going for only $10 all day. Another fav is the pork belly. Very tender and jam packed w flavour. Will be back to try other offerings!
Very busy restaurant,"Know about this restaurant from a TV show featured their juicy beef few months ago. Made reservation for my wife birthday a day in advance. 1pm was a wrong time on Friday. The whole restaurant fully packed and all waitresses and waiters were running around. I appreciated one of the waitresses stopped and talked to us and I suggested to come when the crowd is lesser.
We ordered the platter and cheese burger. The platter is a good choice for us to try everything in small portion, we wouldn't order it again since we don't really like everything on the plate. Cheese burger is delicious despite the size is definitely not American size.
We will come back to try other dishes but for sure not on any important occasion like birthday, anniversary or major celebration."
Pleasant,"Food was rather salty for me. Overall tasty. Meat well cooked, waiting time was slightly Long due to peak dinner timing. Staff are friendly."
Tender Meat and nice environment,"The variety of meat is good and the meat is cooked just nice, not too over cooked. The service is good with attention to details"
Excellent Cheeseburger,"Return visit after a few years. Still a great spot. Cheeseburger, dirty fries, meat platter, snacks and beers for 3 people; $150 is great value I reckon"
Never disappoint,"We are regulars at Meatsmith and come here at least once a month. (Sometimes we even come here once a week!) We kept coming back for their great food and service. Always consistent, of good quality and value for money. The staff always accommodate to our special requests like dressing on the side etc and we always feel very well taken care here."
meat heaven,"we've been lucky enough to find a table without a reservation on our last night in Singapore. the 15 minutes wait definitely worthed. slow-cooked meat, with great taste and texture, very friendly staff, fine atmosphere, kids friendly. what else can you ask for?"
