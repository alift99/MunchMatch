Nami - one of the best Japanese artisanal cuisines,Nami is one of the best Japanese artisanal culinary haven. Their creations are outstanding and command the senses. Paired with exceptional sake. The staff is well versed in the dishes and are the epitome of the training of their chef from Yokohama. His imagination stretches to the plate and pours into a degustation menu that leaves one craving for the next iteration forthcoming from the menu. By far a great place to start a culinary journey into Japan at Sakura season.
"Fantastic Japanese Food, Super knowlegedable Manager","Arrived at noon yesterday for a Japanese set lunch at Nami, which has temporarily been relocated to Valley Wing, State Room. Ordered the Una Jyu set for myself and it was flawlessly executed. The Manager on duty was super knowledgeable about the food served, giving details on Nami's fish delivery schedule (so you can enjoy the freshest sashimi, if you so wish) and recommended a very nice Konacha with very subtle flavours that paired perfectly with the food. The restaurant setting at the State Room was understably less impressive than the original location, but the food is still fantastic. Will return again soon."
Always a Delight!,"Finally back here after a long while and first time dining in their new temporary location at the Valley Wing State Room. A totally different ambience without the high floor view, now it is a cozy setting with a garden view.

Got to love how fresh all the ingredients used in each were and thank you so much to the manager, Sim, for doing a sake pairing course meal for us. It was truly a magical meal.

Now I am already looking forward to my next visit there!!!"
Classic Japanese & Friendly Staff & comfortable place at hotel Shangri-La,"Superb like they sashimi and uni üòçüòçfresh and comfortable place with they service very good ,friendly ... specially mention they manager Mr Sim and Rox feel like at home üëçüèºüëçüèº"
7-course Sakura Snapper Dinner Set!,"This is our very first visit to NAMI. We have their 7-course Sakura Snapper Dinner Set (S$128++/pax), with Sake pairing (S$38++/pax). We are really impress with the high quality of the food and services, and we‚Äôll be back to try their more premium Yukidoke Dinner Set (S$168++/pax)!

According to staff, they fly in their seafood every Wednesday, Friday and Sunday, if you want the freshest ingredients! Both sets available till end of June 2021. If you drive, they also provide parking coupon."
Weekend Lunch,"I missed the former Japanese restaurant ""Nadaman"" that had been part of Shangri-la Hotel for ages, hence had given a try at Nami. It turned out to be a mixed-shift dining hall which occupied a room of the ballroom at Valley Wing and there is no ambience resembling a fine Japanese restaurant.

Had tried their Una-Jyu set lunch. The quality of the grilled unagi with pinch of japanese sancho is okay and we also quite liked their foie gras chawanmushi. We would like to commend the friendly and attentive service rendered by Rox and Krystal led by their supervisor Mr Sim.

Overall, it's quite a decent set lunch with good service though I would still prefer the defunct Nadaman."
Lunch Date with Jerina and co.,We had the Tsubaki lunch set. It was really gooooooooooooooooooood. I was blown away by the monkfish liver and the sashimi. Amazing. Thanks Jerina!
Good food & service,"Sashimi is very fresh, udon very qq
Service staff is very friendly & attentive.
Worth the visit and value for money.."
Good service,"Restaurant manager, Sim, is very friendly and professional. We truly enjoyed our dining experience. The food is fantastic and delicious."
Excellent Service,"Very excellent service from the staff especially Mr. Sim. He did a very good job, very patient and we are very enjoy our dinner time in Nami."
Fresh sashimi and good service!,Fresh sashimi and good service! Will come back again for more. Highly recommended! Thank you Sim and Rox!
Good foodÔΩû,"very good dinner Ôºå it was fantastic night , sashimi was fresh , overall I will like to give , staff Sim ,Rox , Diren very knowledgeable and give us a beautiful night."
Wonderful Japanese Food and Service,"The food at Nami is absolutely spectacular! Everything was just brilliant and spot on. The Tsubaki Set was absolutely fresh and delicious! Service by Sim, Rox and Diren made it even better! However, the standout moment was when chef Kian Huat from the kitchen team took a moment of his time to step out into the dining room to ensure that everything was flawless. To have a busy chef do this sort of initiative is just exceptional. We will most certainly be back!"
Best Japanese food ever!,"Had an awesome dinner with my family at Nami. How could the seafood be so fresh that for a moment I thought I was having my dinner in Hokkaido. Sashimi and sushi was so good, not forgetting the meat n other food. Service by Sim and his team was splendid too. They were prompt in giving their utmost attention to every details and requirements requested by us. What a great dinner at such reasonable price paid. We will definitely be back again for more good food."
Great Lunch ~Japanese Food,"Tsubaki set is awesome!!!!! $68++ got foie gras cawan mushi, sashimi got uni!!!! And I mentioned today is my friend birthday ,Nami staff (Sim,Rox,Diren) very kind and helpful, there prepare a small cake for my friend , her like it so much~
Anyway Nami will be my lunch place in this few day"
Best Japanese meal ever,"I had dinner with my family
Best Japanese meal ever especially those fresh fish and meats from Japan"
Amazing Japanese restaurants,"Amazing Japanese restaurants in Singapore . My family very like the friendly staff -sim and Rox ....they are so funny and take care of my daughter!
Foods was good and we love the ‚ÄúAoi‚Äù assorted sashimi-YUMMY!
My daughter and dad like the Kagoshima pork shoigayaki !!! We will come back soon =]"
Nami Restaurant,"Excellent service and great food in this Japanese Restaurant. Mr Sim was very attentive and always making sure that our teas and sake were top up.
The chef came out personally to introduce himself to various table making sure we are happy with the food. Few restaurants in Singapore gives such personal touch. Will definitely be back again !
Friends that we recommended loves it."
Absolutely phenomenal,"I visited Nami on the 12th February for dinner and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed at all! My family and I were absolutely thrilled with the overall ambience of the restaurant and the food as well. The Amori Gobo Chips and the California Roll is a must try for sure! However what made this experience even more memorable was the service rendered by Sim, Rox and Diren. They were extremely hospitable towards me and my family always making sure that we were fine at all times without fail. We will most definitely be back!"
Excellent Food snd Services,"We can‚Äôt stop coming back to Nami. You deserve the recommendation for good food and services.

See you soon !"
Nice View & Food,"Good service and nice food. Sim and Rox are the server today. Appreciate that. We are enjoy the view, food and service at there."
Great restaurant with delicious food and perfect service,"Have been there for a few times. The service there is always excellent. Sim is so nice and friendly!
Very glad that they reopen at the State Room in the Valley Wing in end Dec, 2020. The lobsters and kegani crabs came in fresh from Japan and were prepared with great care and attention. And the taste is superb!

Highly recommended for both business and special occasions."
Nice food! Nice staffs!,"Went to Nami with my friends during lunch, set lunch is valuable and so delicious! Manager Sim is so helpful and good recommendations for the food. Rox is so attentively during our lunch. Really enjoy the service and food at Nami!"
Lunch was superb with my family,"Lunch was superb with my family on this quiet Sunday afternoon. Food was exquisite and service was great. Special mention to Sim, Rox and Diren for their attentive care to all our needs. Will definitely come back."
Delicious food at nami restaurant,Sim and Rox they are very friendly. Delicious food with good service. Definitely will come back again!
Nice new Nami,Had lunch today at Nami on their second day of business at the State Room in the Valley Wing. Pleased to see the old crew and the new menu. Selected the Tsubaki set comprising choice sashimi which we enjoyed tremendously. Ordered a small sake to accompany lunch which paired very well. Prices are not low but reasonable for the quality you get.
Fantastic New Menu,"Good Ambience, Great New Dishes! Fantastic customer service to Mr Sim and Ms Teresa Lim. Head Chef is friendly and chat with all guests!"
Lovely Nami dinner located at Origin Grill premises,"Japanese food from Nami is now being served at the Origin Grill premises. Sim in particular was a great host and he and his team took very good care of my family and even my kids. The truffle foie gras chawanmushi, lobster with uni aioli and Ikura rice stuffed back into the lobster shell; starter of wagyu roll topped with uni and tempura are recommended."
An experience!,"Friend wanted us to try Nami, but unfortunately during this Phase 2 period, we could have the food and service of Nami, but at Origin Grill.

We ordered the 2 sets available, the Fumizuki and Togetsu and coz of our preferences, the staff, Sim, made all the necessary adjustments for us.
The quality of the food was fantastic, the service was genuine and it was lovely spending a Sunday night dining in. Sim had all the necessary recommendations for us, from sakes to food, and he switched between English and Mandarin when he heard us speaking both at the same time, making the experience causal but definitely feel good for us.

We spent four and a half hours dining, adding on a platter from Origin Grill as well which despite Sim being more well versed in the Japanese cuisine, was able to explain to her the platter as well.

Definitely a very good experience and we can‚Äôt wait for Nami to open and dine in Nami soon! :)"
Divine wagyu beef,"Went for the chef‚Äôs lunch course which included the most divine, melt-in-your-mouth wagyu beef. Service was attentive; I was one of two guests during lunch service as many are staying away because of Covid-19. Shame that the restaurant will be closed for the month of April‚Äôs"
Had the 5 course set menu,Had the 5 course set menu which was great. Krystal was an amazing waitress and made our experience incredibly memorable. Great views too!
Birthday lunch with hubby,"We had the lunch mini course and Shokado box. The food was good, I liked the sushimi best. The waitress serving us also took the effort to introduce every course served for the lunch mini course.
The restaurant is not very big and every table has got gorgeous views as it is located on the 24th floor. Service was impeccable. As I indicated on my reservation that is was my hubby's birthday, the restaurant served a complimentary cake which was quite substantial, we couldn't finish the cake.
We were served by Krystal, Sim and Wendy"
Lovely restaurant on the 24th floor with a awesome view,"Lovely restaurant located on 24th floor of the Shangri La Hotel. Was charmed by the gorgeous view of Orchard Road and equally charmed by all the impeccable service.
It‚Äôs less expensive at lunch, where one can choose to splurge on Omakase or select one of the excellent set lunches priced around $60 . Both my husband‚Äôs sashimi set and my I angus chuck steak in teriyaki sauce were delicious."
It can't get better than this,"Tremendous lunch at the Nami restaurant,

Very good food. Although I am sure good, we stayed of Sushi and Sashimi and went for the amazing Kagoshima Fish Cake, Ikura, Saga Beef and Grilled Cod with Unagi Ikura Rice washed down with Sencha tea.

On the top floor of the Shangri-la it has good views"
Good experience,"Great food and service. Was served a complimentary cake for anniversary celebration. Nice gesture. Served by Krystal, Wendy and Rishaban."
Intimate Birthday Dinner,"Always our top choice as Nami has a good selection of dishes for vegetarians.

Sashimi and sushi were good but would have been better if bigger slices of fish were served. With the $95 sushi platter, we were expecting a little more.

Will still return, especially for the vegetarian sushi"
Enjoyable dining but expected more WOW factor,"The restaurant wins both on service (very attentive, efficient, pleasant and proactive) and ambience (modern, music not loud, air conditioning perfect and the best is the marvelous view). As regards the food, we both ordered sushi omakase and it was fresh, tasty and well plated. The dessert was an assortment of Japanese fruits which we like a lot since we are not into sweets. However, I expected to be wowed by our sushi omakase. I just expected a bit more excitement from an omakase but in that it did not deliver. My spouse ordered a sake pairing which he enjoyed except for the first sake which was a sparkling sake. I then had it and it was really not sparkling - just gassy - like an aerated drink. Halfway through the meal the waiter asked us how‚Äôs the pairing and we gave our feedback and we were pleasantly surprised they replaced the sparkling sake with a glass of Veuve Clicquot champagne. That was greatly appreciated. All in all, an enjoyable dinner!"
Two thumbs up!,"First time at Nami and really happy with the food and service!

Restaurant Manager was really helpful and his positive energy made it an even more wonderful evening for my husband and I.

Sashimi was really fresh and well presented.

My husband‚Äôs vegetarian dishes were superb too!

Grilled fish was perfectly made!

Will return again!"
Impressive Japanese Restaurant with a Magnificent View,"Upon arriving on the 24th floor of the Shangri-La Hotel, we were warmly greeted by the staff and led to a lovely corner table. We had made reservations.The staff were amazing and the food was impeccable. We had sashimi, sushi (was told it had just been flown in that day.. fresh shipment from Japan every Tues, Wed, Fri and Sat), assorted tempura and lovely ice cream to finish. Will definitely be back for the Omakase Menu at $200 or $280 per person for 9 courses."
Best Japanese restaurant in Singapore,"The hotel is located at level 24 of the Tower Wing Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore.
Nice restaurant design. It offers a wonderful view of almost all of Singapore, up to Malaysia. Great service.
Most importantly, a large selection of fresh fish and seafood.
All dishes are well decorated and very tasty.
Many thanks to all the restaurant staff.
In such places you want to return."
Not real Japanese,"Nice view, not so bad food and service, but not real Japanese restaurant. J-pop music and Happi which is worn by staffs are definitely none in Japanese 5star hotels."
Dashi magic,Great restaurant with very nice and friendly staff and superb food. Dashi is expertly prepared and features in a number of dishes. The executive set lunches offer good value. The view is very good too.
Only good for the view,"Fantastic view from the 24th floor of the Shangri La Hotel! A comfortably sized restaurant with table seats and counter seating -there's also a lovely outdoor terrace which is not being utilized or promoted to diners. Let's start with the interior which has been cheaply decorated and doesn't represent a Japanese restaurant by any means. We asked to be seated at the counter hoping to engage with the chefs and watch our food being prepared. Bad idea as both chefs were grumpy and rather unfriendly. They didn't speak a word to us and didn't even welcome us when we took our seats. The welcome is common practice in an authentic Japanese restaurant. The chefs didn't make any recommendations from the menu so we went along and ordered what we thought would be good. Taste wise, it was average and the presentation was average too. The staff need training - they don't seem to understand the menu well enough to make recommendations. There were two managers at the restaurant but they seemed rather busy with each other and were not bothered about their diners. No Japanese chef in sight so the chances of us having an authentic Japanese dining experience... Extensive sake menu but no sake sommelier on hand to give advice and recommendations. Disappointing from start to finish."
Disappointing,"Food was not up to standard. The sukiyaki beef is of poor quality and the sauce does not taste like sukiyaki sauce. We used to patronise Nadaman which closed down and Nami took over. Not only was the price higher, the overall service was poor and the food quality was disappointing."
Food is very good,"Had lunch on Easter Sunday.

Great views & food was very fresh & delicious.

Only thing was that since our table was right at the end of the restaurant, we were left with empty tea cups most of the time. Even after a plate of food was served, no one bothered at all. A pity as it‚Äôs not up to par in an establishment like yours.

We came in at 1:30pm, so basically most tables had finished eating."
Wonderful lunch at Nami,"Every food was perfect.
There are atmosphere very good and have nice view.
Especailly staff are so lovely!
Thanks to chef Alpha, bella, sim and rox."
Lunch at Nami,"We had the lunch sets - Shokado box and Beef Komiyaki. For a restaurant of Nami‚Äôs hype, the food was ok but certainly not exceptional especially the beef which was likely seasoned and a bit dry. The restaurant was half full but service was not attentive. We waited about 15 mins for the beef set and the Shokado box came 10 mins later. The best part of the meal is the ice cream, save to say we wont be rushing back there anytime soon for our next meal"
Dinner,"My wife and I recently had a great dining experience at Nami, thanks to the Manager Matt Sim. He recommended the dishes for the evening and we enjoyed them very much. Perched on the 24th level of the Shangri-La Singapore, this Japanese restaurant has a great view of the lush surrounding that enhances the dining experience. The food is fresh and authentic and the prices are competitive amongst top end Japanese restaurants. Throughout the evening, Matt and his team were attentive to our needs and responded to our various requests promptly. A place on our must-go list certainly."
Well priced lunch sets of high quality,"Restaurant dining room was bright and pleasant overlooking the lovely greenery of the neighbourhood. There was a good selection of lunch sets priced from affordable to deluxe. We opted for the mid size lunch box and really enjoyed the selection of dishes. In fact, I would advise female lunchers to decline the bowl of white rice. The sashimi was extremely fresh, the tempura ever so lightly battered - the fish & sweet potato were outstanding, grilled fish that was fresh & not overcooked, 6-8 vinegered dishes that were all delicious, chawan mushi cooked in a tasty dashi and yummy braised root vegetables. The meal ended on a high note with a choice of ice cream. We opted for yuzu and black sesame which were outstanding. Will be returning for lunch when craving Japanese cuisine."
Consistently good,"The food here is always fresh. For lunch, the sets are very good value. The view is my favorite feature of the restaurant. I never tire of it and I come here whenever I need a break on a weekday. The ambience is pleasant and one can be a conversation without being disturbed. Staff are attentive and pleasant."
Way too pricy for the quality and quantity,I visited this place with my colleague on an official visit. Two of us had dinner in this restaurant for $ 550 and we were still hungry !!!! The SGD 200 wagyu beef serving was not more that 100 gms ( approx) and similar portion for all other as well. Only the prawn tempura serving was as per usual serving . The quality was not that outstanding to be this pricy for this such poor quantity. Drinks were also pricy . I would request fellow travellers to think before choosing this restaurant for dinner cause it might cause a reasonable dent to your wallet :). Set menu can be tried but we were told that there were not enough time left for us to go for set menus which was probably $ 230 per person starting price . ( you need min 2 hours to enjoy set menu dinner ).
Lovely Dinner,The 3 adults had the Kyushu Omakase and 1 kid had the kid‚Äôs bento. Very happy with our choices as the dishes were tasty and of good quality ingredients. The beef was outstanding. The omakase is plenty and we were stuffed before the meal ended. Very happy we found this restaurant although it took 3 years of living in Singapore to find it. Nami is now top on our list of Japanese restaurants in Singapore.
Perfect booking service,"I called up the phone number in Google to book a table. But the number was for The Central booking desk of Shangrila hotel which was closed about an hour ago. I called up hotel front desk and asked if I can book with Nami directly. Front desk transferred me to the restaurant and restaurant took my reservation although it is a procedure every one should call to The Central booking desk. And it was just 10 min before the restaurant was closed!

After the booking the restaurant sent me a photo for the menus over WhatsApp. Very appreciated to such a detail service - at such a late hour when every one must be busy to close the shop!"
Nice night out,Beautiful view of the city from atop the hotel. The food was well prepard in the dining room kitchen. Great sushi menu. We wish there was more chicken on the menu as it is a bit limited to those who are not sushi eaters. All in all a good night. Staff including the chef were great.
Lunch with a view,"Exceeded expectations, food was really fine and well prepared. Pricing very accurate, staff kind. And above all - there is an amazing view."
Top notch,"Very solid choice at top floor of recently renovated Shangri-La Singapore. Was by myself on a business trip and sat at the sushi bar. The full range of Japanese food with impeccable quality and very solid wine list. Magnificent views - need to sit at table, not at sushi bar for that."
Waste of money,"Highly priced for less than mediocre food. We were a table of four adults with varying tastes so we selected a wide variety of food. None of us had anything good to say about the dishes in terms of taste or ever presentation.

The prices exorbitant especially when taking into the account the type of food they served."
Hits and misses,"We ordered2 sets of executive lunch. For those with big appetites, it is not quite sufficient. service standards were not consistent, noticed that the ladies from the other tables were offered a bag holder for their handbags, we were not.The Japanese male staff was extremely polite right from the start but that cannot be said of the remaining staff. The other staff who overheard our conversation in the elevator on our way down that we had forgotten to get a complimentary parking ticket very quickly told us that he will arrange for one on the ground floor! Excellent! Perhaps on our next visit we will order from the ala carte menu or try the set lunches. Meal on the whole was tasty!"
Great service and great staff!,"Had lunch with my 2 gals and the service staff were very attentive and helpful! food was great with a fantastic view. Would like to comment that service staff Sim, Bella, Rox and Rosie were great to help me with the food order, carpark coupon and buds voucher! Keep up the good service! Will definitely be back for lunch!"
Good Japanese Food with breathtaking view,"Located at the 24th floor of the Shangrila, this Restuarant has a breathtaking view of the Orchard Road area. The service is excellent as well as the selection of Japanese sushi and set menu"
Great People with Great Food!,"Came for a quick lunch and I'm amazed by the amazing hospitality of the people there. All staffs are so friendly fom the beginning till the end. Thank you Sim, Fanny, Mei, Jenny, Jessie and Rosie for the enjoyable visit. Will definitely be back again for the people, food and view!"
great jpn lunch,so nice value lunch! here we can have real jpn foods exprience in singapore. especially SASHIMI jpn fish quality is so good! staff and chef also very friendly. you can ask them what tasty is!
A modern touch to Japanese fine dining,"Nami replaces Nadaman which had been at Shangri-la Hotel for decades. While Nadaman offered a more traditional Japanese restaurant setting, Nami has a modern touch in terms of its decoration. Nami, being on level 24 also offers a good view of the residential areas around the hotel. The food at Nami is very good, similar to what Nadaman offered. We had the Shakado Box, the Kaisen Don and Australian Angus beef Komiyaki. On a previous occasion, I had a kaiseki course lunch which was excellent. One area where improvement can be made is the level of service. We thought the service staff could have been a little more attentive. For example, we had to request for our tea and water to be topped up on a couple of occasions. Other than this little wrinkle, we had an enjoyable dinning experience at Nami."
Fine dining Japanese style,"After eating at Nadaman for many years I thought that would be a hard act to follow but they nailed it !!
Nami has it all‚Äîgreat food with friendly efficient service & topped off by a wonderful view & ambience .
Recommend the miso soup , sashimi platter , soft shell crab & Japanese pickles"
"Love the ambience, excellent service!","Well planned proposal done by my fianc√© and Nami staffs. The food was awesome and staffs were attentive to our needs. Special thanks to Sim and Bella for helping to put up the decorations and preparing a cake and bouquet for me :‚Äô) it‚Äôs definitely a day to remember. It‚Äôs not my first time here, and definitely not my last! Kudos to the team"
Lunch,"Amy, emi & fanny attend to us with tea and our meal fast and quick food was warm and yummy too.... they are also very attend to us very fast and quick too"
Awesome view and food!,Visited by my self but still very comfortable and the food is awesome! The head chef and all the staff are very kind and the view is beautiful as well. Would want to come back with my partner.
Dashi Appreciation Art,Never knew the art of making dashi is so intricate using the different ingredients. The quality of the ingredients also matters. We were introduced to the taste of the different grades of konbu and kasuo and supermarket mix - big difference in taste. At the end we were treated to a delicious lunch using the dashi. Umami! It makes me realize I must appreciate Japanese broth more when I drink it in the restaurant and remember the huge time and effort spent in making it.
My best Japanese lunch,"I signed up for a dashi appreciation course conducted by Japanese Executive Chef Shigeo Akiba, after which a group of ladies and i were treated to a dashi themed lunch. It was the best Japanese lunch I have ever had, because the soup base was really 'out of this world' superior.

We had quite an 'education' on quality of ingredients, and when Chef Akiba served us Ichiban Dashi, we went ooh and aah. It was a revelation. It will not be difficult to refuse commercial quality dashi from now on.

Although a four course lunch was part of the deal, we were generously treated to two extra courses....wow !!!

Chawanmushi, supposedly a familiar dish, tasted quite amazing. And the simmered beef dish was really good. We had even a real surprise with the diced fresh fruit dessert - it was treated with dashi, which I didnt think possible.

Service was equally superb, with Restaurant Manager Tekezumi Ando explaining Japanese culinary terms and translating Japanese ingredients, as well as making sure we were comfortable and asking whether we had enough to eat. Thanks also to Kian Huat ( I am not sure of his rank) who also assisted.

And we all sat at the bar counter, which I think is the best seat in the house. I had a glass of excellent (sweet potato) shochu to go with my lunch. Oh, I almost forgot to mention: since Nami is on the 24th floor, guests get a fantastic view of the city as well.

I would fully recommend Nami for its food quality and service."
Food quality is superb fresh and knowledgeable staffs.,"We had a department appreciation lunch at the Nami restaurant in Shangri-la Hotel, Singapore.
Very cosy restaurant with great view.
The staffs are very friendly and knowledgeable.
The japanese chef is very experience.
We ordered the executive lunch menu, sashimi plater ad 5 types of sushi pater.
The sashimi selections are very fresh. Thumbs up.
The display is very beautifully done.
Cheers to The Nami and to all the friendly staff."
Service Excellent,Service at Nami is excellent especially Staff name Rox who help us with our lunch and our colleague birthday celebration.
excellent service,"Excellent service from all service staff.Kudos for the super great hospitality Especially to fanny&Jenny, keep up the good standard."
Department birthday celebration,Seung Hyun helped to serve the birthday boy birthday cake with a totally good surprise without him knowing good job and keep up with the good job
"Fresh & good quality sashimi, good value lunch sets","The sashimi was excellent - fresh & of good quality. Was quite surprised they offer good value lunch sets ($40-$60) as Nami, located on the 24th floor of the Shangri La seems to be an upmarket Japanese restaurant. I enjoyed the chefs' special too - a combi of wagyu beef slices, uni, truffle & onsen egg on rice. Delicious! With its beautiful view, good service & great food, it's worth a visit."
"Great view, great food and great service!","Upon entering Nami, you will be greeted by a courteous hostess, Kath. She welcomed us and guided us to our seats. Our server, Jenny, warmly welcomed us too and provided us with their menu. Since it was our first time to visit Nami, she recommended us to try their Bento.

When our food was served, our server took time to tell us the names of each food but it was too much for me to remember them all. The taste is excellent, the food they serve is fresh and everything was just perfect.

As for the place and ambiance, it is a combination of Japanese and Western style that is located on the 24th floor of Shangri-la hotel. Other servers, Fanny and Jessie, were also attentive. They always pass by our table asking if everything is okay.

Overall, my dining experience in Nami was exceptional. Great view, great food and great service!"
Good food and service,"We enjoyed a very scrumptious lunch set. Even though it‚Äôs fine dining, they do have kids menu for the little ones. The sashimi was exceptionally good. Air flown from Tsukiji! Service was consistently good too."
"Great food, fab view - Absenteeism service",Whilst staying at the Shangri La we were encouraged to eat at Nami. During the day we popped up to check it out and we were impressed with what we saw. We decided to sit outside as the restaurant was very cold from the air conditioning. We were the only diners on the balcony and we enjoyed the view. The food was great but apart from the delivery of the food we did not see any of the staff. Sadly they did not even think it appropriate to clear the plates that we had finished. With so much choice in Singapore go elsewhere.
Good service but food can be better?,"Given the high prices, the food could be better. Tried three of the suggested chef‚Äôs special. They were tasty not not exceptional. Also had the sashimi, tempura and eel. Again nothing out of the ordinary. Service was very good though. Lovely views."
"Delicious, fresh, good value set lunch","Celebrated our friends' birthdays at this restaurant on the 24th floor of Shangri-la Singapore. Bright and cheery ambience and good views of the city. But we were more interested in the food. We ordered the executive set lunch, sashimi, wagyu with rice and pan-fried tuna head. The sashimi was presented in such a lovely way, so fresh and sweet. The manager, Ando-San, was very attentive and told us the sashimi is air-flown from Tsukiji this morning! He also brought the dashi master, Chef Akiba, out to say hi! The set lunch is fantastic for the price, portion is good. Fresh ingredients, attentive staff, very impressed! Strongly recommend."
The Gem on top of the Shangri-La,"Words fail me. The food was fresh, exquisite and chef's Dashi stock permeated throughout the Omakase meal. The Service was top, as expected from an establishment like the Shangri-la

Sit and enjoy the view from the 24th level and slowly sip your sake as your taste buds experience this symphony of Japanese creation.

#hossanrecommends"
"Great food, ambiance and service!",Me and my friend tried sushi and dashi omakase. Dashi omakase stood out for its unique and authentic flavor. Every dish you will feel the essence of dashi and your server will guide you all the way until you finish the course.
"Great view, great food, great service",Been here several times already and each time Nami never fails to satisfy and impress. Food is amazing and the Shokado Box lunch set is great value for money. Service is fast and professional yet friendly. Strongly recommend.
Birthday dinner for daughter at Nami,"Celebrated my daughter's birthday with a dinner at the restaurant. It has been a LONG time since I went to this restaurant. Initially wanted to go for teppanyaki but think they no longer has it. Still we decided to go ahead and went for it. The food is awesome and yummy! Portion is rather huge even though the pricing is abit on the high side. For that price paid, the food served is definitely worth it! It is sure a great place to celebrate a special occasion. We would love to find a reason to head back there again!"
Excellent Restaurant,My wife and I had a very nice dinner at Nami Japanese Restaurant Singapore last night. The restaurant setting and the view were beautiful and the service was very attentive. The dashi set menu was refreshing and the the dashi soup base was excellent.
Good Food and Good Service,"I and my client sit at sushi counter and had sashimi set lunch. its was excellent. Warm service, nice view and good food"
Spectacular Place,We love to dine and try new food and we found out that there is this restaurant with the nice view and ambiance. Serving the fresh of the freshest fish you can get on the market. Getting their fishes from Tsukiji market and fly all the way here is incredibly awesome for me. Staff and Chef are always on top of service. Great place to be.
My top place to visit for Japanese - 5 Star!,"We had such an amazing time last evening for dinner. This is one of my favorite restaurants for Japanese - with a spectacular view and a stellar service team. We tried the Dashi course menu- ingredients were fresh, presentation was on point and needless to say, we had a superbly amazing dinner date. The staff are friendly and professional- not too intrusive, but always there when you need them. Chef also does not compromise on the quality and presentation. Simply one the best Japanese restaurants to dine at in Singapore as you can go for sashimi, sushi, cooked food as well as sample their extensive range of Sake! Thank you Nami! I‚Äôll be back soon again"
Excellent food,"My husband and I had the Dashi Menu last evening. It was excellent. Attentive service, good view from the 24th floor plus delicious food. Thank you to the chefs and staff."
Very impressive.,"First time here. This restaurant is located at level 24 of Shangri-La hotel and the view is great, especially when I am enjoying delicious and good food. I‚Äôm having the dashi menu that was just launched yesterday and i heard it is only going to be here for 2 weeks!
The soup is well-seasoned and taste just nice.
As for the sashimi, it is very fresh and there‚Äôs no hint of fishy smell at all. Awesome.
The soup is good and and steam custard with udon noodle is amazing. Both taste great and I will never get sick and tired of the food here!
The beef is well-cooked. And I love beef! This is definitely one of my favourite dish.
The corn rice was not bad but not my favourite. But I love the pickles here.
The dessert is sweet but not too sweet. It‚Äôs my 2nd favourite dish of the night!

The service is amazing, especially from Bella and Matt Sim. Matt Sim always make sure my Friend and I are enjoying the dinner. And Bella is awesome with her service. Both of them are a valuable assets to the restaurant as well as to Shangri-La hotel. The rest of the service team are very attentive and friends. Great service I have here tonight!

I totally enjoyed myself tonight.
Totally in love with this place, food and the service here. I‚Äôll definitely come back again.

Thank you very much, Nami!"

Pricey Japanese food,"I have been to many Omakase restaurant. This one is newly opened for 1 year and located at Shangarila hotel. However, the value for the Omakase menu is way too high compare to many other when comparing the food served and quality. Came with 5 type sashimi, 6 types sushi , rice with Okura and Uni, soup , grilled cod fish , seasonal fruit and appetiser that‚Äôs typical other restaurant may serve but serve by piece and not by the whole plate. A bit pricey and the 240++ per pax, you can get a better one in singapore . Service is ok with beautiful view at level 24 of the hotel. Many sake and whiskey to choose from. I would try their ala Carte menu the next time . Good for business and family . However, the counter Chef is not as professional impart to other you would find from other Japanese restaurant . I won‚Äôt come back as it is not worth to eat here at this price and the environment is so bright let you feel like eating at typical Japanese restaurant in the mall."
Unfortunately not a fine dining,"Tempted by their ad ‚ÄúThe art of Japanese fine dining with a view‚Äù we decoded to visit this restaurant. We were three at lunch on Sunday.
Yes, the view was really good and I am sure it gives a better one at night.
Two of us ordered Chef Akiba's lunch course and third one Tenpura set lunch.

Appetizer and sashimi were ok. But soup (osuimono„ÄÅ„ÅäÂê∏„ÅÑÁâ©) was rather let down as neither good flavour nor richness in taste (Umami Êó®„Åø„ÄÅKoku„Ç≥„ÇØ). We can judge with the stock whether the chef is really good or not or experienced or not.
But real disappointment was the main course. As we requested nonmeat item they served scallop in egg soup (Tamagotoji, Âçµ„Å®„Åò). First of all why the chef has to hide the main dish under egg? The scallop was not fresh enough? That was my first thought and why scallop was selected as main was next? Any way when I started eating I felt something wrong. The tenderness and a bit juiciness of scallop were not there but sliced ‚Äòscallop‚Äô was rather chewy like that of cuttlefish. Anyway this main course was total disaster and completely disappointed with the chef.
I wanted complain to the chef but the guests were there so I gave up.

The waiter/waitress came and try to explain each dish but they were in a hurry. They should be trained to explain in detail and at the same time they should know what exactly they are explaining.

The desert too when brought the shape was a bit disturbed. In serving Japanese dish presentation is very important. But they lacked in minor details.
Tenpura set looked rather very ordinary, nothing special and size of prawn quite small. I noticed crab meat sprinkled on Chawanmusi (steamed egg custard, Ëå∂Á¢óËí∏„Åó), which looked good. But I am not sure taste was how good.

There are many other good restaurants which serve better and good food at this cost."
First and Last visit too,"I am a frequent visitor to Shangrila Hotels and enjoy dining at all the Nadaman restaurants.
Nami at Singapore Shangrila was an utter disappointment. Despite the relocation to the top floor, it failed to impress me with the cheap looking furniture and utensils. Sofa seats were also lumpy.
There was only 2 dinner sets available, both priced at s$240. The nami set (170) and tempura set (forgot price) was not available for ordering.
At s$240 , my expectations were high..unfortunately the set was a complete let down and totally unremarkable in taste. The sushi rolls were a total mess, instead of perfectly sliced rolls, the rice was too soft and when it was delivered to us, the rice had squished out from the roll. It looked like an amateur's work. Was surprised how a top japanese restaurant could tolerate such bad presentation.
Anyway, definitely not coming back."
First and last visit,"Arranged for special dinner at this restaurant on the basis of favourable reviews on Google. The omakase dinner priced at S$240 tasted like something you will be served at all mediocre chain Japanese restaurants. We also tried their must-try dish steamed abalone at S$100. It was also mediocre.
The staff tried their best to be nice to us but their best endeavours could not help improve the food quality and taste."
