Good food service and experience,"Good food service and experience, we had a great time and everything was good perfect time and experience with friendly staff"
"Amazing service, good quality food","Its our family’s 6th or 7th CNY reunion dinner at MELT cafe. Although we have other cheaper options, we stick by our trust in MELT cafe as each reunion we can truly enjoy the night gathering as a family with the rush to finish our meal within a stipulated time.

Food service quality has always been consistent. Thats what kept us going back each year as we know we’re in good hand of a great professional team.

Special shout out to Ganesan & Kei. My family deeply appreciate your kind arrange to make an exception to refund 1pax buffet dinner as she caught covid at 11th hour and not able to join us.

Respect & Thank you!
Stay safe and keep up the good work!"
Worth the price,"Underrated and spectacular. Cuisine from a variety of cultures including local cuisines. Everything is kept hot, fresh and refilled. Lovely room. Amazing seafood options from lobster to fresh oysters, even sushi options. I fell in love with the Singaporean Laksa which is so flavorful. At first, it looks like just a buffet - but each 'station' offers such a lovely variety."
Great International Breakfast,You will not find a better breakfast that this anywhere. There is food for most any nationality. There are fresh fruit as well as fresh squeezed juices.
Nice but very chaotic,"Visited the buffet at Melt.

Nice wide range of different options and international cuisines.

Quality is ok.

Service is ok

But when we visited which was the festive period, Melt was extremely busy and therefore rather chaotic and for a buffet arrangement, not sure how Covid friendly it was.

Best best indain food and best service in sg,"I bring my friends again to melt cafe. My friend from Japan miss indian food and I called chef Santosh to prepare a dining for my guest, he is always so busy but he prepare for us. 30 min before I reach Melt cafe I called him and Once I reach chef Santosh and Alex Wong immediately serve us the food and we really enjoy the food. My friends is so happy with the dinner. Wow the indian food and service here is alway so good. Thanks Chef Santosh for such good service and save. Good job . We will come again."
Holiday in Singapore & The best Indian cuisine !,All dishes were super nice! The best curry I have ever tasted. Thanks to Chef Santosh & Mr Alex Ong!!
Melt away in disappointment,"Visited Melt for the first time after 2 years and what a bitter disappointment. The quality of food is just poor with the BBQ station having some lamb chops and prawns, gone are the premium cuts and prawns that one would expect for a buffet at $150net per person. Back in the restaurant, the sheer lack of service is apparent with a robot clearing dirty plates throughout the restaurant and would not be out of place in a hawker centre, but at MO? 5 Star hotels in Singapore has never so disappointed and while typing this sitting here with stomach pain and know as my new years resolution to make a big detour around Melt. Shame as this was our favourite place to go to."
Melt Cafe Staff Excellence,"There were so much food choices! The staff/server service was top notch and would like to specially compliment, Eric Raj for making our experience even more special and we will be back because of him!"
Best ever,"We've been coming to melt for more than 7 years and today's New Year's buffet has been the absolute best. Plump, huge oysters (2 types), palek paneer, astonishing and creative desserts.

We ate so much we couldn't have the birthday cake we brought.

Best ever."
Excellent Service,Our family was really well taken care by the service crew here. Notable mention goes to Vishnu who went the extra mile to make our kids feel delighted with the dining experience. Thanks so much!
Wonderful quality buffet,"It was the first time after COVID and Melt cafe food spread has improved a lot with quality food that is fresh and very well cooked. Services from the staffs were exception! At any point in time when attention is required, they will come to you in less than 10 seconds. Super great job even when the restaurant was almost full. I like to call out Michelle who did a great help as well for the settling of the bill. Thank you and my wife enjoyed her Birthday celebration here."
"Christmas Brunch 2022 - Melt Cafe, Mandarin Oriental","We booked the Melt Cafe because we had been before (outside of Xmas it is exquisite) and wanted an upmarket brunch. Sadly we were disappointed.

They had overbooked it. It was crowded and overpacked and had a terrible atmosphere. People were 'grabby' with the food and much of the good stuff had gone within 1 hour of it starting. The service was ok but the atmosphere was truly dreadful. It appears that they decided to pack it with as many people as possible, irrespective of the consequence this had for the experience. A very poor value for money proposition and would highly recommend not going to the Mandarin for a brunch of any kind. What a disappointment."
Best buffet ever,"Christmas Eve buffet last night was so good,just off the scales in presentation,content,quality,flavour,a chef myself for 48 years,this was the best I have ever seen,the chefs should be very proud of what they achieved last night,thank you for making our Christmas Eve special."
Family Birthday Celebrations,"Excellent service from the time you enter with Roger, Nancy, Alex, Stephen & the team looking after us throughout the meal. Breakfast is an array of choices with chef Santosh, Serene & Pauline providing exceptional food & service to guests.
Our stay was made extra special with the attentive service from all.
Thank you for making our holiday & birthday celebrations extra special. We will return!"
Disappointed with weekday's lunch buffet,"Fresh Oyster is not provided, though it is listed in the menu. Only mini baked cheese oysters are served. If I knew it before, I wouldn't come.
International buffet offering a variety of local cuisines like chicken rice and laksa. But, quite disappointed with the food quality as it's only average."
Nice spread,Went for Saturday lunch buffet. There is a huge spread of food suitable for the whole family. Spoilt for choice.
The staff was friendly and the wide varieties of choice,The staff was friendly and there a varieties of food to choose. My flavour is the double boil chicken soup and the salmon.
Grandson's full month celebration,"Had a wonderful celebration on Sunday (6/11/22) The food spread was fantastic, seafood and sashimi fresh and desserts yummy. Alex,the manager was attentive, helpful and friendly and the service staff especially Emmanuel was efficient and meticulous and kept checking with me if everything was ok. So touched with his kind gesture. Plus with the ambience and good feedbacks from my guests, l am so happy that l chose the right venue. Will strongly recommend Melt to friends."
Excellent night with family,"Wonderful experience with Melt the world cafe.
Service was again top notch special thanks to Rooban, Xin Yin and Alex for the dinner with my family.
Food was great it was busy and full house situation."
Wow,Tastes great got a lot of lobster and the mash very upz and their meltz signature chocolate cake bestest.
Disappointed!!!!,"No oysters! I called n checked if it is everyday. The staff said yes.
When we arrived, NO OYSTERS. It was like a very normal buffet. Even sashimi was only salmon n tiny ebi. Crab n lobster tasted like salted water. I tried cracking, all water splashed onto us.
If i knew there isn't oyster, which was our purpose to try here, we would not have this buffet. It dampened me the moment i sat down. How to eat?"
Good ole old school buffet,"Very happy because they had everything I wanted to eat: lobster, prawns, oysters, beef, lots of desserts… only complaints: crab was still quarter frozen and didn’t taste fresh, and most cooked dishes seemed like just space fillers. Service was excellent though"
standard drops,"i have visited the restaurant many times, the standard drops, use to serve oyster, but no longer but still charge at the price where they serve oyster, food not tasty and low quality, prawn are not peeled, salmon sushi of low quality, the roast meat section is a joke, nobody eat it, as it taste bad, and there is no beef. service is bad, there dont even serve coffee or tea, always say later when you ask for it,"
"Wide spread of food, great service!","Finally returned to Melt Cafe after our covid wedding last year! Buffet spread was huge and of quality, covering various cuisines and fresh seafood like oysters and lobsters. Loved the seabass and naan!

Celebrated my husband's birthday with the family and the staff presented us with a chocolate cake.

Wai Kei, Nancy and team were really helpful, attentive and accomodating! Always a great experience at Mandarin Oriental!"
Great,"Professional and friendly staff, food was flavourful and a very good variety. Overall am pleased with the experience of dining at Melt Café."
Restaurant inside Mandarin hotel,"We had our business dinner for about 40 people.
Wide cuisine.
Service could have been better.
Could spread of deserts.
But limited food options for vegetarians"
Birthday Lunch,I celebrated my birthday here. The food were good and service was fast. The waiters working here are friendly. I had a great dining experience. The deserts were exceptionally well made. Prices are reasonable too. Would definitely come here again.
One of the best in Singapore,"Nothing could possibly go wrong with the MO branding. We had an international buffet dinner here and we were greatly satisfied with both the quality of the ingredients and the choices of food available.

We wanted to try every dish and after some time, we realised that we were too filled up to eat anymore.

Good ambience and great service! Keep it up!"
Good variety and quality,"Went for a Wednesday night dinner. The lobsters and salmon sashimi were good. The variety of Indian food was also better, compared to Edge."
Average experience overall,"Dinner buffet was quite full on a Monday evening. Main draw was the seafood, fresh and popular. Indian food was good and delicious. Service was passable, simple greetings and prompt removal of plates. Overall, an average experience."
Great food and service,"Amazing food and service from Wai Kei. Lobster is delicious, the dessert is fantastic. The staff are friendly."
Great dinner,"Good service staff and regular top up of seafood items. The staff (by the name Kathlyn?) attending to our table was attentive, had good initiative, patient dealing with the kids and accommodating to our request. We also had a small complimentary cake for my wife’s bday."
A decent buffet and service,The quality of the spread is excellent but do not expect a lot of variety of food. I believe more option on hot seafood selection will be a good thing.
"Pleasant dining experience, great food and excellent service!","Outstanding service by Alex and his team. They would always go the extra mile for customer service satisfaction, always checking if everything is in order and service was very prompt. Alex, the manager, definitely made our visit a special and pleasant one as we were here to celebrate a birthday! Food was fantastic, seafood selection and desserts were amazing. We had a terrific time and overall a memorable dining experience. Definitely coming back again and highly recommended."
Lunch buffet at melt cafe,Buffet spread of high quality. Service was impeccable . They acceded to my requests and was very attentive throughout
2nd visit - fantastic experience ! 5/5stars,"Seafood - lobsters and oysters were very fresh , but what stood out was the service. The free flow wine was regularly topped up without asking and plates were swapped often. Thank you to the staff of MELT for the fantastic evening !"
MELT CAFE,It has a great ambience place to dine with family. The buffet has many varieties to suit each palate.
Melt cafe,"The seafood are the best out of all, They're fresh. And their oysters r just. 4 stars because their food variety are not alot.. for a picky eater . A lil pricey from what i've seen in the website because of the service charges. But their service was very good and they're very friendly too ! It might be cheaper if we stayed there but oh wells. And there's an smoking area too which are convenient that u dont have to go down"
Company event,"We went for a company dinner for 50 pax. The experience is good, service is very prompt. Alex, the assistant manager is very helpful and even help in distributing the carpark coupon for my guests. Nancy is very helpful and following up promptly on the sitting arrangement and queries through WhatsApp prior the event. Highly recommended for big group event.

From an organiser point of view"
Awesome service / food,"We had their Sunday brunch. The spread was awesome and food quality was good

Service was impeccable, which makes the whole experience even more enjoyable.

Special mention to Xin Yao & Xin Yin who took care of our table and Executive Sous Chef Davide who personally prepared their roast beef and sent to our table

Lastly Dalila (hopefully i get the spelling right), who came running after us to return our pouch which we have left behind"

Friendly staffs, quality food and lovely hotel."

But we are placed outside a room with many noisy customers inside the room. Shouldn't a private room be enclosed?"

Breakfast of Champions,"The buffet breakfast at Melt was included as part of our package at Mandarin Oriental. The quality, quantity and selection of food provided each morning was exceptional. I would be lucky to have experienced more than half of what was available during my 5 night stay.

Not only was the food and beverages to the highest standard, wait staff were very attentive and their work was always undertaken with a smile. The buffet breakfast was unashamedly the highlight of our MO stay."
Fantastic service,"Thank you for the excellent service provided by your delightful employees, Ganes and Chris. They provided service with a smile. They were a great asset to your company. We had also enjoyed the lavish buffet and my children love the ambiance in melt café. I would definitely recommend to anyone who wish to dine in for sumptuous buffet."
Birthday celebration,"Food variety is fantastic. Oyster is good too. Staff are very hardworking. We were attended by Ganesan, service is good. His warm personality makes us feel at home."
Great great great food...!!!,"We had our breakfast in the melt cafe for two days, it's an amazing experience. There are lot of varieties for every cusine. Staff members are so polite and supportive. I am a pure vegetarian and I had a difficult time finding vegetarian food. But here in melt cafe the head Indian chef Mr. Santosh , he is such a kind person. He attended us privately and asked for our choices and served us with great Indian food of our choice. Taste and experience both were amazing. If you are Indian and want Indian food please try to get in contact with chef Mr Santosh here in melt cafe."
"All the staff is very friendly, it the sea food is just okay,a bit of over cook .","food is just okay,a bit of over cook .but all the staff is very friendly I would give five star for the staff."
Birthday dinner celebration,It was easy to make a reservation and staff were very friendly and courteous upon arrival. Food was great and had an excellent variety to choose from.
Amazing food,"The food is amazing, the selection is wide and very fresh seafood, sashimi and sushi. The dessert are so nice too, recommend the signature melt chocolate cake"
First Time Experience,"Decided to come to Melt Cafe to mark another milestone in life. Had been to various buffets but is first visit here. I must say the food quality and variety is fabulous and is definitely value for money.
The staff here are extremely friendly and proactive which makes the whole dining experience an even pleasant one.
This is definitely now on my to-come- back again list of dining places. Will surely recommend friends and relatives to try food here"
Lunch buffet,Comparing to the edge I would say melt cafe got more variety choice and there is fresh oyster for lunch buffet which I in quite surprise for the price I paid. Service not bad 5 stars. Would come back again for sure.
Excellent Service,"The breakfast at Meltz cafe was very good, was deeply impressed by the service of Jegan who took our repeated drinks order promptly & clearing our plates quickly. Chef Steven for the delicious egg omelette , and chef Jeremy quick service for topping up the food when it was low to make sure I can take the food I wanted. Looking forward to our next stay and visit! ☺️"

Chef Steven for the delicious egg omelette, and chef Jeremy quick service for topping up the food when it was low. Looking forward to our next stay and visit!"
Quality service at Melt Cafe,"Had a wonderful breakfast experience here! The standard of the food was consistent for both days of my stay here!

Special thanks to Jegan who's attentive to our needs and always serving us with great courtesy!"
Attentive Staff from Josiah,Josiah was very attentive. He saw that we were celebrating a special occasion and wanted to extend a complimentary cake for us
New Favourite Place,"Visited Melt Cafe on 9/6/22 for lunch buffet to celebrate Fiancé birthday. We were blown away by the wide selection of food, as well as the awesome service. We truly enjoyed ourselves, so much so we were talking about when we should done here again right after our meal lol! Special thanks to the floor manager and staffs who were on duty on that day."
Pleasant dining experience,"Had a weekday buffet lunch at Melt Cafe. Food was as usual great though varieties weren’t vast. Serving fruit juices and fresh and plump oysters during lunch was a big plus point. Staffs were generally great in service and quick to clear used plates and refill water without requesting.

This lunch was meant to celebrate my birthday. I had indicated that in the special occasion column when making reservation. I indicated it again when I received confirmation email from Melt Cafe 3 days before my lunch reservation. In the confirmation link it also asked for my photo so that the staff could address me by my name upon my arrival. At that moment, I was truly wowed by this extra effort made for guest recognition. Well, I uploaded my photo but disappointingly nothing had happened on the day. No staff recognise or address me by my name when I arrived. It is fine though I wish that if such guest recognition couldn’t be delivered then please don’t even mention it in your system. Also, no birthday cake was offered to me despite me indicating 2 times during my reservation and confirmation. I had redeemed a birthday voucher as a Dining Society member and this was confirmed by the staff at the entrance upon arrival. If the staff had an eye for details they would know that it was a birthday celebration. Yet there was no birthday wishes or cake for me but my neighbouring guests did receive theirs.

Overall it was still a pleasant dining experience just that do not expect too much for guest recognition or birthday celebration."
Excellent experience,"It was a great dining experience. I am bringing my 1 yo baby along for the whole dining, and the crews are all friendly and helpful in getting necessary thing for my baby. Food are fresh and nice. definitely will go again."
Superb service from Staff Xin Yi,Would like to compliment our table service staff Ms Xin Yi. She was very proactive in clearing our table and even ask if my friend would like a double shot when she just asked for an espresso….. she even volunteered to help us take photos without us asking. She was very prompt in serving us with our needs too. Her great initiatives have really made our lunch a real enjoyment! Thank you so much Xin Yi!
Great dinner and service,"Dinner was great, oyster and seafood was fresh. Variety of food was good, but can be better.
Service was great, kudos to service staff Josiah and Boboy."
Lunch on a weekday,"Went on a weekday for lunch with my family and we left happy with the variety and experience for the price we paid. They had fresh oysters, prawns and crabs + salmon sashimi that was topped up regularly. The bread and butter pudding in the dessert section was a standout for me. The cooked food was either too over cooked or not that great but I wasn’t here for that anyway. The young bespectacled waiter was very efficient in clearing our plates and refilling our water. Great experience!"
Buffet Lunch at Melt Cafe,Food was great and fresh. Replenishing effort was prompt. Plate and service was on point. Must say to have fresh and plump oyster for lunch was a present surprise. ! : ) Was celebrating birthday for colleague so overall the experience was wonderful
Pleasant Dinner,"A hotel buffet with no sashimi. Menu says it's only available on weekends, quite different to the other hotel buffets ‍♂️

They have good variety of different cuisines and selections. Cold crabs, oysters, prawns, and lobsters were fresh, good starters. Smoked salmon and trout, salami and wagyu bacon were decent. There was a bread section with good selections of different types.

The Indian dishes were good. Lamb shank was flavoured well, papadoms were a tad too spicy though. Chinese grills like the char siew and roasted pork were so-so, but the laksa was delicious. Sambal fried rice, steamed fish, and stir fried choy sum were good, but the seafood chilli sauce was too salty. The roasted beef and lambs were ok, not overly seasoned and were cooked medium.

There was also a deep-fried snack section with potato chips, onion rings, popiah, and garlic bread so this makes a good restaurant for families with kids.

Frankly speaking there's not much wow-factor. Servers were quite prompt. It was a birthday dinner so the only thing that disappointed us a little bit was the cake came very early without our request. It came when we just started the cold dishes so we were a little taken aback. But otherwise it was a pleasant dinner."
"Excellent service, food quality just normal","Servers was attentive and professional. Restaurant were almost full bring a weekday. Having self service buffet the first time after 2.5 years due to COVID. Service was good and table was cleared every time we pick up a new round of food.
The Food looks delicious, reduce in quantity probably during a weekdays.
Hot carving station most of the meat were dry.
All time favorite laksa taste change including the noodle texture and serve like room temperature although I ate immediately quite disappointing. Salad and cold station doesn’t look appetizing.
Outstanding seafood station, great variety of oyster, Boston lobster, clams and chilled prawn, chef constantly refill once the seafood is getting low.
The all time favorite waffle no longer freshly made, but taste still good.
Great service from Kathleen and Alex.
I felt “extremely” thirsty after the meal. Had 1 liter of water after I reach home, yet still very thirsty.
Not sure is the a lot of MSG or I ate lots of whipped seafood."
Lunch buffet,"Fabulous buffet! A very wide spread of food! Some buffets may sacrifice the quality over quantity but not this. Will like to compliment our server, Vera, for her attentive service! Very helpful!"
Seafood Buffet on weekday,We bought the Mon-Tue lunch buffet voucher. Good value for money. Great seafood - especially for oyster lover. Desert is great too. We spend good two hour eating and enjoy to nice and comfortable setting.
Good service and good food,"Had good food and enjoy the experience here. Teh atmosphere here not bad.
Great service by Jane. Thank you for her service!"
Great service from Jane!,"The food was ok, but the service was definitely great, especially Jane. She was passionate, patient and service oriented. She always has a smile when she approached us and other guests who called for table service."
Family Visit to Melt,"Enjoyed time with family over the weekend in Melt Cafe. Ambience was good and was able to taste different cuisine like Japanese, Indian, Chinese."
Disappointing not worth the price even after discount,"Variety of food is much lesser now, compared to pre covid times. Crabs are not fresh, dont dare to eat. variety of sushi is also very little, oysters are still fresh. rest of the food really avg, better off going ala carte at other places"
Great service but products quality could improve. Not for,"The staff was very attentive to our requests and friendly. Place is clean and tidy.
However, we were a bit disappointed by the quality of the food:
- Oysters were too fat
- crab claws were watery
- Sashimis/sushis choices were very very limited and did not look very attractive (maybe we came too late - 1pm)
- Cheeses were standard (perhaps 4-5 to choose from)

Then we were left with the Indian counter or another counter with a lot of meat.
We found very limited choice of veggies for the buffet whether cooked or uncooked.
If you are vegetarian I do not recommend this place."
Good Friday Lunch,"Had a long awaited family lunch on Good Friday, made all the more enjoyable because of the attentiveness of Service Captain Amy"
Thank you Jane and friend.,"Incredibe range and quality of food. We loved the Oysters, Lobster, Sushi, Curry, Meats, cheeses and everything else. Just superb food and service in a lovely atmosphere. Jane really looked after in very well and was very lovely. The even presented my husband with a birthday cake. Shout out to the patisserie chefs as the Easter themed desserts were just incredible."
Very good food and service !,"Celebrated a friend’s birthday here and we chose the correct location. Staff Regina were super attentive. Compared to other buffet restaurant, the service was really good. Plates were cleared fast, water was refilled consistently. A pleasant experience indeed!"
Dissapointing,"Visited Melt cafe on 11/04/22, most food were cold when served. The only warm dessert that was available, was not even warm when served. Was looking forward to the bread pudding as I did not get to try it on my last visit. Food variety was pathetic compared to the 1st time when I visited last year when it was the lobster special. since then, variety of food has shrink and for $88++ per pax, the food selection was pathetic. Most cooked food was cold when served, even the hot tea was served lukewarm. Service was good throughout but standard of food has to be reviewed seriously."
Service staffs from Melt cafe Mandarin Oriental Singapore,"Great service plus friendly attitude from the cafe staffs as below.

Xin Yi and Tamazi

Hope to see both of you again when we are back for the great buffet meals .

Thank you"
Awesome service by Mila & Xin Yao!,"Had the most enjoyable time at Melt Cafe! It’s been quite some time since we had buffet, and Melt Cafe truly did not disappoint!

Service was excellent! Mila and Xin Yao were friendly and approachable. They were extremely attentive, courteous and helpful. Food was great but the service truly stands out. I would remember this special birthday celebration for a long time to come, due to the excellent service of Mila and Xin Yao.

Seafood buffet selection was awesome too!"

Nice service,Had a pleasant dinner over at melt cafe. Food was good and ambience was great. Would like to specially compliment Josiah for the good service!
Amazing laksa,Lobster laksa here is second to none. It's our family's favorite spot. Service is excellent too. Amex gets you a fifteen percent discount. And Marina Square mall is right next door for a nice stroll after stuffing yourself from the many food option.
Birthday celebration 3 dining in 2 days at Melt Cafe,"21 March is my birthday on 19 March with my family and then 21 March with my friends, I plan to celebrate at melt cafe with my dearest sister and neice that love the food here very much.
Thanks Chef Santosh & all the staff for his hospitality. I love the india. Food here & the chocolate cake. My sister don’t eat indian food outside, she will cry if I buy her indian food but she really love the indian dishes that chef Santosh serve. Met Nancy the old staff back to Melt cafe, she can recognize us come over to greet us and serve us, so long never see her & she still remember us, make us feel the warm in the Resturant, we welcome her back to melt cafe.
I have a very special birthday this year, because I celebrated 3 time in melt cafe, I stay back for biz meeting after lunch & have dinner, celebrated my friend Annie Heong’s birthday at Melt cafe, she love all the food that night, especially tasted the best Indian food that chef Santosh serve.

Good food must eat more haha 21 March I went again to Melt cafe to celebrate my birthday with friends.
Last year Victor and the wife came to Melt to eat indian food & chef Santosh serve them very nice dishes, they really miss the Indain food at Melt cafe so they requested to eat again before they back to Japan, so I celebrated my birthday & victor April birthday & is also our farewell dinner here with the Delicious indian food that Chef Santosh serve.
Chef Santosh, I really want to say ‘thanks to you and your staff for serving all my guest that I bring & I have a wonderful birthday celebration 3 time at melt cafe.

No Regret. I will go again on April to celebrate my daughter birthday."
Excellent,"Although it was COVID period and we need to wait for food to be serve, the food was great and staff was very helpful."
Ms Xin Yao - Excellent Service,"We would like to compliment Ms Xin Yao for her excellent service rendered during our dinner yesterday. She was very attentive n polite; ever-ready to serve every table with a smile.

However, I noticed that a few other team members behind the counters especially at the Japanese and desserts counters look a bit tired when serving the guests. Maybe it would be a good idea to check in with their situation, if any.

Finally, it would be even better if there could be a greater variety of options in the buffet for this price."
Melt Cafe Awesome,We ate a family meal at melt Cafe: the staff couldn’t have been more help (Grace was great) and Chef Santosh made me a special platter - which was absolutely delicious. I would highly recommend Melt Cafe: especially at the end of a stressful week!
"the ""supposedly"" japanese theme dinner","i remember enjoying melt's buffet selection back in the days where alot of meetings were held at the hotel.
i was utterly disappointed.
it is at a $88 per pax japanese theme buffet and you know the jap selection provided is ×2 sashimi (salmon n tuna) x5 sushi and soba. what is this? where is the tempura? in addition, the quality is terrible.
everything tasted frozen. roast beef is one where i only had 1 bite and gave up.

the only edible selection for me was oysters and chilled prawns.

i regretted big time going for this buffet. please do not waste your time too."
