Lunch,It was fantastic food with nice ambiance and humble management. Don’t miss to eat at least once if you are visiting Singapore. I would love to visit again due to very authentic taste. I will remember in a Australia. Thanks.
SHOCKED!,"As someone who has been patronizing this restaurant since it opened in Tanjong Katong Road, I am really dismayed and disappointed with the management of this restaurant. From serving really good food, and friendly staff, this restaurant has consistently lost focus on quality, listening to customers and pricing its products well. Here are some specific examples: Vatan Se has repriced its ""Nan"" and other breads to be at least 40% more expensive than any similar restaurant... a Nan at VS costs upwards of SGD6, whereas most others are pricing it between 3.5 and 4.5. Their Kadhi is terrible: I have had to throw it twice, and despite direct complaints, nothing was reimbursed. The Balti Paneer I just ordered, cost SGD20!!!! Yes, twenty dollars!! And it is terrible! I could go on and on, but I am just too disappointed with this restaurant... my suggestion to everyone: avoid it... there are many great options within few meters and several within 1 km..."
Lunch meet,"Food was excellent, ambience is very nice , papdi chaat and dahi kebabs were excellent ....not to forget the deserts ....just amazing ...loved rabdi , mung daal halva ...awesome ....!"
Vatan se food,We order butter chicken and daal makhani it feel like outstanding same like india authentic taste thank you very much for making my family happy..... Will visit again very soon and would like try more indian food from the menu..
vatan se please bring the taste back,"really gone down taste wise .. i am not sure if the cook is changed. i was a big fan initially for a long time i could not get chance to go. this Saturday we finally went and food was not the same way at all. Samosa was not as good, pani puri was a joke, tea went down on taste."
Party with friends,"Tasty food had Mutton Briyani and veg noodle Great food from vatan se. Will visit again with family and friend and would like to try some more Indian food. Guys if anybody is missing home,should visit once."
"Vatan Se, rustic Indian restaurant","I highly recommend Vatan Se, a rustic and traditional Indian restaurant. It gives an enjoyable experience to all. The food and atmosphere quality is excellent, and the staff are very pleasant. Vatan Se makes you feel like you are in India. Food is served on eco friendly plates. Vatan Se is the place to be if you crave traditional Indian cuisine."
Good authentic indian food,"Good food, authentic north indian taste. Slightly pricey but worth it. Chicken sizzler was really good."
The service of the place is,"The service of the place is terrible. All the servers only care about delivering food and pay no attention to people sitting there. One has to wait at least 10-12 minutes to get a servers attention. Don’t even think about ordering something mid meal because it will easily take 20-25 mins to get a small side also.
Horrible!"
Great authentic North Indian food,"I have tried a wide variety of dishes during the Covid takeaway season and on most occasions have been very happy with my experience. Among them I particularly enjoyed the following that I sampled viz. mutton biryani & Roganjosh, chicken tikka masala and butter chicken , paneer sooley and achari paneer. Ras Malais are very good too. Among their specials I loved Dahi Bhalle, Pani Puree, Jalebis and Matar Kachoris.
This is now , by far , my favorite restaurant for authentic North Indian food in Singapore.
Sadly I have not had an opportunity to dine -in here yet as I only got introduced to this restaurant recently during the lockdown period. Looking forward to even a better experience with the dining -in in the future.

Great food and value,"I really like this restaurant. While no expert in Indian food, quality seems to be very good. No funky colors in the food. I find the Bollywood chicken spectacular, in which one can taste many subtle spices.
I love the fact they encourage people to drop their phone for a discount. There is nothing more sad than tables where people are glued to their phone. They also serve a very nice beer. All this, very reasonably priced."
Kebabs takeaway - what happened😔,"There was a time the food was finger licking good, maybe it is also today but the stuff we got was tasteless and god knows how was it to bad. Veg seekh kebab, mutton seekh kebab had no spices or taste to it. It was crumbling and breaking. The paneer tikka was just ok. Chicken tikka was coloured and bland. I think they should have refused my order if the cook was not there. I am now really scared to burn a sgd 100 hole for 4 dishes with them"
Tasty healthy fresh Punjabi food @ Vatan Se,"All that you could ask for: fresh, quick, nutritious, healthy, tasty, cheap, authentic Punjabi food, good personalised service"

VATAN SE IS SUPER,Simply outstanding. Difficult to describe in words the taste that can be felt only by the tongue and hard to describe an ambience that can only be felt by the heart.

Lunch,Good food. Non spicy. Clean. Ambience is good Service is good. Delivery on time. Meat can be softer.
Vatan se review,"Worst food
We ordered panner tikka and they gave us fried rice with Chinese sweet sauce on the panner
Genuinely disgusting. The kebabs are undercooked Dry and rough texture
Overpriced food
Chana masala has no salt
It takes 30 minutes for the food to come"
So shortchanged,"Been to this restaurant before and was so impressed. My next visit, was sadly very disappointing. Mustard Fish tikka and Chettinard fish curry were made from dory fish that was so thin, frozen and zero taste of any particular taste. Vietnamese Dory fish used for a tikka dish was strange and the fish curry was lacking in any flavors of any chettinardness in all ways. Did not expect this and when we enquired why its dory fish for that price and proportions we were no longer attended to and became non existent to staff. We wont return."
Wholesome fresh and tasty meal,"We had a satisfying dinner. All vegetarian, at the medium spice level we could handle Well done, tasty and most important fresh. Service very good too!"
Good India Food (Watan Se),"We came as a family for a good North Indian meal (Paneer, Chicken, Garlic Naan) and we got just what we wanted. Recommend for North Indian food in Singapore."
