Remains Excellent,"We haven;t been in SIngapore for a while and when we felt like Indian food, we naturally headed back to Shahi Maharani.

The menu has changed since our last visit but they had no problem serving up some of our old favourites from before, which was appreciated.

We found the quality of the food and service to be excellent as usual, but at USD 135 for two with only a couple beers, the prices are now higher than our favourite places in London or New York.

We'll be back for sure now that travel has opened up again but perhaps not as frequently as before.

PS. In fairness, prices in Singapore in general (Hotels, shopping etc) are now shockingly high and amongst the highest anywhere in our experience. This was a surprise because we had thought that fatre Covid, prices would be at reasonable levels. Given that Singapore doesn't really have that much to offer visitors these days, unless tourism is not an important economic sector, we wonder if SIngapore might not face some problems soon?"
Maharani of Indian cuisine,"An absolutely great restaurant serving authentic North Indian cuisine. It is mainly a punjabi food place. It is located in Raffles City mall. It is one of the best food that I have had in India as well as in out of India. The place is very spacious. They have an in-house bar. You need to book a table in advance as it is quite popular and in good demand.
The service is good. The place is clean and neat. The rates in this restaurant is on the higher side but worth it.
They also offer buffet for lunch"
Good food & ambience - Service improvement needed,"went here a couple of times with family & friends. Food a bit pricey but good taste and quantity

however, customer service requires lot of improvement & training(maybe). Supervisory staff especially

our last visit to table n. 43 I was bitten by bedbugs in the couches (ref snaps) upon reporting to 2-supervisors response was a mere shrug and reply that maybe it was brought by some other guests
while generally, guests won't have to interact or experiences limited to food and servers only. But in my last visit it became abundantly clear that service requires a definite upgrade & training. followup actions, hopefully as well so that other guests don't have to suffer through :("
Pretty average food at a high price tag,Starters and main course were pretty bland. Desserts were good. Overall didn't really meet the hype and expectations.
Wanna experience the rudest you can ever imagine? Come on down!! :),"Worst service staff ever. Restaurant was late for a takeaway pick up. And refused to take ownership for the lapse, and refused to admit that it is mistake. Naturally, staff refused to apologise. Totally appalled and flabbergasted. Will never consider patronising this store ever."
Expensive but tasty Indian food in a quiet setting,"We visited Shahi Maharani a few days ago with family (4 of us)

Location: Not used to surfing the malls on a daily basis but as is the case with some large ones in Singapore, you got to remember the level and the unit number and then keep looking for the signage to help guide you through to the restaurant. Once you're on Level 3 of Raffles City (there are several entrances), you'll notice some signage pointing to the restaurant.

Booking: I had made the booking prior to visiting - fairly seamless experience via Chope and had a quick look through the restaurant's online menu as well to ensure they have the varieties I'd be looking for in an Indian restaurant. Not a laundry list, but the usual culprits so I was satisfied. the place had contactless menus - scan a QR code and then look at the non-responsive website on your phone, a bit of a bummer for my ageing eyes.

Food: As I mentioned, some usual varieties as appetisers/starters - however worth mentioning that we had the Lamb Seekh kebab (LSK) and the Galaouti Kebabs (GK). While the LSK were decent, the GK's paranthas were not worth eating at all - hard and crunchu and there is no way you can eat those along with the GKs; only way was to eat them separately. Spoiled the experience of the GKs. The rest of the food - Lachcha Paranthas (for kids), Rumali rotis, Kadai Paneer and Chicken Tikka Masala were really tasty. Complementary masala papads as well. Overall, I'd say the restaurant excelled in their food quality

Ambience: Quiet place, excellent for fine dining with family or friends. Adorned with traditional decor that made the place have an Indian/Traditional/Shahi feel to it. I learnt that the live music had been taken off during the pandemic (oh well!) but quite sure that would have been a good addon.

Service quality: Funny, that with the amount of people visiting restaurants these days during the pandemic, you really need to ensure your guests are well looked after. One of the attendants got us the plates and then asked us if we had ordered a certain dish. When we said ""No"", he took back the plates and placed (without cleaning, mind you; my son had already put his hands on the plate placed in front of him) on the table next to us. COVID-19 times!!

Additionally, in a fine-dining situation, you expect the attendants to be aware of the needs of the diners. However, absolutely no one looking over. Had to raise, or politely call out a couple of times to get some attention. The only time I didn't need any attention was when the glass of water went empty - ready to pour in!

Overall - I'd say I would recommend the place for quality food and to visit during special family events/moments or official meals. We spent around ~200 SGD without alcohol, so I'd say slightly expensive to visit for your usual food cravings"
"Very good experience, great food","We had a wonderful experience right from the time of booking the table till we left the restaurant. Visited int he evening for dinner. The chat items Papadi chat and Paani puri were good. In the main course we had bread basket, Palak Paneer and Veg Jaipuri. The best part was desert with Jalebi. One plate of freshly made Jalebi was more than enough for 4 people.
The staff was friendly and the ambience was good. Due to COVID-19 the live music was not there.
Overall we liked all the dishes we had along with the cold drinks. We will visit again"
Great authentic taste,Centrally located and great Indian food. Good quantities and excellent taste. The waiters Balan and Kathy were amazing too. Will surely come again
"Appalling Leadership - unhelpful, ungracious and unacceptable.","I went for lunch with my husband who was in a wheelchair. The Manager in charge on Sun Sept 5th 2021 lunch time was extremely unsmiling and unhelpful. He did not offer help and asked me to fold the wheelchair so that he could move in and out of his station by the door. When it came to paying the bill he was ""busy attending to other bills"", ignored me and barely acknowledged payment. The food standard has dropped - the naans and rotis were soggy, and the puri was also soggy. Very disappointing. Rest assured that we will not be back until they get their act together and train their Managers to better manage the staff (who were polite and nice in contrast)"
"Delightful taste, presentation, service","Food delicious, tasty and plentiful. A bit spicy but I was okay because there was lots of rice and raita (yogurt). I liked the starters, the kebabs, the chicken curry, the bread, the rice.
The tiny gulab jamun with pistaccio nuts in the dessert was perfect.

It helps to translate the menu including the drinks menu in advance.
The Indian white wine did not impress us. However, we were given plenty of water to drink. The paper napkins were handy.
During Covid-19 restrictions the live music has been stopped.
Would I go there again. Absolutely, yes. We all would."
"Beautiful decor, peaceful ambiance and out of the world food !!!","Reminds me of taste and hospitality of India....zaika and presentation was nice. Reasonable price for a fine dining in Singapore.Thank you team, covid time is difficult but keep up the good work."
Decent food,"Great variety in menu, good service. Earlier they used to hv live Ghazal performances. Decent place for a good evening with friends and family."
Over rated 😡,"Had set lunch on a weekend with friends and it was not at all worth the money spent.not so great food,quantity wasn’t sufficient and over priced.it was an embarrassment for us since we had invited our friends."
Average food and service at Shahi Maharani,"We went to have lunch post circuit breaker and had a set Menu - the food and service was average. Raffles hotel Tiffin room service is way better and the food tasted normal nothing great.

We have had better curries and set Menu at other places. I will suggest to up the level and atleast serve the Naan hot and Roti to bread basket if you have mentioned in the menu. Disappointed at your service."
Most majestic North Indian dining,"Birthday surprise celebration very well spent here. This restaurant is befitting of royalty. I forget how rich the taste of each dish is. Spices play their roles seriously here. When they come together as a symphony, they magnify your taste buds. The quality is so good, some dishes got sent back as they miss perfection by a hairline mark. My favourite is the fish curry, it’s so rich you’re wading in deep woody flavours hoping never to get out. Tiger prawn is the biggest most succulent find you net in a Long time. The flavours coat and dust without overwhelming the juicy texture. Cottage cheese is beautifully executed. The consistency is spot on while the curry imbues flavours to its beautiful texture. All in all making it the most majestic North Indian dining experience."
Hard on the Tummy don't go by taste poor quality,"An afternoon lunch supposed to be Chat and Tandoori Buffet priced at 39SGD plus plus please watch out for the plus plus . The spread was minimal a plate of Tandoori stuff served on to the table that's all unless you ask for more you may get a little.with some hesitation . Let's come to the chats they were ok not the talk of the Town kinds . The main course was.limited to 5 dishes
The best of all is the dessert which takes all it's applause after a challenging lunch , it saves the day from worst to poor .
This is one of the oldest respected restaurant in Singapore from office parties to family lunches was one of the preffered restaurants but since 2015 to date the quality had detoriated to just worst . The pricing fits in the range of SGD 13 for the kind of quality of food even lower just for the desserts who come as a savior . For the location premium let's add another 4 SGD so not more than. SGD 17 not a single dollar more . Apart from.all this quality of food can be further tested of it's impact on ones tummy ... be prepared to repent which also leads a question on the quality of the contents
Not recommended at all from a loyal customer for over a decade ."
A quality Indian restaurant serving sensational food.,A dining experience to remember. Beautiful restaurant a little hard to find but well worth the effort. Comfortable dining with space around you. Such a comfortable place to eat. Food was well presented and so full of flavour. Good atmosphere. Highly recommended.
The food here was delicious,The food here was delicious and the portion size was good for a family booking. My favourite part was the live band who sung Hindi music and played the tabla and Vaja. Alex was our waiter and he was very good at making sure we had everything we needed and that the food was how we wanted. He also sorted a birthday ice cream surprise for my mum who was 60 and the live band sang happy birthday too.
Shahi Maharani,"I was in Singapore for a meeting and we friends wanted to have Indian dinner.
We were staying at the PAn Pacific hotel and so we chose Shahi Maharani as it was close by.
The ambiance was good, a good family dining place.
we were greeted at the entrance and escorted to a table , there was a live performance of hindi music - quite welcoming and they were taking requests from the diners.
The food was GOOD, authentic indian.
The staff were courteous."
Dinner fit for a Queen,"This restaurant is decorated to give a luxe, regal feel, as backdrop to the delicious food. Meera our waitress provided wonderful, assured service to us throughout the meal. As I prefer the beautiful flavour of Indian food rather than the bite of hot and spicy food, I really enjoyed the Prawn Korma. I will definitely return to this restaurant"
Delicious classy Indian restaurant,The decor was slightly old fashioned but classy. The mixed tandoori was a great dish. The prawn curry was delicious too. The stuffed baby brinjal with dry spices was less so. Won’t order it again. Worth a visit.
deliciously pricey,"in the interest of time we took the lunch buffet options. the selections are ok taste good, i tried the mango lassi which is too thick to my taste. with the price tag does not justify it, we can get similar delicacy elsewhere at more affordable rate."
Fantastic gluten free meal,This was by far the best meal I had in Singapore. Started with popdoms and a variety of condiments which were brought as I sat down. I then ordered the butter chicken amazing. I will definitely return on my next visit.
"Good Indian cuisine ,with live music","While on our recent Singapore trip , we decided to celebrate my Mother's Birthday by having dinner at this restaurant.

The restaurant is on Raffels shopping Mall and is done up well ,with ample sitting . There are artists who sing Gazhals and old Hindi songs ,so if you like that ,it's a great setting for celebrations.

The menu has a good enough choices . The presentation, quality and taste of the dishes ordered was good . Soup, starter and main course were all good. The live band sang Happy Birthday song to celebrate my mother's birthday & the staff got us ice cream. They also took a family photo and instantly took a print and pasted on a card and presented to us, which was great.

Overall we had a good time at this restaurant . I would recommend it."
Hidden Gem,"The ambiance is excellent. Vegetarians will do well here, great choice and excellent food and quality. The service is brilliant. The evening ghazal singer do a great job and also sang a coupe of favourites for my wife."
Dinner at Shahi Maharani,"Went for a family dinner to Shahi Maharani.
Great choice ! Great food ! Great ambience ! Great service too !
They had 3 musicians singing through out. ( one tabla player, one male singer and one female singer )
They were singing ghazals.
The best part was that we could ask them to sing any ghazal and they would do so.
It wasn't too crowded considering it was a working day but get yourself a reservation on any other day.
Good seating area, prompt service and polite service as well.
For vegetarians, please dont worry. They make amazing indian veg food.
It is a bit expensive but it's worth it .
PS: Special thanks to ""Meera"" who attended us well. Thank you !"
"Good food, Great ambience","Perfect place to go for fine dining. They have a live music set up where they play old melodies of 80s and 90s.
Perfect place to go for birthday celebration. Choir group plays the birthday song when requested and they also print a instant photo with a message.
Food is good too. They serve authentic north Indian food. Bit higher on prices but the portion is good. One curry is enough for 2 people. They also have a bar counter. They also serve complimentary papad.
They take reservations and it is always recommended to take one for this place. Service is little slow. Ambience is great."
Nice ambience,"I was there for a team lunch in April 2019, and we have enjoyed ourselves having the nice food and service."
A world of culinary excellence,This is an outstanding restaurant. Great food; great service! Fantastic atmosphere. This is a must visit restaurant in Singapore!
Great food. Great experience,"Visited this restaurant with family for dinner.

Super food, good crowd, great ambience and service, good selection of liquor and wines. The staff was happy to tweak spice levels.

A large variety of veg dishes also available

A Must visit for those who are in Singapore and like Indian food."
Smelly restaurant.,"I could not get past the suffocating stale oil smell throughout the restaurant. No, I am not mistaking aroma of Indian spices. My shirt smelled like a garbage can the rest of the evening.

The biriyani was decent. The rumali roti was not thin and could taste uncooked dough. The prawns were delicious. But at $40 for 5, I would have expected sizable tiger prawns.

$15 for a 12oz/300ml kingfisher beer.
The live music was loud and horrible. You could not hear people at your table. At about $100/person, this by far is the worst restaurant I have ever been to."
Always Fantastic!,"This is our regular Indian restaurant when we visit Singapore. We've never been disappointed with anything we've ordered.

I've recommended it to so many people to eat here and they have always enjoyed their experience and food.

It's traditional Indian cuisine and if you like spice and heat, you'll love this!"
Dinner,Service is good but food was not that fantastic. Had the sizzling kebab platter. Did not feel very good about the mutton. The briyani was not bad. Pricing doesn’t seem to justify the overall quality and taste of food.
Overrated,"The Shahi Maharani website points out that many local VIPs visited the place, suggesting that you might miss a culinary treat if you didn't go there. What we encountered was an interior that had already seen its best days, the lighting was dim and an unpleasant odor was spreading through the place. The staff was very welcoming, friendly and helpful. The side dish we had ordered was not available and our second priority never landed on our table but on our bill. When we complained, this item was cancelled. But only after the waitress had reassured herself in the kitchen that the dish had not been served. Not exactly an elegant way to fix one's own mistakes. Not to mention mistrusting the guests in such an obvious way. The main courses were fine, nothing more, because the gravy of the classic curry dishes had little character, i.e. they tasted like any combination of spices. The portions were generous, but this had the drawback that the dishes became cold over time. In many of the good Indian restaurants at least the main courses are kept warm on the table. The Papadams with cumin seeds were also mediocre because they were baked in the oven and partly burnt at the edges instead of fried in hot oil. However, the freshly made pickles served to the Papadams were delicious. To sum it up: We had already eaten better Indian food. For example at the big buffet in the Colony of the Ritz Carlton. There was an Indian corner, just excellent! Check it out."
Authentic Indian food,Enjoyed the well spreadout Lunch Buffet. All the dishes very well prepared. Ambience and service very good. Overall a good expereince. Would visit again on my next visit to Singapore.
Good and reliable lunch buffets,"Good quality, authentic Indian food. They have a 1 for 1 buffet deal at 56++ for 2 people on weekdays. Good value for what they offer. Lovely decor and service too. Nothing much to fault really."
Great Food,"We decided to come to a restaurant for a change while we in Singapore and definitely weren't disappointed by the food - although the prices were rather steep!

The service was friendly and efficient and they brought some pappadums whilst we waited.

The portions were a good size and everything we ordered was delicious! The dhal maharani was the best I've tasted - would come back for that even if everything else had been bad!!!"
Great place to visit but expensive,"Went in December with all my family 10 people, easy to find in a shopping Mall, very good and attentive service in fact the attendants takin. Orders helped us order the right portions. Excellent Indian chaat and all the food. Really authentic, live Indian music. Tick in all boxes and highly recommended. Only glitch it was too expensive, dinner for 10 cost us around 600 SGP dollars, which I found on the higher side comparing to some similar upmarket restaurants. Hence 4 star. 2nd negative was they ran out of Mint when we ordered one more set of virgin mojitos.."
Superb Food,"We visited this place in 2008 and now after 10 years as we remember the tasty and hot food. Courteous staff & i recalled an old staff (lady) who only gained weight. We ordered Palak Paneer, Chicken Tikka & Chicken Malai Boti along with Nan and it was just amazing !!!"
"Good service, great food","One of the best North Indian food I have had in a while. Had a few dishes. Naan, chaat, chicken tandoori, butter chicken, palak paneer. Service was good. Food is pricey."
Great Restaurant in the Raffles City Shopping Center,I enjoyed a wonderful lunch with my colleagues from the region and we all enjoyed immensely. Wonderful atmosphere in which to chat and the food was great.
Good food great ambience excellent service,I highly recommend this place if you want authentic Indian while in Singapore. They also sometimes have a live band playing Indian music that really sets the mood.
A good restaurant for North Indian Food,"Located centrally, opposite to Carlton Hotel at the Raffles City Mall, Shahi Maharani serves mouthwatering Smaosas and truly North Indian dishes. They have a good variety of dishes and the lunch buffet is awesome.

The staff are very courteous and I would like to specially mention about Sanjeev who takes personal care of guests and is a great person for wonderful conversations."
Big group dinner,"This Indian restaurant has nice location inside the swisshotel-fairmont complex. Everything should have been great here, but unfortunately not. Noisy place, food as an average, too much a tourist trap. You got what you asked, but not more."
Great food & service,"Been here several times and it's one of the best upscale Indian restaurants we've been to in Singapore. Almost every dish we tried is good. Also child/baby friendly, and have live music at dinner!"

Excellent Service,A recommended restaurant for family and friends. The food were amazing. We went there for Sunday Brunch. The Starter comes in sizzler plate that kept our food hot. We felt like more options for vegetarian food than non-vegetarian since we love vegetarian food more we really enjoyed the brunch. There were live Chaat Counter where Chef is making Chaat according to our preference .Thanks for the excellent service. Keep Going!
Good food,Quiet good food with nice service Live ghazals were good. Black dal and chole were good. Roomali roti was good
Nice place,"Went for lunch with colleagues.

It was a nice buffet. Definitely worth a visit if you're missing Indian food.

The salads were different and nice, curd was disappointing, pakodas were reheated, not fresh. Fish, mutton, chicken, dal, chicken tikka, rotis all were very nice.

Lotus stem koftas were nice and soft. Gravy could've been better"
the dal makhani,"i loved it, for all the right reasons i found this close to the place i was staying at, convenient - serving size 3 people"
Wonderful Experience👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼,Wonderful experience.. excellent performances by the musicians and Singers. Really enjoyed every performance by them. Made the dining experience great👍🏼👌🏼
"Dinner after a long time, not impressed","We went to Shahi Maharani after a long time with family ( although I went with office colleagues a few months ago).
The restaurant was full as usual but we are not impressed with the food quality and quantity.
The papadam served after sitting was mostly burnt. The onion salad and mint chatney was terrible. A high end restaurant serving chopped onion?
The starters were pretty good, but too much cream and cheese. These taste very good but not really authentic North Indian food. Fusion is always good, so I am not commenting on that but tandoor item with too much cheese was a bit odd.
The main dishes are okay, nothing special. With a primium price, the meat and veg quantities should have been slightly more. Taste wise the dishes we took does not evoke any special wow.
Our main complain is for naan and rumali roti. Those were well below par.

Also for a restaurant that received Michelin star a while ago, the presentation was pretty bad.

The Singers were terrible and spoiled the dinner environment. Earlier we used to go to this restaurant to enjoy the songs.

The only good thing we noticed was the service, that was very good."
One word... Exceptional,Service was great. The food was not only rich with cream but also rich flavor. I recommend this for small groups as well as large. And I recommend this for people who like fancy restaurants.
"Overpriced, mediocre food","We went to celebrate a birthday & were totally disappointed. Food was average - oily, relying on heavy handed use of spices than quality of meats & totally overpriced.
The kulfi was a joke. A few tiny pieces for $14. And that too only 2 options out of multiple on menu were available.
Service was acceptable.
There were a group of small kids running around screaming & shouting. And it continued throughout our dinner. Worst part of the evening was the live music, which was a terrible parody of some lovely original songs - off key & shrill. I would seriously suggest that they stick to music CDs.
We won't be returning."
Good,"It was very good ,, Excellent food test and good staff service.. location inside the raffles city mall on the 3 floor"
Satisfying Indian food fix,"Had the weekend chaat buffet and it was worth every penny.
There was a good spread of chicken and mutton curry, palaak paneer, vegetable curry, lentil curry and desserts. The chaats were really yummy as well with the spicy and tangy sauce mixed with the mint and yoghurt sauce.not to forget the platter of tandoori chicken which was included with the buffet. Naan was perfect, warm and moist... yummy"
Ed's Review,"I was treated with interest and concern over my orders, the sufficiency and quality of the food and my overall happiness with the restaurant. Very impressive."
Craving for curries and naans always satisfied,"Our favourite North Indian restaurant. And we each have our own cravings. For the three of us, it's usually butter chicken and lamb chops, with the third dish either a prawn or fish. A combination of garlic, butter and plain naans accompany these main courses. Mango lassi is nice or a ice cold beer to wash down those curries. Service quality is good and good recommendations if you are uncertain of any dishes. Enjoy."
Excellent,"The food we had was one of the best we have had in Singapore.
One of the seniors, Vijay, really went the extra mile when he realised it was my partner's birthday. He volunteered to bring in a small ice-cream with candle, made the Live musicians sing her the birthday greeting, and even printed a polaroid with cover without any charges. He made our day. A very pleasant experience with Shahi Maharani."
Vegetarian Food was really good,"traditional south indian style decor , not only indians also lot of foreigers were also enjoying the food"
Excellent restaurant,I had been to this place along with my office colleagues. Very good service and food quality was dam good.multiple options for veg and non veg foods.overall this restaurant is very good for food but bit expensive otherwise all is well.
Terrible Attitude,"The manager needs to get off his high horse and take a lesson on customer service. Pre-ordered a meal with them a day in advance via deliveroo, received a confirmation from them saying order has been accepted. Subsequently, he calls to ask if the order is for noon or midnight? how can deliveroo accept an order outside of a restaurant's operating time? I asked him does he not understand the concept of a 'preorder' and then he had the cheek to say stuff like noone orders a day in advance, unlike you. Seriously?? he does not know what a preorder is? instead of bothering your customer, and talking down to them, he should first check the platform his restaurant is operating from. No food is worth the terrible customer service."
The food was excellent,"I enjoyed both the food, service and live music. When we arrived we didn't have a reservation but was seated quickly. The ambience was lovely. There was live music. I really enjoyed that fun detail. The food was great. We ordered the fish curry, lamb curry and the shrimp. The food came quickly and tasted great. Definitely would come back here again."
Disapponting,"Have been dining at this restaurant every time in Singapore over the last 10years always excellent .. but tonight the white wine served was not cold, had to send back dhal was very runny and lamb tough. Sad to see the decline in quality"
"Great food, good ambience","Went for a dinner with family. Food was great, authentic North Indian - true to its name.

Ambience was nice as well - quite a rustic palatial look.

Staff was very courteous and service was prompt as well.

Maybe slightly pricier than other options - but the food quality makes it worth shelling a few extra dollars."
Excellent North Indian restaurant,"A wide range of north Indian food on the menu. Almost everything we tried was very good. Not the cheapest restaurant though. The only issue we had (every time we visited) was the annoyingly loud cultural music band. It's a restaurant, not a concert so people go there to socialize, talk, meet, etc. I hope the management would consider this."
Excellent North Indian food,Food here is excellent quality. The curries are very well prepared and delicious. The breads are piping hot fresh from the tandoor. As close you can get to eating in India.
"Excellent Indian food, enormous portions and outstanding service","Three of us visited this restaurant in the Raffles City Mall on the 3rd floor. It wasn’t easy to find as it didn’t appear in the food court information list, I had to search for it by name at the Mall information display.
The food was outstanding (I have had plenty of Indian food in many countries to compare it to) really good, we had a mixed starter with tandoori chicken and prawns and onion bhaji. Both dishes were enormous we had planned to share 2 starters between 3 but we couldn’t manage it all.
I ordered butter chicken and a paneer side dish, the rice for 1 was a huge bowl and we hardly touched it as the main course curry’s were so generous. My main was just delicious and the side dish was the same size as the main dish and it was the best Indian cheese I have ever had.Sadly we couldn’t finish the meal and had to leave it. We all felt that we could have shared dishes and ordered less and still had plenty!
We had great service and very pleasant surroundings. We did notice a number of the other diners were Indian which is always a good sign if you enjoy good Indian food. The menu was extensive with a great choice of authentic curry, rice and breads.
This was a more expensive meal but it was very good quality and well worth it !
We all thoroughly enjoyed it."
Excellent North Indian Restaurant,"Happened to read review in local newspaper. Had never heard about it. Decided to try it. It was a surprise - finding a good North Indian restaurant. Food was very nicely flavored. Service was excellent. Waiters were very friendly and polite. Considering it was Singapore, not very cheap though portion size were good. Like other restaurants in Singapore, keep away from alcohol and you can cut down your bill by 30 to 35%.

Advisable to book if one does want to wait. We didn’t book and were told to wait 45 minutes. Fortunately, this came down to 15 minutes as somebody had booked for a large group and some of them did not turn up.

They do a buffet lunch time and a special one on Sundays. Will give it a try"
High end Indian cuisine!,"Tried the butter chicken, vindaloo and vegetarian dishes, prices are high, portions are generous for sharing, taste is good. The naan breads were disappointing, very dry and only slightly warm. Service was prompt on the day of visit. Expectations was obviously high, wish it could have been better."
Food is very bad,"Very dissapointed with lunch buffet we had. Super average food, no taste and buffet spread is also not diverse"
Excellent,"Having just checked into the Fairmont after arriving from Sydney we were hungry. Went looking for Chinese we found ourselves in the North Indian!!
What a find. We’re vegetarians and there was more than enough to satisfy us. Helpful staff made sure we didn’t order to much and we left feeling very satisfied.
Relatively expensive but worth it."
Business Lunch,"What do you need for a business lunch? Fast courteous service, no loud music and quality food ..this place has all three and is my go to place when my lunch group wants to try Indian. The buffet starts at 12 sharp and my practice is to be at the door by 11.55am. With some guests picking buffet and some ala carte it is all chop chop and we are always out of there before 1.45pm....having enjoyed appetizers, mains, desserts and chai. Curiously the tandoori chicken ala carte tastes better than the buffett...hmmmm....go figure ; )). In case you do not know their little secret on the ""finisher"" allow me to share. At the payment counter there is a silver spice box filled with cardamoms,sugared fennel seeds and an assortment of mouth fresheners called ""suparis"". They do not go all out to show you this....but do ask for it at the end of the meal. After a delicious lunch this may be the antidote to inevitable and unwanted sleepiness after a meal. Supari box...then back to office;))."
Tasty Food,If you are Indian then this is the must restaurant to go for food. Food is Perfect in taste and good in value for money. Restaurant is not so expensive
Excellent service and great food!,"I had a splendid time at Shahi Maharani. In my context I feel that this place is lush and posh.
I had Chicken Makhanwala, Palak Paneer
and Bengali Fish Curry with my Garlic and Butter naan.
They are flavorful and delicious. I would prolly order 1 gravy dish in future. I had so much gravy that added complexity to the naan. LOL!

As I was sitting at my table, I noticed a lot of hot plate being served out. And I was intrigued by the smell and flavour that I had to just ask the service crew what it was. Tandoori Paneer, the crew explained to me it's cottage cheese and peppers laced with a creamy marinade.

The service was excellent n warming."
Mediocre Taste below expectations,"We experienced dinner two nights ago. The service was good from the staff but the food quality did not match our expectations.
The taste of the food was very average and nothing to warrant a repeat visit. Singapore does have a big selection fortunately of better taste restaurants."
Always Good,Very well established and reputable North Indian Cuisine restaurant conveniently located in the heart of the city. Is a favorite for many years and the standard of the food is always good. Usual chicken tikka butter chicken prawn byrani never fails.
Disappointed,"We used to live in Singapore in 2006 and this used to be one of our favorite places. After that whenever we come to Singapore - we make sure to visit the restaurant. Had a terrible experience today. Went there at 8:00pm for dinner, being new year’s eve they had a buffet menu. They had a early bird promotion of SGD 60 per person if you had food between 6:30-8:30. When we went there they said we can’t offer you early bird price anymore, we can offer you the table at normal price. We said that’s fine then Binay said I don’t have a table and the restaurant was half empty which was quiet strange.... we will neither visit this place in the future nor recommend it anymore."
"Good food, ambience. A bit pricey","The food and ambience was very good. I especially liked the live Indian music. Service was attentive and accurate.

The restaurant was a bit pricy. With wine the bill came to $500 for 6 pax.

Worth a try but you won’t risk getting fat on the prices."
Excellent food!,To start with.. I’m not really a fan of eating Indian food overseas specially because they can never get it right.. but this place got it bang on! Excellent food.. pick out anything from the buffet and you’ll be a happy customer.. highly recommend!
Good ambience,"We were at this place for dinner. Good ambience but a bit slow service. Could see lot foreigners who were interested in Indian food and that is a good thing. They had quite a good variety of food on the menu and tasted well too just that it did not suit me for whatever reason and ended up with stomach issues the next day. So due to personal experience I will not be visiting again, to the rest good luck"
Good option for Indian food lovers,Shahi Maharani as indicated is a North Indian cuisine restaurant! Good food with a great ambience! Truly a royal experience! And you have to pay for it! Service is good! Food taste is also good! Nice option for groups and big families!
Casual Dinner,"Wide variety of Indian food options to choose for. We were looking for quality veg dinner and found this place to be perfect. Ambiance is decent, service is on time, food was really well prepared. Vegetable sizzler we ordered tasted amazing!"
Authentic Indian Food with Superb Ambience and Great service,"We have visited Shahi Maharani, multiple times. Very few Restaurants in Singapore have a good combination of authentic Indian Taste, Great Ambience and amazing service. Worth mention..Sanjay and Vinay...Great attitude and customer focus is sincerely appreciated.Must visit for every Indian.location is ++"
Very good,"Very nice food , my favorite was butter chicken and my daughter enjoyed Pani puri . Overall good experience , definitely recommend to go."
Great Indian food,"Really enjoyed the food here. Came here based on a friend recommendation and did not disappoint! Food was excellent. Only thing is the staff kept on interrupting our conversations, slightly annoying"
Good choice,"Our first day at Singapore and we decided to have dinner in this restaurant as we were staying in Swissotel. Good choice by us, food was good so were the staff and their hospitality. lot of variety available. Unfortunately the food didn't suit me so was skeptical to make a visit again, though my other 2 friends enjoyed it. You get papdams as complimentary. We tried the papdi chaat, dahi bhalla, chole , roti & mixed veggie. Kudos to the team. Keep up the good work!"
Very good food,"Butter chicken and tikka masala were both very tasty. You can see through a window, how the chef prepares the dishes. Everything freshly prepared. The pricing is high - but reasonable. The quality of the food and service was outstanding."
The best at a price if you can afford!,"For someone who can afford the best price this is the place not to be missed. Took my family and brother's family on a special occasion, every single member of the 8 member gang enjoyed from 3 years to 48 years range. Taste is awesome, quality is the best. At least once you should visit though the bill will make a hole in your wallet but for the food they provide its expected you can't complain!"
Great north Indian food,This restaurant in Raffles city Mall offers great north Indian food.The ambience is good and the service is also good.The prices are steep but it is worth .If you want good north Indian food while in Singapore this is the right place to go to.
Good,"This restaurant is in raffles city shopping centre.
Indian food fine dining kind of arrangement . Expensive I would say for the food and for the ambiance.
They do have 1 for 1 buffet on weekdays but you can also order ala carte.
Service is good , food taste good too.
But there are better Indian restaurants in Singapore if you are looking for much tastier Indian food."
"Indian Food - head to Shahi Maharni.. Great Ambiance, live music and amazing food","Shahi Maharani has a great ambiance, and offer buffet and ala carte options. Amazing indian food in Singapore, along with Chat options, and soulful live music during weekends / PHs.
Please make an advnace booking, as this is in great demand due to its central location. for us choices were limited due to Jain food, but had some amazing options and great taste. Staff is very friendly!"
Great Indian Restaurant with Veg / Non Veg Options,"My Indian brought me to this place, and I have brought my families here many times.

There are many options for vegetarian. We love the black dhal, cottage cheese in spinach, the mashed eggplants and the breads. We also love the thin bread, Roomali Roti.

However, the serving size is smaller than other Indian restaurants, and prices are higher as well."
Delightful Musical Dinner Date,"It was a girls' night out. My three friends and I met at the restaurant for dinner as I was craving a good curry. The restaurant did not disappoint. We were seated near the stage where the musicians would be playing. Thankfully, they were coming on at 9pm so we were able to finish dinner before enjoying authentic Indian music complete with vocals and instrumentation.

The portions were just right for four women; with leftovers to be brought home. We ordered an appetizer that was recommended by the waiter, and had one order each of Tandoori Chicken, Palak Paneer (spinach cottage cheese), Aloo Gobi (spiced potatoes and cauliflower), Beef Rogan Josh (beef in masala spices), Saffron Rice and Naan roti (bread baked in a tandoori oven). We also ordered Raita (onions, cucumber in yoghurt).

The food arrived within 10 minutes of our order and it was a feast for the eyes and palate. Compared to South Indian curries, this North Indian dinner was less spicy but flavourful nonetheless. For the uninitiated into Indian cuisine, this would have been a good place to start.

We fought to foot the bill as each of us wanted to give the others a treat, amusing the waiter in the process. We were so stuffed from dinner that we skipped dessert. Kulfi (Indian Ice cream) would have been my choice.

Since it was a Sunday evening, the restaurant was not packed. Otherwise, a reservation is required on Saturdays."
Lunch,"My favourite cuisine is Northern Indian ! I would say the lunch special was worth every cent , arrived at 12 noon, my friend and I enjoyed eating from 12 till 2.30 .
The cost was such a surprise when we went to pay $50 all you can eat , 2 people eat for one price , we enjoyed a cold beer $14. The service charge and GST was included , total of bill
$91.80 , will definitely be coming back Thankyou, oh I forgot to mention the food it was of very high quality the produce and flavour was beautiful"
Outstanding Food,"Its an excellent restaurant and provide nice buffet. They had 1 to 1 offer and had sumptuous lunch.
1. Food: justDelicious. Buffet is one the best. A lot for varieties.
2. Service: Excellent.
3 Ambience: Good. They do have live music at times.
4. Price: $50++ for couple on weekdays."
Buffet Lunch,"Ambiance was good. Service is good. About the Buffet; Starters were great, Chat counter is awesome, Mains are average, not much choice for vegetarians and Desert is also average except for Gulab Jamuns which were mouth watering."
Expensive,"I think they have lost their exclusivity in serving authentic taste, food was average, but expensive Located in Raffles City mall."
Very good North Indian Restaurant in Singapore,"Hi,
We recently visited this restaurant along with our project team, management team and vendor.
We have been served with some delicious mouth watering starters and Indian food both vegetarian and non-vegetarian.
They have 63 $ fixed buffet menu per person which comes with starters, main course and deserts. Although quantity is high taste is very good.
The only concern is very high price but it is compensated by ambiance and service.
Hope that helps.

Regards
Ajay"
"Delicious food in lovely, if a bit bright, surroundings","Good choice of food. This was our first taste of North Indian cuisine. We chose a prawn curry with coconut and a chicken curry. One serving of rice was sufficient for both of us. We both thoroughly enjoyed the curries even though neither could finish as the portion was very generous. The staff were helpful and friendly and the live music a bonus. Very haunting singing. As with the whole of Singapore, remember your final bill will include tax and service charge."
