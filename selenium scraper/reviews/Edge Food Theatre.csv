"2023 CNY Dinner Buffet @Edge (Pan Pacific, Singapore)","This is arguably one of the most glorious food spread across the variety of food offer from the various kitchens, featuring seafood on Ice, Japanese delights, mezze salad, cold cut platter, mains (poultry and seafood), local cuisines (heritage) delight. The Chinese New Year theme desserts were delightful to the eye and delectably delicious to the palate.

Adventurous food lovers with a deep, wide, ferocious appetite should come to the dinner buffet (the weekend edition)!

Thank you Steven (and Kerwin) for your hospitality. We enjoyed our dinner and our visitor from Taiwan was deeply impressed with the food galore and quality of service."
Delicious food,Family dinner Service crew Venga was very helpful and friendly Most important food is delicious. Will back again for dinning.
Good buffet lunch,"First visit, some of the prawns were pretty fresh.
The pan seared seabass fillet was above average.
The pork and beef not so okay, a bit tough.
The snow crab, tuna and salmon sashimi were just okay.
The nyonya laksa, turkey and pizza were good.

Friendly and helpful service from Mr Kenneth and Miss Crystal. After discount paid SGD70, really worth it, sometimes a 3-course set lunch also about this price but can only fill up half of my tummy."
Excellent Seafood Buffet,"This seafood buffet is located at the 5 star Pan Pacific Hotel.

It was one of several buffets that were recommended to me.

There were so many food stations with a great supply of various fresh seafood. Other stations include Japanese, Chinese, Pizza, Indian, Singapoean favourites including satay and the famous chili crab, desert bar and more.

Its certainly one of the best buffets I have visited for some time.

As a GHA Member I received a 25% discount off my bill :)"
Poor,Poor service Food lacklustre Lobster very cheap and tasteless Peking duck cheap and plastic Sushi was of poor qualitNot impressed
Amazing staff and wide selections of food,I would like to shout out to Shawn the staff who has served us quietly. He is super helpful and very attentive. My friend and I also enjoyed the food tonight. Well done the crew. Thank you üòä
Probably the best champagne brunch with the largest range of cuisines in Singapore,"Amazing range of cuisines from Italian station to Indian one to duck and laksa one, cheese and cold meats, desserts and chilli crab, roasts and pizza, you name it they have it.

Truly extensive range of foods that will keep you full and entertained!

Combine this with free flowing Tattinger chanpagne and you'll have a wonderful brucch in a very relaxed environment.

Highly recommended."
"Some great some not so, large selection","Bottomless champagne buffet, was expensive but they were very generous with the Tattinger champagne. Some of the food was great, the seafood bar being most popular. Dessert was a bit of a bit and miss though the laksa and roasted chicken was delicious. Probably wouldn‚Äôt do bottomless again as for an extra SGD90 per person it was expensive !"
Seafood not fresh,Seafood like the prawns and salmon sashimi lacks freshness. Staff are very attentive to needs but struggle with conversational English.
Excellent service by Matthew,Very attentive and polite service by Matthew. My family is very happy with the food and environment. Food quality was good. Would come again!
Food not worth the price.,"I went to the buffet to celebrate my anniversary, chillies crab is not fresh, lobster is over cook ,Indian cuisine is too salty,total unstatified with the food ,but happy that staff is attentive."
First Epic buffet after Covid!,"It was a great experience! Had a birthday celebration for our son‚Äôs birthday. Staff was wonderful & highly attentive despite full house. Table was cleared swiftly. Waiting staff included a fair Indian guy & Indian lady who was working hard to serve drinks & clearing table dutifully. They were enthusiastic with taking photos for families. What a lovely experience! Kudos also to Aidil, the cashier at the reception who was so polite & customer-centric!! He showed us to our table, first person we met at the Edge & last person to say goodbye to us. Remembered my name through my credit card! No one has done that before, was impressed :) apart from this, food was great & every station was manned by happy staff! Laksa station was manned by a nice old uncle who cautioned me of the spice level of the Laksa. Many tables were celebrating Father‚Äôs Day or birthday. It was a lovely experience & this is what dining out means to us..something that we truly missed during the pandemic. Keep up the 5-star experience!!!"
Epic champagne brunch and wonderful service,"Love to come to the Edge and enjoy a wonderful champagne brunch with epic service from Joyce who is ever smiling and Aaron, both pf whome ensured that our glasses were topped up!

Always brilliant to come to The Edge at the Pan Pac and enjoy their wonderful brunch with long time executive chef Michele Greggio who along with his fantastic team always look after my guests and me.

This is really the USP of The Edge with all kinds of cultures and foods which you could pick and choose and have made for you. It really gives them, ahem, an edge....

Recommended!"
Compliment for staff at Edge,I would like to compliment Ms. Cheong Beng hwee and the staff at the restaurant. She has served us well with her attentiveness to our needs. Appreciate it. Thank you. From 2 satisfied customers.
Disappointing,"We paid $900 plus for 9 adults and one kid to celebrate my dad‚Äôs birthday. Overall, We feel the service and quality of food has dropped tremendously.
The spread of cooked food and desert have reduced.
The guy manning the laksa stall is still very friendly and attentive.
The server for our table was very quick to clear our table each time we finished our food. Very hardworking staff.
The oyster counter staff are very hardworking. The fresh sushi counter server deserves to be sacked. He was very condescending to the customers and has the poorest service attitude. Looks like an angry and unhappy chap at work. My bro in law went to place his order for more salmon and he slapped only three pieces on his plate angrily. We complained to the manager on duty and he quarreled with his manager. Definitely has authority issues. When I was ordering mine, I asked for an assorted of tuna, salmon and squid and he exclaimed, ‚Äúwhat assorted?!‚Äù He really spoils the day.
I guessed we complained and later another server came to attend to us and he is very attentive and served my dad the cake we brought promptly."
Best service from crew!,Had a great business lunch. Seafood were fresh! The spread was alit more than in 2021. We were served well by staff IVY TAN. Will come back again! Thank you!
Good Champange Breakfast for GHA Club members,"Good Champagne Breakfast for GHA Club members, private dining area for Club members, personalise services."
Great experience from the staff,"I'd like to commend on one of their wait staff namely Asha who served my mum and I ( we were sitting at table 33) during our recent buffet lunch at Edge on 13 April 2022. She showed extreme attention to details to our drinks and ensure our coffee and tea were replenished timely.
Our cutleries were also changed during different courses for the entire meal.
Even though the restaurants were swarmed with a lot of patrons, she still carries herself professionally and I felt her sincerity throughout the entire lunch.
Seafood were fresh and the varieties are sufficient for lunch.
Would definitely recommend and return for future visits"
Best Sunday brunch and best staff,"Always love coming back to the Edge for Sunday brunch . They have the most extensive spread, longest brunch period, and most friendly and helpful staff, especially Janice, who has an infectious happy vibe."
Lunch,Great ambience. Was having lunch with friends. Good buffet spread and the restaurant is spacious. Would like to compliment server Ms Aishah and the manager Crystal for their excellent service.
Lunch gathering,"Friendly staff , Crystal and Aishah , food very nice , variety ok , ~~~~~ environment very chill‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..(^_^)v^_^^‚ÄÜ_‚ÄÜ^(o^^o)(^‚óã^):-D(*^_^*)"
Great Service & delicious food,Good ambience and the staff Kenneth was very friendly and helpful. The seafood was so fresh and elevated the entire buffet experience. Will definitely came back again.
Edge dinner,"Great dining experience at the edge!! Wide buffet spread. Atmosphere is great, very spacial environment. Special thanks to Sonia for clearing our table fast and the entire restaurant team! Highly recommended"
Stay and feast,"My gf and I had dinner at Edge and we were attended by Sonia. Her service was extremely good and proactive with changing of plates and refilling of hot tea. She even noticed that we were having extra sashimi and quickly added extra soy sauce for us.

This is by far the best service I had for buffet in Singapore. Usually I would need to prompt the service crew to clear the plates etc. But with Sonia, we never needed to!

Extremely impressed with the service. Food were good as well except that certain items as stated on the menu online were not available such as the seafood chowder soup"
Amazing service & spread at Pan Pac Edge (sat lunch),"The service by Sonia was exceptional! We throughly enjoyed the spread at Pan Pacific Edge (Saturday brunch). the durian dessert, chilli crab mantou, cream pasta, char siew and seafood were great :-) The ambience was great too"
Mom birthday dinner at EDGE PAN PACIFIC SINGAPORE,"Many varieties of food, from japanese to chinese to western to local food. Very nice ambience. We are being served by Sonia. She is very good, attentive and help us to clear our table on point and refill our water promptly.,It's my mom bday and she wishes her happy birthday too. My mom likes her. Find her friendly too. Overall it's a good experience dining here. Good job Sonia :)"
Birthday Dinner @ Edge,"Relatively good variety of food selection. Food is good, area is clean and the service level this round was much better than my visit last year! Thank you very much to Sonia for such wonder service! It was a great dinner experience."
Best service @Edge,We had a great dinner for my little girl‚Äôs birthday. It was so greatful due to the best service and foods. Especially we got very kind service by Sonia! She was so kind and good. Very impressive! Thank you!
Bad service from staff,"Had a breakfast and I waited at the counter to be served for over 5 minutes which was fine as they might have been busy. When the staff came back, he didn‚Äôt say a single word and just stared at me and flicked his head up indicating what I wanted. Not a single word uttered and totally unapologetic about not being at his station. Staff name is Wen Long"
Well done Sonia,"Very enjoyable dinner for my family made possible by a very warm and very attentive Sonia, who ensured my family‚Äôs needs were attended to at all time. Well done Sonia!"
One of the best buffet in town!,"Celebrated my husband‚Äôs birthday at Edge. The spread of food was wide and seafood was fresh. Ivy Tan who attended to our table was nice and friendly, she made the birthday celebration memorable. Thank you."
Fantastic as always at The Edge,"Love staying and dining at Pan Pacific. Was good before Covid and am glad it still is!

Thank you Janice and Jeremy for taking care of us at Table 91! All staff including the chefs were warm and hospitable. Janice, especially, would always stop by for a friendly chat.

Keep it up, Pan Pac! Hope to stay at Pan Pacific Singapore again soon."
Would come back for another,"booked a last minute lunch over at the edge, and was more than impressed by the service of the staff, the food as well. we were greeted at the entrance by Crystal, and she showed us to our table and was extremely helpful. she showed us the various kinds of cuisines and offered her recommendations. also, Lisa assisted us with regards to anything we needed at our table. Both their service exceeded our expectations and were always efficient in any requests we had. Food was fresh and packed with flavours ‚Äî you would go back for multiple rounds. I would definitely return again, not only for the widespread variety of food, but also for the outstanding service provided!!!!!!!"
Awesome buffet spread with great customer service,Visited Edge with my family together with a toodler. Crystal and her team are very attentive and proactive. Thank you for the awesome service provided. Hope to visit soon!
Buffet dinner @Edge,Outstanding hospitality by the restaurant staffs especially Venga who went an extra mile focussing on the guests comfort and expectations. Hats off to him and five stars . The pan pacific has never failed to perform more than expectations‚Ä¶ always glowing .
Worse 2nd return visit.,"my booking was at 6.30pm today with my relative. We decided to come back for our 2nd time dining and have our pre-CNY dinner at the Edge restaurant since we thought our first experience has given us a good impression of the place and we were fine with the price stated when i made the reservation via phone. when we went to the restaurant we were seated at a table just for 2 and no good view in sight. we went to take our food and ate them. found that some of the food spread were cold, some were dry, hard and some were just ok. they even told us that it was supposed to be a chinese new year menu and we didn't see anything special at all.

the fruits felt not fresh at all even down to the deserts. we felt very disappointed in Edge given all it's good reviews and were shocked. it was to us not an enjoyable experience at all

we ended up having diarrhea and my relative had very bad one."
Food was superb!,"We went there for our company Christmas lunch (buffet), the place is nice. Food selections are nice and well prepared. Staff are polite and accommodating. I love the pork sectionüòÅ...and the durian dessert was so delicious!"
The Edge..My Favourite Restaurant!!‚ô•Ô∏è,"Repeat visits to The Edge restaurant at Pan Pacific Singapore..
Not a complain about the taste n the freshness of the spreads, especially when being served by smiling n happy staffs..
Seafood hot n cold dishes n their Japanese selections were my go to...n many more choices.
Love the selections of desserts especially the 'durian in a cup',just like eating the real fruit, the best I've had so far...
Kudos to restaurant manager Mr Suresh n the 2 friendly staffs, Rose n Janice who attended our table, for fast services n very attentive to our requests..
Beautiful atmosphere n very clean restaurant..
Can't wait to make my next reservation at my favourite restaurant, The Edge...."
Beware: Not all items on the menu are available,"Had Sunday brunch at the Edge on 19 December 2021. Was very surprised that not all items on the menu are available. Examples would be the duck rillette, xiao long pau etc. The reason given by the chef was the lack of stock. This was my first time coming across this situation as i would think that all the food in the menu should be made available as per advertised.

Service experience was a mixed bag too, definitely below that of the other Pan Pacific restaurants; Keyaki and Hai Tien Lo. There was no recognition of elite status as well."
good experience,"food was exquisite üëåüèª , seats and queues were safely distanced, extremely fast table service also."
Festive Lunch,"The food was good, lots of choices. Ambiance is also nice. The crew were very attentive and friendly specially Janice. We‚Äôll definitely go back! üëçüèª‚≠êÔ∏èüëçüèª‚≠êÔ∏èüëçüèª‚≠êÔ∏èüëçüèª‚≠êÔ∏èüëçüèª‚≠êÔ∏è"
Perfect dining experience!,Food variety and quality is awesome! Love the ambiance and the excellent service by Ivy completes the whole dining experience! 5 star experience!
"Celebrated 50th Birthday at the Edge, Pan Pacific","Haven't been dinning out for a long while so decided to head down to the Edge to celebrate my 50th birthday dinner with my kids.

Certainly miss the buffet there! Crustaceans were fresh, good amount of varieties of food and serving size is still as generous. I thought, due to the covid situation, there would be a lot of changes, but Edge proofed us wrong. We are very impressed. Tables were separated at a good distance, restaurant is not crazily crowded, all staff has masks on and diners are all lining in an orderly manner to order their food. The service was great, staff were friendly, and I was presented a lovely cake to bring home (I'm a member of the PPP dinning programme) Prior to reaching home, I received a text from the PPP team, thanking me for visiting the restaurant tonight. I was deeply touched.

It was a very pleasant dinner, I couldn't have asked for more. Thank you Edge, Pan Pacific, you and your team has made a very memorable evening for us.

Very well done."
Awesome dinner buffet,"It was my family‚Äôs first time visiting edge, we were impressed with the food selection compared to elsewhere. Special shoutout to Shasha as well for serving us so well that night. My parents enjoyed themselves very much! üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª"
Very good Champagne Brunch!,"Would have given them a 5 star if only they can extend their last pour to 3pm rather than 230pm sharp. :) We arrived late and just want a chill out time savoring the champagne before having some food. We're not big eaters, more interested in drinking. Probably 8 tables in total were occupied so I can't really see why they're so strict to stop the pour since all the champagne open bottles will be bin if not finish :)

Pan Pacific has fresh oysters but overall seafood selection is not great. What I like about The Edge is you go to each of their station and choose what you like. No wastage and quality is good. Their dessert selection is well done. Champagne quality is good. Quite like their chardonnay pour.

Our server Jega always appear out of nowhere whenever my glass hits slightly less than 3/4. Amazing service by the crew in general.

Yes will be back and hope they can extend their last pour to 3? ;)"
Feedback,The food quality is getting worse.. something needs to be done. If not our family won‚Äôt be back soon..
"Great service, good food as expected","Buffet has returned and Edge did not disappoint.

You will find familiar fare such as seafood on ice, salad, cold cut stations, Cantonese roasted meats, desserts and much more. Service staff at the stations were prompt and accommodating if you want to request for more than one portion.

Apart from the great food, I had the pleasure of being served by Janice who was extremely welcoming and helped pay attention to our kids while we were there. She had made our dining experience much more pleasant. Definitely a must come for anyone craving a good buffet."
Exemplary Service,Kenneth went the extra mile to give us excellent service. Thank you client for adding in the cockles in the laksa without us asking when you overheard that we hope it comes with cockles. Thank you too for allowing us to pack the birthday cake. It‚Äôs rare to find service staff who takes own initiative
EVERYTHING IS AWESOME ESPECIALLY DESSERT,"Would definitely repeat my experience here at Edge- the warm and helpful service provided by Aisyah, Rose and Prabu made dining a delight - they were so attentive and helpful and even introduced to me a special virgin Singapore sling.

The desserts were the main highlight - reflecting the excellence crafted by the team headed by Chef Eddy, Edina and Shahidah, so many varieties and delectable flavors - it was truly a smorgasbord of delights to behold- I will for sure come back here - especially for the Japanese and Asian platter and the durian pengat- triumphing many of the Michelin star restaurants in town"
Edge Weekday Lunch Buffet,"Great service and good food! Partial buffet set up (staff to serve you at buffet counter and QR code ordering). Service staff were smiley, friendly and quick in clearing the table. Really enjoyed the dining experience here and highly recommended to all!"
Wonderful dining experience,"We have always celebrated our birthdays and anniversary at Edge for many years. Am relieved that dining-in for 2 is allowed as such I am able to celebrate my birthday at our most favourite restaurant.

As it was a weekday, the restaurant wasn‚Äôt crowded, at most 8-10 tables were occupied including ours. Diners were able to physically check the dishes out at Western, Indian and Malay sections, but for the other food selections diners had to order via QR code and the staffs would serve the food to the table. Seafood wasn‚Äôt on the menu but a seafood platter would be served instead and we could always order for repeated items through staffs. A pity that oysters weren‚Äôt available during our visit. Though varieties weren‚Äôt as expansive as pre Covid-19 time, the quality was certainly still there.

Staffs were very prompt in serving our food and clearing the used plates. A special shout out to Jason, the Banquet Manager, who was very friendly and engaging. He gave good recommendation to the food choices and also shared useful information of Pan Pacific Hotel. A big thank you to Ivy who had also served us well and had never failed to refill our glasses with iced lemon tea without us asking.

Overall another hearty meal experience at Edge. Would definitely love to visit again."
Amazing Tasty Breakfast,"The breakfast is not cheap. It is around $40. However, for that price, you will enjoy a spread that is well worth the price. There is a wide array of choices from Asian, Japanese, Western and wide selection of drinks. Drinks and eggs can be selected through the online app. My favourite is the Nasi Lemak. The quantity is small but the coconut rice is rich, and this is accompanied by chili egg. fried chicken. The staff service is also good. They replaced the used plates and topped up the drinks very fast. Well worth the price."
Not coming back anytime soon,"Our party of 4 had lunch here on a weekday and found the experience to be rather average compared to our visit a few years ago. The sashimi and prawns were pretty good, but nothing else stood out. Also, we tried placing an order for wine via the QR code which didn't work for us and when we highlighted the error to the staff, who eventually brought her supervisor over to our table and the latter too was alerted to the problem, nobody bothered to place an order manually on our behalf. Half an hour later, we asked a third staff about our wine and she was just as clueless. Needless to say, we told her we didn't want it anymore as we were almost done with lunch. Close to 2pm, most patrons have left but not a single staff was around hence it was just a dozen tables with lots of dirty plates and glasses. We cleared our own plates just so we could have some room for desserts."
Nice tasting food but bad service,"As we were entering the restaurant, there was a long line of people queuing to enter the restaurant. Our sister was already seated in the restaurant hence we decided to skip the queue and walk upfront. We saw a safe distancing ambassador(SDA) blocking the entry while holding to the safe entry qr code. We asked if we can enter the restaurant as our sister was already seated. The SDA told us to join the queue. We mentioned again that our sister was already seated at the table, can we enter without queuing. SDA said that he wouldnt know where our sister was seating. We were all puzzled with that comment. We asked again to enter the restaurant without queuing. He then directed the question to the restaurant server which he was advised that it was ok. Only then did he allowed us to scan the qr code to enter.

I think what the restaurant could have done better here was to place more safe entry qr codes along the entry of the restaurant, place the SDA person nearer to entry point to observe the operations instead of interfering. More servers should be positioned in at the entry to attend to queries.

After we were seated, the server serving our table 48 saw us seated and approached us to ask what would we like to drink. We asked what was available and was advised ice lemon tea and apple juice. I asked if orange juice was available to which the answer was yes. Then the server moved on to ask the same question to my wife and sister in law. They too asked what was available and the answer came back to be apple juice and ice lemon tea as well. However, everyone ordered orange juice in the end.

I think what can be done better here is to provide a more accurate information of what is actually available.

There was a common negative experience of the roast meat server. Regardless of what order was requested, we were replied with a frowned brow and a irritated toned reply.

There were quite a few more mediocre experience that has completely change my view of the standard of pan pacific group of hotels. I sincerely hope all this will change for the better when travelling finally opens up. This should not be the standard of singapore hospitaity industry."
Great Food n Great Service,"My family is at the Edge on Saturday Brunch to celebrate my son's birthday. We had great food, great service and great company that day!"
I would like to give compliment ti this wonderful Staffs!,"I would like to give compliment to the staff of EDGE Pan pacific, weve been there 5 times of breakfasts.... and it is wonderfully amazing!

The foods are superb! Delicious

The staffs are the BeSt! One of them is Janice. Very friendly and helps and checks on us from time to time. She didnt fail to bring delight to people dining in. Keep up the good work Janice!

And same goes to the staffs of EDGE, from entrance manning the people who goes in and out, the filipino lady but i forgot to get her name. And the uncle who served us the bread. It is so amazing seeing them so happy despite the loads or work they have. That goes to show how willing and happy they are working in there job. Good Job everyone! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è and u all be Strong and take Good care"
Reduced variety of food but great service,"Variety of food available during the weekday buffet lunch was lesser than what was on the menu that the restaurant indicated in their website. Restaurant should indicate in their menu online saying not all dishes are available. The Indian and western food orders were not available via the online ordering app and you will be given a coupon to walk this mini buffet area once and hence better to take a photo to remember the dishes if you need a second serving. We went on Thursday and there were chicken, fish and beef as the main protein in the western area. Seafood selection was ok but the Chinese roast and BBQ pork was average. The laksa was served with crawfish instead of the Boston lobster. Food quality is pretty average.

Overall the number of dishes had reduced compared to the past but our server, an elderly Chinese lady was very prompt, diligent and helpful in her service."
Can‚Äôt wait to go back,"Edge is probably the first place we went to during COVID where we had a buffet in a group of 5. Staff were really attentive, helpful, even though they were really busy. We really enjoyed the desserts and beef.
Will definitely recommend this place and will definitely go back again."
Disappointing dining experience,"It was a disappointing dining experience for the following reasons:

1) 2 plates were not clean as they had greenish stains on them. One of these even had quite a lot of sticky rice stucked onto the bottom of it! When asked to change the 2 plates, the waitress only gave us one in return and we had to ask for another.

2) The spread is limited and didn't seem to correspond with what was reflected on the online menu. When asked where to find the Japanese station (as not in the app menu where we had to order from), the staff didn't seem to knoe and mentioned he would ask a server to come back to me but no one turned up.

3) When desserts were served, no dessert spoons were provided. We had to request for them.

4) The waitress despite wearing plastic gloves also held our drinking glasses by the brim which was very unhygienic as she would had done the same at the other tables.

5) Overall, the food didn't taste fantastic as what I would have expected from the Edge which I had visted a few years back for its buffet. Only a few dishes were great such as the frog legs and spicy fish.

Hope the restaurant could look into the above."
a la carte buffet alike,"We went there for a lunch buffet. The hotel has its COVID19 restriction. While there was a wide selection of dishes, we were only allowed to walk around to see what available and get the food once. After there we had to sit down and order any additional dishes we felt like having. But all additional dishes were customized, we couldn't select according to our preference. It was disappointing as it was not meant for an a la carte buffet. People could forget about what dishes are available for just 1 walk-around. Overall dishes were great (seafood and some hot dishes), but I will recommend people to come back when the pandemic is over."
Lunch (buffet),"Turned up for lunch, and there was a short queue to go in. The seafood (shellfish and sashimi, one serving only per party) was served without asking. The rest of the menu was as online - I would say check the menu before turning up, as everything you need to know is online. Orders were submitted via online menu, which we felt was really efficient, and food generally served very quickly to the table. Each serving was quite large, which may please some but annoy others, who would prefer smaller servings so they can taste more. Service was friendly and quite efficient, we didn't really have any complaints. The quality of the dishes varied - I would say that it was a reasonably good quality and standard, but with very few standout dishes. Overall, a good (if not outstanding) experience."
"Great range, depth of foods and excellent service from Michele and the team","Always brilliant to come to The Edge at the Pan Pac and enjoy their wonderful brunch with long time executive chef Michele Greggio who along with his fantastic team always look after me.

They don't have the largest selection of vegetarian dishes but they made sure that they catered for me and made up for it in house special cocktails too! They know a way to my heart!

Like many hotel restaurants they were not doing champagne brunches for a while but now have both Saturday and Sunday brunches but with at your seat service. The great news is that in a couple of weeks time they will be opening up their themed kitchens again for customers to visit and choose from and bring back to their tables.

This is really the USP of The Edge with all kinds of cultures and foods which you could pick and choose and have made for you. It really gives them, ahem, an edge....

Recommended!"
"Lunch buffet, Breakfast","Service was good especially by Sasha, with a surprise cake as it was my birthday. Lunch buffet could be better with more variety to make the price worth. Breakfast buffet was good otherwise"
Lousy buffet,Oysters and sashimi only 1 serving. still full price charge at $88++ for mostly meet menu. Felt cheates.
The Edge at Pan Pacific Hotel,"I have been to the Edge a couple of times before. It is supposedly a high class restaurant in a 5 star hotel but I am deeply disappointed after my visit there today for the following reasons:
1) selection of food was really limited
2) service was very bad - the servers would come with the food but NEVER bothered to ask who had ordered that particular dish. They would simply leave it at any empty space they can find on the table
3) the servers were serving drinks holding on to the brim of the cups/glasses which is most unhygienic as that is where we would be drinking from and considering that we are still in a covid situation

I would DEFINITELY NOT recommend this restaurant after today's experience!"
Do not go for their buffet spread during this covid-19,"I have patronised the Edge few times prior covid-19 and the buffet spread was great with wide range of food. However the recent visit to Edge for the Saturday lunch was totally a failure. The ala carte buffet menu has limited selections of food. Worst part is some of the items like oysters and lobsters are not found in their menu via the apps. Just so happen we enquire if they serve oysters in the buffet and was told they had it. When we questioned why not reflected in the apps, they couldn't answered. So we have to make wild guess and ask them what is available off the menu? This is ridiculous! Just so happen we ask on oysters..if we didnt ask this would not be known to the guest or probably we have to look out on other tables what type of food being served that is not available on their apps?
The dessert is terrible, durian penyet (sweet pudding like mix with durian syrup) and creme brulee (over cook egg and dry) taste so bad. The dessert menu on the apps you have no idea what is served with no descriptions given.
Some of the main course were serve cold, eg: Popiah and laksa..must have left on the counter for sometime before serving us.
Order food via the apps from 12pm and came at 1pm. Either the food came after 30mins or so and need to order again or suddenly all came at once with 5plates the same food.
The price we had paid for the buffet is definitely not worth considering with such quality of food and services. Better off to dine at Conrad which we did in January.

It also took so time for them to clear the table and serving us our drinks. Simply no one to attend our table at all and we had to keep looking out for the staff to request it.

Definitely not recommending to my friends during this period."
False advertising,"We went for international women's Day and we had a good look at the menu before going. They promised free flow seafood, sashimi and sushi, with one woman dining for free in celebration of international women's day for $78++ which sounded like a great deal. This was right up to one day before women's Day, which was 8th march.
Astonishingly, when the day came, surprise surprise! The menu changed to say seafood and sashimi was only ONE SERVING PER TABLE.
Why advertise it differently, make sure all reservations have been made before changing it on the day itself? Why couldn't they have been transparent with their customers and display this on the menu the week before when they were marketing this promotion so aggressively? I've been to the Edge several times pre-covid and it has always been an upscale modern place. Unethical business practices like this cheapens the whole experience and severely lowers the standard of a restaurant like this.
With a much better understanding of how this place is run, I will never patronise this restaurant again."
Worse ever experience at the restaurant,"This has been the umpteenth time that I had had dinner at the restaurant. As much as I appreciate the reduced offerings and altered services due to the covid situation, the reduced offerings are not worth the price of 88 dollars for Saturday night buffet. There was the removal of the Alaskan crab and snow crab legs and the dessert spread is a shadow of what was previously before Covid. The sushi was dismal and the service subpar. My dinner partner and I had to order from a code and we were unable to customise our order and we had to order the fruit platter four times before being served. We were also housed at a table that was unable to accommodate the huge dishes that the items came in. I was also to our dismay to witness the chefs playing catch at their seafood stations. With such reduced offerings and services, this was the worse ever experience that we had at the restaurant. I would urge the management in reviewing the services for a good customer experience."

Disappointed with food and service at edge,"Had breakfast and dinner at edge, which was terrible.
Firstly was the service they displayed a extremely fouled face when we requested for utensils/condiments from them. One of the service man whom I failed to get his name, even glared at my mom when we requested for dessert spoon.
Next was the meal itself, the choices were pretty limited. Most of the food I receive were already cold. We heard good stuff and had high expectations of pan pacific hotel, but this 1 night stay here was disappointing due to overpriced meal that we had over at edge."
Amazing Sunday Brunch At Edge,"As we are staying in Pan Pacific Singapore, we booked their Sunday Brunch on Feb.7. We were given 30% discount for being a Discovery Gold member wohooo!!!
Upon our arrival at the restaurant, we were cheerfully greeted by Janice and assist us to our table. I always remember her as she always serve us during breakfast whenever we are staying in Pan Pacific. She always check on us ,asking if everything is ok or if we need anything.
Food were also fantastic despite it is served buffet ala carte. Oysters are fresh and prawns are perfect. There are no more Snow crabs served, hopefully they can bring it back.
Their Cantonese and Peranakan dishes were also fantastic as well as the desserts.
We look forward to dine in here next time."
Lovely place for breakfast,"Had breakfast here as part of Staycation stay at Pan Pac. as we were staying on club floor, there was added benefit of champagne served during breakfast. Staff here was really friendly and proactively in offering the champagne. Food quality here is good too, i liked it when food are served warm/hot which is the case here. Despite being a la carte buffet, staff was proactive is asking us if we want more items. Definitely a recommended place whether one is staying at the hotel or not."
Always eager to please and good food,The owner is always very eager to please and the food and drinks very good. Enjoy the steaks while your there and an old fashioned.
Good food,"Service was fast, after you order the dish it was served in a few minutes. Although limited food choices it was all good, especially the rojak. Favourite dish was the grilled set and and pork dish very soft and tasty."
Fantastic Brunch!,"We went for the Sunday Champagne Brunch this past Sunday. We have been previously and as previous experiences, the brunch was amazing again! We love the ordering system via our phone, and the service to bring the food is so fast, it's amazing! There is such a huge range of food: everything from seafood to Thai, Malaysian, Indian and local delicacies, as well as western delights and a really lovely selection of desserts (make room!). We have found that the service at Edge is really exceptional, and this time, we were made so welcome and served like royalty by a lovely lady called Rosemary! It was so relaxing knowing we were well served by such a nice person. We will be back again!"
"Cold, Bland, Slow","Food, especially the soups, the meats, and the grilled dishes, was cold when they reached dining table. Dishes like laksa was bland and average at best. Service was slow and low-touch, but I don‚Äôt blame the miserable number of staff who had to run around a spacious restaurant. I won‚Äôt step in in the offing."
Thanksgiving Dinner,"We made the right choice to celebrate Thanksgiving here.

We were spoilt with choices from the ala carte buffet menu. Go for the sashimi, seafood platter, grilled food, meat carvings and save some space for the long list of dessert selections. There are also many choices of complimentary drinks - tea (many types), coffee, iced peach tea & juice.

All that for only $98++ per pax and in addition, we received 30% discount as Discovery member.

We‚Äôve made reservation to return for Xmas."
Super service & food!,"My friends & I came to the Edge for lunch seafood buffet. The staff are all so friendly & helpful! One of my friends is a vegetarian & doesn‚Äôt eat garlic or onions, so the waiter (Suresh is his name I think) said that he‚Äôll ask the Chef to make it without those ingredients for her & he also brought the food to our table to let my friend know it is garlic/onion free. He also charged my friend kid‚Äôs price (half price) for this. Wow so blown away! The other waitresses who attended to us were also v helpful & friendly & knowledgeable about the food/desserts when we asked her, I didn‚Äôt get her name but she‚Äôs Malay lady I think..
The food was v good & fresh, & I especially loved the oysters, so fresh, succulent & big!
Even the people at the hotel lobby area (ground floor) are v friendly. One of the younger ladies helped us to take very nice photos at the Christmas decoration area, & the elderly man is also v warm & friendly.
Super recommended"
Not worth a visit during circuit breaker,"It is quite disappointed to know that the buffet is not worth the visit during the circuit breaker. This is because (1) the orders arrived very slowly and (2) not many variety of dishes to choose from. I have ordered the salad and surprisingly i was given 2 chunks of plain lettuce without much dressing and other kinds of salad to go along with. The food portion was quite small and we had to order a few times to reach the reasonable portion. Given the price they are charging (SGD $62++ per pax) , i might as well spend it on fine dining."
Brunch Covid Style,"We decided to try the Sunday Brunch as three types of oysters was highlighted, and the food images look good. The good points. The champagne was served generously throughout the meal. The Red Snapper and the beef tatar was delicious. The bad points. The oysters could not be ordered seperately, instead the waiter suggested that we order many seafood platters and just eat the (two) oysters and leave the rest, which is not how we like to do things. Anyhow the oysters was dried up, probably opened well in advance, the lobster was watery. The sausage was ordinary. To make a long story short few of the dishes served were above average, and some presumably prepared long in advance. While we appreciate covid restrictions, when you pay S$ 128++ without champagne we do expect an above average meal. This was obviously not one of them."
Horrible,"Been patronising the edge for a few years, but after covid it became a joke.
Menu have shrunk considerably and the worst is most of the food comes in a fixed platter. For example the sashimi platter is one tako, 1 tuna and 2 salmon, you can't omit or add in anything. Sushi is even worse, serving you stuff worse than $1 sushi.
Seafood platter is horrid, there are no more king crabs, instead you get crabs worse than decent hawker centers.
They implemented an app for you to order food but it was not working, so the staff had to take orders by hand. But it was extremely slow and the first hour was just waiting and fumbling with the broken app.
Orders came slowly and alot was wrong or missing.
Food quality overall has dropped lower than mariana trench. Some of the food legit taste worst than frozen/instant you can find in supermarkets.
Will never ever come again, even if its free."
Overall a good and satisfactory dinner! But services can be better...,"Formerly known as Global Kitchen, located on lever 3 of the hotel, which we used to patronize quite regularly then (as we were members of PPP), the restaurant has since undergone major facelift and renovation and now is more cosy, trendy and nice. The warm lightings and decors do make diners feel homely and comfortable.

We were here for the Sunday buffet dinner and surprisingly, the restaurant was quite crowded, as most of the tables available were occupied (taking into consideration the social distancing approach due to Covid19). After taking the temperature and safe entrying, we were led to our table.

It was having the Seafood Ocean buffet, offered via ala carte format, in which diners place orders and the food would be served directly to the diners. Overall the menu was quite extensive, covering seafood, cooked, international, asian and local cuisines and nothing much to complaint as the food were generally nice and yummy.

The seafood were fresh and nice, such as the lobsters, oysters and prawns, besides the chilli crabs (though the sauce was a little too sweet and lack the spiciness), sambal grilled squids were nice, roast meat etc, all were nice and yummy. The corn soup and herbal black chicken soup were nice too, not too thick or overly herbal taste. The red snapper, a small piece of fish in a large plate was a little bland, and quite wasted for being place in a big plate.

Other items like the rojak, desserts in particular, the durian penget, pastries, cakes and kuehs were nice. Do note that besides coffee and tea, juices like iced lemon tea and orange juices were inclusive in the spread. It would be perfect if beer and/or wine to be inclusive as what some other restaurants are doing like Shangri La, Conrad etc)

Well, we didn't order all the dishes and there were others like the laska and satay, Japanese items were left out as the day before, we were just having the Japanese buffet at another restaurant.

For the service aspect, generally it was good as staff were polite and efficient in clearing the used plates and utensils from time to time. However, there were 2 aspects I would like feedback upon.

First, the restaurant did not have a physical menu and diners were required to scan the QR code on the phone to see the menu. Well, for the younger diners, this may not be a problem but what about the seniors and elderly? In our company, we have 2 very independent senior citizens and asking them to read from the mobile phone can be quite challenging due to the small words. So the restaurant should have some physical menu on standby to cater for this group of diners. For us, we ended having my spouse to place the order the entire night as our seniors decided to give up ordering since reading from the phone is not easy for them.

Second, in terms of placing orders. Initially, it was quite ok as orders were taken quite promptly but as the night went on, the service tend to slow down a lot from the middle of the session. On a few occasions, we had to signal at least 3~4 times to get the attention of the walked past staff to place our orders but were told ""please wait; i am not the person to take orders; or wait a while for my colleagues"" etc.

Yes, we do understand that staff maybe busy attending to other tables or clearing the used plates. But these were no excuse from differing so much from the initial service.

In fact, what they can do is to do what other restaurants are doing, using the install tablets/pc of each table to place orders or more conveniently to use a bell/alarm where diners press and the reception will see the table number and come to the respective table to take orders. This will be much more productive and responsive than what they are doing now. In fact, this was quite a letdown since there were good reviews on the service level which we didn't really feel so.

And for a handful of servers, mainly female foreigners from the ascent they speak, they needed to buck up their level of ""smiles and not pull a long face"". And by around 9.30pm, staff came and informed us that we should get going as the main hotel entrance would be closed and locked in about 15mins' time? Are we in prison and being chased off so instantly as we still had food on our tables and had swallow the food and rush out? The diners from the 2 tables next to us, if not mistaken, Vietnamese, were also quite ""shocked"" to hear this and had to quickly finished their food and walked out. They should have informed us earlier, like 9.00~9.15pm to allow diners have reaction time to finish their food or the food will be wasted if not consumed and had to throw away.

In terms of pricing, it was reasonable considering the spread and quality of food (~ $88++ per pax) but members of PPP can enjoy 20% discounts.

Overall, we enjoyed the dinning experience and the food but the service offerings can be better and improved.

Probably service was one of the key reasons in the past why we had stopped coming back here since our last visit years ago. Of course, during this period of time, we have visited other hotels/restaurants, on par or better, in terms of star ratings, both local and abroad. We hope they will improve."
Very good service by Jac & aunty Ivy,"Good variety of delectable food. Buffet dinner now served at the table upon your order. Service is perfect today. Very attentive & friendly staff, especially Jac & aunty Ivy, who made sure we are well fed & felt at home. Aunty Ivy's first night at the bar & she made very nice Teh tarik. They completed our night."
Buffet Lunch.. COVID style,"Glad to be able to enjoy Buffet during Covid-19. However, it is served in platters rather than self service due to Social distancing. Variety of menu.... Grilled Sambal Malaysian platter is excellent...And durian desserts."
Delicious food in difficult times,"After Covid 19 struck the world, the F&B industry has to quickly adapt to the new regulations given to them.

Edge Restaurant truly is a shining star.

The QR code menu provided had less, and it also had more than the usual pick-it-yourself spread.

The Clam Bakar was a dish I have never seen them serve before, and it was spicy and sour enough (one serving did not come with the calamansi though)

The Alaskan King Crab legs were a little disappointing though, more of the segments given to us were bland and tough. (had to remedy that with lots of lemon juice and tobasco)

The staff were all hard at work and trying their best to adapt to their new jobscopes. Everyone smiled, provided very prompt table service despite the seemingly endless stream of customers they had to handle."
Great food but service is the star here.,Great food and the service staff is great. Will try to cater your request. You want mantou without crab? You got it! You want fuirt plattsr with extra lime. Yes sir! Right away. Worth every penny spent.
Seafood dinner buffet (new normal),"Buffet dining has changed and the new normal sees us seated permanently. A QR code gives you access to the menu and all you need to do is call the waiter and inform them of what you‚Äôd like to have and in a few minutes it is delivered to your table.

All in all the food was good and we had an enjoyable time at Edge. Friendly staff and delicious food. Social distancing was enforced and dinner groups were kept decently separated.

The food portions are decent and you don‚Äôt have to worry about having a huge plate of food brought to your table. If you like something then you are able to order it as much as you like so no issue there. My personal favourite was the seafood spread and I enjoyed the King crab very much."
Edge of Glory,"Went there to celebrate my friend‚Äôs birthday and everything was above and beyond. Our server ensure that all plates are cleared and that we enjoy as much as possible, she even recommended few dishes, sadly we were not able to get her name, but to you Chinese auntie, you are the best among the rest. Thank you for ensuring that we enjoy our dinner. To Charmaine, the host, you are an angel. Everything was to our expectation, except for the reservation part that needs improvements. Always repeat and reconfirm the reservation so you could have accurate details. Nobody wants to find a missing reservation. But aside from that, all is really perfect."
Family Lunch @EDGE,"Nice family place but food was unhygienic, found a long hair in Chai-po/Shui/kua, bought it to the chief and he took it away without any apology. Service is lousy, ask for coffee and was told ‚Äúgo collect yourself‚Äù"
NOT one of Singapore's famed cheap eateries,The Pan Pacific's buffet is priced well above our working class budget for lunch or dinner but we splurged there for breakfast twice with no regrets.
Breakfast is ok but super bad service,"My family and were having breakfast at the hotel and was serve by a server name Shasha whom provided the worst service ever and ruin our day . As our group was getting larger, we ask her to combine the table for us but she just pulled 1 chair over and that it.Until we want to do it ourselves then she do something about it.
Not only she is unwilling to do it and shown unhappy emotion , she also accidently dump to my sister without aplogising and continue her attitude.

We don't really deserve this kind of treatment and seriously we treated her with politness and smile . A basic courtresy from her will be great right."
Lunch buffet,"Mix of cuisines, too many options to choose from. Live counters also there like for barbeque and pasta.
It was chinese new year special menu, and hence price little higher than usual buffet price.
Wide variety of sea food too, I liked japanese section (new to my taste buds).
Some options listed in buffet menu were missing in menu... still that's ok.

Only 2 suggestions: Restaurant can improve on desserts section, not as delicious as they look. However, free cake offered on anniversary was too tasty. I think it had rum... cake was finger-licking!
Also, lunch buffet time is too less... with a baby to handle."
Good Place for Buffet,The location of the restaurant is good. The atmosphere is also similar good. The wide variety of choices of the buffet is a plus and hence can catered to all. The food themselves were great.
Good service and wide range of food,Good service and they have a wide range of food. My girlfriend and i enjoyed our experience there! It was a memorable experience.
Excellent buffet spread but quality not quite there,"Come here if you like a ridiculously wide international buffet spread that ranges from Japanese to HK to Nyonya food. Dessert spread was also fantastic. However, quality of food was not really there. Nonetheless, good value for money buffet."
Certainly worth a revisit,Great variety of food revolving the theme of Chinese new year. It was a pleasant surprise on the overall. Worth to revisit.
Best Brunch ‚Äì Ever.,"Having lived in Dubai the home of big brunches I would say this slays anything we have experienced before. Awesome food quality and variety, champagne flow and service. Pricing is amazing for what you receive, this would be the only place in Singapore that does Brunch right."
Excellent buffet with high quality food,Celebrated my wife's birthday at Edge Food Theatre and we were very impressed with the quality and variety of food offered. Special mention of the alaskan King crabs and oysters which were fresh and succulent. All the dishes were delicious and well prepared. Service was prompt and servers are friendly as well. Desserts corner also had a good variety to satisfy your sweet tooth. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and definitely will be back again!
lovely brunch,this place has a great brunch and the staff are mostly friendly (front of house could smile more) but they need more vegetarian options great xmas brunch and nice cocktails always nice to come here
