Impromptu Late Lunch,"Nice ambiance and cozy!
I having their Green Curry Beef with Rice & Mango Blue Jamine Sticky Rice, recommended by their service staff. Special mention to Eikman & team with thier finest service and warm smile! Ended up ordered Truffle Fries for to go, HAHA. highly recommended"
Lunch with family,"When I looked at the menu before visiting I was looking forward to try them out. Sadly, food was disappointing. Esp the beef. The meat was really tough and the presentation, smell and taste all failed."
"Delicious and authentic thai food, great experience","We booked a table for 5A+1C at short notice and it was good that they could accommodate us for dinner on Mother’s Day. The restaurant was fully booked but thankfully our order came pretty fast. We ordered the crispy lemongrass seabass, green curry, tom yum soup, crabmeat omelette, pad thai, roasted chicken and a gravy dish with crabmeat and noodles. The plate are of a good size. I have to say, we enjoyed every single bite of the meal. The tom yum soup, crabmeat omelette and pad thai, are certainly a favourite of mine. Also, considering the quality and portion, the price is reasonable. The service we received was great too (especially from Justin) and we will definitely be back again. We left feeling very full and happy! Would highly recommend a visit."
Enjoyable Mother’s Day Celebration,"Was pleasantly surprised that our last minute booking turned out so well. As we were a huge family group of 20, we were assigned outdoor seating. The spacious seating was perfect as we had 10 children with us. Justin provided regular updates on the weather. And thankfully weather was just perfect. Service is prompt and food is reasonably priced, tasty and came piping hot. Highly recommend if you have a big group of diners!"
Authentic Thai food at affordable pricing,"Celebrated Mother’s Day with my in-laws on Sunday. Everyone loved the food, it was almost like eating in Thailand without actually flying there.
Food was served very promptly despite the restaurant being at full house both indoors and outdoors. Though they only had 3 staffs on duty, service was not compromised at all.
The fluffy omelette was done to perfection. Trust me, I am Thai. Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and not drenched in oil unlike most places. The Tom yum soup and mango sticky rice reminded me of home.
Will definitely return again soon to enjoy their delicious food again!"
"Bad service, long wait time for food, wrong order, overly priced","Made a reservation via eatigo for mother's day celebration on 7pm on 28 April 22. Arrived and was told only the outdoor seating is available. Not too happy about it as I have made this reservation way in advance. Insisted that we take the indoor seat, so was given one just facing the entrance. Well that was ok but throughout my dinner there was a 4 seater table that was 'reserved' but was unoccupied until we left. Food was overly priced. Few pieces of chicken for the red curry priced at $24/-. Crab meat Omelette priced at $22 but there was no crab meat to be seen and was soaked with oil, ask the waitress to check if that was a wrong order and yes it was. The replacement order came only like 20mins -30 mins later and i still cannot see any crabmeat in the omelette. By then our other dishes and rice were cold. The Crispy lemongrass sea bass was a full fish on the e-menu but when it was served it was already sliced up into pieces. The pics does not depict what was served. In all, it was a very bad dining experience and the bad service makes it all unpleasant. Despite the rather nice ambience of the restaurant, I rather be going elsewhere for better quality food at a cheaper price and better service. Had good expectation having read quite good reviews but I was very disappointment."
Delicious and comfortable place,"Omg this is very nice and delicious This restaurant is really good, you have to try it, it tastes right for the Indonesian tongue. the service is friendly, the food is served very fast"
"Authentic, updated, fresh and delicious","What a surprise find. A bright and elegant space serving up authentic Thai flavours with a good spice level. Everything was well prepared, downright delicious and beautifully presented. Will be our go-to Thai place in Singapore. Service was warm and friendly. The outdoor terrace would be a relaxing spot for early evening drinks. Perfect for family, with friends or even for business."
Delivery to home,"Mr Justin was really patient to attend to my request, hard to come by as more services come along. Missing items were refunded as well and we were well-informed. The servings were large and food is nice! Will definitely be ordering again!"
Great food,"Orders the lunch bento boxes for an office event. Was well put together, food was really good and fresh. Packed neatly and professionally and delivered on time."
Ordered Yu Sheng for takeaway for CNY,"Whatsapp response was very prompt and responsive. Ordered their Yu Sheng for takeaway at 4.30pm, self collected at 6pm.

Yu Sheng was really good and portion was good for 6-7pax even though stated as 4-5pax. One of the better Yu Sheng we had."
Awesome Thai food,Repeat Order for their bento set for company lunch. Very impressed with the food quality. Thumbs up.
Bento Delivery,We had ordered 25 sets of Bento and was great that Justin follow up closely with our order. Did a few special request and Justin even offered a special set to cater to our needs. Food was delivered on time.
Food delivery Benton boxes,The Bento boxes were sumptuous!! There were appetizers and really amazing mango sticky rice. Food was very well received by my colleagues. We enjoyed our meal thoroughly and will purchase again!
SG56th Birthday Set - Great team,"We ordered 30 sets of the SG56th Birthday Set for a corporate event. Order and delivery were carried out seamlessly to 30 different addresses. Feedback of the food was great and portion good for at least 3 persons. Good job, Justin and team!"
Excellent Thai food,"Was very surprise that the takeaway food still taste very nice after more than 30 minutes. The seafood glass noodle and the basil chicken, both are very flavorful with lots of ingredients. The mango sticky rice is also very tasteful by itself even without eating with the mango. Overall very happy with the taste & quality of the Thai food from Blue Jasmine, highly recommended...."
Excellent Thai Cuisine,"We had the opportunity to try a wide range of delectable Thai food from Blue Jasmine. The portion for all the dishes were very generous and every box was packed to the brim. Every single dish tasted delicious and one could really taste the effort and hard work put in by the chefs at the restaurant. I particularly enjoyed the seafood glass noodles as well as the crabmeat omelette. The mango sticky rice was a perfect ending to a palatable meal. The blend of flavours from the sweet mango to the blue sticky rice, along with the crunchiness of the peanuts and flavour of the coconut sauce was truly a match made in heaven. I am definitely looking forward to the day I can dine in and enjoy the ambience of the restaurant as a perfect compliment to the scrumptious meal."
SG56th Birthday Set,"Was pleasantly surprised by the Thai coconut Chicken soup that came as part of the lunch set for 4. The taste was great, not too spicy but flavorful. The glass noodle appetizer was also tangy and nice. The restaurant had deboned the seabass and we had a great time enjoying the deep fried fish fillet. Finally, the red ruby dessert completed the wonderful lunch with a sweet punch. The restaurant staff was responsive to queries and overall it was a good experience."
National Day 2021 lunch,Both dishes (prawn pad Thai and seafood glass noodle) we ordered were good and value for money. Will go there and dine in one day after 10 Aug.
NDP Set,"We ordered the NDP set from Blue Jasmine for dinner and it was such a treat for us. Firstly, the glass noodles was packed full of incredients like minced meat, prawns and squid, and it was a really appetising starter. Next, the seabss was fresh and tender, and the yummy red curry sauce just coated each piece of fish perfectly. Followed by the flavourful coconut chicken soup, which had a nice bit of spiciness and was still warm despite the more than 30 minutes delivery time (and we didn't even eat it immediately). Last but not least, the bua loy dessert was smooth and creamy, with plenty of delicious red ruby, pretty glutinous rice balls, and chewy nata de coco to go around - the perfect finish to a wonderful meal. We will definitely go for Blue Jasmine again when we are looking to treat ourselves to awesome thai cuisine.

On a side note, would also like to mention that their customer service is superb. They are very responsive and would not hesitate to share recommendations and ongoing promotions. You can talk to them via Whatsapp, so it's really convenient. :)"
"Good Thai food, Highly Recommended","Ordered the “Bento set of 5” deal. Food was tasty and sufficient. Family was happy overall.
The mango sticky rice was awesome."
Great takeaway option,Bought the lemongrass fish bento for my family. It came with a generous portion of fish with the right amount of spice. The mango sticky rice is yummy too. Highly recommended.
Flavourful dinner,Ordered for delivery. Food was yummy and flavourful. My family loved the signature crab cake and Thai coconut chicken soup most.
Very flavourful,I got the food delivered to my home. It is very flavourful. Definitely met expectations. Thanks for the good meal.
Great thai food,"Service was great, the manager was very helpful. Had to order takeaway due to covid restrictions but the food was still as good!"
Delicious authentic Thai cuisine,"Due to recent Covid restrictions (and also convenience) we decided to order in from Blue Jasmine, and were absolutely blown away!
The delivery was prompt, food came piping hot, nicely packaged and arranged.
Everything we ordered exceeded our expectations, and our favourite was the prawn Tom Yum soup. It was simply amazing! Spicy and tasty, the soup had everything we wanted and more.
A few notable mentions: the Basil Minced Chicken and Pomelo salad

Highly recommended even for delivery!"
Fantastic rice bowls,Their rice bowls came packed full with ingredients; tasty minced basil chicken topped with a perfectly done runny centered sunny side up. The boss is also very friendly and accommodating. I would strongly recommend ordering your business and group lunches here. The service and food are both impeccable.
Best Thai Cuisine Even When Delivering In!,"Due to the lockdown in Singapore, we couldn’t visit restaurants as a family, even though we were celebrating a birthday.

Therefore, for the special occasion, we decided to order in Blue Jasmine’s Thai cuisine. I was quite surprised that the dishes were quite affordable, even though we were feeding about 8 of us!

The food was awesome! We were so pleased we made this choice - felt like we managed to bring home a part of that premium Thai restaurant feel and cuisine.

Great choice! We couldn’t help ourselves and ordered in again the following week

Special mention to the Manager Justin Yeo who personally took time and effort out of his day to guide us through our questions about the menu while ordering, and even bring our order to the pickup point!

Thanks again and we look forward to placing another order soon"
Bento sets,Boss ordered bento sets for all is the food was inside each bento set was super generous and their chilli for the crab cake and mango sticky rice is to die for.
Good empathy staff,Food was pretty ok as staff try his best due to the infux of people. Price is reasonable and do try it yourself.
Review,food was great. Service was excellent. Will definitely come back again. I recommend everyone to come and give it a try.
Blue Jasmin! Good food!,"Ordered a couple of cuisine. Ranging from crab meat fried rice to fried chicken to salad and many more just to name a few.

The food are absolutely delicious and service are great too! A plus point to note is the packaging of the food are well packed! Food still remains warm and quality of food is not affected despite having it takeaway. Highly recommended indeed!"
Company Bento,"The food portions were generous and food quantity are nice.
Person In charge was really responded on time and will assist to re confirm for the order all the way until the food was delivered to our company ! We really appreciate for this .
Will order again when there is gatherings again :)"
Father's Day Take-Home Set - 6 pax,"Heard about the Blue Jasmine set menu on social media, was curious, so decided to try out their Father's Day special. As dining-in was not allowed, they offered delivery service at a fee. Though delivery was slightly delayed, the food was still nonetheless warm as it was kept in thermal bags. Food was pretty good, especially the appetizers, as well as the Coconut Chicken Soup and Thai Orange Fish Curry. The sundried chicken was a tad dry, but still acceptable. Nonetheless, I would definitely go back to the restaurant in the future to have their food served fresh instead of a takeaway. In terms of service, I would say they are top notch."
Peter Lim;,"Order for home delivery. Service is prompt, well packed and generous on utensils. Food is very good and the whole family all enjoy our dinner."
Great option for business lunch,Have been ordering their bentos since last year for business meetings and everyone enjoys the food. Prompt service also makes ordering easy and worry free!
"Good Service, Good Food","Our family had called in to the restaurant (strongly recommended by a friend) ordered a Mother’s Day meal for 6 persons. It was for self-pick-up.
Justin attended to us when we were there to pick up the food. His friendly and professional attitude was impressive. Food was very good too. We would definitely dine-in at the restaurant when Phase 2 is lifted.
Thank you Justin and Blue Jasmine."
Fantastic service and excellent food!,"My girlfriends and I had our lunch at Blue Jasmine. We were celebrating a birthday for one of our friend hence brought our own cake. Staff was very helpful and coordinated with us on the planned surprise. They provided us with plates and forks for our cake even though the cake didn't come from the restaurant.
Dishes recommended by the staff were delicious and ample.
Despite the restaurant being busy, staff served and assisted with smiles.
Good job to the management in keeping the staff motivated."
Nice food,Went to Blue Jasmine to have lunch on 15 May with friends. Service was slow but food are yummy and price quite reasonable.. Love their desserts..
Mediocre portions for Mother’s Day Takeaway Set,"Ordered the set for 6 pax but food portions really mediocre - how are the 2 takeaway boxes of blue pea rice sufficient to feed 6 pax ? Food was also very average.
We ended up topping up with other dishes from elsewhere."
Bento delivery order,"Made an urgent request for bento lunch delivery with special dietary requirements. I was definitely impressed by the responsive staff who saw through my request without hiccup. Justin reassured that the dietary requirements were met; delivery was smooth and made on time; last minute changes were entertained. Bento set variety was great and inclusive, including halal options and choices for vegetarians and vegans. General feedback about the food was positive. I would surely revisit for good Thai food... a hidden gem!"
Authentic Thai Cuisine,"Heard about Blue Jasmine over radio a few times and we decided to give it a try, the food is nice and authentic. The tom yam soup comes with 2 choices, with prawns and sea bass, clear or red soup base, tom yam soup is tasty and spiciness is just right. The dessert was good as well especially the Thai chendol. When making payment after the meal, I ask the cashier if I can have complimentary car park coupon for my parking, he agreed and gave it to me, so no regrets dining here at all."
Lovely Alfresco Birthday Dinner,"Celebrated my friend's birthday at Blue Jasmine and the food and service was wonderful!

Staff were very attentive and checked up occasionally if we needed anything as we were the only guests sitting in the open area. The alfresco area was very windy that evening, which made the meal even more pleasant.

Food was also delicious!"
Amazingly authentic thai dishes!,"This place is a real Gem! Fantastic thai dishes. Every dish we ordered, didnt dissapoint at all! Even their desserts are someone to crave for! We will be back again! Service was top notch as well! Thank you for the memorable meal!"
Anniversary date Dinner,"We visited to try their set dinner for 2 to celebrate our anniversary and was very impressed with their food.

Every single dish right down to even simple dishes like their stir fried vegetables, was great with flavours and wok-hey. We especially loved their crispy kangkong, spicy tom yam soup & their sticky mango rice. Even their drinks like thai milk tea and lemon grass was very authentic. One of the better Thai restaurants around and you won’t want to miss out.

Lovely food, beautiful ambiance with good cleanliness and impeccable service. We will be back!"
Songkran Buffet,"Place was clean and tidy. The thai seafood glass noodle was really good. The steamed seabass with seafood sauce was fresh and tasty. The mango sticky rice was the best, mango was sweet!
Enjoyed my meal there.

Server was Jackson, pleasant and cheerful !"
Food was good,Had the buffet dinner special. Place was good. Clean and tidy. Server was attentive. Food is good! Will return.
A Hidden Gem,"Have heard about this place and their weekend buffet, but instead visited it on a weekday. Was surprisingly busy.
Beef salad was Quality nice to have ribeye instead of some other tougher cuts.
mango salad was prepared with anchovies, a very unique twist to this dish.
the Chicken was the best, well marinated and cook properly.

would recommend as a more upmarket thai eatery that the usual places."
Great Food With Great Ambience,"Had dinner there recently, we ordered another bowl of the Tom Yum Soup cause it was just simply delicious! Definitely a great location to have good thai food"
Awesome experience! Food was tasty with reasonable price.,"Awesome experience! Food was tasty with reasonable price. I came late for my reservation. However, the guy on the phone ensure me that the table still reserved for us as we are having my wife's birthday celebration. All went smooth, as expected."
"Great food, good for gathering and catching up.",Staff is nice and friendly! Food comes extremely fast as well even during peak timings.Reasonable price with good portion size.
good thai dishes,"good thai dishes, courteous service; generous portion, nice setting. We particularly like the vegetarian dishes"
Good Customer Service,"Decent food and great service from the staff, especially Eran. There's outdoor seating available and the tables seemed like they were properly sanitized."
Poor Customer Service,"The meal was amazing , I have no complaints about , but it's so sad that this institution is hiding so much disrespect from the Managers towards people of colour . Nowadays is so upsetting to see that RACISM is still a ""THING"", our table was put in a specific location so the other clients wouldn't see us, even more sad when the we asked the manager to talk to the manager and he refused.
He was very racist towards every single person on our table"
Great dinner on Valentine's Day,My fiancée and I visited Blue Jasmine on Valentine’s Day. The team did a great and professional job on that day. The dinner was great and the mood was fantastic. This was my second visit to the restaurant. We’ll definitely be back for your Thai menu in the near future!
Excellent Thai food,We met the chef and she in from northern Thailand. Great food. You can eat inside out outside. Attentive staff. Reasonable price for an upscale hotel restaurant
Great & Quality Food !,"Been to Blue Jasmine a couple of times becos the food are fresh & tasty and the price is reasonable.
Infact the quality is getting better and better. Infact my family enjoyed the meal and everyone left the place feeling satisfied and wanted to come back for more. There were more service staff on that day - so it was good. Staff are polite and friendly"
Extremely bad quality and bad experience dining.,"Blue Jasmine standard quality are far below average expectation and easily term as “terrible”.
Curry chicken have strong frozen taste and not properly cook, and for $25+ dish, only 5 small pieces of mini chop chicken cubes.
$28 squid dish with only half squid.
Quality, quantity and taste are absolutely disappointing."
Thai Signatures Buffet - authentic!,"I came upon Blue Jasmine when Chope was offering 12.12 deal.

The Thai Signature Buffet is ala carte all you can eat with semi-buffet of appetizer, soup, Phad Thai, Pineapple rice and dessert. There is also free flow of premium coffee & tea, lemongrass drink and infused fruit water.

With UOB, POSB & DBS credit card, pay 2 for 3 diners. Plus collect Park Rewards points.

Excellent customer service from the restaurant team. Our Australian friend really enjoyed the dinner, especially the Stir Fried Vege & Tofu, Seabass and Cendol with Gula Melaka. Highly recommended!

Reservation is a must as the restaurant isnt very big but cozy with boutique style."
Delicious!!,Really delectable Thai food. Fast service and simply satisfying. Gobbled down everything. Quiet atmosphere.
Good food and nice ambience,"Blue Jasmine was a restaurant with a nice ambience, the food was generally good and tasty. The green curry and the pad thai was my personal favourites. You have a nice unblicked view of the surrounding area."
The most delectable food,"On the terrace,facing the pool it's the restaurant which can boast of excellent food and drinks menu. The staff is very good too."
A good start to the trip,We stayed at the Park Farrer hotel in Singapore (where the Blue Jasmine is based) at the start of our 3-week trip Down Under.The restaurant offered fast and friendly service. The lamb massaman curry was particularly good. I would visit again for sure
Had a chance to dine at Blue,"Had a chance to dine at Blue Jasmine and it was great !
The wkend buffet is worth the money and the staff are all friendly .
The food selection though not as vast as others , packs a punch in Thai flavours .
Desserts were awesome and the traditional Thai ice tea is a must . All in all wife and i had a great time dining here ."
3's ain't a crowd at Blue Jasmine. 3 diners for the price of 2. Cheapest Dinner Buffet with a spacious seating.,"Location: Conveniently located at the Farrer Park mrt exit (Exit A). Though once entering into the hotel, you gotta head to the lifts and head up to Level 5.

Menu: Note that Friday, Saturday & Sunday dinners, it is ONLY Buffet style. No ala carte available. And with 3 adults in your group, they only charge 2 paying adults (UP: S$42+++ per adult). So come in 3s for best deal. It ain't a crowd in Blue Jasmine.

Food selection: Thai-muslim selection. Highlights: (1) Tom Yum Soup, (2) Cashew nut and raisins yellow rice, (3) Beef pho - Best beef pho I have ever tried in my life.

Desserts were meh. But because it's free flow, we got to decorate our own and made a cake piece out of ondeh-ondehs (imagine brazilian queijo balls stuffed with oozing caramelised coconut sugar in the centre). Staff was polite to provide us candles to help make our friend's dream come true. :)

Service: I appreciate Hisham and Chris' help for assisting us throughout out event last Friday night. Chris was very helpful in returning my friend's degree cert file when she misplaced it too! Kudos guys."
Great Food,This is my second time here and it was as good as I’ve remembered. Special mention to William for his hospitality - he was exceptionally attentive to the needs of the guests. Kudos to having him as the restaurant manager! Will definitely be back!
Good for Breakfast,Variety of Food. Indian Food is available. It is worth to include Breakfast as part of your Hotel Rent.
Delicious food as always,"Came here to celebrate hubby's birthday with the family. As usual Mr Hisham served us with his stellar service.I just want to say that portions seem to have shrunk and I was very disappointed with the size of the crab cake. It was the size of a marble, I kid you not. The restaurant is also no longer halal certified although food supplies are from halal sources. What a shame. The Muslim market is a growing one, so it's their loss. Overall, I wouldn't visit unless using online vouchers. The prices don't commensurate with the portions. Mr Hisham was the bright spark for the dinner experience."
Good Foodl,We been there a couple of times. Food taste better and differen this time and for the better. The only disappointment were (1) waited almost an hour for the food to be servrd (2) the prawns that i ordered was about 3-4 tiny ones and for the price we paid was certainly mot value for money
Overall good,"This was surprisingly good.
I hadnt expected much but was surprised. They are a bit understaffed and some things took an age to arrive
The tom Yum goong was good, as were the crab cakes, the noodles and rice less so
The beef strips were nice.
Be warned its pretty cold in there !"
Great as always!,"We always enjoy coming back to Blue Jasmine, the food is authentically spot on and delicious.It helps that the original chef is still helming the kitchen and the consistency of the food has been kept at a high standard. My favourite is the pad thai. It's often hard to get the balance of flavours right for pad thai, even in Thailand, but the chef here at Blue Jasmine hits the right notes everytime. Service is always good, especially on my last visit. I had the pleasure of being served by William, who delivered service that was on par with flying in a first class cabin on a first class airline. Exceptional!"
Get spiced at Blue Jasmine,The restaurant was an unexpected find and my colleagues and I were Glad to chance upon it. Value for money.
Great ambience and food,"Not my first visit here. Service was alright. Order the mango sticky rice and roast chicken when you are there, they are good. The restaurant is located at park hotel. There is a neighbouring one farrer nearby and both are located on Farrer Park station road. So don’t be confused. Prices may be a little steep without promotion or discount."
Good but small details missing,"We went for the Ramadan buffet, as it was very busy we had a table outside on the pool patio - but there were no fans so very warm.
The usual small touches associated with a Ramadan but were missing, e.g. no dates.
And for those wanting to pray the was no designated area.
If you want to advertise a Muslim meal then some effort most be made here.
The food was acceptable but choices of the buffet were quite limited."
Good Authentic Thai Food,"Overall good authentic Thai food. Skeptical reading those negative comments but its always best to try.

Positive:
-good ambience
-friendly staff..once of them is Mr Hisham.
-good food
-relax outdoor ambience by the pool
-good desserts!

Negative:
-minimal spread of food thou its satisfying to had to try all
-outdoor dining should have more lights as its dim and fans or cooler thou it was breezy during our dining
-tips on do not seat near near the lift area or raised platform as it could hot

Would like to see the negative comments had been looked for our next visits."
Easter lunch disappointment,The food and selection was very poor. Strawberries were so sour my children complained. Cheese had two selections and one of them was Kraft cheese slices. One of the dishes was mislabelled and my vegetarian wife accidentally ate some minced meat. That ruined her appetite. The chicken which I tried seemed old and over cooked. Honestly the quality of the ingredients seems to be very low. Some of the food was stale even though we arrived at the start of the buffet service. I feel ripped off.
Overpriced and Lack of Variety,"We made a booking for dinner intending to order ala-carte, only to be informed during the dinner that they only have buffet in light of the Songkran festival. It was a whopping $52/pax and the mains served was only 1 rice, 1 noodle, 1 meat, 1 vegetable and 1 seafood, and some appetizers like otah fishcake, and thai salad. The tomyum noodle soup was also a complete disappoint taste-wise. The only positive feedback would be their array of desserts. Definitely will not return again."
good tasting but small portions for ala carte,"really yummy tasting. really nice ambience for a family lunch. but portions were small.
place isnt dirty but not spotless either. there were crumbs in the back seat and my son's infant chair had a few stains that I removed myself easily. we were served menus without a drinks menu. we had go ask for one. then we were only passed 1 when we were a party of 8. so we had to ask again.
it wasnt clear who was serving us as well. one plus point was that one of the servers offered to wash my son's non slip infant plate for me."
what a waste of money and calories,"this was my second visit to the restaurant and I was sorely disappointed. the first time I went the food was very good and it was such a delight, this time, the fish was fishy and almost all the items were bland and tasteless"
Not so enjoyable birthday lunch,"Was disappointed to find out that the ribeye was actually stir fry beef with long beans! Aside to the lovely ambience, everything else was very average."
Very much below expectation,"The food offering for the buffet was very limited and the quality is very poor. For the food itself, it would be ok for a $10/pax price, but for $42/pax it is way overpriced. Ambience is good though."
"Delicious food, AMAZING service",Authentic halal Thai food served by wonderful service staff (Hisham & Angel). Perfect for family meals
Wonderful food,"We had a big lunch there to celebrate my friend's birthday. The food was really good. The tom Yam soup will spicy but also refreshing.

I would come here again and if you need to entertain Muslim guests, this would be an excellent choice since it's halal."
Blue Jasmine Restaurant,Place was spacious as it was next to hotel pool. Restaurant was not crowded but service was a little slow as they seemed short staff. However staff were very friendly & helpful one you get their attention
Yumm Spread,"Good ambience, Yummylicious spread of food and deserts. Feel home with the warm hospitality service from the moment we enter till we leave the restaurant- friendly yet attentive staffs."
Reservation at Blue Jasmine on 3 March,"Food was great though portion could have been slightly bigger.
Ambience was good too! Outdoor seats should have a fan of sorts for ventilation.
We shifted inside due to the hot weather.
Would like to thank Hisham too for the great hospitality!"
terrible service for cold food on Valentine's,"Understandably Valentines day would be busy for any restaurants worth its salt, and having looked at the a la carte menu beforehand we were super excited. What we walked into was a cold set-menu with no swap options, and served as part of the assembly line with no personal thought or touch. For around 30 tables there were 4 members of staff, one of whom was permanently stuck to the register. Most tables weren't cleared and in order to pay you have to queue at the til. Not a restaurant I'd be recommending or rushing back to."
Lovely ambience and friendly staff,"Was here for lunch. It has a very lovely calm setting, makes you feel very relaxed. Staff are very friendly and gave a lot of good recommendations. We enjoyed the
Pomelo salad,tom yum and all the desserts. We tried the blue rice to go along with the main dishes. Main dishes size are quite big servings so i recommend to share. Desserts are must try if you visit them. Looking forward to our next dinner visit. We were told they have live stations for dinner.

To the staff Hisham, thank you so much for your attentiveness and recommendations."
A crab-tivating evening!,"A Crab-tivating Evening dinner buffet
$59++ per person

CRABS 9/10
Out of the 3 dishes exclusive to this dinner, the Stir-Fried Creamy Citrus Crab was my fave. Its unique sauce was a fine balance between being sour and sweet and didn't overpower the taste buds; I could still savour the actual sweetness of the Crab!

The rendang-like Thai Spicy Yellow Curry with Flower Crab with Capsicums would have been perfect if it were spicier. Then again, my stomach has a pretty low threshold for these days

The Braised Crab with Egg White Cream Sauce & Vermicelli is indeed lightly flavoured as advertised. I didn't feel ""jelat"" at all even after eating so much of it

Despite being supporting stars, the other Crab-flavoured dishes were just as good. There were generous amounts of meat in the Chilli Crab Sauce, the Fried Rice was fragrant and evenly flavoured, and the Thai Laksa gravy was unlike any other I've had!

OTHER MAINS & SALADS 8/10
The Fried Fish didn't seem fresh. Apart from that, I've no other concerns.

DESSERT 8/10
Their Vanilla soft-serve is light on the milk and isn't too sweet! Also loved the melt-in-your-mouth panna cotta and the savoury-sweet durian sticky rice!

SERVICE 9/10
I appreciated the extra wet towels dished out, especially cos I made a mess while sucking on the juices and meats

The staff were also attentive, friendly, and genuinely service-oriented.

AMBIENCE 9/10
The sofa-like seats were perfect for nua-ing while I took munch breaks. I'd love to sit outdoors when I next return, you can see why through my vid!

OVERALL 8/10
It was a crab-tivating evening indeed, and I'd love to return for more!"
Great place with great food,The food is always excellent and staff are always friendly and helpful. This is our 3rd time here and surely would not be our last
Great Hospitality and Food was good,"I honestly didn’t have much expectations before visiting Blue Jasmine as my friends chose to dine there because it’s Halal-certified. Visited on a weekday and it was pretty empty at night, with just two other tables of guests when we were there.

I had wanted to purchase a slice of cake from Coffee Belt at the lounge downstairs for my friend’s birthday, but the staff went an extra mile to make a call to Blue Jasmine and said they’re able to arrange the cake on the house. The restaurant’s staff was friendly as he brought out a nicely decorated brownie cake for us. It is the little gesture like this that really makes people remember for a long time!

Ordered several dishes to share during dinner and we enjoyed the tom yum seafood soup and pineapple fried rice! We all agreed that dinner was sumptious and delicious, and that we’d all return again next time. Please try their desserts as well, we really enjoyed that too!"
"Bad food, awesome ambience",Food was served real fast but it was not warm. Food tasted bland and nothing like Thai. Rice used seems like inferior quality and mushy. Love the pool side dining and that's about it.
Good Place that Meets Halal Requirement,"I visited for the first time this restaurant for a business lunch - a total of 8 of us.

The restaurant has a resort feel and thankfully we ordered our dishes prior to our arrival and hence, the food were served pretty promptly.

The cuisine is Thai-inspired and hence, an added variety to the rather limited restaurants here that is halal certified.

The food quality (if you compare to non-halal restaurants) would be rated as average as I have tasted better Thai-inspired food. Otherwise and honestly, I can see that care has been taken to present the food well and ingredients were chosen carefully to elevate the dishes.

Portion of the food is rather small and hence, is not really good for sharing. Maybe the carbo items like fried rice are good for barely 2 persons to share, the protein dishes like prawns are just right for one person.

The hotel is located just above Farrer Park MRT station and hence, visiting the place is super convenient. It is easy to get a taxi at the hotel lobby and it is a stone throw away from City Square Mall and Little India."
Great restaurant great hospitality,"Celebrating my husband's birthday. Made a reservation. Upon arrival was greeted and booking was acknowledged. Hisham (the waiter) ushered us to our table and attended to our needs the whole evening. Very cosy, quiet and peaceful place for those romantic undisturbed ambience. Definitely a go to place. Food was superb! Thank you Hisham for the kind hospitality."
Ala Carte Lunch Didn’t Meet Expectations,The food was average and pricey. Noodles and chef recommended dishes were not bad (refer to dish names with 👨🏻‍🍳). Ambience and service was good.
Average,"Unless with friends who are Halal, else wont recommend.Waited at least 5 -10 mins but no one bring us menu until we catch the attention of a waiter who were serving drinks. Waiter don't serve food and clear empty plates from the side of the table where no one is sitting but likes to stretch the arm in between 2 person who are sitting side by side (very annoying). At one point, one of us were taking food and he stretch his arm in to collect a empty plate opposite. So 2 person arms were crossing each other, one with food and one with empty plates. Very unprofessional.Food wise, some were a hit but some missed."
Last Minute Notice No Slot,"I booked early dec for 24 dec 4pm slot. Then I was told on 24 dec itself by a singaporean chinese guy that the slot is no more. I asked him why I was not informed earlier, he argued that he called me earlier on 24 dec but nobody pick up. I mean, come on, if inform earlier, can inform one or 2 weeks earlier or worst case 1 day earlier, and why on 24 dec itself and telling me he already called me 'earlier', only that I did not answer my phone, as if claiming, it was my fault and he has the right to cancel my booking this way. Is it becos I am female that he can anyhow cancel this way??? I feel that the service staffs there who are indians or non singaporeans are more polite and helpful that this typical singaporean sickening chinese guy!!"
"Flavorful food, would have rate 5 stars if it's less salty","We were there for lunch yesterday. Pomelo salad was refreshingly yummy and wok fried morning glory is good too. The stir fried pad thai prawns and chicken green curry though flavorful, was rather salty. Love the coconut pudding, rich and smooth, tempted to order a 2nd serving. Nice ambience, service was good and prompt with good food portion."
Exceptional Service,"Food was near authentic , presented elegantly . Wait staff n Crew where on point . Like The decor. Highly reccomend."
Short staycation,"Had a good short staycation n tried Blue Jasmine food for the first time.Had buffet breakfast there in the morning .In terms of variety not that much but the indian vegeterian corner save it all.Coffee was self service one of the thing missing in any standard 4 star hotels.Overall food was average.Came back for lunch to try their highly rated Thai food . Thumbs Up .We tried Pha Thai large serving a little oily mild taste minus the grinded peanuts.The red Tom Yum is a Must Try.And the Essan Chicken so Yummy.Dessert of Thai Chendol n Mango sticky rice was ok n serving rather pathetic.

My final verdict ,worth a try n will definitely come back for the cosy ambience n price for an authentic Halal Thai Food.By the way we had a seat outside the restaurant by the pool side as they were full house n ours was a last minute booking.Also got some great discount on top of front desk good gestures"
