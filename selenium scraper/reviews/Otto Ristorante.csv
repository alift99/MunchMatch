Great dining experience,It was our 2nd time visit to OTTO and the food & service standard remained great. Love the ambience!!
"Fine food, refined atmosphere","An impeccable lunch at Otto! We both had pumpkin soup that was beautifully delicate, completely yummy. Also fish that was perfectly cooked, again finely balanced and presented most attractively. An excellent meal!"
Sublime gourmet tasting menu and service,"You are guaranteed a wonderful and authentic Italian restaurant experience by the co-founders Paolo and Michele here.

I highly recommend the gourmet tasting menu with wine pairing and extra cheese course.

It's a very happy and positive atmosphere. Service is top notch.

Food is amazing and freshly created and cooked on site.

Highly recommended.

My go-to Italian in Singapore."
Dining Experience at OTTO Ristorante,"The ambience was amazing. Food portion was a surprise. My lamb dish was big. I had a problem with my wrist so I had to chew the lamb off the bone using hands as it was difficult to cut. It was a little unsociable.
As expected, starter portions were rather small but very tasty and delicious. Nothing was difficult to savour. A great place to entertain business associates."
Awesome place!,"Its my first time here and it definitely didn’t disappoint me! great food, great ambience and of course great staffs! Will definitely return again!"
Excellent,"Very few restaurants offer this level of service, the waiters are outstanding, and so is the food. Highly recommend!"
Unpleasant dinner,"The head of the server who is Italian insisted his mistake was the guest's. 6 of us witness what I have ordered and his attitude was so wrong and aggressive toward guests. We were explaining to the only as ""guests always right"". His body language was so rude and really put off all our mood that night, specially there were a table who was drunk and yelling so loud the whole night. The owner Mr. Paolo to apologized and offer free drinks but no one in the mood for."
"Good value, excellent service, great food","A repeat visit and they are always good. Fantastic crew and Paolo never fail to do their best. Go for the degustation, or even a simple pasta is good."
Great Experience,Presentation is nice. Service staffs were warm and courteous. Portion is sufficient. Food is good although I think the level can be better.
Reception service problems,The review is poor because the waiter told my guest that there is no reservation under my name when I am already inside the restaurant waiting for my guest. My guest had to wait for 5 mins and still could not go in until she called me to bring her in.
"Awesome Dining Experience, Great Food",Applaud to the great service for every staff especially Nandan. Enjoyed much all the food serve in the set menu and wine selection was great! Highly recommend for couple dates.
"Delightful service, fantastic food","The people in Otto were very hospitable and patient when introducing the food in season to us. They were also suggested the order of how the food should be served so we are able to enjoy the food best, in the manner it is meant to be appreciated.

As it was a birthday, I requested for a cake to celebrate in advance and was pleasantly surprised that this was done!"
Great experience.,The experience in their private room amazing and service was good. Each dish served was timed nicely spaced. The staff are very professional in what they do. The spaghetti with Uni could have alittle more garnish cause it looks kinda plain.
Outstanding Italian food 🥘,"I had never been there, my wife went a couple of times and convinced me to try, indeed a good choice.
We ate a catalana prawn as a starter and spaghetti with ricci di mare as a main; both were delicious but spaghetti really superlatives.
Ice cream as a dessert end espresso coffe to end the lunch.
The waiters are attentive and kind, the location is beautiful, elegant but not gaudy.
I highly recommend it."
Delicious Italian food,"I visited Otto several times for lunches and dinners and I was always been satisfied.
Delicious Italian food, kind and professional service, beautiful location.
Spaghetti ai ricci are the top for my taste!
Why don't try it? I can't wait for the next time! Well done!"
One of The Best Italian in Town,"Best pasta I ever had, blown my mind. Carpaccio was so good and the dessert was mama miaaa. over all amazing experience."
A Taste of Italy,"Italian food can be found across the island; at various prices points, from the simple Pizza to the up market establishments implying they serve authentic food- but too often the food- has been changed to suit the local palate and or the food falls short of the elegant simplicity of Italian food. Otto Ristorante is true to Italian flavours, keeping it simple and allowing the ingredients dance on your taste buds. Well worth the visit to savour a genuine ‘taste of Italy’ in Singapore."
Best Italian in Singapore,"Supreme gourmet tasting menu with wine pairing created by Chef Michele and served in his own inimitable style by fellow co-founder Paolo. Smiles all round at this wonderful restaurant, probably the best in Singapore! Highly recommended."
Average,Pretty average food despite exceptional atmosphere and very good service. But food was disappointing. Overall ok experience
Great Italian fair,"Got invited to an upscale Italian restaurant in downtown Singapore. Nice and elegant decor, friendly staff and good tasting food. White asparagus is in season and the chef cooked up a great tasting dish with eggs and Parma ham. Their Burrata with ham was also very good. We decided to share thee dishes and it was an excellent way to taste the chefs cooking! Next came the lobster pasta and white asparagus tagliatelle. Again both great tasting dishes. Yum2! The mains we shared their duck comfit, crispy pork and salted baked sea bass. All very tasty pairing with champagne, brunello wine and French carbernet. Desserts we had their Tiramesu, chocolate lava, and meringue dome with milk chocolate. All tasted divine! Price is on the higher plateau."
A Hearty Meal,It was a wonderful experience. The ambiance is pleasant and comforting. The food is delectable and nicely presented. The Burratina cheese topped with Tosini Parma ham was an excellent appetizer. The spaghetti with sea urchin combined with Sardinia grey mullet bottarga melted well in the mouth. The Venetian style tiramisu dessert have a subtle sweetness with just the right bitterness from the coffee and cocoa powder.
Good food and service,Paolo the manager always provide good service and menu suggestions. I have enjoyed my recent dine in very much
Awesome,Been there many times and great each time! I can’t ask for more! Thank you Chef! Thank you Paolo! See you very soon!
Horrible acoustics- dry food,Sat in the main round dinning room for a business dinner. Impossible to have a conversation due to poor acoustics. Had the place been full would have been worse! Food and wine was underwhelming to say the least.
Great service,"Great service, food and experience for a birthday occasion. Their set lunch menu is very worth the price."
"If this is your special day, don't eat here","If this is for a birthday, anniversary, or any special occasion, please eat at a different restaurant.

The restaurant is probably fine if everything goes well but when things don't, they have no idea how to handle it.
One of the waiters spilled the drink all over the showel and dress and had no idea how to react. He hid the spill with napkins and never apologized. Tablecloth was never changed and someone else from the restaurant came to apologize but made a joke about it which was very awkward and says that they don't care if you're not making a scene. The waiter never came out afterwards and saw him looking at us through a window after we left.
Aircon water was dripping into the food and all they could do was to replace the food... which they did 3 times...
We paid the full $400+ and felt cheated every cent. They never offered any compensation, didn't bother to offer to pay for the dry cleaning fee or any other effort to improve the situation.

If this is a night you want to remember, please do yourselves a favor and eat somewhere else. If it's just a casual day/night out, why not, food is okay."
"Elegant restaurant, Excellent Pastas, Service could be better","Had an excellent dinner at Otto’s with friends . The highlight were the pastas. All of us had pastas (different variations of seafood & truffle) which were consistently outstanding . Our entrees eg soup & desserts ie tiramisu/chocolate lava cake were also good. The interiors were elegant & comfortable, & tables were well spaced out.
If not for the fact , service was patchy & a little slow (perhaps short handed); I would have given this a five star rating"
Great on every front,"The service here was so warm and inviting, and nothing was ever too hard! The cold cuts platter was generous (and delicious), and they allow free corkage of up to 3 x 750ml bottles - a real treat in Singapore!!! Food wonderful, and great buzzy vibe."
Still the best Italian restaurant in town,"I am customer of Otto since 2014. Still the best Italian restaurant in town although they didn’t change their menu much. But the Service, food constantly good."
Good food,Food was lovely and you can't go wrong with their pastas and fish selections. I had Amber Jack fish which was super disappointing and extremely fishy. I have However my friend's orders were impeccably made. The restaurant seemed understaffed but its understandable during this covid period.
Superb. 5/5 experience,"Last minute booking so we were really lucky to get a table here. Even with some still quite draconian restrictions in Singapore, Otto is busy busy while a lot of other restaurants are quiet.

The resto itself is beautiful. Whilst I do like trendy eateries with bare tables and cleverly mismatched chairs, you can’t beat a classic ‘white linens’ set up.

The manager (Paolo) is a perfect gentlemen and a cordial host. Indeed chatting with him was as much a part of the experience as the food.

The food then…wow.

The measure of the best restaurants (for me) is to blow you away with the quality of the produce. Some theatre is entertaining but quality quality quality.
The standout for me was the burrata, parma and tomatoes. 3 simple ingredients that can’t hide behind anything else. And all 3 were exquisite.
The best I’ve had infact. Normally my favourite part of this dish is the burrata but I simply can’t stop thinking about the freshness of the tomatoes. And smile.
The lobster served smoked in a Kilner jar was my favourite overall dish. Every flavour was distinguishable and the portion size was perfect. All that was missing was a straw to ensure none of that bisque was left haha.
The mains were delicious. Crispy suckling pig with honey and balsamic was always going to be a winner and the confit duck leg (a classic) had skin like glass. Beautifully executed.

The cheese board was just right for me. Cheese freaks would probably want more but for me it was perfect. The Fior de Tartufo was my favourite.

Finally there was the tiramisu. For me personally I prefer more sweetness and a stronger kick of alcohol; but that is a personal preference and not a criticism.

All washed down with a stunning Amarone (the wine list is superb and (for me) you can’t beat old world wines).

One last comment. Service. Our waitress was superb and I’m embarrassed to say I can’t remember her name. But ‘maraming salamat’ to the superb (and delightful) lady from Cavite who rounded of a wonderful evening.

I’ll definitely be back

ADDITION - for some reason trip advisor won’t find the photos in my camera roll hence no pics"
Lovely meal,"Service is excellent: friendly, professional, non-intrusive. We had a degustation; dietary restrictions were gracefully accommodated. The meal was well-paced. Every course was good, but we especially enjoyed the fish carpaccio and the veal ravioli. It was almost like spending the evening in Italy. The acoustics in the large, round room are a bit strange - it sounded like the Dutch-speaking gentleman across the room from us talked directly into our ears. Will definitely return."
DELIGHT LUNCH DINING EXPERIENCE,"Very friendly service staff. Ordered Set Lunch, 4-variety assorted bread was impressive; appetiser was super - 4 large tasty prawns; main course was very tasty albeit small portion. Very nice dessert and real good Italian coffee. Superb wine too."
Impeccable Service,"I hardly write reviews, but the experience at Otto was really close to perfection. From the great , attentive service, to the excellent food and lovely ambience there was nothing to complain about. Will definitely return. Thanks again ;)"
Well executed except the steak.....,A return visit after a long absence . Well prepared and well presented cuisine. The only blot was one steak which was overcooked
Fantastic food and impeccable service,"I've had the privilege to dine at OTTO several times and I must say that the quality of the food and service is top-notch.

Some notable dishes include: beef tenderloin with bone marrow sauce, slow cooked French duck leg confit, lobster bisque, and wagyu ribeye steak. They also have a set lunch which comes with a starter, a main course, and a dessert at a reasonable price of $38++ (considering the quality of the food). Despite the reasonable price point for the set lunch, OTTO does not scrimp on the quality or the portion of the dishes. After I was done with the main course, I had some difficulty finishing my dessert (even though it was very delicious as well).

OTTO is also a great place for special occasions. If you are feeling fancy or simply wish to treat yourself to a good meal, OTTO also offers a Degustation Menu as well as a Gourmet Menu. As these are multi-course meals, they are best enjoyed over dinner or when you have time to slowly savour each dish.

The staff are also friendly and very attentive. After a few visits, they are able to remember our preferences. I was impressed by their attention to detail and the quality of their service."
Great Italian food,"We truly enjoyed all we had, but the Caciucco (tomato based fish soup from Tuscany) and the squid ink pasta deserve a special mention. Very flexible and attentive service, will definitely be back."
Exceptional service,"We visited Otto for my birthday lunch and had no expectations going in. Glad to see their signature Burratina included in the lunch menu. Starters were perfect. When the main course rolled along, the grouper was perfect but pasta too al dente for our liking, though it is a perfectly normal texture in Italy. The maitre d took our feedback in stride and even surprised us with a nice dessert and cake after our mains. Thank you for choosing to delight your customers. We will be back for business lunches."
Exceeds Expectation,"We only had a limited time to celebrate my husband Birthday and a friend recommended to try set lunch at Otto.

We did not expect set lunch to be that good, the soup of the day was lobster bisque and I've never had lobster bisque so tasty... even my husband who is not a fan for seafood loved it.

My dessert was vanilla parfait with balsamic sauce and black pepper glazed strawberry, just so thankful for the server to insist on this despite my doubt on the name....lol. SOOOOO good!!!

We had 3 dessert because they surprised us with a birthday dessert for my husband, we had it take away because we were full and this complimentary one was equally tasty!!!

My long black was perfect to seal the meal.

Definitely would come again for their degustation menu!!"
Excellent food and service,"We had the lunch set which is attractively priced at $38++
The starter of melon and ham looks amazing. I had the prawn paste bruschetta which was delicious - right amount of paste and tomato, on nicely grilled toast.
The perfectly grilled snapper fillet was well executed on the bed of sautéed mushroom. The orange cake desert was pleasant.
It was a enjoyable lunch."
Amazing food,I loved this place: we had delicious pasta and scaloppine. The food was amazing and I liked the atmosphere. Service friendly and helpful!
Great Italian cuisine!,This has been awhile since I visited the restaurant at different location. The service is excellent with Paolo being the most attentive and provide his best service you can ever get here. The food is fantastic .. ordered the Foie gras that I enjoyed the most with the Bordeaux wine. The uni and scallop pasta not that great as the as the uni has strong after taste and bitterness too. The duck confit was so perfect with crispy skin and moist meat inside. Lots of spice with strong peppery! I love this taste and also balance in taste too. The Wagyu beef grilled to medium rare doneness with special cut. Lovely dessert but we can’t eat a anymore.. hence only chose to eat a scoop of ice cream. Nice ambience and very cosy..
Awesome food and service,Every dish on point! Truffle pasta that’s so decadently good! Australian waygu equally good! One of the best Italian restaurant in SG.
Excellent service & great food,Great food and nice ambience. Staffs are friendly & professional. Price was reasonable considering the quality of ingredients. We enjoyed very much.
Food was nice but service was lacking,"A good dining experience is a combination of food, service and atmosphere and at Otto, the service fell far short of a restaurant of its caliber. The food was very nicely prepared and presented. We ordered their Gourmet Menu and it was fine overall. However, the service was poor. As the meal advanced the time lag between courses increased until it became uncomfortably long and we found ourselves having to flag down the waiter to check on our dishes. The waiter seldom checked on our table throughout the dinner and was inattentive to the wine. Dessert was served without any inquiry about accompanying coffee or tea. It seemed like they forgot about us mid-way through the meal. We expected better given the price level of the restaurant."
Lived up to our expectations,"It was a first visit by my friends in a very long time and a nice place to celebrate one's birthday...
We had dishes recommended by the staff and enjoyed every dish that we had.
Staff is friendly and the ambience was good.
The birthday surprise organised by them added a memorable moment for the evening.
One of our family favourite Italian restaurants esp for the foie gras"
Poor meal,"My second visit to Otto in a month. The first meal was average, this one was rather poor. The linguini marsala with black truffles was a bowl of pasta with a tub of brown butter. I simply could not eat it."
"wow! best vegetarian Italian in Singapore and Paolo Zanin, wow, thank you!","Paolo Zanin set the tone as soon as I returned to Otto for the first time in over 5 years with a welcome smile and a glass of champagne as if I was a regular customer. He recognised and remembered me when he had no reason to do so.

Pure class. He led his staff wonderfully and all were attentive and accommodating.

I adored the vegetarian 5 course menu and they had to change a couple of things as I don't like mushrooms and it was sublime. The pumpkin and gorgonzola ravioli was mouth watering.

My wife has the degustation menu and even there they had to change a couple of things and did so willingly and with fantastic customer focus. Nothing was too much for Paolo and the team.

They don't do a wine pairing but they did for me and it was perfect matching, just incredible service.

It was a Saturday and packed and yet all around us customers were being served as if they were the only ones in the restaurant. Class.

It's also not bank breaking and for the quality of food there are worse restaurants charging much more, credit to these guys for generating amazing ambience and value at the same time, this place is a gem!

I highly recommend you visit, I certainly won't be waiting 5 years to return!"
One of the best Italian food in Singapore,This is the first time I went to this restaurant which a friend recommended - best Italian- will go back again
Overall 4/5,Overall 4/5 Location:4/5 Environment:4/5 Service:4/5 Food:4/5 Drinks: N/A Cost performance value: 3.5/5 A lot of business lunch there!
Mostly good food but small portions,"We had a nice five course vegetarian dinner here, but the portions were small. I think they don't realize that vegetarian food is much less filling than meat. The dessert was terrible - just cookies with jam with some meringue - I didn't even finish it. Even after five courses, we were not full, so won't go back."
Birthday celebration,My first visit to Otto on a weekday night. Ambience was pleasant. Service was wonderful and food were good. Haven’t been dining out often and therefore it was great to be at a place which serves food that the whole family loved!
Birthdate at Otto,"I've been wanting to dine at this restaurant for a while and I was so happy that I got to celebrate my birthday there,

The menu had many options but we opted to share a Hokkaido Scallop with Porcini Veloute with crispy bacon which was to die for, the waiter even helped to split the dish. For mains we shared a Spaghetti with Sea Urchin and Red Mullet. This was the highlight of the dish and I love the umami and saltiness combo. Lastly I had the veal ossobuco with Milanese style saffron risotto. The portion was huge and If I had a larger appetite I may have finished it. However I was disappointed as the risotto seemed a little 'flat' as if it had waited too long before serving.

All in all the service and ambience was great and I will go back there just for the sea urchin pasta."
Anniversary dinner,"Amazing service and food. Though the acoustics was a little bad (noise level was shooting up as the night wore on), the place itself was charming, with attentive service throughout. I had informed them upon booking that it was our anniversary. they made it special by bringing a small dessert with a message to wish us. very thoughtful indeed. I had the cod fish and it was really good. I cannot fault anything we had that evening. I would definitely go again."
"Tasty food, lovely ambience, great service","Lovely place to go to for a quiet, relaxing birthday celebration. Food was wonderful and service was impeccable."
Best Italian food in town,Restaurant offers excellent Italian food in good ambient at premium cost. At the end it is good value for money for someone which is willing to pay for top experience
Always a pleasure,"Food service ambiance - I've never been disappointed in any at Otto. We went for the lunch special, which was carefully prepared, delicious, and all in all not a bad value. Otto is one of my favorite places in Singapore."
Waiter's Body Ordour,We went the second time and was disappointed with the same waiter having a strong body ordour. The food was good though.
Will visit again for White Truffle,Highly recommend Gourmet Menu set. Only comment was the suckling pig dish was a little disppointment.
Friday evening,"First time for me, visiting Otto and what a great place for a lovely dinner together with my husband.
The whole evening, food, wine and service was fantastic.
We was fortunate to have a very service minded waiter who made this evening sublime.
BUT BUT BUT !!!!!!!!
When we was ready to pay for the evening we had a new waiter, also nice, so a bit of small take and joking back and forth, until another waiter/owner approved our table and started jelling to us that if we had any problems with the payment or anything else we should take this with the owner!!!
He was screaming and shouting out so the whole restaurant was really entertained, we was in chock and literally totally understandable about what this was about and asked him what in h...... is going on ???
He then turned around and stared a long speak about other guests who left and have been unpopularity and excuse to us and offered us an apology!!!
Sorry......that was far too long out and far to late and he managed to ruin my evening totally.
I hope he will behave better in the future but it will definitely be without us"
Great value dinner,"Warm service from the staff. Not pretentious. At S$108 per pax for dinner, it is really worth it. Need to mentioned that all of us love the seafood tomato soup! Great succulent beef tenderloin too and the homemade arugula tagliolini with crabmeat and saffron emulsion was flavorful in the mouth."
Good Business Restaurant,"Good location and atmosphere, value for money set lunch menu. Highly recommended for business lunch."
Meraviglioso.....,"First time surprisingly, but first class. Lobster bisque delicious and the ravioli perfect for lunch. We had the private room for an important client and the calmness and excellent service let the conversation flow ... Grazie mille"
Never disappointed,"Had great food, great wine and a great evening. Ambiance and service are compelling... the chef.. not of this world!"
Fantastic dinner and service,"We love coming back here and celebrated our 5 year wedding anniversary this time. First visit since lockdown and it did not disappoint. We have our favourite dishes here (burrata, ravioli w veal, tenderloin with bone marrow, followed by their cheese trolley) and love their outstanding service each time. The wine selection is extensive and they also have great wines by the glass including an Amarone. Can't wait for our next visit."
Sublime Food,"Wonderful as ever - warm reception, excellent service, some superb wines and as usual sublime food. Thank you to the Otto Team"
DOWN TO EARTH ITALIAN WITH A FLAIR,"Our good friends hosted us for my wife’s birthday at Otto’s which is in Maxwell Chambers not Red Dot Traffic Building. It was our first experience there and it was very memorable.

From the start, the manager, Paolo, greeted our host and warmly. He’s the right man for the job!

We ordered risotto, lamb, osso buco, lobster appetizer and the set dinner menu with a bottle of wine.

There were no disappointments with our huge portion dishes. If there was, the Chef, who came out twice to check, would have resolved it.

Beside the outstanding service, great tasting food like an Italian mother might make with a touch of nouvelle flair. We had cigars with dinner at their outside dining area.

Service - Excellent
Food Quality - Excellent
Food Presentation - Very Good
Price - Acceptable"
Great Service from Leif,My husband is vegetarian and he overlooked on the menu he ordered Ravioli with Veal when Leif serving amuse bouche which is a Salmon with ricotta my husband said that he is a vegetarian. Leif right away remind my husband that he ordered Ravioli with Veal then on my husband changed his order to Tortellini. Thanks Leif. Food was really good love my Burratina with Parma Ham and Lobster Linguine. Will definitely come back again!
First visit,"Lovely evening. Great food and awesome wine. Staff were super friendly, professional and helpful. We will be back, with friends for sure. Many thanks."
Otto still the finest Italian,Otto still the finest Italian cuisine in Singapore under the watchful eye of master chef Michele Pavanello. Nothing comes close in terms of culinary adventure and preparation. Dishes are well matched with their libation through the expertise of Sommelier Paolo. If Italian cuisine is what your palate desires then this is the spot - Literally and figuratively.
Ottos is extraordinarily awesome!,"Italian dining at its finest. We have lived in Singapore now for 10 years and Otto's has only ever delighted us. Not once has it failed to exceed our expectations or our friends. Particular favourites are the truffle pasta, the wagyu steak and asparagus (they have a fabulous white asparagus tasting menu when it is in season). The executive lunch is moderately priced in comparison to other fine dining restaurants, which is probably why it's always so difficult to get a table! Book early as often Otto's is fully reserved. If you are going as a group I suggest you ask for a booth (but do call in advance as there are only four). In addition to the restaurant, we really enjoy having a cocktail on the Otto restaurant terrace."
"Great food, okay service","My husband and I visited Otto for dinner earlier this month, to celebrate my birthday. The emails I sent to make the booking were replied to promptly and the responses were friendly and welcoming, so we were looking forward to an excellent night. When we arrived we were warmly greeted by the Italian gentleman at the door and shown to our table. Our waiter promptly brought us menus and told us the specials.

After we ordered we were given a delicious assortment of fresh bread with olive oil, and our appetisers arrived soon after. And they were fantastic! My husband’s pumpkin soup was rich and smoky, and my lobster linguine was spectacular, easily one of the best pasta dishes I’ve ever had, perfectly al dente and full of flavour, with a generous amount of lobster and a sweet, rich sauce with just the right amount of acidity from the roasted tomatoes.

We had a bit of a wait for mains because I’d ordered the suckling pig which has a 50 minute waiting time, and that’s when we began to see a bit of a drop in the service. The restaurant got busier and a lot louder, I had to ask for a refill on my water three separate times throughout the meal, we were kindly offered more bread but our olive oil wasn’t refilled, so I had to catch a server's attention and ask for that too, and my husband ordered a second old fashioned cocktail, which never did turn up.

When the food arrived though it more than made up for the small glitches in service, it was excellent. My husband had ordered the lamb and it was tender and cooked exactly as he'd requested it, and the parsnips that came with the dish were so tasty I kept making him share them with me. And my suckling pig was spectacular, without a doubt the best rendition of this dish that I've ever had. The meat was moist, the skin perfectly rendered and super crispy, but not hard or chewy. And the flavour of the honey balsamic glaze was divine. A truly top notch dish, I can see why its one of their signatures.

Dessert was another wait, again because I ordered the baked apple and raisin crepes which required 20 minutes cooking time. It gave us a chance to reorder that second cocktail which did finally turn up after this reminder, and once again the dessert was well worth the wait. The crepes were light, the filling sweet and well spiced, and the cinnamon sauce that it was served with was so delicious, maybe verging on overpowering, but I am a cinnamon lover so I thought it was perfection when eaten with the crepes, apples and vanilla gelato. A delicious end to a delicious meal. And the dessert was served by the head chef, which was a nice touch and gave us the opportunity to compliment him on the exceptional food. I was a bit surprised though that there was no acknowledgement of my birthday, in spite of me mentioning it in the email confirming the reservation, not even a happy birthday message or candle on my dessert plate! From this level of restaurant I admit I had expected a little extra effort.

So, would we return? In spite of the somewhat lacking service, the fact that they didn't acknowledge my birthday and the noise (which reached a level where we almost had trouble holding a conversation when the restaurant was full), yes, we would. The quality of the food made us forget all about these little negatives, and definitely warrants another visit!"
Enjoyable Italian in Singapore in my first visit to Otto,"This is a restaurant recommended by a Singaporean friend of mine. This is the second Italian restaurant I have visited in Singapore after my move from HK.
It was surprisingly good. I love the restaurant design from the first sight when the car dropped me where the restaurant located. It looks so nice. My guts feelings already telling me “ it must be a nice restaurant “ . I have many Italian friends who n HK and I always visited all those high ended Italian restaurants in HK. I therefore quite demanding in Italian food. When we entered the restaurant , the ambience was so good, from table setting to very details. People working there are friendly and professional. Italian manager and Italian chef. Open kitchen already telling me they must be serious preparing our food. My experience is only good quality restaurants use open kitchen. We ordered our food with good recommendation from them. Taste of the food was excellent . Ingredients are fresh. I enjoyed very much of my tomato with burrata, my pasta My friend ordered wagyu beef and it was so good after I tried two pieces. Price is very good . valued for money. They also prepared a free birthday cake for my auntie’s birthday. We all enjoyed our dinner at Otto. My friend already made reservation with the manager for our next visit before we left the restaurant. Will revisit more for sure. Chef is very gentlemen"
White Truffles!,"Famous for their white truffles dishes. Nice ambience, staffs were helpful in recommending and excellent service"
Definitely coming back for a wonderful dinner experience!,I had a dinner for my husband's birthday. The servers were very kind and professional. Especially the manager had a good sense of humor and very friendly. The food was absolutely delicious. The burrata and aged ham salad was so fresh and the uni spaghetti was top notch! It was the best uni pasta I've ever had! Also there were wide selection of wine to drink and the price also are wide to choose. I am definitely coming back.
Seriously All About Food.,"Otto’s came highly recommended, & it didn’t disappoint. We had a small family dinner, early in the evening, but the place filled up fast probably with people stopping bye after work. The restaurant is spread over several rooms on the ground floor and the entrance is a little difficult to find. But once inside, the staff was most welcoming and showed us to our table. We ordered wine from an impressive Wine list, and ordered our food. It included starters for the table, which came with a nice selection of assorted warm bread rolls to be eaten, dipped in olive oil. It started with thinly sliced Parma Ham with rocket salad. I followed it with a tenderloin steak done medium served with red wine sauce in bone marrow and a small portion of creamy potatoes. The stake was perhaps the best I’ve eaten outside the United States.
The others in our group had veil, and the vegetarians were very satisfied with their orders of pasta and of eggplant parmigiana. We skipped the dessert.
The restaurant is quiet and understated. It does not go overboard in trying to creat an ‘atmosphere’. It lets its food speak for itself. And it speaks great."
One of my Favs,Food was great. Service excellent. Staff very friendly and attentive. Nice ambience. One of my favourite restaurants in Singapore
Excellent food n service. Highly recommended.,"Organised a farewell lunch for my boss with 9 pax at otto ristorante and ordered the lunch set menu. We were pleasantly surprised by the excellent food and services that were provided. The food was delicious, high quality and fresh. Kudos to Paolo and his team. Would defintely go back again."
Birthday Dinner,"My husband enjoyed his birthday dinner at Otto! Everything was amazing, from the food, service and atmosphere. Definitely going back again!"
Delicious pasta,"We spent our final night in Singapore at Otto, having been recommended by friends. It was delicious, immaculate service and very enjoyable."
"Noisy, overpriced, mediocre food and slow service","Dining here was like eating in a college cafeteria- not fine dining. The noise level was intolerable, the service was extremely slow. The green salad unexceptional and the mains ordinary."
Nice Christmas Lunch,"Good food, great service and hospitality. Always having good time there. Recommend for business lunch and date."
Good food and service. Lunch deal worth it. Central locarion,Good food and service. Lunch deal is well worth it. Central location. Good choices for set lunch. Recommended
Great experience,Quality food and service. Otto never fails to impress with its seasonal offerings like truffles as well as well-prepared and well-presented meats and pasta. Overall it’s a pricey affair but you get what you pay for.
Excellent food and service,"I enjoyed the fish carpaccio and the grilled vegetable salad very much.
The carpaccio has a nice tangy flavor, was well prepared with thinly sliced and fresh fish.
The grilled vegetables and rocket salad was beautifully seasoned and one serving was enough for 2.
The truffle dish was a tad expensive and didn’t impress.
I was very pleased with the affogatto finale."
Excellent,"I rarely go for Italian when abroad, but Otto is absolutely worth, with an amazing quality of food, great choice of wines, excellent service, and perfect atmosphere; last time the bacalá (cod) mantecato, and the white truffle tagliolini were superb."
Best Italian restaurant in Singapore,"Otto is often the “go-to” restaurant for my office occasions as it’s my Italian boss’s favourite restaurant. We have been there many times and never once have they failed at delivering their best. The lobster pasta is good and the staff are really pleasant. According to my Italian boss, Otto is the best and most authentic Italian restaurant he has ever tried in Singapore."
Wonderful business dinner restaurant,"Had a business dinner here. A closed room for about 20 people. The atmosphere is good, the service is good, the dishes taste good. Very good."
Still the best Italian restaurant,Otto revisited is still the top best Italian restaurant in Singapore rivaling those in Italy. It’s chef produces signature dishes that are beyond compare and elevate the cuisine to a culinary art. It’s sommelier and Maître D’ complements each dish with exquisite wine that enhances the taste of the food rather than overpower it. And this too is an art form when Maître D’ and chef coalesce. This is a restaurant worth frequenting for lunch and/or dinner. It’s simply deserving of 3 stars. Nothing says Italian fare better than Otto through its quintessential chef. A passion for his art that’s not been diminished but has grown into an art form of its own. For Italian restaurants in Singapore there is no other.
"Condescending service, based on your dressing","Service & food undeserving of reputation. Lady manager(?) was unkind to elderly parents cos of how they dressed. (My father was in bermudas for lunch.) Restaurants can uphold their dress code, but not be condescending or impolite."
Excellent,"Recommended by friends to try this spot and were not disappointed. They have an extensive wine list and are happy to provide tastings so you can choose the best bottle. We all enjoyed starters, mains and some of our party had dessert as well. Each dish was something unique and tasty. Watching the truffle being weighed and grated onto my friends dish was fun too. Were made very welcome despite our last minute booking on a busy Saturday night. Overall a great fine dining experience."
Italian fine dining at its best,"Real Italian cuisine, though, alas, with Singapore prices... But well worth the investment. I have been traveling and craved for Italian food after an abstinence of more than a month, so decided to come here. Went for the gourmet menu at SGD 138, see photo, and every single course was perfect. My favourite was the suckling pig, crispy skin and juicy meat. Halibut also excellent. Oh and the foie gras!

Excellent wine list, again Singapore prices. Wine by the glass comes in 150cl servings (5 per bottle). I prefer the 175-180cl (4 per bottle) somehow I am always out of wine by the end of a pairing... I appreciated a complimentary moscato (which did not quite go with the chocolate dessert though) and grappa at the end.

The manager is firmly in charge, gives good advice and is very forthcoming, and his staff is efficient and friendly.

With two glasses of wine (Amarone SGD 32 and Gavi cortese 21) SC and tax total was 286, including 44SGD for a Trinidad cigar. There is a cigar terrace for smokers where I relaxed at the end of my hard work at the table!

Italian fine dining at its best. Otto, the lucky number in China (most prices end in 8) and because the restaurant opened in 2008... Good luck!"
Pretty good,"The restaurant is prominently located and signposted at one end of Maxwell Rd, but it may be a bit convoluted to get to by car if you're not familiar with the one-way streets there. You can park at Guoco Tower which is across the street from Otto, but we parked at the nearby URA open-air carpark. Booked a private room for a 12pax - birthday celebration dinner. We ordered quite a variety of food, and everyone pretty much enjoyed everything, which says much of the restaurant's fare. I particularly liked the burratini. Several others had urchin-pasta, steak, tortellini... like I said, all of it was good. We didnt have room for dessert (aside from the bday cake which we brought). One guest didnt like her decaf coffee, but that was the only negative comment about the food that evening. The service was quite professional and prompt. All in all, very enjoyable and an easy recommendation. Expect to spend about S$150 per pax for a full-course dinner (unless you go crazy with the wine selection)."
We were greeted by a delightful gentleman and sat outside for drinks till the entire party arrived,"The Staff were so professional and pleasant and the surroundings were stylish with wonderful ambiance. Not noisy and the tables were not pushed up against each other.
The food was utterly sensational. Every dish I tasted was absolutely delicious. I did taste some of at least 3 other peoples food. The smoked Lobster was amazing I would recommend this highly. My Dover Sole was cooked to perfection. The Foie Gras I tasted was wonderful too. I would have loved to try dessert but I had a plane to catch so i will have to do dessert next time"
"Friday Nite Out for good food, attentive service & total unwind","OTTO-licious! As many workers in the CBD head for home or other bars in the area, OTTO turned out to be quite an oasis of comfort food, quiet environment and attentive yet unobtrusive service. Come to this CBD nook in a corner for understated opulence & Outta your mind dinner & desserts experience."
Food and service one of the best!,The mushroom rissotto is a must have. Warm chocolate cake was ok too. Service staff are very responsive and not intrusive. Ambience was great as well.
Stylish all the way,"This restaurant oozes pure style. From the decor to the layout to the menu to just about everything, it's just absolute style. The food is fantastic and the service is quite good. It's great also if you are a vegetarian to go here since the options are wonderful."
Great Italian restaurant,"A restaurant with a very nice interior. Also some tables outside. There were 3 menus to choose from, we had the vegetarian menu which was exquisite. A la carte choices available too. Great choices of wine at reasonable prices. Overall a great experience!"
Amazing Quality of food.,The food has the original flavor. The seasonal food is great. I had a black truffle pasta and it was delicious.
Ms,"Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to lodge a formal complaint against the polite attitude and service manner of your receptionist - Ms Molly on 15 July 2019 at 13:30.

I have a regular visit of your restaurant as such high standard brand although your receptionist was never that friendly. Your
Staff pointed out that it was my fault not to inform the restaurant in early notice for cancellation. Unfortunately, I just received the latest update from airline and airport that it would be a flight delay. Your receptionist is so sarcastic to ""ask"" me to inform the restaurant in advance and I also wish to know the delay in advance if I was a pilot or airline. I humbly apologised that I didn't expect a culinary service provider would give me a lesson for any reservation and cancellation.

Such non professional way complaint to customer that was my first time to experience from Michelin restaurant. I requested to talk with you however she stopped me not to with you. I would go to all kinda of webpages and blogs to announce such improper manner and response to customers.

I trust that u should provide a proper service to the heart training to your receptionist to improve the standard service level.

Thank you
Lee"
