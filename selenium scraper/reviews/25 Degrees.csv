The Place For Delicious Burgers and Fries,"We were staying the in the hotel above this restaurant and the staff recommended it for a good meal. We ended up eating here twice. We ordered the Full Caesar Salad, the 25 Degree Salad, Hueber One Burger, French Fries and a Milk Shake. The salads were fresh and lettuce crispy with just the right amount of dressing. The burger cooked to perfection and delicious. The fries hot and crispy, and not over salted. The milkshake over the top decadence. The place to go if you want a delicious burger."

For Good Burgers in Town,"We always enjoy the burgers, onion rings, hotdogs. Food is delicious, you can also craft your own burger! Service is good and prices are reasonable too."
Delicious food and good service!,We had a very pleasant first experience here that won‚Äôt be our last! The food was delicious and the sides (curly fries and onion rings) in particular really wowed - huge portions and so tasty! The service from all the staff was great and they very kindly allowed me to switch my burger sauce for another. Special mention goes to Shankri who gave us a heads up to wait a few minutes until after Happy Hour (7pm) before ordering to make sure we would have no problems using our Kris+ voucher :)
"Good food, good service, good price!","Came here a few times and always enjoyed ourselves. Decided to leave a review as I really wanted to share the joy of dining here! Came today and have had a wonderful time as always and even more thanks to the service provided by Shankri, Dinesh and Ragini.

Lunch review,"I love burgers. Love that 25Degrees offers a set lunch option which is a little smaller than a full-size burger. Works for my lunch eating habits! Service staff are always friendly and helpful. I forgot to hit the confirmation of my order on the web app and the staff came around to check if I had problems. That is attention and thoughtfulness! Thumbs up to Ragini, cheerful attitude!"
Awesome burger,The burgers and bun was amazing! Costumer service by Shanku was great! She was extremely friendly and attended to all our needs. Great ambience and solid food
Shankri is a delight,"We were with out 2 young children. Each of us in the depths of late day jet lag from a 15 hour time zone difference. We had difficulty using the App and Shankri was patient and kind. Our kids were past tired and definitely were not acting their proper best. She was patient, kind and compassionate. Great flavor and portions of food."
Great brugers,My partner and I are from NYC visiting Singapore. We loved the food here. The impossible burger was so good we came back for another try before leaving Singapore. The staff was also very friendly!

Ready to serve customer returned burger to another customer,"Ordered a burger and explicitly requested no cheese. I immediately returned it as soon as soon I discovered they‚Äôd messed up. As I approached the counter I could see the chef deconstructing it to serve to somebody else. I had picked up the burger, almost taken a bite. For sure my germs were all over it. I complained. Paid my bill and walked off. I sinply don‚Äôt trust their hygiene practices. And neither should you."
Celebrating for friend birthday party.,Appreciate for the foods and great services. Reasonable price too. Especially the staff both GINA & ARIF are really great. I‚Äôll visit again soon‚Ä¶.
One of my favorite burgers in Singapore,"It was one of the best burger in town‚Ä¶ the burger bread is soft and flavorful‚Ä¶ I recommend Number One burger which I had previously‚Ä¶ This time I ordered Number Three burger, which was hot and spicy for me‚Ä¶ Next time i will stick to Number One‚Ä¶ The server (Gina) is very nice‚Ä¶"
Decent burgers,"Good service from staff. Although wrong cheese was put on one burger it was still very good as was the other we had, side dishes we had were also good, also decent size. Prices very reasonable for Singapore. Would visit again."

"Friendly server, amazing burgers üôåüèº","Visited with my wife during our honeymoon. Quickly seated and drinks order taken. Gina, our server, was helpful and upbeat. Knew she was smiling behind the mask throughout. I ordered the #1 burger (blue cheese, prosciutto, lots more sexy stuff). I thought it would collapse but it was, basically perfect. My wife had the delicious and spicy rendang burger. Gina warned us about the spice but it was just right. Tasty martini cocktail plus tater tot nachos and wings. Ordered too much, but I'll order even more next time. Thank you and please open in the UK!"
Appalling Service Attitude BUT GREAT BURGERS,"Great burgers BUT apathetic appalling service

Totally disinterested lady serving us. Even to get a glass of water and subsequent refills appeared to be a herculean task

No greeting a customer , totally do not care attitude .

Maybe the lack of finding good service staff is coming to haunt our country

Having said this , the burgers were great and very tasty"

Best burger hands down,"the place where they ask u how do u want ir burger...well done, medium etc because they have real patties these lovelies Shankri and Tiffany are so great, they provide u with lil things that make ur visit extra wonderful! I live 600m away so I surely will be back"

A great place and good food for friends to catch up,"Second visit after our workout. The food was just superb. We had number 1 burger plus 4 sides and cocktails that completed the meal. Not forgetting, our servers, Shankri and Dinesh who were super friendly and patient. Will definitely come back for another meal."
dinner!,we accidentally entered the wrong way and werent given a table from a server but they let us stay anyways! and they were so kind to us if i were in their shoes i wouldve been pissed at guests who entered without me letting them in + our waitress shankrt was very patient with my mom and i when we kept asking never ending questions about the menu

Incredible Service with Incredible Food,"Came here for lunch after hearing recommendations from friends and it is indeed a wonderful restaurant to come to.

I was served by Raj and Gina who showed exemplary service, being very friendly and serving with a smile. They were also very prompt and observant, offering to refill our water when our glasses are empty.

Their burgers was also mouth watering and definitely one of the best I had before. Buns were nicely toasted and the burger so juicy and had a good hint of smokiness. Moreover, we used Chope voucher which made the meal even cheaper than it already reasonable price.

Would definitely come again!"
Lunch time meal,Good service by Raj and Gina. Used the chope voucher 1 for 1 Signature Burger. Was very value for money. Will come back soon.

Great place great burgers,"Totally enjoyed their burger, Ordered a Number 4 with upsize and a cookie and cream milkshake! Come in the afternoon when crowd is minimal üòÅ Raj and Gina were extremely accommodating and let us pick where we wanted to seat. our needs were all met!"
"Decent food, but service was not up to par. Long waiting times to enter restaurant, long waiting time for food.","Breakfast service was extremely slow. Quite obviously they are severely understaffed. Perhaps due to Covid-19 but I and a few guests after me had to wait between 5 to 10 mins outside the restaurant for the staff to bring us into the parking restaurant. After ordering, we had to wait for almost 10 mins before the food is served. No water or coffee was served. I really hope the restaurant can look into this."
Review,"Food was good, excellent service from Raj and Dinesh as well! The sides were excellent as well‚Ä¶ will come back again!"

Great burgers and lovely service,Service was excellent from Dinesh and Rajesh. Burgers were delicious. Especially the truffle fries. My husband and I enjoyed our experience. Thank you.
Great burgers! Even better service!!,"Its our 14th time back at 25 degrees.
Food was amazing as always.
The buttery brioche bun was soft and fluffy. It was my first time having the number 4. My usual is number 1.
The patty was very compressed and you can definitely bite into the fibres of the fish patties and taste the sea without the stinky fishy-ness of it..
It was a rather hearty burger but yet light enough to not feel surfeited from.

The slightly spicy, siracha mayo-like sauce was refreshing and did alot of heavy lifting.
I think this burger was definitely well thought out.

Onions rings was also done to perfection.
Real onions, not frozen packed nonsense..
The batter just kept us munching and munching..

Our dining experience was made exceptionally pleasant by Rajesh,
he was very attentive and friendly, he was very prompt in his service and definitely showed alot on initiative on the service floor, simple small actions like checking in on how the food was, and asking if we needed any sauces, etc.
We always look forward to meeting him whenever we visit 25 degrees."
