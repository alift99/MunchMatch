Raffles would like this!!!,"The service is good and the menu is extensive. It has a bar bistro feel and a relaxed atmosphere, the quality of the food was very good albeit a little overpriced but I would recommend this place and go again."
The Botanic,"Not recommended unless:
1) Unless you don't mind paying overprice for dishes
2) Unless you don't mind a bistro service style but price as expensive as semi-gastronomic restaurants

We went there, obviously being a couple. The candle on the table was off, and throughout the meal it wasn't lit. At the price we pay, I think the service should follow
The food taste is nice (that's why a three star), but the portions are way too small. Actually just look at the plates, these are not main dishes plate, but starter sizes.

A Mojito cost 18SGD plus tax and service charge.

Won't be back"
Valentine Day,Excellent food and staff services. Service staffs are friendly.A nice complimentary valentine churro too.
Name change but still Great Food,Recently changing names to The Botanic this restaurant is still providing a great relaxed atmosphere and fantastic food with many share plates available. The revamp is great and the new menu also provides some great new choices. Great place to meet friends in a casual environment and share some wonderful food at the same time. This has been a long time favorite place and will continue to be so.
Now replaced with the Botanic at the Raffles CIty location,"The Salt Tapas Bar in Raffles City has now been replaced with The Botanic. I came for lunch recently with a friend and we both opted for the lunch set at $24++, which includes a main, side and a coffee. Food quality was good but just a little on the small side. The coffee was very good."
Here for cocktails,Not bad place to watch world go by until raffles finishes refirb. A few gin slings to start the eveningüòÅüòÅüòéüòé food not bad either.
Great place of an evening,"Had the best croquettes and honey ribs here. I ate here several times as super close to the Swissotel, good air con and great for people watching. Happy hour too hits the spot. Staff are super attentive too"
A place of buzzing activity,A good place to visit in the evenings. Noisy but enjoyable ambience. Tamil speaking staff are very friendly.
in the mood for tapas!,"It was time for dinner and my friend was not too hungry so the idea of tapas appealed to her. We were seated immediately and water arrived to the table. We looked over the menu-it is a fairly large space with pleasing decor. We decided to order from the cheese platter menu-each cheese was $9/each, 3/$25, 4/$32. My friend ordered 2 choices and I ordered 3 choices of cheese. Each platter came with slices or sourdough bread, some pear slices, quince, a teaspoon of truffle honey and crackers. My friend ordered the manchego and one other, I got the manchego,[sheep's milk] the meredith valley [goat's milk] and the morbier [cow's milk] It was a delicious meal, reasonably priced and I would return."
A welcome cocktail,"We were hoping to visit Raffles Hotel but they are renovating it and just had a pop up bar that you could use. We were hoping to enjoy a Singapore Sling but there were too many people so instead we popped across the road to this bar/restaurant. They served a brilliant Singapore Sling at a very reasonable price, we sat outside in a covered area and people watched. Very enjoyable, we didn't eat so can not comment on the food."
Great Lunch Special,Had amazing pork belly & kale salad. Perfectly portioned. Coffee was also great. Definitely will be going back for business meetings.
Unsatisfactory,Reservation is very simple and straightforward via chope. The servers are friendly but food is very salty and portion is very very small (both main and sides). Will not plan for my next visit.
Good service; average food,"Attentive and friendly service. Food wasn't great, though. Hummus was completely bland. Mushroom croquettes were decent, but very heavy. Wine selection was better than their neighbors'."
Sharing Food is not for sharing.,"the restaurant is okay, food is not amazing but still good tapas food.
we order a few sharing foods but most of sharing food is hard to share.
food potion is small.. halloumi was tiny like hard to share.. and more tomatoes than halloumi.
other sharing food also same.
paying for a sharing food to share but can't share, better order few Appetizer to share is better.
and restaurant closed 10 PM so better go early leave early."
Great Service and Food,Our third time visiting and we are once again impressed by the service and food! Never a bad experience and we are definitely coming back for more!
Love the food and ambience,"Wide selection of food for sharing, with specials also. Happy hours are priced at $7 for liquor such as whisky and gin, and $14 for their specialty cocktails."
A nice evening with friends,"A nice atmosphere, with good food and a big menu on fish, meat, vegetables and drinks, from beer to wine. I ate octopus with paella and had some meat with fried potatoes from my friends. I would return!"
"Seriously inventive tapas (& mains) in an unassuming, chill atmosphere","Great discovery with hubby last week at Salt Tapas & Bar! The place is unpretentious and relaxed, but the tapas and main courses are definitely something special. We sampled the burrata with smoked tomato jam on sourdough, the fresh 'oysters 3 ways' and the surprising, delicious salmon sashimi, served ginger shallot dressing and feta. Besides tapas, they offer 'sharing mains' of all sorts - we had a yummy 'barramundi' crab' dish with very interesting trimmings, and then a to-die-for wagyu cut served with smoked marrow. The dessert (liquourice parfait) was perhaps a little too adventurous, especially as we were trying to pair with wine, but we spotted a yummy salted molten chocolate cake with raspberry that we will definitely be ordering next time. Several Team Members - from friendly manager Karl to Charmaine, who assisted us with wine selection - were customer-service oriented and helpful. Apparently they also do some special brunches which sounded appealing... We'll be back!"
lots of fun,"nice place to come for drinks and tapas, outdoor area is bets, very relaxing and service was great too will come again"
O.M.G.,Sorry I‚Äôm going to use all the superlatives up. In my top 5 meals. Superb staff. When you say ‚Äúgluten free‚Äù - THEY GET IT !!!! Please management pass on to Chandra our thanks. An excellent waiter. With great knowledge. Highly highly recommend
Nice for afterword drinks and tapas,"They have deal for 5 tapas SD$50. The food was good, service was quick and staff were friendly. I recommend the truffle fries and tacos."
Great Spanish food,"Great Spanish food here, the set lunches have the option of wine. Had the pulled pork burger with fries, but there were other options for mains as well - lamb chops and salmon steak."
Delicious Miso Pork Ribs,"We dropped in here spontaneously and weren't dissatisfied, the pork miso ribs and wasabi coleslaw were incredible. Great atmosphere, hard working staff all willing to please."
Interesting and OK,"Went for dinner after browsing around for a restaurant, menu is quite small, food was good, had some oysters and a few other small dishes we shared.Not a place to fill up on for sure."
Nice Experience,We came across this restaurant courtesy of Tripadvisor as we were looking for somewhere near our hotel. We had an enjoyable meal of tapas and cocktails in a nice relaxed atmosphere and the service was friendly and efficient.
Great meal . Awesome cocktail and excellent service,Visited this place on last minute decision and we sat at an outside table. The staff were helpful and the food was excellent also not that expensive ... very enjoyable experience..
Good quality food & good service,"Went in for a bite to eat prior to heading off to the airport, staff were very efficient & sorted out a table for us with ease. Food choice was great for vegetarians & the chef didn‚Äôt disappoint with great tasting food - really impressed with the overall visit, would recommend it if in the city."
Slow service lets down good food!,"Business trip, quick beer and light meal ended up being a saga. Sat down no service for 15 minutes finally offered to order food. Took another 20 minutes to get the change from a cash payment and had to ask after 20 minutes for that to happen. Mr Mangen check on your restaurant service levels as this one is slipping!"
"Attractive restaurant, great food","My wife and I enjoyed the beef cheek burgers from the lunch menu. Nice buns and I had the bonus of her unwanted beetroot to add to mine burger. the fries were nice cooked and tasted breat. A couple of beers and glasses of the house red made for an enjoyable time. Given the chance, we would return. Well done Luke. Good luck with this venture."
Great late night dinner,"Had the 5 tapas for $50 deal. Wagu sliders and fish taco in particular were super delicious. Deconstructed pavlova a nice ""tapas"" to finish with. Staff were friendly and professional and offered a complimentary glass of wine after a minor miscommunication regarding my orders."
ordinary food and service,"Arrived around 5pm to have an early dinner with family, so it was pretty quiet and remained that way. Service was slow (taking orders, clearing plates etc).
No friendly smiles, Wait staff seemed like it was too much trouble and we were an inconvenience. It took ages to get a drink and then all 5 came at different times. The tonic in my vodka tonic was flat and when I told the waiter he rolled his eyes, took it to the bar and came back with a carafe of tonic, not saying a word.
We tried several dishes. Calamari was good and salmon sashimi was great. The paella was overcooked as was the dry tuna dish. The other dishes we tried were pretty average. Desserts were also average, the churros were just churros, the pavlova just mainly cream and little else. The licorice parfait was the best of the lot.
We sat with dirty plates and empty glasses for a long time and when we finally got the attention of the waiter to ask for the bill, they still left everything on the table....even after we'd paid.
At SGD$370 for 3 adults and 2 children, it was an incredibly underwhelming and disappointing evening.
It appeared a celebrity chef trading on his name, with ordinary food and NO customer service."
Dinner and glass of wine,"The food here was absolutely delicious. However, leaving there last night, a staff member accidentally poured a second wine for me....I was appalled to observe him returning this glass of wine, having poured it into my used glass back into the bottle to reuse"
Brilliant meal,"On our recent stay in Singapore, we were advised to seek out this tapas Bar. We were so glad we did, the food was amazing, the tastes were unique. We had the 5 tapas plates for $50 to share, thinking it may not be enough, but were pleasantly surprised, the size of the plates were generous serves. The staff were attentive and friendly, especially Zul, who made our evening special. We would recommend Salt to anybody, you will enjoy the experience."
Birthday Lunch,"Great place, superb Singapore slings, well priced, top service, relaxing atmosphere, went back another day for an encore"
Great location and surprisingly tasty fare!,Was shopping nearby in a local shopping centre and didn't want to eat fast food so came across this gastro pub which was right beside the shopping centre and which had outdoor seating. Ordered some sliders and pork ribs and both were delicious!
Totally scrumptious,"Three of us -- including one ravenous big eater -- totally pigged out last week. Every dish we had was either really good or totally great. The really good first: charred cauliflower, roasted prawns, jamon iberico, and paella. The totally great: croquettas, pork belly tacos, wagyu sliders, pork ribs and the oreccheitte. Way too much food but the excellent sangria helped it all go down. Make sure you're hungry. You'll want to sample it all. The bill came to SGD 90 per person but would have been way less had we eaten like civilized people."
Great valentines day dinner for the second time here!,Loved the food options for the restaurant's valentines menu. The in-house sangria still does not fail to disappoint as well!
good value set,Have not been for a while. Really enjoyed the food. The set lunch was very good and place is not noisy. So good for business meeting. Staff is attentive.
Great Food and ambience!,Great Food and Great ambience. Great for after office hours gathering and also family gatherings! Would bring my family next time!
Excellent,"Amazing food, great service. Some of the items of the menu are new, but as usual the qulaity is excellent."
Good,Great food. Just pricy and they didn‚Äôt have the more worthwhile large sets for sharing. So just beware the expensive starters
Good price for good food,We enjoyed the athmosphere in this restaurant. People were nice and food was good. We took the 5 tapas for 50 sgd (with GST). So price was quite ok after all.
Great location and staff but just OK food tonight,"Great location, helpful staff.

Ran out of oysters and salt and pepper squid before 7:30pm dinner on a Sunday.

Roasted prawns with chorizo was nice. Prawns could have been a bit firmer.

Grilled baby octopus was just right and the taste of the octopus wasn't drowned out. Potatoes were nice.

The main meal was the pork ribs, miso & honey soy glazed with apple & wasabi slaw. Sounds delicious. The pork was cooked just right and was tender. Unfortunately the miso nor the honey shone through but was was overpowered by oil which made the taste bland and stayed in the mouth even after cleansing a few times with a drink.

I've eaten here before and usually very tasty but tonight was too oily and bland."
A cool place to chill out in the evening,It's a central place to meet friends and have a quick drink and bite after work before heading home. The tapas are tasty and not too heavy to spoil your dinner.
Best Singapore Sling !,"Cannot visit Singapore without having the signature beverage. This is the place to go to have the ultimate ‚ÄúSling‚Äù. Raffles is closed for remodeling, but across the street as you look at the Raffles Hotel you will sip the best ‚ÄúSling‚Äù around. Carefully made with a mixture fresh from the individual bottles (Raffles when open uses a premix). Delicious in the perfect atmosphere! Thr mixer Raj) and the server (Chandra) treat you like royalty.
Do not pass this up, and the price is better than most,"
"Once bitten, will come again!","Atmosphere: Came here on a rainy day. But the environment was relaxing amidst the hustle and bustle of Raffles City/ CBD environment.

Service: The staff members made you feel right and were attentive to your eating and drinking habits.

Food: Try the tapas here. They were having a promo at 5 tapas for S$50. Serving can reasonably be shared by 2 people. The fried squid is worth it as the serving was the largest. The beef burgers were the smallest, holding at 2 mini burgers per tapas. but it was good too nonetheless. End of your tapas with a dessert. I had churros, and it was very good too."
Good value set lunch,Salt Tapas offers a $19++ set lunch with 1 main course and coffee/tea. The barramundi was delicious and is recommended. Ambience was lovely. A nice lunch venue.
Good food but could easily improve,"We are rebounding from a trip to Myanmar, so everything seems fancy and expensive, location is not bad, nice to be outside of the mega malls. The restaurant was not busy, but we had to negotiate to get a table for dinner ( rather than sit at the bar). Our wine choice - I think it was a house Pinot, took ages, and was incorrect.the food came faster thanMacDonalds. We had to slow it down as we were up to 3 of 5 tapas before the wine arrived. Food was pretty good actually ( again viewed after 2 weeks eating same same curry). Expensive given the huge competition and that‚Äôs probably why is wasn‚Äôt full"
afternoon meal,very delicious!!!! though its pricy but if you wanna try some nice exotic food in the middle of the city. this is the place to go! salad and tuna is perfect.
Disgracefull,"Popped in for lunch today.

Although everything looks great on the menu, let me a sure you that it is certainly not that way when it is put on a plate in front of you. I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with the quality of the food. Especially with the taramasalata and spanakopita. The spanakopita did not have any flavour and was panfriend in what smelt like coconut oil. We also ordered a cheeseboard there was not enough biscuits and we were only served with four grapes. Definitely not worth $22 the staff are really really friendly and I happy to provide you with any advice or questions that you may have. I would not recommend this restaurant and will definitely be steering clear of this place.If I were the chef of this establishment I would definitely not be proud at all."
Great food and service,Food was great as usual. Lunch set has great value. Highlight - their Churros. Even the complimentary coffee was good.
Great Tapas at the Raffles City,"Great place to have good tapas and excellent service by Chandra. Outdoor dinning is great with a view of the Raffles Hotel.

My husband and i orderd a Jug Sangria, grilled baby octupus,couliflower, house salad, padron oepper, pork belly taco, truffle salami and coffee (latte)

Excellent quality and fresh food.

Highly recommend ."
Ok enough but not for me,"We tried this place when it just first opened many years ago but we only returned this month as our visiting friends chose it. We were only going to have drinks but we decided to try the tapas.

Now I remember why we haven‚Äôt gone back all these years. Nothing on the menu jumps out as something we‚Äôd like to try. Of the tapas we tried, we didn‚Äôt find any of them as particularly good.

There is nothing wrong with the food. I think it‚Äôs just the style is not for us. (It‚Äôs similar with the other Salt restaurant. Nothing wrong with the food at all - just that it‚Äôs not our type so we struggled to choose from the menu.)

I had a negroni for a drink while we were waiting for our friends. It was pretty weak and had lots of ice so by the time I‚Äôve drank half and the ice started to melt, it was like a negroni-flavoured water.

The staff are professional and friendly so that made up for it.

But we won‚Äôt be back again, not even for drinks because I can‚Äôt go there for negroni."
High Standard - Great Value,"Luke Mangan's Singapore venture is a winner. Having a spectacular street presence and top location is the first standout but is well backed up with great food and fabulous presentation, all you would expect from an international foodsmith. Value for money is exceptional, drink range fantastic and quality of service if first class. This could easily become a Singapore regular when in town..... if you can get in. Highly recommended."
Very good christmas lunch out experience,I have been wanting to try the food there. It was an excellent choice for me and my husband. The food is very good and the price is reasonable.
Good tapas nice atmoshpere,"We had dinner at Xmas eve. Not over crowded as usual. Tapas selection is good. Paella had too much curry, not like Spanish. Flat iron steak was very nice. Friendly service. Excellent!"
A good place to go,"The service is really excellent. Waitresses rare very attentive and the location is very nice. The prices are okay, the only comment that I would make is that the quality of the food could be better for such a good place. The appetizers were not very fresh"
NIce Australian Restaurant,"Nice food, a pity that I went just with my wife, didn't get to try the variety of main courses. don't mind going again.

Please remedy your website, can't choose other options other than ""Very Good"" and ""Excellent"" for Food, Value, Service and Atmosphere. Value and Atmosphere at this restaurant was ""Average""."
A great place for drinking and hanging out,"Went there with a group of friends. A great place for sharing food and drinking and chatting with friends. Will definitely go back again. This place is more suitable for drinking crowds. Happy hours ends at 7pm. After that, their drinks can be quite expensive."
Dinner,Just average. Nothing bad and nothing great. Good choices on menu but felt slightly let down by when the meals arrived. Could have had more meat in the sliders and far too much sauce and other stuff on some of the other choices. As I say not bad but better places to eat for this price nearby.
Tapas,"Took the Tapas menu 5 for 50 $. Could have fed 2, was very good, very large choice including desert...the environment is nice as the service perfect... smile and effectiveness. Good experience at a reasonable price ... especially if there is 2 of you !"
Food pretty decent but too expensive,"My wife and I sat on an outside table which was intimate and I didn't feel overwhelmed by the main road despite its proximity. The atmosphere was pleasant but I was surprised by the lack of diners on a Saturday night; most tables were not occupied.
We went for a set of 5 starter size plates. All were tasty and interesting. We followed up with a flat iron steak which we shared. Whilst quite alright, the steak lacked any special quality and I've had better quality at other restaurants in Singapore.
We tried a bottle of sparkling Aussie chenin blanc which was drinkable but somewhat forgettable. I was also surprised that a malbec I had by the glass lacked punch which I would have expected to cut through the rich food. Maybe the food made the wines taste milder?
All in all a decent meal, but my big gripe is the cost which was far higher than the meal and setting justified. We hardly ate or drank tons yet the bill was almost $300. I would have expected more."
Good ambience,The ambience of the restaurant is cozy with nice interior deco. Cold cuts are great! Chorizo are good too.
Every dish was clever and delicious,"We had six tapas dishes and each one was different, clever and delicious and a dish we would like to eat again."
"Excellent on 1st Visit, Favourite dish not available next night","The 1st vivid we has the flat bread, salmon sashimi and beef steak. All 3 dishes were excellent 5* dishes. Great flavours. Was a little expensive, but worth it.

Loved it so much returned the next night. Flat bread had run out. Ordered another entree, salmon then beef steak and lamb kofta. Waiter returned, beef steak not available !!

Whilst the lamb kofta was excellent, our two alternate dishes were average, especially given it‚Äôs not cheap.

I‚Äôm surprised given the types of dishes that they could run out ! !

Disappionted with second night."
Food was ok - have had better luke mangan in Australia,Had lunch with my husband - shared a couple of plates - food was ok - I believe the food in Luke's restaurant in Australia is better - the service could have been better - but great location looking out on the main shopping strop of Singapore
Baffled by service,"Went with an overseas guest. Left my choices of the tapas to the seemingly experienced service staff who offered. Ended with four plates of bread-based tapas and one sashimi. When he realised the combination could be better, he offered to make up by giving us coffee or desserts on the house. We were filled up by the bread already and declined but since he was so apologetic and kept asking, I decided to get a coffee. When I reached home and checked the bill, I realised the coffee was charged to me. Baffled!"
"Convenient location, ok food","An excellent location for a casual meal, close to major hotels (Fairmont, Raffles etc.) and transport, open and relaxing atmosphere - nothing special about the food, enjoyable but no wow factor"
Nice,"We went there for a quick bite and a drink. The food was nice and service pleasant. Why I marked it down is because after paying the bill we did not get the change and has to ask for it, not nice. I would have left the lot."
Wow food,"Tapas are perfect food for a location like Singapore. There are so many food choices and fusion is the nature of the beast here. With Salt, they have it down, and done very well. As a solo traveller I need a barstool option when I go looking for food. It's no fun sitting on your own at a ""regular table"". I got a seat at the bar near a fellow solo traveller and the food, company and service were top notch. This one is on the must return list for my next time in town."
Saving grace is good location and ambience,"Easily accessible as it is next to one of the main MRT station in Singapore.

Ambience is nice and cosy.

Selection and standard of food is ok. I would say average. Ribs were a tad too tough and dry.

Service can be improved. We asked for recommendations for a vegan friend and the waitress proceeded to introduce the meat selections. We had to repeat a few times befo≈ïe she got it.

Another incident was a waitress losing her temper when we informed her the order was wrong . Most amazing was they insisted that they got it right and we should accept the order as is. Though we finally got the manager to cancel the wrong order in the end it was not a pleasant process. Spoilt our night. Will not come back again."
Excellent service and ambience,"We really enjoyed our impromptu family gathering at Salt Tapas & Bar on Friday night. The ambience was fantastic and service was impeccable. All the staff were friendly and very attentive. We didn't have to wait long for our food and almost everything we tried was fantastic. Our favourite were the beef sliders, the Spanakopita and the cheese platter. Pity we missed the happy hour. Highly recommended and we will definitely be back."
Really excellent,"Found this restaurant by chance and so glad we did. The food was exceptional; sharing plates of Wagu beef, truffled potatoes, and brilliant deserts. With several glasses of wine and sherries it was just over Gbp100 for two."
Good food,"The food here is delicious, so it was rather surprising that the place was so quiet at lunchtime on a Sunday. The only grouse we had was that the servings of the tapas were too large: we wanted to try other tapas, which would have been possible had the servings been smaller, as they often are at other tapas restaurants. So we only ordered two, as recommended by the waiter, and soon found that too much of a good thing can still make one sated."
"Nice vibe, good food!","Salt Tapas & Bar has a good lunch set menu - $19 for a main course, with coffee or tea. The Spanakopita (Greek spinach and feta pie) and baby barramundi fillet are both delicious. We like how they are flexible with offering a range of coffee (cappuccino, latte etc) and teas. We ordered a coffee mousse with salted caramel ice-cream for dessert and that was just lovely!"
"Great food, but really unacceptable service","I am actually a returning customer because I really enjoyed the food the first time round. But the fact that the service was so bad the second time means prob we will never return again.

Firstly we had to try least 5-6 times to get the waiters' attention each time we wanted to either add an order, request for water, or even just to get the bill. And whatever we ordered did not seem to arrive and we had to often make a second request. The one thing I didn't understand was why a waiter seemingly facing us, can consistently not see us trying to get his attention, yet seems enthusiastic to serve the expat customers around us. He basically ignored us and moved straight each time to the expats who were seated around us. In the end we had to avoid him and get the attention of another waiter instead (who was much much better).

It was no better at the end of the dinner. For the bill I literally walked up to counter just so that I could make my payment instead of having to wait at my table, simply because the waiter who arrived at the table simply dropped the bill, and went off, even though I was taking out my wallet ready to pay. Eventually the lady manager indicated to the cashier we were making payment, and he too simply dropped the printout, made no afford whatever with eye contact, nor a word of thanks. Very much disappointed, and mood for the evening ruined by the entire bad experience, I took my card signed and left.

It really is a pity because, I really loved the food and ambience of the place, but I don't see why customers should return if they are not appreciated or even accorded basic courtesy."
Superb food taste,"Excellent choice of starters... we were 6 and kept ordering ! We loved their flat bread, roasted prawns and salmon sashimi !! Crew was good and friendly... we ended up trying 3 different wines and Australian Martini ! Good place to hang out tasty food !"
Decent Tapas Style Dinner,"During my Wife and I's recent honeymoon through Singapore we went out for dinner at the Salt Tapas and Bar. We picked this place as it was conveniently close to our hotel (Naumi Hotel) and from the outside looked really nice.

The restaurant does have a great ambience and is delightfully decorated throughout, although I did feel a little too close to another couple from where we were seated.

The staff and service was OK, it wasn't too slow but I felt they didn't look the happiest. Our food was a mixture of starters and mains, including some chicken, steak, vegetables and breads. The food was all quite good although if I was being really picky the steak I asked for was a little under cooked, which was not a real issue.

Price from what I remember was fairly reasonable. Overall I have been to much more authentic tapas bars, the menu felt small and not very adventurous."
Dinner,Chose to eat here as it was opposite our hotel and it looked really good. The staff were friendly and welcoming and showed us how to order recommending 3 dishes we should definitely try. We had 6 dishes between the 2 of us. The quality and presentation was fab and it was all delicious. We added 1 dish at a time to our order after the initial 3 and this was not a problem. Would definitely recommend
Weekday set lunch,"The set lunch was simple, came with a choice of tea/coffee or soft drink. The ambient was nice. Service was good."
Love this place.,Great service. Ask for Jay if you want a awesome cocktail. Food is sensational. Fantastic atmosphere. Didn't want to leave.
"Good ambience, slow service",It's not their fault that the service can be at times slow due to the huge crowds. Great for hanging out with friends to people-watch in the City Hall area!
Very trendy,"Good wines the tapas are varied, I prefer what we used to get in Spain but still those on offer are worth trying out as something different. Good service and a welcoming atmosphere. Does get busy in the evening/weekends but worth the effort."
great value for lunch set,"At sgd19 for lunch, it is a great find for a weekday lunch gathering. Great food, good drinks and please-to-serve service, it's on my to-visit again list."
Average food & service,"Conveniently located on the ground level of a hotel, office tower and mall, this restaurant is usually packed at meal times. Their tapas and service are however only average, failing to leave an impression nor desire to return."
Terrific Tapas!,"Having just arrived in Singapore early evening we were not overly hungry for dinner. We came across this restaurant a short walk from our hotel and having perused their menu we decided to give it a go. We were not disappointed.
We ordered three dishes. The scallops were fresh and tasty whilst the quail (on special that night) would be the best we had ever tasted. It wasn't overly priced although like the rest of Singapore, alcoholic beverages are mightily dear.
All in all a pleasant experience which is highly recommended."
"Excellent, gluten savvy Tapas in Singapore","I spent an evening with two colleagues at the Salt Tapas bar. We had drinks, appetizers and Tapas. Our waiter was instantly aware of and able to guide me to gluten free options in order to make my meal to my needs. We were outdoors in a relatively comfortable evening and enjoyed the atmosphere, view and food. Very convenient to the Fairmont hotel. A bit spendy, about $350SGD for three persons."
Disturbing Lunch,When we stepped into the restaurant there was a Wine Talk/Workshop in progress. The speaker had to speak loudly as the group was big. This is very disturbing as the rest of us do not wish to listen to his explanations but had no choice. The schedule of workshop should have ended before the first lunch customer stepped into the restaurant.
Too good to miss,"This busy city restaurant faces the famous Raffles Hotel and is included in the Raffles City shopping centre, but with its own street entrance. The taxi rank is just around the corner. Our waiter introduced himself and gave suggestions of dishes he liked or were popular choices. He also advised how many dishes to order. We shared starters and mains, and had plenty of food, all of it delicious. Plenty of choices for wines and beers, and house wines available too. Mains are not ordered until starters have been cleared, and the waiter asked if we were ready to have them begun. A separate wine waiter dealt with those orders attentively. Desserts can also be shared. Check the website for the current menu."
Pretty decent set lunch!,"The $19 set lunch offered by Salt Tapas & Bar is pretty decent. It includes a main course with either a soft drink, coffee or tea. The ambience was nice, as was the service staff."
Excellent Tapas Experience,"Had just arrived at Singapore, staying at the Raffles Hotel. Salt was just across the road. Food was excellent as was the service. Would happily return againfor this casual experience."
Always good at Salt!,"The service, the food, the people....these are always so welcome! The people are friendly but leave you your privacy. The standard of food is consistently great, so Salt, please keep it up!"
Relaxed Aussie atmosphere,"After our visit to Raffles Long Bar, we walked across the road the to Luke Mangans Salt Tapas Bar. Lots of helpful enthusiastic staff, we had the very capable Max.
Plenty to choose from on the delicious Menu. We enjoyed a great evening drinking and eating , we were not rushed to leave .
Very clean ,environment"
Drinks need attention,"We stopped by for an afternoon cocktail and when we saw Japanese Slippers on the list, decided to revisit an old favourite. It tasted like cordial! It should be sweet and sour, clearly no fresh lime juice was used. When asked they said they never use fresh lime juice and it was indeed a cordial..... dont put it on the list if you dont understand what the cocktail is! We were offered a replacement drink and ordered gin and tonic thinking you cant get that wrong in Singapore however we couldnt taste any gin and the tonic was flat! Needless to say we gave up at that point and left! The manager offered to make us another drink on the house but we felt two goes at getting it right was enough! I know it was ""happy hour"" however that should not effect the quality of the drinks!"
Good food and drink,"We had a reservation, cause its a very popular place. Order what they waiter recommended, and we were not disappointing. Both food and drinks."
Relax atmosphere~,It was great to visit the restaurant in the afternoon. The atmosphere was so relax and nice. I will visit here again in the future
Highly recommend,We came for lunch with friends and had the best experience. It was actually my third time and have loved every time I've been. Happy hour is on every afternoon. The food us absolutely delicious and staff are very good.
Gave us the wrong bill twice for the same meal,"The food was decent ...except maybe the cauliflower tapas which was dull...but my my main concern was we were given the wrong bill with extra drinks on it.

It is hard to keep track of orders in a tapas bar so the last thing you need is the bill to be wrong. There were beers and soft drinks we didn't order on our bill.

We sent the bill back and then they gave us a new bill with another set of random drink added.

The lady waitress was nice so we gave it a 2 rating instead of 1 and the manager offered us a free meal if we return which helped a little.

The suckling pig with pear was nice but a bit small for $60."
Spanish meets Asian mix,Nice combination of inside and outside tables on the edge of the Raffles City shopping complex and very close to the entrance of the Fairmont Hotel for those guests wanting to eat outside the hotel without venturing too far. Good tapas even if not terribly authentic. Group of us enjoyed a nice mix of platters washed down with some Cava.
Nice place,Good food and service. Al Fresco seatng in Singapore for lunch not ideal but the interior seating was nice and cool.
