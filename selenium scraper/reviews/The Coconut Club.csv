Not many options,"The ambiance is nice, but they did not have many options for dishes especially vegetarian options. The nasi lemak was great and they did constantly come for refills, however that is all. The other options were bland and nothing great."
The best Nasi Lamek,"We went in there by chance because we got caught to the rain. and boy that was the most tastiest food we have ever eaten. I don't eat meat so even when we were there at the closing time, they were very kind enough to provide me with a vegetarian option. That aubergine dish was excellent !"
Beautiful Nasi Lemak,"Beautiful Nasi Lemak - yes it’s expensive but we throughly enjoyed the food and experience

Salad starter of Wing Bean was extremely tasty and something new for us - tofu and crab was good too …. Great start to the meal

Main - Nasi Lemak , half a roast chicken with all the trimmings !

Very tasty and highly recommend"
Restaurant Looks Good,"I dined at the Coconut Club’s new address on Beach Road for the first time. The place looks good. I sat downstairs at one of the tables by the bar where it’s big enough for 2 plates and 2 drinks. Service was fast and friendly. The nasi lemak rice was fragrant. The sambal and fried chicken could do with being more flavorful. Our meal of 2 plates of nasi lemak, one chendol, one coffee and water was $68."
Lived up to the hype,"I am a big fan of nasi lemak so I finally got to try this new dig at Beach Road. It is definitely more spacious that it’s old venue but you will still find queues so better to make reservations.

What I like about the rice is that it is fluffy and fragrant but not too rich. It’s flavoured just right. The chicken drumstick was done just right crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.

Service was relatively fast and fuss free. It’s pricey for nasi lemak so think of it as premium but it’s worth the price."
Don’t bother,"We were looking forward to trying this restaurant after reading reviews but boy were we disappointed! There is so much hype about this place…. bookings only opens a month ahead of time and they continually tell you they need the table so you are restricted to 90 minute sitting. What absolute rubbish! The night we went there were plenty of tables vacant but for some reason they had a queue at the door! Trying to look more popular that they are ?? Charged for tap water which I find offensive. Then when I went to pay with cash they said we prefer card payment. Nowhere did it say this by the way. I had cash and wanted to use it before leaving Singapore the next day. They were expecting me to change my mind and when I didn’t they proceeded to tell me they would have to go downstairs to get change. No problem I said I am happy to wait!
Now the food was disappointing also. The chicken was dry and not very tasty and small amounts of rice and condiments. Overall so many more tasty and cheaper restaurants in Singapore to spend your time at!"
Hit and miss,Had a business dinner at this venue. Food was plenty and some dishes tasted better than others. I found some sauces to be not so tasty though. The highlight was the roasted chicken which was succulent. The dining chairs are very uncomfortable and gave me pain the whole day after.
Expected More,"We went with high expectations of this restaurant but, unfortunately, it did not live up to them.
We were on the upper floor of the restaurant and it had a nice feel to it.
The servers were friendly and helpful.
However, we found the food average. It was just food served on a plate for sharing with coconut rice and condiments (sambal, peanuts and dried anchovies) to add flavour. Perhaps it was just not to our taste, but we could not avoid thinking that (in the words of Australian MKR, Manu) the food was not cooked with love."
Nothing terrific for the price,"Nice decor and often super busy. The menu is ok, but no sets upstairs in the evening. The food is tasty, accompaniments for food are a bit over the top for some rice. Alcohol is expensive for a restaurant like this and no HH."
"Great food, nice people, cheap prices and free wifi","If you don’t what to spend a million dollars at Cé La Vi but what a nice evening then coconut club should be on your list.

A great place in a busy city. A large group of us went here last week and really enjoyed the food. Fresh meat and fish with recommendations of local cuisine. A coconut theme range of cocktails and a range of cakes too. We celebrate a colleague’s birthday and we had a conver of the restaurant for ourselves. Also free wifi!"
Friendly diner in an interesting part of town,"We came her for the nasi lemak as the CC is well known for it. Unfortunately we were disappointed. It was, sadly, quite bland and really nothing special. What was special though was the very pleasant and helpful staff and the relaxed surroundings."
First Visit To New Location,"Finally managed to dine at the new place at Beach Road. It can get crowded so reservations are useful.

We had the gado gado, otah and tauhu bergedils as starters. Tastewise, they were okay but the gado gado dish was on the small side so we had to order another.

The chicken nasi lemak was good as the chicken was marinated and cooked well. The peanuts and anchovies were fresh and crispy and the chilli was good if a little sweeter than spicy.

The selah fish was also fried well and a hood size. The rice was nice but jot as lemak as expected.

They serve refillable still or sparkling water at $3 a bottle. Meal for three mains came up to $130."
Coco-Coco-Nutty !!!,"Premium Nasi Lemak at its best. What else can I say? Their terung asam manis is really good and their sambal kerang is really soft and delicious.

Finally, the best thing on the menu isn’t even food-related ! It’s their coconut shake. I mean, just on a-notha level ! My God. Similar to their Chendol which is expected. ‍♂️"
Superlative,"First visit after their move to Beach Road. Went twice to Ann Siang Hill and enjoyed their signature nasi lemak so wondered if standards had been maintained in their new premises.
Delightful experience, booked through Seven Rooms for the 1.30pm slot. Had a table for us upstairs, rather a steep climb so hold on to railings but beautifully furnished with cane furniture in tropical setting. Very popular with office crowd and large groups. Went straight for the signature chicken berempah set, wing and thigh tenderly roasted with marinated spices, sambal sweet and not too hot, ikan bilis and peanuts crisp, well-drained, free-range egg a glistening orange, a few slices of cucumber. Well worth the $18.80++for everything done just right.
Ordered the line juice with sour plum and cold lemongrass $5.50 each, a very reasonable $56 for an excellent meal.
Service was prompt and courteous, tables decently set apart, convival ambience.
Only complaint would be the rather dirty restrooms downstairs but that's the fault of inconsiderate users than the staff who can't be cleaning all the time."
An Experience Received,"I wanted to have a meal at this restaurant before it moved from the present location to another. It was timely as it coincided with a meet-up with friends.

The area our table occupied was spacious, in keeping with safe management measures. Scan a QR code on the table for the menu and attract the attention of the wait staff to place the orders. The specialty is the humble local dish, Nasi Lemak. Different sets are offered on the menu, and they all come with a serving of coconut rice, fried egg, anchovies, peanuts, cucumber and a generous helping of sambal. One may order a few starters or sharing portions, if preferred. I like the Gado Gado (tempeh, shredded cabbage, french beans, baby potatoes, quail eggs, peanut sauce). It was tasty and not too spicy.

I wanted an experience and it was an experience I received, so the prices were not an issue. Would I visit the restaurant at its new location? It will have to depend on my lunch or dinner companion(s)."
Okay nasi lemak,"Three of us had dinner at the Coconut Club. We each had nasi lemak but with a different optional extra. So one with fish, one with dry chicken and one with chicken in sauce. Nasi lemak is a popular dish in Singapore and Malaysia and so whilst I enjoyed the NL here (and tasted everyone’s optional extra!) it wasn’t outstanding or memorable in any way which is a shame because I had high expectations - it is a nasi lemak restaurant after all. Everything was just okay - I’d have liked an outstanding sambal or chicken or ikan bilis to feel satisfied. Our waiter was very sweet and helpful and the place itself is very pleasant, clean and relaxed."
Feedback on service and staff,"Hi I was at your restaurant on 9th March for dinner with friends and apparently we start having our dinner around 8.30pm and there was still ample time for us to dine but the staff there was repeatedly telling us they are going to close soon and was giving us the feeling of chasing us and start asking for last order if we had any and we where only start to have our main dish after few minutes come and ask if can serve the dessert which was only 2055hrs and we where still having our main course this really upsets us and we have to rush to finish to have the dessert and as I was noticing it was only our table the staff was picking, just spoil our mood and lastly when we about to settle our bill the staff told us they don't accept card payment only cash due the cashier as already close their counter is this supposed to be the way you should advise us before hand that so if we do not cash at the point of time how you settle my bill ? I'm really unhappy and kindly revert back to me how you can accommodate this feedback.Thank you my email address will be sakirarekha@yahoo.com.sg waiting for you reply."
Great nasi lemak but .........,"The nasi lemak is great.

But as a Singaporean, the price is something I can't get over. I find myself ending my meal with a thought of why the heck I spent over $20 on my nasi lemak and a drink.

Its almost priced to be a tourist trap. There are other amazing options available around the island which would also save you money."
The nasi lemak was quite OK and the portion size was reasonably filling.,Dec2021. I had the [Ayam Goreng Berempah Leg Set] and the [Chendol]. The [Ayam Goreng Berempah Leg Set] was quite good and tasty. The portion size was good and reasonably filling. The [Chendol] was OK tasting (not outstanding) for me. The ambience was good and the serve-staff were very attentive and gave good service. FrancisTLim.
Nasi lemak,"Had always wanted to try this for years and today finally did. I think they moved and now at ann siang. Service at the door was pleasant. Had the nasi lemak of course and the otah starter. Very good food, and service"
Too pricey needs cheaper option,"Had the Nasi Lemak with Leg Set
- The rice is fragrant and the sambal is nice
- The chicken skin was very tasty but the seasoning didn’t penetrate into the meat. So when your are eating the meat without the skin taste a bit bland tbh especially if you order the chicken breast set.

The basic set without chicken is $5 which for me it’s reasonably price considering the quality, ambience and experience you get. But to pay $18.8 just to add on the chicken is not worth it imo. Maybe they should have a cheaper option & give a nice piece of fried chicken wing like most Nasi lemak out there and charge like around $8 … it would make it more accessible and I would return again

Chendol is nice just wish the portion was bigger"
Tasty Nasi Lemak your Peranakan mother-in-law would approve of,"We were on staycation nearby so got the chance to make reservation for an early dinner at The Coconut Club. The decor of the restaurant is simple and laid back with a long counter displaying their ayam goreng berempah (spiced fried chicken) along with other nasi lemak ingredients. Coming from a Peranakan background, we make pretty good nasi lemak at home so we really wanted to find somewhere where the nasi lemak is equally rich and flavourful and hopefully with a new taste for us to enjoy. I ordered the Ayam Goreng Berempah Breast Set while my husband opted for the Homemade Otah Set. Each set comes with a serving of coconut rice, anchovies, peanuts, cucumber, sambal and a fried egg. I was not keen on the fried egg as we normally have nasi lemak with either a triangular slice of omelette, sometimes with hard-boiled egg sambal. The chicken was tasty but since it was a breast portion it was rather dry in the center, but additional sambal helped sort this out. The Otah (Charcoal-grilled fish paste with Kühlbarra Barramundi fish wrapped in banana leaf) was delicious and I will opt for this the next time round. At $16.80 for the chicken set and $14.80 for the otah set, the price is a little steep for this 'kampong style' food but being that it is in classic Ann Siang Road (prime area) and with attention to service and quality, I think that we were prepared to fork out this amount. It was overall an enjoyable meal which was complimented by delicious Coconut Jelly that helped cool the palate ($5.60). We will definitely return with our family members and friends as it is about the best nasi lemak option we currently know of beyond our home kitchens."
Expected more from a Michelin Bib Gourmand,"My wife and I ordered their signature nasi lemak. Rice was nice and fragrant. Sambal was good. Egg, peanuts and ikan bilis was also good. Chicken was well fried on the outside but when we cut into the chicken, we both saw bloody spots in the chicken. This for us indicates that the chicken is not fresh, but could be frozen chicken. The sambal sotong we ordered was rubbery and we had ask them to record. I was expecting more from a Michelin star restaurant. But was quite saddened."
Casual and Friendly Place for Good Food,"Casual place to catch up with friends and friendly service. Most well known for their coconut rice (nasi lemak), with roasted peanuts, fried anchovies, egg, chili sauce accompanied by sambal okra and cuttlefish. Reasonably priced. Spent S$32 per person. Réservation is a must."
Premium offering at super premium prices,"Everything here is more expensive, but it’s delish. The poulet leg is good, not sure it’s worth the premium price, though. The sambal sotong has complex flavours and probably is the best item on the menu. The Sup kambing is said to feed two, but they must be children, for the portion is not generous. We ordered takeaway on National Day; although there was a lot of demand, they were very well organised, and service was impeccable."
Nasi Lemak with amazing French chicken,"Considered one of the most premium nasi lemak outlets in town, their signature French chicken that is used for the dish is worth the price. And paired with their special chilli, simply amazing!"
Seriously pricey,"I must say their nasi lemak is really done very well but the price is probably a bit too exorbitant. I think they also need work on their coordination as one staff told me take my time and not to rush and when i tried to order chendol after my meal, another staff told me kitchen is closed. So sad."
"Good food, great service","A friend made a dinner reservation. My 3rd visit here and twice served by Fifi. He is really warm, friendly and very helpful. Ordered nasi lemak, iga bakar, kuih koswi and their ooohh so lemak and not overly sweet chendol( I can proudly declare that their chendol is my favourite in the whole of SG!!) . The food that we ordered are never disappointing. Loved everything that we had and the service that Fifi gave is extremely commendable! Will definitely be back again... And again.."
Big portion. Almost half chicken.,Considered this as “ high end “ nasi lemak but quality of meat and rice is good. Chicken is almost half. That is a lot! Rice is very fragrant. Chilli at the side is yummy. More “ dry” then the usual “ wetter” versions of sambal. The otah is a good side option.
The nasi lemak is okay if,The nasi lemak is okay if you can’t get to Kuala Lumpur for the real thing. We were seated near the counter and within earshot of a crew member who was rather rude and brusque to her colleagues. She could well be a supervisor judging from her interactions with the rest of the crew. She clearly wasn’t happy working there and had the expression to suit her tone too. Not very enjoyable to dine and have to listen to someone on a power trip.
Over-rated Nasi Lemak,"With much disappointment, the Nasi Lemak is over-rated. The Fried chicken is not well marinated as it rather bland; the sambal is not spicy and lack the real sambal taste. The rice was however, fragrant and well cooked. For such quality, $14.80++ is a ripped off."
Excellent Nasi Lemak! Cendol needs attap chee!,"Had the chicken thigh nasi lemak and the taste was really excellent! The sambal given was good too! Tried also the eggplant and lala, equally excellent choices! The lala can improve further by ensuring no sand bits and most are cooked through as we had quite a few clams that are shut tight, the sauce was really good! The cendol is indeed a perfect and cooling end to the meal, unfortunately despite it's higher price as compared to normal hawker offering, it does not have a single attap chee added to complete an otherwise excellent sweet ending! Hope the management can consider adding attap chee to the cendol!"
Worth waiting,nice food nice environment worth the wait nice colleagues probably can add more variety maintaining good recipe
Great dining experience,"It's our 2nd visit, after COVID-19 phase 2 open.
Place is easy to find, ample street parking nearby.
We reached around 1pm, expecting some queue during the peak hour.

Service is excellent, all the staff is extremely friendly, makes us totally feels welcome.
They keep on apologising for the slight delay in serving, which is not a fault of them really, and totally understandable since it's weekend and peak hours.

We started with kuih platter as appetiser while waiting for the main dished. Assorted and tasty nyonya cake.
For the main dish we had the chicken leg set, sambal sotong (must try!) , sambal kangkong, terung asam manis and kacang panjang (complimentary on the house due to the slightly longer wait than the norm). Too bad the otak otak is sold out, we enjoy it the last time round. Food are great and tasty, chicken leg skin is crispy and meat is moist and tender. The sambal sotong is cooked to perfection, love the sambal gravy, our favourites.

To finish it off, the dessert; a bowl of cendol and coconut jelly.
Cendol is very authentic, rich in coconut milk, gula melaka and the red beans.

Overall, a great dining experience and value for money.
We will be back to try the other remaining items on the menu."
Excellent Customer service,"Two weeks ago, I ordered Nasi Lemak online from #CoconutClub, for my family and parents and waited for 30 minutes, after which, I was told that I needed to wait for another hour or so to pickup my order... Agitated with their service, I cancelled the order and got a full refund.
A few days ago, Abby from #CoconutClub called and apologised politely for the inconvenience and told me that she will give my order for FREE !!
A very good come back by Coconut Club to retain their customers...... Kudos to Abby for handling the customers well....."
Pricey but generous portion,"The nasi lemak was quite pricey. I've had better nasi lemak but the portion was generous, good for 2 to share actually."
Looks good but taste disappointing,"Service non existent. Once they seat you in a corner you are forgotten. Had to wave for the wait staff to take order even though two were standing around counter idling.

When food was served, everything was cold (rice, egg, chicken). Food hygiene questionable as cooked food was not covered and prepared where customers can walk around to see.

For the food taste, only rice was alright with the right amount of coconut flavour. Chicken and chili were too heavily spiced and not quite typical of nasi lemak flavours. Taste more like Indonesian fried chicken with strong tumeric taste and Thai chili with strong lemongrass flavour.

The side dish sambal kangkong was served cold, so was not pleasant to eat.

On the whole, this restaurant is way overrated and pricey. Best to spend your money on any nasi lemak stall in Changi Village, good price and authentic flavours."
Nasi Lemak at its best.....So so Shiok....,"First off, its the crew....the service staff that make this place stand out. There are a plethora of superb dining experiences in Singapore. Nasi Lemak aplenty. And some so good that the experience is truly indescribable. But The Coconut Club is a different breed. I mean, the crew are so amazing. Attentive, friendly and caring. Nothing like it in Singapore. The food...the main reason I went there....was beyond reproach. The nasi....so so tasty....the ikan bilis perfectly cooked, the sambal....oh my....I could eat a tub....and the chicken, I am told by those that consumed the bird was crispy and tasty.....We also ordered the okra and the tempe....I would highly recommend this place anyone...."
"Tasty, Decent Portion but Pricey Nasi Lemak","I won't say this is the best nasi lemak I've had because I definitely had better ones in Singapore that are half the price of what The Coconut Club charges. No doubt their chicken leg portions are great, love the chilli but for the price, I won't necessarily come back again unless I've got a friend in town who wants to try it. They're quite strict on the queue too, so make sure all your friends turn up and queue altogether since they'd only alloe you to enter when everyone turns up."
One of the best nasi lemak in town..,I love to give the 5 stars but there’s something short .. the otak is kind of dry in my view and the assam pedas snapper is average. The chicken leg was good as well as the sambal lala. The rice is quite well cooked and chili sambal taste great.. not too sweet. They gave generous fried anchovies and peanuts too. The chendol is exceptionally good ... service is TOP notch and everyone work here so happily. Small waiting time during peak meal time... will comeback to try the fried fish and spicy squid again.
Good wholesome nasi lemak at a price,"Had lunch here. Came at 2pm and there was a queue. Waited about 15 mins to enter. Ordered the nasi lemak chicken thigh set as the chicken breast set was sold out. Ordered a calamasi with sour plum which was a tad too diluted. The food came after a short while. Plating was quite attractive. The condiments were good, the rice was quite fluffy and the chicken was fried fragrantly. Overall a nice plate of nasi lemak and it was not thirsty later either."
Over Hype and Over Rate For The Price,"Came here for lunch, service was very good and impeccable. I ordered wrongly and the staff was more than happy to sort it out, wanted my egg to be done a certain way and the request was happily accepted. As for sitting arrangements the tables are just too close for comfort, like sitting a hawker centre or food court. Table size are also small if you order extra side dish. Had the Chicken Set , cucumber pieces were fresh, peanuts and ikan bilis were crunchy with the righ texture and not oily or salty. The fried chicken leg was very well balance, moist inside and slightly crispy on the outside the way it should be, which is not easily done. The downside is the rice and sambal. Rice was not aromatic at all like plain rice, sambal had no kick or spiciness."
Best nasi lemak and chendol,The best nasi lemak we have tasted so far. The chicken leg (thigh) set has really well roasted and tender thigh. The chilli was the highlight of any nasi lemak and they give a really generous portion of chilli. Sides like sambal kang kong and otah is great. The meal finish off with the best chendol in town. Perfect.
The Best Nasi Lemak in Singapore so far,"Since moving to Singapore 2 months ago, could not find a good nadi lemak until now. Rice was fluffy with just the right amount of coconut cream. Chicken was fried to perfection and moist. The sambal was great and not too sweet like most places. I truly enjoyed it and will be one of my favourite cafe."
Beat Nasi Lemak in Singapore,"The Nasi Lemak here is expensive but of really high quality. We loved the otah, the crispy chicken wings and the rice was extremely fragrant"
Great experience!,"We went the last Saturday for lunch and it was a great experience. The menu has a good choice of food, service is fast and the Nasi Lemak is absolutely yummy. The vibe of the restaurant is nice and it's a relaxing and casual place to go with friends."
Nasi Lemak 😋,"This apparently gay friendly (judging from the small rainbow flag outside) restaurant serves an excellent nasi lemak with chicken, fried beef, peanuts, dried anchovies and a delicious sambal. A cold drink to go with it and your in for a treat. I even got a free dessert to go! Delicious food for a fair price!"
Everyone in my party got food poisoning after eating there,"The food was delicious and the service was fine. I had no complaints while eating there.. however, something was off - probably the side dishes that were sitting out on the counter - and everyone in my party got severe food poisoning late in the night! It was a horrible experience unfortunately. I hope they can get their food safety standards up, as the food actually tasted quite good."
Delicious food. Super clean,Delicious food. Super clean and chic vibes. I had the Nasi Lemak and Cendol which were both amazing. The service was fast and friendly.
A very popular place!,"This was near to our hotel in a smart part of Chinatown, close to Maxwell Hawker Centre.
The menu is very limited, but excellent. It offers delicious Nasi Lemak with all the usual accompaniments plus a selection of different sambals. Set in a casual dining area, tables for two or more, often sharing a table.
The food was excellent, staff were friendly and helpful and it had a buzzing atmosphere. We would definitely recommend."
Coconut lunch,"I was there for lunch, lucky for me, I didn't have to get in line because I was quite early, Normally, the restaurant was really crowded and people waited for their turn and the line was really long. I saw it when I left the restaurant. I ordered basic set with chicken thigh. Because I had allergy to peanuts so I asked them not to put any peanuts there. Rice was really good with smell creamy of coconut. Chicken thigh was juicy. I liked their fish, it was crunchy and fun. I didn't order any drink just had ice water and I thought it was cool enough for lunch because it was hot outside, I asked for a little spicy sauce and ice water cooled down spicy food . The crazy thing was that people ate with fork and spoon which were kind of hard to use for chicken. I wish it was a knife there. Staff were really friendly."
well here's a funky wee surprise,"rocked up Saturday lunchtime and headed the queue to get in for about ten mins. This place is busy and great atmosphere. Good vibes, good demographic mix and simple menu. Went for the coconut rice 'basic' which is rice, ton of fried spicy chicken - delish!, and some fried anchovy, peanuts and fried egg. very fast service considering how busy the place is. Very inexpensive and great value, couldn't eat another thing all day. Worth queuing up for, one day you won't be able to get into this place so go now while the queues are small! enjoy !"
Overprised hotwings and rice,Way overpriced for what we got. Super boring food and we were still hungry afterwards. Would not recommend
You must try this!,"A ‘must ‘ when you visit Singapore!

The Coconut Club is so popular that people were lining up outside. We were fortunate in that we got a table for two within ten minutes. The ‘basic’ meal was $12.50 - unbelievable value for a huge meal of chicken, rice, fried egg, sambal,roast peanuts and fried shrimp (hope I got those right but whatever it was fabulous food and great value). We did add two serves of vegetables each which were just delicious. Couldn’t fit dessert in though. All in all a fabulous lunch."
Probably the best Nasi Lemak in town.,"We went on Saturday evening and was surprised to get a seat within 5 mins. Our order was taken very promptly; the basic nasi lemak with a couple of side dishes (otah-otah and sambal squid). The order came around 30mins; not that we are complaining, thats pretty the expectations for all the famous restaurants.
The lemak was exceptionally good, fragrance rice, the succulent chicken breast, the sambal with a good balance of peanuts and crispy anchovies. Best to go with a side dish of delicious sambal squid.
The otah-otah is a ‘must try’, a very authentic taste.
Overall, we it very much. Will definitely come again."
Beef Rendang!!!!,"Nasi lemak is good with chicken thigh meat, the sambal for me it is spicy but still manageable, okra is amazingly delicious, beef rendang is a superstar here for me. Beef rendang is so tender and soft and full of flavours. You can't leave this place without ordering one here. The Cendul also good ^^ yummmmmssssss.... try to avoid after 12pm as it gets long queue."
Excellent customer service.,The only nasi lemak to eat if you are willing to dish out 12 bucks for a plate. Excellent customer service. Will definitely return.
Amazing Nasi Lemak,"When a restaurant focuses on one dish only and there are lines at both serving times to get in, you know it's for to be good! Coconut club doesn't disappoint with their star dish being amazing. Succulent chicken coupled with fragrant coconut rice with peanuts, ikan bilis and a lovely and deep sambal make for an amazing dish. There are a number of side dishes which are also lovely, curry chicken, sambal kangkung, ladys fingers help to make a perfect meal. The portions are great and the price just right. If you want to get a seat, come late in the afternoon on weekdays or 15 minutes before the afternoon and evening service starts. Weekends are busy but the wait is worth it!"
Lunch,"Always a queue, even on weekdays. Run by millennials. Efficient service. Open concept. Add ons are generally more expensive than the basic meal itself. Avoid the otah which is an add on."
Comfort food in a comfortable setting,"Heard about this place from a foodie friend. Was told that while their nasi lemak (coconut milk flavored rice) is priced on the higher side, it is delicious.

Came at opening time of 11am but there was already a line. Waited 45 minutes to be seated. We ordered 4 plates of classic nasi lemak @S$12.80 per plate, and a side dish of beef rendang @S$16. The rice is very flagrant, chicken pieces are fried to the right brown and crispy level, sambal chilli + ikan bilis + cucumber slices completes the dish. Beef rendang is also tender and flavourful.

We ended our meal with dessert which is cendol and 3 pieces of nonya kueh. The cendol is really good and is a must try together with their nasi lemak."
last meal in singapore,"we were walking around at lunch time when we came across this beauty
the line up to get in was about 20 people deep so i knew it must be good
i went in and asked about making dinner reservations and was told they do not make reservations later than two days prior ,what a shame.after telling them it wasour last day in singapore and our anniversary as well they made an exception
whe arrived at 6 pm and were seated at a nice cozy table and were given two complimentary glasses of wine to celebrate our anniversary
the waitress came by and after explaing the menu we ordered , now they only do one dish nasi lemak and then you can order sides which were very good
we opted to get one nasi lemak so we could try some other food as well
we had a great fish stew that was unbelieveable as well as some grilled prawns that were equally as good
after dinner we were treated to great local desert (also at no charge )
the entire experience was wonderful andthe staff took real good care of us and for this i am grateful ,you made our last night memorable"
Surprising find,"Was walking around chinatown in Singapore and I cane across the CoConut Club. Fantastic atmosphere, great staff, extremely friendly to a weary traveler. You may need to share table with others, but I didn’t find it an issue."
Yummy,"Saturday brunch with friends from KL. We had the nasi lemak with chicken thigh and shared the otak, sambal kang Kong and paru sambal lado (beef lungs) which was surprisingly good. My KL friends liked it, very close to the traditional nasi lemak they get back home, especially the chilli paste. It gets crowded between 1130-12 noon. Good thing we arrived at 11am."
Nice Ambient with authentic Nasi Lemak,"Restaurant atmosphere is real nice located in good location. Service is beyond expectation,restaurant explained us about their meal including its ingredient. Our fav dish,Nasi Lemak,tastes good. Sure we will be backnext time."
Delicious nasi lemak in a casual relaxed atmosphere,"Wife and i
Came in a little after lunch around 1:30 PM and their was still a queue outside. The specialty nasi lemak was the reason why we came for lunch and it did not disappoint. They also recommended spicy clams which were very fresh and some fish in curry sauce which was excellent! Staff was friendly, approachable and professional. Great lunch!"
A great lunch find - looks like we're not alone!,"What is the worst thing and the first thing to settle when you go to a restaurant or hawker centre in Sin? Where to sit, right? Coconut Vlub has this nailed. Rows of basic yet comfortable seats, and they get diners to line up outside so they can be brought in when seats are available. We cheated the rush by arriving for lunch at 11.45. The food? Who does not know or like nasi lemak in its many varieties? Food comes fresh with hearty portions. Extras included long beams and a lodeh-type gravy with pumpkin. Due to a small ordering hiccup a dish arrived late - the server brought us some kueh FOC to make up for inconvenience altho we expected nothing. A good lunch experience and good to see a happy and passionate staff."
Nice Nasi Lemak,"Their ""The Basic Nasi Lemak"" is a must ordered dish come with Breast or Leg set. The otak-otak is worth to try as you can eat the fish meat inside. Worth to queue for their food. But it is not near to the train station."
Traditional Nasi lemak in upmarket setting,"Delicious coconut rice with chilli, runny egg, fried chicken thigh! Easy on the palate for most tourists and a must try local Malay food. Located in the upmarket Ann Siang hill, prices are four times that of what you’ll get in a hawker but a good choice for tourists to try local food in a comfortable setting."
High end local breakfast,"Sambal makes good nasi lemak. In this case, they have proven right. Expensive if you compare to hawker centre standard. About 25 dollars per person. But worth the family outing together on Sunday."
Not sure why this place is so popular,"We went to Coconut Club last night. There was a long line. We got in line and waited for about 30 minutes to get a table. The service was horrible. It was at least another 20 minutes before a server even talked to us. The woman who seated us seemed shocked that no one had taken our order. She took our order and our food was so-so. We then ordered dessert and waited and waited. We asked about it and the person who took our order never submitted it so they had to take our order again. We were not thrilled by the experience.

The woman who seated us said she was going to give us something to take with us as an apology but it never came and we left after a while and went back to our hotel. I would not recommend this restaurant."
"Wonderful food, great service & friendly atmosphere!","We were seeking authentic Malaysian and landed on Coconut club vía TripAdvisor. The clientele was clearly local & young. The food was out of this world! We needed a bit of help deciphering the menu but both staff and people around us helped and made recommendations. Everyone here was friendly from the waiter, to the girls who made food recommendations, to the woman who handed my husband her water when he coughed, to the man who explained the origin of the deserts & paid for our Grab! It was like joining a community, the beef Rendang still haunts me for its multilayered spicing , the nasi lemak is perfection & the deserts - aah! This place is perfection and I WILL be back."
Great Food,Had a fantastic meal here and the staff were really helpful and friendly. Had the traditional Nasi Lemak followed by Cendol with adzuki beans. Would thoroughly recommend.
"tourist trap, so-so dish, poor service",overpriced tourist trap. the nasi lemak is nothing special. the chicken meat is hardy and looks like not properly cooked. the staffs are unfriendly and seem to rush everybody to order. the cashier play with his phone when we are paying and we have to wait until he's done with his business before he attend to us.
Sparkling Service from Fifi,"The famed Nasi Lemak and Chendol were decent but not exceptional. The best part of my visit to the Coconut Club was surprisingly the 5-star service rendered by one of its servers named Fifi. He was cheerful, chirpy and caring. He would regularly swing by to ensure that we had enough rice, made sure we sample the best desserts and vegetable dishes. Fifi is the best server in SG that I have come across in years in SG."
Best Nasi Lemak in town.,"What a fabulous place! The team was nice enough to make a reservation for me on request as it was my husband’s birthday. We tried their Nasi Lemak, sambal sotong and ladies fingers. All full of flavour, spice and absolutely delicious. Well worth the money and the staff too was great!"
Delicious!,Yumm!! Ordered “the basic” which seems to be the most popular and I can definitely see why. Flavours were amazing and for the price you couldn’t find better food in a sit down restaurant. The staff even brought over an extra chicken curry dish for us to try for free.
"Chicken, chilli, peanuts and crispy ikan bilis are good.","The huge piece of fried chicken (you get to choose between breast/white meat or thigh/dark meat) and large portion of ikan bilis and peanuts plus the ambience helped justify the price you pay for that plate of Nasi Lemak.
The chicken portion is sizeable - probably a quarter chicken in there. It's nicely fried and crispy. Ikan bilis and peanuts are very crispy too and fragrant. The chilli is not very sweet. I should have asked for more.
Probably the disappointment in this dish is the nasi - the rice.
I can't really taste the coconut milk and the overall flavour is somewhat muted. It's a big portion but not flavourful enough for my liking.
Other things which I do not quite like - the background music is somewhat too loud, you may have to share your table with others when space runs out and the expensive Otak Otak, which has chunks of fish meat but overall the taste is blend.
I will not rule out coming back here again though, perhaps to bring overseas guests here.
Service is very good - all the staff are attentive and regularly check that all is ok for you."
Nice place,"The food is good as in most places in Singapore! The location is great, the ambience is very nice, and the prices are so cheap for big portions!"
Good food but long wait,"The Nasi Lemak here is very good. But the service could be improved. We waited 1 hour for the table, which is fine. But they need to better manage their turnover tables. With people queuing for over 1 hour the staff need to help rotate the tables. Their was a Chinese family that had finished and paid but were allowed to stay at the table 25 minutes after they paid. It was not until we came in that they finally vacated. Given the long queues they need to better manage this."
My 1st Nasi Lemak,"This is my 1st visit to The Coconut Club. I have read about it online as one of the TOP 10 for serving the best Nasi Lemak in Singapore. I had Nasi Lemak (chicken breast fillet) as my main & Cendol as my cold dessert. The Nasi Lemak consists of coconut rice, chicken, Ikan Bilis, peanuts, cucumber, fried egg and samba. The Nasi Lemak was well prepared, the fillet was juicy and easily chewable, the flesh was soft. The rice was with a delicate coconut flavour and soft. The Ikan Bilis (Dried Anchovies) was not fishy, it was pleasantly crunchy, the egg was perfectly cooked and with no egg smell and surely not overcooked, the peanuts tasted fresh and well roasted. The balance of flavour was just right. This was my 1st Nasi Lemak and a perfect one. I went ahead with the cooling dessert of Cendol. I love this dessert with Pandan leaves flavour and coconut milk, it was smooth and delightful. My drink was the fragrant lemongrass.

SEE photos."
Authentic and friendly!,Had a great meal with friends and my 2 year old. The staff were amazing with us and my daughter as we waited and ate. Famous for the Nas Lemak and I can understand why! The Beef Randang was also delicious
Good Nasi Lemak and Child Friendly,"I have been to coconut club before not to their new location that is just up the road of their old address. I visited with my husband and 2 year old daughter. We went on a Sunday at 11.20am. They don't take reservations but the wait isn't too long. Whilst you wait, you can help yourself to some refreshments of water, iced tea and wines. This was pretty nice. Once our table was ready we were escorted to our table. They brought a toddler chair for my daughter as they ran out of baby chairs. This was perfect for her. I have never been to restaurant with a toddler specific chair before. We ordered 2 sets of nasi lemak and a child's set. Children get to eat for free. Their set comes with coconut rice, peanuts, ikan bilis, and cucumber which is just nice for kids. The staff were so friendly especially to my daughter. The nasi lemak was good and a good portion too. After lunch we ordered Cendol and Coconut Jelly. Both were a nice refreshing dessert to have after nasi lemak. We will be coming back. Thanks Coconut Club!"
Good Service and Gluten Free Sambal,Very friendly and attentive service. Apparently use Tapioca flour on the chicken and you can request a gluten free sambal. Overall I found it a bit light on flavour but the chicken was certainly moist and I enjoyed the sambal. Expensive compared to hawker stalls but I can’t eat this dish at those and this is not a hawker stall.
Great hospitality!,"I have visited the coconut club at my very first time in Singapore. While exploring the place, I was looking for food options and come across with the place. The staff were very polite and friendly. Served the meal quickly even though the place was crowded. It was indeed a decent meal just like what you see in the picture. The quality, presentation and the taste of the food was excellent. The price is relatively high but I'm sure it is fair vs the good food they serve.

I would definitely go there again :-)"
Super Nasi Lemak,"Went to the Coconut Club for the first time a couple of nights ago. Have been wanting to try this restaurant for months. The food was very good especially the fried chicken. The coconut rice was very tasty and the chillie sambal was excellent! We tried some of the side dishes like sambal sotong, lady’s fingers, sambal la la & the tofu. Everything was good. We had the chendol for dessert and that was good too. The restaurant takes no reservations so be prepared to line up and wait up to 40 minutes. The wait is worth the while."
"food amazing, service so so.","Read so many good reviews about this place and we decided to give it a go.

First off, the Nasi Lemak was delicious !! So worth visiting from anywhere in Singapore to try the dish.

This space specialises in one dish, get there early or expect a wait.

The service was probably the downfall, we waited over 40min for our meals while 2 groups who arrived after us received their dishes.

We ended up canceling our side due to the wait and were happy we did. The portion was perfect for us.

I’d probably get in super early to avoid service issues."
Great restaurant,Suggested by Lonely planet so went there with my family for dinner. Great food and very friendly people. Free meals for the kids! The chicken was great but also likes the crispy fish side dish very much. Will not hesitate to come again
Big portion but boney chicken breast,"We decided to try patronizing coconut club for a colleague's farewell on Friday. Fortunately queue was managed well with thoughtful offer of iced water and lemon tea to combat the blistering noonday sun.

The nasi lemak was impressive in portion, the fragrant rice was free flow - which unfortunately wasn't informed upfront so I only had one additional helping. The chicken is fried up pretty well, but sadly my portion was quite boney with not much meat. I should have taken the chicken thigh instead. Otah was really pricey for the portion.

The cendol was pretty rich with the coconut milk and very welcomed again because of the weather. The green cendol was abit stingy though, and did not feel very satisfying. Just a tad more would have been better.

Overall, average experience."
My go to place for nasi lemak,"I must be slacking. This must be my 4th if not my 5th time back at at The Coconut Club for lunch and I have written a review for it.

Very popular place for lunch in An Siang Hill. The owner is meticulous about his source of coconut and that is clear when you taste the nasi lemak.

Menu is really simple. One main dish of nasi lemak with 2 pcs of chicken (breast or leg aka light or dark), peanuts, fried anchovies, fried egg sunny side up, crunchy cucumber slices and a spoonful of sambal chili. Besides the main dish, there are lots of sides like otah and sotong(squid). The main dish is big and I hardly have space for the sides.

A good plate of nasi lemak must be fragrant with coconut without tasting like you are eating coconut. Nasi lemak at TCC is very good. I love the chicken pieces. So tender and deliciously marinated with ginger and other spices. Every little side items are fine so well. The ikan bilis (fried anchovies) is crispy. The peanuts are just the right size.

Only one thing I’m unhappy about. The side of the plate is too shallow. I kept pushing my food out onto the table. Maybe that’s just me.

Lots of drinks of local flavors to choose from. Homemade calamansi (lime), homemade barley, bandung (rose syrup with evaporated milk) etc.

For dessert try the chendol. It is made with palm sugar and coconut milk. You can have it with it without red beans. Go for the red beans. Today they had a special coconut jelly dessert that is so beautifully done. Looks simple but tasted complex. The jelly is smooth not like agar agar. The coconut meat gave it a nice texture. Small dish big taste (of coconut of course)

Definitely a place to visit but be here around 1130-1145. Past that it will fill up and if you have a party of 6, be ready to wait at least 30 minutes."
Sedap,"As a local, its the first time I tried the food. But I’m willing to pay for the amount as the ambience, quality of food, and servtitude are excellent. Quatity of food is generous and well executed.

Great job on the fine establishment of pushing local cusine to a higher level."
amazing,"Coconut club is probably twice expensive as any other nasi lemak in town, but you got a full flavorful set with a nice environment and friendly staff. Not to miss."
Lunch with colleagues,"Being a local I have tried many of the different kind of Nasi Lemak( Coconut milk rice, served with sambal, fried crispy anchovies, toasted peanuts and cucumber.) and its accompanied dishes .
This by far beats my entire life experience of Nasi Lemak.

The chicken are tender and fresh. The nuts and anchovies are of quality selection. The sambal chilli i cant tell you how much i love it.
The rice is refillable.

Dishes- sambal clams, squids, otak are done to fresh-from-oven experience.

Dessert- go for Chendol ( crushed ice, red beans and coconut milk)
Also local peranankan pastry.

No wonder the Singapore Prime Minister invited the Philippines President to lunch at this restaurant.

Price - between local food court and and mid range restaurants.

Must try. Wont regret!"
Felt Unwell Afterwards,"I won't say the food isn't tasty - the nasi lemak is excellent. But I ate there last night and two hours later felt quite unwell and had a bad stomach.

On a previous occasion I went I ordered the cendol and the santan (coconut) had gone off.

I think Coconut Club needs to raise its game on the food storage/hygiene side."
Nasi Lemak with beer,Heard about this place and wanted to try it. Didn’t disappoint. Where else can you get really good nasi lemak with draught beer. Good stuff.
Great nice lemak with great service!,"My wife and I went here on 17th May 2019. We had only one portion of their Nasi Lemak with extra Sambal Sotong and Otak-Otak. In addition, I had Ice Barley as my drink.

The Nasi Lemak tastes so good, with Ikan Bilis, fried chicken, and fresh veggies. The Otak-Otak, Sambal Sotong and Ice Barley could be improved though.

If the prices were more affordable, I would rate it as 5 stars."
Nice Nasi Lemak cooked with heart,"Though the price is higher than normal nasi lemak, i can see and taste the effort the kitchen team has been putting into this rice dish. The chicken leg (really a chicken leg, with drumstick and thigh, not just a drumstick mentioned as chicken leg) is tender and juicy, just cooked to perfect, not overcooked.
Be fair, the other dishes are not as good as their nasi lemak."
Yum!!!,"They specialized in one plate (nasi lemak) with various side dishes to choose from. While it’s a bit far to walk from either Telok Ayer or Chinatown, it’s quite popular for lunch and you need to expect lining up after 11:30 or so, while it’s worth waiting. Staffs are all friendly and they serve your orders quite fast - they even shared us a few kinds of Malaysian desserts on the plate. This is my must-go place in Singapore."
Mediocre nasi lemak in a nostalgic cosy shophouse cafe,"Overall, the nasi lemak set is filling and tasty. Simply love the sambal okra! Really tasty and flavourful. The fried chicken is tender with some crispy bits but it could have been better if it is seasoned longer with the herbs / spices before frying them. The tender chicken drumstick meat is tasteless with some pinkish bits as compared to other nasi lemak chicken I have eaten elsewhere. If you are thinking of coming here during the weekends, be sure to come early as the wait can be 20 mins or longer, depending on the size of the group. The group is only seated when everyone is present."
Earns its Michelin Star,"The Michelin Guide has started making a point of recognizing the very best examples of 'real' food at reasonable prices. Like Jay Fai in Bangkok, the Coconut Club is a perfect example in Singapore. They have a simple but perfectly prepared Nasi Lemak. All the components are done to perfection (especially the chicken) and the sum of the parts is even better if that is possible. A simple dish that is done with great attention to detail. Get there early as there will be a line."
Get Here Early,"The Coconut Club was on our list to eat at. Serving the best nasi lemak in town was the claim, and we now have the evidence to back it up. We arrived just before opening time for lunch. It was already busy, though not open. Large bags of takeaway containers were being carted away.

When we were seated we noticed there were 10 staff, and not a big restaurant, maybe 10 tables. We ordered nasi lemak and assam pedis (with stingray) and it was great. The nasi lemak consisted of a tender, spicy, and crunchy on the outside/ juicy on the inside, joint of chicken, coconut rice, sambal, small roasted peanuts and crispy-fried tiny fishies.

We found out that they took their supplies seriously when we found they source their coconut from far away and owned the plantation to secure the quality supply.

The staff were going hard and many crates/bags of nasi lemak meals, we think, were heading out the door. Whether they had Uber transport or something similar we don’t know but they were certainly supplying the neighbourhood with lunch, big time.

Service was very attentive and a girl brought over a free sweet looking like a chocolate but it wasn’t. It had a palm sugar and coconut flavour and she said that it was usually served at weddings.
Finished off with cendol, a crushed ice flavoured dessert with coconut milk poured over. And that gorgeous lime/calamansi juice again with the meal."
