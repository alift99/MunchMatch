Good Service!!!,Great services!!! Love the beef. Salmon and mushroom soup abit salty for my taste. Nice ambience for family and friends' gathering. Overall experience A.
Good service but food is just normal,"I went to the restaurant with my son for lunch after reading many positive reviews in Tripadvisor. Ordered mushroom soup, tom yum popcorn chicken, grass fed rib eye, and lamb shank. Waiters were attentive but the food was so so. The rib eye steak was abit chewy and the popcorn chicken was nothing to shout about. Lamb shank was tender but lacking of flavours. We ordered extra sides of sambal Kang Kong and found them too sweet for our liking. Overall, I am giving a 3 star rating in consideration of its service and price."
Dinner,Sham & Diana wz the whole team was very hospitable. They spent time in explaining the menu & give recommendations. I will definitely return & recommend to my friends Food portion was big & yummy.
Surprise discovery,Good food and nice embiance. Have a wonderful family dinner and time. Will go again soon. The Ribeye steak is nice. Generoua serving of nice bread.
Great pool side view and fantastic food!,"Kudos to all the service team (Ayu, Mike, Ravin) and culinary team (Jenrick, Ming). We came as a group of 20 people ordered different types of food. They managed to serve without too long of waiting time and very prompt in taking new food/ drink orders.
The steak is fantastic, great taste and look fabulous."
Dinner,"Had a wonderful dinner at Escape, nice food and ambience. Excellent and attentive service from the staff."
Escape for good food and city view,Ordered ribeye with mushroom sauce. It is as expectation. Herb salad is good too. Enjoying sitting outside alfresco by pool side and Singapore city view.
Steaks are nice,"Steaks are nicely done. Nice ambience, good alfresco dinning experience. Waiters are attentive and helpful. It would be better with some light music"
Escape Restaurant,"Superb service, great ambience, nice food. Ordered ribeye and service staff checked in to ask if the wellness of the steak is good. Dessert so so though"
Celebration & Gathering Dinner at Escape Restaurant,"The service, ambience and food of Escape Restaurants is fantastic!

Especially thumbs up for the service team (Mike & Ravin)lead by Manager Ayu, they are all very attentive to our needs and comfort through our dining experience. We are pampered by them!

Highly recommend for the food & beverage served by the culinary team: Jenrick & Ming. The food is really delicious.

Awesome Team!"
Nice dining environment with good service,"The food are great. Have a happy gathering with 20 friends here. Enjoy the environment and good service from the staff. Special thanks to Ayu, Mike, Ravin,Jenrick, and Ming."
Dinner with team,"Got to give big thanks to Ayu,Mike, Ravin, Jenrick and Ming for the great hospitality that they have given to us. They have made us feel like home and I Will highly recommend anyone who wants a good time to come over for a meal"
Lovely Ambience and a great ESCAPE,"Tucked away in a cozy corner, great place to enjoy food and wine (wings and blue cheese dip is super yummy!) , chill the night away üíï Thanks for great service too!"
"Poor service, did not honour their words","Long story short, we indeed ""Escaped"" from the poor service despite us being the ONLY customers there on a Sat afternoon to nearby Brunches Cafe which was FULL yet were able to, at the last minute, deliver personalised warm and friendly service, great food in a very cosy environment at a much lower price. I guess that's why one was empty and the other was full."
Excellent Service and food,"Went on a rainy Friday for lunch. Service was excellent and the staff paid attention to every detail, from food to getting a colouring kit to entertain my 4 year old daughter.
Bread with dips was lovely.
The pan fried salmon was excellent (loved it !) and the sides were done well too.

Had a lovely experience there!"
Eat their steaks,Flavorful steak. Wonderful service. Very very sedap. Will be back again to sample more from the menu. Service staffs are great too. A shoutout to Syamala.
Lunch,"We stayed in one Farrer hotel and got opportunities to have lunch in Escape restaurant in the same hotel. First of all the ambiance of the restaurant was excellent and hospitality was great especially by Shyamala, we wanted to cut the cake for my daughter birthday and having vegetarian food. Even though it was limited vegetarian options, we were completely full as Shyamala arrranged those perfectly. It was great piece of hospitality and very tasty food all across we came like soup, spaghetti.
Thanks to Escape for good food."
Outstanding Hospitality,"Stayed at One Farrer for a week and the highlight was easily my dining experience at the Escape restaurant.
We celebrated one of our birthday dinners there, and it was nothing short of a magical experience. The team went above and beyond to make sure to exceed our expectations.
Breakfast was simply delightful and we ended up overstaying almost every day, thanks to the stellar hospitality.
Thank you so much Ayu and Shyam for making sure we had the best week ever! You went above and beyond to take care of my family and me!

Dinner review,Nice and quiet place to have dinner at. Food and music is good Service is also good and service staff syam came to check in on us regularly.
Excellent place!!,"Great ambience, great food, great music, excellent service crew!! Definitely got to give this place a visit!!"
Excellent service delicious food,Quiet hidden gem. Scenic pool view. Perfect place to catch the sunset. Excellent service by Saymala and team. Delicious food.
Excellent Service and Delicious Food!,The food was on point and on time despite running on a full occupancy... The service rendered by Ayu and her team was impeccable! Keep up and keep going!
Fulfilling lunch with great ambience and lovely view,Ordered western bento sets with brownies as dessert. portion could be better but its quite fulfiling overall.
great food & service,The food was good and the service was great. All the staff working were very attentive to our needs and attended to us promptly. thankyou!
Breakfast at Escape Restaurant Ine Farrer,"This is a very good breakfast place. Ask for the hot breakfast items, like eggs and other Indian options including the Bento box. You can reserve Bento Box ahead of time. Folks are very friendly especially Symala is excellent in her service."
Waiter was bad but AM was good at service recovery,"Went there seeing that there is 1 for 1 mains if we use the Fuzzie app. When I reached, the waiter informed me it was only for food $28 and below which was not stated anywhere in the app. I was upset as this would have affected my choice of place. The assistant manager Ayuilyana kindly offered a $33 ribeye as one of the items for us.

In the end, we decided to go with the 10% discount with $20 free cocktail per diner as stated in the app. To our dismay, the waiter told us the $20 free cocktail does not include any $20 cocktails and only the wine, beer or non-alcoholic beverages $17 and below. I was very annoyed at this point because again, everything was inaccurate in the app. I had wanted the $20 cocktail and not the more expensive one too. I spoke to Ayuilyana who then honored the $20 cocktail for us since it was stated extremely clear in the app.

The next moment, the waiter came to us and asked us to cancel the reservation on chope because they will be charged by both Chope and Fuzzie because we reserved using Chope and then used the Fuzzie app to claim the discount with drinks. This was already way past my reservation timing and it was very unprofessional of him to do so. Nothing was also said that if I‚Äôm using Fuzzie app, I cannot use any apps to book a reservation.

We ordered Wagyu and lamb rack. Thankfully the food did not disappoint like the service did. Ayuilyana gave us free chicken wings at the end to make up for the poor service earlier which had surprised us. Upon seeing that we were too full to finish, she also offered to pack it as takeaway for us.

Ayuilyana delivered very good customer service and customer recovery. With her excellent attitude, it made up for all the unhappiness the waiter had caused. We will consider to go back and dine next time if we are in the area because of her."
Great food,"Impossible burger was amazing, one of the best I‚Äôve had! Perfectly fried and paired with fried onions and incredibly fluffy buns. The sides were great too - fries were delicious and piping hot, along with a side salad with a Japanese style dressing. All topped off with a complementary shot of Jim Beam. Please do consider making this a permanent item on the menu!"
The food was excellent,I highly reccomend the lamb shank best ive had in sg honestly. The service was great syam was friendly. Free fresh bread so always a plus. For starter would reccomend spam fries. Ill be coming for my third visit soon
Great service as Usual,The service staff goes out of the way to recognise repeat customers. Keep up the great service and hoping to try the new seasons menu!
Good Service & Good Food!!,Came here to celebrate a birthday and the manager really gave her 110% to our dinner service and even provided free tiramisu for the family! A hidden gem!
Birthday Dinner at Escape,"Came here for a birthday dinner and the steak was really good. The truffle fries was adequately seasoned and really tasty.

Would come here again!"
Great experience,"We visited for our son's birthday because he loves steak!
The food was great and service was wonderful.
We were even surprised with a chocolate brownie birthday cake with a candle, very thoughtful... and delicious!!"
Good food with excellent service,"A colleague and I stayed at the One Farrer Hotel for business and as it was raining, decided to dine in this restaurant at the 6th floor of the hotel. We had calamari ring starters, lamb shank and salmon. The food was excellent and portions were sizeable. We were extremely satiated despite going in hungry.

The service was exceptional. We were attended to by Shyamala and she was really warm. Her recommendations were spot on and she constantly made sure everything was perfect. The other servers whom we didn't manage to catch their names were also attentive and excellent.

Would highly recommend the restaurant."
Pool party at Escape was aaaamaazingg!,"Attended a pool party event here and the ambience was amazing. Had a wonderful experience and fun. Patrick, Rusty, Velan, Ravin, Arora and Ayu was superb! They ensure all partygoers are taken care. Food was great too! Especially the zingwings!! The tall handsome malay chef bbqing the satay was awesome!"
Hidden gem with modest steak prices,"Organized a ‚Äòsteak with red‚Äô dinner get together for a group of 12 with the following criteria - affordable but tasty steaks, accessible by public transport and escape from the crowds. No surprise, we mostly had beef (and 2 lamb shanks) and my only gripe was that it was not medium rare as I asked for, rather more medium done. Each main came with 2 sides and a sauce of choice and the saut√©ed spinach with mushrooms, buttery potato pur√©e and popular peppercorn sauce were nicely served. Diligent and patient staff on service in a cozy ambience.

As the host, I polled my guests and asked if they would come back again and I got an unanimous ‚Äòyes‚Äô."
Dinner,"Service was warm and my spouse and I had an awesome dinner. The truffle mushroom soup is a must try! They started off with warm complimentary bread. Ample staffing so needs are well attended to. Portion is good. The pork ribs are tender and tasty. Will be back for more. We arrived at 630 and could see sunset, almost unlock view."
Good food and service,"Enjoyed my lunch at escape. Had prawn Arrabiata and steak (5 stars for the food and service)

And earl Grey tea

(Special thanks to Ms Syamala and Mdm Chun)

Take a lift from level 1 to level 6."
Overall a good experience,"Service was good, staff was friendly. Food was good with the exception of the steaks. Got two medium rare sirloins but it felt more well done than medium rare. The lamb shank was exceptional and the fish n chips was fresh. Pork ribs was not sweet which was welcomed."
Mother‚Äôs Day Dinner,"Good food, good service. The waitress Syamala is very attentive and offered very good service. 5 stars for food and service. We are happy to spend our Mother‚Äôs Day celebration here."
Mother‚Äôs Day dinner,Awesome service by the staff! Odneh odneh cake is a must try for all family. Great view and solid ambiance for family or couple!
Great service & good food,"Great service! We arrived earlier than the opening hours but Syamala is so sweet to let us in. Bread is served warm with butter, olive oil & balsamic vinegar, and the mushroom soup is so flavourful. The ribeye steak is nicely done (medium rare) and the asparagus taste great. There‚Äôs a QR code to scan to get a welcome pack with complimentary beer or wine & dining voucher! Keep up the great work, we will be back definitively."
"Cosy setting, splendid service and tasty meals that's pleasing to the eyes and taste buds",My first since the restaurant relocated to level 6. A lovely place to catch up over a good meal. Servive was personal and attentive from Syamala and thr team. Looking forward to back again.
Compliment,"I would like to give compliment to Ravin and Ayu for their excellent service skills. The recommendation of the food was great and I would like to add on the food was great, chef did a great job. This was my first visit I will be back again. It was my birthday and I enjoyed it. You guys made my day . Thank you so much See you again soon"
Good service & Generous,"Came as a family, kids enjoyed the food. Waiters & waitresses were friendly & generous with their bread, olive oil vinegar & water. Also cleared & changed our plates in a timely manner.
It happened to be rainy day, they were thoughtful to advise us to sit inside & offered us umbrellas."
Awesome food and service,"After reviewing a few places eat we settled on Escape . And it was a brilliant choice . Service was top notch with service staff willing to go the extra mile . Syamala in particular was extra attentive, explaining in detail the food and assisting us with my son needs as he is a toddler ."
Little poolside restaurant,"Customer service was good, staff were generally attentive (maybe because it was off peak) and the food was overall tasty. But i find menu selection a bit lacking, steak were a bit more towards well then medium well. Mash could have a bit more butter. Will consider coming again if they had Eatigo discount again and more selection, esp for kids."
nice food,"nice food . good service. will come back again. thanks. steak, sauce, soup, burger. drink all are great"
"Wonderful service, good affordable food","Had a wonderful experience with the staff, Mirza, who made very good recommendations and would come back to ask on the food and whether it was satisfactory.

27th Wedding Anniversary üçæü•Ç,"We had a wonderful 27th Wedding Anniversary dinner and red wine here

Spent my birthday here with my wife and kids. Food is superb really enjoyed the streak and the Service is excellent as well.

Thank you Chef Jenrick and Chef Roy for the delicious food and thank you Yee Ping and Ayu for the fantastic service."
my kids enjoyed,I went back to escape with my family this time. We were attended by friendly staff Mirza and Velan. Thank you for being nice and making sure everything is fine with our order and bill. The food was good and my kids were happy with their meals. They finished up everything. We ordered the wagyu striploin and angus ribeye. They also loved the sweet potato and truffle fries.
Birthday celebration,Staffs are very accomodating. Foods are very tasty.we will definitely come back. Thank You very much
Birthday üéÇ celebration,It was a very pleasant dining experience. . Thumbs up to nafisah/velan/chunlan/chef Roy. The food is very good
2 Wagyu some parts extremely salty + 2 red wine,"My 2nd time ordering from Escape. Ordered Ribeye in Dec end for lunch. This time round, ordered 2 Wagyu beef and 2 red wine. The Wagyu are tasty. But some parts are kinda salty. The salt was not spread evenly, hence some parts of the meat is extremely salty. Which means I have to use water to wash it away. That means the original taste of the delicious wagyu beef would be washed off by the tap water. The Kale is nice. The sweet potato fries is average, as most of them are not crispy, and some of them are chao tah. The red wine portion is extremely little, probably 25% of the red wine was filled up on the cup. The red wine cost us about $20+ each cup. We ordered two cups. This gives the impression that the restaurant is kinda miser."
Awesome visiting & Dining experience,"Definitely great experience both for dining and service. Mike & Team were very hospitable in arranging reservations for my family & also serving us for the meals. Food was awesome, the bbq ribs were tender & juicy. Nonetheless, would like to commendate Mike from escape for his excellent service and friendliness, he is a role model to his service staff and team. Well done Mike!"
will surely revisit,"great taste, gd value n excellent ambience with impeccable service by the service staff. prompt service and good recommendations."

"Great service, good food, value for money","Good food. Attentive staff . Nice environment especially this time of the year where we sat by the pool side. Thanks to Mirza, Chun Lan, Velan, Chandra and Yee Ping who made our visits were so memorable. Price is very reasonable particularly when you have discount from some reservation platform."

Keep up the good work!
See u again soon :)"
"Great food, value for money","We have been to the previous Escape which served Buffet. This is a new Eacape steak house located in the 6th floor pool side. The area around the pool side is still going through some renovations but it has a huge space. The interior of the restaurant is rather small but the sewing can be improved. It doesn‚Äôt give you a cosy feeling because of the set up, lighting and furniture. Now about the food. We had ribeye, pork ribs, mozzarella tomatoes, mushroom soup, brownies and coffee. The food is excellent, from starter to dessert. The medium steak is done to perfection and the ribs are juicy and tender. Every dish is excellent. Also, they are having promotion on a few food reservation platforms. It really deserves 5stars"
Must try indian cuisine,Excellent service. Nice ambience. Friendly staff and the manager was very helpful. Indian cuisine is probably the best I have tried in Singapore.

Good place to eat and chill,"Visited this place as a last minute recommendation from a friend. No regrets. In terms of service from Yee Ping who was the one serving us, absolutely love her honest and sincere attitude in recommending the food and handling our requests all the way. Mirza and Iya as the waiter and waitress, can't fault them in their warmness and friendliness in welcoming us and attending to us too.

Food wise, enjoyed their fried calamari and wagyu steak. Oh and the cheese cake and vanilla ice cream dessert, it was a blast! The pairing of the ice cream and the cheese cake was a perfect harmony of lightness and sweetness."

Loved the steak & the people!,"We visited the restaurant while staycationing at the hotel. We simply wanted to try their steak.
