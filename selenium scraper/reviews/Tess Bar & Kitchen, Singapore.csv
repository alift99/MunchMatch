Best lamb shoulder ever!,"What an extraordinary place we just visited today! One of the best lunches we could ever find. I had a perfectly cooked lamb shoulder; my friend had the warm Tess salad which was also spectacular. The grand finale was the mouthwatering lava cake with ice cream…

Portions were really generous, a five star service, great selection of drinks and a really beautiful setting. Highly recommend!"
"Great food, great cocktails, great service",Quality cocktails with great food for an excellent experience. The service from Peirong was also super attentive and quick. Will definitely be back again.
Perfect brunch,"Tess Bar & Kitchen, Seah Street: Blurred shots correlated to the decreasing sobriety as it’s free flow cocktails and food. This is one of my fav free flow brunch spots in town. It’s $98 - a total scream for a great list of cocktails plus really great tasting and beautifully plated food. As I’m a pescatarian, I gave all the other meat dishes a miss but they look wonderful going towards my mates. Try all the cocktails - if you can - the list progresses to stronger concoctions. Seafood stew is the best dish for me as it’s hearty and generous chunks of succulent seafood bathed in a tasty rich seafood broth. Salmon mentaiko was just as eye-pleasing with good flavours to boot. Baked camembert was baked at the right temperature and melts in your mouth. The ambience is kick back and the vintage feel adds to the entire great experience. Bar Uva is their sister joint, with impressive free flows like Tess Bar & Kitchen. #eatstylishtravelstylish"
Unsanitary noticeable but good service and food,"Hosted a couple of foreign friends visiting. They love the food. Light was flickering, multiple handprints on door and toilet was crammed, noisy and unsanitary. This was mitigated by the good service by the Filipino manager."
"Excellent Bar,Vibes and Hospitality","Never had a down time with Tess Bar. It always is my favorite Bar, especially atlfter working hours. The staff are always accommodating fun and has that bright personality! Kudos to you! Peirong, Christyne, Justin and the rest of the team Rocks!! Keep it Up!!"
Outstanding,Great food. The kitchen is clearly working overtime to deliver beautifully presented and delicious dishes. The cocktails are great and service is excellent. I've been here several times and always surprised at how good they are.
Amazing service!!,Excellent service. Extremely attentive and very endearing. Food was great and cocktails were interesting too.
FANTASTIC !,"I have to say that this place has exceeded my expectations. We went to eat a late lunch & an early dinner (Liner) here. Table of 4 was booked and after reaching quickly ordered some appetizers, drinks and then mains. The service staff was very friendly and the decor is really nice. I loved the risotto, chicken karage, lamb shoulder, baked Camembert and calamari. The portion sizes are also fabulous. The food really hit the spot. The drinks were delicious as well, you must have the sour power drink To end the meal, we ordered the delicious tiramisu and the dark chocolate molten lava cake. 5/5 for me ! We will surely be back to try some new dishes and cocktails. As of now, we are skipping dinner… after the hearty delicious indulgence"
Delightful,Excellent food and wine. Good service. Great ambiance. I would have no hesitation in recommending Tess to others and will definitely go back again.
Ala Carte Brunch Buffet that's worth your money!,"SMALL PLATES
Pan Roasted Cauliflower ($14)
Cauliflower here is coated generously with their Miso cheese sauce, and came with lots of scorched cashew for extra crunch. Although the Miso cheese was slightly powdery, but I liked the strong cheese flavour here.

Triple-cooked Crackling Pork Belly ($13)
This was indeed crispy, and kinda interesting with the ""Asian dip""? Reminded of those dark sauce w/ sugar..?

Oven Baked Camembert ($24)
First time trying baked Camembert, and this version came with Summer truffles & Garlic Toast. Really interesting pairing, altho Camembert might not be a cheese for everyone with it's stronger cheese flavour.

Crispy Chicken Kaarage ($13)
I liked that their Kaarage was crispy on the outside, and the chicken was q tender! Paired with the sweet and spicy Ssamjang Sauce made it an enjoyable one overall!

Double Fried Chunk Chips ($12)
The star is definitely their Truffle Baba Ganoush Dip - truffle was really strong, the dip went well with the crispy and chunky chips. Great as a sharing side!

Deep Fried Calamari & Zucchini ($14)
The calamari was too chewy for my liking, so didn't particularly enjoyed this. The verdita sauce also contains coriander, so didn't particularly liked it.

Grilled Lamb Short Ribs ($18)
Altho the lamb was pretty soft, I didn't liked that the lamb was q gamey. Lamb fans would prob enjoy tho!

BRUNCH/ MAINS
Forest Mushroom Risotto ($20)
Summer black truffles, brown rice, Pecorino cheese. This was quite creamy, although I'm not used to brown rice being in risotto, providing an additional crunchy texture in the dish.

Orecchiette pasta w/ Pesto & Sausage ($24)
Despite having some thicker orecchiette being slightly undercooked, the sausage was really good here, with it being pretty flavourful!

Italian Pork Sausage Foccacia Pizza ($24)
The pork sausage used here is identical to the one in the orecchiette. Foccacia was decent, and I'd consider it a nice starter, even tho it's under the brunch menu.

Broiled Mentaiko Salmon ($22)
What you'd expect from Salmon, but surprisingly could taste the mentaiko even though we couldn't really see the sauce visually - flavour was not bad.

Slow-cooked Angus Beef Cheek ($26)
The beef was extremely tender, which I really loved, but it was also extremely salty. If not for the saltiness, I would have really loved this dish.

Overall Rating: 7.5/10"
"Good service, great food","Nice decor and vibes, chill place. Food is really good. Overall a great experience at Tess Bar. Try the Cauliflower dish!"
Prompt service and delicious food,"The food had generous portion and was tasty. The happy hours promotions had a great selection too. Most importantly, service with a smile."
Dinner,"Great ambience, friendly staff, and the food is always so delicious! Happy hour cocktails the best! Recommended to make table reservations!"
AWESOME BAR TO CALL THE USUAL FROM NOW ON,"The bar food awesome ! Chicken skin and double fried chips my favourite ! Cracking pork belly was crispy and juicy as well. For a bar their coffee latte is pretty good!

I will definitely come back again cos why say no to good food and service!"
Nice restaurant with great food,"Overall, had a great experience. Staff was friendly and attentive. Food was pretty good. Great ambience. Sat indoor but still relatively quiet."
Lunch,Beef cheeks were tough and dry. My friend didn't like it and left it untouched. Seafood stew was not as flavoursome as thought but still not bad. Calamari batter was very nice but squid was a bit rubbery. But worth to order. Overall nice atmosphere and good service.
Highly recommended cosy bar,"The interior was cosy. The food was impeccable, we had almost all the appetizers (calamari with zucchini sauce was very addictive, the cripsy chicken skin was fried beautifully - not too dark, the roasted pork was so tender - must order, the lamb short ribs melt in your mouth, though the lamb scent was still pretty strong, the potato chips were delicious - the truffle creamy sauce was fragrant, the roasted cauliflower was crunchy where the miso tasted like cheese). Also had the foccacia based pizza which had generous amount of meat and cheese. The service was amazing as well, I requested for Sangria and didn't expect much as it was off menu, but turned out to be the best Sangria I've had."
Very expensive. To be avoided.,$42 for a beer and a simple cocktail. We definitely got overcharged with very unclear explanation. Hardly any service. We chose to pay and walk away rather than to argue. Walk away.
Good place to enjoy great food and drinks!,Love this place and served quite amazing food and drinks. Lots of drinks to choose from and come before 7pm to enjoy some good deals on happy hour drinks.. wine have pretty good deal ! $10 per 150ml glass.. do order the crispy pork belly a must to try .. melting in your mouth and the skin is still crispy! The chicken Karaage is so so .. too dry inside to my liking . Prefer the more briny oyster instead ! Table is rather too small for us to order 4 dishes and served at one go. Do pace it that something restaurant needs to pay attention to in my view. Enjoyed the vibe here and great service !
Great drinks with friends,"The night out at Tess bar and kitchen was really great and we were able to have conversations in the restaurant. The ambience is good for friends and couples. The drinks were amazing, especially Le Prince #2 and Snorkelling in Boracay."
Attentive service and good food,"Food portions are generous with special cocktails. Servers are friendly and attentive. Overall, an enjoyable dining experience."
Having a fab friday night,"Had a booking at 7:15pm but got there before Happy Hour ends at 7pm. At only $12, the buckwheat godfather cocktail was strong and simply made to perfection….yums.

Been a while since I came here and in view of the current covid situation, I like how the restaurant has split the wide-table with 4-seaters into 2s on each side by placing a centre-piece tall glass across the table. Now I get to sit comfortably side -by-side with my date/friend without having to talk louder or strain to hear ea other across the table.

Overall, food was great; cocktails/drinks was yum and service was pretty fast and attentive. Already looking forward to be back soon."
Yum to the Power of Yum!,"I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday, and we both enjoyed it so much! Although it was just the two of us, we ordered a feast:
- Double Fried Chips, Truffle Aioli
- Grilled Angus Grain-Fed Rib Eye, Roasted Capsicum Agrodolce & Toasted Almonds
- Sakura Ebi Capellini, Ikura & Anchovy Crumbs
- Oven Baked Camembert, Summer Truffles & Garlic Toast
- Tess Truffle Ice Cream

Every single dish was amazing and delicious - especially the Oven Baked Camembert and Double Fried Chips (something different!). As a special treat, they waived off the Truffle Ice Cream for us and even placed a candle of the ice cream and sang Happy Birthday when presenting it to my friend. What a thoughtful gesture which made the dining experience all the more memorable and delicious!"
"Great place, great food","It was really good food, good choice. I just miss more sweetie things for brunch like croissants, pancakes..."
Buzzing place with Great Cocktail and Food,"We particularly enjoyed a few of the sides, and definitely the cocktail! The ambiance is perfect for a night to wind down."
Tried the brunch,"I've tried a few brunches in Singapore, but somehow missed this. We tried the sea bass and the beef cheeks, both excellent, also tried the two gin cocktails which again were excellent. Also the staff were great. I cant wait to go back."
Excellent brunch buffet,One of the best a la carte buffets along with free flow drinks for its price in Singapore. Food and drinks are good and service is friendly. Ambience is very nice as well. I'll be back!
Wonderful time at Tess Bar,My family and i went to Tess bar on the first day of CNY and had such a wonderful time there. We had the brunch buffet which was a bang for your buck. The service was excellent food was tasty and atmosphere was chill. Will definitely go back there again. Thanks to all the staff there.
A must visit! Truly a hidden gem!,"I was surprised to find the place buzzing with good vibes and crowd on a weekday night. Food was good, but it was the service the Tess team offered that won me over. Super friendly and helpful service crews who made my visit a spectacular one. Kudos to the team!"
For cocktails and niap niap,"We were there to celebrate my birthday. My friend found the seating arrangement uncomfortable. But their food (calamari, dressed oysters, lamb ribs) thoroughly made up for it and the cocktails... totally enjoyed them."
"Great place for a long lunch, but can be dicey on service","I have been there thrice with friends for nice long lunches. Great food, great environment, superb martinis; all at a reasonable price. 2 out of 3 occasions were fantastic, the last was a let down because of service staff attitude. Luck of the draw."
One of the best weekend brunch spots,"How Tess Bar and Kitchen escaped my carefully curated list of weekend free-flow booze and ala carte brunch at an affordable price tag baffles me. This place is awesome. For $92, you get free-flow martini’s, wine and beer. My favourite is the candy-crush-cute Salted Caramel Espresso with colourful candy rice on glass. Food is palatable and beautifully plated – and you’re spoilt for choice with the generous selections of brunch, small plates, mains and desserts. Standout dish was seafood stew with hearty servings of seafood. Desserts were beautiful – order all 3 apple pie, tiramisu and valhrona chocolate cake. Service was considerate and on-point. We had complimentary gin cocktail on the house too. Kids pay only $24 including free-flow non-alcoholic drinks, all in all inking this wonderful brunch as an all-rounder sound investment and one of the best brunch options."
Night out with friends,"Loved the starters and mains, though the tiramisu dessert could be better. We had happy hour drinks, which were pretty solid (no watered down stuff). Wonderful atmosphere."
Great place,"Overall excellent experience, staff were friendly and helpful, menu has good variety and everything we ordered was delicious, cocktails were good too, good value for money, will definitely be back to try the rest of the food on the menu."
Great Service & Nice Cocktails,Went there for the first time and the service provided was great. Staff are friendly and cocktail drinks are nice.
Decent Food - Cozy Environment - Great Service,Went there for team dinner. Cozy bar with various drinks and foods. Good ambience and great service. *just my Lobster Macaroni is a little too salty. =D
Great Drinks and service,We went there for drinks and snacks. The drinks and service were great. The late night menu is great value for $. The food selection for vegetarians is a bit limited. The available items tasted good :)
"Unlimited gourmet food, for either $40++ or $80++ (depending if you want alcohol or not)","Nice bar, dark with warm lights (a bit hipster).
The food is very tasty and no dish is ever boring or standard. The chef's team is very skilled and the service is also friendly and quick.
The best part is the free flow of food and drinks for less than 50 SGD (if you don't order alcohol) per person, in downtown Singapore!
We had a birthday brunch there and it was great!"
Best bar along seah street,"Visited tess on numerous occasions. Food has always been consistently good. The bar snacks such as the pork and chicken dish are really good. Accompanied with homemade sauce makes it even better. Cocktails are well made and they have a creative menu.

Not the cheap but definitely worth the visit and worth a 5 star review. Best bar along seah street"
Birthday brunch,"Service was prompt, cheerful and helpful. Food was delicious especially the tea which was aromatic!."
"A cosy place, nice environment",A cosy place to have gathering with friends and colleagues. They serve good food and drinks. I love their pork belly and sausage pizza
Great little bar with great food,Great little bar with outstanding cocktails and superb food Highly recommend the small plate pork belly and the roast vegetables
Awesome Saturday Brunch,Great food and vibes! The Bail Cucumber Martini is so refreshing and good that it is almost dangerous as I could just go on drinking! The beef cheek was to die for! Will definitely be back. If I have to pick a bone will be the waitress lack of or limited knowledge on wine when my friend asked for recommendation.
Great food and service at a cosy restaurant,"The food was really at reasonable prices. The service was really good even though there was only 1 lady serving on a weekday. She was knowledgable and v friendly even though she was the only one managing everything. Be prepared to wait a little, though not too long because I think there is also only 1 chef. At least when I went yesterday 090919. The sakura prawn pasta was different and very delicious and so was my soft shell crab black ink pasta. Add $5 and make it into a set meal with soup and gelato/coffee. Its a great place to meet someone during lunch if you are in that area."
Can-go-to place,Nice cosy place and not too noisy for a sit down chat. Interesting range of martinis though would be better if stronger. Food was reasonably priced n nice. Service was prompt n good too. Would go again!
Shame about the Smokers!,My husband and I shared an outside leaner with 3 females which was fine as inside was full. When it is 28 degrees at 8.30pm an outside table is not first choice but as I said inside was full. Service was slow at the beginning but apologies were made by a pleasant female staff member. Drinks and food were excellent. At the end of our table but to the right (between restaurants) was a smokers ashtray of some sort which we didn’t notice until we had 5 smokers standing at the end of our table! Whilst smoke was not blown directly our way we would not have chosen this place to eat had we known there was an ashtray at the end of our table. When spending $188 on a meal out we would not choose to share with smokers!
Spectacular bar and food!!,This place is very very cool. Chilled atmosphere. Great music. Fabulous food. Awesome cocktail menu. Bar menu. Great service. A beautiful cool bar to hang out in!
Great tapas for gatherings,"Was quite impressed actually, after thinking the food portions would be too small as it was tapas-style and we would still be hungry after this meal last Friday. We ordered about 4 dishes and they were awesome and filling especially the Cloudy Bay Clams and Deep fried calamari. The broth that came with the clams was just heavenly and not salty. Had 3 blanc tap beers for the 3 of us (probably the only let down), not a great deal of beer choice, and to top it off the waiter, sorry didn't get his name, who told us that it was his first day of work, offered to get us each a glass of water. This was a most impressive gesture on his part even though he explained it was his usual practice - however it was the first time a waiter had offered us water after our alcoholic drinks. You have great staff, do keep it up! Hope to be back soon!"
good,"food was average, service could be better. good ambience and easily accessible from the esplanade MRT."
Great cocktails & Girl Pwr! ( Power),Celebrate friend's birthday. Great cocktails. Awesome music. Total girl power. Dessert & whoever who wrote the birthday msg really has artistic talent. The staff really took care of us and I appreciate the thoughtful-ness.
Great Date Night,"Came here to celebrate my SO’s birthday. The waitress was attentive from the moment we walked in, quick to take our orders. Both the food and drinks were delightful; the food is great value for what you pay given how expensive eating out in Singapore tends to be. The 8oz steak was cooked to a perfect level; tender, juicy, and flavourful. Skip the baked Camembert with truffle; it got cold quickly served on a plate instead of in a baking dish that retained its heat. Bone marrow is very rich, but delicious with super tender cubes of melt in your mouth beef atop of it."
Whisky tasting,I was able to attend one of their whisky tasting events and absolutely loved the experience. I also enjoyed their variety of dishes and great drink selections.
Classy cheap bar in Singapore,We found this cool little bar and restaurant opposite Raffles and the JW Marriott $10 pints of Kronenbourg and wine and $12 pints of Guinness. The food is reasonably priced as well Ragout $16 Calamari $12 etc
A great night! Gluten free friendly,"This is a great side street restaurant and bar, lively with really good music, delicious cocktails and mouth watering meals. Service was great and they were very accommodating for gluten free."
No better place on a Friday night than Tess Bar & Kitchen!,"Another fantastic night at Tess Bar & Kitchen in the heart of Singapore. Fantastic selection of Cocktails and amazing tasting food menu. Great Tapas for us. You just keep selecting through the night and these amazing dishes just keep rolling out. Hot or Cold, all amazing tasting food. You will not be disappointed. Book to ensure a table on arrival."
Dinner and a pleasant suprise,"I was actually looking for another place the loof and as I was driving around I saw this place and it was crowded. Being single I walked in got a place by the bar. the waitresses are very friendly and polite and gave good recommendations not only finding me a seat by the bar but made me feel comfortable. I had the starters pork ribs, bone marrow and balls risotto and mind you they were very filling and rich. the pork ribs melts in your mouth, the sauce had almond flakes and was sweet and sour. The bone marrow was freaking awesome i almost fell off my chair and the bread was toasted to perfection. the risotto balls not much of a fan was a bit tasteless. they have great selection of cocktails and their boulvadier sour man that hit the spot when you have good food. definitely i am going to hit the place again and this time have their mains. definitely a place to bring a date.. chaps."
Best service staff ever,"I chance upon this after staying in a hotel nearby. I want to send my upmost compliments to Pei Rong. She was by far the best service staff I have ever encountered. She is that good. From the positive body language and smile, to the meticulous attention to detail (noting that the food was taking some time to serve) and the display of product knowledge and she achieved all the above by being only a 1-person service crew!!! She was serving the whole bar by herself!! And she was amazing and impeccable. My best compliments to her and the bar is very lucky indeed to have her.
And despite me not taking up the breakfast buffet option, being a smaller eater, I have to mention their breakfast buffet is worth the price and will defintely recommend friends there!!!
Thank you Pei Rong!!!"
"Excellent service, delicious food, creative drink and great ambience","This is my second visit to the Tess Bar, for my Valentine's day celebration.
We found out that the dinner menu have change and remove some dishes that we loved on our first visit.
Trying our luck to have a special request for the Mushroom Brown Rice Risotto, the kitchen gladly fulfilled our request !

What more to say ? Excellent service from the waiters, waitress and the chefs.

We had a great and cosy time at Tess Bar, will definitely visit again."
Service was pretty bad,"The lady who served us probably did not understand the meaning of service. She seemed arrogant and very reluctant to serve. Also, when asked if the restaurant has this or that, she just answered 'No' and 'No' and 'No' (like in a take it or leave it manner)."
Regular Hangout but staff on duty play a BIG difference,"We had guest from Overseas and suggested their weekend brunch as we know their quality of food is good to even great. To our surprise, we were allowed to order from the entire lunch menu (minus oysters) and the servings were the regular size ones and of course, HUGE! Better for large group dining and probably not suited for less than four pax, if you prefer variety.As always, we enjoyed the lamb, pork belly, cheese platters, beef steak, salads and they have a great selection of drinks too! The guys paid $69++ for free-flow alcoholic drinks. Guess the only thing that can change this to a 5* review is an improvement of the brunch service staff who's attitude is very direct and in your face. Not too rude, but definitely not service-oriented.Other than that, we are happy to return as their kitchen and bar are of good quality and creativity!"
Food’s quality always satisfying,"Love the choice of cocktails Tess Bar offered. Brought different group of friends to Tess Bar a few times, and everyone always ended with great dining experience."
"Delicious food and drinks, consistently good service, fantastic ambience","Must tries: aged cheddar cauliflower, lamb ribs, wagyu sliders, calamari My friends and I are addicted to TESS. We'll keep coming back as long as they maintain current standards. Cool and unpretentious."
Pleasantly surprised!,"We had low expectations- the noisy bar vibe isn't our scene.
But the food turned out really good (even basic chips were different and yummy), cocktails were interesting, and despite the crowd- service was good. Food portions were great too.
Areas of improvement:
1. Bar stools rather uncomfortable
2. Food took quite a long time to come though I guess it was cos of the crowd
3. More wine by glass options

On the whole, will def recommend and return, we enjoyed our night."
Unexpected,"First time at this place. Had a countdown to New Year's with a couple of friends, they ordered the festive set which was worth the $90. I ordered the bone marrow, ribeye, lamb ribs as well as chef nibbles and camembert with truffle.

Bone marrow- a mix between the marrow and the meat surrounding the bone all sliced up nicely and served with garlic bread on the side. Garlic bread was good and crispy but I wished the meat had a little more flavour.

Ribeye- I ordered a medium rare, it was nicely done and still juicy and tender. The mash complimented the savoury meat and absorbed all the juice from the meat. The mustard at the side was not necessary for me.

Lamb ribs was soft and tender, comes off the bone easily and the bits of almonds and pomegranate complimented nicely.

Chef nibbles- Crispy chicken skin served with a mayo that packs a punch to it.

Camembert- Comes with actual truffles and shrooms stuffed in the center.

Food was awesome but service was a little behind, there was some errors to the bill with overcharging as they included the complimentary alcohol that came along in the festive set. Also, no information was given so we actually did our own calculations and came to our own conclusion.

Overall, would come back but just remember to check the bill.

Chef nibbles-"
Great Place to hang out!,Took the festive menu set and food were great and portion huge. Very attentive service from the crews and most of all Excellent cocktails!
Value for money is an understatement,"The $30++ weekend a la carte brunch buffet is a steal. (Yes, we overordered.) Service is wonderful and the food, which is overall delicious, comes fast – a mystery since we only spotted one zen individual presiding over the kitchen. I recommend holding off on the additional $30++ for freeflow booze if you'd be happy with a couple of drinks, since they're also reasonably priced."
"food are nice, great but the oysters are my fav","love their oyster, its really fresh and great taste. when there the 2nd time and it is still great taste. Other food like their lamb rack and beer sliders are nice too"
TESS IS THE BESS,"This place is awesome. Went there for drinks after dinner and then for lunch. The food is great, the service is warm and place is fantastic. A must try in Singapore"
TESS is the place!,"Just had a family lunch at TESS.

For myself, ordered the tomato soup, sirloin steak, potato chips with their special dip. Finished with a wonderful canola italian dessert and black coffee.

Service staff were courteous and friendly. Wonderful recommnedation from the menu. Compliments to the chef for a great job from the kitchen! Food presentation was beautiful

All in all, great food, wonderful ambience and friendly staff ... all at a reasonable price ... TESS is the place"
Great food at a good price,"Cool, relaxed vibe. Good array of cocktails (but oddly only a few wines on offer). Surprisingly delicious food. The lamb is delicious, and the mushroom risotto some of the best I've tasted. Pork belly starter is also a star. Bone marrow is succulent and tasty, but not such a big portion. Been to this restaurant twice and will return again. The service is slightly spotty, as they seem understaffed. But the food makes up for the shortcomings."
Friday night,"Many locals and tourists came here on Friday night, the vibe really made us relaxed. We got promotion after 10 p.m. (10SGD each cocktail and snack), all of these were tasty."
Great place to chill,"I’ve aleays enjoyed myself at Tess. Great food, great drinks, awesome people behind the scenes, good music!!"
Yummy food and cocktail,Yummy food and cocktails. Caught their truffle specials. Love them! Very good tasting. Will definitely be back.
Good cocktail and service,Must drink the Gin and Sangria cocktail. The food is great especially the fries. Service is great. The setback is the seat. The low seat is a bit uncomfortable to lean back and the high chair is not friendly for short ladies who wears skirt.
Eye rolls,It is a lovely space but the staff leave a lot to be desired very grumpy. Really made us feel very uncomfortable
Great place to start (and sometimes end) the night,"Located next to the Naumi, it was a perfect kick-off point for our first night in Singapore. A tradition that we continued each night. Good selection of beers and wine coupled with friendly attentive service makes a great combination. You should also try the squid!"
A tale of 3 cities,Interesting collaboration between #tessbarsg and the Sydney pair from Dead Ringer. Great cocktails paired with small plate food. The Contrast cocktail by Tim Philips was very interesting and the scallops with eggplant jam was interesting. Can't wait for the Thursday guest shift by the Manila of David Ong and Chef Jordy!!!
Great Cocktails and Food,"We had the small plates (like tapas) of tuna, cauliflower cheese and potatoes. They were all great, quite large portions. Lovely cocktails, nice staff. I like it here, will be back!"
Delicious Lunch,Quaint bar/restaurant with a warm interior. Delicious food and the staff were very friendly and engaging. Will be back!
Surprisingly good food,"Place is nice & modern, music not too blasting loud, so conversation is bearable without having to scream or shout. Ordered the meat platter - Wagu Beef, Lamb, Chicken, Cauliflower, Sausages, Fries, Baby Quids, Cheese Paltter - Awesome food!"
Love the experience and will be back.,"Loved the small bites that we've ordered! We had the yellowfin tuna tataki, Wagyu Striploin and Chips with trio dip. For drinks, I'm definitely recommending the Queen Of Spade whisky cocktail!"
Excellent atmosphere,Cheese is a must to try. Steak is pretty rare unless further instruction is given before grilling the steak.
Excellent food,"Tried the weekly special of Grilled Japanese sea bream (tai) with confit tomatoes, it was excellent. Their new Chef Kenneth is doing a great job. Can't wait to try his new menu in Dec. Did not have any cocktails this time, just a monkey shoulder highball."
Pleasant Night,Love it! Managed to wait till monkey shoulders. Tried the whiskey too. Scallops is highly recommended. Service was great!
Great hospitality!,"Awesome place to chill out with friends , look for bartender jing and he will not disappoint you! Will definitely come back again!"
Good for drinks,"Good selection of drinks, good value at happy hour. Food is decent but bite portions are big, would not recommend more than 3 dishes for 2 to share."
Great restaurant and bar in City Hall,I've eaten here for both dinner and lunch and the food is great. The drinks menu is amazing with excellent cocktails both with our without alcohol.
Cozy place with nice food,"The place is quite cozy and the food was nice, though on the pricey side. Medium plates are good for sharing for 2."
Young and energantic crew,Ok I This is already by numerous return so I am not going to comment on the food and drink . I like the frontline team at the resturant . I think they are probably half my age but they definitely have high EQ for their age . I can feel their determination to make the resturant successful .
Nice cocktail!,"The cocktails are awesome! They take it seriously how to make it. The foods are also delicious. Worth the price.. No wonder that when we arrived around 5pm, all the tables inside were already fully booked. :)"
very relaxing Friday day off spend,I reach resturant at 1.35pm and left at about 4.30pm. It was a very relax afternoon spend at the resturant . Waitress was very knowledgable on the cocktails in the menu. I took 4 cocktails and 1 sparkling wine . This explain how much I enjoy and time flies within that 3 hours .
Amazing Food and Great Service,The food was amazingly good - have to try the Brown Rice Mushroom Risotto and White Wine Clam! I was really surprised. The waiter recommended according to our taste and reviews on other people. Our beef was slightly overcooked (Medium instead of Medium Rare) and they immediately took it back and gave us another one.
Happy Hour Fun,"Wonderful, cozy bar for pre-dinner drinks with the nicest bar staff. Though only one of us (in a party of 5) made it to Tess on time for the amazing happy hour deal (50% off all drinks from 5-7), the bartender allowed her to pre-order discounted drinks for us in our absentia. When we arrived, our cocktails were ready and waiting and expertly crafted. Fun, original cocktail menu and a knowledgable and friendly staff that to guide you through the ordering process. Though we had other dinner plans, the food enjoyed by the neighboring tables looked and smelled delicious. Will definitely return with an empty belly and a curious thirst. Thanks for an amazing pre-game, Tess!"
SINFUL FRIDAY NIGHT,It's a sinful friday night out. Was craving for Tess Bar roast pork. Done in perfect crispness of the skin. Totally sinful but worth the calories!😁 Pair with whisky and it'll be my perfect friday night out! 😍
Lived up to our memories,"We came here about a year ago and wanted to come back.

We were delighted once again with the friendly service, relaxed funky vibe and good food.

The Sliders were still tasty. I love the art on the walls too. Definitely a great place to meet friends or for a bite and a drink at happy hour after a days shopping.

We will be back again."
Wonderful meal and ambience,"Two of us went on a Thursday evening and we happened to get there 10min before 7pm and in time for Happy Hour with 30% off drinks. Food was great with sizeable portions - had 4 tapas of camembert cheese, sambal baby octopus, triple-cooked pork belly, sausages and 1 main of prawn linguini. Everything was delicious! Such a good meal. We'll be back for sure."
3 course lunch @ $18++,"Came back here again today for lunch. We were the only people and so the service was good. The 3 course lunch @ $18++ is great value. Salad or soup for starter, main course and dessert or coffee. No complaints."
Interesting cocktail,the restaurant created their own cocktails and some are very interesting and fancy. The food is also good and I enjoyed the wagyu cubes.
Worth checking out,Went there for happy hour. Good food and drinks and service was excellent! Kudos to all the staff and the manager (i think) who kept smiling and being friendly despite busy hours ☺️
Amazing food,"I was amazed since greeting from staff, there were nice and cheerful upon arrival. Food was great and fresh!"
