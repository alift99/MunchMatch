"Good food, entertaining chef","Enjoyed the teppanyaki , food was good. Chef tommy Yeo was very entertaining and interactive with my children and they loved him and his food. He made good recommendations and my son said it was the best fried rice he’s ever had."
Sublime Teppanyaki Lunch with Chef Eric Yong,"Sublime Teppanyaki Lunch with Chef Eric Yong

Wonderful lunch with epic display on the grill by Chef Eric.

Delicious menu which could only have been improved with a wine pairing option.

Lovely range of dishes and ways to cook them with a personal twist and display by Chef Eric making the difference for our lunch.

Recommended."
"Quite bad value for ""Osechi"" experience","We went to the restaurant on 1 Jan for the traditional Japanese Osechi おせち for lunch. When we asked the waitress to explain what was included, she couldn't quite tell us what it was (bad training). There was also no written description of the plate (bad preparation, other restaurants not only had the items, but their meanings).

Traditionally, it should be quite a few items and enough as a meal. At a cost of S$108 (US$80) each, we assumed it should be fine. To our surprise, it came as only one small box with 6 or 7 tiny little morsels (picture attached).

We have had quite a few of Osechi in different restaurants, and we couldn't help but feel this is a major ripoff even the assistant manager offered to shave one plate off the bill. If the restaurant is unable to offer a real Osechi experience, they shouldn't even bother, and instead this restaurant offers a mini version and charges the full, real-experience price.

Even the weekend bunch reads like a good deal, we won't be repeated customers."
Great service!,The wagyu set was great! Bento was alright. Service was awesome! Esp by the manager (think his name was Joseph) who was friendly and warm.
Keyaki Dinner,"We have an enjoyable dinner at keyaki. Ordered Teppanyaki.....and the experience is wonderful! Food is tasty and the Chef in helm at the station, Tommy Yeo whipped up a delicious meal for our family. He is entertaining and explain each dishes well! Good Job!"
"High quality food, poor service.","We went for the sushi kaiseki dinner menu. The food was of high quality and very tasty. Unfortunately, the service was very disappointing. We were seated in front of the entrance, ask for different table but we were told that it was not possible. Even though a table for 2 was vacant the entire evening at the window-side. There is a certain flow to eating a kaiseki, but at this restaurant, the courses were extremely quickly served. The next course was served even though we weren’t finished with the one before that, so you will feel very rushed and the plates were just simply lined up with no explanation.
The dirty plates were not removed in time for the next course. The dessert was an anticlimax to the kaiseki experience, as you were served a strawberry, one cherry and some honey melon. The strawberry was surprisingly unripe.

In summary the restaurant has a beautiful aesthetic, wonderful sashimi, sushi and tempura. But unfortunately for the chef, the serving staff doesn’t complement his level of culinary skills. Was it worth 220 sgd pp? We are so sorry to conclude: definitely not."
Felt like we were in Japan. A5 Japanese wagyu steak was top notch.,"Our older folks loved the entire Japanese garden that the restaurant was within... the wholesome tranquility the koi ponds and zen garden simply puts you in a good mood and sets you up to enjoy the amazing Japanese food in the restaurant.

While their Kaiseki and Bento kept us in awe of how intricate each item was designed and delicately seasoned, the highlight of our meal was still the A5 Japanese Wagyu - one of the best we had with its thick yet thoroughly tender cut. Our little connoisseur chomped down half of that juicy steak in a flash, while the rest of us adults had to slowly saveur the remaining...

Their air flown rock melon sealed our Japanese experience with a sweet ending."
-,"Superb food, amazing ambiance, and the best service, staffs were really friendly and accommodating to all my needs."
Lovely Sunday brunch,"Decided to celebrate daughter's birthday with weekend brunch at Keyaki.

Hadn't visited the restaurant in years so was bowled over by the entrance and walkway to the restaurant.
Styled like a traditional Japanese ryokan almost, the restaurant comprises of 3 segregated areas in a single storeyed building marked by beautiful wooden beams and pillared walkways. The building is set in a typical Japanese Zen rock garden with thriving greenery. A meandering stream and mini waterfall filled with koi, greet you as you approach the entrance.

The pleasure this entrance engendered was further heightened by the attentive service we received from Joseph and Jeff, the wait staff assigned to our table.

We had a total of 5 courses in kaiseki style. They were delicious and beautifully plated - appetisers of assorted vegetables, sashimi,
your choice of agemono ( I chose a mouth-melting codfish), teppanyaki beef ( tender and flavourful) followed by garlic fried rice. These were all of the exacting standard we would expect of Keyaki!
For me, the surprising highlight was the delicate houjicha pudding. The consistency was so on point and not cloyingly sweet! What a nice way to end the meal!

Brunch at Keyaki is conducted in an unhurried way, with adequate time in between courses to chat and enjoy the impeccable decor. So please do not expect hurlyburly service!

Our party was also happily surprised by Joseph serving my daughter a slice of red velvet cake for her birthday after our meal! What a thoughtful and gracious gesture by the restaurant! And the cake was delicious too by the way!

To cap off our brunch, we took a turn around the well-appointed garden. Just for those few moments, we felt transported to Japan again!

Indeed, Keyaki is an entire experience in itself - from the ambience, the wonderful staff ( both senior and junior) and the traditional cuisine offered. Highly recommended!"
Compliment to Chef Tommy Yeo,chef tommy was very patient in recommending and explaining the menu to us as this is our first time here. steak was cooked to perfection and he took an extra mile to check if our food quality for every dish was ok and to our liking. highly recommend to look for him if you are here !
Absolutely a wonderful time,"Had a wonderful experience with Chef Tommy Yeo and server Suresh that attended to us.
Had actually made a reservation asking about birthday cakes but didn't get a reply, was a little disappointed and had intended to do all means to get a cake even if I were to purchase it from the hotel as they do not allow outside cakes to be brought in.
Thankfully Suresh helped us so that I could actually celebrate my mom's birthday!

Service by Chef Tommy was really fantastic, the little conversations he had with us made my family laugh and at the same times the dishes prepared were fantastic.
If you are not keen on garlic fried rice, do let the chef know and alternatives could also be provided. All the small details and service really made the experience I had here unforgettable. Totally worth the price and definitely coming back here for another fantastic experience!"
Wonderful family time with Chef Eric,"My family and I celebrated my nephew's second birthday at Keyaki restaurant on 18 July! It was our first time there and the ambience was great.

We were extremely lucky to be seated where Chef Eric was stationed that day and were treated to an entertaining conversation and delectable teppanyaki meal. We particularly enjoyed his special garlic fried rice, wagyu and scallops.

The service was top notch and the staff even helped to retrieve our cake from the hotel room service promptly.

Thanks Keyaki team for making our family time so memorable. Will be back soon!"
Teppanyaki Dining Experience at Keyaki,"My teppanyaki dining experience at Keyaki with my family last week was a splendid one! We all had dinner sets which were prepared beautifully and with great expertise in front of us by Chef Eric. I particularly loved the lobster with golden sauce, the wagyu beef as well as the fried rice; they were cooked to perfection, so fresh and full of flavour! The experience left us satisfied and impressed - thank you Keyaki and Chef Eric!"
Teppanyaki dinner,Visited Keyaki for their teppanyaki dinner course and was absolutely satisfied with the service and food. Chef Eric Yong was our teppanyaki chef and he displayed professionalism and executed each and every dish with finesse. He cooked the lobster and wagyu beef so well that the quality of the meat was accentuated due to his excellent gauge of doneness. Everything was delicious and we would definitely be back. Thank you chef Eric!
Best Experience we had in Singapore Restaurant,"Food was excellent and not overated. We are served by Chef Eric very entertaining and passionate , at first he is not talking because he is really busy on his cooking. Wan is our server helped us with our sake and wine orders. We are very comfortable at Keyaki Restaurant
and planning to visit again for sure. The Wagyu Sirloin perfectly cooked with wagyu rice ( no saude needed) its good on its own. We order the multi course and the Foie Grass. We want to order more but Wan help us to enjoy the rest of the food first lucky we listened. Because we are too full , they gave us complimentary cake coz we are celebrating Anniversary. Best experience in Singapore for a
long time. We found a restaurant that we can recommend with our friends and family. Look for Wan or Chef Eric if you plan to visit."
Terrible teppanyaki food,"As your records will show, we have dined, celebrated special occasions at the teppanyaki counter at Keyaki many many times over many years. The food and service have always been great!

However, this time around the restaurant declined to offer us seats at the teppanyaki counter which apparently are now reserved for prix fixe diners. So the food was served at the main dining room. Why does Keyaki bother to have an extensive ala carte teppanyaki menu then? Also our ala carte spends have always far exceeded prix fixe prices.

We had the most horrendous and embarrassing dining experience. We had brought our friends to Keyaki to celebrate our friend's birthday. Our friends were left speechless during and after the meal.

The food arrived all at once with no respect for the teppanyaki dining sequence and traditions, was served stone cold (the beef in particular was COLD, DRY & HARD not the sizzling, melt in the mouth beef that we are used to), zero teppanyaki presentation, not served on individual plates as would be at the teppanyaki counter and the restaurant did not even set our table - presumably expecting us to have a communal dinner like in a Chinese restaurant!

Disgraceful for a food court - let alone for a restaurant which brands itself as a top, fine dining gastronomical Japanese restaurant in Singapore.

Will never again have teppanyaki at this restaurant unless they offer us a seat at the teppanyaki counter. Suggest you do not either."
"Outstanding staff, service and food make this the best choice for families for an excellent Japanese dining experience.","The food and service go hand in hand to make a restaurant excellent, and I think Keyaki scores a solid 5/5 on both these fronts. The ambience is excellent, you feel as if you’ve stepped into a quaint Japanese village, and the service - wow! We were served by Jeff; we’ve never had a more impressionable host… He was just so good with food and wine suggestions, explaining everything to kids and us with detail and a smile on his face… the food was par excellence, with everything from presentation, temperature and taste being optimum. I would definitely look forward to revisiting and highly recommend this place to everyone"
Highly recommended for intimate weddings,"We held our wedding at Keyaki Garden Pavilion recently (solemnisation ceremony followed by an intimate sit-down multi-course Japanese fine dining meal for our 20+ guests). The food was fantastic and all our guests were happy with the quality of the food.

Prior to our wedding day, we were assisted by restaurant manager Vincent on the administrative arrangements and on the actual day, Wan and Joseph took care of our guests very well. They made all the necessary arrangements for our tea ceremony which was held after the solemnisation ceremony, so we never once had to worry about anything.

We would definitely return to Keyaki in future to try their other menu options or to celebrate any special occasion :)"
Birthday celebration,"We had been for dinners at this outlet annually to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries for the past 20 years.

Food and service was good. Its our first lunch here and lunches are soifhtly cheaper than dinner.

It was a disappointment that tofu cheesecake was unavailable in the menu.

Our server Jasper was patient and made suitable recommendations.

It was a excellent lunch!"
Lucky the garden outside looks Japanese,"Wrong timing! maybe ! the fashion for some time now : because of the Covid Virus ! NO EXCUSE FOR BAD ATMOSHERE, so so food"
Underwhelming,"I’ve been a fan of Keyaki and have visited on several occasions over the years. However, the recent dinner experience was a disappointment.

We ordered from the ala carte menu. Food tasted average and portions were tiny considering the price tag. The teppanyaki beef and seafood amongst the other dishes were cold when they were served to our table. The entire meal was so underwhelming that I didn’t border to order extra dishes even though we didn’t have our fill. The bill came up to $278 for 2A2C. The only highlight for dinner was the photo session at the Kyoto-inspired garden. We ended our dinner at McDonald’s."
Weekend Lunch set,We had the lunch set at keyaki. Paulyn was super attentive and service oriented. Enjoyed the food on a weekend brunch! Recommend!
Friends Birthday Dinner at Keyaki,"Recently visited Keyaki at a recommendation for a friend for a teppanyaki dinner.

We ordered mostly a la carte dishes as I felt the set meals had too many frills (side dishes, but if you’re looking for a all in one type meal the set meal would satisfy!), and we wanted to sample more of the teppanyaki meats and fish.

We had the tongue, wagyu beef, pork, chicken, fish, and some vegetables. The service was good and the food was excellent. Each dish was delicious and we enjoyed it very much.

Would highly recommend booking in advanced as seats at the teppanyaki table are limited. Cheers to Jerome and Eric for the service and food!"
"Great food, nice ambience","A great place with nice ambience and consistent and high food quality. Perfect for any occasions, whether it's with family, catching up with friends, or for a work lunch with colleagues and business associates."
Great experience,"Had an ROM here. Staff was very responsive, food was tasty and ambience was overall very pleasant. Would recommend for professional support and impeccable experience."
Top Japanese restaurant.,"Great experience with an 8 course menu, cooked in front of you like in many Japanese restaurants and timely served. Outstanding grilled lobster. The restaurant is located on the roof of the hotel , but you feel like you’d be in a fairly remote location."
Will definitely be back.,The service and ambience paired with the superb quality of the food truly elevated the overall dining experience to an impeccable level. What a way to spend my birthday. The omakase was a real treat! Love the food. The musk melon was soo sweet.
Amazing Service By Vincent Yaw and Team,Great Kaiseki experience at Keyaki and kudos to Vincent and team in making sure that we are well looked after. Sharing pictures of the Sashimi and Wagyu Beef as well as the sweet musk melon.
Lousy service,"First, I don’t understand why they have a toddler in a restaurant making a ruckus.
Me and 3 of my friends have ordered the $200 omakse, this is the worst omakse we ever have. Nothing is describe, just left on our table and left.
Example, one of it is a mini pot of soup. All the server said is “this is soup, squeeze the lime first and there’s ingredients inside”
Of course, I know there’s ingredients inside, but what?
What’s the difference eating in other family restaurants then, paying for premium price but unhappy experience?
Is so disappointing, standard have dropped so much!"
Sunday Evening Keiyaki Kaiseki,"Food was fresh, pacing of dishes were good and special thanks to Jeff for his hospitality! Jeff was genuinely friendly, made us feel comfortable and at ease during the dinner."
"Friendly staff, great atmosphere, beautiful garden","My 2nd visit, this time to celebrate a friend's birthday. Got him to come earlier so as to enjoy the beautiful garden and take some photos. When seated, Daryl served us. Very polite and good natured. After we had ordered, a very friendly Uncle Jeff also informed that if we have the Pan Pacific Privileges membership, ordering 2 sets of the Keyaki Kaiseki would give us 20% discount. That info was greatly appreciated. The delicious birthday slice at the end was a perfect round up for a wonderful dinner. We had a very memorable time indeed!"
"Delicious meal, good service","Nice ambience, good service and delicious food. Adopted for the keyaki kaiseki dinner. This 8 course menu was exquisitely presented and each course was a delight in itself, in terms of presentation and taste."
Amanda and team is great!,"The service by Amanda and her team is warm and attentive. They are respectful of privacy, and put in efforts to address customers by their names. And of course, the food is always above par. It’s a simple dish, but the Tamago here never fails to whet my appetite,"
Celebrating our wedding anniversary,"My beloved wife and I were at Keyaki last evening to celebrate our 47th wedding anniversary. We chose Keyaki partly because of the very good reviews other diners had given to the restaurant.

The restaurant is located on level 4 of Pan Pacific Hotel. It has a very typical Japanese ambience and environment. Al level 4 of the Hotel, we went through a nice garden with a very beautiful koi pond.

Upon taking our seat, the very attentive serving staff (Winnie) guided us through the kaiseiki menu which consisted of 8 courses featuring sashimi, soup, lobster, Wagyu beef steak and more... The selection was very good and the ingredients used were very fresh. My wife could not take raw food and Winnie suggested to substitute it with a grilled sashimi. It turned out perfect for my wife.

Overall, we had a wonderful evening with excellent quality service and food that was befitting of the special occasion. The Japanese food was very authentic and my wife said that it was certainly the best Japanese food she has had.

We are quite certain that we will come back another time for another special occasion."
Authentic Japanese in Singapore,"If you enjoy authentic Japanese food and experience, Keyaki is definitely one to consider. Exceptional designs complemented with fresh sashimis and spectacular teppanyaki dishes. Special thanks to Amanda’s for her attentiveness and bespoke services, our wine glasses were never empty!"
Great Foods Great Service,"Lovely ambience, the foods is really delicious. Excellent service, staffs were attentive, especially Elsa, Amanda and Winnie. Really make me feel like in Japan, feeling home and they know our preference very well. Excellent value food and fresh ingredients. Looking forward on my next visit. It's suited to dine with that special someone."
not vegetarian friendly and no wow factors,"what's worse than a restaurant not having a vegetarian tasting menu? one that has one but its poorly thought out, has no flavour and has no wow factors. that was unfortunately the case here.

I was shocked as course after bland course came out and they had no real Japanese twists, no spice even with the courses that said they were spicy, two soups, no rice and some very boring and tasteless vegetables, bland noodles

difficult to be hungry after 8 courses but I was

my wife on the other hand loved her 8 course pescatarian tasting although surprised also that there was no rise dish

so she'll be back just without me!"
Wedding at Keyaki Garden Pavilion,"William was extremely helpful throughout the wedding planning process. He would go above and beyond to help us with our needs and recommend suggestions that would make our big day perfect. He was so patient and willing to help. His team at Keyaki, Corine, Uncle Jeff, and Genta, were very attentive to our needs during our dinner too. 10/10 would recommend Keyaki! The food surpassed our expectations and all our guests loved every dish that was presented to them. Best wedding venue!!"
Fantastic for date night!,"Can't say enough good things about this place! Booked this for a birthday date night, and they seated us (as requested) inside by the koi pond. Restaurant interior and garden were cosy and very romantic without being too dark or stuffy.
Portions of sashimi, lobster, and wagyu beef were perfectly sized, and the small dishes are prepared with a lot of care and pride as well. Everything, down to the fruit at the end showed a lot of pride in food quality and preparation.
Services was attentive and efficient, yet unobtrusive. Would definitely book again. I'd recommend taking a leisurely stroll around the garden after dinner, before popping down to one of the Atrium pods in the lobby for a nightcap."
Birthday Celebration,"Had my birthday dinner celebration and was impressed with Vincent, Chef and his team for making the evening a Pleasant one...the lobster, fried garlic rice and beef were excellent and beautifully arranged. The slice of cake was excellent also, yummy and rich..."
Good as expected,"A large restaurant with large common seating area, private rooms, teppanyaki and sushi counters.
Good standard and traditional Japanese fair. Safe and no surprises. They have both set menu and ala carte. The set menus were very sumptuous and good value.
Services was good and attentive.
Leading to the restaurant was a very pretty and zen-like garden. Overall setting was conventional Japanese.

Hotel pricing."
Solemnization and Lunch Reception at Keyaki Garden Pavilion,"We held our Solemnization and Lunch Reception at Keyaki.
From the beginning, William has been helpful and attentive to our requirements and requests. When I was having panic moments due to pre-wedding stress, William called me to assure me everything will go well.

William and the Pan Pac staff gave us VIP treatment, and we felt well-taken care of during our pre-wedding and post-wedding stay. The staff were helpful to my cousins and 5 month old baby, so we would like to thank Pan Pac team for taking good care of us and our guests.

The staff at Pacific Martketplace were cheerful and helpful as well. The Housekeeping and ServiceOne team were also very helpful and ensured that our needs are well taken care of.

I also tried the Spa, and I had a relaxing experience with such a good therapist.

I want to thank Jeff and Genta for their excellent service during our reception :) I would also want to thank Chef Shin who crafted and prepared a special and exquisite menu for us. He was meticulous with the dishes, ensured that everything (especially the sashimi) is fresh.

Our family and guests (including ourselves) were singing praises about the food (especially the wagyu). The melon was sweet and refreshing as well.

Lastly, our red velvet cake was delicious, just the way we like it.

Thank you, Keyaki and Pan Pac team for a wonderful stay, memorable event, and culinary experience!!!"
Best teppanyaki in town with superb service,"For a group dinner or special celebration this is a great place!! Food is awesome, the quality of meats is superb and sake list is extensive! Genta the amazing manager goes out of the way to source your wine requirements on top!!! We had a great time and will surely be back!"
Not worth the hype nor the price,"This place is quite well known so I had a bit of higher expectations for it.

We did not try the sashimi because I don't eat raw fish, so we ordered all cooked items. The Miso Cod fish ($32), Teriyaki Chicken ($26) and Garlic Fried Rice ($9) were good. I also enjoyed the cold Zaru soba noodles ($26) which came with a side of tempura. We also ordered extra tempura ($33) but regretted cos even though it had a really nice batter, the prawns were overcooked & tough. The Spider Maki ($18) was a super disappointment too cos it was poorly made and falling apart when we picked them up with our chopsticks. We were contemplating on ordering desserts but decided not to cos 1 scoop of ice cream is $9 and the other option is a $28 mango + ice cream + jelly dessert. No thanks!

For a high end Japanese restaurant, the staff don't really seem to be very attentive & warm. We had to grab their attention even though the place was not really full. Also, no one came by to ask us how our meal was and are we satisfied with it (which is quite the norm for a high end restaurants right?).

The food is not bad, quite authentic. But you need to choose the right items to order. Overall for the price tag, the service is a bit lackluster and I don't think it's worth dining here if you are paying full price. So I guess you are paying for the scenery because the restaurant takes up a huge space in the hotel with a outdoor Japanese garden and Koi pond.

Good experience to try it once (only with a discount!!), but I probably won't go back again. I mean.. if you can screw up tempura and maki, then a bit fail for a Japanese restaurant right?"
Excellent Service,"Great place to pamper yourself once in awhile. The food is so so so delicious.. compliments to the chef.
The most ""memorable experience"" is from the great service from the Manager Vincent, Amanda and the team.. so friendly and professional! They are so attentive to your needs.. will definitely visit again..!

Check with them for credit card promotion (if any) when you do the dining reservation."
Ok if you get a discount.,"The hotel is lovely and the restaurant has a quaint set up. It’s nice.

The food is good but perhaps not worth the price, unless you get 25-30% off with the Discovery membership.

Beef Teppenyaki was nice - tender and good portion. Tuna maki roll was good as well. I found the grilled asparagus a bit lacking in flavour. Garlic rice was ok. Mixed grilled seafood was quite oily, lacked seasoning - this item wasn’t what we expected.

An “ok” Japanese restaurant."
Still as good as ever,We went there today because I wanted to use my Entertainer app. Last visit was easily 20 years ago. Food and service was still good. Best thing was the location. A slice of Japan in the centre of the city and during a time when we can't travel.
Enjoy the dining ambience,"Located in an idyllic Japanese garden, this Japanese restaurant offers an enjoyable dining ambience that makes one think that you are in Japan although food is average. Ask for a table by the window for a lovely view of the garden before sunset."
Wedding Dinner Reception at Keyaki Garden Pavilion,"The whole experience from the inquiry until the actual event with the Pan Pacific Wedding Banquet team was perfect and smooth. William is very professional, and he gave excellent advice, we are very pleased to have his service. Genta and his team also provided exceptional service on that night, my guests were pleased and enjoyed. The food on that night was great and fresh."
Expensive and tired menus,"Set lunches including the gozen sets have not changed a bit in the past two years. For a la carte orders, the Individual items are costly, especially the teppanyaki dishes which are smallish and ordinary. Two pathetic pan-fried prawns for more than 20 bucks?"
Don’t bother.,"Very disappointing night. If I had known better, I would have picked another place. Went there to celebrate my wife’s birthday. Suppose to be a good night out but was totally let down by how the restaurant was run..
1) 1st order, ordered the Kaiseki, told us “no lobster”but will substitute salmon fish to be replaced at the same price
2) 2nd order, ordered Hana teppanyaki multi course, similarly “no lobster” but will replace salmon fish for the same price
Totally unexpected. As it was a special occasion( and they knew that) did not want to make a farce and settled for two tiger prawns for the kaiseki instead of the lobster and changed our order from Hana to Kaze teppanyaki.
I think more could be done if the restaurant has run out of a particular main item in their set menu and to substitute for something inferior, it is poor show.
What was supposed to be a good night out was ruined by poor management who takes its customers for a ride.
On top of it, it is in Pan Pacific, a total let down to the brand and the excellent service that they provide. It is a poor reflection of their F&B. Expected more out of it. If their restaurant would only want to service a particular group of clientele, then they should just do private dining and not bother of advertising Keyaki as a top Japanese fine dining open to all..
We are not big eaters but are willing to pay for good food without being led to believe that they have a wonderful kaiseki menu. Only to be told after, that part of the items in the menu is unavailable but will be replaced with something inferior at the same price. What a big letdown ! Hope your management philosophy will tide you during this difficult period. For me, if I had known, I would have selected another restaurant. Thank you Keyaki, for spoiling for what was supposed to be a wonderful birthday celebration. And we do not need your perfunctory birthday cake...
The management of the restaurant does not understand the concept of Japanese fine dining or the name of how Keyaki is derived. Good riddance to bad rubbish !"
Setting and scene was good!,"The food taste good, though not 5/5. hence I love how the setting and ambiance made me feel good while eating. :)"
Horrible and terrible,This place costs 200 sgd per person and they have terrible service. Me and my family went for lunch and the garden was beautiful but as soon as we got in it was super hot. As we sat down we realized the chef started cooking in front of us. I asked if it was our food because we did not order yet and the waiter said it was another person's food. Why was he cooking another person's food in front of us?! It is not his fault it was the management's fault. We asked when he would cook our food and he said after 3 more groups. There was clearly another reopened grill with no one sitting there! I asked him why did you not cook there and he said they are supposed to cook in front of people when it's not even their food!! I was super unhappy and then we asked to change table and they said ok. They ushered us to another table and it was the worst table in the restaurant I am serious! We asked if we could have a different table and they said it was full. I felt like it was useless to book! We finally went to another table after a very long time. We saw how the food looked and it looked burnt and not so great. We ended up leaving. It was super hot. The service was not good. We will never go again. It is super expensive we didn't even eat anything. I am glad that I did not stay to eat.
Beautiful Resturant with great food,"Beautiful resturant, nice entrance with Japan style garden, really feel good in the place. Food was great, and could cater to various allergies."
Spectacular,"A little Japanese paradise set in the grounds of the Pan Pacific Hotel. The setting and garden set the scene for a wonderful dining experience. The ambiance, service and food is absolutely first class. Take your time here to enjoy the experience. A must on your dining list in Singapore."
Excellent Teppanyaki,Went as a family for a Teppanyaki dinner after being recommended by a friend. We ordered the lobster and beef set and were not disappointed. The food was lovely and the lobsters were taken fresh from the tank. The quality of food here is very high and the chef fried a very delicious bowl of garlic fried rice at the end. Will most certainly be back.
All good except difficulty getting service attention at teppanyaki section,"Had teppanyaki and sat at the counter. Food was good and portion adequate. Only issue I find for a high end restaurant in a 5 star hotel is the poor service level at the teppanyaki section.

There was no wait staff around to serve customer and therefore it was quite impossible to get any attention other than the busy chef that is cooking for not only you but others as well. The chilled soba was left in the kitchen with no one to serve, and by the time it was served, the cold soba already turned room temperature. Bill came only after almost 30 minutes when I asked a second time.

Would be a 5 star experience if not because of the poor service."
"Awesome Food, Nice Ambience","Went there for my wedding anniversary lunch. Awesome Food, Nice Ambience and Friendly Staff. Food of high quality for the cost involved."
Japanese Kaiseki-style Brunch,"A weekend seven courses brunch with a few selections available to suit your taste preference. Appetizer, sashimi, choices of meat, seafood and rice items. End the meal with green tea ice cream topped with azuki red bean.

Food was great, nicely presented, fresh sashimi, melty teriyaki cod and steamed pork with miso, juicy teppanyaki style chicken and fragrant garlic fried rice! All these at an affordable price of S$75++ per person. Absolutely worthy for the quality of food.

Service was prompt. Drinks were constantly refilled, never an empty cup. Staffs on duty were friendly and always smiling, creates a light-hearted dining experience.

After a hearty meal, take a walk at the newly renovated garden and be thankful for the wonderful meal."
Always return when i travel to Singapore,Love the staff and food! Look forward to visiting next time! Would love the Japanese melon being made available to all teppanyaki sets.
Great food,"Top class Japanese food. Service was excellent, we were in a hurry so they ensured we had no delays. Very good Sake selection."
Great place for a special occasion,"We celebrated our anniversary dinner at Keyaki, and we were really happy with the choice.

The place has a genuine Japanese character - the little garden around, the decor, the immaculate service. And of course the food - we were in Japan not so long ago, and Keyaki does compare to the very best we have seen over there. 

Our menu was Seasonal Omakase Kaiseki, in a pescarian version (you can ask at booking if you have special dietary requirements), and a bottle of rose champagne. The food was getting better with every dish - we especially loved the wonderfully fresh sashimi and the delicious winter onion tempura - and the lobster was just a masterpiece.

We would like to thank the Chef and all the staff for the wonderful evening we had. "
Traditional Japanese done well!,The garden is a lovely setting especially as an oasis right in the middle of the city. The food is traditional Japanese done well!
Good but not great,"Keyaki has a wonderful feel and ambience. Service was also very attentive and discreet. Ordered teppanyaki which was a speciality. Unfortunately the food was fairly average- Sirloin, garlic rice and asparagus."
AMAZING!,"My husband and I had the vegetarian degustation menu and absolutely loved it.

This restaurant is also very special from an architectural perspective. It really reminded me of the traditional houses in Takayama, and the restaurant itself is set in a small but beautiful Japanese garden.

The service was impeccable and we had a truly lovely and memorable meal here. It was not cheap but it wasn't off the charts either - we paid $200 total including wine, beer and sparkling water. Highly recommended."
High quality beef and excellent service,This restaurant features one of the best quality wagyu beef i had tasted in Singapore. It is situated in Pan Pacific hotel and easily accessible. The service is excellent and very accommodating. The environment is more of business then romantic but can be tuned a bit. The staff is willing to help you! The only complain is the seats near the garden windows had fruit flies that is a nuisance in a perfect dinner.
Must Try!,"Opted for the Omakase experience and it was worth every penny. Beside the fact that the decor right outside was stupendous (with the koi ponds and walking path with the small garden areas), service and food quality were top notch! Service was great with the attentive and pleasant staff.

The sashimi, the grilled lobster and the melon at the end really were the top three items of the night. Would definitely be back even for a casual lunch or dinner."
The Best!,"My sisters and I enjoyed a lovely 8 course brunch at this wonderful establishment. The food superb and the staff thoughtful. When they found out that this is for a birthday celebration, they gave a complimentary cake and sang a birthday song."
Superb experience,"I went to the restaurant at very short notice in the evening and got a place in the Teppanyaki part of the restaurant. My choice fell on the 7-course menu with fish. Additionally a beef fillet as intermediate course. Service, quality of the food, everything in the best way. Clear recommendation!"
First time experience in teppanyaki counter,"A very good experience chef and the performance was very excellent. The food was delicious and the service was great too.
My first tried experienced in teppanyaki counter was excellent and fall in love with it and teppanyaki food too especially the beef and foie gras.
For sure definitely will come back again.
Thank you chef Alvin."
A great dinner,"Our family of 4 were seated nicely at the Teppanyaki counter. The staff were very warm and accommodating. The chef had a steady hand and was very polite. We ordered sashimi which was cut thickly and was fresh. And so were our teppanyaki meat and seafood items. It was cooked well with a slight smokey smell that I love. I was hoping for a show from the chef which didn’t happen. So that was a bit of a minus point for me. Other than that, the restaurant is very clean and I love the ambience and the service they provide. I hope to visit again soon."
Great Kaiseki with attentive staffs,"Ordered the Hiru Kaiseki set lunch. The set presentation was great, very authentic Japanese style. I thought the food was great as well. The staffs were very friendly and attentive. The price was a bit expensive but it was an enjoyable lunch experience."
Food cannot meet the great expectation of its beautiful garden,"We were the first to arrive but food service was so slow that we spent 3hrs for dinner! We ordered Omakase and specifically mentioned the food that we were allergic to but yet they served not once but twice of those allergic food! Food was expensive but taste wise was very average. Not worth it. We were told dress code was smart causal with long pants yet we can see one diner in shorts and slippers! There was also cigarettes smell that came from outside into the restaurant. The staff were just not strict in implementing the rules set out and not fair to other patrons who adhere to it.
Maybe we were so impressed by the beautiful Japanese garden surrounding the restaurant so much so that the food simply cannot meet the great expectation."
Great Japanese Cuisine in Singapore,"Great Japanese food outside Japan, impeccable service and very immaculate ambience! Food too expensive!"
Dinner for Two,Enjoyed a lovely dinner last night. My husband had the Hoshi Teppanyaki course and I had sushi. Was very enjoyable.
"Helpful, Obliging, Professional","The restaurant Manager, Mr Yamashita and all his staff rendered incredibly good service when I held my birthday event at the Keyaki Japanese private pavilion on the 21st of April 2019. Every detail was observed and paid attention to right down to the printing of the menus, name place cards and signage. All had little cherry blossoms on them which was the theme of my event.

Mr Yamashita is conscientious, diligent and pays close attention to all the details. For this I truly appreciate and I am very thankful to him in particular and his entire team.

He and his team were very helpful indeed and obliging. When our friend who is in his eighties tripped and fell, they were very concerned. They got him a wheelchair and wanted to take him to see a doctor. Mr Yamashita even called him the next day to check on him. Thankfully it was nothing serious and my friend is perfectly fine and he mentioned how helpful Mr Yamashita was.

The chef created a very scrumptious menu and presentation was so pretty including the plates used! Everything was perfect right down to the Indian doorman who was cheerful and helpful, too. He assisted me with my party favours and all my things needed for the party which I could not have managed without him and Mr Yamashita who was waiting at the entrance of the hotel with a trolly. He loaded my things on it and pushed it to the restaurant for me.

The entire team made my event memorable and extra special as they were truly fabulous and therefore deserve mention. They really worked hard, were very polite, pleasant and delivered professionalism throughout! A big thank you to Mr Genta Yamashita and his entire team! You all made my birthday absolutely amazing!"
Becareful Keyaki thinks everyone is a cheapskate,"I think I have never written such a bad review before... not when my husband and I have been patronizing kayaki for more than 10 years! Our experience there to celebrate my son’s birthday was beyond utter disappointment!! The only thing that remained constant and awesome was the chef culinary skill.
Ushered into the teppanyaki counter by chloe@keyaki. I simply told her it’s my son’s birthday and she went on and on to tell me how she and the kitchen could do nothing for us! And she was so rude to insinuate that I didn’t tell the restaurant when I booked. I didn’t want to inform the restaurant because we already have a cake waiting for us at home. She said she will ask but she didn’t even know what I wanted. And you guessed it, she never came back...All I wanted was for them to put a candle on the fruits which is part of the gestation menu he order or to ask the chef to write happy birthday with salt on the teppanyaki grill (he did it for my birthday).
My hubby expressed our displeasure to another server about chloe@keyaki and guess what? She simply “disappeared” the whole night! No apologies... no nothing!
At the end of the night, we expressed our unhappiness again when they don’t even have a comment form/card. Only Amanda who is not even the manager was kind enough to speak to us. The manage, the only one wearing a suit I assumed, conveniently disappeared too! And with chloe@keyaki walking up and down, pretending to be busy and trying very hard to avoid the commotion.
I confronted her and “thanked her” for spoiling our night and she just pura pura bodoh (pretended so innocently) and sealed her mouth and lost her voice! Wow!Chloe@keyaki should not be RnB or hospitality, she should be a stage mime actress!
We spent $1200 and we were treated like cheapskates! We even have to pour our own sake. Keyaki should send someone to sushi ichi to learn how it is done! To treat your customers with attentiveness and most importantly respect.
Now why would I ever want to go back to keyaki again? Good restaurants turn bad and bad restaurants simply disappear!"
One of the Best Japanese Restaurant,"The foods is really nice and fresh. Excellent service, staffs were attentive, especially Amanda, Elsa, Christina, Lissie, Dolly and Sabrina. They are very kind and friendly, definitely will come back and recommend to my friends and family. Last but not least, teppanyaki dishes prepared by Chef Alvin was great."
Good Place,Like the ambience. A good place to dine with clients. Quality of the food was also good. I will come back again.
Poor for fine dining restaurant,"I had lunch at the restaurant this afternoon together with 2 other family members. It has been some years since we patronised the place. In the past both food and service were impeccable and we expect no lesser this time for a fine dining restaurant. Unfortunately today’s experience left a bad taste, not for the food itself which was still good, but for the co-ordination in the timing (or rather the lack of it ) of the delivery of our food. Our party of 3 each ordered our own separate food and the server did take a note that it was our individual orders and not sharing plates. One of our party’s order came shortly but he had to pace his eating as the our other 2 were still waiting for the food. It was a good 20minutes or more before the other 2 orders arrived. It was really a most painful experience waiting for the food whilst watching one of our party trying to eat extremely slowly so as not to be left with an empty plate when the remaining 2 diners’ orders arrive. A good restaurant should Ensure that the chef or chefs serve the food for the diners of a same table within a reasonable time span. We left the restaurant hungry as we did not want to be subjected to further waiting with any further orders of food. The wait was really unacceptable. The restaurant was not busy when we placed our orders as we were the first ones there at the Alacarte order section. It is a case of poor management/co-ordination of timing. We noticed that part of the food for another table was also subsequently ready but the servers were discreet enough to place it out of sight of the patrons who ordered them until the complete orders came out for that table. Can you imagine we had so much time to make observations whilst waiting for our food? My party are truly disappointed with such deliverance."
Best Teppanyaki restaurant of all times!,Value for money with quality ingredients! Service is top notch and the ambience sets you in real time Japan. Food has never disappointed us and we will always be back!
Worth a visit at least once,"Ambience brings one back to Japan. The food quality is good, value for money if one uses the Entertainer. I’ll definitely go back again, this time to try their teppanyaki."
Highly recommend this fantastic restaurant!,"We were friends having dinner in Keyaki, and it was the best Japanese restaurant in Singapore!
Food is nice, atmosphere is great, but the service is the best! Strat from Dolly who served our drinks with pretty smile. Christina who served professionally and also friendly made our dinner fabulous!
We also appreciated manager Vincent who was taking care of every single guest.
We really enjoyed our meal here! Thanks Keyaki!
Highly recommend to every Japanese food lover!"
Great food and the choice of A La Carte or Teppanyaki,We dined with two other friends and had wonderful dishes that were taste sensations at the Teppanyaki bar.
Great restaurant with excellent service,"This is a restaurant we love going on a regular basis.
It is located in Pan Pacific Hotel .
The moment you walk in, you already feel the « zen » attitude. There is a very nice fish pond located outdoor and they have just renovated the outdoor area making it more comfortable.
The food is good with a wide range of choices from teppanyaki to sushi.
The best part is their extreme attentive service. Tea is refilled automatically without even you noticing.
This place is very comfortable and perfect for couples or even larger crowds.
This is a restaurant I would definitely recommend as it has a very relaxing environment."
"Lovely ambience, good food and service.",Situated at the 4th level of Pan Pacific Hotel Singapore amidst a Japanese Garden. Service was good.
You must be loaded to have a kaki party at Keyaki,"Twenty years ago, Keyaki was among the better Japanese restaurants in Singapore. With increasing competition, now it’s only average in terms of food quality. There are many much better alternatives, especially in this price range. One of the few restaurants where the service is better than the food - a rarity not only in Singapore, but anywhere for that matter."
Used to be better,"It used to be a lot better a few years back, but I guess the standards have fallen while the prices rose. I highly not recommend getting the dry, tough, and cold iberico pork, given its price and miserly portions. I would also not recommend the unagi, with its even higher price point and prickly bones. Whatever Keyaki has to offer, you'd probably be able to get better and cheaper elsewhere. The garden is still beautiful, and the service is great though."
High quality japanese Menu,"Very nice restaurant with a fantastic garden and pool with Koi’s. Really inviting and you have the feeling to walk into another world.

Inside a friendly service awaits you. The interior is also inviting and a reduced Japanese style.

The food is of very high quality, professionally presented with imagination.

Traditional, clean tastes in a thoughtful menu made me enjoy the journey from marisc to fish to vegetables.

Don’t expect fancy fusion kitchen ... if you like pure japanese food you are right in this place and should try it.

The service was a bit slow but still very friendly, helpful and I enjoyed this very much."
Good Japanese food,"We ordered kesaki set which included 8 dishes . The portion was perfect but some dishes was not easily to eat .
My recommendation is order the scallops, beef and ask them for recommendation. The prawns was not so good. The dessert was good - the mochi cake !"
Almost 5 stars,"When I first gathered my thoughts to write this review, I was going to give it a 5 stars rating. Then I paused and recalled my experience in finer details and decided to go with 4 stars instead (maybe 4.5 but that's not an option).
We went for a 8 course set lunch and it started well. The restaurant is an a purpose built area a little separated from the hotel and is surrounded by a Japanese garden with a koi pond and water feature. The main dining room is large and open with a high ceiling. Staff were friendly and attentive. Food was excellent. There were minor niggles but on the whole, top notch Japanese food. The bigger issue is with the pacing. It took us close to three hours to finish the lunch and it was just too long. I understand that they want you to take your time with your food and the experience. But there were long pauses between courses. When you are situated in a hotel and most tourists are time poor, it can be an issue. The service also seems to get less attentive as the hours ticked by.
Also, while the room is basic Japanese minimalist, it is too open for a truly great ambience. You almost want a splash of colour after looking at dark wood for 3 hours.
In hindsight, my scoring is a reflection of the experience, it started off 5 stars and the little cracks appears and you start to notice the niggles more than the good and walk away with a lesser overall experience."
Excellent food & service,"It’s my first time to have dinner in KEYAKI Japanese restaurant. All the food are so delicious, especially the salmon sushi. The services are kindly. It’s the best experience in Singapore restaurant"
Good,"It’s my first time come to keyaki, the service is perfect and food is pretty nice especially the chawanmuhi and tepp beef ,and today have the pretty bartender haha so nice❤️"
"Lovely location dreadful food, so so service","The location is stunning as it is in a purpose built Japanese garden
The service started off well but tailed away to non existent.
The real problem was the food.
The salad and the amuse bouche were bland and dull, the salad dressing nil.
The sashimi was ok but miniscule portions and I mean really small, the daisy head as an embellishment was biger than the fish.
The seafood overcooked and tasteless apart from the cod. the salmon was burned.
The wagyu was just fat and had the oiliest taste I have ever ecountered, half of it left.
The fried rice was burned and had an acrid taste.
All in all a huge disappointment.

I asked them to adjust for the wagyu but they couldnt as it was a price fixe. To their credit they simply choped the entire food cost, which I didnt ask them to do or expect.

It the view appeals go, if its decent Japanese food, look elsewhere."
Still one of the top japanese restaurant after all these years,Not cheap but neither is it your usual japanese fare. Exquisite with a price to match. The nice zen garden surroundings and high level of service must count for something.
Good experience and services @Pavilion (30th Oct),"Hi Viewers, review comes in a little late.. hahaha... was busy but i really wanna complement this group of ppl.

I was hosting some C-level internal guest and customers. All of them are very happy!
Mine customers feedback that they will come back for their own lunch and dinner too.
Am really happy that they love the food in Keyaki.

I've done a few events in local and overseas hotels.
This Jap restaurant in Pan Pac is really wonderful.

E.Chef: Shinichi Nakatake san takes his food very seriously and i'm impressed! He design menus and canapes for us. WE even done a meeting for menu only. Thumbs up.
RM: Genta Yamashita And ARM: Corine Lim has done their job very professionally. Well done both! Keep it up..! (Most important, they care for their customer)

Lastly, i would like to thank William Koh too... he follows up with all my request, site visit etc and cater all the needs to my group.

Really appreciate the whole group. Your great services/job bring success to my event."
VERY NICE FOOD N SERVICE,"It’s not my first time to come keyaki,here food always very nice,and the service super perfect!!I will bring my all friend to come here!I promise"
Very nice!,"Here’s food is very nice! And all server’s attitude is very good also, it was a very good experience have dinner at keyaki,I will come back again."
Good service-food can be improved,"Went to celebrate my husband’s birthday. The iberico grilled pork was a big disappointment. Besides the very small portion, it was not tender as expected and quite tasteless. The cod fish miso on the other hand helped saved the day. It was a generous portion and perfectly cooked. Best we had! The grilled squid was initially disappointing as it was not grilled. It came with some broth. We made a complaint and the manager had it redo. It was still not chargrilled but at least it’s fresh and tender. The crew gave us a surprise by turning up with a slice of cake and singing birthday song so that made up for all the misses."
Great service,Very helpful staff and kitchen. When my chosen dish was unavailable the wait staff and kitchen created an off menu dish similar to the one I ordered. I felt very welcomed as a solo diner.
