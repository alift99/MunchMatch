Lovely dinner at La Brasserie,"I had a birthday celebration with a friend at La Brasserie on the evening of November 3. As always, I had a wonderful evening and my friend and I had such a good time that it was probably one of the best birthday celebrations we had at a beautiful restaurant with an welcoming and charming ambience!

The service staff were very attentive and friendly especially Jessica who made us felt very welcomed and gave us an amazing experience that night.

I will definitely love to come back again and again and when I think about celebrations, La Brasserie will always be on the top of my list and it never disappoints. From the ambience to the food and service, everything is outstanding! ❤️

La Brasserie is no doubt my favourite French restaurant in Singapore! Love the ambience so much and the service is always excellent! Highly recommend!l and I will definitely be a lifetime customer!"
Amazing Hospitality,"Attended a wine dinner here at La Brasserie and was served by Alan and his team. Ambience and food were great, but I would like to emphasise on the great service and attention to detail from Alan, he ensured that the whole dinner was executed smoothly - the wines were paired well with the food (one of the best duck confit ever), we did not have to wait long between each course, and Alan always made sure our glasses were filled. The team was really friendly and attentive too - not just me, but other reviews have said it too! Great place to have a special meal :)"
Great dinner,"The food was excellent, waiter however is not easy to call. Also entering the front desk was quite chaotic. The ambiance was really cozy!"
Birthday Dinner,"Restaurant ambience is elegant and fancy. Food is served promptly.

The service staff are friendly and attentive! Staff make great recommendations on the food! Lobster roll, duck confit and chocolate dome are delicious! Presentation of the chocolate dome is amazing too!

In addition, another staff Mr Mag - He is helpful and made us feel welcomed. He truly cares about our experience there - checking on us and ask if we need anything else. He also offered us a complimentary cake after knowing it’s my birthday. He made the dining experience more personal!

Overall, a super pleasant experience! Highly recommended!"
A Classic Bistro in the heart of Singapore,"Fullerton Bay Hotel, La Brasserie!

A Bistro Lunch!

Classical Fare which mostly worked out! Steak Tartar decent! Onion soup great taste but Gratinated only with croutons!

Beef cheeks perfect, the Duck Leg Confit dry , sad actually! Hamburger excellent! I always ask for: NO TRUFFLE FRIES, never understood the obsession with locals on Truffle oil, personally I find the artificial flavours nauseating, but I guess each their own!

Red wine absolutely yummy! For a young wine it’s super drinkable! Highly recommended!

Love coming to this place the view alone onto Marina Bay Sands from the terrace is simple great!

Remarkable Experience,"made a reservation for our anniversary at this restaurant, first time here with my partner but we were both overwhelmed by their great service!

food was excellent, especially their beef cheeks, both of us love it alot.

great place with nice ambience for any occasion i would say :)"
Dinner at La Brasserie,"Service is superb. I had a starter wine Moscato which is really refreshing and I really enjoyed the dessert chocolate dome which is nicely presented. The waiters and waitress served us welll, giving good introduction of thr food. I had a wonderful night with my husband celebrating my birthday. Highly recommended for couples."
Food and service were fantastic!,"Went there for birthday celebrations. Ordered beef, onion soup, duck, lobster roll, chocolate dessert. We enjoyed our evening tremendously. Special shout out to JJ for being so attentive and pleasant. Will definitely visit again!"
Business Lunch,Service could be better. Great ambience. Food is above average. Overall a good lunch i must say. Will definitely come back again. Next round will be dinner!
Best breakfast food,Love having breakfast here because the food is so good. We usually do a room service breakfast but we take exception to La Brasserie.
Great food but service not fully up to expectations,"Food was great. But somehow the service was lacking. This was our 2nd time at La Brasserie and the first round was amazing, but this time we were disappointed.

Firstly they left out our booking on chope, so we did not have a window seat/quiet table as requested. They actually had more than enough window seats throughout the night.

It took us a long time to order and get attention of the staff (was not looking at our table even if walking past and we were waving furiously). The foreign couple who came just after us got immediate attention and menu explanations.

Then, a waiter asked if we wanted more bread, and went to get it but it never came in the end, seems they forgot.

Then they asked if we were sharing the food - we said yes, however they still gave us the wrong knives and assumed 1 main separately. It also took 3 tries for them to refill our sparkling water.

Finally when calling for the bill, they forgot again and we were waiting so long for the bill. We had to ask for the bill again.

Not sure what was the reason for this level of service - our bill for 2 pax was over $300 and we were a hotel guest, but seems some basic level of service was lacking. Ended up quite disappointed compared to the first round."
Amazing dinner,Celebrated my friend’s birthday there. It was just the two of us and we enjoyed every dish we ordered. Beef tartare was excellent. We were able to share the soup as well! We loved our visit there! Friendly staff prepared a cake for my friend as well! thank you!
Loved It,"Pretty darn good French food. I would love to see a few more items on the menu, but the beef cheeks was outstanding. Pair that up with a nice red, and you have yourself a delectable meal."
Almost empty and still tried to enforce a dress code!,"Almost empty and still tried to enforce a dress code!

I have been to brunches all over Singapore and always worn shorts, even at the poshest restaurants, because it's brunch! It's not a formal dinner, it's a relaxing brunch.

As I also wasn't told about the dress code when booking I turned up in shorts, (I do live in a tropical island!) and despite my guest already being seated was made to discuss the dress code with the receptionsist for a good 5 minutes.

I was on the point of leaving as I live in Sentosa I could hardly just pop home and change when she relented and gave me a man's skirt. She was going to make me wear it and I said no, so she then said that I could put it over my legs and pretend that I was!

What a farce.

I wondered even more what the fuss was about when I entered the restaurant to see that it was mostly empty.

So who exactly is going to be offended?

Also I notitced that there were women there with, yes you've guessed it, shorts and skirts on!

Huh?

So it's ok for women to wear shorts and skirts but not men?

Makes no sense.

So I was getting funny looks from the staff all afternoon.

The brunch itself was fine, nice enough food and champagne with gins.

But why the hassle at the start when there was virtually no one there?"
Family dining - Wedding Anniversary,"Food, ambiance, service… all good. Excellent service, unique dishes, quantity was just enough. Price range was just nice."
Compliments of the season for Chloe,Throughly enjoy our time here in La Brasserie. The service was splendid and meticulous. We would like specially mention Chloe for her excellent service throughout. Food was scrumptious too. Thank you.
Great Food & Wine Selection,"Decided to go to La Brasserie with a French friend. The ambience is very nice, you are greeted with a warm welcome. The food was incredible and having just returned from Portugal we decided to pair our dish with their Portuguese wines! The 2 bottles we had were just amazing and paired wonderfully with their Tenderloin Steak!"
Terrible,"The pasta was undercooked and the duck confit which was supposed to be their best seller was extremely dry. Prices werent not cheap too so the food was really unacceptable. We did inform the service staff about the food standards and they said they would talk to the chef, but nothing was done after."
Very recommended,"Hi there, I would like to compliment your staff Abdellah from La Brasserie from your hotel. Very very good service Good employee Good language Good smile Perfect Mr NG TECK SON SARAH ONG"
Chinese Food so so,We ordered Chicken Rice and Bak Ku Teh. Both rice was very hard like no enough water. The pork ribs were very hard also. Overall the Chinese food is worse than Hawkers food and charge and high price. Really pay for the atmosphere.
Disappointed,"We recently visited the Fullerton Bay Hotel for High Tea, whilst the food was nice, the server “Daniel” was absolutely terrible, his attitude and mannerisms need’s questioning (throwing items on table, rude, lack of service, etc) it seems Daniel needs to be trained in service, particularly disappointing for the price your paying for the experience"
Disappointing,"Overpriced food and drink , 88$ for 2 lamb chops , service ok but nothing more. Atmosphere ok and clean."
Outstanding - for the Win,"We had a wonderful evening here a few weeks back. 5 girls, many drinks, and a waiter called 'Win'. Honestly we had delicious food, excellent service, staff who like to joke and keep us laughing and an atmosphere of sophistication. The drinks menu was creatively named, I want 'cove-it', this was very funny. Truly left an imprint in our minds and hearts and can happily say we will be back!"
nice ambience but so so food,"nice ambience, staff was professional. but food was sub par. nothing fantastic. would not consider for visit again."
Festive Lunch,Love visiting Fullerton for a meal or high tea as the ambience is nice and excellent service always. Both fullerton and fullerton bay my favourite hot spot to relex for a meal. The food was delicious too.
Lunch,"Had lunch with my friend at La Brasserie. Overall is good. Food is nice, service is excellent. Will go again."
Excellent duck confit,"We visited on 8 November, 2021, and the duck confit was delicious. The skin was crispy and the meat was tender, a great combination. Would recommend this dish"
One of the best!,"Charming interiors with floor to ceiling glass windows that overlooks the bay area. A lovely setting for a romantic evening dinner!

We ordered the Wagyu Burger and Steak Frites with wine pairings. The food is sublime and the service is top notch. Kumar really looked after us so well!

Looking forward to be back again."
"Great service, great food, great atmosphere",Service was absolutely top notch. Alan was very attentive to us throughout and recommended us the options which were suitable for our palate. Food was great but I felt that the service is what will make me come back again. Kudos to Alan for making this such a wonderful night.
Daniel Lee was Amazing!!,"It was an amazing ambiance for a special day to celebrate. We was assisted by Mr Daniel Lee. He was very attentive and he recommend few foods while we ordered some drinks. Overall, we have enjoyed our dinner and kuddos for the team."
"Thank you, Kumar and Daniel","Went to la brasserie for birthday celebration. Not to mention about food quality, i would like to compliment its service. The service that we got was a top notch. Thank you, Kumar and Daniel. They are so friendly and professional and You guys made my special day wonderful.
I will visit again, see you soon"
Enjoyable Birthday Lunch,My friend and I had a wonderful dining experience. Thank you to Win for being hospitable and to Michelle who assisted us with the booking to Lantern. Great wine recommendation too! We’ll be back!
"Mediocre food, overrated duck confit, excellent service",Tried the duck confit based on most of the good reviews. The dish turned out to be really dry and not better from a duck confit that I had at half the price. The attentive staff was the saving grace for the night.
Great service for unannounced bday celebration,My wife and kids enjoyed the meal with one of the nicest staff and this is brings a refresh memorable time during covid period. Even we did not inform its a bday celebration the staff followed up to find out our reason for visit and on spot provided a nice cake.
"Over-rated food and drinks, poor value but lovely ambience and service","The trip to La Brasserie was meant to be a memorable anniversary dinner but the quality of the food and drinks was just meh~. The saving grace of the dinner was that the service quality.

Service
The service was tip-topped for us. This was expected and delivered. Hats off to the staff from the Host all the way to the ground staff.

Atmosphere
Beautiful interior, lovely ambience. The place had an ancient castle feel, the ceilings were tall, and the decoration in placed is spot on. Maybe the air conditioning could be turned up a little as the place felt a little stuffy.

Food and drinks
2 Classic Mojito
1 COVE-IT
1 Seafood Royale for 2 Pax
1 Prawn Caesar Salad
1 Sea Bass Fillet
1 Chocolate Dome

Total bill $277.35

Drinks, 90% of the drinks were just ice, leaving the drink diluted after the ice have melted.

Seafood Royal for 2. There was half 1 lobster, 1 crab leg, 1 scallop, 1 tuna sashimi, 1 octopus and 2 prawn. For $88++ for 2 pax, this dish just seems so underwhelming. Firstly, the quality of the ingredients that were used just isn’t that great. The seafood taste in the lobster, prawn, crab and octopus just could not be located. The tuna was substandard at best, for which prime supermarket quality could easily beat. The scallop was decent.

I just do not understand how 2 pax is supposed to share the miserable portion that was provided. If this is the portioning for 2 pax, what is the portioning for 1 pax? How do I share this tiny piece of scallop with my other half?

For the price of $88 for 2 pax, the portioning was just insufficient, combined with the exorbitant price and poor quality was just too much for us.

The prawn Caesar salad had 6 prawn and Caesar salad. The prawns that were served were overcooked with uneven torched marks. The egg was spot on in terms of rawness. Croutons were hard.

The Sea Bass fillet was just miserably tiny. The texture was rubbery, and the taste lack lustre. The whole dish was just a disappointment, and the Sea Bass isn’t an expensive fish to start with.

The chocolate dome scored perfect marks for aesthetic. The pairing of the chocolate and fruits were nicely done. The whole dish just screams beauty, and the taste is decent.

Final notes
I booked the place on the 15 August 2021, almost 3 weeks prior to the actual dinner. The anticipation that built up just to be led down by the quality of the food and drinks. I am also surprised by the number of good reviews as the food is mediocre at best (aside from the Chocolate Dome dessert). The prices charged were steeped and I expected a whole lot more from both the quality and portion. My other half was also vastly disappointed.

The copy of the receipt was attached as a proof of visit."
Good Food and Good Service,"Absolutely great service from the restaurant, especially from Mr. Win who went to great lengths to ensure that the food was free from garlic and onion for the vegetarian guest. Will be back soon for full French meal."
Always a pleasure to dine here,Had the wagyu burger and the duck confit. Very tasty. Excellent service. Have been frequenting for a couple of years
Excellent “entertaining” service,"We wanted to treat friends for their wedding anniversary in town…somewhere we have all not been to but has lovely ambience. We enjoyed our dining thanks to Kumar, our waiter, whose humour made the evening delightful as he interacted with us each time he brought our dishes etc. He even involved Daniel, a staff, in the photo taking and it was just delightful.

The Steak Frites we had was truly delicious as was the Sea Bass. However, while the other 2 were artistically presented, they were not as outstanding. Nevertheless we enjoyed our evening for the exceptional service."
Not just a meal: a piece of art,"We enjoyed a wonderful dinner prepared by Chef Paolo. All the dishes were exquisite: full of flavors and spices, fresh and perfectly cooked ingredients all composed in a very balanced mix. And some innovative discovery with the delicately cooked sea bass served with a chorizo butter. Un régal ! Thank you chef Paolo"
Service Drinks Food,"Hey Kumar everybody is writing about you, I thought I will add on. You are a credit to your profession and I feel so at home here because of your thoughtfulness. Your recommendations on wine were spot on and your obvious care of your customers excellent. The chefs in the kitchen are doing a marvellous job too, our simple dishes of salad and octopus had an earthy fragance that delighted the taste buds. It was late and we just wanted something light and these were perfect. Will have to come back for the mains another day and leave plenty of space in the stomache."
An awesome dining experience! 100!,"La Brasserie takes the cake for an awesome dining experience. From the moment you step in, to the time you settle your check.

Kumar and Chloe took care of my wife and I immaculately. Their service was prompt, attentive, and always ready to assist. I’m pretty sure, behind the mask, was definitely a genuine smile to along.

The food, naturally takes the credit for this amazing establishment, the seafood royale and the charcuterie board were truly incredible. The seafood was so fresh and servings are generous either. For mains, wife and I shared the cote de boeuf, a beautiful 500g ribeye, butter basted on the bone. Kumar took the initiative to have the ribeye, carved and portioned onto 2 separate plates, complete with mashed potatoes and sauces. The ribeye was amazing, and call me dramatic, but it definitely made me tear.

La Brasserie has impressed on my first visit and I definitely look forward to return, to be under the care of Kumar and Chloe once again.

Brilliant."
La Brasserie Dine In,"Awesome service by Kumar and his team.
Food is great - the traditional onion soup is very thick, wild mushroom risotto is very filling and flavorful.
Had the Inaya 68% Chocolate Dome for dessert, the dehydrated raspberries and the compote complements the chocolate very well.

Service: 5/5
Food: 4.5/5"
Great evening at La Brasserie,The ambience is good and I like the food presentation. Special thanks to Min for helping to replace one of the bubbles as the previous bottle was opened quite some time.
Stellar service,"Beautiful high ceilings, and natural light streaming in from tall windows, and elegant interiors.
Decent food (the beef cheek is sublime) and wine list.

The highlight though, was the waiter, Kumar.
This was our second time back (my third), and while this is an excellent establishment, we really came back for Kumar He #keepsitreal, and pre-empted our every need. He goes out of his way to make sure you're comfortable, and is attentive without being obsequious.
All in all, a very lovely evening."
Wonderful birthday celebrations,"A beautiful night out for my birthday celebration at La Brasserie. Such a lovely restaurant with a relaxing ambience n amazing view of the river. A sweet surprise planned by my gf with a 4 course set meal paired with 3 types of wine. The food was delicious, the yummy escargots, the tender beef cheek n tasty sea bass. A sweet end with a variety of chocolate dessert n birthday cake! Attentive service by the wonderful staff, including Alan, Lotha n Minh. Definitely a highly recommended place for special occasion!"
Pampered meal.,"We were dining as a group of 4 pax and had ordered 4 different mains to share and try. Our server Kumar, was so took the initiative to pace out our dishes so that the table is not overcrowded and even portioned out all the food so that it was easy for all of us to get a bite of each dish. Food was excellent, ambience was warm yet luxurious, service was personable and unforgettable. Will definitely come back again."
What a lovely experience!,"Both my husband and I truly enjoyed the dishes and services at La Brasserie. Our waiter Kumar was attentive and humorous. With a bottle of the New Zealand's Sauvignon Blanc, from the starter salad, soups, escargots, then the main dishes of fresh seabass and succulent tender duck, to the superb dessert of Le Apple, we thoroughly enjoyed them and were very satisfied. One exception was the creme brulee which we both felt was too sweet. I would recommend this place to everyone!"
Good food with poor service,"Went on a Friday night for to celebrate my partner's birthday. Arrived at restaurant 30min late as we mistook the timing. Front of house was nice enough to make space for us.
However, when we were seated it seemed like the waiters were short staffed.
Two disappointing incidents were 1. Ordered deserted at the same time as the Main so that it will be served timely when the main is done. But it did not arrive timely, we were very much done with our meals (my partner was done with his dessert as well) and we finally told the waitress if my dessert order was forgotten, please cancel. In less than 2 minutes my dessert arrived. It was disappointing & it was already 10.30pm.
Second incident was when we requested for more sauce for the steak, the waitress took note but never came back. We noticed her phasing around playing with kids at another table. And when we got her attention again we gently reminded her of our sauce which finally came.

I am not sure if we went on a bad day where the restaurant was really understaffed.
Really disappointed by the staffs BUT the food was pretty awesome."
Easter Brunch,"Great menu served to perfection by Cristina and Alan. The desserts were fantastic. We found the medium rare beef to be more on the ‘medium’ side. Overall, the service made it a memorable outing for us. The staff wasn’t overwhelmed and was very attentive"
"Here again, 5 star for the service","Back here for the 2nd time, celebrated my brother’s birthday. Tried their Lobster a L’américaine and really love it. Also, the crew had also prepare a complimentary cake for our mini celebration. Kudos to the team."
Nice venue with 'okay food',"This was our first dinner at this venue in years. We loved the decor and overall atmosphere of the restaurant. The service was rather lacklustre and slow as we often did not see any wait staff around at all.
We ordered steak & frites, lobster roll with fries and a mushroom risotto. The risotto was very watery and overcooked, the steak and lobster roll were good but the fries were cold. We believe the risotto was probably sitting around the kitchen for a while and so were the fries. Overall we'd expect more from such a nice restaurant in one of the towns top hotels in this price range, both the service and quality of food have room for improvement."
Restaurant Week Dinner,First time visiting the restaurant. The restaurant week dinner set is worth the money and the food quality is high. Good service of the waiter Kumar :)
Dinner,Extremely disappointing Food over priced and the fish was inedible The staff tried their best to make up for the mediocrity
Memorable Armagnac,"I had the French Onion Soup for a starter, the Tooth fish and Lobster main and the Baron Gaston Le Grand Armagnac 1990. Everything was good but the Armagnac was memorable."
Disappointing service,"Disappointing service at La Brasserie - Our booking was at 6.30pm. The restaurant was relatively empty when we sat down but NO ONE came to offer us drinks and take our orders. We had much trouble getting our staff's attention, at that time when it was fairly empty. When the restaurant started to get crowded, all the staff just walked past busily without even taking a look at whether guests needed their attention. It was super understaffed and not attentive - certainly falling short of what a 5star hotel ought to be providing.

A fairly tall Chinese Male waiter (Alan/ Eric) was serving our table and he did not smile at all. Very bad service from him, and very unproactive.

Food is very normal, nothing worth mentioning. Duck was very tough.
Never gonna return to Fullerton Bay dining."
Wonderful dinner with great service and good food.,Was there to celebrate my wife's birthday and the service staff was really wonderful. Gave great recommendations and even helped us to separate our food since we were sharing our food. The ambience was great with an even wonderful view. Will definitely recommend for the couple's night out.
Weekday dinner,"We had our dinner during weekday, started with escargot which is a good choice, fremantle octopus it has balance of flavour together with the chorizo.
Followed by beef cheek very tender and soft, for the risotto I will give it pass.
I think it is quiet busy during that night cause we had to wait for an hour for our dessert and when it got to our table it was a different from what we ordered.
But I think the staff handled it quiet well, they are very apologetic and did not charge us for that.
For the service they are very accommodating and helpful, but I think during that night they are quiet overwhelmed with the customer."
Good service and good food,"We came here to have our anniversary dinner. Ambiance was quiet, calm and romantic, at the same time, welcoming. It is good for both couple visit and group visit. They separate couples and group so you could get some romantic time if you want so. There are quite many people although it was a weekday night. The food was delicious. We had seafood platter, beef cheek, duck confit, everything is good. We are too full for dessert. Still, Kumar was very kind to serve us a complimentary pineapple tart to end our dinner beautifully. Very friendly and kind service from Kumar. I love the seafood platter that he suggested
All in all, it was a wonderful experience. We will visit it again!"
Superb service and great atmosphere for romantic dinners. Thank you to Idrus and Ida,"We came here to celebrate a belated birthday dinner. Ambiance was quiet, calm and romantic. There wasn't much people on a weeknight so it was great. The food was also delicious. As for the duck confit, it was slightly salty for us but the duck was very tender.

As for the service, we were really attended to. Idrus was very attentive and great at making suggestions. Even offered me to taste different wines to see which I prefer. At the end, he asked if we were celebrating anything and soon later he came and served a complementary cake. I really appreciated his hospitality

All in all, it was a wonderful experience."
Excellent Service,"A bit of a belated review as my friend and I ate there in December 2020 during a staycation at Fullerton.

Initially, we were planning to order the Epicurean Dinner by The Bay menu. What we were unaware of was that we had to purchase either vouchers or pre-order this menu and that we were unable to just order it at the get-go. Unfortunately, the Fullerton website was down that very night and we were unable to purchase the voucher directly from the website, leaving us at our wits ends.

Regardless, Mangesh, who was attending to us, was very polite and accommodating, even going out of his way to check with his supervisors on how he could resolve our little problem (which took quite a bit of to and fro while we were struggling with the website). We managed to resolve the issue and sat back to relax and enjoy a fantastic dinner.

Throughout the courses, Mangesh constantly stopped by our table to check on us and offer us wine recommendations to go with our food, making us feel as if we were having dinner with a great friend. Along with Hanna and Sunny, the team managed to make our night, which started off quite stressful, into a memorable one with their patience, kindness and hospitality.

As someone who works in the hospitality industry, I am completely sympathetic to service staff and absolutely appreciate the effort that they take to go above and beyond the call of duty. Mangesh could have simply told us that the restaurant was unable to accommodate and left it at that, yet he went above and beyond by trying to find a way so that we still could enjoy the dinner we set out on enjoying, showing an exemplary example of what service should be like at a premier establishment.

In ending, La Brasserie not only boasts a great selection of food, but their greatest asset is their staff, who go above and beyond in making every guest that dine with them feel comfortable and welcome. Kudos to Mangesh, Sunny, Hanna and the team at La Brasserie!"
Thanks for excellent service to Charisma and Daniel,"Recently we discovered this beautiful French restaurant and fell in love with it. In the large part because of great customer experience provided by staff and their unbelievable attention to details in the service. I was surprised when visiting for the second time they were able to remember not only us, but small details of our previous dinning ... As a former hospitality employee I do appreciate the effort and can see the hight quality standards that had put at place... and more importantly that those standards are delivered by employees with a Passion! Thanks to Charisma and Daniel we were able to feel as a “special guests” and our request to customise a dish from the menu (pink sauce ;)) was executed perfectly. I do cherish their enthusiasm amid Covid-19 to serve customers at their best and hope you guys will get more and more “customers for life”
I strongly believe these interpersonal qualities it what it takes the outlet to stand out from competition.
Thanks a lot ... and see you soon ;)"
Love the La Brasserie restaurant,"I had a farewell dinner for a colleague at La Brasserie on Saturday, 30 January and we were really pleased with our meal and the service provided. The ambience was lovely and the Wild Mushroom Risotto I I ordered was so delicious!

The server, Emma was very friendly, attentive, efficient and could even remember she had attended to me last month when I had high tea at The Landing Point! Once again, she made me feel very welcome!

Can’t wait to return and will definitely be happy to recommend La Brasserie to anyone looking for a lovely restaurant with great ambience and good food. Love this place and will continue to visit"
Wonderful Sunday Brunch!,"A group of 6 of us enjoyed Sunday brunch this weekend and the food, service and staff were outstanding. We really enjoyed the variety of options especially as the servings were not too large, meaning we could eat a lot more! Standouts were the ribeye, pork belly, seafood plate and laksa. One of our friends was also pregnant and they were able to accommodate all of our requests and even had alcohol free champagne!
I also wanted to call out our waiter - Alan Lee. He did an incredible job of ensuring our food arrived on time, our drinks were topped up and that he explained the various options available. One of the reasons we keep coming back to the Fullerton Bay is because of the service and Alan is a great example of how one person can make a brunch from great to outstanding! Thank you Alan for looking after us. Maria"
Amazing food and Excellent Service,"The 3-course meal is a carefully curated menu with each course being more delicious than the last. Alan, Sunny and Lotha provided excellent service and Alan was extremely thoughtful to suggest a digestif of Armagnac at the end of dinner, my dinner went down well and definitely helped with a good night's rest. Would highly recommend!"
Dad’s 70th Birthday,"Awesome place for dinner. Lovely ambience with some amazing food. The pavilion just outside the restaurant makes for a lovely family stroll after dinner.

It’s elegant setting coupled with the warm natured staff, means you get the best of both worlds - casual and fine dining.

Special mentions go to Ida, Sunny, Leah and Alan."
Great place for dinner,"Went there for our anniversary dinner. Staff are friendly , recommending what's for dinner and also service. Special mentioned to Lotha, Mavie and Ida on their warm service"
Slightly Below average,"The onion soup tastes like consommé more than onion, the escargots were average, the lobster pasta was very good though. The chocolate mousse is very good by itself but ruined by the ice cream and the jam. The service was ok, but nothing extraordinary. We wanted to have a digestive and the waiter didn’t know what they had. No chartreuse available which was weird for a French restaurant. The wine was good but overpriced. The place is not taking advantage of its situation, the atmosphere is nice, but the view would be magnificent if it had the right orientation"
Nice,Thanks. Very nice and very formal dining location. I & my friends liked it. Sure we'll come again next time.
Superb Brasserie,"Was there for Christmas brunch.. Place was full but staff were still great, efficient, friendly, polite, The food was really tasty with the exception of the western style vegetables, which were bland. The ham course was presented very well. However, the complimentary noddle starter, the fish course, the turkey ball & dessert & cheeses were fab. Worth the $$$ given all the free flow of champagne."
Nice food and ambiance,Food is sufficient for a 5-course menu. I like their escargo and champignon truffle soup. Nice ambiance and good service as well. Highly recommended!
Superb brunch in every way,"The location overlooking Marina Bay is the first thing one notices with the huge windows positioned for all to enjoy the spectacular outlook. The December Christmas brunch menu was wonderfully crafted with a mix of French, traditional festive dishes and local flavours. Something for everyone. We enjoyed the bottomless champagne option and my husband worked his way through the Bloody Mary menu as well. Service was attentive and quiet without being obtrusive. While there we booked to return with friends for brunch in the new year. An excellent way to spend a Sunday!"
Was here to celebrate our,Was here to celebrate our anniversary. We meet Mr.Benedict around the fullerton hotel (staff) and he suggest us about this restaurant and he willing to accompanied us to bring us over to the restaurent. Even he suggest us the best food and chef special. Those staff wished us and provided us a complimentary anniversary cake. Such a delightful experience. Thank you for Mr Benedict and to the other staff.

Excellent date night venue,"Tried out their Restaurant Week special set. Can never resist warm, crispy, soft bread, and the special duck spread that came with the bread.

First course: Escargots / Spinach Salad
Second course: Champignon & Truffle Soup
Third course: Grilled Seabass / Braised Beef Cheeks
Fourth course: Chocolate Mousse with Vanilla Ice Cream

The salad was surprisingly better than the Escargots. Very refreshing and appetising dressing.

Mushroom soup was normal; decent, but no wow-factor.

The fish was excellent, crispy grilled skin yet the fish didn't dry out. Braised Beef Cheeks were a little disappointing though, it was not melt-in-the-mouth-tender enough.

The chocolate mousse was the perfect wrap up for the meal. Am also grateful for the complimentary slice of cake with a candle as requested, as we celebrate my friend's birthday.

Overall, reasonably priced and extremely enjoyable from ambience to service. Lovely view too if you've got a seat by the full floor-to-ceiling glass windows."
Wonderful evening at La Brasserie,"We were so pleased to experience the charming ambiance & service at the restaurant. Our waitress, Ida, was first class in her attention to us. Food was good, as always."
Nice restaurant,"We were there for our anniversary dinner. The service was great, the staff were very polite, friendly and commendable. We ordered the baked sea bass and Caesar salad which was nice and done well. But the escargot was a bit tough. The lobster roll was not how I used to have it. I found the lobster under cooked, actually a little raw. Did not like it. But what lacked in the food was well made up for by your staff. Well done. We enjoyed our dinner regardless. Thank you."
The food wasn’t as good as before,"I was terribly disappointed with my last visit at La Brasserie over the weekend. I visited this place a few times prior to covid but the quality of food dropped significantly over the past months. I had the free flow champagne buffet while my friend has the non-alcohol brunch. The escargot and pork belly were tough and dry, the seafood (ocean catch) was not fresh and even the desserts were not worthwhile. My friend didn’t enjoy the sea bass and wagyu beef slices she ordered too. She had bacon in one of her sides and even that was done badly. I felt disappointed cause it was my friend’s bday celebration and I would’ve wanted her to enjoy her first experience in La Bras, especially since I was raving about it to her.

Not sure if they were scrimping because of covid or the quality of the food is just not as good as before. And even the menu is not as extensive. Since there’s no ‘open’ buffet concept due to covid, I would’ve expected the a la carte menu to compensate for it.

To be fair, Cristina and Ida gave us excellent service and they were very attentive but other than that, there’s nothing worthwhile or remarkable considering the price we pay is comparable to other high end champagne brunch buffets in the island."
Dinner by the Bay,"Wagyu Beef, seasoning is to perfection.

Duck Confit, it may look dry but its soft and juicy inside my wife & I enjoyed much.

5 star for ambience
5 star for service

Thanks, Jean and team who gave us a personalised hand written card including our printed photo (within) to congratulate our wedding anniversary

Will definitely coming to try out the Lobster a L’américaine with my wife."
Amazing Dining,"Amazing dining experience at La Brasserie. The ambience and the food are amazing, especially their steak. Sunny and Ida were always attentive and did a great job during our dining. Will definitely return"
La brasserie superbe!,"Restaurant is beautiful with amazing food. Our waitresses Chat Yin and Ida were great.

Food was excellent, refined french dishes with great touches. The lamb was particularly good and don't miss the onion soup!"
Beautiful restaurant,"I was very excited to try out this restaurant as it was recommended by a friend. I checked the review and it was great. We went as a group of friends.

I was impressed with the deco. It was truly classy restaurant.

Service was good. The servicing staffs were very attentive.

We ordered Escargot which was amazing, onion soup was good. Main were Lamb cutlets which were disappointingly under cooked, fish was ok and bland, steaks were ok. For dessert, we had cream brûlée which were disappointing.

Overall experience was ok for the price we paid."
Weekend Champagne Brunch Birthday Celebration,"Great service. The staff were very attentive and accommodating. Service is very good, food is delicious and the free flow champagne brunch is one of the best in Singapore. They even provided a nice personalized birthday cake for the celebrant. We will definitely come back!"
Love their High Tea,"First time there for their High tea. From my dining experience, this restaurant provided free flow of their pastries, unlike other hotel high tea which left us a good impression of their services. Their decoration was nice and have a great view of the whole downtown. Their tea and coffee selection was good and able to try them all. Excellent services to Asel, Germa and Daniel!"
Very good but missing something special,"The restaurant is very good, the food, the service were all very good, but when you're paying $600 for 4 people (including only 2 glasses of wine) you do expect something special and this restaurant lacks something special. We had higher hopes and I think it started with a much reduced menu. Desserts were fine, but not wow. I doubt we'll be back as there are better places at this price level, thanks."
Fantastic dinner out.,Fantastic dinner out. Duck confit and Steak frites cooked to perfection. Great wine options by the glass. Service from Alan really made the evening. He took our photo for our anniversary and printed it into a card as a keep sake. Thank you so much Alan!
Birthday Celebration,"Had my birthday celebration arranged by my wife. The food and service is great.

Enjoy the food and celebration there."
Menu changes,"Was disappointed that they changed the menu to something more simplified. La Brasserie was our favorite restaurant. We visited the restaurant three times a year for already 4 years. So this time, after reviewing the menu, we chose to walk out. Hopefully the menu change back and definitely we will be back. The staff are always very welcoming. Very good service always."
Birthday celebration,The wagyu burger is huge and the steak is nice. Good service by Daniel and colleagues. Thanks for giving us a memorable birthday celebration!
Dining at La Brasserie,"The food was very good. What stood out for me was the service personally. From the start to the end, the staff never failed to make my family and I feel comfortable. Special thanks to Germa and Femie for serving us and making our dining experience a pleasant and wonderful one."
Champagne brunch @ La Brasserie,"Brunch at La Brasserie was a nice experience, but unfortunately not as delicious than it was three years ago. I wondered if it was because of Corona. There was not as good selection of food available than three years ago. But now you could order some food to the table, for example very good satays. I recommend this place especially for groups of adults. Service was very good again."
Fabulous dinner at La Brasserie,"Fabulous dinner at La Brasserie on a friday night! Food was perfect, we ordered the fillet mignon and wagyu steak, service by Tanesh was excellent. Would totally come back again in a heartbeat!"
Good experience,"Good wine and excellent food as usual. Will go back, virus or not. Hopefully the situation gets better and more ppl dine out"
Great dining experience,"The atmosphere was quiet and cozy despite on a Friday evening. So we had great services from the crews, special thanks to Kumar who gave good recommendations on the food. A very sweet thought to divide the portion for sharing purpose!
The lobster pasta is my favourite and beef is great too, definitely will go back to try other dishes soon!"
Birthday dinner for my girlfriend,"Went to this restaurant for an advanced celebration. The ambience was perfect, great for both couples and families. We were served by waitress Tashe, who made sure to refill our glasses timely and checked in on us to ensure we were enjoying ourselves. She was great at holding a conversation and made my girlfriend feel like a princess with a slice of birthday cake, creme brûlée and cappucino. The food was delicious, highly recommend the starters such as french onion soup and also cold starters like mozzarella. The impossible burger was mind blowing. Lobster pasta came in a generous serving, and the lobster came de-shelled. We definitely left the place feeling stuffed and satisfied. Would definitely revisit to try the steak as it comes with 16 different sauces/condiments to choose from! Thank you for making the day perfect!"
Weekend birthday lunch with families,"Excellent food, well worth visiting. Now for some tips to customers. I initially booked online to celebrate my wife's birthday with another family of four. The plan being to have the set 3 course lunch meal that is quite good value, I have had before. But I delayed the booking to 1:30pm because of the Aquathon race on Sunday. So we arrive and got offered the buffet with a drinks package, we choose the standard free flow, but not the champagne upgrade. I didn't realize that it cut off 2:30 for the drinks and 3:00pm for the food. So we had to race at he end. I think to get true value without racing you need to start at 12;00pm and go slowly. But overall excellent food. Would I do the free flow drinks again - probably not, even though the wine is good and the self service gin OK, avoid the whisky's - low quality flavored, not up to standard for a genuine whisky drinker. Overall it cost $835 for 2 families, I think two children's buffets, but no free flow for them. So for a great food weekend out, once and a while, ok"
Impeccable service that exceeds my expectations,"This is my third time dining in La Brasserie, and as always, I’m really impressed by their service and food. I have a an overseas guest and I brought him specially there because I know he will not be disappointed. Indeed, he was full of praise of the impeccable service and sumptuous food. The staff was very attentive and friendly, with a cheerful smile on their face always. My guest was especially amazed by the number of sauces to accompany his steak. A special shoutout to Alan, Tanesh and Chat Yin for making this dinner a memorable experience for my guest and I. During this period when the country is taking extra precaution against the nCOV, the restaurant also stepped up to take temperature for all guests. Thank you for always exceeding my expectation in every way!"
