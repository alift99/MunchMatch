Visit to Prive Wheelock on 19 January 2023,"Service and menu was good. The place was great to chill and relax and enjoy a meal and drinks with friends and loved ones. Will definitely go again. Great work, everyone!"
Christmas Eve Dinner,"The ambience was nice and festive, drinks were good. The turkey is slightly overcooked. Overall a good restaurant for dinning. Will recommend for other couples."
Awful stale garlic toast,"I have ordered the Middle Eastern Avocado Toast and it was simply awful.
the bread was stale, but the worst part was the taste: among the bread, avocado, hummus, chickpeas, only garlic was detected, I don't know why SO MUCH garlic.
I am still feeling sick. Will not come back again ever"
"Nice ambience, food quality could have been improved","The service staff was very prompt and friendly.
Ordered the beef burger and the roasted lemon and thyme chicken, which was good.
However, there was some bits in the patty which was abit hard to chew and felt that the meat could have been more fresh.
Overall, it was a nice place to visit and hope to come again soon."
Gathering with friend,The food is great and we have an enjoyable evening dining in Prive Wheelock. I am sure to visit again.
Great Place to meet friends during Christmas Seasons,"Location was great, able to have a great view of the Christmas decorated street. Restaurant is comfortable enough to spend the afternoon with friends for tea."
Good Customer service,"Service crew are excellent, friendly and energetic. Pasta can be tastier, lacks abit of omph, portion/ sizing is a good amount for a lady."
Great service!,"Service was absolutely outstanding! Very nice, friendly and helpful staff. Also in Privé Jewels staff is great. In both places food was very, very average. Small portions, no flavor,
I had to add a ton of salt to my salmon steak to make it a bit tasty. No dressing and salmon was very, very small Price at both places are just CRAZY. It was a disappointment. I would only go back for the good service and the nice ambience."
How can a burger be so dry?,"A nice place let down by mediocre food. The burger looked great, but the beef was so dry I could barely force it down me. The ‘chef’ must be pre cooking the burgers before cremating them on order. Such a shame."
Lunch at Prive,"Waiting time was short, food reasonable, as expected of restaurant.
However the open concept of the restaurant means birds freely flew in and walked freely over empty table. I personally feel not v hygienic as I do not see any staff shooing birds away or wiping down the tables after the birds.. i feel like I am at a coffeeshop rather than a restaurant. Not worth the $$$… bad experience overall."
Not worth returning,"Came in for Brunch. To our disappointment, Eggs Benedict was overcooked. Just look at it in the picture. They probably have a good deal with their salt supplier, as the Laksa was salty. Never repeating my visit to this dining place."
"Great food, brilliant service, awesome ambience!","Fast serving time, reasonable price, great environment and tasty food :) It's really highly recommended!"
Best place to relax,I have been here with family and friends. The place has everything to offer. I love your cocktails of the week!
Relaxed Evening meal,"I visited Prive Wheelock whilst in Singapore on business, I went for the mixed Asian platter it was fantastic, the waitress was very helpful and didn't rush me will come back, very relaxed place in the middle of the downtown area."
Stopped io for a happy hour drink,"Nice happy hour prices and also nice to get a spot to drink alcohol in Singapore with a view.

Great to watch the people walk by while you cool down from he heat and humidity.

Even had a cosplay show, with 2 local girls strutting their stuff."
"No respect for local dishes. Drink, don’t eat!","I’ve eaten at 3 branches of Privé in the past month, having successfully - and correctly - avoided it for years. This visit, the Laksa sauce tasted great but the dish was put up suspiciously quickly. It contained clumps of noodles, suggesting they had been pre-cut and cooked. The eggs had an odd metallic flavour. The squid rings had been cut with membrane on, which makes them terrifying to eat. This wasn’t a slip-up as I have had an identical experience at the Botanics branch.
My host ordered Hainanese Chicken Rice, which was put up even faster and resembled a 1980’s TV dinner. She barely touched it.
On this occasion, food was not our priority so we didn’t make a fuss. But nor was it the restaurant’s priority. For a Singaporean outfit to make such a hash of two of the country’s most-loved dishes is unforgivable. This is surprising when you learn that Privé Group’s Chairman Yuan Oeij waxes lyrical in interviews about Chicken Rice being his favourite dish. Perhaps he gets his from the local hawker centre, as shall I in future."
Will never visit again!,"inattentive staff, manager who doesn't seem to be happy with his job. Beef burger with smelly taste & coffee sucks."
Not a good lunch experience,"We had a lunch one day , but was really disappointed, we were all. Not good quality food at all. Maybe it’s ok for a coffee or drink but not to proper meal"
Lousy,Sorry sir we don’t have a table for three days the guy who tried to blow me off. There was a table for four right there with ONE X so could seat three people. Must have tried to get rid of me because I’m Indian. Nice.
Lunch,Delicious vegan options!Will definitely revisit !One of the charming al Fresca dining restaurants in Singapore.
Quite unhygienic.,Staff was rinsing his mount and blowing his nose at the kitchen sink. Should have gone to the toilet to do instead.
Food & Beverage,"Satisfied with Salmon and steak ,though , the mocha not that to my preferred taste Nice open and cosy environment."
Great Environment in Privé Wheelock,Nice cheer up place with friend for celebration and chit chat. Nice and big portion of food. Fresh ingredients and good taste!
Shortenened NYE Family Dinner,"Reserved table for 4 at 9pm as our annual family NYE Dinner. but was unpleasantly surprised when waitress approached ipus abt 945pm saying 'any last orders'...alamak NYE this Privy outket cloding at 1030pm! wat a utter disappointment,"
Poor food quality and lack of service staff,"Slipper lobster pasta was underwhelming, no taste of roasted pepper nor can they be sighted, zucchini was a few small pieces, tasted like normal canned tomato based sauce. Slipper lobster was way over cooked and dried up and chewy. The big plate of pasta only had 2 tiny halves of the slipper lobster meat. And nothing else. Asked for no chilli, server agreed to get the kitchen to do so, end up with one chilli spotted, asked to change to avocado toast. Lucky don’t have to eat that plate of pasta I could easily cook at home, with better ingredients. And it was priced at $24++

Half chicken was missing potatoes. Seriously. The brown sauce was too sweet.

Avocado toast was not seasoned. Had to ask for salt. Avocado was half of what was on the toast previous two times I visited in 2020. Definitely not worth $18++

Mushroom soup was ok.

Staff were only 2 on the floor. It was full on a Monday (holiday) lunch time.

Disappointed with the food"
Unpleasant meal,We are very disappointed with our meals at Prive. The food taste weird & salty. The service is sucks. The environment is unpleasant with pigeon walking around.
"yummy food, polite staff","food was nice, staff were polite and pleasant. enjoyed my time there with my friends! wait time for the food was just nice, we didn’t have to wait long."
Poor service and poor food,"Coffee was very diluted. We politely asked the server if this was the standard of their coffee. He did not understand our qn and impatiently said he would replace it without even asking what was wrong with it. As if he knew the coffee was poorly made. Manager came to try to understand the situation, he told us that it was the standard of coffee and even if they remade it, it would taste the same. Decided to give it another try - still diluted and extremely sour. Food was poor, bread of the club sandwich was dry and hard. The crab cake was starchy, and did not taste of crab. Fries was good though. Overall very poor experience. Would not recommend a visit there."
Enjoyed a good breakfast at orchard road,"I went with my wife to the restaurant in morning hoping for a good healthy breakfast and I was not disappointed. Although I reached 30 mins after my actual reservation time, I was able to get the reservation. Thank you for a very good breakfast."
good customer service during peak hours,"Visited the restaurant on sat during peak hours, the staffs especially Jason and Suhairi was very friendly and helpful during our dining experience. Would recommend this place to my family members and friends."
dinner,"liked the atmosphere but was not a big fan of the food. however the service was good as the staff, jason and suhairi were very friendly. service was fast as well. since it was raining, we had to share the table with 2 other patrons. even though it was no big deal to us, they even gave us 2 free desserts :)"
Lazy afternoon,Perfect place for nice and cool afternoon with good friends. Very relaxing and good service. Feels like I am on holiday:))
Good food and service,Lovely place to hang out with friends for good food and drinks. Very warm and friendly waiters! Will be back again!
Happy hour was great!,"Great atmosphere and beer was great! My friends and I had a good time , we will be back for more beer and food."
Birthday dinner with my sister in law,"Great ambience with good food. Had birthday dinner with sister in law...Caught us in surprise with complimentary ice cream with browine...

My sister in law has received birthday blessings from the team.

Great hospitality by Suhairi - making great effort to switch off the fan in order for my sister in law blew her candle... this is open space restaurant very airy night

Jason is very attentive - topped up our water without us asking for top up

Natasha is very polite and pleasant.

Great job,guys. Keep up the good job!!!

We will definitely be back again for the chill out night"
Nice place to dine in for birthday,"Very nice environment to seat in for a nice dinner and birthday is a complimentary from them. All the staff is very nice and friendly. I give compliment to Suhairl, Jason and Natasha. Thank you Michelle for the Birthday treat."
Nice place of meeting,"Place very accessible from Orchard MRT station. Ordered salad, pasta, fries and wine. Salad portion is reasonable. Pasta is a bit pricey. Waiter are friendly and they try to help us whatever we need. Although restaurants are pa k, but they are still able to meet our request fast. They are well trained. Only some of the round table is a bit small. Food serve fast."
Bad experience,Overcooked over salty poached eggs. Won't order served and when we asked for extra cutlery staff seemed irritated. Was given children's cutlery and when we have a poor feedback at the end she was least bothered.
Made reservations but was told it wasn't found,"Hi, I made a reservation and when i arrived, i was told there were no reservations. thankfully there were tables that could accomodate the four of us. Food was great but just hope that the reservation system would work better."
Attitude of the waiters,"We book the reservation & we knew the time limit was 1.5 hour. However the staff keep ""reminding"" us on the time limit and make us feel really uncomfortable"
Compliments to the staff especially Mr Suhairi,He made our dinning experience memorable. He took the lead together his staff in ensuring that the food was without shellfish as my wife had an allergy to shell fish. Well done! Really appreciative of his excellent service.
Great for Happy hours and a casual chill.,We were very well serviced by the waitstaff and the manager. The drinks were well worth given the pricing for happy hour. Will return
Food was horrible.,Linguine mushroom carbonara is watery and tasted bland like water. Aglio olio with roast pork belly supposed to be crispy pork belly end up i got some soggy non crispy pork belly that was hard and super difficult to bite. Meat was so hard and not tender at all. Not worth the price paid at all. Would not want to revisit this place again.
Breakfast at Paragon,"Was at the paragon branch for breakfast. Had the sausage muffin and it was ok. Service is good as well. The CEO was just terminated (and charged by the police) for attacking a boy in public, hope this doesn’t impact their daily operations"
Great place to chill out and people watch!,"If you prefer ambience over food, this place is great. Ordered the Mediterranean Salad, crab cakes, nachos and pork belly pasta. Only the nachos tasted good. The pasta is rather bland. The salad tasted weird, somehow the items don't really blend with the sauce. The crab cakes were ok though. The wait staff was attentive. Would patronise again for drinks and 'small bites'."
"Will not even go back there again, let alone recommend the restaurant to anyone","Service staff forgot our orders two times.
And one male service staff was very rude. We were given a very small table for 5 people and when the food came, there was no place to put the food at all so I asked if we can have a small table by the side or behind us since the restaurant was not full and these tables were empty. He gave us a rude ""No"" and walked right away.
We ordered vegetarian chicken rice for the vegan in the group and she was served chicken meat rice.
There was also a long strand of hair in the Impossible meatballs.
Overall service was terrible and food is really terrible too.
Unless you like rude service or food in your hair, I will no recommend this place."
Good food but social distancing lacking,"Table next to us was a family with a kid that kept inching close to our table. The table were not placed far apart so we felt uncomfortable while having masks off as we ate. However, the vegan options at prive deserves credit."
Great setting but dish terrible,"I ordered lemon and Thyme half roasted chicken. Very dry and stringy meat, could tell it was made from frozen. Came with 3 very small sautéed potatoes, one table spoon of sauce. As well as poor quality at a cost of $25++ really poor value. I normally go for the salads which I enjoy. Great setting, good service, chicken dish 3/10 terrible, do not order!!"
Great Vegan Options,"Food tastes great and there's a wide range of vegan options. Although it gets hot at noon time, the place is well-ventilated and keeps the place a bit cool. Service is good too."
Overcharged,"Like to sit by the side walk and people watch. Salad serving is huge. Standard size is more than enough to feed two or as a main course for hungry person. Was overcharged 2 coffees, pls check your bill before paying."
"Casual Staff, Lack of customer focus","Terrible experience, staff was casual in their approach. Requested them to serve a spicy Aglio olio, it was bland . Pizza was cold and Wine was as hot as cup of tea. Not worth your money !"
Amazing place for a business meeting .,This is an amazing place for a casual meeting and food is delicious. I loved everything in this place . I tried Mediterranean salad 😊it was amazing 🤩
Standard cafe,Food is pretty standard - nothing bad or good to say about it. Location is great and I like the outdoorsy space. Staff is friendly! They also have a happy hour from 5pm-8pm.
Best service so far.,"Despite the number of customer they have to attended,their service still maintains at “tip-TOP” .
It was my birthday and they even handed me a birthday card with all the Prive crew signature on it.
Best birthday, couldn’t ask for more :)

Special thanks to David,Hairi,Yasueen and Ardaus."
Awesome birthday dinner with friends,"Had a really pleasant evening with the crew at Prive Wheelock! Services is top notch and foods taste amazing delicious, the ambience here is so chill and so relax for a night out. Special shoutout to David, Hairi, Yasmeen and Firdaus! Keep up the good work! Definitely looking forward to my next visit"
Had lunch with my friend today,"Had lunch with my friend today whom I have not seen for a while, had a long talk with great food. Also happen that it was her upcoming birthday on Tues so had taken the opportunity to celebrate it in advance. Was happy with Julie’s service, she organise a brownies with ice cream for my friend took a photo via polaroid and surprised my friend with card with the photo taken. It certainly made her day and us, overall. Excellent service, simple gesture like this definitely made the experience awesome. Thank you for such a great service.

I don’t normally write a feedback like this but i felt that its so rare to get such extra mile service from restaurant nowadays. Kudos to Privé team and the Filipino manager. Of course to Julie ❤️.

Thank you!"
Celebrating my birthday,"Came here for dinner without reservation, managed to get a seat and the staff was very observant to notice that it was my birthday because of the bouquet I had, specially prepared dessert and took photos for me and my friends. Ended the night with a good note. Thank you."
Good experience,"Here for friends birthday celebration. Visited outlet at Orchard Wheelock Place. Good ambience, Good food and good service, especially from David. Will definitely come again :)"
Great experience with attentive staffs,"The staffs especially David is very helpful and attentive. It was my friend's birthday and he gave my friend 2 free birthday desserts. He also provide us umbrella on the rainy day because we were sorted next to the edge of the restaurant. Overall, it was a great experience at Prive."
Friendly staff with good service,"David is very helpful , attentive ,and friendly staff with good service . And there is happy hour 5-8pm"
Birthday Celebration,"Very nice place to chill with friends. David , the waiter is friendly and helpful. Thanks for everything :)"
Service,The service is not good as the service attendant cleared our food without asking if we are done. They also did not lower the binder immediately when it started to rain and take their own sweet time to do it. Wouldn't recommend this place.
Pleasant Visit,Was here for late lunch with my friends earlier on and the menu was awesome because there’s a wide variety of choices for people with dietary requirements and for the kids as well. Ambience was beautiful and staff was prompt. Thank you for the good experience will definitely come back.
We enjoyed a great dinner with Happy Hour drinks on a Friday night!,"Making a reservation was quick and easy. As we had 7pax, we had to make a call for a reservation and everything was quick and smooth. The food was great and we loved the ambience at Prive Wheelock. We’ll definitely be back again! Thank you!"
Worst food experience in Singapore,"all the food items we ordered were either tasteless or too oily. i complained thrice about this but no dish was changed and we could hardly eat half of the food (yes, we had to visit another place for dinner after paying SGD 150 here). what made it worse was that at the end, the Manager didn't even bother to come and talk to us and neither was any amount waived off from the bill. Apparently, the senior management didn't feel the food was bad for they are a big brand (yes, i was made to wait for 10mins as they spoke internally and then told, nothing can be done). Worst food experience in Singapore. Yes, the Staffs were polite but the Manager/Management too arrogant"
Good location with excellence service serve by Assistant Manager,"The café has one or two good qualities. The service was above average serve by Assistant Manager Mr. Suhairi he did take the time to make the table ready and his very attentive, the main course was good, Overall, I enjoyed our experience. I recommend it as a nice place to eat and relax."
"Excellent food, great service","We were spoilt for choice as the selection for vegetarians was amazing! The food was excellent in taste and presentation, as was the service."
Lousy cafe,The only good thing about this cafe is the location. For waht must be the flagship outlet for the Prive Group it is a dump. Ordered bowl of fries and they came almost black from having been re-fried multiiple times. Chicken satay was a few small sticks heated in a microwave and prexented on a chipped tea plate with a random piece of red onion. The cheque is presented in a plastic ho;der that is all frayed and broken. Obviously no one cares! You charge $85++ (S$100) for Baby Doll Sauvignon Blanc that even I can buy for S$21 on Lazada for a single bottle. Prive must get for say $17 so a rip off 5 times mark up. Wouldnt go there again. Crossroads at the Marrriott is much better quality and value.
dinner with friends,it was a great dinner with nice ambience and night wind! celebrated one of my friends birthdays and they were really nice to help us store the cake and serve during dessert (-:
Great experience celebrating,Great experience celebrating a friend's birthday here! The staff were really friendly and they even helped with the celebrations.
Don't order the Middle Eastern Avocado Toast w chickpea toppings,"'Cumin-lime roasted chickpeas' - sounds great! So ordered 2 toppings - the chickpeas and the poached eggs. The poached eggs came way before the main dish in a little pan - strange. When the main dish came, was disappointed to see that the chickpea topping consisted of about 10 shriveled pea-size peanut-looking things scattered on top of the toast. They had no taste at all. It was more like a garnish but was charged $18 (cost of dish) + $5. Wish I had taken a picture...

That said, okay ambience and thanks David the MVP of the branch. We also had the sausage muffin (okay), an acai bowl (quite nice) and a brownie (bad). On happier occasions I've enjoyed the pancakes, carbonara, carrot cake, tiramisu and hazelnut praline cake at other branches."
Definitely coming back again!,"Food was great but most importantly, service was impeccable! Definitely recommend this place for a nice chill meal."
Dinner at Prive Wheelock!,Lovely ambience and great service! David was really helpful! We enjoyed the tiramisu and thank you for the Polaroid! :)
A lovely evening all round.,A lovely evening all round. David provided a great level of service. He was able to explain food dishes and how the specials were. Totally enjoyable!!
Xiang is cool (2) :),Had a joint birthday dinner with my friend and the staff were really friendly and helpful. They even gave us the brownie for free and took pictures for us :) Thank you for making our birthday even better!!
xiang is cool :-),"my friend and I celebrated our birthdays together at the restaurant, and the service was really good. They even gave us the brownie for free, took a photo of us, and gave us a card that all the staff had signed. Thank you for making our combined birthday dinner so memorable :-)"
David is fab!,Great place to watch the world go by. David was lovely and so helpful. A lovely morning and great salad!
Birthday dinner,"Amazing service, food was quickly served, food portion was very good.
They suggested a high chair seating and was efficient in preparing a low chair seating when we requested. They were sneaky with the birthday cake which was very much appreciated as my friend was surprised. Additionally, they took a nice polaroid and gave him a card with it. Polite and friendly, I definitely recommend!"
Awesome chef and very helpful staff,The desserts that I want to order is available only breakfast but staff went to ask the chef to make it special time for me. I’m very very happy♥️♥️
"Awesome service by Sheila, front house","Albeit a delayed write up, we had a good time at Prive Wheelock also because of Sheila’s friendliness when it came to taking our orders. I have a gluten intolerance and she made sure to check which item had gluten and which did not, despite the lunch crowd. So a special shout out to her! Thanks Prive for the vegan options :) would be great to add gluten free to the mix at some point where possible."
Awesome staff,staff were so friendly and polite and helpful. they advised on the different dishes and the quantity and also offers for birthdays etc.
"Excellent Vegan Dishes, Fantastic Service, Beautiful Ambience","Excellent Veganuary 2021 special menu! The biryani featured nicely spiced Impossible meatballs and chickpea curry, while the fish and chips were impressively realistic made of flaky banana blossom. The staff also went out of their way to make my boyfriend's birthday a memorable one, offering us a vegan brownie and ice cream dessert as well as preparing a card with our Polaroid photograph. The ambience was beautiful too. We have had multiple dates at Privé and will definitely enjoy more dates to come! Hope the vegan menu will keep expanding too!"
Horrible food,"The ambience looks good from outside so we tried the Prive for the first time.. but unfortunately the food were all badly prepared.. pasta, sandwitches, toast were all tasteless and cold when served. Better choose this place for drink only."
Excellent service and spot on food,Most enjoyable experience at any Prive outlet to date. Will definitely be visiting again. Staff is extremely nice
Good service,Celebrated our birthdays and even got a card with a Polaroid and cake from the staff! The waiter that served us also was helpful too. Appreciate the extra effort for a pleasant customer experience 👍🏻 the beef burger was good as well.
Chill ambience with amazing service,"Had a gathering with my friends today. Lovely night breeze, awesome gathering with amazing service by Jason, April, Sam & team. Keep it up!"
Birthday Celebration!,"Superb service, putting in extra effort for birthday celebration. Greatly appreciate it! Good food, great environment! :)"
Great service!,Great staff attitude. They were very welcoming and attentive! Although I’d have wished for happy hour to end at 9 instead....
nice!!!,"Food was good. Staff were super friendly and took initiative. Staff even wrote personalised cards for our friends whom we were celebrating birthdays for. Special shoutout to Hari, David, Tiffany and Kiren for always having a smile on their faces and their pleasant service!"
Great service,"Great service from the staff. Free polaroid and birthday card was a great surprise. Food was delicious! Special mention to Hari, David, Tiffany and Kiren for making the night so special."
Birthday celebration,"Had a wonderful experience celebrating my birthday here. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Shoutout to Hari, David, Tiffany and Kiren :)"
Pleasant evening,"Great service - friendly, helpful and cheerful staff. Like the happy hour drinks, good price to enjoy in pleasant environment. Thanks also to Xiang for recommendation of food."
Lunch at Prive Wheelock,"Great service at Prive Wheelock, nice al fresco atmosphere. Huge thanks to the team, especially April & Hairi, for helping out with the birthday surprise & making it even more special! Definitely recommend for vegans/vegetarians looking for a place to celebrate with friends or family."
birthday surprise for my friend,"celebrated my friend’s birthday here!! the waitress and waiter April and Hairi helped so much with the birthday surprise. they were super friendly and gave my friend a birthday card and a complimentary brownie!! food was good, many vegan options, portion sizes are definitely worth it for its prices. will be back!’"
Xiang was an awesome waiter,"Xiang was an awesome waiter - fun, attentive, informative. Food was great. Service quick. Great people watching. Recommended"
dinner,their service staff were attentive. had dinner there on new year eve. happy hour wine very good rates.
Excellent Service,"I would like to highly commend Staff David, this is my 2nd time dining in this cafe (Wheelock branch). David was not only warm and friendly but also spontaneous when handling his customers despite the cafe being super full. He is able to accommodate requests and ensures that the customers are seated comfortably or moved to maximise seating capacity with the social distancing measures taken into consideration. In this day and age, many dining places lack staff with good service skills, being able to think out of the box yet maintaining composure. David displays great attributes, he is cool calm and composed. Thank you David for making our dining experiences a memorable one!"
Good service,Good service. Very excellent food. Friendly waiter and manager. Late for reservation but still get a table.
New year vibes !,"Julie the bubbly waitress @ Privè Wheelock made ALL the difference! With great ,and I really mean great 80s music and full house crowd,plus good enough menu... she took the reigns from sharing the information with this natural joyful tease in her and we were all entertained even before our orders arrived ! I was telling my friend .. what’s a great service? Is it the ambience and food? Well I know it takes a soul to complete the beautiful magical equation. Thanks Julie! Just what I needed in a land so deficient of basic good service , you sure walked to the classiest tune✨✨✨✨"
Great experience! 5 stars!,"Food was of excellent quality and service was top-notch. Our server, David, was prompt, efficient and so very humorous. What a pleasant experience. We will be back David! :)"
