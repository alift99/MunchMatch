delicious food and excellent service,"organised a post Chinese New Year gathering with friends. Loved the burgers,salads and coffees. Special thanks to Uncle John, Roselyn,Kane and Noel. Missed meeting our jovial manager Joe. Will visit again."
Best cupcakes,"Interesting way to present cupcakes. I don’t really enjoy cupcakes, but always enjoy having one from this restaurant because it is brings another dimension to the cakes."
Wedding Reception Dinner,"Really appreciate the cooperation and great service by Kannan and his team. They have made our special night, the reception dinner a dream to remember. The food was spectacular and our guests enjoyed them thoroughly. The cupcakes are a must order! Highly recommended to host your events here, as we would again for our future events. Location is also very convenient next to Tg Pagar MRT."
Amazing Intimate Wedding Dinner,"We hosted a small wedding dinner (~45pax) at TMP Downtown. Kannan (the Restaurant Manager) was really helpful and made sure we had settled all that we needed. He was prompt in replying and helpful in providing whatever we needed, and also continuously worked to help us maximise our value for money.

The location is great – high ceilings, spacious, and lots of greenery. The food was really good too and was better than expected. The service crew was friendly and helpful too. Everyone really enjoyed the food and it was all around a great experience.

Would recommend!"
Business Dinner,"Ribeye was fantastic, seasoning was on point, salmon appetiser was great, pistachio (i think) log cake was awesome too."
Great food and ambiance :),"Extremely recommended as the food were delicious, value for money is a 100%, atmosphere is awesome, location is good and easy to find :)"
Almost,"Almost, trying but not there yet. Food average, don’t bring out desert prior to the mains. Go to hawker markets instead for better quality and price"
Pretty venue for baby's 1st birthday,Was searching for a venue which can cater to adults and yet a spacious venue for kids so that they can interact freely. What made this venue stand out was the lush greenery and the cosy ambience. Guests were very impressed with how pretty the venue was! Special mention to Kannan who was very responsive throughout the planning stage. Appreciate it a lot!
Nice ambivence,"I went there to celebrate a friend's birthday. The ambivence was good, food was nice and we had a geeat time"
Wedding Solemnization Event,"So much praises for TMP Oasia, Kannan (the Restaurant Manager) and his team. It was a perfect event!

The ambience was cozy and that's why we chose TMP Oasia. The food quality catered for our event way exceeded our expectations. They were not stingy with the portions as well. The service crew was attentive from start to end. Very friendly, very sweet too.

Kannan was so obliging and really easy to work with. From start to end, he gave his all to ensure that the event will turn out the way these we want it to be.

My guests liked the venue, service and food so much. TMP made both my husband and I really proud. Keep it up Team TMP Oasia!"
Best venue for semi casual event!,"My husband and I had our Solemnisation+lunch at Marmalade Pantry Downtown. We wanted a cozy cafe/restaurant for a small and intimate event. We also chose Marmalade Pantry Downtown due to the close proximity to the MRT station (just 2 mins walk!), the interior decorations and as a Singaporean the good reviews on the food!

Kannan was really helpful from the start, providing us with the measures on Solemnisation in Singapore and was always very prompt in his replies to my numerous queries. Around 2 months before our event, he informed us of the change of chef and we were pretty worried. We chose to have a buffet for a more casual vibe and to provide our guests with more choices. The buffet did not disappoint. We received really good feedback on the food from our guests

The Solemnisation area was as we have requested. And we thank the team at Marmalade Pantry Downtown for creating this wonderful memory for our guests and us!

We also separately booked 2 rooms at oasis hotel downtown. As part of our hotel package, we were provided with 2 high tea sets at marmalade pantry. Although the high tea set has lesser items as compared to the one the other customers ordered from the restaurant directly, it was more than sufficient for 4 pax. The Crab Coleslaw Ciabatta, Cranberry Chicken Sandwiches, Truffle Egg Mayo Sandwiches, Milo Lover’s Dream Petite Cupcake and strawberry preserve for the scones were good!"
Dine in experience,Do yourself a favor and visit this lovely restaurant the marmalade pantry in oasia hotel downtown. The service i had is unmatched. The staff truly cares about your experience.especially thanks to Salma good host and service.The food is also absolutely good.Highly recommend!
Wedding Dinner,"We had our wedding event in the marmalade pantry supported by restaurant manager Mr Kannan and his team. We love the cozy environment and lightening , and our wedding guest are delighted. Not forget food are greatly delicious too."
Birthday lunch,"1st time at this branch of the Marmalade pantry.
Lovely airy space for a birthday luncheon!
Lunch portions were good and the fish mains were beautifully plated and yummy!
Cupcakes as pretty as ever!

We were well looked after by the team, especially Salma who attended to my queries as I have allergies."
Lovely ambience,Lovely place and lovely ambience. Quite near to the mrt. Food was superb and had a wonderful time dining in there. Not too busy and had a great time. Would come again.
Afternoon tea at The Marmalade Pantry at Downtown,"Location: few minutes walk from Tanjong Pagar MRT.

Order: Scan QR code to order and make payment once you confirm the order.

Food: Surprise that all the food order really nice, all the family member no objection for me to give a 5 star. Please check the receipt for the food and tea.

Service: The manager and the staff all very friendly and offer to light up the candle."
Great event experience at marmalade pantry Oasia Hotel Downtown,We organised our baby’s 1st birthday celebration at marmalade Pantry Oasia Hotel Downtown and it was a wonderful experience. We worked with Kannan on the pre-event organisation and he was very helpful and prompt in responding. The restaurant staff on site were also very proactive and super helpful. The venue was casual yet sophisticated - it was perfect for an intimate event of 60 pax and it all contributed to a lovely event experience for our family and friends!
Birthday party,"We planned a bday party at the Marmalade pantry downtown. In the planning stages with Kannan, communication was great and straight forward.everything was as per agreed and executed well. During the party itself, food was awesome. We ordered a buffet spread for our guests and it received good feedback from the guests. The whole party area was nicely organized and the staff was super attentive. Its a great place!"
"Good Food, Impeccable Service",this is my second visit to the same branch. food didn't disappoint and the service is as impeccable as my first visit. definitely a great dining experience.
"Must visit, good food, ambience, staff - 101%!","Hosted our solemnisation and lunch reception here. Wonderful and pleasant experience. Visited the cafe multiple times prior to actual day event. Staff are all very helpful and friendly, manager is easy to work with. Kudos to the team for such great effort!"
Service n food,Nice ambience. Food quality was good for the hi tea. Can have a few more savoury items in the menu. The scone should be a little warmer n served in separate plate
Lunch,Food quality is good and tasty. Serving of food is fast too. But got time limit of 90mins meal time.
Fantastic!,"It was my first visit to The Marmalade Pantry but everything was really good! The price was reasonable and the food was great. I was also impressed by the service, especially John who was very attentive and helpful. Thanks again for the wonderful experience!"
Wedding Luncheon,"A nice place for wedding lunch, cozy environment .

Overall experience is good.
Thanks to Kannan for his helpful assistance and accommodating for all the arrangement.
Thanks to all the crew of TMP for the great service.

Food portion wise could be improved to be more generous."
ROM & luncheon,Overall grateful to Kannan and his team that made our ROM a memorable one. Extra credit to Kannan that assisted us from the start till the end from planning to execution and advise on things here and there. All guests had a pleasant 3 course meal and happy guests grants equal happiness to us. Thank you once again Kannan and team!
EXCELLENT CUISINE,Good steak sandwich and grilled barramundi The tuna salad is very refreshing. They have a fantastic of cakes for desserts
Service was quite good but slow,The food was quite nice but the service was abit slow properly due to shortage of manpower. One of the guy help to separate the porton of food which i thought was a nice gesture.
CNY Lunch,"We ordered 4 dishes which included a french toast which was dry and tasteless. That set us back around $20. Not impressed.
The other dishes were the kimchi fried rice which was good, and the butternut squash with okubara pork - nicely done!
Next was the dessert - bread pudding - yummy and moist the way we liked our pudding.
Besides the food, the whole place felt cold and clinical - somehow the ambience was missing."
Lunch Solemnisation,"It was a great experience to host my Solemnisation lunch at this restaurant prepared by Kannan (Manager). To meet my guest high standard of demand, they took the extra mile and the team delivered all the request by the guest. Food was excellent. Look for the friendly staff Joe, always bringing out his smile as always when I visit the restaurant. Once again, thank you so much Kannan / Joe & and the team for the effort that you have put."
Birthday Celebration,"We had a wonderful birthday celebration yesterday, thanks to the attentive service of Joe and his crew. The food was delicious and satisfying to the tummy, and the wine was luscious to the palate.
We loved the relaxed and easy atmosphere of the cafe too, without too much noise so that we could carry a pleasant conversation, and Joe and his crew often coming by to check in on us and replenishing the drinks.
Kudos to a great job by Joe and his crew, we look forward to our next dining experience there."
Great dinner experience!,"Despite the Coronavirus doldrums weighing everyone down, my friend and I managed to have a lovely meal that enabled us to take our minds off the less sunny side of our lives. Your staff Noel and his colleagues were instrumental in making this happen - especially when they seemed short-handed relative to the dining crowd. Nonetheless, Noel and colleagues made every effort to provide much appreciated personal service throughout. Well done, Marmalade Pantry!"
Pleasant dining place to hangout,"I celebrated my birthday together with my family for a dinner. The quality of the food is undoubtedly one of the best, especially the grill salmon. My children love their desserts too, especially their signature sticky dates with ice-cream.

The service from Mr Joe had made us feel like home too, given us an unforgettable evening indeed."
Wedding Lunch,"Perfect place for a wedding lunch. The cafe has high ceiling with full ceiling to floor glass so perfect for natural lighting. We had our wedding solemnisation last weekend for a party of 50 pax. Although with the slightly congested space due to all the safe distancing measures in place, it was really cozy and we really enjoyed the service that the cafe has provided. Special mention to Kannan and his crew who made things tick on the back end, which provided both the groom and bride a seamless experience on the wedding day.

Everyone really enjoyed their food and we are really pleased with the menu choices. The food portion is adequate but it won’t hurt if the portion are slightly larger for the gentlemen who have a bigger appetite. ;)

Kannan has helped us along the wedding planning journey since the day we came to look at the venue, giving us valuable cost saving tips along the way that we are really grateful for.

This is THE place for a wedding solemnisation if you are looking for a small party of pax (50 pax and below). Due to the on-going, ever-changing COVID measures that our government has constantly flickered through, we decided to go for a reasonably number of pax (50 pax) for a safer bet and we couldn’t be more happier to choose The Marmaldade Pantry at Downtown. It is situated 2 minutes walk from Tanjong Pagar MRT(un-sheltered for rainy days, do take note).

A tip for potential couple thinking of doing a solemnisation here, do book a room at the hotel (Oasia Hotel Downtown) so that you can save yourselves some trouble moving about. We did our solemnisation at the outdoor venue of the hotel and our lunch at The Marmalade Pantry and by the time we are done, we were so exhausted that we just crashed in the room after.

Thank you once again to Kannan, his crew and the chef of The Marmalade Pantry @ Downtown for the seamless experience, wouldn’t have done it without you guys! :D"
Not worth your money,"Service was terrible, insufficient staff on the shop floor. Had preordered a birthday cake as a surprise but wasn’t served."
Lunch Solemnization at Marmalade Pantry,"We held our solemnization over lunch over here at The Marmalade Pantry. A big thank you to Kannan and team for making our solemnization an eventful one. Our family and friends enjoyed the food and drinks served and complimented on the great choice of the venue. Location was great as everyone knew the way here. For future couples who want to hold solemnization here, we would reccommend as it has a great interior and good food :)"
Excellent service and amazing food. My guest and I truly enjoyed and had a great experience at marmalade downtown,Hosted a wedding solemnisation lunch here. Great service as well as superb tasting foods and services from the staffs.
Lunch Solemnisation,"Had a wonderful experience at The Marmalade Pantry! We had our lunch solemnisation held last Saturday at the restaurant with our family and friends and everything was perfect! The atmosphere was great, service team was prompt and helpful, they even went the extra mile to help us prepare our team ceremony set! Food was lovely, our guests enjoyed themselves very much. Chef Jonathan was really friendly and even stepped out to greet us. We were super touched to receive a dessert he prepared specially for us! We would highly recommend The Marmalade Pantry to my friends and family and truly appreciate all the hardwork the team has done for us!"
Dinner @ The Marmalade Pantry Downtown,The first thing I noticed here was the great atmosphere. The vibe is really nice and there aren't many people either. Food was pretty decent as well!
Solemnisation venue,"Excellent service from the marmalade pantry(downtown)

Wedding of Shar n Darius,"Just wanna thank the marmalade pantry team at Oasia Downtown for their awesome service, assistance and teamwork to make my wedding a real success! Personally wanna thank Kannan, the manager has been one of the best personnel to work with and his effort and ability to assist us has been exemplary :) would highly recommend them a million times

Darius"
great hospitality,"Dined in at marmalade recently, first time there. Awesome ambience. Food was delicious and looked presentable. But the whole experience got better because of the staffs there. Kannan was so jovial and his hospitality really amazed our group, his team were no different from him all jovial and attentive, john and a young girl which i did not get her name. The whole experience was great, me and my group of friends will sure be coming by again soon. Thanks TMP Team."
High tea set,Cake/pastry is of average standard. Nothing stands out in term of favor or appearance. The scorn was a bit dry and hard in texture. The ala carta menu for kimchi beef rice was too oily too.
Nice dinner for the staycation,"We were staying at Oasia Downtown for a staycation and popped in for dinner. Husband took a recommendation by hotel staff to order the Hokkien mee and boy was he satisfied with his order. I ordered the vongole, which the menu said was made with Korean clams, it turned out to be quite the fusion dish. (Oh well, maybe I should have ordered the carbonara.)"
Best Food & Service,Already our 4th time here and this time we are celebrating our 16th year wedding anniversary over a simple dinner. Simple yet the staff made it special. Shout out to Joe. You are awesome! Definitely we are coming back again. Cheers!
Solemnization @ The Marmalade Pantry,The service is very good and all the staffs are friendly. Food is delicious!! Kannan (event coordinator) is helpful!
Mother's Day Hi-Tea,"I patronized The Marmalade Pantry @ Oasia Hotel Downtown for the Mother’s Day hi-tea.

I am extremely pleased with the service that was offered by your staff, Albert, Daniel and John. They were really patient with our group of 5 who were spoilt for choice while he was taking our orders. They were very willing to swap the beef sandwiches when requested for a change and even helped us with recommendations to suit our dietary needs. The food was served promptly upon ordering and our needs were carefully looked into during our time there.
 
We would like to compliment the service offered by your staff. I am sure to return to your restaurant again as you have staff who serve customers by going the extra mile. 

Yours sincerely, 
Kat."
Good ambience,Staffs were polite and friendly. Foods tasted delicious value for pricing and quality. Restaurant ambience good and soothing.
Great food and service,"I have frequent this restaurant a few times and each time has been an enjoyable experience so it deserves a great review. My friend and I happen to drop by without a reservation and they were nice enough to squeeze us in on a Friday night. The service was prompt and the food was served freshly prepared. The chef even gave us an extra large scoop of ice cream as our order of fries was slightly delayed. The waitress who attended to us was very friendly and attentive. Over all, it is a great place for a chill relax dinner with friends. My personal favourites are their desserts, do leave space to try them after your meal!"
Service is very disappointing,"Booking via chope is great and it's secured our spot for quick lunch.
however, the staff serving (lunch shift) was very unfriendly, and as soon as we mention about deals from Entertainer apps, we asked him which part of main course is part of the deal. His face changes becoming arrogant and said all alacarte mam, are u ready to order or not?

What on the world a waiter can rush customers like this, it's very unpolite and very low manner.
Then aft we finished eating, he didn't even bother to ask may we clear the table kind of stuff, he just rush picking the plates, it's very impolite for such a place and some more it's at downtown Oasia hotel, which we didn't expect to be treated this way.

Food came and it's great but the service was sucks. the restaurant should filter their staffs and replace if necessary,."
Wedding at Marmalade pantry,"My best friend had her wedding reception at Maramalde Pantry, and we had such a wonderful experience from the ease of planning the wedding with Kannan, especially during covid restrictions and the shift into phase 2, to the guest list mishap we’ve overlooked! A big thank you to Kannan & Albert for assistance us all throughout the process! The wedding went really well & smoothly, we couldn’t be happier!"
Mother's day set,we had a pleasant afternoon at the restaurant and the manager Kannan was really obliging and helpful throughout our time there. set was more than sufficient for 3 of us.
Wedding,Had a great experience for our wedding at the marmalade pantry. Kannan is super helpful and reply to all our enquiries promptly. He and his team is very accommodating to our needs and did a great job ensuring a smooth flow during the whole event. We highly recommend this place for any event.
Wedding Solemnisation,"The Marmalade Pantry was one of our best choices for our wedding. The aesthetics are nice, conveniently located at oasia hotel downtown, and the food was great. Even before our wedding, we’d usually go to TMP for dinner/dessert.

We are truly grateful to Kannan and the whole team. Kannan was quick to reply to all of my queries, and he had a lot of suggestions too especially that we’re holding it during covid period. I didn’t find it hard to run through with him the whole wedding program, and he’s very easy to talk to. I know that he also tried his best to accommodate all our requests— thumbs up for that! Especially that i’m a very detailed person, he listened and tried to source everything that we need and want.

His whole team was also very accommodating and helpful. Most of our guest tables are DIY and though i wasn’t there during the setup, i know that they helped a lot. Dinner was served on time, and they were quick to adapt to the changes during that day. Canapes, starters, mains, and desserts are ALL great. I asked a few of my guests and they said the dinner was really delicious— and i’m so glad they loved it as one of the things that they will remember is food. As compared to other restaurants, it’s really a value for money.

I highly recommend TMP for anyone who wants to hold their solemnization at a restaurant. No regrets in choosing them :)"
Worst High Tea Expeience,Staffs were not accomodating. The sandwiches were stale and the chef was unbelievable! He even argued with us as we were trying to tell him about the sandwiches. Extremely not satisfied at all!
High Tea,High tea great. Wish it was further discounted. The sandwich was good. Tea selection is selective Wish there was more and available
Cafe with some delicious cakes,"We ordered the Kurobuta with Pumpkin, which was great, and Scallop & Prawn bisque. The base sauce was decent, but the prawns are not fresh unfortunately. This is probably caused by supply issue due to Covid-19 situation.
The desserts were rich and delectable though. Ordered the sticky date pudding and chocolate cake slice - they were both amazing."
Best team and best food for a fabulous solemnisation!,"We are very grateful to Kannan and team for allowing us to host our ROM solemnisation in a very smooth manner with absolutely no hassle at all! We could never have had a better team serve our guests and us! Kannan and the team were so fine in their mannerisms and made sure all our guests got their food on time. Special mention to Kannan for giving us the best suggestions in terms of food, itinerary for the day and everything you need for your guests to be happy! Thank you so much guys! Lovely food! Great chefs! Best service!"
Casual Lunch,"Can't remember the number of times I've been here, only because it's too good!

We were pretty late for our appointment but thankful the team held our table for us, and served us promptly upon arriving. We ordered the kimchi beef fried rice which was surprisingly good! beef was medium well, paired with the kimchi fried rice, a combination of the right sweetness and sourness, opened up our tastebuds. The other dish was refreshing main, scallop and tiger prawns pasta, served with really fresh seafood that goes well w pasta. By far, the best pasta I had thus far!"
Ladies love it here,"Ladies love it here as it provides the perfect setting for womanly arvo gossip seshes over elegantly presented sweets and savouries. Of all the outlets, this is the mantlepiece. Lights that swankily arch over like shower heads and the plush upholstery truly lifts your spirits. I had very ambivalent feelings about our server Junaith as he was very stand-offish and there were misunderstandings. However, it feels like the elderly ladies at the other table really take to him. Otherwise, the other servers provided crisp service. The executive set lunch was a must-go for - $24 for a soup / salad, main course and a tea/coffee to boot. I had the tango shrimp and mango salad. Pan fried salmon was fried perfect and bathed in sultry creamy sauce. I’m thinking of the high tea at some point but maybe at another outlet, with sunnier service from the greeter."
Very nice service team!,Great food blessed with a nice service team! We could feel that everyone was paying attention to our table. All with cheerful and genuine smile! And thanks to Ben for the personal touch!
Amazing executive set lunch,"This place is located in O asia hotel on Peck Seah Street. It's really cozy and nice. Their executive set lunch (28++) is great value for money and food is amazing. The set lunch includes 1 soup/salad of the day, 1 main and 1 coffee/tea/juice.
We went for the soup of the day Mushroom soup and their salad was a ham and walnut salad. Both were good.
Coming to the mains, we ordered the Crispy chicken ciabatta (came with a side salad, sweet potato fries and dipping sauce), this was my favourite!
The other main we ordered was Grilled salmon and roasted potatoes (came with carrots, fine beans and mustard cream sauce). If you wanna order the salmon it comes at $5 add on.
The portion is really good (according to me) and tasted amazing!! I would definitely come back for a good hearty lunch here!"
Cosy Solemnisation,"I would love to just thank Kannan and all the staff at Marmalade Pantry Downtown for the amazing work during our solemnisation. Kannan made it seamless and is such a wonderful manager to work with! All the guests loved the food during the high tea solemnisation. The service staff were excellent and were super attentive to my guests.

Any couples thinking of holding your solemnisation here, dont hesitate as it's the perfect venue, with perfect food, amazing service, and the best man leading it all!

Cheers once again for an unforgettable moment!"
Casual Brunch,"Service crew was kind enough to hold table for us when we alerted that we would be 15 mins late.

Always prefer Marmalade at Downtown or Novena as they are not as packed as Ion, and service crew are a lot more attentive. Ordered our usual big breakfast and scallops and tiger prawns pasta. Big breakfast portion is really huge, and good as always. Were blown away by this new pasta that we tried, the pasta is flavourful and light in taste, served with large and fresh pan-seared scallops and tiger prawns, easily one of the best pasta from marmalade. Used our entertainer 1 for 1, and making bill more affordable."
"Good Food, Good Service!","We would like thank the team of Marmalde Pantry Oasia Hotel Downtown for their good service. My son had a wedding last week and even with the covid-19 restricted measures, their service was admirable; they moved like clockwork. Kannan the manager saw that our needs were met and he and his team were always on their toes ready to serve us... it was a first class service. Since my son and his wife were checked in the hotel, they were given complimentary breakfast and they gave 4 of our guests free parking. We also loved the interior decor of the restaurant, not to mention their food! My guests loved their signature sticky date pudding. Highly recommended!"
Brunch,"awesome food! awesome ambience, awesome servers, awesome handling of post Covid-19 case. Thank you for the awesome time."
Pleasant Saturday Brunch,"Our first time to this branch at downtown, but definitely not our first time to marmalade pantry!

We often frequent the one at novena, as it's a lot quieter there as compared to the one at ION. And, we decided to give this a try and this, has become our new favourite outlet now, for the restaurant is more cheerful, lively and vibrant in colours, in comparison to Novena outlet that has a darker theme.

This outlet has gone digital, and requires us to scan the QR code for the digital menu, which was a pity as it lost its asethically pleasing table layout!

We were prompting served once seated, and coffee was first within minutes after placing our order. Coffee was really good, has the rich body taste and aroma to it! Food was served together promptly hereafter, and it was still as good as before!

Ordered their signature spicy crabmeat pasta and truffle beef burger. The former is good when served hot, however to finish a portion alone can be a little too heavy in taste on the palate. Will recommend for sharing instead!

The truffle beef was a better option, the truffle goes well the the medium well beef patty, together with caramelised onions, mushrooms cheese, topping it off with a toasted butter bun! Every bite tasted so flavourful and delicious! Even the fries that came along with the burger has a sprinkle of truffle oil, fried to perfection, fragrant and crispy, even when we had it after the fries went cold. Definitely a must-try!"
Great quality food,Ordered delivery. Food arrived on time. Nice packaging. Sweet thank you note from the resturant. Grilled salmon taste delicious. Truffled risotto was dry but still taste good. Great afternoon tea experience. Best meal we had since CB!
dinner,ordered takeaway of french toast and bacon and chicken parmigiana. hearty portions and good service.
Gluten free option,Good weekend lunch here is a quiet affair. Had a one for one mains offer by the hotel. Ordered the crab meat pasta . gluten free penne version and the clubs sandwich with gluten free bread. Both were delicious. Crab meat pasta was spicy. But it had alot of shredded crabmeat . 1 for 1 drinks at 12 pm to 9 pm for beers and wines.
"Looks good, but a letdown","There were only 3 waiters serving us at the restaurant and they seem very slow and uninterested in working. When we arrived, it took him 10 minutes to sit us down (even though there’s no queue) as he was occupied with other stuff.
When we were trying to get our bill, no waiter gave attention to us when we call for them. Either pretend not to see or just walked past us. Only when I called out to them did they come to us.
Food was ok, could be better. Pork belly was the saving grace for this place. Other than that, it’s a letdown"
Tasty brunch,Went here with friends on a quiet Sunday morning. We had to booked the place even the restaurant was quite enjoy. Try their yummy crab dishes and you won't regret it!
Wedding Lunch Reception,"Hosted our wedding lunch last Saturday at this restaurant. The service crew were excellent and efficient. The restaurant manager, Mr Kannan, was very accommodating and helpful. All of our guests enjoyed themselves and mentioned that they enjoyed the mushroom soup and mac & cheese the most! If you are looking for an alternative wedding venue, do consider The Marmalade Pantry at Oasia Hotel Downtown! :) All of our guests were satisfied with the reception and loved the intimate setting."
Restaurant with Botanic Feel,"After a busy day it is nice to visit this restaurant where not too noisy and with lots of green. It really make us feel relax.

The food was not too bad too. Vegetarian/Vegan food is served here too."
Rainbow cake!!,After walking past the window of cakes about 40 times I finally broke and got myself a slice of the rainbow cake. I will never forget this cake.... never!
Very disappointed,"My first visit to Marmalade at Oasia at Peck Seah. I had assumed that the food and service would be similar to the branch at Oasia at Novena. I was wrong.

The 3 course set lunch at $35 was a complete disaster.

The soup came in a small bowl. My friend had a burnt burger bun and overdone beef patty (her order was for medium), two orders of Snapper was over cooked, and the couscous was bland.

The dessert was miserable : a scoop of red velvet which tasted like chocolate ( waiter insisted it was not chocolate)

Poor service :
The first waiter telling us the sorbet and ice cream only came in Vanilla flavour. The second waiter told us that the sorbet only came in yuzu flavour.

The third waiter gave us the bill when we asked for it , and walked off.

The forth waiter, when I told him that my credit card was in the folder with the bill, he nodded and left. He later came back to give us a fresh bill.

To top this , to get the attention of the writers required us waving our hands high up repeatedly before someone actually look up from their work (laying tables, or chatting with colleagues)

We paid a total of $120++ for three pax and I think the overall experience was worth $30."
Beautiful and quiet environment on a Saturday afternoon,"Great place to enjoy brunch on a weekend if you're looking for some place quiet and near town. Food was good and the staff were attentive. The chocolate fudge cake was amazing too,"
Excellent Service Crew,"Despite the long 35mins wait for our food, the service crew handled all impatient Customers’ inquiries calmly & with upmost professionalism. Special Thanks to Esther for your great recommendation & attentiveness. Prehaps the Management needs to hire a couple for Chef for the holiday Seasons."
Not up to standard,"I ordered the chicken rice which doesn’t taste good at all, the rice is not warm enough and is expensive. The executive fish set is bland. Food does not live up to restaurant reputation. Disappointed."
"Horrible service, worst food","I came here hoping to have a lovely lunch with my colleagues and was incredibly appalled by the restaurant’s inability to cope with the lunch crowd. The restaurant was crowded, yes, but that did not justify waiting for over an hour for our food to arrive. I had asked them to check on our order multiple times, and it was only on the sixth time that they mentioned that they had keyed in the wrong order. It did not help either that they hired many inexperienced and junior servers who looked like they did not properly internalize their roles clearly. The restaurant offered us their complimentary sticky date and toffee pudding, which was abysmal, at best. The wagyu beef was really horrible, and so was the pasta arrabiata. In short, only come to this restaurant if you are prepared to be embarrassed in front of your guests."
horrible wagyu,i was looking forward to a good xmas lunch. turns out it was very bad. wagyu beef was chewy fatty and inedible. it was so bad i changed knife as advised. given steak knife to replace dinner knife. still its cant. this is horrible experience for me.
Awesome food and service!,"The main restaurant within Oasia Hotel Downtown, The Marmalade Pantry service delicious food alongside fantastic service.

I especially love the items from their Asian Corner which feature familiar local fares racheted up a notch with richer ingredients and robust flavours.

Alongside the casual setting and superb service from the crew (especially from Esther), this is definitely a place that I look forward to return to."
First birthday party celebration,"We held our baby’s first birthday celebration at Marmalade Pantry downtown. Albert contacted promptly once I had expressed my interest the venue.

Albert was very helpful in answering all my queries that I had and Kannan was very helpful in the event coordination. There were no hiccups on the day and everything went smoothly.

All my guests through that the food was great! And I agree! It was indeed a delicious spread! Food was sufficient for all my guests and no one went home hungry!

Do consider booking your events here! I highly recommend it! Their service is good, the location and ambience of the restaurant is good and the food is awesome!

5 stars!"
Delightful meal and nice ambience,"The salmon and baked chicken were delicious! For dessert, the lemon tart was delightful and zesty! Service was prompt and attentive. Overall the experience was pleasant. Worth going back for another meal."
Love the afternoon tea set,"Love the afternoon tea set here,desserts are not as sweet just nice for the palate , all very well portion recommend to come here in the afternoon"
An awesome 1st birthday party,"Exceptional service by Kannan and his team at Marmalade Pantry Downtown Peck Seah. From planning and preparation, all through to the execution, Kannan was incredibly accommodating to our requests. Under his leadership, the entire team worked seamlessly to ensure a smooth flow of our birthday celebration. They went out of their way to assist us in decorating the event venue. Our dessert table was also put together by the experienced team, not forgetting the delicious buffet spread and sweets by Marmalade Pantry's chefs.

Marmalade Pantry's food never disappoints. And so does the team behind Marmalade Pantry Downtown, as well as the recently tastefully-renovated outlet. We will not hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for an event venue."
3D 2N Staycation at Hotel Oasia Downtown,During our staycation had breakfast on 13 Oct but still prefers to have breakfast on the club lounge as its not too crowded.
Solemnisation Ceremony at Marmalade Pantry Downtown,"Held my Solemnisation Ceremony for over 50 people on a sat afternoon.

I had mobility issues (leg fracture) and the staff helped with everything! From placement of wedding arch and furnitures, to simple yet important things like putting up my event signage. They even went the extra mile to steam iron the table cloth of my signing table! Everything was completed before arrival of guests, and there wasn’t any disturbance while the ceremony was ongoing.

Food was served promptly after, and service was great! Kannan and team were friendly, and went the extra mile to ensure things were in order. Received good feedback from the guests and they loved the cupcakes. Had a pleasant experience myself!

Oh and they have the best Hokkien Mee!"
Nice ambience and great food!,"I hosted a surprise baby shower for my friend at The marmalade pantry located in downtown. The location is super convenient just a stone throw away from Tanjong Pagar MRT. We opted for the afternoon high tea. The food and the teas served for the high tea was nice, the ambience was perfect too for the event. They even helped to customize the menu according to our dietary requirements. I wanted to make the event special for my friend, so one of my request was to allow us to decorate the table we reserved in a baby shower theme. The restaurant manager Albert was quite accomodative to my request. He clarified all my questions promptly and was very supportive. He also included a complimentary piece of cake for my friend. All in all we had a great time. Thank you Albert and your crew for making this event a memorable one for us :)"
Delightful Hokkien Mee and Mac N Cheese at Marmalade Pantry,Marmalade offers a wide selection of food options and I was trying the Asian menu Hokkien Mee for the first time. The other family members tried the time tested western menu and we were all happy with our choices. The simple dish of Mac N Cheese was subtle and flavourful.
Close to perfection,"Made a Chope reservation which was easy. A follow up call to Kannan ensure there would be a slice of cake of my choice for my wife’s birthday celebration the next day.

Food was amazing and service was prompt and attentive. Looking forward to my return visit."
Hearty meal at The Pantry,"Staff are very helpful and patience to explain and introduce the dishes and their promo order. Enjoy the food very well, enjoy some cost saving using entertainer app."
Great ambience and love the food,Ordered Mac n Cheese and Breakfast Bowl. Both are amazing. Staffs are friendly and I love the ambience there. We used the entertainer app so it’s really worth it. Thank you for the cheesecake too. Will come back again.
Ok. Nothing special. Nothing extra,Are here with friends recently. Only average. Nothing special and can’t say any of our food was any way memorable. Would prefer More choice also. Far better eateries in the locality. For what it is it’s expensive and not worth it. I left hungry it didn’t satisfy me at all. Felt portions were small.
Service staff were not attentive and food standard was deplorable at their premium prices. AVOID!,"The service staff consisted of mostly trainees.
The manager/supervisor were not attentive which resulted in slow service. Had to wait for the check and took them a while to process payment.

This is my second meal at marmalade pantry and the food standard which I have experienced in the ION outlet was waaayyyyy better.

Roasted chicken was very dry and tasteless despite being stuffed with ingredients.
The spicy crab pasta was soggy and the crab and sauce tasted like it was out of a can...Campbell’s came to mind. Please do not add nuts to your food and not inform customers as some might have a deadly allergic reaction to nuts. Also pine nuts definitely don’t go well with spicy crab. Have you had Singapore Chilli Crabs with nuts?!

I am very disappointed with the food and service standard at marmalade pantry. This is not worthy of the premium pricing for your food and service. I should have listened to my wife and have dinner at Chinatown food centre. The steamed fish head is to die for and pricing is very reasonable with prompt and no fuss service.

The only saving grace was the 20% discount we got from paying with MasterCard. But it was still a hefty price to pay for sub standard food and service."
Good quality food with great ambience,"The fact that the restaurant was right at the main door was a bonus.
The high ceiling interior which was within Oasia Hotel was very welcome.
Looking out there was a lot of green with the green wall that this hotel hosted.
We had the barramundi which was excellent with firm texture with a little bite. The fish sat atop a bed of green basil cousous and surrounded by the most succulent heirloom tomatoes. Worth the price of $28 for this dish.
The other dish we had was the lobster mushroom risotto. Again, it did not fail in the taste and presentation department. Loads of mushrooms were in the risotto and a big one sat on top. The shaved cheese was also a nice touch. To top it off we had the coffee which was a tad too strong and the carrot cake which was moist but too sweet.
Overall, a pleasant dining experience and worth coming back to try the rest of the menu."
Good food and portion. Just a little pricey,"Food is good as usual, including a good portion. However price can be a little pricey. Service and location is pretty good too"
Wonderful Birthday Party held at The Marmalade Pantry!,"We hosted a one year old high tea birthday party at The Marmalade Pantry and we were wonderfully surprised with the efficiency and impeccable service provided by the entire team.

They were able to cater to all our needs and ensured that the Guest experience throughout the event was seamless. Nothing was too much trouble for the Restaurant Manager Kannan and his team, he was very flexible and it allowed us to plan the event easily from start to end.

The food was lovely, the MAC & cheese was tasty and all flavours were well balanced, Special thank you to Chef Jonathan for ensuring all was smooth.

The newly renovated restaurant is indeed a perfect venue to host events and is highly recommended for family parties & events."
Strongly recommend,Food is excellent .especially the hokkien fried noodle totally capture my taste buds.staff is polite and service is great. Definitely will be back more often.
One of our favourite restaurants for a family dinner!,"One of our favourite restaurants for a relaxed family dinner is the Marmalade Pantry located on the ground floor of the Oasia Downtown Hotel at Peck Seah Street. The high ceiling of the restaurant gives it a very spacious feel which helps to foster a relaxed and comfortable ambience.

The menu presents a variety of choices from soups, salads, pasta and sandwiches to grills and local food. My favourite items are the Club Sandwich (maybe the best club sandwich I have had) and the delicious and tasty Spicy Crabmeat Linguine. My son (a health nut) always has the Mexican Chicken Salad which he highly recommends. My wife loves the Char Siew Kurobuta Pork Belly.

To complement the great food, the service is excellent, cheerful and most attentive under the supervision of Albert the Captain/Maître d’, always making our dining experience a most pleasant one. We must especially commend Esther, our regular server who always sees to our every need with a smile!

So we have many good reasons to keep returning to the restaurant for our weekend dinners!"
Great!,"We come here about at least once a month, maybe more often, on Saturday evenings. It's on the first floor right next to the Hotel lobby. The high ceilings give a sense of spaciousness and relaxation. The food is consistently very good, and service is friendly and attentive."
