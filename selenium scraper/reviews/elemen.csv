Great Food,"I have been at this outlet many times and this time round, I selected the Lunar New Year special set, and it was great."
One of the best vegetarian restaurant in city,Serving unique fusion vegetarian food that whets your tastebud. No worries about starchy food because you will not feel n taste any starchy element.
Friends cny gathering,Love the food but initially they served the food too fast and were like catching a train. They heard us and later part served at a more reasonable pace
Good vegetarian food,We go to elements often as the food is good and different to the usual vegetarian choices. Also it is very reasonably priced.
elemen @ Millenia Walk,elemen ranks high as my favourite vegetarian restaurant. My kids especially loved the ice cream & brownie desert!
slow service of main course,"This was the 2nd visit, both time we experienced very slow serving of the main course. The food was good. I purposely park at the Milienia car park but at the casher did not offer the free car park ticket though I must admit it was my fault that I forgot to ask!"
Great experience,Went there to celebrate birthday. Asked for a candle on the tiramisu but got a nicely decorated plate with ice cream in addition to the candle. Pleasant surprise! Very friendly staff. Enjoyed the dinner. Thank you elemen‚Äôs staff at Millenia Walk!
The food was just ok.,"The serving was very slow. There were 4 of us. The last main course was serve one hour after we placed the order and we had to remind the staff a few times to check on our orders. There‚Äôs something very wrong inside the kitchen in the sequence of food preparation despite there were 4-5 staff in the kitchen. I‚Äôm addition, there were 4-5 staff attending to customers at the tables. Very disappointed!"
"Pretty Food, less than awesome service","First, we wasn't allowed in when we arrived 10mins earlier. At the reservation time, we found out we had to queue to get in, even with a reservation, which defeats the purpose of a reservation.

The food was pretty, very instagrammable! Kind of fusion western mix vegetarian.
Portions are small, so go for the 8 course set.

There was a 30minutes wait for dessert, even though everyone else who came in after us had theirs. It was set meal dessert, everyone was having about the same thing. Then another wait for them to process the bill. Seems like they are understaffed."
Standard dropped,Service standard dropped tremendously! Food standard also dropped by little bit! Only one given full utensil! Serving of food missed out one course!
Good First Experience,"We made a reservation, as we noted there was always a queue at this restarant and decided to try it out. We had the set meal, as we felt it was more value. The Mushroom Pasta & Fried Rice were really good. I loved the soup too. Overall, a great dining experience and the food was great. Atmosphere was not bad, albeit a bit noisy once the restaurant was full."
Elemen @ Suntec,Took us almost 2 hours to get our 8-course dinner. One set was serve almost half an hour later! There were only 3 serving staff.
Great food but poor service,"I really enjoyed the food over here as they are awesome! However, service is pretty bad as they are not organized. Long wait for the food and constant reminder is required."
My time spend at Elemen Restuarant,Reservation was very well done. Waited just a while and soon I was guided to my table by the waiter. Order my food and it came very fast.
Excellent vegan food,Delicious food made from vegetables and fruits that mimics meat taste. Food images on menu truly depicts actual food.
Slow in service!,"Service was VERY slow! This restaurant was recommend by a dear friend. Staff, 1 asst manager, was very IMPATIENCE. Definately WONT be BACK! We left as one of main dish n soup not ready and our clock shows 9pm."
Gathering at Elemen,"The food is good. Staff is very friendly. However we were only allowed to stay for 1 and half hours, even when the restaurant wasn't full. Wish they can be more accommodative towards this rule.
Also I have to pay $240 for booking, which is kinda odd. They have yet to refund me."
Best vegan but taste non vegan restaurant,Repeatedly visits. Great for non vegan that wants to eat healthy. Everyone I bring raves over the food.
Disappointed,"The food is good enought, 3/5. You get what you pay for.

But the disappointing part was the waiting time for the food (35mins), please note that we have inform the staff after 15mins, for 4 times. and what we got was ""they should be coming"".

The restaurant was busy and slow service with rushed interactions was expected for a restaurant at this level.
But the interaction with the manager was BIZAME.

The manager was extremely rude. It was clear they did not care to lose us as customers."
"Severely Understaffed, Staff unattentive","When i arrived at the restaurant, we were promptly escorted to our private room. After that, we were pretty much left alone, and what was worse is that the server/waiter simply dumped the dishes on the table and expected us to pick it up across the table! They did not explain to us what were the dishes, and left the room hurriedly without closing the door. I had to stand up from the other end of the table to close the door several times in order to have a proper conversation. This is repeated throughout the dinner service and for every dish that is served. Absolutely poor service by the staff, but the saving grace was the amazing and delicious food."
Reservation via Chope,I can't cancel the reservation via Chope and I've called many times to the restaurant from 3pm to 6:30pm nobody pick up the call
Reservation easy and fast,The app is very easy to use and reservation was done within a minute. Thanks for this simple and useful app.
Fusion vegetarian meal,Wanted to give a treat to a visiting overseas friend. Decided on elemen as it was something my friend hasn‚Äôt tried before in singapore.
On my list of blacklisted places to eat,"Was asked to order using QR code. After 1 hour 15 minutes, the first dish was served. Drinks were not served. It was just four pax (not big group). After waiting for 1 hr 30mins, then checked with us whether we placed order. Hello. We made reservations. And we placed order via QR code as instructed. Order showed ok. You should have checked with us much earlier if your system is not up-to-standard and not when it‚Äôs last order time.

Really angry and dissatisfied with service"
Poor service quality and food,We waited for too long for food to be served. 1. Food was cod. 2. Took too lon to serve 3. Food was ready but no one serve 4. Pizza was not well cooked.
Delicious Food but Slow Service,"Elemen is a popular vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. The food is generally natural and wholesome and does not embrace mock meat. Its menu offers excellent, creative selection vegetarian dishes.

I was invited for sunday lunch with my friend's family.
We ordered 8 course meal which is more economical than ala carte. Some of the dishes were:
- truffles bread stick with blue berry yogurt dip
- wild mushroom & white truffle pizza
- wild mushroom soup
- quino salad
- kale tofu & black truffle rice
- black truffle porcini pasta
- avacado roll

The food was elegantly plated & a feast to the eyes.
A few highlights
- the avacado roll is fantasic
- the kale tofu & black truffle rice is my favourite. The rice is served in a bambo tube was full of flavor.

There were a few downside
- the drink was served after appertise & drink
- the main course were served between 20 mins apart
- quino salad did not have enough dressing & we improvised with the berry yogurt dip
- we found the mushroom soup too thick to our liking & would fill you up immediately . This could be due to our personal preference too.

Overally we had enjoyed our food minus the slow service

It is impressive that the restaurant true to its core & serving wholesome meatless recipe.

I would definately be back!

Do note 5 course set meal is not served during weekend.

Image Slide,"Ate at the same branch few times, not sure if there's change in management or the person in charge of the branch been replaced but utterly disappointed. Noticed a server almost knocked into a patron before me. The same server broke some utensils as he cleared table behind our table while we were at 2nd item. When he went on to clear another table few min later, dropped cutlery. A staff turned to him, the server responded 'Not my fault'. We were probably at 2nd last item, a staff literally shouted across the restaurant to his co-worker 'Hold it !'. Had tea, noticed that drinking cup wasn't washed properly with some stains. Lastly, kind of an embarrassment for my partner. Would like to know if elemen has opted for cashless payment these days cos the restaurant rejected when we opted to pay in cash. So if patrons have no credit card, how would he or she settle for his or her bill ?"
Bad taste,"Taste quality fell tremendously, service was very bad and they kept rushing food out with no time sensitivity. Have been going there for years and this is poorest quality my family and I have tasted.
Appetisers we‚Äôre ok but the main courses were bland with no flavour, pizza was dry, noodles were tasteless. Brownie texture was rough and hard. Tiramisu was dry. the waiters were playing a fool instead of focusing. They rushed courses and more than 1 course was on the table at once the worse was my girlfriend having 3 courses on the table. Waiters also forgot to serve apple cider and we had to ask."
Bad service and inflexible,"Service wasn't good. One of my guest doesn't eat egg and the kitchen wasn't flexible with that. In the end, we gace up and went off for another restaurant."
Food and services,"Great food, excellent service by Nicholas and his team. Very customer centric resulting great dining experience.üëçüëçüëç"
A Hasty Dinner,"We were told to finish our dinner by 7pm as there are 2 seating. However, it was like only 6.40pm and the manager was like rushing us to finish our dinner although there are still 20 mins before 7pm. He looked unhappy with us and kept looking at our table as we were still chatting. Hence, my friend and I did not really enjoy our dinner at all."
Pleasant experience,Arrived early evening on Thursday. Restaurant was empty and we were the first to arrive. Service staff was highly considerate for my elderly mum and recommended suitable dishes for her. My mum enjoyed the food in this first visit without even noting it's vegetarian food. For me it was my second visit. I decided to take up the membership for future visits.
Poor Food,"The restaurant was empty but the quality was very poor. The soup was served cold, the desert was cold too and the drink came half way through the meal. Service was slow."
Awesome!!!,"I love to visit Elemen!! The foods is delicious, the customer service is polite and friendly!! I have joined the member and def will visit again!!!"
Impressed from 1st bite to the last,"The experience was likened to fine-dining without burning a hole in my pocket. The starters were already impressive, they raised every eye-brow, and inspired oohs and aahs from the ladies. Though they seemed to be short-handed, we were served faster than expected, and provided an introduction to each dish. That's fine-dining stuff. I bought their membership package that evening, and this is something I've never bothered to do. Check out all the attractive promotions on their website. It's really worth it."
One of the best vegetarian restaurants in Singapore,"My 3rd time here and I am amazed by the food presentation, quality and taste. Had the 8-course lunc leh set meal on a weekend. It wasn‚Äôt crowded, service was excellent and swift. The serving of food was really fast, so fast that my dining companion was rushing to finish her meal. But the full completion of the 8-course set meal took 1.5hrs, which explains the rushing. Extremely pleased with the quality of food, the presentation was so lovely and appetising as well. Money well spent. Definitely will come back again!"
Exceptional vegetarian allium free food! Fine dining at reasonable prices!,"I have been to this restaurant many times.I recently visited this place and having the 8 course set that gives you a starter, soup, main course, dessert, and drinks. Great deal for the price. I love the variety of mains available, and especially love the apple cider vinegar mid-meal as a palate cleanser. Never fails to impress anyone, even the most fussy meat eater friend, with their amazing food and service. Best vegetarian allium free food ever! Can‚Äôt recommend this place enough."
celebrating birthday,we only mentioned the above celebration in passing but the service staff (all of them) took to heart and served the dessert cake in the set meal beautifully decorated and with a lit candle. A small gesture but very heartwarming.
"Veggie food was very tasty and delicious and healthy . Busy , so expect customer service is bit delayed","Veggie food was very tasty and delicious and healthy . Busy , so expect customer service is bit delayed"
Poor service,"No matter how good the food was, the whole dining experience was brought down by the poor service. Waiting time was long despite empty tables in the restaurant, no one attended to the patronizers in the waiting queue hence no one understand what they were waiting for. We had to make our own assumption that we get attention only at the specific allocated dining time slot. Skeptical whether such arrangement will be sustainable in long run."
Rude service,"We arrived 11.30 & told we had inly1hr 30 mins for our meal. Two of us were served main course by 12.30 but my friend did not receive hers till 1pm! Desserts were not served & the captain told us ‚ÄòI give you till 1.20 to finish your meal. In short, gobble up your food in 20 mins. Such high-handedness & lacking finesse & graciousness."
Long waiting time for food to be served,The restaurant pretty shorthanded thus long waiting hours...we take away the food in the end. overall very frustrating experience as we have to keep approaching the waitress and chase for the food to be served.
disappointed,"I went for dinner with my friends and all of us had a very high expectation for our dinner gathering. However, the service was bad and our food was served at different time. We got our main course accordingly exactly after one of us finished the food. The kitchen seemed to prepare the food by batch."
Came through for me,"I hosted colleagues from Japan, Australia, as well as local colleagues who've been to Elemens before. It was an enjoyable lunch, although I would suggest some kind of mapping of the orders to a last name. Because everyone ordered, quite a bit of confusion ensued. Still, I think the staff handled it well."
Insanely terrible service. Fast-food restaurant Speed for 8 course menu.,"Super noisy restaurant - the staffs were sorting out a large tray of metal utensils on one dining table right smack in front of our table, making extremely annoying noises affecting our meal.

Speed is that of a fast food restaurant, my 8 courses were served almost all at once. I haven‚Äôt finished my soup and starter, yet the main course was brought over the the small table which can seat only 2 pax, leaving the table in a mess.

I have patronised this Elemen restaurant (several outlets) for many years, and I must say that their level of service has dropped to rock bottom. Inexperienced ‚Äúmanager‚Äù - young bespectacled chap in blazer; who doesn‚Äôt care about the customers‚Äô dining experience and allowed staffs to annoy diners with the loud metal utensils packing and cleaning at the centre of the restaurant.

Insanely horrible dining experience.

Do not recommend anyone to come here for business meals, or special occasions."
Delicious food items but service can be better,"It was an enjoyable dining experience. The restaurant was bright and spacious, food was beautifully plated and tasted wonderful. I personally feel the waiting staff could have spent a little bit more effort explaining the appetisers and the dishes, instead of serving and walking away each time. My friends and I felt the service was rather rushed and a little pressured to leave quickly after we are done."
Nice food and service,Everything is good except the way of ordering. 3 of us scan the e-menu using different phones and unable to place order. End up the staff gave us a tablet which is so much easier
Lunch,I have been going back to the outlet at Millenia Walk for more than 4 times now. Love it they‚Äôve a wide of variety of food. Introduced it to my non vegetarian friends and they loved it too. Service was excellent and food served timely. Couldn‚Äôt recommend a better place for lunch on a weekend!
Dinner on sat 11 June,Visited on Saturday for dinner. Food quality was of great disappointment. Service not great too. Not lightly will go back again.
"Nice Food, go for the set meal!","The ambience was pretty good. It's a popular restaurant, almost filled on a weekday evening. Go for the set meal which is more value for money! And the whole restaurant is very cold, be prepared!"
Amazing Dining Experience with Elemen,Definitely a great place for a high class vegetarian meal that will amaze your tastebud. Their set meal is definitely worth your every dollar spent.
Standard dropped,The very 1st time I went to the restaurant was pre covid. They staff were passionate and explained all the dishes. And recommended some.signature dishes as well. Now they don't real explaine and can't feel their passion.
Exceptional dining experience,"Service and menu selection was exceptional, and the food was beautiful. Was the perfect venue for entertaining some clients, and enjoyed every moment."
Great vegetarian restaurant,"Food is good as usual. Always my go to restaurant. Since we are there on Monday, crowd is less and service is good. i didnt have to wait long for our food. We had the 5 course set. I wish the portions are bigger though."
A worse experience than expected,"The waiters had an average attitude and felt like they wanted to finish their work quickly, you could tell they were busy. We were placed close to the kitchen and the entrance to the restaurant, despite having booked a table a few weeks ago, we did ask for a change of location but were refused. The food was average, nothing particularly good, and the value for money was OK. Will not return to this restaurant in future."
Improvement in quality of food and service,"The first time I visited Elemen@Millenia Walk two years ago, I was very disappointed with the quality of food. It was quite badly prepared with Tiramisu served in different sizes and double boiled soup that was served with only half left. The servicing staff looks too busy to care.

This time, the lady who serve us is very polite and give us priority to be seated instead of waiting at the reservation queue as we did arrive early but was told that the restaurant is very packed. I can understand why the restaurant is so packed because Elemen has not only modified their menu, quality of food has also improved. Double boiled soup was filled to the brim with lots of ingredients. My mum thoroughly enjoyed the soup.The tiramisu was served in equal portions and other regular dishes such as the kale tofu with rice set came with additional broccoli at the side. My family thoroughly enjoyed the dinning experience. Good job Elemen, keep it up!"
Elemen at Millennia Walk,"Food is good as usual. Service is disappointing. Missed out my order, and when I told the waiter, he walked away"
Most delicious vegetarian food,"Food are delicious, tasty and healthy too ! Like the 8 course dinner, from starter to dessert, all are special and yummy ! 5 star service given by the leader ! Well done, and keep it up."
Elemen @ Millenia Walk,"Despite reservation has been made, we have to queue for 30 minutes to be seated. Food is tasty but then again we have to wait for very long for our ala carte food to be served. We ordered 3 main courses and have to cancel 1 item as we do not have to wait anymore. 3 ala carte food items finished served to us and we finished eat. time taken 1hour 15 mins."
Excellent,Took my friends here for the first time and they loved it. Always freshly prepared meals. Clean simple interiors. Great staff. Always a pleasure to dine here
Not efficient,"I must say the food is very creative and I like their dishes, especially the 8 course set which I find really worth it. However, their service model is not efficient so some dishes came with perfect timing while others had a long gap which spoil the whole dining experience. But I must say Peter was really very courteous and make us feel welcome."
Lunch at Elemen at Milienia Walk,"We have enjoyed the delicious lunch at Elemen . Service is very good ! There were four of us, 2 of us were having Birthday celebration. They have fulfill our request for certain services . Overall good experience !"
Food standard seems to be falling,"I'm a regular at elemen and the standard at millennia walk were mostly impeccable however this visit proved other wise.

Perhaps a new trainee cook handled our food, I've got no idea.

The shrooms rice were usually deep in favour with a slight tinge of pepper, however both servings came rather bland. To describe the blandness would be alike thicken porridge that a recovering patient would consume.

The zajiang noodles was the highlight, the ""meat chunks"" were flakey on the inside, rather bland as well. The traditional za Jiang noodle should be well coated by flavourful dark sauce, ours came with inadequate sauce. Even after mixing it thoroughly, the sickly pale yellow noodles simply looked unappetizing.

Perhaps it's fusion cuisine and it would taste great we thought. Alas, a couple of bites into it, and we left half a bowl uneaten. It was simply a 2.5 / 10.

The final main was the mushroom pizza, it tasted great as usual. 10/10

It would be best to avoid that 2 dishes for now."
Use of Birthday voucher,"New dining concept, vegan. Light on tummy. Serving of food timing just right. Will come again & try other food."
"Food was decent, service wasn't","The set menu has good variety and the food was decent. The value is great.

However, the service wasn't. We knew there was a second seating and a limited time for our meal. The service staff made extremely sure that we were reminded although it was their slow service that made it difficult to finish within the time frame. It was our first time there, and did not know that payment was to be made at the counter and the service staff who cleared our last dishes did not inform us either. There was no table number/bill or the like for us to bring to the counter so we continued to be seated, masked up while trying to get the attention of the service staff for the bill. We were shortly told off in a raised voice by another service staff that he had customers waiting outside for our table and we should clear out. This left a bad taste and I will not return."
Good place healthy food,"Nice service from the staffs, always ready for attending requests, and great food! Me and my date went to the restaurant on the CNY cause we were vegetarian on that day and ordered the eight-course meals, which were satisfying in terms of portion, taste, and price (:"
Attentive n detailed,Attentive n detailed . I wore a jacket n waiter offered me warm water as he saw I was cold . Best truffle pizza
Poor service but good food,"Me and my friends went on a late Sunday night for dinner, there was not a lot of customers as expected for a Sunday night. We ordered for our meals and waited 45 minutes before asking the server for our food, end up the food choices were not even sent to the kitchen for preparation. It was also hard to get the server‚Äôs attention, some of them just ignored our calling even though they saw us calling them. The food was really good, but the service was quite bad.. it is only worth visiting for the food if you can wait."
Great lunch experience at Elemen Millenia,It has been some time since my friend and I had a meal at Elemen. We were enticed by the CNY set as well as the new items on their menu. Quality of food and service was up to our expectations. What I enjoyed most was the ability to chat with the Restaurant Manager who was very friendly and efficient. Our overall dining experience as excellent.
"Great food, great service","I was just surprised that despite reserving a place, I had to stand in line (it was fast moving though)"
Non-Vegetarians Love It Too!,Great food. Great Service. My hubby who goes for meat only finds the food here delightful. He likes the prata with curry and the pizza.
Service was disappointing,"We waited almost an hour for our mains when the next table, who came later than us were served the same mains we ordered. Asked a staff what happened to our mains and was told everyone else who ordered the same mains as us is waiting for it. Not just our table. Not apologetic at all. I understand it‚Äôs a public holiday and it‚Äôs a full house but such attitude is uncalled for and shows how poorly trained they are."
"Insufficient staff, food is not worth the price, long waiting time for food after ordering","Reserved a table at Elemen on 26 Dec 2021, 5.30pm. Had to queue for about 15min to enter the restaurant. Only 2 staff taking orders for a fully booked restaurant. The restaurant offered Christmas set. When I managed to get the staff's attention to take my table's order, we were told the Christmas set were sold out. The staff informed that only 5 sets were available for the diners. Hence, it will be first come first served basis. Amazed that the restaurant was fully booked for the day and there were no walk-in customers. The restaurant knew in advance how may diners it would be expecting. If it knew it had 5 sets left for the dinner guests before it commenced dinner at 5.30pm, why bother to put the Christmas set in the menu to disappoint your customers. If the restaurant knew only 5 sets were available and the place was fully booked, nothing being done to replenish the supplies? I had a tough time getting the staff's attention to order the food and our food was served 45 min later. To add, those who came or ordered after us were served first. To make the experience worse, the food tasted so so (I am being nice here). Nothing impressive. For the price that the restaurant charges, I will not recommend it. Overpriced, slow service and so-so food. The only good thing was that bill collection and payment was fast. I do not accord the distasteful experience on the staff. There are only 2 staff serving the tables. They also doubled up as kitchen helpers. The management can do better than this. Will not recommend this place."
No one picks up the phone at this location,"No one picks up the phone at this location and am unable to reserve even via Chope. Tried calling since 1130am and over 35 calls, I gave up as its 1247pm now on a Thursday 30 Dec 2021.

Worst customer service ever. At least I managed to get a table at Great World City outlet within a single call."
Nice Food,The food is awesome. There is lacking on the service. It probably due to manpower shortage. Only 3 serving staff on that day.
Efficient and thoughtful service,"Reserved a table here after the poor service at the PLQ branch. Indeed, great difference, the lady cashier/wait staff was prompt in leading me to a nice booth seat and each course followed smoothly one after the other. We had the 5 course set with a very piquant vegetable with rosemary in the centre. My friend's quinoa salad had a lovely dressing and the rice set with seaweed tofu quite delightful. My mushroom soup was good as always. We were even asked if we wanted sharing plates for my mushroom pizza, very thoughtful indeed.
An excellent meal though the tiramisu was a bit too creamy for my companion but the sea-salt caramel coffee quite made up for that."
Excellent veg food,"Excellent food, like the fact that they have maintained consistency. Definitely value for money. Only negative is getting a booking is tough"
Service needs improvement,"Went to the Millenia Walk outlet on 2 consecutive days. As customers, we perfectly understand the stress service staff face in the wake of Covid-19 restrictions. But the male manager seemed to be highly strung on both days and this would inadvertently affect other staff and customers. We would recommend the HarbourFront outlet as the staff there are generally more friendly and welcoming."
Almost starved to death waiting,"Title says it all, the service is extremely slow if you do not order from the set menus. The kitchen clearly prioritises the popular set items. So good luck if you order anything that is not being promoted."
Delightful lunch !,"Brought my colleagues for lunch n took the 5 course meal , n good review, especially the herbal soup! Interesting dishes which makes it so difficult to choose for each course!"
The desserts are very nice!,Visited the millennia walk outlet this evening and had the 5 course set meal. The service was good! However the black truffle porcini pasta mushroom was very very very salty! The Biscoff brownie was very nice!
Service is excellent,"Other than the service is excellent, the food in element is equally good as well. I love the atmosphere over there too. Hence, it was a satisfied experience overall."
Bad service,Service is bad. The manager (at millennia walk) was so impatience when you wish to make changes to the desserts! Wanted to.bring forward booking time. Tried calling for days but nobody answered!
The sushi was the highlight!,"My DD stopped eating meat in January so we decided to try out a few vegetarian restaurants, and Elemen was our first. We mostly liked what we ordered. My DD didn't like the appetisers and I wasn't a fan of the dry noodles but we both liked the tempura tofu and avocado sushi. The clear winner of the meal. The drinks were really nice: strawberry basil lemonade and strawberry tea (although in a very small pot)."
Good choice to introduce to 1st time vegetarian,Great food and service. My friend who is not a vegetarian is impressed with the food. This is one of my favorite place to introduce plant based options to my non vegetarian friends.
Terrible and horrible experience,Bad service. Slow service. Even already make reservation still need to 30 mins to go into the restaurant and wait another 1 hour for our food. Staffs are rude and impolite. Food quality also so so only. Will be no second time to this restaurant.
Service at elemen was before expectation. Disappointed.,Service at elemen was before expectation. Disappointed. So i don't think that we will dine there again.
Food is amazing,The food is amazing but some server might need to be more attentive Becus u can feel the unwillingly to pass your food or even u request for more tissue. The female server was good and very cheerful.. and still explain to me and my friend which are the first timer to experience the foods...
Good place good food,"Had a catch up dinner with old friends who are non vegetarians, they were the ones who recommended Elemen. Glad that all enjoyed their food heartily. Servings seems small at first, but at the end of our 5 course, we were full to the brim"
Lovely lunch,Have been to Elemen Millenia many times and have always enjoyed my meal as its consistent and tasty. Brought friends here to try and they enjoyed it too. They realise vegetarian doesnt have to be boring and tasteless.
Vegetarian Food can be tasty!,I like the the theme of fusion food There is Pizza next to the more traditional-looking white fungus peach jams. Quite appelling to the younger generation of diners.
Elemen Millenia Walk,"It is not the first time we dine in Elemen, it used to be good and that's why we keep on going back. However, it is a terrible experience in our recent encounter with the outlet in Millenia Walk which is the first time we dine there. It seems that they are terribly understaff, not only no response to the customers no matters how many time we raise our hands but also the waiting time for food is long. We have waited for more than a hour to get all our food and guess what, they are chasing us to finish the meal to set the table for next round, they told us to finish the meal in 10 minutes........If they need the table urgently, why don't they serve us the food earlier and faster. We are so disappointed with it and we will definitely not going back."
Nice fine dining-style vegetarian cuisine,"Family loved it! Food was good. Everyone loved the Maki rolls. Tasty and creative fusion between chinese, japanese and western cuisine. Slightly pricey for the small portions. Management of reservations queue was also chaotic with huge crowds crowding around the entrance waiting to be seated over the weekend. Seating time was also late despite reservations. Had wanted to order their special set meal on a weekend but was informed that the food will take longer and likely only be served after the regular meals are served.. Thought that defeated the purpose of having that special meal. Who would want their meals served only after all the other lunch partners have completed theirs?"
The serving of the food are too slow,"Well, they expecting I can finish my main course, dessert and my drink in 15 minutes.
The time allocation was 1:30 hours starting from 11:30am. They served the main course at 12:45pm.
They even forgot to serve my salad even I remind them three times with different staffs."
Elemen@Milenia Walk,"Food served was very slow though. It was a bit more salty than usual based on what we ordered. 8-course or 5-course meal is more worth the pricing and time spent. The serving size is still fine and rather big, considering the course meals. For people with smaller tummy and appetite, 5-course meal or just 1 main, 1 drink and 1 dessert will suffice. But I will go for the 5-course meal since more price worthy than ordering ala carte. For people with bigger tummy and appetite, 8-course meal is really worth the price, food and time spent. Pizza and Rice set can be quite tummy-filling so go for smaller main when ordering course meals, if you are not too hungry."
Poor Service & Extremely Slow Service,We were told upon entry at 5:30pm that our booking for 5:30pm meant that we had to vacate our table by 7pm. Fine with that as I had read that online when I made our reservations/booking. We ordered promptly as I had two elderly ladies with us & my young son; who were all very hungry/impatient to eat and go home early. All our food was served at intervals of 20-40 minutes between each dish. I had to repeatedly request for next dish to be served; only to be told each time ‚Äúit‚Äôs on the way‚Äù. That statement meant the dish would take another additional 20 minutes or longer before being served. It was past 7pm when our desserts were served. What a shame... as I had really enjoyed our previous meals at the GWC outlet.
Lunch visit with Family,"my wife, son and I have visited Elemen for dinner in 2020 and had a nice and different experience through the service and flavourful food. However, while we made a booking this time, due to staff shortage we were waiting outside in line with other families for 20 minutes before the next 'batch' was let in after cleaning tables. Then, only the buffet menu was available at a fixed fare with dishes we may not want to order as Ala Carte is only available in take away orders. We were also discouraged to order Ala Carte stating it will take time as the chef prepares together all types of dishes than in sequence of order. Lastly, we were the first in and to order, but our dishes took very long and one order was forgotten - with the waiters terribly busy. It came aftee 40 minutes and overall 2.5 hr noisy experience which was more like an outdoor busy open food area. While some dishes were certainly nice, a bit disappointed with food choice, service and it felt like a production shop environment this time. Hopefully better if we visit again. Thank you"
One of the best plant-based dining!,"The 8 course lunch set is value for money. Each item has been a great palate experience.
The only minus point was 1.5hours cap for dining and it's hard to savour every course in delight leisure. We had to quicken our speed for the last course when the captain came to our table to remind us."
"Good food, nice ambience & service",Had sets and a la carte. Good quality food and service. We are no longer members since they closed the Thomson Plaza branch and no other outlets in northern & central region.
"Instagrammable Food, but service was rushed",We ordered the 8-course set each and all items were visually stunning. The service felt rushed throughout right from the beginning when we were ushered in.
