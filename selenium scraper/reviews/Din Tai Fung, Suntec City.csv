Get the earl grey iced lemon tea!!,"Decided to try different stuff today so I ordered things that people are supposedly very impressed with:
(1). Steamed pork dumplings
(2). Fried rice with pork chop

Are these delicious? Yes, of course. But are they over the top? I’m afraid not. I have eaten steamed dumplings with better texture, better soup, better pork - in Singapore. I have eaten better fried rice (theirs is merely egg fried rice, is it really so fantastic??), better ingredients, better wok hei, even better pork chop.

What truly impressed me today surprisingly, was the earl grey iced lemon tea. Interesting fragrant tea used. And that huge ice cube was tea flavoured!!! And this is why I’m giving four and not three stars."
Good service,So far the food is consistent across the various outlets in Singapore. What impressed me of this outlet is the prompt & friendly service.
Great food,Really good especially for the price. You always know what to expect and their consistency is noticeable. Great dumplings for what you pay.
"Meets expectations for a typical DTF outlet, always here for XLB and Fried Rice","Well Din tai fung has always been a place that I will occasionally drop by once in a while. Tried both the DTF in Taiwan and Singapore and this is my personal take about what I would usually order when i visit any DTF outlets in SG:

1) I love their Seaweed Beancurd in a vinegar dressing as it is always the first dish that runs out whenever I drop by for dinner. Really good appetizer to kick start your meal here

2) Their Xiao long bao is definitely in my order list, as that is one of my checklist to clear whenever I visit DTF.

3) Their Fried Rice never fail to disappoint, will always order with the pork chop Though the portion of the pork chop varies time to time but the seasoning and taste is always the same for me

4) Their Prawn pancake is also something to order whenever you are here as well

Some personal tip for diners here:

- If you are ordering the Hot and Sour soup, and you want it to be spicier, you can just put the chilli oil that is given at your seat. It's basically the same chilli

- If you are a ginger lover, just be bold and ask for a bowl of Ginger, and that will save you some time to keep asking for the staff's help during peak hours.

Overall, if we are talking about the price that we are paying, it definitely falls within the mid-higher range for a Chinese dining experience. Food standards are decent, portion have been inconsistent but taste has been consistent."
😒,"Dingtaifeng, I don't know what to say. Drunken chicken dishes are getting smaller and smaller, but the price is getting more and more expensive, now even water ice water charges, you do not lack 0.5 yuan, is not used to this practice. In Japan and Hong Kong, I'm afraid it will be out of business. Everything tastes good, except the small steamed bun is particularly bad, the stuffing problem is very big, no wonder Michelin was picked the star. Business is really good, but many such stores, but also said to fall, I hope this can cherish the moment, cherish customers.鼎泰豐，要怎麼説呢。醉雞的盤子越來越小，價格倒是越來越貴，現在連白水冰水也要收費了，不缺你0.5元，就是看不慣這做法。在日本和香港，這麼做怕是會沒生意了。東西嗎味道都不錯，除了小籠包特別難吃，那個餡料問題很大，難怪米其林被摘星。生意確實很好，但很多這樣的店，也是説倒就倒了，希望這家可以珍惜當下，珍惜顧客。"
Taiwan vs singapore,"We live in taipei and there are a couple of differences:
- singapore has way more branches, food and service quality compromised
- the drunken chicken used are different, and much smaller
- pork fried rice also much smaller
- they charge for ice water here
- probably twice as expensive compared to taiwan"
For damplings lovers,"Din tai fung is a dumpling restaurant. The food is really good, and they have a really interesting diversity of dumplings, as main dish or as dessert. They even have Truffle dumplings !

The service quality is a little bit different than other occudental restaurants. I highly recommand this place."
Consistent quality,Back for another visit to DTF in Suntec. We arrived shortly after 12 and already there was a queue! But it wasn't as bad as other outlets and we didn't have to wait very long. Ordered from the usual selection of standard dumplings available on the menu. Great quality as always and efficient service.
Dumpling specialist,"They are a chain restaurant with speciality in different dumplings, fresh and good. Located in suntec mall, near many shops and hotels. They are fast and fresh."
Good fast food,This place was a little crowded. But the service was very quick. I had the pork chop and fried rice. It was really good. Quality fast food.
My favorite restaurant in singapore,"I really really enjoy the food served at DTF. Being a vegetarian is no hassle here, since they have good choices for vegetarians as well. This is a world famous Chinese restaurant and it never disappoints. Enjoy!"
Famous xiao long bao,Visited just after the lunchtime rush and got a table immediately. The service was quick and the pictures of each of the available dishes were helpful.
Good dumplings,"Recommended by local friends, we visited Din Tai Fung at Suntec City.

Lovely setting with the same menu anywhere else, their dumplings are so good that we are quite content with the foods we ordered.

The only problem was that we ordered more than we could eat and ended up overeating."
Constantly good,"Different location, same good quality food. Plus less no wait for a table! Was in the mood for a light dinner so ordered oriental salad and Xiao long bao. Hit the spot"
"Great Food, Great Service","Went there with a rather large group today, they served their food very quickly even during peak hours which impressed me! They were also very attentive in filling our cups with tea whenever they were finished. Had an enjoyable time there with my mates!"
"Great Food, Great Service, Great Ambience",Had a business lunch at DTF in Paragon. Waited about 15mins for our table. The receptionist was patient and always had SMILE on her. That is hardly to be seen nowadays in a busy restaurant. Our orders was served in time. Every tables were expecting fast service during lunch period. One of our dim sum order was served wrongly. The staff handled it well. We didn't wait too long for the right dish to be served. It is a great challenge to organize such a big and busy restaurant. Well done everyone.
Fantastic,Totally organized you don’t have to wait long and the food is outstanding this is my 5th time at this location always consistent
Great Basic Dim Sum,"This is a chain with a number of locations. It is perfect for an easy lunch or dinner without the pretense or fancy prices. Lots of great dim sum to choose from (watch them make it right in the window). We had shrimp and pork dumplings, fried won-tons and spicy noodles and it was a great meal at very reasonable prices. Two beers cost more than the food."
My favorite Din Tai Fung,This has always been my favorite from its original branch in Taiwan up to Singapore. The food is always consistent and I love it! Xiao Long Bao will always be my favorite 😋
"Frenetic, fun and fast food","Great buns, delicious dumplings, moreish fried rice, the tastiest Spring Rolls, so many snacks it's bewildering, and all at reasonable prices. A confusing ordering system to first time customers, you stand outside, take a pencil and order form and tick off your order from the menu boards. Then you hand it in and wait for your number to illuminate in the restaurant window. It took us about 10 minutes on a busy Sunday evening so we felt it was a reasonable wait in the shopping mall.

It's not a posh diner it's just a busy eating place. There are many Din Tai Fung restaurants in Singapore and around the world too. Don't be put off by that, it's all cooked fresh and not defrosted! Our bill name to £41 - no alcohol - and we ordered way too much food and handed two untouched courses to a family on an adjacent table."
Quick & Fresh,"Always a good sign when packed with locals. Easy to read menu, pencil in what you want and enjoy. Great fresh dumplings, excellent rice and good service. For a quick bite this is the place."
Great Dim Sum in Suntec City Mall.,"Having previously enjoyed eating at a branch of ""Din Tai Fung"" in Shanghai (China) when I saw Din Tai Fung in Suntec City when in Singapore it was an obvious choice for a Dim Sum dinner.
I love the fact you can see the chef's preparing and steaming the Xiao Long Bao in the 'kitchen' from inside and outside the restaurant through the large glass window panes. The menu is great with plenty to feast on... I went for traditional Pork Xiao Long Bao which was only SG$10.30 for 10 pieces, which were excellent. I also treated myself to 1 piece of the Pork & Truffle Xiao Long Bao at SG$5 a piece, but it was worth it as it was both delicious and delicate. I also had some Hot & Sour Soup (SG$9) and some very tasty Stir-Fried Pea Shoots (Dou Miao) with Pork Strips (SG$13.80) which were great mixed with some chili paste and soy sauce. This is a big casual restaurant / cafe and it was very busy and yet service was still very good. I had a 20 minute wait for a table at 8:30pm on a Saturday night. Highly recommended for some great Dim Sum."
Popular place at lunchtime,Lucky we got there before the big lunchtime rush. There was a big queue to get in. I can understand why as the food was really good and the service was fast and prompt. Tasty Chinese food
Good,"Very good food, reasonably priced, the waitress English wasn’t particularly good but we managed ok. Sweet and sour pork recommend with large portions, and steamed rice is available although not on the menu. The only little thing that lets it down is the beer is served warm and they give you ice to put into it. But generally would recommend and good if you’re staying next door in mandarin marina where prices are extortionist"
"Nice, simple lunch","We ate here on our second day - and I thought we were going somewhere unique! Actually, Dim Tai Fung is all over town. You’re rarely ever more than a five minute walk from me, or at least it feels that way.

We had a short 15 min wait for a table for six at lunchtime, but once inside the service was speedy and the food very good. My mug of complimentary jasmine tea was constantly topped up -despite my attempts to finish it before the pot came round.

It’s a relatively cheap and casual eat. But if you’re not used to Din Tai Fung, it’s a chain well worth trying - and usually I do everything to avoid a chain."
Typical Din Tai Fung,Spacious but simply decorated restaurant. With the common menu all over the world. The standard of the food is good. Tried the steamed dumplings and the noodles.
GREAT!,"Didn’t know what to expect when we walked in and were handed a menu and paper with dishes listed to place our order. But, we were pleasantly surprised when ordering was very easy and efficient. In a few minutes, our order arrived. What a treat! The dumplings were delicious as was the soup and bar. Very happy we stumbled here after touring on the near by Big Bus hub. We liked this restaurant so much, we returned the next next. There are several locations around Singapore. Fast service and good food."
First timer.,Great food Great service wonderful place to eat and enjoy Asian food. The staff looks and is professional and very courteous.
Amazing tasty dumpling 👍,"We had a great time at elegant fine dining restaurant.
Dumpling is super tasty and many varieties of type to choose. I like the jasmine tea so much. Make me fresh after Long day before enjoy the meal.
Restaurant is clean ,elegant and staffs are very efficient.
You can get the experience of how to make the dumpling from the open space kitchen near the entrance."
“GOOD FAST FOOD”,We attended this restaurant at a busy lunchtime. The good thing here is that the kitchen is open so that one could see the orders being prepared. Inexpensive good food. I would eat here again.
Lovely as expected,"Every branch retains its charms and true to the brand name is excellent and phenomenal. The food quality is top notch and be in any branch or country, you will feel the same. The menu is broadly the same. The pork noodle soup, egg rice, chicken dim sums, greens, and plain as well as chilli noodle were simple excellent.

The service is top notch and they are kind enough to tell us if the food was sufficient. Can’t get tired of this place. Just because they have so many branches does not make them just another franchise type place. They are excellent"
As expected in Din Tai Fung,"As part of the Din Tai Fung chain, it offers the standard menu and quality of food as expected everywhere else. We loved the egg fried rice! And of course the famous xiao long bao. We came around 2:30pm and the queues were not so bad but there were so many items not available on the menu which were disappointing. The stewed beef and hand pulled chillies noodles were also our favourites."
The BEST Xiao Long Bao!,"Have been back 3 times in 3 days to this institution! The pork xiao long Bao are amazing, so are the chili oil dumplings and the pork chop on fried rice."
Best-tasting Xia Long Bao!,"As always, their xia long bao hits the spot! We also ordered the shrimp dumpling and drunken chicken and both were great tasting as well. Service was also good as the waiters were very attentive to our needs."
Best Dumplings in the city ( even for vegetarians),"One of my favorites ... this place serves you steamy dumplings vegetable , chicken , crab , shrimp and there are a lot of meat options you can try here. You should try refreshing lemon grass drink over here. In Rice and noodles also they have a lot of options but we usually stick to egg fried rice which is so far the best in city. We go this place once in 2 week for sure."
My favorite is Stuffed Dates at Din Tai Fung,"Every time I visited Singapore, I visited the Din Tai Fung for simple lunch or dinner.

Despite its wide choices on the menu, I only ordered dumplings of different sorts.

This time, we are two fine diners and we have ordered
* sour and hot soup
* chili dumpling
* steamed dumpling
* ramen
* Dates stuffed with white sticky rice
The last dish is my favorite for it is a hot dessert which is not served in the same restaurant in Hong Kong.

Same superb standard every time, except that I do not understand why drinking a tea is not a complimentary treat from the restaurant..,

The total bill was S$49.08 which included 10 percent service charge and 7% VAT.

English menu is available but the bill is in pure Chinese characters."
good food...but service could be better,"First time to Din Tai Fung...the food is really good and they have some good vegetarian option too..

However, felt that the service could be improved as there were hardly anyone to help. Guests are left pretty much to themselves and one needs to figure out everything by their own."
Love the food,"Have always loved the food at Din Tai Fung it’s so yummy and this restaurant didn’t disappoint. The service was ok, the staff are not overly friendly or helpful but they weren’t terrible either."
Must stop for dim sum and dumpling lovers,"Love going there for lunch as food is delicious regardless if you have dumplings, rice or noodles. Great for a lunch stop with friends or colleagues."
Feels like lacking of something,"As a native Cantonese /Chinese, feels like the food is lacking of something but couldn’t tell. The bao is soso, beef is also so so."
super speciality restaurant,Very fast serving minimalistic restaurant. Wonderful tasting food. Vegetarianchoice limited but good.
Not as good as other Din Tai Fung,"As always, I was pleased to find a branch of Din Tai Fung on my travels, and went for dinner one evening. The menu seemed very limited compared to other branches which made ordering more challenging.
It was OK, but not superb as it should be...."
Yummy Dumplings,You'll find hundreds of great reviews on Din Tai Fung. What I love the most on their Singapore menu is the Veg Dumplings. Being a vegetarian in a nonvegetarian family - I love this. Not all the international locations have it though.
I want more!,"We wanted some dumplings while visiting Singapore, and my local friend recommended this place. It was just what we needed!

First, you have to know how to queue for this place. It's different. We were standing in a line, until someone saw us and told us we had to go get a number. So thankful for that! When you arrive, you need to go right up to the receptionist and get a number.

At the same time, you also get the menu and you can begin making your dinner selections. You can always add more on, but it is nice to be able to sit down, and hand over your paper and just wait for the food to arrive.

We ordered dumplings and buns - both were amazing. The vegetables were okay; not much flavor.

We wanted to go back at least one more time before we left Singapore, but alas we didn't get to. I'm still jonesing for some dim sum!"
Tasty dumplings for lunch,"Quite some time since I was last in Din Tai Fung, and the first time I've been to this particular outlet in Suntec. We were able to make a reservation so no need to queue, and it was quite busy at lunchtime. Food took some time to arrive but it was worth the wait - all very tasty, and especially the soup dumplings. Well worth another visit."
Restaurant that prioritize people who cut queue.,"The queue post located in the front of the restaurant is useless. The scene is this, a bunch of people queue and wait at the q post there, while another bunch cut the queue and take their queue numbers from the receptionist (by the name of XiaoChuang) When I asked the receptionist do I need to queue up and collect the q number, she said yes. Yet in front of us a few person cut the queue to get the q number from her and she blatantly in front of us issue the numbera. When I commented on it to her she chose to ignore. DTF'' service is getting from bad to worse. Simply atrocious."
One of the Top Ten Best Restaurants - as the claim goes,"It may be a stretch to say one of the top ten best restaurants in the world, as the claim goes, but good, clean place for good tasting dumplings. I tried the Chicken and Pork steamed dumplings and tasted very good. Order from a list and paid at cashier. Was there late afternoon so no wait but otherwise expect a queue."
"Outstanding Chili Crab and Pork Xiao Long Bao, and No Wait!","We always enjoy Din Tai Fung, and always expect a wait. We were so surprised that this branch, in Suntec City, had no wait at dinner time. The servings of soup-filled dumplings, as well as those with shrimp and pork, were perfectly prepared; service was cheerful and efficient. The steamed Chili Crab and Pork Xiao Long Bao were outstanding."
The BEST Dumplings,"If you love Dumplings, this is the place. Lots of choices and just so tasty. We didn't have a bad one and they have a Dumpling for everyone. No one goes hungry!
You order off a card and they bring them out as they are ready, which is great so nothing gets cold and you get a variety as you eat.
We had to Stop eating as we just could have kept going, but it was enough. the food is so good, you just don't want to stop. I'm totally serious....

Enjoy the Soup Dumplings - amazing experience"
Amazing authentic restuarant,"Reat dim sam, gr3at soup wuth noodles and pork. Service quiet efficiant qnd friendly. Pay at cashier at the end, mark what you like on a page with pen"
Good Food,"This restaurant is a little intimidating. It is Taiwanese Dim Sum and there is a lot of guesswork for a foreigner. Service was spotty. Considering how messy Dim Sum can be it was strange that napkins were essentially tiny squares of toilet paper. The food was good, though. Watching the chefs in the open kitchen was fun and reassuring. Prices were a little high."
Overrated Review,"Ranked as one of the world’s Top Ten Best Restaurants is not necessarily means that the taste of the food here extraordinary. As for me,you can have dimsum or dumplings in other place with cheaper price and more delicious."
"Amazing food, pretty good service",Follows the model of all the Din Tai Fung restaurants. Food is fantastic. Prices very reasonabl. Could have eaten everything on the menu. Service was good. I'd go back
Authentic dumpling place!,"If you are fond of dumplings Din Tai Fung is the place for you. Their dumplings with soup fillings are amazing. Service is good and the food is reasonably priced.
By the time we reached they had run out of chicken so make sure you get there at a decent time (around 8 pm). Also I would not recommend this place for vegetarians as their food options are fairly limited."
Worst service!,"Advertised for 10-15mins wait, but took more than that! Since we were hungry, we waited. Then we sat down, turned out ever worst for our orders to come. First order came after 15mins then longer n longer for the rest of the order. Funny thing was the steam dessert (red bean 35mins to cook) came before our last 3 orders! It was the worst experience we ever had for a Chinese restaurant. All they said was sorry as they were busy, given us 10% off! What was that for anyway. We will definitely not visit this place again as there are plenty other restaurants around."
"Great food, decent pricing","We had dinner here twice. Not the rosiest place but the food is great. The chicken soup with noodles was a delicious item for the kids, we ate dumplings and gyoza. Great pricing."
Order the Xiao Long Bao!,I love this restaurant. There are multiple locations in Singapore and other cities in Asia. I have eaten at several of them and have never been disappointed.
Awesome First Restaurant in Singapore,"You visit a foreign city, you are on your own; question ""Where do I eat?"". Our friends were in Singapore two weeks before we arrived and told us about this restaurant. When we arrived at the restaurant we realized the hostess gives patrons a check off menu to order from. Our first reaction was how do we know what to pick? Not to worry! They have a board on display with a picture and description of many dishes. We placed our order, and waited to be called. Once seated it was a wonderful experience watching other patrons, try using chop sticks (regular utensils are available) and enjoying our food. We had soup, spring rolls and dumplings, very good. We were too full for desert although they did look good. Alcohol is not served and I did not see anyone with their own bottle. If you are going for dinner get there before 5:30 PM; otherwise, there will be a wait."
Lunch at Taiwanese Restaurant,"Went for Lunch at Din Tai Fung at SunTech city on Sunday 4 March.We were early but had to wait to seated as there was long line of diners. Very orderly and efficient method. Different categories (say single , ,3 diners and so on) were given diferent wait list numbers- efficient way !Had hot and sour soup,Prawn fried rice,duck wantons.Tried some of the hot sauces- confess the sauces were HOT -spicy.
Service ,seating was excellent."
Our favourite restaurant,"Every time we visit Singapore, we eat at Din Tai Fung. Love this restaurant and their food. We’ll keep coming back."
Very Delicious,"Pretty impressive restaurant - must visit. Extremely busy but very efficient, maybe the only inconvenience is small space while sitting at the table, but so very delicious and if you really want to have the best taste of asian cuisine - you must have this stomach feast. BTW the drinks - cocktails were very delicious. Highly recommend!"
great food and ambiance,"like all other din tai fungs, their lines were long but it was worth the wait. Food as expected was excellent, service could be better but it doesn't spoil the experience."
HEAVENLY,"We were impressed with both the precision of those making dumplings through the glass window - and the accolades given by the New York Times or some similar publication - so we decided to try this restaurant for ourselves.

We had a 15 minute wait until a table was available - and another 15 until our meal was served.

We ordered, quite simply, pork and vegetable won-ton soup.

Our verdict? Perfect!!

We await the day Din Tai Fung comes to East Auckland, New Zealand."
Good dumplings for lunch!,"Din Tai Fung has a outlet in Suntec city mall. Was there for lunch and do not need to Q unlike most other outlets which was great. Order the usual crab meat dumplings, prawn fried rice and fried pork chop. Did not disappoint as the standard remain good!

"Good Food, Bad Service","The dumplings there are really good. They have some juice inside which is really nice. Not only the dumplings, there is Chinese Fried rice. All of the food there was exemplary. On the other hand, the service of the waiter there is poor. They even spilled hot tea on me. That sounds personal, but every time I go there I hear dishes falling on the floor."
Good food. Good relationship price- food,I was with my family one Saturday November 2017. We ordered lots of dim sum and some rice. Really nice. Food good and well served and everything very clean. We will go back. They have room to improve in the service. Quite mechanical I would say. I recommend the place. Go with time because it is crowded and you will have to queu at lunch.
Not living up to reputatiovn,"After friends had raved about dtf as one of the go to places to eat in Singapore we were disappointed. The girl at the front counter had difficulty with English. Our wait staff didn't explain the ordering process, the food came out in dribs and drabs, was relatively tasteless, they managed to get two of the dishes wrong, and for a snack it was expensive. Not impressed."
Good dim sum and good price,Nice selection of dim sum and good value for money. Loved the pork and vegetables. Pretty crowded but never waited too long. Jasmine tea is free flow. Highly recommended.
Delicious vegetable Dumplings,As this is very popular there is a wait - go and get your clipboard and choice list and fill it in as you wait. Watch for your number then you are set to go. Most people seemed to be going for Dumplings so I did too as that is what they are known for and they were delicious and well prepared. I asked for a Tofu dish also but none was available so my choice for vegetarian was a little restricted hence 4 * not 5 *.
Small portion of meat than before,"Honestly, most find it tasty and yummy there. But has anyone noticed the amount of meat say inside the dumpling has gotten less comapred to before and compared to DTF in other countries?"
Always crowded,"I try with every Dintaifung when i went to 1 new country. And you needed to wait from 30~40' everywhere. The first, you need to choose food, reservations and enjoy.I like sauteed vegetables & soy sauce, fried rice. I try dimsum but I do not normally see it"
Din Tai Fung is comfort food,"We regularly visit Din Tai Fung as a family. Kids love it. Dumplings are always fresh. Only they have more pork choices than others. Its comfort food. Suntec is a busy place, so be prepared to wait."
Very good,"Tried the soup dumplings, with crab and pork inside, it was hot and delicious.

Had the shrimp cake, thin and crispy but a bit oily.

Noodles with shredded pork with spicy sauce , it was very delicious.

The restaurant is quite large, but not too many customers at night. Atmosphere is different with the other Din Tai Fung I have been to in Taiwan.

Okay all in all."
Not this branch,"We initially ordered 10 pcs of Xiao Long Bao. My friend decided to join us so we ordered another set of 10pcs which was acknowledged by the order taker. She even reconfirmed and repeated 20pcs. When our foods arrived, 30pcs of Xiao Long Bao was served. I told the Chef that we only ordered 20pcs in total. The order taker came back to us and I explained that there's an initial order of 10pcs plus another set of 10pcs, so total of 20pcs. There was a miscommunication I guess but her facial expression was unbelievable. I understand that the restaurant is busy and all the staff are tired but rolling your eyes? Seriously? Anyway, it's a very small issue but not a good impression. In the event that it happened to a rude customer, good luck.

The dimsum is not that tasty compared to other din tai fung branches. On a positive note, the restaurant is spacious and they don't over crowd. The fried rice with pork is always the best."
Fantastic dim sum close to the office,"I've been to Din Tai Fung in China, Taiwan and the US so I don't have much more to say about this. The xiaolongbao was amazing as always. The place was jammed but they were able to seat us quickly. It's great that this place is so close to our Singapore office in Suntec City.

The restaurant was clean and bright and the service was quick and efficient."
Great Business Lunch,Excellent. A must visit. Staff were really helpful for those of us attempting to avoid seafood. Great service. Great food.
"Fast food, but with quality","It really is possible: high quality fast food. Excellent Dim Sum and very tasteful Noodle Soup. Not the place for a romantic dinner, but more than good enough for a high quality lunch."
Always good,"Give you sence of healthy food. Not over spcied, not oliy. Beef is cooked well. Fried egg rice and noodles are great. Vegtables are fresh. A bit noisy."
"Fresh, reasonably priced and so tasty","Located in the shopping mall at Suntec City, I didn't expect much of Din Tai Fung on my first visit but wow, was I wrong! The food was of excellent quality (I had steamed pork buns and a chicken and noodle dish). Jasmin tea was only $1 singapore for an unlimited amount. The whole bill was only $18.50 singapore. Excellent value."
Great food -- horrible service,"The food was great. The dumplings with pork and prawns were out of this world. I liked the decor and the prices were reasonable. But the service was awful. It took forever to get out food, and we never got our beer. We weren't the only ones, there were at least four tables around us at which the patrons were complaining. The service at the chain at the Raffles Centre (about a three minute walk) was much better."
Great food,"We didnt have to wait (on Tuesday night at around 7pm). The service was very quick, food was excellent and was interesting to see the dumplings prepared in the kitchen."
Great dumplings,"Short on atmosphere, but the food was great. The dumplings are mostly steamed and come in many varieties. There were all wonderful. Made with care in the front of the store and served fresh and hot. Heavenly."
Never disappoints,"Fast, delicious food. Always quality food- such a well oiled service machine. You may need to wait 20mins for a spot- but there's plenty of shops to pop into while waiting. Worth it for the xiao long bao"
great food,Great dumplings and the like. Service was a bit average but at least they left us alone and didn't badger like in other dim sums.
good DTF experience - this means great food!,"I love Din Tai Fung - very high quality food and relatively western-palate-friendly (for authentic Chinese/Dim sum).
DTF now have many branches in Singapore and more world-wide. While the experience varies from location to location they are generally similar in menu and service (expect to fill your own 'order form' only to be reviewed by the waiting staff).
My favorites include the oriental salad, the steamed dumplings (esp. the pork Xiao Long Bao), and dan-dan noodle."
Great food as expected; service was average,"The food lives up to the reputation...especially the dumplings and the hot and sour soup. It does get crowded fast during lunch, but the wait isn't nearly as long as at the Din Tai Fungs in California. Service was OK. Great value!"
Hits and Misses,"Came here with friends who are regulars here and so the choices from the menu was theirs, but the choices were good as it was all the things I enjoyed. However, for all the hype that came with this place, half of the dishes were hits and the other half we misses.

The truffle xiao long bao was something interesting and definitely fragrant. Much better than the plan xiao long bao, which, in all honesty, I can get better at the hawker stall in Bukit Merah.

The favourite among most of the group seems to be the wonton with black vinegar and chilli oil. While there was a noodle dish that just bored everyone, and that included a child.

Service was not great, but not bad either."
Great dumplings!,"Even though this is a part of the restaurant chain the feeling was great, open kitchen with several cooks preparing dumplings. Big variety of dumplings, pau's and other Chinese dim sum's. Very tasty, hand made and reasonable pricing."
Yummiee!!!,"Fabulous restaurant. Especially the gyozas with chilli. Loved watching the chefs making the food. The restaurant can be found at several places over Singapore. The one at Suntec was very nice with, as always, good service."
Just ok place - staff could be more cordial,"Stoped by for a quick bite. The place was 2/3 full. The hostess didn't impress me at all. Gave me the menu and a pen and told me to write what I wanted while wait for the table. Not a good signal in my opinion since this restaurant, although isn't any top notch 5 star restaurant, isn't a fast food as per say. I though the whole dim sun experience was about to be able to try different portions, repeat what you like, etc. So, appetizer came first with Juice (awesome juice btw. Lemongrass) after 10 minutes the second dim sum. After couple minutes my bun. The guy who brought the bun set the little tray on top of my dim sum. As soon as I got the bun another waiter came and took it everything, but I had still 4 dumplings. Bottom line: food is ok, price is reasonable and the service is bad. Wouldn't be fair to say it is terrible, but isn't good at all. I guess you can have a much better experience for a fraction of the price at the local food market."
It was good,"The food was good, the table was fine, but it's just taking a bit too long for the menu came out (since it's around 2pm and there's only a few guests at that time also)."
Best branch I've tried!,"I'm a huge fan of xiao long bao but haven't been impressed with the Din Tai Fung branches in the U.S., Taipei nor Hong Kong. To my pleasant surprise, this branch not only had delicious dumplings but also offers a variety of mouth watering side dishes and main dishes. Although the dishes were small similar to other branches, it allowed my family to try many items on the menu. We came on a weekday during lunch hour and had a short wait. However, I must say the wait was worthwhile. If you think Din Tai Fung is overrated, you might want to give this branch a try... Or if you like this place already, it won't disappoint!"
A Singapore Must Try,"Located on the 2nd floor of Sun Tec city, we make it a point to eat here every time we visit.

It has a very nice local vibe to it and is very easy to get to.

The Chinese food is superb, delicious and fairly-priced. It is delivered/served Chinese restaurant style of course and payment is upon exit.

Be forewarned though, this place is popular with both locals and visitors alike and there can be a line. Waits of up 45 mins when very busy are not unusual and since they cook their food for you fresh another 10-25 min await can add to this at peak hours.

My advice? go weekdays and just before dinnertime (which starts 7pm in Asia) just as we do. There are no lines then..
Happy eating!"
Exquisite Chinese Food Goodness!,"PROS Authentic Chinese Food Delicious Glass panels on the chefs side, you can see how the dumplings are made Ambience Interiors CONS Pricey but no regrets!"
Poor queue management and service,"Was here at 8pm on 15 Jan 2017. Told that the queue is 25-30mins long. We decided to queue. At 832pm, orders were taken and shown to our seats. At 847pm, no food has arrived. Checked with the waitress and was told vege need another 5mins, noodles and xiao long bao will take longer(no known time). If I am supposed to wait another 25 mins for my food shouldn't I be informed when they take my order?!"
Great Dumplings!,"This restaurant greatly exceeded our expectations.

My wife and I never expected to have such memorable dim sum on the 2nd floor of the Suntec City mall. We were walking through the mall one afternoon shortly before Christmas, killing time before taking the 6:00 PM bus to see the spectacular Christmas lights and displays along Orchard Road, when we saw a large crowd gathered outside the entrance to this restaurant. Although there were numerous other restaurants in close proximity, this is the only one with a significant crowd outside. This is always a sign of good food, and particularly so in Singapore.

We read the history of the original restaurant in Taiwan on the sign posted outside, and watched the chefs artfully making their dumplings in the exposed kitchen, and decided to have an early dinner.

The lightness and quality of the dumplings were superb. The shrimp and pork and the pork and gourd dumplings, in particular, were spectacular, as were the sweet yam dumplings and the coconut peanut dessert dumplings. The stuffed red dates were luscious.

We enjoyed the food so much that we returned the following evening for dinner again, which is almost a sin in Singapore, with so many marvelous restaurants available.

I still have a hard time believing that this is a chain restaurant. The food quality, presentation, attention to detail, and service all seem to be far too high in quality for chain.

If you are visiting Singapore and are near the Suntec City Center, treat yourself to a meal or snack here.

It’s all about the dumplings."
Good food,Jasmine tea was served as we took seat. Dumplings were amazing so we're fried rice. Nice food. Nice people. Even veggies get some choice here
Snack,"We tried this place three years ago on Sentosa island and my sons wanted to go back. We found it at Suntec.
Tea flows continually.
The cooks make the dumplings in the glassed kitchen.
The soup dumplings are a must- we had three helpings of ten each.
As well as pork buns and chilli crab ones.
To die for. My husband and younger son wanted to try the ones with truffle oil- not cheap at $5 each but they said it was delicious.
Recommend"
Good value,Me and my daughter visited Din Tai Fung as recommended on Tripadvisor. The shrimp and pork dumplings were great and so was the mushroom Noodles. Fried rice was a little plain but overall very nice. Reasonable price.
"Delicious food, service not the greatest at this branch","As always the food here was amazing. Dumplings are delicious, as are the pork rolls, the deep fried pork and rice, the bok choi etc. I can not fault the food.
The service however wasn't wonderful. Very rushed and sometimes giving the wrong dishes to the wrong table.
I'd still go back as I love the food but at least I'd know what to expect."
