Lovely view and great good,"Enjoyed the meal - their steak was perfectly medium raw. Salmon and pasta were good too. So were the sides of asparagus and sautéed mushrooms.

We were seated indoors as we were told the outdoors seats require booking as advance as 6 months. We did pop out to check out the skyline during sunset which was lovely.

As they had another reservation after us, we were shifted to the lounge area for desserts which was comfy. Can be a bit noisy was next to the lounge.

Desserts were great too - we had the chocolate tart, passion fruit pavlova, tiramisu. Thoughtful staff also prepared a complimentary slice of birthday cake for my friend."
Nice experience and great view,Very nice spot for a great view on marina bay. Great locally brewed beers. Good food and very friendly service. A nice experience !
Stunning views and experience,"Was a great recommendation from a friend of mine to dine here during my visit with Singapore and bring along some friends.

The beer options are a definitely highlight from their tasting paddles to myriad of lager and IPA options.

I did enjoy my Steak for dinner but was absolute highlight was the sunset over Marina Bay and light show as well.

I would highly recommend a visit for sunset and definitely set outside."
Spectacular view & Good service,"Great view and good food, Nice environment and friendly staff especially Mhal, lastly price acceptable too."
Overall good experience,"Nice view and decently delicious food. We were warmly welcomed by Alissa and Charan. They were both polite and eager to assist.

However we were assisted by another staff member who had no smile and looked like she was rushing to close her section (checked her watch when we were ordering dessert).

Other than that, it was a good experience."
Great Experience,"Was here for lunch with two young kids. The food was great as always - the roast chicken was nicely done (part of the lunch menu) and the kids meals were done very well and generously portioned.

We were served by Mhel, who did a great job and gave the kids a nice treat and some memories to keep for a great Christmas season meal here."
Excellent Food and Service,"The food was excellent! I had ordered the Free-range NZ Maimoa Lamb Rack while the rest of my family ordered the Westholme Wagyu Rump. We also had side orders of Truffle & Paesan Fries, Brussel Sprouts, and Asparagus. Everything was excellent. The meat was all so tender, moist and very flavorful! We were served by Mhel and Vivian and their service was top-notch! And although we were too full to order dessert, we were treated to a small brownie for the Holidays!

We highly recommend this restaurant!"
Great view,"Had dinner at this restaurant, and we were treated with a nice night view of Singapore. Good food, nice ambience."
"Decent beers, GREAT views. Pricey food.","The views here are nothing short of sublime. The beers are pretty good without being great, and whilst on the pricey side were reasonable considering everything.

The little bit of food I had was nice, but again - quite pricey.

Staff were great though, very friendly and accommodating."
First Timer,"Place was packed for a Tuesday night. We were a table of 7, and seated promptly. It was my first but many ties for the rest of my family. First thing that hits you are the views, very nice especially during sunset. Service was A1, our server took the time to explain all the types of foods and beers on the menu. The wife had the Asparagus and Octopus (one long and huge octopus tentacle with some sweet sauce, nice. The seabass with risotto for her main, which was ok. I had the lobster bisque which was a tad cold, and the beef tartar which was a bit salty. The tri-bit steak was done to my liking and was very yummy. We all shared some tomatoes and kingfish was was nice. Overall what was the best for me was the service, very attentive and always with a smile,"
"Views 5, food...","We arrived and were seated promptly. The table hadn't been wiped down properly. The view was amazing. We ordered quickly and the service was fast. However, our vegetables were cold. It took 2 members of staff three visits to our table to arrange warm vegetables which arrived on a skillet. Why they couldn't be par-boiled then put into a pan with butter and the ale, to order, is a mystery. The meat was INCREDIBLE. We'd come back for a different meal, but not an impressive Sunday Roast sadly."
Great for the view,"We went back to enjoy the view and give it a second chance.

Service was way better this time. Still very Singaporian (if you do not raise your hand, no one will come to you to check if what you need), but this time we had the chance to get very respectful and genuinely nice waitresses.

We tried a couple of impressively good cocktails (the ones not mixed with beer).

The food was the disappointment. Clearly overpriced due to the view, but nothing special about it.

We’ll go back for the cocktails."
A good first experience!,"It was our first experience at LeVel33 and it was a good one! While I am not a beer person, enjoyed their freshly brewed craft beer - 33.1 Blond Lagar.

For food, we went for the seafood platter which was quite enjoyable though I think they could have given us 2x fresh oyster each as one was just too little for the price paid per pax.

This was followed by the local sea bass which was good and fresh and we also had the pork chop which was while good, was more on the fatty side.

We finished with the beer ice cream which was quite unique (first time having such).

Service was good and boy, the view of the Marina Bay was simply superb!"
Lucky find by Dr Google,"I found this place when I googled‘restaurants in Singapore with a view’.
I never would have known it was there otherwise. Visiting from Australia it was lovely sitting on the terrace looking at the fabulous scenery of Singapore. We chose the chefs selection menu at $148 per head for 6 courses. It was all delicious and beautifully served. This is the highest indoor brewery in the world so has plenty of beer options but a fabulous wine list too. We had a lovely evening and will visit again next time we’re in Singapore."
Amazing views,The restaurant atmosphere was amazing and provided panoramic views of marina bay including marina bay sands. The food platter seafood was impressive (even for a non seafood lover). Lamb dish was delicious and it was great to be able to sample the different beers brewed on site
A great place to chill with a view,"Went there for dinner with friends and reserved the 5.30pm seating. We took the Dining Room as Terrace was full but nonetheless ambience was great. With 5-5.30 seating, you get to see both the day & night views, the night view was especially stunning. Quick note, Terrace seatings are all high chairs. Food wise, it was impressive too. Love their calamari which came as part of a platter - one of the best. Dessert was great and even the fish was well-infused. A pity there was limited time, we would love to stay longer."
Homeless polar bear,"Positives are the views and the welcome from the staff when you first arrive. The negatives, firstly they say that they brew 5 beers on the premises, when we arrived only 3 available as they had run out of the others. Ordered something else only then to find out that all they were doing was changing the barrel. Finally got a stout which after all the wait was quite bland and disappointing. Partner had a Singapore sling, more expensive than the Marina bay sands but also a lot more ice, to be honest the amount of ice in the drink probably made a polar bear homeless!"
Superb View!!,"We had a Friday 12 noon reservation but we’re a tad late due to signage- LeVel 33 is in Tower 1 (not 3 where the sign is). In keeping with the Micro Brewery the decor is Industrial Minimalist- the Terrace all glass and steel with high tables. We wished we had brought hats & sunglasses as the glare was strong but we tolerated it and sat right on the edge of the terrace taking in the amazing view. Even though we may have been more comfortable, we felt the inside lacked ambience.
Garry our server was very helpful and professional and we enjoyed the Craft Beers & Rockford wines.
We took the 2 course Set Lunch- the Lobster Rolls excellent along with Parmesan Truffle Fries and Charred Asparagus topped with Dukkah followed by Beer Icecream and the delicious White Chocolate & Matcha Mousse.
At S$226 reasonable for “the experience”."
"Good to be there once, not often!",Nice view but crowded! I made reservation 5 weeks ago and couldn’t get a table outside! Inside is a quite simple ambience. Food is really good but expensive!
"Lovely meal with a outside terrace view , Shared with people that hadnt booked !!!!!!!!!!!","Booked a table outside one evening. Food was fantastic as was the view. Wine was great and the variety of beers was just as good

Only issue we had after booking a table was it seemed bit of a free for all to stand and walk around the outside terrace. It didn't feel at all private or special to us who had booked weeks in advance

Anyone was able to enter terrace and stand right by our table and talk very loudly and move around as they felt like it.......Shame really



Message to management - If people take time to specifically book the Terrace , you should only allow those bookings to actually enter the terrace other wise whats the point in booking it ??????????"
Dinner with an Awesome view,Booked dinner on the Terrace……for this there is a minimum spend….but we’ll worth it for spectacular views. Food and beer choice excellent and service good but does get busy later in the evening Excellent photo opportunities
Genuine and memorable service - outstanding teamwork,"Jayson was the star of the evening. We really feel so special and thank you very much for making my overseas guests so special. We were seated at a table facing the inner garden but after I’ve shared with him that my guests have travelled to Singapore as the first destination after two years, he changed us to a window table when it became available. After that, we were allowed an outdoor table with a gorgeous view of the Marina Bay to finish our desserts.

A huge thanks to Jayson, Zul and the team for such a memorable evening."
No Proper Signage to show the entrance of the level 33 Restaurant,It is timely for level 33 to put proper signage for the customers to locate the lift to the restaurant. All the existing signage are placed in the wrong location and cannot be seen from the main glass door entrance
Spectacular view,"We booked a table for 4, for dinner. We were pleased we got a table by the window with a lovely view. The service was excellent! Attentive, friendly staff. The food was good, but i found a few fish scales on the fish. We were allocated 2hrs for dinner but we were happy we got extended another half hour, as there was already another booking. We wanted to stay longer and requested to move to the outside terrace, but was told there was no space available. Thankfully another staff member got us a table at the terrace. The dining area we were in was still not occupied when we moved to the terrace .
The view was spectacular! Overall, it was a lovely experience and we had a great evening. If only there was no time constraints, we would have enjoyed our experience even more."
"Excellent food and view, and of course, services!","Very great service from Mhal! It’s my first time here, will definitely revisit again! Thanks Mhal!!!"
Great service - mediocre food,"This is truly a wonderful place with a nice vibe to it, and possibly the best views in Singapore from the outside terrace.
We had dinner inside and reserved seating outside for post dinner drinks. What a great way to spend an evening! This option is only available to dinner guests at their dining room (not at the social dining room).
The food was mediocre at best, serving cuts of meat that was tough to chew and fish that was dry.
BUT - the service was excellent and we really loved the staff at this wonderful find.
And the views just made our stay :)"
Poor service,Got turned away at 10:15 because the reception said they were full and were only accepting reservations. Except you can’t make reservations after 9:30 And the bar and restaurant area was empty
Excellent view and superb service.,"This place is just as it has been marketed.
The highest brewery with a majestic view of the Singapore skyline. Though they have a put a minimum cover charge to sit outside which seems slightly higher
The vegetarian options are very less but the service is impeccable. Especially I would like to mention Keith who went out of the way to get some veg options made from the chef.
Overall a very pleasant experience."
Best view,"I booked this restaurant after reading several reviews to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary after arriving from Australia. Without doubt the view is superb, I booked a table on the terrace and the weather was absolutely perfect. We ate at the later sitting which allowed us to watch the light and sound show on the water from above as well as the Supertree Grove show. The food was very good, not a huge amount and as a vegetarian myself my choice was extremely limited. I had seen a menu with alot more choices online before I left but this must have been for another area of the restaurant as we did not have nearly the choice I was expecting. That said, what we did have was very good, hubby had the seafood plate and said it was the freshest and best he'd had. The price was quite steep, there was a $150 minimum for terrace dining and we doubled that each having entrees, mains and desserts and a drink. Not complaining at all, it was a once in a lifetime experience and celebrating 25 years so thoroughly enjoyed our evening here. Service was outstanding, the young lady who showed us to our seats was very attentive and friendly."
Lovely view and perfect food,We had 6 meal course and it is all delicious!!!! Plus free flow of drinks for 2 hours!!!! Mhel is really friendly and accommodating!🤗
Quality food with a great view,This is an amazing place with a stunning view of Marina Bay. Enjoy the biers on the terrace and tasty the high quality food in the inside room. Staff professional.
Big Let down!,Most overpriced and overhyped restaurant in Singapore … average food .. undeniable great views but not worth it frankly !
Amazing view. Great food,Came for the view and weren’t disappointed. Treated ourselves to the lobster and it was delicious and cooked perfectly. Treated to free glasses of champagne at the end. Book for sunset and you’ll be amazed as Singapore lights up around you.
"Amazing views, friendly service, tasty brews and food.","Had a wonderful evening here. Amazing nighttime views of the city whilst sampling a paddle of lively beers. We shared the NZ lamb ribs with the tasty creamy mash, roasted brussel sprouts and silky mushroom ragu. Also had the asparagus but was a bit over spiced for our liking. Overall a great venue and spectacular place to visit."
Best Rooftop View for Tourists Like Us,"SG was the first travel we had as a family right after the pandemic. It had to be commemorated with a great photo and the best one we had was from the outdoor dining terrace of LeVel 33. They got the best view of the iconic Marina Bay Sands! So very SG.

Our table had a SGD 75++ minimum consumable per person and a time limit between 5:30pm - 8:00pm for dinner sunset viewing. I was actually glad that I thought of even reserving because this was the week that SG was about to open on full mode and everywhere that day was just full. So, if you're going to SG, you better reserve!

We were 5 at the table and we were able to consume the food with ease because it was good!! The drinks even better. The ambience was also superb. It's chill and at the same time upbeat. It's a great place to have great and memorable conversations with your family and friends. The service is also top-notch. We were accommodated with our every half-hour request to take a photo of the view."
Nice but can be better,The ambiance was amazing and the staff were super friendly and nice. Unfortunately we ordered the wagyu steak and was quite tough.. was expecting really soft and buttery but had a tough time chewing thru the steak. Will defo come back for other dishes!
Best view in town with great food and atmosphere,"We booked a 5:30pm sitting on the terrace to be able to watch the sunset and it did not disappoint. Service was excellent and so were the food and drinks. In fact, this place left such a good impression on us that we ended up there for lunch two days later since we couldn't get in to anywhere at MBS. A different experience - it was scorching hot but the sun eventually moved and we enjoyed some cold drinks and the seafood platter with a stunning view.

The steak tartare here is delicious. We came here with our 2 kids both times and the kids were treated with respect. Sometimes venues assume kids are a nuisance but ours are well behaved and ate all our steak tartare..."
Visit on 9th May 2022,"I booked with reservation on a Monday for an early dinner with my 2 children to celebrate my birthday actually. It was my first time there. The atmosphere was nice but we feel awkward. Awkward because people are there in groups drinking. I feel that the reservation team could have at least mentioned in the email or suggest that it will be more suitable for me to book a Sun lunch for family meals. The waitress could have done more to recommend suitable dishes for us. I ordered a social dinning set recommended for 2 to 3 pax and a side. The portion was so small that I didn't eat at all, my children finished everything! She could have recommended that I ordered a normal set for myself and 2 sets of children's meal. Not only that, I needed a glass of warm water to take my medication, the restaurant did not serve and that I had to order a big jug of soda water. I will not go with my children again for sure. If the visit was with my friends, I believe I will enjoy."
Mother's Day lunch,"Best food, great service, fabulous staff and great view. Highly recommended. Special touch added to service and unexpected extras to the set menu as it was mother's day."
Stunning views and good food,The views from the Restaurant is stunning. This place is always packed and is good to book in advance. The food and drinks are good. The lobster roll was great. Desserts are a so-so. Staff were professional and friendly.
Family Dinner,The view is amazing. The staff were very nice and the food was great. I had a great night out and would recommend this place to my friends
First TIme,Food : very good Beverage : Standard Place : Awesome Service : good but there's one waitres (woman) didn't polite serving us Price : Standard
Nice view!,Great view. Average food. Mediocre service. Will go back mainly for the view and convenient location. Restaurant gets loud as it has no sound proofing.
Excellent vegetarian menu,"Very nice food & atmosphere. Love the vegan food goes with non alcoholic beer,superb experience. The waiter & waitresses are super nice & polite. I really love the view , the food & people . The food are beyond my expectations and would definitely book the place again in the near future."
A bit disappointed…,"First it’s extremely cold inside, even my hubby complained and he’s seldom cold.
The portions are half of what they used to be, but the price isn’t ! I’m talking about the cold meat board. Very disappointed compared to 3 years ago.
There’s not a great choice of dishes either. You go there for the beer and the view! I recommend to be outside !
Service was fine
They were very nice and even proposed for us to have desert outside coz it had rained and the terrace was empty !
I love the view!
Please get back the good paté, saucisson, mustards and french pickles! And better portions!"
Excellent service and Fantastic food,Was my first time dining with Level33 and was served by Mhel. The service she provided was spot on! I was actually celebrating my bdae with my partner and she surprised us with a complimentary bdae brownie cake. It's was amazing! Will definitely be back!
Excellent Sunday lunch!,"We enjoyed the excellent Sunday lunch. Great service, lovely roast and the service was exceptional. We look forward to returning soon! Kevin and Richard"
Super evening,"We had booked for the terrace but it rained very heavily as we arrived. We were relocated inside, next to a window. We chose from the dinner menu. The food was delicious especially the pork and truffle mash. Service was attentive. Lovely atmosphere. We had a great evening"
Beautiful view with beautiful food,"I love the view & the food The calamari & asparagus was lovely The ribeye was good as well! More importantly, Jesa was extremely inviting :) Helped us shift from indoor to outdoor so that we can enjoy the beautiful view"
Magnificent View of SG,"The food is very ordinary, food displays not very impressive but the service was good and a magnificent view of SG!"
Amazing Place to be with average food,"Brought my family there for a birthday lunch. Great atmosphere with tables spaced really widely apart (no worries about getting COVID) Scenery is great for taking photos too.

Food:
The lamb shank and fish tasted good.
The Wagyu tip meat was tough, nobody asked us how done we want the meat to be.
Potato from all dishes are really salty.
The $9 salad was giant pieces of leaves thrown together in sauce, not visually appetizing and not easy to eat."
Great View and Great Service!,Service from the staff is friendly and professional. The girl who served us gave good recommendation to try the beer. We would love to try the food here next time! You must book the seat on the terrace earlier as it runs out quickly!
Awesome place to celebrate,"Nice food, great singapore view and staff Ms. Mhel for assisting us to have an outdoor table. Also we got our complimentary cake to celebrate our 3rd year wedding anniversary with memorable photo"
Nice ambiance,Staff Mhel be is highly commendable for giving us nice seating place with great view & good recommendations in selecting food. I was also provided with complimentary birthday cake. It was a very pleasant experience for me & my family for our first time visit there
Delicious Sunday roast,"We have eaten at this restaurant a few times and never been disappointed. This was the first time we had Sunday roast and it was so tasty. Great portion sizes and a good choice of dishes. The tri tip wagyu beef was delicious as were the vegetables and sides we chose. The menu is also very reasonably priced.
The view from the balcony will always be my favourite view of the marina - it’s amazing.
I’d also like to compliment the staff who were attentive, efficient and friendly- they also accommodated our request to move out to the balcony for coffee.
Faultless!"
Fabulous food with excellent service!,"LeVel 33 definitely deserved my recommendation to others whom had not been there. First off, their service staff (Michael and Mhel) constantly visited our table to make sure all was taken care of. From where to take the best photos, food recommendations, food preparation status, and even provide some brief history of the restaurant. Next, with the staff’s recommendation, we tried the BBQ Kingfish collar and it was an unexpected pleasant surprise. Not the usual seafood dish that we had anticipated. Lastly, the restaurant ambience was cosy and relaxing. A nice cold beer really ended my day in a very good note. Thank you to all the staff for such an extraordinary dining experience."
Service was horrible,"The views were great, the food was ok, but the service was really bad. We ordered a round of drinks and some food and I made a table reservation. Throughout the meal, I felt that service was not there and if it was the waitress and waiters sort of gave us look as to why we ordered so little. And when we arrived we did ask for a table outside once it was ready, but we waited and was not offered but others were, and when we about to leave the night we saw at least 5 tables available and not once was we reminded that we can move and enjoy the view. To me the service was rude, unattentive and not great."
Cool Ambiance,Our first try in Level 33 Post New Year lunch and also to celeb my son's bday amidst pandemic. We enjoy both food and beautiful scenic view.
It was very satisfying,"Loved the food with a difference, service were spot on and views were magnificent! Another place that I’ll bring my guests and we hope we will be able to get a table for NY’s eve fireworks when it will be displayed again."
Family Dinner,"The booking was a mess. Tot i booked an outdoor seating but apparently within the confirmation email i got, is ANOTHER round of confirmation for outdoor seating which I did not expect. (CHOPE or Level 33, you should stop this practice, its not normal). This left my wife upset as it was our anniversary dinner and she was looking forward to the view. My appreciation goes to Michael, the manager, who assembled a table for us and saved the evening. Thank you very very much for the effort. Your action won the hearts of my family."
Excellent service!,"Much gratitude to Rhoda who was extremely helpful in making arrangements for our table despite the change in plans. She was clear in advising us on the dinner sets available and meeting our requests for our celebration meals. At our dinner, the staff who served us were helpful and prompt! They checked in with us and ensured that we had a good dining experience. Thank you!"
Experience of dining,"Customer was not informed that plain water will be charged, thumbs down! BBQ kingfish collar is fishy, thumbs down! Didn’t ask for bill but it came,like kind of chasing u to leave"
Very good beer and perfect view,"A real nice location with a micro brewery on floor 33. The terace provides a great view over Singapore, especially in the night. The prices are a bit too high but when you are in Singapore you should go there at least for a beer."
Great Service,"Great Food, nice ambience and excellent service. The waitresses are friendly, customer oriented and providing good services. It is a great place to chill out after a long day or a social little gathering up to 5 pax for Dec 2021 :)"
Great food with good service,Great view with nice ambience. Good service from Mel. Introduced some nice dishes. Both indoor and outdoor setting have great view.
Excellent service and appetizing food,"Last Dec 13, me and my other half decided to celebrate our 6th anniversary at Level33 and I could say that, the warm and welcoming atmosphere really sets the mood. Our anniversary dinner was made even more special by the extraordinary service rendered to us by Ms Joyce. We were both suprised when we were offered a cute happy anniversary cake, a glass of sparkling champaign and a photo greeting card for keepsake. Thank you Level 33 and Ms Joyce for going the extramile in making our Anniversary super special. And btw, their food was appetizing and flavorful and their service is worth commendable."
Great place to celebrate and chit chat.,"The area is cozy and ambiance is chill enough for some family time. The view from terrace is great for first timers like us. Food is good (bec the steak was a bit salty.) and its price points are just right for the location. The staff are all friendly and personable which we all like most. Melody and her co-staff at the reception lobby were great and pleasant to meet and guide us. Would we come back?? Certainly we will. Oh before I forget, their choices of beer and wine are exceptionally great. I'm not a beer drinker but I gave it a try, and I'm not disappointed. Stay great to all Level33 staff and mngt. Thank you for having us."
Poor experience,The waiters were rude as they passed snide comments amongst themselves that were overheard by the customers. Apart from that the food was average and did not serve the quality at the price point.
A Very poor meal,A seriously overcooked baked fish and sadly cooked in tomato ketchup! Lovely view and decent service but the food!!!
Great Food; Excellent Service,"The food and view was superb at level 33.

What really make the day memorable was the special surprise brownie and photo prepared by your staff Mhel for my boyfriend’s birthday!

Mhel’s attentiveness and willingness to go above and beyond makes the dinner a lovely experience for us.

We will definitely return again. Thank you"
TANz,"Great food, Excellent service. We had an awesome night. Big Thank you to those whom have attended to us."
Excellent lunch with amazing view!!,It was great to return to Level 33 after being away for almost two years due to COVID. We were not disappointed. We enjoyed an outside table in the sunshine. Great food and beer. Will be back soon!
Fantastic view of financial district and MBS / Fullerton / Singapore Flyer,"The view was fantastic even amid hot sun for my seat. Food serving was abit slow, attached some food photo. The beer is a must try, with huge brewery in restaurant, the home brewed beer has a subtle and smooth taste. But the toilet is smelly, badly need a renovation. The cubicle is dark, mgt need to spend some money on renovation."
Great all round,"Service, quality of food and location all good. Never disappoints. Table outside or near the balcony is a must."
"Amazing views, amazing food","Get the truffle fries (life-changing!), skewer sampler, tiramisu and cocktails. The views at night were spectacular!"
Drinking hole with great views,"this place needs booking in advance as the view is outstanding . The customer service and drinks are also good. It is not cheap as you paying to drink at a prime priced property with a great view.
during the night you can see the whole bay and the older part of the city . Do ask for a balcony seat whilst booking.
at the time of writing , Nov 21, the maximum group number is 2 (covid prevention rules).
They also serve food which we didn't partake of. As we stuck strictly to liquid food ha ha .
A word of warning , the balcony is shut off when it rains . During Nov to March it is the rainy season , so there is a good likelihood it may rain and you will then be given a table on the inside . You still have a good view but not as good as sitting on the balcony.
it is certainly worth going to ."
Bad experience,"I was booking table for 2 before the government announced can dine in 5 people in same household. I was told fully book for the balcony table, but there is a seat with 4 people out there. This is completely not fair to me. People only go for the level 33 view, letting me sitting inside is really disappointed me. Btw the food also not very nice 4 out of 10. Hope to see improvements"
Excellent Service from Ming,The view and the food were amazing. But the most memorable one is the excellent service from Ming. He made us feel welcome and comfortable while dinning at this restaurant. Thank you for making my friend happy by taking nice photos as he loves to post it on social media. we will be back again for sure.
Excellent Service - Personal & Passionate,"Mel made our evening amazingly wonderful. She was passionate to recommend the dinner, which were yummylicious. Took beautiful pictures of us the whole night during our drinks and dinner, and surprised us with complimentary desserts and champagne to make our anniversary celebration memorable. Will definitely come again."
"Faultless service, very over priced","When you can entertain newcomers to Singapire it is certainly a great spot as the view to Marnia Bay Sands in amazing.

The service is second to none.

The food is good however not great and very overpriced for what it is.

We wouldn't return other than to take international guests for a drink and the view."
Still water to pay,"In such an expensive place, it's unacceptable that you have to pay 5 SGD for a bottle of tap water. The concept itself really destroys the whole atmosphere."
Excellent Service,"First time for a meal and was pleasantly surprised. Yes the view is great, but the food was tasty and perfectly cooked and the service was polite, and attentive when required.

It was our 10th anniversary which one of the waiters overheard and we were surprised with a small desert saying happy anniversary. A real nice touch and thanks."
Birthday Celebration,"I were there with my husband and 2 kids for a birthday celebration. It was my second time at Level 33 and the food and service were undoubtly impressive, not to mention the great scenic view. Special thanks to Joyce and Alissa whom acceded to all my requests and with a smile! U gals rock! Will be there again for sure!"
Underwhelming,The only thing nice about this place is the stunning view of the Marina Bay area. Food is pretty average. Best service seems to be reserved for foreigners. This is pretty sad!
Good service and what a view!,"Had a good time chilling and chatting. Friendly and attentive service from Joyce and Zul. Menu selection was wide enough for lunch with a good salad/seafood buffet as part of the deal. Lunch partner found the lobster roll tasty while my medium rare steak was a little too on the tough side. Would have preferred less gristle too. Dessert & coffee was good, paired with great views of the Singapore waterfront."
Great!,Loved the buffet appetiser and the half price for second diner off the 2 course meal. Pleasant surprise!
"One of the best views of MBS, great salads, good beer.",Level 33 is my favourite microbrewery in Singapore. It offers really good salads and a large variety of Beers. Very good place to catch the view of Singapore MBS.
Best Birthday in Singapore,"The food, view and beer were perfect, just as I had seen in the reviews!
Even though there were many guests, the service was very attentive.

But what made me most happy was that they prepared a surprise cake and photo for us, even though I told them in the chat that it was my husband's birthday.

To Mel, who was in charge of our table, thank you so much for a wonderful time.
(Sorry if I spelled wrong)
You made our first anniversary in Singapore so special.

I would definitely use this restaurant again for another anniversary."
Sunday Roast with great company and a view,"I was early as always, my guest had yet to arrive. The hostess graciously offered me a window table with an impeccable view. She quickly suggested the blond lager , it always a plus when the staff make suggestions that actually work. Upon arrival my guest was promptly escorted to the table, where she was also offered the blond lager.

One dozen Oysters on the half shell, which also prove to be spot on, in fact they would have fit in any oyster bar in South Louisiana. The final touch was the brand new bottle of Tobasco. The main entre was Waygu tri tip cooked to perfection, served with rooted vegetables , then for desert sticky date pudding with beer Ice cream. Definitely worth the time spent there and recommend to all"
"Memorable experience, excellent service, food and view","We enjoyed our 3 course lunch, value for money and good choices. The mini buffet was small but sufficient. Everything was
good quality, can’t ask for more.

Special thanks to Michael for his accommodating service as we moved from outdoor to indoor as we struggled to dine in comfort or with a beautiful view. Thank you for being kind and making the whole experience very memorable."
Excellent Service!,Mhel service was excellent! She was very lovely & friendly and has very quick response to our needs! Good place to celebrate birthday! Recommended 👍🏻
