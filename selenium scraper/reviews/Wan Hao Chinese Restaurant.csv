Dim sum delicious at wan hao,Tried the dim sum and dessert. The mao shan durian dessert was marvelous! Service is acceptable but not exceptional. Chrysanthemum tea lacklustre though as it tastes bland
Very good quality food with generous servings,"Me and my partner enjoyed our dinner here last month and decided to bring our parents and children there. Was pleasantly surprised how private the place is despite the fri night crowd! Instead of a big hall, the place was divided into smaller halls and it actually made the ambience very private and personal.

Food was really delicious and we would strongly recommend the following - sweet & sour pork, beef cubes, scallop with asparagus, dou miao with shrimp, baked alaska dessert. Peking duck was surprisingly plain so will skip this next time. We had another tofu dish but not so memorable.

Staff had a hard time copping though. Lack of manpower. They were really stretched but still maintained their smiles. Very impressed but if the management is reading this - pls support them with more help on fri nights.

Definitely strongly recommend! It is now one of my favourite restaurants to go!"
Delicious food with generous servings,"Ordered some really nice food that was cooked well - highly recommended
- baked cod fish with egg white (great contrasting texture with the crispy outer layer for cod fish with the soft interior and egg white) ; beef cubes with mushroom (not over cooked, very generous serving of beef); brandy baked alaska ice cream (really really nice). Scallop (with asparagus) was a bit overcooked but the asparagus were sweet and well cooked.

Was excited at the variety of chinese tea menu but was not very impressed with what I ordered - not sure if its because I ordered the wrong tea or very few people order (they took sometime to find the menu) - the tea was taste like plain green tea and not as fragrant as I expected it to be.

Portions are too big for 2 - could have easily fed 3 to 4 people. We were so full!

But would definitely visit again - there are so many things on the menu that I would still like to try!"
Great food,One unique thing I noticed about this restaurant is that they have nice tucked in booths if you want some privacy. Service and food were excellent.
Very poor service,Food was excellent. Service was astonishingly poor and then to top it all they still charge a service fee
Fantastic bento and Dimsum,"During Phase 2 Heightened Alert, I had done takeaways and food was fantastic. When dining-in resumed, I came for Dimsum lunch, and was very satisfied with the food freshness, and service. Will definitely return."
Typical of Chinese Restaurants,"We waited just a short while at the entrance of the restaurant before we were shown to what seemed like two private rooms, with the partition retracted to accommodate 6 tables. Safe distancing played a major part in how the tables were spaced out, which was perfect.

No e-menus here as food orders were taken down the conventional way. For my dinner companion and I, dinner was the Wan Hao Signature Crispy Chicken, Stir-Fried Broccoli with Oyster Sauce and Braised Vegetarian Chicken and Beancurd. We ate these with rice and washed them down with Chinese Tea. The dishes were brought to our table nicely presented in glistening white plates that brought out their colours.

The service rendered was befitting of Chinese restaurants. Not that the service was bad, just not exceptional."
Great,"Mainly ordered dim sum and the chicken fillet in chinese wine. Dim sum overall was great. The standard har gau, siew mai and char siew bao were well done. The chicken dish was good but also disappointing due to the lack of chinese wine coming through."
Furniture needs to be checked,"Went to have dinner with friends in group of 3.
Noticed there were a few defective dining chairs around the restaurant towards the end of our dinner.
We are rather worried about the safety of other guests that might be seated on these broken unknowingly.

The restaurant should be more attentive to such details that might lead to potential hazard caused the diners."
Good food but lacking in ambience,Enjoyed half portion of peking duck which was just nice for two. Dessert was good (chilled coconut pudding with purple glutinous rice puree). Four stars because service staff were lacking. Had to be on a hard lookout to get their attention.
food's good. service can be better with more staff.,"visited them last year with my wife. Food is good but service could be better. Stood at the door for a long while (with many crew members walking past us). we tried to get their attention but they seemed to be very busy and understaffed.

after we ate, we were left waiting to pay the bill. I walked to the kitchen dorr to get help after waiting for about 15-20mins and it was settled quite quickly thereafter."
Food is good and tasty! However,Food is good and tasty! However services is rather poor. Maybe not enough man power! Hope services can be improved and be more attentive to customer!
A very exquisite Chinese restaurant.,"A very exquisite Chinese restaurant. So far, I will give this food 80%, consider very high. As their price is not cheap either. Will be back again."
dry roast chicken and salty dishes from ala carte menu,"the ala carte item we ordered from the menu was not surely worth the price we paid as roast chicken was way too dry and most dishes are too salty
As it was a weekday afternoon and not especially crowded, was surprised that the standard of the food here is not up to the standard"
High quality dim sum and Peking Duck,"Visited this restaurant for the first time in Sep for lunch. Reservation was essential as it was full, even on a Monday - we had to settle for a very late lunch. But it was worth the inconvenience as the quality of the Peking Duck and the dim sum was really very good. We slightly over-ordered for only 2 of us, but can't fault the food quality. Hope to visit again at some stage."
Truly Fine Dining,"I had purchased a 1:1 voucher under the Amex offer in July 2020 for Wan Hao Chinese Restaurant at Tang's Marriott Hotel and was supposed to pick the vouchers up in July but had to go overseas and did not come back till Oct 2020. The staff at Tang's Marriott hotel, Mandy Y. was very understanding and allowed me to claim the vouchers 3 months later, always checking with me if I have returned from time to time. I am very appreciate of her attentiveness and sensitivity towards my situation which gave me the peace of mind that the vouchers would not be forfeited since I did not show up to claim it. As for Wan Hao, it was really high quality Chinese food, I would recommend the Stir fried sharp spinach with minced shrimp, tobiko and garlic, so delicious for spinach lovers especially, the dim sum was very good and for dessert, the chilled mango sago pomelo with coconut ice cream. The desert was in sizeable portions which made eating it very satisfying. As for the seating, do ask for the booths instead of round tables if you are a small group because it is situated in its cozy little corner with a lot of privacy. The service is superb."
Had dinner at one of my favourite,"Had dinner at one of my favourite Chinese restaurants 万豪轩
The restaurant is full house but still managed to get the sofa seat!
Dishes tries:
- Peking duck
- Peking duck E-fu noodle
- truffle prawn
- sweet and sour Iberico pork
- soup of the day
- assorted mushroom with seaweed beancurd in claypot
Great restaurant to dine and gathering!

Dr E Chow"
Nice restaurant with good food and service,"We have Peking duck, deep fried prawn with salted egg yolk and oatmeal and braised homemade seaweed beancurd with conpoy and shredded mushroom. The duck is very good with crispy skin. The prawns are big, fresh and chewy. Good and friendly service from May. Chilled coconut and red bean jelly for dessert is delightful and refreshing."
Does not Commit to Mooncake Preodrers,"Was informed on 18 Sep 2020, only 1 day prior to collection that there were no more snow skin moon cakes. No explanation was given. The call was insincere and there was no offer to document the change in collection dates. They could only 'try to email me a confirmation'. The email did come through but why does the customer need to prod?"
Mooncake - the Best! & DimSum,"This review is focusing on its Mooncakes (for Mid-Autumn Festival): Fresh and good definitely, just like their same consistent effort in making their Chinese dishes (ate several years ago)
Without fail, every year i will get their baked mooncakes and snowskin! A must to buy them regdless how expensive a box of mooncake can be!"
Consistent Excellence for over more than 3 years - Regular @ Wanhao Marriott,"My husband and I have been regulars at @ Marriott Wanhao for more than 3 years now. We have brought friends, family, extended family and colleagues to this priced hideout of ours. The food has always been good, consistency in service was recently greatly improved due to Fion and a few long serving staff as well- May. It is priced reasonably for the quality of food. I feel that many of my fellow commentators of this same establishment expect very high service standards. The service culture of SG does not include tipping or gratuity. Hence, it is difficult to retain good staff or have exceptionally high standards of service as compared to other countries or other overseas Marriott establishments. For the best service quality, please pay a premium for Michelin Starred Restaurants. I have no qualms coming back to Wanhao @ Marriott for any kind of meal, in fact we do frequent the restaurant twice in the same weekend. Thumbs up once again for Fion & May."
Lunch,"Service was inattentive and staff was unfriendly. I called twice to request for manager to return my call prior to lunch, no follow up."
"Great peking duck, enjoyed it","Wan hao is one of the few places that still sells half a peking duck, which was great because there were just the two of us celebrating my birthday.

The duck treatment is pretty standard, the crispy skin is cut away for wraps, and the meat stir fried with rice or noodles. I chose ee fu noodles, which turned out delicious.

Couldn’t order anything else other than a plate of veggies. Service was friendly and fast.

I also liked the quiet atmosphere, and there were nice little private seating places, which I think you can get if you book early enough."
Great Peking Duck skin wrap,"Worth a visit though its a little pricey. One of our regular place for family dinner or special occasion is big group. Our favorite is the peking duck skin wrap. After the crispy skin is used up. They will cook the meat for you with rice or noodles, your choice! Vegetables, fish dish, all are spot on!"
Expect tasty food!,"Wan Hao restaurant Chef serves very tasty Chinese cuisine. I recommend the Crispy Chicken, Sweet & Sour Pork and Seaweed beancurd. The Chef love their work!

The service is kept to the minimum and not great or impressive. It seems to be lacking of manpower for most of the time we visit. It may need a happier workforce.

Minus two points for its service level and overall dining experience. Full marks go to the Chef.

We visited on evening of 12th Feb 2020 weekday."
Drop in food standard!,"We had cny lunch at this reputable restaurant, but end up very disappointed with the food quality and service attitude!

First we had the sashimi yusheng, which was quite good, eagerly looking forward to the other dishes. We were all looking at one and other when we try the abalone, it was hard, not tender at all, never a restaurant standard! Moreover wanhao! Omg! Next the cod fish, another omg dish, wonder how long was the stock kept, it was not fresh! You can really taste the fishy odour! Very disappointed with this kind of standard! Never expect all 'excellent' , but at least all 'good' from such reputable restaurant, however they surprised us by achieving 2 'poor'! Putting such quality food to waste! Reckon some coffee shop chi char store can do better then them!

Told the server about the abalone and showed her how hard it was by cutting, asked her to reflect to the chef. Till end of lunch, neither the chef nor the manager bother to come forward to apologise or explain, another 'terrible' achievement by such reputable restaurant! Never before have I encountered such service in a restaurant like this. When there is a problem like this, normally the chef will be more anxious then the customers, its his or her reputation, but not this case! Maybe the sou chef was not on shift that day??

Looks are really deceiving! All the foods in the photo look so yummy.....but not the case! Will not visit them again! No faith for such food quality and service!"
I asked to see a menu and,"I asked to see a menu and what you have for single visitors. She showed several items I could order. Everything else would serve 6-10 people.

After waiting 15 mins started my order only to find what I wanted was not a single order. I ended up with some rice and pork. It was okay. W
Busboy came and cleared plates.

I waited 20 - 30 more mins to get the attention of my waitress to get my bill.

The busboy was feeling sorry for me as he could see I was getting irritated."
Great food at fine price,"Good food, attentive service, and a long wine list of excellent wines to choose from. The price is a bit high for the overall great experience.

We had a lovely dinner, where we had a total of 5 dishes. Bean skin roll and pig tendon were both exciting and delicious. Hong Kong Kai Lan was a nice touch of greens quite simply prepared. The clay pot tofu and clay pot chicken were both aromatic and distinctive flavors. Overall, all the dishes were well prepared.

The wine list is broad and our choice proved to be excellent for the occasion.

The few minor areas for improvement would be to help the non-Chinese to pick a diverse set of dishes that embodies the flavor of Cantonese cuisine and the restaurant. Perhaps multi-course set dinners could be offered with associated (local) drink pairings."
Dinner,"Good staff service , high food quality, excellent dining environment, reasonable price, highly recommended! Must try!"
Night friend gathering,"Food 👍👍👍,good food quality,friendly staff with excellent services,beautiful and cool environments. Highly recommended!"
"Good environment, kind and","Good environment, kind and friendly staff,high quality food, very good service ,highly recommended,must try!"
Review of the Restaurant,Food and service is excellent. The char siew is very delicious. The staff is very welcoming and warming. The environment is also excellent.
"Very good service, good quality","Very good service, good quality food and drinks, nice environment, kind staff,highly recommended!must try!"
Good quality dim sum,"Had lunch there with my family and what stood out was the dim sum. Although it was understandably pricey (approx $2.50 per piece on average), it was worth it and comparable to Wah Lok at Carlton hotel. We also ordered 4 main dishes using the HSBC Entertainer and the bill came up to about $210 for 5 pax. No complimentary parking available. They were a little busy at lunch so at times it was more difficult to get the wait staff's attention."
Don't do takeaways ... especially Peking Duck,"On a recommendation from a friend I ordered a whole Peking duck from Wan Hao. I think the presentation speaks for itself

Imagine when the supposed centre piece of a company department lunch was unpacked, someone casually commented it look like it was bought from a hawker centre.

It was very disappointing and embarrassing"
Very very good,Had a great time Tasty dishes Very tasty and rich I only wish waiters were able to explain a like bit why they suggested a dish Otherwise excellent Highly recommended Would return Plz give this review a thumbs up
Wan Hao is not so Hao,"Atmosphere and pricing are at the same level as the top Cantonese restaurants in Singapore. The food, however, is the worst. Don’t get me wrong: it is good, but it is not as innovative, delectable or memorable as any of the premier Chinese restaurants in a Singapore. Even in the Orchard Road area alone, there are many that are better, either at shopping malls (ION, Takashimaya, Paragon), or hotels (Four Seasons, Shangri-La, Regent, Orchard)."
Deliciously Yummy Food,Came to try their promotional chicken floss with salted egg crab creation. It’s so delicious and not too overwhelming with the salted egg. Another item they introduced us was their specialty superior soon hock fish soup. Broth was thick and creamy & I really love it! Full of collagen! They really prepared it with fresh & quality ingredient. A must try when you visit!
Impeccable Service + Extraordinary Dishes,We came for dinner with our colleagues. The service here is prompt and the dishes are very unique - not your usual Chinese fare. The photos speak for themselves :)
Great restaurant!,"Superb service and amazing food! Love the seafood here. Location is fantastic, right in the middle of Orchard Road."
Super customer service,"Its the first time me friends and I try out Wan Hao, we have A la cart lunch and food turns out better than expected.
But what impress me the most is the excellent service the waiters and the waitresses provide. They are very attentive and professional. They are the ones who make our day."
Comfort food for the family!,"My Daughter & grand kids were away in the US and requested for their favorite dishes at Wan Hao upon their immediate return. They
were not disappointed and were also greeted by familiar & friendly faces. After the meal, we were all smiling and were pleased as pie!
Hooray to our comfort food!"
Food and service,Food- loved every bite! -ambience- elegant; service- gold rated! Most tables were full with us as the only Non Asian customers. We savoured every bite after spending much time deciding what would give us a taste of as many dishes as possible! Thank you for giving us a taste delight !
Celebrations dinner,"Very meaningful dinner last night. We are do enjoyed the food and service here. May always service was excellent and she always taken care of us, she is caring when my friend not feeling well she bring over a glass of warm water . May also take initiatives to bring us chilli padi with soya sauce without asking . her memory was so good she remember all her regular guest in Wan Hao. I was so happy to seeing her every time I back to Singapore. Congratulations to the company that you can has such a good royalty staff with you. Food was delicious and creative especially the last course of crabmeat fried rice with salted eggs crab claw. But only one thing need to take note all dishes if can serve in better temperatures will be much better . See you next visit ."
AWESOME !!,"Wan Hao Restaurant at Marriot Singapore offers a nice selection of dim sum and its delicious! All the ingredients used are fresh and the other dishes on the menu are just as tasty We love the Peking duck, skin is so crispy wrap in the soft flour skin dip in the sauce is simply heavenly!
We brought our friends from Japan and New Zealand to Wan Hao and they are just full of praise for the food. Desserts are creative and yummy, Oiishi"
Would love to go back it was SO good.,"We were there early and it was quiet with only another table of guests but soon go busy. Lots of families which is good I guess but some of the kids were a bit too rowdy and ran around which lessened the nice ambiance.

We have never had such a fancy nice menu, sadly most American Chinese food even in good restaurants is predictable with similar dishes. That is not the case here though.

Our first course was the deep fried whitebait with seaweed, salt & pepper and then my wife had the hot & sour soup but I enjoyed the braised superior stock with hashima, lobster & crab roe soup which was superb. We followed that with the Australian abalone with sea cucumber & chef secret sauce, stir fried scallop, prawn and celery with black truffle sauce and ended with the lobster with green onion steamed in Chinese wine. They have an excellent wine list and we had 2011 Chateau de Fonbel, Saint-Emilion Grand Cru which may have been a bit much for so many seafood dishes but we enjoyed it none the less!"
"Great Ambience, Awesome Food",We celebrated our father birthday here and thoroughly enjoyed the food choices especially the Peking duck & truffle prawn.
Service needs help!,"The dishes that we did get to eat in the restaurant were good but the front of house service lets this place down. It was disappointing from the start. No welcome, no explanation of the menu, no drinks offered apart from Chinese tea, food cold - could go on. The two courses that we did have were tasty so the food is certainly good but chefs let down by front of house."
"Authentic Chinese Cuisine for Family, Friends and Business Clients","The excellent ambience and service makes it a great place to entertain. However, advance booking is advised as the restaurant is usually fully booked by regular clients.
The outstanding dishes we had were the Peking Duck, Fish slices with XO sauce and tender beef cubes. The Dim Sum dishes are also best in town and Must Try."
Good lunch with new chef,We had lunch there after learning that there is a new Chef. We were not disappointed ! Better than the Wan Hao in Marriot Hong Kong!
WOW,"Absolutely blown away by this restaurant.
Hands down, this is my favorite Chinese restaurant.
I loved and i'm obsessed with every single dish I ate, especially the pecking duck, WOW!!! You should've seen how that was served. The service was top class honestly, so elegant and so polite.

I can't express just how much I enjoyed this experience at Wan Hao.

The ambience was very cozy, authentic, and quite romantic.

I loved the traditional design inside the venue, also the music adds a lot to the mood.

A must must must try!!"
Authentic,"The best food we had this trip. Little bit hard to find but it absolutely worth it.
Peking duck, dim sum, dumplings, crispy chicken, fried rice... make sure you ask your server for recommendations. We really enjoyed the table side Peking duck and a good glass of wine."
Wonderful dinner experience,Recently me and my girlfriend went to wanhao restaurant to had our dinner. Never did we expected we had a sumptuous dinner and the service staff was excellent. The prawn in the photo was really delicious and I will come back and had dinner again.
great authentic Cantonese cuisine,nice n great black chicken tonic soup. without MSG.. natural ingredient n soup tasty n sweet. great service also
Fantastic Service,I went to the restaurant with my boyfriend and had an amazing time there.The ambience was fantastic and the waiters and waitresses were very attentive and considerate of us. The food were awesome too! Highly recommended!
Wonderful dining experience!,"Brought my family out with the intention of having a sumptous dinner! And without any letdown, everything was amazing, from the food served to the staff that were serving us. The ambience was fantastic too."
Excellent quality food - service a bit slow,"I last viisted Wan Hao, a restaurant that we frequented a lot, a couple of years ago, and stopped going because the food was very disappointing - and of course in Singapore we're spoiled for choice when it comes to Chinese food.
But I went again recently, on Mother's Day to be precise, and was very pleasantly surprised. The restaurant seems to have made an effort to upgrade the quality of its dishes, which were top notch all the way across from the xiao long bao to the egg tarts. My only criticism was that service was a bit slow - perhaps they were overawed by Mothers Day as the restaurant seemed really full. The only other negative is the location as it's a pain to park in the area but in the end the food made it worthwhile."
Simple 5-course dinner,"Had a voucher for Wan Hao Chinese restaurant for 2 persons.

Our 5-course dinner was simple, yet tasty and filling for both of us. Food was nicely presented and service was attentive. Hubby loved the chilled mango pomelo that was served with coconut ice cream and the steamed halibut.

Lovely place to dine and we could tell that there were quite a number of regular patrons there."
"Poor service, how did they get a Michelin star?","I went for dinner with my family and despite having booked for 4, they stuffed us into a table more suitable for 2. To add insult to injury, they did not even bother to clear plates that had begun to pile on the tiny table so i had to remove them myself using the trestle table near the foyer, hawker centre style. The food took a long time to appear and when it did was stone cold, probably had been sitting in the kitchen for a while given the barely existent service."
A dining experience with quality,"First time trying this Chinese restaurant with family of four. We were given a nice seating area. Tasteful decor with high end cutlery. Service is prompt.

Tried the following dishes:
1) Peking duck - Crispy and overall taste is memorable

2) Truffle prawns with broccoli - Succulent, with a lovely sauce, every bite is addictive

3) Spinach tofu - The best we have tasted. Good toufu, well cooked spinach and sauce is not overwhelming

4) Crispy Chicken - very well roasted and moist. A must try

5) Fried Noodle Ee Mian - disappointing with a charred taste. Too salty"
10/10 for Food quality,Visited the restaurant first time after coming back to Singapore and decided to give it a try. Ms. Fion was attending to our table and she gave us great suggestions. The food was superb especially the tea menu. Definitely coming back again.
NO SERVICE NO GREETING,"In the past we have been there, few days ago a big delusion!
We had to ask time by time for water, tea , food ; no one was following our table! We got very very spicy soups without proper explanation by waiters. After an expensive check we went back alone without any greeting by the staff, never again!!!"

Excellent service and food,"I had dinner with gf last night at Wan Hao. I really appreciate the service as it was so nice. The staff led me to the table and recommended a lot of tasteful dishes. I suggest to register and become a member, lots of promotions waiting for you to enjoy."
Service questionable,Basically I am not impressed because it was a birthday lunch and requested for a birthday bun which booked thru CHOP APP and the end we didn’t get the birthday bun nor mentioned about it at all. Then why in the first place asked for celebrating for an occasion...
The Best Chinese Restaurant and Staffs,"We visit Wan Hao Chinese Second Time. We order some signature dishes like peking duck, Black truffle prawn and Beef tenderloin.
All dishes are high quality. Also all service staffs provide excellent service. Winnie welcome us with warm smile and recommend dishes for us, May take care of our needs. Kristin and Cheng An serve wine, peking duck for us with professional knowledge and skills .
Appreciate your nice service.
We have a great night here.
Thanks again."
Excellent staffs,"We enjoy a great night in Wan Hao Chinese Restaurant, nice Peking duck and desserts. Thanks for courtesy staffs, Winnie, May, Kirstin, Cheng An. They provide good service and always smile. We love this restaurant so much."
Outstandingly good,"@TheKuoKnows

Dim Sum in Singapore doesn’t get much better than this. Wan Hou is one of the best exponents of the popular lunchtime delicacy.

The Char Siew Bao is unbelievably fluffy. The Taro is graced by an abalone on top, which explains why they cost $5 a pop.

Try the Pork Puffs. They are outstandingly moreish. The Beef Ho Fun is full of Wok Hei, the subtle caramalisation that defines the dish.

Wan Hou is now on my go-to restaurant for Dim Sum."
Excellent food,"First time dining in wan hao Chinese restaurant at Marriott.
Peking duck with Chinese crepe is the best dish. And we also try some dim sum,it is quite nice!
Good atmosphere and courtesy staffs, they recommend some dishes for us, and they have good knowledge about their food!"
Disappointing experience,"service standards have slipped. Long waits for food, tea went unpoured, plates unchanged, and empty dishes uncleared. We waited for half an hour between our appetisers (yusheng and char siew) and the next courses.

The wait staff seemed really harried although the restaurant wasn’t full - it was hard to get their attention. They could have done with a few more waiters, which is what you would expect from a restaurant that is supposed to provide a fine dining experience.

When we told one of the waitresses that the service wasn’t very good, we got a brusque ‘sorry’. They started pushing food out faster after that.

The food was decent but I’m sad that this restaurant’s service is no longer what it used to be. At these prices - there are many other Cantonese restaurants that offer a better experience."
Delicious food nice service,"It’s my third time to come here. And I’ll come back next time.
All food is good and delicious.
May and Harvey’s service is nice."
Good Dim Sum,First time here for friend’s wedding. Very good food. Will come back again to try their dim sum next time.
Great Peking duct,"Ive never had only the crispy skin cut and put in the crepes before but it was lovely, they cut the meat up into another dish, I chose fried rice but this was a mistake as it was a waste of the meat, the other option was with noodles. This restaurant is expensive but the food & service is very good. The restaurant is located in a hotel and there are no views"
Best Dim Sum in Singapore,"Go to Wan Hao at Marriott and Jiang Nan Chun at Four Seasons Singapore for the best dim sum in Singapore.

Wan Hao is an upscale, private space with 10 tables or so. Service was swift and attentive.

The Dim Sum plates (we ordered 4 portions in total, one portion of 2 pieces at SGD5-6) were as good as those in HK. I am sure there were a few chefs from HK working in the kitchen. And the prices were far more reasonable than Jiang Nan Chun (stunning decor).

The superb wok-fried beef rice noodle was a mere SGD26 for a good portion.
Tea was exceedingly expensive at SGD14 per person. Not worth the money in my opinion.

Highly satisfying lunch experience."
Dim sum is delicious,"Pleasant dining experience, dim sum is really delicious. I would definitely recommend family and friends to dine there."
"Food is decent but at a price, service can be improved",We ate here for dinner in August as a family gathering as my parents were in town from Australia. Food is always good but at a price and is not considered cheap. A meal for 4 pax can be up to S$300. But the service could be improved as the waiters were just interested in getting other people's orders and I could see our food been left on the serving table and not served til 10-15mins later. I was very tempted to just actually pick up the dish myself and serve it ourselves as I don't like food to be served cold. I have worked in the hospitality industry before and one should never leave the food on the serving table and must be served first before other things.
First Visit this restaurant,"We ordered half Bejing Duck with two eating. The duck skin eating not bad, only a few pity that the wrap is cold when we eating, so taste is not so good. The second eating is fried Yee Mian with duck meat, I felt a little bit smell of the duck meat. Although the smell not too strong, just a little bit, but I thought the high quality restaurant should provide very fresh food."
Service Excellence,"Had dinner at Wan Hao Chinese restaurant several times. Service is consistently good.
The new Manager, Cynthia Lai impresses with her strong leadership skills and service excellence.

"Good Foods, Ambience and Service","A good venue for get together and meals with nice decor.The foods were delicious and fresh which particularly like the signature chicken and fish maw soup. Being a member of Marriott club, we enjoyed bill's discount. Particularly mention the reservation team and staff Cynthia for their good service. I am sure we will be back again."
Wonderful experience,Really enjoyed the entire course meal and the welcoming and friendly staff made my overall dining experience even better! Better mention to Cynthia and her fellow staffs for the kind and friendly service! Would definitely visit again!
Dim Sum Lunch,Food was great and so was service. Ben was very attentive and Cynthia was just a gem. Thanks for a great lunch experience.
Excellent service,My family comes here very often for weekend treat. What a joy to be taken to this first class restaurant at orchard road. The food was nice. The service was excellent even they are short of staff. All the staffs are great-hearted and friendly.
Enjoyable meal,"Really didn’t know what to expect but was welcomed by the staff and helped with our choices.

Certainly not catering for British tastes as very authentic.

Well worth the cost."
Horrendous Experience,"Dinner on 24 November at Wan Hao, HUGE Mess after previous Restaurant Manager Jenny left Marriott. Made us wait for 35mins for 1 more last dish, ended up waitress informed us Kitchen had forgotten it due to short of manpower and several VVIP tables.. Well, thought Marriott is a 5-star property whose F&B outlet should be able carry the brand, indeed disappointing till disgusting stage."
Meet up dinner,Food and ambience is nice but disappointed with the complimentary parking cateria.Despite spending $204 on the food bill just two of us we are not entitled to the complimentary parking. I just wonder how much the management expect us to consume.I rather they not offer the complimentary parking.
Dinner,Had dinner at Wan Hao with my colleagues after work. The food was great & service was very good too. Definitely recommend this place to my family & friends
Warm gathering,"It was a nice dinner and met up with friends.
Good food especially the Iberico Black Pork a must try. Signature fried rice is also very nice.
May is serving with good recommendations and great service with her team. Must come back again."
Dinner with friends,"Dined here in Nov 2018, food and service was excellent. Many thanks to May for the recommendations. We had a great time!"
Excellent lunch at Wan Hao,"First time dining at Wan Hao Chinese restaurant. Here provide good food and warm service! May introduce menu patiently with us. And Kirstin, Wan ting, Chun Xiao always smile to us! The best Chinese restaurant in Singapore!
Look forward next time dining in this restaurant"
Nice food nice service,"Each food is delicious. Every server is good ,then Wei hao is the best. Thank you for your nice attitude and service."
Good service,"First time visited wan hao with my friends. They recommended me here to try the food here. First we have ordered Beijing duck, the skin was very crispy and nice. Also need to try the black truffles mayonnaise crispy prawn. Service was good and very take care of our table. Will come again."
Wonderful Service and Great Food,"We had a great great time and the food is delicious. Wonderful service from May. Very attentative and friendly.

Nice ambience.
Recommendation: Claypot Rice (good to order in advance) Roast Chicken. Peking Duck.

Also must try their dim sum during lunch. Is yummy.

Overall is good place to dine and for gathering with family and friends."

We have been loyal supporters of Wan Hao for many years and the service standards of Christine and Benjamin on Wednesday, 31 October 2018, 1pm, is unacceptable.

We sincerely hope the effective management of Marriott and Wan Hao will implement immediate service recovery action.

Special compliments with gratitude to May for taking good care of us during our every visit over the years and we sincerely appreciate her genuine service.

Thanks to Winnie for stepping forward to understand more about our complain at 230pm, unfortunately she was not able to assist much."
Good Food and Ambience,"Love the food there. We had gone there to celebrate my birthday, and it was also because it is on the Entertainer app. Due to our one-for-one deals, the food was value for money. I will return again next year if possible, when my Entertainer app deals are renewed."
Good and quality food with reasonable price,Good and quality food - serves some special dishes that impressed eg - Beef Tenderloin with chilled marinated sour plum pear and light wasabi sauce (highly recommended) and the Shrimp dumpling with black truffle. The steam pork ribs also not bad. Will go back again to try more dishes and dim sum.

Tasty sea abalones and sea cucumbers,My mom and I are fans of abalones and sea cucumbers. This is a place where we usually satisfy our craving. The ambience is great.
Wan Hao Chinese Restaurant,Wan Hao Chinese Restaurant is located right at the start of Orchard Road belt (inside the Marriot Tangs Plaza Hotel). It is a fine dining Chinese restaurant. We had the Braised Lobster with Assorted Seafood which was very tasty & the portions were very reasonable. The crispy and flavourful famous Peking Duck is matched perfectly when served with authentic Chinese crepe. Wan Hao is also known for serving up good authentic dim sum as well.
