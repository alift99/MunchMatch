"Great Service, Tasty Food","We had a great time. Special thanks to Doreen for all the arrangements & for the flexibility to suit our plans. She is so warm & welcoming. Also thanks to Yudi, Mawong, Vanisa & Shah for making our lunch a wonderful one.

We will surely come back!"
"Outstanding food, really friendly staff","Amazing food with an array of authentic Indonesian flavours. We visited while on holiday in Singapore and the staff were so friendly and accommodating, and we were made to feel very welcome. The pricing is very reasonable and affordable, especially considering the standard of what they produce.

On the day we visited it so happened a high ranking foreign government delegation was eating there, which once again probably demonstrates how Indochili punch way above their weight in terms of quality of food and service!

All food is halal."
Great Food Great Service,"Everything we ordered was delicious: gado gado, sotong, oxtail soup, beef rendang, tahu telor, chendol, and avocado drink. Doreen was very helpful and friendly. We will be back."
Nice place and food,"Very delicious 😋, will go again . Very delicious 😋, will go again . Very delicious 😋, will go again ."
"Yummlicious food, efficient and reliable customer services","I chanced upon this Halal restaurant when scouting for bento sets for my corporate lunch event. Menu is good w lots of varieties including vegetarian option, Ron, the Manager even customized the bento set specially for my event after knowing the person's preferences (very flexible and customer-orientated where most caterers don't allow changes to their Bento sets). Most importantly, food arrived ON TIME, NEATLY PACKED and their lime juices are real juices with lots of lime slices. Highly recommended indeed. Thank you Ron & team!"
Great food and service,"The menu great variety of foods; staff were very friendly and attentive. Food was fresh and reasonably priced. We didn't really like having to order via the QR code, but it was actually very easy."
Good food and Good service,"Just had a family dinner to celebrate my wife’s birthday. It was my first time dining and the service was remarkable. The service was great. Mr Ron who served us was friendly and patient to explain the different dishes. Even the staff who made the drinks was friendly . She even helped us to serve the plates for the birthday cakes. Food was tasty , meat was tender. I recommend Soup Betawi and Satae Sapi. Thank you Indochilli !"
Selection of excellent dishes,"Welcoming, excellent fresh food and drinks.

We arrived just in time for last orders at 9pm. Quickly ordered a selection of dishes for 5 of us.
The food arrived quickly and were very good. All the dishes were fresh and tasty.
Particularly liked the satay, and ikan bilis kacang (camarelised peanuts and dry fish - amazing).

Would also recommend the scarlet ginger tea and passion fruit cream sodas ."
Decent Indonesian Food,"I had a dinner appointment with an oversea muslim business associate & my colleague recommended to try out this restaurant.
We 3 pax came here for a week day dinner. We ordered
: ayam bumbu rujak (chicken)
: gado gado ulek
: kangkung balado
: perkedel (potato fritter)
: signature ayam panggang (chicken)
: tauhu telur
: nasi kuning.

2 chicken dishes were well marinated, cooked to perfection (close to) & flavourful. My guests love the sambal to go with ayam panggang.
Fried kang kung with sambal was delicious.

However the good points stop here !!

Their signature dish - tauhu telur (tofu egg) is a popular indonesian dish . Its contains of beancurd crisppy fried in egg butter, drizzled with sweet source.
It was rather disappointing ordinary dish and i dont understand all the overhyped!!

The perkedel was quite oily, mashy.

Gado Gado (mixed vegetable, tofu, egg, cracker & drizzled with peanut dressing) - it was rather mushy & the ingredients were stuck together. It was rather an unpleasant dish.

Overall it was a decent indonesian food.

My dining experience did not match to the high google rating ! Had we ordered the wrong dishes?
Do note the restaurant does not serve free water & bottle water is SGD1.50 each

Will i be back ? Hmmm, probably not

Best Bento,"1st time trying out IndoChili as it was rated as one of the best Bento in Singapore.

I am so glad that the choice made was a good one. Not only does the food looks appetizing, it really taste amazingly delicious! Good feedback on the food! And the delivery was very prompt too. This will not be our last bento order for sure."
5/5,Super friendly and accommodating service by Doreen & Team. Food is of exceptional quality! Must try their Fish Set. Oh and the food prepared and served fast than we expected.
Enak!,I always come here whenever I miss Indonesian food. Very tasty and good service. They also have delivery service via deliveroo so it is so much helpful.
Prompt and efficient delivery of bento sets,"Ordered 22 bento sets to be delivered to 22 different locations for a virtual event that I'm facilitating, and the restaurant was both accomodating and prompt with handling my order and arranging for the timely delivery, will order from them again if opportunity arises, well done!"
"Food excellent, service excellent",I visited indochil at Tanjong Pagar I enjoyed the food and the service. I was impressed with Doreen who only service staff handle the customer by herself. She deserved to be award best service staff and thank you Doreen for your outstanding service
Service and food taste has dropped,We ordered veg soup and it only came with soup and jackfruit. No other veg until we asked of. And the Chinese lady who served us was very hostile. Not the same type of service or food taste as what I had tasted pre covid. I also experienced abdomen pain and gastric reflexes the next day. Not worth visiting such a place.
Surly staff and reheated tasteless food,"Had lunch at the Zion Road outlet based on the glowing reviews of previous diners. I am not sure if the previous diners are talking about the same restaurant when they gave 4 or 5 stars because every dish that we ordered has terrible. The bergedil was soaked in oil and dark brown, their signature chicken was not-fresh chicken with a lump of curry paste slapped onto of it, the rendang was extremely dry and tasteless, the Tahu telor was a mess of badly fried Tahu soaking in oil. All the dishes were basically refried or reheated and then left sitting in the kitchen because all dishes were cold upon serving. All dishes were tasteless. This is an insult to Indonesian cuisine.
Moreover, the staff at the door was surly and sour throughout our visit. So, either we had extremely bad luck on the day we visited or maybe stick to the Bento boxes as reviewed by other diners. Anyway, we definitely won't be visiting any of their outlets in the future. Waste of money.
Note to Management:-
If you want to run a restaurant, at least provide a friendly service and good quality food. We are paying customers and just wanted to appreciate Indonesian cuisine, which you failed to deliver."
Fantastic food with superb service,"Ordered 18 sets of bento for colleagues, due to staggered lunch hours, requested for early hours delivery at 11 am. Though they promised will reach before 1115 when I place my order. The food actually reached me at 11am. So impressed! All give 2 thumbs up on the quality n presentation of the food ."
Delivery for customers,"Ordered bento sets for customers. Excellent service, good food. Delivery on time. Accommodating staff. Highly recommended."
Nice food and cozy place,Nice dishes especially the green chili chicken. Es teler is also nice. Service is very good and friendly ....
Delicious Nasi Tumpeng,I ordered Nasi Tumpeng for the celebration. It is very delicious with beautiful presentation. The chicken rendang is well marinated. Highly recommended
Good Food!,"Reasonable fresh fish for its price, and chicken is tender. Please do try their chilli! Homemade lemongrass with no sugar option. 😋"
Indochili Indonesian Food at Tg Pagar Center,Food is excellent and authentic taste of Indonesian food their service very good friendly and helpful
Compliment for doreen,Very good service Ms doreen. First time here. Will visit more nx time. And highly recommended thank u
Nice food with a friendly staff,"Love the food that served by this restaurant. Order tumpeng twice from their place and still love the taste of their food. Especially the rendang, it's highly recommended for beef lover. Staff very accommodate even though I place order last minute."
Fantastic Charcoal Grills & authentic Indon flavours,"Had a superb dinner last night, please take the recommendations from the wait staff. The young man recommended the platter with a delicious charcoal grilled (""bakar"") fish, bakar chicken, satay, sotong & prawns. The food all has very authentic Indon taste, and we even ordered more chicken satay which was plump juicy almost like a kebab, different shape from local malay satay. slathered in smooth Indon peanut paste expertly mixed with Indon sweet kicap manis sauce, we almost forgot how much we like local satay for this new experience! The gao-gado salad also has delicious creamy peanut sauce, making it different from local malay gado-gado, but so very appetising. Must also try the ""Balado"", which is a very fresh red or green(Hijau Balado) chilli topping they pair with various meats or seafood. We opted for the bakar chicken hijau balado and it was a hard fight to decide if we preferred it to the bakar chicken in the platter, they were both fantastic. Apart from the Tahu Telor (Egg Beacurd Tower), we also tried a coconut milk vegetable soup with (we think) tamarind or lemongrass giving it a lovely fragrance. The kids loved the yellow rice, insisting it is nicer than white rice, but the older folk enjoyed everything equally with white rice, though we were super full. Ah Kong loved his avocado drink which they recommended with Gula Melaka instead of the usual chocolate sauce, since he was not used to chocolate with avocado, and he said it was good. Kudos to young chef Ishak who expertly helms the charcoal fire and puts the essence of fire flavour in all the grilled foods! we are already planning the next trip. Easy to park with streetside parking all around Zion Road including hawker centre carpark, or across the street at Great World City. we had a pleasant after dinner stroll along the park connector from Indochilli."
Nasi Langgi,"I've been ordering Nasi Langgi for takeaway for the third time, it's delicious! I'm a native Indonesian and I approve of the authenticity."
Indonesian restaurant with a nice vibe,"Located in a shophouse, this quaint Indonesian restaurant has a nice vibe. Food is tasty and reasonably priced, good for takeout too."
Excellent Service,"Good experience with fantastic service provided by all the service crew, the food and drink was very nice."
Excellent Indonesian dishes. Favourite Gado Gado,"Authentic Indonesian food. The dishes have a complexity of taste which I enjoy. The spices enhanced my dining experience. My favourite dish was Gado Gado. The sauce was creamy and the ingredients fresh. The only gripe is the dishes were lukewarm. I would prefer the food warmer. The food was served quickly. Attentive and warm service. The decor was nice and comfortable. The Balinese music added to the ambience. It was not too crowded. I paid $97 for 5 dishes, 3 plates of rice and 3 drinks."
All food is either too sweet,"All food is either too sweet or tastless.
Everything is way below expectations. Wouldnt mind paying if food is good. Unreasonable price for the standard."
Horrible experience,"Horrible experience ordering a tumpang for Hari Raya. Refuse to confirm my order and extremely slow reply, when it finally came it's a miserable small platter and way overpriced. I understand its peak period but if you can't deliver then don't offer it for sale."
Excellent Ambience and Food,"The ambience of this Indonesian restaurant was pleasant. It was suitably dim and offered indoor and outdoor seatings.

Orders were placed via an iPad, which seems to be the preferred way of order-taking for most restaurants these days. It also makes good sense to have photos of the pdishes on the iPad so customers would know what they ordering.

Indonesian cuisine is known for its spiciness and, as I was not too fond of chilli, I chose the Beancurd Omelette, BBQ Chicken and Long Beans. Accompanied with Rice, the meal was satisfactory with the chosen dishes. I would recommend a glass of hot Lemongrass Tea to complete the meal. I think it is an excellent beverage for any meal.

In fact, I would not hesitate to dine here again, if I am ever in the area."
A nice Indonesian restaurant with very good service,"Wide range of choices. However, do try beef rendang, gado-gado salad and also the satay. They also has an interesting range of mocktails worth trying too. Very attentive and friendly service. Parking on the roadside is not possible but opposite the restaurant is Great World City with plenty of parking spaces"
excellent food!,"we ordered from this restaurant at least a dozen times before visiting it recently. The restaurant is right across from great world city. the ambience is family friendly and laid back. The food is good and the gadoh gadoh and tahu telor are the best I have had in a restaurant. everything we ordered tasted great. My only suggestion for the restaurant is that they need to expand on their vegetarian choices. they have a few but no way near enough. cost - about 40$ per head for a sumptuous meal with entres and dessert.

well worth a visit."
Great dining experience!,Doreen and team was very accommodating and gave really good service. Good food too! Will come again for sure!
This is a take-out joint,"Very mediocre quality of food. The wait staff was very pleasant. We went there, reading many good reviews on the web. It appears in the top 4-5 Indonesian restaurants in Singapore. Most reviews and articles are fake. Avoid at all costs."
Good food and better desserts,"Food is tasty but some dishes might not be spicy enough for those used to fiery dishes. The sauce for the grilled squid was disappointing. The ikan bakar kecap (grilled pomfret), ayam panggang padang (Padang-style grilled chicken), ayam bumbu rujak and kacang panjang belado were delicious. The gado gado ulek is tasty but the sauce is more sweet than spicy. Same thing with the nasi goreng seafood. For dessert, skip the es cendol and go straight for the es delima and es teler. Worth a second visit to try their numerous other dishes."
Delicious food,This has been our third visit to this restaurant. Every time we return to Singapore we stop by here for dinner. The food has been delicious every time and the service is excellent !
"Good atmosphere, great service, delicious food","Went with my family, had a scrumptious lunch..the service was great, friendly. Food arrived not very long. I recommend all to come here..."
Delicious food with helpful attentive staffs,"The food here is really good and authentic, best part is its not overly expensive, very affordable! Staff - Shima was very attentive, noticed that i didnt ordered a drink and offered me water :) All staffs are smiley through my dinner, enjoyed my time there!"
Small restaurant with complete Indonesian menu..,"Small halal restaurant, but serving complete Indonesian menu (from gado-gado to nasi goreng), with good taste, really Indonesian taste."
It’s a real treat - Try it out,"Just finished lunch with family that live locally, very tasty indeed, the menu has a great verity and the food was gorgeous only let down was the Satay sauce that came with the chicken, not crunchy enough. But the beef Satay was AMAZING!!!!"
Compliments to the Chef and service staff,Great place for a family meal. Great food and great service. DOREEN was excellent on her service. Gave very good recommendations for the menu.
Awesome experience.,I loved most of their food. Authentic. Flavourful. Unique taste. Staff service is excellent. Simply loved each dishes that I've tried.
Halal food,"I like sop buntut, sate maranggi. The taste is delicious. Want to come here again, again and again. The price is a little bit expensive but I think that’s fine because the taste is good"
Not very authentic,"Wasn’t very impressed with the food.

Tahu telor was done very differently and there was more batter than tofu.

Gadogado was too sweet.

The kentang kacang was stuck to our teeth, not crunchy at all.

Tempe goreng quite soggy and too much batter too.

Urap was fine.

Other dishes were just soso. Been too way better Indonesian restaurants in Singapore.

Don’t think we will return"
Excellent Authentic Indonesian Cuisine!,Had the best Ayam Bakar that one can find in Singapore central area! Staff are friendly and the service is fast and hassle-free!
Meeting Lunch,Best Gado Gado and Tahu Goreng....!!!! Yummz..... the keropok is fabulous!! The drink lemon grass is a must.. tasty and fragrant. Staff Nicole very polite and attentive!!
Excellent Indonesian food,The taste of Gado Gado and tahu Telor are so good. Must come and eat again. Took these pics halfway otherwise will be finished soon.
Gado gado!,"Not the first time that I had dinner at IndoChili, always delicious! Tonight I tried their gado gado (a cold vegetarian dish with vegetables, lontong rice, tofu and warm satay sauce) for the first time and it was soooo good! Staff very friendly and efficient."
"Yummy Food, Good Service","This is not my first dining experience with IndoChilli. I once visited the science park outlet for my section lunch. We had pre-ordered Nasi Tumpeng. One of the 'must-try' dishes in this restaurant. As the science park area is an office lunch hour hot spot, it is understandable how staff have to cater quickly and correctly to guests. IndoChilli did not lack in service, quality. I had my dad's birthday dinner last night at Zion Road outlet. We made the reservation a week early. The e-mail response was very prompt. At the outlet, the staff was very friendly and informative. The food was good and yummy. We had a good dining experience. If there is one thing that is bad, it is the chairs. The sofa is too low for a dining session. Thank you Indochilli. Well-Worth!"
Good Spicy Food!,"I do not look Asian, so the waitress did not know initially how to communicate with me, she handed me a tablet with their menu and ordering app on it which worked great. I ordered some Nasi Goreng and Cumi Bakar Jimbaran which were all nicely cooked and spicy. All that with a Jus Jeruk that helped with the spicy flavors. Service was fast and efficient, wish I were able to sample more dishes but it was more than enough with the two dishes ordered, if you like spicy food, this will be a good place to go."
Great food and even better service,"Went to the branch at tanjong pagar. Food was authentic and yummy. Considering the lack of staff, the service was prompt too. Special shout out to Miss Doreen. She managed to build rapport with all the customers and made everyone feel at home."
Sunday dinner at IndoChilli in Tanjong Pagar outlet,"As the Tanjong Pagar outlet is located in the CBD area, it’s usually quiet on a Sunday. We dined there around 6pm and placed our orders on an iPad. Food was served relatively quickly and it taste great! I’ve been to IndoChilli many times and for me the food standards has always been the same - quality food at reasonable prices. If you can, try to book an appointment via Eatigo to get some savings. Overall, I highly recommend eating here!"
Skip this place,"Cosy place and located opposite great world city. Read some good reviews and decided to check it out but was hugely disappointed. Very average Indon food and highly priced. Last order was at 9.30 and restaurant closes at 10pm but by 9.10, the staff wanted to settle the bill and started closing. I wanted to order something but i was put off by their behaviour. You can definitely get better food at affordable price elsewhere. So please skip this place!"
Disappointing Visit,"It is disappointing that the quality of food is no longer the same and as authentic as before, the Apart from the restaurant manager, the rest of the crew are non-Indonesian and Vietnamese songs are played in the background. The Kentang Kacang was soft and not the same as before."
Excellent food - ordered on an iPad,"We heard about this place on a web blog and grabbed a cab to get there as it is on the west side of Chinatown. Well worth it.

Given a menu and an iPad which we thought was just to read the menu in more detail but it is for placing your order.

We had beef rendang, a whole pomfret fish and some chilli and prawn paste veg, not forgetting plain rice and lime juice drinks.

Everything was excellent, although we didn't clean/eat the fish head as one of our friends in UK would have done.

It is a bit more expensive than other local restaurants but worth it.

Recommended."
Authentic Indonesian cuisine,"Food was scrumptious... but dessert a little beyond par. We had chendol & it turned out watery, not enough coconut milk & gula Melaka."
Indonesian Food,"Tried their Lontong Cap Go Meh and Mutton Curry Indo style. Nice and authentic. Wide menu variety Indo style including snacks such as risoles, kroket. Quite pricey but worth to try."
Great Service and Great Food,"The food is Great, Service is extremely good! Very authentic indonesian food, will definately go back again!"
Decent food but not fresh fish,Ordered the combo. The fried fish was not fresh at all. The meat was soggy... Feedback to the cashier and was offered a discount on the bill but unlikely to return.
Indonesian food with an Authentic Taste,"Had the nasi goreng combo, with ayam bumbu rujak and sate ayam madura. With the classic Avocado Juice on the side. Perfect meal to satisfy my Indo food craving"
World Class!,Great service great food! Best tai food I had in a while. The staff helped me go through the menu and explained everything perfectly. Thanks
Nice lunch with friends,"Nice place for lunch, good food, reasonably price, friendly staff and huge selection of food. I’ve tried most of their food as we went there by group so we shared. My favourite is the sate maranggi."
Fantastic Food!,"Although it can get a little warm due to the open concept, the food is amazing! I went with a party of 6 and all of us left with authentic Indonesian cuisine that doesn't break your bank account."
Food was above average but ...,Food was good. Ox-tail soup is a must have. Service was fast and place was half empty during lunch time on a Sunday. They don’t serve water. Bottled water placed on every table. But you have to pay for them. Have to ask for chilli/sambal. It didn’t come without requesting. Air-con?? Do they even switch it on? Sweating experience. A tad on the pricy side considering the overall experience.
Best in Town,"Simply the best Indonesian food you can find in Singapore, those who knew how Indonesian food is must know what I mean.

Service is good, stafs are friendly, definitely my place to go to have a good halal dinner.

I would suggest to try their gado-gado, variety of nasi goreng, or Sop Buntut for those coming here.

Bravo"
Won't be coming back again,"Decided to dine here for a farewell dinner for our helper who's going back to her hometown. The restaurant was surprisingly crowded for a Thursday night, so I thought I was lucky that I made reservation earlier. We ordered: Combo Bakaran, Beef Rendang, Tahu Telor, Kangkung Balado, Sop Buntut, Sate Ayam. Food came quite fast and tasted good especially the Tahu Telor that we ordered another round of Sate ayam and Tahu Telor (note: food portion are small). Drinks were served late and had to remind the server a few times. We could understand since they seems to be understaffed for almost a full house that night. The next day though, we all had some kind of tummy pain and diarrhoea. At first I thought it was just me not feeling well, however, my husband, my kids, my helpers also had diarrhoea. It was not a severe one, but enough to make me feel weak and feverish on Friday and gastric pain for the next few days. I sent a feedback e-mail to the restaurant regarding this. The person in charge replied my e-mail saying that they will investigate the matter. He called me the next day to report that he has made checks and found nothing. Nobody else has said anything other than myself apparently. He asked whether we all can eat spicy food? Of course, we are. My helpers even eat sambal for lunch and dinner every day. Although he apologised for the inconvenience as well as invited us to come back to dine again; also repeatedly saying, and stressing that everything is alright with me now; I would most likely will not come back again."
"Authentic food, Dreadful dessert","The appetisers and mains were good - authentically Indonesian and flavourful. The Ayam Satay Madura was outstanding as was the Gado Gado. But the chendol dessert was dreadful and for the price charged, was even more of an insult. It was tasteless, with ice chunks and diluted beyond recognition."
Taste of Indonesia,"IndoChili is an Indonesian restaurant in Singapore offering culinary delight found throughout Indonesia. The spread ranges from across the archipelago, showcasing its authentic flavours.

Rendang Sapi ($12.80) a.k.a Beef Rendang. This is LD’s favourite dish and she always order this when feasting on nasi padang. The version here is tasty and tender, absorbs the spices nicely. The gravy is thick and aromatic, definitely a “rice thief” dish. Sometimes, they serve meats that are a bit lean, they will get a perfect score if they uses more marbling cuts.

Sop Buntut ($16.80) – Oxtail soup. One of the most popular soup in Indonesia, know for its robust flavour and fall off the bone meat. Definitely, a must order dish here, the soup is robust and the fatty meat just falls off the tailbone. Squish the lime into the soup, for the contrasting twang and best eaten with emping.

Lontong Sayur Medan ($6.80) – Rice Cake with Vegetables Soup. It is normally served as a one-dish item, however, we just order this dish because we like the jackfruit in the soup. The rice cake is thick, sticky and bouncy, generously bask in rich vegetable soup.

Kangkung Balado ($9.80). Ok, this dish is definitely not for me. Looking at the amount of chilli they put inside it, I definitely did not touch the dish. However, LD & QC enjoy every bite of this dish.

Ayam Kari Padang ($9.80). Tender and succulent curry chicken, accompanied with a smooth and rich gravy. It is not too spicy and the gravy goes well with rice.

Sate Ayam Madura ($10.80). Madura is known as the Sate City in Indonesia. The meat is thick, nicely grilled and coated with kecap manis. I would prefer if they are more generous with the peanut gravy.

To go with all the rich dishes above is Achar ($3.80). This homemade pickle vegetables are good to provide the balance to all the dishes above.

I normally like to have the dishes above with white rice (Nasi Putih $1.50) or you can also try their Yellow Rice (Nasi Kuning $2.50).

One of the drinks that I like here is Jus Alpukat ($7.20). This Indonesian version of Avocado Juice has always been my favourite since young. It uses chocolate condensed milk to perk up the drink.

Service is friendly and the restaurant is decorated in traditional Javanese house.

Overall, the dishes in IndoChili seems to hit the right spot for us when we are craving for Indonesian food. The dishes taste and flavour are very close to those you can find in Indonesia. Definitely, a place to visit for Indonesian food. Cheers!!"
So so food but friendly service,"My colleague and I popped by for a quick lunch. This place has been around longer than most along the stretch of shophouses so we were naturally curious....

I had the Tumpeng Mini and my colleague the Nasi Goreng Seafood. The ayam bumbu rujak was a bit bland but everything else on my plate was agreeable (but not great). My colleague's food looked a little unappetizing when served so I didn't bother taking any pictures. Her verdict was it was so so. The sambal belacan elevated the taste.

However, we had the chicken satay as a side and that was pretty good.

The almond latte (iced) was also boring.

The service was attentive and friendly."
Nice food and servicve,"Our group of 18 staff went there for dinner for the 1st time and the staff was friendly and helpful. They recommend what food to order and how to order so that all people has enough food to eat. Not to say, the dessert, Es Teler was nice. Other than that, Tahu Telor and their special is nice."
Great Indonesian cuisine,The Indonesian cuisines offered are delicious and pretty authentic. Service is great and restaurant ambience is nice. Price is a bit on the high side although not too exuberrant for a restaurant of this class.
Best Indonesian Restaurant in Singapore!,"The food here is amazing! I had the Beef Rendang, Chicken Satay, and Chicken with Green Chilli - all of which were very tender and delicious. The meal was delicious and fresh, while also being well worth the price. There was also splendid service provided to our server, Ms. Doreen Rose so big shoutout to her! Thank you guys and I will be coming back to this restaurant when I arrive in Singapore again."
Thumb up,The food and ambience is nice. We recommend to try durian coffee and nasi tumpeng. The sambal is just nice. I guess if it a bit spicier will be perfect to go with nasi tumpeng. We have a good staff to serve us.
highly recommended,"quiet and nice ambience,warm welcomed and good recommendations from staff,they were very helpful and friendly,good food, and good service would love to comeback again 👍😊👍"
Good food & very good quality service.,"My friend brought me here yesterday. This is my first time to be here, I like the rendang, gado ~gado and the scarle tea. The staffs are friendly and helpful also their recommendations are very good. Will be coming back to the restaurant again"
Lousy service,"Food was tasty but we WON’T be back!!!

We were a group of 12 for lunch as we had an overseas visitor. Restaurant was almost empty and we pre-booked.

They charge $1.50 for 200ml small bottle water or $0.50 for tap water (which was fine).... however when we asked to top up water ... Answer was “NO REFILL OF WATER”.... what? .. it’s ok to charge but I have never heard a restaurant refusing to TOP up water!! Outrageous.

Also we asked for advise if 2 portions of each type of food or 3 portions would be enough & were told 2 portions would do. When portions came .. shocked to see the chicken thigh only cut into 2pieces so I asked if can portion smaller so everyone can sample ... ANSwer : NO. Same for beef rendang .. “Cannot cut smaller”. We then proceeded to order more portion. It’s not just the answer but the ATTITUDE when telling customer. Disappointing at the lack of service and bad attitude.

At the end .. I told them politely that food was good but I wanted to give a feedback on service to improve. She was not interested and stared at me blankly .. no apologies or effort to find out why .. just “couldn’t care less” .. my Wife asked if she was owner .. Answer : “Owner Indonesian .. not in”.

Sigh! ... I can understand if restaurant was busy but we were the main table and 2 other tables of 2 pax. Nonchalant attitude and and least 4 service staff hanging around chatting.

Will not return .. imagine the impression given to our overseas visitor on Singapore hospitality and service attitude!!! BAD SERVICE ..."
Fantastic authentic halal Indonesian Food!,"We didn't make reservation.. just walked from our hotel to Indo Chili with recommendation from the concierge at our hotel.

Simply delicious and good service!

We ordered:
Gulai kambing.. it didn't look like in the menu but the mutton was soft and the gravy was good.
Tahu telur ... just nice, super crispy outside and soft inside.
Cumi cumi ...reminded me of Bali
The grilled pomfret ... the fish was fresh n the sauce was delicious but a tad sweet
Tempe pete ... i love this .. the sambal was not spicy n tasty.

The drinks were good too .. we ordered avocado juice, orange juice and mine was ginger tea with herbs.

We shared the es teler .. split 3 ways.

It's highly recommended!"
"Wonderful Indonesian food, great service",Anyone who has ever tasted REAL Indonesian fried rice (Nasi Goreng) knows that there is no substitute. This place knows how to cook it. Lots of other great specialties like Satay and Rendang also available in a pleasant ambiance and right prices. Great experience.
The closest you'll get to authentic Indo food (without taking a boat/plane),"From the food to music and ambience, everything about Indochili takes you back to the warmth of Indonesia. Located along the peaceful stretch of Zion Road, you'll find yourself in an inviting space where yummy food will hug your palette. Try the Nasi Tumpeng for celebratory events – with gold coconutty rice and a sweet spread of side dishes, you'll leave wishing every day was your birthday. Their Jus Alpukat is just delicious and would be a perfect complement to a lighter meal choice. Don't forget to munch on their crackers. So addictive. Drop by if you ever feel like you're missing the decadence of Indonesian food."
no msg,"near the NUH trough MRT station good lah hope its nice but for us indonesian people, its good to have food near the NUH"
Nice authentic Indonesian eats,"Hungry after leaving the Mall across the street and decided to give it a try. Not disappointed.. Appears they have a few locations so I am rating the one across from World Mall.
Option of paging through a regular menu or scrolling through a tablet at each table. In either event you order through the tablet with staff assistance if needed. Being old fashioned and a bit lazy,I like the printed menu and staff take my order. In any event the food was well prepared and presented. Service was there if you catch their eye.Complimentary bottled water at each table. Staff had smiles and seemed to enjoy their work so a compliment to management..
I will definitely be back when in Singapore."
Tasty food but cold,"My family had our Chinese New Year eve dinner at IndoChilli. We eat here once every few months as the food has a unique taste and we cannot detect MSG. This time round, the food was very tasty, as always, but also cold / room temperature upon serving, as always. What ticked me off this visit was no clear notice stating that service charge would be increased from 10% to 20% during Chinese New Year, and the restaurant playing the same lively Chinese New Year music track lasting about 4 minutes, on repeat. It probably takes no less than 45 minutes in general for food to arrive and people to eat. That meant hearing the same track no less than 11 times, and it almost drove me crazy."
Non existing service,"Went in there with my Indonesian wife.
No greetings from the staff, just got a tablet put in front of us without and explanations and still not a word from the Indian waiter!!!!
So you place your order by the tablet and wait until one of the 3 waiters have time to bring you the drinks ( we were alone in the restaurant)
Food showed up, i ordered Oxtail soup, that comes over open fire. When the nonspeaking waiter lit the flame to keep the soup warm, it was clear that there was not enough flammable tissue in the burner, but that was ignored which resulted in a cold soup after 5 min. But the oxtails were very well cooked and a tasty soup.
My wife's chicken was very nice and spicy just like she prefer.
A shame the complete lack of motivation and interest from the waiting staff ruined a nice but expensive meal."
NOT WORTH IT,"food was so so only.... and poor service staff throwing plate and show attitude. 3 of us almost to finish ....my friends when to toilet and I when to pay the bill, but I have not finish yet and they collect all the plates and left mine only I feel so awkward at that moment...... Please don't touch anything on the table especially water 330ml Aqua mineral water cost $1.50 per bottle."
Excellent Food,One of the best Indonesian cuisine food I have tasted. Every dish that we picked was very good. We went early therefore the restaurant was quiet
Good food with friendly service,"The food quality is good and almost all the dishes we tried were great. Dessert servings is quite big so good to share if you are already full from your main.

Didn't give a high rating for atmosphere as there was a large table behind us that made it quite hard for us to have conversations with their noise. The acoustics of the place is not conducive if one encounters a big and rowdy group."
"Amazing service, amazing food",I enjoy the food that IndoChili serve. It's amazing good with amazing service from the waiter. I appreciate the service given.
New year dinner,Nice place with the right indo taste. Will definitely come back and recommend this place to friends.
Lapse in service,I asked for indoor seating and was given table right by the open entrance. They didn't switch on the AC and I felt like I was sitting outdoors. Shifted us to another table and moved us back again after realising that the alternate table was booked. Finally turned on the AC after we told them to. Wifi connection lapsed and made browsing on the restaurant tablet laggy.
Good experience,Nice food with super friendly and accommodating staffs. Highly recommended specially to those who wants to try some Indonesian cuisine for the first time.
Dinner w/friends,Info chili restaurant there food was super so good and delicious.Inak Sakali....bagus.friendly staff .
"Great Food, Nice Environment",Food was great and the restaurant had great vibes. Responsive and courteous waitresses who are helpful.
Chance visit and was a pleasant experience,Went with friends to try it as I passed by it several times. Ordering was done using iPad. Prices were reasonable and ambiance was nice. Only thing that could improve was that the food should be served piping hot.....
Good service and nice food,Gado-gado and yellow rice are really good! The chicken satay is also nice. A must try. The staffs were super nice. We stayed long as it was my gathering with 2 friends who i havent met for long. They didnt disturb us although they almost closed. They waited... until we realized.
Don't bother,"Warm drinks and cold food, food looked nothing like the menu. We ordered the beautiful looking chicken leg on the menu and got two tiny chicken drumsticks that was served tepid. We paid nearly $16 for a prawn dish and got a total of 9 tiny prawns. The beef Rendang that was meant to have been cooked for 4 hours tasted like it had been cooked the day before and once again was served warm to the touch but meat was cold inside. to top it off the drinks were served warm from a bottle or can and no amount of ice could have chilled them down. Never again."
Head and shoulders above Hawker Centres,"We went to this restaurant because the adjacent Zion Hawker Centre was shut (luckily for us).
From the traditional snack through to the traditional main course the food was excellent.
While more expensive than a Hawker Centre the quality and quantity of food made the meat value for money.
The number of locals eating there should be testament enough."
Expensive and Poor Service,"I went with a group of friends for lunch and among my group of 7 of us, we have 1 friend who is an Indonesian Chinese. We were quite dissappointed with the food and service rendered to us. The food was expensive and the portion is small which I can understand the small serving for most Indo restaurants, but the portion doesn't justify for the price that was charged. The restaurant waitress were not friendly at all and we had to ask for our stuffs a couple of times before it was served to us. A glass of ""tap water"" which they call it was charged at $0.50 PER CUP and its non refillable!! If you as for refill, they will jus bring you another new cup which you will be charged another $0.50!! We were shocked when we saw the bill!!"
Lunch @ IndoChilli,"A nice restaurant, no frills, with very good food and friendly service. Prices are also very reasonable. Worth a visit"
