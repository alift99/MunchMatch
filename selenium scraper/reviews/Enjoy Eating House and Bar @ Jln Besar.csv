Very nice service and yummy dishes.,"There are several menu.
Very nice service
I’m first time here and order these menus.

- Chef Joel’s mee kia 2.0: very delicious. Truffle smell. Recommended.
- Chicken satay: delicious
- Crispy fish maw salad: OK
- Another one, forget this menu!!!

I think… have to order Chef’s recommended menus be better"
Lunch Gathering,"This was my 3 visits to the restaurant if I were to include a takeaway trip too. The place is small and cosy. Food wise, we ordered 3 dishes to share. The fish Maw soup, Crispy Hor Fun & Prawn Paste wings (6 mid wings). The speed of serving was kind of slow, its not only to us, but the other 2 tables of 10 & 6 pax were worst. If the fish maw soup can be less salty, that can be great. Portion of the food was just nice for 2 pax sharing. Staffs were attentive & helpful. Visited the place using Klook promotion, Value of $60 for $54."
Delicious,"The restaurant said the chef put Thai taste into the food. As a Thai, at first I doubted what is such Thai taste, but after the food come, I can confirm that it does really taste authentic Thai. Aroi Mak! (Very Delicious!)

Price is, however, on the high side, but it should be expect under this economic climate. Overall still a very satisfied meal."
Instagramable restaurant,"1st time visit, ordered the signature cabbage, xo fish soup pork coller and ngo hiong. A little over price. The staff not observant and talking at the front counter."
great food and service,fusion local/chinese dishes that are not too fanciful yet maintain great taste. recommended to go in a group so as to be able to enjoy bigger variery
ENJOY EATING HOUSE AND BAR @JLN BESAR,"Overall food are good, the fried hofan is special. nice place to have lunch or dinner for gathering with friends and family,"
Cute little retro restaurant with excellent food (limited choices).,"Chanced upon this place by chance. It’s a small restaurant inside a retro hotel (Kam Leng hotel), with a retro ambiencec menu and cutlery (except the utensils).

Food choices are limited but superb in quality!! We loved the XO fish soup, prawn cakes (that sauce is to die for!), seafood fried rice (generous with seafood!), yam paste. Almond desser had some egg white inside which is nice, but we felt the texture wasn’t grainy enough - in other words too “diluted”.

Took many photos here haha.

Need to make a reservation as tables are few (due to space constraint), and they only allow you to sit for max 1.5 hours."
Good but expensive,"Food is good. But it is expensive. I ordered pork jowl, tee kar mee hoon, and fish soup. The soup is little not enough for 2 pax"
very happy experience at Enjoy,"we tried set menu for 2 to try different varieties and it turned up to be very good to our pleasant surprise at such nondescript place located in Jalan Besar.
the chilli crab paste with prawn is really worth a try. the chendol dessert is refreshing and nice to have to complete the meal. the lemongrass hot drink is not diluted but pretty strong taste!"
Excellent Food & service!,"We had the Chili prawns , Chicken satay & seafood fried rice.
Chili prawns were a nice twist to the famous local chili crabs.
Chicken satay was awesome with the peanut sauce.
Fried rice was fragrant with the WokHey, portion was quite small thou.
Overall an excellent experience."
Not bad!,"The taste of food is generally good, but it is quite pricey considering the portion. Chili prawn & XO fish soup is good, chicken stay is just so-so."
"Good food, even better service plus happening vibes!","Brought friends to try out the food and the vintage setting. All loved the cooking and the ambience!
And special thanks to the service crew who were ever so willing to respond to our requests including lending me an umbrella when it was pouring after our dinner!"
Amazing food,I had the set for 2. Managed to sample all the signature dishes and each was of high quality. Value for money. It's a must try!
Never been so good!,Food and service are fantastic. love the decoration of the restaurant although too small area thus can be noisy especially fully occupied
Delicious Modern Zichar,"We ordered some of their signature dishes like the Singapore Style Chilli Prawns (must order the mantou!), Chef Joel’s XO White Fish Soup, Ugly Cabbage in Fish Sauce, Chef Joel’s Mee Kia, Chendol Panna Cotta and Teochew Orh Ni (love the texture and sweetness just nice). Even though it just the 2 of us, we finished all the food! This shows how delicious they are; perhaps our 3 negative comments are that the chendol is a little too sweet and the aircon wind is too strong, hence turning the food cold pretty fast and lastly, the price is slightly on the high side, but we get quality food!"
GOOD,The food is so good!! There are many things to choose from and every single one that i ordered was amazing. Would strongly rec the ugly vegetable and the pork slices.
Best Food!,"I ordered the ugly cabbage in fish sauce, crispy hor fun, chicken satay and bbq pork cheek! It was my first time trying a new version of hor fun and it comes with seafood. Both the meat from chicken satay and pork cheek are juicy and tender, one of the best dishes that I have tasted. Lastly, the ugly cabbage has the wok hey taste, it can be a simple dish yet you will find yourself kept on eating it. Overall, I really enjoyed the food at Enjoy Eating House! :)"
Dinner for 2,"A restaurant with a very lovely homely ambience.
Food was delicious, dishes that were worth the praise were the ""Ugly Cabbage"" & ""Black pepper sauce tenderloin with foie gras"". The ""Bbq pork cheek"" was good too, just not as exceptional as the tenderloin.
I'd definitely be back someday! Keep it up guys"
Average place that can do a lot more,"Firstly the restaurant did not receive my chope reservation but luckily got a table. Ordered total of 4 dishes to share for 3 pax - oxtail, cabbage curry chicken (x3 plain rice) and chendol. Food was tasty and of standard though to note - oxtail was a tad too sweet, cabbage was good, curry chicken came as one drumstick.
Overall everything was way overpriced for the portion served as would expect a bigger portion. Chendol was a whopping $8.Total bill was $81."
Old school old taste,"The restaurant occupies a small corner in front of Kam Leng Hotel. The interior is plainly furnished but with a colorful wall feature. Four of us ordered the Te Kah Bee Hoon, Singapore Style Cillli Prawns served with man tou, Satay and stir fry cabbage. The portions are perfect. My favourites are the bee hoon and satay. The bee hoon soaked up the gravy nicely. The te kah was deboned and the plate came with just sufficient mouth watering meat (and a little fat ). The satay meat was beautifully marinated. Nicely charred but juicy inside."
Excellent foods,Will patron again. Delicious foods. Good service and interior is full of retro vibe. Best to make reservations in advance as the place is quite small
Terrible Service at Enjoy Eating House and Bar,Terrible Service at Enjoy Eating House and Bar at 383 Jalan Basar. We ordered our food once we sit in and the staff told us that there is only 90 min eating time allowed for each table since they need to have a second round of business. I told them the food have to be served fast if they want us to release the table within 90 min. Then the staff blame us for ordering so late and therefore long waiting time for food. When the noodles was ready and I ask the staff to serve it in 05 bowls and the staff insisted that they don't help to serve but they will still charging us the 10% service charges. And one of the staff never wear his mask when he was working in the restaurant. I hope no one will go there to eat in future.
Good,"Made a booking at 6pm, called in earlier to request slightly later timing like 6.30pm but was told that we are only left with 1hour to dine that create alot of anxiety esp it's my friend birthday celebration.
Food were good, luckily our last dish came late hence we enjoyed our time longer there.
Food were decent, we spent close to $250 for 4 pax including a bottle of wine and fish"
Good Food,"The food was surprisingly good, especially the satay, the brandy fish soup and the pork knuckle bee hoon. However, was quite pissed off with the male waiter whose attitude was bad and we almost wanted to walk away. The saving grace was the food."
nice,"must order chili prawn, very nice and yummy. really love it and will come back again. I enjoyed my time but location not convenient. Book a table to avoid disappointment"
"Great Food, Great Ambience and Value for Money","Great food, Great ambience, courteous staff, do try the Chilly Prawns and the Fried rice. Taste of Singapore"
Excellent food,"Food is amazing. Ambiance is good, very chill modern Asian interior. Will definitely visit again. Probably what to improve would be the service, feels abit unprepared or unprofessional."
One of the best food I've tasted in Singapore!,"Absolutely fantastic food. It's not an exaggeration when I say the food is one of the best I've tasted in Singapore. Every dish was bursting with flavour, and it's just amazing how local food can be given such a face-lift.

Must try:
1) Chef Joel's Mee Kia (served with signature BBQ pork cheek, crab meat, and truffle sous vide egg)
2) Chef Joel's BBQ pork cheek
3) Black pepper Angus beef tenderloin cubes with foie gras"
Truly enjoyable,"Tucked away discretely in a shophouse boutique hotel, this modest restaurant offers tasty local cuisine with an interesting twist, good for takeout too. Their special otah is a must-have!"
Excellent Food and value for money,An impressive restaurant with delicious mee kia and bee hoon at an affordable price. Will definitely visit again
Excellent!,order their food directly via whatsapp. Food taste is great and the portion size is good as well!! Will order again. Delivery is on time as well. WELL DONE!
ordered several times different food dishes for deliveries,"Their food delivery services are fast and food came hot , love their keropok lots :) Tried the tang hoon , pork knuckles bee hoon , chilli prawns , fish soup so far and was yummy too ✨ Would definitely try their other dishes the next rounds !! Do be more careful on the packaging of soup dishes though as ours came spilling out the first time , other than that , its very much pleasant, friendly, yummilious journeys so far !!! ✨"
Overpriced,"Most of their food are salty especially their ugly cabbage and crabmeat omelette. Their pork leg bee hoon is just normal but their pork is soft. Their mee kia is just like outside with egg and pork. Some parts of the pork cheek is so tough and so fatty.
Service is not great either. It's hard to get the service staff's attention.
There are better food else where with cheaper price."
Awesome food and timely delivery!,"Highly recommend the prawn tanghoon, the tanghoon is so flavorful and fully soaked with the prawn essence. When the food arrived, we thought we couldn't finish it but it was so yummy that we wiped out everything. Also love that all the dishes' taste is very clean, like a really high quality home cooked food! Ugly cabbage is ugly yet delightfully tasty!"
Enjoyed the yummy food delivered,"Enjoyed the yummy food delivered during safe reopening period. Some must-try dishes: pork leg bee hoon, crispy horfun and chilli prawn."
Delicious food with great service,"Highly recommend their ugly cabbage, spicy lime fresh squid and their superb mantou for dipping in the Singapore style chilli prawns.

Delivery is always on time and any hiccups with the food were always promptly addressed by their whatsapp number. Oh and get their thai milk tea too it brings me back to BKK days."
Unexpectedly Good,"Wanted to support local establishments and chanced upon Enjoy. Food taste held up despite delivery. The Chilli Prawn was finger licking good, we saved the gravy for our next meal. My kids loved the pork cheek, and although they found the Otah slightly too spicy, they still couldn't resist tucking into the lemak dish. Read many good reviews about the Ugly Cabbage, and it certainly didn't look like much. But, it was surprisingly delicious. The Supreme Fried Rice was full of seafood and flavour, no regrets with this order. My personal favourite was the Prawn Tanghoon. Simple but totally satisfying, could use a just a dash more pepper but i put pepper in everything i eat, ha. The Mango Sticky Rice was just ok though. Overall, a totally satisfying meal! Would totally visit the restaurant once we're allowed to dine out."
A Great Little Place,"This little gem tucked away in a boutique hotel with excellent food and service. When the food is not perfect it's good enough to be forgivable. Try the soup bak wan kepiting, the otah, the ugly cabbage, the pork cheek, the mee kia and the crispy hor fun. All yummy. More than one you can eat in one meal so plan to come back."
Coming back again and again and again and again.....,"Have been here several times, and have tried most of their dishes.
My favourite is still the Grandma's Te Kah Bee Hoon! they pig trotters on the beehoon is really tender and the beehoon is very flavourful!
Another must try is the Chilli prawns w mantou!!!!"
Excellent food & service,"2nd time we ate here. Tried other dishes this time in addition to the fish soup & curry chicken we liked from last visit. This time we ordered chilli prawns, steamed tofu & chendol. All the dishes were delicious. Chef service was excellent. We will return. Just note CNY menu is slightly more expensive than regular menu but the same dishes. With Chope vouchers, still very good value."
Local food,"Great food especially Grandma’s Te Kah Bee Hoon, pitan tofu. The ambience brings you back to Singapore in the 50s."
Recipe for traditional food,"The restuarant is located in Kam Leng Hotel. Drove there, there is a small carpark behind the restaurant. There are a few parking lot right in front of the restaurant. If you are lucky, you cab find a lot there before entering the restaurant.

While entering the restaurant, there is a feel of tradtional atmosphere. It has small variety of food but the food are delicious. I find it reasonable for the usual over-the-table meal that usually had at home with your family. I had 4 adult and 2 kids age below 10 for this meal.

The portion of the food is just right for my family. We order 4/5 dishes, with 4 cups of drink. Personally I like the squid dish whereas my father likes the Nonya Curry Chicken and my mother likes the bee Hoon Craypot Prawn.

The boss is friendly and interactive. He actually went to the table for feedback on the food and services they are providing despite the crowd.

I saw there are some liquor and draft beer counter. I believe it will be a good place for chilling."
Tastebuds reignited!,"There is just so much love and pride in every dish that was prepared and served.

Being a good local host, I ordered satay for an overseas friend so that he could try out how this signature food tastes like.. and of course, I had my certain fixed set of expectations, having eaten satay for the most part of my life.

Not exaggerating, I found myself being blown away by how the marinate and meat blended in so beautifully under the care of the chef.. the moisture was locked in really well and the the peanut sauce just complements the flavours homogeneously

And that is just the satay.. the red chilli prawns (a good balance of spicyness and sweetness) with man tous and also the half-baked fish (the most tender I've ever tasted) are really worth a try

If you like local food, and wouldn't mind to having your tastebuds reignited, this is definitely the place to go!"
If you are in Singapore and,"If you are in Singapore and you don’t eat at this restaurant you are crazy...great host James....fabulous food and I’m a foody, excellent value...eg. drinks amazing SGD$20 jug of gin and tonic, yes jug!!!!"
ok only,"tried to book a table but was told it was fully booked. however, there was only a couple there when we reached and no new customers throughout our hour there.

food passable, mainly for people who looks strong flavour. food was also somewhat salty.

food to try :
1. satay, horfun, cabbage (has the wokhei but they should not have added sugar)

food that is ok :
1. white fish soup, pork trotters meehoon, (abit overpowering. good for those who likes strong taste n meehoon with the salt)

food that is worth a miss:
1. curry, pork cheek, fried rice (the prawn was tasteless)"
Comfort food at its best!,"Excellent local Authentic Singapore food with a little twist. Love their Red curry fish, crispy horfun, mee kia, and cendol!"
Must-try restaurant!,"I like the place, to enjoy with friends and drink Foods are delicious, a lot of choices of Asian foods"
Great place to enjoy,Great food great service and great atmosphere as the name suggests. Perfect marriage of good food and affordable drinks.
Delicious! Great service too!,"Really a hidden gem! Love their bbq pork cheeks, fish soup and chilli prawn with fried man tou. Must try!!"
Very good food,"We tried the pork cheeks, fish soup and curry chicken. Food was delicious although the pork cheek was on the fatty side but nevertheless still good. Skip the lemongrass drink as it was bland. Good value with Chope voucher."
Awesome food in a comfortable and chill environment!,A good variety of Zi Char dishes available in the menu to choose from. My friends and I truly enjoyed our dinner experience at Enjoy Eating house. Loving the chill vibes set up of the restaurant with an old school nostalgia throwback to the past.
Sincere food,"Check out this hidden gem if you want affordable good food. Highly recommended for their pork, steamed fish, chilli prawns!"
It’s really tasty...,"Used a voucher here from Chope ($25SGD gets $50SGD credit, max 2 per visit). Hidden beside/inside a dodgy looking hotel. This place was legit and delicious. Must have “Whole Sea Bass” (Salt Baked). Limited seating but we went early so not sure what it’s like on a busy stretch. With the voucher...in $ingapore...really really good. Without out voucher, still worth a stop. Negatives were easily looked over. I’d suggest skipping the house wine. It’s listed as a bar, they do have Spirits, but there isn’t a bar.

Owners...please put on some music in the background. It’s so small in there it felt like I could be heard be everyone!!!! Thanks EEG+B."
Scrumptious Meal With Vintage Ambience,"Hidden gem in jalan besar. Ordered the Salted Baked Seabass, Chilli Prawns with Crispy Bun and Bbq Pork Cheek Noodle, it was so tasty and flavourful!

Will definitely recommend and bring more friends there again! The place is not very big so do call for reservation if you going down in big groups."
"Food was good, very flavourful","Order the 3 egg spinach, bbq pork and the fish soup.

The 3 egg spinach is really good, the taste of the salted egg is blended into the spinach. Best dish to eat with rice,.

Bbq pork is savoury, together with beer, its a perfect match. You just have to try it if you go there.

Fish soup is good, totally different from the normal fish soup u have.

Restaurant ambiance is pretty chill type, you can even watch a game of soccer together with the food.

1 bad thing is that the location is pretty hard to notice unless you really look into it. Just beside punggol nasi lemak."
Enjoy Eating,"Ordered bbq pork, singapore style chilli prawns and three-egg spinach and Enjoy Eating them. Drop by for dinner here if you're around Jalan Besar."
Dinner on Sunday,"Food was delicious with a lot of wokhei. My fav dishes were the chicken satay, dirty cabbage and black pepper beef with foie gras! Will definitely be back again. Place is quite small n packed on a sunday so its better to make reservation."
Good food for the tummy,"Bbq pork cheek, red curry sea bass and “ter kah” bee hoon are some of my usual go-to! You won’t go wrong with those! A nice cosy environment with friendly and attentive staff:)"
Great Food!,Loved the food here! Especially the fish with red curry and beehoon... They serve up a playful twist on old favourites
Superb food and cosy place for gathering with friends,"Love the food!!! BBQ pork cheeks were grilled perfectly, “te kah” bee hoon with melt in the mouth “te kah” 😋"
Food rave!,"Food is amazing. Highly recommend the 'te kah' noodles, salted egg calamari, sea bass with red curry and three egg spinach."
Great Authentic Thai food!!,Dined with my friends here a couple of times and it serves really good Thai food! Loved loved loved the BBQ pork cheek! Super tender and delicious! And with the homemade sauce that comes with it! Yummy! Try if you are around the area!
Great Food & Service,"Overall the food is really good, especially the fish soup, pork cheek, chendol, ugly Veg. Do reserve table especially on the weekend as tables are limited i would say."
A twist to local favourites,"Dined here around five times, I have tired over ten dishes and have to say they were all out of this world. Simple dishes made so differently and unique. Highly recommend the crispy hor fun and fish soup. Nice and cosy environment with lovely service too:)"
undeniably delicious! (warning long post),"finally paid enjoy eating house and bar a visit after hearing much about it and man, it did not disappoint me at all! we ordered a total of about 6-7 dishes, shared among 3 of us and we left the restaurant with happy bellies.

the must-tries which we all loved:
1) fish - crispy with chef J’s red curry sauce -> this dish was superbly tasty with hints of coconut embedded within aromatic red curry. fish was fresh and crispy and the portion was a generous serving enough for 3 grown men

2) chef J’s BBQ pork -> one of the signatures which rightfully so, can be considered a “heavenly king”. pork was sliced thick enough for that extra bite yet the meat was tender enough even if you’re wearing dentures (not experimented yet though). it comes with a delectable sauce, reminiscent of those that you have in thailand, which surprisingly pairs off exceedingly well together. not a moment of jer-lak-ness despite chomping down quite a couple of pieces.

3) chef J’s te kar bee hoon -> needless to say, this is the only carb dish you need to pair off with the others i’ve mentioned. serving might tend to be a bit smaller for this but how else can you save up that space for all the other dishes?! and don’t get me wrong, by serving i’m just referring to the portion of the bee hoon, which btw is fully flavored with the te kar’s essence (and i believe many other spices). the pork that comes with this dish is succulent and breaks the moment you sink your teeth in.

aside from these, we also ordered chef J’s ugly cabbage, har jeong gai i think? (prawn paste chicken), almond paste dessert and teochew orh ni which are just as delicious but i figured that this post is long enough for anyone who’s reading it and i applaud you for being able to last time this point and have yet to book a Grab ride down to enjoy eating house at this very moment."
Loved lunch and the decor,"We loved the retro vibes and the cosy interior.

I had the lunch set of silky egg hor fun, and it was tasty. The hor fun was deep fried and crispy, and then softened over time in the sauce, and the different and contrasting textures created an interesting dish. The prawns were also fresh and plump.

The ala carte pig trotter bee hoon was also delicious, if a little salty. Both portions were on the small side, especially for the ala carte dish. The slightly tart Thai like chilli went well with both dishes.

The iced milk tea and coffee were pretty good too, if a tad pricey.

Overall, it was an interesting and tasty meal."
An Enjoyable Singaporean Experience,"As its name suggests, this cosy little place offers everything you need for you to enjoy yourself to the fullest. Delicious, freshly cooked Asian food - special mention to the Singapore Style Chilli Prawns and the Salt-Baked Sea Bass. Amazing. vibrant flavours. A reasonably priced range of alcohol is available on the menu and live football on the telly as well. Shout out to the service crew here who always serve with sincerity and a smile despite it usually getting quite hectic during mealtimes on weekends. Best to drop by as I do usually after 9pm for a more relaxed vibe. I've been back and will continue to be back here for more rounds of enjoyment!"
Cosy Dinner Place,"The restaurant is set in an old style building but with a delightful modern twist. The place may not be big, but has a cosy feel to it and is a good place for a relaxed dinner for a small group of family and friends. It was not crowded on a Saturday evening when we visited, nevertheless, may be good to make a reservation if you have a larger group.

Go try the salt baked whole sea bass, prawn patties and fish maw soup, they taste great and portion is just nice.

Staff are generally friendly and service is good."
Local Favourites with a Twist,"Nestled within the settings of a boutique hotel along Jalan Besar is an establishment committed to preserving and promoting local culinary fare. Although Enjoy Eating House and Bar looks unassuming at first glance, do not let its unassuming exterior fool you. What it lacks in an attractive facade and expansive space is more than made up for by Chef Joel's creative take on local favourites. The restaurant itself is decorated with items and memorabilia beckoning to a bygone era and many older folks would easily identify with the retro sewing machines, radio sets and utensils which have pride of place on the shelves. Over two trips, I have had the opportunity to sample a range of items on the menu. Clear winners in my view include the pork cheek, grilled to perfection with a melt-in-your mouth quality made even more scrumptious when dipped in a special homemade sauce; the creative spin on our national dish chilli crab, but substituting the crustacean with springy prawn with the sauce making a heavenly pairing with the warm mantou; the crispy hor fun bathed in a stock so rich with generous servings of seafood and vegetables, as well as the three-egg spinach, with the various flavours blending well with leafy greens. The place also sells a mean perhaps overly sweet Thai blended ice tea, sure to satiate even the most discerning patrons with a sweet tooth. Desserts such as the yam paste and mango sticky rice were also perfect endings to a satisfying meal. A cosy place which could get somewhat claustrophobic as it fills up, Enjoy Eating House has the attributes to make a splash in the local culinary scene with honest to goodness food that evokes memories from one's childhood. Eating here is like taking a walk down memory lane."
Amazing food and ambience,"Had a really good experience going there. Staff was friendly and recommended house favourites such as the Angus beef with foie gras and brandy fish soup. While the price was slightly premium, I strongly recommend couples or groups of 3 to try. Worth the visit."
Yummy Local Delights with a Twist,"The restaurant, albeit small, is full of old school vibes. The food though is good old local zichar with a twist - Fried Kway Teow anyone? Another special mention is the Chili Prawns dish which is simply delish, and the food is priced quite reasonably. There is ample cheap parking behind Kam Leng Hotel, which makes it great for a night out with family and friends."
Back for more visits,"A fantastic place and relatively small. However, the food is really excellent with their recommended dish such as fish soup (rich in collagen), tee kar bee hoon, chilli prawn and pork cheek"
Lovely well executed dishes,"It was a real pleasure to tuck into well priced and well cooked food here. Many chefs tend to be heavy handed when flavouring their dishes which is not the case here. We can taste the chef's effort to get the taste/flavouring just right which made the dishes such a pleasure to savour. We loved all the dishes we ordered: ugly cabbage, otah, salt baked sea bass and te kah bee hoon. However as some of us have gotten used to a low salt diet, the te kah bee hoon may be a tad salty. However, that's the original taste as I recall.

Will not hesitate to dine here again or recommend friends to."
Definitely worth visiting!,Located at Kam Leng Hotel. Perfect spot for a dinner. Love the whole fish. Thanks James for the great hospitality.
Great gathering place!,Great place to meet up with friends for a meal:) do try the chili prawns dish and the ugly cabbage which are so yummy!
Cosy restaurant,A great location for family and friends gathering. The food is yummy and the place is cosy. Try out the chilli prawn and the chendol!
Awesome food,"My second time here and absolutely loving the grandma te kah bee hoon, crispy hor fun and pork jowl! Highly recommended to try! This time we tried the curry fried fish too, it’s really really good! Oh yes and the ugly cabbage looks normal but so tasty! Sweet and crunchy!"
Favourite restaurant and bar,"Me and my partner have been in Singapore for 4 days and this is by far the nicest meal that we have had. The food is delicious and the staff are so friendly and smiley, they make you feel so welcome straight away. Handy that we were staying at the hotel next to Enjoy so stopped here every night for a beer. Such a lovely atmosphere also with live football on the TV which was a bonus for my Liverpool loving partner."
Delicious comfort food with good draft beers,"If you're looking for somewhere casual to chill for meals or just drinks with light bites, this is the place for you.
Service was sincere and efficient, a bonus.

We had a pretty legit fish maw salad, followed by prawns in chilli crab sauce (bit too sour for me personally), pork belly, satay (best I've had) and orh ni for our family dinner.
We left deeply satisfied and will be back for more. (hopefully without the table of drunks behind us next time)"
"Gourmet Straits Chinese Fare, Great Value with Chope deals","A favourite place of my fiancé & I for late dinners. When we’re in town we pop by 1-3 times a week. Small kitchen, good down-to-earth folks, pretty loyal following during conventional lunch/dinner hours but gets quiet after. Several to-die-for dishes like the chilli prawns with mantou, fish soup and deceptively simple mushroom side dish among others. We’ve found that the food quality is consistently high across the menu, and just a tad more gourmet-tasting when the kitchen’s not in a crunch. Not that we’re complaining. The place gives excellent value with the 50% off Chope deal on weekdays (9pm onwards or afternoon). To our delight, the discount also applies to alcohol (!!!). Not the lushest or most romantic ambience/decor but it’s genuine and likeable. Bottoms up and Enjoy."
Old school vibes with a modern twist to it.,"Old school vibes with a modern twist to it. I enjoyed the reasonable price Zhi Char food such as Prawn Cake, Otah and Pork Trotter with Mee Hoon. Would definitely return to try out the rest of the food soon!"
Superb Recommendation,"Awesome food! Awesome old school ambience! Highly recommend the Chilli prawns w deep fried mini mantous, Salt baked whole sea bass and claypot prawn tang hoon. Definitely coming back for more."
Highly Recommended,The food was delicious. Especially the horfun! First time eat crispy horfun! Nice experience. Will come back again!
Excellent food n dessert !,Food was really delicious especially the pork leg beehoon which had good wok hei n sambal chilli prawns. Mum loved the yam dessert . Guy servers were friendly n attentive . Lady server was not very friendly n we had trouble getting her attention to assist. We spent about sgd$120 for 6 dishes n 2 desserts.
A Taste of Home,"Excellent dishes that reminds one of home. Enjoyed all the signature dishes, especially the chilli prawns and salt baked fish. Will be bringing family and friends for more meals in the future."
Hidden Gem. Never thought tze char can be this good,"Great place to dine and chill out! Been there 3 times. Fabulous food, highly recommended! Must try: Fries hor fun Pork Cheek Te Kah Bee Hoon"
Good fusion zhichar,"Good fusion zhichar, ordered the fried rice, hor fun, pork and omelette which was tasty! Paid about 20 per pax and booked using Chope."
Hidden gem in Jalan Besar,Chili prawns was amazing. Grilled pork is great as well. Very pleasantly surprised by the freshness and quality of dishes at this restaurant.
Nice pig trotters beehoon here,"Had their signature braised pig trotters beehoon - really tasty but way too salty for my liking.

Heard the seafood horfun is the other signature so may be back to try.

Service is just acceptable, not the attentive kind. Overheard one staff defending their cooking when customer complained about the saltiness!"
Great local restobar,"Homely and hearty food. I'd recommend the pork leg bee hoon and salt baked fish. Fresh, tender and juicy! They open late with live football as well."
Cozy little local restobar,Really honest and good food at reasonable prices. Cozy and comfortable setting and friendly staff too!
Good Chinese Food / Beers At Reasonable Prices,"According to the staff this restaurant started business 3 years ago. It is located within the Kam Leng Hotel. There is a variety of local as well as Chinese food in the menu.The food is tasty and fresh. Some recommended dishes include braised pork knuckles,silky egg hor fun ,Cantonese sweet sour pork and sliced fish noodle soup. As there is “ happy hours” all day long,this is a good place to drink your favorite beers and wines.Service by staff is friendly. A nice place to have delicious Chinese food and chilled beers at reasonable prices."
Not the easiest to find but well worth it!,"There were no noticeable signs or banners pointing this place out so I had to seek a local’s help. But was it worth it! Food was reasonably priced and the owner was extremely friendly. Being based in the UAE, my wife and I are sick to death of over-effective AC. We explained this to the owner and he very kindly adjusted the temperature for us! An awesome experience overall. I’ll be back."
Enjoy @Enjoy Eating House and Bar,"We had a very satisfying lunch at the cosy and petite Enjoy Eating House and Bar, thanks to Seth Lui’s recommendation. Reasonably priced, the dishes were delicious and reminded one of home-cooked delicacies. Be I t chilly prawns with man tou or fish maw soup, BBQ pork or pork trotter beehoon, all the food items were simply awesome, not to mention the yam paste which was so not too sweet or greasy. We were also impressed with the personalized and meticulous service, despite the fact that there was only one server during our visit. Will return for more soon..."
Wonderful Singaporean Cuisine,Highly recommended for the chilli prawns and fish soup. Slightly inaccessible but worth the walk down from the MRT.

Cozy atmosphere with tasty food,"Tried the lunch set for Curry Chicken, tender chicken with nice curry taste! Thai milk tea is nice tooo! Recommended for all"
Lovely homely food,Delicious and flavourful dishes. I love their hor fun and pork bee hoon and the salt baked fish is good too. It is a comfortable place and very homely too in a quiet environment but the food is worth it. Highly recommended.
Authentic local restaurant with quality food!,Great and comfortable place to enjoy your meals. Casual setting comfortable for family and friends. Food is good and high quality. Go for the hor fun and te ka beehoon - never fails! Slightly pricey but you do get quality and comfortable setting. Try the milk tea and coconut shake!
