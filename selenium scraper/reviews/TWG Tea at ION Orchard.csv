Had TWG for years,"The initial teas was good like Arabian nights, etc. However as prices goes up and up and UP... extravagantly.... it's really not worth
HECK these are only TEAS!!!
I got the TWG Royal, Darjeling, etc and my verdict? It's smooth, light but at the end of it, it's JUST TEA! Even the standard Darjeling from Dilmah, etc are more fragrant.
Overrated overpriced TWG... I've stopped buying it. Trying to BRAND something that's not and shouldn't be branded. Greedy TWG"
Average,"Firstly, at such an established tea brand and tea house, the queuing system was ridiculous. I agree that it is ok to have first come first served basis, but to have to stand in queue and not be able to leave mobile no. that already set the tone for this visit. Made us more than a little crank. We took turns in queue and looked around. Our table was teeny tiny and they squeeze 3 of us on a little table, which is fine, but I would just stretch my hand out and touch the neighbour's table, actually, I could hear their conversation, they were on a first date! The scones were a little small and dry. But I guess I came here for their tea. It was really good. The best part of this was the cake, their saving grace that gave them an average rating instead of poor. I recommend the cake option for the afternoon tea - the matcha one with the gold leaf, really delicious - could not fault this. Anyway, come early 13:30 -13:45 and sit until the afternoon tea starts 14:00 to avoid the queue."
Service Needs To Begin With The Queue,"Sat, 25 June 2022

I am writing this as I am still queuing outside TWG ION. It is

TWG needs to re look their standard and Service SOP should begin with the queue.

I went in to make 2 suggestions to a male staff-
1. Institute a system where our mobile numbers provided so staff can ping customers when th table is ready
2. Provide chairs outside for customers who choose to wait in the queue.

This ensures all customers are taken care of specially in a way that no other tea establishment has thought of.

My daughter felt unwell after still waiting in line and had to go sit down.

Meanwhile, I am still queuing as I finish texting.. Badly done TWG!"
What would you drink at a famed tea store?,"I would like to recommend the mushroom soup. It was as good as I have had anywhere, although the serving size was small. BTW, they do have some good tea. After our soup, my wife and I both had tea."
Tea and more,"A chain of high end tea cafes originating from here in singapore and expanded all over asia. They have the usual scones, cakes and macarons as well. Some teas go for as much as $250 per pot. 😬"
Disappointing Service,"Have been a regular at TWG but was startled by the pushy service staff. They seemed unwilling to provide additional plates to share items, or even additional spoons (pointing out that the table already had one - of course i knew that I wanted a serving spoon). Also insisted on the one pot per person rule (even though we ordered other desserts and food items).

Really dulled my experience."
Pleasant dine in at TWG,"Ion orchard TWG tea . Staff, Charles recommended tea pairing with food goes well with it. V patience introducing the different type of tea and food when I ask for suggestions. Did go thru the menu with u and ask about me and my friend’s appetite. The tea he intro is awesome. The taste bud and even go for extra mile to let you experience the tea taste. Nice !"
Great afternoon tea experience!,"Love the Parisian afternoon tea. We were to opt for choice of scones, cakes or muffin. Glad we chose scones and cake as the scones are delicious! It has one of the best scones. It is tasty and has a soft texture inside. Love the tea jelly to match it with, which i think is only unique to TWG. There is a wide selection of cakes to choose from as well. Service is great. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Their afternoon tea is available until 6pm so it is a good option as most other afternoon tea ends before 5pm."
Sarah,"Terrible service provided at ION’s TWG. Staff talked down to customers. 0 product knowledge as well. Food was great but service and attitude of one particular staff (girl with very thick eyeliner, did not manage to catch name as no name tag). I expected more from TWG as I have visited other outlets and experience has been great. TRULY DISAPPOINTING ION’S TWG. Also, i visited on 2nd Jan around 11am. I hope TWG sees this and does something about it."
Pretentious place for afternoon tea,"Pretentious place for afternoon tea... the food was ok. Enjoyed the selection of teas they had; they are great for teas from South Asia but their teas from China are average. Service was also mixed, some are good, know their products but some were just so so."
Great service offline but horrible at online,"I love a service of ION orchard, and consider to dispatch a gift by online. they made a mistake and acknowledgement... However TWG showed bad manner with irresponsibility. It's sucks"
Great customer service with a nice ambience,"I was here with my sister for dinner. We usually would dine in Takashimaya outlet instead as the customer service is better over there as we are the frequent customer of TWG. However due to phase 2 CB,Takashimaya was closed on the day earlier than expected, so we headed to the ion outlet. To our surprise,this time round there was a gentleman named ‘Harold’ served us with great customer service in the ION outlet. This good customer service made our dining experience so much better. I would dine in ION outlet again since the service improves with Harold around. TWG, do take note that customer service is very important for a upscale brand like yours!"
Hi tea,"I would say their tea choice is a lot. We order bourbon tea and collector tea. This is my 2nd time having their tea. I would say their tea is good.

As for the hi tea it kind of mixture. The cake is a bit too sweet, the scone is a bit lack lustre the internal is a bit hard
. However I would recommend their sandwich such as the crab salmon etc"
Tea time with friends.,"If you are the tea lover, this place the best place you should go. With the tea come from all around world. The taste also good. I choose the mint tea. Quite expensive but really worth."
Great tea variety,"I stopped by at TWG to purchase some tea, and the experience was quite good. Ask for suggestions as the staff is very attentive and eager to share the knowledge they have in regards to the tea. I believe the gift box starts at S$25."
Just terrific for tea.,"I discovered TWG's Chamomile tea in Singapore and it began a love-affair that I think will last a very long time. Sure, I've had Chamomile tea before, but not TWG's tea which is in a whole different league of teas.

I was so enchanted with this tea that I purchased a beautiful teapot with dome (of course to keep my precious tea warm) at the store - it is stunning if I say so myself."
Gathering for friends,"I guess they don't take reservations as there was long queue when I arrived at 1pm. And there was long queue at about 3-4pm when I was leaving.

Food is expensive and exquisite. Like fine dining. But they taste very nice. Not sure if it is because I'm very hungry.

Very wide range of TWG tea and please do let the staff know what is your preference so they can suggest some tea for you. My two friends and myself loved the selection which the staff suggested for us. For example one of my friend wanted floral with a bit of mint. While I'm breastfeeding so I was directed to some South African teas which were non caffeine. I chose a creme brulee with a tinge of sweet aftertaste. Yum! Each of us ordered a pot of tea.

Total 3 pots of tea, 5 mini sandwiches and a spaghetti to share. Total a little over 100 SGD. I find it a tat expensive."
Macarons,"Service at the counter was horrible when I was buying macarons from this staff named Lena Or Lina.

She couldnt hear my order and looked annoyed while exclaiming ‘HUH?!’ as if it was my fault that the shop was overcrowded and packed with noisy customers.

Never going back to that outlet anymore. If you can’t handle the flow of customers, please have more staff at the counter. There were 3 other staffs who were there but unpacking stocks or whatever instead of serving customers."
Beautiful and enjoyable,"We love coming here. It’s s must. We did it without our teenagers whom went shopping. So we had some us time really enjoying beautiful surroundings,, beautiful tea and stunning atmosphere and food. And the dessert and macaroon s just in heaven. Thank you so enjoyable."
Neat and snazzy,"Not sure if the photos taken will do this outlet justice, after some shopping me and my sister were feeling alittle bouché and decided to try TWG for the first time.

I must say that the staff were really polite and friendly despite me and my sister trying out high tea for the first time. They were really patient at entertaining us with our questions about the menu and the jellies. Full marks for the staff experience.

However, I must say, maybe it was just that day but the airconditioning wasn't really working and the place felt rather stuffy. The experience was still really good for me though.

Worth the price? Thats for you to decide. $20 for tea and biscuits. For me, i felt like it was worth it for the experience. ^^"
"founded in 2008, low quality product.","The company was founded in 2008, not in 1837 as they put on their logo. Use this info to decide how honest and trustworthy this company and their product is. cannot recommend"
A real gem,"Wonderful experience. Superb service. If you are a tea person and you are in Singapore, this is a spot for you."
Delicious high tea,"They really made me remember the pleasure of having good artisanal tea. The large cups, the golden teapot, i really sank back in the ritual and i loved it"
The only mug here.... Is me. For returning.,The same old singapore nonsense of not being able to share. Or not serving tap water. Coming on you own you can have tea and scones. But if two of you come... You have to order twice as much. The definition of good service here remains very narrow.
Tea time,"A nice cafe located in orchard ion, one of many TWG in the asia region. As the name implies, they only have tea, but what a variety. From $10 to $250 a pot. I wonder who gets the latter. They have cakes and regular western food too"
nice place,"if you're looking for something classy in Singapore, this is the place to be! it has the best macarons in town!"
dinner,"i love their lasagna, scones and tea here. this place is good to chill out after shopping. plush seats, good quality food and service."
First-class place for high tea ☺️,"We had the great pleasure to pass by this first-class place in the ION Orchard building! The high tea is served high class as it should by classy staff, even in the annexed shop you are stylishly served. We bought some awesome macarons and Singapore breakfast tea as a souvenir."
"Tea boutique, variety to try and buy from !!!",The TWG tea outlet at ION Orchard is a nice place to take a break after shopping by having some nice tea and tit bits to munch. They have some good variety of teas to taste and also buy. Seating is limited but cosy. Only downside is that its a bit too expensive.
"Overrated, overpriced","Food: average, ridiculously overpriced. Scones were cold; macaron was way too sweet and not tasty for its standards.

Tea: Good flavour, great variety at S$11 per pot per person and is not refillable. This is a shame for charging this much.

Ambience: For anyone who wants to be part of a high society for a few hours. Can be noisy and non conducive for chatting."
Shop stop,"We only went in for a cup of tea break whilst doing a tad of shopping. However the husband and I decided to share the club sandwich with our tea. He opted for lucky tea, whilst I chose the red jasmine tea, we also managed to share three tea infused macaroons. Absolutely delicious, all of it. The display, and array of tea to choose from is unbelievable. Service was great too. A fantastic break from our shopping."
Wonderful evening,"Myself and my friend were looking for a place for tea after walking around ion orchard and we chance upon TWG. Its our first time here and the moment we entered the place, it was filled with wonderful aroma. We were spoilt for choice and in the end decide to order the afternoon tea set that comes with Tea and a choie of cake /muffin/scones. We also order chocolate tart. The scones are warm and served with cream and jam. We had a wonderful time there. It reminded us of Europe."
Nice breakfast,I came here for breakfast and spent around $15. Food and service was good. It's a nice private place.
Good breakfast place!,"Known for their huge selection of teas - each pot cost around $11-13 serves 3-4 cups. For a hearty breakfast of 2 eggs, sausages, smoked salmon and sautéed mushrooms for only S$19 per person."
Lovely afternoon,"We came with the intention of dining at Marmalade Pantry (which used to be just one level up), but found that it’s now closed so we came down to TWG instead. It was almost 3, so we had to queue a bit but we got a table within 15 mins so it was good.

We ordered a Parisien tea set, which serves two pots of tea and enough food for two. We had the option of the croque salmon or truffle - we chose the former and it didn’t disappoint! We loved the scones too - they are served hot, and combined with the tea jelly, it was heaven!! Tea wise we chose Sweet French (under the staff’s recommendation) and Strawberry tea - both were great. And we ended with my favourite thing at TWG - the Bain de roses tea flavoured macaron for a sweet ending!"
Elegant high tea like the queen,"tea is expensive but you get what you pay for.. so, it was worth a try! Especially after a stressful kind of day"
Again just so decadent and beautiful,"We looked so forward to partaking in one of our must dos in Singapore. And again it lived up to its expectations from us. The sandwiches the Manhattan and the crab and lobster club were just exceptional. The tea was stunning as always. I had a mock tail tea fusion it was so sublime. And we finished with two delectable macaroons. Just perfection , thank you."
Good variety of all over world Teas,"TWG Tea lounge in Singapore have good variety of teas from all over the world . We drank earl grey tea , very good hot tea served nicely in tea pot . Staff very courteous and helpful."
Brightens up my day! Excellent Service!,"I went with my best friend yesterday afternoon. I was having a bad day, had a bad experience to one of the shop in Ion. We came in and assisted by this young gentlemen in suites. You guys have a top notch customer service and amazing menu. He recommended my friend a White Tea which was phenomenal and I had this Cocktail that really brightens my day. We were assisted from the time we came in to the time we left and even assist us to take photos and photos with him. If I could give 100 Stars for attention to detail, phenomenal service."
"Disappointing service, constantly had to remind the waiters of what we have ordered and what hadn’t been served yet","We would not make a second visit. In short, the food is okay but the service was disappointing. The waiters keep forgetting us and what we have ordered, so it took us 3 hours to finish a single brunch. Space was also scarce. Constantly bumped on by waiters and waitresses.
We made a visit on Sunday noon for brunch based on a friend’s recommendation.
The brunch itself was quite nice. We had two sets, both were quite good, served with good tea. However, after beverage and the first course was served, we waited for more than 20 minutes for the next course - scone and French brioche. It was until the next table, who came later than us and left while we were still waiting for the pastry that we thought of reminding the waiter, who turned out to have forgotten that we still had unserved dishes and also what we have ordered. By the time pastry and desert were served, we had both drank up our pot tea. So we had to order a third pot of tea, which was again forgotten by the waiters until we reminded them after waiting for a long time.
We were very disappointed, as we have looked forward to TWG’s brunch a lot and believed the price also entails some level of basic service.
It took us three hours in total to finish the brunch, with a lot of time spent on waiting and wondering about where our dishes and tea were.
In addition to that, the small space was also quite uncomfortable. The waiters and waitresses regularly bumped into chairs and guests. I’ve also almost been hit by the plates they were helping a couple of times.
But to be fair, the food was quite good and the waiters and waitresses were all nice. The whipped cream and tea jelly served with the scone was especially memorable. However, we would not make a second visit. For the same price, there are many other better choices that come with the same standard of food and more comfortable service."
Disappointed in TWG drop in Service,"Had lunch today and opted for the set lunch.

I am hugely disappointed with the service when I was served dessert > 15 minutes late.

I had to enquirer about my tea and dessert twice before they remembered to brew the tea and bring me my set lunch dessert.

If you are visiting Singapore don’t come here as the service has deteriorated and not worth the table charge for the food served which is OK but what brings me here in the past is the service !

What a disappointment for what was otherwise a delightful afternoon!"
Lunch Break @ TWG,"Hugely disappointed today with the service from the TWG crew on 31stAug.

I waited more than 15 minutes post lunch for my tea order and dessert as part of set lunch to be served.

Finally, I asked if they had forgotten about my tea and dessert as part of the set lunch and the server said he will check but he NEVER came back to account for what happened even as I typed this out!!!

Bad service and I was initially put in a corner whose table is dusty and I requested to shift .

There are better tea houses - if you are on HOLIDAY in SG. Give this a miss until they shape up.

Not worth it for the prices
Charged !!!!"
Nothing impressive,"Went with my friend to have lunch there and the service was not to our expectation. After we sit down for less than 2 min, the waiter came to take order, my friend and I couldn't even finish greeting each other and open menu. We ordered one steak medium and one beef burger medium rare, but they served steak medium rare and burger medium. We chose 2 kinds of tea and the waiter served my order to my friend and my friend's order to me... Overall just very very disappointing."
Poor service,I waited for 20 minutes while there are 2 tables vacant but the staff didn't bother to clean up the table. There is no smile from the server at all while taking our order. Is that their normal service??
Never fails,"We spent so much money at TWG during our trip - we found this branch to be better than the one up the road. The manager is excellent, incredible service. They take such pride in the finer details. Great place to eat and relax."
Elegant high tea in classy surroundings,"My sister and I had high tea at TWG tea Ion in Singapore, after a rather stressful week. As it turned out, this cafe proved to be good for the soul! Service was professional, swift and friendly. The high tea was perfect - not too many sweet cakes but a perfect balance of sweet and savoury. The tea selection was more than adequate and there were hot water refills offered for our tea. Overall, a memorable afternoon, with high tea for two at a very reasonable price compared to many advertised as among the top ten places in Singapore."
Nice lunch and tea,Very nice lunch and tea. Not a very big fan of tea at the first time but with this selection if TWG tea it will blow your mind.
Extensive tea menu served in a posh setting in the heart of Orchard Road,"This restaurant has a great ambiance, very reminiscent of a Parisian Cafe. This is the first time I had a proper meal at the cafe and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, as I had always associated the place with tea and not hot meals per se. The Club Sandwich I had was tasty as were the fries that came with it. Portions were just right, though it may not those with a heartier appetite. There is an extensive tea menu, and the wait staff are able to give you advice as to each type of tea. Due to the whole place being encased in glass, it got very stuffy despite the air-conditioning. That was the one draw back of the place."
"Awesome staff, awesome food","Brought my family for lunch at twg ion. We each had the set which comes with a main course, a pot of tea and dessert. Very value for money at only $35. The food is very delicious with tea infused in it. How unique! Compliments to the chefs!!!!

Not only the food is great, but all the staff we came in contact with as well!

We had outstanding service from Daniel who made sure we are comfortable throughout our time there.

My family's first time in twg, it will definitely not be the last!"
Best Macaroons I ever had,"I had to get a $20 receipt to enter the ION Sky and I had earlier passed TWG but resisted. Now, having had to spend $20, I got back and had myself pick 6 macaroons. The place was classy but the prices were not over the top. Each Macaroon was only $2 and they came in a nice box. I was recommended a couple of flavours by the efficient member of staff.

After a couple of hours, I sat on the steps in front of the river and opened my pack to have one, I had six of them. Such distinct flavour, such workmanship put into each macaroon which was just bursting in my mouth. Next time I go, I will dinein in TWG tea and try some of their other stuff. highly recommended."
Afternoon Tea Twice,"I highly recommend their White House tea and millefeuille, delicious! Yummy! Have tea in the style of the Queen of England. Book table in advance to beat the long queues. Plan to arrive before 6pm to avoid disappointment. After 6pm, they start the dinner menu with the wonderful millefeuille, scones and tea jelly run out!"
Tea for Two,"My wife and I enjoyed a beautiful morning tea here whilst strolling around Ion Orchard shopping centre. The staff were very attentive, the food excellent, plus there were so many teas to choose from. We enjoyed Singapore Breakfast Tea. Prices were reasonable. A good place to visit."
Infusing awesome tea w food,"This is one kindofa restaurant that blends and infuses awesome tea leaves and tea flavour into cuisine that leave you craving for more, that’s if your tummy can hold. Great ambience that even little kids will enjoy immensely"
Great!,Went here to eat here in the afternoon around first week of March after a long day out and the all the food was great! The service was also very good and waiters were attentive. Special mention to Vezel and Jobert for the friendly service and good tea :)
"Tea, tea & more tea","Great place to share afternoon tea or a snack with friends or on your own. The staff are very helpful and explain the various teas you may want to try but, everything is done so well and in a pleasant and non-rushed environment."
Service,"Went to TWG for lunch. Zeus is such a nice and polite waiter. I am very please with his service and recommendation for the main course.
If anyone go to TWG should look for Zeus as your server."
Great Customer Service,"Was at TWG last December to do my Christmas shopping. One of the staff—her name is Siana—was incredibly kind and helpful. She provided me with many useful recommendations with a constant smile on her face. Thanks to her, I was able to finish my Christmas shopping. Kudos also to the two male managers who were very kind as well. You guys are doing a great job! Hope that the management can recognize the efforts of staff like Siana because sometimes it's the little things that matter the most (:"
"great tea, awesome service","thanks to Jobert for the excellent service. he is courteous, attentive and fast. We enjoyed our macarons and of course the tea."
Customer Service,"I have been TWG Tea at ION Orchard today. Twg tea was my first visit and I did not know what to buy. An employee greeted me with a smile and kindly explained the taste of tea in detail. Originally I went to there for window shopping. However, with the kind hospitality of the staff, I bought a lot of different kinds of things such as tea sets and candle unexpectedly. The tea is of course will be very good, but I am very grateful to the staff who introduced me a good tea. I want to strongly praise the staff. Her name is Wonjung Kwon. Thank you!"
Delicious food,I always enjoy going to twg. Their food is tasty no matter which item you order from the menu. The tea is yummy and service is friendly
TWG Tea,The best lunch I've ever had. My only disappointment is the tables arrangement were very close to each other..
Lovely place but needs to be more customer friendly,"This is feedback for my first experience at TWG cafe at Ion orchard mall. I had a lovely time having jasmine oolong tea and Singapore breakfast. Our server Jhudie served as well. But one turn off was that
It's a must for every person on the table to order a beverage. This kind of push for sale is not appreciated"
Amazing Tea Treat,"We were treated to an absolutely fabulous afternoon tea at TWG, the most gorgeous sandwiches, tea and cakes, served by diligent delightful staff.
I can't recommend it enough, the tea was fragrant and delicious, equal to any I have ever had anywhere.
Popular and therefore busy, TWG are a class act and a visit here simply has to be done."
The High Life,"We’ve visited TWG on a couple of occasions now and really do love the place. It’s sophisticated and a great place to people watch. The list of TWG teas is just mind bogglingly amazing, and watching your choice being retrieved from the wall cabinets and lovingly served is part of the experience.

On this occasion I had the substantial Club Sandwich and the almond tea. My wife had the tasty Monsieur Truffle and the crème brulee tea. It was great to relax and savour the experience. The tea flavours are out of this world. We’ll be back."
high tea,"they sold many kind of tea from all over the world.... quite pricey but you can get good quality of tea, their maccarone is very nice."
Yummy sandwich,"Needless to say, the service at TWG is always good. Waiters and waitresses are at their best. The lobster sandwich was absolutely delicious. The Chic afternoon tea was delightful and their French Earl Grey was top-notch."
Excellent brunch,"A good selection with the menu. Good food, quiet part of the shopping centre to enjoy your cup of tea. We went back for breakfast the next morning because we enjoy the food and venue very much. Thanks TWG."
Good service by TWG,"Shopping around and looking for some tea to buy back, Charles from Ion orchard TWG is patient in explaining the types of tea and provided good service. Great job !"
Good service,"Charles , good service show me with good attitude. With japanese speaking . Oishii おいしい 親切丁寧 チョコレートもあります。 です"
Sumptuous afternoon tea,"An afternoon tea to remember for all the right reasons. Fine teas, cakes, scones with jam and cream, with linen table cloths and silver service. Memorable!"
Pricey high tea with average fare,"Ordered the Parisian high tea set for 2 ($68 +++) which comes with 2 small scones, 1 turkey ham sandwich (cut into quarters), 4 finger sandwiches (no bigger than 3cm each) and a slice of berry fruit tart and 2 pots of tea (we chose sencha green tea and orange blossom oolong). The menu is full of words which you kind of give up reading after 1/2 a page. The tea menu is like a mini encyclopedia and it would probably take me at least 3 hours to go through it if I want to be picky about my tea selection. Good information on tea but do you want your customers to be seated there for so long to place an order? Anyway, was rather disappointed with the food (everything was just average except for the turkey ham sandwiches which both my friend and I like). The tea was nice but do you know that the pot of tea is just tea, without any tea leaves in the pot??? This is the 1st time I have been served a pot of tea in a cafe/restaurant that serves tea in a pot without a teabag or tea leaves!!! I actually felt cheated *sigh*. Our tea turned cold very quickly as we were seated directly under an aircon vent. The young lady staff who served us was very polite. Our bill came up to $80 for two. I think I can get a better high tea/meal elsewhere and will probably not be back again."
"Stunning, elegant, once in a life time","The decor is magical, they truly have the finest teas in the world. The scones are delicious as are the macaroons. It's expensive but it's a once in a life time opportunity to step back in time, to the days when we all sat down for teas and scone. Ahhhhh bliss so magical!"
Aromatic Tea,"If you are a heavy eater, this is not the place for you. I tried their mini burgers and ordered some of their cakes. They offer limited dishes in their menu. They don't serve coffee so don't ask for coffee when you visit this place. I am not a tea person actually but I appreciate tea now. I love the aroma of their tea collection. Now, I have an idea what gift should I buy for the elders on Christmas. TWG. The service is excellent and the staff are friendly."
great for lunch,"we had lunch and it was really good, the place is very well designed and if you have the time to visited try it"
Everything About Tea,Amazing place located at the second floor having big variety of tea or flavoured tea with chocolate even ice tea with mango and many varieties If you have time you can enjoy drinking any kind of tea
"Food above average, tea is good but below expectation","I went there several times with my friends, a nice place to sit down and chat with friends, and the staff are also kind, the dish is petty delicious and price is reasonable, tea tastes not bad but below my expectation. The macaroon is also worth a shot by the way."
Delicious burgers and cake,"We had the tea, burger and cake menu. Small and tasteful burgers with very tender meat. If you're very hungry it's not this menu you should pick.. the burgers are more like an appetizer. I had a Japanese green tea and it was great. Remember they put 17% on top of the listed price, that's probably normal but I didn't see it before I got the bill."
Great Tea provided,"Their branding was really good! Quality matches their fame! I got 3 types of tea, and it has been a month, I finished them and would like to go back to purchase more varieties!"
We were not good enough for them,"After visiting TWG shops in Dubai and Thailand, we wanted to take a sample of their huge tea variety from TWG homeland.

Our enthusiasm was killed by an arrogant French salesman who seemed be anything but happy to do business with us. Our plan to try different tea types and scents before choosing two or three varieties to take back home seemed too much of a nuisance for this gentlemen, who seemed to be out of patience and behaved as if he was too much for us.

Unfortunately, our experience was totally different from other TWG shops, where we were received by smiley people willing to spend some time and make business with us."
Excellent but pricey tea,"My friend suggested tea here after some frantic shopping. The tea and scones were very good, reminiscent of London. Good but pricey by Singapore standards. Moreover TGW is in a busy mall."
I guess we could get them elsewhere too,"I bought some of their products like cookies ....

for the matcha version, I find it too tough, I need to melt it with hot tea for better consumption....I seriously don't think the fragrance of green tea is strong enough as well

Definitely not worth another round of effort"
unpleasant experience,"I have had a very unpleasant experience here. While purchasing the goods and making tax free documents, I asked the staff ""Do I get a refund at the airport?"" The staff then nodded once, without looking at me and without answering. The attitude that she responded to the guest was very unfriendly. I felt bad about her rudeness, but Ishe was pregnant when I saw her belly. So I just came out. She was the only unfriendly person I met while traveling to Singapore."
TWG,"We almost every month be there for Lunch with my Husband or my best friend's- Pan Hong. We always enjoyed it. Among all the staff was very friendly and nice, they knew us cause we are regular guest there.

Most of the food we been tried and we love ❤️ the TWG Tea there, so every time will order -3~4 pot of the Tea ☕️. And arrange spend about $150 for 2pax. Quite expensive..

But right now they change to New Menu we seldom be there, because our favourite Salad and Dessert not serving anymore...

Hope that can get back the some dishes from the old menu.

Thank you

From : J&M"
Desserts better than tea,"After dinner in Ion I decided to have desserts at TWG. By the way TWG is a fairly recent Singapore-based company:).

The Lap Chang was smokey and nice. It is good to know a tea pot can be shared between two as otherwise I would overdose on tea.

The desserts were great. The selection at Ion was smaller than MBS. The dark chocolate tart came with delicious chocolate ice cream, and was sensational for chocolate lovers. All five macaroons were nice although they were as good as the best Parisian."
Tea Flavoured Desserts,Good to try the variety of teas and tea flavored desserts. The main courses are average . Tried the Duck which was good that day. Located in the middle of the mall so not a great setting
"In Bangkok and Jakarta I thought it ok, in Singapore it is superior","Having been to TWG in a number of countries where I thought it quaint and ok and limited ourselves to buying exotic teas, I did not expect more in its home town of Singapore. I was wrong. After a heavy late afternoon shopping we dropped in for a snack. I had a mushroom quiche and my wife a croque Monsieur both with a good salad together with Japanese green tea. It was really good and served immaculately in the old style. Congratulations to the chefs and the waiters - it was a small but real treat. Of course, we took home some French earl grey and some macaroons for later."
Afternoon Tea,"A small and compact (enclosed) tea room in the centre of ION shopping Mall. This place probably carries a lot of history, tradition and expectation. The tea room is well stocked with an incredibly impressive list of teas from all over the world - and note the minimum order is for 1 pot. They have cakes and an a la carte menu as well. This place is expensive but pretty good with a good service and great macaroons. I paid $23 for a pot of Darjeeling and $2 each on the macaroons. I was happy; the only thing letting it down was it is cramped for space."
"Decent, but also a little disapointing","My wife and I came here for afternoon tea and while we did enjoy ourselves, nothing was quite as good as we expected. The scones were dry and tough (over worked and over baked) and the Ceylon OP tea was too light."
Sophisticated,"It was my first experience and I love everything about it. Yes it costly for a tea but it worth every single penny. I went there for tea time and ordered Finger Sandwiches which I enjoyed every bites of it, soooo delish. The service is great, friendly and well groomed staff."
Horrible attitude; bad reflection of TWG,"I've always been an avid fan of the tea sets and ambience of TWG at MBS, so it is understandable why I would be so disappointed at the attitude displayed at its Ion branch.

This waiter arrogantly told my friend and I that the signature TWG scones were sold out and that ""you are too late laaahhhh~~(singlish), next time try to come earlier"". Towards the end he was scorning at us. He told us to come back another time if we want the scones, when we are already seated and did nothing to give further recommendations.

I highly recommend going to MBS's branch, because it is so much more spacious. The incident was not made any better when we were made to dine in such a tight space; my friend almost hit the teapot at the other table while trying to get up from her seat."
Bullied into Ordering Drinks,"It is with a heavy heart that I write this.

I have been a supporter of TWG Tea for a number of years as it's a Singapore company. In fact, since its founding by Manoj Murjani and his partners about 10 years ago or so. I didn't mind that all the Frenchiness was surreal and that the company was not established in 1837 at all. It was all a bit of ""pretend"" and make belief we are in Paris. But it was fun.

I have been to the cafes in Takashimaya, Ion and MBS Bridge several times. I have found the experience pleasant. Nice Macarons and cakes. Good tea and drinks. Even interesting wagyu burgers and truffle fries. We sometimes just have tea and we sometimes just have food. And sometimes we have both. All was well until last month.

On 27 June, a friend and I were at the Ion branch. We had ordered sandwiches and a wagyu burger.

We were then told by the wait staff that we would also have to order a drink each. However, as a special favor to us, he would allow us to order just one drink and not two. He said ordering drinks was a company policy and pointed to a clause in the menu. The clause says that we cannot share a pot of tea. It didn't say we had to order drinks. However, as I didn't want to spoil my meal with my friend, I complied without arguing too much and we ordered an orange juice. I believe the staff member was French.

I am sad that TWG allows staff to do this. As customers, we feel forced, as no such policy is stated at the entrance.

And I have in fact happily ordered drinks when not forced to do so. I have since that day avoided TWG cafes and will not be returning. Thankfully, there are many other places to eat and drink in Singapore."
Best macarons,"I tried their macarons and fell in love. Best macarons in the world. In fact, I was upset that I didn't buy the box and found a store at the airport. I tried lemon, rose, raspberry, mint and coconut, passion fruit etc. Yummy. I want to fly to Singapore again just to eat the macarons."
Afternoon Tea,"Was doing Christmas shopping at ION. There's 2 TWG outlets within ION. One of the cafe was fully occupied. Went to the other one.

Decided to have afternoon tea there. Ordered Russian Earl Grey & English Breakfast with some macaroons. The tea were smooth went well with the different flavours macaroons. Simply fantastic.

Enjoyed. Truly enjoyed."
Nice & Cheap macarons,"I was craving for macaron for a few days and read so many good reviews about how cheap it is, no force for minimum buy etc. I decided to give it a shot.

I ordered ; moroccan mint, sakura and earl gray to tried.

The shells was little too soft and already cracked when they packed it. I have to hold it gently while eating. Taste was nice though.

The ganache was perfect. It wasn't too runny or to sticky.

I like Moroccan Mint the best. Sakura was my second. Earl Grey was too sweet but nice smell of high quality tea.

The staffs were all nice and friendly."
Falling in love with this place,"I love to drink tea and knew TWG has great selection and tea. Visited this place with friends and OMG!!! their tea menu is 4 full pages and if you are a tea addict, Im sure you will love this place. I had white tea and they gave you colorful macaron to accompany you while enjoying the tea too . The cafe design is very classy and elegant. Love it!"
Awesome sandwiches and dessert - perfect for Sunday brunch,"I am an ""old"" customer of TWG for their awesome and huge choice of teas (the one with cherry blossom if my favourite).

I recently went there for a brunch, and had a very good experience! I took the club royale which was PERFECT, a club sandwich with smoked salmon, really tasty/light (with a nice sauce and vegetables). My best sandwich experience in Singapore!
Afterwards I took the cheesecake with forest fruits - awesome and so good looking on the plate (see pictures). Definitely going back for another Sunday brunch!"
Stylish break,"If you love tea, you'll love this place - the variety is amazing! From same type of tea grown from different continents, to blends to decaffeinated flower tea, almost everything you can think of - it's there. The brunch menu is great as well, I've taken an open sandwich set, and the blend of the flavors is amazing. Great place if you're tired after walking for endless hours at ion."
If you are a Tea lover - you have to go here!,Great food and deserts and literally 1000's of teas to choose from. I always stop here when in Singapore to buy tea and accessories even if I don't have time to stop to eat.
Stylish setting for afternoon tea,"Worth the queueing up just for the experience alone! Though on weekends the line can be a bit crazy.
They specialise in tea so expect a massive tea menu to order from and be sure to ask for a recommendation if you do get a bit confused.
I always order fresh scones with tea jelly and clotted cream to go with the tea, but there's also light snacks if you do get hungry.
P.S- Service can be a bit slow though since it's a busy place pretty much any time of the day."
INTERESTING SELECTION OF TEAs,"Very interesting selection of Teas. Do try the SIngapore Bfast tea. Great as souvenir to take home. Service is very indifferent and robotic as is with service in general in Singapore. Very expensive for an afternoon tea. More of a special treat. I assumed that the inspiration for this concept must have come from ""Mariagge"" Paris. TWG should learn how to serve and treat their customers like in Marriagge as well."
