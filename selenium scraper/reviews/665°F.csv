Poor experience with upset stomach after,"Service was terrible. Slow unattentive unwelcoming Food was above average, until we all came home with an upset and unsettled stomach. Won‚Äôt go back."
Great Ambiance,Our Ma√Ætre D' was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. They made good recommendations and helped make our family dinner go smoothly. Ask to be seated in the Cellar area for the cozy lighting and skyline views. The Cedar Plank Salmon was particularly good!
Anniversary Meal!,"Food that we ordered: Steak Oscar, Lobster Mac and Cheese, Truffle Fries.

Steak Oscar was really well marinated, with really juicy lobster meat topped on top of the tenderloin, rating 9/10.

Lobster Mac and Cheese was quite watery in my opinion, but it gets better after every bite, rating 7/10.

Truffle fries, I would say a solid 10/10, the sauce was really good to go with the fries as well.

Overall, an excellent place to have celebrations or anniversaries, but a possible downside is the waiting time, we reached the restaurant at 620pm, got seated, and placed our orders by 630pm, and we only got our food 45minutes later, so do have a heads up for the waiting time, but regardless the food was worth the wait so the whole experience was really worth it!"
Birthday dinner!,"Came here for my birthday dinner, our first visit to this steakhouse.

We ordered A4 Kagoshima Wagyu 200g, US Prime Ribeye 300g, Crabcake, Grilled Octopus, Mash potatoes & Lobster Bisque.

The A4 Wagyu was delicious, great marbling on the meat and cooking was on point for medium rare cook.

The US Prime ribeye was tasty too.

Crabcake was delicious- filled with generous fillings of crab meat along side with sauce which lifts the overall flavour.

Grilled Octopus was tasty, nicely cooked and not rubbery texture. Seasoning taste interesting.

Mash potatoes is smooth, seasoning can be a little stronger. Taste slightly lack of salt.

However I didnt like the lobster bisque, it smelled every nice full of lobster flavour however there is a bitter after taste. A little underwhelming for the soup.

Service was very good, staffs are attentive and friendly.

Overall it was a nice dining experience. Place is small and cosy. Won't really enjoy the view unless you are seated right next to the windows. Worth a visit nevertheless."
"Food was decent, view was great but..","The steak was generally okay, the restaurant was really small with very limited seats. Was seated far from the window panes even though requested for window seats (i know it's subject to avail.) hence there is no view. However, I saw the seats avail and requested to swap for it during dessert, and was gladly changed. View was pretty nice if you got to sit there, while I was expecting more though. It's 4 stars since I got the view during dessert time."
(Very) late dinner in a freezer,"We were guests at the hotel and decided to try this restaurant for our Christmas Eve dinner given the good reviews we had read.
Our table was at 20:30 but when we arrived we had to wait in a queue for half an hour, standing and without anyone telling us a word on when we would be able to eat.
Overall, the food was really good, we also had some special request due to allergies and food preferences and the chef was so kind not only to remove truffle form a couple of dishes but also to serve us an alternative starter.

The food is worth 5 stars for me but the waiting time for the table was absurd and the bill was 188$ per person wine excluded (we had 4 glasses of water - no bottle was given to us - a coke $8 and a Heineken, which was $16). Also, after waiting ages between courses, at 10pm my dad asked for a coffee and we were told the service was done for the night‚Ä¶ luckily when we asked to another waiter we were able to get an espresso and the bill (which also took ages). Bear in mind that when you get the receipt, you will have the total, +10% service and +7% GTS.

Our opinion is NOT worth it. Food 5 stars, service 2 only for the chef‚Äôs kindness and it was also freezing cold."
Expensive drink list,"Ice water chargeable at $3 per person. Soft drinks $8, coffee and tea also about $8. Food wise is not too bad."
-,Place was good however the portion was quite small for the lunch tasting menu and is costly for the small portion of food that was served.
Memorable Lunch,"Just celebrated a wonderful birthday for my wife at 665F. The staffs were professional, attentive, friendly and served from the heart. They made a difference and made our dining experience a very memorable one. Of course, the food was really delicious; and the high floor dining was nice as well.

2 incidents stood out. First was when they checked on our meals. My wife ordered the Lobster Thermidor and made a comment that the lobster did not taste as fresh to those she had previously. The staffs took such pride on their dishes that they immediately offered to cook another fresh lobster for my wife; though we said that it was all fine and food was still good and edible. In the end, they insisted and took away my wife‚Äôs Lobster Thermidor and returned with another freshly cooked lobster; and it was good! What impressed us was the pride the staffs took in ensuring they deliver a quality food and that patrons have a wonderful experience.

Second was somehow they discovered that it was my wife‚Äôs birthday though I did not mentioned it to any one; and surprised us with a simple cake. Their attention to details and keen observations was really impressive. Special mention to Colin and another Indian server (sorry I didn‚Äôt catch your name) for making a difference and gave us such a memorable dining experience that we still talk about it. Will definitely be sharing our experiences to our friends and looking forward to our next visit. Thank YOU!"
Dinner,I truly enjoy the dinner here. One of the best steaks I‚Äôve ever taste! The staff and service is very attentive and professional. One of the few restaurants that provides halal top quality steaks. Very suitable for a special occasion. Highly recommended üíØüíØüíØ
one of my fav birthday dinner experiences!,"service, food and ambience ‚Äî all 5/5‚≠êÔ∏è

booked this place to celebrate my birthday with my mum (we share our birthdays) and got the dinner tasting experience. and have to say that i really really enjoyed it, and so did my mum!

the 6-course tasting menu is super value for money considering the food in the set (lobster AND steak? wow). aside from that, most of the flavours of the dishes were very well balanced. one of my favourite dishes was the raspberry sorbet with the ginger flower gelee because the tartness of the sorbet was balanced out with the spice and slight sweetness of the gelee. another favourite was the hojicha tiramisu. i‚Äôve never been the biggest fan of hojicha because i don‚Äôt really like the bitterness, but in the tiramisu, the maple cream really nicely added a touch of sweetness while the walnut feuilletine added a crisp that made the texture interesting. mind you ‚Äî not the biggest fan of dessert but my favs had to be the desserts. aside from that the steak was REALLY soft and flavourful, and the lobster bisque ‚Äî while it doesn‚Äôt look like much ‚Äî was so tasty with big bites of lobster in it.

the servers also very patiently explained each dish, which i really appreciated. this was also the first time a restaurant gave us 2 cakes and i really appreciated that too! their birthday cake is very well balanced ‚Äî tart raspberry icing with a sweet, dense chocolate sponge cake.

i also really loved the ambience! i‚Äôm such a huge fan of dark woods, and this place was full of it. the view was fantastic and after sunset, the lighting is dark and moody but with small lamps to illuminate your dishes. would definitely be a romantic date night spot!

would definitely recommend for a beautiful night out for a special occasion or a cute (albeit slightly pricey) date night! also make sure to drop by the observation deck on 39 after hehe"
Great Service & Food,"Service staff was attentive, knowledgeable and took great initiative. Our overseas guests were very happy and pleased with the level of service and the quality of the food. They are very prompt and attentive to the request from customers. One of my guests was so pleased that she got her food served before she rushed for her flight."
Good food but be prepared to wait,"Went for dinner with my wife on Wed night and the restaurant was serving a full house. We ordered within 5 minutes of arrival and the wait began‚Ä¶ 30mins before our appetiser (a salad) arrived‚Ä¶ and after we finished the appetisers, it took an hour before our mains arrived. The food was good, but I don‚Äôt think we will be going back anytime soon."
Worth a visit if you‚Äôre staying in the hotel,"Two sections in this restaurant, both small and feel cramped for a newer building and the high prices.

The cellar on the left is significantly warmer/cosier. (Recommended) The room on the right feels like family dining, Denny‚Äôs style, basic, with tables close together.

Overall the food was very good. Expect to pay around $800 for two."
"Good value set lunch, bad attitude manager","Arrived at the restaurant few minutes before 12pm. A male manager was at the counter. He ignored the 7-8 customers in front of him and looked into the screen all the time. It was obvious that he tried hard to avoid any eye contact. What an unpleasant way to get to know the restaurant!

When it was a few minutes past 12pm, the manager finally decided to look up. When showing us to our seat, I mentioned to him that we would prefer window seats, and while he was already gesturing us to the seats next to the window, he replied coldly that there will be no guarantee that you get a window seat?!!!! I have never met anyone more rude than him in this kind of restaurant set up. There were no smile on his face throughout, zero eye contact, and the few words coming out of his mouth were as cold as ice. To say that we felt unwelcome was a serious understatement. A real bad start of our anniversary lunch.

The female waiter serving us was very polite and attentive, saving our day slightly. However she‚Äôs probably new so more training needed for taking orders. But it didn‚Äôt bother us much after earlier cold treatment by the manager.

We had set lunch, ordered pumpkin soup and Spanish Octopus as appetizers. Both were good. The mains were wagyu flank steak and king salmon. The steak was well seasoned and charred, slightly rare for medium though. King salmon was quite average, the meat lacks flavour of king salmon, and the herbs were overpowering. Sides were creamed spinach, mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. All decent although the creamed spinach was slightly salty. The sauce were no impressive, the mains were better without them. Desserts were creme caramel and basque cheesecake. We like the creme caramel better.

The 3-course meal priced at $58++ was of good value, given the quality of food and generous serving. Unfortunately the experience was ruined by the bad attitude of the manager. This is the first time that we get so offended that we were compelled to leave a detailed review. We observed that he gave the same cold treatment to another couple who arrived around the same time as us. However, when another big group came along, sitting next to us, we noticed that the manager eagerly took over from the waiter, taking orders attentively. We were unsure why the selective treatment, maybe his pay was tied to the number of customers. In any case, this is totally unacceptable, please do something about it!"
Dinner and drinks on F1 weekend,"Very accomodating at last minute, food was excellent and service at the table was even better. Would highly recommend"
Turns out to be disappointment,"I was looking forward to the dinner however it turns out I did not have a pleasant dinner as I would expect it to be.

We ordered a bottle of red wine, it was out of stock. It was totally fine.

Thereafter the food came, we had crab cake. It was a disappointment judging from the price and dining in a fancy restaurant. The crab meat was very very minimal, can‚Äôt really taste any crab inside. It was quite shredded to the extent that no real crab tasted and also the cake has added many other ingredients more than the crab thus it covers the real taste of crab. It did not justify the amount stated there for the quality given.

Now the main course, my partner and I had a plate of steak each. To my disappointment it only came with my 300g of steak and a bulb of pathetic garlic?!!!!!!!!!

I paid so much just to get a steak WITHOUT any side dishes???????

AND WORST THING NO SAUCE WAS GIVEN AS A CONDIMENT?!

Selection of sauces cost $5?!!!!!

I was so stun and however I ordered because if not my steak will taste quite dry.

Lastly, the restaurant is an open concept kitchen. At around 9.30pm we were still dining there and we saw the kitchen staff starts to clear up the kitchen to close for the day? I mean it‚Äôs not a good sight in front of customers that the staff can‚Äôt wait to go home whilst customers are still eating.

It totally makes us pressurise that we should finish our food faster.

Absolutely understand that staff can‚Äôt wait to go home but personally I felt it‚Äôs not a pleasant sight especially if it‚Äôs an open concept kitchen.

Will never go back again.

Restaurant is small and compact as well.

Not justifiable for the price paid."
Disappointed with service and food!,"I had arranged for a dinner for my husband's birthday at 665¬∞F based on reviews. It will be the last time I will ever dine at this restaurant! We ordered Crab Cake, Scallops and salad for starters and 1.2kg TOMAHAWK with fries for main and 1 chocolate cake for birthday and a mango Pavlova. The wine was from the sommelier's list. The food was unpalatable!!! The crab cake has a funny tasted and smell and so did the scallops. The Tomahawk (asked to be cooked medium) but was cooked medium rare and meat for chewy!!! The chocolate cake was served with a yoghurt cream which ruined the taste. Only decent saving for the night was the wine and the pavlova. Its disappointing that none of the service staff where keen to ask if we needed anything. We had to ask them to clear the uneaten food and no question was asked why the food was barely touched. I had called in and advised it was my husband's birthday and if they could assist with preparing a small cake which I would of course pay for. But when I arrived they did not remember my request! No one followed up. Nothing!!! I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."
1st try and shall be the last,"Brought here by my partner to celebrate our anniversary. Service was great, the premium price paid was only the ambiance. One regret was ordering some 36 hours cooked Wagyu. Once it enters your throat, you feel the oil just literally streaming into it. I am not eating steak for the next year at least. Irrkh! It's my first experience here, but I strongly believe that there's better steak places that's worth the premium pricing."
Great place to celebrate our anniversary,"Had a lovely time at dinner with delightful Wagyu steak and iberico pork chops. The steak melted in your mouth and the pork chops were tasty. If you go choose a side of Mac and cheese - so good but so bad! A surprise dessert for our anniversary rounded off the meal. Thanks to Dana, Colin, Raj, Yiling and Chef Boon!"
Birthday dinner,"Our wonderful nite begins with this restaurant delicious food, nice atmosphere, good view from where we r sitting... and we r serve by yiling, dana & colin very attentive very polite and helpful üëçüèª Will definitely come back again!! üòÑüòÅ"
One of the Best in Singapore,"Services - 5 stars
Food - 5 stars
Ambient - 5 stars

this is one restaurant that ticked all the boxes for a nice evening out. from the moment we walked in, services was top notched.. one has the feeling that your privacy are not intruded and yet svs staff are always around to serve you politely.
we ordered grilled jumbo prawns, octopus, steak and its really tender and juicy.. the sides mac and cheese, before the waiter leave us, he said this will be one of singapore best mac and cheese.. and i wholeheartedly agreed with him.. Onion rings another wonderful sides that one must not missed. All in all, leave the place full and happy."
Amazing,"We had dinner with our friends last night at 665 F. It is a really special place. The views are amazing, food was delicious and service was excellent. They had very good gluten free options for our coeliac son also, which is surprisingly hard to find in Singapore. Highly recommend."
family dinner,food here was scrumptious and the service by Evinder and Lucas was very good! had a pleasant dinner experience at 665F and hope to be back again :-)
Great service,"Reserved the table for my partner's birthday and requested for a window seat. Staff assigned us a window seat and also included a Happy birthday on our dessert without me having to remind them. It was a seamless experience!

Food was also excellent with fantastic view of the strawberry full moon that night."
Unfortunately very poor service and many items unavailable,"We visited for an intimate friend‚Äôs farewell dinner at their first service (6.30pm) and were sat at the cellar side.
When asked about the chef tasting menu, the waiter came back and just said that some items of the menu were missing without even being apologetic. So we had to clarify whether that means they could do a different version of the chef menu or whether that the menu was not available at all and we had to go √† la carte. What he meant was the latter.
A la carte, another dish in the menu was not available as well: on that one we were informed before placing our order.
When ordering drinks, we ordered cocktails and a mocktail. Once the cocktails were served, only then it was announced to us that the mocktail was not available‚Ä¶ so we asked for a different one and requested to remove one of the ingredient : if you don‚Äôt like cinnamon‚Ä¶ too bad for you most of their remaining mocktails contain it and they can‚Äôt remove it‚Ä¶ and they are not even trying to propose alternative solutions.
Finally when it came to desserts, a first waiter came and asked whether we wanted to order desserts so we replied yes and asked for the menu. The menu never came‚Ä¶ until a second waiter asked us the same question about desserts and we asked a second time for the menu, only then we were given the menu!

Overall a disappointing experience from the staff even though the food served was good."
Good service and great food.,Nice and cozy environment. The scenery from the top is beautiful. Food is great and service is good. And the serving staffs are friendly and knowledgeable.
Anniversary celebration,"Last min reservation after realising my booking was cancelled while overlooking on my emails but yet, they acceded to my requests. Thankful for having a wonderful evening to celebrate my anniversary.

Greeted with a great smile and instead of making us wait outside the restaurant, they brought us to enjoy the nice view up at level 39.

Had a nice decorated dessert well fitted for our celebration.

The overall experience was good and comfortable.

The food : just delicious!

We ordered the Boston Lobster, Pork chop with 2 sides and an appetiser to start. (I wasn't expecting myself to be full as I am a big eater but no, I was wrong. Portions were pretty decent.)

Ps: the mac and cheese side dish was a delight for me (though a pretty common side dish, one of the better ones I tried)

The service crews were very attentive and took initiatives in every ways.

Would sincerely like to thank Andaz Sg and 665F for being so responsive while I was worried bout flopping my wedding anniversary.

So therefore, thank you guys for a job well done!"
Beautiful food,"We visited this restaurant for our 10 year wedding anniversary and we were not disappointed. We had the pairing menu and enjoyed every course. Stunning views, excellent food. Loved that you can watch the chefs cook your food. They also acknowledged our anniversary with a desert plate. Only critique was the servers cleared every course extremely fast.
Food was beautiful!"
Unpleasant dinner experience.,"Service is poor. Doesn't feels we are been taking care of the service staffs there. Not a spacious restaurant, feeling kind of crowded of the dining room. Not even have enough space to prepare a basket or small stool to keep our belonging likes lady hand bags, presents, bouquet. There 's actually a birthday' s celebration dinner.
Food is just decent for that pricing. Wines overall is higher charging compare to similar restaurants. $10 cakeage charge has been informed in early. When the bill checks, that $10 charges per pax for cakeage which is $10 √ó7 =$70 ++ and yet with that charging no one bother to help us up to serving the cake. And I gotta done it all by my own cutting the cake request for the fresh plate passing around the cutting piece.
Not a very pleasant dining experience with $1578 spent. Higher expectations."
Singapore‚Äôs best steakhouse!,"First time here and it did not disappoint!

A must try steakhouse in Singapore, guaranteed with a good food, good view and best service.

Would like to especially mention the blue swimmer crab cake as the appetizer and a perfect cut of Black Onyx Ribeye with grilled Boston Lobster and pan seared Foie Gras. Just perfection!

My husband and I would like to thank the whole kitchen team especially Chef Boon and also the service team spearheaded by Evinder and Collin. Also not to forget the great host that provided us with a very nice table- Khairul.
We also met Lucas and Dana who took care of us in the second half of our stay.

Thank you everyone! Keep up the good work!"
Great steak with a view,Amazing steaks perfectly seasoned and cooked. Great service. Sea buckthorn and blood orange sorbets were a real discovery
Didn‚Äôt match expectations,"Booking this place was seamless - the ask to have $150 to hold reservation which was understandable

Place wasn‚Äôt so easy to locate
Upon arrival the only male staff at the front just watched me going through trying to find my way around
I ended straight in their kitchen and was guided back out again.

The whole experience was rather impersonal and hurried

One has to ask a lot of questions to get details from a already very limited and expensive menu. I probably expected the service staff to be more forthcoming with recommendations eg pairings, side dishes etc

I ordered ribeye steak for my dad, salmon for my mum and scallops for myself

I had to ask about the side dishes

The bread came cold and hard. One hard bread and One butter knife for 3 of us to share

Used Towels were left on table whole evening not cleared

Steak came without any sauce I had to ask for the options and it was served later which by then my dad was so hungry he ate 30% of the steak. Thought this would have been part of the initial order.

no one bothered to ask about the food during our dinner or if it was ok.

Steak was really dry and lacking in taste
Fish wasn‚Äôt cooked well.

Service was hurried as we have to clear within 1.5 hours.

For the $400 it‚Äôs better elsewhere."
Anniversary Dinner,The ambiance was fantastic when we had dinner. The services was also tip-top. Very friendly and helpful when we needed some advice as it was both our first time there. Amazing food and amazing dining space. The portion of the food was quite huge and worth the price! Its was a great dining experience for us!
"Pricey but good steaks in a classy, late evening dining atmosphere","Service was excellent‚Äîattentive and professional. The steaks and side orders similarly good, though falling slightly short of the best I've ever had, and I found them a bit overpriced. One dish we ordered was the beef ribs, which were too salty and oily. Very satisfied with all the other dishes as well as the wine selection, though, and the Tiramasu we had for dessert was delicious. Would return."
Birthday celebration,Great service by Lucas + delicious food & drink + nice ambient. View to kill - day or night. Will bring guests.
Great place overall!,"So I hosted a small birthday dinner for my GF's daughter here. Never been here before. Bottom line: Wonderful food and service! The steaks were cooked perfectly. Appetizers were excellent. Service was impeccable and always at the right moment. The view is stunning. Dana was our hostess and she was wonderful. Lucas, Colin, and Remon was also good. Chef Boon really knows how to run his kitchen and cook! In the end, it was a very memorable birthday dinner. Very good for business dinners."
"Great food, even greater service staff","Went in April 2022 during lunch for my wedding anniversary to try a particular drink we had before some time back. We were told the mocktails will only be served during dinner. So we came back for dinner in May 2022, food was great as per all the 3 times we came. One thing commendable is the impeccable service. Ryan and Dana were very knowledgeable and were very attentive to us. Ryan even took the description of the drink we had before to help verify which it was as the names of the drinks on the menu was not very familiar. He also helped us explained which items on the menu were ‚Äúhalal friendly‚Äù. I am very grateful for the help! I secretly hope that they would remove the pork items off so that I‚Äôll feel more at ease if I ever were to re-visit."
Unfortunately not great for business lunches anymore.,"Wow - this place has changed.

The lunch menu is more limited than it was previously, and taking away the lunch drinks menu is a big step backwards.

This was a favorite for a business lunch and a glass of wine at a reasonable cost, unfortunately it‚Äôs now outside many business lunch budgets."
"Great food, service & view","Had a wonderful time for family lunch, had table facing open kitchen, seeing the chefs busy prep & cooking our tomahawk . Food was on point, view was spectacular and service was exceptional. Many thanks to the chef & team as well as to Colin & Jiaxuan who were very attentive at service. Gladly return with friends again.."
Great experience,"We went for the set lunch on a weekday. It was full house even though it's a working day. Food was great - the mains are nice, while the appetisers and desserts could have more choices. The desserts were more towards the sour side, and since I'm not a fan of nuts and have a sweet tooth, there were practically nothing for me to choose from, except for the sad one scoop of vanilla ice cream. We were also sad that our favourite sauce, the champagne hollandaise was removed from the set lunch menu.

The service this time round was way better than the previous time we came - we were served by Michelle & Jia Xuan, who were meticulously taking care of our needs. Our food came quite late but Michelle was really apologetic and got our food served to us right away after we raised it up to her."
Dinner,"Celebrated my 1st wedding anniversary here. The restaurant is cosy with a good view overlooking the singapore flyer and river. Jia Xuan, Lucas and Remon were attentive throughout the service and even recommended spot-on additions to our orders to ensure we had a fully balanced and well rounded meal. The three, with Chef Leon, provided excellent service which made our night so pleasant. Foodwise, the burratini was excellent although the serving was on the smaller side. the rhug ribeye and A4 wagyu which was rich and perfectly medium rare. Would definitely recommend a visit here!"
Fantastic food quality and environment,"First time back after their renovation. Food is still great as before, steak perfectly done. The more senior service staff gave great friendly feeling, A couple of younger slightly more rusty in services and can be improved,
Overall i will definitely come back again. highly recommended place that will not disappoint."
Awesome service and food,"Chose this location as a farewell to our colleague. The service was great and we were especially blown away when my colleague was presented with a card wishing her all the best with a print of our group photo and signed by their team. We were surprised as none of us mentioned to prepare anything.
It was really thoughtful and I would like to thank the whole team for making it such an enjoyable lunch with great food. Special call-out to Khairul, who had gone the extra mile and meticulous care to make it a truly memorable farewell lunch for us.
Definitely will recommend this place!
Everyone loved the wagyu flank we had from the set lunch and the hokkaido scallops I've had was really tasty"
Great view and good food . Easier to get a reservation here on chope than to make a reservation directly 665¬∞F.,"I've been back twice in the last 3 weeks. I do a lot of work lunches and dinners here. The view is great and the food is good.
The service could be improved though.
I've had a lunch meeting whereby the customer got spritzed in the face by wine."
Dinner on 10/4/2022,"Food was good, service staff were all so attentive and helpful, went out of their way to offer warm water when I had a flu"
:),"Nice ambience, Excellent service, superb food. Highly recommend you to dine here especially for special occasions!"
Value for money set lunch menu,"Made a reservation few weeks in advance for Friday lunch. Staff member called a day before to confirm our reservation.

When we arrived, we were ushered swiftly to the table. View was ok (there was a construction nearby). It was quite crowded but not noisy.

We were served by Raj who was attentive throughout our meal. We went for the set lunch menu and the food didn‚Äôt disappoint. I had the beef tartare, tenderloin and a yuzu & cr√®me trifle.
Would definitely visit again or recommend my friends to!"
"Great food, excellent service","Had my Dad‚Äôs birthday here, staff(Raj, Colin, Remon, Khai, JX, Dana) really made everything happen smoothly. Originally there weren‚Äôt any seats for the 5 of us but they also accommodated our request and exceeded my expectation by giving us a private dining area. Dinner was great and they even gave us a handwritten card and a printed photograph for memories sake. 10/10 experience"
Celebrated birthday,"Ambience had a classy, lounge type of vibe. The decor was quite appealing.
Food was good. The steak and octopus were cooked well, flavourful as well. The scallops and lobster bisque are good to have as well.
Ryan and Glenn were our severs for the evening. They were attentive and helpful in advising the menu. They were also prompt in speaking to the kitchen when they heard that the wife was allergic to the desert and helped to change it. Much appreciated!"
Perfect dinner date night!,"Celebrated my fiance's birthday at 665! We had a wonderful evening at this beautiful restaurant. The food is wonderful, and service is amazing!

Special thanks to Jia Xuan and Glenn who were very hospitable and made our evening truly enjoyable.

We had a great time, and everything exceeded our expectations. Many thanks to the team for creating this special moment for us, and we'd definitely be back to celebrate our special occasions here again!"
Jedwin Eats Beef for his Birthday,"The extra bread should be free! but overall good experience. The Sanchoku wagyu was 10/10, incredibly tender. The service was good."
Birthday dinner,Thank you for the amazing service. We had a great time and totally enjoy our experience here. 100% would recommend! Also special thanks to Dana Yiling for serving us and made us comfortable the whole time :-)
665 review,"Beautiful restaurant with delicious food by Chef Boon! Service staff Remon was very helpful when making a reservation, and Dana provided exceptional service and recommendations on what to order! Lucas was also attentive in ensuring we had enough water throughout our meal. A great meal!"
Amazing food and service,"Short ribs was beautifully cooked, and waitress Michelle kindly recommended the perfect sauce to go with it üëç The mac & cheese was excellent too!"
Excellent service and good ambiance,"Had a lunch on 17 Mar 22. Excellent service from Michelle & Colin team. Very polite and her service is the best. Pleasant view, good food ..Enjoy our lunch"
"Delicious Food, Fantastic Service and a Panoramic View","Booked lunch at 665 F for my early birthday staycay at Andaz Hotel. We had a fantastic 2-course set lunch. Mushroom soup & crab cake appetisers were heavenly! The main course of Wagyu was wonderfully tender and juicy, topped with baked garlic that was sweet & fragrant. My daughter's salmon was out of the world - fresh, juicy & succulent. For sides, we had creamy mashed potatoes and saut√©ed mushrooms. At the end of the meal, the staff surprised with a lovely chocolate brownie cake topped with passionfruit, a new dessert item - complimentary for my birthday! The service staff was hospitable, warm & friendly, and often checked in on how we were enjoying our time at the restaurant. We could see lovely a panoramic view of the Singapore skyline covered in thick clouds a la winter as it was the day when temperatures plunged in Singapore and much of the city skyscrapers were reportedly shrouded by low hanging storm clouds! It was an experience quite like no other, strongly recommended for that special day to treat yourself for a job well done!"
"Good ambiance, Excellent service and Exceptional food!","My husband and I celebrated our 1 year wedding anniversary at 665! We‚Äôre both so delighted by the service as we‚Äôre served by staff named Michelle. She‚Äôs so warm and friendly throughout our service dinner. Thank you for that. Aside customer service, we also enjoyed the ambiance and the food that was cooked by Chef Boon! Food was 10/10! Instantly made our day and love how creative and how pleasing the food was! They surprised us with anniversary cake to celebrate with & we absolutely enjoy the overall experience at 665. <3 will visit again in near future! Overall satisfied customer! 10/10!"
Great service,"Delicious food, nice ambience and decor. A super great service from the team especially Lucas and Colin. Well done 665 F team. Will visit again"
Amazing food and service,"Love the food and environment.
Great service by Michelle and Khairul.
Excellent from the moment we were seated till payment.
Super attentive and responsive to our orders and requirements.
Michelle is super bubbly and courteous, speaking with her brightens up your day.
Super recommend the lobster! Super yummy"
A wonderful dinner anniversary!,"We had our anniversary dinner there at the restaurant for the first time and it was amazing. From the time we walked into the restaurant, to the recommendation for the type of food & drinks. Amazing cooks and not to forget the staff that served us was spectacular. We would like to thank Lucas and the team for making our dinner a wonderful one which we will never forget. Looking forward to have our meal at the restaurant again someday. Cheers!"
Pleasant experience,"Brought my mom on her birthday on 2/3 and would like to thank Michelle, Rasyid and Dana for providing such wonderful service. It was my 2nd time there and I'll come again soon."
Amazing New Menu and Service is top notch,"The new menu by Chef Boon is extremely good. Had the beef tenderloin, and Hokkaido scallops.

These were easily the best beef and scallops I‚Äôve tasted anywhere in Singapore. Must try.

Cr√®me dessert was good too.

Service! oh my the service standard was really top notch. Dana, Michelle, Remon and team, were very attentive, able to explain and recommend great dishes.

Explained what sauces, and garnishes to eat with the food to maximize taste.

Made the whole experience a very enjoyable and memorable time for us.

Highly recommend for anyone that was to try out awesome food with service that just makes your day."
Birthday Lunch,Thanks Colin and Michelle on the great service! Food is delicious. Would love to come here again !!!
Pauline Birthday Andaz Staycation,"A steakhouse on level 38 Andaz , we had to try. Michelle served us the whole night and highly recommended the 2.1kg Tomahawk @ $25/100g ! Excellent choice The meat was tender in the middle and crispy on the outside ! A little charred but guess it‚Äôs not easy to cook a 2ft long tomahawk! The middle was very juicy with the perfect amount of medium done-ness paired with a bottle of Prosecco! Also had broccolini, excellent texture and taste with a tinge or sourness ! Finished of with a Valrhona warm chocolate cake - awesome texture ; feel and taste, sweet and chhoclaty! We had a full view of Chef Boon orchestrating the menu with Chef Brian cooking the Tomahawk and Michelle giving us a constant commentary on the process; menu & recommendations ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Excellent night out,Beautiful night out. Food and service was top notch. Beautiful view of the city. Service by Dana and Michelle was excellent. Will surely come back again.
Splendid evening dinner with beautiful view and delicious meal :),"We were served by YiLing & Remon. Both of them were attentive to our needs and recommended us the best steak, the best mocktails and the best dessert and all of the food we received were so delicious!!!!

YiLing had such a good taste! She was polite, sweet and ensure that my husband and I were comfortable .

My husband requested to sit beside the window and the view was incredibly magnificent.

Definitely the bestest anniversary dinner ever! Would recommend all of you to be here if you're going for a romantic ambience!!!"
Excellent Birthday Dinner!,"Brought my husband on the 20th to celebrate his birthday, and it was such an amazing experience! The staff provided excellent service, especially Dana. What impressed me most was when she voiced out which sauces do not have alcohol before I could even ask. She was also honest with her recommendations, and we truly appreciate that :) Rasyid and Jia Xuan were pleasant and friendly too. At the end of our meal, Dana surprised my husband with a small cake, and I was surprised too because while I mentioned in my reservation that it was a birthday celebration, I did not expect the restaurant to prepare something. All in all, great ambience, great people, and great food! Will definitely return."
We had a great time üòä,"Had our first fancy dinner as husband & wife here during our staycation.

Scallops: 5/5
Wagyu Beef Steak: 5/5
Peri-peri chicken: 5/5
Mac & Cheese: 5/5
Sauteed mushroom:5/5
Service: 10/5

Cheers to Colin & his team for making it a memorable occasion for us. Special thanks to Jia Xuan for the good recommendations."
Bachelorette Party of 5,Bachelorette Party of 5 - we were upgraded to the private area for the festivities. The service was impeccable as we were greeted by Dana. We had come earlier to leave our cakes and goodies. Dana graciously acceded to our requests without any hiccups. She was very polite throughout and never made us feel uncomfortable at all‚Ä¶ she ensured that our dinner went swell! The mac and cheese side was extremely yummy. The bisque could have been creamier as it was more watered down. The crab cake was good! The wagyu flank was super good. The ambience was so beautiful‚Ä¶ the view- simply spectacular!! The only downside to the experience was being told to quieten down three times. I‚Äôm not sure what the etiquette is when it comes to having fun ‚Ä¶ people usually are merry when it comes to bonding over food. The restaurant perhaps need to work on some norms to guests since voice level seems to be an issue. Communication should be worked on when relaying such sensitive ‚Äúcommands‚Äù to patrons. Another downside to the experience was that getting in touch with the restaurant via calls can be quite difficult. So ensure that you plan ahead. I guess it‚Äôs all worthwhile as servers like Dana and the view make up for it! Cheers
Good ambience & service,Big thanks to Jia Xuan and Team for the excellent services provided. They were prompt in attending to our requests and especially to Jia Xuan for helping me and my wife take photos of us with the fantastic view! My wife has been singing praises for their services! Thank you for a great Valentine's Day for both of us!
Valentines Day Dinner 2022,Spectacular service especially by Jess and Jia Xuan who served our table for the night! Paired with amazing food and a romantic ambience - perfect combination for Valentines! Definitely will be coming back for more!
"Amazing ambiance, food and service!","I had visited the restaurant to celebrate my anniversary.
A day before the visit, I was called to confirm my booking as well as being asked if we are celebrating any occasion.
Upon reaching the place, we were greeted warmly by the staff and was led to the table in no time after verifying.
We were seated with a fantastic view and the order made were easy, with the help of the staff.
The food was displayed perfectly and the taste is amazing. The interval for my 3 course meal was just right.
The day was end with a nice and delicious cake to celebrate our occassion.
A sure place to recommend couples celebrating special occassion."
Birthday celebration,"Excellent service crew! The team checked in often to ensure we are comfortable and enjoying ourselves especially I had my little daughter with us during the dinner. One of the crew (Jess) even offered us a tour to their newly renovated space which I can‚Äôt wait for as it is perfect for family gathering!
Food was amazing! A must try for the lobster bisque."
Birthday Celebrations,"Had a staycation at Andaz and made one dinnertime a birthday celebration for my brother in law. Lovely to be high up at 665¬∞F to enjoy the view together with the food. Well-served by Rasyid, alongside other attentive staff JiaXuan, Dana and Remon."
665¬∞ An Amazing night out,"I wanted a break from my busy life and have a good steak. 665 delivered. The service and the food was immaculate. The steak was just daaaaamn. The staff that attended to me were Colin, Remon, Jia Xuan and Chef Leon. I think I got their names correct. These people were just amazing. The service made the food taste better. To all you peeps out there. Go to 665¬∞ and enjoy yourselves."
Anniversary Dinner,"My husband and I had a delightful evening eating at 665. The ambiance and the food were superb. The staff were friendly and very accommodating to our special request, as our 10 month old is allergic to dairy, egg and peanut. I could tell that even she had enjoyed her meal as she ate most of her kingfisher salmon and mash potato.

We were very happy that the restaurant is baby friendly. Even though my baby kept dropping things on the floor, the staff were patient and also kept playing with her. We were served by Dana, Collin, Yi ling, Khairul and Remon. Special thanks to Dana for the great service an making our baby laugh and smile"
Excellence,"My hubby and I decided to try this place out for our wedding anniversary. Initially thought the restaurant was very small but after a while it grows on you. Overall ambience is warm and cosy. Perfect for dates.

We were delightfully served by JX and Lucas who were both so attentive to our needs and approachable. Shootout to Lucas who made us feel comfortable and could answer all the questions we kept asking him about the restaurant. Sommelier Helen also discussed wine options with us without any disdain.

The food was superb. Kudos to chef Boon and his team for such excellent quality meats! We especially loved the lamb. True chefs kiss.

Definitely will come back and this time we will bring our friends"
Visit to 665 restaurant,"My recent visit at 665 restaurant at Andaz Singapore was splendid and was impressed of their service by Jian Xuan, Colin, Michelle and Lucas. Many thanksüôè ans wish to revisit."
A different 665 after renovation,"Refreshed decor at the entranced. Chic looking. Not quite the same can be said about restaurant front desk staff. Haughty behaviour and rather clueless as well. Had to be cued.

Waiting staff within the restaurant did not fair better either. Table service had huge room for improvement. No small plates or common cutleries were offered for sharing plates. A very discernible slip in service level.

Food was the only saving grace in the whole experience that night. Kudos to the kitchen crew.

Going to think twice returning when planning for a steak meal.
Overall a disappointment."
Excellent,"The service was excellent. We had purchased a set lunch package online through Hyatt to try the newly renovated restaurant for our 25th wedding anniversary, but due to Covid the construction was delayed and lunch sittings were unavailable. Given the expiry of the package and other unforeseen circumstances we had to use the package early and the team were very accommodating and allowed us to book for a Monday evening.

That night the entire team was very attentive and friendly even though it was a full house. The food was very good and the view outstanding. We want to thank the team led by Remon (Dana, Zhiyu, Jiaxuan, and Munna(I think!) for their excellent service and the chefs for the great meal.

We‚Äôll definitely be back once the renovated section is finished!"
Magnificent food and view!,"It was a memorable dinning experience at 665¬∞F. We were greeted with warmth and promptly ushered to our seats the moment we stepped in. Dana, a very friendly lady working in the restaurant was very detailed and attentive to us, providing excellent service offerings genuinely. She gave us recommendation for our steak and choice of sauce and the food was awesome. Food was served hot and fresh and we love it! Dana is very proactive, well versed in her service language, an engaging communicator which left us a deep impression. Thank you very much Dana, chefs and all the staff working at 665¬∞F for the wonderful and sincere service from the heart!"
Birthday celebration,Definitely would return for a second meal! We had an amazing dinner & enjoyed great service! It has a perfect ambience too.
great dinner,"We were looking forward to 665 re opening and forvour New Year Eve dinner we have not been disapointed ! it was perfect, meat was just delicious and service by Remon, Helen and Jiaxuan was exquisite; not surprising with a quality F&B mgr like Franck Detrait !! 665 @Andaz Sgp is a Must !"
Ask Joel for Cocktail Recommendations!,While the food wasn't amazing and we had a cocktail recommendation from Joel that left us so grateful he didn't just take our cocktail order and tried to understand what we were looking for in a cocktail. Definitely recommend anyone visiting 665 to get a cocktail recommendation from Joel!
Food was good but experience was a letdown,"It was our first visit to 665¬∞F and we had a lovely dinner for Christmas with good recommendations from staff.

However, I definitely expected more - Chef‚Äôs Tasting Menu was unavailable even though it was indicated on the website, service was slow as we waited quite abit in between courses and there was no special service even though we were there for a celebration as indicated in my reservation.

It wasn‚Äôt a memorable experience so will consider other steak houses next time."
"Delicious food, refreshing cocktails","Ordered an Argentinian Tenderloin and half Boston lobster set, beef was tasty and very tender. Love the cheese on top of the Boston lobster as well. Cocktails were great, full of flavour and refreshing. Thanks to Caleb who served us, and made us feel at home, really appreciate it!"
Perfect steak experience,"The service, the location, the decor, the view ‚Ä¶ and the food!!! Best steak in Singapore in our view!!! Perfectly cooked with an amazing selection of sides and sauces!!! Then comes desert and it‚Äôs the perfect evening!"
Amazing Dinner!,It was a great experience at 665F and we were well taken care of by the amazing service and delicious cuisine! Special shout-out to Chef Leon and James as well as the 665F team!
Amazing service ever,"My first visit of 665 steakhouse was for business lunch on last Friday.
Just wanted thank your team all for providing exceptional service!
Restaurant manager Sarah, her gracious hospitality and service throughout the day even busy crowding, professionalism, an unchanging smile, initiation to lead our experience, fabulous view, premium refreshing cocktail and cuisines (scallop and wagyu burger were amazing) - it created perfect ambience for the occasion, and the attention to details from Sara were astounding.
My decision of having business meal at Andaz was without fault and would have no hesitation in recommending this place to all of my friends and family!"
Romantic Birthday Dinner,"Brought my family here for my husband birthday dinner celebration, they upgraded us to a private dining area and wave off the minimum spend. Not to mention the food was 4/5. Love the tenderness of the meat and the view was totally a killer. Would definitely come again for the food! They even gave us a complimentary small birthday cake."
Wedding Anniversary,"We were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary intending to order the Chefs tasting menu for one of us and something else on the menu, but we're told that the tasting menu had to be ordered by both of us.
We decided against it no point both of us tasting the same food, they staff than recommend the 1kg Porterhouse steak, we specifically told them we wanted it cook in between medium rare and medium well, senior like us can't take very rare beef. However steak serve to us was raw towards the thicker part of the steak, what a disappointment.
When we told the staff about it, the answers was that because the steak was thick some parts were turn out rare, should have told us before we ordered!
To be fair the scallops and salad which we also ordered was good"
Average experience,Booked this restaurant for my wedding anniversary and they told me that they will prepare a surprise cake for my wife but it didn't happen
655F,"Great food, very nice ambience & wonder ful service.. One of the best wagyu flank steaks in town.... Sevice staff & Chef are great"
Meal in the Sky!!,"Came across a review of this restaurant and decided to give it a try. Liked the food, service and the view which makes one feel as if you are dinning in the sky!

Food wise, I have not had such a delicious meal in a long time, order the salmon which on a hindsight was slightly salty for my taste but the creamy mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms made the dish just perfect.

Overall a good place for a nice meal with a view!!"
Love the food and service,"It‚Äôs our 3rd time coming here for the food. Food is really delicious and the service is impeccable. Thank you to Ariessa , Dana, Peter and Sarah for the lovely service."
Excellent Food & Service,"I‚Äôve been 665 for Weekday Set Lunch, considering the quality, the price of the set lunch menu was excellent. All the appetizers and steaks were amazing, even the side dishes and steak sauces. I also would like to mention their services, especially Dana and James. All of the staff, including the chef(with an open kitchen), were very attentive and friendly, making the experience of 665 more enjoyable. The atmosphere is also very nice, it is highly recommended for celebration as well. I‚Äôll definitely be back!"
My go to place in Singapore,"Whether business, clients, family or friends, this is my standard place to visit atleast once or twice a week. The food is phenomenal. Service is perfect and venue is brilliant. The steaks are really good, but so is their wagyu burger. Book and go!"
Never made it,"Chope is asking me to do a review when my reservation was said to be confirmed, but the folks at 665F restaurant told me that this reservation does not exist. I made this reservation months ago for a special occasion and even received a Chope reminder on that day, but no we weren‚Äôt given a table that day. Appalling reservation system on both ends."
Impeccable!,"We had a remarkable experience at 665F. I made reservation for lunch with my mother, it was her first time there and she loves it. The service staff were incredible as well as the chefs! We were warmly greeted by Atiqah the hostess, who then ushered us to our seats. We were awed by the beautiful views. Dana then took our order, she was ever so polite and friendly. Que served us and explain the dishes to us in detail. Both ladies were attentive to our needs and provided quality service. James and Chef Wan came by our table to check our satisfaction & my mother gave her highest compliments for both the service and the food. Kudos to the chefs; Chef Wan, Chef Peter & Chef Kit for the delicious spread. The food were so scrumptious, we left the restaurant feeling completely satisfied. My mother loved every course. We ended our lunch a sweet note when a 'Thank you Mum"" cake was served, this planned surprise for her would not have been made possible without he awesome team at 665F. Thank you so much & we'll definitely be back soon!"
