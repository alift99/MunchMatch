Interesting Japanese sandwiches,"The menu offered a nice range of sandwiches. We ordered many to try amongst the 6 of us there. We enjoyed their Nitamago potato salad, the lemon grass chicken and the Dashimaki Mentai Tamago. The garlic prawn was a great disappointment. Their dessert was interesting especially the original cream puff. We enjoyed their Matcha latte."
Pure Matcha Latte Bliss,I have only tried the Matcha Latte & it‚Äôs fantastic; not too sweet & not powdery. I believe the matcha powder is not pre-mixed. Well done! Thanks. Atmosphere is cool & chill üòé
Japanese dining,"Tried the Kake Gohan, truffle fries and matcha latte. Salmon in the Kake Gohan is very fresh and truffle fries were generous in portion. Love the service and ambiance of the place. Service staff were friendly when asked to recommend menu to us."
cozy and good food!,"When I first step into the shop, was really pleasantly surprised by the cozy ambience. Ordered the oysters in 3 different flavour, scallops and grilled prawn. All the food was good but the grilled prawns really stood out for me the most. It was so fresh and peel really easily. The meat was succulent and tender. Thank you!!"
Fresh Seafood and Friendly Servers,"I came to dine-in for dinner and was really impressed by the food and service here! I ordered 3 different flavours of the baked oysters (mentaiko, garlic butter, Hokkaido cheese). My favourite was the mentaiko baked oyster. The oysters were extremely fresh, and the flavours of the mentaiko was nicely balanced such that the oyster still remains the star of the dish. I also had the 8pc black tiger prawns which were also very fresh, big and juicy as well! Left the restaurant a very satisfied customer:)"
Friendly Staff with Cozy Environment,Cozy environment with yummy and fresh food. The staff were also very helpful in recommending and explaining the food they served üëçüèª
Japanese food,"Ordered Kake Gohanm, truffle fries and matcha latte, it was delicious! It goes well together! The truffle fries was the highlight of our dinner, love that the portion is huge. Will definitely come back again!"
Hearty Japanese cafe food,"Had the matcha latte, aburiya grain bowl and truffle fries! The iced matcha latte was really smooth and was a good mix of matcha and milkiness<3 I noticed that all their drinks were personally brewed (even the roasting of coffee beans which smelled so good) and would definitely come back to try their coffee next time!

Their aburiya bowl had lots of ingredients (A4 wagyu, onsen egg, shimeiji mushrooms and pickled cucumbers) which complemented each other so well. Loved how tender the meat was! The truffle fries were so fragrant and topped with a good amount of cheese and truffle. Good food, nice ambience. would come back again!"
Satisfying lunch spot,"Had the Friends W Benefits grain bowl which consisted of wagyu beef, foie grad, onsen egg, mushrooms, and pickled cucumber. This dish was very hearty and portions were generous with meat. The flavours blended well together. Would recommend this!

Also had the truffle fries which was amazing! The truffle aioli was tangy and had the distinct truffle taste. It wasn't underwhelming yet wasn't too jelat as well. Would definitely come back just for this."
Great for dinner with friends or couples,"The staff were really friendly and were always readily to assist us. Recommend the tonkatsu sando and fried oysters! For someone who is very picky about oysters, the restaurant did a good job with it. It‚Äôs fresh without any fishy smell or taste. The sando was something new to me so it was a surprise to me, especially the sauce. Would love to try the lunch menu next time when I visit!"
Great for dinner!,"Service was efficient and the waiters were really friendly, we enjoyed our dinner here. Tried the cream buns, fried oysters and the pork Sando and the Sando was definitely the highlight for me. Definitely a must try when you visit, considering that you don‚Äôt see this at many Japanese food places, and I think they executed it super well."
Phenomenal Honey Toast!!,The honey toast was PHENOMENAL literally the best I've ever had!! It's freshly toasted before being served so just imagine crispy toast soaked in butter and honey and topped with light milky ice cream. Must try if you're there! The salmon rice bowl was pretty good as well. Nice ambience and attentive service too!
Great food!,"I had a great time at Pipes by Hattendo last weekend. I loved the angel hair pasta with mentaiko, the taste of the mentaiko was infused into the pasta making every bite very flavourful! They were very generous with the fish roe as well. The lemongrass chicken wings were really unique, with sweet and sour hints. I will definitely be back again for the amazing food and great service!"
Great dining experience!,"located near outram mrt, tried the negitoro and salmon kake gohan as well as the honey toast with soft serve. loved the creaminess of the rice when mixed with the tamago, and particularly enjoyed the negitoro one which was soft and melt-in-the mouth. the honey toast was great as well and the staff even tried to make sure we get it toasted as freshly as possible. hot fresh toast with icecream and honey was a delight great dining experience!"
Great Japanese Burger,"Had the Wagyu Beef burger and it is one of the best burgers I've had in Singapore! They are generous with the beef which was tender and the tamago adds a delicious sweet touch to the burger. I also had the lemongrass chicken wings which had a great aromatic taste and the aioli dipping was great too! Overall, an amazing dining experience and excellent service, would definitely come again!"
Best tonkatsu sando,Had tonkatsu sando as well as a iced matcha latte. Food is amazing and the tonkatsu is thick and juicy (REALLY GOOD). Great ambience to hang out with attentive staffs.
Great experience,Had the pork Katsu sando and Wagyu burger with foie gras. Both portions are generous and had a great mouthful. The ambience was nice and cozy. The staff was very welcoming!
A4 Wagyu & Tonkatsu Sando,"We ordered the A4 wagyu with foie gras. The beef was tender and juicy, and did not require much effort to chew! The sea salt complemented the char grilled meat really well and made it extra flavourful. The foie gras with berries compote then adds on an extra sweetness to the saltiness in your mouth, and takes you on a pleasant roller coaster ride. You get a variety of textures and flavours all in one dish!

The Tonkatsu Sando is not a typical sandwich that you can just whip up at home! My favourite part was how it was both juicy and crispy in the same bite. The thick juicy pork cutlet was fried and dressed in what I believe Tonkatsu sauce and mayo, which complemented the light but toasty bread really well. The bread was buttery and cheesy, and each bite leaves you wanting more!"
Classy quiet ambience for a great dinner,"A truly spectacular experience. The ambience was quiet and classy, great for a catch-up session with old friends or even dates.The delectable food makes this venue my new top choice for good quality food and a suitable environment to catch up with loved ones.

Had the DC Wagyu Cheese Burger as my main which Miso Glazed Wagyu Patty was extremely tender and made just right, along with the Furikake Fries with Truffle Aioli which tasted superb and they were super generous with the portion. They complemented each other very well. Will be great for sharing.

My friend had the Wagyu Sliders which could compete with my Wagyu cheese burger. Staff was very attentive, friendly and was always there to ensure we were having a great time. Some of the best service I've seen in a while. Will definitely be back for more soon :)"
Visited hattendo with my friends,Visited hattendo with my friends for the first time and was satisfied with the experience. We ordered an A5 wagyu steak and a tonkatsu sando. The steak was soft and buttery and was worth the price! It was the highlight of our experience:)
Weekday Dinner at PIPES,"We ordered the A4 Wagyu with Foie Gras and the beef was amazingly juicy and tender! It went really well with the salt & every bite was delicious!! Worth the price too seeing it was so well cooked. The sashimi platter we ordered was also very generous with its servings, served with fresh wasabi.

The highlight of the meal was the tonkatsu sando! It was so juicy and crispy and the bread was as tasty on its own. Would come back for this!"
Chill place to hangout with friends!,"Ordered mostly Western dishes and turned out to be great, and the Furikake fries with Truffle Alioli was really addictive!"
Great service and food,Had a good lunch here! Had the Angel's Only and Chirashizushi as well as an Iced Peach Tea. The Angel's Only was much lighter than expected but the flavour grows on to you the more you eat it. Should give the angel hair pasta a try if you enjoy lighter hints of mentaiko! The chirashizushi had pickled cucumbers which are a really good addition to your usual chirashi bowl! The slight crunch and tang to the cucumbers really added more flavour to the whole dish. Would definitely recommend it! The iced peach tea was a refreshing drink to have especially on a hot day!
Best pork katsu sandwhich,"Had the pork katsu sandwhich and the unagi. Both portions were generous and had a great mouthfeel. We were seated next to a coffee bean roaster which gave the resturant a great crisp smell. The staff was really friendly and took her time to give us reccomendation. Overall, a great experience, great food and great service."
"Best Burger, Great Service","I had a lovely lunch date and enjoyed the Pipes Burger and recommend it strongly. The juicy burger coupled with the decadent foie gras is extremely enjoyable and the patty was well seasoned. A generous sides of fries and garden salad w Japanese dressing paired the burger perfectly. The Angel Hair Pasta was pretty good as well.

The staff was extremely friendly and polite! The food arrived promptly within 5-10 mins and they even made sure to check that we were pleased with our food:)

I highly recommend getting the burger there and perhaps a few cream buns to go!"
Excellent food and ambience,"The service was friendly and eager to meet our needs, which we really appreciated. The food was delicious - I particularly enjoyed the ÂØøpasta, which came with generous amounts of ikura and sous vide chicken. The iced latte was also simple and aromatic - I saw them roasting coffee beans in-house , which was impressive for a restaurant with a full spread. I also enjoyed their cream buns - all the flavours are great!"
Writing this review now is making me extremely hungry,"I ordered the pork katsu sandwich, which turned out to be the best sandwich I've EVER had (even better than most I've eaten in Japan). The bread was slathered with lots of butter and had a great mouth feel. The star of the show is of course the pork katsu, which was THICC and very tender/marbly for pork. It came with an appetizing mustard-based sauce which had me (almost) licking the plates. $20++ for a sandwich is not cheap BUT the portion was generous and it was totally worth it! I would really go back again just for this sandwich."
"Friendly staff, relaxing atmosphere & good food",The staff was really friendly and the ambiance was relaxing and nice. Perfect for relaxing and winding down in the evening.
Good food and convenient location,"Atmosphere of the izakaya was good for dinner and is located really near outram park. Food was good as well, the wagyu cheeseburger was the highlight with a fluffy bun and flavorful patty and truffle slices."
Fun and relaxing Japanese dining,"Really chill dining concept with a very nice selection of food. High quality ingredients and very delicious food. Only reason why I wouldn't rate higher is that the food is on the pricier side and the beef in my gyu katsu sando was cooked well done, but I think this was a one-time thing as the waitress mentioned that they usually prepare it medium rare. It still tasted fantastic though, which definitely says something."
Wagyu Beef Bowl,"I visited on a weekday, during lunch hours, and the restaurant was not too crowded. The ambience was good, and they serve Japanese-Western fusion food. I ordered the Friends W Benefits Grain Bowl, which is their char grilled A4 wagyu beef bowl, and it was really delicious! For fans of wagyu beef and fusion food, I highly recommend giving this restaurant a try and trying out the beef bowl. The service at this restaurant was really good as well so I had a pleasant dining experience."
Quaint Japanese Cafe near Outram Park,"Having tried quite a number of HATTENDO's desserts from Sushiro (highly recommend their pudding), I came in with pretty high expectations for their dinner selection. Glad to say they were met with their use of high quality ingredients and pleasant dining atmosphere. PIPES is located right outside Outram Park MRT, directly below DORSET hotel. My partner and I tried their Aburi A4 Wagyu Beef with Onsen dip with rice and their wagyu sando, for drinks we tried their matcha latte and their mocktail - Passionate (passion fruit and apple soda). The wagyu beef was delicious and extremely tender, I highly recommend this dish if you're a fan of beef. The beef sando made for a lovely snack, however it was slightly overcooked and a little tough. Honestly wouldn't have noticed it if my partner didn't point this out to me because overall the taste was not dampened by this.I can see myself coming back with friends for dessert or a quick tea time, they have a wide selection of coffee and their matcha latte was delicious. The food does fall on the pricey-side (the beef sando was $24 while the wagyu aburi was $22 for 120g of beef), but you pay for the quality."
Good food and atmosphere,"Located conveniently outside Outram Park station, PIPES by Hattendo is a great place to visit for a casual and delicious lunch. I had their ‚ÄòFriends with benefits‚Äô grain bowl, which came with a generous serving of A4 Wagyu beef and foie gras. The wagyu was well seasoned and cooked to perfection. I also recommend getting a cup of coffee while you enjoy the great atmosphere!"
Yummy japanese-fusion food,"Hattendo always had a special place in my heart (or tummy) with their signature cream buns, and I was really sad when their outlet at Tanjong Pagar MRT closed. Little did I know that they actually re-opened their cafe, this time right beside Outram Park MRT, with a new concept this time. Gone are the days of Hattendo the signature cream bun shop; they've now rebranded as PIPES by Hattendo, a Japanese fusion style cafe serving specialty coffee and alcohol.

I got myself the Aburiya A4 Wagyu beef burger ($19.90), which came with generous slices of beef and guacamole. There was even a slab of tamagoyaki tucked secretly in the burger as well. The burger was pretty good, and it played well to the japanese-fusion tune of the cafe.

For sides, I got the Hiroshima fried oysters ($16), which were served with tartar sauce. I love oysters so I might be slightly biased, but they were pretty darn delicious.

Finally to wash down the meal, I had a nice hot cup of matcha latte ($6). I've always felt that many cafes made their matcha latte unnecessarily sweet, but PIPES' matcha latte hit the spot for me.

Overall, I was pretty impressed by the cafe. Would definitely visit again next time! (All prices excl. GST and svc charge)"
Freshest plate of Sashimi. Super good beef,"I love the atmosphere. Went in the evening and was treated to a absolutely delicious moriawase sashimi platter. Had authentic wasabi as well. On top of that, we ordered the Wagyu Slider-absolutely worth the price and super filling."
"Delicious food, top notch service","Wonderful cafe with amazing vibes. Went in the late morning for brunch and the lighting Is really nice, feels like you're in a cafe overseas. Had the pastas which were both flavourful and generous in portion. I really liked the WTFat pasta which was super tasty. The pork belly was really succulent. Also tried the cream buns (not pictured) which are delicious. They're not like regular cream buns, these buns are incredibly soft and the filling is super light. Perfect as an after meal dessert that isn't too heavy. The coffees were also really nice, smooth brew!"
Aburiya Burger and Custard Cream Bun,"On a nice Sunday I came here to try the Aburiya burger and the HIGHLY RAVED custard cream bun! It sure didn‚Äôt disappoint because the variety here is unique. It doesn‚Äôt just pride itself for its mains, but also the assortment of desserts here which has distinct tastes of Japan. The Aburiya burger was a fusion Japanese x western twist, with guacamole paired with tamago and sliced A4 Wagyu beef. The burst of flavour in each mouth was an accompaniment of juiciness and a tinge of sweetness, really lovely. The cream bun is the star of the show for me, with its fluffiness and lightness, a must try when you visit!"
Good Food,"This place has a convenient location being located next to Outram MRT. Got to try the Friends with Benefits rice bowl which had many slices of succulent wagyu beef and foie gras. Coupled with some greens, it was delicious and well-balanced dish. Would recommend this dish!"
Great little cafe and bar,"Had the Aburiya A4 Wagyu Beef Burger and the Costa Rica Filter Coffee. The burger comes with a light fluffy burger bun that was nicely seared and surprisingly chewy. The sweet omelette inside the burger went well with the Wagyu, and the Wagyu itself was juicy and tender. Sides includes fries and salad, fries were lightly salted but not very crispy. Salad was great, with Japanese sesame sauce that was salty and sweet instead of the more conventional Thousand Island or Ranch, which makes the salad a lot more savoury. The coffee was not bitter at all, very smooth and aromatic with a slightly acidic aftertaste. All in all a good meal."
Good Food,A restaurant with a chic and laid-back atmosphere. Ordered the wagyu beef burger; it came with a good portion of fries and loved the addition of the guacamole in the burger. The service was okay with food being served at an adequate speed. It is located next to the MRT which makes it a convenient location to visit.
Fresh and Authentic Japanese Flavours,"The welcoming attitude of the staff and the cozy ambience of the establishment meant that upon stepping in, any diner would instantly feel relaxed and ready to enjoy their meal. The food was incredible with my favorite being the Moriwase Platter(2¬¨3 pax). Every slice of sashimi tasted like it was fresh from the ocean. My partner's favourite was the Gyu Katso Sando. The beef was a little hard to chew but other than that, the combination of the meat, bread and sauce was an enjoyable combination. Would definitely visit again!"
Chic Japanese bistro with delicious food,"Dropped by here for dinner with my sister recently and we fell in love with the food! There was a wide selection of food and I ordered the Tonkatsu Sando and omg it was perfect; the pork cutlet was thick and juicy (just look at the pictures!) and the bread had the right amount of butter.

My sister chose the DC Wagyu Cheese Burger which was so filling and delicious with the Wagyu patty, foie gras and truffle slices. Both portions were extremely generous and we ended up sharing both dishes haha

The service was impeccable (didn‚Äôt get our server‚Äôs name but he‚Äôs so friendly and speaks Cantonese!) and the atmosphere so classy and chic :))"
Cozy Drinks with Authentic Japanese Food,"PIPES offers more than just desserts. Although coming from a franchise that sells pudding and cream puffs, I was pleasantly surprised by their selection of alcohol and wide array of Japanese cuisine. I personally ordered a tuna rice bowl and yakionigiri. The tuna was really fresh, brought out by the taste of the negi and fresh egg yolk. The yakionigiri was also perfectly seasoned with great taste when eaten with pickled daikon.

Overall, the place was also really pleasant with nice ambiance. Warm lighting and chic decor. The staff was also really friendly and nice in recommending food and great service. Will definitely visit anytime."
Loved it!,"First time here! Tried the Aburiya bowl and the Hokkaido soft serve. Got to say that the Hokkaido soft serve was a dream that transported me back to japan, with the Ballance of creaminess and milkiness, paired with some biscuits at the end of the cone for an extra crunch. Got to give it to the uniqueness of how the Wagyu beef was thinly cut and roasted, a great accompaniment with the glaze of the rice. Truly elevated the tastes! Very convenient to the mrt too :) loved it here."
Convenient location and great atmosphere,"Lovely service, w very friendly and they attended to my needs efficiently. The bun of the burger I ordered was crispy and yummy, really addictive. The beef was tender and juicy, will a slice of cheese really completedy meal. Do come and try it yourself !!"
Great food with Great Service,"The venue has such a great selection of both alcohol and food. Was really surprised to learn that it was from the same franchise that served only dessert. The venue had a very nice ambiance that uses warm lighting and gives such cozy environment.

The restaurant offers a wide variety of both liquor and food. I personally selected the wagyu slices with a kahlua. It was a really pleasant experience, with the great service.

I also ordered their signature pudding for dessert, which was really rich and creamy. Would definitely recommend this place to other."
Food served that has great attention to details,"The place is very convenient, just beside the Outram park station. The place is cosy and the food is perfect! The Honey toast with soft serve was the best. All the Sandos were good and were perfect for 4 pax. Overall very good food and will definitely come back for more!"
If you‚Äôre looking for a place to dine,"If you‚Äôre looking for a chill and cosy cafe that serves up quality food, you can find it at Pipes by Hattendo.

I really enjoyed the Honey Toast with Soft Serve, but I recommend sharing it as the portion‚Äôs quite large. I love how they added berries around the dish to balance the sweetness with some tartness. Overall a very satisfying meal!"
Best Honey Toast!!,"Came by with a few friends for a quiet evening catch-up at this lovely little Japanese cafe. We were pleasantly surprised by the dishes that were served up, each were quality and amazing on their own. But my favourite was definitely the Honey Toast with Soft Serve ($24)! It‚Äôs a huge serving, and I recommend sharing it with a few others! The exterior of the toast was crispy but the inside was light and fluffy (and wonderfully sweet thanks to the honey). The cold soft serve complemented the warm toast so well, and I love the milkyness of the ice cream.

I would also recommend the Tonkatsu Sando ‚Äî bread had a nice buttery aroma and a crispy texture, and the tokatsu was juicy and well-seasoned.

Pipes by Hattendo is very conveniently located outside the exit of Outram Park MRT and there‚Äôs shelter all the way (big plus). Will come by again for their desserts!"
GET THE HONEY TOAST,"My friends and I had the 1. Tonkatsu Sando 2. Gyukatsu Sando 3. Salmon Ikura Kake Gohan 4. Oysters and 5. Honey Toast
I had the fresh natural oyster and it was big and fresh! Really love the sandos, the toast was buttery and lightly crispy. and there was a generous portion of meat. The only feedback I would have is that the gyukatsu was slightly tough. But my friend who is a fan of well done meat loved it!
The must order dish for me was the Honey Toast! Creamy soft serve paired with a warm chewy shokupan. The insides of the shokupan were stretchy and had honey. Tarty berry jam was also drizzled around the toast which goes so well with the creamy soft serve :)"
Love the food,Visited PIPES for lunch and had their friends with benefit rice bowl. The combination of beef and foie gras was deliciously delightful and the atmosphere complemented the dining experience. I also got the cream puffs and dark roasted iced latte which definitely did not disappoint!
Good coffee and cream buns,The iced latte was really good. The taste was really rich and not acidic at all. The cream buns really lived up to the reputation as well. The custard bun is my fave. The custard filling could possibly be one of the best I have tried so far. If you‚Äôre a fan of custard you gotta try the custard bun here.
Highly Recommended Japanese Desserts,"Really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere here at Hattendo last weekend with a friend. The chill and cosy atmosphere as well as the extremely friendly staff made the experience so much better. We really enjoyed the cream buns, honey toast, and matcha lattes. Highly recommend going!"
Great place for dates!,"PIPES by Hattendo - Review
PIPES by Hattendo is located right outside Exit H of Outram Park MRT, which makes it really convenient. They had a glass exterior, and the interior was decorated with beautiful hanging lights and some sofa seats near the window, which made it really insta-worthy and perfect for a date. The place was also really spacious and comfortable.
They have different menus for lunch, dinner, takeaways, alcohol and coffee. I went there in the afternoon and tried their desserts, which are really amazing! The Cream Bun Set ($12.50) consists of five flavours: Custard, Whipped Cream, Matcha, Chocolate and Azuki. We also got the Amaou Cream Bun ($4) because of the cute strawberry packaging! The bun had a really soft texture that really melts in your mouth when you bite into it, and the burst of cream in your mouth is so refreshing, especially since it was chilled. The custard tasted light and not overpowering, with a really smooth texture that was of just the right viscosity - not too thick, not too liquid. The strawberry bun had cream with strawberry jam, and the two complemented each other really well - the jam had a sweet taste while the cream's lightness helped to bring out a different dimension. I don't know how to describe it well but I loved it. The chocolate cream was really light too, though as a personal preference I would have preferred the chocolate to be stronger. The azuki bun was mostly filled with cream, and as someone who likes red bean I would have enjoyed it even more if I could taste the red beans. Unfortunately, I did not try the matcha and whipped cream ones.
The Yuzu Panna Cotta ($5) was my absolute favourite. There was yuzu jelly on top of the pudding. The jelly melts with a burst of fragrant and sweet yuzu juice. The panna cotta was not too overpowering and the texture was soft. Pair the yuzu jelly with the panna cotta and wow, it's so perfect. I personally loved the jelly even more than the panna cotta itself!
The Honey Toast with Soft Serve ($24) looked so appealing on the menu, we had to give it a try. And it did not disappoint. They carved the thick toast out so that it formed a cute square shell, which kept it neat when the ice cream started melting. They filled it with honey-drizzled toast, and added soft serve on the top. You could add $2 for an espresso soft serve, but we went with the milk one. The white rounded plate was decorated with some jam and granola. It was so beautiful! And not only was it beautiful, it tasted really good too. I loved the honey-drizzled toast, the honey was so fragrant and the sweetness of the honey complemented well with the savoury butter of the toast. The ice cream was good too, just the right texture. There were berries with the jam on the plate which went well with the plain crusts of bread.
To wash down all that sweetness, we had the Hot Matcha Latte ($6). The latte art was beautiful, and the authentic taste of matcha was wonderful - fragrant yet not too bitter.
At the end of the day, we were even more pleasantly surprised to find that there was no additional GST and service charge.
Highly recommend this place for any dates or just a hangout with your friends! :)"
"Feels like Japan, but in Singapore","Had dinner at this fusion bistro tucked at the fringe of the CBD after work the other day. The vibe reminded me pretty much of those hipster cafes in the streets of Japan.

Great service! We are given complimentary nuts that were apparently freshly roasted in store.

Had their Chestnut Pork Belly, Herbs Chicken Thigh, and mini Salmon Don. The meat were savoury and flavourful. Chicken was slightly on the salty side but went really well with rice. Their Salmon Don came with a raw egg yolk that added an additional flavour profile to the rice. Really tasty! I will recommend to finish your meal with their Honey Toast which is great for sharing!

Overall, the food are slightly on the pricey side but they made up with fresh ingredients and great flavours!"
Love the food!,"I tried their fresh oysters in 3 different flavours - natural, Australia lime caviar and ikura infused, really fresh and plump! Recommended to try it when you visit the restaurant.

For the mains, I ordered their chestnut pork belly and herbs chicken thigh. Meat were flavourful and tender. Portions could be bigger for the price though.

Their Honey Toast with soft serve is da BOMB! Two person can share a toast cos it‚Äôs really filling for one person to finish everything.

Overall, pleasant dining experience!"
Treats and sweets,"Was extremely excited to give Pipes by Hattendo a try as I‚Äôve yet to experience dining there. We began with the Eihire with Yuzu Mayo which is my personal favourite as the flesh was tender, adequately charred and yet not too dried. The Salmon, Scallop, Clams in sake broth and salt baked octopus followed after which was an extreme delight as well. Lastly we ordered Matcha latte and Hattendo cream buns to enjoy the end of our dinner. Overall an appetising dinner experience and would love to be back again."
Good food good service,The service staff were really attentive and friendly from the start. Recommended for us to try the wagyu beef which was a 10/10 recommendation. Restaurant is also conveniently located right outside of the MRT Station. Will definitely pop by again when in the area.
"Good food, good service, good experience","My first time visiting PIPES - overall really enjoyed myself there. I had the salt baked octopus, asari clams with sake broth, sashimi and ehire, and none of the dishes disappoint. I was really pleased with the quality of the sashimi as they were extremely fresh and it came in such a huge portion. The asari clams are not only delicious but they pair wonderfully with all the dishes on the table. And finally, you have to get the Hattendo cream buns to finish the meal with."
Tasty food and great service crew,"They had a very interesting menu so we ordered quite a few items to try. The ones that I highly recommend are the Tonkotsu Toast (very flavourful, tonkotsu was cooked well, and the toast was delicious and did not get very soggy despite how slowly we were eating it) and the wagyu beef with onsen dip (one of their star items for good reason, beef was cooked well). We also tried their pork belly which was quite good, but the fat was not as well rendered as I would have hoped. We tried their squid too which was delicious flavour-wise, but was a little on the rubbery side.

Also, I have to add that the service crew was spectacular. John (I think this is how to spell it) was very friendly and attentive and helpful too in terms of explaining the menu and giving recommendations.

The place seem to place a big focus on coffee and desserts as well. Will definitely be back to try more!"
Delicious food,I ordered the Aburiya A4 Wagyu Beef Burger and it surely did not disappoint. The beef is thinly sliced to perfection such that each bite provided just the right amount of taste without being too overpowering or underwhelming. The cafe have a very zen atmosphere which makes it a perfect place to relax and unwind.
Loved the coffee scent!,"Loved the modern, relaxing vibes at the cafe, especially the scent of freshly ground coffee. It was also a convenient and accessible spot as it is situated right beside Outram Park MRT.

We ordered the PIPES Burger and Wagyu Burger, both of which are very unique. The meat was very moist and the amount of sauce was just right. Really loved their fluffy, buttered toasted buns, which added another layer of richness to the burger. Their tamago was well done, adding a good complement of sweetness to the otherwise savoury burger. They serve complimentary black coffee here in large cups, which was a pleasant surprise!

We also tried the Matcha and Chocolate cream buns, which came with generous, overflowing amount of cream fillings. The buns were really soft and fluffy as well.

The staff who directly served us throughout our meal (a Japanese man and a young pretty lady) were friendly and courteous, making it a great experience. The only drawback was my encounter with an older lady (who seemed to be the manager) - her attitude towards her customers was rather unsatisfactory, and she called for her colleague in a pretty rude manner. Hopefully she would improve on her service and that would definitely make me very willing to return!"
Recommended place to try,"The service was great, everyone was very attentive and jovial. Food was excellent and very appetising. The cream puff should not be given a miss, one would think that the cream puff will be heavy but no they are light and easy on the stomach"
Amazing cream buns,"Loved their cream buns, tried the original and matcha and was pleasantly surprised that they were so soft and light. Their mains were generously portioned and plated very nicely as well. Top notch customer service! Staff were really attentive and friendly."
Worth a try!,I ordered the Friends w Benefits rice bowl and they were very generous with their wagyu beef! The truffle fries were flavourful and their iced latte was worth its price too!
Nice cafe to chill,Had the Pink Slime rice bowl and it was delicious! Truffle fries and iced latte were really nice too.
Authentic Tasty Japanese food,"Visited PIPES for dinner and ordered their mini salmon don as my main and their mixed soft-serve as my dessert. Pleased with the quality of the food especially the salmon sashimi - they were extremely fresh and pretty huge!! For the soft-serve, the black sesame was very rich - would recommend getting the mixed one as it was just nice! there were also crunchy things in the soft-serve that complemented the taste. Loved the ambience - very Japanese feels ‚ó°Ãà price is on the higher side though! would return to try their sake :D"
Great ambience and food!,Great service and experience with quality food! First time trying the Tonkatsu Sando served with pork collar cutlet and it was amazingly delicious. Ended off well with a dessert called Amaou Cream Pudding. Would definitely come back again highly recommended!
Amazing atmosphere and food!,"Everything was hands down delicious, the only thing i was disappointed was that we didn‚Äôt come earlier to try the Gyukatsu (which I heard great things about). Nonetheless, their truffle fries portion was very generous. My favourite dish has to be the salmon sashimi! It was super fresh and the wasabi that came along with it was of premium quality"
Tasty mains!,The salmon was the highlight of my meal. Seasoned really well and was really a sumptuous meal. Comes with a bowl of rice and soup too which were great complements to the fish! The staff provided great service for me and were patient and attentive. Good experience!
Great experience!,"Had this dessert and as you can see it's a very generous portion! Loved the soft serve icecream going together with the toppings! The experience was also great as the staff were attentive, patient and friendly!!"
Conveniently located cafe with great mains,"Mains here are amazing. Had the Pipes Burger, which had delicious brioche bund and a thick slab of foie gras. Their WTFat fusion pasta is also a standout with very tender chestnut pork belly."
Pipes by Hattendo,"A cozy and relaxing place serving Japanese fusion food which offers good range of dishes. Tried the freshly air-flown oysters platter from Hiroshima, they have natural fresh taste finishes and Aburiya Wagyu beef with onsen dip. Surprise to be able to get one of the best coffee to go with their Hattendo red bean buns. Everything was good!"
Great food n Friendly Staff,Ordered the Aburiya Wagyu Beef with Onsen Dip. The beef goes perfectly well with the onsen dip and a tiny bit of salt. Great ambience and friendly staff too. 10/10 would visit again.
Delicious Jap food and great service,"Enjoyed the fresh, thick slices of salmon & scallop sashimi! I also tried the wagyu beef slices with onsen egg dip which made for a great appetizer. Staff were friendly & attentive, and the restaurant has a nice cozy ambience. Highly recommend for a dinner date or night out."
Truffle fries stole the show!,"Truffle fries stole the show!
Was amazed by the generous portion of the fries and also the bits of truffle that came along with it. The truffle mayo sauce was generously drizzled with truffle oil! The sashimi was great too, but perhaps can be more thickly sliced. Would definitely come back here to try their A5 gyukatsu sandwich!"
AMAZING Japanese-fusion cuisine,"I‚Äôm a huge fan of Japanese-fusion, and PIPES really hit the spot for me. Not only was there excellent service, the menu items were really thoughtfully put together - we tried the PIPES burger and the WTFat pasta and both were so satisfying to finish."
Fusion Japanese Hangout with great food and service!,"Cosy place to unwind with amazing great food. Eihire (grilled stingray fin served with shichimi yuzu mayo) paired well with Hyakumoku Junmai Daiginjo sake. Would highly recommend Aburiya Wagyu Beef with Onsen Dip where the beef was tender and marvelously tasty. Signature Hattendo cream buns with full bodied coffee gave a memorable finishing to the meal.

Staff by the name John, was friendly and unassuming gave very good introduction and recommendation to the dishes available. Overall dining experience was excellent! Thumbs up!!!"
High quality food!,"Cosy spot with great-tasting food! Attentive staff made the whole experience very memorable. Highly recommend the aburiya wagyu beef with onsen dip as well as the soft-serve ice cream to round off the meal. Slightly on the pricier side but for the quality of food, it is justifiable."
Lunch,"I had the unagi rice bowl for lunch, the unagi is really fresh and the shimeiji mushroom really goes well in the dish! I personally like it a lot. Gotten the chocolate cream bun and kochi yuzu pana cotta as my dessert, the bread is so soft and the chocolate filling tastes just right. The yuzu pana cotta the pudding taste is just nice and not overwhelming while the yuzu has a refreshing taste to it.

And lastly! Their service is extremely good. Keep it up!"
Lunch,"I ordered a chirashizushi and the salmon and tuna tasted really fresh. I really liked the Ikura and it complemented well with the other ingredients. For dessert, I had a Hokkaido soft serve which tasted amazing and the biscuit that came with it was yummy as well. The service and ambience is good."
Casual Japanese joint,The ‚Äòfriends with benefits‚Äô rice bowl is a must try! Beef with foie gras can never go wrong and this is just a bowl of goodness. Do also try their famous cream buns! Reservations recommended for peak hours
Tantalising Japanese fusion,tantalising Japanese-fusion food and signature soft serves that will be sure to melt your tastebuds ahead.
Tasty Japanese food,"Located at the doorstep of Outram MRT station, this outlet serves very tasty Japanese food. Ordered Chirashizushi and it was tasty with fresh salmon and tuna slices! Taste it for yourself! Don‚Äôt forget their signature cream puffs and soft serves too!"
Fantastic menu,"A terrific food-motivated lunch meeting at Hattendo Singapore. Totally enjoyed the deliciously tender Char-grilled A4 Wagyu topped with palate-melting foie gras and that smooth onsen egg. An absolute luxury experience all in a bowl.

All the while my guest indulged himself in the twenty-hours sou vide chestnut pork belly complimented with aroma-pampering truffle slices. One flavour bursting meal.

This is indeed the culinary paradise of ÂÖ´Â§©Â†Ç"
Excellent food and coffee for a cafe!,Tried almost all the food. Very tasty. Drinks good too. And not expensive. Service good too. Just limited seating.
Simple but nice food,"This is one of many, many cafes and restaurants in Singapore. Every mall had an array of options and we stopped at this one. The staff were very pleasant and the choice of food was good and very tasty. NO issues. I would recommend it for a quick bite or something more substantial."
Scrumptious burger,"After trying their signature light, fluffy cream bun, we decided to try their fish burger from the lunch menu. The fish was fresh and fried to perfection - crispy and light. The home-made sauces complement the tempura well, providing a well-balanced and refreshing flavour. Likewise for its truffle fries, which remained crispy after 30mins. Not too heavy and made a great meal in the middle of the day."
"Come if you like soft, fluffy buns with creamy fillings","I've tried buns from Hattendo three times now. Servers are always polite.

The classic 5 flavours (chocolate, cream, custard, azuki, matcha) are really delicious. The bread is soft, and the fillings really excel - very creamy, flavourful, superb when the bun is chilled. Really satisfying.

Please note that these are fluffy cream buns. Some people don't like those because they prefer dense cakey bread, but that's not a problem of the product, that's personal preference. Have reasonable expectations and judge these buns for what they are!

I've also tried two seasonal flavours, one was a jam (possibly yuzu or apricot jam? I don't remember any more) and recently marron (chestnut) at their autumn popup store. The chestnut flavour is not pronounced, just tastes sweet rather than chestnut. Both were alright, but a bit disappointing, I would recommend the normal flavours instead.

I have also tried one of the coffees, I think the latte, and that was decent as well. Next time I hope to try the melon buns."
Hamburger bun,"After seeing the review on TripAdvisor and the high praise we sought out this cafe to try these ‚Äúinfamous‚Äù buns. They had all the classic flavors previously mentioned. We tried custard, whipped cream, and chocolate with a coffee. When we opened the wrapper we found what humorously to Americans is just a hamburger bun. Almost looked like a McDonald‚Äôs to be honest. Tasted like a plain burger bun too just very soft. The custard is mild and barely sweet. I couldn‚Äôt finish more than one. The bread was so filling. Interesting for a treat but not up to the hype."
cute little taste of japan,"this cafe is right next to japan rail cafe at tanjong pagar and it‚Äôs famous for its cream buns which are delicious and totally affordable, and come in a range of flavours - i tried the chocolate but the recommended one is the cream. i‚Äôve also come here multiple times for lunch - their burger sets are very affordable for the CBD area and include coffee, truffle fries and the burger itself. the fries are delicious!! and i often have cravings for them. wan served me and he‚Äôs always a pleasure to talk to even though i haven‚Äôt been back in a while. very friendly guy! hope business is going good!"
Nice Japanese cream bun cafe,"Nice little dessert outlet with great cream buns... Tried the red bean, macha, and hazenut coffee. Not too bad. Good place for chit-chat too."
decent lunch but not the hand drip coffee,"15$ is already max for a „Çµ„É©„É™„Éº„Éû„É≥ lunch. burgers choice i tried all. da best is namban burger. i tried with upgraded premium coffee, hand dripped coffee. not worth da upgrade at extra 2$. they could addon 1$ for a cream bun but they chose not to. what a shame"
Weird tasting Bun,"Custard cream bun was weird. The cream was light and fluffy but a really weird Combi w the bread. Bread tasted like over-soft airline bread. Taste of bread was Weird too, doesn't complement the cream. Texture of bread wasn't nice and sticks to ur teeth or mouth. Over priced place which charges 1.00 for ice water."
Japanese Cafes at its Finest,"Hattendo Cafe is a Japanese style cafe located in Tanjong Pagar, the center of Singapore's financial district. Despite its busy, metropolitan surroundings, Hattendo Cafe offers a relaxing environment best suited for a meet up with friends or a quick, relaxing escape session from daily life. The cafe specializes in cream buns and also serves coffee and burgers. Everything is homemade- in fact, there is one section of the cafe that allows customers to experience the pastry's baking process. One feature that I would like to note is the making of the cream puff's cream/paste, In addition, the cafe has free wifi and has excellent service.

I would like to praise Kurniawan, one of the cafe's employees, for providing fantastic customer service along with a friendly, helpful attitude. In my years of restaurant reviewing and cafe-hopping, I have rarely seen an employee with as positive of a demeanour of Kurniawan's.

While at Hattendo Cafe, I had the Long Black (Coffee) as well as the ice late. Both drinks were wonderful and were reasonably priced, especially for such a central location such as Tanjong Pagar. I would highly recommend Hattendo Cafe to everyone. I will surely come back again and I look forward to my next visit."
Newer offerings get my vote,Long queues formed outside this famous snack chain from Japan when it first opened here but their latest offerings of melon buns and muffins are a lot better than their original buns.
Delightfully Yummy,"dropped by this place for a quick snack on way home - its location is great - just by the MRT station. being our first time there, we asked quite a few questions about the various fillings (level of sweetness) before making up our minds. the staff (didn't get his name) was very patient and made recommendations. He was the only person manning the counter at 6plus pm. he was efficient and polite. great service and overall the bun was nice and went well with black tea."
Afternoon tea,"Surprisely for a Sunday afternoon, the place was pretty crowded. The female manning the cashier was working half heartedly. One could see that she had already to leave as her friends were waiting for her to knock off from work. She kept interrupting the staff in the kitchen, whom one could see having problems keeping an eye on the stove through the open kitchen. One could not help but notice that he had thrown what was on the pan to the bin. For an order of french toast, I had waited almost 30 minutes for it.

French Toast($9.00)
Selected custard bun for the dish, which was pan fried with slightly top and bottom. It was served with pieces of fruit such as lemon, kiwi, blue berries, orange and strawberries, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream by the side. The caramelised crust of the bun gave a different feel to the bun.

Topup $2.50 for a cup of hot tea to go with it."
Bread buns filled with cream or custard,"These bread buns are filled with a range of plain or flavoured cream /custard. You have a choice of a soft bun or the melon version which is meant to have a crispy top (those familiar with bolo buns from Chinese style bakeries will know all about this).

On this visit we had the soft bun version of the original cream and red bean cream. The filling was not Tok sweet which is a plus point.

We had a good coffee to go with our little snack. Service is friendly and efficient.

If you prefer the traditional choux pastry style cream puffs, these might not be for you."
Nice cafe for custard bun,"This cafe is in Tanjong Pagar Centre, and opposite the Japan Rail Centre. There is custard, melon, matcha, azuki beans and chocolate filled buns. Cosy place for a stop"
