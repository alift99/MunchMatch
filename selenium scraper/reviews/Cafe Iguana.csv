Great place!,Love the margaritas! The food was super delicious. Great place to hang out with friends & family. Will definitely be back again!
Don't do it,"Expensive, bad, and inaccurate descriptions on the menu so you dont even know what you are ordering. You will leave feeling sad. :("
Awesome,Great food and ambience. We enjoyed ourselves. We will come back again. It was our wedding anniversary and it was also our first time to Cafe Iguana
Service Quality,Staff ought to learn how to talk to customers. Irtitation clearly shown in voice is not appreciated not accepted. Customers are not all idoits... impatience is a problem.
Nachos and margaritas - enough said.,"I have been here a number of times over the years and it has never failed to disappoint. The house margaritas are awesome and, if you are there for happy hours, quite reasonably priced.
The nachos are nothing like we get in Australia, but I am celebrating the difference :) If I wanted nachos like back home then I would have stayed at home. These are on a bed of rice and the corn chips are really thick and puffy, and the toppings are just right.
You can order using the QR code on each table, or you can still get the good old physical menu in hand.
I always visit cafe Iguana and will continue to do so."
Great bar/restaurant friendly staff,Staff were exceptionally friendly even near closing time. We had some appetisers which were very tasty. Beers and wine excellent!
Best nachos and margarita ever!,"Visited this place with my friends over the weekend. We had the best margarita and nachos! Great service as well, shout out to James who was was super flexible and managed to bring more nachos, although kitchen was closed! Highly recommended!!"
Extremely bad food. Very different from previous years and this is not worth it. Do not visit this restaurant,"Do not visit cafe iguana. Over spend over not much worth on the food. Veggie bowl, in fact was terrible. The portion as well as quality of food has deteriorated. Pls do not waste your time here. You will find paying a lot more for the food you get. Better off trying a different Mexican restaurant. This used to be good. Not anymore."
Bit of a climb down…,"Took some overseas guests since we had a good impression of the place earlier. Total damper - overworked staff, ordering chaos, slow and missed deliveries. Fans not working well. Taking it off the list from now."
not recommended,"Good store decoration. good location. but for this quality of food, it's on the expensive side. Each dish costs above 20 but what they served are like 2 chicken wing, some curry puff and bite size taco. It's just very unsatisfying to eat in this restaurant."
Loved the Fajitas! Beef was so fresh and well cooked!,"Great mexican food to sort you and your friends out! Funky style bar and mexican food, plenty of options, large menu, over looking Clarke Quay.

I had the beef fajitas, which is a rather large portion for one person, but i finished it, and it was YUM! Very nice dish, fresh, and happy with the price and overall qualtiy.

Staff were friendly and helpful, beer was cold, and both inside and outside dining areas.
Rather warm inside, no A/C, but plenty of fans to cool you down.

Well priced dishes, beers, and you can order from the QR code on the table which is handy! Thanks!"
"Fresh, zesty and delicious! Excellent Mexican!","Totally random drop in - best Mexican we’ve ever had hands down! Simple fair, but fresh. zesty and delicious! On the spendy side, but the location and view is an obvious factor. A great way to finish a busy day in Singers."
Excellent Mexican cuisine at Clarke Quay,"This place has an excellent location advantage right on the Clarke Quay riverfront.
The food is also very good especially the Nachos with accompaniments and the Quesadillas. Very good options of vegetarian menu is available.
The churros is not to be missed. The service is also very good and staff very attentive. Would like to mention the lady Jascylene, who was very patient and serving us with a smile."
Great Mexican Fare,We had a super Mexican meal at this place. Although it was too warm for a lunch outing but the meal was well worth it. The chimichangas and the nachos flight was terrific. Only thing is the server should inform about the portion size which is too big and we had a lot of leftover. Well priced too.
"AVOID, bad service, very ordinary food and low value","went on a saturday afternoon, the place was ¾ empty. It took about 5 minutes to get someone to come to our table with menus and I had to get up to go get a waitress to take our order (she ignored us) and I ended up asking someone else to take our order. We had
Tomato rellenos (stuffed peppers) that were bland no taste and were small $12
fried calamari that tasted like the frozen kind from the store $10
lime juice $7.00
and cranberry juice $7.00

what a waste of money. will never go there again."
Great decor and location,Sat on Clarke Quay on the quieter side with good views. Lots of seating combinations and themed really well. Food and drinks good
Nice food and margarita’s,Nice food and ambiance. Margarita’s we’re yummy with plenty of choices I. Flavours. Mango one was awesome. Food quality was great. Ambiance was fun and lively. Price a bit on the high side. Staff was helpful and attentive. Nice place overall and would come back.
amazingly horrendous service,"Food and drinks are fine though pricey for what they are. Service is appalling.

We specifically asked about each dish before ordering whether or not it contained cheese. The menu listed various ingredients but did not say they contained cheese. We were assured by a waiter that our choices did not. Both of our dishes arrived... containing cheese. We only found out after taking a bite as it was a deep fried item where you can't see the insides.

When we politely asked about this, the new waiter's first response was, ""Of course this contains cheese, how can you not know that?"" When told that we had asked before ordering, the next response was, ""Who did you ask?"" Final response was, ""I can redo one of these without cheese but you have to eat the other one."" Arrogance on full display.

What if we had been allergic and had suffered a medical event?

Not one apology and of course, we were charged full price for everything. Anywhere else, they would have apologized, not forced us to swallow something we did not order and not charged us for their mistake. Our friends had ordered many other dishes and plenty of booze so it's not like they weren't making money.

Surprised at the terrible experience as they are part of the same company as Brewerkz, where I have been a happy regular for at least 15 years."
Great food,"The fajitas really good, taco meatless option amazing, guacamole too good, I mean there was nothing to not like there or we were just too hungry !!!! Good option for vegetarians. Loved the free flowing nachos and all the dips"
Poor customer experience,"Poor customer service, average food for $$. We would have spent more on drinks & food if we could actually get some table service. We went elsewhere for drinks & dessert. Disappointing considering reviews."
Don’t even bother. Pls choose another Mexican restaurant. They have no clue what Mexican food actually is.,"Honestly I don’t have many good things to say. They have really slipped downhill since the last that I went there, which was probably 2018 when they had a different menu.

Their drinks are weak, the food is seriously bland, service is slow. We ordered 2 sides of rice and it didn’t even come even after everyone finished their main dishes. I asked to cancel and they were able to, which goes to show that it wasn’t even in the process of being prepared.
The price that you pay is ridiculous for the food they serve.
Zero in comparison with Margaritas (Mexican restaurant at Dempsey)

PROS:
Chips platter with dips is nice
That was really the only thing that was nice.

CONS:
WHO puts chunky onions in a burrito or a chimichanga for goodness sake??!!
Prawn chimichanga was bland.
Chicken quesadilla was bland.
Baja fish taco tasted like sambal belacan.
Jalapeño peppers didn’t taste of jalapeño and the cream cheese was so sweet.
Margaritas had no taste of alcohol in it.
Food took a pretty long time to come"
Good Food,Place was nice and staff are professional. Food was good. Should introduce kid friendly meals as an option.
Fabulous Frozen Margaritas,"Great spot just across the water from the main area of Clarke Quay so a little more chilled. Good menu with excellent frozen Margaritas. The Tacos were fresh and tasty and the Tequila Chicken amazingly tender with great flavour.

Only downside was the metal chairs on the decked area where a bit hard for my liking otherwise we’d probably have stayed for another jug of margaritas- next time we will sit inside.

Overall well worth a visit."
Excellent service and nice ambiance by the river,Excellent service and nice ambiance by the river. The food is very reasonable priced. Nice Mexican food.. highly recommended
Muchas Gracias Cafe Iguana,Tacos/Quesadilla/Burritos are excellent. First time having authentic Mexican cuisine. Definitely worth coming back!!!
Good food at good prices,Iguana is one of the go to places when we want a good and decent meal. The drinks -- mocktails -- are excellent. The nachos with the very dips are a must
Always pleasant experience,"Been patronising Iguana for more than 15 years..now bringing my family for the first time. Still enjoyable experience..friendly service and yummy food. Their margarita is one of the best I tasted so far. Many new Mexican restaurants in Singapore now, but Iguana has won the consistency on food and service! Thumbs up team Iguana!"
Mainstay of the Mexican food scene in Singapore; popular margaritas,"Love the ambience and drinks at this place, which also serves decent food — especially recommend their baja fish tacos."
Nice place to bring friends too but diminished quality,"Service was as great as ever, but compared to a year back the food options were limited and the quality of the dish was slightly lower compared a year back. Nevertheless a great place to dine in."
Customer service was awful.,Customer service was awful. Food wasnt that great the chicken wasnt fully cooked. Overpriced food with very poor quality. We thought the tortilla chips were free but we were unsure so we asked and the guy shouted how isit free? We were only asking. We didnt say we wont pay or anything. His tone was very rude. Yes we misread the freeflow as free. But can say it in a polite way? We were waiting to enter the restaurant it took them 10minutes to realise we were waiting. Another 20mintues to take our order. And when ordered quesadillas at last and they forgot our order and delayed another 30minutes at the end. The service was very awful. I wouldnt recommend anyone going there. My friends and i regret going there. Food is bad customer service is the nastiest i have seen in singapore.
Fantastic food and good portion size,Just a little hot as I was seated in a corner not under the fan. Everything else is perfect. Recommend to go again.
"Nice location, average food, ... but lousy service!","Nice terrasse, facing the Singapore river. Average food, not much difference with plenty other Tex Mex restaurant. But service is really lousy! 1/2 h waiting for a simple sigle dish! Just finished my beer and went ... to the place next door."
Excellent,Food and service from the indian guy who works there was excellent! Went there to celebrate husband’s birthday and they gave a free drink for him on the house! We were a fan of mexican food and this is decent. Will definitely come back! Recommended! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Very bad experience to get into the restaurant.,"The person at entrance (male manager) accused me saying I am using someone’s phone and did not allow us to get in to a restaurant although I logged in to the Healthhub using my Face ID in front of him and showed him an evidence of my vaccine status.

Also when my husband tried to talk to him, he told my husband “why do I need to listen to you!”. In the end, we called another female manager and she helped us get a table. We were with our two kids (listening all these unreasonable conversation and one of them was crying). By the way, we had a reservation!!

To be honest, the food was pretty good but the restaurant should not keep that kind of person to attend customers at the entrance. Very bad experience and ruined our Saturday evening dinner…."
"Many great things but super filthy, cramped toilets","Been coming here 14 years. Love the margaritas and the food has progressively improved. The toilets have not been touched. Narrow, small, humid and filthy. What’s up with that, owners? It’s gross."
Perfect start to weekend,"We were four friends. We preferred to sit oustide and were informed that the furthest point ( close to river ) didnt have a shelter so just in case it rained, we would have an issue. Accordingly we sat inside at a place where there would be rain shelter. The food was amazing and so was the service. Absolutely top notch for a great evening,"
Tasty Mexican veg food,"Visited this cafe once in 2019 with family, had all the food variety in veg option! also had kids menu which was very good for my daughter. Loved the food and the cocktails. its located on the other side of clarke quay buzz , so its not very crowded and excellent ambiance. going there again to get some delicious chimichangas :P"
High Recommended !!,I've passed this cafe many times but have never dined there. Last Friday's 26 March 2021 was organised by one of our friends who said this cafe has been around for the longest time. Food spread was good and we had few jars of the frozen margaritas and a bottle of wine. Service was a bit slow but forgivable since it was a Friday night!
Business Dinner at Iguana,As usual Cafe Iguana performs well. The food was great and the service by the Barman and our waiter Benjamin was flawless. Consistent.
Used to be really good,The Margaritas are too sweet but the food is generally okay except for the Churros. The Churros were the worst Ive had in Singapore.
great place to chill with your friends,v nice place w good atmosphere! went there for dinner and the service was great + the food was really good! good deals for drinks as well
Enjoyed the Mexican fare,"Was searching for a nice Mexican place on TripAdvisor for Sunday's dinner and found Cafe Iguana. The positive reviews prompted us to make a booking and we weren't disappointed.
Thoroughly enjoyed the outside seating, there was a nice breeze and the service was very prompt. Everything we ordered, was served in just about 5-6 mins every single time. We liked the burritos, jalapeno poppers and quesadillas, among other stuff. The servers were polite and pleasant.
Will surely visit again !"
Very good and caring bar services,Great services from Michael and his colleagues Max and Chun Hao. Gave great recommendations on food and the drinks. Marvellous frozen drinks we had. Really appreciate great staff Michael at the bar! Keep it up!
Very nice place to relax and have a very good food!,"Food options, food served, the service, atmosphere - Very nice! Definitely would come back and suggest my contacts to try this place."
Good food and ambience,Good food and ambience. Portion size small. Bit noisy due to loud music. Overall quite expensive. Service was excellent.
Nice View & Great Food,It’s a chill and nice place to be with. Enjoyed the time with my friends. It’s our first time there. The food was actually nice. One comment though is that the Nachos are not that crunchy anymore as they already mixed it with the sauce cheese and other stuffs. Everything else are good. Thanks
Rushed Service,"We ordered 3 appetizers, 2 mains and 2 sides and drinks. The entire order arrived at the same time, What is the point in calling dishes appetizers and mains if you're just going to serve everything together? I'm ranking service as terrible, not because the waitress was poor but a policy of delivering 5 dishes and two sides to a couple is insanity"
Yummy dinner,"The ambience was nice and the food was very good, just right portion and well presented. The waiters and waitresses were very friendly, came around to ask about the food. The bar-tender also came by to see if the cocktail drinks were good. Very impressed. Will definitely visit this place again."
Best margarita and. pork belly taco!,Having tacos and a jug of margarita for dinner was the best idea to end the night! Really enjoyed the food here specially the service of Michael the bartender! Always checking up on us! Definitely will be back for more!
fav mexican restaurant and bar!,"staff were all very friendly, the food was SUPERB and affordable for the generous portion :-) love the vibes of the place and definitely would go back! 10/10 recommend <3"
A seat at the bar is really recommended! Love the lime magaritas too!,"I've been to many taco places and I can safely say that the beef tacos here are the bombbbb. Really love the ambience near the bar as the Mexican decor adds such a nice charm to the place! If you can, I'd highly recommend reserving a table by the bar too as the bartenders are very friendly and add such a nice touch to the meal.

My bf and I were so happy to be chatting with Michael and he even dared us to really spicy habanero shots. Was a really fun evening! He was also checking on us throughout our meal to ensure everything was good. So yeah, whoever's Michael's boss -- PASS HIS PROBATION ALREADY! You've got a keeper!"
Not a fan of this place.,"We visited on friday night, it was jam packed. This place is ok. Service was quite quick though. We ordered the happy hour margarita jug. It was quite watered down so we ordered some tequila shots and poured them into the jug. The beef chimichanga was good. The coconut prawns were real bad and soggy. And when we asked for new cutlery they said that the restaurant was full and they don’t have any cutlery left. So we should keep our old ones. Anyway would not come back here."
Expensive for poor service and mediocre food,Visited on a Friday night and restaurant was jammed. Not enough waitstaff so service was very slow and inattentive. Food was okay - usually better when less busy. And not cheap. We won’t rush back
Good for happy hour,"First time back here in a long while, their margaritas are still as good! And they even have tiered happy hour price promotion starting from 12pm - Perfect!

The only gripe I have is over the pandemic safety guidelines taken by the restaurant as I can see them still using the paper menu which has some sauce stains. I was also little concerned that I saw my server holding my glass of margarita with his hand touching the salt rim."
Best Margaritas,Their margaritas are awesome (frozen and original) and my friend adores their potatoes with the half chicken and is obsessing over getting the recipe! It's one of our regular go to spots and I love the relaxed atmosphere and friendly service :) definitely worth an evening visit if you have time!
Quick serving time,"Food was good, served within 15mins. The only downside is price and lots of mosquito. Drink quality is okay."
Great place for food and a birthday!,My boyfriend lovesssss eating here so I just had to make reservations for his birthday. In my reservations I added that it was his birthday. I honestly didnt expect anything but the restaurant gave us complimentary churros and it was a real celebration. Had a blast with the excellent service and food. Will definately recommend this place
If I can give it 0/5 I would do that,"It has been a while since we came to Cafe Iguana and now i understand why everyone has forgotten about it. Food came cold including fajitas, guac was very weird tasting, quesadillas were overpriced - 4 oily miserable pieces of dough with cheese and chicken for $21, and drinks were watered down. Will never return. Both of us who ate the guac had terrible diarrhoea the next day. The one who didnt was saved from the agony."
Appetizers and drinks,"It was our first night of Phase 2 in SG and we were lucky to get seats at the bar where my partner and I shared appetizers and a bottle of wine. The food, atmosphere, and staff were great! I would definitely go again."
Perfect spot for cooling with an ice coffee,"Perfect spot for cooling down, and take in the sights of River Quay. Friendly staff, quirky decor. And the most yummy tortilla chips"
Great food and location,"An awesome dinner, the baked snapper and mango special was very nice. The churros aren't like what you would get in Spain, but still pretty good. Great attentive service and nice atmosphere."
Disappointing,The food was nice however all the starters and main courses were brought out together which we did not expect. This resulted in our main courses being cold by the time we finished our starters. Would be worth having starters first then mains and then not serving all at the same time.
Watch the hot sauce,"Riverside restaurant near the Clarke Quay shopping district offering Mexican food in abundance. The food was excellent, during our stay we must have tried the entire menu with few if any disappointments. The fajitas in particular deserve a mention. The only regret is not trying the cocktails, apparently they are as good as the food."
Authentic Mexican fare besides Singapore river,"The cafe provided authentic Mexican fare and it was a splendid evening besides Singapore river. Patron Margarita was refreshing. Camorones Al Diabalo - sautéed prawns, Tequila grilled chicken, prawn fajitas as well as Chimichangas were delicious. The place offers true value for money."
New year eve,The food was great n the ambience was gd. The ice blended magaritas with so many diff flavours is a must try!
Dinner,Good ambiance. Book an outside table. Lots of vegetarian options. Try the nachos and the margaritas.
My favorite Mexican restaurant,"Very friendly staff, nice place to chill on a late Sunday afternoon. Food has always been consistently delicious. They are nice to serve iced water and bowl of complimentary chips and salsa. Love their Diablo prawn, pork belly tacos and tequila prawn skewers. Definitely highly recommended."
Authentic Mexican food,"Very nice restaurant with authentic Mexican food. Been there for early dinner, we got a nice seat outside, very helpful staff, delicious food and some appetizers for free"
Sunday afternoon,"....I came here today to have a nice meal...and I must say - it was good. In the past I have had burritos with shredded pork, but as it was not on the menu today I went for a shredded beef. It was tasty! Added a bit of Cholula hot sauce, and you got thst mexican feel... its been drizzling in Singapore for the last week and few people out. Having a chilled Corona with the burrito is recommended. Great staff here too - very pleasant indeed!"
Great for drinks with a twist,"Visited here for drinks whilst waiting for a dinner booking.
Service isn't great but that's a Singapore issue, not specific to this restaurant.
The jalapeno tequila was a great cocktail to try which I'd highly recommend"
Late Family Lunch,went with eatigo at 4 pm on Saturday and got 50 percent discount. Food was very good. only slight complaint maybe chips tasted a little too oily.
Best margaritas!!!,"Cafe Iguana has the best margaritas in a variety of flavours which you can purchase by the jug. Suitable for large groups like ours. Our group enjoyed fajitas, taco salads and prawns and couldn’t fault the flavour and freshness of ingredients. And all with a view on the water. Will return!"
Awesome tacos and margaritas!,"An institution in Singapore,Cafe Iguana has been around for years and still serves up the best tacos and margaritas at a nice riverside location. Great food, great service and awesome drinks!"
Awesome mexican food and margaritas,"Came for my birthday dinner. Staff service was attentive and chirpy, the tacos were awesome and I loved the margaritas and happy hour. Will be back to try other items on the menu soon."
Great mexican food,Maybe best in Singapore!! Ah yes this one is very good fajitas and tacos and burritos taquerias and chips salasa
nice and good vibe,"we celebrated bday with my husband
thoughtful of crew they've given complimentary margaritas.. thats not a lot but we felt they are celebrating with us too... kudos team especially Kianna & John for hosting us."
12 years of ups and downs,Coming here 12 years. Margaritas best in SG. It’s gone from good to great to cheap. Service guys!!!!
Great every time,"Cafe Iguana is one of our favorite places. We go there often for the food, location, decor and service."
"Great Food, Fabulous Margaritas!","We usually stay in Clarke Quay and have been to Cafe Iguana several times. We were in Singapore in September and decided to go back to Cafe Iguana. It hasn't lost its great food and atmosphere. We had the prawn Fajitas which were sensational and more than enough with the complimentary corn chips and salsa, and of course a jug of margarita. Delicious churros for dessert! Their lime Margaritas must be the best I have ever had, all slushy and yummy. They were quick with the service and our server Jessie was awesome. She looked after us all night and was so friendly."
Cafe Iguana for to satiate your Mexican food urges,"In the mood for some Mexican food, we were taken to Cafe Iguana by a work colleague. With a slight drizzle coming down, the colorful Cafe seemed to come to life with a buzzing crowd.

The Nachos we ordered are different in a way that they seem to be like two in one, lovely dips, the soft tacos were good as well as the salad bowl.

The house drink's pitcher received a thumbs up from my colleagues as well.

Recommended."
Great and affordable,Food is great and the ambience is good! Will definitely return again to this place! Extremely satisfied!
We had a great time!!,"This was our regular hang out place when we were working at the area more than 10 years back and we are so happy that this place still exists. The food was great and the margaritas were fantastic - as one of my friends mentioned, Cafe Iguana serves the best margaritas in Singapore!!"
Great Margarithas,A jug of frozen margaritha is a must every time we go to Singapore. The location at Clarke Quay is great. The staff is friendly. The food is good but a little pricy..
Cafe Iguana,My experience and all my friends at cafe iguana was great. My opinion food is a little expensive but overall the service is good. I will still visit if I have enough budgets.
Downhill,"Have been regulars at Cafe Iguana over the past 8 years. Recent visit just confirmed the downhill experience. The quality of food has taken a dip and so has the quantity. The rates have almost doubled. The most frustrating thing is the quality of service. There is no warm feeling and it just feels like a fast food place. The service staff just puts everything in your face. There is. I welcoming smile or warmth or genuineness. They make you feel unwelcome and serve you as they are doing a favour.
I think, we have just finished our last visit ever to the Cafe."
Best place for Mexican,Excellent food and drinks and of course the homely service staff!! Not forgetting friendly staff Adam who took care of our table.
Cool dinner with drinks,"We walked by and decided to try it for drinks amd food. Staff was nice and friendly, food was really good and of course spicy. Jalapenos, quesadillas and fajitas were tasty and good value for money. Everything is served quickly, portions are big and fod tastes really good. We enjoyed frozen margarita and craft beers, we came back two days later and had the same positive experience. We will come back for tasty food and cool atmosphere. Not a cheap place, but Clarkes Quay is not a cheap place by definition."
A restaurant which wants you to have a good time,"We had a family lunch there and loved it. In most restaurants one feels part of a commercial transaction; at Cafe Iguana we felt they honestly wanted us to have a good time.The food was excellent -- free tortilla chips with superb tomato dip, tacos exploding with contrasting tastes, masterfully cooked steak with intriguing sauce. In most restaurants the kid's meal is perfunctory; here it was delicious with an array of fresh vegetables alongside the quesadillas and rice, and orange juice that tasted fresh. The colourful, relaxed decor, good background music (not too loud) and genuinely friendly service added to the experience. The restaurant isn't cheap but it's not expensive either by Singaporean standards, and no question you're getting value for money. Probably the best meal I've had at Clarke Quay."
Nice alfresco dinning by the river. Great service,Iguana is located fairly near to Clarke Quay MRT Station and hence it is accessible by public transport. Food and service are great. Nice view of the Singapore River with alfresco dinning. Would recommend the burrito with prawns because the prawns were so delicious and fresh. Cocktails were great as well.
Very good mexican food,The beef tacos and tacos salad were very good. Guacamole was homemade. Located by the river. Great experience!
Good Mexican in Singapore,"Had dinner there, we liked the food. It was good Mexican and not too expensive. They also have a good selection of cocktails for those who like them."
Chill bar overlooking the singapore river,Great bar with amazing food and snacks Famous for their frozen margaritas and their salsas are top notch as well!
best nachos in singapore!,"good food, ambience and good staff. perfect location if you’re out with friends. they have the best nachos and margaritas! must try!"
Excellent Dinner,"We were famished after a strenuous workout. Cafe Iguana sprung up in my mind at this moment ( it is always a dependable choice - we are regulars there) . As usual it did not disappoint. I ordered a red snapper enchilada and my Wife a chicken burrito. We also ordered a beef burrito takeaway for our Daughter. All three tasted superb. The house lime frozen Margarita was again very good - just like always!! The icing on the cake was the friendly , helpful and prompt service provided by Jessy... just like what I have come to expect from her from our several visits to Cafe Iguana."
Amazing,"Really cute interior, giving great vibes. Food was exceptional, as authentic as it can get. Do yourself a favour and have a meal there, you won’t regret it."
Mexican Cuisine - Awesome Food and Service,We had a rare condition of having pure vegetarians and sea food lovers in the family. This restaurant is next to Jumbo Sea Food so we had vegetarian members sitting in this cafe. The food was great and so was the service and the recommendations by the staff. Pure veg (asian veg) was available albeit with the help of the staff there.
Excellent service from Adam,"Great recommendations of the menu from Adam. He has great service and a sense of humor, highly recommended! If you want great service, look for Adam!"
A great lazy sunday afternoon,Loved it.. Thanks Adam...great service and awesome place to hang around for great margaritas..cheers
Roller-coaster experience over the years,"We first tried this place in 2010, thrilled to find an alternative to Margaritas for Mexican Food in Singapore. Between 2010 and 2013, we visited often with our 3 kids (who missed US tex-mex food) and found their service and food to be quite good, combined with a great location. We moved away from Singapore and visited again in 2016 when we moved back, and had a mediocre experience. Quantity and Quality of food and service had suffered. Tried again in 2018 and were pleasantly surprised that, though portions were not as large as before, the food was quite good though pricey. Visited again in June 2019 and were very disappointed to find that quantity and quality had suffered again!"
Mexican Restaurant,Great place for Mexican food. Great environment and ambience for gatherings. Located near the riverside. Service was good
