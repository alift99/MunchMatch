My advance birthday celebration,"Food and costumer service was great! Kudos to Abigael, KY, Natasha and Edgar for their warm service. Btw, thanks for the cake! Will bring my friends next time."
Disappointing,"Whilst visiting family they decided to book the buffet lunch as a treat.
We arrived at 12:00noon and looked at the dishes on offer.
They all looked good but were being kept hot by a heat lamp! every dish we tried was either tepid or cold. The only dish that was replenished whilst we were there was the lobster everything else was just stirred and left.
When I mentioned this there was no reaction just ‘ oh’
Also the traditional tea station was not operational and we were told it would be for breakfast.
All in all a very disappointing experience.
Not recommended at all.
Best avoided"
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,"My visit to The Courtyard at the Fullerton Hotel for the Hgh Tea was enjoyable with good variety of cakes, sandwiches, tea and most importantly, to top the icing on the cake, was the excellent service provided by the staff especially Mr Lalikumar, Ms Lin and Ms Monni. Thank you and they are a valuable asset to your Hotel."
"Excellent, caring and considerate services provided by staff","Firstly wanted to express my gratitude and appreciation to Town Restaurant and especially a staff name Nicha, my 2 girl friends and I were so impressed and had a wonderful gathering here, with excellent, caring and considerate services provided by Nicha. She has a servitude spirit and we were so touched by her attitude and humbleness! We had a great experience and we really did enjoy our time here with ease and being well served, her smiles and great services made us feeling warm and so welcoming! Thank you to your good restaurant and Nicha, we had a good and enjoyable festive dinner here! Great job and keep it up!"
Good Service,"Had our company dinner at the Town Restaurant. Various selection of food options. We were seated outside as we were a big group. The downside of eating outside is that the smoke from the bbq pit kept on coming towards us and our clothes got very smelly. Also, people walking on the path outside the restaurant kept on looking/staring over at our food so there was no privacy at all. Mr. KY served us and his hospitality service was great though! Food and service is a big 5 star"
Dont waste money on this resturant! Food is the worst among the 5* Hotels,"Service was good. Food is terribly bad.

We were welcomed by the friendly hostess. The hostess politely introduced the buffet spread displayed around the restaurant before bring us to our table. There were 9 stations in total. This is a food review. Totally NOT WORTH THE MONEY!

1. Seafood On Ice. There was a bad ""fishy"" smell throughout the seafood line when we went to pick up our food. Variety was decent. Salmon was not fresh, prawns were ""dirty"", Scallop is totally not fresh.

2. Bread station the pizza was hard and cold. Why will you even leave that 2 plates of pizza lying around beside the dry bread? Bread variety was good.

3. Salad bar variety is good. there was a housefly flying on the salad bar!!!

4. Appetizer counter, food looks fairly and one of the dishes looks like it was left overnight.

5. Chirstmas dinner, Everything from turkey, chicken, ham, sauces were dry and BAD! everyone on the table commented the same after having the first bite. How will you even serve something so bad on a buffet counter charging guest 100 per pax? Why will your marketing team promote such a beautiful poster along the B1 underground walkway when you serve things like this? Totally not worth the money.

6. Noodle station. NO CHEF was around 3 times when we appoached the counter. Noodles and ingredient looks fresh and well prepare. SOUP IS TOTAL TRASH! Laska and clear fishball soup. Fishball soup tasted like water totally worst than the any of the hawker centre. If you cant cook please change your menu of close that entire section. Stop wasting resources. Laksa soup was thick as gravy and totally bad. When everyone on the table when to get a bowl of noodles end up we only ate 2 mouth and said about leaving the comment in trip advisor to share why will the culinary team end up like this?

7. Coffee tea station: Good selection of TWG tea. WATER IS LUKE WARM! how to make tea with luke warm water? We aint making milk for babies right? We end up have to walk over to the bar counter to get hot water Temp. 86 Degree C to make our tea. Even a proper tea station dont have proper standard. Fullerton is a world class 5* hotel. So Bad!

8. Dessert station: everything there was there for the sake of being there. What is christmas dessert? melted cakes? mushy macorons? fruits were all not fresh at all! i only took a pcs of cheese cake and a few pcs of fruits. totally disappointed since the first till the end.

This is not my first time dining at Town Restuarant. This review is from all of us who dine in the restuarant yesterday night. If fullerton doesnt wish to make improvement then no point for other guest should even bother to go patronise them. If you have no heart to cook then CLOSE THE BUFFET and serve ala carte and stop wasting time and money promoting chirstmas buffet when you serve food that is not up to standard."
Amazing food,"The food is delicious. Every one of the staff members are really kind and have amazing customer service. Keep up the good work and continue to make good food! Thank you very very very much fullerton hotel, The Courtyard!"
Best Hi Tea Experience Ever,"Loved their vegetarian options that were suitable for my whole entire family. The scones were delicious when paired with the jam and the food was simply scrumptious. Service was excellent and all staff were attentive. In a blink of an eye, my empty cup was filled without me even asking because they were simply just that attentive. They will even explain the foods and recommend teas if you are stuck in a dilemma. Special shoutout to Mr Lalikumar as he made our fine dining experience the best."
Excellent Breakfast at the Fullerton,The service and food were excellent! They were so patient with our kids (who were making a mess) and really made our breakfast so relaxing. The selection and quality of the food were varied and tasty.
Poor Sunday Brunch,"Sunday brunch is far from what it used to be. It used to be great with a wide variety, but is now very poor. No signatures anymore. No foie gras. No scallops. No Parmesan risotto. A pitiful seafood and sushi selection compared to previously. The substitute lobster bbq was no compensation. Such a shame, and they are still charging high prices for an awful spread. It’s u fortunately time to find a new location after many great years."
Town restaurant @ The Fullerton,"Whilst staying in Singapore my husband booked as into Town restaurant at the Fullerton hotel.
We decided to go with the buffet and at $118 per person I really wished we hadn’t.
The food felt and looked like it had been sitting out all night, it was very dry and at best was cold/ lukewarm.
We decided to get dessert- as I tucked into mine I found a dead fly, when I inform the waiter he told me he would ‘share my feedback’!! He did not not offer a reduction in the bill or even a complimentary drink. The staff were slow and poor, the food was very poor and the overall evening has cost us $320 and an upset stomach ache!!"
Town restaurant buffet lunch review,"6 stars service, 2 stars food quality!!

Your wonderful team of staff made up to the poor quality of buffet experience, seriously.

The staffs were very attentive, proactively looking out for opportunity to offer service, be it topping up H20, clearing plates, giving us new utensils, bringing us chopsticks when she saw me without a pair when I have a plate of sashimi!! The head crew also made an effort to serve my boy a mini Graduation cake with her kind wishes, we didn't ask for anything.

But, the food were simply bad!! The meat, fish, seafood (ie fishball??), papadum, pizza, quiche, noodles etc were not fresh/ stale/ dry, like old reheated stuff,  food that are meant to be warm/ hot are left cold, pizza looks like amateur & stingy attempt (I baked well, so...). The only reasonable quality was the sashimi, cheese and nasi lemak rice and sambal chilli,  maybe the cut cucumbers were fresh but that's about all.. To summarize, this is far from FULLERTON STANDARD!! WHAT HAPPENED? Did you just lose your head chef or cost cutting of ingredients are your plan?

Your service crew were really the saving grace hence we still did enjoy our celebrations though dissapointed with the buffet.

Please give our appreciation and thanks to the lunch buffet service crew on 11 November and please do a quality check of the food, taste it like a paid customers and hopefully you will understand."
Fullerton Hotel Afternoon Tea,"Here to celebrate our girl frd’s birthday.
Food and service were excellent!
The staffs are friendly and professional. Making us feel very cosy and comfortable.
Special thanks to Mr Lalikumar, for bringing us laughter and acceding to our table request. Thumbs up The Courtyard team !"
Sunday Brunch,"Have had the Sunday brunch at The Fullerton on many occasions - as a couple and as a family .
It is world class - the setting , the selection of food and the service cannot be beaten .
I would recommend to anybody in Singapore to try it once .
Singapore is back !"
Breakfast for Two,"Breakfast was perfect, starting our holiday off the right way. The different benches of breakfast foods provide such a great variety. We loved the omelette & egg station and the option between machine & local coffee was such a great idea. Staff are so friendly as well."
Buffet dining experience,"This is our nth time eating at town restaurant, as always we had an excellent experience dining here. The food are great but it was the staff service that I can say makes our experience excellent. I would like to commend Floriza and Edgar for taking care of our group. Thank you town restaurant staff and management and we will definitely be back again!"
Heaven in Earth,"Superb food. Value for money. Amazing customer service. Worth it to celebrate my birthday . Edgar, Princess and Riza are very accommodating and attentive to our need. We’ll be back for sure ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
Birthday Dinner!,Food are superb ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️staff are accommodating and friendly. Variety of choices! Love the lobster and steak! Definitely will come back again. Teamwork are excellent! Special mention to Ms Princess and Mr Edgar.
Lovely surprise on a solo day in Singapore,"Wanted to do something special while I had a day alone in Singapore and stumbled upon the tea service at Fullerton Hotel in the Courtyard. There are two seatings and reservations are needed. But I asked Ariel just in case she was able to fit me in—and she did! I was able to listen to the incredible harpist and relaxed after a full morning roaming the city. What a delightful experience and I highly recommended adding this to your trip. And thank you for taking care of me, Ariel!"
Great birthday brunch.!!!,"Love the Fullerton on a Sunday. Sat by the river outside not too hot and good fans makes it very comfortable. Awesome Brunch Fantastic service Thanks to Ky, very attentive and looked after us. Thank you Ky."
Build your own ‘gua bao’…(!),"…as well as the option to build your own tacos, neither of which I have ever seen as options at buffets, so well done to whoever’s idea that was! Overall as well, the food was excellent. I enjoyed every plate I had, in particular food from the pasta section and the Indian curry on offer. Staff were also VERY accommodating, all really helpful we have a very messy baby. Best of all though is that this meal ended up costing hardly anything per person (even for three adults) because it was all covered by dining credits arising from our stay at this hotel the night before: what a fantastic deal!!!"
Friendly staff,"I am traveling on business on my own.

Have breakfast and meals at the Town restaurant.

Gobi is very friendly and attentive. She is courteous and takes good care of my.

The staff at restaurant Town are professional and friendly. The hotel staff in general make me feel welcome. I will come back."
Great service,We had a pleasant high tea session with the delicious food and drink at Courtyard Fullerton.. Attentive service by Lalikumar and team made our day. Looking forward to next visit.....................😁
Superb experience,"Being Served by Laili Kuma & his team. Really attend to us promptly to replenish the water. Ordered chicken rice, bak kut teh, soba & the desserts are tasteful. We Enjoyed the lunch. Thanks Fullerton:)"
Disappointing,Their food selection is not that much and doesnt look appealing. Food quality and taste are just so normal for us to pay $118/pax. Took almost all dishes with only 1piece to try and turn out none of it will have it again. Went back to Raffles Hotel and ordered room service. Will definitely not coming back and recommend to others.
Buffet Lunch,Tables siting arrangements not conducive and the front desk lady is forgetful. She lead my customer to the wrong table even though she has arranged another tables for me.
Great place for business lunch,It was a nice buffet spread and my working partners enjoyed the food. Would consider again for business lunches.
"Lunch at The Bar, The Fullerton Hotel","Great experiences at The bar, nice view facing MBS, good service and delicious food. Perfect for business lunch / friends gathering.Very friendly staff and such a lovely place to spent my afternoon there."
Town Restaurant is fab,Celebrated my friend's birthday in Town Restaurant. Staff were lovley and helpful and attentive. Lots of choices in food and cuisine. I love the lamb stew and the sashimi section. Will definitely recommend.
Exceptional Service! :),"Celebrated my birthday at the Town Resturant and we all had a great time. The staff were
all so friendly. The service was exceptional. I loved the ambience and the food quality was amazing.

Thank you so much for the great experience and will definitely recommend this place to my friends"
Dinner Buffet,Celebrate my friend's birthday in the Town Restaurant. The food was delicious! We were all super full! The staff were all so friendly and accomodating ... 2 👍 on the ambiance as well. Will surely recommend.
Sunday Brunch on father's day,"Service has not been the same as previous vists. Waiters were slow with starting on drinks where champagne brunch was ordered.

We had to ask on first few occasions for staff to clear plates and top up drinks.

Food selection has shrunk and some favourites disappeared. Timings have shortened yet prices go e up.

Overall it was pleasent, however no different to other brunches in singapore. We would not be rushing or reccomending Fullerton brunches to friends.

Thank you"
Fullerton Father’s Day,"My sons are now old enough to enjoy a decadent Fullerton free flow champagne buffet with us and it made for a special Father’s Day. The whole crew including Cristina, our hostess, and the mariachi brothers’ entertainment in particular made it a day to remember."
Excellent champagne brunch back to almost it's best!,"Excellent champagne brunch back to almost it's best!

Great service and cocktails and the food was fantastic if a little less choice than previously.

Service was also back to it's best with Ray and Princess leading the way for our table and making us feel very happy and welcome.

Great to see."
Compliments for Lalikumar,"Great dining environment with excellent staff. I would like to specially thank Lalikumar for his great service and warm welcome towards us. We had a vegetarian friend with us that had very limited choice of food and Lalikumar was very professional and provided us with lots of alternatives and vegetarian options so that my friend could enjoy her meal with us. It is my first time dining at Town Restaurant Fullerton and I am truly amazed by the great service rendered. Once again, a big thank you and appreciation towards Lalikumar for his great service, making us feel at home and ensuring that all our needs are met. Thank you!"
Fullerton experience,My family and I had a great dinnernat Town restaurant. Lalikumar and his team were very friendly and their service was beyond my expectations. I would definitely visit here again and highly recommend town restaurant to friends. Great job Lalikumar. Thanks for making us feel so welcome and we truly enjoyed our dinner.
Sunday Brunch - not what it used to be,"Let’s start with the good…. Waitress Princess was head and shoulders above everyone else in terms of service and attentiveness. Honestly she was superb.

The bad… the service in general was poor, to put it mildly. We didn’t get served a drop or bite of anything until 12:25 (brunch started at 12:00) and when we did it was slow and unsatisfactory. The standard food was average (that was given to you when you sat down) and the cocktails (bloody Mary’s) were clearly made by someone who has never made one before…

Back to the good…… we asked Princess for another Bloody Mary and she brought us back, personally made, superb bloody Mary’s.

At around 2:50pm we were told last orders… it’s supposed to be 3pm last orders so we can questioned it and got told it was supposed to be 2:30 (which it wasn’t - that was a lie)

Eventually we got another serving having argued the case that we weren’t served for our first 25 minutes of sitting down.

In summary…. It was disappointing. If it wasn’t for Princess, I would be asking for a refund/discount. She was running around to us and every other table trying to make sure the wheels stayed on the operation. The rest of the staff need to look to her for experience and guidance on how to operate.

Will not be coming back for a while, until they’ve had a chance to catch up with the reopening - our advice is put Princess in charge of your front of house."
Horrible service level,"Horrible experience at Town Restaurant for a dinner buffet. The service level definitely needs tons of improvement.

Firstly, the Heritage Bites is supposed to be their default starters they serve every table but it did not arrive even after 15 mins of waiting. We needed to remind the staff of our order. Despite this, the staff never get back to us and we waited another 20 mins before it finally served.

Secondly, I find this the most ridiculous. We ordered shoe strings fries under the kids menu for my child. Again, after waiting for 15 mins, it was nowhere to be seen. We asked the staff to check but similarly they never get back to us. 15 mins passed and we got to asked the staff again. We explained that our child only eat fries as he is a picky eater. After waiting agonizingly for another 10 mins, the fries finally arrived! In total, we waited about 40 mins just for fries. My Philips air fryer can get it done in less than 10 mins!

Thirdly, there were couple of dishes that we reordered but it never arrived. We also ordered some new dishes but were never served. What is the point of asking us to key in our order when half the time the dishes doesn't appear on our dinning table??

Fourth, I had asked for hot tea and milk towards the end of the dinner. I waited about 20 mins, no hot tea and no hot milk. By this time, I had totally given up hopes of drinking any tea.

Finally, it also took a long time for the billing process to be completed. Overall, I did not expect a one star service level in a restaurant that is suited inside a five star prestige hotel. The staffs looks demotivated and are not customer oriented at all. I hope the management will help to improve the service level and not let it go downhill. It's such a shame if it does happen. Thank you."
Interns Christine & Charmaine save the day!,"I was with my husband last year Dec for your champagne brunch, it was very good! Service and food (except dessert) are done very well. Decided to bring my gfs here to celebrate her birthday! We were ushered to our seats at 12pm. But took them a long time for your server to come to us (max, 6 tables were occupied by then). Neither did any of the senior (wear black color) uniform staff inform us we've to scan the QR code for food. Unfortunately your QR code many items can't be found and we've to ask your server for help. The 2 pinoy lady wearing Black color uniform have this permanent sulky look, not interested to serve us but they were SO CHEERFUL hovering around all the caucasians tables for a long time taking care of them. Ladies in black uniform forgets our order, tell us to scan the code ourselves and when we said we've difficulty she said she's busy and come back ""later"".

Luckily you've this 2 fantastic Interns Christine and Charmaine who are so cheerful and happy to help us. They took our orders happily and serve us swiftly. They're indeed your 2 bright spots.

However Town resto food is going downhill now. Your dessert has always been poor. My gf pointed out there's a small boutique Bedok Chocolate cake shop at SGD 2.80 per slice are better than any of your cakes display on our dessert plate. G&T use to come out from nice big round glass with grapefruit inside, now is a poor display of small glass. The main course lobster is way too sweet. Your famous chicken rice is a dismal. The display of your bread and pate are off putting.

If you want to charge SGD 178++ per pax, you've to ensure some quality is there. We know times are hard and we're all happy to help. But Town resto has to buck up at least 2 notches this time and kindly convert your 2 interns to wear the black uniforms and downgrade your current black uniform ladies to wear the blue shirt."
Atrocious Service Attitude at Town Restaurant,"Service at Town Restaurant is simply pathetic. I was dining alone and i requested for a quiet corner seating. The Filipino staff said the quiet corner is closed. 10 minutes later, guests were being seated in the quiet corner.

I was having a injured knee and walking up and down stairs is a problem for me. I requested to be seated upstairs and the Filipino staff refused to accede to my request. Ended up with my knee having a sharp pain when i walked down the stairs.

Attitude by the Filipino staff was simply atrocious"
Birthday dinner at Fullerton,Great service by Lalikumar at Fullerton Hotel Town Restaurant. Buffet style served to table. Food was good and served promptly. My favourite was the desserts especially the lemon meringue. Parking included for diners.
Positive attitude of restaurant staffs at TOWN Restaurant and Good foods,The team is very positive and friendly. Staffs are very motivated to serve the customers. Takes time to check on customer needs and have good humour. Especially would like to mention a customer service crew by the name of Wendy and LaliKumar who keeps very positive attitude and accommodates to customers request. These two have good knowledge of the food products and able to understand what customers are requesting just base of descriptions. Foods served are fresh and the waiting time to serve is efficient.
"Excellent service, attentive staff","Had a great dinner at The Town. Dinner was made super memorable with the great service rendered by the team. Special mention to Wendy, thank you for taking care of us. You made our good dinner GREAT! Thank you!"
Amazing service + great food,"First visit to the Town Restaurant, was an amazing experience. Food was outstanding, along with the service. The staff were extremely friendly and attentive, and the ambience of the restaurant is nice and relaxing, a great place to have conversations and hang out. Special mention to the manager, Lalikumar, for his exceptional service, professionalism, and great recommendations of choices of food. He is knowledgeable and experienced, which contributed to the enjoyable experience. Family is extremely keen to come back again."
Buffet dinner @ Town,A place you can chillax...you can enjoy to eat the food they served...the food they served are fresh...I try it some but sashimi attracted to my eyes and to my heart...and the staffs are attentive and polite.
Impeccable service,"This review is for Town Restaurant at Fullerton Hotel.
This is not the first time we visited this restaurant and the service never fail to impress me.
This evening, my husband and I decided to have dinner here. We ordered the burger and club sandwich.
The portion was massive. I even have to takeaway my other half of sandwich.
The food was delicious.
More importantly, two other staff impressed us the most fir the service given to us.
I would like to commend on these two.
Their names are Lalikumar and John.
They made us feel welcomed, like seeing some old friends.
This is the reason why we return to Town restaurant every time we are in Singapore.
This has become our favourite restaurant.
Every holiday has its golden moments and these guys make it special.
We will be visiting very soon again for their high tea."
Comfortable rooms + amazing service at The Town Restaurant,"Dear Team Fullerton,

I sent this as an appreciation for the services from one of your staff, Mr Fabian from The Town Restaurant.

My family and I had such a delightful experience at The Town Restaurant on 26 Feb, Saturday and Mr Fabian was attentive and attended to our needs with utmost warmth. I was impressed to see the prompt service despite the peak hours at the restaurant.

We frequently had our meals at The Town restaurant due to the good food but this exemplary service would definitely add to the reason for us returning to the Town Restaurant."
Grand hotel!,"Luxurious setting, but slightly limited in options. There are many dining options just a stone's throw away though so the location more than makes up for it. That and the history and iconic architecture."
Family buffet dinner at Town Restaurant,"Outstanding food and ambience. Special mention to all the servers, esp to Wendy and Princess May, for the attentive service. Not a single false note. Keep it up!"
Goods service crew and nice ambience,It was really a wonderful start for the brunch at Town Restaurant The Fullerton on 2 Jan 2022. The service crews are wonderful. Especially Mr.Steve and Ms Charmaine. Thank you for the service during our time there. It was an enjoyable brunch over there
"The staffs from the Town restaurant of Fullerton hotel is exceptionally amazing, super friendly and professional","I just had my breakfast at 9am with my husband at the Town Restaurant of Fullerton hotel, we were seated outside and being served by these 3 staff (1 guy in suit and 2 girls), they really did a great job, I am able to notice this girl did an amazing job by the name of Ms.Chermaine, although she had her mask on but I can see her smiling towards us when she talked to us and asked us how is the food, do we need more tea or juices or if she can get more food for us, this is world class service, please raise their pay or give them a bonus, they are indeed good staffs that deserved to be valued by the company"
Dining at town Restaurant,"The service staff was attentive. Thumb up. But they tripped the soya sauce dish two times during service. Lucky, i avoided the spill onto my pants and shoes.

Booked a christmas buffet takeaway. No response from hotel on my queries. No response to email or calls. POOR.

But the x-mas lights were impressive."
"Great service for dinner, excellent food","Our family was at the Town Restaurant for dinner on 7 Dec 2021. The lobster nasi lemak, beef cheeks and fish and chips were wonderful.
The food took a while to arrive but the delicious food and great service more than made up for it.
Lalikumar gave us good recommendations and he was cheerful, helpful and obliging. It was a memorable dinner indeed."
TOWN restaurant,"The welcome, attention and willingness to please and make diners happy is one of the best example of customer service.

I would like to give compliments to Xuejing with her service full of smile and the service was exceptionally great. Your attention to detail, great communication skills, and ready smile made the experience even better than I expected."
Excellent breakfast!,Perfect place to enjoy exceptional breakfast with perfect view. Outstanding service and great quality food! The outside terrace is an excellent place to dine! Special thanks to Abigel!
Great service for dinner,We have received great service when we dine at Fullerton Hotel The Town to celebrate my hubby birthday last Sat. Special thanks to Lalikumar who make us feel like home. We will be back coming weekend for staycation to celebrate our Anniversary and looking forward for the great experience again
perfect for bday celebration,"great food and friendly service. good value for money for the weekend yum cha package. A special thanks to yvonne, alison for the great service. Many thanks to chef leong for the amazing bday cake decoration!"
Great service,Had dinner outdoors at the patio and the atmosphere was very enjoyable. Steve served us and was very helpful in terms of recommendations & constantly checked on us to ensure the food was ok. Received a printed out photo as a birthday momento ☺️
Nice dinner,"The food was nice, with nice ambient. Their specialty food like pecking duck is nice. The flavour is rich. And their staff great service. Definitely will come back for another dining experience. Yvonne Joppy"
Friendly and comfortable,"We had high tea and lunch and this restaurant during our staycation. Food was delicious with large portions. Service was attentive, friendly and accommodating. Makes one feel like you are dining with friends."
Excellent food and services,"Dine in here for lunch and the food were carefully crafted and very delicious. We enjoyed the food very much and the service by Alson, Penny and Joppy were fantastic. The atmosphere is very warm, relax and classic. Would definitely recommend to others."
Excellent breakfast at town restaurant,"We patronised town restaurant for breakfast. The food was really delicious. Portion was very generous. Staff xuejing also kindly told me that the portions are huge so that I can order accordingly and avoid food wastage. Due to Singapore's regulation of dining in 2s,that means our family has to spilt into 2 tables. As I had to go to the toilet, that meant my little one had to be left alone at the table. However the staff very sweetly babysat my kid despite the hectic morning buzz. Thank you hui min for baby sitting my kid. Also thanks to Annie and sherlyn for the hospitable service. We enjoyed the breakfast very much."
Singapore Dim Sum Sunday Brunch Experience 🥟🥢🫖,"Great experience of a true local dim sum tradition. The team was attentive throughout the lunch. We experienced 15 different dishes. Special thanks to Alston, Shirley and Yvonne who made sure everything went well. Also they arranged a special attention birthday cake for my wife and she was delighted."
Good service and food,"I had breakfast there during my staycation, as well as lunch. The variety at breakfast is good, and they even have a vegetarian menu. My friend enjoyed the lobster nasi lemak at lunch. You can sit either indoors or outdoors by the river."
Dinner for two,"Exquisite meal! Well sized portion. Balanced and calibrated flavour. The dong po rou, and crispy rice with fresh crab and chicken broth really stands out. Service from penny and wayne was excellent! Unobtrusive and attentive."
Fullerton Hotel,"Excellent service to Yvonne Joppy & Chef Leong for nice foods & special art pieces 👍 We are vegetarian & greatly enjoyed the foods, Morel mushroom coral beancurd soup, black truffle mushroom & veg trio combination. 👍👍👍"
Excellent Service,Food was great! The most impressive part was the service they gave to us. The crew was very attentive to our needs. Kudos to Abie and the team!
Town Restaurant dinner was awesome,"Lalikumar from the Town Restaurant provided impeccable service. Enjoyed our dinner feast, especially the Lobster Nasi Lemak and Fullerton Burger. 1-for-1 house pour wine was delicious and truly a treat. Would definitely come back again."
Excellent services by Josh and John,"From the time we step in and ordering food, services by Josh and John is excellent. They would make sure to fill up my plain water when they saw that my water is finishing soon. They help to take many beautiful picture for me and my gf. As it is our anniversary, they also provide us with a photo for souvenir, which is a nice gesture by the restaurant. Both of them are service orientated and totally valuable asset to your company. Do ensure that management is aware of this compliment for the above staffs."
"The staff are well trained, well mannered and serves with passion! Thumb up👍","We arrived late & the front desk staff, Candy took the extra mile to pick us a room with excellent view! We continue receiving pleasant surprises from the teams led by Kumar & Angelina when we dine in the Town restaurant and the Courtyard! We will definitely be back again!"
Birthday Celebration,"We had my birthday celebration at Town and the staff (Lalikumar, John, Lucy) made our experience very memorable. They even made a personalized card for my birthday. They were also attentive to the orders and made sure that we got everything we needed. Their dedication to making a customer experience great, is commendable. Totally worth choosing to dine here :)"
It was really fantastic service experience at Town Restaurant.,"This evening, I walk-in to eat dinner at Town Restaurant with my girlfriend. Then the staff called Tenny was very attentive and asked me if i needed anything. and Jun Wei &Henry also they keep smiling with their eyes while serving the food and three of the staffs even if i asked for a lot if things, they smiled and brought me what i needed. I had the best food with the best service. It was a great dinner. Thanks Tenny, Jun Wei and Henry for your excellent service. I will come back again:-)"
Having dinner,"20/10 Today is a special day, we celebrated our marriage (( yvonne ))and (( kyo )) have served us well and the food is great 👍 👍👍👍 thanks!! ((yvonne)) and ((kyo)) for giving a patient 🙏............"
Top notch food and service!,"Served by 2 top class waiter and waitress by the name of Penny and Alson, we had a great time indulging our food as well as great food services; they even went extra miles to help us take a great photo, printed out and attached it in a nice card as it is my birthday! The food while comes in quite small portion; is of distinct taste and flavorful especially the lobster noodle. Thank you Penny and Alson, definitely a memorable one, and will visit again in the future."
Birthday dinner celebration,"Special Thanks to Penny and Alson for their excellent service throughout our dinner. Both are very enthusiastic and professional with their service and they present detailed level explanation for each of the dishes! 👍 A memorable celebration to remember, good job!"
Service oriented but be less forgetful,"We utilized our dining credit (of $100.00) at Town Restaurant for our dinner - I had Nasi Goreng while my wife had fish and chips (we even ordered 2 glasses of Rose Wine)... Food quality for both the dinner and the complimentary breakfast for 2 pax were acceptable standard/taste. And I mean the taste is typical food taste without much of an ""wow!"" factor that I would say ""must try!"" Just that service crew may get forgetful - on both dinner and breakfast occasion, we had asked for something (i.e.: chilli sauce/sambal chilli), the staff totally forgot about it. We had to ask another service crew for it (we understand may get a little busy, but having diners to repeat our request and dining experience put on halt is not very service oriented). Hope they can improve on their ""follow-ups"" by not forgetful."
Great Service,John who was serving us was very friendly and recommended the right food to us. Plates were cleared for nice u have eaten. Highly recommended for the good food and service
Excellent dining experience,We came here 3 times and each visit was a different experience. Hope is professional and always delights us with our favourite chocolate cakes.
