Early Lunch with amazing food,"The food here was absolutely amazing. The starter, main, and desserts + steak were all cooked to perfection, with the specialty sauces being a highlight as well. The cuts of beef chosen were also juicy and tender, and paired eith the salt and onion — tasted devine :)

the cheesecake was also a great finishing dessert and the hint of sourness in the passionfruit sauce really gave a great contrast to its flavour.

bonus: GREAT LOCATION 5 minutes walk from botanic gardens mrt station"
Weekday Brunch,"Cosy atmosphere and extremely close to Botanic Gardens MRT. Ordered pan-seared salmon rice bowl, deep fried Camembert and a classic New York cheesecake. The deep fried Camembert was really mindblowingly good and I really enjoyed eating this 3 dishes brunch here! :) New York cheesecake was pretty good too :D"
Weekend Brunch,"A steakhouse with perfect vibes for a weekend brunch

The restaurant is located conveniently near Botanic Gardens MRT, and is definitely a place where you can enjoy good food and have a nice chat!

Had the Deep Fried Camembert for appetisers, and had the Creme Brûlée French Toast with Fried Chicken as one of our mains.

The Wagyu Denver steak with Broccolini on the side was our other main, and it was definitely the star of the show. The steak was seasoned well, with the charred flavour prominent with every bite.

Would definitely recommend visiting if you’re looking for somewhere to have a relaxing, and appetising meal"
Great weekend brunch!,"Enjoyed the food at FBG, which is a short walk from Botanic Gardens MRT station. The Wagyu Denver Steak was very well seasoned and a perfect medium rare. The fried camembert with truffle honey is a must try! We also tried the grilled broccolini, Creme brûlée French toast, and cheesecake, all of which were very good! Had an extremely enjoyable brunch."
Amazing food and service,"Came here to try their wagyu beef and it was really good. Had their Denver wagyu which was grilled to a perfect medium rare. Each bite was like having an umami bomb go off in your mouth. What was amazing was that the accompaniments of sea salt and roasted garlic drew out a new depth of flavour.

My partner had their 'breakfast fry up' and also really enjoyed their meal. We really liked the mushrooms on that dish as it really brought the dish together.

We shared their luxurious 'classic new York cheesecake' for dessert. It was generously topped w a strawberry compote that brought in a citrus element in the cake.

Had a good time here and would recommend this place to anyone walking near the botanics garden area."
Enjoyed our weekend brunch!,"We enjoyed our delicious weekend brunch at FBG! The location was only a stones throw away from Botanic Gardens MRT, making it a convenient location to have a lovely catch-up over a meal with friends or family.

For beverages we had the vanilla latte and peppermint tea, which were both fragrant and refreshing.

The Deep Fried Camembert, served with picked jalapeño and truffled honey was a lovely appetiser.

For mains we had the Breakfast Fry Up, which was generous with the ingredients which all tasted amazing. We really loved how the eggs and mushrooms complemented each other.

The Waygu Denver Steak and Broccolini was astounding, and paired each other well with a delicious grilled flavour. Would highly recommend their grilled food items!!

Last but not least, the Classic New York Cheesecake was the perfect end for this lovely meal, the creaminess of the cheesecake was balanced with the sweet wild strawberry compote and zesty passionfruit sauce.

Would highly recommend this place, the staff are friendly and the food is really good!"
Amazing Service and Food,"The Wagyu Denver was super tender (: Love the semi crust on the outside and the succulent meat in the inside! The size of the steak was just nice and it semi melts in your mouth. Would have preferred it even more if there were more sides (e.g. potato or salad) as part of the dish as well

Broccoli was grilled very nicely and I love the chilli and anchovy sauce that goes together with it! It has a tinge of lemon and salt with it!

Location was super easy to navigate! Just a few mins away from Botanics Garden and i will defo head there again"
Affordable and delicious!,"FBS is located just a few minutes walk away from Botanic Gardens station. If you are looking for a steakhouse to have some quality steaks then this is the place to go. Just watching the chefs grill the steaks in the kitchen was such a delight to watch and the meats are all cooked precisely to your liking, rested before they are cut and served to you.

I enjoyed all the food but the Denver (wagyu steak) deserves a special shout out. Cooked rare, the steak was bursting with juices, soft and tender. Accompanied with a small pinch of salt and some cloves of perfectly grilled garlic, this was a perfect combination. 

All in wall, this was a very delightful experience and I definitely will be back to try more steaks from FBS' menu. "
Amazing steak and location!,"Visited Fat Belly near Botanic Gardens MRT and was pleasantly surprised by their food! I really loved their Denver wagyu steak - perfectly grilled with the right amount of juiciness and smokiness. Their sides were extremely tasty and provided a great balance to the steak. Huge shoutout to the Deep Fried Camembert which went really well with the honey truffle sauce! We also had New York Cheesecake for dessert which was the perfect finish for the meal.

We'll definitely be back for their steak and sides even though it is on the pricier side. MUST TRY!"
Delicious steakhouse,"Visited FBG for the first time and it was such an enjoyable experience. The restaurant is a short 5 min walk from Botanic Gardens mrt. We had deep fried camembert, denver wagyu steak, grilled brocolini and new york cheesecake. I really loved the camembert and would definitely come back for more! The staff were friendly too! It's on the pricier side but worth it!!"
Delicious food and helpful staff,Visited FBG (near Botanic Gardens mrt) for the first time and enjoyed my experience there. The firmness and juiciness of the wagyu steak I had was amazing! The staff was also very friendly and ready to check with us what we needed. We enjoyed the cheesecake too!
Amazing steakhouse with friendly staff,"Visited the Serene Centre branch and I really enjoyed the steaks we had. The starters, sides, and desserts were really yummy too! Had a great experience here!"
Very good,"Went for lunch. Nice foods, and the staff was very sweet in giving recommendations on what to eat and the food was just perfect. I'll be back as soon as possible!"
Classy and chill steakhouse,"Had lunch here and really enjoyed the fried camembert starters and wagyu denver!

the jalapeños and truffle honey paired amazingly well with the cheese, and the wagyu steak was simple and savoury

we also tried the mushroom toast and new york cheesecake got to see the chefs preparing our food infront of us which made for a nice exp"
Lunch @ FBG serene centre,"Had lunch at this steakhouse near Botanic Gardens MRT, would highly recommend it!
Tried the Denver steak from their charcoal grill, mushroom on sourdough, the fried Camembert, grilled broccolini and the cheesecake for dessert. The steak was cooked very nicely and the sides were also delicious! Also since they prepare the steaks in view of the customers, we could see how professional the chefs were when preparing our dishes.

The service was excellent and the atmosphere of the place was great, would definitely come back to try more of their dishes!"
Amazing Sunday Brunch,"Had Sunday brunch at FBG and their food is just so tasty! The steak was just done perfect and had the right amount of smokiness and juiciness to go along.
Other than the steak, their fried camembert is also a must try!
Great location near Botanics Gardens and the service was just so friendly!"
Nice Smokey Wagyu Steak,"After reading some good reviews of this steakhouse, decided to come over on a late sunday morning to try it out (Partially to avoid the crowd too as it got really packed towards lunch hours).

Any how, ordered a few dishes to share together with my friend. Food tastes better when shared right? Got the Denver Wagyu Steak, Deep Fried Camembert, Grilled Broccolini, Breakfast Fry Up and a dessert.

Highlight of the day is definitely the wagyu steak! Cooked to a nice medium rare, and buttery smooth texture. Came with a nice smokey char as it was grilled over a charcoal grill, which added an extra depth of flavour to the already brilliant steak. The other dishes were no slouch either and could make an impact on their own.

Definitely would come back again to try the other items on the menu!"
"Awesome steak, service, and location!","I had a wonderful meal at Fat Belly again! I brought a friend along this time and we were treated to some amazing food. The price is definitely on the higher side, but it was well worth it.

The star of the show was absolutely the Denver Wagyu Steak. The Smokey taste from the charcoal grill was evident which I love so much. The meat was so juicy and tender.

We also had other food that were just as good, especially those that got the Smokey grill treatment. Honorable mentions are the Deep Fried Camembert, Breakfast Fry Up, Grilled Broccoli and Classic New York Cheese Cake.

The staff were extremely friendly and the restaurant location is conveniently located just next to the Botanic Garden.

I would definitely come back again!"
Yummy meal at FBG!,"The restaurant is located in a quiet corner of Serene Centre near the Botanics Gardens. Ambience was nice and peaceful as well. We had the fried camembert, denver and deckle steak, creamed kale, grilled brocollini and their house baked cheesecake. Very pleasantly surprised by their food as the steak were cooked to just the right tenderness and juiciness. The vegetable sides were also yummy, they provided a great balance to the steak which were heavier on the palate. The cheesecake was a great end to the meal and the strawberry compote + passionfruit syrup was a great match as well.

Would definitely want to visit Fat Belly again and recommend everyone to give it a try!"
a humble steakhouse located at botanic gardens!,"fat belly is a steakhouse located at botanic gardens, situated at a quiet yet cozy spot! it was my first time visiting fat belly and it truly did not disappoint! had the fried camembert, denver steak, deckle steak, creamed kale, grilled brocollini as well as their house baked cheesecake!

all the dishes were executed really well and my personal favourites were the denver steak and the creamed kale! the denver steak had the perfect amount of fattiness and was cooked really well! was expecting the creamed kale to be heavy on the palate, but it was such a nice balance of flavour (the white wine cream was delicious!!!) house baked cheesecake was also really yummy especially with the wild strawberries compote!

the service at fat belly was also amazing so would strongly recommend all to give it a try! i will be back!"
One of the best steakhouses I’ve been to,"Tucked away hidden gem of Bukit Timah, found this small steakhouse by the side of Serene Centre. Decor looks new, open-style bar concept. Food was amazing! Each cut was served at the perfect level of doneness, with a superb crust on the steak while maintaining a flavourful and juicy interior. Could see them flame grilling from the seats too. Many sides to pair with, went with the cream kale which was a good contrast and pairing with the mains, and the broccolini which had a refreshing zest to it. Will definitely return to try more varieties they have to offer!"
Favourite Steakhouse in Singapore<3,"The Full-blood Wagyu MS 9+ Denver and Jack's Creek F1 Wagyu Deckle were mindblowing — the Denver melted in my mouth while the Deckle was extremely tender and a perfect medium-rare. Halfway through the meal, I felt like I needed a side and ordered the creamed kale, which many have raved about. It was velvety smooth and extremely flavourful! Ended my meal with a classic cheesecake.

Tucked in Serene Centre at Botanic Gardens, it was accessible and quiet, perfect for a date night. Thank you Fat Belly for such a memorable night, I'll be back!"
great steak and appetizer!!,"I came here with my partner for a Tuesday night dinner and we had such an amazing time — delightful service, classy ambience, succulent steaks, and innovative sides. I absolutely love the Fried Camembert, a starter which features croquettes of oozy camembert goodness accompanied by pickled jalapeños and truffle honey. We treated ourselves to a 2GR Full-Blood Wagyu Denver and a Jack’s Creek F1 Wagyu Deckle for steaks. The steaks had a glossy sheen of marbling and were melt-in-your-mouth tender. We also ordered the Creamed Kale, which is a refreshing play on the classic creamed spinach, and rounded our meal off with an indulgent House Baked Cheesecake. Fat Belly is definitely a must-visit for steak lovers and I can’t wait to return for another lovely meal."
Juicy steaks and yummy cakes,"Fried Camembert was enjoyable. The pickled jalapenos and truffle honey really made it a more-ish kinda dish. While the steaks hit the spot and were (thankfully) not overcooked, a big shoutout has to go to the dessert I tried. I was taken aback by just how good the cheesecake was. The tart wild strawberry compote is to die for.

All in all, love the food, ambience and service (staff were attentive and efficient). Will definitely be back for more."
Steak Goodness,"Fat Belly serves up a classy, no-frills, and communal dining experience with succulent steaks and unique appetisers. I ordered the 2GR Full-Blood Wagyu Denver and Jack’s Creek F1 Deckle, with two sides of Grilled Broccolini with a chilli & anchovy emulsion and Creamed Kale with white wine cream. I was amazed by the masterful simplicity of their dishes; the steaks were served with a sprinkle of salt and a roasted clove of garlic — that was really all it needed to be perfect. The creamy earthiness of the garlic was a vessel for the juiciness of the steak, and the salt helped to lift the buttery richness of each bite. The sides were also prepared with refreshing, tangy, and bitter flavours that complemented the umami of the steak. Overall, it was a 10/10 experience and Fat Belly is now decidedly one of my top go-to restaurants for steak in Singapore."
buttery steak + wonderful service,"great dining experience at FBG w yums food and really pleasant servers :,)

ordered the denver wagyu + some sides and dessert. I actually don't usually eat beef cuz of gamey taste but the reviews are really right!! FBG is such a game-changer. the steak was almost buttery and my knife rly cut right through. fried camembert was also lovely w a nice contrast w pickled jalapeños and truffle honey (tho I wish the jalapeños had a bit more of a spicer kick/more tart!)

highly recc!!! plus point: v near botanic gardens so no need to do navigation 101 legit 5 min walk ~"
Really great steaks!!,"Came here for the first time to try their steak. We got the full blood wagyu Denver and a wagyu deckle which both came with a full head of roasted garlic. Really loved the deckle as it was really tender. Both steaks were really good and I really like adding the roasted garlic on the meat. Also got the creamed kale, broccolini and the fried Camembert. The creamed kale was really good and not jelak at all. The broccolini was okay and the fried Camembert was actually really delicious with the pickled jalapeños. Also got the cheese cake and the 1 for 1 Aperol Spritz which was quite strong. Overall solid food!"
Excellent Steak and ambience,"Finally decided to hit up this steakhouse after walking by a few times and it definitely did not disappoint. To start, we had the Fried Camembert which went really well with the truffle honey sauce provided at the side. For mains, we had the medium well Wagyu Deckle and Denver steak which was really tender. To go with mains, we had a well seasoned Grilled Broccolini and comforting bowl of Creamed Kale (my personal favorite). For dessert, I had the house baked cheesecake which I highly recommend. Overall, I would say the food and ambience of the place was good, and the staff were very efficient!"
Absolutely worthy of regular visits if you love steak!,"Heard raving reviews about Fat Belly from some friends and decided to give it a try since I was in the area of Botanic Gardens. Located in Serene Center which is just a short walk away from Botanic Gardens MRT Station, Fat Belly provided an absolutely immaculate ambience for a dinner with loved ones. Ordered a Fried Camembert as a starter, and the Truffle Honey sauce was the perfect complementary dip to go with! Both the Full-Blood Wagyu (Denver) and Jack's Creek Wagyu (Deckle) were absolutely amazing too and both steak were also served with salt and garlic on the side. To top off the entire dinner experience, I ordered both the Grilled Brocollini and Creamed Kale in White Wine Sauce to balance between meat and greens.

All in all, I enjoyed the quality of food served at Fat Belly. What elevated the dining experience was the professionalism and friendliness of the Fat Belly staff too. Kudos to them for creating a great dinner environment!"
Amazing dining experience!,"Had a delightful dining experience at Fat Belly. For starters, my partner and I had the Fried Camembert. Truffle, fried cheese and spicy jalapenos, you can't go wrong with this combination. For our mains we each had wagyu steaks which were rich and tender. Our sides were grilled broccolini and creamed kale. Both were unique and delicious. We ended off the night with a slice of house baked cheesecake with a strawberry compote. It was sweet and tangy at the same time and super well-balanced. Overall, the food here is simply delectable. It was also near the botanic gardens which would make for the best way to end off a date night. 10/10 would come back!"
Steak steak steak,"Lovely steakhouse located near Botanic Gardens MRT. Enjoyed the chill ambience of the restaurant. Staff were polite and friendly. Sat at the bar and had the opportunity to watch the chefs at work.

Had the Denver and Deckle Wagyu steak together with Cream Kale and Chili Broccolini. Steak was cooked nicely medium rare and served with a tasty clove of garlic, which was delicious when eaten together. Particularly enjoyed the cream kale as well.

Overall a pleasant experience."
Amazing steakhouse at Botanic Gardens,"Was looking for a steakhouse near me and I chanced upon FBG. Had the denver and deckle steak there, where they were served with salt and charred garlic. The steaks were served medium rare and it was indeed medium rare (unlike other steakhouses I've been to)! We also ordered some sides to go with the steaks, being the creamed kale and the grilled broccolini. I would recommend the broccolini as it was served with a tangier sauce which helped balance out the ""heavier"" steaks. It's location is also very accessible, being a 5min walk from Botanic Gardens. Would highly recommend it for any date nights, or a hearty dinner out with friends and family!"
Nice Steakhouse @ Botanics,"Saw quite a few good reviews for FBG at Botanics and went to try it out myself! Tried the Denver and Deckle Steaks and they did not disappoint! Really like the Deckle, it was a beautiful cut and quite tender. The Cream Kale and Brocollini were also nice sides to pair with the dish as well."
Good,Nice steakhouse at Botanic Gardens. Had decker and Denver steaks and they were amazing! Cream kale and broccoli were made perfectly as well. Ended with cheesecake and it was great.

"No frills…just great steaks, starters, sides and desserts.","What is there to like about Fat Belly? For one, everyone is friendly and knowledgeable about the cuisine they serve. And the food is spectacular. By this I meant the steaks, the sauces, the starters and even the desserts. For starters we had ceasar salad, fried Camembert and toasted sourdough. For desserts we had tiramisu and vegan chocolate mousse. And the steaks were cooked to perfection. This is a basic looking unpretentious restaurant but dining in here was a delight that hubby and and I will definitely have to make this a mainstay. Fortunately we live so close to to it."
Decent steakhouse with good ambience,"Nice place for steak near Botanic Gardens MRT! Got the Full-blood Wagyu MS 6/7 Denver and the Jack’s Creek Wagyu MS 4/5 Deckle, both were lovely. The fried camembert is also a must-order and the house baked cheesecake is very balanced and not overly rich despite having it after wagyu. Worth the visit!"
pleasant dinner experience 🍓,"visited Fat Belly at Botanic Gardens on Monday 5 September, and it was moderately crowded but still the ambience was intimate enough for my friend and I to enjoy a lovely catch-up over dinner :) the music choice was really to my liking too, all my favourite songs from 2019.

i’m still thinking about their truffle honey! paired with their fried camembert and pickled jalapeños, this was really the perfect starter with which to whet our appetites for the dinner ahead of us. second-time here at their Botanic Gardens location, and the steak is as good as i remember it :) also really enjoyed their house baked cheesecake! the creaminess and texture was on point, and as someone who usually doesn’t like graham cracker-based cheesecakes, i liked this one."
Perfect date night,"Had a great time here because of the good food, service and cosy environment. Got the Denver wagyu steak and loved how it’s slightly charred on the outside but pink and marbled on the inside. It’s served with salt and garlic on the side so I can switch things up along the way.

Highly recommend getting some sides like the creamed kale to pair with the steak. Kale came with generous sauce that I ate together with some of the steak and it was yumsss."
juicy beef with delicious sides,"First time at this steakhouse and we had the Denver wagyu steak which was real tender and juicy, those who prefer fatty cuts would enjoy. Alongside creamed kale which was an amazing complement to the steak. We ended on a sweet note with a strawberry cheesecake although the strawberry compote was a tad too sour. Everything else was splendid!"
Great Steak,"Heard great things about their wagyu steak, which didn't disappoint but I was especially impressed by their sides. The fried camembert with truffle honey was a great mix of sweet and salty to kick off our meal.

If you're looking to get veg, I would recommend getting the creamed kale to pair with your main. Had the house baked cheesecake to finish and I would honestly come back just for this dessert!"
Quite expensive,The steaks are good but they are no where the quality of Morton’s or cut when you do a price comparison . The starters are nothing special .
Fantastic food and service!,"Fantastic food and service! The fried camembert was strange yet endearing to taste. Never tried something like that before but it was interesting on the taste buds. The broccolini and cream kale were both pretty nice, and if u hate veggies, these are veggies i actually didnt mind eating much. Of course, we cannot forget the steaks, fantastic denver and deckle wagyu steaks, amazing with the salt (kosher salt i think?) and juicy. Ended off the meal with a cheesecake, which was lovely. Recommended for a night out :)"
Amazing experience!,"The service was amazing by the waiters, and the ambience was wonderful. the Fried camembert and sauce were a very interesting combination and went well together. The wagyu steaks were juicy and succulent, and paired well with the garlic and salt. The broccoli and kale complemented the sauces brilliantly and were wonderful side dishes with the steaks. The cheesecake was a sweet finisher for this wonderful course. I would definitely recommend coming here!"
Great food great ambience,"An awesome dining experience and service with top tier quality food Had such a pleasant plethora of steaks and sides, best steaks I've had in a while, hands down. Don't be shunned away by the ""lesser known cuts"" because this very phrase may just blow you away! Loved everything we ordered ❤️

Full of flavour and juices,Ate here with my date and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Everything was full of flavours and the ambience was classy and wonderful. Had high expectations and it really did not disappoint. Their wagyu steaks are a must try and the creamed kale and fried camembert are highly recommended as well!
Original taste Steak near Botanic Gardens MRT,"The steakhouse have cosy ambience, nice place. located near Botanic Gardens MRT, easy to reach the steak is really superb, very tender and unforgetable Good place to chills with friends and family"
Really good steak,"We had the wagyu steak at the Botanic Gardens outlet and it was really juicy and soft, really loved it! The vegetable sides were very tasty too and went well with the steak"
Great food and ambience!,Highly suggest this place!! The food is very generous and the chef is very friendly in sharing their knowledge with us! The quality of the food is extremely delicious and tasty.
Good steakhouse near botanics,"Decided to try out this restaurant as it was conveniently located near botanics, and i was amazed at the quality of steak both decker & denver served! Ordered the set meal. The quality of starters, sides and dessert were quite good as well. Personally loved the steaks, the starters and dessert."
Lovely Steakhouse in Bukit Timah,"I was blown away by the great food here, and especially loved the fried camembert with truffle honey. The wagyu steak was also good, albeit a little too rare for my taste. Despite that, it was still tender and tasty, especially with a dash of sea salt. Would recommend this place for a date, night out with friends, special occasion or if you're simply craving good wagyu steak. It's also centrally located in Bukit Timah, just a short walk from Botanic Gardens MRT station."
Aus wagyu steak on flames. Need I say more.,"Had a chill dinner at FBS yesterday, right beside Botanic Gardens. Great vibes, the steakhouse was filled with idle chatter from the different groups of patrons enjoying their food and their night. The fried camembert paired with truffle honey was genius as a starter, the truffle scent and sweet aftertaste successfully whetted our appetites for more. We followed with the Denver Wagyu and Deckle Wagyu steaks, which were both beautifully marbled and grilled just right on charcoal (we managed to catch a glimpse of the chef preparing our steaks in the open concept kitchen complete with a mini fire show. Didn't manage to catch photos, unfortunately). The spice from grilled broccolini side managed to cut through the fat from the steak while still standing on its own, a great dish prepared. Had the house baked cheesecake to complete the meal, the passionfruit sauce was tart and refreshing and hit just right after the great meal."
Well Cooked and Tasty Dinner,"We began the meal with a duck confit popiah, which was freshly fried and tasty. The charred Caesar was okay, though the missus’ said her piece was rather bland. Mine was okay, with quite a lot of grated cheese.

The Jack Creek wagyu flat iron steaks were flavourful and mostly juicy, and the chefs were not afraid to use salt, which helped to boost the taste. We loved the mash, with the slight truffle taste. Desserts were a generous portion, and I liked the house baked cheese cake - it was tart yet sweet from the berries and mango jus. My wife liked the tiramisu as well.

We had seats at the bar, and you could see the smooth and organized way in which the kitchen was run. Our young waitress with glasses was also friendly and careful, saying things like, “I am behind you. Can I put the cultery or help to clear the plates” etc"
Eugene's review of Fat Belly,"The restaurant has good ambience, service and food. With close proximity to botanic Gardens MRT Station and Botanic Gardens itself, it is relatively easy to get to. In relation to food, the wagyu steaks are worth trying. I had the 2GR full-blood wagyu ms 6/7 Denver and the Jack's creek fi wagyu ms 4/5 Deckle."
100 Days Anniversary,"Great wagyu denver steak, great experience trying out secondary cuts of steak. So, the restaurant explained to us what is the key difference between the steaks before we started the meal. I can’t say this for other people but I love to know more about what i eat. We also managed to have a nice walk at botanic gardens after the meal :)"
Steakhouse Date Night~,"Went to FBG with my boyfriend for our date night and it's amazing! Located conveniently next to Botanic Gardens, we were able to take a stroll in the park after our meal.

We ordered the 2g full-blood MS Wagyu MS 6/7 Denver and Jack's Creek F1 Wagyu MS 4/5 Deckle, and it was so so amazing?! It was so flavourful and tender. We love it, and also appreciated the chef's detailed explanation of preparation of the steaks. Highly recommended if you're looking for a quality steakhouse!"
Hidden Gem @ Botanic Garden,"Fat Belly SG
A short 5min walk from Botanics Garden got me and my boyfriend stumbling upon this fantastic steakhouse that served us this flavourful, juicy and tender medium-rare steak that was perfectly cooked and seasoned. We ordered a 2gr full-blood Wagyu MS 6/7 Denver and a Jack’s Creek F1 Wagyu MS 4/5 Deckle for both of us to dine. There was salt given to us on the side for those who wants to have every mouth packed with more flavour, but the meat itself was already so mouth watering even without it. I also got to try their fried camembert, grilled broccolini and creamed kale to share with my boyfriend and I have to say I was super impressed with it. We started off with the fried camembert which was paired with pickled jalapeños and truffle honey. The truffle smell was so strong that it was there in every bite. The combination between the saltiness of the camembert cheese and the truffle honey was very new and intriguing to the tastebud. Highly recommend to try if you’re interested in the pairing. The creaminess of the kale was just nice and it was not “jelak” at all, which was a good pair to the steak. The grilled broccolini added a refreshing taste to the overall experience as well but we still preferred the creamed kale more. We ended our meal with a house baked cheesecake which was topped with wild strawberries compote and gold flakes which was fancy and also yummy! It was a good overall experience and I would definitely be back there to try more of their food."
Good vibe for dinner date,"Found this at Botanic Garden just 5 minutes away from the MRT. We ordered the fried camembert and were amazed by the complex flavor and texture. The crispy layer contrasts with the soft and flavorful camembert cheese, with the truffle honey dipping sauce, it serves as a wonderful starter for the dinner.

I ordered the wagyu steak and Kale salad. The roasted garlic compliments with the steak very well brings out the original flavor of the beef. The creamy kale balances out the meat nicely too.

The cheesecake with berry compote that we ordered has a rich flavor which helps to end the night on a good note"
Cosy romantic dining experience at Fat Belly,"The steak was perfectly seasoned and tender. Also loved the cheesecake which tasted really creamy and clean, great way to end the meal!"
Yummy steak!,Both cuts of the steak were juicy and cooked to perfection. The side of vegetables were also really unique!
Belated Birthday with Wife Natalie and Beef,"Good place for casual dining , wife Natalie choose this place for her belated birthday celebration and pair with limited 2016 Barolo ."
Steakhouse @ Bukit Timah,"Found this secluded lil steakhouse a few minutes from Botanics MRT - and I got to say it was AMAZING.
.
Staff service was amazing and despite the small little space the interior design and dim lighting sets a nice ambience!
.
Fried Camembert w Truffle Honey
Seemingly mediocre like fried aracini balls, this was really good and that truffle honey - was a game changer! The honey was mild but the truffle taste and smell was so strong, it lingers in your mouth!
.
Jack's Creek F1 Wagyu Deckle Marble Score 4/5 (200g)
The score 4/5 represents the amount of marbling and with just this - the beef was already so good! The fats are more visible and if you like your meats more soft and chewy with a soft melty feel in your mouth - this is the one to go!
.
2GR Full-Blood Wagyu Marble Score 6/7 Denver (200g)
This is my ultimate fave! It has a higher marbling score so it seems as though there is very little fat, but its just more well distributed throughout the meat! And it gives a more lean and less chewy texture, making it easier to bite off.
.
Both secondary cuts of meat were simply grilled till medium rare, served with raw salt and melty roasted garlic. Simply amazing!
.
Grilled Broccolini
This was served well charred with chili and anchovie emulsion - so so GOOD! The chili sauce was a lil spicy with some curried flavours!
.
Charred Gem Lettuce
Served with some spicy yoghurt dressing mixed in with a unique blend of spices like dukkah. Its so good and given that both vegetables are grilled, it is less oily and helps cut out from the fattiness of the beef.
.
House-baked Cheesecake
Served with berry compote, was so so good! A good closing for the amazing mains.
.
All in all a blast of an experience! Would highly recommend others to come to this place for a cute date night in this small cozy steakhouse!"
Fat Belly Food Review,"Went to Fat Belly (near Botanic Gardens MRT) for dinner today which was a really enjoyable and unique experience. We were served the set menu which consist of the Fried Camembert with pickled jalapeno and truffle honey which tasted really good and the truffle smell was very fragrant as well! For the mains, we had two kinds of steak, namely, Jack's Creek F1 Wagyu Deckle and 2GR Full-Blood Wagyu Denver which i like them both as they were both juicy and tender :) The vegetables sides which include the grilled broccolini and charred gems both paired very well with the steak and their dressing had an exquisite taste as well (Chilli & Garlic for broccolini and Spiced Yougurt Dressing for the charred gems). The meal ended well with the dessert which is the house-baked cheese cake with strawberry compote which i thoroughly enjoyed too! Overall was a fantastic experience!"
Amazing Steakhouse!,"FBG is a great steakhouse for everyone. Great location as you can have a stroll in Botanic Gardens before enjoying steak at FBG. We had Fried Camembert to start. I’m a cheese lover so I really enjoyed it. Dipping it with Truffle Honey really made the taste even better. We also had Kale Salad and Broccolini as our sides. They had very interesting taste. The Kale Salad was so creamy and I just felt like I needed more of it! We had Denver and Ribeye steak as our mains. It was medium rare. Loved it! We also ordered Aperol Spirit as they had 1 for 1 special on Monday. Overall, I would recommend this to everyone!"
Best Steak Ever,"We tried Meadesmoore and loved it so much we had to try the sister outlet FBG (Fat Belly). It is also a steakhouse located beside Botanic Gardens mrt (a short 3 mins walk - super convenient!). They have outdoor seatings if you like a nice alfresco dining.

We had the Fried Camembert for starters. If you like mozzarella sticks or anything cheese, you will love this. It is lighter, softer and creamier (no cheese pull though). Paired with truffle honey dip, super addictive!

On to our main course, we had 2 different cuts of steak. Denver and Ribeye, Denver is fattier but if you are like me who prefers a good balance of fat and lean meat then ribeye will be great. Both are super tender and juicy. Honestly one of the best steaks i have had and i am really picky. You know the steaks are that good when no sauce is needed, just a dip in some salt - perfection.

Of course, not forgetting our sides we had creamed kale and grilled broccolini. Both vegetables i do not usually order but it was really flavourful and had a nice crunch.

Ended our meal with their Tiramisu which i tried at meadesmoore and loveeed.

Overall, i highly recommend this place. You need to try their steak for yourself!"
Great Food and Excellent Experience,"FBG is a steakhouse conveniently located beside Botanic Gardens MRT. It has excellent ambience and service. Being seated right in front of the open kitchen brings a nice view of the food being prepared which really elevated the experience.

Fried Camembert was the starter, which was served with pickled jalapeños & truffle honey. The Camembert was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The truffle honey was really unique and pleasantly surprising and paired nicely with the cheese. The sides were Grilled Broccolini and Charred Gem Lettuce. The former had a nice subtle lingering flavour with its dressing, while the latter had a more impactful flavour and all its ingredients came together wonderfully.

Jack's Creek F1 Wagyu Deckle and 2GR Full-Blood Wagyu Denver were the main course. Also ordered the Aperol Spritz to whet the appetite. Both cuts were soft and juicy and almost melts in the mouth. Really flavourful and took no time at all to finish.

Finished the meal with the House-Baked Cheese Cake, expertly decorated with the strawberries compote. The richness of the cheesecake contrasted nicely with the sweetness of the sauce.

Would certainly come here again for special occasions."
"Decadent Steaks, Amazing Experience","Located right next to Botanic Gardens MRT, in the heart of Bukit Timah, Fat Belly is a cozy steakhouse that serves some of the most mind-blowing steaks I have ever tried, complimented with some spectacular sides.

We started off with Fried Camembert ($17), which was served with jalapenos and truffle honey. The cheese had a wonderful crisp exterior while still being delectably gooey inside. But the star here is the truffle honey; a very strong black truffle flavor complemented the sweet honey and camembert..

The two steaks we ordered were the Jack's Creek F1 Wagyu Deckle (rib cap) MS (marble score) 4/5 ($58), and the 2GR Full-Blood Wagyu Denver (underblade) MS 6/7 ($62). Both had a crisp, charred exterior while maintaining a juicy and tender interior. Both cuts were bursting with decadent flavor, the wagyu being well-marbled and clean on the palette. Full of flavor from the fats and marbling, these cuts were magnificent, and I would highly recommend them!

The sides we had were the Grilled Broccolini ($14) and Charred Gems ($12). Both were charcoal-grilled vegetable dishes, and the charred gems were served with an exceptionally spiced yoghurt dressing with reminded me of curry. They were great antitheses to the charcoal-grilled meats.

The meal was rounded off with the House-baked Cheesecake ($12), which was served with a strawberry compote and gold leaf. The cheesecake was rich, and when complemented with the strawberry and passionfruit sauce, made for a wonderful finish to the meal.

While the food here was extremely tasty and enjoyable, the prices are undeniably steep, thus a visit to the restaurant would be perfect for special occasions. The interior was chic and stylish, while maintaining a cozy atmosphere with the warm and slightly dimmed lighting, which makes for a great setting for dates. I would definitely come again if given the opportunity!"
Great food great place!,"I must I enjoyed the food so much that I want to head back again! I like how the location was so convenient and near Botanic Garden. I loved how I got to see the chefs in action!

The Fried Camembert was amazing, I love how soft the cheese was and how it melts in your mouth! The BEST PART would be the l Jack’s Creek F1 Wagyu Deckle Ms! The meat was so tender and chewy that I can’t forget the taste.

Lastly, to end off the desert house-baked cheese cake was so soft, and I loved how the the cheese matches so well with the strawberries compete!"
Phenomenal food at Fat Belly,"It was a magnificent experience being at Fat Belly. Staff were super friendly and served us the food pretty well. Atmosphere was fantastic, good vibes in it. Me and my partner were sitted at the bar top table where we get a chance to see the chef doing his masterpiece, cutting steaks and making the food.

Our first meal was the Fried Camembert, it is filled with cheese and it taste amazing. There was also the truffle honey sauce as a side, which when mixed together with the Camembert it taste super good.

We had 2 types of Wagyu, one was the Jack's Creek F1 Wagyu Deckle and the other one 2GR Full-Blood Wagyu Denver. Both tasted fantastic. The full blood is my favourite due to the fact that it is easy to chew and it is very tender. For the jack's creek it is very chewy but it taste pretty good too.

The sides will be the grilled Brocolinni and Charred Gems, both of the sauce of the sides were well made as it taste good. For the charred gems , the sauce reminds of me of the satay sauce. Mixed together with the Charred Gems, I think it is a decent combination.

Lastly, for desert we had their house baked Cheese Cake, and it taste magnificent. The cherry at the sides combine with it makes it very nice to have as a desert.

Overall, we had a great experience and certainly enjoy the food at Fat Belly!"
Great Steakhouse,"Dropped by Fat Belly with a friend on a weekday night.
Love that it is located in a relatively quiet area near Botanic Gardens. Great place to hang out with friends after work. Staff around were very friendly and I loved the open kitchen concept where we can see our food being prepared.

To start off, we got the toasted sourdough bread and the fresh Italian burrata cheese. The burrata cheese is a must get - light, creamy and slightly tangy from the balsamic vinegar. Goes great on top of their sourdough bread.

For mains, we had their 2GR full blood wagyu MS 6/7 Denver as well as the auskobe wagyu MS 4/5 Deckle, together with sauteed thyme mushroom medley and charred broccolini as sides. The beef was perfectly done - nicely charred outside while still tender and juicy inside. It was flavourful enough that we did not even need much sauce over it.

Did not expect much from the 2 sides but was pleasantly surprised by the charred broccolini. Loved the flavour of the pink peppercorn and it goes really well with the steaks.

For dessert, we got the american cheesecake. Plating was gorgeous with a flake of gold leaf on top. Love the combination of cheesecake and passion fruit gel as the sourness of the passion fruit helped to balance out the sweetness of the cake.

Portion sizes were substantial and both of us barely managed to finish the food.

Overall a great dining experience and would totally visit again to try other dishes!"
Great food and ambience,"Really enjoyed the burrata, toasted sourdough and steak! The cheesecake was also extremely delicious. Lovely staff and great atmosphere. Would definitely visit again!"
Get the denver steak!,"Cosy steakhouse at botanic gardens. Love the open kitchen concept. Though if you prefer a traditional table over the bar counter, you could still ask for it!

2022-05-03 dinner
Burrata and sourdough - Good. Sourdough was quite airy which i liked. The bread was mildly toasted, which gave it a perfect texture. The burrata was nice but unremarkable
Denver steak and deckle steak - Excellent. The steaks have a punchy, upfront flavor which i loved. They were highly marbled with lots of flavorful fat. The deckle, however, was tougher. I would recommend sharing one steak among two pax (with other sides)
Broccolini - Garnished with whole pink peppercorns, which complimented surprisingly well. The charred flavor carried by the sauce was delicious.
American cheesecake - Sourness of the berries sauce provided a refreshing contrast to the familiar cheesecake"
Premium Steak at affordable rates,"A hidden find - one that Im thankful to say I have been before once pre-covid, so as restrictions eases, I decided to bring the gf over to have a go once again - and they sure didn't disappoint.

The cuts available - unique yet delectable. The sides (creamed kale, broccolini, and the sautéed mushroom medley) complemented each other well. Service was good as usual, and we ended off with a classic American Cheesecake that was right up my alley.

Would definitely recommend a trip here for good steak that wont hurt the wallet."
Steakhouse at Botanic Gardens,"Cosily tucked between residential neighbourhoods and botanic gardens, is a cosy steakhouse that serves up gorgeously charred and tender steaks. Their 2GR Full-Blood Wagyu and Auskobe Wagyu - though both were secondary cuts of beef, we thought were perfectly seasoned and cooked (medium rare). We miss the fragrance of the beef already! We opened our meal with their warm toasted sourdough bread paired with their Burrata Cheese (Balsamic Vinegar completes it!) - these definitely whet our appetite. Can't go wrong also when you order their Thyme Mushrooms for sides, but also do try out their Creamed Kale, the cream sauce blew our taste buds and we loved it! Will surely return for more as it was a pleasant experience : )"
Good steak good ambiance,"The restaurant is located just a short walk from Botanic Gardens station and has a nice cozy ambiance.

Selection of food is pretty good. My partner and I tried their Denver Wagyu steak and the Auskobe steak which came in a perfect medium rare (not often seen in many singapore steahouses) and we paired it with with a bottle of red wine . The staff were really friendly and gave us recommendations, even allowed us to sample before purchasing the bottle. The steaks are soft and have a good blend of fat and meat which allows them to melt perfectly in your mouth.

Ended the night with the Basque cheesecake which was really soft and creamy.

Place is great for dates and I would totally come back again."
Wonderful sumptuous dinner,Had a wonderful and sumptuous dinner at the steakhouse near Botanic Gardens. The meal starters is simply mouthwatering. We started off with fragrant bread slices paired with thick and creamy cheese. We were then given the main course which comes with 2 types of steak: the regular one and wagyu as well as sautéed mushrooms and western broccoli. The steak is a medium rare and simply melts in your mouth. It has a slight charred fragrant which makes it really nice. We were then served the dessert which is a slice of cheese cake topped with passionfruit and berries sauce. Had a enjoyable time at the restaurant. The staff there were really welcoming and friendly and attended to us very promptly.
"Relaxing Atmosphere, Amazing Food","Visited on 19th April, located conveniently just next to Botanic Garden MRT. For starters, I had the Toasted Sourdough Bread with Fresh Itallian Burrata Cheese. The sourdough was toasted to perfection and generous portion of cheese was given that is perfect for 2 pax.

For mains, I tried the 2GR Full-Blood Wagyu MS 6/7 Denver (200g) and the Auskobe Wagyu MS 4/5 Deckle (250g). The steaks were cooked to perfection being crispy on the outside, soft and tender inside.

The sides (Sauteed Thyme Mushroom Medley and Charred Broccolini) were also well-seasoned and complemented the mains perfectly.

For dessert, I tried the American Cheesecake; the sweetness of the cake pairs well with the berries compote and passion fruit gel. Overall, FBG definitely expected my expectations in terms of service and food! Highly recommended!"
"Delicious, classy and cosy!","Food was delicious, with a classy cosy ambience and kind responsive staff to match!

Toasted Sourdough Bread— not too soft, not too crunchy, just nice
Italian Burrata Cheese— fresh and well-seasoned

2GR Full-Blood Wagyu MS 6/7 Denver and Auskobe Wagyu MS 4/5 Deckle (Medium Rare)— tender, well-seasoned, charred a beautiful dark colour and has the right amount of that rich, smoky flavour from the grill

Sautéed Thyme Mushroom Medley and Charred Brocollini— both of these went down fast; fresh, nicely seasoned, and a good complement to the steaks

Basque Burnt Cheesecake— was super delighted to get this as cheesecakes are my favourite, and this did not disappoint. Loved the play between the hard burnt top layer and the soft, creamy goodness below!

Though the prices might be a bit steep, I think that this quaint place is well worth it! Would recommend coming here for date night :)"
"One set menu for the price of two, for two. Disappointing.","We had the set menu for two, consisting of a burrata, a NZ zabuton steak with two sides (Mashed potatoes and mushrooms) and an apple croustillant for dessert. The set costs $188++. Consider our surprise when we received one small ball of burrata to share, and then one apple thing for afters.

If you order to burrata off the a la carte menu, it would cost you $23. The apple dessert $12. The sides $7 and $8 respectively. That means we effectively paid $148 for the steak.

And that is just a bit rich / too much given that it was fine, but nothing so extraordinary to warrant such a high price tag.

We could have order the same or better at the Origin Grill in town and still paid less, and that’s in a real fine-dining atmosphere where everything is top-notch.

To pay $188++ here for what is essentially a set menu for one with a large meat portion, but to be lead to believe it was meant for two, was really rather disappointing, even if the place as such seemed nice enough in many other ways. Shame, we won’t be back."
Good steakhouse near the Botanic Gardens,"The restaurant is very near Botanic Gardens, around a 5 minutes walk from the MRT station. For the starters, I had the Toasted Sourdough Bread with the Fresh Italian Burrata Cheese, i really like the sourdough bread which was warm and fluffy, coupled with the Burrata Cheese that made it even tastier. For the mains, I had the 2GR Full-blood Wagyu MS 6/7 Denver (200g), Auskobe Wagyu MS 4/5 Deckle (250g) as well as two sides (Sauteed Thyme Mushroom Medley and Charred Broccolini). The meat was juicy, tender and flavourful, highly recommend it! For dessert, I had the Basque Burnt Cheesecake which is fluffy and sweet, pairing with the strawberries, passionfruit sauce and almond crumble that further elevate the taste."
Excellent Steakhouse,"This is an excellent steakhouse which is located near the Botanic Garden. Good atmosphere and attentive service provided by staff. We started off with the Fresh Italian Burrata cheese with toasted sourdough bread which was deliciously toasted. For the main course, we had the 2GR Full-Blood Wagyu MS 6/7 Denver and Auskobe Wagyu MS 4/5 Deckle where each piece of flavorful meat simply melts in your mouth. The Basque burnt cheesecake was a great way to end the meal which has the perfect blend of sweetness and creaminess. Overall, a very pleasant experience at Fat Belly."
Now called Meadesmore. Great steak at a hefty price.,Nice ambiance and service. Surprisingly poor starters and sides considering the steaks are $150 each. We didn’t get a chance to have them together as the sides came after the steak but they really didn’t go with steak anyway. The beef tomatoes were poor. Steak tartare reasonable. The Australian Steak was superb however. This was very close to a 3 star review but the steak was very fine.
for casual date night,"Had dinner service and will rate this place worth a visit. Meal is portioned well and good for two people. The main star of the evening were definitely the steaks, Denver and Deckle, which were both fatty and succulent. The charred broccolini was well done and the stem bits weren’t over cooked. The cheesecake was an amazing way to close the meal and it was just a plate of creamy goodness."
Yum Yum Yum,"Food and service was excellent. As you can see from the marbling of the meat, the Denver and Deckle were as succulent as wagyu steaks come. Even though I'm wearing braces, I didn't have an issue biting into and enjoying the meat. The burnt cheesecake was a nice touch for a sweet end to the meal. My favourite was the appetiser of burrata cheese and toasted sourdough bread, the balanced pairing of the slightly sweet cheese with the slightly sour bread and fresh tomatoes was a perfect appetiser, although I may also have been extra hungry haha. All in all, highly recommend!"
Good date idea,"The atmosphere of this place is comfortable but still maintains a sense of class. Great place to bring a date. Food is well cooked, steak cooked to right temperature and sides are amazing. Drinks are also available if you want to stay and chat."
Awesome!,"A very cosy place with awesome food we had the sourdough toast with burrata cheese as starters and I absolutely loved it. The toast was so good and the cheese was creamy, together they were perfect. We had the Deckle steak and the Denver steak, with Charred Broccolini and Thyme Mushroom as sides. I really liked the Broccolini personally. We finished off our dinner with the cheesecake which was also amazing in my opinion. Overall, a very pleasant experience at Fat Belly and will definitely visit again."
Best steak dining experience ever,"Located near Botanic gardens, the restaurant is easily accessible as it was only 5 minutes away from the MRT. The ambience in the restaurant was just right for anyone on date night or dining out at somewhere fancy.

For starters, we had burrata with sourdough, where the sourdough was so well toasted and burrata being creamy and light, it really takes your breath away. The sides we had was Mushroom and Broccolini were also equally delicious, even for me who is extremely picky with mushrooms, since this one was made soft and chewy, it was addictive!

My favourite has to be the main though, they boast their selection of high quality alternative cuts and we were spoilt for choices. We got ourselves the Wagyu MS 6/7 Denver cut and MS 4/5 Deckle cut, both of which were were so soft, tender and it melted right in my mouth, I love it so much! They were also very generous with the portion for all the mains and sides.

For dessert, we just had to try their famous burnt cheesecake, so we ordered them and it was super soft and creamy that it reminded me of those that I had in Japan.

Lastly, really thankful for the staff for being so attentive and being patient to explain to us their specialties. The overall dining experience was superb and I could not have asked for a better night. Hope to pop by again in the near future!!"
Great place to chill with a glass of wine and delicious food,"The restaurant was located quite conveniently with Botanic Gardens MRT in the area, quite easy to find.

I tried their burrata cheese with sourdough toast. Loved the burrata cheese and it went really well with the toast. The star of the night was definitely the steaks. Tried the denver and deckle cuts both at medium rare. Both steaks were juicy and flavourful and I was satisfied with the portion as well. The steaks came with sides and I think the broccolini and mushroom combination was great. The broccolini helped even out the meatiness of the steaks, while the mushrooms were well-seasoned. We ended our dinner there with basque cheesecake for dessert. It was good, but the star was definitely the steaks and the sides.

I really enjoyed having wine with the steaks too, really liked the Malbec that I ordered. I would say the pricing is definitely on the steeper side, but you do get what you paid for in terms of quality. Overall, would definitely recommend to try, great for dates too."
Lovely steak and great vibes,"This is one of the best steak I’ve had the whole year, and to my surprise with their alternative cuts! Located at serene centre in Bukit Timah, the place is easily accessible from the MRT. For starters we tried the burrata with sourdough, the sourdough was deliciously toasted! The sides i had (mushroom and broccolini) were also amazing, even my boyfriend who doesn’t like mushrooms agreed these were delicious. And the beef (denver and deckle) was out of this world, so tender and well seasoned. Dessert was basque burnt cheesecake which had a lovely caramelized crust. This place is perfect for celebrating special occasions and also has a great ambience for dates. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to impress with top notch beef!"
Amazing steak paired with Amazing Service,"Finally got the chance to visit this cozy place situated 5mins walk away from Botanic Gardens, and it was AMAZING!

When we first entered, we were greeted warmly and ushered to our seat. On top of that, service was very prompt and our water was refilled regularly without having to ask for it.

For starters, we had Toasted Sourdough Bread and the Fresh Italian Burrata Cheese.

The highlight of the meal was definitely the main, which was two different cuts of Wagyu steak. The cuts of steak were very well chosen as it was a perfect blend of fats and lean meat. They were also cooked to perfection, a nice medium rare, and the juiciness was very well preserved. It had two sides to go along with it which were the Sautéed Thyme Mushroom Medley and Charred Broccolini. The sides were a nice touch as they added variety to the flavor of the steak.

To end off this delicious meal, we had the Basque Burnt Cheesecake for dessert. The cheesecake simply melts in your mouth and was gone before we even realised.

Although the price is a little steep, the quality of the meal fully justifies it. We will definitely be back for special occasions :D"
Great Steaks,"Came here with a good friend for a dinner and it was an overall excellent experience. It is just a few mins walk away from Botanic Gardens Mrt. For starters we had the toasted sour dough bread coupled with the Italian Burrata Cheese. The cheesy taste and creamy texture of the Burrata Cheese was a good complement to the sour dough bread. For the mains, we had a generous serving of Wagyu beef steak which was served in flavourful bite sized cuts. The sides to go along with it included sauteed mushrooms and Charred Broccoli which were very tasty on their own. The desert we had was the Basque Burnt Cheescake which was quite unique. It was cripsy on the outside while being super soft and creamy on the inside. We were very satisfied with the service quality of the staff there, would definitely patronise again!"
Wonderful Steakhouse with Fantastic Food and Service,"Passed by this place before as it’s at Serene Centre (which is right outside Botanic Gardens), and now I finally got the chance to try it…and it certainly didn’t disappoint at all!

Interestingly, it seems that secondary cuts of Wagyu are used in this steakhouse but you wouldn’t be able to tell just from eating because the steak was done perfectly! Me and my friend got the 2GR Full-Blood Wagyu MS6/7 Denver, and it was juicy, tender, flavourful, and beautifully pink, with just the right doneness. Give it a dash of salt to draw out even more of the flavour. For wagyu fans, this is a must-try!

And what makes it even better is that the sides and desserts are done well too. For appetisers, we got the Fresh Italian Burrata Cheese, which comes with toasted bread. I’m not a fan of cheese, but burrata is probably one of the few exceptions. Smooth and creamy, and lighter than other types of cheese, this dish makes for a lovely appetiser to start off the meal with, especially when paired with the fragrant, crispy toasted bread.

Special shoutout to the Sautéed Thyme Mushroom Medley, surprisingly I loved this as much as the steak! While a mix of shiitake and button mushrooms may not sound impressive initially, mushrooms for me are usually either love or hate, and this one definitely gets a “yes” from me! The mushrooms were plump (if you could put it that way), and fragrant, and it’s a great complementing side dish for the steak. I cleaned the plate in no time. Highly recommended!

For dessert, we got the Basque Burnt Cheesecake, which my friend had her eyes on for a while. Rich yet not overpowering, this cheesy treat is a perfect way to end the meal. As I’ve mentioned I’m not a cheese lover, but I would order this again anytime. I loved the almond crumble that came with it as it added some nice crunch and texture.

The service and ambience was great as well! Whether you’re going for date night, planning to catch up with friends over a meal, or just want a quaint place to enjoy a luxurious meal for 1, this steakhouse is a great choice. Overall we had a very enjoyable dinner, and I definitely don’t mind coming back again!"
Fantastic dining experience with delicious food and friendly staff!,"Fantastic dining experience with the friendly staff and delicious food.

We savoured a couple of dishes - starting from the the impressive fresh italian burrata cheese with toasted sourdough bread. This starter was absolutely appetising and I was really tempted to order a second portion of this.

We settled on Wagyu MS 6/7 Denvor and Wagyu MS 4/5 Deckle as our mains with sides of Charred Broccolini and Sauteed Thyme Mushrooms. The medium rare steak was grilled to perfection and while it was very filling, I couldnt stop eating till it was wiped clean!

Finally the sweet ending featured the basque burnt cheesecake. Cheesecake has always been my family's go-to dessert and Fat Belly did their basque burnt cheesecake so well that I almost wanted to take away!"
Fat Belly’s Tender Wagyu,"Tried the Auskobe Wagyu MS 4/5 Deckle at Fat Belly tonight. It was pink and lean, with juicy wagyu marbling within. I like how Fat Belly cooks its wagyu with minimal seasoning and a dash of salt at the side. Can really taste the pureness of the tender and juicy wagyu"
Cosy Restaurant by the Botanic Gardens,"The restaurant is located in a quiet mall near the Botanic gardens. It is quite cosy there and the service is excellent! The staff are extremely attentive and very friendly to us, we felt at home <3

Starters:

For the starters, we had the Toasted Sourdough Bread which was buttery awesome and the Fresh Italian Burrata Cheese which was quite creamy and light on the palate.

Mains:

For the mains, my friend and I shared two different steaks, which are the 2GR Full-Blood Wagyu MS 6/7 Denver (200g) and the Auskobe Wagyu MS 4/5 Deckle (250g). The steak was so soft and it melted in my mouth, I love it so much! Highly recommend the Auskobe Wagyu MS 4/5 Deckle (250g) which is juicy and soft!

Sides:

We had the Sautéed Thyme Mushroom Medley and Charred Broccolini. The mushroom is rich is flavour and quite soft. The portion is quite large as well for one. The Charred Broccolini was well seasoned with a special sauce on top which I think its what makes the dish special.

Dessert:

We ordered the Basque Burnt Cheesecake, which is just right in flavour (not too sweet). It is super soft and creamy. This reminded me of the Japanese cheesecake which is my favourite!"
Best beef,"Its a great experience. The beef is a definitely must try! Totally no regret and its super good! We ordered the 2GR full-blood wagyu ms 6/7 Denver and Auskobe wagyu ms 4/5 deckle. For sides: we also try the charred broccolini, sauteed thyme mushrooms, fresh italian burrata cheese with toasted sourdough bread( must try pair well with the bread for the cheese) and end with the dessert basque burnt cheesecake. The cheesecake is nice and soft a definite must try too! All in all will be back"
Tasty steaks!,"Went on a Tuesday night. Amazing ambience, not too quiet/noisy. Sat at bar seats which was more dimly lit than the rest of the restaurant. Good number of seats even with safe distancing.

Had toasted sourdough and Fresh Italian Burrata for starters. The bread was so fragrant by itself. Burrata was creamy but well balanced with the cherry tomatoes.

Had the Denver and Deckle with sides of Thyme Mushroom and Charred Broccolini. Extremely flavourful steaks as they are grilled with charcoal! The Deckle had a little more bite compared to the Denver. The pink peppercorns in the charred broccolini really stole the show! Interesting texture and mix of flavor.

Basque Burnt Cheesecake for desserts was a tad too sweet for my liking on its own. Was perfect with the roasted strawberries and passionfruit sauce.

Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a worthy treat for your tummy ^.^"
Highly recommended to visit!,"Their sevice crew are so polite and the food are mouth watering!! Love their beef and their mushroom tasted so good, what a surprise for me 💯 relaxing ambience btw~ would definitely come again (:"
Every dish done perfectly,"Food was super good! Especially enjoyed the burrata sourdough combination. Two cuts for the steak, meat was v succulent and cooked to a beautiful medium rare. Had the cheesecake for dessert as well, the passion fruit glaze had a v unique taste"
Crispy pigs ear,"The 9 course food was amazing. Highly recommend the spicy crispy pigs ear which was pretty addictive and very different from what I’ve tried before.
The steak portion was pretty huge. It was tender and well seasoned with crushed salt.
Really enjoyed the creamed kale, it was saucy and savoury.
Overall, the ambience was fantastic, great for date nights!"
Great food for a memorable evening,"My friends and I enjoyed the experience with the delicious food, nice ambience and friendly service staff. The food was also very well presented. I especially enjoyed the crispy pig’s ear and ox tongue, but the wagyu was a little too rare for my taste. Our evening was wrapped up with some tiramisu and Eton mess, which were both delicious desserts."
