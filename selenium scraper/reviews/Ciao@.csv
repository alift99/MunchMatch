Put Ciao on your list when visiting Arab Street!,"Singapore is choc full of great dining options literally everywhere. We found Ciao to stand out in this very cool area. Physically on Haji, just off Arab, Ciao sits in the middle of a busy side-street offering up great Italian dishes and wines as well. I had an awesome Fettuccini, my wife a Sea-bass as we split a wonderful light Chianti Classico while we enjoyed watching the endless flow of people and live music on this colorful street. Perfect dinner, vibe and weather to sit outside. Enjoy it!"
Such a great wee place.,"Such a great wee place. Great atmosphere and even better food. We had bruschetta, seafood and pizza and it was all lovely. Amazing flavours."
High rating but failed expectations,"A heavily msg infused dinner, pasta not al dente and tiramisu is too soft mainly cream. Air con is not working, overall a disappointing dinner"
Terrific Italian !,Visited this place with my friend and I was pleasantly surprised by the authentic Italian food here. We tried the Salami Pizza and it was fantastic ! The Sughe D Magre pasta was amazing. I later on learnt that three different kinds of fish went into it and I could not have guessed at all and it could have passed of as a vegetarian dish. The decor is from the 60s but in a funky kinda way. The owner and chef Domenica Cicconi is a wonderful host and a terrific cook. He knows his food and he made me feel at home instantly ! Double thumbs up ! Highly recommended !!!
Great authentic Italian,"We went as a family to celebrate birthday. Food was great, portions are big, and owner was very friendly."
We loved it!,"We had an amazing lunch, super warm service from the owner good food, teasty, fresh and the very best Tiramisu desert we had in Singapore. 100% success"
“Colours” to anyone’s mouth.,"Regardless if you’re a tourist or a local; you shouldn’t miss Ciao Ristorante. The owner of the restaurant (Domenico) always plate up a galore of mouth watering Italian food. It’s a hidden treasure in Haji Lane; in the midst of Muslim heritage and Middle Eastern ornaments.

If you say “Ciao” to Domenico and ask him to dish out what his mum cooking today, you’ll be in for a pleasant surprise, cos it’s usually something that it’s not in the menu and it’s 100% home cooked food.

You will never regret it and you’ll definitely visit him again."
Ravioli a,"I had the Ciao@ Pizza, and my friend had the Ravioli di Ricotta. I was surprised by how good my pizza was. It was high quality with a few surprising tastes. My friend was super surprised by the ravioli. She constantly told me how authentic it tasted as she had spent 2 years in Italy as a child through a foreign exchange program. She said it tasted exactly like her Italian grandma made. She guaranteed me that it was legit so we had to make sure. The Chef is Italian. The Sous-chef was eastern-Asian, the daughter of the chef was our waitress. The other waitresses were from Singapore."
Feels like Italy,"Very good. Food was very good and fast serving. Almost feels like being in Italy, specially with the location and the atmosphere"
Not very impressed,"Had a craving for octopus and went down specifically for it. Unfortunately, some parts in the middle of my dish were still cold, and while the texture of the octopus was tender the taste was quite bland. Pizza was very so-so, and the glass of water that they served me had someone else's lipstick remains on it. Won't be returning."
Casual Sunday evening,"As I entered there was loud sports TV covering the most hospitable aspect of this area which is the busking live singers.

A period of trying to gain attention led to my order being taken by a staff member who was so relaxed I wasn’t sure that I’d registered.

Nonetheless the food cane and it was good a pizza and a glass of wine.

My suspicion is that there’s not a lot going on for these guys and they just chill to pass the time. It’s a large place that has limited patronage - nobody cares or makes an effort to encourage people to enter maybe the competition has cornered the market?

Good good / okay - staff lacking enthusiasm.

Bigger question is why?"
Weekend lunch,"I tried some vegetarian dishes here. They have a nice menu with some different options. However, I'm not very impressed with the taste. Service and staff is very good though.

Guys if you're visiting Singapore and looking for good places to eat , there's a page started by my friend all about food @foodfascinatesus on Instagram. Check it out."
Good,We just came to Ciao for drinks. It is good but as everywhere else in Singapore is expensive. A glass of wine (150ml) is 12-16$ and a pint of Guinness is 14$. Italian appetizers and food are available.
"Good ambience, for casual Birthday celebrations. Food a lot they we have packed back.",Food selections is good enough but could have more. Like the ambience and very casual and the music basking add the great feel.
Sunday lunch,Dropped by while in Arab St shopping and had ta great burrata parma and melon plate.. with fresh toasted thin bread .. reasonable prices .. friendly staff.. great atmosphere. Have visited here many times on a Friday evening while cruising Haji Lane.. Love Italian.
Best visited Italian restaurant ever,"Fantastic food and I liked the atmosphere of this restaurant a lot. The Italian owner is a friendly guy with real passion for his work, what you can tast in the food. The wine served really matches the food."
Good Value Italian,"We decided to try out this inner-city Italian nook after a friend posted some very appealing photos of their pizzas and given their thumbs up for Ciao's selection of hand made pastas. This being Haji Lane and the month of Ramaddan, the area was abuzz. The restaurant wasn't full, with only a few tables taken. We were relieved as we had heard that service is slow there.

Thankfully, we were promptly attended to and service throughout the night was not bad at all. We ordered the Bufaline, Pizza Quattro Formaggi and 2 pastas, Spaghetti Carbonara Pancetta and handmade Tagliatelle Bolognese. The pizza was good and the handmade tagliatelle, excellent. Hearty Italian country style flavours that we all enjoyed. Dessert was a tiramisu and a lemon tart that nonna would be proud of. The bottle of Italian red was well priced and lovely except for the fact that it was warm, given the sweltering heat we've been experiencing here in Singapore.

The only thing I would mention as areas of improvement is our service staff who seemed to enjoy debating with us about how red wine should be served or if the spaghetti we had was handmade or otherwise. A warm red wine does not make a pleasurable drink. When asked what the dessert of the day was, he had to make a smart quip "" you know, they change it every day"" (uh-huh) but didn't know what it was and could not say he didn't know."
Always a pleasure,"We've been to Ciao too many times - but every visit is always a pleasure. The owner Donenico always makes patrons feel at home, but more importantly, is his home style cooking that makes you want to come back.
His style of cooking is light - contrary to what most Italian restaurants dish out - and you leave feeling satisfied, not stuffed.
And he is always happy to prepare something out of the menu if he is given advance notice, so that a subsequent visit may offer a different menu experience.
I would definitely recommend Ciao, especially for group dining - the restaurant, while not flash,is homely and cosy, and certainly good value for money!"
great service great food!,The restaurant's food is good and the service is good too! Love how it's in a central part of the city but at the same time there's loads of seating room so theres never a queue. The food arrives really quickly but at the same time i really love the quality of their food. The quality is consistent and I go here often for Italian food! I personally really enjoy the ravioli.
Italian treasure in bustling Haji Lane,"Italian food lovers just have to go here! It doesn’t matter whether you are in the mood for pasta, pizza, fish or meat, the chef (and also owner!) will ensure a mouth watering menu accompanied by a delightful wine, while you sit back and relax, enjoy the life music and the ambience of Haji Lane. Don’t forget to look around in the restaurant as the place is packed with quaint accessories and creative works. Ciao@ will leave all your senses satisfied!"
"Good Food, Passion, and Atmosphere","I was at Ciao@ a couple days ago, and what can i say about the amazing experience. The owner Domenico has an intense passion for great food, and nothing makes him happier knowing that people are enjoying his creations.

Myself and 3 other friend from university in London decided to have a reunion in Singapore since we were all in this hemisphere. After deciding to have Italian for a lazy Sunday lunch we looked up good options, and Ciao@ popped up first, and rightly so. My friends ordered a bottle of wine, but me being portly in stature and lazy this Sunday opted for a beer. Upon meeting Domenico and seeing his love for food, we felt that it was best for us to let the chef decide our menu. He started out with a Octopus carpaccio,drisseled with olive oil and arugula, im not a big fan of octopus unless it is cooked in a particular way, but this was, in a word delicious. Pasta with Italian Sausage. the pasta was cooked perfectly Al-Dente, and the slightly spiced sausage make everything come together beautifully. I have a bottomless pit when it comes to pasta, and though it was just the second course, i gobbled it down endlessly. On to the main course. Coming from India, and the scarcity of good beef you can actually eat, i had an absolute hankering for a steak my whole trip. Domenico without knowing this decided to make our entree finely Braised Beef which sat upon a bead of a delicious onions. (in my opinion the perfect combination). apparently even the onions have been brought over from italy, and they were sweet themselves because of the soil they grew in at the foot of Mount Vesuvious near Naples. Along with this, he brought over a bottle of Italian beer brewed by monks. A strong beer poured into a chalice looking glass, after taking a bite, he instructed me on how to sip the beer to bring out the flavour of the beef. The explosion of flavours in my mouth were mind blowing. I think i ate the whole 'Brasato' myself. I was stuffed, after sipping on a lemonchello we had a neatly packaged tiramisu which really hit the spot. it was time for a nap.

Domenico is a genuine individual who cooks because he loves to see people happy. and the food he makes is Par Excellence. in between courses we discussed everything from politics, to Singapore heat effect on pizza dough, to football. He is Gregarious and a must know in Singapore.

Go try it i guarantee it will be an wonderful experience accompanied with deliciously good food!"
Delicious Pasta,The chef came up with a new pasta; it wasn’t on the menu; it turned the best Tagliolini we ever had. Just let the Chef spoil you.
Great vibe,"Had a good night nice food , pizza was great free entertainment in the lane way , many food options, jazz bars .Good spot."
"Its a ""Surprise""","We continued to explore the Busseroh/Arab Street area and found this place for family dinner tonight. We tried the following:
Ciao Stuzzichino - ham + salad + cheese platter
Brasitino - braised beef stips (a bit like guiness stout stew)
Cotto Bufala Carciofini (pizza-sandwich)
Calzone (Wrapped pizza)
Vongole
Special pasta (fettucine)
Dessert for the day - its a surprise!
Tiramisu

All the items we tried were very nice and delicious. The dessert for the day was really the surprise and highlight for the evening and we decided to take our chances - it is a scoop of basil + lime ice-cream and a scoop of rasberry plated with ladies fingers biscuits, drops of chocolate and strawberry drops. This is first time we are trying BASIL + LIME ice cream - its really an taste bud opener at first taste and it got better after that."
AMAZING FOOD,AMAZING FOOD! i loved the food! we ordered quite a couple of items but the truffle pasta sauce truly stood out!!
What an explosion of taste,We have lived in Singapore for over four years and tonight we have discovered our go to Italian restaurant. Everything from the bread to the desert was absolutely fantastic. The ambiance is fantastic and the service was top notch.
Hard to fault,"Great restaurant serving delicious and authentic Italian..
Reasonable prices and casual atmosphere cam shafe the fact that the food is the real star here.
Had the pork knuckle which was off the charts good, as was the octopus.
Well worth a visit and looking forward to returning."
Disappointed,"Read some good reviews so came here as was staying nearby. Started off badly by being given wine which was off. Meals were very average. Had to go and find a waiter to order more drinks and main meals took ages to arrive so we were glad we ordered some bruschetta to keep us going. I don't like leaving negative reviews but I would not return or recommend.

Hope this is helpful."
One of the best pizzas I’ve tried!,"My boyfriend and I celebrated our pre anniversary dinner at this restaurant! The food was delicious and had the best italian beer, yet! Our server, Deepak was very polite, helpful and gave us good service. We highly recommend this place!"
Our favourite restaurant in Singapore!,"Me and my husband are locals who got hooked on to Ciao@Haji lane since last year. We found this cosy fun restaurant in Haji Lane sometime last year, while looking for vegetarian Italian options. Ciao has now become our favourite weekend food and wine destination. Apart from celebratong our birthdays etc we often invite local friends/visitng overseas friends here when we mean to treat them. The finger foods, cheeses and pizzas are absolutely delightful. And the boss Mr. Domenico is our go-to person for a great wine reccomendation...He suggests amazing wines and great wine n food pairings. The all of it is quite reasonably priced. The ambience and live music are pleasant and the staff very friendly. Also strongly recommend the panna cotta.

Strongly recommend to all who care for some great Italian food, great ambience and nice wine without blowing a hole in your pocket :)"
Center of everything,Visit this place if you enjoy being in the middle of it all. There was live acoustic music nearby. Drinks were decent and their menu was sufficient for a good meal.
Terrible Customer Service,"Tried out this restaurant on Friday keen for some casual Italian and the vibey setting of Haji Lane, am really confused by the good reviews for this place and the disconnect from the experience we had. My husband ordered the pork knuckle for which he was told there was an approximately 20-25 minute wait. That's fine we had a starter to get us going and tide us over for the wait, however, rather than waiting to bring out our dishes together, they brought out my main while we were halfway through the starter and then true to their word my husbands didn't come out for another 25 minutes - which was long after I had finished my meal. The food was average at best, pork knuckle was flavourless and burnt, the limoncellotini cocktail is revolting, the waiter legitimately just walked off halfway through me giving a drink order served another table and then came back so I had to repeat myself, I had to ask for water which never arrived (all the other tables were given water). Really shocked that a place with such good reviews was such a bad experience for us. Huge disappointment."
Nice food and reasonable pricing,"Loving the pizza , pasta and tiramisu !! Also nice venue for those who wish to watch soccer with friends too."
GREAT ITALIAN FOOD IN SINGAPORE,We found the real Italian food taste in Singapore. Excellent food quality and great Italian courtes. Thanks Domenico
Value for money authentic Italian restaurant,"The food was really great. From the starters down to the desserts. Great pizzas, pastas, oh and their tiramisu is really awesome too."
Excellent authentic Italian food,"Ciao! is one of the few excellent and truly authentic Italian restaurants we found in Singapore whose food is equally matched by their service and generosity. Absolutely divine pasta: hand made, al dente, properly salted.
Ciao! is a hidden gem waiting to be discovered. My wife and I went for lunch and were absolutely impressed.
Owner chef Domenico was such a jovial character. He specially oblidged us by preparing something special for our 3 year old and chatted with us about how he ended up becoming a restaurateur in Singapore.
Ciao! certainly won us over as their future repeat customers. Great job!"
Outstanding Italian in Singapore,Having lived in Singapore for a couple of years and frequently coming back as a tourist this is my favourite Italian restaurant on the island. Padrone Domenico provides delicious pasta and pizza and - as I am an expert on this - indeed Singapore‘s best tiramisu
A great fined if you are looking for a slice of Italy.,This really is a splendid location and captures the atmosphere of the Arab quarter. Good Italian food is served here with the bread being made on the premises. A wide choice on the menu but the simple things are best. The freshness and presentation couple with courteous service. The best thing has to be the night time atmosphere in a street full of live music.
Birthday celebrations,"We chose Ciao to celebrate my daughter’s birthday as we have been here a few times and this place is our go-to bistro when we want good food prepared lovingly, served by attentive staff in a colorful and casual ambience

We got the bruschetta followed by a calzone, a pizza with buffalo mozzarella and a special pasta with white asparagus. Every dish was done to perfection. Portions are very large. Come here with a big appetite.

Finished with a tiramisu and a panna cotta.

Chef Domenico is a delight!!! We will return soon. Highly recommend this place."
Lovely slice of Italy,We had a beautifully authentic Italian meal tonight with our teenage children. The owner and his daughter were charming hosts - my daughter commented how they seemed to care sincerely that we have a nice evening with them. We will be back when next in Singapore!
"Be in Italy, be Home!","I’m a regular (weekly) Customer and I must say that Ciao is excellent not just for the food and the people which are both amazing, but because at Ciao you can really feel the Italian family culture and atmosphere. Ciao simply makes you feel home where your mum/grandma (in this case Domenico) is cooking for you!
Lovely..I suggest you leave Domenico to cook something special for you!"
Home sweet home,"This restaurant is a typical Italian place where you can feel like at home. The staff is super nice and the chef Domenico is amazing. The food is very good, real Italian style and the quality of the ingredients is very high. I strongly recommend this restaurant!"
Rude staff and 1 very angry yelling chef.,"I don't know where to begin. I asked from the waitress about an offer they where having, she told me twice that the wine was 20$. When the bill came they charged me for 40$. Asked nicely why the bill is so much. After a while of trying to understand why I was charged double the chef comes from the kitchen screaming I should know that wine is expensive in Singapore. I came 5h ago to the country, how could I know, that's why I asked. And the waitress told twice that it was 20$ from 2 ppl. But somehow it was my fault for not knowing wine is expensive in Singapore.

We asked for water twice but never got it.
We asked for pizza without mushrooms, it came with extra mushrooms.

Overall VERY rude staff and the yelling chef was something I've never experienced before.

Please stay away from this restaurant. Please."
Worst service I have seen,"We went eating at the restaurant as 2 couples and the service was the worst I have seen so far.

- Had promotion for wine for 20$, but ended up with 40$ bill. Gave feedback and was shouted by staff and they ignored the feedback.
- Asked total of 3 times for water, had to go to the counter to finally get it.
- Food was not what we asked. One of four food were sent back to kitchen.

Poor service. Food was ok, but nothing special. Location is decent, as there is plenty of other restaurant worth visiting.

Nothing worth recommending. DONT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!"
A slice of Italy,"Stayed opposite this place at the Park Royal and visited a couple of times for a quick meal.
A restaurent that is actually run by Italians serving typical Italian meals,couldnt really fault it but it certainly isnt in the fine dining category.
Being In Haji Lane it can get quite dirty in the lane itself especially when the rubbish bins are out and overflowing but that sort of adds to the experience,the restaurent itself was very clean.
Again being in Singapore eating out is very expensive with the surcharges and GST added on to the menu price"
Mrs,This really had to be a great wood fired pizza with thin base - it was really yummy 😋 I had the buffalo mozzarella and Parma ham salad which was so fresh and delicious. Will definitely be going back.
Great food and friendly staff.,"This place has very good pizza , pasta and all italian dishes. The staff are very friendly and offer good service."
The best music in Haji Lane,"Fair priced beer, fresh pizza, great music. Two buckets (10 ea) of Budweiser and a prosciutto pizza cost approx $100. Make sure you catch happy hour"
Amazing food,I love the food and service..I have been in Italy and this restaurant is taking you to their Thanks for the chief Abu Ahmad
Rugby team visit Ciao!,I can highly recommend Ciao in Arab St. They accommodated 10 adults and 16 children even before they officially opened. Pizzas and pasta dishes were very good. Thank you very much.
Great food,Great food - asparagus and truffle pasta was excellent. Good menu selection available. Comfortable seating. The owner came to check the meal was enjoyable which was a very nice personal touch.
A gem in Haji Lane!,I was there having the real Italian menu with friends last night. Domenico brought out awesome dishes with great wine pairing. This is definitely a keeper for one of my top 3 Italian restaurants in Singapore! Grazie Domenico. Alla prossima volta! 🤗
My favourite Italian restaurant in town,"Domenico, the owner asked me to leave a review on TripAdvisor. I was surprised he would even care about TripAdvisor because places like CIAO normally gain a lot of popularity through word of mouth. No need of online reviews or anything... We, Italian community in Singapore, are always super fussy about food and we tend to look down at most Italian restaurants but my friends and I simply love CIAO and its environment. I even take my clients from all over Asia to experience authentic and quality food there. Despite the ambience not being what my clients would expect from a business dinner, they enjoy it very much because the experience turns super funny and the food is undeniably good. I don't even want to mention that it is for me the best food in town (after trying so many different restaurants for 5 years). I have read some bad review and we must respect opinions from people from around the world but when I read reviews on Italian restaurants I can only trust Italian reviewers because I know we are horribly picky and demanding. So check on who is leaving the review. Likewise, If I am Italian... and I am, I would never dare to review a Chinese restaurant... Dot!"
Beautiful Pizza in Haji Lane!,Yes - this place we stumbled across in Haji Lane - pizza is delicious and staff are very welcoming! They had great Italian beer and very well priced - we loved it! Recommend you drop in - decor is interesting too !
Good food,Food was fantastic and serving was fast. Servers were polite. It will be better of there were more servers around.
Very good choice for Italian food,"Pasta with truffles and asparagus really was quite excellent. Pizza is decent. Live music was very enjoyable, surprisingly good!"
"Friendly owner, authentic vibe, great food","Had a really late lunch around 3.30pm on a Sunday with my wife. Visited this place as I remembered eating here about a year or two ago and remembering how good the food was. I'm glad to see this place is still open! There were probably only two or three other people eating at this time so late in the afternoon. We were greeted by the friendly Italian owner who recommended items on the menu, one of which was his mother's recipe back in Italy (this pasta called Sughe D'Magre). Food was really good, and having Italian radio playing added to the authentic vibe. Don't miss the Mediterranean calamari! I will be back more often!"
It Was Ok....,"We had a couple of pizzas last week. The pizza's were ok, but, I wouldn't say great. The main thing was quality v price. At $25 and $27, respectively, for each of the pizzas, you kinda expect amazing pizzas. But, they were ok."
Ciao Restaurant Tutti Bene,The Pizzas in this restaurant are the best in Singapore. We were surprised to find such a quality in Singapore.Pizzas were crunchy and NOT BURN as in many restaurant when you look at the back.The atmosphere was good and I definitely recommend it for couples or families.
Terrible food and a worse dining experience,"I'm blown away by some of the positives reviews of this place. Either some of these people have never tasted Italian food besides Spaghetti O's, or this pIace has gone seriously down hill. It was awful. I'm mean really awful. I never bother to write restaurant reviews but this place was so bad I felt that as a service to others I had to. The food is nearly inedible. After we sent back 3 of the 4 dishes we ordered because they were soo bad, the owner came over to yell at us because we didn't like the food. None of us quite knew what to do except I guess apologize to him for the fact that his food was terrible. The restaurant is located in a very popular tourist street, with lots of late night bars, so really we weren't expecting fine cuisine, but it was bad. The chicken tasted spoiled in the pasta dish we ordered, the 'bolognese' was so salty, it couldn't be eaten, and the sauce had that tinny taste like it came from a can. Also, the place is quite expensive for serving such terrible food. We finally gave up and left. Paid over 100 SGD for food we didn't eat and had to apologize to the owner for the privilege of doing so. Stay Away !!

P.S. The people at the table next to us, ordered pizza rather than the pasta dishes we ordered, and they said it was O.K."
The place to eat authentic Italian food,"I never look at the menu; I let the chef Domenico chooses the food and wine (only Italian of course); he surprises us with delicious dishes matching the wine; we never get the same food; all the time different ingredients and flavors.

If you look at the menu, I suggest GRISCIA pasta or SUGHE DI MAGRE; if you like pizza go for TARTUFINA or MAO (actually not in the menu – ask for it).

I sit at the restaurant when I am with clients; it’s quiet there; I stay at the bar if in the mood for live music (I like the singer playing on Wednesday night)."
"Awesome food, service and tunes","I recently moved near Haji and Ciao has become a regular stop. Initially for drinks and atmosphere but now the food as well. The staff is always friendly and knows my regular order of wine and olives.
The pizza is excellent and chef is accommodating and cares that you enjoy your time.
Music from a live performer nightly and loads of fun! You have options on Haji and this one should not be missed."
Food and atmosphere,"Went to Singapore for halidays, good asian food but at ""Ciao"" is possible to indulge in a very fine experience about ""Cucina Italiana"". Feeling at home with chef and owner Domenico, very nice guy. Pasta and pizza are top level, but don't forget to try some plate from Domenico's mum traditional recipes. Very good atmosphere there with live music in a small pedestrian road in the heart of Singapore. Don't miss!!"
Really not Good...,"Went there late night as I was staying nearby and felt a bit hungry.
Ordered 2 small dishes: Fritto del Piceno (is this even Italian??) and the Brasatino. They both arrived pretty quickly. The Fritto Del Piceno did not look anything like the picture in the menu. It was some fried cheese (as announced) and some deep-fried shrimps plus a third component of which I seriously don’t know what it was. It all tasted as if it had survived in the freezer for at least 6 months. Served on a wooden plank (hygiene???) with some tired salad leaves without any dressing at all. The taste was awful.
The second plate was a little bit better. Brasatino - 6 small cubes of braised beef, accompanied of the same sad salad leafs as the other dish, served on the same wooden plank. The taste was actually not too bad, makes me believe that someone in the kitchen actually knows how to cook. Unfortunately the meat was very dry and there was not enough sauce provided.
Overall a very disappointing experience.
BTW: there was a live musician neat the entrance. He was really good!"
High standard authentic Italian pizza,"Tasty and crunchy pizza, good ingredients and cozy place! If you are Italian looking for good food, this is the place.."
Little Italy in Singapore,Dropped into Cia@ for a casual lunch and drink. We enjoyed the casual ambience and friendly service. Had the Beef in red wine and was delicious. They serve gluten free pasta which is great as my wife is Coeliac and not many eateries cater for gluten free. Met the very personable owner and chef Domenico whose personality adds charm to the ambience. Definitely recommend Cia@ to anyone who ends up in Haji Lane.
"Excellent food, nice service.",We had great food here as well as really friendly service. Nice relatively authentic Italian food (you are in Southeast Asia after all!) Definitely recommended.
Diggin’ the homemade pasta!!!,"Surprise surprise! Never thought I can enjoy such great Italian fare at an affordable price in Haji Lane! Popped by when the restaurant minutes after they are opened for business, and the chef-owner welcomed us in warmly. Seeing us sweating like a true blue Singaporean who still can’t stand the heat despite living here for years, he kindly offered us tissues and gave us enough time to settle down before he introduced us to his food. A really sweet gesture to start off the day

Bread was toastily warm and light in texture, coupled with the Parma ham and a light sweep in the olive oil and vinaigrette.... I will leave it for you to imagine Had their homemade pasta in tomato sauce and was pleasantly surprised with the perfectly seasoned taste. Topped the meal off with a complimentary coffee dessert which I regret not asking for the name of it‍♀️ But you know what, just pop by when you are in the area to find out! I am sure the lovely Italian chef will be more then happy to introduce you to his food!"
Excellent lunch outing,"If you are looking for black truffle pizza, this is the place to go to. Authentic italian restaurant with a humorous chef that makes the effort to connect with guests. Love the cheese and tiramisu."
Authentic Italian Food style,"We find it too late! For 2 Italians away from home since 2 years was like a jump back! Original receipe, really fresh ingredient and a wonderful Mozzarella di Bufala! Let the chef give you an original feeling of our country!"
Stopped in for a cool drink.,"We were parched, found Ciao inviting. Chef Domenico explained his specials and we decided to split a pasta dish with our cool drinks. We decided on the hand made ravioli stuffed with spinach and ricotta. The pasta was delicious!

With only a few days left in Singapore we will have to squeeze in another visit to Ciao@."
"Great Chef, Stuff and food","Hi All,
this is my personal comment on the restourant owned by Mr. Domenico, which is a great chef and owner, which bring a really italian flavor in a great location, great food and people.
Pleasure also to become his friend, as well as he came from my same Region in Italy and now far from my hometown, so he perfectly bring me back to there, once i taste his food and pizza.
Thanks Domenico."
Obnoxious chef- 1 star because the caprese was good,"The food is nothing to write home about. The turkey porcini dish I got was so so salty (and I like extra salt), but this was overbearing. The portions were big though.
Now let me come to the atrocious behavior of the Italian (?) chef (?). We had ordered a caprese salad which came at the end of our meal and that too 30 mins after our mains were done with and we had to get up from our table and ask about it TWICE.
We even said that if it's takes longer please cancel. By the time they brought it out my mood and appetite were both ruined. I told the waiter that we won't pay for it. He was fine with it but the so called chef was huffing and puffing up a storm being so rude, condescending and refusing to acknowledge that they screwed up. We said we will pay for everything else but not caprese. His body language was aggressive and he was flailing his arms and yelling saying "" Fine don't pay, don't pay for anything. You are already rich and you will become richer by not paying your $90 bill. But we poor people will suffer because of people like you.....blah blah blah"". We weren't going to be guilted or intimidated into submission by his egregious behavior. There was no apology for the fact the caprese was late. Dude! It takes 2 mins to plate the damn dish.
We said listen you can take the rest of the payment or we can leave it on the counter and walk out- no sweat of our back. It's the principle of the matter. The fact that he needs to do a course on customer service 101 is sad since it's crucial to running a successful business. I appreciate the waiters who were embarrassed buy this guy's behavior and were looking at us apologetically while trying to calm him down. He should learn something from them."
Excellent meal and service,We ate here whilst staying nearby and can recommend it without hesitation. First class Italian food and first rate service made for a lovely evening.
Cheese and Italian beer pairing - Shiok,"Ciao@ is a place to be if you are looking for a relax evening with friends.
* Great people (Domenico)
* Lively atmosphere (we were there on Wednesday and there was live music performed by 2 talented duos - great music)
* Authentic Italian pasta (ask for Domenico's mama+papa recipe and you won't be disappointed)
* Cheese pairing with Italian beer is a must try

Only problem is nothing last forever and we have to head home after a great evening
BUT
We will/can go again and again and again, Ciao :)"
The awesome quality of a real italian home,"Do you want to feel at home eating italian? Do you want to be sure about the quality of ingredients? Do you want to have also a chance to have fun in an easy environment? We found all this at Ciao@: Chef Domenico and his staff offered us in our last visit as always, giving an awesome journey of taste!!!!"
Best tiramisu ever,Nice Italian spot in the middle of arab street. The mozzarella was creamy and tasty but the best by far was the tiramisu!
Starving afterwards,"In all honesty, the quality was a solid 3.5/5. But as a person accustomed to a meal at an Italian place leaving one full and content, this was a serious disappointment. And I mean serious.

The ravioli arrived in a bright yellow bowl with the sumptuous portion of 8 miniture peices of ravioli. Given the bright yellow bowl in which it arrived, I thought they'd mistakenly given me a portion off the kids menu.

Not much more to be said: small portions even by Singapore standards, but definitely at Singapore price levels.

I'm writing this review from the Medican place over the road where I'm having a second dinner that will hopefully do the job that Ciao dismally failed to do."
Amazing Customer Service + Food,Fantastic night at Ciao@! The food was amazing and the staff sang happy birthday to me! Will definitely be back. Highly recommend if you're after a nice Italian meal in Singapore.
Authentic Italian Food,"It was such an enlightening experience to dine at Ciao Sg. I count my blessings to have found Ciao when walking along Haji Lane searching for espressos. Owner/Chef Domenico was very friendly & kind. I came back the same day for lunch & tried their special family recipe, tuna cooked with handmade pasta paired with white wine as recommended by the Chef. It tasted so good! Such comfort food to have, after days of travelling. A few days later, I came back again for dinner. This time, I tried their Margherita pizza, which tasted yum. Overall, food is good, fairly priced, with personalized service & great ambience. I would definitely come back for more. Ciao."
A Special Place to Dine,"An Italian friend living in Singapore took me to Ciao@ for dinner. Chef and owner Domenico is a superb host. We let him choose the dishes (and wine) and it was all perfectly cooked and delicious. Probably better than Mamma makes! Certainly the best Italian meal I have ever had.

A really enjoyable experience was topped of with a great limoncello.

I definitely will go again. Ciao!"
Fabulous lunch with Domenico,"We made our way to Ciao for a Italian lunch with wine. The owner, Domenico, was alone but gave us undivided attention. He recommended wine, dishes for vegetarians, even put bursts on top of our pasta as an extra touch. Everything we had was delicious! I highly recommend this bright spot on Haji Lane"
Amazing overall experience!,"My husband and I (both Vegan's) went over with some friends to Ciao. We had an absolutely amazing time. Not only did Marima,go out of her way to make sure that our dietary needs were met but the food was delicious. Service was great. We're already been back and will keep going back."
Tasty food,"Was there for lunch, had the burrata cheese, Parma ham, melon and salad, a tomato soup and a pasta dish. Enjoyed the appetiser n soup but found the pasta dish on the salty side. Overall ! enjoyable lunch"
"Great food, good value and service",Went for pizza and was greeted with really friendly crew and the pizza was quite decent and reasonably priced
Simple and great Italian,You can find fancier but probably not better tasting Italian traditional home cooking. Excellent👍🏻
Great New Year’s Eve Dinner!,Manager Domenico made us all feel welcome and took his time to ensure each member of the family got exactly what would make us happy. We enjoyed a great authentic Italian meal at a reasonable price.
We love this place,"Best vegetarian calzone in Singapore, great pizzas, entres delicious, great atmosphere, the people who run the place are friendly Italians, the desserts are to die for, good beer and a good selection of Italian wines."
Stunned by the positive results,"Two of us wanted a quick break after shopping in Haji Lane. This was open mid afternoon and we ordered a cafe latte and Campari. The Campari was listed at $8 in the menu, I asked if I could have it with Soda. The loud mouthed Italian said that as this was Singapore, they don’t serve Campari Soda. This was baffling to me, since Campari was already listed on the menu, it suggests that Soda isn’t available in Singapore. After explaining the obvious, this arrived - however the price had now jumped to $15.

The caffe latte arrived in a glass, it was almost white in colour, which means there wasn’t much coffee in it..it also arrived hot which was great, but with a plastic straw which wasn’t so great. Mr. Mouth told us that this is how it’s served in Italy, which isn’t true and I know as my family are from Rome. However there was no point pursuing a conversation with a combative service provider."
The Real Deal,"We wandered down Haji lane after a day of exploring the city, and stumbled on this awesome authentic Italian restaurant. A lot of love has gone into this place. The Italian owner / chef came over to our table to welcome us and to let us know that he had fresh octopus in from Sicily, and had just finished some homemade gnocchi and pesto. We ordered one of each (Octopus carpaccio) together with a pizza and a couple of beers. Amazingly delicious, top notch Italian food. This place is on my list to always visit when I’m in Singapore."
Must Try! Great Taste & Quality Italian Food!,Great place to go for good Italian..Warm Service and Nice Ambiance. Love the Special Squid Ink Octopus pasta and very nice dessert. Live Jazz Music on a Friday night was nice & relaxing.
Friendly & Affordable Italian Restaurant at Haji Lane,"Helmed by jolly Italian Chef Domenico, Ciao is one of our regular dining joints. Nestled along bustling Haji Lane, it serves up authentic Italian cuisine that pleases and is yet friendly to the wallet— the La Pugliese comes with a good-size portion of burratina cheese loaded with Parma ham and a thick slice of rock melon, excellent value at $19. We love a simple Margherita Pizza, and here it is cheesy and comforting with a thick chewy crust. Pastas are done al dente— the Vongole Spaghetti comes in a herbal buttery sauce; but what impresses is the Maltagliati Bolognesi, a handmade flat pasta generously coated with a rich and tasty tomato meat sauce—especially delicious when paired with the bottle of Sartori Montegradella Valpolicella Classico Superiore boasting fruity plum notes."
Among the best on Haji Lane - Surprised its not more crowded,"I come by pretty often to this restaurant, and I dont get why its not more crowded than it is. Its a Italian family-run establishment - the pizzas are awesome - just the right thickness, and crisp, the pastas are tasty. Its just good homestyle cooking.

If you're stuck for options, and if Chef Domenico happens to be around (he seems to be always in), just ask for a recommendation - some days he comes up with something off menu and special, and it always tastes great.

Been to many of the eateries down Haji lane as its close to workplace, and this is among my fav."
Slow service but nice atmosphere,"After our dinner we had a drink in this pub-restaurant in the famous Haji lane. There was a fantastic atmosphere. The service needs improvement it took 5 min before we were presented the dinks menu,…"
The best in town,"This is one of the best Italian cuisines we have ever been too. The best quality, fresh, clean, and delicious pizza and starters.
Staff are more than friendly too, a wonderful experience.
Advice you if u have the option to try it you will enjoy it 100%."
Best place in Singapore for a delicious dinner,"Ciao ticks all the boxes!!! Food wise, the wines, Italian beers, great atmosphere and located in the dynamic area of Hajilane. In addition, the prices are very reasonable. It’s just the place to go to as a family, as a couple or a dinner/drinks with friends. We have been here multiple times and we were never disappointed."
"Great food, bizarrely terrible service","Visited last Saturday as group of 4. I'm pretty sure our service experience was a once-off since it's not consistent with rest of the reviews. We arrived looking for table for 4, and were ""greeted"" by waiter who shrugged and suggested we look to see if a table was free ourselves. We sat down once we found one and seemed to annoy the waiter when we asked to order 15 minutes later.
We did notice the great menu and wine list and friendly italian chef who was entertaining another table.
However, we were stuck with our excuse of a waiter (wearing a backwards baseball hat and looked to be asleep standing up!)
He had to come back to the table 3 times to repeat our wine order and actually opened the wrong bottle. He hit off the next table and broke a plate and glass on the way!
At this stage it was laughable but we enjoyed our dinner when it came. Very good pasta and pizza.
Again, we had to annoy him for dessert menu and we received coffee half spilled over the table.
Overall, great food but bizarrely poor staff experience. No idea how someone like that was hired in first place!"
Great Service,Great restaurant great food great service and great atmosphere. I have been to Ciao about 5 times and it never disappoints. The service is great and the staff will chat and engage with you.
Authentic,Second visit to this restaurant and the service is still what stands out the most. Genuine Italian hospitality - reminds me of my time in Italy. Great wine selection.
First visit,Excellent food. Friendly and helpful staff. Interesting boss. It has a very unique environment. Very condusive for catchups and family meals. Fantastic experience!
