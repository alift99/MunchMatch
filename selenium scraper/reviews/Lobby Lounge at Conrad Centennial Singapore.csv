Before and after covid restrictions were lifted, Conrad lounge has often been our choice.

Special mention to Kalai and Krish who never fail to make our day with their service - professionally consistent and excellent

However, would be ideal if diners are reminded to soften their voice when exchanging conversation"

The savouries are really nice, especially the salmon and mini burger."

Excellent Service and Food,"Went for the Honey Bee Happy Afternoon Tea. Excellent service from Kalai, Linda, and Theresa, thanks for the complimentary birthday cake! Afternoon Tea menu changes monthly, will be back to try other menus again/"
Honey Bee High Tea,"Me and wife went to the Lobby Lounge at Conrad Hotel for the high tea set. It include some savoury items and some sweet items. The sweet items take the shape of fruit. We can also choose a pot of tea and coffee. The ambient is nice and the service is excellent. Highly recommended, especially with the Citibank discount."
Afternoon Tea,"When we arrived we were greeted by a group of friendly staff and offered to change a bigger table for us. They will explain in details of every item on plate and they try to make exceptions on the drinks to cater to kid. The staff also take the initiative to help us take beautiful photos. Food wise I think is a savoury part can increase. It could be better to let the guest know that the session is ending if there is any last order for the drinks as due to manpower shortage it might be out of sight out mind when the staff where not around. Overall the experience is good, thanks to the team Krish, YZ, Kalai, Lemuel, Emmar & Theresa."
