Tasty food and Very good service,Indian Food was very tasty and service was also very good. Lady who was taking order never leaves without adding an extra item to the order.
Worst Service and No sense of Cooking,Food items never tally with recipe briefs mentioned in menu. Arrogant staff. Overpriced. The food items are not served fresh. Better try Al-Azhar nearby to this place to enjoy indian food.
Saag Paneer more like Shrek’s crap,"Customer Service good Food so bad, Don’t know who is cooking it so oily and the saag paneer was horrible. Overall tasted 2/10 Would not go back unfortunately."
Good food and service,Very good Indian food! My mom and dad said it was one of the best they have ever had. Definitely worth paying them a visit!
Great food and Great Service,"Best Indian food I ever had in Singapore. Roshan is one of the staff who is very courteous. Great variety, meal packages available too. Desserts are awesome."
Had terrible experience with,"Had terrible experience with services, while having lunch on 1st January. Have been to this restaurant many times before but have now decided to never go there because of the rude behaviour from one of the staff member. When I asked him to be polite he asked me to go and complaint to his manager.. very bad!"
Yummy food,"Tried this restaurant for our New Year’s day lunch. It was a great choice.

We ordered a few dishes including the Butter Chicken, Fish Tikka Masala and Mutton Seekh Kebab with Tandoori Roti, plain and garlic naan as well as the Lashih Peratha.

Hot favourite was the butter chicken and garlic naan as well as the tandoori roti.

Friendly and helpful staff made the experience even more enjoyable.

Highly recommend."
Will definitely be back.,Will definitely be back. Very tasty North Indian food at relatively wallet- friendly prices. Decent drinks selection too.
Best Tandoori ever at this price,"Fair price and the Tandoori dishes are absoutely the best.
Tandoori Lamb Chops 4 pcs $27, has the wow factor. So does the tandoori prawns. Bhaji, best, crispy, crunchy, tasty.
Those with Woe factor anf not Eow, are butter chicken, a tat too sweet masala tea not great at all. Garlic naan,crispy like prata.
Kashmiri naan a bit flat. But if you order right, you will get a beautiful meal ata very fair price."
Excellent food and services,"After my first bite of the food, I was surprised that it wasn't more crowded. The service staff even gave us tester for a drink that we were not familiar with, making sure that we were comfortable with all the food we order. She made sure to ask our preferences as well so that the food suit our taste buds. Will definitely go there again! 100% recommended :)"
Excellent food,"Very impressed!! Taste, quality and portions - all 10/10. One of the best curries in Singapore for Paneer Tikka. Malai Kofta and Biryani were great. Highly recommended"
Good Indian food,We have had really good meals here and have usually visited for lunch. The staff is very friendly and the chicken meal here is excellent. The pricing is quite moderate considering the location. Will definitely return to this place and recommended restaurant for good Indian food.
Casual Indian restaurant,"Pro tip:
- Recommend the Chicken tiki Masla. Skip the Chicken Tandoori.

While I’ll admit I’m no expert in Indian food, I still feel this places had some decent Indian food and would come back again.

My wife and I were craving Indian food and found Tandoori culture to be the highest rated one in the area.

We ordered the following:
- chicken Tiki Masla (Recommend)
- chicken Tandoori
- Garic naan (Recommend)
- veggie dish (Potato and cauliflower dish)
- Saffron Rice

Chicken tiki Masla was a standard dish for us that was flavorful. The same goes for the Garlic Naan. However, the Chicken Tandoori was excessively dry.

The service was good and they ensured that we had water and were happy with our dishes.

Overall, there wasn’t anything amazing about this place, but rather instead I could see this being a spot to definitely check out to satisfy your Indian cravings.

Price wise, it was on average about $13 per plate.

The ambience is very casual, not recommended for a date night."
Amazing food courteous Staff,If anybody wants Indian food then Tandoori Culture is the best place to have good Indian food.Specially for vegetarians this place is highly recommended. N Neha was very helpful n courteous.
Good food. Great service.,Very good and tasty Indian food. We got two fine dishes to share. Very welcoming and informative service.
Wonderful Indian food served with a smile,"What a nice dinner we had tonite! We started with Masala Papad, Vegetable Samosas! Then Tandoori Chicken and Lamb Mutton Vindallo. This heavenly food melts in your mouth - no kidding! Ended up with delightful Gulab Jamun! Thanks so much to our lovely servers Manpreet and Neha!"
Hidden Gem,"+ small restaurant with a family-like atmosphere
+ absolutely delicious food
+ very affordable
+ polite and lovely staff"
Lovely authentic Indian Cuisine,My wife and I chose to dine here after reading the reviews on TA. The restaurant is situated in a quiet side street off a busy main road. We were greeted by a very friendly young lady who quickly showed is to our table. We were provided with complimentary Popadoms and a Mint Sauce accompaniment. We placed our order of - Vegetable Samosa & Hara Bhara Kabab. Dal Makahani & Veg Chilli Milli with single portions of Plain Basmati Rice & Plain Naan. To say our food was delicious would be an understatement. We are both vegetarian and this food just ticked all the boxes. Absolutely delicious. Can’t recommend this restaurant highly enough.
Perfect place to make friends,"Last night I met my business partner in this restaurant/bar. Great food, cool beers and an amazing friendly supportive staff. I recommend this place very much. Thank you Niha for the amazing service."
Very fine,"After a long hot day we found here a light meal, german beer and very friendly staff. Highly recommented."
very good indian restaurant,it’s a very good indian restaurant. the starters are very tasty and the chicken tikka massala is very tasty
Nice evening out,Good mainstream Indian food and very good service. The family had a good time. All our dishes were good value and tasty. Thank you
Great dinner! Awesome Indian food and service.,"Great dinner tonight at Tandoori Culture. This was my first visit, after initially finding them on Yelp. They did not come up on Trip Advisor, but I found them after digging a bit deeper on TA. All the reviews were great, and now I know why!

The samosas, chicken tikka masala and roti were all excellent. And it was an easy walk from the Westin hotel. Definitely recommend Tandoori Culture. They also have my favorite beer, the big Kingfisher!

Cheers!"
Best Punjabi food in Singapore!,"This place has authentic Punjabi food, reminds you of home when you are away and it tastes really good. All the staff gave ace customer service and were very accommodating. A special thank you to Neha, Manpreet and Samitri who were very polite and kind.

I definitely recommend anyone who is visiting or in the Telok Ayer area to try this place and experience true Punjabi cuisine."
Still great,"It has been about 3 years since we were there but the food and service is unchanged. Soft and juicy tandoori chicken. Generous servings. Friendly service.
This is worth the visit. Highly recommended."
"great service, ordinary food","The restaurant has a pleasant ambience, and the staff were very friendly. It took a short while to negotiate an order, since I was dining alone, I decided on a couple of starter portions, rather than a full plate. Onion Bhajia, Half Tandoori Chicken, and a Garlic Naan (complemented by two small bottles of Tiger Beer) were more than sufficient. The Bill came to SGD$50.

Unfortunately, the dishes were unremarkable. The Bhajia was adequate, The chicken had an unusual taste, different to the many varieties of Tandoori chicken I have had around the world. The Naan was nice and fresh, but seemed to lack the ""body"" of other Naans. The Tiger was fine, as always, but no bargain at SGD$9 each.

Securing a taxi at 1020PM would have been difficult, but the staff kindly offered to secure me a ride through their Grab rideshare app. It arrived in 1 minute."
Amazing food and great service,Authentic India food. The tandoori chicken is juicy and naan is great. Manager is very friendly and offered a 20% discount on our next visit.
Amazing food,"Best chicken tikka masala I have had since we emigrated from UK to Australia over 18 years ago, my husband gives chicken kadai 10/10 also, garlic naan was delicious too, beautiful food we will definitely be back"
Indian Feast,"We couldn't come to the restaurant until after 8.30pm. The owner and staff were wonderful, the food is excellent, wine available and reasonable. Really impressed, it was just what we were looking for. Authentic, tasty, clean and friendly."
Now it is called Tandoori Culture - same place,It is the same place as the Tandoori Corner - they might have changed names. Food is still fantastic. Extraordinary great! Service is also very friendly. Definelty a strong recommendation to go for.
Nice Indian food at Central Business District.,The restaurant is near Telok Iyer MRT and is popular among the Indian crowd. The food is excellent and so is the ambiance. I have been frequenting this restaurant for almost 8 years now. The Chicken biryani is amazing.
Work lunch,"Have always walked past this restaurant and am glad i went today, finally! Had the set lunch and food came quickly, was great quality and very reasonable price wise. Friendly and attentive staff. Will definitely be coming back."
Great Food and Friendly Manager,The food was great. I love the papadum and the butter chicken! It was not noisy and very comfy and I enjoyed my dinner there.
Excellent Restaurant and service,Dont be put off by the location or the other eating establishments nearby as we were. The staff were very pleasant and attentive. The food was excellent and the price was reasonable.
Set lunch !,"Tried it out for lunch .... good variety of dishes., ideal lunch quantity - neither Low Nor stuffy... that is what I liked. Accessible to Telok Ayer MRT. Decent food. Price of lunch and drink will come around 13$-15$."
Lunchtime sets,"Very popular with the CBD crowd so the little place was packed but somehow patrons are adroitly seated as one doesn't linger over lunch on a weekday. Service is swift and efficient as most of the dishes are already cooked except probably for the naan which is served hot to the table a little after the mains. Both the vegetarian and chicken tikka sets were good value, coming with dhall, potatoes, vegetables and beryani rice as well as roti or naan, rather a lot for small eaters. Chicken was tender though bit too red for my liking, vegetables and dhall average-tasting but for the sparkling cutlery, paper napkins and general cleanliness and decor, very pleasing. Didn't eat the cut fruit dessert as it was soaked in syrup. Ice-water is served and staff courteous.
Very good for a quick lunch but if you want something more spicy and gourmet-style, might have to look elsewhere."
Wonderful food,"We are a family from the UK that for the third year running have scheduled a visit to this great place on our annual holiday to Singapore. The owner remembers us and he and his staff cannot do enough for us. The flavours are delicious, the food reasonable and so delicious. We would recommend this place 100%."
Great Friday night curry,"Hi this was the best rated Indian close to my hotel in Singapore. Small, casual, a lot of locals and regulars , and easy to find on Google maps. Importantly , good traditional menu and great food. I really enjoyed my mutton rogan josh with rice and roti bread. Will go back next time in Singapore."
Best Indian Food - Quality Dining - Quality Service - City Centre,"As always - visiting friends from Canada and ourselves will dine for dinner in this superb personalized cosy corner restaurant. Have been there more than 3 times with no regrets.
Manager Gilbert Rego and staff are very hospitable and attentive to details. He will explain and recommend food menu ordered without hesitation like a 'CHEF' himself.
Good free and easy, relaxing value for money establishment .
Must and Must go !!!"
"Lovely place, good food, awesome service...",Awesome food and great service. If you are looking for nice spread and great varietybeither during lunch time or after working go for this. Lovely place...
Best Indian in Singapore,"I have been to many Indian restaurants in Singapore, as Indian food is my favourite. None of them have been worth writing about, however this one is ... it’s a small hidden little gem, fantastic staff and the food is amazing, all cooked fresh and tastes amazing !!! The only Indian I will now eat in Singapore !!!"
Good in a way,"A little North Indian cuisine restaurant tucked at the corner of Boon Tat street. About 5 minutes walk from Telok Ayer MRT station. Basically, their customers are mostly from the office crowds of the CBD area. By the way, the name of this restaurant has changed to Tandoori Culture,
Wife and I visited this cosy restaurant for dinner on a Saturday night. We were early. No customer except us.
Ordered the famous chicken tikka ($13.90), aloo gobi ($10.90), garlic naan ($4.50) and
chicken biryani (12.90). On hindsight, we ordered a little too much of chicken. Unable to finish the chicken tikka, we requested to repack for takeaway.
Chicken tikka was very well grilled. It was tender and succulent. Served with cilantro enhanced the taste to another level.
Basmatic rice cooked flavourably with generous amount of chicken served in a claypot. First time, I see biryani served in claypot. Not oily at all. I can taste this is good cooking.
Aloo gobi was tasty with bite-size potato. Went well with the garlic naan, which was also flavourably done.
Wife liked the lassi ($5.00) while I had the ginger tea ($3.90), which was milky. A little less of milk will be fine.
On the whole, the food was awesome though a tad pricey. Service was courteous."
Good Food - Reasonable Prices,"We have been looking for good North Indian food in Singapore for a long time. We found Tandoori corner recently and it did not disappoint.

The chicken tikka was tender and tasty and so was the chicken tandoori. The palak paneer was the best we had in Singapore and the raita was excellent. The cheese naan was ok.

Service was efficient and friendly. Will definitely visit again."
Good value set lunches,"Came here for lunch today for a return visit after a gap of several years. The lunch sets are very good value at just $12 for a non-veg set (today was a lamb rogan jhosh curry with a few other veg curries supplemented with naan and rice and a small dessert). Friendly and efficient service. Food quality was average, but overall still good value for lunch."
Hidden gem,"Thanks to TripAdvisor the great ratings we ended up visiting this restaurant twice. The lunch is set menu both veg and non veg available. Food tastes amazing and the menu differs daily. Staff are very friendly so is the owner. The dinner is A-La-carte . A definite must visit if need good Indian food, it's always crowded so be ready for bit waiting."
Excellent dinner,A nice cosy place with tasty dishes. Friendly waiters .. good ambience..went there with 2 of my colleagues from Belgium and they loved it!
Good set lunch menu,"A small restaurant but very nice food. Menu is short with set meal. really good quality food. staff is extremely nice, polite and friendly. have been there couple of times at lunch time and always found it packed with people and had to wait, which is proof of the popularity of this restaurant. Highly recommended. Will be back soon."
Good Food,"We went with friends for casual lunch. The menu is short for lunch with some set meals and drinks. Liked the lunch menu. Food is good and tasty, quantity is also good. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Will go back again to try different thalis."
Nice Lunch Set Menu,I come here for lunch sometimes . It is always packed with people which is a display of its popularity. The naan and chicken masala is very nice and portions just right.
For starters...,"For starters, this place has very quick service, delicious food, and a very spacy restraunt. I recomend this to people who want to chill out , or for people who want to look at the chinese temple around the corner of this restraunt."
Licenced to grill,"@TheKuoKnows

This is probably one of the most authentic North Indian restaurants in Singapore. The Boon Tat Street outlet can be a godsend, if you are in the Central Business District around mealtime.

The lunchtime special is perfect for an unfussy taste of India. Service is very prompt. But be warned - the restaurant can also be heaving with office workers. So be prepared to wait a little for an available table.

The set-lunch menu at around $15 is more than reasonable. The Chicken Tikka is quite delightful and not too heavy, if you have a heavy meeting schedule in the afternoon.

The Naan bread is perfectly thin. A sign of an accomplished chef.

Tandoori Corner has got everything just right. Food quality is excellent; the service is top-notch and the price is affordable."
Value for money,This shophouse restaurant sells good Indian food at affordable prices. Must try their chicken dishes and also naan.
Best Indian food with great service,"Everything we ordered from galic naan to tandoori lamb cutlets,prawn cutlets butter chicken n rogan josh,everything was so mouth watering n yummy. Kids enjoyed the food n fresh fruit juice n lassi was so delicious. Dessert was great as we odered kulfi ..was too good. Would recommend everyone not to miss this great Indian tandoori corner,the best taste we had in Singapore."
One of the best Indian food that I ever had,I wanted to write this review since June this year when we were in Singapore. It was my favorite restaurant in Singapore and the server that work there is unbelievable nice. I am sorry that I forgot his name. I have his card somewhere in my wallet in Thailand. Everything there taste so fresh to me.The mint sauce was the best that I ever had. The vindaloo and tandoori were so tasty. I think they have the best vindaloo and I want to go back to Singapore just to eat that. Papri chart was the best too. I want to thanks this restaurant for the best food and the best service that they gave to me and my husband while we lived in Singapore.
Value for money,"I has been to this place just a fews days ago , it amazing food and center of the city . Food is also tasty and delicious ."
Great food at a great price,"This is a fantastic little place to eat good Indian food. The menu for lunch is pretty fixed, but is delicious. This is one of my regular lunch joints. The place uses good ingredients, less oil. Do not go here for variety, but go here for a good and light set lunch menu."
Perfect for a regular lunch,"Tandoori corner is one of those Indian restaurants that makes good food, has good service, has great value for money and you wont mind eating here often, but it's not one of those places you'll think of on a special occasion or for fine dining.

I've eaten at Tandoori corner many times and everytime I eat there the experience has been satisfactory. The lunch menu is limited but that ensures that it does not take long to order and the food is served quickly.

The roti/naan is fresh, the biryani sumptuous, the vegetables tasty and the meat is flavourful and well cooked. I would not say the food is so good that I would go out of my way for it but I would not mind eating here a couple of times a week since the food is tasty and not unhealthy.

This is an ideal place for having a quick lunch on a regular day with some friends or colleagues, just make sure you get there a little before peak lunch time and ideally with your entire group or else you could be waiting for a bit."
"Real Indian Food, great value, rustic.","I have eaten here many times, it is always good, the service can be short and try to up sell and they always have a line up at lunch, and from those that know Indian food well, they vote with their feet, it is always full. Limited menu. As along as you go with the right expectations that it is a rustic'ish place and the seats are closer together and you will feel certain time pressure to finish, the food is great!"
A delightful surprise,"Excellently marinated with great flavours and cooked to perfection... The restaurant can get very crowded at lunch time, so best to get there early if you don't want to wait in a long line. Look forward to going back for some great food"
If you like great Indian food this is the place,"We live close by to this restaurant and are frequent visitors, the food is awesome and the staff are super friendly, to top it off the prices are very reasonable for the area, highly recommended"
Yummy n delicious,I have been there lot of time because of delicious meal .Best place of dinning North Indian food like to visited again .try to have lamb chop and fish tikka
Mouthwatering food at reasonable prices,"My colleague and I visited this restaurant during the lunch hour. I tried their veg thali and my friend tried the chana bhatura.

The thali consists of 2 sabji, dal, naan and rice+ sweet. The food was excellent quality and quantity wise- in fact every item was very well prepared- not spicy and very flavourful.

For the price that you pay - I would call the service, decor and sitting excellent. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to have good quality North Indian food at a very reasonable price.

Just ensure that you have a cup of tea or coffe after the meal to ensure that you dont fall asleep in office after a hearty meal.

Keep it up guys. Will visit again."
Awesome Food,"The only good north Indian restaurant I could find in the talok ayer locality, serving authentic veg & non veg north Indian food.Quick & great service as well."
"Excellent service, great food","Highly recommended for the great food, loved their daal makhani and tamatar ka shorba which they customized to make it spicy for me. And the cherry on cake is indeed the warmth and excellent service of their manager - Amit."
Always delightful...,"Tandoori Corner is one of the under-stated Indian dining options in Singapore. With another outlet on Balestier Road, this place never fails to impress with simple, delicious food, and unpretentious yet efficient service. A must-try if you are in this foodies' district of Singapore."
"Great food, poor service","The food is really good here, but the staff really need to up their game. For example, I ordered a chicken tikka and when I inquired about the missing mint sauce, the waiter pointed at the poppadom tray and said it was there! He then refused to accept the entertainer app because it isn't their main menu item apparently. Overall, great food but I may need to explore other Indian restaurants who are a little friendlier."
Probably will avoid this place,Good food but average service. Nightmare to pay the bill here using the entertainer app. They are poorly organised.
Great for lunch,This place is very near to my office and serves one of the best naan in Singapore. Do try their lunch meal option which is good value for money. The kheer is good too.
Great curry house,"Great little curry house. Best naans we've had, just like English versions! Good value and great staff"
Great Lunch!,"Been there couple of times with friends and family.

Casual but good & tasty North Indian food.
Set Meals or Starters or Chaas or Chana Bhatura, Samosa, Papri Chaat. All good quality ..

My South Indians and Marathi friends liked it too!

My Favourite Chana Bhatura never go wrong at this place.

Thank you for lovely food!"
Authentic good food,"I love indian food, and this place definitely is one of the better places in Singapore to enjoy good North Indian food. Service is also excellent, and i like the papaddum that comes with every meal. Portions look small but are actually very hearty and meats very delicious and flavorful, without being overly spicy. Do order their mouthwatering butter chicken."
Great place,"Lovely Food, great staff. Felt like an English Indian, naan breads were outstanding, curry delicious and it's in The Entertainer also so good value"
Good curry,"Casual restaurant in an area with several nice bars around.

Great curry. The tandoori chicken was excellent and cooked from fresh.

Reasonably priced"
Great food and friendly environment....,"Was a little home sick after 3 hectic days of park hopping.... Had developed strong craving for Indian food. So started looking for an Indian place for dinner. The place did full justice to our expectation. Delicious food ( kids could enjoy ) , extremely friendly staff and relaxing environment. Would want to go again."
Superb!,"Wonderful N. Indian cuisine served with a smile! We visited based on reviews and, if anything, found this restaurant to be even better than advertised. Tandoori dishes are delicious, not over-spiced but flavorful. Chicken tikka is a ""don't miss""! Naan is very light and melts in your mouth. Vegetable byranyi rice was wonderful. Prices are very reasonable and atmosphere is perfect. Service was very attentive; our waiter, Amir, genuinely cares that you enjoy the meal and even threw in a curry on the house so we could experiment with favors we had not tasted. He also walked us half-way to MRT station afterwards to ensure we didn't get lost. That's above and beyond. One of the best meals we've had in Singapore. Recommend without reservation....if you like Indian food, you'll love this place."
Trust the reviews,"Based on TripAdvisor reviews we walked to try this restaurant and we were happy we made this choice. A small venue but very friendly. The fish tikka was sensational and the tandoori chicken very juicy. We also had some vegetable dishes that were very fresh and flavoursome.
Wine choices very limited but those that were available were pleasant enough.
Unfortunately the toilet door is broken and does not close. Service was a tad slow to start but the apologies were profuse and we were looked after from then on. Also very pleasantly surprised by a complimentary glass of wine each."
"Good Service, Decent Food","The food was quite good, definitely above average but not flavoursome enough for my personal taste. Still a nice place to eat and drink."
Mouth watering food,"One of the best meals we had in Singapore considering how difficult it is to find delicious north Indian food here. But we were definitely surprised by the quality here. We ordered samosas which were ""as they should be"". The vegetables and naan were also very delicious and served quickly."
Great food,"Walked by this and went in by the look. We agreed that it was delicious Indian food, and later we discovered here at Tripadvisor the luck has brought us to a quite top rated restaurant. It's deserved!"
Best Hospitality and Taste for an Indian Restaurant in Singapore,"I was in Singapore on an official trip and was put up in Tanjong Pagar. I was craving for Indian food when i came across the review for Tandoor Corner and thought to give it a shot.
It has one of the most tasty and authentic indian food in Singapore. And above all, the restaurant stands out for the hospitality and warmth of their manager Amit Rajak.
While all the restaurants in Singapore levy a 10% service charge, irrespective of the level of service they provide, with Tandoori Corner you would definitely not feel cheated. Lot of credit goes to Amit who sets an example that you need not graduate from a Reputed Hospitality College or work in a 5 star hotel to understand the basic nitty gritty of services...Manish"
Best Food,Best indian food you will find at boon tat street...staff is really nice....if around that area do go for lunch.
AWESOME food and service!,"I visited Tandoori Corner for dinner today and it was such an amazing experience! I knew I had to write a positive review about this place even though I don't usually leave reviews. Amit recommended a few dishes for the two of us to share and ALL of them impressed us so much that we ordered another main even though we were both so stuffed!
First and foremost, all of the food we tried here was spectacular. I've been to a few Indian restaurants and none came as close to this in Singapore. The Chicken Tikki was grilled really well and the spice gave a nice kick to this dish. The butter chicken was very addictive and the garlic Naan, dipped in the butter chicken's amazing gravy, truly elevated the entire dish even further. We knew we just had to order another serving of the Naan even before we got to the end to scrape the last of it.
This is my first time having the Baigan Bartha and it is safe to say it would definitely not my last. The vegetables were cooked perfectly with the different spices, giving rise to such a flavoursome dish.Those were the dishes that were recommended to us by the lovely Amit but we were so impressed, we ordered a serving of Rogan Josh as recommended by the other reviews. What can I say, I do not usually go for lamb dishes but I did not regret choosing this one. The meat was so tender it was practically falling apart as I picked at it with my fork. We were also very pleasantly surprised that the meat, while retaining some flavour, was not as strong as most lamb dishes that may become off putting.
We also tried their Mango Lassi which was AMAZING and was the perfect complement to their spicy dishes. The Kulfi was also a very interesting dessert and was an equally great palate cleanser and a nice end to our dining experience.
Service was nothing short of wonderful as well. We could sense how Amit was genuinely passionate about his food and he took time to check up on us and explain the different dishes to us.
With such great service AND food, this gem of a place has easily become one of my favourite restaurants.

If you're reading this Amit, HELLO! We're the people who visited your place today (a rainy Friday night). Your food and service did wonders to lift our spirits and we left the place so satisfied and happy despite the ongoing gloomy weather. I cannot say enough nice things about your restaurant. We would definitely be back with our families!!"
Good Indian Restaurant with great onion bhaji,"We went to Tandoori Corner after seeing reviews on TripAdvisor and where not disappointed.

We ordered onion bhaji and where surprised at the size and style - rather than the traditional bhaji balls we have in the UK they where slices of fried onions with a tasty seasoning, we thoroughly enjoyed them.

Was good value for money as well - about $45 (singapore dollars) for onion bhaji, butter chicken, chicken biriyani, regular nan, butter nan and 2 cokes.

would visit again if in singapore"
Excellent Indian Restaurant,"Tried their Chicken, Fish, Egg Plant for our first visit there. Food was so delicious that we ordered a bottle of red wine to celebrate this pleasant discovery. Service is very impressive too.

We'll certainly be back again pretty soon."
Good Indian food with reasonable price,"This is one of the good Indian restaurant that I love to frequent during lunch hour. Their Chicken Tikki and Naan are nice. Plus it's reasonably price as well. Lunch hour on a weekday can be quite packed, so go earlier if you want to secure a seat.

Only thing I don't like is their dessert, which is a way too sweet for my liking."
Excellent food and welcoming,"Very clean with a very warmful staff. We eat tendori, vegetable, starter recommended excellent, wonderful. Good value for money and food made with heart... Nice abounding. Go to the temple. The third one at the end of the street on the right side. Don t miss this restaurant in Singapore. Subway blue line station 18."
I love this place!,"I am not an expert on Indian food but I love the food at this Northern Indian restaurant....and have eaten there on each of my last several visits to Singapore. I was part of a group of friends and I ordered items based on my last visit --- each one was excellent. Not only that, the setting is just fine, the service is prompt and the pricing is very reasonable. The others in my party all enjoyed the food as well. My next visit to Singapore will definitely include a visit to this place once again."
Great North Indian restaurant,"We enjoyed this restaurant so much last trip to Singapore that we returned. It was even better this time! The owners have a passion for cooking that shows. The best thing about Tandoori Corner is the variety of flavors in their dishes: many spices are blended in novel and delicious ways. Every dish was perfectly prepared, service is excellent, and the atmosphere is peaceful. Highly recommended."
Good Food Wrong Directions,Agree with all the reviews but an effort to find. I used the Map connection on Trip Advisor and it takes you to the wrong end of Boon Tat St. Put the address direct into Google Maps. It's actually on the corner of Boon Tat and Amoy Streets. The owner tells me a lot of people end up getting confused.
Amazing Home Style Indian Food,"Tucked away in a quiet corner around Telok Ayer, Tandoori Corner was quite a find! The one funny thing though was the staff member that greeted (or did not) us outside the restaurant - the reception was definitely dragon like!
However, we still persisted on and seated ourselves inside. The menu's compact - we got our regular - Palak Paneer (delicious gravy and seasoning), Egg Curry (again, yummy gravy - very well done), Garlic Naan (fluffy and flavoursome), Vegetable Biryani (nice enough but the vegetables were cut in rather large pieces!), and the Sweet Lassi (creamy and thick with a touch of rose water).
The food was delicious - home style, non greasy with generous portions. We'd definitely go back for the food!"
Onion bhaji heaven,"We stopped here for dinner tonight. The onion bhaji, one serve, was a mountain of deliciousness. Too much for one person. We shared. The potato and cauliflower and chicken vindaloo curries were excellent, as was the naan. Including beer and wine the bill came to about $60 which was great value for Singapore. Recommended."
Nice food and friendly staff,A good food cooked well. Staff very friendly and helpful. its really worth it to go and try some food.
Perfect price and excellent menu !,A good place to have lunch during office hours especially vegetarians are gonna find it worth. For 10 dollar one can have a vegetarian thali (plate) which is more than enough to calm down the hunger :D. Though the choice is limited but the food is pretty delicious :) The non-vegetarians do have lot of options which are worth trying (nom ! nom!).
"Short menu, simple choices, cooked very well","We were tired, hungry and in the area, so came here based on other reviews. It serves better food than you may think at first sight so don't let a faded appearance put you off. We had very well seasoned and prepared chicken tikka and a refreshingly un-greasy butter chicken, done perfectly, so it was moist yet cooked right through. And the service was very good too, with a lovely balance of helpfulness and professionalism. Try it!"
Excellent value,"Although not particularly busy, there was only one other table being used the night we went, they were doing lots of takeaway business with the locals. We shared a plate of onion bhaji which were cooked to perfection. My wife had the tandoori fish and I had rogan josh both very tasty. Would comment that menu choice was quite limited in my experience of Indian restaurants. However the bill was also pleasantly small as well. Would certainly use the place regularly if I were a local, so if in the area give it a try."
Excellent value and tasty food,"A group of us dined here after a quick trip to Cafe Awesome, and the food was amazing, service was great and the flavours were incredible. We sent a scouting party ahead to ensure that we would get a table - I look forward to a repeat visit during my next trip to Singapore."
Great food and friendly staff,"Great little restaurant in the heart of Singapore. The menu offered a great selection, and the food we ordered (butter chicken, naan and tandoori chicken) was delicious. The staff was really friendly and helped keep my hungry 22-month-old daughter amused and distracted until the food came."
Wonderful food!,We decided to go to this restaurant because of the good reviews on Tripadvisor and we certainly agreed with the recommendations when we sampled the food. It is a simple menu but had enough choices - we had the onion bhajis to start which were gorgeous - we ordered two portions but were advised not to have two because you get a lot in each portion and it was lucky we listened as there was a huge pile! We then had the butter chicken and the vindaloo and both were excellent. We also had a naan which was wonderful. Even the poppadoms were nicer than any I have had elsewhere! All this for a very cheap price for Singapore.The service was very good as well and everyone was really friendly and chatty. This place was a real find and I really recommend it to anyone who wants a beautifully cooked and extremely reasonably priced Indian meal in Singapore.
2 times very very good,"I have been to Tandoori Corner )Boon Tat street= twice in the past 2 weeks, both times the food was outstanding and the service very friendly and efficient. I can recommend both the Prawn Masala as well as the Rogan Josh, the onion bhaji was excellent and the garlic naan one of the best I have ever had. Simply one of the best indian restaurants I have been to outside India!"
Excellent food and friendly service.,"Highly recommend this place. A excellent, inexpensive meal, near Telok Ayer. The butter chicken, paneer saag and garlic naan was very tasty."
