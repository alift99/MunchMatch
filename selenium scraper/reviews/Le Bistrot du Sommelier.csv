Mediocre. And only welcoming to certain ‘profiles’ of customers?,"If you are not of the ‘right profile’ you can be demoted to the back of the restaurant at the very obviously ‘cheap’ seats which is also the hanging-out chatting spot for the wait staff.

Customers of probably the more ‘desirable profile’ were seated at the front half of the restaurant, where the better environment was even though the restaurant was still half empty at 1.30pm.

Food: mediocre considering the price. Burnt cheesecake: struggled to find any taste in the cheesecake, not even cheese/cream.

Felt unwanted.

This place is trying to grip on to its outdated ‘Caucasian’ veneer."
Finest Authentic French Table Food.,"Fantastic food at the Chef’s Table upstairs and authentic French Cuisine, table menu of Rabbit, Pork and Duck Rillette. Good selection of wines and fresh baguettes. A must for the food lover. Quiet, quick and personal."
Below average Lunch,"I had read nice reviews about this place and we were punctual. Perhaps we didn’t order right but the overall experience here was just average 2/5. The set lunch was below average overall, though the desserts were nice and for the price it was good value. We weren’t a fan of the beef cheeks dish served in red wine - as it was bland and so we had to add salt and pepper. The fish was nice. The mashed potatoes in the dish were chunky. The baked cheese fondue was nice and so was the burnt cheesecake, though I preferred the creme brûlée. The white asparagus was okay… wish there was more Hollandaise sauce on it. Service was okay. We decided to skip the wine… perhaps we should have come for dinner instead, might have been a better experience? Hard to say…"
nice,"escargot, bread with liver, beef tartare, and the apple sorbet were quite nice, did not try the wine"
Poor service and poor customer service,"I brought my entire family here for my birthday celebration. We booked 2 tables and of course observed social distancing the entire evening. We ordered the Cote De Boef, the signature dish that Le Bistro is famous for. Before ordering it, I told the waitress that I told my dad that this dish is extremely delicious, that the last time I had it, the steak was melt in your mouth yummy! When the steak arrived, it was dry and rubbery. It was beautifully pink, so could not have been overdone. When I complained to the wait staff, they said that we already consumed more than half of the steak! There are 5 people at our table, and every one took 1 piece to try. Of course more than half would be gone! I was so disappointed that I ordered another steak to give the restaurant another chance. Mind you, this steak costs $159 on the menu. When the 2nd steak arrived, it was perfect, soft and juicy, just how i remembered it to be. When I paid the bill, I was shocked to see that we were charged $159 and $173 respectively for the first and 2nd steak. There was no discount given for the steak at all. In fact we were charged more!!! HUH??? WE COMPLAIN, WE ARE NOT HAPPY AND YOU HAVE THE NERVE TO CHARGE US NOT ONLY THE FULL PRICE BUT CHARGE US MORE??? RIDICULOUS!! IT WAS SO RIDICULOUS THAT I HAD TO TAKE A LONG SWIG OF MY WINE TO RECOVER FROM THIS RIDICULOUS ""SERVICE RECOVERY"". Of course, we did not expect the 2nd steak to be complimentary but knowing that we were unhappy with the first, surely a customer centric restaurant would offer to at least discount the 2nd steak!!! Or offer us a complimentary dessert or something!!! I would be happy with at least something of that nature. Instead we were given a glass of apperitif each, and only 4 of us drink. We had a party of 9 in total,. spread over 2 tables. What a disappointing evening... My advice to customers who are thinking of visiting this restaurant, visit another restaurant! There are so many excellent French restaurants here in Singapore, with better food and better service!"
Best place for authentic home-cooked French food,"The ambience and decor give a feeling of being in France and the food feels like home-cooked. We live the pork rillettes and chicken liver pate. The grilled rack of lamb was perfectly cooked, served with delicious ratatouille and sauce with the beautifully cooked gratin of potatoes. To top this delightful dinner was the soufflé - the best we’ve ever had. And the red wine from Languedoc complemented the food very well. Total cost S$379 (which included 2 glasses of white wine for aperitif)"
Traditional Home-cooked French Food,"Another successful dinner with Bistro du Sommelier delivery. We reckon it’s the best French food in Singapore cooked the traditional way. Starters were the duck and cod rillettes and foie gras terrine. Mains were fried duck confit, hanger steak and chicken meat loaf. All for S$172 (free delivery) enough for 4 adults."
"Awesome food,ambience,and staff!!","Went here for a bday dinner.
Sat upstairs for some excellent Charcuterie including Pate,anchovies,Cod,with fantastic bread. Plus some great wines, ( the Bordeaux white was fantastic ).

then popped downstairs for dinner.
Beef ,Lamb,Lobyter with Octopus and Risotto,potato smash,puree,salad,all fantastic. One of the best meals in ages.
Wonderful staff also.
Beautiful restaurant with great food and staff."
Excellent food and great service.,"The staff was very helpful as this was the first time having french food. The wait staff was very patient in explaining to us what the menu item meant and in giving us recommendations based on our diet.

Also, loved the effort they put into writing a happy birthday message for my girlfriend as per my request :)

In terms of food, the food was flavorful and rich, and the meat were all soft. Would love to come back again!"
hostile staff,"utterly disappointed and alienated by the wait staff. dishes were thrown haphazardly on the table and even collected back at some point? there are better ways to spend 200 dollars than on 2 mains, 2 platters, and 2 very stingy portions of wines, and HOSTILE service. must remark that NO wine recommendation was made to us. in fact, the staff tried to upsell us to the huge beef platter when we already told her we wanted to eat individual dishes especially when I was ordering my onglet steak. VERY noisy atmosphere. chestnut paste did not go with the duck canard at all. she threw us our receipt using one hand at the end of our dining session.

rare that I would actively DIS-recommend others from coming to a restaurant. in this case YES."
Poor service and attitude of the Philippino waitress.,"First, we waited outside for awhile to be seated even though we made reservations. Then 2 other parties came and she sat all of us at the same time. BUT she gave menus and poured water for the other tables and we still have not gotten our menu. Mind you, we were patiently waiting outside, were never rude and just said hi and quoted out reservation number. In addition, she forgot our desserts order even though we placed an order from the very beginning when she was taking our order. But then a nice gentlemen came and helped us with our dessert order. Food was overall well balanced in taste and no one ingredient was over powering which is nice. The appetizer were appetizing (for lack of better words). We ordered a soup and escargots. Thought the escargots came after the main meal was served, it tasted ok..nothing unusual or special. We ordered two mains, beef tartare and roast chick and finished off with a indulgent chocolatey dessert. My husband had a glass of wine and I didn't as I am 6 months pregnant. Will I go back again? Probably not. I'm not a fan of paying for pain."
"Good, consistent, authentic French food","Le Bistrot du Sommelier has never disappointed me whenever I visit. Good, robust, quality French food every time."
Rushed in,"A ""bistrot"" in French means a place where you can sit down without reservation and have a quick dish with a glass of wine. I really think this restaurant has usurpated its name. First for sure because of the Phase 2 rules we needed a reservation and because it was raining we arrived a bit late. But nobody from the restaurant tried to contact us and when we arrived they said... ""Ah now you have to rush because it takes 45 min to prepare any dish. We can move you in the middle of your dinner upstairs if you want"". We understand the constraints but what we did not like the way it was done. For sure not the French way to treat visitors... So in the end we did not take any of these ""long preparation"" dish, had rillettes and cheese and anchovies, all of them very good, with a bottle of wine. So the food was good but the service and courtesy for sure not there...."
Disappointment,"Le Bistrot du Sommelier has been my favourite restaurant in Singapore. Good food, relaxed ambience, service with a smile, and a good wine list combined to make dining there a very pleasurable experience. My wife and I decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary there.

I called to book a table and was directed to leave a message. There was no return call. So I booked on their website. Not a big issue.

At the restaurant, the food was still good, but the service was a bit abrupt. The new wine list was a major disappointment. Gone were the nice Burgundies -- Volnay, Pommard, Gevrey Chambertin -- instead we got Cote du Rhone and new world wines.

But the shock came when we settled the bill -- credit cards were no longer accepted. It was either cash or PayNow. Well, call me an old curmudgeon, but I am not set up for PayNow (and do not want to), and I was not sure if I had enough cash. I was brusquely advised that there were ATM machine a few blocks away. Does the waiter expected me to walk ""a few blocks"" from the restaurant, get enough cash, and walk ""a few blocks"" back to pay the bill? Finally, my wife and I went through our wallets and scraped up just enough cash to pay the bill. Such an embarrassing situation.

I surmise that the restaurant is now under new management. If so, may I remind them that the name of the restaurant implies good wine (please look up the meaning of ""sommelier"") and that the customer should be informed, when booking a table, that credit cards are no longer accepted?

As I have told the waiter, you are making it very difficult for me to come back again."
Fantastic!,"First visit and I have to say the food was perfect! Fois gras was delicious, the rabbit was tender and served in a generous portion, the entrecote was big and perfectly cooked. Good service, nice ambiance. Honest prices, really recommended."
Always wonderful,"Quiet weeknight with the island’s best rillettes, a great slab of beef roasted just right, a bottle of smooth French Malbec and warm service. Rock-solid, unpretentious bistro par excellence"
thoroughly enjoyable lunch,"The atmosphere is inviting and casual (we sat at ""the bar""), service is very good. The set lunch choices are appealing, we enjoyed both the chicken and the fish. Will definitely return!"
Good food at generous sizes,"Restaurant caught my attention while cycling nearby so I've decided to give it a try a few days later. Was not disappointed.

Food is really good, with nice portions and reasonable prices. Most dishes are in the S$ 30-40 range and several of them seem to be big enough for two persons.

The rabbit was excellent and it could definitely be shared, specially if ordering some starters as well. The apple tart was also very tasty, with several thin slices on top of a light pastry base, paired with macadamia and icecream. Too bad it was a special of the day and not something on the permanent menu (tough it highly deserves it).

That stretch of Armenian Street was recently closed for cars and turned into a pedestrian only, so this also adds to the overall atmosphere."
Excellent ambiance and helpful staff,I booked for my boss to celebrate her birthday. This place nvr failed her. The staff are helpful and attentive and the food and drinks are super... what else you want to ask for?
Excellent service and food,"It was my son's Bday celebration and we were totally satisfied with the food and service. The Souffle ""Noix de Coco"" for 2 was more than enough for 4 of us to share! I had the ""Poisson du Jour"" as my main and it was really good. Strongly recommend this restaurant."
Love this place!,Food is always amazing and service was impeccable. I prefer to sit outside but lunch time was too hot.
Value for money set lunch,"$38 for a set lunch! We used to only come here for dinners eat the onglet, tartare and leave. Then we discovered the set lunch with the recent covid-19 and working from home. Woohoo! But seriously, I haven’t had better tartare and onglet in Singapore. The pig head terrine is pretty good. Jellyish with crunchy cartilage."
Authentic French Food,"Food-:
Quality food, quite authentic. I ordered the Hanger Steak with Fries at Medium temperature. I would say that they got the temperature PERFECTLY. I have been several steak restaurants. The 200g Hanger Steak cost SGD$34++, only a couple of dollars more than the local restaurant, Jack’s Place, but the quality of the food is 10 times better. The meat was extremely tender and full bodied flavourful. There was no fats or tendons in between the steak. One of the best things was there was no blood oozing out. It is the best value for money I have ever eaten. The offered many authentic interesting sides. Mac & Cheese with Broccoli was cheesy and really yummy. The Potato Gratin was hot and cheesy on the first few bites. When it turned cool, it just tastes normal. We ordered chorizo set, cheese set and chicken liver pate. I did not know how to appreciate these three side dishes so I did not like them. The red wine and champagne were good. They tasted dry and not too sweet. The meringue was way too sweet but the coconut ice cream and pistachio ice cream were good. The taste of the ice creams was subtle and classy.

Ambience-:
Cozy and warm ambience. It is considered classy for me. We were given a long booth table for 12 people. The six of us who were seated at the booth side found it difficult to move in and out. For a restaurant at this price range, the seats were not comfortable.

Service-:
I saw mostly Philippines waitresses. They are warm but nothing exceptional. Even though we pre-ordered our food in advance, they took a long time to serve the food. We waited for 30 mins for our food and niece had to hurry the waitresses for the food a few times. However, when the food was ready, it came almost all at once. Moreover, it was served piping hot. That is a thumb up! Easy to find parking on Sat evening. You can park at SMU which a few steps away.

Conclusion-:
This restaurant is not usual spending range and France cuisine ain’t my favourite. I will not return for dinner but may check out their set lunch. Two of my family members feel that their set lunch is good value for money. I may return to check out their set lunch."
A Delightful Evening!,"Cosy French ambience (wine glasses chandeliers!), friendly service and excellent food - just like home-cooked traditional French food. We shared the foie gras terrine and the Bayonne Ham (22 months aged) as starters. Very hearty and tasty portions! Then we shared the main course ‘Le Morceau du Chef’ - oven-bake striploin steak to perfect doneness and taste! The ‘Mont Blanc’ dessert was my least favorite- it could have more chestnut in it. Total cost for 2, including a bottle of wine and 2 glasses of white wine aperitif was S$390."
"The way a french restaurant should work - simple, good, professional","Welcomed by owner, remembering my guest six months after his first visit. Granted every modification of the menu we wanted (from simple, to simpler). Hearty, classic French cuisine in equally typical Brasserie setting. Close your eyes and you'd think you're in France. Didn't finish the well priced, good white french wine and were given al of upstairs despite restaurant closed for afternoon until we had finished. No hoohaa about this place but simply good."
Reliably good,"Perfectly executed sharing portion of l’entrcote ribeye steak coated with peppercorn, accompanied by exquisite selection of rillettes, terrines and cheeses. If you visit, make sure you order the ice cream filled profiteroles drenched with chocolate sauce. Not to be missed."
Great Lunch!,"We had the onglet, lamb stew, potato gratin and green salad. Portions were generous and I found the lamb stew to be delicious. Though the ravioli was tiny in size, the cheese flavour was still intense."
"Great food, Average Service","The food is always a hit here! Everything was fantastic. The service standards however are questionable. The wait staff didn't know much about what they were serving when we asked for more details. Getting their attention was another challenge. Lastly, the washroom was a messy disaster. For the price we pay, the least that can be done is to keep the washroom clean."
Meat Lovers Delight,"The rabbit rilette (home-made) and chicken-liver pate (home-made) were sensational. Just perfect. We had the ""morceau du chef"" for mains, which was a delicious strip-loin with chestnut mash. Even the steamed vegetable side-dish was an explosion of taste. This is a fantastic restaurant, top quality French cooking. It's a real find!!"
Great French restaurant with real countryside dishes,"This restaurant is amazing if you’re looking for real local French food. It is tasty, rich, typical local cuisine. You’ll find rillettes, foie gras, pâtés, regional stews like burgundy beef...etc
The atmosphere is cozy and the staff is very friendly.
This is a real French restaurant and experience!

If you’re looking for a French fine dinning restaurant, this won’t be your choice."
Extremely tasty hanger steak,Extremely tasty hanger steak and lamb rack!!! The fries are also amazingly cooked! Chicken liver pate is on point. The vibe is very chilled and good for relaxed catchup with friends
Lovely spot.,"We just stopped for an afternoon snack and it’s just near the fort Canning park so easy. Friendly staff met us , it’s very well decorated with a rustic theme and the salamis and cheese selection superb."
best steak i had in 2019,"the beef onglet was very very flavourful , had it at medium rare. we also tried the beef tartare which was great too, side of mash was crazily smooth too. would definitely return and recommend this place to my friends"
Great concierge and magnificent food,"We had a birthday celebration at Armenian Street area with its nice ambience. Our reservation was for 630pm at La Bistrot. The welcome by the host Mary was very warm and professional and we felt quite at home. We started with some house breads and pork fennel with garlic sausage that was classic!

The escargo next was heavenly and the next two dishes are a MUst!The duck comfit and the oven roasted Venison Rack and Loin must be tasted-they are amazing.

It was a memorable night thanks to Mary with her great service and also the chefs.

I strongly recommend this restaurant for a night out.

Cheers

G.D."
Value Set Lunch,Restaurant cozy and intimate. Portion for set lunch big. Would have being better if soup is offered as part of the appetizer instead of only terrine and salad.
Certainly Worth It,Very welcoming. Good service and authentic food. Very enjoyable evening with very good wine and food. Will definitely recommend!
A must when we visit Singapore!,Food and service exceptional. We've been to Le Bistrot before and we'll certainly be back. True French feel. We particularly enjoyed the pate de fois gras - rarely available in UK.
Even the set lunch is excellent ...,Well executed steak and frites … with juicy tender onglets and no frills but crispy french fries. Desserts were also nicely presented and hit just the right spot. Service was also great …
One keeps coming back,Because the food is generous Because the wines are sumptuous Because the restaurant manager has passion Because it’s French with no excuse
Very good foods and wines,We had a very good time with very nice foods and wines. Restaurant staff are friendly and offered us good choices.
Unassuming little place. Perfect for casual business meet-ups.,"Quality of food was decent enough. For the SGD 40 lunch set, perhaps the courses could be more French, so in that sense options were limited. Still, will return as it’s a cosy little spot."
Fabulous french food not to be missed,We dined at this restaurant before we flew back to Australia after a two month around the world trip. We unfortunately were very late with our booking due to a taxi driver who could not find the restaurant which happened to be 10 minutes from our hotel. From the start of the meal the staff could not do enough for us. The chef we were told is Singaporean and had spent time in France learning to cook french food. I had mussels which were fabulous followed by lamb which was cooked to perfection s well. The final course was a creme brûlée one of my favourite desserts and it had to be one of the best I have ever had even including dining in Paris. Do no miss this restaurant in Singapore you will not be disappointed! We also loved the wine glass chandelier in the main restaurant and there is also a great bar upstairs with a large cellar of good wines not to be missed.
True French feeling,"Excellent meals, with a real French bourgondy taste. We had real seasonal dishes, like artichoke and moules-frites, combined with all-time favourite duck rillette as a starter. The restaurant has an informal bistrot atmosphere. Portions are large, staff is friendly and attentive. Whenever we crave for European seasonal food, we will be back!"
Wholesome hearty French food,"Greeted by very friendly waitresses/waiter from the door onwards. We had the Duck Rillettes, Escargots, Garbure and the Le Confit for our main. The Garbure was especially delicious. Portions were huge, didn’t actually have space for the main."
"Nice ambience, average food, good desserts","For the set lunch, my selected entree was tomatoes with basil which could do with a bit more herbs & vinegrette. The caramelised onions on the steak was appetising. However, the steak only came with an overly large portion of fries. The amount of fries could have been less, complemented with some vegetables instead. It was a struggle trying to finish the over-fried fries. The desserts that came with the set were very generous and very good."
"Ok food, not so convenient location","Weekday lunch catchup with friends and we were their only booking. All of us had their three course set lunch which was ok. Main course recommended was the rabbit, some of us opted for the onglet which was good. Separately ordered the duck terrine which was good. Server recommended a nice bottle of red."
A must try,"This is one of my must visits whenever I’m in town. I worked in singapore for about three years, and loved this place. Just had dinner here this week, and it was just as good as I remembered! Duck rillet and beer cheek ALL DAY!"
Private event - very well done !,"Private event on the 1 floor , Vincent and team just made it a great great night to remember ! Really traditional french food with great taste and details paired with great wines and a team that just made it so fun - brilliant evening ! Thanks"
Good frog legs salad,"I love their sautéed frog legs with salad - it was a generous portion and the frog meat was yummy. My main course of rooster leg was too creamy for me. My companions didn’t rave about their main courses either. Place is cozy and good for a friend’s’ gathering. If you bring your own bottle of wine, you have to order another bottle from the restaurant. There is no option to pay corkage."
When you want something good,We had a special occasion so wanted to be sure to get good food and wine. We have been here several times and never been disappointed.
Great restaurant and wonderful rillette bar in charming pedestrianised street.,Charming and quaint pedestrianised street just around the corner from City hall houses two great experiences in one lovely building. Just along from the Peranakan museum with a beautiful mural on the wall but when you step inside Asia stays outside as this is an unambiguously French experience. Downstairs is a great restaurant where talented chef Brandon cooks fabulous food every day. A meat eaters treat his cooking is inventive and creative. Upstairs there is a buzzy and delightful wine bar where chef Brandon's rillettes and pates and pies and sausages delight. As the name would suggest Bistro du Sommelier has a fabulous and very interesting wine list which is also good value. whetehr you go upstairs or downstairs the service is very good.
Good food but service could be better,"Food was good. However the service experience was not the best. We booked a table for 9 pax a week in advance, but we got seated at a long table made up of 4 smaller tables and we had to squeeze 5 pax on one side. On the day of our reservation, the restaurant also called and told us that they would need the table back by a certain time (because ""reservations are coming in"") and asked if we would like to shift our reservation forward because the mains would take 30-45 min to be served. I was surprised to hear that they were still accepting reservations if they could not really accommodate and had to ask us to change our plans instead."
Vincent saved the day,"I was there with a couple of friends and as usual Vincent welcomed us and suggested with the menu and wines which I obliged and agreed. Vincent has never disappointed me with his recommendations and all my friends were very happy with the food, wine and service. What i would like to compliment is the way Vincent had the experience and expertise that helped a sick friend of mine. She was enjoying dinner and suddenly she didn’t feel well with cold sweat and nausea. Vincent immediately reassured her and get her chill towers to be placed on her shoulders with another female friend of ours assisting. Did some pressure point massage and my friend felt better. Kudos also to the service staff that sat her in an office where she is able to recover. Amazing she recovered in around 30mins. Thanks to Vincent and team for all the care and attention especially in a situation like this. We will definitely be back again"
Great food Great wines Great time,We invited another 2 couples for dinner at the restaurant. I can safely say they left sated and delighted. Zec the Sommelier was attentive and the winesbhe recommended were spot on! We had a wonderful time!
Accidental good find for lunch,"We were looking for the Art Plural Gallery, only to find that it had closed down and the streets in this small Armenian Quarter were under renovation.

This small French Bistrot looked an appealing place to stop for lunch.

Genuine French Bistrot ambience and welcoming staff wearing very smart aprons. Reasonably priced food and a good value set lunch. We had the Onglet which suited my young son. Perfectly cooked steak with purée potatoes, choucroute, and steamed vegetables. I had the beef cheek which was slow cooked with carrots and mushrooms, parsley potatoes on the side. Somehow lacking in flavour with little salt and pepper. Meat was good though.

Wines by the glass were disappointing. A Cahors which should have been fuller and more open and a very average Beaujolais.

I would come back if in the area and maybe on a busier day."
Nice to come back again and again,"I came back to the restaurant a few times this year. And it was great to see that they renewed the menu, but kept the same style of bistrot food..
We are never disappointed, the food is really good, especially their Rilletes, at the second floor.
The Manager, Vincent is really amazing, always taking care of the customer, he has an eye on everything.
I really recommend the place if you want to try some real French food, at an affordable price, or bring your loved one for a rommantic dinner."
Fab food. Fab wine,Love this place. Cosy and casual but lovely food. The steaks are to die for. Indeed every dish we have had has been excellent. Waiters could be sharper.
"Excellent Food, Ok service","It had been some years since i visited , but given this has been around for sometime, decided to try it again. The food is consistently still very good, with bistro classic beef dishes, duck cassoulet and some well executed desserts. definitely top marks for food.I thank where it falls short ( which interestingly was my same observation from a few years back) was the consistency of service. When you are fortunate to have the owner/ bosses around you get very good service but the moment they are not there- our completed first course plates were left at the table for a good 20 mins, wine was never poured. I actually told the waiter off for serving a second bottle of wine which he did not offer to taste beforehand. Now, i think if you're paying 150 bucks for a bottle of wine that is a minimum. He went on tell me that 2010 was a good year and did not need tasting to which he got an appropriate response from me. It is a nice place for a standard evening out as long as you can manage the nuances of inconsistent service."
Value for money set lunches,More than decent set lunches at friendly pocket prices. Generous portions for all courses from starter to main and dessert. Service was efficient. Enjoyed our lunch.
Christmas lunch French classic,Wonderful authentic French meal at le bistrot . Friendly impeccable service and delicious food .Thank you !
Gorgeous traditional french food,"The last time I came here was several years back so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. We ordered the pork rillettes for starters, beef cheeks and duck confit for mains and pear crumble for dessert. All dishes were really superb, cannot be faulted. I gave the place a 4 star only because the upper floor was a bit warm.
Pork rillettes were full of flavour and accompanied by delicious crusty bread and pickles. Beef cheeks were seriously melt in your mouth, duck confit was juicy with a crispy layer of skin. The crumble on the pear was the best I've tasted and they have added pineapple into the pear as a twist.
Birthday boy loved the meal and wants to bring his folks here too in the near future."
"Decent food, great dessert!","Food was good, we had the guinea fowl, chicken, beef burgoinon as well as the steak and fries which was average only. Dessert was excellent - we had the profiteroles and souffle ! Excellent! Will always come back for the dessert! Ambience is warm and cozy , typical bistro experience"
Excellent food,The food was delicious. Recommendation of canadian pork chop n angus beef for sharing were simply delectable even though price was high. To top off the whole night experience was d chef's recommendation was the yummy yummy souffle. We love it the most.
"Excellent food, Great service",Had trouble finding parking that day due to road closures around the restaurant. Called them up to ask for help which was provided instantly.All the waiters were very friendly and our waiter took the trouble to explain the menu in detail. The steak we ordered was excellent and so was the trout. The wine selection was great albeit a little pricey.. Overall experience was very good and we can't wait to return and try something new.
You're in good hands!,"The food and wine here are excellent! Steak tartare - excellent. If you have not had steak tartare before, I would highly recommend it. We left it to the waiter to select a wine for us and what they gave us was really pleasant and went well with the food. This place is very popular so do make a reservation before you go. We went on a Tuesday evening and nearly missed out on a table because we did not make a reservation. Luckily they had a table on the terrace and luckily it was a cool evening."
Trust them to order a meal for you that hits the right note,"I was hosting an interesting group of diverse people who were caught up in exciting conversation. As they did the previous time, the waiters quickly noted dietary restrictions and allergies and provided an assortment of starters and main courses that was delicious and delightful for the vegetarians, pescatarians and omnivores."
Authentic French cuisine in a non-pretentious setup,There is no doubt that the Chef is French as there are a number of specialties that hard to find elsewhere. The soufflé with Grand Marnier is truly delicious.
Good portion but overpriced,"Good quality food, real bread, great portions but too expensive. Especially the wine way overpriced. $85 for a 50cl caraf of house wine is at least $50 too much. Especially for a French restaurant serving French wine."
Great French food,"Nice and small place, with a dining room and upstairs a bistrot style ‘rillettes bar’; an original concept.
French cuisine of course, with a mouth-watering selection of duck, pork, lamb, beef and fish too. But the accent is put on the French ‘canaille’ dishes like pigs head terrine, black pudding, foie gras, duck rillettes etc
We really did enjoy the wide selection of small plates, with some French fries too..
Not a place for vegans of course, but for real amateurs of good food.
The service was really good too: professional, caring and fast: well done guys!
If you still have room, superb desserts are available. Check out the menu.
Great selection of French wines; I am eager to go back and try a couple of them from Rhone valley and Languedoc."
Onglet steak and duck rillettes ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,"We always come back for their onglet steak that's cooked to perfection. And the duck rillettes is soooo delicious and addictive, have not found anything that topped it, even in France!! Set lunch is definitely value for money.
The bistrot is not crowded during lunch time, and you'll always be welcomed before 2pm when the kitchen will close. But reservation is strongly recommended for dinner to avoid disappointment."
Perfect evening,"Wonderful authentic french food and relaxed atmosphere , really a great spot - don’t forget to visit the upstairs bar - great selection of wines - we had a wonderful evening - will be back"
Healthy and delicious,"The food was beautiful and the staff were fabulous. There are plenty of choices and there is something for everyone to enjoy. I will definitely go back and would recommend highly to everyone. I had the duck, it was superb."
A must visit with a French accent!,"Lovely place very well located (next to City Hall) where wine, cheese and other nice specialities are present!"
Visit The Rillette Bar upstairs,"Let's face it, when in Singapore, eat French, and eat it at The Rillette Bar. Cheese at the perfect temperature, yummy bread, great garlic sausage, delicious pate and rillette."
A great find in Singapore.,"A really lovely French bistro off the beaten track. Small, but chic, with great food and an impressive wine list. Really friendly staff too. A really nice atmosphere, and reasonably priced. Would definitely return."
Great French food with great and very friendly staff,"The food is incredible specially the escargots, as good as you could expect if you were in France, it’s highly recommended for the food but also for the people that works there, they make you feel you are among friends!

Congratulations guys! It was really a pleasure

Eduardo from Mexico"
Awesome steak,Headed for the Rillette Bar on the second floor and the thick cube ribeye steak was amazing and well seasoned. Service was awesome and very reasonable price for its quality. Definitely come back every time I visit Singapore
Spot on French,impressed by the standard of cooking in this restaurant. The lamb in particular was excellent. We came for dinner on a weekday night and the restaurant was fairly empty. Didn’t have any issues with the service. The staff weren’t effusive but they were professional.
Lovely dining experience,"My Wife and I came here as part of our weekend staycation. Lovely meal. My wife’s steak was well prepared and delicious. My poulet was wonderful. I would definitely order either of these again. The recommended Pinot wine was reasonably good. The one oddity is that they served us a nice crusty bread, but no butter, olive oil, or anything. Just dry bread. The bill at the end was a bit of a surprise. Maybe not the best value for money, but very good food and I am certain we will return."
"Authentic french, but nothing special, arrogant service included","We came by without reservation on a Saturday night but said we could come back 45 minutes later when a table was available. The service team was initially not interested but agreed to look out for an opening. When we returned we got a table, but it was bizarre that they then took a long time to wait our table and take our orders. We went for two classic french dishes, both tasty like you would expect from an authentic french restaurant, including the fries. We ordered red wine, but I'm pretty sure that what we got by the glass was NOT the same wine as it was presented (in bottle and for tasting) and what we were served. Pretty disappointing that wine experience by the glass. We were all the time polite, including when settling the bill to include a tip. A group of french guys were seated after us, got food earlier and left the restaurant before us. So, if nothing else, the arrogant service was authentic enough. Think the owner need to teach the staff how to handle people."
Good food,Good place for French food but nothing amazing and prices are quite high. Lack of wine by the glass option as it was mostly Australian wine (surprising for a French restaurant).
One of my favourite authentic French Restaurants in Singapore,"The warm ambience of the place combined with the friendly service from the staff and unpretentious, simple French food, makes this place one of my favourite, go-to French restaurants in Singapore.
It feels like dining in your usual neighbourhood bistro in Paris!
My favourite food here is definitely the array of rillettes, can't go wrong with that, as well as their steak tartare and steak with shallots. SO GOOD!
They also have a great selection of wines.
Love this place for a casual date and will definitely come back!"
Excellent French food,"Reasonable top notch French food, cosy place, great wine list, always a pleasure to be here for dinner"
Lovely Food & Service,I had recommended coming to this restaurant for my husband's birthday dinner following dining here for my company's Christmas party. The service here is excellent with the Maitre D' even remembering me from the Christmas party. The food is exquisite as well (especially their mashed potato which is the best I have ever tasted). The only thing we were slightly disappointed about was that the steak we ordered to share between the 4 of us had too much fat vs meat. They made up for it by decorating our dessert plates for my husband's birthday.
Pretty decent French fare,"We ate upstairs in the Rillette Bar, I didn't see the main restaurant section so cannot comment on that. However the bar is cosy, high tables and bar stools and quite a bit of space between them so it doesn't feel that crowded even though it was quite busy.

Very helpful staff, the manager recommended a selection of starters, including their rillettes which were very tasty and decidedly moreish. For the main course we shared a platter of cooked meats, some beef/steak and different cuts of pork. Accompanying this was pomme dauphinois and some vegetables. It was all well presented but I didn't think the meat platter was anything too special. It was perfectly okay but not amazing.

Overall we had a fun evening but was rather surprised towards the end of the night when the manager turned a blind eye to a number of people who started smoking in the bar. We did complain about it, I believe it's not permitted in singapore, but the manager declined to do anything about it. That was disappointing."
What's an Asian chef doing in a French restaurant,"That was our hesitation till our son Gerald (also a chef in Australia) highly recommended the food here. The dinner for two exceeded our expectations on all scores. Well done to a young Asian team. The food was excellent! ""Must eat"" include the selection of in-house rillettes. Our favourite was the duck and we'll be back for the rabbit rilettes. We shared a generous portion of the roast leg of lamb and it was cooked to perfect timing with great flavour balance on a casserole of stewed peas served with mashed potatoes that you have to indulge it and throw all calorie concerns out the window becuase it was worth every mouthful. Typically, we pass the deserts but as we saw the smiles at every table when desert was served at their tables, we decided, why not try! We settled for the earl grey souffle baked to a fluffy puff. The sweetness was beautifully balanced with a refreshingly tarty accompanying French grapefruit. The smallish and narrow restaurant is manned by a busy team that seemed busy shuttling too and fro all evening. The restaurant was packed full and the atmosphere was very lively, like being in a Paris bistro... happy and friendly. Definitely a place to enjoy good food and great service! We had a brief moment to meet the young chef Brandon.. at 32, he epitomizes the new generation of young chefs who are passionate, talented and eager to serve up more than just good food! Well done and best wishes to him and the great team and Le Bistrot De Sommelier!"
Great Spot for Quick Bite,Only had an hour before a tour of The Pernakan Museum so we accepted the invitation to climb the stairs for a pleasant surprise. The ambiance and setting were attractive. Our server was informative both about the menu and the building. We finished off a perfect meal in great shape for an informative afternoon. Definitely a find.
Excellent food as usual,"Scallop tartar was amazing, pork done in 3 different ways - must try! Did not appreciate the 60 days aged beef as much as the other dishes though Duck rilette and foie Grau pate was lovely"
Authentic French food to warm the soul,"An ever reliable favourite when we’re craving hearty French food.
- Escargots: yum, though we weren’t sure why it needed the tomato purée
- Poulet au vin Blanc: our first try and boy, will we have this again. Could taste the white wine infused into the cream sauce. Generous portion with 3 big pieces of chicken and gloriously sweet veg.
- Onglet de boeuf: generous 2 piece portion, fries great and a hearty portion of glazed onion made this dish very satisfying
- PROFITEROLES were the highlight of the dinner. These are the real deal (ice cream, good quality chocolate), none of that whipped cream nonsense. A MUST HAVE

Sommelier was attentive and recommended a good value Burgundy (lesser known commune but still good)"
Vive La France,"I had the pleasure of dining at this fine French establishment on Christmas Eve with Mum. What a wonderful Christmas Eve!

We had a table in Rillet Bar. The country pork terrine was delicious. Served with crunchy French bread, it was a winning starter. Perfect in proportion and taste. The salad selection was impressive too. Diverse territories of fresh flavours served on generously sized plates.

The beef cassoulet was rich and a warm and hearty conclusion to our meal.

Our selected and suggested wines accompanied the food perfectly. The staff were exceptionally attentive and friendly and greatly added to the relaxed French feeling of the restaurant.

I look forward to returning on my next visit to Singapore."
Little disappointing,Visited once before but this time I didn't enjoy the food as much. Service wasn't great either. I doubt we will return.
"Incredible food, generous portions, great service","Service was efficient, friendly and helpful with recommendations. Food was just incredible - you must try the rillette and pates! I had the steak tartare which had the perfect amount of tanginess. The portions were generous but not too much. The atmosphere was buzzing and authentic."
Wonderful place for lunch!,It’s one of the most enjoyable restaurants - the service is great and the food is superb. Love it! Will be back for dinner another time.
Food poisining - intoxication alimentaire,"We ordered a starter with scallops, a beef tartare & joue de boeuf.
The scallops tartare was obviously left in the fridge for too long, the joue de boeuf was tasteless and the tartare..hmmm... both of us got sick and had to leave the restaurant without finishing our meal.
We definitely don't recommend this place even though we had a good experience on our first visit there several months ago."
Great food but...,"We booked a table in advance, we end up with a pooly located one. Food is great but servjce is slow. Also a bit too salty. Good but not great for the price level."
Good charcuterie and cheese selection,A great find with a solid wine menu and lots of cheese and charcuterie options! You should book as it gets pretty busy.
Disappointing,"Went there for lunch a couple of months ago and was impressed by the food and atmosphere. Went there recently for dinner, and that will probably be my last time there.

Three staff to run the ground floor bistro, and they were all inattentive to customers. They appeared to be deliberate to avoid eye contact and many customers including myself hv to wait for them to appear from the kitchen and calling for their service. No sincerity or enthusiasm to recommend the dishes, hv to ask for the wine list, again no suggestion or recommendation for wine.

Prepared to tolerate all these in the pursuit of good food, but what a disappointment. The food is so average, and hence not a good value for money. Had the chef's special of braised beef ribs. Beef was tender enough but the sauce was saltish and overwhelming the taste of the beef. The much talked about onglet was again so saltish and the huge portion of fries just made the dish looked cheap. Less fries, less salt, less sauce to let the beef shines through would be so much better. The rest of the dishes were not even worth mentioning.

No reason to revisit, too many good authentic French restaurants to go to instead."
Average,The food was good however the setup was terrible. I booked the table about a week plus before the date but they gave me a very bad place such as at the corner or near the door where people will walk in and out often. The waiters weren’t suggesting us foos when they saw us so confused about the food. As we ordered quite a lot they didn’t say that the portion fit for 2 person. So we ended up order a lot and wasted the food.
Great food,"The Mont D’or was to die for and the chicken liver pate never disappoints. First time trying the pan seared onglet , beef was great, but what surprised me was how well the sauce complimented the beef. Will be coming back often!"
Perfect Layback French Diner,"I booked with three friends on National Day. We had the choice to eat at the restaurant downstairs which is a little bit more intimate or at the winery upstairs which we finally chose. My first impression was super great, the staff are very professional and attentive and it was so nice to meet someone from Basque Country! They advised us very well on wine and food. They were super friendly which I think is necessary for a French winery. Instead of ordering main courses, we decided to do it like ""à la Maison"" with many platters to share. From snails, to homemade duck rillètes and cheese platter, everything was really good. Next time I am in Singapore, I will for sure go back! Thanks guys for the great service and the amazing food and wine!"
