Best French Cuisine!,"We had a fantastic dinner at Napoleon! For starter, we went for Burrata. For Mains, we had Seabass, Truffle Risotto and Steak. Food was fantastic."
Disappointing,Food quality was decent but not enough to make up for the lack of service and complacency amongst staff members. It was difficult to get anybody’s attention at all and when I did the servers did not appear to have any wish to be helpful. For this I will not consider returning again.
Cosy restaurant serving surprisingly delicious food,"Was pleasantly surprised by how good the food is here… the menu is a little limited but I suppose it’s really quality over quantity… I had the grilled octopus which was a delight and my steak was very soft and tender.

As for the ambience, I really dig the vibes here! It’s cosy for a nice date with your other half. The place is a little small so do make your reservations! Even though I walked in but the wait staff was very accommodating and allowed me in so long as I leave by a certain time. I was more than happy to oblige. Overall, it was a good experience and I would definitely come back again to try out their all-day sharing menu."
Superb risotto,Loved the truffle mushroom risotto which was so delicous!😃 the burrata cheese and creme brulee were also quite nice. Good ambience and service.
Birthday dinner,"I've been 3 times to this restaurant. The first time was amazing and I had the Wagyu flank. I went back a 2nd time and they didn't have the Wagyu flank (but I dismissed it as a one off). I've just been back for a 3rd time (for my birthday dinner) and they also didn't have the Wagyu flank again. My option was another steak at twice the price. I opted for duck and it was 4 slices of fatty meat with about 12 french fries!!!! The host is a great bloke, but the food is shocking for the price. Very, very poor."
Dinner experience,I went with my sister for birthday celebration last Wednesday. We ordered a few dishes which wasn’t fantastic. For example Wagyu steak was oily & fatty & the mushroom soup was too salty. I told the server & he said he will provide feedback to the kitchen but I didn’t get any response thereafter. I m really very disappointed with the experience.
Awesome Friday Night!!!,"Spent my Friday night at Napoloeon and it was nothing but pure bliss. I was assisted by the great General Manager Dimitri, which made my night extra special. The ambience was great and their food really played my palate. Highly recommended and i will definitely plan my next visit. Cant wait Thank you Dimi for such a wonderful experience!!!!"
One of the best wine and food discovery!,"Was considering between a hotel or a restaurant nearby the gym, decided to try this wine bar, and gosh! This is one of the best gem and discovery I had in Singapore!

Happy Hour Champagne was of good value, the white wine (Domaine de la Bongran Cuvee )here was superb, paired very well with the truffle mushroom scallop risotto!

The service here was simply 5/5! JW and Richard engaged with the customers very well. Everything was warm and personal.

Will be back here again after such a good dining experience!"
One of my favourite places in SG!,"Napoleon is a hidden treasure in the heart of the city. I have been looking for a favourite french restaurant in SG for a while and i have finally found it! Its vibes takes me back to Paris streets, the cozy environment, the delicious food (one of the best yellowtail ceviches, great grilled octopus, always great fish options as i am pescatarian), coupled with wide selection of wine or bubbles. The above wouldn't be enough without the friendly staff, especially Dimi he is always very welcoming, makes you feel like home and helpful in guiding you through the menu. I have been there couple times, and we have had a blast each time, it is ideal for a date night or a dinner with friends. 100% recommending to anyone!"
Best Dinner Ever!,"We had a great time. The food is perfect, very authentic French cuisine. The wine choice is amazing (probably the best in SG). Staff is super friendly and accommodating. The GM puts a really nice touch to the whole experience. Can’t recommend it enough"
Price does not reflect food standard,"Had dinner here, food was just ok, nothing great. It doesn’t justify the prices they charge for it. And this is a gastro pub, not fine dining. For appetizer we ordered scallops and cauliflower bites. Scallops came and it was 2 tiny pieces on a plate. This they charged $24++. Cauliflower was ordinary, huge chunks of cauliflower in a flour batter, taste was flat and bland. The dip that came with it helped a bit but not much. This was $14++. For mains we had the seafood risotto and seafood rigatoni. Again, was ok but nothing special, and they charge $41++ and $30++ respectively. I have been to many restaurants here in Singapore, and don’t mind spending on food. But to me, this place is just not worth the money you spend. It’s one of those self-indulgent restaurants which I will not be going back to. Their only saving grace is good staff. The server that tended to us was attentive and helpful, he was mostly around whenever we needed him. Service was good."
Good food,"I have been to this place a number of times, and I must say that the quality of the food has improved. The risotto was very delicious, and so was the fish."
Waiter got our wine orders wrong,Waiter got our wine orders wrong. I ordered a syrah and got a melbac and it took over 30min for us to get our wines. Had to ask 2 waiters. For 6 glasses of reds and roses we paid 158$. Really expensive for what it is. We were also seated literally right next to the toilet. Owner was relatively friendly though.
Well priced lunch menu,"A French restaurant located close to the Amoy food centre. Deco within the restaurant was warm and charming.

I wanted the burrata salad but was not available and chose the cold cut platter instead for my entree. As for the mains, I ordered the pan fried duck breast.

The duck breast was done to perfection and it went well with the sour cabbage that came along with it. Perfect balance of different tastes on one plate."
Friday night dinner,"We were able to book a last minute dinner last Friday. We were seated at a high chair just outside the door but I can't complain (my friend does, he was directly on the spotlight so it was warm)
We ordered beef tartare, steak, and risotto - all of which was pretty good.
we also had a pretty good wine recommended to us.
It was a nice experience for us, no issues on the service."
This will be our first and last visit,"So it was our first time at Napoleon, we wanted something really light and ordered something off the menu, wings and nachos but we're told by the manager/waiter this is a French restaurant and they don't serve such food. Hmm OK so I am still wondering what did he mean by “such"" food. Not even to mention that it was hard to get their attention to take our orders. they seem busy. We felt so unwelcomed.
At the end of the evening we were greeted with a cake corkage charge of $20. Yes, we did bring our own cake there but we were not informed at all there will be a charge. The manager told us ""did you ask?"", ""do u mean that you can just bring your food to restaurants without asking the staff"". oh well I am really speechless with the attitude. Anyway thank you for waiving the cake corkage charge after lecturing your customers. We will not be back."
Friendly owner and good food,We had a mixed plate of cheese and charcuterie with Sauternes wine that was very good. The atmospher is very nice and the French owner very friendly as it is pleasure to be able to speak French.
They hit the jackpot with their new chef,"Napoleon has always been a cozy French bistro. Friendly French owners/managers, nice interior and great wines.
The food was not that special.
That has changed. A new young female chef is helming the kitchen and brings out fantastic food. It is still autentic French, but the quality is superb.
We had the seared scallops and tuna tartar as appitizer. Great, fresh taste and beautiful broth.
The Duck was wonderfull juicy and crispy on the outside. The lamb was pink and came witha nice sauce.
Great job."
Restaurant week set meal,"Restaurant was quite packed and we were seated at a tall table near the door. Not exactly the best spot to see everyone's temperature being taken, but received reasonable amount of attention from wait staff.
The steak was well seasoned and tender. Fries were of the right crisp. Wine-food pairing were great! Quite stuffed even though it was merely three course set."
Atrocious Service,"This is my 1st visit appalled by the service! Asked waiter for another plate of butter olive oil n balsamic vinegar and he just told my brother -in -law finish that plate 1st! Hey there were 4 of us and hr said ph it is meant to be shared. But I told him I have to stretch over to get it and he said meant to be placed in the muddle of the table I domt buy that because there were 2 seperate tables joined tog. M besides tte butter was about to be used up. Came back with another plate no apologies for tardy comment then said lady now you dont have to stretch
Told another guy and his reply was we are cutting cost hey how much does a small plate like that cost!
Food was only so so only dessert was good. No more visit to this place!"
Gorgeous,"Perfect for enjoying excellent French wines and delicious food, a great find. We had a fantastic lunch experience. Intimate atmosphere, awesome service from our waitress. I'll come back when in Singapore again."
Rude Staff,"I came to Napoleon today for lunch with a friend, with the intention of using my soon-to-be expiring Entertainer app. We were told it could not be used so we decided to go to another participating restaurant of Entertainer. As we walked out, the waiter on duty snidely remarked ""Can't afford!"", deliberately in earshot of us and the customers he was about to seat.
Money is not an issue for us but incredibly rude service staff is. Napoleon should look to train their staff on appropriate manners and attitude for the industry that they are in."
Birthday treat,"Went here for dinner to celebrate my birthday. Service was attentive and pleasant. We ordered the foie gras for starters. Mushroom risotto and beef tartare for mains. Loved them all. Wasn't a fan of the aperol spritz though.
Ended of with a birthday desert platter of dark chocolate, tart and merengue. :)"
Busy place,"We decided to go back to give it another try: it was worth it.
Busy evening with apparently lots of regulars, recognized by the staff.
The place was packed but we managed to get seats at the bar: excellent choice.
The staff was very pleasant, chatting and still working.
We tried some cocktails and the lady bar tender did very well, and with a smile!
Good French food, we went for the charcuterie and some cheese. Yummy!
A few glasses of wines from their wide selection helped to make our evening a great experience.
Also, congratulations to the 2 young French guys who helped running the show a nice team all together.
Still a bit expensive, but it was worth it."
Good but expensive,"Nice and busy place, it looks like a popular spot with regular people greeting each other.
A few table outside but the inside is warm and cosy and we enjoyed it.
Interesting menu with a wide selection of small dishes and mains, with a French influence.
The food was good but we were surprised but the small size of the portions and above all the ratio of size to the price...
Good service provided; they all seem to be a happy team working together, and the young ladies were quite smiling and courteous.
Splendid choice of wines (at all prices), and a great selection available by the glass too.
We enjoyed the atmosphere, the food was okay, the bill around $100 per head, which was high for what we got."
Excellent food but expensive wine.,"The pork and beef were very good. The bottles of wine are very expensive, would have expect better for a bistro style restaurant"
"High quality, tasty dishes",I was here a few months ago and really enjoyed the food and ambience. So I recently made a reservation to have dinner here with my family again for my dad's birthday. They were blown away by the quality of the food. Thanks for the amazing experience. Everything was perfect.
Great Food and Service,"Great food, service fast and friendly. I even got a complimentary glass of wine. The steak is superb as was the lobster risotto when I popped back again to ensure my initial sentiments were correct."
A happy experience,Good range of wine offerings with tasting portions and half glasses. Good food. Great service. Very friendly atmosphere and a most enjoyable experience. I have been going back.
Nothing special,"Had the Bayonne ham single cold cut platter starter. beef brisket- a decent cut, but nothing amazing"
Cozy place,"Nice interior, nice ambience, good staff, good food, great wine selection especially by-the-glass. Food maybe a bit overpriced for what it is, but the whole package pulls it up.
Would definitely go again for wine."
Perfection,"Great food, great ambience, great staff, did I remember to say it was great 😉🤩. Ups, going back again tonight 🤣"
Great service and wine,Highly recommended as the service is superb and special callout to Mili! Was impressed by her attentiveness and excellent service! Thank you for making our first visit so memorable! The bar also has an extensive range of wines and food is good too!
Best Taste for a Decent Price,"The food taste soooooooo good there! I ordered the steak main and scallop salad as starter. I don’t know what secret recipe the chef has put in, they just all taste amazing!"
Thumbs up,"Cozy ambience, very friendly staff, delicious foods. We had the dessert, I recommend this place. Keep it up guys! I will surely be back..."
Delicious food! A must visit(:,"Had dinner here on a Saturday night. Everything we ordered tasted delicious, especially the beef tenderloin and the accompanying foie gras. Prices were really affordable as well considering the quality. My partner and I left the restaurant extremely satisfied. Keep up the great work!"
"Lovely ambience, decent food","This is a small, cosy restaurant located in the Telok Ayer area. It was very quiet on the Monday that I was there, perhaps because of the many other food places in the vicinity. Service is good, and food was decent. Lunch now is only limited to the set lunch menu, which was disappointing."
Aglio Olio spaghetti way below expectations,"I’ve been here once before for dinner, had some platters and pesto pasta, it was really good. But my recent lunch visit was way below standards. Even cheaper pasta was better than what we had today. It was honestly bad. My friends had the same and I could see they were struggling to finish. Lunch is certainly bad time to visit, no ala carte and the set menu’s tomato soup was too salty and lacklustre, aglio olio was bad (and its hard to make bad pasta to me), dessert was slightly better. Really disappointing, for the prices, I wouldn’t come here again. Definitely not for lunch."
"Great food, excellent service","Had an enjoyable couple evening here. Food is great, service is excellent especially Jamie, who is attentive & explain each dishes upon serving"
Great food,This small and cozy restaurant serves amazing French food at very good prices. I keep returning and recommend it fully!
Cosy place with great service,"Service staff were friendly & attentive. Food was really delicious, but the portion could be bigger."
Napoleon,Lovely food and friendly service - the beef tartare was especially good. I would definitely visit again.
This is good French food !,"Traditional and genuine French cuisine, great wine list, nice ambiance. The perfect place to have diner with friends ? Yes, if you forget the bill. It hurts! Oops..."
Kitchen Staff asleep in the bar ?,"Really not nice to see kitchen staff slumped over the chairs some sleeping, some on their phones. Highly unprofessional."
Great food with good service!,"We had our set lunch there. Even with the few options, we were satisfied with the generous portions. Enjoyed the steak, even though mine was a little overdone for medium. The foie gras was excellent. Enjoyed the good coffee and desserts too! If only some of the chairs are not too high for the table, everything would have been excellent."
Nice French restaurant in CBD.,"Quality French food, large portions. Good atmosphere and quality wines. Best for dinners, lunch time can be very crowded and kitchen is slow."
Great food and service!,Great food and service! One of the better beef steaks in town. Their lunch menu is superb Such a hidden gem. Will be back!
"It's vegetarian, there's only a little bit of chicken stock in it...","I asked the waiter whether the mushroom risotto was vegetarian and he replied with a resounding 'Yes.' I said are you sure there's no chicken stock in it and he said there's chicken stock in it, but only a little bit. Enough said."
Great food in a vibrant neighbourhood,"Overall Napoleon Food & Wine bar delivers a very nice experience. The food is great and the atmosphere all around is vibrant since you are in the middle of the business district.
Only negative worth mentioning: service can be slow even if it is not too crowded..."
Not a 100% excellent,Food was good except for the beef/steak - it was raw when asked for medium rare Coffee was served late for about 30 mins. Doesn’t make sense when we were one of the few left in the restaurant. Everything else was good though.
Cosy and yummy,"Good food and wine, cosy ambience, friendly staff, punny wine posters. And great value if you dine with the AMEX card. Many good experiences here and will definitely return for more."
Excellent service and food,This is probably the 4th or 5th time I have been here and the service and quality never disappoint. Celebrated my girlfriend’s birthday because this place was the only restaurant that met our expectations of excellent service and quality food. Thank you Napoleon!
It's very average,"Inadequately staffed. For a medium sized wine bar, there were only 3 waiters. Inattentive service. We were ushered to bar seats even though we made a reservation and there were empty tables. Poor knowledge of wines. We asked for a certain wine style and the sommelier proceeded to look through the iPad for a recommendation. Food was much better but nothing to shout about. Won't be returning!"
Cool and cute place !,"Elegant and cosy wine bar. Very good selection of wines - you can order half glasses so you can taste different wines, that is very interesting - also you can share plates and the menu is also attractive : the scallops & truffle carpaccio is really nice and the Foie gras is well cooked."
Horrible service!,"Used to patronise often. Staff are very rude and displeasing to regular customers. For reasonable food & wine, along that street, there are plentiful beautiful French bars. Best advise to avoid this restaurant. Sadly, the food is good, service is bad. Pick your choice wisely... experience matters in Singapore!"
Pleasant Surprise,"Came here without much expectations as we were just exploring restaurants in the entertainer app but was surprised by the portion and quality of food. The duck rilette was recently done and came in very generous portions. Went well with the bread which we were offered more but decided to save our tummies for dessert. We both had the beef tenderloin with fois gras which was tender and delicious. Ended the meal with the mini Lemon meringue tart duo which was a good ending.With one free main using the entertainer, our dinner was a steal at less than $80! With the quality of food and cosy ambience, we would gladly pay full price and will definitely be back"
Quality food and portion is a laughing stock,This is my first time and Last. Service is bad and food quality is below expectation with the quality and quantity below standard. The price is high that’s for sure... shall never recommend to anyone for fear my reputation is damaged. Spend more than $500 for a table of 5 and left your premise feeling sore and sour. Thank you.
Birthday Celebration,"Had an amazing time at Napoleon celebrating my birthday! The service was good! Staff were attentive! Food was great! Finger food prices were reasonable but mains were abit steep but, does shows quality and portion! Will visit again for an occasion. Good job guys!"
A very fine evening,"My friends and i enjoyed a very nice dinner on Saturday night at Napoleon. The food was quite good, the wine list is also good but the service was exceptional. We hinted at some things that we would like and like magic they appeared. I was extremely impressed. This made our whole evening very memorable."
Great French Food with a twist.,"I only write reviews when is it very good or very bad. This is obviously in the very very good range. First of all the ambiance is amazing as you feel as if your dining in a private wine cellar. The well stocked bar is spacious with two good German beers on tap. A Weiss beer from HB and a German lager. The wine selection by the glass is amazing and the choice by the bottle just as good.
Our group of four started with Duck Rillete, fois gras, tomato soup, tuna tartare and a burratino cheese. All were really good. As a pasta dish we had the angel hair with truffles and shrimp although I would drop the shrimp from this dish.
Main Clyde’s were mainly the port and Duck Magret awesome.

The highlight of the night was when I explained to the sommelier that one of our group did not like wine and was expecting a Guinness! Before he arrived the owner Valentin went out and bought 6 Guinness which he did not even put on the bill. Imagine my friends surprise as he sat down and was brought a pint of Guinness. Priceless.

The only shortcoming is that our server at the back table lacked character and hardly spoke. All the rest of the staff were amazing..."
Perfect for quick business lunch,"Classic comfortable decor but with lots of twists, calm ambiance which is ideal for conversation, and attentive staff (combination hard to find elsewhere). The set lunches are fantastic value - I've tried pretty much all of them. Good choice, super quality, just the right size for lunch (not to small either) and well balanced. I have not been in the evening but for a lunchtime business chat, hard to beat in the CBD."
Ruined my date night,"I seriously doubt the integrity of the restaurant and its service staff. Made a booking via Chope but staff refused to let me order the Chope Exclusive Set Menu, claiming that I had to purchase the set directly from Chope before dining there. Not sure how many people they scammed... wrote in to Chope about this but they did not reply.Food was ok, but didn’t enjoy the meal due to a lack of privacy. All the diners were crammed into a small space! We could hear other diner’s conversations clearly. Needless to say, our date night was marred by this experience."
Great food in a cosy place,Great food in a cosy place. Had the fish which was excellent. The wine selection is also quite good. The service is good as well. So there is no complaints on my side :)
Delicious Food and Awesome People!,"I am totally impressed with the people (and food) of Napoleon. Our appointment with the restaurant is at 630pm and I ordered our food from the friendly waitress first as my friend is still walking from the MRT. Within 5 mins after my order is sent to the kitchen, there was a sudden huge downpour. Hence, my friend was stuck just across the road without any umbrella. I quickly informed the lady waitress and she rushed into the kitchen to inform the chef to put our food in hold. It took another 10-15 mins before the rain eventually got lighter and my friend finally reached. I was a little caught up with my friend arrival and did not even realised that the same waitress had already informed the chef to start cooking our food. I was even more surprised when the food was served after awhile and obviously the Angus Beef Tenderloin is one of the best steak we ever had. Thank you for such a wonderful experience and to the very tall lady waitress who assisted us, thanks for being so amazing!"
"Good service, unpretentious food",My second time dining at Napoleon and I left with my heart and belly full. The service was really good. Really attentive and sincere staff from the time we arrived until the end. Food was yummy and with good portions.
Great ambience!,Nice cosy place with great decor n good wine selection! Food was delicious as well. Going on Friday evenings need to know that parking is packed.
"Bad service, bad taste!"," 
I dislike writing bad reviews because, believe it or not, I find it far harder to write them than writing effusively about I place I have enjoyed. But on this occasion, I feel compelled to do so because of the really poor experience I had here.  When choosing a place to meet a friend, it was a toss up between a Japanese restaurant and Napoleon, I chose the latter mainly because they had a promotion offer for Amex Platinium Card holders under the Love Dining Restaurants programme - 50% for a party of 2.
 
Anyway, my friend and I ordered our drinks and food - my friend ordered a pasta from the pasta tab and I ordered a steak from the “Mains” tab on the tablet pc. 

At the end of our meal, when I asked for the bill and produced my Amex card to pay, I was told by the waitress that the 50% promotion only applied to ""selected"" mains, and since my friend had ordered a pasta, that was not a ""Mains"" and therefore we were not entitled to the 50% discount but they were ""happy"" to give us a 15% discount.  I explained I had looked at their terms and it simply says the condition for the 50% discount was ""a minimum order of two (2) à la carte main course food items are ordered.""  I called for the manager who said that the order had to be from the ""Mains"" tab on their tablet.  However, to my mind, a pasta is also a ""main course"" as opposed to a side dish.  I tried to explain that I did not know that ""Mains"" and ""main course"" meant the same thing.  To me, anything that was not an appetiser or side dish was a main course. I also explained that the waiting staff did not mention it when we made the order.
 
However, the manager, who sported a sour disposition and didn't even try to be pleasant, simply refused to budge, and said that they had other promotions and couldn't be asking every customer which card they were paying with.  But in truth, they only have one card promotion, and that is with AMEX.  The others are like Entertainer etc which are not card promotions. I’ve been to other restaurants and they do ask if you are dining on any promotion and they explain the limitations of the promotion.
 
What is even more disappointing was that I had saved them a customer because earlier when a customer requested a low table because a friend was pregnant, and was told that they only had a high one, I volunteered our low table and took the high one.   I shared this with the manager but he was unmoved and simply showed a sullen face and didn't care.
 
But for the Amex promotion, I would not have gone there.  Their ala carte dishes weren't exactly cheap and whilst they try to make the food look expensive, in truth, they were quite ordinary.  And their wines weren't cheap.  I ordered by the glass twice - one was $17 and the other $20 for a ""full glass"".  Just be aware that their ""full glass"" is just 150ml.  Their ""half glass"" is really no more than a straw suck.  And these weren't even for really great wines.  To be fair, the wines were just decent.  In the end, the bill came to circa $150 for two persons, with the 15% discount.  I recently visited another French restaurant (the name of which I am not allowed to disclose according to the rules of TripAdviser), and frankly, the quality of the food, the charming ambience and the excellent service are several notches above Napoleon's in every aspect.  They are a class act compared to Napoleon.  I spent $160 there without wine, but also without any discounts, and had a lovely time there and we were stuffed with high quality food, competent cooking, lovely ambience and showered with excellent service.  
 
Suffice to say, it brought a bitter end to the evening, and their uncompromising approach means it will be my last visit ever.  There are many better restaurants to go to.  They could have taken a gracious approach to give us the benefit of the doubt, but clearly, the manager wasn't interested.  
 
Money is not the issue here; service and attitude is.  In my opinion, your money is best spent elsewhere, even in the CBD.  If you are still going there, well, you have been warned.  All the best!"
Beef dishes are delicious,My husband and I went for our first dinner last night at Napoleon. We ordered beef tartare and beef steak which are delicious and didnt stop to catch a breath through the meal after its served. The portion of tartare is quite generous. The downside is we waited for 20mins which I considered long since we came into the shop around 9pm which I believed is long past dinner rush hour. We didnt see any patrons eating and most were sipping wine. Definitely a place for wine connoisseur as their wine list is extensive and we saw many variety of wine taps. Interesting place! Hope to be able to try the wine on our next visit.
"Good food, great wine recommendations and nice atmosphere","We went with a group of friends and got a nice corner table. The sommelier recommended some wines and even let us try before we chose a bottle. (We didn't quite understand the promos he tried to explain to us though.) Food was great, leave space for dessert! It doesn't come cheap though, as is to be expected."
Really good food!,"My friend and I had the crostini platter, baked bone marrow, herb-crusted lamp rump, and iberico pork. All of the dishes were fantastic, especially the two starters. Will definitely come back again!"
Friday night chill with BFF,"Love the ambience, both of us yakked for 6 hours while sipping wine and had some food. Food was great. Would visit again..."
Excellent Wine,Excellent Beef Tartare.. Lamb was good as well but a bit chunky. Wine was excellent as usual. Unfortunately Oysters wasn't on the menu that night
Outstanding French Bistro and Wine Bar,"Near the heart of Singapore's CBD (Central business district), Napoleon is a great spot for delicious food, happy hour pricing (until 8pm) and a wonderful assortment of French wines by the glass. It is a great spot for locals and tourists alike who might desire a taste of more"
Amazing wines & food,We mostly had starters and some wine and it was all really amazing. It’s small but has a lovely evening ambiance. I’ll be back there again for sure.
Hidden Gem,"Was there on a Saturday evening for dinner and surprisingly it wasn't too crowded. The ambience makes a great date-night setting.

While ordering through the iPad felt a little impersonal, it was a breeze and the menu was easy to navigate. When the starters arrived, we asked the waiter for further recommendations - he was very friendly and happy to share with us more about the popular dishes and various credit card promos.

Everything we had was well-executed - the presentation, textures and flavors. My favourites include the scallop carpaccio, pan fried foie gras, and grass-fed beef tartare.

In short, great drinks, food and service (waiter and manager). Also very value for money if you have entertainer app/Amex platinum card.

Will return again soon!"
Underwhelming,"Our reservation was for 9:45 on a Saturday. We were told last order was at 10pm whereas when we were making reservation through Chope it gave us slots up to 10:15pm, so that didn’t make sense. Any way, there were barely any people. We had to order from an iPad with no suggestions, help, recommendations. We ordered a large cold cuts platter which came with only two types of cheese and the waiter brought the bread basket afterwards and the oil, vinegar and butter later than that. We shared the truffle gnocchi between us which was served on a flat plate and had terrible texture and lacked flavor. It was covered in watery gravy which was hard to scoop out for the flat plate. No Parmesan or fresh ground pepper were offered. Looked like they just wanted to close up for the night. We had high expectations but quite disappointed.The place looked like it had potential but sadly failed."
Great place to wine & dine!,Celebrated my friend birthday there. He likes to drink wine and he enjoy the selection of wine offered at this restaurant. The food is great too. The bone marrow dish is so good. Must try!
Good wine bar,"Nice wine bar near Telok Ayer, french style, although Singapore prices. Variety could be improved though."
Lamb & Beef Steaks done right!,Came here as promoted by the American Express Love Dining program. The standout dishes were the medium rare beef that was very good as well as the soft tender lamb that melted in your mouth. The bruchetta appetizers were so so only
"Charming place, good food","Charming place with some interesting decor and romantic vibes. We had the angel hair pasta, steak and lamb; all were great, in particular the steak."
Love the lobster risotto!,"Foie gras was okay, duck was so good it took me by surprise! Star was the lobster risotto. Would definitely order both the duck and lobster risotto the next time im back."
Disappointing,"I was part of a large group where we had a pre-arranged menu. The steak (while delicious) came served with 1 stick of asparagus and the equivalent of one chip diced into 9 tiny pieces. That’s it...absolute rip off. Dessert was boring, starter (Burrata) was delicious.
Also, the waitress was really, really grumpy. Come on now, a bit of a professional smile & attitude would have gone a Long way.

Overall...disappointing and not worth a second visit"
Seventies throwback,"Sorry but food shouldn’t be like this any more, times have moved on. Started with prawn and avocado salad - the avocado was non existent, the prawns kind of ok, the dressing dull. Main course just grilled salmon on a tiny bed of leaks, very little flavour or garnish. You shouldn’t get away with this in most other major cities. Overall poor I am afraid."
Totally Wow-factor dinner at Napoleon last night!,"The tartare was fresh and delicious, the bone marrow was to-die-for (beautifully prepared) and the steak was absolutely mouthwatering. Luckily we skipped the tempting-looking cheese platter this time around and headed straight for the Chocolate Ganache. Professional, friendly personal service from the French manager Erwan was the 'cherry on top.' A bientot, Napoleon!"
Enjoyed the steak and will be back,Took the Amex offer and this is my second time The steak is pretty good . Crowded on Friday night . The starter bruschetta with cheese is delicious !
Really really good food!,"Really surprising! We had two little starters to share which were very tasty. Even as the steak and the mushroom risotto, everything was tasting excellent. Cool aspect was the Ipad which you can order with. Friendly waiters and many good wines that can be ordered per glass and are located in 3 climate cabinets! Great place!"
"Good service, good food, lots of darkness","Went here last night - was keen to try out a new place in hopes of finding a new regular haunt.

Service was good, food was good (we had the cold cut platter, avocado and prawn salad), choice of beers was ok (only two on tap).

Unfortunately this place gets really crowded, and it's a bit dark and cramp, probably better for couples to get cozy."
Incredible high quality service,"Manager was exceptionally good, having excellent suggestions on wine, ensuring we would never leave the place not being 100% satisfied. We will come back soon !"
Yumz!,"Decided to try this place because of the Entertainer app and was very pleasantly surprised! Service was pretty good, fairly attentive but not intrusive. Really enjoyed the food and excellent selection of wines. I thought the prices were decent for the kind of place it is (hipster area, cosy fine dining). Food is not particularly creative which is perfect if you’re looking for a place with simple but good food. Would definitely recommend, would come back even without the entertainer discount. Recommend the platters and lobster risotto and honestly just about everything else on the menu :)"
"Good food, subpar service and disorganized staff","Food wise - the food is good. The wine is good. I've been there for an event with finger food, as well as a cheese buffet and they served good quality cheese and cold cuts for $12++.

Service - very disorganized. Manager briefs staff in front of customers when the Buffet is supposed to start, so customer's have to wait for briefing to be over. The buffet was supposed to begin at 6.30pm but we had to wait around 15 min before they were actually ready to begin.
Staff doesn't know what kind of wine is being served, seem abit lost.

Basically if you are fine with good food but messy service, then go for it. If great service is important for you, avoid it."
CNY special cheese and cold cut free flow,I had a great night on the 15th Feb. The bar organized a special event with unlimited cheese and cold cuts !! We had so much cheese that it almost felt like a night in France !! Please do more events like that !!!
The worse bar in Singapore,"This place has the worst bar manager in the whole of Singapore. The bar did a cheese cold cuts special on Chinese New Year’s Eve but ran out of bread within 1.5 hours. I asked the manager whether they would serve more bread and the manager aggressively said that the Ts and Cs of the deal stated that they serve until stock lasts. The manager did not apologise for the lack of bread to go with the cheese but criticised me who was a customer for complaining and not reading Ts and Cs!

The cheese and cold cuts were substandard and not worth the money. On promo email sent to us, it said 1 for 1 if we bought a bottle of wine at 90 SGD or more but on the night the manager said it had to be at 120 SGD!!!! We had to show their email to prove what they advertised and they then reluctantly agreed to honour the deal.

Overall this was an awful experience and I would highly recommend the restaurant owner reassess its staff and management in order to keep its existing customers."
Good food,Yummy tasty lobster risotto and tenderloin with foie Gras. Food took a while to come. Service was good
Great steak and risotto,"Loved the steak and risotto. Double loved it with entertainer! Furthermore, attentive staff and great cosy ambience."
Amazing Napoleon,"It was not my first time here but food and service still amazed me.
Was really impressed by the herb crusted lamb this time and their amazing lemon tart dessert. I love the vibrant atmosphere and the great service. Even the wines were excellent but reasonably priced which was the perfect final touch to a great evening. I definitely recommend !"
"Good wine, good service",Solid bar for wine and very good service. Perfect for after dinner drinks. Need to get there early Thursday and Friday to get an outside table.
Choices of wine,"It has plenty of wine selection and detail description. The place has limited seat, you may need to do a reservation or just come early."
Napoleon,"Great food, service for main a little slow compared to normal. Steak is superb. We never have room for dessert!"
Great food,"Dinner at Napoleon was a lovely experience. The food was excellent and the wait staff were friendly and helpful.

The prices are not cheap for their portion sizes but they are all high quality and well cooked. We used the Entertainer app vouchers which helped alleviate the prices.

The atmosphere is lively but not too loud so we could still have conversions easily.

I would definitely revisit this restaurant."
Good Food,Food was good. So was the atmosphere and service. Slightly pricey though. Recommend for after work gatherings with friends.
