My Brunch,I Am has been in business for a long time. I did not know it serves food until one day I passed by and saw the big menu! Everything is cooked from scratch. I had the Portobello Benedict. I was delighted to see alpha alpha on the topping. It was a scrumptious meal. The owner Jam is friendly and warm. He takes note of feedback. Best of all Brunch is available daily till 4pm! A wide section of food and beverages. I love their home made chai latte: top notch quality. Nice taste f the spices. It is served with a cinnamon stick and a piece of complimentary chocolate cookie which tasted nice. Desserts are made by the owner's mum.
"Great Hospitality, Burgers and Beef Ribs","We have a tradition that on the last night of holiday we go back to our favourite restaurant of the trip, and this time it was I Am…

On our first visit we shared the Boss Burger which was as good as any burger we’ve ever had anywhere on our travels, and the biggest, tastiest jalapeño poppers. My wife and I shared this with our 2 year old, and we were all delighted with our meal.

For our last visit we ordered the chicken burger, I had the beef ribs, and we shared some wings - which the guys were kind enough to serve with the sauce on the side so our daughter can have some - and those got hoovered up by everybody.

The beef ribs were so juicy and tender I was able to simply pull the three ribs out, and tear the meat with a fork. They recommended the garlic sauce for a bit of spice, and they were absolutely right.

The chicken burger pulled off the trick of being really crispy on the outside and succulent on the inside, and the whole thing was super tasty.

A special mention for the team there - two guys just doing great food, drinks, and hospitality. Thank you very much for looking after us so well, and we really hope I Am… helps you towards your dream of moving to Amsterdam."
Poor execution,"The fries and cheese balls were good. Pizza, fish and chips, and pizza were poorly executed. Food was bland and pizza was soggy."
Ten Thumbs Up,"First visit to I AM on 24 December 2021 for dinner with family. The location was easily located.
SOPs are still in place as we are a big family of 10. No issues in seating us separately. The staff are very friendly and polite at all times. The food were delicious and the portions were worth it. The ambience was perfect for us.

Will definitely recommend to our family and friends. We are definitely going to be the returning customers! Kuddos and well done!"
Excellent,Food was great and service was great too. I enjoy every moment especially the fish and chips and the portion is very generous and the charcoal burger too.
THUMBS UP,"Will definitely come back soon. Me and my partner truly enjoyed the food and service at the restaurant. Employee (male, cashiering duty at that point of time) ensured that everything was according to our liking and comfort. I truly appreciated that. Overall good food and good service!"
Great Ambience and Great Food,"Food is great, especially the charcoal grilled steak was smokey & awesome. Was windy n cooling Sunday morning and we have ""alfresco"" lunch on the five foot way. Impressed. Recommended Place!"
Iam cafe,A day reservation. Went easy. Arrived with table set for 4pax. This is before the newest safety measures.
I am review…,"Dine in experience was ok, food was good but serving was not hot. Price is on the higher side Overall : average high"
-,it was a great experience and it was my first time eating there too. very fast service and the workers are very friendly indeed. thank you!
"Great Food, Value For Money!",We had 1 for 1 steak which was very nicely done and very delicious! The service was tip top and it wasn't too crowded. Overall we enjoyed our time there!
Suitable for kids. Nice ambience.,. Huge food portion with affordable pricing. We enjoyed our stay there. My nephews enjoyed their food and ambience. Thank you!
I Am...what happened to your burgers man,"Felt like hamburgers at Arab st area so we went to I Am cos hadn't been there in a long while. Boy have they changed. Our burgers have gone downhill. Dry burgers man, seems like their idea of a juicy burger is to stuff it w tomatoes. Geez dropped close to $200 for 3 adults, 3 kids, and it was disappointing. Sides Jalapeno Poppers and Sriracha honey wings were awesome. Work on your burgers man what happened?"
Good food,"Couple of friends and myself had the burgers and they were of good portion size especially the patty. Except my order of the Belle's burger which were half or even a quarter the portion size of my friend's burgers which was largely disappointing. Fries were just fries, albeit the fries were left out and not fresh so that's one thing to improve on."
Way below expectations,"What a vast difference in hospitality from the last time I went(a few years back, highly raved). In a disappointing manner that is.

First off, I made a reservation a week earlier but frontline waitress claimed they were unable to retrieve my contact details and what not.
I was more than happy to reassure the staff, I pulled out the email confirmation. Another waitress came to assist, in hopes that she’d be able to enlighten me that my reservation was there. To only come back to me and said the exact same thing as per the other staff earlier on.
Again, I showed a screenshot of the confirmation status. Yet, she chose to tell me that my reservation has not been confirmed. It clearly stated confirmed (‘: After which, she snatched my phone from me to have a clearer look on the screenshot, didn’t even ask permission if she could have my phone. She still had the audacity to explain to me that all these customers seated had made a reservation prior.

SO DID I.

Now on to the waiting time for the food served, god knows how long it took. Perhaps a full house, but even asking for mayonnaise to go along with the fries, took forever.
Dessert - Rainbow cake.
Again, my friends recalled how fantastic the rainbow cake tasted back then. But what was served, a dry-looking rainbow cake. Not only it looks dry, tasted dry on the throat. Barely finished half of it.

The rating simply reflects on how terrible the customer service was. Starters and mains, pretty average, but the dessert was a letdown.

Had to really compliment on this malay teen waitress whom attended to my friends and I. Very polite, basically her customer service is tip top. Prolly the filipino waitresses should learn from her (:"
3rd lunch visit on 12 Sep 20,"We have order 2 set of main course and an hot latte.
-Meal 1 Cajun-spiced grilled chicken burger, the chicken fillet over grilled on corner and bottom part of fillet become bitter taste.
-Meal 2 Rosemary Poussin(fried half chicken) also over fried or been fried number of times and tasteless BBQ dressing. The side dish half portion of corn also tasteless without/ forgotten apply sour and butter(my opinion).
-strong milk taste hot cafe latte lack off coffee taste.
-Both main course burger and fried chicken quality & taste have been drop comparing with my previous visit"
Great burgers,"Burgers were good and service was ok. Sat upstairs, which was a cosy area for group hangout. Food portion is excellent (so much fries with the burg!!!)"
Very comfy atmosphere!,"Loved the upgrade of the cafe with air conditioning on the second level! The atmosphere was comfortable, and the food was enjoyable. The fries might get cold if you eat slowly, though, but nonetheless it's a good place to enjoy a meal on a hot day! The service was superb as well, all the staff were friendly!"
Food,the food was good and yummy. Only service was not good and food is alittle pricey place is near landmark hotel convient to find way.
Simply worth it!,1st time dine in at I am...it simply worth it!with friendly staffs tat was simply accomodating giving us a chance to try out chill out ambience on the upper deck!n the best part of all.the bdae boy loved the rib eye steak!simply delicious! thumbs up! overall loved the foods n friendly service..will come bck again nxt time for sure...thk u I Am...keep up the good service frm the heart n maintain ur delicious foods!
Brunch 21 June 2020,"Arrival at the restaurant only to realised that we were the first reservations to arrive. They were not ready to receive guests, at 11am. Eg. Air-conditioning not ready and 2nd floor dining not ready for seating. At least the staffs were welcoming and friendly. Food portions are reasonably economical. Do not gauge the portions via online menu - cos you will be surprised at the difference. The environment is WONDERFUL if you want to have a quiet and decent private conversation before the main stream of patrons start pouring in about noon."
Food Haven!!!,"The staffs are super friendly, great place for family dinner! Food is served fresh and piping hot! Menu is superb! Place and environment is great!"
Staffs and Food,"The service was great, the staff was nice and went extra mile for us to ensure we have a great dinner. The food was exceptionally amazing and the portion + price range was great!"
The drinks were a major disappointment. Skip it and go with water .. its healthier anyway!,"The food and portion was good. Service was okay. However the drinks we ordered were too sweet! My V.Mojito was basically just syrup and water, couldn't taste the lime at all. The same goes with the Cranberry GT and Nutella chocolate, (very diluted). Its too sweet, and thats about it. Very disappointed considering a glass of drink cost about $8!"
Great Steak Great Service,"Best steaks we'd had for long time. The service was excellent. When one menu item we ordered wasn't available, we upgraded meal for same price. Would thoroughly recommend I am for snack or full meal. Great location near Arab St."
Food was mediocre,Food was great overrated. Although service staff was nice but they can be slow. Have to keep reminding them abt our requests. Place can be quite noisy.
Misleading dish!!!,Went for dinner with my friends and we ordered the jalapeño poppers but you know what we got??? BELL PEPPERS!!!!!
"Fantastic Service, going beyond for their guests","We sent an email to the restaurant for a group booking, and received prompt responses and correspondences. The manager, Kyra has been very accommodating to our needs and requests. They allowed us to use the space for an hour to do our activities before we order our food. They were also very welcoming to our guests with their prompt service and smiles. Appreciate it a lot! Thank you."
Disappointed,"The food was not up to expectations however service was good. I think it is not value for the money I an paying even though it is considered affordable for a cafe opened in Haji Lane. Overall, poor experience, food is disappointing and service is good. Will not go again."
worth to try out,Can try to call the restaurant before you make the reservation as sometimes there are plenty of seats in the restaurant but didn't appears on the apps. Staffs are friendly as this restaurant required customer to order online but there was some issues on their website so they manually took my order. Recommended I am... Platters for seafood lover!
Lovely rainbow cake!,"The rainbow cake it's really nice and perfect for kids!! The café is in the heart of the Arab quarter, and I definitely recommend it!"
Delicious Cake!,Do not hesitate to try this cafe! Good coffee with delicious cake. Service is fast even with big crowd
Good food,"Food was just as i've expected, and i like the idea of ordering via scan code, booked for 7 people and we have the 2nd floor by ourselves"
Prepare to wait 40+ mins for your order,Was told it would take 15-20 mins for the burger. I waited 43 minutes and then walked off just as it came out the kitchen. I had lost my appetite by then.
Good food.,"Food was good and served fast. Only one setback, I actually requested for a bday special for when I order a cake there. But when the cake came, there was no special like a bday wish written or bday song. A bit disappointed"
Awful coffee,"We were craving for ice coffee to chill us out from the hot day.. However, it was so disappointing. The coffee just doesn't taste right. Sad.."
Bad customer service,"I would like to give my feedback on your server on the 2nd floor (a lady phillipino server) when I dined at your cafe today at Haji Lane. My reservation was for 5 covers.

When we arrived, our table was configured as 3 adults + 1 baby chair. When i told her that my reservation was for 4 adults and 1 child, (5 covers) she seemed puzzled and insisted that the seating arrangement was correct. I told her that we need 2 more chairs and no need for a baby chair as my daughter is 10 yrs old, plus I did NOT request for a baby chair at all in my chope reservation.
She gave us 2 chairs and removed the baby chair with an unhappy face and no apology was given to us.

We seated ourselves and she went back to serve other customers on the same floor.

Patiently waited but no menu was given to us while she actively seated new customers, gave them the menus and took their orders promptly. In the end, we helped ourselves to the menu and still, no initiative from her to come to our table to take our orders seeing that we already have the menu on our table.
I was pissed and decided to go to the 1st floor to submit our order as it was already 6.55pm.

When i reached the 1st floor she saw me and she intercepted by saying that she will take my order (which was already too late anyway)
Instead she got another server (a hijab lady, i didnt catch her name) to take our orders.

We were there to celebrate my mother’s birthday and it was a bad start after the way she acted towards us as the paying customers."
Excellent Service,"We visited this restaurant recently to have dinner and to celebrate our colleagues birthday. We were served by a very charming beautiful lady mamed Theresa. Ad this was our first time, she was patient with us and recommended the best choice of meals from your menu. We truly enjoyed the sumptuous meal. We would highly recommend this venue for any event. Compliments to Ms Theresa for her excellent commendable service, her lovely hospitality and her charming smile. She made sure her customers were comfortable throughout their time in I AM. This is a True Singapore way of Service Culture. GRAND SALUTE FROM YOUR HAPPY CUSTOMER. Best Regards, Ms Jasmine Kaur.♥️⚘"
Nice ambience but...,"Their signature burger didn't live up to expectations. The portion was generous though, the burger patty was SO dry and I couldn't finish it. I want to give them a second chance and may come back for another time later..."
Tasty Cake,"My girlfriend and I stopped by for a quick dessert. The BW Russian Cake was pretty good. Unfortunately it was also a bit pricy (S$10.50 for 1 slice), but we still enjoyed it."
Excellent services,My second visit there. They have never failed to deliver the best service ever and needless to mention about their yummilicious food
Amazing Amazing Amazing!,"This place is truely amazing, the atmosphere and food are out of this world. I went there with my wife yesterday and it was the best meal of the day. Have the burgers, the beef is sublime."
I am..not recommending,"Food: 7.5/10

The calamari was rubbery and wasnt fresh. The salad that came with the ribs were old and had a bad after taste.
The rest was okay, well portioned.

Staff: 7/10

There were 2 people on the floor and we can see that they were running around. We noticed that 1 staff was giving smiles left and right but for some reason could not give us one (we're giving the benefit of doubt that she was tired from the lack of man power). The other staff was kind enough to waive the calamari when he realised we didnt want to pack it because of its condition.

What I am surprised is that when we asked to help with the cake we bought outside (which we asked permission if we could have the cake there). When we asked for the cake, they just gave back the cake, still in the cake box.

I would have given a lower score if it wasnt for that 1 staff that helped us with the calamari, he was attentive to us during the dining period and apologized for the mishap."
Lite Bite,"Dropped in one night after a long day and the food was tasty, the staff were quick and friendly. Portions were good and prices reasonable what more could you want."
Delicious cakes!,"They had an app to order which was very convenient. If you use the app, you are able to get vouchers for your next visit.

I had the rainbow crepe cake, and my friend had the meringue cake. We thought the meringue cake was chocolate, but it was actually blueberry jam base. It was quite sour, though. The rainbow crepe cake was good, with chocolate cream in between layers. It was quite good too but too big in my opinion. You might want to share if you've had a heavy dinner :)"
I am..OTH,Delicious Food! Great ambience! Brought my mum to this cafe to celebrate her 60th Birthday! She thoroughly enjoyed her meal and experience. Thanks Hambali!
What a great place!!,"Wife and I here for 5 days and ate here twice... mainly because of the Turkey Bacon BLT (and the house baked roll and spicy mayo!!) but also the owner (I think he is) couldn’t have been nicer and is a champion bloke. Great service, food and a funky vibe on the cnr of Haji Lane with a cooling breeze makes this place a massive winner for us!!!"
I am ......okay.,Only place open on the area.Got a Amsterdam vibe going on. Price are a bit high for what you get .service good.music pretty cool. Good WiFi. Coffee was good.Breakfast average for Singapore 🇸🇬
Great Food & Service,Food is great & the staff are friendly. When one of the staff knew that I had a cough & she immediately brought me a cup of warm water. I guess this is more than just Service ... Passion & Care ... Great job folks
Wonderful service,"The staff at I am... at HomeTeam NS at Bukit Batok made it a truly pleasant experience for the 28 of us who were there as an end of year celebration. Not only was the food good, the portions were really value for money, but more importantly, the staff were friendly and cheerful and provided attentive and prompt service. With 28 noisy adults, you can imagine that things could get confusing and complicated, but they were systematic and efficient and got everything right. They even surprised us with dessert which wasn’t part of the special set we arranged. As we were leaving, they suggested we take a group photo at the club lobby, and helped us organise it. Kudos to Arina and the B.B. Team!"
Nice restaurant,My 4 yo able to took part in their eat play discover while i eat my food peacefully.. painting is good!
Customer Focused and Sumptuous Food,"We were a party of 7 and had just finished the Clip n Climb Session next door. We decided to check out the place and were treated with a warm welcome by the Waitress and the Manager as well. They answered all my queries and were very helpful. We had 2 kids and a toddler along as well and they were interacting well with the Staff there. Hats off to the Chef, as all our food came within time and it was all cooked to perfection. Thank you to the Staff and Manager for the pleasant experience."
Really good restaurant,Yummy food and really good service. We were with our baby and the waiters were really nice and looking forward to make us confortable. Great place
Delicious Burgers,"On my 3-day stay in Singapore I decided to get some western food, after having Asian food only the last weeks ;) so I was looking for a good Burger Place and found it near the Arab street in a very lovely and cozy alley.
The restaurant is well designed with a lot of elements of the Netherlands. The staff was friendly, intent and quick.
Had a Burger with Onion Rings and Cheese inside. Very delicious, but with 22,50S$ (incl. Service Charge and TAX) not really cheap. The French fries could be a little a more crispy, but that’s a matter of taste.

Paying with credit card is no problem and they don‘t charge you a fee.

Would recommend that place if you are looking for a good burger!"
Awesome stuff!!,"Early Nov 2018, i was instructed to organize a farewell dinner for one of our senior men. I decided to choose I AM CAFE Home team NS BB. I liase with 1 awesome guy namely ""Aziz"", his great!! Word cant be described about what he has done.

At I AM CAFE Hometeam BB, the big day. The seniors namely Azlina and Siti were again never disappoint me. They assist will lots of things and took all of our orders very professionally(30pax, i mean).

Overall, i'm plz to say I AM Cafe, u guys have done a good job. Food... ""wow"" (thats what u can say).

Kudos to Aziz, Azlina and Siti."
"Good food, good service","We loved the food and the service. We ordered soft shell carb burger, tiger prawn puttanesca pasta and honey & whole grain mustard beef ribs. The ribs, especially, does not disappoint. Meet is tender and goes well with the sauce. Our food server was also friendly, attentive and gave suggestions which helped us decide which items to order. Overall we had a great experience. Will definitely come back and recommend this to friends and family. To our food server Theresa, thank you."
Great service,The food was pretty good even though it was quite expansive. Had a great conversation and service by Theresa. ‍♀️
Great service,Had a pleasant dinner with great service! Theresa was very helpful and polite. Would definitely come back again!!! :-)
Excellent service at I am Cafe HomeTeamNS Bukit Batok on 9th Nov 2018,"We made a reservation for about 30 pax. The place and ambience is appealing.

The customer service was excellent. They welcome all guest with warm greetings, taking all the orders adequately and lasty they ensure that all guest have received their meal.

The staff here rendered very friendly services espicially Siti & Arina, they went the extra mile to check if the guest had enjoy their meal.

Special thanks to Siti & Arina to ensure smooth delivery of the event. I hope the company would not overlook their committed attitude."
Excellent service and good food!,The staff here are very friendly and nice. The ambience of the restaurant was good and the food is delicious. Will definitely go to the restaurant again. (;
Deepavali chill session with family,"Dropped by for drinks and light snack.

Ambience is very chill even though we had kids with us.

The food is awesome. Love the velvet cake they served us.

Good choice of music.

Staff were extremely accomodating to our group.

Overall experience, we really enjoy the place and will be returning in future."
Great steaks,"Steaks and burgers are great! Meat was very tender. Our server Theresa was very helpful.

The cafe is great for hangouts and is relatively family friendly."
"""Just to tick it off the where to eat list...""",Love the ambiance though it could be boiling hot once the place gets crowded. Food's super yum... but it's pricey. It's once you ate wont coming back to eat place. The servers arent welcoming and smiling (hope they should since theyre a go to eat place).. the girl that served us was never even smile at all
Rainbow crepe cake!,"Honestly not a bad place for food and esthetics wise. The sloppy fries were good. The rainbow Mille Crepe was alternately layered between buttercream and chocolate filings.But getting the service staff attention from the second floor took some effort. I had to walk downstairs to get them to serve the dessert. They should have a bell for each table to ring for service from downstairs since we are paying 10% service charge.Water is self service too. I did want to try their soft shell crab burger, maybe on my next visit. They do have long tables for big gatherings. Witnessed a group of friends have a birthday celebration."
Not as it was used to be...,"I love,love I am cafe ever since it’s opening with it’s family vibes and great food.Staffs were great and atmosphere was super.However now it has been reduced to oily and tasteless food. We came for the ribs all the way from the North but no ribs available for the time being because the factory got burnt down apparently.If a heads up about this was made notified on their IG page or anywhere,it would’ve help tremendously.Disappointing and for the meantime,I would bring my money elsewhere."
Excellent in their service,Good food ..ambience. and very polite and friendly service by their waiters. Will come back again for their food.
"Food not properly cooked, seafood not fresh","The pasta was too salty and the prawns were undercooked. The seafood platter was not fresh. With this price, I can easily get better ones out there. The only saving grace was only the Filipino waitress who was attentive and kind."
Wonderful surprise,"Nicely arrange interior, very friendly staff and vivid vibe. The Iced Cappuccino and Iced Matcha Latte were amazing. :-)"
Friendly service. Food is ok,Ended up at this place because another one was closed. Food wasn’t bad but nothing amazing. Standard ok. Service was good and friendly.
The rainbow cake is overrated.,We ordered their red velvet and rainbow cake. Both were disappointing. The cake is not tasty and the frosting was sour. I would not recommend it.
Great place.,"We came across this reataurant as we walked down Haji Lane. It was busy, which is always a good sign. We sat down and browsed the menu. All the foods sounded good. We settled on burgers. I got a red one. The food was tasty. I can't say if it was expensive or not as I was a tourist. But it was worth it."
Hipster haven,"this place reminds me of Williamsburg Brooklyn its the place, to rub elbows with young stylish patrons in swank settings. very instagramable but not my favorite place to actually eat. That rainbow cake is dry and melts super quiqly in the heat"
Dinner at Bukit Batok Branch,We love the ambience and walk in 8pm. Fast service. Good food. Would love to have a small variety of salad to choose from.They have a good range of drinks tho. Myy fav is this virgin mojito.
Good spot for a light meal,The restaurant was easy to find and fairly crowded for a holiday night. We got seated immediately and our order was taken quickly. I had the baked mussels and my partner had the pizza. The mussels had good flavor and were a bit chewy. The pizza had a crispy thin crust and nice fresh tomatoes. The bill was quite reasonable.
Great taste,"Having great location next to Haji Lane and not far from Bugis MRT, this restaurant offer a taste of Amsterdam. A little pricey but most importantly i like the taste. All-in-all i would give thumbs up!"
"Good food in touristy area, generally good service - but pricey","I stumbled upon 'I am' for lunch after an appointment at nearby Raffles Hospital. It's in the middle of a touristy area which means you never know what to expect as far as price and quality. At first, once I sat, i felt a bit neglected - it took a while to get someone's attention. However, they eventually seemed to notice and paid nice attention to me. This is a burgers and others type of restaurant, but i chose soup and salad - and both were incredibly fresh and tasty. In particular, the tomato soup had a nice blend of meatballs, spices and pasta inside; the salad was super fresh also with an array of tastes. All of this goes to show this place pays attention to quality and delivers, so well done. I'm not sure this is a destination restaurant, but if you're in this area, it's a solid good choice, particularly if you need Western food."
Very good for first experience,Visited for the first time and was impressed with food especially the burgers and my friends was impressed also.
Superb service,We are suggested to have e upper deck and Great cosy ambience.Our order came fast and the food was superb.Lastly i had the crew to assist with a mini cake presenting as we its our sister birthday and all went smoothly with the coordinating.Overall all of us are satisfied.Thumbs up I Am...just to highlight...this is not my 1st time here and wasnt dissapointed at all again
Nice and private,Sat upstairs because it was a bit hot that day. It was nice with no one else up there. Casual place. Only had some drinks for a quick chat. Haven't tried the food yet. Wish they had some fresh fruit juices... cold pressed would be best.
Good food,"This place is recommended by my friend, quite happy I can make table reservation online using Chope."
"Terrible food, service, and prices. Should die.","Went to this “restaurant” for lunch.
Waitress needed to walk away for her “moment” before she even took my order. She was so lazy, it was like she was annoyed that I was asking her for something special. I have rarely seen worse service.
Still no interest in what was going on in the restaurant at which she was effectively the host.
Ordered food.
Had to leave my table to ask for cutlery and napkins. And that took another 5 minutes, as if I was really asking for something special.
Drink arrived at table. Warm. Needed a lot of ice. It was a can of Coke Zero, I’m not asking for something special here.
Pizza arrived. Terrible. This was a pre-made pizza that had been fried (who fries a pizza base?) and then put onto a wooden platter to fake a real pizza.

I have to say, I ate one slice and left the rest. It was simply disgusting. Who adds oil to a pizza base? Imbeciles.

Really just a very poor experience.

Staff and management need to close.

This restaurant should die."
Good burgers! 🍔,"Good burgers, good selection and serving size is satisfying. The jalapeño poppers were very good! I am avid burger fan, to my standards, I think the beef taste and juices could have been stronger. Good service. Overall a good place and surely worth a visit if you are in the area. Great place to visit in the evening."
"Great Service, good mains & atmosphere",Everything was good(lovely burgers) except for the rainbow cake dessert which looked great but was dry and hard.
Flavours,Fantastic amazing great trendy excellent drinks delicious dessert.Great place to socialise.With Friends family or work mates
It was good but a little crowded and can be chaotic,"It was an experience that I almost did not get to enjoy due to the crowd which I think could be the one downside of this place. However, there are multiple solutions to solve this issue. One of them is an app, Waitrr where I simply choose my food and pay via this app."
"Over-priced Asian style ""western food"" & crappy service","Typical ""western"" food you'd find all over Asia. So, not great if you're from a Western country but the locals seem to love it. Service is sub-standard & pretentious, which at least is consistent with the hipster establishments in Australia which they seem to be trying to emulate."
My first visit,"The seafood platter is fresh & the burger is delectable - fresh juicy beef patty. That is their Rainbow latte that is beautifully presented. Not on their menu, need to request for it."
Not Fantastic,"Went to I Am to celebrate 2 colleagues birthday.

Ordered a platter to share, fries, 3 pastas & 2 burgers. Our mains took quite a while to arrive. Last to be delivered was our 2 burgers. By the time we got the burgers, a colleagues had finished her pasta. Burger buns were not toasted...beef patties were hot though. Cheese on the burgers didn't melt thru.

Personally, I will not be returning to I Am. There are other better pastas & burger place around the area."
Can try...,The drinks nice and super expensive... Spicy red Burger was deference taste. Overall it was gd experience.
"good service, average eats and price","this is quite a nice place. we dropped by for a quick dinner after shopping at haji lane. the menu is western (pizza, pasta, burgers, steak). the mock tails are not too bad. the service is good. the waiter was patient and gave recommendations on the pizza and drinks. the shrimp loco pizza we ordered was quite good - thin crusted. it is al fresco dining, so it was nice to sit and eat and enjoy the evening. get a table on the other side (not the main area) - a good place to people watch."
Great place to catch up with friends over dinner,"Celebrated a friend's birthday here and we ordered the burgers and pasta. Good food, good service and great that the place where we were seated is air-conditioned (on the second floor). Reservations are also accepted which is good for planning meet ups with friends here too."
Quick and good,"The meal is good, the price okay, the ambience is so so because it is so open to the street where people walk and passing. When we came they gave voucher for dessert in their linked group restaurant."
Strong flavours!,"Tried the chicken linguine pasta along with the special Belle's chili bun burgers. Pasta had a lot of delicious meat for its buck, but the sauce got quite salty towards the end. Burger was pretty good, as its patties and buns had a complementary mix of spices and oils. Mocktails are quite ordinary and little in quantity. Also, sitting along the roadside of Haji Lane to eat cafe food has its own appeals, just try not to visit when it's raining, as the number of working seats will decrease."
Amazing coffee!,Such helpful and friendly employees :) great juice and coffee! Ordered a latte and got an extra espresso! Employee pointed us in the right direction for our further travels
Overpriced burguers,"Does that boss burguer on the menu look good to you? Ok, let me tell you one thing: it’s just not worth it.

The burguer sells for 18 SGD. Now having that the thing they put on top of the patty isn’t real bacon; that the mayo is good, but not great; that the patty itself is overcooked; and that if you add a drink, plus service, plus taxes, your bill will get to 25 SGD; would you buy it?

I had seen this place many times and wanted to try it, but it was just not worth it. It’s nice, food it’s average though and prices are two high for quality here in Singapore."
Friends bday,"First time being placed on tbe second floor, i think the atmosphere is rather good. Enjoy eating tbe food as well it was good just that the portion seems abit lil? Love the drinks definitely! service can be a little bit better and more willing i guess"
Quite good,"Burgers were good, this place is not the cheapest but food was tasty and it was a welcome respite from the heat. It was reasonably quiet when we were there over a weekday lunch so service was prompt, no complaints."
Review,The food was nice and worth the money. Was given a long table for 8 instead of for 6 which we initially booked. Overall 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Great tasting food,"Only learnt of this restaurant from my Friend. We came with reservation on the second floor and realised that the first floor is already full.

I had found the menu to be interesting and localised western food. Had ordered the burger and found it to be very tasty. The other mains like the ribs looks and tasted good, portion is big.

Had enjoyed my meal there."
Food and service are not consistence,"We arrived as the first customers, food were delivered promptly. The burgers selection are awesome but the pasta that we ordered tasted differently even though we had the same pesto pasta. It took quite a while to get my hot drink which i had reminded the crews twice. Overall it's a place quick brunch because it's very very hot."
