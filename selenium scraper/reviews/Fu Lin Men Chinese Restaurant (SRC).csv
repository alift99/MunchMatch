Food is always consistent & never fail our expectations. I can’t fault any dish as all are cooked with love."
YUMMY FOOD & HAPPY DINNER at SRC,"Thanks the Fu Lin Men chef had prepared the birthday buns for my grandma and of course very very delicious food. Many many thanks all of you guys here for celebrating this special birthday . My grandma and Our family really enjoyed it and had a lots of fun .

Strongly recommend dine in here w family."
Fantastic food & excellent value!,The food here is amazing! Great selection and all very well done. Staff are super helpful and friendly. Great value too! The peking duck dish is really excellent. 2 thumbs up!
Best Peking Duck and Service,"I was celebrating my mother's Birthday on 15 Nov 20 at Fu Lin Men Restaurant (SRC).

I am a fan of Peking Duck but this place serves the BEST Peking Duck in Singapore. The skin is crispy. The bun is thin unless others. The set meal is also value for money.

The Service is excellent. The Manger, Sharon was always attending to our needs. She took care of us all night long. Her service staff, Zhang Ping was just as attentive as well.

Sometimes, people go to a restaurant for the good service provided, even though the food is just normal.

However, we have the best of both world here i.e. service and qualify of food.

Excellent Experience and Service. Will return to eat."
Great service!,Delicious food and excellent service from staff. Value-for-money good quality food. Enjoyed my time with family in great ambience.
The best peking duck in sg,"Skin crisp to perfection with overflowing juice while staff perform the cuts up is simply temptingly killing. The fats that filled up the whole mouth is heavenly and not overly greasy. Service provided is also matching to the great taste, unlike some place that usually has temper and attitude when the food is highly demanded. Definitely my new favourite and will come back again. Recommend to pre book before coming to avoid dissapoinment as its quite full and almost no seat. Luckily called earlier to check."
1 for 1 chef's lobster set,First time at the restaurant. Ordered the 1 for 1 chef's lobster set which is worth the price. The food is good and friendly staff. Overall a pleasant lunch experience..
Every dish was great!,"First time here on other tripadvisor’s recomendation and it did bot disappoint. Every dish was fantastic, wok hey on the hor fun elevated the dish. Couldnt be more happy with the service and food. Grandma usually picky with eating out loved every dish. Ordered the tofu, asparagus, deepfried prawn and corn flakes, and braised pork cartilage, yam paste for dessert! Cant for our next visit!"
好吃,"食物美味卖像佳，北京鸭是我们首选，配料比其它餐館多元化，套餐物超所值，前后來品嘗了好多次，张平的服务态度很好，我会介绍朋友到來用餐。Very good service and scrumptious food, definitely recommend to bring your family for a meal here. Cosy ambience."
Good and worth the price!,"First try to this restaurant, all the dishes is nice and tasty...missed the picture for toufu and fried rice and both are very nice as well!!! The waitress are all very friendly and professional!!!! Will sure visit again"
"Best Peking Duck, Great food, Good Service","Great value, good quality food, impeccable service pretty much sums it up. A Sunday morning yum cha family gathering at Fulinmen, thoroughly satisfied. Captains and Manager bother to remember customer's names, offer free desserts to regulars, and knowledgeable with the dishes they serve. Chinese quality dishes with good a selection of dim sum only over lunch. Current promotion include Peking Duck. SRC members enjoy service charge waiver. Definitely one of my go to place to yum cha."

Today we have a nice Shou Tao decorate very nice by the chef and also the birthday mee suan ...overall the food is good and reasonable which recommend by manager Sharon. Highly recommend going there for lunch and dinner."
Dinner at Fu Lin Men Restaurant,Arrange a dinner gathering with my family. Foods were up to expectation and with excellent services from Sharon and her team. Will definitely return for more foods.
Delicious food and nice ambience,"Was at Fu Lin Men (SCR) for dinner on weekend. The Lobster Meal was worth every cent and calories. It was a 6 course meal that includes, prawn fritters, hark cartilage wontan soup, lobster in pumpkin and cream sauce, baby abalone, seafood fried rice, dessert. We also ordered their salted egg prawn which were very tastful.

Restaurant Supervisor Zhang Ping was attentive and prompt to serve the chinese tea. He patiently explained the dishes upon our query and gave good recommendation on the dishes. We were very pleased with his good service.

The whole family enjoyed the food so much that we made our next dinner appointment as we left the restaurant."
Warm atmosphere,Had not been to the restaurant since COVID2019 Circuit breaker. The service crew are still friendly and restaurant still continue to maintain the fantastic quality of food. Food are cooked and served pipping hot. Their dimsums are the best too. 宾至如归。
Amazing service and unforgettable food!,"Had my wedding lunch here on 12 Sept. I really must commend Ken Wong the sales manager and Sharon the restaurant manager for their amazing service. Felt really thankful to have chosen this venue for our wedding day. They were always patient to answer our questions and random phonecalls. Throughout the period of uncertainty in planning for the wedding, Ken was always updating me on the new advisories and loosening of restrictions. Sharon was also very helpful to advice on what would be best for our guests and in terms of the flow of events. The food was needless to say really unforgettable. My only regret is not being able to finish my food on my wedding day :p"
BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION,"celebrated my son's birthday with tim sum on sunday, 4/10/20. once again, i'm not disappointed with the dishes served tho service was relatively slow due to a wedding reception. i'm glad that the restaurant served portion of 5 pieces instead of the usual 3 in a basket when we are 5. this is a good way to save both money and food, very wise of the restaurant. the char siew soh was most well liked by all, the skin crisp and fluffy with lots of char siew, very unlike some that i've eaten when the char siew is too sweet. in all my family enjoyed the tim sum and will definitely go again .
thanks to Sharon, we were served a plate of birthday 'soh-tau pau' to complete our birthday lunch."

Great food!,Best Chinese food my wife and I tasted. The beef was good and the cereal prawns are even better. I went during lunch hour and it wasn’t even that long of a wait for such delicious food
"Excellent food, excellent service and reasonable prices!","I really enjoyed the food there as the dishes are uniquely prepared and the ingredients are very fresh! The list of yummy dishes are long but of special mention are the cereal prawns, they are big, firm and very tasty, and so is the steam fish with the nonya sauce, the best I have ever tasted and will never fail to order this whenever I visit, which is very often! The staff is ever ready to serve you with their smiles and their attentiveness. You must give it a try to appreciate this restaurant!"
EXCELLENT SERVICE AND DELICIOUS FOODS,"We just had a dinner at Src Fulinmen. We really enjoyed here. They had a good service, their staff very friendly and professional service. The foods so delicious and nice decorations . Strongly recommend: shark fin soup ( I forgot to take the photo ). It’s really nice and now have a good price with promotion 50%. I saw another table had barbecued Pecking Duck, it looked delicious and fragrant, Next time we will try."
Awesome food and service,"I went there for lunch . Had their dim sum and a Peking duck. The food is awesome especially the egg tarts and the duck . The duck was on promotion so it was super worth it!!
The service provided was also awesome especially by the manager Sharon Quah. She was attentive and meticulous!
Will definitely revisit again!"
Awesome food and service,Went for a Sunday lunch at 1230pm for their dimsum and 50% promo on Peking duck. Dimsum was really good and so was the Peking duck. Recommend to reserve beforehand as it was full house when we reached. Luckily we have made reservations before hand! Wonderful service by Sharon.
Tim sum,After cb finally can go back to my favorite restaurant to eat time sum. Missed the time sum still so yummy especially the double boiled soup is really really yummy. Thanks again to Sharon who recommend us the soup.
Awesome Dim Sum,Amazing Dim Sum so fresh and delicious. Service was exceptional friendly. Price was very affordable. Highly recommend this restaurant in Singapore Recreation Club.

Delicious Food and Good Customers' Service,"I always like to go to this restaurant for a meal especially for lunch or dinner with friends, colleagues or family gatherings. They serve delicious chinese dimsum, cuisine. The restaurant manager and her crew are very friendly.
I like their dessert esp yam paste, wasabi prawns, peking duck. Ambience is good too.
Indeed a good dining place to visit."
Excellent Service and Food,"We would like to thank Sharon at Fu Lin Men (SRC) for coordinating and helping us out with the wedding banquet prep to her fullest. She ensured that our needs were met and despite our short notice of holding the wedding (just 3 weeks of making the decision to hold the banquet), she was able to respond to every of our requests promptly.

On the food:
A very affordable and unique food options for a wedding banquet. The seafood meesua, pumpkin chicken broth soup and the abalone piece under the veg menu were our guests' favourites! Really satisfied with the flexibility of the dessert choice as my guests were not restricted to only one type of dessert choice.

On the restaurant facilities:
Fu Lin Men (SRC) was my top choice amongst the FLM branches because of its location and view (right in front of Padang). No pillars were blocking guests' view and the space was just very cozy for 50 pax for wedding. Lighting, carpets and interiors were well-maintained.

Thank you Fu Lin Men and Sharon!!"
"Nice dim sum, fluffy steamed Ma-Lai cake","Yummy dim sum, especially the fluffy and delicate Chinese Steamed Sponge Cake (Ma-Lai Cake). Also the Fried Dace Fish Ball with Preserved Clam Sauce, and Steamed Beef Ball, not easy to find them in Singapore."
Awesome Service from Supervisor Mr Zhang Ping,"We have enjoyed our family dinners at FLM SRC outlet during Phase 2.

Food taste and presentation are identically excellent. Moreover, we are indeed impressed by Supervisor Mr Zhang Ping, he is extremely professional and attentive, we have tried his recommended dishes and we are glad that we did.

We look forward to next pleasant family dinner at Fu Lin Men."
Covid 19 Phase 2 period visit for dinner,"Althought visit here during phase 2, but safety management is tiptop precautiously when we drove into the building. Really enjoy the food and the restaurant. Staff are very very polite and professional to serve. Food is cantonese cuisine. Soup is famous cantonese soup (long hours to boiling in slow fire), ""Iberico"" meat is juicy and tasty with tipping sambal chili. Fried chicken with ginger...great. Tiger Prawn with vermicelli noodle hotpot is the best, exactly not waterly in pot.
Portions ain't small, stomach full."
Good Food & Service,Was here for dinner on a weekday invited by friends. The quality of food is comparable to Chinese restaurants in some 5 Star hotels. Highly recommend the Peking Duck and Claypot Duck Meat with Ginger & Spring Onions. We are very satisfied with the overall experience and will definitely come back ☺
Nice and value for money,"My 3rd visit to this restaurant and dinner this time - nice and value for money, especially the Peking Duck and good service too."
Good traditional Chinese restaurant,Have dinner here with family. This restaurant is not restricted for club members. The food quality is very nice and the price is also ok.

Tasty food & ambient atmosphere,"The service is excellent and the stuff very polite and friendly. We loved the food as well! Perfect for a quiet and tasty meal. I loved the asparagus, mushroom and cashew salad! Their noodles too!"
Good Food,This restaurant provides good food and the prices are reasonable. The place can get quite filled up especially during Fridays and weekends evenings. Service can be improved during peak times as the staffing is limited.
High Recommended for gathering!,"The service was excellent. Staff are attentive to having the pot of tea refilled and top up our cup even if we drank just a little bit.

They have many food choices. I went with my friends for a CNY gathering and wow! We have many choices to choose from and we had a hard time choosing because all the food in the menu are what we want to eat.. Definitely will be back to order the others that we didnt manage to get.

They were quick to change our plates and ensuring we have a clean plate to start with after dishes that has gravy that made our plates messy.

Staff are all customer-oriented and do chat with you and asking your opinion about the food which i think it's excellent. They can collect feedback from all walks of life the many preferences each of us have."
Highly recommend!,"Highly recommended. The service provided was tip-top, the staff was very attentive towards us, they will ensure we will have clean plates after every few dishes, refill the tea.

They will also check on us if the dish served was satisfactory.

Menu was comprehensive, too much choices to choose from. We had a hard time to select the dishes."

CNY Celebration,"great time celebrating Lunar New Year with a group of old and new friends. the food as usual didn't disappoint me, for many of my friends, it's their 1st visit and glad that they have enjoyed the yummy dishes. CNY without Lohei is simply no celebration and many agreed that theirs was well mixed and delicious. i specially like the asparagus with different types of mushrooms and black fungus. the combination was superb and presentation on a 'basket' of fried bee-hoon added beauty to the simple dish of veggies. yam paste was chosen to complete our meal and is my favorite dessert at all time. thanks to Sharon & her team of staff, for providing us a private room to laugh and chat without worrying about other diners. also for their efficient and excellent service."
Excellent service and food,Excellent service and food is good. Great place to have meals here as the ambience is cosy. Rates are reasonable.

"Good foods, convenient location, good service and reasonable price!","Good foods, convenient location , reasonable price , excellent service.definately, will recommend to friends ."
Ignored,"We walked out after being ignored for 20 minutes. Weren't even given menus or offered a drink. Felt unwelcome, like gatecrashers at a wedding."
Excellent food and service,Service we received was excellent. The food is tasty as well. Recommend the Peking duck. Environment is good for discussing business as well since on weeknights restaurant is not very busy or crowded.
Very good,Especially zhang ping has the best service attitude. Appreciate to has him to serve us. It is a wonderful experience
Good service,We were being served by the supervisor 张平 ，he was very attentive and serve with a smile. It makes the dining experience a very pleasant one. Best service!😊
Revisit for stomach,"It has been few months from last visit, food quality and taste are even out-standing among Cantonese cuisine restaurants in Singapore. This round superdish is the dessert: Coconut mousse with ice cream..i have 2...A Splendid restaurant always."
"Excellent cuisine, wonderful service, beautiful restaurant!","We dined there in the middle of December of 2019, and it was also a weekday. The restaurant was not crowded, so my first memory is how AMAZING the service was! We felt like we had rented out the entire restaurant for just us (2 persons), and were treated as if we were VIPs. The staff was so fast, efficient, professional and friendly. I prefer quiet restaurants, so this was simply perfect for us. We loved everything we ate! I posted 2 pictures of what we ate; exact names of the plates, I don't recall. However, one was scallops and one was chicken; both exceptional. We also were given rice and a complimentary mango pudding, which was soooo delicous! (The mango pudding is on the menu to order.) We also ordered our own hot tea, also very good. When the bill came, we were given a 10% discount from the manager, as a kind gesture for the Holidays, as we were there close to Christmas--so kind of her. THANK YOU! She also called for/ordered a taxi for us, as well as waited for the taxi to arrive downstairs in the lobby to take us back to our Hotel. She really went out of her way for us, above and beyond service. We definitely recommend Fu Lin Men as everything was PERFECT! If we ever return to Singapore, we will also return to this restaurant in a heartbeat!"
"Food was ok, good service","The reason for 3* review was because yes, the food was ok. Nothing fantastic or wow factor. Serving was pretty slow. Ordered 2 appetizers and 1 of it was only served after 2 or 3 main dish. So.... what is appetizer?

We've ordered jin long chicken, broccoli with scallops, marinated jelly fish, soft shell crab, sweet and sour pork, stir fry beef, prawns with mayonnaise, yam paste. Yeap, as mentioned, overall ok. No complaints. But no amazingly wonderful.

Service was prompt and courteous though.."
Lunch,"Reserved a table for 5. Got setting wrong. Set up table for 4. Thankfully, was not crowded then. Service was good. Ordered some dim sum like char siew bun. Siew mai. Har gow. As we were a table of 5.they accommodated our request for 5 pcs each just for degustation. Fried carrot cake with XO sauce. Dim sum was OK. Ordered their famous Peking duck. Was good. Done 2 ways. One way, duck wrap in egg crepe.
And the other way, duck meat with Ee Fu noodles. Both ways were good. Chef was out helping clearing tables serving! Will recommend."
Superb authentic Chinese Restaurant,"A great hidden restaurant in a great location. The food is on point, aided by genuine authentic Cantonese master chefs who have plied their trades in HK. The dishes are authentic and progressive at the same time. The service is impeccable. The view over the Singapore Cricket Club also provides a beautiful backdrop for the amazing meal. We went for a family birthday celebration and we were so looked after, including post meal birthday desert for the birthday boy!"
A hidden gem!,Found this place while on vacation in Singapore. It’s part of a private leisure club but you can get access to the restaurant which is open to the public. Sweet and sour pork is a must as is the special fried rice with egg strands (which was amazing). One of the best Chinese restaurants in Singapore.
Excellent service and good food,"My favourite dishes were Beijing Roast Duck and the Yam Paste. The Beijing Roast Duck was tender, not too dry yet not too oily. It goes very well with the accompany bao & wrap. The Yam Paste was not too sweet or thick, the consistency was just nice. I love the service, friendly staffs.

Just that serving of the dishes was slightly slow, but still acceptable. We sat at a round table directly below the round ceiling, so we can hear echo from the surrounding tables. I'll request for the tables by the window the next time if possible for a good view of Padang.

Recommended for good food, ideal for families gathering."
Best Chinese Food Restaurant,I very like their food.It was very delicious.The service staff also is very friend .Great ambience too.Definitely will revisit.
Dinner,Food is value for money. Ambience is nice with very friendly staff who will provide good service and recommendations. Never fail to disappoint me whenever I visit.
Dinner,"Good service, friendly staff and nice ambience. Staff was good in recommending good food. Will come back again!"
Chinese Restaurant with GOOD food at fair price in the Central Business District in Singapore,"The Cook is from Hong Kong, who came to Singapore many years ago. The basic cooking style is cantonese, but with adaptation to the Singapore palate. The Food is extremely delicious and yet the pricing is reasonable, much less than what other equivalent restaurants in Singapore charge. The Cook do come out with NEW interesting dishes.Must try their Peking Duck, Soy sauce chicken, shark bones soup, just to name a few. The place and ambience is nice and fairly quiet. Good place to have business meals. Staff is very attentive and provide excellent services."
Our favorite meal of our Singapore,"Our favorite meal of our Singapore trip! Authentic, quality, upscale Chinese food with wonderfully attentive service. Prices are moderately high but still worth it.

Located inside the Singapore Recreation Clin, it seemed to be an unusual place for the restaurant, but it works. The club is rather snooty do our tourist warm weather clothes seemed to fire off red flags when we walked in the club doors, but the restaurant was graciously fine with it. If possible, you’ll feel more at ease if you dress a little more formally for this place, but we did not have advance warning."
Dim sum,"2nd week of November, 2019, my friends and I having dim sum at SRC Fu Li Men. It has quite a variety of dim sum. Although it is normal dim sum but we enjoyed. The foods are fresh and delicious. I especially like the mango salad roll and chicken feet. The chicken feet texture are soft and good taste. The Sichuan dumpling also taste good although it is a bit spicy. I like crispy salmon skin as well, it is fresh and crispy.
The price are reasonable and friendly staff. The service is good although it is a busy business day on Saturday.
I like it, will go again and will recommend friends go for try the food there."
delicious dim sum,"invited by a friend who celebrated her retirement this year. SRC has quite a variety of dim sum and tho it's the usual stuff for dim sum, we enjoyed the food's freshness especially prawns roll. i specially like the szechuan dumplings tho i'm not a fan of spicy food. perhaps it's a saturday and many families tend to gather for lunch so it's noisy as compared to my previous visits. in general the service is as usual efficient and good."
"Delicious, Friendly staff and exceptional customer service","We placed order for Chef's Lobster Set-1 FOR 1.
The starter with mince prawn taste good. The soup although with one dumpling was refreshing and tasteful.
The 10 head abalone braised texture was captured with each bite. The lobster with pumping sauce was sweet and savoury.
The Supervisor, Zhang Ping, service was attentive & courteous.

Customer-Robin Tan"
Great for large groups,"We came in here based on the Trip Advisor reviews and they fitted us in in spite of it being busy. However, its a large space which is great for large groups but not really suitable for couples, or in fact for parties of less than 4 or 5.

The food was tasty although not especially hot and the service good. The menu again is really set up for groups with larger dishes designed to be shared rather than individual ones."
70th Birthday,Surprise with longevity bun. We didn't even ask for it. Great food with good accompany! Keep up the good job!
Posh but good restauranr,Very good chinese restaurant in Singapore. Service little slow but you need to enjoy conversation and food. You really need tripadvisor to find it - basically invisible from outside.
Best meal in Singapore,"We had lunch and totally enjoyed the food and the amazing Service. Sharon and her staff were wonderful and the Chef even came out several times to see if we enjoyed his food. The Wasabi Prawns, Coffee Pork Ribs, eggplant and all of the Dim Sim were delicious! Can’t wait to go back again! Thank you Sharon"
