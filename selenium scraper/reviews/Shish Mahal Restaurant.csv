"Excellent Service, Good Food","Good food and excellent service. Accidentally ordered chicken tikka with extra spice. It was too spicy, & we requested to remove the spice, the manager, Vijay, however gave us a fresh plate of Chicken Tikka!! Very hospitable & lovely of him.

Supriya - front counter staff, was always very welcoming, lovely and hospitable, always has a pleasant smile on her face. Recommended good food.

Will definitely recommend for a cozy & chill Friday night with positive vibes. Will definitely return.

Cheers!"
Great Place for a Friday Night,"Food is excellent, drinks very cheap and always service with a smile. We love the courtyard, it feels private and no cars noise."
"Great food, great staff",Pleasant environment. Nice outdoor seating. Fantastic food. Looking forward to our next visit. And the next....
Best Indian in Singapore,"I've been to Shish Mahal a number of times. The food has always been first class and vast selection of vegetable and meat dishes. Vijay the manager is an absolute star and one of the nicest people you'll meet, and the ambience of the restaurant is lovely tucked away in Albert court. The drinks are also very reasonably priced. This place is an absolute gem."
Excellent Food and quality service,It was a great time at the restaurant with my colleagues and friends. Food was excellent and service was great. Commendable service so would recommend and would go again if I get a chance.
THE BEST NAAN IN TOWN,One of the best naan in town. Very good curry dishes to go with the naans. Very good value set lunch too.
Excellent Food,"Must try this restaurant specially if you are from Asia, their Indian cuisine is awesome. Staff is very friendly moreover food is very tasty."
Excellence and a smile...,"My first visit to Singapore had me visiting this place two time because I was so impressed and pleased with the food, the service and the professionalism of the staff. Excellent from top to bottom and our business meetings went so very well. Visit them and treat yourself to all the good they offer... you will be glad you did..."
"Very good service, below average food.","The restaurant has a nice location and the service is good with attentive staff. Unfortunately the food didn't match the service. We ordered onion bhaji to start which was just an oily mess with little flavour. The rest of the dishes were very similar tasting with nothing special about them. The bread dishes, nans, were very good however."
Decent food and service. Noting special,"The restaurant has seating on the terrace and inside. The food was decent enough. The service was adequate but somewhat slow. The location, on Albert Court, is very pleasant."
Great northern Indian food,Found this place purely by accident last weekend as I waiting for a nearby shop to open. Excellent tandoori chicken as well as bhindi masala. Nice service and a warm welcome from Vijay who I assumed was the boss. Will be back again soon. Thank you.
Nothing to write home about,Went for dinner thinking it would be something special but it wasn’t. Food was just ok... we had tandoori chicken and mutton Mysore. Seemed like it had a lot of Color. Not going back.
Always great and everyone is super friendly,"Visited numerous times during 2018, bringing friends along too. Always impressed with the food and the super friendly staff. We'll be back soon!"
Good INDIAN food,"It was a great experience having the INDIAN food at the restaurant which is just next door to the venue we were staying in, the best part was the set lunch which had a good taste and a filling too and with polite and soft spoken staff around made more easier for us to understand the menu and option they served its recommended to people who stay in little India vicinity should try this restaurant next to Albert village court hotel"
Fine Ambiance,"Ambiance is good. They serve Nepalese as well as Indian food. Indian starters are good, lime soda is worth trying. However, main course and Nepalese cuisines were not as delightful (I had tried veg and chicken momos)."
Memorable Food,"We went there to try the Nepalese dishes and have returned again and again. One dish they serve, described as a Nepalese soup simmered with 8 different types of beans, is amazing. Everyone we brought there has ordered a second portion of this soup. Also love the momo - steamed dumplings with a spicy achar. I brought my dad too and he loves the fish Bryani. Enough said!"
Visit to a restaurant,Food was good !! It was my 1st time with my family!! The most important part which I like is virgin colada !! Superb !!! One of the best virgin colada in Singapore !! We will come back again !! Very good 👍🏻👍🏻
A Visit to Shish Mahal,Food is delicious. The Pina colada is outstanding and the service and staff is just wonderful. Would love to go back there for their Pina Colada.
Disgusting Staff,Staff is highly disgusting and do not care about what they are talking.....do not visit the place ...it's run by some Asian guys who think other Asian visiting are fools ...
Disappointing,"Badly maintained area with tables and chairs in disarray. Too much time taken to set the tables, take orders and finally serve. The food finally didn’t make the cut.

If you have ample time and the patience to bear with a bunch of grumpy waiters, best place to go to eat average Indian food. :("
Hidden Gem of Little India,"Located just 5 minutes walk away from Little India MRT Station (Take Exit A), this is a hidden gem and away from the hustle and bustle of the main Little India area. The food was fantastic and the service was exceptional. Try the Reshmi Kebab and the Garlic Naan and you will not be disappointed. Das (Senior Manager) was helpful and attended to us quickly. Will definitely be back in future to try other dishes. They are currently on eatigo --> enjoy while it lasts!"
Best Pina Colada,"Beautiful quiet place to have dinner and drinks. And, Das from the bar made the best Pina Colada in town. Absolutely fabulous! The fish tikka and paneer were also scrumptious!"
After Singapore Formula 1,"Went to this restaurant after the Singapore GP. Good welcome, english was ok and food as expected. Can recommend if you ever are nearby. Open after 23.30, at least this Sunday."
"Great food, Nice terrace and location","Probably one of the best indian restaurant in Singapore, the food is really good ,Sheek Kebab is perfect and not too spicy, their butter chicken is also great.
Rare thing in Singapore for an indian restaurant : they have a nice terrace, big and quiet.
Price is cheap compare to others restaurants with terrace. They also serve alcohol."
Unbelievably rude service,"This evening we returned to this delightful area in Albert Street. We had had drinks there in the outside area the night before and loved the atmosphere.
As it was really hot we wanted to go back to this lovely area, but somewhere with air conditioning. The menu for the Shish Mahal was good and when one of the waiters outside approached us and confirmed they had air con inside we were delighted. I wished we had stayed outside as the staff were polite and smiled. Inside we sat and waited, and waited, and waited. Finally I had to ask for a menu. It went from bad to worse. No welcome, no smile, rather a dismissive attitude. We did order and had ok food. At every stage we had to get the waiters attention and were treated rudely. Finally when we paid we got a complete blank. No thank you, or I hoped you enjoyed your meal. As we walked out we both said thank you and he turned his head away.
I am shocked with this level of rudeness as in Singapore we have only had marvellous service."
OK ok,Hi The restaurant is not that good. I ordered mix veg one day and they gave me some old stuff.. It was a bit smelly too.. Please try other restaurants if u hv option.
"Great Indian, had to go back for another visit. It was that good","Service outstanding, food also to die for and ver generous with the quantity when served. Very close to my hotel and has a great outdoor dining area to soak up the evening cooler air. Well worth the trip."
Great for a leisurely meal and a pint with your curry!,"My girlfriend and two friends went for the meal and arrived late after 11 and were promptly seated outside where I found the ambiance to be delightful - the setting is on a pedestrianised street and provides a quaint backdrop for a chilled out dining experience.

We started with poppadoms which were on the smaller side but very tasty all the same and came with a mint yogurt type dip which was of a perfect consistency. After being recommended the butter chicken I was not disappointed as it was rich, tasty and the meat was beautifully tender as to compliment such a dish. Whilst I can imagine a butter chicken of a higher caliber this one was far from disappointing. Accompanying this we all share the naan basket which for the price was sufficiently ample in allowing us to mop up each of our curries as it was a mixed basket containing 16 individual cut up segments of naan. I washed this down with free water which was regularly topped up upon request. I also tried some of my girlfriends paneer dish which was tasty and packed more of a punch spice wise than mine and is something I may consider next time.

The service was friendly with the waiter having banter whilst we ordered and the staff were not overbearing and allowed us to have a meal in peace and were not pushy for us to leave despite us staying in the restaurant up to 45 minutes after last orders. It's not the cheapest in the area but fairly priced and we thought the service charge was well worth paying. Would recommend to all"
Authentic Indian Food,Food here is totally value for money Taste just like Indian food Offers hotel guests a discount as well
Great Food,"Fed up with eating over sweetened and under spiced indian food back in the UK this place was a great surprise. Just across from our hotel we ate here rather than go back into town .
Every bite was full of heat and spices
Service was good
Well done Shish Mahal"
Best Indian in Singapore,I went back here again last week while on a family holiday in Singapore. I have eaten here many times since 2015 and never found better Indian food anywhere! The service was impeccable. They made my family feel very welcome and relaxed. The tables in the courtyard out the front are a great spot to eat within Albert Court. Top marks again for this restaurant!! A must try in Singapore!!!
"Good food, marred by disappointing service","Food was very good, I enjoyed a nice spicy vegetarian dish, setting was also pleasant. The experience was unfortunately marred by one particular waitress who could not have been more rude, sullen or unhelpful if she tried. Hopefully this can be sorted as it spolit what would otherwise have been an enjoyable meal."
Good Food Ruined by Feral Children,It's always difficult when you're reviewing a restaurant to know the factors to take into consideration. The Shish Mahal was located very conveniently close to our hotel so we opted to visit for an evening meal. It was only once we had begun to eat our starter that a group of what can only be described as feral children ran riot round the outdoor seating area and into the interior. Their parents were with them sitting at a table removed from the group of about 6 kids and not once did they move to take any action or account of the effect their offspring were having on their fellow diners. Perhaps more culpable were the management and staff of the restaurant who similarly tolerated what would have been intolerable anywhere else. The fact that the parents seemed to be known to the staff perhaps explains this but staff are responsible for the dining experiences of all their customers and here they completely failed. Having said all this the food was actually very good and surely most diners here will not experience the mayhem of our unfortunate night. The restaurant management needs to get the message however and need to know that we would have eaten here again had it not been for their negligence on this occasion.
Great food,"We visited this restaurant on valentines night, they had a lovely buffet with a wide range of dishes, very tasty. Staff were very attentive and friendly."
Best Indian / Nepalese,"We cannot recommended this place highly enough. The food was sublime and the service was amazing.

Visited 6 times over a 4 week period as it was so good. Never disappointed and can’t wait to go back when we return in March.

Told all our friends about this place.

Great restaurant."
Delicious Indian food,"Tucked away in a quiet courtyard you will find this excellent Indian restaurant. There are plenty of tables outdoors as well as indoors. We had excellent service from gracious staff. Popadoms and water are brought to your table soon after you sit down so that you can nibble while you read the extensive menu. We had starters of onion bahgies and pakoras( a huge plate!), followed by butter chicken and lamb rogan josh, rice and naan bread. All of the food was excellent. There is a full range of drinks-alcoholic and non-including the famous Singapore Sling, wine, beer, etc."
Buffet special dinner,We ate at the restaurant when they had a buffet special. Good choice of food and tasty. Servers were freindly and helpful.
I'm a singaporean who's mindblown,"It was a cold wet night. We didnt want to stray too far from our hotel. We chose this restaurant and ordered the tandoori prawn, butter chicken, aloo gobi. And proceeded to b3 mindblown. Ive eaten my fair share of north indian food in sg and this is one of the best, if not best, out here. Excellent service and vibes too."
Great place to eat,We had one delicious meal here. Thoughly enjoyed the experience and the wait staff were very attentive.
rain stops play,we were going to go to banana leaf apolo but the rain was coming down in casks so we went over the road from our hotel.the food was extremely good and we had quite a pleasent evening as the staff were quite friendly.
Not recommended,"The food was average, nothing great and service was definitely another turn off. We been to many places to dine and this was by far the worst. Will definitely not recommend Nor return ever.

It will be good if the restaurant management can send the Malaysian staffs for training."
Yummy Indian and Nepalese food,Good Indian and Nepalese food. Pricey but good value for money. Ambiance is okay and average service. Definitely worth a try !!!
My Favorite Indian Restaurant in Singapore,"So that is saying a lot-as there are tons of Indian places to eat especially in this area of town, on the fringe of Little India. I first discovered Shish Mahal when I stayed across the pedestrian street at the Village Albert Court Hotel in February and have since come back several times in May and most recently this month right before the Deepavali Holiday. They even had a special Diwali buffet menu in addition to the extensive sit down menu.

The seating is enormous out front with many tables covered from the sun...or rainy downpours. I’ve eaten outside in both and during the day and night and find it completely comfortable. They have large fans and chillers to make the outdoor tables comfy in the Singapore heat & humidity. There is a lovely inside section as well. I’ve always eaten outside. I have been there so many times now that some of the waiters recognize me as a regular-pretty amazing since I’m from the USA!

There are some pretty decent happy hour drink specials so be sure to ask. I took advantage of buy 2 Kingfishers and get a 3rd free. Their bartenders make some delicious cocktails too. I’ve had a better Singapore Sling here than the one at Raffles!

The menu is immense and diverse with lots of northern and southern (vegetarian) cuisine on offer. My favorites include the butter chicken with saffron rice and the garlic naan is some of the fluffiest and most flavorful I’ve ever had. I’m also fond of the paneer and onion bhaji. You really can’t go wrong with anything you order here. There are many locals spending an entire leisurely evening here for a meal. That is a wonderful sign for me. I haven’t gotten to the desserts yet as I stuff myself beforehand-they look very good from what I’ve seen others order.

My hearty thanks for many a wonderful meal here this year. I will be back in January 2018 for sure on my next visit to Singapore."
Good Food and Service,"We were staying at the Village Court Hotel, a few steps away. After having a long day sight seeing, we thought we'd stay close to the hotel. We are glad we did, a good choice. Really good food, very attentive staff and reasonably priced."
Delicious Indian food and well priced,"This Restaurant is a must if staying at the Albert Street Village Hotel, its in the court and only a minute or so from your room. The menus is extensive and caters for all tastes, the waiter was very helpful and attentive to our needs. The food was fabulous and plenty of it, the naan bread is some of the best I've tasted, the aloo gobbi masala and Rogan Josh were just right. The beer and wine was cheep and cold so if you want to experience some of the good Indian food of Singapore it's a great place to start, the breeze is refreshing in the Singaporean heat when dining elfresco at the Shish Mahal. After your meal you can have a stroll into the Indian sector down Serangoon Road just minutes away or go to the micro brewery next door or just hang about for more wine and beer at the Restaurant, we enjoyed our meal there and we are sure you will to, remember, take it for what it is, not what you want it to be and you will have a great experience."
Good Ambiance,"Good Indian food is always a challenge, but ambiance matters. good outdoor seating, nice appetizers. good selection of dishes."
Best Indian Food,"Taken to this restaurant with friends who always eat here. Excellent service great food. Seated outside, great atmosphere"
Too hot with no warning so check for chilli first,"I was so disappointed. Having happy memories of my time n Nepal I was so looking forwad to eating Nepalese food. I nearly ordered Dal, which later I wished I had. I dd however order vegetable Mo Mo's which I had a lot in Nepal. I only managed 3 of them before I had to give up - they were feiry hot and just burnt the mouth. There was no delicacy or flavour of the vegetables. Certainly not typical Nepalese food in my experience of it in Nepal. There should be a warning in my opinion if chilli is in a vegetable food because that is not what was ordered. However, a nice spot for a Beer and pleasant enough surroundings with the Albert Court ambience."
A Wide Selection of Dishes,"We went to this award winning restaurant to see if it was worth the hype. The restaurant offered a wide selection of North Indian and Nepalese dishes. The taste was alright. Some dishes such as the chili paneer was great and some such as the butter chicken were just ok. The serving for some of the dishes were extremely small. Given its standard and how affordable Indian food is in Singapore, I found this place rather expensive."
"Food is yummy, service is excellent","Go for the dal, go for the mix veg, go for the paneer dishes - i am sure you will relish it. Located very close to the Albert Court Village Hotel - Shish Mahal is richer by the wow service. not very heavy on the pocket - this restaurant is a true gem"
Mentioned in the latest Michelin Guide and well deserved,"I've been eating at this restaurant for a number of years when I've come to Singapore. The food has always been excellent and it was no surprise to hear that it has been mentioned in the Michelin Guide. It's a plain but comfortable restaurant and you can eat inside, or outside on the lovely pedestrianised mall. It is one minute's walk from the Albert Court Hotel where I usually stay. Besides the quality of the food the service is also very good and friendly."
Good,"Dood reastaurent in Village Albert court hotel having nice Indian food like Tandoori, Biriyani etc. Good"
Delicious Indian food. Great service.,"A local friend made us aware of this place. We had a very good time. Because we had ordered so much, our drinks went to the house. The Indian food was outstanding!"
hot stuff,excellent meal without having to cross the road into Little India.Little India was on our doorstep with great service
our visit to the Shish Mahal Restaurant,We went there around 5 PM wanting to eat a good Biriyani. Ordered chicken Biriyani expecting a Nawabi style 'Biriyani. The service was fast but the biriyani did not taste fresh. Somewhat dissatisfied with the taste & freshness. We sat outdoors which was nice .
"An excellent restaurant with Indian, Chinese and Asian food.","The restaurant is part of the Village Hotel, Albert Court complex. It has seating indoors and outside in a pleasant pedestrianised street setting. The overall impression on approach is of a welcoming establishment. I arrived early evening and I was hungry. I decided to have a mild curry butter chicken, naan bread and rice. A nice cool pint of heineken to accompany the meal was very welcome too. The food was excellent and I recommend this restaurant to you."
Good for north indian dishes,"Since we were staying in Parc soverign, we had dinner one night. The north indian dishes were good. I also like the point that they lay most of the tables outside and the environment is really nice
I recommend this hotel if u are staying nearby to parc sovereign and u are looking for north indian food. Did not see much of south indian varieties"
Superb Food At Great Value!,"Shish Mahal is truly one of the many Indian restaurants in Singapore that stand out for its quality of food offered. From the sizzling mixed grill to the succulent pieces of butter chicken, Shish Mahal is a must for Indian food lovers! I recently found out that they even won the Michelin Bip Gourmand Award! The owner, Mr. Gary is a warm personality that has turn his dedication and commitment to excellence. Kudos to the team at Shish Mahal!"
Nice food,I really enjoy the food . The food was very delicious and taste.All the waiters are very kind and good respected.
Great indian food,"A really nice place to have great food. Location is nice, one of the few places where there's cozy outdoor seating. Plenty of choices for food, great to order many dishes to share."
"Good food, Convenient location near Little India and very good value","I stayed in the Albert Court area of Singapore, very near to Little India. I didn't want to walk far on my own in the evening, and didn't want a big meal, so I wandered into this North Indian and Nepalese, open-air restaurant, part of the Albert Court outdoor eating area, minutes from my hotel. The staff were really helpful and friendly, happy to serve me just soup, samosa and nan bread. All were delicious but the 'chicken hot and sour soup' was perfect for my light supper. And I got to watch several clips of Indian 'Bollywood-style' dancing on the TV, which set the mood on a warm Singapore night."
"Relaxing atmosphere, different food","Food I ordered chicken (murgh) korma. What was great? The chicken korma. The vegetables (aloo gobi masala). Dessert Shahi Tukda. Must try. I have never seen this anywhere else. Drinks I had mango lassi. They seem to have outdoor seating. Ground floor toilets, convenient."
Right under my nose,We're staying opposite this restaurant at the Village hotel. We've been in Singapore for 2 nights and travelled to many different parts of the island. We're leaving tomorrow so thought we'd try the Indian across the road. It is excellent . Good choice of food well cooked and we'll presented. I wish I'd have found it earlier
Best Indian food just outside Little India,Surprising Good North Indian food served here. The closet to the real North Indian food that you get in DELHI
Final meal,Excellent food and service. Food was authentic Nepalese and North Indian and was a lovely experience in the restaurant with great service and professional staff
Great food,"Staff Ravi provides excellent service, good food, friendly service. Fish is fresh, beer very cold. Good location for transport and near hotel"
You must take the time to find this gem of an Indian restuarant,"I've been coming here for years and its still superb! There is nothing fancy about the al -fresco dining, yet the Indian / Nepalese food is outstanding and great value. Try the Samosa Chaat and Fish in Banana leaf!"
Excellent Paneer Kadai...!!,"Twice I visited this restaurant and had Paneer Kadai. The food was excellent, may be I can say a bit better than we get punjabi food in India too. Also the naan was pretty soft and stayed soft even after quite a few time had passed."
Superb nepalese / north indian experience,It was my first time eating this kind of cuisine but not indian and i must say it is very different but not less excellent. Nice service and great choice of foods. Love the chicken hakka noddle and steamed momo. Expect 10mn wait for the momos price are reasonable as well.
Good Indian food,"Had dinner twice here during our recent trip to Singapore. Good Indian taste - all the dishes we ordered were good. However, the best part was the extremely fast free wifi connectivity - more than 100 mbps- unbelievable!"
Great welcome great menu great food!,Had lunch here on our final day in Singapore. Das (the owner) very friendly as were all the staff. Food very tasty and large portions. Would highly recommend
Good alfresco arrangement with some good food,"I came to know about this place from Michelin Bib guide and went on a weekend dining spree with the beloved wife to test the taste of Bib Singapore. The place is very close to village hotel and does not give the impression like the other Indian restaurant @ Little India. We tried Chicken Hakka noodle ( ok), Fried Momo (good), one Nepalese mutton curry (ok). Overall average we spent SGD92 including drinks for 3 persons (including the kid) -if u are a momo lover better options are available just across the road @ Fifth season - but overall a good experience."
The Best Affordable Indian Restaurant around Little India,"I came to know this restaurant as i always drink at a bar next to it. One of my friends recommended it to me so i said, i'd try it. That was a year ago. Now, everytime i have friends from the other parts of the world whose got an appetite for an Indian Cuisine, i'd always bring them here. I'd probably brought a lot of my friends here.

First, the food is amazing. I so love the Butter Chicken and the Regular Naan combo.
Second, all the staff are so friendly. They already knew me by face as i always go there at least once a month and sometimes three times a month to grab dinner.
Third, the location is awesome. You can either order beers from them or drink at the bars next to it.
Four, the price is so affordable for a restaurant in a very good location.

So if you that thirst for Indian Food, i would highly advise to try this restaurant and i am very much sure that you will come back again and again."
Great Indian in Little India,"Food is great and for Singapore, quite reasonably priced. We had 2 pints if beer, a shared starter, 2 mains with rice & naan for $75 including tax & service. The Chilli pakoras were great & pack a punch! Some of the outside tables are smoking so make sure you ask first, mid way through our dinner we had to move tables to avoid being gassed by a family who lit up right next to us while we were eating!"
Horrible food and prices,"We had dinner at this place and it was fully booked. Considering the review and crowd we took a table but I don't think it's worth either.
We ordered a paneer chat Pata masala.
It was dripping oil and paneer chewy like gum.
Roomali roti looked like chapati.
Dal was average. Everything lacked salt and taste.
Do not recommend this restaurant at all!"
Horrible food standards!,"We ordered steamed Momo's from this ""authentic"" Nepalese restaurant, i cannot fully describe how horrible it was! Out of the 6 pieces, one was already broken when it was served to us. I fail to understand how steamed momos were dripping of oil
The momos were modak's stuffed with garam masala and some pungent boiled vegetables. HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT!
The main course was more disappointing with chatpata paneer being super shaddy mixture of oil along with some pieces of chewy paneer. Only good thing was papad and mint Chutney that we got free with some beer that we ordered in the start of the meal :|
75$ gone down the drain!"
Good Food,"Had a wonderful lunch here. Portioning, Taste, Ambience, Service was good. Will definitely visit here again very soon"
Delicious Indian food near but still away from little India,People who want a variety of Indian food should have at least 2 meals here.One can get 10% flat discount on bill if he has stayed in Albert Court.I strongly recommend the Thali (Deluxe) to taste!
Nice experience!,"I've been living in Singapore for long but never been here. The restaurant is not that spacious but consists two sections with about 30 plus seats for dining! We started with some starters like Paneer pakora, Veg Mo Mo & some spring rolls. All were excellent with authentic taste. Our main course were Naan Basket with varities if Naans. Tasty Tandoori chicken & Mysore mutton went well with Naan. We finished with hot cup of Masala Chai where kids had Gulab Jamun! Altogether it was sumptuous tasty and worth money spent! Will go again!"
"Lovely food, freshly prepared, bit pricy.","I was staying in the Albert Court Village Hotel and didn't fancy trekking far so opted for the Shish Mahal. I think I was initially the only diner, so a bit of a gamble. Helpful waiter. Went for Prawn Malaba - delicious, not too spicy. Later on noticed a couple of Indian guys were eating there. I thought the prices were a bit high but maybe that was in comparison to the million eateries I found the next day."
Excellent Indian food,Visited here after a yoga class. Service was prompt. Chicken kebabs with saffron were tender and beautifully spiced. Biryani was also of a very high quality. Would return
good tasty food,"we stayed at the albert court hotel, hence this restaurant was most convenient. the food was very good the first time we tried and there after we had our food almost daily at this place. staff is good too."
enjoyable meal,"Within the hotel complex, with Northern Indian and Nepalese food. Helpful staff, tasty meals and reasonable price."
So many better options,"A bit expensive, food very average, basic service. I will certainly not return, as this area has much more to offer"
Great Nepaleese and Indian Food in picturesque setting,"Wonderful Tandoori Chicken, generous meat and vegetarian set menus, unforgettable Dal and grilled paneer on skewers not forgetting the Goan fish curry. Welcoming popidoms and dips offered by a great team. I also enjoy savouring the delicious Nepalese dishes."
Best food,Best halal food restaurant in little india . Food quality is really good and spicy level is as per your requirement . Service is really good and yellow dal with achar is a combination not to miss.
not worth,just opposite to Hotel Parc Soverign and Albert street. food quality and taste not upto the mark. there are plenty of other options
good indian food,the restaurant has variety offering. the chicken and daal are very good. if you want you can ask for pickle and small salad. otherwise you can order from their salad offering. the service is good. they serve halal food.
Delicious food and friendly staff!,"We ate here during our stay at the Albert Court hotel. We sat inside as it was a bit cooler than outside (even at 9pm at night!) and also because smoking was allowed outside.
The food was lovely with good spice, and staff were friendly. For 2 of us the bill came to S$90 (a bit more than we would normally spend but does include alcohol) and would eat here again."
Romantic dinner,"My husband and I had a very pleasant dinner in this restaurant during our stay in Singapore. The food is delicious, dishes are big, prices are reasonable.
It was a St. Valentine's day and they gave a rose to my husband to give it to me, it was really sweet."
Great restaurant and attentive staff.,Great restaurant we enjoyed our food good service extensive menu. Fast service and very comfortable seating outside.
Unprofessional staff,"Food was average.
Looks good from outside.
True Indian restaurant but gives more importance to foreigners.
Staff were not behaving professional.
Found hair in lemon juice and seafood starter. Returned the food back and waited for almost am hour for the fresh one... Finally we had to cancel the order and leave!!"
Evening meal,"We had the opportunity of a few days in Singapore and a chance to try one or two places to eat as you do well if you like curry this one is not to be missed the service good food excellent and atmosphere good we sat out side it was a lovely evening watching people go by we will certainly be going back the next time we are in Singapore

Taste of India,"The service here was excellent as was the food. We asked for chef recommendations to serve seven people with various breads. All of us loved the food and enjoyed the various dishes. It was slightly more expensive than the street style food we had the previous night (which was also good and very cheap). But, the quality of the food well and truly matched the cost."
Good meal in alfresco area,"Can't remember what I ordered now, it was a few months back, but we thought the food was average to good. Didn't blow us away but was not disappointing at all. The al fresco area is nice. Away from the street, but gets good walk through traffic for people watching. Sitting out there at night was quite a pleasant experience. Busy enough for a good atmosphere. Service was decent."
tasteful food!,"if you love to explore indian food, this is the place to go! reasonable price and worth it! nice food indeed!"
Great option,Vijay was really helpful in selecting meals for our group of seven. Meals are not too spicy for westerners. Very tasty and ok on price. A great option for those staying at village hotel Albert court.
Pathetic staff and service,"Worst staff and service after visiting so many restaurant in Singapore. Staff was rude and took almost 1 hr in getting our order when only 4-6 guest were there in restaurant.
We were waiting for our next set of bread and then suddenly one staff member came and said if u r finish can I clean the table.. They should be aware of these little things.. Talked to another male staff about delay in service and he said in Singapore u will get this type of service only. how can they damage Singapore image with their fault. This kind of behavior happened on two days.. Some staff was from Albert cafe inside Albert hotel and they were very good in behavior but rest of the staff was shame on Albert court hotel's shish mahal restaurant.."
Great choice for Indian food,"Ate here last night; wonderful menu, and the food was incredibly tasty. We had the momo, vegetable shashlik, mutton dopiaza and naans. It was all fabulous and full of flavour. Could not fault the food one bit. My only complaint would be the manner in which the staff grouped and hovered nearby during off-peak hours. It was if they were surveying their kingdom. I understand it is important to be attentive but it was a little oppressive to have them pretty much stand guard over us for the duration. That said, I would definitely eat here again"
"Food average, service poor","We're not expecting anyone to fawn over us, far from it. But the person taking our order didn't even look at us: it was like we didn't even exist. When the food did come, he just thumped it down and went off. The food itself was just about okay - the tomatoes in the bhindi were smelling strange, and for the price we paid, the food was certainly not tasty."
