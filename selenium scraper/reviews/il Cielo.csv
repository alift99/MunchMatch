Great dinner!,Great ambiance and the food was delicious! Thank you Jas who provided such impeccable service! - will definitely be back :)
Great service and food!,"Warmly greeted by Caiying at entrance before showing us to our seats, was addressed by name which is really thoughtful! Food portions are generous and tasted great! This is the first time I returned after their renovation. Congratulations to Janson and his team for delivering a welcoming dining experience, keep up the good work"
Awesome service and delicious food!,Visited during lunch with a girlfriend and was welcomed by manager Janson. We were offered a complimentary glass of moscato and asked for recommendations from the ala carte menu. The Fritos Misto was a winner and the pastas were hearty and delicious. Service by Janson was impeccable and the ambience was great. I will definite return again.
Great Rooftop Location,"My wife and I had an early dinner to celebrate my birthday. The rooftop is breezy and affords great views. It has a great alfresco ambience. The restaurant was relatively quiet, perhaps as we ate at dusk around 6:45pm. Staff were highly professional, friendly and prompt. The food was very good. We shared a tomato mozzarella starter and I had duck pasta as my main course. We each had a glass of Pinot Grigio."
Great spot for dinner,Ambience and food was pretty yum. A nice place to unwind for the day and to dine under the night sky. Had the tiramisu for dessert which was 10/10 ‚ú®
Good food and great staff,"We enjoyed the food they served, specially the duck salad which I truly enjoyed! All their staff were friendly and polite; I specially would like to commend Suresh for running after our group outside Voco hotel to return the wallet I forgot at the restaurant, I did not even notice that I left my wallet :) He did not have to look for us but he went down and looked for us. Super thank you, Suresh!"
Impeccable service,Went for dinner with colleagues and was amazed with the level of service from the team especially the Manager Janson and Jas. Detailed and service oriented with high levels of customer focus. Janson noticed that I didn‚Äôt eat the Parma ham appetiser which I didn‚Äôt request to change but he offered to change the dish without hesitation. Really appreciate it. Keep up the excellent service. Thank you
Excellent Dining Experience,"The food is awesome, especially the pork rib, and salmon is very fresh. Dessert is freshly prepare, shout out to burnt cheesecake with generous spread of pistachio. Thank you kitchen team and ms. Cai Ying from front housing serving, great hospitality ever, superb dining experience. Will visit again when I come to Singapore next time."
Nice cosy restaurant,Went here for our wedding anniversary. Friendly service and food was delicious. I would consider the food value for money as well considering the location and ambience.
First Time Experience,"First time at IL Cielo made perfect with warm, friendly, and attentive service by this gentleman - Jas. The food and wine he suggested paired perfectly, definitely recommend first timers to this restaurant to be served by Jas.

Kudos to the chef as well for the delicious food."
Birthday celebration,"You have no idea! The taste of the foods and the way they were served were awesome! All my friends love the foods and we are surely coming back in the future! Especially thanks to Maco, John and Ah Beh for the effort putting into preparing the foods! Highly recommended!!"
Worth the visit.,Food is excellent with the portions just nice. Staff are attentive and prompt with service. The location is a bit unusual as it is next to the swimming pool but the decor is very pleasant.
Best Italian restaurant in orchard,"Visited with my friend for lunch. We love the place overall.
the restaurant located next to the pool, have big window and bright. I like the atmosphere.
We had fritto, duck pasta and fish. I really love duck pasta! The duck meat was soft and juicy, it was just perfect.
Staff are very welcoming and warm. We will come back definitely again!"
Lovely Ambience,"Lovely gem. Food is nice, tiramisu is the best in town. None to mention all wine recommended by sommelier Janson. He has good knowledge about wine. Thank you, Janson"
Best service!,Janson is very professional sommelier and he will definitely assist you in selecting a perfect wine!
Fun gathering,Great service and great wine recommendation by the sommelier. Good good and nice atmosphere. Wonderful time !
Nice sommelier,"Food is really nice and the wine sommelier Jansom recommended is perfect fit with foods, the staff here are nice and friendly"
Corporate Networking Event - Excellent Team!,"Held a corporate networking event at the poolside, with canapes and drinks from the restaurant.

The team at voco / il Cielo was nothing short of amazing - they worked with our team hand in hand to ensure that the event would be a success, and that the service of canapes and drinks went off without a hitch. From pre-event administration and discussions, to onsite execution and post-event teardown, the team worked tirelessly to ensure everything was smooth.

The canapes served were delicious! Kudos to Chef Marco and his team for creatively plating the canapes and working with our team during the tasting to ensure that the guest experience would be great.

A big thank you again to Anne and Janson! Excited for future opportunities at voco / il Cielo again with your wonderful team. :)"
Excellent Rooftop Facility @ Voco,"The poolside rooftop was used for a corporate networking reception where influencers, celebrities, and well-established individuals were present. The canap√©s and alcoholic beverages that were served were delicious and mouth-watering. The rooftop was clean and well-maintained with a stunning view of Orchard making it a venue worth visiting.

The staff at Voco was very helpful, and reliable. They were also able to provide excellent customer service by satisfying the needs of the guests and stakeholders for the event. I am deeply proud of the professionalism and service that was provided by the staff at Voco."
"Amazing food, Excellent Service! üëçüèªüëçüèªüíØüíØ","iL Cielo is first thing that comes to mind when we crave for Italian food.

Anniversary Celebration,Food at Il Cielo was nicely curated. Jansen and the lady event manager went the extra mile and flexible to cater to our requests and last minute changes to make this celebration memorable. thank you.
Group Cocktail and Dinner Event,"I have organised a corporate event at il Cielo in late August this year. We had cocktail session by the pool followed by a dinner session at the main hall. Jenson was the in-charge for my event and he is very adaptive with my last minute adhoc requests. Table placard is nicely placed on each seating, food serving is fast and everything is well organised.

Thank you, Jenson & the team once again for the lovely night!"

Friendly and hospitable services with good food,"A special shout out to Jansen who really go above and beyond to understand my palate. I‚Äôm glad that he did so and he let the chef to remove the salt from my pasta. Ended up I loved the pasta very much, as I can taste the umami of the seafood.
I also ordered a pizza, which is simple and unpretentious.
Remember to look out for Jansen if you visit il ceilo."
Wonderful lunch and great service!,"First time dining at il Cielo for a business lunch. Picked the restaurant for its good reviews, ambience and the variety of dishes to cater to different dietary requirements including vegetarian/vegan.

Food was good and guests were happy! Overall a great dining experience, and we'll be back."
Lovely meal and view. Great service and ambiance.,"It was my first time dining at il Cielo at VOCO Hotel and my friends and I had a wonderful dinner experience. We ordered the Fritto Misto, Burrata e Tartufo Pizza and the Costine di Maiale (Iberico roast pork ribs) which were very scrummy. The sommelier, Janson, who highly recommended Librandi Efeso white wine paired wonderfully with each dish! We ended off the meal with the Tiramisu and Basque Cheesecake which is also very delicious. A big thanks to Suresh and Janson for the amazing service. We look forward to returning to the restaurant very soon."

SUPER YUMMY ARABBIATE AND GREAT SERVICE,CANNOT stop raving about the arrabiata its SOOOOOOOOO DAMN GOOOOOOOOD REALLY each and every piece was sOOOO al-dente and they were SOOOOO generous with their housemade meatballs I USED TO HATE TOMATO BASED PASTA but this arrabiata CHANGED MY MIND. I'M A CONVERT. the Burrata e Tartufo OH MY GOD sOOOOO creamy burrata that compliments the dough SO SO WELL. I grunt in delight every single time I put a piece of pasta/pizza in my mouth and the next table were judging but ITS OK I LOVE U IL CIELO!!!!!! your service was so great too shoutouts to CAIYING!!! I WILL BE BACK I WANT TO TRY EVERYTHING ON THE MENU!!
BAD EXPERIENCE,Pasta was substandard. Service was the absolute worst. Only 2 servers working the full house. Disgraceful.
Great service and ambience!,Have booked Il cielo for my husband birthday dinner and both of us had a very good time. Ryan and his team were very attentive and the service was impeccable! Thank you for the surprise birthday dessert! My husband was pleasantly surprised! I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll visit again!
Anniversary dinner,"Great food, great and friendly staff - Ryan and his colleagues! Nice ambience. Food is nice and reasonably priced!"
"Had a great time. Great service, food and view.","It's my second time at Il Cielo and the menu has changed a bit but I still love the food and service. There's a limited number of tables so you can easily get their attention. The bread basket had been downsized to 3 pieces of bread, which was perhaps for the best, because they are so delicious.

For the appetizer, we ordered the seafood basket. It was meant for 2 but there was only one king prawn. We cut up the octopus and soft shell crab ourselves. This was a bit of a puzzle since previously, everything was nicely diced up in 2s.

For mains, we ordered the burata pizza, which burst with flavour, and also the steak and eggs. They helped us cut up the steak when we told them we were sharing everything. We also ordered the truffle fries which were HUGE and well-fried, but it could do with a stronger truffle flavour.

We had the hazelnut panna cotta, which was a delight and gorgeous in presentation."
Attentive Service and Food!,"I had a wonderful Birthday lunch with my wife here. Totally enjoyed our time spent at the restaurant. We took the Business Lunch Set, it was good value, and the food was great. On top of that, they provided very good service too. Was not too intrusive, just about right to make both of us feel comfortable and relax, throughout our 90mins stay in the restaurant."
Great ambiance and service,"Brought my family to Il Cielo to celebrate my Mom's birthday and it was my first time there too. The food was kind of pricey but overall I have no complaints. Staff was friendly, food was delicious and my family enjoyed the dinner:)"
Pleasant Dinner,"The fritto misto was very well executed, and the garlic aioli with lime leaf was a splendid touch. Also had the white aspargus risotto, which was my favourite dish, but a touch over-seasoned. The manzu pasta dish was underwhelming compared to the other 2 dishes, but the tagliatelle was cooked perfectly al-dente for me, which is really difficult to do in restaurants. Most restaurants I've visited butcher the pasta, but I think the ones here are top class. Didn't have the wines I wanted, but it was alright, all in all a pleasant experience. Will be back again. Sorry no pictures were taken coz... we were just hungry."
Mr James Young Fine Dining,"I had a fantastic dining experience all round
The ambience was just right and the food was of outstanding quality !!!

The staff complimented the evening with their attention to detail and service and friendly nature !!

The table setting was befitting a 5 star experience but in particular the food was superb and i have been in many top eating establishments around the world.

I will be returning in June to Singapore and will partake again

It‚Äôs a very impressive dining experience indeed

kind regards

James Young"
Respite in the city,"My first time dining at Il Cielo - a lovely respite in Orchard Road.

The restaurant has a nice view of the swimming pool and Orchard skyline. The service crew are very welcoming and attentive. My friend and i shared a 3 Course Set Lunch and two pasta. Highly recommending Al Nero - black ink risotto with octopus, am salivating whenever i think about this risotto!"
Poor Service but nice pool view,"The place is great but service was really terrible from the moment we entered.
At the entrance we have asked to enter and have a bottle of wine and some ‚Äòbar bites‚Äô as we already had dinner. To which the guy at the door (looks like the manager) answered crudely with ‚Äúthis is not a bar, it‚Äôs an Italian restaurant‚Äù. Obviously we did know that it was a Italian restaurant! He could have answered that yes, they did serve fries and some light bites.

We entered the restaurant anyway as we wanted an experience by the poolside, which was completely empty when we came. The door guy was reluctant to let us have the seats by telling us that it is very hot out there and it is not weather proof (though there wasn‚Äôt even any risk of rain). We insisted and realised it was quite cooling throughout the night. After we sat outside, a couple moved from the table inside to sit outside as well.

During the dinner, we asked the guy for some serviettes as we wanted to wipe the table which was oily and he presented us with a stingy few pieces.

Dishwashing area noise was really loud and you could hear dishes clanging.

The saving grace was the poolside view and cooling atmosphere and the nice waitress Karen.

Will come back again as the food looks good."
Nice experience,"Had dinner last week. Love the ambience, had a warm welcome from the service team. great food! Portion is reasonable too. Highly recommend the frito Misto. Hope to be back again."
Dinner at IL cielo,Had dinner at IL cielo on a evening. Food was awesome espically we had the manzo & tartufo and we finished off with chef Marco special which is Nutella pizza. Great service and great food. Great team thank you guys keep it up.
Delicious!,We visited for an early dinner on our last day visiting our daughter in Singapore. The food was really delicious with a good selection to choose from. Really pretty setting and lovely staff too!
Authentic Italian Restaurant,We ordered pasta and pizza. Pasta is beyond our expectations. I would say a perfect authentic italian pasta. Pizza has a generous cheese and the crust is crispy. Surely we‚Äôre going back again. It is a lovely evening
Excellent Italian Rooftop Restaurant,Excellent experience. Foods were superb! Staff are friendly and attentive. Ambiance and place was very relaxing. üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
Great value for money,"My husband and I came for the 3-course set lunch on the 2nd day of their soft launch. Good portions, good taste and great service! Highly recommend the chestnut soup and exquisite panna cotta. Many thanks to Didacus, Ryan, Cai Ying and Chef Marco for making us feel at home! Look forward to returning to il Cielo for dinner again."
A True Michelin Star Experience!,This was an amazing experience! My brother and I spent Christmas in Singapore and had Christmas dinner at this restaurant and it was exceptional. The ambiance was nice as we dined at the roof top with a view to LIVE for. Every course was as delicious to the eyes as it was to the palate. We would definitely recommend and visit again.
Very good value in lovely surroundings,"We had lunch at Il Cielo, sitting by the windows with a view of the pool. The pool view makes the inside of the restaurant bright and cheerful. We ordered duck breast, foie gras, and duck leg confit croquettes with a mash of hazelnut and other flavors. We shared both mango sherbet and double chocolate Gelato. They were all very good. They gave us a free plate of small mango squares with raspberry sauce and slices of black forest cake. Service was helpful and very polite."
Vegan customisation available!,"So blessed to have the staffs who helped customised tomato based vegan pasta, impossible meat ""steak"", and zesty fruit salad with lemon sorbet. Also welcomed with vegan gluten free bread basket as a starter! So many options, that I believe it is out of their menu. Felt so pleased with their service as they were very accommodative to our vegan requests! However, owner of hotel is gonna change in Jan 2022, so not sure if restaurant will still be the same. Good ambience by the hotel pool too!"
Boring food,"We went to Il Cielo with high expectations given all the positive reviews but were very much underwhelmed. The amuse bouche and starter were pretty good but the radish, lemon peel soup that followed simply tasted of lemon and nothing else. We requested some salt to suppress the strong citrus taste and got barely a few flakes from a crusher. The subsequent pasta dish was just OK, and once again, when we requested some salt to enhance the flavor, it came after 5 minutes when the pasta had gone cold. The glazed apple mousse dessert was too heavy. Overall nothing special and definitely not worth the price."
Dining + Birthday celebration,"Special thanks to Beh Li for the arrangement.
And also thanks to Chef Sasaki, Chef Jon, Didacus, Cai Ying, Karen, Sarah and Melanie.
We enjoyed the night with good foods, good services and very nice environment.
Sure will go back again."
Birthday Dinner,"We enjoyed our Italian-Japanese dining with rooftop city views and specially customised menus for the birthday celebration. Kudos to Chef Sasaki, Chef Jon, Beh Li and Melanie for the mouthwatering dishes and desserts with great presentations (take a look at our food pics)!

Italian buffalo mozzarella cheese salad and chestnut soup
Handmade spaghetti with sea urchin
Deep fried charcoal powder Hokkaido scallop with truffle mayonnaise and soft shell crab
Sea bass fish clam soup with Italy tomato and olive
Italia style aglio olio with ramen pasta
Yuzu balloon ricotta cheese with lime sorbet
Nicely decorated Birthday platter

Besides, service was fantastic. Didacus, Cai Ying, Karen and Sarah were so nice, friendly and attentive. They made sure everything is well taken care of. Pleasant and enjoyable dining experience.

We will come back again! :)"
Perfect fusion of Italian & Japanese flavors,"Il Cielo has never disappointed us. Going there as a couple means we could have different tasting menus and share each other‚Äôs dishes. The Italian menu consists of a burrata cheese starter, a chicken mousse salad, lobster capellini and the delectable duck with foie gras finished off with strawberry & chocolate yoghurt. The Japanese menu starts with snapper carpaccio, a seafood consomm√©, sea urchin spaghetti and the main dish of succulent Wagyu short rib and finished with a large Yuzu ball of ricotta & sorbet. Both menus come with wine pairing (4 glasses each). Total cost: S$490."
Fantastic Dinner,"Unforgettable dinner.
We had dinner degustation menu. The Kinmedai Carpaccio was amazing.
The carpaccio pair with the wine dressing and finish by grape fruit snow. Cooling
Pasta was memorable.
Deep fried scallop with truffle mayonnaise. Was really yummy
Homemade pasta with some fresh sea urchin on top. Good presentation and delicious.
La Sfere was so citrusy. We love it.
Lemon sorbet with some mascarpone cheese covered by the huge yuzu ball.

Michelin standard.

Besides, service was fantastic. All the staffs were so nice, friendly and helpful. They‚Äôre so knowledgeable about their food. And they do recommendation for us. Professional service and nice ambiance. Rooftop restaurant and swimming pool view. Outstanding!!!

We felt tearful Chef Sasaki will leave by end of year of 2021 as he shared with us his future plan. Definitely we‚Äôre happy for him.

We will come back soon !"
Value for Set lunch,"A great value at a rated Italian Japanese restaurant. 3 course lunch menu at $38++. My wife n I had the Mozzarella salad with prosciutto for starters. She chose the Spaghetti Primo with bacon whilst I had their special Linguine Aglio for an additional $20. Both of us had their Brownie and ice cream for desserts. Green tea at the end. Great meal, taste good and excellent service. Always attentive and making sure one feels comfortable and ensuring ones drinks is always filled. Il Cielo is situated at the 24floor of Hilton Hotel at Orchard Rd. Not a large restaurant but cosy enough for special occasions and even romantic in the evenings."
Lovely lunch with my friend,Me and my friend enjoyed a lovely lunch together in il cielo. We were welcomed by the warm smiles & friendly staff of the waiter & waitresses. The food was excellent and well seasoned. The pasta was one of the best I‚Äôve tried so far in any Italian restaurant. We also love the top view & skyscraper outside the pool area near the restaurant. We will be back for more! :)
Average at best,"We had high expectations coming in to try both Italian and Japanese tasting menus with wine pairing.
In overall assessment, the service was very good, ambiance and food was average and value was disappointing.
We ended up having the Autumn Tasting menu and the Italian degustation menu

Wins:
- The booking experience, reservation confirmation and informing us ahead what food is unavailable was very professional. All the ladies that were attending to us last night were very courteous, friendly, attentive and did their best.
- Presentation of all the dishes was great
- A few of the dishes were outstanding in quality and taste: Special Aglio Olio Peperoncino, Capellini with Lobster and Porcini and the Tramonto dessert.

Opportunities:
Food
Out of the three Amouse bouche we got, only the crab meat cone was good. The macaroon was soft on the outside, but hard and ice cold on the inside. The ‚ÄòBurrata‚Äô piece had no taste at all. On top of that, it was the exactly same thing as my first course. That was weird. Burrata is creamy, oozy and has a lot of flavor. This tasted like a mozzarella ball you buy in Cold Storage.
Shabu Shabu lacked flavor in the consomm√©. Just bland.
Cold Carbonara - not sure what the effort is here, it wasn‚Äôt bad, but would have tasted way better if it was at least not ice cold.
Chicken mousse uneventful. Pork belly was 80% fat and 20% meat. Only memorable thing in the duck dish was the raspberry sauce.
Saved the worst for last - Tartufo e Mochi - completely inedible and just underlined the fact that the chef wants to have truffles in almost everything.

Beverages
The wine pairing was a complete joke. A cheap prosecco served in an Ikea-like flute, poor choice of white and red and some sweet wine served again in the same Ikea flute.

All in all, expectations were far from met. First impression walking in the restaurant properly dressed up, only to be looking at screaming kids in the pool and one of your guests with a hoodie and a hat (what happened to smart casual dress code?). There was absolutely zero wow factor in this experience. If you‚Äôre going to charge a 500 dollar dinner for two and call yourself a Michelin star fine dining establishment, you really need to step up your game.

I really apologize for this review, I predominantly leave positive ones, but this was really disappointing and we felt the value for the experience we hoped for wasn't there at all."
Lovely degustation Italian-Jap fusion,"There were three set menus to choose from: autumn set, Italian degustation and Japanese degustation. We tried the Italian one as we didn‚Äôt like sea urchin in the Jap one.

All dishes were beautifully presented with a Japanese influence. Take a look at our food pics. A wonderful collection of tastes was encountered in several dishes. Service was very attentive.

Nice and quiet. Faces an unused pool on the top floor, which isn‚Äôt that high today (24th floor, which looks like a dwarf when you have buildings towering almost double this hotel‚Äôs height, right in front of the pool view)."
Will be back again,"The food is very well prepared. The presentation, color, balance is very good. I love the wagyu beef tartar, which is very rich in taste, and duck leg confit, with the corn puree, very smooth with rich corn flavor, and also the chocolate dome. And all the staffs are very friendly and provide very good service. Will be back again."
Lovely Italian restaurant with great service!,"Il Cielo offers amazing wines, food and service. Staff are extremely knowledgeable and make great recommendations. Highly recommend the Capellini Pasta & Charcoal Crust Scallops - must try! The restaurant is by the pool side and the ambiance is very charming, perfect for a date night. Thank you Sarah, Caiying, Jasmine, Didacus and the Chefs for the lovely experience! The service we received was amazing and we will definitely be back again!"
Great food and service,"il Cielo is an excellent restaurant with sumptuous, good quality food served with creativity and great service and friendly staff."
Great Dinner Night,"Staying over for the night, and Opus was full. Family was open to Italian, so it was a good thing il Cielo had space for us.
Turns out to be an even better alternative.
My mother enjoyed her Japanese degustation, and Dad indulged in Summer Tasting.
I was soaking in the ambience, where natural comes into an air-conditioned dining area, I call that the best of both worlds.
Many thanks to Caiying, Sarah, Didacus, Jasmin and not forgetting chef Sasaki for this experience."
Anniversary Dinner,"Love the tenderness of the wagyu. Indeed a chef‚Äôs signature for the spaghetti. Our favorite was the scallop -super nice sauce. My partner and I got our most wonderful anniversary treat top with champagne! And most important of all was the relaxing ambiance we are looking for and the hospitality and the attention to details from the staff - Didaurs, Jasmine, Chi Ying, Sarah, and the superb food from the chef Sasaki"
Delicious,"We came for the weekday 4 course set lunch. Highly recommend the foie gras and the sea urchin pasta. Both are worth the supplement cost in my opinion. Grilled angus beef and panna cotta was very good as well. Thanks to the crew Didacus, Jasmine, Cai ying, Sarah for their excellent service and Chef Sasaki for the amazing food."
55 Birthday Dinner Celebration,"We had a Fantastic Birthday dinner with my Family. Staffs are very friendly and made our dinner enjoyable. Best Risotto with Braised Beef we ever had. Thank you to Chef Sasaki san and Didacus, Jasmine, Caiying and Sarah."
Lovely evening with attentive staff,"My partner and I had the 5-course Summer Tasting menu by Chef Sasaki. The staff, namely Didacus, Cai Ying, Jasmine and Sarah were attentive throughout the night.
Food was excellent and we liked that each dish was explained in detail.

I must really compliment the service here. I mentioned offhand that it was my delayed birthday celebration due to the earlier P2HA restrictions, and they thoughtfully arranged to serve a dessert plate. The restaurant overlooks a pool; the view is high enough such that it feels tucked away from the city; but still strategically located towards Marina Bay (we could catch a glimpse of the National Day fireworks from afar).

Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and we highly recommend this lovely place."
Dinner,"Celebrated an anniversary dinner here. We were served by Didacus, Cai Ying, Jasmine and Sarah. Kitchen was led by Chef Sasaki.

Very lovely, cosy restaurant with a beautiful poolside view. Caught a glimpse of the fireworks from the national day celebration. Service from the team was also impeccable - all of them were attentive and very accommodating.

The food itself was excellent, especially the unagi capellini. The charcoal crusted scallops were also delicious and worth coming back for.

Will be back again sometime soon!"
Great lunch,"I wish there was some light music playing in the background in the restaurant but due to new government rules, I think background music is forbidden. The food is good but without music, the restaurant loses its vibe as it just feels like a high class canteen serving food. I hope fine dining restaurants can play music soon!"
very disappointed,"my 2nd visit: extremely disappointed with the quality of the cuisine.

Ordered a spaghetti bolognaise; a restaurant of this standing should not NOT be able whip up a good one. In its stead I received a cookie-cutter average tasting bolognaise - there were no hallmarks of the fine standard I had experienced at Il Cielo during my 1st visit (which was postpandemic so no excuses from their management thank you...)

my friend ordered a Swordfish for a main; it was fishy and it arrived H A R D ie overcooked - I haven't tasted swordfish before but hadn't expected a slab so tough.

It was a very disappointing experience; culinary standards have slipped and slipped during the Phase II Heightened Alert - Please go do something about it and no excuses about not finding the right kitchen staff or training them properly bla bla bla."
Il Cielo: Best restaurant with a view in Singapore!,"Amazing restaurant with one of the most beautiful views in Singapore. One you must visit for lunch or diner when you are in the city!
Chef Sasaki, who spend several year in Italy, combines the Italian dishes with a flavour of Japan.
Michelin star worthy in my opinion.
Sarah and her staf have been wonderful in giving a home away from home feeling.
Thanks to her and her team: Didacus, Jasmine and Cai Ying."
Excellent services and wonderful food!,"You can tell great effort and lotsa details put on the each dish by chef Sasaki! Also had a pleasant anniversary night thanks to the great services from the crew (Didacus, Cai Ying,Peggy and Sarah!)"
Wonderful service with delicious food,The food was delicious and the service was excellent. Thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience. Restaurant has a bird's eye view of orchard.
Amazing!!,"Service was fantastic, ambience was quiet and food was absolutely amazing! Had a great time here celebrating my birthday thanks to the wonderful team, Didacus, Cai Ying, Jasmine, Sarah & lastly, Chef Sasaki! Thank you for the wonderful night :)"
Personal Experience,Third visit there. The service was good and the staff very friendly. Pasta portion maybe can reduce slightly. Colour presentation can be enhanced. Dessert presentation look messy this time round.
Great start on the reopening of dining in,"Great Dining experience here on the first day of operation after dining in is allowed!

Ordered the Welcome to the Sea,Capellini Burro e Timo, Capesante Inpanata!

All the dishes were perfect! Enjoyed the freshness of the abalone, sea urchin, lobster and scallop! Pasta was probably the highlight!

Didacus was the main service personnel who attended to me throughout the dining service and the service was simply immaculate! Jasmine and Cai Ying also served me as well and they displayed super good service!

Strongly recommend this Italian Restaraunt!"
Appreciable,"We wanted a fine restaurant for enjoy Italian food appetit, little bit fine dine but good taste with savour"
Great ambience. Great service. Yummy food,"Ambience is great for a couple night out.
The Japanese Degustazione Menu really suits me. I love the soup & pasta totally.
Thanks Didacus, Jasmine, Cai Ying, Sarah & Chef Sasaki for the great evening."
A very pleasant dining experience,"Food was excellent by chef Sasaki. Importantly, we were attended by a team of very friendly people, namely Didacus, Cai Ying, Jasmine and Sarah. Will sure be back!"
Great Birthday Lunch,Lunch was great and surprisingly affordable. Served by Didacus who provided impeccable service. Will be back
Great food!!! Excellent service!,"1st time visiting here for a birthday lunch for my wife. Surprisingly very very tasty food. A nice restaurant with a nice view, great food, great service from the team and chef! Definitely will come back here for more celebrations."
Fantastic food with wonderful service!,"We would like to compliment the team for the fantastic food and the wonderful service when we were there for dinner on 20th Apr.

Thank you for the amazing experience, Didacus, Cai ying, Jasmine, Joel and Chef Sasaki‚ô•Ô∏è we will definitely be back!"
"Wonderful food and ambience, perfect for anniversary dinner","My husband and I chose this venue to celebrate our anniversary and we had no regrets. Even though it was our first time here, we enjoyed ourselves with the creative, beautifully plated and delicate/refined Japanese-Italian gastronomy that surprised our tastebuds at each turn. Each dish is a feast for both the eyes and the tummy. While the food was the main star of the show, other highlights that complement this meal include the tasteful music, soft lighting, cosy indoor ambience by the Hilton hotel poolside, as well as the memorable service by the team: Didacus, Cai Ying, Jasmine and Joel, with special mention to Didacus for checking in regularly at our table and providing warm, friendly conversation to put us at ease. We are already planning our next trip back to Il Cielo and can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs next in store - since the seasonal menu changes every quarter to reflect the palates and flavours of four seasons. Today was the spring menu but we can‚Äôt wait to see what flavours and textures that summer, fall and winter bring! Looking forward to come back and relax in a restaurant that serves food - and hospitality - from the soul."
