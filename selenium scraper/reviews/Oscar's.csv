Best dining experience with excellent service and food,"Been to OSCAR‚ÄôS to celebrate my wife‚Äôs birthday. I love the food and excellent service provided. Special mention to Fernando, Karen and Melody who served us. Service was prompt and they are super friendly. Food quality was very good too as they keep changing and innovating. Everything was fresh and delicious; my stomach was the only thing limiting me from enjoying more.

Thank you once again for the great team serving us and thank you again for the excellent service, Fernando, Karen and Melody. Keep up the good work. Will return and will recommend to others."
You will be spoilted with a wide selection of yummy food!,The standard and quality of the food is good. Nice relaxing ambience to have a sumptuous meal. Accompanied by friendly staff who really look after you.
Always a great buffet,"Have stayed here a number of times over the years. I love the breakfast buffet - well stocked, lots of variety and friendly staff. They're also happy to bring a Straits Times for you to have a read whilst enjoying the food!"
Oscar's Experience,"Dined at Oscar's for dinner. The wide spread of food across the buffet table top spoilt us with options. We are impressed with the group of staff whom took their time and patience to serve every table (restaurant was packed with Diners). Service was never compromised and we would like to extend our thank you to Janeth, Ferando & Mamdy; they have been polite and friendly and see to our request. Thank you for having us Oscar's"
Hidden gem among hotel buffets,"Came here for a family dinner. Food is completely on par with other hotel buffets like Melt Cafe or Edge. And Oscar‚Äôs standard of service surpasses them. The fresh seafood, cheeseboard, Western, Indian, BBQ, soup and dessert sections were excellent. I had repeat helpings of the potato gnocchi and chocolate jivara cake.

Misses? We felt the Asian section needed improvement. Cooking skills could be better. Fried noodles and rice dishes were not very tasty. Sashimi and sushi didn‚Äôt look too appetizing and the sushi rice was cold and tasteless. From the BBQ outside, Korean gochujang striploin was too salty without any smoky aroma, however, my parents enjoyed their pork chop with apple sauce, chicken thigh and sambal stingray.

Special mention for excellent service. They are the BEST among the buffets we‚Äôve visited. We were served by Melody, Annebelle and Janeth. The rest of the crew were also attentive. Plates were quickly cleared and someone would respond each time we looked a bit lost or needed something. The lobby staff were warm and welcoming too. It was a pleasure to visit the Conrad and we had a wonderful evening at Oscar‚Äôs. Thanks everyone, keep up the good work!"
A high enjoyable dinner at Oscar‚Äôs tonight,"This place used to be my playground in my early career days. Beside fond memories of meeting friends for coffee at late night. One of fond memories was coming here for buffet with friends and families. Christmas buffet is almost a must come for us. Due to Covid, I haven‚Äôt been here for last 3 years. I wasn‚Äôt expecting more than what I used to get, but the experience was again surprising and pleasant. Food is excellent, buffet introduced a BBQ counter whereby the grilled beef was super tasty. Special mention on the frontline staff melody and manager Annabelle, their service was fabulous. Typically you have piles of plates waiting to be changed out during buffet dining . Tonight, they changed plates swiftly before me asking. More importantly, they were very observant and attentive to diners need. For example, once they observe we are eating desserts, they came and asked if we are done with main course. I replied yes, and to my surprise, the desserts utensils are already well laid out on the table when I return to the seats. They also came and ask if we would like coffee or tea to up with the dessert. Restaurant is quite busy with about 90% occupancy rate, so I don‚Äôt expect them to be as attentive as this. Melody left a really pleasant impression. Even my visitor who is a tourist felt pleased with the service and commented ‚Äúwow, Singapore changed plates so efficiently and service was so good‚Äù. Kudos ladies. You deserved me spending time to write this long review for you. Lastly, happy Chinese new year next week!"
Good customer service,"Waitresses,Melody,Annebelle and Janeth, were all very solid,cups were always filled and they are very friendly even recommending certain dishes and favourites,they always check up on us regularly and have fast services.Kudos to them."

Oscar's is a great place to treat loved ones on special occasions,"We had not seen our son in almost three years. On his final evening in Singapore, my wife and I treated him to Oscar's evening buffet before his return to Japan. Mandy greeted us and led us to a really nice table-for-three. The choices of food, drinks and desserts, with water, tea or coffee, was excellent. Our waitress (in our area) attended to replenishing plates, refilling our drinks, and brought tea and coffee with our desserts. We highly recommend Oscar's for creating 'precious moments' with those you love."

Hope to visit again."
What a lovely dinner time!,"Service is superbly good as I think everyone is attentive and pleasantly sweet to us. kudos to Mandy, Bala and Janeth. Appreciate their sweet and gentle tone despite not being able to see their faces. :) I think service overrides the spread of food for me but I would definitely return for ambience and improvement of food.

Beef - was much tough and hoping it would much tenderised by the next time. :)

Chilli crab - was kinda a disappointment to me.

Oysters - fresh and sweet."

Nice variety w fresh oysters & lobsters but BBQ was bad.,"BBQ is one of the worst - unacceptable. Better not to have it then if you want to cut corners. Meat is tough, no char, seasoning is blah."
Food,Was there to celebrate my birthday. Food was terrible especially seafood and dessert. Not worth the price and will not return
Good variety of food,"Excellent spread and variety; staff were also friendly and attentive. Our plates were cleared promptly even though it was a busy night.

Good Buffet Lunch,Nice Ambience; good spread and choice of foods from starters to mains to desserts; attentive service and reasonable pricing.

Melody, Yoga and Mandy were superb in their service. They were able to fit us in the main dining area even though the original booking can only accommodate us at the terrace.
They even gave us a chocolate cake to celebrate our wedding anniversary.... a wonderful gesture!
The staff was also helpful to get us decaf coffee when we asked for it.
Pricing was higher than normal because of the Christmas menu but was able to get 15% credit card discount. It will be 20% if Citibank card is used."

Complimentary Note to Mandy and Fernando,"I would like to thank both Mandy and Fernando on that day for our dining experience at Oscar.

Mandy was warmth, patient, and attentive towards our needs and all these finer details, she went ahead with the extra miles to make us feel comfortable since we were seated at the isle - external seating plan. She attended to us, and made a series of recommendation of the special delights of the food and desserts which were catered to the masses. We love chatting with her.

Fernando is a gentleman who eluded smiles and warmth within him. He too, ensure that great care was given to us on that day, simply because we were too, seated at the external isle. His attentiveness brought great commendation since he refilled our drinks attentively without us having to approach any of the relevant staff.

For the meals, the food was fantastic and no words I could use to describe the awesome feeling and the experience dining at Oscar. Drinks was good and the same goes to the dessert section.

Some of the favorites are Char Kway Teow, Mango Puree, and the waffles which came with the different Sauces. The prawns were fresh on the day itself. Not to forget the Satay and the BBQ Sotong which were derived from the BBQ Section, and the delicious mouthwatering Fish Bee Hoon and Wanton Noodles from the Noodles section.

One delightful dessert which captivated our heart is the Pistachio cake, which came in small slices......

I would definitely come back for their warmth dining experience again at Oscar."

They service was excellent and the staff were attentive, changing plates whenever we finished our food on the plate.
(please note. There are other food as well, eg BBQ, grill, laksa, etc. Only if i could have a bigger stomach).
For coffee, they even have a coffee machine and the staff would help you to get a coffee of your choice. So that you don't even have to lay a hand. Mocha is my favourite.
Special mention to Paru and her colleagues too."

Oscar‚Äôs festive buffet lunch,"We had the festive buffet lunch and were impressed with the Xmas spread. The restaurant was full on a Monday afternn and we were only left with outdoor seats. We managed to shift in after the crowd lessen. Oysters were always replenished and fresh. The beef was perfectly roasted. Xmas pastries, cookies and ice cream were yummy too. It‚Äôs my mum‚Äôs birthday, I made a remark during reservation but didn‚Äôt expect anything out of it. The staff surprised my mum with a cake and a birthday board for us to take photos. We were pleasantly surprised! Thank you Oscar‚Äôs staff for the great experience."

Splendidly awesome!!,"Very very good experience. Excellent customer service. I was there for an anniversary celebration but didn‚Äôt expect that kind of reception received. I will definitely visit it again in the near future. Thumbs-up experience, keep it up üëçüèª"
"Fantastic service , good hygiene and quality food.","I was here for a lunch buffet with my family of 4. This is my second visit. My last visit was with my friend before the lifting of the Covid measures.

I like the quality food here and I prefer certain food stations to be manned by the crew. This is one of the main reasons why I choose Oscar again.

Sashimi is refrigerated and manned by the crew.
The oyster is fresh and frequently replenished.
Good quality and wide spread of dessert and the ice cream is manned by the crew too.

Friendly crew who manned the western food and Chinese food.

Special thanks to Amin who is so hardworking, friendly and constantly making us feel at home, with his heartwarming service and playing the role of a host.
You will never feel left out with his presence.
He is an asset to every company and organization.

Thank you Han Keat , for making every one of us a pot of hot tea/coffee. Usually, tea is on self-service but over here at Conrad Centennial (Oscar restaurant), they take your order, give you recommendations and see to the details. Han Keat is friendly and approachable. I hope that the company will keep him so that every guest can enjoy his great service.

I would definitely come back again, albeit the price of the buffet has increased but I feel it's the value and wonderful experience that matter more.

Keep up the good work!"

Lunch at Oscar‚Äôs,I‚Äôve been to Oscar‚Äôs many times and they never disappoint. The food is awesome and the service excellent. Kudos to Amin and Htay for making this Friday lunch even better. Thank you!
"Service is good, but the food can be better.","The selection is not exactly great, the spread isn't so good. The waiter James was attentive and quick. I seldom use the word inedible but I had to use it twice in this review. The bakar sotong was terrible, totally not fresh, it was gummy and grainy - inedible. The yakiniku beef was inconsistent, the cut was done terribly and there was so much tendons that no human would be able to bite through them; It was tough and like chewing an eraser - inedible. There were a few pieces which were okay after cutting away the tendons ourselves but we couldn't possibly salvage every piece. It just defeats the purpose of having an enjoyable buffet dinner and birthday celebration. The dessert section managed to score some points, we all like the lychee parfait. Oh please get some to check on the female toilet, the girls saw a cockroach in one of the cubicles. There is nothing to ""wow"" us. I hope the restaurant can work on something uniquely good and deliver the punch."
Very good quality buffet,"Enjoyed the buffet quite a lot. Pretty good quality food served. Dessert was awesome. However, the BBQ and Noodles station were not really nice. The BBQ food and laksa were not tasty and did not have the BBQ charred taste"
One best dining experiences,Fanando and Melody and Yoga were excellent. Their service and hospitality is simply amazing! Briiliant execution of service! Made our family dinner really pleasant and made the bill really worthwhile. Great food served by even greater people! Will be back for more i encourage everyone to visit oscars at least once!
"Great service, quality, variety","First time trying the weekday lunch buffet, it was full on a Thursday but the service was great. Amin and especially Jennifer were efficient and attentive, friendly and looked after us.

Over the top service,"Not my first time brunching here. The spread of food is good enough for me to keep coming back.

This time around, I would like to commend on Jennifer who had been very attentive to our table (she always the first to notice when our glasses ran low and very quick to top up too). Besides that, I truly enjoyed the small chat with her, making us feel welcomed.
