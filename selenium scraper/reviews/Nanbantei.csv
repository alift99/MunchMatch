Authentic yakitori,"Small cosy restaurant that serves a plethora of Japanese food, with lunch menus that are value for money."
Disappointing experience,Service was slow and staff attitude was terrible. Rice in bento too soft and wasn’t served hot. Choice of Yakitori is good and value for money
Food was good but Service is TERRIBLE,"I have patronize this restaurant for years but the service has been going from bad to worse.

The service staff does’t bother to greet, or smile but would show you a very disgruntled facial language.

Its insulting to even have them as service staff for a Japanese restaurant."
Great food at good price!,We always come here for lunch or dinner and we always love the food. The wagyu beef in particular is so good. Food is well seasoned and it is nice to watch the chefs preparing our food!
Still Tasty,"The missus was at Far East to do a facial, and I was walking about waiting for her, and decided to check if a reservation was possible. Luckily, they had a table.

The food was as good as remembered, though the rice did seem flatter lol. The quality and freshness of the ingredients are good, and we particularly enjoyed the okra, meatball and quail eggs skewers.

Staff were friendly and also efficient."
Fantastic value for lunch sets,"@$15.50 the set lunch includes 5 teriyaki sticks, rice with 3 toppings, soup and salad. The teriyaki sticks are of same quality as their alacarte."
Hurry Up!,Reserve with google for a table at 12:15pm and the receptionist asked to return table by 1pm. It was never mentioned in the reservation but she insisted it was there and we need to hurry up!
Gathering,A nice place to chill out with friends but music was a bit loud towards the end. Food was nice and value for money and service was good
Tasty yakitori tuck away in Far East plaza.,"Tasty yakitori. Visit on 31 January . This restaurant should be built in the 90s I order the yakitori set , bento set and garlic fried rice . All are very tasty."
Losing it's standard,"The restaurant couldnt find my booking at all, all's well when they are able to offer a table. The rice from bento and from bowl were both cold, standard has dropped a lot as compared to before."
Good food,"The 3 of us ordered the yakitori set lunch each, 5 kinds sashimi, Ikura sushi, California roll and Ebi fry. Excellent food as always!"
"Tasty, perfectly seasoned but there’s better options for the same price just not in Far East Plaza.","Probably one of the best options in Far East Shopping Center. There’s another Jap place but it doesn’t specialise in Yakitori. Place was decent, although your clothes will smell like the grill after you leave. (Might want to think of better ventilation) not bad but nothing spectacular. You don’t get that feeling of high quality and care that you’d normally get in authentic Japanese restaurants that keep to the tradition."
"Enjoyed our meal, it's been a while..","Brought my girlfriends here for a ladies night dinner. Food is still very tasty, service was great. Prices have gone up but overall still a nice casual night out!"
Great food,"Nanbantei - According to my friend, is comparable with its counterparts in Japan, even better. Great food because the quality is great. We will be back."
Frozen Sashimi,"1. We ordered Salmon Sashimi, it came frozen and inedible.
2. We also ordered yakitori set. Asked the waitress if there is mushroom, she said no. Thus we separately ordered mushroom. In the end, it does have mushroom in the set, so we have extra, could have ordered something else.
3. The set comes with rice, but it was only given to us when we have finished all the yakitori."
Tasty food as always,Lunch set was worth the price and food was tasty too. Love their yakitori. Will go back again. It's always full
Easy to reserve and good food,"Easy to reserve with instant confirmation, no surprises. Restaurant foods were consistently good value on the set lunches."
Attentive and friendly service.,"Attentive and friendly service. Yakitori sticks are fresh and tasty. Meat balls are juicy, without being overly seasoned"
Nostalgia and good value,"Tucked away on the 5th floor of Far East Plaza, this restaurant is an icon. The yakitori is top-notch as usual. Menu is extensive and great selection. Be prepared for your clothes to smell smoky afterward."
Comfort food,Always a joy to eat here. Service and food quality through all my visits are consistently top and good.
Very good Yakitori restaurant.,Very good Yakitori restaurant. Skewers cooked on charcoal. Very good choice of meat and vegetables. As good as in Tokyo.
Hidden gem - lovely Japanese eatery at Far East Plaza,Hidden at level 5 of Far East Plaza is this cosy Japanese eatery Nanbantei with interesting skewer bento sets. The tiny entrance that directly faces the escalator belies a cosy interior with a more open outer section and a semi private inner section. It's always busy during lunch time so it's better to make reservations in advance.
All time favorite place for,All time favorite place for yakitori restaurant. Great food at reasonable price. Service is always good.
Satisfying meal,Very nice and good set lunch Varieties of freshly grilled yakitori chicken pork veggie salmon quail eggs mushroom among others We will be back. Thank you
Great Food and Ambiance,"This place is great! Inside the mall on the 5th floor and surrounded by other restaurants and amenities. My only negative feedback is how they advertise / show the combo dinners. They show them with soup, rice and other sides. When I got the bill there was a charge for each one. This felt a little deceptive.

Overall the food was great and I'll be back the next time I'm in Singapore."
Still good,"It has been a while since we ate here and we were looking forward to the yakitori bento set. They have kept the prices low, but now dessert has to be paid for.

There are two choices - quail eggs or asparagus. The eggs were good if a tad dry, but we loved the asparagus. The rice seemed less that previously, but the set was still okay."
Good variety of Yakitori,"Booked online directly with restaurant on the day.

Far East Plaza is a stones through from Tangs and perhaps better known for nails, reflexology and cheap eats.

Place is small and cosy. There’s a counter like sushi restaurant except centres on the grill. Tables are for 4 so you need to call if party is bigger.

Have high chairs and wait staff friendly.

We found the yakitori menu quite extensive. The better ones were chicken wings, meatballs and pork wrapped tomato with cheese (yes). Overall though the meat was on the over cooked side and over salted - and I suspect MSG given my mouth feels a bit itchy 2 hrs after the meal.

There are other side dishes, sushi, gyoza, noodles - the kids liked the cold udon.

Won’t be rushing back but if ur hunkering for yakitori worth a try."
Always good grill - but can be better,"The yakitori is great! Service is a bit average and actually kinda dropped a bit in comparison to the earlier days. Whatever you do, DON’T ORDER foie gras... it’s awful 😭😭 But almost everything on the yakitori menu is great!"
Awesome,we overan the timing due to meeting overrun and the staff were still very patient and of course the food was great too.
Enjoy lunch time with my friends,"Small but welcoming surroundings with limited seats, better reservation before visit. The grilled meat and vegetables are very tasty."
Great food,It was a lunch for a group of five. We wanted to try to set lunch but end up trying the bundle set for sharing. Didn’t regret it at all. It was still as good as the lunch set (not the first time we were there). Cozy place and nice ladies servicing us.
Weekend lunch,"Dropped by for a sunday lunch, recommended by a friend. Pretty quiet, not crowded. Ordered a variety of skewers, mostly average in quality. Service also local and blah. They wanted us out at 230pm"
First dinner,We had a good time in Nanbantei. It's specialized in yakitori (grilled items) and they are very good in quality and taste. Value for money as we pick on the set meal which we enjoyed a lot.
Fantastic food cooked right in front of you!,My husband and I have been eating here for years and the food and the staff are always amazing. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable and we always feel at home here. The food is so delicious!
Great lunch deals,"This restaurant has been here for 20+ years, it has never disappointed me . it kept its standards even after so many years."
"Nice food, nice restaurant, nice service","The food is consistently nice, the staff is friendly, the ambience is like entering a small Japanese BBQ shop.m, for hang out after work, enjoy the company."
New Bento Menu,"The favourite bento menu from Nanbantei was revised so instead of just a single set, it has now become 2 sets. The positive side of the revision is that now we have an option of no quail eggs and instead a stick of Shiitake mushrooms (Set B). A good thing for the health conscious. The downside is there's a change of recipe of the chicken balls and pork with leek. The chicken balls now have more ginger in them and the pork with leek are now smothered with garlic. While my family and I prefer the old recipe for these yakitori sticks, they are still scrumptious nonetheless. With Nanbantei Far East Plaza branch, food is only one of the factors. The other two factors that keep bringing my family back are the friendly service and intimate environment that never disappoint us in making our meals there always enjoyable."
Traditional yakitori experience,The setting was Cosy and service good. Of course the food was good. The portion was sufficient and grilled to perfection. Price was justified.
Always so yummy.!!,Always a good meal when dining there. Waitress there are all nice and friendly too. Nice yakitori place that I will always reco my friends to!
Authentic yakitori ...,This is probably one of the more authentic yakitori Japanese restaurants in Singapore. The sitting area is rather small so best to make reservations. Great food and worth a try.
Something has changed.,"I have been here many times and I have enjoyed the Yakitori here and it is still good but.... something has happened. Some skewers were burnt and we cancelled some.
Maybe the difference was that there was only one chef. Previously the last 25 years there were two.
We asked for “less salt” as there seems to be a habit to pinch a lot of salt on every stick. We still enjoy the food but not as much earlier years."
Nice yakitori,I love this location for their foie gras. I usually go for the yakitori and garlic rice. Service is poor and slow but the food quality brings me back.
Excellent Japanese Grilled Skewer Food,The food never disappoints. Quality is good and the taste is sublime. Reservations through Chope was easy and no hassle. Have been using this method to get a place and everytime I am successful.
Amazing!,"My family had our annual Christmas lunch at Nanbantei as we love the Bento sets (Set A & B) tremendously. As expected of the restaurant, the food quality is consistently excellent all these years (I've been its customer since 1991), good value, amiable service, and lovely quaint ambience."
Fresh jap place on higher end pricing,"Went w family of 8 and managed ordered nost of the yakitoris as well as unagi, tempura and sashimi etc. Everything we ordered was fresh and flavourful excecuted. Was recommended Hiyaoroshi sake, a premium autumn harvest sake with mellow sweet taste so smooth to drink up. Will totally recommend this jap place though its slight on higher pruce about $400 for 8 of us."
nanbentai,"We have been eating here for around 8 years, around 7-9 times per year. However this visit has been not so good because the standard of the food has dropped. The grilled skewers meat are no longer juicy & tender - pretty dry & no longer tasty like before. I think it could be the grilling standards has affected the food quality too."
Casual Dinner,A truly authentic Japanese yakitori restaurant where food are freshly prepared and cooked on the spot to the satisfaction of customers. Nice ambient with a resemblance of having a meal in Japan 😋
"Cosy ambience, hearty food",Do make reservations for lunch as the place quickly fills up. Great place for kushiyaki; unpretentious wholesome food.
great place for izakaya,"found this spot after searching yelp...not many reviews but worth the walk. i'm glad i didn't stop at another spot while walking to this one

reservation is probably recommended given the small space but I didn't make one, yet they sat us (two people) and we just need to eat/drink within an hour and half, which wasn't an issue

menu is extensive with great combos or a la carte orders

great sake selections too

overall, good experience and i would go back"
Awesome yakitori,"Cozy ambience, tables are small and seating space is cramped. There was a point where there wasn't enough space to place the dishes we ordered on the table. Good selection of Japanese Sake. Only 2 choices of red wine and 2 choices of white wine. Food was good as always. I would recommend the Lamb chops... There were so juicy and tender with just the right amount of char."
Heavenly Yakitori,"The yakitori is utterly delightful, juicy, crispy and seasoned to perfection. The accompanying Ochazuke was the perfect accompaniment to balance flavours. The service was friendly and quick. Would definitely recommend. Reservation would be recommended as the restaurant is popular."
Nice dinner,"As the restaurant is not too big, tables got filled up rather fast. Reservation is recommended. Food is good, my family enjoyed it ! Will be coming back to try the set lunch."
Nanbantei never fails to wow us,Nanbantei never fails to wow us. We always love the food there. recommends to make reservation as they are usually packed.
My favourite Yakitori joint,"Nanbantei has got to be my favourite Yakitori place ever since i tried it!

Ordered a variety of Yakitori sticks and enjoyed them very much. My fav was the Beef tongue, chicken heart and chicken gizzard! Also enjoyed their garlic fried rice, but wished they came in bigger bowls. However, it might not be exactly wallet-friendly unless you're going for their lunch sets. :(

Sat right in front of the yakitori counter and enjoyed a good showmanship by the chefs.

Would return for more yakitori goodness soon. :)"
Wow,"Possibly the best Japanese I have ever eaten. Modern, newly fitted out restaurant. Located in a shopping centre. Fabulous and friendly staff. Very reasonable prices. Dinner for two incl. drinks cost circa SING 70. We ordered mixed tempura, grilled teryaki salmon, garlic fried rice for two, miso soup for two, grilled chicken wings and beer. Absolutely delicious. Absolutely highly recommended."
Wow..,I am surprised and delighted to see that this restaurant is still around. Came to this place more than twenty years ago. Food is still delicious and the taste is still consistently good. Drop by if you are in the area.
Scrumptious!,"We love this place so much, it transports me to the old alleys of Japan, the food is fantastic and the service is always perfect."
still generally good value for money (lunch),"i've been going to nanbantei for many years. i guess as a sign of the times and economy, items that used to be included as part of lunch the sets, now require separate top ups (e.g. desserts). however overall, still generally good value for money, and quality of food is still great."
Good place for yakitori,"This place has been in operation for a Long time. The food are good and delicious .

Day time set lunch meals are cheaper as compared to dinning there in the night.

I loves the bento set.

Highly recommended if you want to go for a yakitori meal ."
Traditional Japanese Restaurant,"Clean, well organized, friendly atmosphere, a cozy Japanese place, the way they welcome you is very friendly, even when you go out all the staff they cheer, its new experience to me, the food was extraordinary, I ordered Tempura mixed seafood.
overall it was OK, the price was ok."
Couldn't move afterwards,"We all had the Yakitori Course, which was delicious apart from the gingko nuts (something I associate with medicinal stews brewed up by my grandma, bless her). The dessert was sweet red beans, which you either love or hate. I was so full I couldn't move afterwards."
Nice food,"We love the hot sake , the fried baby shrimp and the delicious yakitori. Ambience was good. Advanced booking is needed to avoid disappointment."
Ichiban No. 1,"During visits to Asia, USA and Europe I have been looking for a Yakitori restaurant that is as good as Nanbantei at Far East Plaza.
Nanbantei is the best Yakitori since they opened many years ago.
The a la carte skewers are really the best. My original Yakitori experience is from a small Yakitori restaurant close to Motomatchi Yokohama Japan. Nanbantei is as good as this one.
Fantastic. We love it."
Authentic yakitori with great ambience!,"The ambience was amazing, small cosy and rustic, felt like I was really back in Japan. The grilled items were also delicious, (do try the dashimaki tamago too!) and tasted authentic - sauce and seasoning was just nice. Staff was also very attentive to our needs. Price point wise a little high but I do think it's worth it for the food, ambience and service."
Lunch at Nanbantei,"Sumptuous food, though it's a bit pricier for lunch. There was a lunch crowd but with reservations, able to get a private dining area"
Nanbantei - Old School's still the best,This restaurant has been around for ages and always delivers in terms of delicious yakitori. Their variety of yakitori sticks is extraordinary and there's definitely something for everyone.
Dinner,"Environment, a plus similar to a Japanese yakitori outlet. Couldn't asked for more. Attentive waitress and meet expectation overall."
yakitori place,Went with girlfriend for the first time in July 2017 and we love it so much that we went again this year feb. we enjoyed sitting at the counter. Cosy atmosphere and nice food!
Favourite,Value for money set lunch. Good location at Orchard and a variety of selection on the set lunch menu.
"Ok, but not great.",Food was ok. I’m not a big fan of the service experience. We needed to ask multiple times for drinks to different staff before they eventually arrive. Also cooks and staff all speaks Chinese... not great as authentic Japanese experience..
The food is fantastic! The memu has slight change so do the prices,The food is fantastic! The lunch menu has slight change so did the prices. No more free dessert. But the quality is still worth for the price.
Fantastic,"Since the birth of our son, it has been a long time since the 2 of us found some time to have a meal together, and after a little bit of searching we found Nanbantei, i can't really recall everything except that the house pour sake was nice and chilled and all the food was excellent, damage was 240 inclusive of 2 bottles of sake. Well worth it!"
price revision,They revised the price a little and also changed the set too. Basically not much changes but now it doesn’t come with dessert - u have to top up for dessert! Used to be great value for lunch set but not anymore!
Wishful Thinking,"As one of my favourite dining places in Singapore, the experience is good except for one thing. It has revised the menu, especially my favourite lunch bento set.

Previously, there's only 1 type of Bento set but now it's offered in 2 types (Set A & Set B). Totally removed is the Pork Yakitori and replaced with the Pepper Pork Yakitori. While it's good, I think it isn't as good as the former when compared.

The good thing is now there's an alternative to the Quail Eggs Yakitori. The alternative is the Shiitake Mushroom Yakitori, which is always my favourite from the a la carte menu.

Service is always attentive, friendly and prompt."
Great food and service :),Cozy place and great food and service There’s some changes to the weekday set lunch menu ... hence it’s slightly priced now ...
Highly recommended !,Great experience and attentive service. Highly recommended. Food serving is fast and tasty too. Value for money.
Lovely Jap feels,"Visited Nanbantei on a weekday night for dinner with a friend. Love the vibes, it wasnt too rowdy for decently audible conversations to take place. The portions were alright, loved some skewers but other like the chicken liver is really more of a personal preference thing. A little hard to get the attention of the staff, other than that, it is a pretty good restaurant, will likely return."
Value for money lunch set,It's our regular Japanese restaurant for office celebrations as they have value for money lunch sets.
Great yakitori set lunch with a reasonable price.,"Nanbantei has been in Far East Plaza for more than 30 years and is still packed with people very weekday lunch because there are great set lunch deals. This is a small restaurant famous for its yakitori.

The most popular set lunch is the yakitori set. For SGD15.90 you will get 1 stick of grilled mushroom, chicken balls, chicken meat, asparagus wrapped in bacon and pork belly. Every piece of the yakitori was grilled to perfection. The grilled mushroom was tender and juicy. The chicken balls was also tender and full of flavour, The chicken meat was excellent too, The pork belly was with sufficient fat to make it taste so good. Perhaps the best yakitori was the asparagus wrapped with bacon. The asparagus was soft, fresh and the bacon wrapping gave it an unique flavour. I love this most. The yakitori set came with japanese rice with sliced mushroom and sea weed. We also ordered a beef set. The beef was not hard and very edible, A good choice to fill up the hungry stomach.

I have to eat fast so that I can enjoy the yakitori warm. The air conditioner was strong and the the food got cold quite quickly

This is a no frill restaurant with good prices. Better make a reservation for lunch before going or you may not have a seat."
Nice as usual,"Lunch obento set is nice as usual. However, they have increased the price and replaced some of the items in the obento set. Hopefully they will bring back the quail eggs."
Always a Treat!,"A very authentic yakitori place hidden in Far East Plaza. The lunch bento set is the most worth it, at less than $20 for a meal that feels you up to the brim. It's always a treat to visit Nanbantei with my colleagues for lunch. Do make reservations if possible as the place is popular with officer workers during lunch time."
Lunch at Nanbantei,Requested for a table seat of 2 pax and they acceded to our request. Cosy and private section in the restaurant. Food was fantastic and value for $! Well recommended!!
Booking reservation is easy,"The food is quite salty. The restaurant atmostphere is nice. The service is good. Overall, nice food, nice place"
Yakitori that are so authentic!,Yakitori sticks that are so authentic! Always looking forward to nanbantei. Our fave venue for hangout
The good old days,"Had lunch here out of nostalgia because I remembered having eaten here some 20 years ago with an old friend. The ventilation is good because despite sitting at the counter in full view of the grill in action, did not smell like a walking BBQ pit after that. No wonder it is filled with executives taking advantage of the set lunch offers. The service staff are personable and efficient, making it a pleasant dining experience. Would come back in the evening to see if the food is any different, or better."
excellent service and foods,"nanbantei has great choices. we always have an excellent meal there. 3 orders of seven spices chicken wings grilled to perfection, just nice tofu nabe, not to miss garlic pork,.... can't wait till our next visit."
Ok,"Not as good as I remembered it before. Did not really like the attitude of the service staff. Food was alright, albeit a tad salty"
regular gathering go to restaurant,This is a regular gathering restaurant with my friends as the quality has always remain consistently good.
Disappointed with Chinatown Point Outlet,"Wanted a good meal but disappointed with the food when it come, the difference is too big especially for the rice roll, tempura, salmon fish and dessert (I don have the picture for this). And for this price it is totally not worth it."
Will definitely return!,"It was my first try at Nanbantei. The foods are authentic and sooo yummy that I can't get enough of them. Ordered the signature bento that served with their special miso paste dip, awesome!!!"
Dinner,Staff was confused with my booking and took awhile to figure it out. Food was good. Expect the grill smell to stain your clothing haha
Love the yakitori,"The place is very small. However, the food is good and price is very reasonable . If you are looking for nice yakitori, visit this restaurant , you won't be disappointed."
Never Disappoints,"My family had our lunch at one of our favourite restaurants and it never disappoints us. It's always the consistently good food, service and ambience."
Nanbantei Lunch,Enjoyed the food very much. been there many time and it never disappoint me and my friends! We love all the yakitori sticks.
Yummy!,Food was so good! We had the skewers set lunch.. value for money! Will definitely be back again! A little smokey in the dining area.. but I would say this is unavoidable since its an open grilling area.
Best Yakirori in Singapore,"Feels a bit like Japan. Excellent food, not only the yakitori. Very friendly service, all the time in a good mood. Also some good Sake at fair prices. My favorite restaurant in Singapore."
Never disappoint !,Been my favourite Japanese restaurant ! Been patronising them for the last 10years! Food never fail and their lunch bento set is really value for money!
Good food!,It was quite noisy at the back but the food was good. Portions for the side dishes were quite good this time around.
Value for Money Set Lunches,"We had one Unadon & Tempura Set, and a Kitsune Udon Set. The unagi was grilled to perfection, while the fried chicken with the udon set was juicy and tender, yet not oily. Simply delicious and value for money. The service staff was very helpful too."
Excellent Japanese eatery,"Very friendly staff, checked our reservation and guided us to our seats upon entering the restaurant. Food is fantastic and I will definitely come back again!"
