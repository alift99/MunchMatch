Great food,"Was there to celebrate the new year with family. Food portion was great, service was excellent. Recommended!"
"Great Service, Great Food & Beer","Portions are big - we are happy the waitstaff advised us against ordering 2 plates which we assumed were for 1 each, and recommended we share a plate and order more if needed. The beer recommendation was great as well. It was an unhurried experience and we enjoyed it thoroughly!"
good food and service,The Chope booking was excellent. Good service by Alan and the staff. Atmosphere is good and food is excellent too. Will come back again.
Enjoyable restaurant,"My wife and I are regular visitors to Singapore from Australia and we always choose to eat at Brotzeit Raffles City.
This time we were in Singapore for 11 days and ate at Brotzeit for 3 of those days.
Their food and service is first class."
Dinner,"Reservation made at this one of the five restaurant outlets in Singapore due to its signature German dishes. I drank 3 glasses of Erdinger Dunkel and ate Pork Knuckle warm the night out with my insurance agent. Too bad, there is no promotion going on for this meal bundle."
great night out with great food and beers,"Love the atmopshere here it's always lively and the staff are always looking after us, forever smiling! Love the range of German beers and wines. Love the platers especially the chicken and pork and cheese/meats. Great way to spend an evening. Highy recommended."
Very Poor Customer Service,"Despite Brotzeit's website stating that the only way to make a reservation for people less than 15 is to contact the outlet directly, after hours of attempted calls to the Raffles City outlet during non-peak hours, no one picked up the call. Running out of time and ideas on how to reserve, I posted a facebook post on Brotzeit's Raffles Place to ask how to reserve if no one is picking up calls. They quickly removed my FB post and didnt respond nor contact me back. So left with no choice, I messaged Brotzeit's main Facebook account. It has been more than a week, still nobody contacted me to offer any assistance. This is very disappointing poor customer service. I will likely stay away from Brotzeit from now on."
Time for German fare & booze,"Didn't book a dinner reservation but managed to get a table after a wait for about 15-20mins. Ordered a platter for 4-5pax and the meaty fare was good but portion was huge ( if you come with kids, suggest a smaller portion). Wide variety of beers available and the head server was very kind to offer my 2 kids juices on the house.
Overall a good meal experience."
So-so food,"Food (pork ribs with some honey sauce) recommended by staff was so-so. Chicken tasted good, even the breast meat. Steak is good too. But pricey. Good for gatherings."
Excellent like I remember,Been two years no traveling and we stopped by for lunch. Excellent and just like we remember maybe a bit better. Highly recommend this spot specially if you love German food Schnitzel like we go even pretzels are great.
Not an ideal place to chill and relax,"Sad to say but my post bday in brotzeit Raffles was a very bad experience. The booking system only allows you to stay for 2hrs, regardless you have a barrel of beer and a platter to finish you have to pay and leave immediately after 2 hrs. In the nutshell, this is not an ideal place for you to chill, and also not advisable to order a barrel or platters, a glass or 2 probably..."
Brozeit Raffles City,Food and drinks were good. Service was below average. Manager saw us arrived and pretended not to see so he didn’t need to serve. We were also overcharged for our beer.
Great food and service!,"Brotzeit has a good selection of food and beers, and the team always make sure that their guest are well taken care of. Thank you Michelle and Marivel for the warm service!"
I love Brotzeit,I came for dinner with friends to celebrate my (post) birthday. Everything was perfect. The food was great. Always loved Brotzeit and one of my favourites. Great staff too specially Sharon and Marivel. I got a surprise cupcake courtesy from them. Very friendly and amazing ambiance. Place is very convenient too. Will sure visit again in the near future.
A great NYE dinner!,"Friendly staff, good service and really nice food. We booked early knowing that would be spending New Year’s Eve in Singapore and I’m glad we did because it was a really good evening. The meat platter was delicious and despite us being a family of 5, we couldn’t finish it. The restaurant is always clean and staff are attentive. The beer is pretty good too. Definitely have dinner here if you’re ever in Singapore!"
Watery cocktails & impersonal service,"Been here a couple of times not for the service or food, just the convenience of its location.

They have a reservation system that allows you to opt for indoor or outdoor seating BUT they never honour your requests. You show up on time and you get the exact opposite seating preference. Protest all you want, they basically don't give a toss with the steady stream of diners eager to just eat there.

The beer is decent, the knuckle is a little dry most of the time, sausages often rubbery, rosti is good but avoid the cocktails and other beverages at all cost. You essentially get served colored ice water, devoid of any spirits or flavour. The cocktails are served in huge glasses, filled to the brim with ice so you're initially wowed into thinking you lucked out. Then you walk out of the restaurant feeling like you paid handsomely for ice water. Pretty bad deal.

Guess it's location at the end of the day. If they just trained their staff to be warmer, stopped overcooking their food and made some decent drinks behind the bar, they could be half decent."
Good experience,We went on New year Eve. Service is good despite the crowd. We had their bundle set which is just nice for us.
"Lunch@Brotzeit, Raffles City","I had a lovely lunch at Brotzeit, Raffles City. The ambience of this outlet is very good. The current menu offering is well curated, especially the set lunch menus. The service was attentive and good. Upon completing lunch, my friend and I had a hot beverage each to wrap up our meal. I had a simple long black coffee and it was a good long black. Overall, I had a lovely meal and time at this Brotzeit outlet. I will certainly come back here again."
Service was bad,"Was told member of brotzeit will be given a complimentary slice of cake for birthday however after dinner, when we requested for our cake to be served, we were told NO the policy has changed. No apology was made and the service staff was very rude. No alternative or dessert menu was provided to us too. We chose brotzeit to celebrate our friend’s bday but it turned out to be a huge disappointment."
Poor Service Despite Empty Restaurant,"We made a booking at Brotzeit Raffles City at 5:30PM and were directed to a table in a fairly empty restaurant. Walk-in customers were turned away at the front counter, as the restaurant was apparently fully booked.
After 5min we ordered and within 15min my wife received her meal, and after 25min my daughter had received her order. At this point we ordered a beer and an apple juice for my daughter and this order took an additional This order too took 15min to arrive

Reassurance was extended to me that my order was coming but nearly an hour after our order was place - the waitress returns to advise that my order was not available. Apparently, this was due to a technical issue in that my order, which was repeated to me, was not sent to the kitchen."
Bonding with nieces,"Lunched with my nieces and had a great time. Food was excellent, portions just right and staff professional!"
Welcoming environment and tasty food,Good selection of beers and the currywurst brought me back to Berlin days. The potato leek soup was also satisfying. Casual environment is friendly for kids.
Never disappoints,"Brotzeit remains one of my family's favourite German restaurant. We like their beer and assortment of delicious food. At this visit, they offered pork crackling if you signed up the membership. It was delicious and crispy.
Serving portion is quite big, and i like it that the waiter advised us that our order should be sufficient for 2.
The service is good. In fact, i prefer the service of the Raffles City branch compared to the Vivo City one."
First time at re-opened Brotzeit branch Raffles City,"""There was some delay with my food order, but given the fact of re-opening and being very busy it's ok. Overall I like the new design and its cozy warm colors and materials. The food was great as always and the Erdinger beer is nice to drink. I was also impressed by the new selection of Schnaps. The Haemmerle Wild Plum has a pleasant aroma and tastes not so harsh as its Czech counterpart Slivovitz. Overall a good dining experience that I can absolute recommend."""
Last White Asparagus June 2021,I had white asparagus before the season 2021 ended on Sunday. The add-on pork schnitzel was juicy with a crisp breading. It went well with Erdinger Urweisse wheat beer. A double shot of Williams pear in a nice stem glass finished this delicious meal!
Great for diners in big groups,The portions were quite big and it's good for sharing. The grilled fish was one of the best that i've had as it was very juicy.
"Great Service, but some Kitchen Re-training Might be Required","This is our third time to Brotzeit at Raffles City, of which the last 2 visits were 5-star experiences.

However, something that happened today makes me question the kitchen staff’s professionalism.

We arrived at 11.15am and waited quite a bit for the wait staff (as did two other groups) as they were slightly shorthanded.

We ordered the usually perfect Premium-grilled Steak, the metre-long cheese sausage and a kids chicken and chips.

The sausage came almost immediately and was a hit as usual. The chicken was slightly dry but good with some sauce.

But the surprise came with the steak, whoch we always order as Medium. We have ordered this dish at Brotzeit Raffles City, Vivocity and Westgate, which has always been awesome! However, this time round, the steak came Well Done. We sent it back and after a 20-minute wait, it came back Well Done again. It was really disappointing!

Thankfully, with service recovery, Isay was very professional and apologetic about the double-disappointment. We stuck with our beef Well Done for today but they reimbursed us with some free dessert.

Very good service team here at Brotzeit Raffles City but the kitchen staff needs some re-training."
Great food and good value brunch,"We had a Family Easter brunch, there was lots of choice and the kids really enjoyed it. Great pork hock and ribs"
"Friendly Service Staff, Nice Food and Awesome Beer!","Went to Brotzeit at Raffles City on 30 March evening with friends. Staff were friendly. Ordered their Barramudi (which I personally find this dish abit tasteless unfortunately), Sausage platter and Salmon Rosti. Both the sausage platter and Salmon Rosti were amazing!"
Disappointed,"My husband and I used to patronise Brotzeit (Katong and Raffles City outlets) when we were living in Singapore; we always have the Pork Knuckles platter. Each time we return to Singapore, we would go to Brotzeit as we enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. The last time we went to Brotzeit Raffles City was in 2019 March. We are back in town again recently and decided to go to Brotzeit with a friend. However, we must say we couldn't hold the same opinion for Brotzeit anymore. The food (pork knuckles, Sauerkraut) is bland and tasteless. They don't have our favourite Spezi anymore! We were really disappointed and decided not to partonise at Brotzeit ever again."
Excellent services,"We all enjoyed our dinner with the great services from the restaurant staffs. The beer was great too. Our business meeting was over run and I called to delay 30 min , the staff was understanding."
Great service and good food,Great service and good food and beer. They always treat us with respect They offer a wide variety of german food and beer. Strongly recommended
Fab place for group dining!,Fab place to dine in with group of family or friends. The platter portions are huge and worth the price! The wait staff was very accommodating and even made recommendations based on the number of pax in our group and what’s good to eat!
Great service from Christopher,"My friends and I went to brotzeit as a group of 5 and ordered the pork knuckles, sausages and also beer. We were very impressed by Christopher who was attentive and hardworking, making sure to refill our waters with a great smile! Keep it up!"
Tasty sausages,"Back here for another lunch in Oct 2020. Quite busy despite it being a weekday lunchtime. Service was a little on the slow side, but the food quality was good. Opted for one of the sausage plates which was really quite tasty."
Amazing food!,"Enjoyes our appetisers and mains. Though there was a technical glitch, YJ solved it and offered us a little something to compensate. High quality food and drinks! Try the home made gluwein you miss christmas markets!"
"Great ambience, food and service","Great ambience, great selection of food and drinks. The meat platter consisting of pork knuckle, sausages, pork ribs are very good for sharing. The sides of cherry tomatoes and vegetables are simply divine. The pretzel is so good.The service staff are friendly and attentive. It’s not air conditioned which makes the ambience great. Will return."
Overall a very pleasant dining experience,"Yesterday I was at Brotzeit Raffles City and had the roasted goose. I got a nice table as requested in my reservation. The goose was delicious. The red cabbage not too sweet and not over seasoned - just right, accompanied by 2 potato dumplings and pear with cranberries. I had Erdinger Weizenbock and Urweisse to go with it. I enjoyed this dinner very much."
Fantastic Brunch....,Went there for Sunday Brunch... Great food and Service... A great place for German food and Beers......
Casual Dining,"The service staff is very helpful and knowledgeable. However, the food is a little too salty for me. The tomato soup is good. The portion may be big for someone who does not take a lot of meat. The ambience is good. The Apple Crumble is also good."
Good ambience,"The food and service is very good. I enjoyed the experience. One waiter is exceptionally helpful and attentive. I forgot to ask for his name. I feel that the pork ball is too salty, the other items are ok. The beer is good too!"
Our Fave Spot for Lunch/Dinner!,"Recently, becoming usual place for weekend’s late lunch ❤️

Menu - great variety of food to choose from appetisers, to salad, main course, drinks, and more.

Ambience - love the open space set-up.

Staff - very attentive and friendly

Food Quality and Portion - photos taken last week and this week’s lunch orders.

Half Slab Szechuan And Klassik - my ultimate favorite in Brotzeit. Not too powerful flavour yet the portion is good for sharing. Served with sauerkraut and spicy fries as side dishes.

Schnitzels - not really good especially for my husband that already tried it in Germany. He said, not even close to the real taste. So not really something we’re happy about. Big portion though. Served with salad and 2 potatoes as side dishes.

Pizza - not that great but not that bad either. Just okay, and big portion too.

Recent visit, we ordered drinks. And bill was about S$75 and earlier one was less than $70

Overall still happy though not so pleased with Schnitzels and Pizza. And always our fave place for ribs :)"
Humid environment but good food,"Choice location for diners in CBD but when it comes to weekends, the high humidity in Singapore climate + the less cool aircon from Brotzeit Raffles City does adversely affect the appetite of diners"
Disappointing and a tad expensive for what it was,"Not unusual to see very expensive foreign beer (German in this case), but I was generally disappointed with my food. I had Goulash Soup (pricey but decent) but my mains of pork sausage sauerkraut and mash came barely luke warm. I asked for it to be heated up... I think a Chef crime in a professional restaurant. 20mins later it came back with the sausage warmer but mash, etc, still barely warm. Not good and a bit careless! My wife's salad was OK... didn't need to be hot I suppose!"
Lovely polar opposites lunch,My hubby fancied a German beer and sausage lunch and I reluctantly agreed to go here with him thinking there would be nothing for me. I was wrong! Had a great salmon/ quinoa salad with a lovely poached egg and squeaky fresh salad leaves with a tasty dressing and a green juice while he tucked into a lovely sausage lunch. My fears of too big portions after reading other reviews were unfounded too. Nicely done thanks!
A Nice German Surprise in Singapore CBD,"After a Singapore Sling at Raffles Hotel we found Brotzeit across the road and liked the look of the menu so we grabbed a table.

We chose a bread medley to complement our main course of ""Duo of Chicken"" which consisted of lightly fried chicken pieces and a WHOLE roasted chicken served with a salad and fries.

It was a very tasty dish ( and large) with beautifully cooked chicken with lovely spices and the fries were terrific too.

We will happily come back to Brotzeil as it was lovely food and also very good value!"
Nice change to the usual,"Nice change to the usual Asian food available in town. Nice food, decent sized portions and well presented by knowledgeable staff. I opted for the Burger Dog, the wife had the K Dog. Both yummy, Burger Dog won me over as it came a very healthy side of fries!! We did get the little potato croquets as well (can’t recall the name) and a pretzel. Both very nice meals. Beer-a-plenty, and some fine bottled German beer they have as well. HB Dunklebrau from Munich my particular favourite. Prices are on a par with the rest of Singapore, but worth it in my opinion. All in all, a good feed, sausages aren’t as big as your traditional Bratwurst, but do the tradition proud in flavour, and as I said above as well, staff were excellent. Added to that, you’re right next door to Raffles Hotel if you fancy a Singapore Sling in the Long Bar...."
Class Gathering,"Nice atmosphere. Good for groups. Food sharing portion was huge. Only downsides are that the restaurant might want to place more (portable) fans at strategic locations as our table did not have much wind considering the ceiling fans were at other sides and also that there was only 1 server at the front of the restaurant for that Friday night (poor lady). Other than that, overall its a great place to dine and have catch ups!"
Worst meal during our visit to Singapore,"We chose Brotzeit by chance, based on the apparent popularity of the place – much busier than nearby restaurants which we usually take to be a good sign.

Wrong on all counts.

Service was appallingly slow – even though at 1.30pm we were past the lunchtime rush and people were finishing their food. The first (non-alcoholic) drink choice for my wife was not available –not an ideal start, but OK these things happen. So she chose an alternative and we ordered food at the same time – Schweinkotelett (Pork chop) and Fladen Schinken (a sort of German rye bread pizza).

We waited ages (on a hot day) for the drinks and even longer for the food to arrive - only after I had asked one of the staff how long it would take. The pork chop arrived first and my wife had eaten much of it before my Fladen arrived. The chop was OK – nothing special - but the Fladen was tough, dry and barely edible. We had waited so long for the food that I didn’t dare ask for a replacement and ate some of it. We had other plans for the afternoon and didn’t want to linger here.

I did tell the waiter that my food was not good and in fairness, the manager gave us a 10% discount on the bill – that was equivalent to SG$7 off a dish that cost SG$22. Given more time and more inclination I should have insisted that there was no charge for the Fladen. But we British don’t like to make a fuss.

It was galling, afterwards, to see on the final bill a charge of SG$ 6.44 for “service”. Non-existent service in this case.

Others seem to have better experience in this restaurant – I wish them luck, but we would never go there again."
Good German Restaurant,"Brotzeit restaurant Raffles City is well set up. Food is fresh, great quality and reasonable pricing. One draw-back is they don't do a Chicken Schnitzel - get it on the menu!"
"Fantastic Restaurant, great location incredible Food","Fantastic Restaurant, great location incredible Food. We had an awesome time in this Restaurant. The food is just sensational. If you stay in Singapore this Restaurant is a ""must go"". OK, I love German food, I could eat everything from there massive big menu, you cannot go wrong. We will be back as soon as possible."
Best Ribs as ever since 2011,"I love the ribs here, stunningly and completely best pair of beer!!!! In 8years here in singapore, it is still the best! ☺️ Thank you for serving great food ☺️"
Tasty German style food,We had a light dinner in the evening: the food is good but overproced. The terrace view facing Sentosa island is nice and compensates the price.
Yummy food and drinks,Seamless booking via Chope app. Food are delicious. Recommend to go with at least four pax to share the food. Dining area is warm as there is no aircon.
Great Alfresco Place for Drinks & Relaxation,"Good place to relax and enjoy a glass of beer or wine after a day of shopping! Good selection of beer. The alfresco area is also good for watching the world go by as you sip on your beer, rain or shine! The place can get quite crowded so highly recommend to have a reservation if you're going there during meal times. Service is average as they tended to be quite busy but the location of the place makes it worthwhile."
Heavy lunch,"Six of us had lunch at Brotzeit, a street-front open cafe in Raffles City. We shared an order of Brotzeit Platter with Bavarian Pork Ribs, and an order of Rosti. The meat platter was huge and comprised oven-roasted pork knuckle, different chicken and pork sausages, and honey glazed pork ribs.

The pork knuckle was meaty, tender and flavourful. The sausages were tasty. Although it was our first meal for the day, we could not finish the food and asked to take away the unconsumed food. For big eaters and meat lovers, the platter would be an ideal single order for sharing."
Good food,"Ordered steak, pork knuckle... tasty. We enjoyed the food, only thing is that the beer wasn't that cold. Love to drink beer when it's super cold🤘. Worth visiting and enjoy food with friends."
Nice sidewalk cafe,"We came over from across the street after giving up on the long line for the Long Bar, and had appetizers and beer. Though we didn’t care for the flavor on the French fries, we did enjoy the draft beer, and the nice location in perhaps the city’s best neighborhood."
Excellent Food & Service,Food is authentic just like the ones served in Germany. The Breze is close to the original & service is fast & efficient.
Late Night Supper,"We were in Singapore for the Grand Prix and visited this bar after midnight on the Friday for a drink and a snack. The atmosphere was lively, the beer was good and the snacks (breaded mushrooms, sausage and potato wedges to share) tasty. Menu was limited at that time of night but we enjoyed a pleasant hour."
What a waste of money,"I visited this German themed restaurant because it looked good and there were many there eating the night before. What a mistake!!
The prices were high but we had eaten elsewhere previously and prices were all high, but there are high prices for quality and high prices that are a rip off. My wife and a friend had a salad dish and my friend and I had what looked like a pizza type of meal, one we ordered with ham and the other spinach. They are both square on a biscuit sort of vase that was dry, hard and tasteless. The poor salads were S$10.95 each and the tasteless pizza type meal S$22.00 each. With the beers costing S$19.00 a litre it was a rip off. As well as that there was something some younger people call music that was so loud we could hardly talk. The service was mediocre. We were glad to get out of there.

If you are young, and like oaks of beer they do deals with an all you can drink type deal but we are old so some would blame us, but I certainly would never go there again"
Oktober Festival 2019,"I had a great experience at Brozeit Raffles City. Ann was patient and accommodating towards our family with young children. The food portion was huge and delicious, which we liked!
I was hoping for the Oktober Festival Dance Show I missed in VivoCity last week though."
nice place to chill,nice ambience and good food good place to meet dear one. very good service nice music . i would definitely will come back .
Dinner at Brotzeit,"I reserve a table for 4, indicated the requirement to prefer in-house dining and not alfresco type. Was professionally arranged. Very good services. Got the 2 hrs free flow for 1 pax, eventhough requirement was for the entire table, appreciated this. And thanks for the free vodka :)"
Slow serivce,"We came here for a drink before dinner. The place was quite packed at 5pm. The outdoor environment was relaxing and a good place for people watching.

The service was slow as it took a while for someone to take our order. We ordered a beer from the tap and waited some time for the beer to be served.

The menu had a good selection of beer and German food."
Good food good services,"Food was great and waitresses were very friendly and made recommendations. We had buffet, and some dishes kids only liked the meat patties without the mash n sauce, they were flexible to serve only the patties. This is good as it doesn’t go to waste. Thumb up for great services."
Slooooow service,Popped in for a quick beer at noon on a Friday afternoon and it wasn't a great experience. Took them 15 minutes to find me (I was the only one at the bar) and another 5 minutes for them to find someone who could actually pour the beer. There were only two tables full out of approximately 20 and there were five people milling about - why they couldn't have the one person who was at the bar find the only guy at the bar and pour him a beer is beyond me.
Brunch at Brotzeit,"Good ambience, staff are friendly and attentive. Constantly check on customers on the feedback of food and services needed. Portions of food is good. Dishes are presentable and appetising. Thumb up for food and service."
Hearty food,Bread platter and white asparagus platter were pretty good and substantial. The table was tiny for 4 and several orders of dishes. Tables were laid out too close to others. U pleasant ambiance. Hardly breathing space. Hot and humid; makes diners want to leave as soon eating is done.
Really enjoyed the Spring Menu,Had a lovely lunch from the spring menu of asparagus soup and steak on asparagus - absolutely lovely. The steak was beautifully cooked and rare just as Id asked. I also had a lovely juice called a belly (something - lots of veg!) and a superb riesling. Highly recommended
Terrible service - no straw,Service is terrible. Staff arrogant. Plus they cut cost by not providing straws any more. Of course they come up with some BS on being green. Never again.
Bad service,"Was there with friends for lunch on a Saturday. The lady server, think her name was Nani or something looked irritated while showing us to the table. We did not know how we have offended her or she had woke up from the wrong side of the bed. When we were ready to order, there were only 2 servers at the counter checking their phones. Food was good though to compensate for the servers' poor attitude."
Great German Beer Bar & Restaurant,Extensive menu. Specials on offer. Comfortable searing. Quality food with good atmosphere and helpful staff. Very easy to order too much food due to generous servings. Open till late. Highly recommended.
Brotzeit Service Nightmare,"We visited Brotzeit for Easter to enjoy German food. Since my Wife is pregnant she is not allowed to have raw eggs and needs everything fully cooked. So she asked if a he could have scrambled eggs with her asparagus instead of poached eggs. The waitress refused as the Chef does not want to make it. After I asked for management and to speak to the Chef, they finally agreed to do it but charged my 5 SGD extra. Attitude was unfriendly and service level low. We will not go back to this chain as they clearly do not care about families."
Staff in a daze but good food,"Food is really good and excellent atmosphere. Unfortunately, some of the staff seem to be really tired and in a daze...staring blankly at us when requesting for more water. Could be because it was a terribly hot night."
Terrible service,The service was sucks. We had to sit there and kept signaling for staff for help (to request for ice water) but the female staff just turn us away. Won’t visit this branch again.
Mediocre,"We visited the restaurant on a Mon evening around 6pm. It wasn't overly crowded but there were a few reserved empty tables. Took around 5 mins for them to clear a table and have us seated.

We ordered a sausage platter and a half pint weissbier which was promotional rate at SGD10++. The food and drink came within 20mins.

The taste of the variety of sausages was just ok, nothing really fantastic but wasn't bad either. The meal was around SGD56 incl tax.

Staff was friendly and service was attentive."
akways great place to have a beer,"love this place, outside, watching the crowds pass through, relaxed, service is good for food and beers/wines just a great place to catch up with people"
The worst meal I have had in Singapore,"I titled my review ... the worst meal I hav had in Singapore because when I said that to two different waiting staff they just looked at me and were silence or gave a bit of a laugh.

Seriously how can pork knuckle be so dry and tasteless. The sauerkraut was awful and the potato salad was the best bit. No actually the little bits of green used for decoration were the beast.

Should have known better than to have German food in Singapore .... HomePod glorious food but I was seduced by the wonderful outdoor aspect of the restaurant ... even big trees to look at across the intersection.

The space is lovely - such a shame they made such a disaster of a meal."
Late dinner,"Liked the was open on Sunday night and I could enjoy a late dinner. Food was great, and service fast. There are plenty of options including salads and vegetarian/vegan despite of heavy meat advertising on the boards. German beer was a good fit with cool weather. Like it!"
Food & beer = great! Service = inconsistent,"Great place for late lunch or a dinner while seeing traffic and people passing by.
Their food is very tasty and good portions too! Sausages with condiments or the brotzeit platter is always a winner!
Service is a bit inconsistent though, being a blanket for waving to get attention.
That said, the waitresses and waiters know the menu and know what they serve so they undoubtitly have good training! Service problem could be a logistic issue.

I love coming here to have a really nice platter of solid food and a good beer."
Never disappoint,Keep coming back to this place for good beer and good food. Ambiance is pretty good with more of an outdoor setting.
Great german,"The service is great. We were seated on the high chairs and it was quite nice.
We ordered some French fries, roasted cherry tomatoes, cauliflower salad (not so great but fresh) and a dish with sausage served with sauerkraut with mashed potatoes and spatzli. Wow. So good. All the dishes that were coming out looked so delicious. We will come back"
Best place for beers and German food,"It is a good place to hang out with friends and enjoy beers and German food.

I was there around 2pm in the afternoon, enjoying their beer with my colleagues.

There are many selection in their food menu. The waiters there are busy serving customers.

We have 2tower of beer and a set of pretzel (German bread). It cost us SGD170 in total.

Location is easy to find, it is just walking distance from raffles place mrt station."
Bad service!,"I ordered the food and a basket of bread. When the food came, I asked once again for the bread. I was waiting for 10 minutes when I called the bartender to ask again for the bread. Again I waited few minutes when I asked the 3rd time for that bread. Meanwhile the food got cold and the waitress came and brought that basket of bread. I said I want to make a complain at the manager and she got upset and brought me a questionnaire to rate the service, the quality etc. Obviously no one came and I had to ask the staff for the manager again. Finally he came and said that maybe she forgot to put the order in the first place. Really?! I am leaving this place angry and sure I will not come back here ever."
Still going strong,"After all these years, seems to be more popular than every. Thy hit a nerve, deliver consistent quality, and a great place in a great location to meet friends and have good meal. Cannot go wrong there, perfect combination. The only downside is really that sometimes you don't find a place."
Brunch,"Stopped for brunch before the Grand Prix. Food good, beer excellent. Friendly service. Good value. Worth a visit."
worth a look,"Really nice beers here right near the swissotel and fairmont hotels , so worth checking out if you are nearby"
Bad Warm beer,How can you go to a german themed bar and then get warm tasteless beer. Terrible! When I mentioned it to the waiter I was just snubbed and ignored. Very disappointed!
Love this place,"Brotzeit offers authentic Bavarian/Austrian food and setting - and it does it well - I should know - I am a Bavarian expat in Singapore.
For far too long ‘German’ restaurants projected this stuffy ‘old’ image - since the advent of Brotzeit that all changed: excellent Bavarian beers, menus that make your mouth water.
Once your meal arrives - well presented, high quality meats n sausages, great salads - I am in culinary heaven ( and no - I am not a shareholder - just a very happy customer)
At this outlet, Patrick the Manager and his team are doing an outstanding job !"
Super food and beer... @ super Sing Price$,"Bread is good as are most German type dishes, esp potato salad! Beer, all things German, it's a fest!"
You Must Stop Here,"We have come to this establishment now for several years when we stopover in SIngapore.
Wouldn't go to Singapore without coming here at least once. Often we call in 2 or 3 times.
Perfect spot to leave your husband while you have an hour or two shopping ;-)
My husband loves their beers & we both so enjoy their food. Esp the traditional German sausage meals.
Staff are friendly and location is great just to sit and watch the world go by.
Wifi available also."
"The right place for a quick, tasty bite!","Just across the Carlton Hotel, Brotzeit offers an interesting variety of sumptuous, delicious meals, complimented by a number of German draft beers! It's an 'easy' place with friendly service."
Good beer and yummy food,Best Pork knuckle in Singapore. Sooo Good. Beers are good. They have wine in the menu but No Whiskey 🥃🧐. Will come again for pork sausage and pork knuckle.
Good food and nice service,The food was good and the portion was ok size. The service was good and allowed adjustments to the dishes.
"Great location, Value for money Brunch","The German Bar is facing a crossroads, opposite Chijmes & Raffles Hotel. Despite the open space, it is fairly cooling with the multiples fans & Aircon provided. It is also good place to people watch & spending an afternoon with friends/ family.

We had brunch which is only available on weekends & Public Holiday 10am-3pm for S$38 per pax free flow of food. Food was great with plenty of selection for vegetarian!"
Touristy spot,"We have been twice to this place and two totally different experiences. Bother times restaurant was really busy. First time food was good. Service a but slow but ok. The second time was pure disaster. Server repeated our order, which was correct, and was served something else. Then the server said we lied and gave us a hard time to return the food and five us whwmat we ordered. She got such an attitude and was completely unprofessional nto the point MGMT had to get involved and switched servers for us. And they still tried to charge us. We seriously couldn't believe it. We travel a lot around the world and this was by far the first and worst experience we've had.
Otherwise a prime spot to catch tourists with it's location"
excellent place to have drinks/dinner/lunch,"great place to come, outdoors, chilled, good food, great atmosphere, good beers and wines at good prices, good for clients and friends always reliable in food and drinks quality and service is good too"
Great location,"A little pricey with I ordered pick knuckle and one 0.3L beer which total cost me around $60 SGD. The location is really good and just right outside of Raffles City mall.

The place has happy hour and I suggest for a good hangout with friends.

Big group of people is also suggested but please reserve the table."
Great beer and food - large portion so you may need to share !,"A great night at Brotzeits, the guys ordered the biggest beers and only needed the one all night, they really enjoyed it. It was a busy place with good service and a fun atmosphere.
The food was great I ordered chicken which had half roasted and some fried in breadcrumbs on a platter. I was sharing with my friend, it was a massive portion and 2 of us couldn’t finish it. My hubby had the pork knuckle with lovely crackling, he loved it , again it was a huge portion and he couldn’t finish it. Given our experience I would suggest sharing the meat dishes."
