Disappointed,Despite the website saying open until 1.00 am Wednesday to Friday and having a specific supper menu from 10.00-11.30pm when arrived at 10.30pm were told it was only serving drinks
"Great service by Syahrul, thank you!","The food was delicious, accompanied by a gorgeous view. Most importantly, thoughtful and great service by Syahrul who made everything smooth for our group of 18.

Great Views,"Great service - staff is always great. Although the food is nothing to get super excited about, the service is quick, the views are super, and the DJ on the weekends play perfect music."
"First Time, Last Time","Was a patron on Saturday, (22nd) Seated outdoors.

Was eager to introduce Overeasy to my foreign friends in town as they've seen some content on social media. Turns out to be an extremely disappointing experience.

We were not informed that we need to wait for 50min to an hour for the beer can chicken we ordered. We only found out about it when we enquired why is it taking so long as we are almost done with everything else. When I checked with your crew how long more do we have to wait for it, he merely repeated the same sentence, ""You need to wait for 50mins to an hour for this Sir"". Why are we expected to know about the waiting time?

We requested for additional dressing, one of your female crew said she'll come back with it but never did. Nobody bothered to top up our prosecco as well, even when I stood up and pour for my friends, your crew who was standing right in front of us, just turned a blind eye. What kind of service is this?

Yes, you do have a nice view of MBS etc but with the mediocre food and such service. I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone."
First time and incredible food,"We needed somewhere to eat and walked past the restaurant the night before. It looked great with an awesome view so I found it online and booked for our final night.

I briefly checked the menu prior and it looked good. We arrived and got seated, sadly no one came over till we asked even though one server clearly saw us.

She eventually came over and we ordered drinks. We had to ask another server for water although other tables looked like it was there automatically.

We ordered a Prosecco, a Singapore Sling, Truffle Burger for me and the Ribs for my wife. The drinks were great but the food excellent!

My Truffle Burger was incredible! My wife loved her ribs!

The view of Marina Bay Sands, the atmosphere and the food make this a lovely place to eat and we would definitely recommend.

We asked for the bill and was told to go to the bar, I joked with the lady that perhaps the bank needs to give you wireless credit card machines as it seemed strange that there was only one inside.

Overall we loved it, we will come back!"
Anniversary Dinner.,"Dined in for anniversary and the food was amazing. Staff were all attentive and place is clean. Toilet is IG-material.

Corn dogs are to die for and the a√ßai bowl dessert was a good closer."
Bad experience for unfriendly staff,"I make a reservation on 17 July for celebrating birthday, and when my friend bring birthday cake come and ask for keep inside fridge, one of a staff using unfriendly tone to told her no place can put the cake because the fridge is full. This is the first time I hear restaurant no place can put a small cake. And I understand the dine in time is only 1.5 hours, but the staff there is very impatient to clean the plates , without asking our permission, they don‚Äôt care we still want to eat or not, and I hvn‚Äôt finish my drink , the staff just took away for my mojito. This kind of attitude is very rude and unacceptable, make us very uncomfortable. It was a bad experience for me and my friends, is really destroy my mood on that day. I think I wouldn‚Äôt go for this place anymore and won‚Äôt recommend for my friends. We feel disappointed for this restaurant."
Average,"Starting today at sunset I had a reservation, and the staff greeted me well, the waiter was always present, but since I was a tabletop, I wished that my height was in a good location and there was an empty table, but the waitress did not hear us to sit on it knowing that we had requested but When two passersby came, I allowed them, the food was good but not excellent, the location of the restaurant is excellent, it is preferable that the menu be varied, especially that American food does not depend on burgers only, if you want to sell only burgers, you must be creative in it, the beautiful simple is To be asked, he ordered a mushroom burger and my wife ordered a chicken burger and it was my first visit but I don't think I'll repeat the ball unlike jypsy restaurant"
"Good food, unfriendly restaurant staff",Food and drink was good but theres a staff named Alicia was not friendly and rude during payment time. Disappointed with her actions after a happy dinner.
I may go to PS cafe as they are always have good food and great service.,"We had made reservations online for it was my wife's birthday. I was asked to approve S$100 of no show by my cr.card. However the restaurant didn't greet my wife on her birthday. it was a warm day and we were asked to sir inside,instead of the excellent view of MBS outside. There is no provision to sit outside,OverEasy is wasting a great opportunity. The Strawberry and Basil jug was excellent,chocolate milk shake and lemonade was average. The other food we ordered was pretty average except for the chicken burger. The two fish and chips were oily and full of batter. The avacado taste wasnt packed with flavor.Maybe the chef was away that day.on service, i give credit to the staff who were very attentive."
Enjoyable dining experience!,Alicia who took our order was pregnant and was very patient with us :) Gary was attentive and surprised us with a bday cake for my friend. Thank you so much for the good service! We were seated near the entrance and was afraid of the hotness but it was still cooling because of the fan. Fantastic experience!
terrible experience and food was stale. Food poisoning,"Avoid this restaurant at all costs. ordered OE Fries with truffle mayo, Chilli dog (was far far far from authentic) and Buffalo wings. Food was mediocre at best and the buffalo wings which was stale and had a massive and painful food poisoning after (was the only one on the table to eat the wings)

Needs a massive revamp and a good look at the food quality otherwise dont see this restaurant surviving."
Terrible service and rules,"They stopped serving us at 8:45 and we had to leave to get food elsewhere, despite having a table booked from 8. How can this restaurant be profitable?"
NICE VIEW and GOOD EXPERIENCE,They gave us a table with a good view of the MBS. (Loved it!) The staff were also attentive to our needs. They are also kind e enough to take our photos. The food is good as well. Hope they‚Äôll have more pasta options on their menu though. Although the burger is good.
"Great location and vibe , poor service","It‚Äôs a lovely location and great vibe that the place has , but for us that‚Äôs where it ended ‚Ä¶ our drinks were quite bad , we didn‚Äôt proceed to the food since the menu wasn‚Äôt very kids friendly ‚Ä¶. What really got to me was that when we asked for the cheque the waitress refused to take cash and insisted on a card ‚Ä¶ as a tourist carrying cash, we can‚Äôt be using cards on top of it ‚Ä¶ it would help if the restaurant specifies (and highlights) their accepted modes of payment on the menu, it would also help if the waiting staff informs guests about the no cash policy whilst taking the order itself .."
Father‚Äôs Day at OverEasy,"Scenery is great. Basically can see the entire stretch of The floating platform, Marina Bay Sands to Fullerton hotel. Food and drinks are great too! üëçüèª"
stunning views but they whisk you out after 90 minutes and staff don't smile,"Overall excellent if efficient rather than smiling service and the views are stunning of course, All my fellow customers spent their alloted 90 minutes merely taking photos whereas my friend and I were there to chat, chill and relax and take in the view.

The big sofa seats are designed for little people as I couldn't squeeze my legs under the table it was so compact.

The jugs of cocktails were a great way to share drinks.

But after 90 minutes they told us we had to leave as there was another reservation and it didn't seem to matter how much I spent which was bizarre! So they'd rather turn the table than get more $ out of an existing customer, rather shortsighted and I noticed that they did it to all the tables next to us too.

Clearly this is a place come for photos and that's it....

The service staff could do with smiling too...you might not like working there but you're supposed to be there for the customer not you......we're paying your wages!"
Highly recommended,"- friendly and kind staff, tried their best to help us extend the dining period
- delicious food and Instagram able drinks/cocktails
- nice view, you are able to take the view of MBS/ light show"
Great ambience; mediocre food,"The food is average and over priced, so were the drinks. They just tasted odd! The view was amazing but they should provide more fans for the climate. It was just too hot."
Awesome experience as always,"I have visited OverEasy many times in the past and this time too, the food, drinks and the ambience - everything was delightful as it was in the past"
"Nice ambience, friendly staff",Very nice alfresco dining experience overlooking mbs area. Food & drinks are served very quickly. However music is a little too loud which makes chatting quite difficult.
Will return,Good honest US diner style food. Service was excellent. The location is great. We had a most pleasant weekend lunch.
"Great view, disappointing service",What a great location for a birthday lunch with friends! We wanted to love our experience here. The view of MBS is stunning and the food was very tasty. But the poor service really did put a damper on the overall experience. I was thinking to come back with my family but I think we'll try one of the many other One Fullerton restaurants first to see if the service is better.
Booked a table at 730pm but table wasn‚Äôt ready till 745pm,"I booked a table for 730pm. Reached at 715pm, they told me Table wasn‚Äôt ready. I went back at 730pm, yet the table wasn‚Äôt ready. I was only seated at 745pm.

Find it absurd to have a reservation system yet the table can‚Äôt be ready on time."
Disappointing,"The food quality has dropped drastically. The ribs were dry & tough, the fish & chips was tasteless."
excellent,"On 4th of May I was visiting here for my friend‚Äôs birthday.I was planned to give my friend a surprise with a birthday cake . In that time one your male staff are holding the cake came from behind my friend which the birthday girl. However another male staff was suddenly place the plates before the cake arrived on our table,it really broke our surprise . Hope that your team will take note on this and really stand on customer view to serve every customer.By the way overall service is excellent!"
"Awesome food, awesome ambience!","The staff was very friendly and the food was good, alongside with the relaxing and nice ambience! Thankful ;)"
Great ambience,"We ordered burger, mac cheese and baby back ribs.
My husband & I didn‚Äôt like the baby back sauce but my children liked it. The view was amazing, the staffs were kind."
"Good food, terrible service","I had been looking forward to dining at OverEasy, as the location and view are spectacular. I had made a booking days in advance to make sure I would be well accommodated on the chosen date. However, my experience ended up being ruined because of poor customer service before and after arriving. Before because of not answering any calls that I made or messages that I had sent. After, for being badly received, unwilling to change the table I was assigned to - when there was no one else sitting at the other one (although I was willing to pay more). Spilling water all over the table and over us (which happens) but without apologising or bringing napkins to clean the mess up. By picking plates off the table without asking if we were done (which I wasn‚Äôt!). The food was ok but the overall experience was unfortunate. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend."
Dinner at OverEasy,The food was better than expected. We liked the burgers and the pork ribs. Service is good as the staffs were attentive.
"Burger is good, staff are helpful.","First time to visit Singapore. Recommended to this restaurant with a nice MBS view. Staff were helpful to recommend food and drinks. Prefer a menu with pictures. Burger and milkshake were good, appetizers were alright. Would love to visit again."
Great waygu burger with a glass of sauvignon blanc,"The waygu burger with the grilled salad in the set meal is really worth it and yum and on a weekday lunch when it is not so crowded, it is really lovely to peer out to the waters with the towering MBS in the backdrop. Great customer service by the few guys who served us last week. A lovely way to enjoy the burger with a glass of sauvignon blanc:)

Cheers
Caroline"
"Food was good,","Good: Great view at the waterfront/ alfresco seats facing MBS. Food quality (beer can chicken was worth the wait).
Poor: rigid dining time limit. service attitude.

Booked a waterfront/ alfresco table and we ordered cocktails and small plates, and the gathering was going well until we tried to place order for main course. That's when we were told that the waiting time for our main would exceed the table time of 1 hour. Server was reluctant to take our order until we agreed to vacate the table (even before time was up) and move into the ""walk-in"" table.

It's a weekend, there's a crowd, understandably the service crew must have been really busy but really, if we can be nice about the long wait for ice water, they can also try to be nice.

Suggest to go for just drinks and snacks given the short time limit for dining.
We're probably not going back again anytime soon..."
"Great view, good place to chill","love the milk shake and prawn linguine. but a few cocktails we tried were just ok.
Great views especially if you get the seat at the outdoor sofa.

However, due to 1.5hr limit, guests are made to wait at the tables along the public corridor.
There's this host who will help to arrange/get tables..(very friendly and helpful). so if need any help, go for the ""host"" instead of servers.

(minus) was understaffed to maintain the toilet."
"Overpriced for the food, just right for the ambience","Burgers were mediocre, Mcdonald‚Äôs standard. Lighting made staff members difficult to spot diners when their hands are up. Ambience and view outside was worth it."
Review,Food is too salty. And the chicken does not worth the amt to pay for. The rest was good. Especially we love the sides. Fish and chips and ribs were good. Drinks were thirst quenching. It‚Äôs nice. We had a lot of drinks and beers becos the food is way too salty. A lot msg. Thirst the whole night
"Services , ambience and food","We love their services, very attentive and polite . on 8 April 2022 we were there celebrating my Aunt's birthday. They noted my reservation and gave us a table with a beautiful view. thank you for creating a beautiful celebration for her."
Good food at good price points!,"The thick milkshakes were delicious !
The vegan pancakes were not bad but the menu did not state that there was cheese in between the pancake layers."
"Great ambience, great food & drinks","The outdoor ambience is amazing. Staff was friendly and very accommodating. Food was well priced and tasty, no complaints there. Good variety of drinks."
Horrible service - Good food & ambiance,"Good food & ambiance ruined by terrible service. We had booked table well in advance specifically calling out the alfresco table. Later the manager refused to give the table citing only VIP Customer are allowed to book it! They could have declined the booking mentioning no tables are open.

Hope the owners see this and take necessary action."
Great ambience and good food,"Had an amazing dinner with great food and good view. On top of that, service was great even during the peak hours and would like to thank Gelyn and the team took good care of us throughout the night! Cheers!"
Services is very terrible,Visit for birthday celebration. The services is no good. Food is just normal. The only best things is atmosphere. Dissatisfied at all.
Dining area inside the resto is hot,There are spots inside the resto is warm and we are sweating.. Hope the mngt can do something about this..
Bad service,Very bad attitude from Alicia. We asked her to take a photo of us but she didnt reply us and just took my phone. After that she just rudely passed my phone to her colleague instead and didnt say anything to us at all.
Nice food and good get together place!,"Nice dinning and get together places with nice MBS view, there are MBS lights show at 8pm. Serves with variety of delicious food and beverages, staffs are friendly."
Bad service,"booking for outdoor seating for birthday celebrations , move in due to raining, after that request move out, your staff reject my request, such a bad experience"
Disappointed,"I went for the signature grilled cheese and soup but was told they don‚Äôt have it, considering it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsignature‚Äù dish and quite a simple meal I don‚Äôt know why they didn‚Äôt have it. I got the brocoli and avo salad instead. It pretty much was a cold bowl of brocoli with maybe a teaspoon of quinoa‚Ä¶. Not good!!!!! Waitress was not very helpful or attentive. Only spoke to us to take order. Only good thing was the location."
"Good food, busy restaurant","The hamburgers we had was very good, excellent!! But service can be improved, seems they were too busy. We had to do some 're-orders' to get what we originally ordered."
Great place for end of day drinks with colleagues,"We went one Thursday evening and were served by Ella. She was polite, friendly and very responsive. The drinks and bar snacks were great and the outdoor lounge seating were clean, comfortable and had a good view of Marina Bay."
Splendid,"Had a great dinning experience, good food with reasonable pricing. I think the only room for improvement would be the buffalo wings was on the salty side."
Always an enjoyable experience!,"This is a regular place my son and I go to for burgers! Food is great with generous portions, spectacular view with a nice breeze and the staff are always friendly and even remember us and call us by our names which is nice."
Poor food quality and service,"The food was not very good quality and was overpriced. Ordered truffle medium cooked beef burger, and it was overcooked (tasted like minced pork) super dry. Lobster spaghetti was too oily. Moreover,it was a busy night I get it, but worst service I have ever experienced. Go ANYWHERE else."
Reasonable prices and good service,The HH offer on booze is very inviting. Food is decent and reasonably priced. The booking time slot is a bit odd with little flexibility. 530 pm is too early for many office goers. there should be a slot at 630pm too
Disappointed that the Tomahwak and Lobster was not sold out,"Hi Overeasy person in charge,

I had a family dinner on Xmas eve and it was our 1st dining experience at Overeasy.

We were appalled and disappointed that the Tomahawk and Lobster was sold out the moment we asked one of your staff. Prior to booking this place, I had an email liaison regarding the preference of our seats and even requested to look at pictures for the Tomahawk and Lobster but I was not told that Overeasy deliver this as well.

Considering our booking time at 5.30pm, it was early for dinner and we were shocked when we were told that they were sold out. Overeasy only opens at 5pm and we were puzzled as to why was it sold out. We eventually knew that it was because of overwhelming delivery orders. We were anticipating to try this as it is on your annual festive menu only and we were all disappointed.

Perhaps you can look into allocating a fair quantity to delivery (eg. 200 orders) and dine-in (eg. 200 orders) customers or perhaps you can increase the order more knowing that it is a festive period. I think having this allocation system is fairer to both customers as we are both paying the same price.

Looks like we have to return next year to try this :( Hopefully, it will not be sold out again.

But overall, the lobster linguine we had was good and we love the beef burger, back ribs and sweet potato fries. Not forgetting the melon cocktails too :)

Thanks!

Kind Regards,
Michelle Sim"
Birthday celebration at OVEREASY,"BEER CAN CHICKEN best to order in advance upon reservation. Simply breathe-taking for a photoshoot and savoury taste. Sweet potato fries is a good starter since it's a mixture of sweet and salty flavour. When BCC was served, it came with another type of so but that ""honey version"" too sweet for my tastebud. Overall, worth to visit again"
Overrated than Overeasy,Service crew were cold and unwelcoming. Food was average. Happy hour offer and the views of the Bay were the only good experience I brought home.
Amazing,"The food was really great and amazing. And we enjoyed the outdoor atmosphere, especially when the sky turns dark and we see the lights around."
Friday night,"I have been here many times
Food and drinks were good as per usual
However the staff are not as attentive as before and like purposely ignore you when you try to ask/order something
Billing out took so long but staff didnt even apologise for the wait she even was very grumpy on us.
Good food but bad experience sigh"
Love the ambience and service.,Celebrated me and friend‚Äôs bday on a busy Sunday. Love the ambience and not to mention the amazing view. Baby back ribs are slightly overcooked but still good and I would never get tired of the sauce. Truffle Mac and cheese was superb. Didn't expect a complimentary dessert cause I don‚Äôt recall telling them is our bday. Thank you for the service and thank you Phylicia! (I hope I didn‚Äôt get the spelling wrong)
Love,"Isn‚Äôt our first time and that‚Äôs explains why! ‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôm glad he chose overeasy for his birthday dinner, we enjoyed the food as much as the atmosphere and probably the best seat! Thank you very much indeed."
Great Dinner with Amazing View,"Staffs were extremely friendly and with a magnificent view of the Marina Bay, having a great meal here left a great impression for myself"
Nice evening dinner.,"Had a quick meal with a friend, and had a great time despite the bad weather. Service was prompt and the staff were extremely friendly. I absolutely loved the truffle burger; easily the highlight of my day. The BBQ ribs my friend had was a bit too tough but overall we enjoyed our experience. Donut Holes was surprisingly nice despite the weird presentation. Hope I'll be able to go back and sample some of the other dishes with my family soon!"
Used to be better & may not return :(,"Initially the service was alright but not sure why it started to deteriorate over time as the night progressed past 9.30pm. We had to wait 30mins for an oreo milkshake when most customers have already left the restaurant. Worse was when I asked the waitress to check our order, she snared at me as if I there was something wrong to check our order/ :(
Really it was much much better the first time I came but what happened?
I came back hoping to have a good time but I am Quite disappointed and I may not come back again."
Superb Meal!,"Went for a lunch date with my friend on 19 Oct. The Linguine with Prawns are delicious! Prawns are really fresh and the pasta is cooked to al dente! Special shout-out to Philicia, the waitress who waited our table. She has a bubbly personality and made us felt at home!"
Great service üòá,Philicia and the rest of service staffs are very attentive and friendly. Philicia even offered to introduce the different set menus that they have. Overall the food and the experience is good
Great food but portions too small,"The food was good and I already knew the prices but what surprised me was the portions were really tiny. I'm not a big eater but when I pay $28 for the Truffle Burger and still find myself still hungry even after dessert (Hot Fudge Doughnuts), something doesn't add up. I felt like I had ordered the kids meal.

The lighting is too dark inside the restaurant. I had difficult seeing what I was eating. Impossible to take photos.

Service was excellent."
Great tasty food and lovely service,Wonderful food as always. The lobster Mac n cheese is a firm favourite of ours. The staff were friendly and attentive. Always a pleasure!
Great ambience,"We were given a table right at the edge with direct view of MBS. The night scene was so beautiful. Service staff were very helpful and polite. They took initiatives to help take family photos etc. We have nothing to comment on food quality, it is slightly above our expectation. A very chill and relaxing for the family."
Not as amazing as expected,"It was always fully booked before fully vaccinated rules rolled out. First time trying the restaurant but nothing surprised me, food was normal and cosy. if outdoor section was opened, I think it will be better at least we got some view while having our food."
Birthday Lunch,Booked to celebrate my birthday with friends on Sunday 12 Sept from 1230pm to 330pm. Another friend & I were down with diarrhea & bad tummy ache for rest of the day.. Thank God we recovered by Monday afternoon. I tried to call the restaurant to let them know but unable to get thru . Always been my favourite place to go but not sure if I will visit again .
Decent place,"Nice place, but no noise cancellation, so you could hear everyone clearly and it was getting too loud, even the bartender mixing drinks could be heard very clearly.
The service was good by the girls, but the main in-charge did not seem a customer friendly person."
Seating issues because of covid,"We were assigned 2 sofa seats which was difficult to accomodate 5 people. We requested to get an additional chair on the side but we were refused because of covid situation. I would like to bring this to the restaurant's attention. Two sofa seats and the table is good for 4 people, definitely not for 5."
"Food quality and standard is always top notch, minus one surprising change","We always love the American-diner style food at Overeasy. It was also very kid-friendly and accommodating with our young child. I was just a bit surprised that water is suddenly chargeable and that the small bottles are $5 after the first complimentary one (which shared amongst 4 adults, did not go very far). Given that tap water is drinkable in Singapore, I don't really understand this."
you get what you pay for!,"food is a bit pricey but delicious! we had the hangover and avocado toast off the weekend brunch menu, mac n cheese and corn dogs off the sides menu, an oreo shake and a strawberry shake. a wonderful meal!"
"Great location, passable food","Outdoor atmosphere was great, with a view of MBS and CBD. Cocktails were quite good, and definitely light enough for those who don't drink much. Food portions generally not too big and were generally of passable quality. BBQ ribs were tough and tasted average, and the Mac and cheese was alright. Come here for the views and drinks, but probably not the food."
"Average, would not recommend.","We could only have our table for 2 hours; after that, we had to vacate if anyone else had made a reservation (luckily no one did, so we could stay). Restaurant was loud and noisy even without piped music. Service was good, but nothing to crow about. This was my second visit. On my first visit during a weekday afternoon, the restaurant was not even half full but my husband and I were denied a booth -- I had made a reservation for this -- yet, walk-ins were immediately shown to the available booths when they arrived after us. For this reason, I do not recommend this restaurant."
Overeasy Dinner,Staff were friendly and helpful. Food was satisfactory! Would definitely be back again to try the other signatures on the menu!
"Nice view, good food",Was able to reserve outdoor seat with a good view upon request. Food was bit pricy but reasonable considering the view. Service was bit slow during the peak hour
Excellent!,"Alfresco facing the bay. Everything was wonderful. Cocktails, food, service were all superb! Will be back regularly for sure!"
great!,"great food and ambience, just abit hot outside even with fan. Tried lobster Mac n cheese and truffle burger and they taste goood"
Subpar service. Average food. Not worth the pain.,"Terrible service. Average food. We used to visit this restaurant and loved the food and found the service good. This evening we were in the area and thought we should support one of our favorite restaurants as we adapt to the ‚Äònew normal‚Äô but a misunderstanding between us and the service staff resulted in an awful experience for me. No, I am not expecting an apology, it was an misunderstanding but the staff made us felt awkward. And when my mojito came, it tasted like ice water, hardly any rum. Yes, it was the worst mojito I have ever had. And no, I was not expecting extraordinary service but as a former customer service manager, to me the absence of ‚Äòthank you‚Äô and eye contact as we paid the bill and walked out showed was very telling and rude. I am all for hiring locals and teenagers but the service is expectedly subpar. The young waitress who served us was tactless and borderline insulting. The dinner for two costed us more than $100, for that price range a certain level of service is expected but this restaurant falls way below that expectation. In my opinion, since there are many other restaurants nearby offering the same fare with much better service, I would suggest spending your money there instead."
Many repeated trips,"Have been my many repeated trips there, accompanies by fantastic views and food (Broccoli salad, F&C all-time fav)"
UNHAPPY Customer,"There was no mention about minimum order when I booked a table on their website. When we went there, we were told that there is a 50sgd minimum, it was surprising but OK coz we expect to bill more than that. However, when we're about to pay, we were told again that it was 50sgd/person! it was embarrassing as we are about to leave the place, however we were forced to order again just to reach their minimum order! The dinner became an embarrassing and a very unhappy occasion. WE WILL DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AGAIN!"
Al Fresco dining with a fantastic view!,Our family had a fun Friday Night out at OverEasy! My kids love the burgers & the sliders. While I like the Grilled Cheese sandwich & Chicken Buffalo Wings! We enjoyed the Al Fresco dining with the superb view of the Marina Bay. üëç
Amazing Experience,Overell experience was awesome! They even gave me a slice of cake as a birthday treat! Thank you Over Easy Staff!
"Neither food not the service were acceptable. They even did not ask why we haven‚Äôt eat the food at all, just asked toPAY","Neither food not the service were acceptable. They even did not ask why we haven‚Äôt eat the food at all, just asked toPAY"
"Great food, excellent service","You've got to try it to know it! Was concerned that it would just be another overhyped restaurant. Went to celebrate sister's bday cos my nephew wanted to try something different. The food was great! Service was excellent. And though we were too full for desserts, server offered a complimentary waffle to end off our celebration."
"Great food, service staff needs to be improved","Went there for mother's day and was extremely excited for our meal. Started when the waitress came to take our orders (she had bangs), she spoke with a rude tone and was overall, unfriendly. While clearing the table, another waitress dropped the knife on my father's pants staining it and walked away without offering any serviettes to clean up the mess.

Finally, the first waitress constantly spoke to us with an attitude and even after we finished eating, she kept rushing us and the moment i finished eating, she told me to put my mask on in an impolite manner despite me still finishing up my drink.

As a service staff, especially on a special occasion like mother's day, she should be considerate and realise that we do not owe her anything as customers. The food was great, but really there should be more training/vetting on the staff that you hire. It really creates the image on Overeasy and am really disappointed in the entire experience."
Good food but bad side effects,"It was a good visit, the view was great, the service was prompt.
The food was also good (sweet potatoes was yummy). However, I was down with food poisoning a few hours later. Could not breathe properly within a few hours and vomited that night and having diarrhea and fever since Sunday, 2 May (today is Tuesday). I had the hangover burger. I ordered medium rare... guess I should have ordered medium? Maybe the experience would have been better...? Lost close to 3 kgs so far... aish... oh, the milk shake was awesome and the waitstaff was attentive."
Awesome Party with Friends,"We had gathering at Overeasy with friends on a busy Friday night. We were pleasantly delighted that the staff had arranged fabulous seats facing MBS for us. The view was fantastic and the staffs were so helpful in recommending the food and drinks, and also taking several photos for us. Highly recommend the Mac and cheese, topped with mushrooms and truffles ($18) 1 for 1 beer is also a good deal but it ends at 8pm. Will certainly be back again! Thank you~"
Good vibes,"Good vibes, we went there for drinks. But my friend got this Kyoho Cocktail and it was too diluted, she didn‚Äôt like it that much lol. That said, the vibes and service were superb which made up for the diluted cocktail."
Amazing food and impeccable service,"Went on a dinner date at Overeasy, One Fullerton on last Friday evening, the place was really crowded but we got seated quickly and food were served within 15 minutes after we ordered. Love the American diner design and warm lights, which also enhance the dining experience and ambience. Would definitely recommend my friends to try!"
Overeasy over looking the Marina Bay,Great experience at Overeasy. Was given a window seat with a great view as it was a birthday celebration. Staff was really nice to cater to our request.
Depends on what u r looking at,"Cocktails and Beer during Happy Hours are affordable. Cocktail is a bit tasteless unfortunately. Food tasted average. Choices of add on of truffle mayo and change to potato fries can be a put off, all chargeable. The outdoor table that we had was not ideal. A green box blocking the nice river view and back facing the view. One of the plus point is that Service staff did take initiative to put in extra napkins and clear plates and check on us from time to time."
Overeasy,"Food was delicious, portions were moderate sized. Service staff were all very prompt and pleasant to my children."
Not-so-great food at a high price,"The truffle burger lacked the juiciness you would expect in a beef burger, and the buttermilk fried chicken burger was rather plain. Both were coupled with a side of soggy and slightly stale fries. Even though they were generous with the portion, the prawn linguine could have been more flavorful."
Great atmosphere poor service,"Lovely restaurant location. Raj the manager was welcoming. thanks Raj. The waiters forgot part of the order and that came after the meal was finished. Most of the food was good, except the Broccoli and Avacado salad, though the Quinoa and Feta needed to be balanced. The Ceaser salad with Shrimp was frankly not good."
Horrible Experience,"Food and drinks were great. However, the service leaves much to be desired.

Pros:
1. We were promptly seated outdoors upon our request despite not having reservations.
2. Food and drinks were served promptly.
3. Staff were generally polite.
4. Great views

Cons:
1. We were seated beside a shrub and dealt with ants half the time. Though I ignored it since we wanted the outdoor seating.
2. Acquaintances of staff threw water from the table behind us towards the shrub. The staff apologized but the water kept coming. My partner had to shift her handbag as it was getting wet. Despite the ambience, I was reminded of a wet market.
3. We were not done with our food close to closing time (we were reminded that they were closing soon, so my bad) but a male staff straight up grabbed our plates 7 minutes before stated time. The least they done is to inform us politely before taking it away, or even offer a takeaway and I would've paid extra for that. Unfortunately, nope, all that was uttered was ""Time"". I mean I'm sure I paid my fair share for the food.

Overall, I had a good first impression but by the end of it, my experience spoke for itself."
Picturesque view!,"Spotted this plc after a bday dinner at PS and make reservations for pre ChristmAs gathering with gfs. Had a nice patio seat with a great view and a gd list of drinks n food to go along w such a view. Loved this place, had a great catch up and will definitely come again soon.

Ps: do make your own reservations early to avoid disappointment cos this plc is Always fully booked on wknds!"
"Good Burgers, service could be improved","Had ordered the To Die For and Truffle and as usual the standard was there. I wish I could say the same for my Philly sliders, but it was terribly late (possible missed order) and was not up to what I had expected as the meat was dry. Possible suggestion would be to check if all orders have arrived, as no one had noticed my missed order until I asked the waiter to follow up."
