Surprisingly bad,"With end of year, i decided to treat the family to a truffle dinner at Casa Tartufo. After much debate we settled on scallops with parmigiana and fresh truffles as a starter, porcini mushroom soup with truffles, and tajarin pasta with truffles (signature dish) and ravioli with parmigiana, and truffles. The service was excellent but the cooking was a disappointment. The scallops were overcooked and chewy ($45). The mushroom soup surely could not go wrong but how surprised I was to find it bland and tasteless ($30). I can get a better one from a can. Luckily the tajarin ($60) and ravioli ($65) saved the dinner from a complete disaster. The wines were significantly overpriced with a glass of chianti at $30 per glass.
With 3 glasses of prosecco and a glass of chianti, dinner for 3 (no main courses) came up to $545.
Never again! so be warned the cost far outweighs the quality of the food. You would be better off going elsewhere"
Kinda Sad They Are Closing,"We were looking forward to dining here as it has been a while since the last visit, primarily due to Covid restrictions. There was a slight hiccup with finding our reservation but that was quickly resolved.

We loved the starter of burratina, which was creamy and the salad was fresh, not overly oily and nicely balanced. The bread was average though, surprisingly, and we each had one slice only.

We added the $25 premium for the truffle pasta - I remember it was $12-$15 when we first started to visit. The pasta was tasty, and the truffle taste was not overpowering. The bolognese penne was not as good, and the pasta was a tad undercooked and hard. The meat sauce was generous, but could have ‘matured’ a little and been more robust.

Desserts were fine, and we enjoyed the truffle ice cream, and the chocolate tart, with its slightly bitter richness, which means good chocolate was used.

The lunch sets include still or sparkling water, as well as coffee or tea. Portions were on the generous side, and service was warm and efficient, with staff greeting regular patrons and topping up water frequently. Kinda sad that they are closing at the end of the month, but interested to see their future projects."
Disappointing (but with a lot of potential),"I was very much looking forward to my luncheon at Casa Tartufo.

I tried the following dishes:
Burrata with Black Truffle
Rib Eye Steak (pictured) with Truffle Fries
Lemon Tart (pictured) and
Tiramisu

Ambience: Simple and tastefully done. Service was attentive and friendly.

The burrata portion is truly sharing portion, and probably appropriate for 3 people digging in. The flavour was good, but the texture was a little firmer then I would have liked / expected. 2 of us ate the burrata, and a little less than half was left. We asked for it to be packed for takeaway; and our server politely agreed. However when we left, they forgot to bring it out; and we also realized after we were in taxi. The fact they didn’t bring it out, was disappointing.

The steak was well cooked, excellent flavour and the truffle fries were crunchy. No complaints here.

Lemon tart: Hands down the worst lemon tart I’ve ever had. All 3 of us tried the dish, and all three simultaneously had to spit it out. It tasted like raw and bad egg with a hint of lemon. I’ve tried lemon tarts all over the world.... this is not how it should taste! The server took it back to the kitchen and came back and said the Chef said it was fine. That was really shocking, and makes me question the chef’s tastebuds (for this dish atleast). All the good flavour build up over the course of the meal was u done by this dish. You could also tell that the crust also was not fresh. The server trying to defend this dish is enough for me to not return or recommend this restaurant. Had his approach been different and apologetic; my opinion would have been more open minded that it was a one off bad dish.

The Tiramisu that we had instead as a replacement was outstanding. It’s amongst the lightest I’ve had in a while.

One final gripe... their cloth napkins left tens of lint spots all over the trousers of all 3 of us.

The steak and tiramisu were stand out dishes; but I’d be had pressed to find myself going back here for a long while."
Great food,Food was excellent. Atmosphere was wonderful. Staff was friendly. The Jr chef is a plus point! One side note. The food are not cheap.
Absolutely loved it!,"One of the best services we have ever received in any restaurants.

Awesome service

Place is so cozy and nicely done. Great taste!

My husband and I shared a mushroom soup and the angel hair pasta with uni caviar scallop.

Superb!!

Will definitely return for more!"
Casa Tartufo has just moved and is still as good as ever,"Casa Tartufo has just moved to Mohamed Sultan. It's an intimate and less old world space yet the owners have maintained the charm of it previous incarnations. This is a comfy, homey, chic trattoria that serves delicious food and, as you'd imagine, specializes in truffles. The signature Tajarin egg noodles with fresh truffles is always amazing and is still as good as ever. We also had yummy scrambled eggs with truffles, a satisfying carpaccio, and veal tortellini with porcini mushroom cream sauce. I could eat the tortellini every day (but then I wouldn't be able fit through the door of the restaurant ). Also had kurobuta pork chop with sunny side up egg and truffles and a lively seabass. And, of course, truffle fries. For dessert I recommend the truffle gelato. Mmmmm. This is a great place for romantic dinners, family gatherings and nights out with friends."
We will be back!,"Went out on date night with my wife and ended up in Casa Tartufo almost by accident as we found Club Street too noisy.
Small but high quality menu. The entire staff was very attentive and knowledgeable.

Happy with quality of food and wine.

Will be back for sure!"
Amazing truffle flavoured food,"The food here is mainly centered around truffles, but the dishes certainly hero the ingredient well. We had the truffle pasta which was good as well as a cheese ravioli. The cheese with ham and truffle honey was a good appetiser as was the arancine (rice balls). Their most unique item was the truffle gelato which was very good and interesting with bits of salty truffle inside but not to be overwhelming the sweetness of the ice cream. A good place to go for a nice occasion."
Great,Fantastic food and service. Restaurant had great atmosphere and staff were attentive and efficient. T
Friendly staff and great food,"I would have given 5 stars but because we only had 3 dishes felt that may be over generalising. I had the pasta and truffles dish and my wife had the sea urchin risotto. All in all, great food and not too pricey - 220 SGD with 2 glasses of wine, 2 main courses a starter and 2 desserts."
Wonderful,"Food, ambiance and service were wonderful. My favorite dish was the scallops. Will definitely make a trip back and recommend it to friends."
Excellent to the Core !,"I stayed at Scarlet years ago. The Tartufo was not there. I gave it a chance. And boy , was this an experience. I am a Hotelier and foodie that has travelled and has been eating the World over. I also worked and dined in Italy and I am bias to Italian restaurants out of their country, but Casa Tartufo did it for me, two nights in a row. Chef Alessandro obviously knows his deed. He must like the Truffles. We met the great staff of the place like Andrew, Kishen, Manager Pooja and the lovely Filipino Chef's that made it all happen. First night in Casa Tartufo, creamed scrambled eggs with fresh truffle shavings, one of the best Costar's in my life, a Caprese which was not comparable to any before, fantastic Sicilian wine, second evening in Aria up on the roof a Seared Scallop dish with caviare and creamed cheese sauce, a Sea Urchin and Tartufi risotto which was in my opinion a bit too ""al dente"" but still fabulous and the incredible Truffle Gelato. I have visited Singapore for decades, I know Club Street area but this little Jewel shall not be forgotten. Fantastico ! Grazie. you cant count for us to be back. I am a VERY difficult food and wine customer but their consistency is admirable. I would suggest it to anyone anywhere for one of the best Italian Restaurants I have dined in - outside of Italia. Keep it up - we will be back."
Slight disappointment,When first stepped in the restaurant there wasn’t anyone attend us but I had to approach somebody to bring us in. The signature Tajarin Casa was a bit too salty to my taste bud. Overall passable experience but not too sure if will return:
The menu and promotions on Chope is OUTDATED,I booked the restaurant through Chope after reading about the menu and promotions. I was interested in the degustation menu but it was totally different when i got there. And I was told by the restaurant that the promotions i saw on Chope was many years ago and no longer valid.
Great Italian truffle meal,"This family-run Italian joint housed in a unique conservation building in Chinatown prides in their truffle-centred menu. Place is a wee bit dim due to its dark & maroon coloured furniture & walls but food is good, & daintily presented. Staff is friendly. We enjoyed our celebratory lunch much, not forgetting our fellowship & chatter. Worth a rerun for future meals."
disappointed visit,"We usually LOVE truffle pasta, this is why we came to this restaurant but the visit was very disappointed. The pasta was not Well cooked, It was overcooked pasta like a chewing gum. The service a little bit rude. So I would not recommend this restaurant"
Romantic Italian restaurant,It is good for a date. I loved the Rucola salad which came with stewed pear. The staffs were very friendly.
Fab little Italian!,Just went for my second visit to Casa Tartufo and love it as much as the first time. Cute little bar inside plus the option of their rooftop bar too. We shared the truffle pasta and the chorizo mushroom pasta and both were amazing. Fab service too.
Good food and wine,"The restaurant offers a good selection of Italian food and wine. We had the rigatoni, and beef Carpaccio. They were well served and tasty. The decor is quite classy and the restaurant is well located if you want to explore the area: club street/Chinatown/Telok Ayer."
A truly exceptional restaurant,"This is one of the finest restaurants, with the most attentive service, that I have ever visited in the world. The food was absolutely perfectly cooked, the wine list sublime, the surroundings charming yet sophisticated. I will be back, and frankly the use of truffles, especially in the angel pasta, was beyond inspired. I am very grateful for a superb evening."
Staff are ridiculously rude,"I stayed at the Scarlet hotel back in November 2018. I came down from my room to ""enjoy lunch"" at this restaurant, and before seating me, the host put his hands in my hair!! He literally reached out and put his fingers on me!! Obviously I was appalled and took a couple steps back but decided to sit down anyway.

Once seated, the host AND the waiter that took my order decided to stand right beside me staring at me and talking about my appearance. I'm guessing they had never seen dreadlocks before!? Now I'll say this, a lot of taxi drivers mentioned to me that it's not very common to see a black person in Singapore, especially one being as dark as myself - but this service was atrocious. I've never felt more uncomfortable in my life. I was so uncomfortable that once my food came, I asked for a box, packaged it myself, and went to eat in my room. "
Average Experience,"For the price, the food served was underwhelming in taste. There wasn't a complexity in flavour as much as I had expected for the price tag. The location wasn't the best either and I'd assume people without a vehicle may find it hard to access."
Great food !,They hv nice food here n if u ever go there try the tarjarin ( which is truffle pasta ) and the scallops are always done to perfection !
Truffles and wine pairing,"What better way to taste wines than matching them with good food? We came to Casa Tartufo to try a couple of Wine & Philosophy’s labels with a truffle-themed dinner. We started with a fantastic Japanese beef carpaccio covered with freshly shaven, fragrant winter black truffles: this we paired with a white (one of Italy’s best) from the restaurant’s cellars, the Benanti Pietramarina 2010 from Mount Etna. While indulging in seductively perfumed scrambled eggs with truffles and a baked tomino cheese, we finished the white and moved to the first of W&P’s wines, the Marco Sambin Alter 2014, a Bordeaux blend from northern Italy: we all agreed its polished smoothness went very well with the airy, delicate egg dish and the nutty notes of dried herbs of the molten cheese. As primo we went for one of Casa’s star performers, the tajarin (thin egg noodles) with truffle: a perfect dish in its reduction to the essentials. This course we enjoyed with an excellent Pic-Saint-Loup 2017 from Mas de Figuier: ripe and voluptuous fruit framed by notes of pepper and dried herbs. The grand finale: a costata Fiorentina (Tuscan T-bone) grilled to perfection, with a bottle of Duseigneur Châteauneuf-du-Pape 2016, intense, concentrated and complex. Service was impeccable as always, the atmosphere warm and convivial. What a night!"
Not worth the money,Food is good but overpriced. Bad service. There are plenty of other good Italian restaurants in Singapore: simply go elsewhere.
Delicious Italian with truffles galore,"True to its name every dish has some truffle be it white or black.

The uovo with white truffle was excellent.

The capesante was good.

The pappardelle with chorizo and mushrooms were great, so was the capellini with Sicilian red prawns and harissa sauce.

The lemon tart was better than the tiramisu, which was already good!"
Nothing to be amazed about,Went there on a weekday night with friends to find the place really empty.. service was average with wait staff using their phone.. food was average as well..Nothing to shout out about.. nothing too disappointing..
Truffles and more - excellent food and wine,"A very satisfying experience in every respect. Alex, Elgin and the whole team made sure my wife and I had a great welcome and were well taken care of at any time. The ambiance of the restaurant is subtly elegant and at the same time relaxing and cozy. We had the Tomino (baked cheese) and Arancini (fried rice balls) for starters, both impeccably prepared, followed by a crunchy and juicy Milanese veal chop and a perfectly roasted Maiale (Iberico pork collar with cherry sauce). Truffles are of course the leitmotiv of the menu, and they are administered judiciously and carefully to maintain the overall balance and harmony of flavors. The wine was equally satisfying, two glasses of Pinot Grigio from Alto Adige and a bottle of Parusso Barolo 2010, with haunting notes of violets, cherries, and autumn fog. Casa Tartufo is a reference address for good Italian food and wine in Singapore."
Truffle season at Casa Tartufo,"We decided to have a quiet dinner at Casa Tartufo, as a winding down meal after our daughter’s wedding dinner 2 days before. The ambience was pleasant & quiet when we started. GWe began with a generous burrata salad which all 4 of us shared. This was followed by egg noodle pasta with white truffle, which was excellent, possibly the best I’ve had in Singapore. We finished with a delicious but heavy white mushroom risotto, which we again shared. The meal was accompanied with an exceptional ’86 Chateau Figeac, a west bank Bordeaux, I’d saved for a special event. The pairing was perfect, bringing out the best in the truffle & the wine. Elgin, the head sommelier, was warm & friendly as usual."
Nite out,"surprising quiet for a Saturday nite, we had 3 dishes , prawn capelini, pork collar & veal Milanese, best was grilled pork"
Trufflelious,"Truffle is the reason that I got to know about this place and they didn't disappoint me. Their desserts are even better, for someone who doesn't like sweet stuff - I almost want to order a second serving. Especially their truffle gelato, I can still remember the taste. I will definitely recommend this place yet of course, it is not a place that I can afford to go every week."
Truffle Truffle Truffle,"A fantastic Italian restaurant focussed on truffles, in the charming Scarlet hotel. The food and wine was beautiful and Elgin, our waiter and Sommelier, was outstanding! The Tarajin was an absolute delight and do try the Tiramisu!"
Well worth a visit.,"this Italian restaurant in a colonial hotel is a hidden gem in Chinatown. The food was excellent, great service and the wine waiter had a first class understanding of the wines available with a superb recommendation. The restaurant also offered vegan options. One of the very best Italian restaurants I have ever been to and loved the character of the place. I will be returning with friends to share my new find in Singapore!"
Very good truffle dishes.,"Enjoyed the classy atmosphere and enjoyed every dishes especially truffles scented pastas and T-bone steak. Though it is on the high side pricewise, I will come back for another great night with great food and wine! 5年前にオープンしたレストランで、名前の通りトリュフをふんだんに使った料理が売り。店の雰囲気がおしゃれで、特にパスタ料理やステーキが最高でした。"
Great Casa Tartufo Experience,Had a great dinner with my Wife at Casa Tartufo last week. Restaurant has a cozy and elegant ambiance. Food was very flavourful with good sized portions. The Risotto Casa with sea urchin and truffles was spectacular. Wine recommendation from their sommelier was also spot on
Great night out!,"Wonderful food, service and ambience for a weekend! The sommelier was very engaging and almost all courses were decent. Apart from great truffle-laced pastas, even the steak was good and done appropriately!"
Not disappointed.,"Our re-visit was not disappointing. Our first night in Singapore and staying in the Scarlet made Casa our first dining choice.
We shared a beef carpaccio, and dined on fish and pork neck, each with a glass of wine. Delicious but very expensive even on Singapore standards."
"Good food, mediocre service","A great Italian restaurant with excellent starters and a solid range of mains which reflects the authentic south Italian kitchen. Service was mediocre and the ambiance was not great, but def worth a visit."
amazing!!,i love the food here. i have to personally recommend the targerine ( its black truffles plus spagettti) thats my favourite dish. the scallops are always done to perfection. i think this place is a hidden gem! the boss is an italian and hes really nice and polite and makes you feel welcome. A super warm family vibe here.
Excellent food,"I came here with my family for the first time to celebrate my birthday, and thoroughly enjoyed the food. The garlic bread that we had for starters was excellent, and we could not stop eating it! We each had the lunch set, which is excellent value for the amount and quality of the food you're getting. Each of the courses was wonderful, and the truffle in the pasta was delicious. We also really enjoyed the truffle risotto balls.

Overall although the price is on the higher-end (especially if you're ordering the truffle dishes), the quality of the food was excellent, and the service and ambiance was very good as well. We will definitely be back again!"
A quiet place for afternoon coffee/tea,"I usually end up here during the non-peak hours and have a cup of coffee. I like their blend of coffee beans, and the environment is quite conducive for a quiet moment to do a quick bit of work, a bit too dark for reading, probably best for a short private chat."
Casual night out,"Went there with a friend tonight. Both looked forward to good dessert and drink. Unfortunately, the waiter Mahendran was “too friendly”. In the 20m we were there, he asked if I was a teacher, alleged he recognized me, then made implicit suggestions I was old!! Also had the audacity to ask my age??? My night which was really pleasant before we stepped became a total disaster. What business is it of anyone if I look old or not. Utterly obnoxious. Never stepping in again."
EXCELLENT,"Casa Tartufo Restaurant is a wonderful Italian restaurant situated in the Scarlet Hotel, Chinatown, Singapore. We had the most fabulous meal here. It really was absolutely delicious and the service was superb. We would definitely recommend this restaurant."
Nice pleasant restaurant,Went there with me Son to have a men’s lunch and we did enjoy very much. Food was tasty and service very pleasant. Pasta was very well done and sauces a good match. Recommended
Excellent restaurant with Truffles,It's a Family run Italian restaurant with many dishes with truffles. Owners is very friendly. Dishes are excellent!
Horrible,"When I made the reservation, I indicated that it was for a special occasion and requested for a quiet corner table. I even called the day before to confirm, although the staff who answered the called wasn't that courteous. To my horror, when we walked into the restaurant, we were led to a dingy corner that was facing the kitchen door and the room was smelling of turpentine. When I enquired on the main dining hall which was empty and nicely decorated, the manager merely said that it was booked by a large group some time time ago . Mine was made at least a month ago. They could at least have called to check with me. I will never go back to the restaurant regardless of how good the food is reputed to be."
Good Italian in quiet restaurant with great service,We went to celebrate our anniversary and this place did not disappoint. It’s quiet and intimate on a weekday night just off the bustle of Chinatown. Food was good all round and the truffle gelato was heavenly.
trufffe heaven,great little intimate restaurant serving very homely renditions of delicious italian food. Especially love their risotto and truffle gelato
Walkabout morning ristretto,"On my morning stroll when I spotted this lovely looking cafe. Says Italian, watch is around 7am time for a ristretto.

Warm nice ambience, nicely greeted by the guy behind the bar. He never heard of a ristretto before, gave him my interpretation of what it is. He gave it a try, using his creative an a automatic machine. Came out excellent!

Opening hours on tripadvisor is wrong. They are independent restaurant and service a hotel for breakfast

Breakfast here!"
Unfresh truffle,Ordered a few white truffle dishes and a lobster pasta which were fine. We had to send back the pasta with sea urchin and black truffle as it had a very strong ammonia smell. It was later conveyed to us that the strong ammonia smell was due to unfresh truffle. Very disappointed that a truffle restaurant will serve truffles of such bad quality.
Great family warmth and top class food,"Cosy down to earth restaurant with very personal and warm service. Had a birthday celebration for a group of 8 and the attentiveness from the staff made it really special. The food was excellent, comparable to any fine dining establishment. White truffle dishes to die for!"
"Exquisite Food, Great Ambience!",Egg noodles with black truffles is delicious! Truffles gelato is surprisingly good. We had fun interacting with the owner's 3 lovely kids too :-)
Italian near Chinatown.,"A very nice restaurant in Singapore. Just off of a plane this is the first restaurant we went to. Food was good and service. It was a bit expensive ,and we had not worked out the local currency. Meal for two including wine about £125.00"
Excellent trouffle restaurant,"Excellent food! Every dish was perfectly executed. Loved it, loved it, loved it! We had a wonderful evening there. Will sure to visit soon."
Good Place for Affordable Italian Food for Truffles Lovers,"It is a small and cosy restaurant that serves very yummy Italian food at a reasonable price tag. The dish Florentina was done perfectly! Though we have requested for the meat to be re-cooked slightly as it was too raw for our liking, the chefs managed to retain it moisture and cooking it to just slightly before well done! We loved the steak!

In addition, they have arranged for a complimentary slice of cake with hand-piped ""Happy Birthday"" on the plate to celebrate the occasion when they got to know that it was our friend's birthday. That was a really kind gesture."
Fantastic,"Wonderful food and service. The best 'non Asian' food I have eaten in Asia. Finally, a rare steak cooked to order."
Wonderful Dinner,I had a wonderful dinner at Casa Tartufo. Very friendly staffs. Was celebrating my girlfriend's birthday there and received a nice surprise from them. Truffle Gelato Ice Cream is AMAZING.
"Pasta Heaven, Carpaccio Ecstasy!","A long time favourite. Chef has a way with truffles - the carpaccio is extremely fine, the cream spread incorporates generous slices of truffles and thick shavings of grana padana. Heavenly. I've sampled every home made pasta dish here - this last one featured wide ribbon pasta, with wild mushrooms, porcini mostly and crispy chorizo. Creamy mushroom parm sauce. One can tell that the ingredients are all lovingly sourced and handled. The restaurant was almost empty on a Monday evening, so one would expect a higher level of attention from the servers. In this case, they should have automatically asked me if I wished to have cheese or pepper after serving each dish. A simple matter of training, one supposes. Also, Chef should seriously consider nixing the paper napkins - this is not a picnic meal. This level of food deserves proper white linen serviettes."
A little taste of Italy in Singapore,"What a pleasant surprise to find this little taste of Italy in the Chinatown district of Singapore. We had a drink and bar food on Saturday night and went away highly impressed with the quality of the food and the impressive Italian wine list. I enjoyed a 2012 Brunello which was magnificent and expectational value for such a wine. Impressed with our small tasting from the night before we went back for lunch the next day. We chose the $38 set lunch, an entree of salami and char grilled capsicum salad, so simple yet so many flavours of Italy hit our taste buds. The Tacchino or Milanese style breaded turkey breast was cooked to perfection, the turkey was moist and the crumbing golden brown accompanied with a rocket and tomato salad. The tomatoes are imported fresh from Italy and tasted like real tomatoes should taste and not like the ones you buy at a supermarket. I finished with the signature Truffle gelato which was truly sublime, a hint of truffle immediately hits your palate before a wave of vanilla finishes the experience. Our waiter Mike was so pleasant and extremely helpful. His genuine passion for food and wine shone as bright as his smile. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that wants an amazing Italian experience in Singapore."
Value-for-money lunch,"Their set lunch was extremely affordable at 28++, and had a wide variety of mains and desserts to choose from. Loved the free bread (with balsamic + olive oil dip) and coffee that came with the delicious lunch as well.

Extra thumbs up for allowing diners to turn up in shorts and slippers."
Excellent food for an excellent price,"Took my family here for Mother's Day lunch, so opted for their set lunch menu. Menu is great with a wide selection of pasta. Food was yummy and the staff was friendly. Set lunch is of great value too"
"Delicious, unpretentious Italian food","Love their pan-fried scallops with caviar and their foei gras mini ravioli, both garnished with shaved truffles. I'll be back for more!"
So-so,Not impressed with the truffle dishes. We ordered the much raved about truffle egg noodles but it was just passable. I've had better.
Authentic Italian Food,"High Quality, healthy ingredients, professional service with in and outsitting possibilites. Thank to Pooja, Alex & Team"
"Food isn't great, seabass is not fresh","Service and environment is quite nice, quiet and tranquil. Starter of the uovo is not too bad, also the scallop fish. Main is way less convincing, in particular my seabass is not properly sourced and doesn't taste fresh. I am pescatarian and have a sharp tongue on fish, and needless to say with the mid to high end pricing I was expecting proper logistics and well sourced fish. I think food is still the most important factor in a restaurant and unlikely will go back here."
Nice ambience. Good food,"Nice little Italian restaurant that serves up very good Italian cuisines. It was my bff's birthday and the restaurant also gave a complimentary tiramisu :) awesome food. Thanks for the wonderful evening.

Service is very good too! Staff very attentive and recommended us a good wine to pair with our dinner. Thanks"
5 stars!,The carpaccio was simply the best I have ever tasted. This was followed by an excellent fish course. The owner/waitress was very attentive. Friendly and atmospheric place!
"Great service, but food can be improved","Service was great, we had 3 dishes, the scramble egg w shaved truffle, tajarin (egg noodles w tartufo), and papardelle w beef ragu. The scrambled eggs was pretty good for the first few mouths but after a while it gets too rich. Same with th tajarin. I also think they didn't put enough salt in the pasta as it was quite bland. Or maybe the truffle is too overpowering. It had a bit of bitter aftertaste. Papardelle was okay."
V Day,"It was a dining occasion that is value for money, had great menu done by Casa Tartufo. Will definitely swing by again"
Could be better,"Ambience definitely a wow, food was a bit disappointing was expecting more from it. Service was good and accommodating though."
Authentic Tasty Truffle Infused Italian dishes,"Located at The Scarlet Hotel, most of their dishes have some element of truffles introduction. Even their dessert is uniquely truffle-centric with tiramisu (with a touch of truffle) and truffle gelato, which we were curious and eager to try.

There are also main dishes which does not include truffle, in case one is not so inclined to appreciating the aroma and taste of truffle.

Their starter of japanese beef carpaccio was very favourful, soft and incredibly tender. Their Burratina (smoked burrata cheese with fresh summer black truffles) was meltingly moist and delectable. Their famous truffle fries were scrumptious.

Their appetizing Osso Buco was excellent, and full of melt in the mouth delicate goodness. It was deliciously paired with rich risotto which appeared to have its golden hue from saffron.

Their signature thin egg-noodles truffle pasta (Tajarin) had generous shavings of black truffle.

The truffle scent and taste was not overwhelming in the tiramisu, but the gelato had a more pronounced truffle flavour.

Although we did not try their 3-course set lunch, it is a bargain at $38, which was already the price of most of their mains from their ala-carte lunch menu.

The relaxing ambience at this rustic family-run Italian tratorria was rather cosy and quiet. Not crowded for a Friday afternoon, and conducive for a fruitful business lunch.

Service was efficient, but could have been friendlier with some welcoming smiles instead.

Helen
Singapore"
Breakfast buffet style,"It provided breakfast for my stay, but too expensive. The food is ok but nothing more. Service is self service and waiter service."
Truffle pasta is the winner!,"Must order truffle pasta. Beef was slightly disappointing, pork collar was delightful. End off on a sweet note with truffle sorbet."
A terrace with truffles in a hear of the city,"The restaurant offers a usual dining area downstairs which is like a good Italian restaurant, but we usually like to go on the romantic roof terrace - it's cosy, not always quite, but a good escape in the city.
The service is average on the terrace, as it's not easy to oversee all tables, but the waiters are good. You juts have to call them, or wait - depends on your patience! :)
The food is delicious. They really have the biggest choice on the menu with truffles.
Everything is good!
Enjoy, but carefully check when they are open."
Great lunch set menu,Really good set lunch menu. Portions are good and value for money. Need to wait a while for the food so have at least an hour.
"Fantastic Ambience , very wholesome honest food.",chose the restaurant for the food and ambience and it did not disappoint. my party of four enjoyed the venue and food. A little pricey but the food was delicious and overall experience makes it worth paying.
Truffles galore,"If you like truffles, this is the place to go. We like how they infuse truffles in their starters, mains and desserts. The cheese with crispy Parma ham drizzled with honey truffle is really yummy. Have to add that there is an excellent selection of Italian wines too. Service is good, ambience cozy and romantic, however prices are on the higher range, recommended for special occasions when you want to splurge on loved ones."
A small calm space in which to relax.,Ambience and obliging staff for whom service is no problem - a small oasis of calm in a bustling Singapore - a great place for mid a.m. coffee or late afternoon Prosecco in the heart of Chinatown ! Perfect .
Transport me back to Italy,"We ordered their house specialty Tarjarin, their signature thin egg noodles with fresh black truffles sourced from Tuscany, as well as their veal shank.
The veal shank was savoury and tender with tasteful bits of tendon. There was bone marrow which added a rich flavor to the saffron risotto which accompanied this dish. Their house pour red, a Tuscan IGT by Massi, paired well with the veal shank. The slightly acidic Tuscan red complimented the tender veal tendon.
The standout dish was the Tarjarin pasta, a Piedmont dish which is their house specialty and on their menu for over 6 years. Rich in flavor from the black truffles sourced from Tuscany, the pasta itself was simply al detente and provided a deliciously springy bite. The rich mushrooms sauce is well immersed in the egg noodles. While on a trip to Italy we had many excellent pastas and this dish certainly ranks with the best of them. For travelers to Italy, Casa Tarttufo's signature pasta dish will transport them back to the warm memories of their Italian summer. This dish pairs well with their second house wine, a Veneto.
The ambience of the restaurant is also very European. Cozy, warm and romantic like as if one was back in Italy."
Great value! Fresh Truffles dishes,"Love the dishes over at this homely restaurant. Makes me feel like Im back in the quint part of Italy. High recommended if you are looking to bring your date or loved ones for a good time.

Do order their truffle dishes. It was REALLY GOOD. Highlight of my meal was the"
Great Sunday Family Lunch,"We had a lazy Sunday lunch as there was a craving for truffles. Surprisingly child friendly as there is a playroom off to the side that can be opened up for the kids. The Bolognese was declared the best ever by the 6 year old, and the adults enjoyed their signature Tajarin, egg noodles served with lashings of truffles. They do a set lunch 7 days a week, and with the service being attentive and warm, we will be back!"
Great food and attentive service,"Went as a group to celebrate the birthdays of 2 friends. We tried a variety of food - burratina, tajarin, capellini (with sicilian red prawns), lombata, maiale (iberico pork), truffle sorbet. You could say we were ""truffle-ised""! Food was great except for the tiramisu which was a little disappointing. Staff were attentive and polite.We even liked the cookies which came with our coffee/tea. Alex, the owner, made sure we were each given a pack of cookies to bring home. Truly a memorable evening."
Thumbs Up for Food and Service,"My first visit to Casa Tartufo, invited by friends who have been there before.

Food: Delicate taste of very fine yet robust taste of Sicilian cuisine. Had the Egg Noodle with Truffle (sorry can't remember the actual name) and the Capellini with Sicilian Prawns! Absolutely divine to my gastronomic tastebuds. All of us (7 ladies) never thought we could finish 2 humongous portions of meat. The T-bone Steak and Pork Ibericca Collar Bone. But we finished every morsel. It was the first time my chewing machine didn't have to work overtime. It was a beautiful smooth taste. Desserts were good too.....but will leave you to discover.

Service: We all wanted to try both pasta. Brilliant idea by the Host. She got us to order 3 portions of one and 4 portions of the other. Our servings came beautifully plated with both pastas. That was truly a treat from the Host and Chef.

Thank you Casa Tartufo team for an unforgettable dining experience!"
Great aperitif nice service,Greater welcome - family welcome atmosphere great menu try the private dunning they have a very decent wine list - la masa always a good choice
Great Service and Food,Have been going to Casa Tartufo way before they moved to this current location. What made the difference is the high level of service and the friendliness. Our family thoroughly enjoy our every visit. The food has been great. Would keep on visiting.
OK only,"HI, the food was average, but service was great and the decor as nice.. but since food was average, i will most likely not make a trip back."
What a gem.,"Casa Tartufo is the breakfast / dining room of the Scarlet Hotel where we have been staying. Breakfast is a fairly standard motel-type buffet breakfast with a few Singaporean twists.
We dined tonight. I did not enquire about ""gluten-free"", having been informed at breakfast that all the bread was gluten free because it was wholemeal! My porcini mushrooms arrived, fried in a light batter. When I enquired, the Lady of the house, who had a good understanding of English and culinary terms immediately offered me an alternative of fresh girolle mushrooms in a white wine sauce, gluten free and delicious. I had never thought to be eating fresh girolles. My wife finished off the porcini. Next came my beef Carpaccio, and Karen had fresh Mediterranean sardines. All delicious. We had no room for anything more."
Best Truffle in town,"I went on Aug 9, for Lunch. The Service was excellent, they are very attentive and they really know what they are serving. Overall this is a place that I highly recommend for those Truffle Lovers."
Fantastic truffle dinner with great wine!,"The menu offered a wide selection of dishes, including several ones containing truffles. It was a tough choice before I could make the decision to go ahead with the Japanese beef carpaccio with generous servings of fresh truffle shavings and truffle paste.It was very much enjoyed and portion was just nice. The foie gras filled ravioli was on the other hand, on the creamy and heaver side, though I would say the wine managed to balance that out. Taste-wise, it was delicious, and the main course was truly a full-filling ne!

Service was friendly and swift. Love the decor of the restaurant/hotel too!"
Perfect,Perfect food & ambience. Waiters are very friendly and helpful! Plenty of good food and wine choices. Would recommend to any couple looking for a romantic dinner.
Superb italian food,"Authentic italian food with a zeste of cook originality . Nice service , nice place . Decent price . Adress not ot forget in the area . On top they do cooking teaching for small groups ."
"Bizarre annoying music, nasty wine, no customers","I tried Happy Hour but with limited options it was a Fail. Never had skunky prosecco before...even cheap prosecco is usually no worse that ""ok"". The house white was as good as low quality jug wine from Lodi. The music was not only too loud, but sounded like some washed up Italian crooner with strep throat being tortured. I couldn't take it. I bailed out before attempting to order food."
Nice food but might be over priced,Went there with my colleague for the set lunch while I am staying in the Scarlet Hotel. The style of this venue is a little bit rustic but the food was decent. However I think the good might be overpriced compared to other restaurants in the CBD of Singapore
"Excellent service, good food...a bit overpriced","Next to the Scarlet Hotel, you will find Casa Tartuffo. Truffel (Tartuffo) is in a lot of their dishes. Few tables for 2 outside : not a stunning view but nice to be in a non air-con environment sometimes. Professional service, nice menu, good dishes, nice wine list....prices might be a bit on the high side.
On the top floor, you have a very nice bar - open terrace. Don't miss it after dinner."
"Beautiful food, beautiful environment","I used to patronise Casa Tartufo when it was located in Forum, then I forgotten all about it after it moved to The Scarlett Hotel. It took the Restaurant Week dining event in March to remind me of Casa Tartufo, and I had a wonderful three-course lunch there.

I enjoyed an appetising beetroot soup with yoghurt and a splash of truffle oil; an unattractive brown mash of mushroom ravioli with porcini cream and truffle oil that tasted way better than it looked; a flavourful twisted pasta with pesto sauce, roasted almonds and Sicilian prawns; and the restaurant's signature truffle ice-cream and a sprinkle of sea salt.

On top of the Restaurant Week set menu, we also threw in an order of beef carpaccio with rocket and a heap of truffle shavings. Great decision. The beef was shaved perfectly thin and was so fresh.

Attentive and friendly service by Adrian was cherry on top, and the entire dining experience made me book an eight-pax lunch the following weekend to celebrate my birthday.

In terms of environment, Casa Tartufo can be quite the versatile venue. In the day, it is bright and serene, perfect for family get-togethers. In the evening, the restaurant takes on a sexy vibe and is great for romantic dinners or celebratory dinners for small groups."
"Stunning Pasta, Truffle Heaven and Brilliant Service","I'm a great fan of finding hidden gems for food while travelling, especially on business travel when one can end the hectic work day with a menu to look forward to, reliable service and a foodie chat with Chef. I've used this restaurant in all my frequent visits to Singapore since opening, when Chef and I chatted about homemade pasta and truffles, a heady combination. I'm glad to say that the quality of the food is consistently high, the truffles a rare treat, the presentation charming - without being the usual Gordon Ramsey-type anemic and over-done fussy decoration of a too-large plate. My Italian grandmum always served proper portions and thankfully so does Casa. A wonderful change of pace from the lame Italian restaurants we suffer from in HK, where the chef is overrated and the portions mingey (sp?), and the pricing ridiculously high. At Casa, I sampled the rigatoni, the cappellaci, and the accompanying appetisers - one of which featured an antipasto with beautifully done grilled zucchini and cherry tomatoes, fresh leaves, pesto and hints of truffle. The bruschetta likewise had a lovely portion of bufalino mozzarella, all appreciated. Excellent for a business lunch, or better yet, enjoy on one's own to fully enjoy the flavours without the distraction of having yack away at business stuff. Lastly, and rare for Singapore, the service is attentive without being overly intrusive, AND they remember your preferences, a rarity. Enjoy . . ."
Exquisite food in a cozy environment,"Specialized in truffle with an original twist, all the ingredients are extremely fresh!
I tried the truffle burrata and it was sublime (I'm italian and I come from the region where they produce burrata, you can trust my burrata palate!), the egg noodle with truffle excellent and the veal as well was cooked at perfection. They have a very good wine selection, the owner from Sicily is kind and welcoming but not invasive, he also offered us coffee at the end of the dinner.
Definitely a great place for a romantic dinner, the place is quit with soft jazz music and italian classics, perfect to talk. There is an amazing rooftop bar called Aria that deserves a look at the end of the dinner. Looking forward to go there again soon"
Disappointing.,"Walk In. Dinner for 2

Wanted to satisfy some truffle cravings and decided to check this place out. Specializing in truffles.......what can go wrong.

The restaurant itself is nice, it reminded me of some places I visited in Italy. Cosy and quaint but not tacky.

The service was a let down. It was funny because initially we didn't even know who the waiter was, it was only later when we realized that the guy in jeans and t shirt was part of the staff. Eventually we noticed he put on an apron, probably under the guidance of the manager. Overall the service felt confused and uninviting.

The food was good overall. Several high notes but dragged down by a couple of disappointments. The cocktails were decent but the bread was average at best. The Tomino was good and the Tartufata was excellent. The Tajarin tasted good but the texture of the pasta was a disappointment. The Risotto was the biggest disappointment....it was suppose to have sea urchin but honestly there really wasn't much in the dish and the overall taste of the dish was average at best. Perhaps it was the quality and quantity of the sea urchin for the day, but it was a far cry from my early experiences with this dish elsewhere.

Overall. For the price your paying you would expect better quality. I would also recommend the restaurant ditch the electronic imitation table candles.....or buy better ones, the current ones flicker like Christmas tree lights and do injustice to the rest of the interior."
CASA Tartufo Review,Dinner was excellent! The owner is very friendly. He made the lemon tart dessert using lemons that had been brought from Sicily!
Little piece of Truffle Heaven,"It was a good friend's birthday celebration and we chanced upon this place earlier in the morning en route to breakfast. We had 2 special bottles of wine with us and wanted someplace nice to enjoy it with dinner. Singapore corkages are nowadays rather high so we booked in advanced and spoke to a lady manager who initially offered a 1 to 1 free corkage but we negotiated bring 2 to pay1 as it was really a special birthday. In the end with all the grappas and averna after the meal, corkage was waived.

Food reminds us really of good italian places, proper service, good ambiance, unobtrusive yet efficient staff despite a full house. We ordered of frito miso, tomino, tajarin, gnocchi to share and for mains, the beef and the pork. Highlight was the beef and gnocchi while all the rest was great. Special mention to the truffle fries as well.
For dessert birthday boy had a special plate of lemon sorbet and semifreddo which chef whipped up and we all sampled.

It was a leisurely meal filled with laughter, wines, good food and thoroughly enjoyable. While by no means cheap at 500 Sin for 4 person, it beats flying 13 hours to Italy and still paying about the same price for the same good value.
I hear in the upstairs bar there is a sicilian casual dining place which will be high on my list to try next time.
Go if you like truffles and good italian."
