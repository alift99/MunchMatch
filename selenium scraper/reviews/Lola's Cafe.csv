Standards dropping with limited options in the area,"Average cafe, that remains popular as limited choices in the area. Good coffee is their heart & sole, but it’s the food & service that drop it down. My shakshuka was crazy oily, lacked flavour, & side order of pork sausage stone cold. Wife’s Miso salmon brunch bowl somewhat dry, lacked flavour with overcooked salmon. Service clumsy, with our 3 dishes not served together (1 at a time over 10-12 minutes) & difficult to order 2nd round of drinks. Because of high turnover, feeling is that we need to get out asap (not a chill experience)."
Good matcha black sesame tart,"A busy and popular cafe, especially so during weekends. Tried matcha black sesame tart as it was an interesting combination, and it was good. Brunch was ok."
Cosy cafe in a busy neighbourhood,"Offering a cosy space to chill out in a densely populated neighbourhood, this cafe has a good selection on its menu although food is average."
Excellence Service for heartland cafe,"Parking is limited.
Service is TOPS.
Please call for reservations

Wings:
Nice n crispy, definitely worth trying. The tint of honey really goes well with the Parikka.

Cake:
Quite a disappointment. The sponge is rather rough and dry. The chocolate they used doesn't taste nice too.

Matcha Ice Green Latte :
Worth trying if you like strong matcha taste."
Only for the neighbourhood folks,"Curious after reading all the rave reviews so popped by at about 1pm intending to have lunch but after filling in particulars with phone contact, was told wait would be 40 minutes so went to Soon Soon Teo Chew Porridge 2 doors away to have local fare and wait to be contacted.
About 20 minutes later they had an inside table and I ordered the lychee cake and a cappucinno. These came quite quickly, cake was good but the cappucinno was a very small cup. Since my table was right next to the door, it wasn't very restful with the wait staff coming and going as there is another room next door while the barista operates from this other room.
Attentive service as they bring food and bill to you (Nets)with GST charge but not a place to chill with a book, paper, laptop as it is crowded with families and youngsters, and it's a weekday, can't imagine the weekends!
Was told only one hour allocated but I fled after 20 minutes, back to the East where there are cafés with a more relaxed atmosphere. Didn't try the food which is mainly hip Western, pasta, fries etc which looked good but not really worth the awkward wait. Only convenient if you live in the neighbourhood."
Tried the burger during lockdown oh and tasty lemon meringue and black seasme tarts!,"Hi,
I live by and have eaten here a few times - but not during lockdown.
Today was burger craving day and seeing the rest of my house was sorted I decided that I need to try the Lola's beef burger - takeway style!
Easy to order over whatsapp as well.
Glad I did - being an aussie - having a fried egg on the burger was a complete winner for me.
Desert menu also tempted me to order the lemon meringue tart which was exactly as I wanted but also tried the black seasme tart and was blown away how good that tasted. Felt like the right size too.
Will definitely treat myself to another burger in the future!"
Good relaxing cafe,"Tried their Pulled Pork and Avocado Egg Benedict. It was decent and a good portion. What I love most is their Crab cake benedict. It was something interesting, not the usual stuff you find on a menu. So those up for something interesting can try this."
Love it!,"Cool place to chill.
Nice cakes and coffees, i remember my favorite being the lemon meringue tart.
Positioned in a nice neighborhood location, if you are a tourist, you can see the locals in their natural habitat.
Ohh, very helpful and friendly staff was well.
Highly recommended"
Great Value,It's good value for quality cafe food. One dish that stands out to me is the Paprika Crispy Wings this food is very nice u must try. Food was served very fast. And the place is very convinient it's located within walking distance from Kovart MRT.
Do not miss their Bangers & mash and honeyed wings,"Had and love their bangers & mash, their honeyed wings, and lychee cake! I remember having their standard breakfast years ago and it was pretty good too!"
Excellent foods and service,"Excellent foods and service very nice atmosphere, I was enjoying a lots my meal. Thank you so much for best foods"
Food was great!,Went there with friends for lunch! The place was quiet and cozy. I really like their honey chicken wings. Prices and portions are reasonable!
Lola's Cafe the awesome place,"Lola's Cafe is my favourite cafe whenever i meet up friend for brunch or chit chat etc.
Most staff are really friendly too. I love theor hot mocha (but at time it taste slight different with different barista) We super love their Truffle Fries, Grill Chicken Salad, Honey Paprika Wing, Super love their Lola's Breakfast (2 person can share ) , Pulled Pork & Avocado Egg Benedict, Fish and Chip, Nacho Cheese Fries , Angus Beef Burger, Baked Salmon etc etc we love the Lychee RoseWater Cake but the recent visit standard dropped for the cake. Too hard and not properly thawed. But staff reacted immediately after we shared the experience."
Unexpected,Food was terrific. I found out about this place on Trip Advisor. I’m very happy with our delicious lunch. This is not a fancy place but it was packed with a long queue. Be sure to make a booking. Enjoy Lola’s!
Busy Cafe with Good food,"Okay the food is not bad, but I do not know why the queue is crazy even with reservations! The place is not very accessible but if you live east or north east, then it is a good regular neighbourhood joint. We did not try the cake and I only had truffles fries and a matcha latte. Although it is simple, the latte is real matcha made, you can taste the green tea and its smell."
Make you go ooh-la-lola,"Lola's Cafe is without a doubt my favourite cafe in Kovan.

I can't even remember how many times I have been to this cafe, but it's because the food is always so good. I especially love the Tomato Swimmer Crab Linguine, which is really rich in flavour. The Honey Paprika Crisp Wings is really good too, and is a great side to the main dishes. My favourite would have to be the Truffle Fries, which is addictive, and you would have finished it before you know it.

The staff are really friendly too, and that brings a smile to your face even to the last moment.

Be sure to come here early though, as this place is popular and can get crowded, otherwise you might have to wait quite a while to get a seat.

To get here, take the MRT to Kovan Station (North-East Line) and take the exit with the bus stop (opposite Heartland Mall). When you reach the traffic lights, cross the side with a coffee shop in front, and turn left and walk a short distance to reach the cafe."
Good meal and service,Went here for dinner with family on a weekend. Beef cheeks was tender and flavourful. Loved the chai tea latte as well. The honey apple cake with ice cream was a nice way to round off the meal and evening. Service was prompt and friendly. Located fairly near to Kovan MRT Station.
Dessert Anyone,"The food never fails to satisfy my taste bud. Be it the main meal, dessert, coffee or just a juic.e. A place to be on the 'must try list'. Crew always attentive, friendly and fast with orders"
Good ambience,Food was good. Ambience was great. Loved their brunch menu. Their chicken wings and Lola's breakfast was fantastic.
Good food for north-Easters!,"Overall nice cafe and accessible, but price wise can be a little steep. But I really like the miso salmons bowl and the home made lemonade!"
Decent food but slightly expensive,"Decent food but slightly expensive. The portion is satisfying and the pulled pork taste good and not too salty. The burger is normal but I think is abit overpriced which cost about $20( with GST), with only one patty and some fries. The wings is crispy and well seasoned. The black sesame tart unexpectedly good and the filling is really smooth and tasty and not sweet (feel like can make a really good filling for a snowskin mooncake )."
Nice food with average service,Pretty good food but service was not impressive. Coffee was up to standard. Will still come back and see how their service quality fare.
Must visit!,Spending our late brunch there after shopping at Samadi market.. Enjoys the food especially the smoothies! I still miss their smoothies now.
Lola review,"Great food, and very friendly staffs! Good for gathering of close friends and family, enjoyed my time here!"
Hidden charm in the heartlands,"A casual and cosy place perfect for gathering of close friends and family. Good food, hospitable staff members and simple ambience."
Nice Ambiance & foods,"Always enjoyed the foods in Lola's. Our All time favorite Ultimate croissant, Honey paprika wing & pull pork Egg Benedict!"
Great neighbourhood place,Absolutely love this place for our regular coffees and brunch. The team there are doing a great job and I wish them the best!!
"Great Food, Great Service!","I ordered the Miso Salmon Grain Bowl, truffle fries & the Lola’s breakfast. portion sizes were good! the truffle size portion was very very decent for $10. struggled to finish the above for 2 people. the miso salmon grain bowl was seasoned perfectly and tasted amazing. service was really good, friendly & prompt! i went at 2 pm and the crowd was good!"
Delicious,The dishes were very unique and yummy. Purchased a chope voucher before going which made it more affordable. Otherwise it’s just like cafe price
Great Place for Brunch,"Good food, Nice Ambiance, Friendly and fast Service staff. If the tables could be a little further from each other would make it perfect"
Sunday Family Brunch,Pulled Pork with avocado is too salty. Plate too small for the ultimate croissant. Felt a little “jelut” after a couple of mouthful. Cozy ambience and friendly team members. A little pricy for a family of 4.
Food was delicious,Went Lola's for brunch. Great little cafe. Lovely food and we totally enjoyed the quality of the food. I still want to try the other stuffs on the menu.
Food was great!!,"The food was affordable, especially for students with limited budget like me. Moreover, the food was really good as well."
I will be backkk 👍,"Here for the first time.

Ordered the iced mocha in view of the reviews. It's a lil on the sweeter side but pretty nice nonetheless; and it helps to balance the savoriness of the rest of our dishes. 4/5

As for the mushroom truffle cream linguini, the truffle was not overpowering and the overall combination was just about right :) 4/5

The sausages in bangers and mash is juicy and goes well with the gravy. The mashed potatoes was kind of meh though. 3/5

I must say that the nachos cheese fries was wayyyy too much for my partner and I. The serving and cheese were VERY generous but maybe the service staffs should advise customers that it's more suitable for 3 or even 4 pax and above; more of a sharing platter for bigger groups. It's 9 bucks and it's pretty worth it. 4/5

Last but not least, the service was awesome and guess what? the bill does not include service charge so that's definitely counts as an icing on the cake for me. 4/5

Overall, there wasn't a standout dish for me but in view of the ambience (bright and cozy 4/5) and price ($54), I will probably return to try their desserts and other mains next time!

Overall: 4/5"
Awesome place,My group and I were late for 10 min but we were still attended promptly. The foods are awesome! The staffs are attentive too. Cosy place to hang out although a little squeezy. :)
Good meal,Service was prompt and food was good. Cafe was cramp and the atmosphere wasn’t the most ideal. But the good food made up for it
"Great food, Good Ambience, Friendly Staff",Enjoyed the breakfast. Wide variety to choose from. Coffee and tea selection was ample. And the cakes for dessert was very tempting. Table seating was rather close to one another. Loud chatting was a little annoying from other patrons.
So many dessert,"This cafe is have so many dessert, is so delicious like tiramisu, chocholatte and various kinds of bread."
Great service,"Service was top-notch, advisable to make reservations via chope or you might have to end up waiting 30-40 mins in line for walk-ins. Must try: Honey Paprika Wings"
Comfort food,"The dinner bowls may look small, but they are very filling and we left extremely satisfied. The staff were also attentive and friendly. But of course, we visited before the crazy dinner hours, so that could be why as well."
Great ambience & food!,"My friends and I had a great time at lola's. We had wings & truffle pasta. The wings hit at the right spot, it was crispy on the outside and very juicy on the inside."
A Wonderful Experience Overall!,"I made a lunch booking for V-day and was not disappointed! From start to finish everything was great! I arrived 10 mins early from my booking time and we were immediately seated at a reserved table. Even though the cafe was full house there were just the right amount of staff to ensure we had enough attention and the cafe does not feel cramped but rather it was cosy.

They allow add-ons to options on the menu provided you top-up a small amount which is good and something not all cafes are willing to do, such as changing the type of veggies or fries for your mains.

Food arrived well on time and fresh. I had an Angus Beef Burger and the GF had Lola's Breakfast. All the components of each dish were good, fresh and well cooked. The beef patty, truffle fries, pork sausages and even their scrambled eggs! For drinks we had their V-day special, Raspberry Lemonade which was a really nice mix!

And all that, for a bill that didn't break the bank.
All in, good value for the food, service, and ambience!"
"Great location, great food, good atmosphere","First of all, its super near my home. And best thing is that my original booking was for 330pm, but my friends and i needed to be early and brought forward the meeting time to 1pm. Staff called me at 1230pm to confirm my 330pm booking and i told them the change. Immediately, staff said she will assist me to get the next available tables around 1pm. My friends reached at 1pm and gotten seats, which was awesome. But i guess, for those who drives and from a distance away, may wanna get tips on where to park before visiting."
Great Breakfast menu,"Their eggs benny is really amazing, its worth the travel to Kovan. They also have interesting desserts for one to try."
Good yummy food,Food was great and healthy tasting. Crowd do build up during lunch time. Place is kid friendly and they love the food as well.
cool,"the queue was pretty short, making it easy to get a seat. service was fast and the good was great! would definitely recommend people to go there"
One of the first few start up cafes during the first cafe craze in SG,Love their burgers and pork eggs Benedict!! Still plate and serve really nice desserts. Will always go back to Lola’s for some good ol’ cafe food.
Recommended!,"Not my first time visiting and definitely won’t be my last! The grub served is really good, and the service staff were friendly and polite."
Favourite cafe,Great food and service consistently. Only drawback would be to provide more options for vegetarians.
Pretty good ambience and service,The place has good ambience but overall the food was average wouldn’t say that it had a wow factor to it. The cakes were average too. But it’s convenient as it’s located near kovan mrt
For the mainstream,"Great place to hang out with your buddies, the chicken wings are a must try but overall experience and ambience is pretty average."
Great service great food,"Got my sofa seat request fulfilled, great food and great service. Highly recommended to everyone to dine"
"Great wings, but poor staff service","Went to Lola with a friend to celebrate her birthday. The wings, once again, were awesome! It's my third time trying the wings, and it has been consistently delicious. The other two dishes we had, Truffle Mushroom Linguine and Pulled Pork were okay. Not too bad, could do with more truffle on the first dish and though I loved the taste for pulled pork, wasn't a fan of its texture. The chicken wings still set the best standard. I had the tarts before, they were delicious. The sponge cakes (we had Earl Grey Banana and Salted Caramel Popcorn) however, were disappointed. Really dry sponges. Only the middle part of the cake was moist. Probably left out in the open for too long and dried up.Another thumbs down was the service staff. We were served by this tall guy with spectacles who came to take our order. I wanted to ask about the dish, and I guess because it was really noisy around, he couldn't hear it the first time. Instead of politely asking me to repeat, he raised his voice and went ""HUH??? WHAT??"" It was very so rude. I think he noticed the look on my face that I was unhappy. It's really disappointing."
Great! Will visit again.,"Good cafe in the neighbourhood, cheap and affordable! Food was on point! Will definitely visit again!"
Awesome experience,The food serving is big and we made some special request and they are happy to prepare for us! The atmosphere is wonderful. A great hangout place.
Averagr,"We’ve tried couple of things - pulled pork, apple pie. Food is ok just too much sauces and mayo in my view. Prices too high for quality of food."
Wonderful desserts,"A great service, lovely staff and and very enjoyable types of food and beverages... What could we ask more? I highly recommend the lemon meringue tart. The piccolo latte is worth trying too! Overall, I highly recommend this place."
"Nice food, cakes and friendly service staff","Good food, delicious pasta, salmon, yummy n crispy chicken wings. Caramel sea salt cake is very special. Coffee is great too. Overall good dining experience"
As good as it gets,A trip to Lola is always enjoyable. The food quality is always guaranteed and the waiting team pleasant and polite.
Nice food,"Food was nice compared to few years back. I have been there for twice this months and both visit are happy with thehot and fresh food. The cake was also nice. We have fish and chips, honey wings, salad, pasta, chocolate cake and lemon tart(not sure whether is it call lemon tart)."
Great Brunch Place!,The atmosphere and ambience is incredible with extremely friendly staff. The chicken wings are to die for!!!!
"Decent food, conflicting T&Cs","Food was decent enough for the price paid. Could see why there's always a crowd there. However, the T&Cs were confusing.

We bought 2 x $50 dollars vouchers for the meal but only managed to redeem one eventually. I've only managed to redeem 1 x $50 dollars voucher for a $131.80 meal.

When I was trying to redeem both vouchers, the management told me that DESPITE the terms of conditions clearly stating that ""Multiple Vouchers can be used for each visit"", I was only limited to using one. Attached in the review is the screenshot of the full T&Cs. 

The manager has told me that this has been a miscommunication between Lola's Cafe and Chope when they have requested that only one voucher can be used during my visit.

It is unacceptable that the consequences of miscommunication between Chope and Lola's cafe has to be brunt by customers like me. This was for a birthday celebration and if not for that, would not have came so far and out of the way. This situation means that I will need to visit another time just to finish using the vouchers."
nice breakfast menu,I Tried the breakfast menu here!!Its was nice!! tried the chocolate cake also nice!! The queue is quite long during dinner time!! The ultimate croissant was nice!! Too bad they only have 1 branch in Singapore!
Terrible fish and chips,"The fish and chips was terrible it’s so bland. Enquired about the tasteless fish and chips and the staff did not get back to me. Maybe it’s just my tastebuds or today’s batch of fish was bad, but I suggest you order other things except the fish and chips."
Excellent Service by Norman,"I must really compliment the excellent service provided by their service staffs every time I visit their cafe. But one of their staffs, Norman, is exceptional. He pays attention to every single detail. For instance, after we were asked to moved to the other side of the cafe, he noticed that we do not have any water and gave us without us asking for it. He even noticed that my glass of water has mint leaves in it and asked if I would like a new glass of water with mint leaves. Being in the service line as well, I would say his service level is comparable to a 6-star hotel like Ritz Carlton. I sincerely thank him for making my time at the cafe enjoyable."
quality food,brunch menu is great but not available at dinner time. a little pity. croissant is the most recommended.
Such a gem in Kovan!,"Wow. What a great little cafe in kovan. The outside does not look promising, but the inside is cool and well decorated. The food...ridiculously good. Unbelievable. Try the pulled pork with avocado, egg and hollandaise on toast. The sprinkling of paprika sets it off. The ham and scrambled. egg croissant is delicious - the eggs so buttery and rich. This place is worth traveling to - but the secret is out, be prepared to queue on weekends."
Lola’s duck confit,The return of this dish has been a big joy to my husband. The dish is very tasty and value for money. It is also served with mash potatoes n onion sauce n truffle it is simply delicious
Overhyped,"After reading a few good reviews of the place, I felt that the food did not live up to its price tag."
Good dessert!,"I love the selection of dessert here - and they are so reasonably priced!

I had the lemon meringue tart and sea salt chocolate tart - both were lovely!

Truffle fries were all right - not a huge fan of it, but the desserts make up for everything!"
Simple and good,"Little surprise saw a placard written my name on the dining table when arrived the restaurant. Simple place, served good food, portions were just right us."
Lola's Cafe,"Attentive and polite staffs, food was awesome. Suitable for any occasions. All time favourite cafe!!"
Friendly staff and nice food,"The staffs do give good recommendation on cakes. We love the cakes, wings, and salmon stew. We will be back again."
Delicious cake,I came across this cafe one afternoon and they serve very delicious cakes. The cake i ordered was the lychee rosewater cake. It smells very nice too. Rose and lychee fragrance. Will definitely go back and try other food.
Speedy Serving and nice food!,Was amazed at the speed that they serve the food. And the aglio olio was very nice. Truffles fries as well!!
Good food and price,Food was great. Lucky we made the booking as the queue was really long despite a raining day. Wings was awesome.
Worth the calories,"This cafe is rather small but cosy. We went with a group of friends plus some kids too. The food is yummy and price is reasonable too. Service level is above average. So, we were all impressed with this place. Would we return? Definitely!"
Missing avocado?,"No sign of the avocado in my breakfast. And I kinda forgot that I ordered that till after finishing the meal. So too late to tell the nice server.Very small portion and with the missing avocado it’s less filling too, and that’s when I realized that I was short changed ;<"
Gotta love a cafe who loves cats,"I love the cats they feed outside the cafe. So I love this cafe now. Food’s good, atmosphere’s good. Just park at Heartland Mall open space carpark then walk over (2 mins) because it’s too tough getting a spot along the cafe during dinner time. Would love to visit the cafe and cats again!"
Good affordable food,"Been there many many times. Getting more expensive than it was 2 to 3 years ago but for the price and food quality I will still give it 5 stars. I love the honey prapika wings and the mushroom cream pasta.
Servings are quite generous.
Always recommend."
affordable,"would always find cafe food a little on the pricey side but lola's is different! affordable and located at a heartland location, it was easy to find and also the vibes were good. staff were friendly and patient. food arrived quickly"
Brunch,"A reservation was made for brunch and we were directed to our table as soon as we arrived. The cafe was getting busy as we were taking our orders. Most of our food arrived promptly. However, one order took more than 20mins to arrive. I checked with the servers for my order as the neighboring tables who ordered the same dish had theirs while arriving later than me. Upon checking, the servers were apologetic and admitted that there was a mix up and my order was missed. They even offered a free dessert on the house as a apology. Kudos to them for their service and willingness to make amends. I would come back again.

PS, the food was awesome."
"Great Ambiance, Great Coffee, Cake's Meh","The place is very child-friendly, staff is polite and attentive. Food's fantastically-plated and taste was above expectations. Perhaps the cakes looked too tantalizing, we were very disappointed when it tasted average. Overall, a great visit. 1 point short of perfect score because of the difficult parking (limited lots outside the cafe; carparks a big junction away) and the cakes that should have tasted as good as they look."
"Finally, Lola’s","Lately, getting seats here is quite challenging. Waiting time can be as long as 45’ to 1 hr.
Finally got a chance to dine here again for brunch. Worth the wait definitely.
Try their Lola’s Breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and mushrooms with rye bread. Other recommendations are chicken pesto sandwich and pulled pork with eggs benedict and avocado. All are fantastic creations and big servings.
Perfectly paired with hot cappuccino and matcha tea latte.
Satisfaction guaranteed."
Conveniently located near kovan mrt exit b,"Short walk from kovan mrt exit b. This place is rather small. Come before 1230 on weekend to secure a table. I had the crab cakes benedict. This was ok. Not fantastic. However my friends’ scrambled egg criossant
Look good. Crowd mainly late teens to mid 20s"
Nice Matcha Latta but too small cup,"Went to take away a matcha latte. It was $4.50 for a relatively small cup. I thought the ambience of the restaurant was nice, but haven’t really tried the food. The matcha latte was quite good. For someone that like something sweet, this latte was sweet enough, and bitter enough. But it was too small a cup. Not worth for $4.50."
Breakfast at Lola's,"I really like the atmosphere of this cafe. The seats were quite unique even though I feel that the tables were a little close to each other during crowded times, making me feel a little uncomfortable."
One of the Best Cafes in SG,"What is Lola’s winning formula?
- Tasty food
- The choices were not extensive but it is good enough
- Good service from their young service staff, thumbs up
- Cozy ambience
- One of the cheapest menus around
- Fresh, aromatic , strong Piccolo coffee
- Iced Strawberry Mint Tea (without sugar) is refreshing and tasty

Minus Points -:
Not that I can think of ... perhaps , the tables for 2 were a little squeezy.

Lola’s Cafe is full even on a weekday afternoon. They have been around for a few years but they are able to sustain their popularity. It shows that if a cafe is sincere in what they offer, they are here to stay. Kudos to the management, the cafe is well run.

I will always go there if I want inexpensive but yummy cafe food."
Meals and desserts!,"It is located near Kovan MRT. just a few minutes walk. It is usually packed during peak hours but it is totally worth it. The chicken winggs, cheese fries, pasta and burger. Don't forget the desserts. We usually have lemon meringue tart for dessert. One of the best we have tasted in Singapore. This is as well a great place to have desserts after meals. They have a lot of choices of tarts and cakes. It has an affordable price. They only accept NETS and cash by the way."
Dessert with coffee & tea,"We tried their dessert and both was delicious, we had lychee rose cake and lemon meringue, goes well with our ice mocha for me and hot tea for my friend. Will be back to try other food they have and other dessert too. Friendly staff and nice place but a little noisy as it was enclosed."
Great food,"Finally came to thiscafe after so many years. Reserved table through Chope. We went there during weekday and it still full house. We did order honey paprika crispy wings, grilled chicken & brocolli cheese burger and swimmer crab and lemon leek linguine.All foods taste nice especially the crispy wings. Finger-licking!"
Nice place and desert,"I live closer and I use to go there once a while.
Good breakfast and also I really enjoy the caffe there.
But in last, they’ve cut off the avocado in my prefer dish and was not possible to have one also I was willing to pay plus for it.
Salt cioccolate must to try."
good food and nice environment,"good coffee, good wings, food is generally quite okay. meat can be more tender. burger can be softer. some light music will be nicer."
It’s alright,Used to be better in terms of food. Truffle fries was better last year. But service was good. Was hoping that the Brunch menu can be extended to dinner timing.
Bonjour~,Food was presentable and tasty. Staffs were very heart warming and friendly despite long wait for my lychee cake due to system error missing out this particular item.
I’m definitely sticking to desserts.,"Always had dessert and coffee here. One night my Friend and I decided to have dinner here and was left in shock. The Nachos Cheese Fries was great! A tad salty but nevertheless yummy! Eat it while it’s hot! The mains however fell short, slow cooked pork with truffle mash was a microwaved bowl disaster. And their fish and chips although it looked appetising the batter was completely tasteless. I was curious what others thought about the food here and went to read up on reviews and concluded that we came on a very bad day. Chef was probably down with the flu or something.

Service was slow but there was this one guy that made an effort to ask how was everything and actually took off one dish from our bill and apologised about the food."
Great honey wings but always packed!,"It's not a chilled place. The noise inside is constantly loud with chatter and high turnover as it is crowded. There's mostly, a queue but not a long wait to be seated. Not recommended if you want a quiet and relaxed meal.

No covered shelter from the nearest Kovan Mrt station. Bring an umbrella in case it rains!"
Lola with my Chica :),"Meal: Ordered a long black and Crab Cake Egg Benedict. It is a perfect brunch combination. Flavourful and delicious.

Ambience: It's a small but cosy cafe atmosphere. The table is comfortable for two and it is a stool sit down place. But I was very pleasantly surprised when the staff changed my seat to a chair with a back (on request) and they brought a cushion. See these are the gestures and care makes it worth it.

Cost: Reasonably priced for Kovan area. ($$)"
cool neighbourhood cafe,love the desserts here. n nett prce with water! nice staff and cool decor. i would highly recommend this place for family or friends.
Excellent in all ways..,Excellent in food... Excellent in service... Excellent in atmosphere... Excellent in all ways... Highly recommended to all...
