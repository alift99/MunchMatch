"Treat yourself to cake and coffee, be happy.","Every business you enter makes you feel a certain way. When my family and I walked into The Fabulous Baker Boy we felt welcomed and relaxed. Once we sat and ordered our food and drinks we had a look around the shop and were instantly tempted by the deliciousness of the mouth watering cakes on display. The hardest part of experience was choosing which cake to have. Highly recommended for everyone who enjoys great food, coffee and awesome cake in a lovely space.
We’ll definitely be back.

Bandung and Lychee cake is so good!❤️,"We had all our favourites last night, the beef rib was excellent, fall off the bone succulence. Thoroughly enjoyed the seafood pasta dish with crayfish. Tried the new Bandung and Lychee cake, it was so light and fresh with real fruit and a delicate note of rose, loved it, ordered one whole cake for my sisters birthday!"
Must Try For The Cakes,"First time at the new location at Aliwal Street. Lovely place with delicious cakes. We ordered the Keanu Reeves (lemon with cream), which was super light and tasty, as well as the carrot cake, which was excellent. They have a less sweet version of the carrot cake called Hummingbird. Do also try their cheesecakes.

The fish and chips was also pretty good. The fish tasted fresh and the batter was light, if a tad oily. The fries were done just right.

We will definitely be back. Service, especially by Q the petite lady server was excellent."
The best almond croissant!,"Had a great piece of cheesecake and a very good cafe latte at the cafe then picked up some bread and pastry for the fridge and freezer yesterday. Broke up the big loaf of sour dough (yes they will slice it for you) into smaller packages. Cling wrapped and froze. Kept 2 almond croissants in the fridge for our breakfast today. Heated up oven 170 degrees (oven toasters would work too) popped them in for 10mins and had the best ever almond croissant! It was light, flakey, almondy, buttery, ate every last crumb! Well done Fabulous Baker Boy!"
Obnoxious service,"Nothing Fabulous about this place. It has got to be the rudest and most obnoxious “manager” ever encountered along with terrible service. They took 15 mins to put together a latte to go and then forgot to pack the chocolate cake. The “manager” who stood behind the payment register (3:30 pm on Sunday Aug 29th) when told by me, that his staff is a little confused and if he could clarify that I had ordered a cake, kept yelling “chill chill” in a raised voice. It seemed like he was talking to himself. He refused to give me his name so I could write to the concerned owners and bring this their attention. He also turned away 2 groups of people ahead of me for no reservations despite four tables empty. I won’t comment on that since I don’t know their policy. But net net the cake and coffee will never offset rude, obnoxious and ridiculous service. Avoid until they can get the right people in place."
Fab Food for Fab Company!,A lovely diner nestled in the Kampong Glam arts and heritage district. An ideal spot to chill-out or for good conversations.
Fabulous Baker Boy,"Friday March 12th I arranged a Walk to Coffee/Cake Morning for a group of friends.
We had heard about the new venue and wanted to check it out, we figured if we walked first we could justify the calorie intake

We booked a table for 8pax and were greeted very warmly by the staff.
They were extremely friendly, informative and helpful, giving us full descriptions of the menu and even patiently taking group photos for us!

Juwanda, owner, came over to chat also which was a lovely touch! A great guy with a fun energetic presence!!

We ordered several different cake slices which were all delicious, and several ordered extra slices to take home also.

We all rated this Cafe 10/10 and will definitely be returning.

Note: They take orders online and deliver!"
Final visit in early July,"I came back here for a final visit in early July, a gap of some 4 months since my last visit in March. Unfortunately this was for the last time as the Baker Boy is all done for now.

Opted for the carrot soup and the fish and chips with some cake shared for dessert. Surprisingly busy for a weekday lunchtime, but understandable given the imminent closure. Hopefully they will find new premises soon and start again!"
"Final Dining @ FabulousBakerBoys, Fort Canning","I would like to give an excellent rating even though FBB is open for 3 weeks (since it was closed over pandemic) . I have been a follower and occasional diner. FBB never fail to impress me - their food, desserts and the atmosphere. Gonna miss FBB at Fort Canning big time.!"
Not nice,"Oh wow. I don’t think Covid is why this place is closing. I think it’s because the food really is rubbish. Chicken & Waffles was really dry, Garlic fries with Truffle Mayo came with what seemed like a plain mayo - maybe it had a drop of truffle oil. Fish goujons weren’t nice and the Laksa Prawn thing wasn’t nice either.

I mean usually some places are hit n miss and out of 4, your get maybe 1-2 tasty dishes. But I’m sorry to say that this wasn’t the case.

Rumour has it that this place is famous for cakes, but I didn’t bother staying to try."
Please don’t go!,The food is always great and doesn’t disappoint! I went two days in a row with different people and plan to go a few times more before they shut in July. I really hope the restaurant decides not to shut or at least be able to find another location. This has always been our go-to place that encourages us to walk/run to Fort Canning and treat ourselves to a yummy meal thereafter!
Hidden gem,"We spent the morning exploring Fort Canning Park and then stumbled across this cafe for lunch. It's quite small and the ordering system is odd, especially when the staff offer no explanation. Once we worked out how to order, the meals were delicious. Staff could be a little more friendly."
Tasty food,"I came here for some afternoon tea in Feb and then visited again in March for a lunch. The food was really very good quality, and the free-flow bread an added bonus. You definitely won't walk away hungry from here after lunch."
Good food but very noisy,"We came here one day for brunch at the weekend but we had not reserved a table, but they managed to get us seated in 10mins, I'd highly recommend reserving a table.

You order by ticking a menu sheet, then the staff collects (or you take to the till?) and present you with a receipt and then you can get up to pay. However, we did not have any menu sheets or pencils, but our waitress did this for us quickly when I flagged her down.

I had the French toast which was amazing, like deep fried bread encrusted with cinnamon sugar.

We found the restaurant incredibly loud and deafening and were unable to have a conversation without shouting. The restaurant was 80% full but equally it may have been the walls, amplifying the sounds."
"Decent carrot cake, overpriced coffee","The Fabulous Bakery Boy is a cute cafe that serves up breakfast, lunch, coffees, tea, and cakes. I went specifically for the carrot cake, and it was certainly quite tasty compared to other slices you can find in Asia. It was moist and sweet, but could have used more spice. The iced coffee I got on the side was very pricey, and I would recommend sticking to the cakes."
"Good food, terribly unhelpful and unfriendly staff","If the staff is accommodating enough to let you in and help you the food is pretty good. But they generally have a lot of ‘reserved’ tables empty and won’t let walk ins even for just a coffee. They are rude and just say need reservations. Typical Singapore customer service, empty venue but don’t seat people. Seems easy to say here is a table but you need to be done in an hour for another customer. But that would require someone to make an effort."
Great cafe near Fort Canning,"Great cafe near Fort Canning MRT station and on the edge of the gorgeous Fort Canning park. They do all their own baking, the coffee is excellent (if quite expensive at $6.50 for a regular flat white) but food is high quality, fresh ingredients, made with love and very good value. Nice low-key vibe, good place to come to for a chat with a friend or to chill with a book or magazine."
A MUST!,"We went there for Breakfast, and it was very delicious & tasty! The pancakes are a MUST! The staff are really nice."
Over rated,"Nice location but not as good as some say. Ordered two full breakfasts and pancakes. Both breakfasts were cold, with soggy cold roast potatoes. The only thing that was hot where the poached eggs. Clearly good quality ingredients but cooked badly.
Also very small cups given for tea and coffee. Generally average and expensive."
"Good food, but slow","Always enjoy eating breakfast here. There is a good selection of indulgent vs healthy items (the French toast is more like a sugar-covered donut). But for our table of five, our orders came out one at a time even though we ordered 2 of the same items. If you have hungry kids, it doesn't really work out well if they get their food one at a time."
"Nice ambiance, fast service and nice food",Service is fast and responsive. Have quite a number of cakes choices and the food is nice also. The restaurant has a nice surrounding.
"Great location, Above average food, Overpriced drinks","Location was great, within a closed compound where kids can run free on the lawn in front. Food was above average, tasty but nothing to write home about. Cakes were fabulous, just a tad sweet. Drinks were atrociously overpriced. $8 for a small cup of hot chocolate, and $6 for a small long black. I’ll bring my own coffee next time, thank you."
Waiting time too long !,"Waited almost 45min to be served and finally end up with sharing every dish that came one after another.
Staff seemed not very concerned about the waiting time, the manager neither !

Food was OK, didn’t get the chance to try the Pancakes as staff told that there were 20min waiting time !"
Delicious cakes!,The cakes were moist and not too sweet! It was a beautiful burst of flavors for each cake. Each one has its own unique taste! Will head back again for more!
Average food in a different location,"A different location at the River Valley Rd side of Fort Canning park. The entry was tricky to find as there is construction before it and the fences make it difficult to see the entry, which is on a busy thoroughfare road. The food was ok, my daughters grilled cheese sandwich could have done with far less oil/butter on the bread as it ended up very greasy. My eggs bene with smoked salmon was good and the Hollandaise sauce had a good lemony tang. The accompanying rosemary potatoes weren't good, tasting metallic and dried rosemary was used, rather than fresh, which contributed to the flavour issue. I left most of them on my plate uneaten. My daughter rated the Valrhona hot chocolate as the best she has found in Singapore. I concur. The cakes looked fabulous, but we couldn't eat any more so didn't get to try any of them."
Fantastic Breakfast,"Really amazing eggs benny, to go with great staff and service. Was a perfect breakfast with friends."
Not recommended for breakfast,"The location and service were nice. But we were very disappointed from the food, especially because of the high prices. We had a granola with yogurt that was tiny. We also had french toasts, which I really don't recommend. It was deep fried, too sweet (and I like sweet), I couldnt even eat a half of it.
Maybe the cakes are good, we didnt try, but the breakfast was really not good. We left hungry and with a big bill to pay."
Afternoon cake,"We were there at around 14:45 so we just had cake and coffee. The price of the coffee was a bit steep but it was the first black coffee that wasn't watered down.

The cake selection was nice and the names fun. One slice of Bette Middler (if I remember correctly): it had a nice Earl Grey flavour mixed with berry cream, and one slice of George Clooney, which had a nice coffee flavour to it. The prices were around 9 SGD per slice but I think it was worth the visit on a lazy afternoon.

The place is also quite pretty and serene."
Disappointing!,"Don’t eat the French toast here unless you have a cardiology appointment booked! It is more like a massive fatty donut, dry and overly sweet- I could feel my coronary arteries clogging up as I ate it! Vegan pancakes were sadly not available which disappointed my vegan daughter. Eggs Benedict was fine, and reasonably priced. Service was fine too. Would never go back, felt sick for rest of day, shouldn’t have eaten the French toast!!!"
Disappointing,"The location is serene and had a nice vibe

The cakes were far off the mark. They were bad. The sugee cake had a pound cake taste and didn't taste good.

The Obama cake was equally as bad. The density of the cake and the cream.

Bottomine, having the title 'fabulous' next to 'baker boy' MUST mean something...if not it comes across as being embarrassing."
Great cake selection,"The cake selection here is impressive and the display really sends you into indecisiveness. Thankfully, the cakes taste as good as they look. The premises are nostalgic as the cafe is housed at the old River Valley swimming pool, where I had swimming lessons as a kid. It's also a good place for a break before/after visiting Fort Canning hill. Recommended."
Not a great breakfast,"Hollandaise too vinegary,undercooked potatoes on the side, too much weird cream cheese sauce on the pancakes, coffee a bit weak and lukewarm, Ed Sheeran played much too loudly for first thing in the morning with only one table of customers. Oh and a surly waiter staring intently at my boyfriend for much too long. Bill nearly 100 bucks for three people. I wished we'd gone elsewhere for our last breakfast in Singapore."
Food was disappointing but location is nice!,"Went to Fabulous Baker boy in Fort canning foot hills and was expecting to have a nice breakfast in a good environment with a good friend on saturday morning.

Chope website shows it opens at 8am but the opening hours is actually from 8.30am. Do take note not to go too early.

We were the first guest to arrive at the restaurant but the staff was not accommodating in our request to seat at a window table and was kind of curt in her response that the seats are planned that way due to different booking schedules. Only thing i like to point out though the restaurant was never more than half filled the whole time i was there from 8.30am to 10.30am and the seat we actually wanted was not occupied all all from 8.30am all the way till i left the cafe.

Agree with 1 of the previous reviewers(i should have read first before coming but i typically like to come to a restaurant with an open mind), the french toast was horrible. it was deep fried with a banter that resembles a fish and chip battle. very oily and honestly worst french toast i have ever tasted, I was lucky i asked for sugar and syrup to be separate which helped on the sweetness of the french toast since it was not drenched but the dish is definitely a 0 out of 5.

Friend ordered an eggs benedict which wasn't great but definitely more edible.

Total bill came up to 40+ for french toast and eggs benedict + 2 coffees. the starbucks breakfast menu we saw when we walked past Starbucks in Liang court at $6.50 is half priced and looks way more appetizing that what Fabulous Baker Boy served up."
Very sugary breakfast,"Whatever you do avoid the French toast! This was drenched in sugar and deep fried like a doughnut which I hate. The granola was good as was the sourdough toast and pancakes, shame about my French toast which gave me indigestion all day. Nice location."
Love it,"It is not crowded on weekend nights and a nice place for dinner dates! Their chicken and waffle, tomato soup, crab mac n' cheese was awesome"
Fabulous food serve and wide options of cakes!,"I have fallen in love with The Fab Baker Boy!! I had the Chef Recommended Pancakes and it was honestly yummmzzz...Reasonably price, decent cozy space hence a little noisy but it is a great place still to catch up with friends over food. The place serves alcohol but the food are halal source hence, a great alternative place for a group of Muslim and non-Muslim to hang out."
"Good location, good service, good coffee, average food !",Very nicely located at Fort Canning. Staff is nice and caring. My coffee was the only highlight and probably the agli olio pasta and tomato soup both were nice. However our French toast as well as the sandwich were Super deep fried with too much oil ( almost dripping !). Did not try their cakes / cookies but they looked nice. Overall on expensive side ( Pasta for 20$! )
Slow service and mediocre food,It was rather hard to get the attention of staff and our food and drinks took really long to come. The restaurant was not full at that time so we are not sure why. Food was nothing to rave about.
Awesome ambience and food!,The cafe is nestled in city's oldest fort. A little hideaway from the hustle and bustle of the city and close to nature. The serving of breakfast was generous. The cinnamon sugared fluffy toast tasted like churros. The raspberry pancakes were light and soft. Delicious food!
A must see,"The place is located next to Fort Canning Park and it’s surrounded by nature. The design is cozy and quite minimalist. The service and food was excellent: I had a cappuccino and raspberry pancakes (the food size is quite large so I wouldn’t suggest it if you are on a diet ).
It’s the perfect spot to spend an afternoon with friends or keeping up with your homework.
See you soon fabulous baker boy!"
"Very long waiting time, wrong items delivered","The waiting time to receive a coffee with a scoop of ice-cream was really super long. Then when it finally arrived, it was another than ordered, but I said I can still take it not to wait again so long. However I asked for a spoon which they could not give me. Sadly but won't return with such bad service..."
Review,Food was excellent. But waiting time was too Long. We waited around 45mins to an hr for the food to be served.
Great teatime place,Great place to have afternoon tea and kids can play at the outdoor playground. Wonderful to relax while the kids are having fun too.
Nothing much to shout about,"Overall experience was average but downgraded to below average due to the high price. The cakes looked nice but taste wise, is nothing better than any of those outside (in the same price bracket, to be fair). The place gets loud during peak time and could really do with some sound dampening material."
"Loved the coffee, main course and CAKE","Firstly - the locations is great... facing the park...So be prepared to have families - with young kids in the eatery over weekends. So, yes it does get rather crowded and noise..

The service and food was excellent.. If you are not a big eater- one platter will easily feed two people. We had the egg benedict - which was great and lattes - that were excellent... But the award goes to the blueberry lemon cake ...amazing ....

All the cakes look so good - and are actually very reasonably priced. Do make reservations in advance to avoid disappointment."
Average,"Location is a good one being located at the entrance of the Fort Canning Park. Menu looked good. We had the eggs Benedictine, French toast with sausages and bacon, and then the cinnamon roll pancakes. Sausages looked like they were hot dog sausages. Service was kind of not great."
Delicious sourdough,"Located the cafe opposite Liang Court at the Foothill. A couple of items we had chosen from the menu was not available that day and we settled for the duck confit, baked salmon and a side order of sourdough bread. The food did not disappoint but the highlight for us was the sourdough bread. Served well toasted and eaten with butter was delicious. A must try for all sourdough bread lovers. For dessert we had the orange marmalade cake. The sponge was a bit too drenched with marmalade or syrup for my liking. Will definitely try the other cakes the next time."
Nice experience,"Popped in for lunch as we were doing a walk around Fort Canning park. There were only three tables used when we arrived, but it started to fill up fast during the lunch break. So reservations are suggested, especially for the weekend.

Service was pretty good and the team of servers were friendly, if a little disorganized. E.g. An order for another table was sent to us.

We ordered the BBQ short ribs ($30) and it was a generous portion and definitely to be shared. The meat was cooked almost to fall off the bone perfection, but was a little too sweet. The fries were also slightly underdone, but the coleslaw was nice.

The sweet CYN pancakes ($13.50) were pretty good, Nd we loved the combination of chopped walnuts and cinnamon. The Jacintha cake ($9) which was a coconut-pandan was a generous portion to share as well, and was not too bad. It went well with the flat white.

Overall, it was a good experience and we are coming back with friends. Just wish that some menu items like corned beef hash was available."
Cosy cafe w friendly staffs,The brunch is Fabulous! The huge range of cakes selections can be a headache at times🤤 definitely recommend this cafe if you’re in clarke quay area!
Not very Fabulous...,"We had to wait 1 hour for 2 fried eggs for our toddler and 4 year old. And we had to wait at least 40 min before any food arrived at all. Why? Because the restaurant was too busy and there was a misunderstanding about the order - according to the owner. There were still 4x4 tables available, the staff taking the order only telling us after 55 minutes that we couldn't order 2 fried eggs (they had to be pouched!) and smoked salmon, and of course it would be busy - it is Saturday and they have just opened a massive playground next door! The worst thing was the owner said he didn't care getting a bad review, ha! wow! Ok, how about apologize instead and telling off the staff running around like headless chickens?! At least he didn't charge us for the two fried eggs that finally arrived..."
First and the last time,"There is no good way to structure this review, so I will break it down into 3 main portions: service, food and atmosphere.

Service: Horrible. We were greeted by someone who obviously was either having a bad day or hated their job. Not something you should be putting on in the service sector and it was most of the staff who were there who really did not want to be there. The worst part of our experience was that we were only served our food almost an hour after our order was taken (time stamp on the receipt).

We were only apologised to when we questioned why the food was taking so long. We were a table of 6, with just 5 dishes between us. The servers informed us that they had a large number of orders before us but honestly if you cant operate at full capacity then reduce your capacity, also the cafe wasnt even full at this point. We accepted that initially but we then notice that other guests who arrived later than us were getting food and we got more and more upset.

Food: Nothing to shout about, at this point we really just wanted to eat and get out of there. Come on a weekday, I am sure you would be able to get your food on time. For the price you pay here there is better out there.

Atmosphere: Busy but not full. Nice location but on weekends its full of families with young children that enjoying screaming very much and annoying everyone.

Even though we were offered a 1 slice of cake (for 6 of us) for the hour long wait, that could not redeem how everything was handled. I would suggest if you want to come here, a weekday would be best cause I guess the operate optimally when there are just 2 tables? Honestly, for a cafe that has been there for a while I am very surprised they couldn't handle a Sunday crowd. The reason they gave us were there were many orders before us, so this is not an inference that I am offering."
Food -,"Well I’ll start my review on a good note I had eggs on toast (the eggs Benni had potato and no bacon/ham) which gave me disappointment straight up, so I just went simple

Lerch the 6ft male waitress with a man bun grunted at my wife and I and placed an order form infront of us on a small clip board.

A kind Singaporean gentle man walked over a few minutes later after we stared at the paper in a wtf trance and verbally took our order.

The food came out quiet fast, which was great.

the poached eggs tasted great and the toast was better then I’d tasted in other places,

Also the place is a pain to get to - would I visit again ?

Add bacon and ham and loose the tick sheet and then probably."
The Sourdough God of Singapore,"I came across the ‘Fabulous Baker God’ (FBG) when struggling to make sourdough in Singapore and doing some background reading on line. After failing dismally, at all hurdles, I ordered a couple of loaves from the FBG on line. When collecting the bread we stayed for pancakes and coffee. The pancakes were to die for (according to my ‘food critic’ friend (he sees it & eats it if it’s put in his path!) the coffee was one of the best I have had in Singapore and having witnessed the bowls of treats arriving at the tables around us, everything else was prepared with equal finesse and dedication. In fact, we are returning for more of the same today!

Not only is it a lovely cool, peaceful, space on the edge of Fort Canning grounds, the FBG offered out heaps of tips for baking sourdough in humid/hot climates but he also offered us some of his starter. I declined but after another failed attempt to make some lat night, I might have to take him up on that offer. I have mastered the technique back home in the UK and I love the Sourdough as my guts can tolerate it whereas they can’t cope with any other bread but out here, it’s another challenge all together.

Thank you FBG"
Great ambience and service,This was my second visit to the Fabulous Baker Boy. We'd made our reservation through Chope and were efficiently seated and served. The ambience of this café is wonderful with lots of natural light. The hard surfaces all around does make it a bit noisy when it's full... and it was full on the day! (Note to management... consider getting some fabrics on the walls to absorb the sound... it'll make it much nicer an environment). Service was prompt and they were quite flexible. I'd made the mistake of ordering French Toast without appreciating that it was sweet (and not savoury like how I expect them to be). The French Toast was a bit too sweet. The coffee was great.
The French Toast,"The french toast is so good. It's like eating a beignet, incredibly unhealthy but every bite is wonderful. The full breakfast is huge and good, I couldn't finish it. I would definitely eat here again."
The NOT Fabulous Baker Boy,"We visited here for breakfast having read the reviews that there were four varieities of eggs benedict. Well, we love our eggs benedict so my wife thought she would give this a try. There were only two varieities and we had to wait 40 minutes for them (only 5 people in the restaurant) and the eggs were hard boiled not hard poached. Never in our life have we had the eggs anything but soft. I had the crepes and they were horrible - not soft and fluffy as per the menu but rubbery and cold. They were not nice. Then, the coffee - 2 extra hot flat whites turned out to be warm lattes. The prices for everything weren't cheap or medium but high. Terrible breakfast spoilt our start to the day."
Inattentive staff,"Rarely in F&B nowadays u see such a good number to staff to customers ratio but still staff were not attentive. The boss of the place had to even let out a little shout for them to pay attention instead of crowding round the cash register chit chatting. I choose this place cos I heard of rave reviews. But sad to say, food was lacklusture and the poor plating didn’t help to boost our visual appetites either. Due to the location of this plc, I wouldn’t visit again especially when nothing was memorable enough for me to walk over from Liang Court for parking.

This might be better off as an online cakery for their bakes."
Nice for coffee and cake but...,"Coffee over $6 for a small cup, ridiculously over priced and not even hot as requested. The cakes are wonderful, but the French toast fried in batter yuk, the chicken and cheese sandwich had very little chicken, lots of cheese. A nice spot to sit for cake, but we did not enjoy our meal. Home made brioche is good. The staff were slow and uneven in service. We had to ask for help to get menus. Our order was not taken, had to do it ourselves, but noticed others were served? The staff stood around chatting for a large time. Some training is required."
Fabulous breakfast,After a walk in Fort Canning Park the cold airconditioning was welcoming at Fabulous Baker Boys. The granola with vanilla bean yoghurt was excellent. The pancakes with cream and pecans were delicious too!
Good Food But Very Long Wait For Food,"Visited The Fab Baker Boy on a weekday lunch, so there weren't many people there. I ordered the fish & chips (as I heard that it was good) and my wife had the salmon (in a mango hollandaise with mashed potatoes).

Considering that it was not crowded at the time, we were a little confused as we had to wait nearly 40mins for our food.

However, when the food did arrive, we were pleased to find it was worth the wait. My fish was fried perfectly, moist on the inside but the batter waslight and crispy. My wife's salmon was not overcooked. Generous amounts of fries and mash and salad. Maybe the only set back for me was the tartar sauce that was served with fish & chips. I didn't like that it was spicy (I love spicy food but to me it just didn't go well together).

The wait is the only thing holding back my fifth star. And it was a shame we didn't have room for cake for dessert."
Unusually good Eggs Benedict,This lovely restaurant located in a sweet park rewarded me with a tasty Salmon Benedict on a home baked brioche bread. Boy was it good and the chef told me the sauce had no butter! He only uses olive oil which added to a smooth lemon flavor. My wife ordered the french toast which was truly a memorable dish also made from brioche. A great little find in Singapore.
The best brunch fare,"Great casual setting, friendly service, FANTABULOUS food. Definitely trey the French toast, pancakes, and eggs benedict. We were bummed that they ran out of corned beef hash."
Good brunch and lovely location,"I brought a friend who was visiting from Canada and he absolutely loved the food and the location. It was brunch so we ordered the corned beef hash and the eggs benedict. The corned beef hash was delicious though the salmon with the eggs benedict was a little on the salty side but acceptable.Couldn't resist ordering the croissants which were great - crisp on the outside and fluffy inside - and they were generous when my friend asked for more butter! Staff were very friendly as well!Things they can improve on : more flexibility with the salad dressing (they only had balsamic), train staff to better describe dishes and perhaps make recommendations."
Awesome breakfast,"Awesome breakfast and atmosphere, located in beautiful Fort Canning Park. It can get busy and noisy, great for kids as they provide colouring. The service can be a bit slow when busy but it’s worth the wait."
Can my heart be quiet and NOT RAVE..?,"One has to really admire the manifesto behind the French Toast at this bakery cum cafe - I could ‘swim’ in the bursting flavours after sinking my teeth on them.Along with my compradre ( who has been nothing but brave the previous night to weather my stormy stomach avalanches), he agrees as well while they are a tad too sweet - they are still a dream to savour. Dreams do come true. At least at The Fabulous Baker."
Not for hungry people,"Tried here twice, in morning, it smells bread, at nigh, it smells garlic.Food took half an hour before it was served. it taste good but a bit pricey."
Delicious food and very accommodating staff,"Looking for a simple international breakfast having feasted on Eastern fare for a few days. Stumbled across this fantastic little restaurant. Set amongst a green space with basic playground for the kids. The site is perfectly situated next to bustling Clarke quay and is a tranquil departure from it. The breakfast here was high quality: eggs benny on brioche, really tasty pancakes and plenty of them. The coffee was proper and the serving team very accommodating, no booking, three young children and one broken glass later. Would highly recommend if you're in need of an international type breakfast."
Great Stop For Lunch,A short but good varied selection for breakfast through to afternoon tea. Very tasty and well prepared.
Excuse after excuse,5 meals brought out over an hour at different times. The smallest meal being the last. Trainee waiter was making excuses for kitchen staff which is unfair to trainee. Kitchen not fully stocked and some choices not available. So a notice needs to be provided before clients chooses.
Amazing,"With fabulous pastries, cakes and fabulous coffee to go with them how could The Fabulous Baker Boy go wrong? He doesn’t! Best coffee and pastries in Singapore!"
Overrated,We were greeted by very unwelcoming cannot be bothered staff. It seems like she doesnt like working on that day. I ordered the the most disgusting french toast. It was deep fried! You can taste the overly used frying oil in every bite! I tried my best to eat but i really cannot stomach that food!
One of the best carrot cake,"Been there for brunch before and having good experience. Love their carrot cake specially. Soft and taste really good, one of my top choice for cake Place. Love the place too as it is inside fort caning Park"
Absolutely Fabulous!,"Our party of 4 was here to celebrate a friend's birthday over lunch. The breakfast menu is such a treat with gudetama-esque eggs! The salmon was so well prepared and definitely one of the best I 've had! The cake selection, of course, to-die for! We had the strawberry yoghurt cake and Takeshi-san. Takeshi-san was a little intense even for us asian girls.Great service and atmosphere and will definitely plan another visit here"
Good food,"I enjoyed the food and location. The staff are friendly and responsive. The only quibble I have is that not all the food in our group arrived at the same time, so we were unable to eat together."
Amazing Pancakes,Superb pancakes! 2nd time here.. tried 70% cacao pancake! fluffy and light! The Cynth is though preferred one.. delicious combination of cinnamon and cream!
Heads up 2,"Basically the guy inside told us that the place was closed for dinner and did not offer any explanation before closing the door.

Guy: are you Jen?
Me: no..? (confused)
Guy: we are closed for dinner today
Me: ... closed?
Guy: Ya *closes door*

Even after knocking on the door afterwards, the guy and girl who was cleaning right in front of us ignored it.

After reading the reviews, I found others with similar experiences so please proceed with caution. Do not go to this place expecting decent service (or any at all)."
Great Cakes,"I enjoyed the easy atmosphere and lovely cakes they bake here. The owner was especially friendly and hospitable and they have a great selection of bakes. Nicely tucked away at a scenic spot - service staff were friendly and prompt, with good initiative. Thanks for a nice afternoon experience!"
Pleasant Experience,Good atmosphere with great food. A place where family and friends and hangout all day from brunch to tea....
Great cakes,Nice walk in the park from fort canning mrt The cakes were delicious.. about $9-12 per slice which isn’t out of line fo Singapore. Coffees not the best but still ok!
"Great location, but ruined by poor service and overcharging for food.","We went for breakfast and let disappointed. The location and ambience are good,with 5 staff milling around, we had to raise our hands to get service. When we did order, my wifes meal arrived 5 minutes before mine. The coffee was nice but again overpriced.
Its a pity actually, because with a little more attention to the actual customer, and not trying to over charge on food, it would probably be a lot busier."
Nice setting but meh food,"Pluses: opens relatively early (8.30am) (such a dearth of cafes opening before 9am — I mean, do I have to starve for two hours before having a coffee and some breakfast?); set in the former River Valley swimming pool now converted to a small park at the foot of Fort Canning; lots of open space outside the cafe for kids to run about (if they actually want to!); next to MRT station; a place to cool down after a walk in the under-visited Fort Canning Park. Minuses: food was amateurishly horrid. No sourdough, ok, but replacement bread was stale and definitely not freshly baked that morning, corned beef hash was overly salted and overpriced, pancakes were ok but buttermilk drizzle was poor (not even properly whisked), cinnamon pancakes were fried (!?)), coffee was way overpriced for something very generic ($6 and up). Won’t ever return. Would rather head across to Liang Court for some other cafes"
Nice cakes but overly priced,"Enjoyed my dinner at this restaurant. We ordered some fish fillet side dish, a chicken sandwich, chicken pot pie and 2 dessert cakes.

The side dish was great and crispy. The main dishes are not too bad. Only thing we feel that is not that great is the sandwich was too hard to bite. The chicken pot pie is nice.

For desserts, we ordered a red velvet and chocolate cake. The red velvet cake is very soft and not dry. Texture is nice. The chocolate cake is nice and creamy too.

The overall experience is quite pleasant. The restaurant is small and cosy. Staffs are friendly and the waiting time for the food is not very long. The restaurant serves dinner only at 6pm. Price wise I feel it is a little overly priced for all food and I think it is not that worth it.

Getting to this place is pretty easy if you are taking train. Stop at Fort Canning MRT Station and take Exit B. Once up, just walk towards the park entrance and you should be able to see the fabulous baker boy signboard. Just follow through the path of the entrance, turn to the right side and just walk down. You should see the restaurant within a minutes' walk."
great food,food was fantastic! pancakes were super delicious! french toast was excellent too. Will def return for a second round.
Best French Toast,I made this trip again to have the French Toast. It's delicious! Crisp on the outside and soft on the inside as all French Toast should be. The corn beef hash was average.
So so,The food was alright. But nothing fantastic. Will probably return only for the cakes. That’s probably their specialty anyway.
Heads up,"Long story short, the owner kicked out his customer because I guess he has too much ego and cannot even take the basic conversation manners like when the other is already saying something, listen first and do not talk.

Detail is below.

I was there on Sunday.
2 days ago, I made a phone call and asked if the reservation is needed. the guy took the call said there will be an event so last order will be 11:30 but we can stay after that. just the kitchen will be closed. Also, he mentioned the reservation is not needed.

So I came in around 11 but the other guy said the kitchen is already closed and they cannot accommodate us. I told him that is not what I heard from phone call but he did not try to check more or did not even apologize yet he kept repeating they are closed. Even I told him his colleague confirmed no reservation needed, he asked me again if I made a reservation. seems this was going nowhere. So I asked the manager. This manager also kept repeating that there is nothing he can do about this and they posted this on their instagram and facebook. As if this was my fault because I don't follow them on SNS..?

And then the owner showed up. He apologized but he did not stop talking, while I was addressing my frustration. So I told him if you are really sorry, you wouldn't keep interrupting me while I was talking. And then he said, you post this online whatever, we don't serve you, you gotta leave.

I did not scream and did not do anything inappropriate yet he kicked out his customer like that. So this is heads up for others what to expect from here."
Sunday Brunch was an excellent choice,"Four of us descended hungry to have a hearty meal and we did.
French toast berries
Summer tomato salad
Corned beef hash
Cheese sandwich
Sunny egg
Soup of the day
Espressos and white ginger lily

We left happy. Service was good. We watched the baker next door making lethal cakes and pastries. Stayed away!
All in was S$100."
"Please note this review is for the Lunch, not about the Cakes as they looked good, it's the rest..","Again, the cakes looked amazing and I'm sure they are good but we went for lunch there and not to eat sweet treats as the brunch menu looked good. I ordered the eggs Benedict with sauteed spinach and hollandaise sauce, a side of mushrooms and a kiwi and lemon juice.

I specifically asked the waiter for no black pepper on my meal, he said there may be a bit in the spinach if it's already prepared, either way I said none anywhere else. The whole meal came COVERED IN BLACK PEPPER! the potatoes on the side had loads of pepper all over them and in the mushrooms there was some too. The spinach was chewy and slightly dry, and the hollandaise was tasteless and there wasn't much of it either.

The juice was the biggest other disappointment, I didn't actually check the price of it which was my fault as I'm used to fresh pressed juices being 6 - 8 dollars in Singapore overall so didn't think much of it. Not only did it taste like pure lemon juice, not a trace of kiwi in there and if there was (it did have a green color) then the ratio was way off! tart and sour and way too strong on the lemon front, but when I checked the bill. to my horror it cost 12 dollars!!! Ridiculously overpriced for a glass of squeezed lemon juice.

As I said, I'm sure the cakes are good but if you want a decent and well priced brunch, go elsewhere trust me!!"
Brunch is not enough,I love brunches and lunches at this place! Coffee is awesome and you can never leave without trying their cakes!...every time a different cake! Best weekend habit ever!
Excellent quality for money and service with a smile,"We spent fathers'day breakfast here and enjoyed ourselves. The kids got to make a drawing and we had an excellent cup of coffee while we waited for the food. All four ordered something different and we were all very happy with what we got. The portions are quite big so no need for lunch anymore... We advise you to make a reservation as they keep tables blocked for the people who do, even when they only arrive in an hour. So even though it might not look full, it is fully booked."
Nice but....,"Overall a nice cafe-restaurant. Sourdough bread is made in-house and the coffee is really good. The service is good too but the overall vibe just feels “cold”, like there’s no love...."
"As the name suggests, ‘Fabulous’","What a lovely place to take a break from the hustle and bustle or rest you feet after walking around Fort Canning Park.
Best coffee I have had when visiting Singapore, and the best selection of delicious cakes.
Small playground outside for children to play on."
Wrong order but OK,"We reached there at noon time and there were already 2 big groups of diners, so it took us a long while before the food came to us.

We ordered a slice of cake, chilli crab mac & cheese and kampung chicken pie, and of course a cup of coffee after meal. However, it took us almost 2 hours to find out that the waiter put a wrong order for us, despite our few rounds checking for our food arrival. We were quite disappointed and at the end, we wanted to cancel the rest of the orders, except the cake (we had the cake soon after our arrival). The waiter, who was an intern, was very professional and friendly, compensated us with a bowl of mushroom soup. When we were about to cancel the meal order, the food arrived but we still cancelled the coffee order as we were in a rush to leave Singapore.

To be honest, the food especially the chilli crab mac & cheese was special, but I would not say it was nice. The food was normal and we don't think we will be there again. Nevertheless, a thumbs up for the intern waiter. He was marvellous."
Overrated Underwhelmed,"The food is average and the price is above average.

Went at 11:15 and they told me they will not cook my sandwich till 11:30 cos lunch only starts at 11:30. Are you serious? You are human, please use some initiative.

Order the Beef Brisket Grilled Cheese Sandwich. I could barely see nor taste any beef nor brisket. My advice is to skip it!"
Cozy cafe,"Loved the cozy spot the cafe is located, it is in city area but surrounded by lush greenery of Fort Canning Park, which is also near to the MRT station. Great service. Drool-worthy cakes. Instagrammable interior. Free ice water. Thumbs up!"
Lovely spot for a delicious brunch,"looking for a brunch spot outside the normal mall or hotel options, we found this lovely cafe in the lovely settings of the foothills of Fort Canning. Buzzing busy on Good Friday, we booked a table for Saturday morning. Lovely pancakes, granola and smoothies."
Cakes surpass everything else,"I really have mixed feelings about this place. So I reserved a table a few weeks in advance but I many times tried to contact the cafe, asking them a few Qs but there was simply no reply. Facebook, IG, SMS, call... it makes you think that it has closed down! Then suddenly one day before my brunch, they started to reply me out of a sudden. I also think they need to sync up all their communication channels - cos it's a bit everywhere right now.

Ok, back to review on the cafe! It was easier to find than I thought, such a cute little place under the foot of Fort Canning. It was FULL when I went at 12.45, but come past 1.30pm, the cafe started to have some empty tables.

We order a coffee, a cake, eggs benedict and a sandwich. The sandwich was tiny (not very generous with the bbq beef), I had more tuna in my homemade sandwich than this and it came with a plain side salad. A bit disappointing. The eggs benedict with potatoes look much better but a bit of carbs overload. Maybe they should give some to the sandwiches! Coffee, I was told, it was alright, nothing fantastic for $6.40 (a little above average). But I must comment that the cake is worth the $9.... so soft, fresh and light. Go for the cake than anything else really.

I read the pancakes are good. Maybe another time for that but not going for the sandwiches anymore. Service is also surprisingly attentive in the cafe but they did not note down the comment I placed in the reservation obviously."
"amazing cakes, fabulous meals","Dropped in without a reservation for lunch, great range of beautiful food, really good flavours, good coffee, amzing cakes, adults and kids happy, highly recommended!"
"Friendly staff, great coffee and cakes","When we arrived there, it was already 3 in the afternoon and only cakes and coffee are available. We ordered 3 Affogato, 1 Luna, and 1 The Hossan Leong. The staff was friendly despite it being their break time."
Good food bad service,Food and cakes are good but one girls service was particularly poor. The interrupt is nice and the selection of cakes is very good
