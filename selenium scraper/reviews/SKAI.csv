Great view and service,"I had an aniversary trip with my big family. They applied my pre-request for table, and gave careful services for each family members. Especially table manager, Carmela, I want to leave the appreciate message for today!^^"
Anniversary dinner,"Had my anniversary dinner on the 21/1/23 with SKAI and I must commend Ivy for being such an attentive server. As I did not indicate it as our anniversary dinner when making the booking, she took the cue from the flowers that I gave my partner. Thank you for the complimentary cake for the occasion, it was a nice personal touch to what was already a perfect evening with SKAI- both the view, as well as the food. Am anticipating our return to dine with SKAI again. Thank you!"
Awesome brunch,Carmela. in particular was an outstanding staff. She made us feel like family and we cannot wait to return again.
A VIEW WORTH A VISIT,"I’d recommend to spend an evening on the 70th floor of the Skai, possibly the bar, not the restaurant, as the view is absolutely breathtaking.
The personnel is nice but not very well organized (e.g. if you call and ask for a table and there is not room for the time of your choice they do not suggest any other choice even if available, or it takes at least two people serving at the table so the waiter may hung around you without placing the food until the second one is available).
We had a steak, grilled at perfection indeed, a salad and the hand-cut potatoes which would have been happier if left some more time to cook.
Bread was just microwaved out of the freeze and hard as a stone."
Great spot for couples,"Would like to pay compilments to the service rendered by the restaurant: specifically service staff: CARMELA.

Thank you for your warmth smile, service and initiative to adjust good lighting angles for our photos.

Food is good with a breathtaking view.

Highly recommend for Sunday lunch."
Anniversary dinner,"The service is superb especially with Carmela; the food is likewise good and the staff are all friendly. Ambience is fabulous with a nice view.
However, it could have been a more fine-dining setting, should you have a white table cloth on your tables.
But generally, it was a good dining experience."
First visit experience - good,"The service staff Carmela is very good. She is very gentle, helpful and patient. The view from the 70th floor is captivating. We had the set lunch for 4 and reasonably good.
It has been a enjoyable experience since this is our first visit."
Amazing Experience For Farewell Dinner,"Our family had an amazing trip to Singapore, and we wanted to find a perfect way to end it before we go back home. That’s when we decided to go to Skai Restaurant. Firstly, this restaurant brought a picture perfect ambience with its floor-to-ceiling windows that (at the right time) can capture a perfect sunset. The modernity and spaciousness of the inside also helped to complement the experience. Secondly, the staff were exceptional. They demonstrated amazing professionalism and our server, Carmela, helped especially on bringing her kindness and serviceability to the table…literally! Lastly, and most importantly, the food was perfect. The meat was salted phenomenally and the sides that accompanied the dish were great. All in all, this restaurant is an amazing place to go to capture any moment, whether it’s with your family, partner, or anybody else."
Business Lunch Meeting at Skai,"It is with full confidence that I recommend Shereena as a Skai representative of the highest caliber.

She was always extremely helpful, happy and seemed to truly love her job. The ambience and food was perfect too.

The only disappointment was that we were not even informed that warmed water was chargeable at $12.
We could have opted for the sparkling water which was at the same price instead."
"Wonderful Dining Experience in the ""Skai""","Food is great! Lovely staff, attentive to the guests without being intrusive.

Commands a spectacular view."
Great food and ambience,Great food and ambience. The staff are constantly checking on us to make sure that we are ok. Will recommend to friends visiting Singapore
High tea with a view,"If you’re looking for a relaxed location to have some high tea, look no further. The weather turned on us on our last day and we had storms and lightning disrupting the view. But once it cleared, you’ll see the Marina Bay Sands, the Singapore Flyer, and much more.
The high tea options are fancy and the tea delicious. BYO water though, there’s a $3/pp charge for tap water."
Outstanding and great Experience !,"We had a 5 course wine pairing,
the food was nothing less than great
while the service was courteous and
very attentive.
It was a Christmas Eve Dinner and
all worth it
ambience is super and awesome !"
Great place to appreciate the magnificent Singapore skyline and Marina Bay,The food tastes nice especially the flatiron steak and the lamb. The ambiance is great for a special occasion especially if you want to show a magnificent view of Singapore to guests. The food is presented creatively as well. The dessert that looks like tiny bananas was really cute. They even went to the trouble of presenting it like they picked 2 from a whole bunch of bananas.
Great service by Wynelle,A great and wonderful service by Wynelle. Really made my birthday a memorable one! Thank you Wynelle! From Keon Ng
Perfect Evening...,"We walked into SKAI and realised immediately that this had all the indicators for a perfect evening.
Friendly staff ..well designed table areas...fantastic views...
Then the perfect happened...great background music at a good level which encouraged conversation, excellently attended, mostly by Carmela and Abdellah with good chats and a bit of banter...the food presentation and flavours were outstanding...wine choice for each course was superb...
The whole experience was so damn good! There's obviously a whole lot going on in the background to any success story...choice of personnel, training and personal aptitude must play their part and it shows...we loved it!"
Nice place to visit.,"The food, music, view, everything was perfect. Cocktails were nice too. Carmelia served our family prrfectly. Thanks to her our family had a lovely time."
Christmas Dinner,we were served and assisted by Carmela. food was great and the service was absolutely amazing and the crab cake for the christmas dinner was very enjoyable! the service from Carmela just topped everything off 🥰
Christmas and anniversary,"A great atmosphere and ambience here. Carmela has been an amazing part of our experience at Skai! She is extremely helpful and polite, which has made our experience here great!"
Great service,Went to Skai for a lovely Christmas dinner. Carmela did a wonderful job taking care of us. It was a great experience overall.
Christmas Day dinner,"It’s so wonderful to have our Christmas celebration in Skai. We enjoyed so much and thank you Carmela, our server for the wonderful service, she is so professional and friendly, definitely the best festive experience! Merry Christmas and thank you! :)"
Dowgraded itself so much!,"Attached is Skai's 2022 Christmas menu. Let's not talk about pricing since guests were told upfront - willing buyer, willing seller. For a S$200+ diner, guests can expect decent quality food, right? Well, I was wrong. The cod fish had a very strong ""fishy smell"" and the wagyu was very salty. To be honest, I was extremely disappointed. Went there several times before COVID. Food was ok and people went there partly for the view (I even wrote a good review about this place in 2019). This time round, food quality was BAD. Told the staff that I would not go back again. There are places in Singapore with equally good view and much better food. What a pity!!"
Best Service and Food Ever!,"Would like to highlight that Wynelle, Nino, and Abdullah are the epitome of perfect service.

Skai is, in a nutshell, amazing food with amazing service and amazing view.

Would highly recommend"
"Great ambience, great dinner","Had a Christmas gathering with a few of my friends. When we walked in, we were blown away by the view from the restaurant.

We thoroughly enjoyed dinner especially the oysters (small plates menu), lamb and beef (mains) and the banana dessert.

Special shoutout to Hagar for her attentiveness to our needs and the experience could not have been better.

Will definitely recommend!"
Best view in Singapore !,Wonderful team and the best possible view of Singapore ! The atmosphere is very nice as well ! You can also watch the sunset from there ! I can only recommend !! This is a must-see of Singapore !
Appreciation post,"The place and the vibe was beautiful.
The food was so amazing (everything) is so so good.
Shoutout to Mr. Ryan (Arcee) the bartender and barista who give us the suggestions for the coffee.
To Ms. Hagar who helped us and very kind.
To Ms. Elvira who helped us to the wine selections.
To Ms. Kai for accomodating us to the food menu.
I will surely come back again here.
Keep up the good work!"
Best place with best food and staff,"The place has spectacular view!
Good food and very accommodating staffs.
Thanks to Hagar, Ryan, Elvira and Kai for the best service i enjoyed my lunch a lot.
We’ll surely come back."
Good food and service,Fantastic views and food here at Skai! I was served by Wynelie and she was very friendly and warm. Can’t wait to be back here again
Great!,"Great place with outstanding views. Yummy food and superb staff who were all super friendly, especially our waitress which name I forgot to take.

Perfect wine recommendations by sommelier Nino and great interpersonal interactions with Manager in charge!"
Never come back again,"The only plus point is the view.
Food is not tasty and not worth the price. Ordered spaghetti which came almost cooled. Very limited choices for non beef eaters. Two dishes also tasted similar Seated at bar counter even though we had reservations and were there to celebrate our anniversary. Hardly any staff passes by. We waited like 20 mins to be served. Even when staff passes by they don’t look out for customers waving at them. For this price I can get much better food elsewhere with an equally good view"
The view is fantastic the food are not special but what disappoints us is the service of APRIL the tone of her voice management,"I visited skai restaurant because i want to experience the foods and the fantastic view of marina bay. The foods are not very special, i was really disappointed because the price of their foods are really expensive. Second, April who is serving us is very not nice server she is not giving her attention to us and we felt that she is not in the mood to work. The way she spoke to us is very unprofessional, we felt like we are not her guest she doesn't care about the tone of her voice to us. Everytime we ask her questions, everytime we are raising our hands because we really need something we can see in her face even she is wearing mask that she really annoyed to us."
Dinner at Skai,"Nice ambience, we order the lamb and fried cod and both were delicious. Our service staff Wynelle was attentive and friendly. Great place and people"
Big rip off,"Stayed 3 nights in the hotel in a 1000$ a night suit,thought on my last night to try out the Skai grilles 4 course festive menu
It's very misleading as they list the osetia caviar as one of the starter 150gr and small print 65 -which I found out is the extra money you have to cough up if you want that dish.
It's just the principles why can't you put a dollar sign on that extra 65 dollars??
Also the food was very mediocre the libster dish if you could find it was 2 small tiny piece smaller than a coffee spoons half
The beef was nearly cold
At least the icecream was cold
They charged also 15 S$ for water so the bill for this pathetic attempt was 222$
A complete waste of my money and time
It's the typical tourist trap since I stayed in the hotel virtually 5 floors down I had a better view as well as they seated me to a crappy bar stool.
Well you learn from your mistakes for sure and this was mine.
So be careful read between the line and don't settle for mediocre with a big price tag"
Skyline Japanese Fusion dining,"Service was excellent, we were served by waitress Hagar, she was very om point in making sure everything was going well for us, our drinks and food. View was awesome, you get a very beautiful view of Singapore's iconic buildings like MBS, Esplanade, and see the Cbd skyscrapers.

It was in the month of December, thus we ordered the festive 4 course meal..fabulous food.

Overall, it was fantastic, would definitely recommend my friends to come dine with a view.


Thank you Hagar for taking care of our needs.at lunch.."
Impeccable Service,"Service was the best! Food was good too and the view was amazing! But overall, really gotta thank Hagar for her wonderful service 😊 If you’re reading this, thank you so much :) Take care!"
Great Service!,"Wynelle, our friendly and warm server, did a great job on serving our table. Recommendations were spot on and she was warm and bubbly throughout. Food was good and ambience fantastic!"
My happy place.😊,The best place to dine in Singapore. The view while your dining is perfect. The atmosphere and the food is one of the reason i like to comeback once in awhile. and the service is excellent.
Overpriced,"Located on one of the highest floor of the stamford hotel, there is both a SKAI bar and a restaurant. The food is average and certainly overpriced. You pay for the view and the food is average."
Average food and quite dire service,"I had an early Christmas celebration with a group of 9 friends at Skai. We went for the cocktail brunch. The Food and drink were average and the service was poor throughout the entire time we were there. We were greeted with attitude from the senior server attending to us every time we asked for anything (which was also a task as they only appeared every half an hour +). They made it obvious they did not want to be there.
Not only that, the brunch is meant to run until 3:30pm, but the server told us the last orders were at 2:15pm and only corrected themselves when one of the group members highlighted the correct time- can’t see us making another trip here after this experience."
Lunch with a fabulous view!,"Lunch on our last day in Singapore, what a great way to end our holiday. Delicious food with vey generous servings. We were seated at the bar & had a fabulous view of the bay, it was a lovely clear day. The service was very efficient, but not rushed, each course was delivered with an explanation of the meal."
Birthday Celebration Sky High,"I celebrated my fiancee's birthday with a 4-course fine dining at SKAI. Located on the 70th floor, this restaurant offers a panoramic night view over Singapore. MBS, Singapore River, and even the F1 Night Race track were clearly visible. We savored over our meals of delicacies. The restaurant's ambience is cosy yet comfortable. Restaurant staff were very friendly. They were even kind enough to present a little chocolate cake for our special occasion."
Sometimes it’s about the little things,"My second visit in a few months. Returned because of a craving for ther flat iron - it was a really excellent cut of beef. Today one of us also ordered the pork belly - we didn’t quite like the bottom layer of minced pork and potato; but the middle fatty portion was fantastic. We also ordered several starters and sides - particular praise goes to Hokkaido corn for the richness and creaminess and crispy tofu for the wok-hei and aromatic Japanese soy sauce. We were also charmed by two lovely birthday cakes for two of us celebrating our birthdays - thank you very much!

Of course, views are superb, goes without me saying.

Then why four and not five stars? I don’t know how to put it but I’ll just describe what happened:

(1). We were initially offered a little squarish table when there was a large empty table with sofas and pillows just next to it. I find it strange to offer an obviously inferior choice of table to an early customer (me) when there is/are significantly superior alternatives (if i didn’t see it that’s fine, but its right next to the lousy table). So yes, i did change the table- after I requested for it, but why should i need to even request for it in the first place?

(2). We observed some tables were really steeped in darkness - no table light, no overlying light, no side light, no nothing. There were a few folks seating in such dark tables. I mean, really really dark - any more darker one must as well patronize a restaurant called Nox (Dining in the Dark). Oh, not only were these tables dark, they were situated far from the windows. When we asked a waitress why such tables existed, she was stumped and couldn’t reply. Maybe whoever is reading this from the restaurant can reply. Who would want to pay top dollar to sit in such tables? (BTW, the customers who we saw seated in these tables - they were early customers, not late ones)."
Grey Hound Brunch,"Wonderful atmosphere. Drinks are very good. Food is average. Dessert is a tad dissappointing. Overall, still a good dining experience."
high tea with great view,"on 70th floor, offers a great view over Singapore (MBS, CBD, Singapore river, ...), high tea offers a lot of savoury dishes, great customer service, book a table at the window for a good view, can host small groups too, book early due to high demand"
Great experience!,Gorgeous place with great service! Will definitely be back. Look for Hagar! She's a gem! Wonderful food.
A disappointment!,Do not go to SKAI. Sub par service and bad food. I appreciate good service and good food and this place was an utter disappointment. Went there for my wife’s birthday. Pre arranged a birthday cake which never came. Wasn’t given the table I asked for with no apologies from the staff. Ordered the signature steak which came back overdone and tasteless. Bread was tasteless as well. It’s a restaurant which charges top dollar for sub par food and service. Don’t waste your time or money.
Great view with great food.,"The location, ambiance and food were great. If you want a place with stunning views of the Marina Bay area of Singapore, this is the place to be. Our server Hagar was very helpful! Excellent service!"
"Great food, great views, excellent service","Everything we ordered was delicious, the view from the restaurant was unbeatable and our waitress, Hagar, went above and beyond with her service. Would highly recommend."
Expensive but delicious food,It’s quite costly. Portion of food is small but they are amazing. They have set menu of 4 but not enough for 2 people. So must order ala carte. Various choices of wine. Add $88 to have different glasses of wine pair well with different foods in set menu. Service is good. Staffs taking care our table well. Will come back.
"great views, food & exceptional service","was planning a surprise proposal on our visit to Skai & the team was wonderful in helping in the planning and execution of the ""event""!

special call out for Wynelle who worked with me to plan as well as brief the duty team on what's coming! we were also helped on the day by Fern for table service and what can i say, my now fiancee calls me smooth criminal thanks for the wonderful help of the team - from the go ahead signals to contributing ideas, many many thanks for helping us with this special night!

not forgetting the great food as well, which truly was delightful and beyond my expectations - we had the oscar tenderloin with crab & asparagas, and scallop & crab pasta. amazing produce, fantastically executed. the wimberry tart is a delight and the experience of the match tiramisu service was excellent.

i might be biased due to the success of the night, but overall a fantastic experience at Skai!

if i had tips for upcoming diners:
1. always be nice to the service crew
2. start the evening at skai bar for a slightly different view
3. transition to the restaurant for a grand but not overpowering view & delightful food and drink

now you guys have to stay open for all our anniversaries :)"
Great view matched by great food,"This place did not disappoint in terms of the quality of the food. It is fine dining so do not expect big portions. But the quality was really up there. Dont miss on the wagyu beef, every bite was exquisite. Excellent atmosphere and obviously the best views in town"
Great Sunday brunch with an exceptional view,"My wife and I had an excellent Sunday Brunch at SKAII. It was our first time.
The restaurant feels great, bright, modern with an incredible view. The service was on par with the restaurant standards. The staff was helpful, professional and caring. The food was excellent. We took the set lunch and every dish was tasty and great looking. The wine selection is rich and both wines I tried were actually excellent.
Also worth noting that we went there with our newborn. We had space for the stroller, and the ambiance was so nice our baby slept though :-)

Overall a very good experience. We will be happy to come back."
Skai High Tea,"The view was magnificent, service was good and staff were polite. However, the food quality can be improved in term of taste."
"Great views, good food, and amazing service","We visited Skai for their Saturday Champagne Brunch on 6 August and had a wonderful time.

We were seated next to the window and had a great view of the city, marina bay, and the sea. If you want to have a seat by the window, be sure to make a reservation a few weeks in advance and they'll try their best to fulfill your request.

The food and drinks were always flowing and the portion sizes were just right. You get small tasting portions of everything and can reorder unlimited serving of whatever you want.

Big shout out to Vinoth for making the experience an amazing one. He was very friendly, constantly checking to make sure we had whatever we need, and always with a smile on his face and a cheerful personality."
Great food with great views,"Food is lovely. The complimentary bread is aromatic - we ordered a second loaf. Crab cake was good, though I didn’t like passion fruit on top. The wagyu flat iron was yummy! Hokkaido corn was as good as the one in wooloomooloo downstairs. Dessert was really good too. In fact almost everything was to our satisfaction.

Views are wonderful. Make sure you come early to secure that window seat. Reservations are needed.

I took off one star because they charged $3 per person for tap water. It’s not that I can’t afford it. It’s just preposterous. It’s like you check into a premium hotel room in a premium hotel and the hotel charges you for “regular” mineral water inside the room."
Nice view with affordable set lunch,"Came here for company event. We booked one corner for lunch. The staff were very helpful and patient. Set lunch is a little on the small quantity side but its delicious and you can top up the bread again. The bread is really delicious with special butter.
The view is really very nice and area is nice and spacious."
Great ambience and excellent customer service!,"Excellent customer service by Fern & Vinoth, and another guy in red suit (we forgot to get his name) who served our desserts!
We enjoy the ambience, food, and service!
Our team enjoyed every single dish!"
My Mom’s Birthday,"Excellent service by Fern and Ms April, excellent food, great ambiance, my mom was very happy, we celebrated her birthday, thank u Skai team."
"Fantastic service, views and food","We went here for Saturday brunch with champagne. There was a choice of Rose or Laurent Perrier. We had the latter which is always good. Service was excellent throughout the 3 hours of service. Our glasses were never allowed to be empty! Food was served in courses, essentially bringing the buffet (pre covid) to the table. There was a great variety and plenty to eat. We were continually asked if we would like any particular dish again. We loved the selection and also were impressed that they had taken on board my allergy. The restaurant has superb views over the Bay and beyond and we had a fantastic window table. I would advise that you book well ahead in order to get a window table.Congratulations to all the staff for making this such a memorable visit."
Something is Missing,Something is missing at the Skai Restaurant. It doesnt have that kick after the dinner. Not sure if was the quality of food. No surprises I would say. Uploaded some pictures for your reference.
Wonderful food and location chaotic service,"We visited to have a celebratory honeymoon meal with a great view on a weekday.

Upon arriving there was no one to greet us like the adjacent restaurant, we were waiting a while all waiters seemed very busy. After choosing our table we enjoyed the great view however you need to be lucky with the weather as the windows can fog up on the outside leaving you with no view even if you choose a window facing seat, this may be down to how cold it was on the inside.

We found that all the waiting staff didn't seem to have specific areas they looked after which made the service feel chaotic we constantly had different people coming to us to check if drinks had been ordered, if food had been ordered etc telling one person one thing and then telling another person the same thing was frustrating.
We also found the room very cold to the point being uncomfortable and made our food go cold very quickly, we didn't want to hang around for further drinks as we were in need of warming up.
The food itself we had both steaks which were absolutely gorgeous, very well cooked and tasty, the pudding was also great. The cocktails we had were nothing like we'd had before and amazingly tasty, the mixologist is great here, it was all the treat we expected it to be. Thank you also for the celebratory cake.
I think it would have been 5/5 if the service wasn't so disorganised."
Skai's the limit...,"… and a superb benchmark in my book.

This review is truly long overdue. After countless visits at Skai, I’m guilty of taking for granted the faultless execution by the kitchen and warm, discrete yet friendly front of house crew.

For starters, the setting is unbeatable and always impresses whether for a casual business meal or something intimate with my partner. Skai has a fantastic chic space. We personally have our favourite spots in the restaurant but I believe any table will afford you that zen view of Singapore’s skyline.

We're a big fan of their cocktails, such creative concoctions and always delish. The menu is tight but excellent and I love the Japanese inspired elements. You’d be missing out if you passed up on their beautifully grilled wagyu cuts. We’re also suckers for their toasty sourdough bread, oh-so-juicy crab cake and sinful foie gras that never leaves us any space for desserts. One day in the not so distant future perhaps, we’ll exercise enough control to make room for that…. :)

It goes without saying that the Skye team’s repeated gestures of generosity is not lost on us. We’re always well taken care of by various individuals and my sincere apologies for not remembering names. Not only do we enjoy the cool, contemporary vibes here, even elderly folk like my parents have thoughts of a return visit of their own…. they’re a fussy couple so this means a lot.

In the meantime, I’ll be looking forward to my own indulgence next at Skai as a lovely post gym workout meal. Now, how’s that for decadence!"
Great Service,"Nice place, stunning views and excellent service from Fern, our waiter. He is very accommodating and friendly. He did an amazing job- above and beyond the norm. He made my wife’s bday celebration a memorable one!

Dan from Chicago, USA"
Review of SKAI,The ambiance is perfect at the 70th floor and able to see the view of entire Marina bay sands. Just sadly the food I don’t really like it cuz it doesn’t hit my taste bud. But overall good experience
Outstanding experience,"A truly memorable evening. Spectacular views, incredible food, wine and the service is outstanding. I cannot recommend highly enough the new 4 course menu paired with with wine flight. You will not be disappointed. Amazing"
Our 30th Anniversary Dinner for just the 2 of us,"We usually patronize Prego, but we were very impressed with the professional and friendly service at Skai. We were celebrating our 30th Anniversary over dinner, and we were given an excellent table by the window. The service was impeccable in terms of taking our orders, serving of our orders, taking our picture to remember this occasion by and generally making our dinner experience not only memorable but we deeply appreciated the level of attention and service given to us. We will most certainly to make a return visit to Skai not only for special occasions but also for business meals. I'd highly recommend Skai to family & friends .... and especially to anyone visiting Singapore for a birds-eye view of our Island Republic."
Best Steak in Singapore with an excellent customer service!,"We enjoyed the experience! Great food! They serve the best beef wagyu steak! It literally melts in your mouth! Thanks for the recommendation,, Leo and Fern! To top it up, excellent customer service by Fern! Truly a 5-star experience!"
Superb Experience,"The service and ambience is superb!!!! The staffs were very friendly and accommodating, Fern was assisting us while we chose our food, and He recommended the best options possible. Leo went to greet us as well and told us to enjoy our dinner. This is something we look forward to when we visit in the restaurant, to feel welcome and enjoy the stay and food. We will surely book for more occasions here at Skai."
Great dinner at Skai,"Had a wonderful and memorable anniversary celebration at Skai. Service staff, in particular Fern, was especially attentive. Highly recommended!"
April and Tiffany made our day!,"Fantastic service, fantastic ladies. Ms April and Tiffany took care of us so well. You rarely get to see such warm, genuine hospitality from staff in Singapore! Made it very special. I hope someone at Skai sees this and takes good care of them. You take care of your staff and they take care of you!"
"Breathtaking View , Indifferent Service","We had the privilege of celebrating our special occasions here a number of times but after this' forgettable' experience, we beg to differ !
Food was as good as usual : we ordered Foie Gras, Irish Oysters, Scallop Tagliatelle, wagyu Westholme Flat Iron medium rare and we enjoyed the cuisines .
Service was cool & rather robotic- lack of personal warmth/touch for a fine dining restaurant .

Incidentally, the evening became very 'unforgettable' for me after we returned home and had our usual round of fresh fruit and about to retire for the night - i felt growing discomfort and went to the WC . From 11.30 pm till over 2 am in the wee hours of the morning i almost made the WC my bedroom with intermittent acute stomach ache!!!
Thankfully my dear wife was spared the 'unforgettable' experience ."
We had the perfect everything,"Everything was amazing, from the view of the city to our wonderful server (shout out to Stephanie, she was so helpful and efficient!)
The champagne was so refreshing, the food was absolutely delicious (we repeated that tuna at least 5 times, and I so badly wish I had ordered the tray of cold cuts at least one more time-biggest regret!). The only thing I wasn't completely in love with was the risotto. Also, I have to mention that falafel was the best I've ever had."
"Great view, poor service","Not sure if it was because we came at peak hours (during afternoon tea) but staff was borderline rude and inattentive. Food was decent, but our table was basically ignored until it came time for the bill. View and aesthetic was superb though so not a total loss."
Fantastic view,"It was the last night of our holiday and we wanted to go somewhere special with a view, and Skai did not disappoint. Luckily it was a clear night so the city vista was great. Lovely food and atmosphere. Recommended."
Stunning Views & Classy Ambience carry the day!,"Visited SKAI for lunch and was blown away by the views from 70th Floor. Ambience was also classy and mighty refined. Lunch options for vegetarians though were limited. We had BBQ Spiced Cauliflower, ChickPea Tofu & Linguini Pasta with classy red wine from Chile. Dessert of Chocolate mouse was a bit sad."
"Amazing view, food and service","Visited Skai restaurant on our trip to Singapore. The service was amazing, the waiters were so attentive and made sure we were well looked after. The food and dessert were definitely worth the visit and not to mention the view of Singapore city was simply breathtaking. Would definitely recommend this place."
Disappointing,"The experience was most disappointing. For a steak based restaurant the quality of the rib eye steaks we has was very unsatisfactory . Perhaps some of the issue is cultural in what constitutes a good steak but gristle in any language can not be good. At these prices most of the steak should not be destined for the rubbish bin.

Scallop first course was excellent. Desert was pretty good but because the main course was a failure it was hard to recover. Great location but!!!"
Wonderful experience!,"Wonderful experience! Celebrated our 7th wedding anniversary at Skai! We love the view, the food, and the service! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
Birthday celebration,Staffs are warm and friendly. Food is great ! It will be even better if they offer poultry as another option for main course.
First visit to Skai Restaurant,"A friend brought me here for a birthday treat and their service was impeccable and we got a seat with a great view! Great food and ambience to just chill with friends after a long day at work. Especially loved the baked vanilla cheesecake which came as a pleasant surprise for me — slightly tangy, coupled with the pineapple sorbet. It was a refreshing treat to end off our meal."
Excellent view and food,"It has been a joy to visit skai again since COVID started. The restaurant is fully packed for Easter and the food, service and smiles are all good. Our server was Pandian who delivered excellent service, top notch!! Thank you Skai!"
superb place to celebrate birthday,"This was definitely a 5-star experience, the food was top-tier and simply scrumtious, the service was great and the staff were very polite and freindly, definitely will come back."
Fantastic food and service,"Went to celebrate a birthday for dinner. Everything, from the breathtaking views, to the food, to the immaculate table service, was outstanding. the wait staff were always on hand, discrete but ever ready to respond to us. The food was fantastic as well, and my partner and I loved everything from the starters (especially the crab cake), and the mains (in particular the grilled cod). Special shout-out to Mr. Pandian, who was helped us (and many other patrons) take beautiful photos.

Fantastic experience, would definitely return."
Amazing experience,"Food was amazing. Had the beef and cod. The cod blown my mind.

Drinks was good.

Service was excellent. They are so nice!

Worth coming!"
Boozy Brunch @ Skai,"We had to queue for sometime before we were brought to our table. Nonetheless, everything were all good in the next 3 hours: ambiance, booze, food, and staff service. Unfortunately, we were not able to get the names of the staffs who were hospitable throughout our brunch experience."
Food posioning ruin staycation,"6 march 2022 , 7pm dinner 1 crab cake Westholme flat iron Baked cheesecake Panna water Vomitted at 1.30pm numerous time in staycation in Fairmont."
Beautiful Ambience and Excellent Service,"Located on the 70th floor, SKAI served a beautiful panoramic view of the city skyline, be sure to come before dusk to observe the beautiful sunset. We had the 1kg Porterhouse along with the crab pasta and black cod. The food was decent for the price but what helped made the experience even more memorable was the service rendered by our waitress Stephanie who were detailed and patient with our requests. From the generous serving of bread appetisers to the complimentary birthday cake, she made sure we had all our needs met. Thank you Stephanie for the wonderful service that night!"
"High floor, low score","At Skai you pay a few hundred dollars to eat the great view only, not the food. Service was not as prompt as we would have expected. We ordered 2 starters to share. It was $34 plus each for 2 mouthful's of food on each plate respectively (taste was ok, nothing special). The Westholme Wagyu Flat Iron was $75 for a 4 inch x 3 inch portion of meat that had a line of gristle all the way through and was tough to chew. It came with 4-5 leaves of salad. It's ok if your core purpose is to have the view. If in addition to the view, you also want a good quality meal that respects you as a consumer to complete an all round pleasant experience , this may not be the place for you"
"Awesome Team, Outstanding Services!!","I rarely use TripAdvisor to write review but I would like to write this:
I actually drop by last year 2021 December to make a early reservation for my Best Brother and his Wife Birthday Celebration for this year 2022 March.

Where by I think might not be able to get a Nice view seat as requested because if last minute request.

But JAMIE somehow able to accommodate my request and my friend seriously enjoy their meal in Skai as well as the Excellent Service!

The explanation of each dishes was in form. Once again, I will definitely be coming to enjoy"
Birthday celebration,Greatly appreciate the meals delicately prepared by chef Paul and the impeccable services provided by Leo and Nino . Fresh succulent seafood and meats excited my taste buds the whole evening and the performance put up by the cocktail mixer teased my eyes . Would love to see all again .
NEXT LEVEL ……. Literally,"This place is out of this WORLD!!!! I literally was blown away from start to finish. As soon as I walked in the view took my breath away and so did the decor. THEN the food arrived woah …….
We did the Valentine’s Day high tea and it was absolutely divine. We devoured every last bite and each thing we ate was more delicious than the last. Also the cocktails were next level and let me tell you I know a thing or two about cocktails I don’t mind paying too dollar for a cocktail when they taste that good. Highly recommend."
Great ambience. Amazing food! Celebrated my husband’s birthday and its a perfect place :),"Served by Fern and he was so polite and passionate about his work. Always checked up on us if we needed anything!

Place was perfect. Caught a nice sunset during our dinner service. Thanks so much. Will definitely come back again."
Great dining experience,"Enjoyed our lunch at Skai. This is a place you can trust to expect good food, great service and wonderful view."
Perfect dinner date venue with spectacular view,"Had our Vday celebration here. Great ambience , great food ( their crab cake was especially good ) , great view, great service , great experience. We would like to particularly thank Stephanie for her excellent service. She is very attentive and polite. 10/10 would visit again."
Brunch/ Celebrating Valentines 💝,"The view was great and excellent service the server Fern very nice he always approached us. Fantastic experience here, worth it!☺"
Brunch during Valentine,Great service all the way from start to finish. We were seated comfortably and given a brief of the food that is served by Fern
Average food and service. Nonetheless view was fantastic.,"Been here for dinner before and of course was mesmerised by the awesome view from level 70. Decided to drop by for lunch to celebrate friend’s bdae and personally we all love the daytime scenery.

Ordered a 3 course lunch with eggplant as starter, salmon as main and hazelnut as dessert. Salmon was a pathetic small slice and was quite undercooked from the colour and the skin wasn’t crispy as well. However dessert make up for the overall meal experience. My friend ordered a lobster for main at $76 but I would feel the portion is small for the price paid. Definitely can understand the small portion for the set lunch but not for e full price Ala carte main. Service wasn’t fantastic and can feel the staff is rushing to clear plates and prepare for high tea servicing. Throughout the servicing, there isn’t much warmth or smile from the waitresses which I do expect more from a fine dining restaurant.

In term of quality and standard of food, would feel it has dropped from the last time I came in Oct 2020 for dinner. Food portion was smaller and also feels like it has sat in the kitchen for quite a while before serving out. Not even lukewarm for any of the mains being served out.

If you want to experience the view, yes would recommend. For food, I would think twice."
Great service!,We were there to celebrate my husband's birthday and our wedding anniversary. Food was delicious and service was even better. Staff were attentive and hospitable. We had a great experience there and will dine there again.
Everything is perfect here,"The quality of steak and wine from Coravin list are just superb! The service staff are friendly, attentive and knowledgeable."
Nice service from Ally,"It's the second visit and because of my friend move over, I decided to come here. Ally is such an amazing person, she looked after is. Took care of us. ally is amazing"
