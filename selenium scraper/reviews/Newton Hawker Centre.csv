As good as in the movies,This is a must if you are visiting - a relatively short taxi from Marina Bay and worth the journey - better the the food halls located in the CBD.
Average quality open late always good for the new tourist,It’s open late around 2 am but the shops close around 11 pm. If need something to eat go here for sure but I found the quality so-so. Lots of stands but a bit repetitive.
For all family and budget friendly,"Surprising find! We came late afternoon and the center just started filling up. The food was tasty, quick service, friendly and prices reasonable for Singapore. Except for prawns and crab, that is still pricey (18$ for 1! tiger prawn). I decided to try durian ice cream - I got and extra big portion and it was excellent"
Fun night out,Lots of food choices with good options for all tastes. Must try the oyster omelette. The BBQ wings and satay is also great.
Good eat out stalls,"Very close to the Newton metro. We just went for a chicken stuffed paratha called Murtabaka. It was just too good. The dish was prepared in 5 minutes and it was yum.
It is worth to eat here. The food is not at all expensive. There is ample space to sit and eat in their courtyard."
Mainly cater for tourists,"Nice foods mainly cater for tourists, because it slightly more costly then other hawker center if you want to eat local foods.

Foreigners enjoyed the outdoor dinning, and 80% of the foods is BBQ chicken wings, Satay, stir fried seafoods etc. We tried Oyster ommelette, fish porridge, fishball noodle (stall locate facing the carpark, with old couple doing it for the last 40 years)."
Lunch at Indian Kitchen #01-44,"Genuinely excellent food. Freshly prepared mutton Rogan Josh and Kheema Nan were incredibly tasty but ok much for a quick lunch. The menu is very comprehensive, something for everybody, but I’ll be coming back for exactly this with a few beers. Great stuff."
Alliance Seafood No.27,"Had food from Alliance seafood Stall no.27, it is a Michelin star rated food place with an excellent variety of food. There are many delicious food there such as cereal chicken, black pepper beef and the fried egg with oyster. One of the better food centre in Singapore."
poor management,"I understand that there is a need for limited seating during covid, but the management lets more people in then there are seats, creating many problems. Poorly managed, very poorly managed."
One of my favorite Hawkers in Singapore,"This was one of the locations featured in crazy rich Asians movie. Very touristy and the prices are slightly higher than other local hawkers, but the atmosphere is very cool and the variety of food is great. Definitely worth a visit, regardless of how short your stay is in Singapore."
Dishonest lady boss drink seller,"First time went and the kopi c kosong peng(ice coffee,evaporated milk without sugar) cost $1.50.
I found the coffee taste quite good, so I went back in less than a week to order my caffeine fix again on the 03-April-21. Wow it suddenly cost me $2. Curious, I asked the lady boss why the sudden surge of 50¢
She gave a quick guilty and lame reason that because this is not teh peng(ice milk tea). Wow! I guess no more next time. For me integrity is more important than the quality of your food or drinks."
Authentic spot to eat,You'll have a taste of authentic Singapore cuisine. Tons of food vendors that you can choose from. Everything is made fresh.
Stall 30 stay sticks,"Ordered 10 chicken stay sticjs, git home only received 9 and they were tiny, not at all what is advertised, terrible value and very poor quality so much better food at other stalls, will not return."
Hawker food is a Singapore highlight,"Singapore is famous for hawker food. The hawkers set up their stands each night and people came to eat their dishes. If the food isn't good, they won't survive. Singaporeans are notoriously picky about their food. There are a number of hawkers centres, Newton Circus is one of the best. Newton Circus is about 1.2 km from Orchard Road (about 3/4 or a mile). If you ask your hotel, they will probably say ""take taxi"" Anything over a kilometer is considered to be a marathon in Singapore. Everyone knows Orchard Road, it remains one of Singapore's prime shopping destinations. Hotel food is much the same everywhere, but Singapore's hawker centres are unique.."
Eat! Eat! Eat!,"I apologize that I can't recall exactly which vendors we visited, but everything was absolutely delicious. And we ate some weird stuff."
No no NO!,"Oh my gosh, if all the hawker centers we’ve been to this is the absolute worst! Reasons:
-Hot and dirty tables and area
-Very expensive
-Mediocre food taste to other places in Singapore
-All the taxi drivers agreed with us that it is just hype and overrated due to the movie “Crazy Rich Asians”
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE....GO ANYWHERE ELSE!"
Disappointed!,Disappointed! walked 2 km to this place and was looking forward to have some local food. But disappointed with the whole thing. Unpleasant and rude guy at the Nasi lemak stall! The only friendly service we got is frm the drink’s lady. Don’t think we will rush back to newton hawkers centre anytime soon.
Alliance Seafood Stall Rocks,"With limited time in Singapore, we decided to focus on the food centers and we were not disappointed. Wandering around we just happened to notice that Alliance Seafood was open and Michelin rated! We were not disappointed. Great food, great service and a casual atmosphere. Great bang for the buck."
Almost great,"I decided to check this spot after I found out that Crazy rich Asians was filmed here. It's a really nice place with many food options, but unfortunately half of them were closed due to Chinese new year, which limited vegetarian options. In the end I chose navratan kurma - a mild vegetarian curry. If you're fan of street food and hawker centres, it's a must go."
Hawker Centre,"well there was something here for everyone, brilliant atmosphere, so vibrant, inexpensive priced food, good location, cold beers, one of the better hawker centres I think"
Amazing food and atmosphere,"We visited a number of Hawker centres whilst in Singapore and whilst all had great food, the Newton centre had the best atmosphere and food. We did struggle to find a sweet treat to end our meal with and It was harder to find a seat for the 3 of us but everything else outweighed this"
Wow. Go,"Love this place. Few min drive from Orchard Rd. We had pepper crab, Popiah rolls, stir fry carrot cake etc etc All delicious and bargain priced"
Why wouldn’t you ?,"The location is perfect. The beer is freezing cold, food is uniformly good and atmosphere is as you would hope for in a busy hawker centre in the centre of Singapore.

It’s been an institution for so long that you may think it could have become a bit of a tourist trap, but most of the people there were locals when we visited.

The stalls serve up a range of Singapore favourites and we went twice in two nights, and had a great time, with a variety of excellent dishes.

I’m sure there are more cutting edge hawker centres in Singapore, but Newton was just what we needed. I’d strongly recommend it."
Great food Hawker location!,"We went to two food Hawker locations in Singapore. This one was the best.

Great experience that is a must-do if you ever go to Singapore. If you haven't watched Crazy Rich Asians - watch it. It's not only this location, but you'll get a great idea of how to actually order food. (You don't do it like at a food court in the mall.)

You pick-and-choose a-la-carte from each food stand, you cobble together whatever combination you want, you tell them your table number and they deliver it straight to you.

Great experience!"
Hawker markets rock,"We go everytime we are in Singapore.
Great atmosphere, incredible selection of (nearly) perfectly made dishes.
Walk the stalls and find the ones you like, find the owners who are the friendliest, as they generally have the most trade becuase of their quality.
Base costs are going up so these won't be around for much longer...a must do in Singapore."
One of the best...,"Newton Hawker centre never fails to impress. Stalls are plenty and so is the choice of food. Chilli Crab, Oyster Omelette etc are wonderful. It is not all that economical as it used to be 10 years back but still good value for money."
"Worth a visit, lots of choice","Dropped in to Newton for an afternoon drink having seen it featured on Crazy Rich Asians... Large Tiger beer bottles were SG$7.50, which felt like pretty good value. We didn’t eat here but there were plenty of choices of very good value food had we wished to. Plenty of seating, and open until 2am. Plenty of staff keeping the area clean."
"Pretty good, but try try Tiong Bahru also","Food is good, but the touts can be a little in your face. Apparently the prices have risen since scenes from Crazy Rich Asians were filmed here and the crowds followed. The food is just as good at Tiong Bahru but half the price. Still, a vibrant, fun place to eat that we really enjoyed."
A fun experience!,"We had our last meal in Singapore here. It’s a very fun, lively place where you will see lots of people of all ages. There are many different food vendors, and since we hadn’t done our research, we just picked two randomly. (Note: the vendors are quite aggressive about luring you to their place, so be prepared!). My husband had chicken satay which he thought was a little tougher than it should be, and I had vegetable fried rice, which was very good. (We weren’t super hungry so we only ordered two main dishes). I would come here for the atmosphere, and perhaps ask a local which are the best vendors for food!"
Worth Visiting,"Going to a Hawker food centre while in Singapore is a local custom. Plus it's about 1/4 the price of the restaurants. :-) Lots and lots of food choices, and as the name implies, lots of people trying to sell you their food. Take a walk around the different stalls - try something from more than one stand. Satay sticks and/or fried rice are an easy entry-level for someone who isn't as adventurous as others. But it's worth noting that the Chili Crab is also something worth trying if you like good food! All the prices are pretty low, except for alcohol. I spent as much for a pint of beer as I did for all the food I could stuff in. But the Newton centre is pretty large - lots of choices. I recommend trying it if you haven't before."
"Fun place, tremendous variety","The Newton Hawker Centre is one of many with a multitude of food stalls. In our limited experience, it offers one of the most varied selections of ethnic foods. People are friendly, often your order is brought to your table. Stay away from the center of the court if rain expected."
Outdoor eating at it's best,"We got to Newton Circus pretty early (before 6pm) and there were a few patrons already eating, but by the time we left the place was booming. We were worried about the weather and didn't want to have to sit around the middle of the hawker centre, which doesn't have shelter. It didn't end up being an issue as the weather cleared.
The stall owners will encourage you to sit at a table near them, but you can still order from any of the stalls at the centre. If you're ordering seafood, make sure you're asking the price before ordering.
The centre has such a wide variety of local foods, drinks and desserts - we ordered satay, noodles, cockles, warm buns and vegetables. Newton Circus is easily accessible by bus or train and is outdoor eating at it's best!"
Best Singaporean Cuisines,"I love how they have so many food stalls selling different kinds of local food specialties and drinks. Be it satay, laksa, and their famous coffee (kopi) you name it all! Be sure to come and visit this place and you won't regret it!"
Hawker food is a Singapore speciality,"If you want to taste real Singaporean food, go to a hawker centre. Each hawker stall specialises in one variety of food. The recipes are family secrets, handed down over generations. Singaporean specialities are chilli stingray, oyster omelets, satay and squid. If you only have a short time in Singapore, ditch your antiseptic hotel restaurant and head for a hawker centre. And hawker food always tastes better with an ice-cold Tiger beer, Singapore's own brew. Singaporeans are very picky about food, if it's popular it's usually good."
Great hawker centres with great seafood,Great hawker centres with great seafood! We went here on. Sat lunch which wasn’t very crowd. You were able to try all local Food and drinks there. Dining area is clean and tidy.
Singapore local food for tourists,"A place where you could try most of the local food here, from Chinese to malay and Indian food. The food was so so, nothing special, will only visit when there are oversea friends come and visit. Yet you could get the most delicious satay here - as per crazy rich Asian movie!

It’s very crowded during weekend, especially dinner time around 7pm onwards. Try to come before that so that you could find a seat.

The must try items here would be satay and oyster omelette. The rest maybe just so so and price also kinda high end for hawker food"
Lousy service at Alliance Seafood Stall #27,"I actually would rate zero for an extremely unpleasant experience. Service is terrible and the service staff are extremely stingy. I ordered a plate of stingray and yes, it’s only a plate of stingray so when I took an additional stack of Chili with shallots after finishing my two small plates of chilli, they told me I was too much, and having spent only $12, I shouldn’t be taking so much of their chilli. Firstly, they shouldn’t discriminate against how much I spend in order to take more chilli, and secondly it’s only shallots, with a few pieces of chilli. I’m better off spending my business elsewhere if I am chided for being a chilli lover. If you’re putting a Michelin recommendation on your signboard, I recommend that you start working more on being less stingy and improve your customer service. After all, people dine out and spend money at your stall not to get chided. And FYI I finished eating my chilli."
Fantastic choice of freshly cooked food brought straight to your table.,"Best Hawker centre in Singapore in my opinion. Not as cheap as it once was but still the food is excellent, service great and the atmosphere reminiscent of the Singapore of yesteryear. The satay and Singapore chilli crab are must haves."
A wonderful experience,We went after arriving late from a flight Food we had was king prawns calamari and chicken satay All brought to our table . Delicious food
Great experience BUT an absolute minefield if you allergies!,There are so many Hawker stalls here and they are really good! It was a bit of a minefield if you have allergies like I do but you’re allowed to take stuff in with you (drinks anyway) and I don’t think anyone was really policing what you do. I managed to get some grilled seafood as was too scared to try anything else since there’s soy sauce in just about everything but all my family enjoyed the food and I was happy to see the place J
Traditional Hakwer Stand Experience,"As a disclaimer, we came here during lunch so missed part of the night market experience. The food and atmosphere were incredibly authentic. We also got to spend time chatting with the local people. Everyone was friendly. I just thought the food quality was a bit off and there wasn't as much variety as I would've liked."
Authentic food experience,Newton Hawker outdoor Centre is a bit daunting at first as it is a very busy & vibrant space full of locals. Finding a table can be a bit tricky & the stall owners definitely try & compete for your business which can feel a bit overwhelming. There are so many food stalls to choose from with so many types of cuisines to choose from. Take your time to peruse around & check out the stalls. A must go to place do to get an authentic feel for the life of food in singapore
Popular with locals and so many yummy choices,"We’ve been to Singapore a few times and really enjoy eating at the hawker centres and food centres because of the options available, the authenticity of the experience and the reasonable prices.

The Newton Hawker Centre is probably the best we’ve experienced and is packed with locals, which is a good indication of what to expect.

If you’ve never been to a Hawker Centre before the concept is easy: find a table; check for a table number - remember it; go to the food stand (or drink stand - try a Tiger Beer for a real Singaporean experience) you’re interested in and order what you want; you usually pay at the time of ordering and they deliver to your table or they may deliver to you and ask you to pay on delivery (occasionally you’ll need to return to the vendor to collect your food); when finished clear your table - there are ‘stations’ for returning plates etc and disposing of rubbish, and places to wash your hands.

Seriously, you have not properly experienced Singapore if you’ve not eaten at a Hawker Centre."
Amazing food and vibrant setting,"I’m not a street food person at all, but I had read so much about hawkers centres in Singapore that we had to try this out. The food was amazing and reasonably priced. The place has a great vibe and service is quick. The place isn’t plush, but it isn’t meant to be. Totally worth a visit."
"Indian Kitchen, stall #01-44","This small Indian food stall makes the most delicious Malai Chicken, one of the best I’ve tasted. Their Naan breads are superb, thin, not the thick pizza dough offerings in a lot of places. They do a full range of freshly cooked authentic veg and non-veg dishes. The chef is passionate about his food, always comes out to check you’re happy with your meal. This is a must visit place for me every time I’m in Singapore."
Watch out on your calories!!!,Love Newton food centre. A good range of food for everyone. Only problem is tend to order too much as there are so many varieties to choose from.
Team night out,Went out for food and drinks at Newton Hawker Centre. Sat in open area and soaked in evening ambience. Had plenty of sea food and beers. Crowds start to fill the place by 730pm.
Fantastic,"Love Newton, great variety of food, styles of food, something for everyone. Great flavours, clean, organised and fun!"
Options for all,"Although when we went during lunch not every store was open the ones we did visit, were good. Its important to note that you can review the food ratings (as in most places in Singapore). Best to stick with those where you can. Great place to try some more traditional Singapore dishes."
Great Foodie Experience,"Should you wish to experience the richness and diversity of Asian food, the Newton Hawker Centre is a great start. You can sample Chinese, Malaysian, Indian, Thai and Singaporean foods in the one place. There was even access to the more mundane European foods for those who are not too adventurous. The large tiger prawns are something to behold and more than enough for a meal. Our group tried many of the foods on offer and were not disappointed by the quantity nor taste of the servings."
Visited on a bad day but still got good food!,"So I came by on the weekend...and it took a lot of walking to get to this food center! I got off the wrong stop on the bus and had to basically walk in a HUGE circle to get to the food center (had to go on an overpass) then looked at google maps like 1000x before finally getting to the food center.
Lo and behold, most stalls were closed (not surprised) but also the center had no electricity and running water?! What?!
Anyhow after wandering around some more I managed to find one stall that was operating and bought myself some prawn mee (mad delicious) and white radish cake. So much food for such a great price! I couldn't finish it all and kinda wished I brought around food containers with me (but they would probably spoil in the Singapore heat so not advised). Do bring friends to eat with (two plates is more than enough for two people to share)
Bathrooms were pretty clean too. I had wanted to wash my hands but no running water so the attendant directed me to the handicap/children's toilet which did have running water and soap! I'm a huge germophobe so I was really grateful for that.
They also have a water fountain to fill bottles too!"
A must see place in the centre of a roundaout new Newton Station.,"This is a must see place with dozens of fast food stalls around the edge of the site with open table dining in the middle. Get your table (often difficult due to the popularity of the place) and then go to any stall and order food, giving your table number. You can order starters from one stall, mains from another, beer and drinks from another, your choice is totally free, and after payment you sit at your table and the various stalls bring the food to you. Most tourists go for the tiger prawns and crab dishes but at S$25 for each prawn it can be costly. If you stick to the local stuff like rice, noodles, chow mein type food, it's cheap and the experince is worth it. Don't go dressed up as this is a very casual place to eat used by locals and tourists alike."
A big disappointment,"After our visit we wondered if it was worth the special trip here. We decided the answer was..........just about. But almost 'no'.

We thought we'd be there all evening, ordering a dish here, a dish there. That's how the visitor would have found it years ago (my wife lived in Singapore in the 80s & 90s) but now it's not a place to spend a whole evening.

The place has been 'modernised' (my wife said Disneyfied) and that's led to its becoming touristy, and now due to the busy-ness it's order, eat, leave. Your visit is quite short.

We'd been eating in food courts in town (at half the price) and although Newton has them beaten on choice we didn't feel the Newton food was any better and, frankly the food courts offer a more genuine experience because that's where the locals are eating. (To us, still the best guide to where to eat.)

It's still a cheap place to eat compared with restaurants, the variety of dishes is huge, and it's definitely an experience to remember but when we left, we were wondering what to do with the rest of our evening."
Clean & Tasty,Went to three Hawker centres whilst on Holiday in Singapore. Was streets ahead of the other two we tried. Clean throughout and very tasty food. Even a craft beer bar for me. Would go again.
How to Get There - Newton Food Centre,"It's easy just take the subway. Get off at the Newton subway stop and follow the signs. You will be there in 10 minutes walking slowly.
Best to go when the sun is down. There is a better atmosphere at night with the lights and sitting under the palm trees.
What to eat? Local fare for sure. Seafood is a specialty. Petty much everything is good.
I advise you to find a table before you order because it can be difficult to find a table. You don't want to eating standing.
I particularly liked the chili crab. Be sure to order an extra bowl of rice because there is a lot of sauce. Don't forget the cold beer on tap."
Outdoor venue offering wide range of Street Foods,"We ate in a few Hawker Centres whilst in Singapore but rate this one as the better of them. Pick a table, remember the number and then go order your various foods and they will be brought to your table. It’s a popular spot with locals and tourists alike."
Great variety & fairly prices,"We found this centre and this is one of the bigger Food courts!
There are loads of stalls and most of them sell a variety of similar things but in attended the food comes quickly and tastes good! And it’s VALUE for MONEY. Will definitely return"
Many Excellent,"A short walk from the Newton MRT you will find the food center. Although many were closed when we arrived 1:30 pm on Friday,there were enough choices. Plenty of places to sit in the shade. Very reasonable prices. We got our food from stall #31. Great meal."
What an amazing experience,"When in Singapore, a visit to a Hawker Centre is a must. I read the many good and bad reviews of the Newton Centre but was glad I decided to make my own mind up.
Not really knowing what to expect, we arrived at what can only be described as an open air food court on a massive scale and throngs of people everywhere.
Probably the best advice I would give is to take your time, browse the eateries before taking your seat and don’t be badgered into anything (they aren’t meant to but do).
We enjoyed some terrific food including a prawn in crab sauce which had been recommended by a local guy at the table beside us, turned out it was a special recipe he had concocted with one of the chefs, delicious.
We didn’t find it overly pricey for what we ate and drank although the Tiger beers seemed to be the best value.
Great way to spend our last night in Singapore."
AWESOME EXPERIENCE!!!,"if you want to try local foods, this is the best place to be... the prices are reasonable and cheaper compare with other restaurants.. just what i have said to my friends, when crazy asians invades the crazy rich asians' hub!!!"
Quick cheap late night food,"Went here with my wife for a late night meal, after arriving on late flight at Changi. We could walk here from our serviced apartment. Lots of choice and still buzzing at midnight on a Sunday. We had Nasi Goreng and an ice cold beer. Great value for money."
No 49 - Denmark Seafood,"Lots of different food stalls. Pick a table, remember the number of the table and order food at any of the stalls - the friendly staff will deliver the food to your table. No49 serves tasty BBQ stingray, try the baby kailan with garlic and the black peppered beef. It gets a bit crowded on weekends."
Great atmosphere but I feel this is more for tourists.,"A lot of food stalls but not much choice of foods, lots of grilled type of food like satay, chicken wings, plenty of stalls selling sea food. I go there for the experience but would prefer eating and other food courts next time."
Great place,Always great to eat here always good and very friendly.You can always find something you like to eat here with fast service
Fun!,"Nice and fun atmosphere. Very crowded. There are many great food, fresh fruit and drink choices. Very clean."
First visit to Hawkers Centre. Naive. Loved it.,"I am sure that connoisseurs of Hawker Centres may have a less than positive view of this facility but as first time attendees we thoroughly loved it. Vast array of food. Endless choice. All good. Expensive, maybe to those in the know, but not to us. Very busy, fun environment.

After this experience went to other hawker centres in Singapore and Penang. Different. Good. Some cheaper, some not. For us this was a great welcome to Singapore"
Very touristy and the grumpy stallholders,"Its not about the food here, its about being the closest hawker to Orchard Road and overcharging for very mediocre food... with a grumpy frowny face. Even Lau Par Sat is more authentic and has nicer hawkers."
Authentic Singaporean cuisine?,"Locals said Newton Hawker Center is for tourists and foreigners. Locals said prices here are higher than local hawkers. Food here is amazing. I recommend eating here with a lot of friends or family to enjoy different choices of food.

Food stalls offers plastic gloves, tissues and plastic spoon and fork upon your order.

Kinda disappointed that local iced tea here is already in can. I’m actually expecting a freshly brewed iced tea.

Best time to visit: NIGHT"
Roti john,Not so good just ok teh o big ok a lot of seafood stall and some indian stall selling naan tandoor. Not so good as before.
Not as good as it used to be,"The hawker centre is a convenient short walk from the MRT. There is a fair choice of hawker 'stalls' and the area is well maintained. The prices of the satay were standard for all of Singapore however I was disappointed with the quality and small serving of sauce. It's much better at the Satay by the Bay.

First started coming here 20 years ago, then it was fantastic, now no longer so and my this was my last visit."
High Prices,"I have lived in Singapore for many years and occasionally go here. Certainly it is clean and always has a decent amount of people but my two comments would be that the prices are exorbitant-almost up to restaurant levels based solely on the fact that tourists go there and there is not always a good selection of stalls open. If you are in Singapore for a short time it is worth a visit to experience a hawker center but if you have time hire a bike and cycle up to the one on the East Coast Parkway, cheaper and with a better selection and atmosphere."
Dishonest pricing,"Went to Newton food center today late afternoon, bought mutton masala and garlic nan from one of their stalls. But a man served us from another stall which was the stall we sitting in front of them. Look at the price tag. It was a big difference, and it has other size to choose. Asked the stall keeper to change my order, they refused to changed it until I told them I would feedback to Singapore Tourism Board and my husband was paying the bill. I told them i feel cheated. I went back to the stall I ordered food to take photos. They already pull down the door gate. After a while, the stall keeper apologized for it. But I feel that I should draw others attentions on it, please be careful about those different prices for same food. Dishonest businessmen are taking advantage of consumers."
Lots of options,"Been to this food market a few times while staying in the local area. The options are the usual mix of asian specialities. Lots of choices. Service is friendly and prompt. Don't expect a gourmet experience, but if you are after decent ""fast"" asian food at a good price, then it does well."
This place lives up to its reputation for great choice local food.,"Dinner here is more enjoyable as temperature is a slightly cooler than the day, so better to enjoy a spicy banana leaf wrapped skate wing cooked to perfection. Seafood is so tasty and fresh here. The food stalls smell fantastic as you walk by. There is so much to enjoy and the prices are reasonable. There is so much to like about this place."
Chili Crab at Hawker centre,"We came to the Newton Food Centre by MRT subway to try the chili crab. The person at the hotel concierge suggested that we come here to get the best price; also to get here before 6:00 pm to avoid the crowds. Other places, especially in the downtown area, will charge an exorbitant price for the dish. After arriving at the hawker centre, we walked around checking out some of the shops that sold chili crab. A friend recommended us trying chili crab from the Alliance Seafood, which we ended up doing. This is the first time that we had chili crab, so it's difficult to compare. But we found it very tasty. One more item off our list of to-do's."
Hawker night and day,"We visited at night and for lunch. More atmosphere and busier at night, whereas Tekku Centre, in Little India and Amoy St Hawkers both were better at lunchtime.
Had delicious chilli crab from store 42(?). Tucked in corner. Store beside, 43 Indian Kitchen served us best Indian we had in Singapore. Chicken tikka and fish kebab roll was the perfect lunch choice.
Clean and spacious and only two stops on MRT from our hotel."
A must do in Singapore,Always on my list to visit when in Singapore the chilli crab is amazing. Walk around and check all the stores and compare prices and service.
New fresh look.,"First visit since refurbishment of old centre. Great place to eat. Very safe area to visit.
With 80 plus vendors, there is something for everyone. The place is spotless, with cleaners continuously cicling the venue.
I have read that people say it is expensive. This is untrue for what you get. First class meals in a relaxed environment. Very suitable for kids as well.
Joe.
Melbourne."
Just gets better each time,"Been here many a time over the years, used to be very popular with local families, food was served on banana leaves and apart from chopsticks, the utensil of choice was your hands.

Roll on 20 years, the hawker stands are all on the outside of the open air area, pick a stand/food style you like and enjoy, some places give you a pager to let you know when your food is ready.

We arrived as a party of 7, all wanting different food, this place is ideal, just getting a table is the hardest part. My favourite stand is no 31, try the stingray, absolutely fantastic, with seafood fried rice and morning glory veg dripping with garlic. Indonesian, Thai, local Singapore and Indian as well as traditional and specialised Chinese is all available.

Prices are getting higher, but as usual we over ordered, about $25 Singapore dollars for a fabulous meal"
Night eats - the best!,"There are not many outdoor hawker centres in Singapore now - this might be the last one.

Great atmosphere, lots of yummy food and so very fun. It can get pricey so it's not a ""cheap eat"" anymore, but so worthwhile.

It's featured in ""CRAZY RICH ASIANS""... added bonus! So cool to promote the hawkers."
Great choice of food,Visited at about 8.00 on a Friday night and really struggled to get a table. You can obviously eat from any of the stalls but the tandoori on the outside was great for authentic Indian food.
Still love India Palace,"Been to Newton Hawker at least 10 times over the last 4 years. Continue to love the food from India Palace. Always great. My daughter’s favourite Indian food in Singapore and high on my list as well.

If you go to Newton, watch out for ordering from the seafood restaurants that charge by the 100 grams. You can get left with a huge bill. Stick with the set menu prices.

And also be sure to check out the microbrew stalls. Good pints!"
Went to find the Michelin starred Hainenese chicken stall..,"....which was unfortunately closed, but we found another stall selling it and it was absolutely delicious! One of my best meals during a week in Singapore where most other meals were taken in 5* hotel restaurants!!"
"Tourist place, similar menus, ok price","The menus and stalls all selling the same items, more or less. Seafood, satay, grilled stuff, prawn mee, carrot cake. there are some other options but quite few. Food can be expensive and can be similar depending on items. Quality and taste not really good and don't really think it's a good show of all the food in SG. Good place to hang out with friends."
Never fails,"Always good service, piping hot food and the stall holders so so friendly! Restaurants could learn a lot from visiting"
Enjoyable and satisfying,"Hawker Centre serving Malay, Chinese, Indian and I would say all Singapore food in 1 place. Had the kaki kambing soup which is thick and tasty and succulent tendon.
Patrons a halal seafood stall
Having the lala (5 star), baby kailan (4), Black pepper beef (3), sambal sting Ray (5), chili crab (5). All the seafood plus 2 rice cost 90sgd. Looking forward to another visit"
"If you are young and are interested in eating a lot , you should visit.","Huge food center.
So if you are young (want to eat with little money), I recommend to visit here.
And you can try wide variety of food.
Atmosphere in the food center is so local. Then you can feel like you are part of Singapore.
もしバラエティに富んだシンガポール料理を楽しみたければ、ぜひこちらへ。リーズナブルな価格で多くの料理を楽しめます。エイのグリルがおすすめです。雰囲気はまさにシンガポーリアンの一般家庭の外食という感じで、楽しめます。"
Don't go for lunch,"This is primarily a place to go for dinner, as 2/3 the stalls are closed at lunchtime. Rather disappointing."
The best Stingray and beer !!,"I really love the Newton Hawker centre. It has been one of my favourites in Singapore for the last 15 years since the first time I had ever gone there and though now it has changed from way back then the food is still the same. The stingray here is to die for, the best I’ve ever tasted and coupled with beer, it can’t get better than that! There are variety of other cuisines available too like Indian food with roti and naan and chicken tikka. But nothing can quite beat that stingray they make over there."
Great hawker food,We had chicken laksa from the store called ‘XO minced meat noodle’. Was delicious & very good quality for a hawker market. Just to note though - it seems the stalls don’t open till about 12.30. Initially there weren’t many open when we arrived midday. But this changed by 1pm and the market got quite busy.
It Never Fail You,"It is one of the best supper place in Singapore. It used to be haunted by overpriced and taunted issues. It has much improved now. Oyster Omelette, Grill Stingray, Fish Porridge, Popiah, Satay, Sup Buntut, Sup Tulang, and many more. Yummy Tasty... Some stall operators and their crews may look like gangsters!!!, Don't judge them by the look. Many of them can remember you and your orders!!!! They are friendly and make you feel welcomed.!!!! Well, despite all the goods, the after 1am crowd is getting lesser and lesser compared to thoses days. Guessed, it was partly the Alchohol Restrictions. Most of the stalls are keeping the fighting spirit to provide the best food to their regulars and patrons. Bravo."
Who said Singapore has to be expensive,I enjoy the Hawker Centre. Tiger beer $7 for a quart and then meals from about $4-50. Who said Singapore had to be expensive. Easy walk from Newton MRT. Worth a visit
The best stingray and prawns at Denmark stall no 49,"Every year without fail , I must visit this place. It has the best of everything. Service is superb and food is excellent. The prawns are huge and cooked to perfection and the stingray sambal was so yum. They even ordered for me otak otak and chicken wings without me leaving my table from another stall. Wonderful service indeed for a hawker stall."
Many food choices,"This is a great place to eat. There's lots of different food stalls and foods to choose from. Take the time to walk around before you choose where to eat. The stallholders can be aggressive about getting you to eat with them. We just said no and walked away. We ended up eating sate - a mix of chicken and beef - $7 for 10. We bought a plate of kang kong ($10) from another vendor. Good sate, delicious kang kong.
I had a sugar cane juice with sour plum - a delicious and refreshing sweet salty sour taste. My partner had craft beer - Dunkels dark beer.
It's easy to get overwhelmed here, so take your time and don't be pushed into eating somewhere by a vendor.
There's a place where you can wash your hands as well.
Easy to get to on the MRT. Follow the signs when you leave the station."
Great food,The best hawker center in my opinion. Just get on the longest line and you'll be in for a treat. Expect to spend 5 to 7 S$. Great food. The chicken rice at tan tan is to die for
Oyster omellete.,Love going here for the food and atmsphere oyster omelette blanched greens and oyster sauce and large Tiger beer doesnt get any better.
Great Food Great Value,"Garlic prawns, beef and chicken satays, fried rice, singapore noodles and cold Tiger beer what more could you ask for.
Great value. Spotlessly clean. Friendly service. All the vendors will help you choose and deliver it to your table.
Easy to get to. 5 min walk to MRT."
Be careful,A group of us well travelled business people who were there for FHA and another government sponsored conference decided to go to experience the local flair. Unfortunately there are some very unsavoury operators there and it ruined our night. I would say that at least half of the operators do the right thing but it shouldn’t be that you have to be on your toes for a city like Singapore which prides itself on being honest and reliable. We had two vendors surprise us with charges such as $100/kg for tiger prawns and squids. The authorities need to check on this as it leaves s bad taste in ones mouth and will have an effect on our thoughts about future stays in Singapore.
All under one roof,"If you are short of time and eager to see the varieties of food the Singapore has to offer, can can do that here at one go. However, since this is a touristy place, be ready to pay a premium vs other better deals in other corners of Singapore."
Pricey and somewhat overwhelming,"This hawker market is really more for tourists than locals and as such the prices are much higher than the markets locals would eat at. The proprietors are outside their stalls touting which makes it difficult to walk around, read the menus and select what you'd like to eat. They seat you outside their stall so if someone in your party wants something from another stall it makes it difficult to do so. An interesting place to go but I know there are other hawker markets in Singapore where you'd get better value."
