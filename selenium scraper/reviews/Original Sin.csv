Fantastic vegetarian Restaurant,"I’m not a vegetarian but eating here was enough to convince me to convert, the food was fantastic dish after dish was superb I wish I could of eaten more but I had a good attempt to eat more than what was possible but I got to take home the leftovers so that the food fest can continue tonight.
I can’t recommend this restaurant enough it’s no wonder it’s been here for over 25 years"
Visit to Original Sin,"Food variety, taste and ambience - Excellent. Friendly staffs! Best place to have a meet up or celebrations!"
It ain’t what it used to be…,"Returned back to Singapore after 2 years to a place which was a favourite. Truly disappointing. The menu was relatively uninspiring, so I went for the Meatball spaghetti arrabbiata pasta.

Unfortunately no amount of salt, ground pepper, or crush chillies could revive a dish so unsavoury and dead.

I had to ask the waiter if the ownership had changed? He said no.

I had arranged to meet an old friend here for lunch next week. I am cancelling it."
Very pricey for the food and service,"We had a reservation for 8 pm, we were told that the kitchen would be taking last orders at 8:30 pm (which is quite early for a Friday night). In fact, at 9 pm we were asked to order the dessert already and served immediately, while we were still having main course. Reason: kitchen was closing for some spraying work. The dessert had melted by the time we finished our maincourse. Quite disappointed with the service.

Food taste wasn't great. We ordered a mezze platter, Kashmiri pizza.

The restaurant was quite noisy as well.

Overall, quite a poor experience and the damage to the wallet wasn't justified. Wouldn't visit again."
Over-priced unimaginative menu - below par food,"We were a party of mainly vegetarians and this restaurant was recommended by local friends. The menu was like a throw back to 1980s 'niche' European vegetarian restaurants. The prices are shockingly high, even for expensive Singapore, for example relative to price, the portion of spanakopita as a main course was tiny and tasteless and the accompanying stuffed mushrooms was a 1970s throwback - tasteless and watery. This is not an expensive dish to make. The food quality were so ordinary , it was like it had been bought from a supermarket deli. The pizzas were the equivalent of frozen pizzas. Our son said his University cafe did better pizzas - that is a real indictment of this place. The mixed mezze was largely tasteless and the falafels dry. The only bright spot was the tasty roasted peper dip. I honestly think it a trip to Cold Storage across the road in Holland Village will yield similar items at a better price and quality. I am not sure if the owners have realised the world of European vegetarian menus has moved on significantly. Please go and buy a cookbook by Yotam Ottolenghi and other chefs. Please acquaint yourself with what restaurant owners are doing in the 21st century with tasty and imaginative Mediterranean style vegetarian dishes.
On the positive, our servers were efficient, polite and helpful."
"Lovely menu, old Singapore feel","i know this restaurant has been there for ages as I lived above it more than 8 years ago but never tried it as I favour non veg dining. However, I tried it as was with some vegetarian friends and the food was excellent and the service very personable and friendly. It definitely has the feel of a family run restaurant (don't know if it is or not). Recommend!"
"Premium food, kopitiam service","I've visited Original Sin many times over the past 25 years, and over time the food and service have always matched the Mediterranean feel.
Nowadays the food is still special, but the front of house service is just farce.
The Filipino chap does a good job, but the locals sound and act like they would be more at home in a kopitiam. They have all the class of a plastic bucket full of soiled melamine plates.
For a while I was wondering whether they were being rude on purpose, as part of some sort of free dinner entertainment. Surely nobody could be _this_ bad at service in a fancy restaurant.
I know we're facing a talent crunch in Singapore, but the owners would be better off handing out iPads for patrons to place their order directly with the kitchen than to keep these goons on staff."
Worst Italian food experience in a while. Bad ingredients and expensive food,The pasta wasn’t fresh and the pizza was worse quality than Domino’s. Extremely overpriced and small portions. A small beer costs 14 SGD and the house wine 2 for 25… take your money elsewhere or be sure to be disappointed.
Vegetarian Cuisine,"A vegetarian restaurant serving Mediterranean cuisine. Still a popular place for locals on a Saturday afternoon. Reservations preferred. Warmer than usual indoors the service was acceptable although understaffed. Ordered their Mezzanine Platter and Beet root salad for sharing with 3. Portions were generous and the food tasted acceptable. The hummus and beet root dip tasted good with the pita bread. The salad with avocado, beetroots and green veggies were good tasting too! Price was in the mid to high range. One can get a $32 lunch set of 3 dishes."
What a come down!,"Original Sin used to be a wonderful eatery in Singapore. Mediterranean, vegetarian fare but made with a full focus on flavor. Dined there yesterday and found the food stodgy, tasteless, poor quality. Bland and mushy Moussaka, tasteless dips on the mezze platter and a simple Caesar salad that was drowned in the dressing. Asked the staff and they mentioned that the chef had changed. To crown the evening, we found the restrooms were dirty. It's a pricey restaurant, so I'd advise: take your money elsewhere!"
Vegetarian,"This vegetarian restaurant at chip bee gardens has been around for decades and became quite the institution. We had the mezze appetiser plate, sphagetti and buco. All ok and service too"
Amazing meal,Arrived for lunch. We had the Magic mushroom for starters and risotto for mains. Absolutely amazing. Well done
ORIGINAL SIN RESTAURANT,Excellent food and service. Really enjoyable experience with very friendly staff. I am sure it is very popular in Singapore.
Good food,"Though vegetarian, the menu was varied and the food was good. Service staff could be more attentive. Price a bit on the high side."
Original Yum!,I recently dined at Original Sin with my friend. We sat outside on the patio and it was cosy. The service was perfect. Servers knew exactly when to be there and when not to be there. We shared several dishes and even had room for dessert! The food was delicious and fresh.
Good food but spoilt by poor air-conditioning,"Food was good and I would have given it a 4 to 5 for it - Vodka Pasta and the Veggie Burger was excellent. However, the ambiance and atmosphere has dropped since I last visited as the place was very stuffy and the airconditioning did not appear to be working . There was an unsightly stand fan trying to help the situation but this only worked for one family directly in front of the fan. Disappointing to say the least for a meal that was supposed to be a birthday celebration for the wife."
If you want vegeterian but mild spicy non indian food,"Excellent vegetarian mid eastern food. The mezze platter and Kashmir Pizza is really unique. Lot of good pita bread. Friendly staff and both indoor and outdoor dining. Better to do reservation, the place is normally full."
Going Downhill,"I have been a frequent visitor at Original Sin over the years. The food has always been great, service efficient.
However, the last couple of visits have been a disappointment. While food was still good, gaps have come - no vanilla ice cream to accompany desserts - and this for set lunches!!
The service has declined - on two visits, the aircon was not working- the visits were spaced over two weeks. The coffee or tea had to be asked for repeatedly!"
Poor,"Mediterranean cuisine, Mezze platter taste was not authentic at all. We wasted our money & evening on the food, price was overcharged & quality was poor."
Healthy and Reliable,"I tend to enjoy my meals at Original In, which I frequent routinely. Quality ingredients, tasty and fresh, competently executed. Set lunch prices have gone up amid Covid, but still offer relative value when ala carte prices are taken into account a pet peeve is how the burrata. cheese always runs out, as it did again today at lunch when I ordered the spaghetti burrata. It’s happened all too frequently for me! But nonetheless, a healthy, reliable and pleasing casual lunch venue."
Excellent Food,"We have not been back to OS in quite a while so decided on a last minute family lunch. Restaurant was packed so it was a good idea to book ahead. Parking at the Holland Village area is getting a bit difficult so it is recommended to Grab there. The food service is pronto and perhaps a bit too quick. But to be fair, the server did ask if we wanted all dishes coming at the same time. Nonetheless, we enjoyed the hummus platter, thin crusted pizza and truffle fries. The venue is great place for any vegan or vegetarian but the variety of dishes offers diversity. Highly recommended place for a family meal."
Unique Mediterranean Vegetarian food,"Went to celebrate my mum's birthday - no birthday special not even a slice of cake which was a tad disappointing

Appetiser platter, and lasagne were yummy! Al funghi Pizza was average, perhaps because we prefer crispy Italian versions. Portions are a little small.

Likely due to wireward withdrawal in Sin, they only accept paynow, Amex and bank transfer. No cash payment due to covid."
Average food,"Food is very average tasting, definitely not worth the price. I will give the Tandoori skeweer a miss"
vegetarian pizza,"grandma loves the vegetarian pizzas here, so we opted for the funghi pizza for takeaway. wished that we could have dined here like in the past, but our family would burst the current 5pax group limit under current Covid restrictions."
Overall 4/5 A good choice,Overall 4/5 A good choice for vegetarian as the ingredients are fresh! Location: 4/5 Environment : 4/5 Food: 4/5 Service: 4/5
Dog poo,"Sat at the outdoors, poo spotted on the grass patch where i sat. Affected the whole dining experience."
Set lunches at sgd29++,"Met a friend for a quick lunch. We were surprised it was rather packed on a weekday( friday). About 5 main course items to choose from , for the Set lunches. I chose the spicy arrabiata , pumpkin soup and chocolate lave cake."
Nice choice around Holland,Nice choice around Holland Village. I had the lunch menu with the Falafel salad. It was very nice with a fair price. Service was good as well!
Yummy food.,I have been to this establishment three times and I enjoyed each time I go there. The food is superb and delicious and the service is excellent. I have tried almost every item on the menu.
A Mixed Experience,"My husband and I dined for dinner on a Saturday night. Our experience was definitely mixed with some highs and other lows.

We started with the sample platter, which has about five different spreads with pita bread. Overall, it was very delicious, and I was surprised that I liked the beetroot spread the best. For dinner, I ordered the special of risotto balls with vegetables and a red sauce. I found it to be simply delicious. My husband ordered the kabobs. He was very disappointed with the amount of meat on the kabobs, and he was left hungry after the entree. Thumbs down for him.

The service was very slow. Multiple times, we had to raise our hand for help... water, more water, dessert, check. One saw this happening at other tables too, so the restaurant was clearly understaffed."
Not vegetarian! Cheeses have rennet!!!,"Sadly, this restaurant still sources cheeses that contain animal rennet. So please ask for vegan cheese even if you are a vegetarian. Have a chat with Satish who can help you navigate through the menu if you are vegetarian but not necessarily vegan."
Very nice restaurant w excellent service,"Very nice restaurant w outdoor seating and a large selection of vegetarian options. The service was excellent (thanks Zul & Kenneth). The food came promptly and they took care to keep our water glasses full. Went there for my wife’s birthday dinner, and they made it worthwhile."
Food taste average,Food taste average with high price. Location is nice. Very cosy atmosphere at this neighborhood. Nice deco. Service was good.
Amazing non-typical vegetarian food,"They have a good variety of vegetarian food, the food quality is also really high. We've tried a few of the mains, and all were very impressive."
Food is great!,My friends loved the food there and were surprised to know that it was a vegetarian/vegan restaurant.
"Poor quality food, high prices and crazy rip-off drinks - avoid","Service ok, food overpriced for what it is, average vegetarian food. Cheap ingredients, average cooking and high prices. Drinks a rip-off - they appear to be in on the Singapore joke - rip off your customers on drinks. A small beer at $14 vs a large beer at the hawker shop for <$7 makes it 4x the price, what a joke.

Also, don't be fooled by the crowd, it's honestly not that good. Overrated and really not that nice. Check the reviews, hardly glowing are they when you look a little closer. Won't be back, very, very disappointing."
Overpriced,"Service was a bit slow. Really looking forward to the pasta arriabiata but turned out to be quite tasteless, no chilli taste, The decor could do with an update.
The email confirmation had a link where one could purchase vouchers to get a 10% discount but it declined both my credit cards, and the restaurant could not help ☹️."
"5 star food, 2 star service","I've been a patron at OS for approximately 15 years and the food has always been consistent and excellent, and the Bosco Misto, in particular, is fabulous!

The noticeable difference of late however is how rapidly the service has declined. I was there on a Friday night and although the place was packed, it seemed as though there were an adequate number of staff. However, no one ever came to take our order or fill up our drinks -- we had to struggle to get the wait staff's attention several times during the night. This is at least the second consecutive time I've noticed a decline in service.

Overall, it's rare for a restaurant to survive in Singapore for as long as it has and I do hope the service levels pick up again."
Chill out place,Tucked away in one corner of Holland Village. Very relaxed atmosphere. We sat outside as the weather was cloudy and comfortable. Boon for veggie food. The menu is mediterranean inspired. Food presentation looked very appetising and so was the food. The service is prompt and friendly. Good place to hangout for lunch or dinner.
Nice,"A vegetarian restaurant serving food from many lands, Original Sin lures you with its quiet ambience, quick service & delicious food."
Good place to spend a quiet night with good food,We ordered veggie salad pizza and lasagna with a bottle of red wine. Food was tasty. We often dine in here when we just wanted a quiet night and enjoy a good food. Try and explore this restaurant 🤗
Underwhelming,"How this place still survives is a mystery to me. Is it absolutely terrible? No. Is the food any good? Not particularly. A friend suggested it, and I figured let’s try one more time, maybe it’s not as bad as I remember it to be. But it is.
This was I believe one of the first Vegetarian-Mediterranean restaurants in Singapore at a time when people really had very little choice if they wanted that sort of thing, captive audience. Well, times have changed. In the very same street are three or more cafes which all offer far better food for less money with better service. Here you get a peculiar mix of demotivated, resentful and patronising. A quick word on the food: I had a dry, unappetising, microwaved filo parcel which tasted of nothing much, with a few low quality dried out salad leaves. The kind you get in supermarket bags. For SGD 30,-. I have a high tolerance for pricing if the food is exceptional, but this just hurt. My friend did not say anything about her sad looking burger with fries - don’t want to spoil the mood. Definitely not recommended."
"Great food, staff service ... pause","Food is great, flavourful. You don't even miss meat at all. Love the masala eggplant and the entrèè appertiser. One female staff give unpleasant face, service is slow when we asked for our drinks, have to wait for at least 10 mins, maybe it's fully packed on Saturday night."
Nice n relaxing,"I love the lemongrass fritters! The aircon at where we were ushered to was faulty, the staff were more than ready to shift us to a more ventilated table. Enjoying experience overall."
Wonderful food and great service,We had a wonderful meal. The food and wine were perfect and the service was prompt. We enjoyed our dinner.
Amazing Vegetarian Food,"Staff are incredibly friendly and the chef's pizza was an absolute delight.
Lovely to sit outside under the Roof Fans, Enjoy the warm weather and indulge in one of the best Pizza's I've ever eaten.

Whilst I did not get to try the other things on their Menu I saw others in the restaurant thoroughly enjoying their meal.

Highly recommend for everyone!"
Original Sin - Vegetarian restaurant,"Dinner @originalsinrestaurant. Fun evening with some close friends.
This place used to be our go to for every celebration when we landed in Singapore. Over the years we discovered new places. So the expectation was high when we went back after a long time.
The grilled haloumi salad and lemon grass and corn fritter were good. The highlight of the meal were the Bosco Misto (spinach, tofu and feta patty served with a plum sauce) and the Gnocchi.
The mezze platter and the absolut pasta... well they were not up to original form. The uniqueness in the pasta was the vodka flambé which elevated the flavour. That was missing. The mezze platter was average.
The tiramisu and the GF Apple crumble were both excellent. The restaurant has both vegan and GF options."
Very good vegetarian italian,"Very nice menu with large variety, decent prices, 28 for lasagna of great taste, decent portion not too big. Service was very good, deserts amazing"
Fabolous Meal,"I have been to this restaurant twice and the food was fantastic on both occasion, look forward to eating here more."
We had better expectations,"The restaurant was average, the menu is a mix of cultures but not super diverse, it looks like a mess, so you do have few options but none of my friends (we were 12 people) really enjoy their meals...
We really don’t wanna go back, it’s better to try new places.
Service was extremely slow..
The only tasty thing was the falafel .."
Simple and nice ambience,Loved the ambience. We had been there yesterday for my husband’s birthday and we sat outside. Tried Mediterranean cuisine for the 1st time. Ordered - Starter - Mezze Platter. Main - Moussaka. Items were freshly prepared.
"Bad service, mediocre food","I made reservations on Choke and received the confirmation email. When I arrived, they said there was no table for my party and told us we had to sit outside. The servers were impatient when we asked for water or condiments. The food was not terrible but some items like the soup and fries were not well-seasoned. For the cost, not worth coming."
Very Good Vegetarian / Vegan Option,"My family is predominately Carnivores, and hence I was skeptical to try any hardcore Vegan place. Furthermore, we needed a place that was Very Very clean and Hygienic since we had a post-operative person.

Original Sin - Did Not Disappoint !
Sunday lunch time was packed, as yet our table was ready. The menu has a little of everything for all appetites. Food was freshly prepared in the Open kitchen, displaying their culinary skills and hygiene standards.

All in all, a place worth visiting and worth recommending. Well Done"
Great ambience !,Love the ambience we were there for my husband’s birthday and we sat outside like alfresco dining with a candle and it was rather romantic (: the olives and magic mushroom was very tasty. The risotto was a little under seasoned but the penne pasta was delicious! Great for a date night with your other half (:
Dining with friends,The food we ordered were good but it was very expensive compared with other vegetarian outlets of the same category. Food presentation could be better for the price paid.
Good food but a bit pricey,The menu is quite original. The food tastes really good. The staff is courteous and efficient. There are a lot of options for vegetarians. It’s a bit pricey though. But don’t mind paying a little extra for the quality. Would definitely visit again.
Amazing food,Very healthy and delicious food. The service was great. Enjoyed my dinner with my bestie here. Will definitely visit next time
Great food and spot on service,"Wonderful meals prepared by excellent chefs, service was spot on by the attentive staff especially Gopal. We had a bottle of nice Shiraz."
Lovely vibes with delicious vegetarian cuisines,Original Sin's been around for a long time but just never had the chance to try. Reservation for 2 to bring a colleague who just moved from Switzerland to Singapore and both of us enjoyed the lunch.
Great Veggie/Vegan Restaurant,Had a great experience here. Incredible food and the service was equally on point. Plenty to choose from so we'll be back again!
Good choice for vegetarains as this veg restauant with italian and european or veggie,"We have visited this restaurant as we were recommended as good choice for vegetarians.
We visited on 3rd March at 1.15 pm .Since it was very hot and humid we chose to sit inside . We had made our booking last morning though the tables inside were almost full and out side was totally empty , oribbalu we were early as per singapore standards.

My daughter settled for set menu lunch ( Burger or veggie bowl or Avocado ciabatta or spaghetti Arbita or creamy mushroom pasta ) and choice of non alcoholic drink and soup of the day or green salad .Thus for all 3 items SGD 24 , she settled for veggie burger , soup and lemon ginger drink . The burger had tofu as patti which is Ok .

I ordered singapore sling ( SGD 16) and my wife ordered fruit punch ( SGD 8)

We ordered Burrata cheese ball ( SGD 26) and Mezze platter ( SGD 22)
The Mezze platter was good and Burrata was bland and you need to have a taste for this item..

All the whole food was good but it is expensive side it cost us SGD 112.99"
Good vegetarian option,We went this place for my husbands birthday celebration. Food was good although he was not impressed. They have kids menu as well. I liked the presentation and taste. Price is on the higher side.
Incredible Food,Wonderful experience at this Mediterranean Vegetarian restaurant in Holland Village. Not only incredible food is served there but they have a very impressive wine list as well. This will become a regular place to go for me on my trips to Singapore.
Amazing pasta,"We tried the lasagna and the absolut penne and it was delicious! They definitely know how to cook pasta .Portions are huge and hearty. Overall great experience. I did find the restaurant a little bit confusing. White table cloths but not upscale and the waiters were a bit all over the place but overall nice lunch!
Oh- the lava cake we had was not great. Took 2 mins from the time we ordered to the time we got it which leads me to believe that they popped it in the microwave"
Excellent food. Great value,Lunch - we tried the Lunch menu and were very pleased with the service and quality. The cappuccino and latte were excellent. Highly recommend the restaurant.
Lunch on a day off !,"Took the day off and had a nice lunch with my daughter and it was a great lunch!

The mushroom was grilled to perfection and the pesto pasta was delicious

The service was also great and the staff knew we were sharing the food and offered us sharing dishes even before we had to ask for it.. nice and intuitive..

Definitely will be back ..."
Excellent lunch!,"We had a most satisfying business lunch at this Mediterranean/Italian vegetarian restaurant recently.

As a consummate meat lover, I was once again reminded that vegetarian cuisine can be just as exquisite as any other meal when well executed.

The chef’s special of eggplant/aubergine and zucchini/courgette parmigiana was absolutely delicious! It was also very substantial.

We loved everything about our meal, including the freshly baked bread, kale salad and warm chocolate cake served with vanilla ice cream.

The staff were professional - both attentive and prompt.

Highly recommended!

Note: Do check out some apps for amazing lunch/dinner deals."
Lunch,"Tasty and good vegetarian food. The service was great and prompt. The venue is a regular shop space and we have to be seated outside, facing the road. Worth the visit."
Excellent experience,"This Italian cum Mediterranean restaurant is on a street with many other restaurants by the side, and so obviously only if it is good can it survive the competition. It has outdoor and indoor seating, serves only vegetarian food with vegan and gluten free options. We expected just a few dishes on the menu, but were surprised to see a range of starters and main course dishes. The mezza plate was excellent with felafels, feta cheese balls, beetroot dip (simply amazing), hummus, almond dip and bread. We ordered 6 dishes in all for the 6 of us, including pesto pasta (superb) and lasagna, and each one of them was made well and presented well. Service was attentive and very courteous."
Good vegetarian place,My girlfriend and I had Spanakopita and Bosco misto respectively and both were fantastic! They were tasty and delicious!Be aware that not all cheese served are vegan cheese if you are particular. The crowd wasn’t loud and rowdy on a Saturday evening. The service staffs were attentive and refilled my drink numerous times.
"Decent food, good ambiance","We have been visiting Original Sin off and on. Great place for vegetarians. Some dishes are spectacular, some not so great. Service is good. Had an enjoyable evening."
The food was very healthy but taste was average,"I went there as one of our colleagues was vegan and I read that Original Sin offers vegan and non vegan options. The menu was very interesting with lots of healthy greens. We ordered a burrata cheese to share and the cheese was amazingly fresh and pita bread tasted good. My vegan friend had ordered an avocado ciabatta which we specifically requested for vegan option. However, when the dish came, the bread was whitish which made us question if the bread is vegan but the chef claim so... Other than that, the taste was average and the cost may be too expensive, not value over money."
Interesting vegetarian restaurant,The choice of menu is a good mixture of all kind of vegetable. Never expect the dishes can be so tasty with all vegetables.
Good Vegetarian food,"We were there on Monday night. The restaurant is in residential neighborhood easy to get too via MRT. It has large variety of vegetarian and vegan food. The food was well prepared and tasty. The staff was attentive. It is on expensive side, especially when not in prime neighborhood.Mamta B."
Decent food but not worth the money,"Except the fact it’s a vegetarian Italian restaurant, the price is at the high side, the King oyster mushroom (mushroom and potato) cost around $29+tax."
Awesome food as always and superb service,Not my first visit to original sin and definitely not my last . Food is always done perfectly with so many different layers of taste for a single dish
Delicious!,"Had great Vegeterian, med. food here! The tandoori platter is a must try. Wine was well paired. Highly recommended!"
delicious vegetarian meal,Hearty portion and dish is well seasoned tho price is definitely on the higher side. Went with entertainers app.
Awesome food!!,Food was awesome!! The food was really good and even the atmosphere was also good. We visited with friends and all of us enjoyed the food.
Not a vegetarian but this food is amazing!,"I’m a regular here and it never disappoints. Lovely atmosphere, great service and best of all fantastic food!"
Great food great service,"It's my second visit to original sin. Great food, prompt servicr from their staff and nice ambience! With the aid of the entertainer app, its a bonus. Nontheless, I enjoyed their food and service."
Nothing Great!,"Dine in on a Saturday as we both are vegetarian, we ordered the lemon grass corn fritters which was nothing tasty, it was not properly fried; could still feel the batter. Although the mayonnaise helped in eating as it tasted not bad.
As the main course we ordered the spaghetti buratta; although it had enough cheese on it, it still was not delicious, the red sauce was not impressive at all.
Another main course was the Kashmir Pizza, they were not stingy with the toppings; the tandoori sauce was lacking.
Overall the food was nothing great, won’t be coming back."
Excellent vegetarian restaurant,"We , a vegetrain family decided to visit the Original sin, nicely tucked in around Holland Village. It was one of our better meals in Singapore with a wide variety of vegetarian options - especially mediterrean. You must try this place - . Food is well presented, very nicey flavoured - a bit expensive but well worth the visit- A must go"
Good but pricey vegetarian food,"Plenty of options for vegetarians. We had the gnocchi (30), risotto (30), lasagne (29), Bosco misto (29), truffle fries, tiramisu (12) and apple crumble (12). Nothing to fault on any dish, but the bosco misto and the gnocchi were probably the best and the tiramisu was spot on. Portion sizes were good too. I'm not too sure if I would go there again. It's not that the food wasn't good but there was nothing exciting about it."
Great food as usual!,The food was very good even for fussy eater who don't like veg! 3 of us truly enjoyed the meal. We had the creamy mushroom pasta which was very creamy and flavorful! The chocolate lava cake with ice-cream was heavenly too!
Good restaurant,"The restaurant's ambience never disappoints me, the only complain on the day would be its service was a bit slow because it was really busy."
Great Experience at Original Sin,"The restaurant is easy to locate, and near to Holland Village MRT (5-10 minute walk). Accessible by bus and car as well. Tends to be on the pricier side... depending on one's budget. The mains fall within the $20-$30 price range. But the food and dessert were wonderful. They also serve alcoholic beverages which we did not try... but the staff are also friendly and helpful."
Original Sin - Vegetarian/Vegan Italian fine dining restaurant,"This is a fine dine pure vegetarian/vegan restaurant serving italian/ meditarranian cuisine. Starters were delicious with a wide variety. They also have daily specials. OFfers both outdoor sitting as well as airconditioned sitting inside. Service is good and portions are adequate. We were 3 and we ordered 1 starter and 3 dishes....and we could not finish. Pizza is thin crust with good options for toppings. So was pasta and their tandoori platter is unique. Only down side on tandoori platter is - there is rice served but there is no gravy or sauce to go with rice and hence is a bit dry to eat.
Overall, restaurant continues to offer good quality vegetarian / vegan food with an option for no garlic/no onion (yippee- for a person like me) :)"
Nothing extraordinary,"Three years ago the food here had let us down... we decided to put that behind us and had dinner here on a weekday. The staff seemed pretty friendly and cordial and much of the place was unoccupied.
We chose a table outside (bad choice) and it was pretty humid with very scant breeze. We ordered for a bowl of olives, burrata and bread sticks and lasagna The food was okay and nothing extraordinary. All in all it was an okay-ish dinner. The surprise of the evening was the person who came to take our drinks order. We ordered for a dark rum and the person was unaware that rum was also non-white."
Original Sin also refers to the décor!,"We used to come here (and its sister restaurant and neighbour Michelangelo) a lot when it first opened in the mid-90’s, then stopped when more exciting Italian dining options became available 10 years ago. For some reasons, Original Sin has always attracted a heavily-expat clientèle. It is interesting to note that the customer mix has changed from primarily European to primarily Indian, reflecting the changing expat community in Singapore. What has not changed? First, the décor, which now looks distinctly dated, down to the stains on the bench and chairs! Secondly, the food remains delicious, although one notices changes in the menu - maybe to accommodate new customer preferences? (They now serve veggie tandoori, and moved veggie burger out of the main menu). Prices are not high (especially the set lunch which is very good value). Service is knowledgeable and competent (unlike at the outlet next door). So, I guess we would go back here again!"
What a disappointment for a birthday celebration,"Celebrated my birthday with some friends on 2 may for lunch. The starter and main went well although the restaurant was busy. Decided to have dessert to wrap up the meal. 1st disappointment: Ordered the chocolate lava cake and it came with a plate of melted ice cream on a lava cake with no lava flowing out (I have pictures, will post it on TripAdvisor since here doesn’t allow me to post). 2nd disappointment: ordered a latte and the cup came with one of the ugliest latte art (or maybe there’s no art). My expectation is higher because I’ve always like Michelangelo's restaurants for their fine standard in dining. Yesterday’s lunch was a disappointment. Saw the lady manager running in and out of the restaurant on the phone but no staff actually asked the guests how was the food. And we have to ask the staff to top up our water a few times."
Nice Vegerarian Restaurant,"Kind staffs, great food,especially the dessert. Spend our valentine's day there. Will go back to try out the a la carte menu."
A lovely vegetarian restaurant,"Visited Original Sin for a friend’s birthday. We had a large table outside under the canopy, it happened to be a large storm when we were there so we were nice and cosy under the cover. The staff were very attentive and made sure we had enough drinks throughout our time there. I enjoyed the Mezze Platter which had hummus, pumpkin and beetroot dips, falafel balls and warm pitta bread - it was delicious. Had a quinoa salad for my main with onions, feta and a very nice lemon and balsamic vinaigrette. Will definitely be back again."
Fabulous vegetarian,Second time been and the food and service got even better. The pasta dishes in particular .. and creative way they bring out flavour of the vegetables without swamping in garlic or other flavour gongs to bee compensate. We had vegan guests who were just as happy ..
A trusted eating spot in Holland Village catering nicely to vegetarians,"A friend had wanted to visit this establishment for some time. And so we finally ---- did. No disappointment. We had Vegetable Tandoori and Marsala Eggplant. Service was professional and courteous. The chefs clearly knew the menu and all was good.

Clearly Original Sin knows its business - and it shows. Its regulars and fans are testimony to its sustained success."
I went twice in one weekend.,"I was only in SGP for 3 days and went here twice.

We had the corn fritters (massive portion), the dukkah (twice), the antipasti, the tandoori veg and the broccoli pesto and a lava cake. It was all good.

There is the option to turn many of the dishes into vegan dishes. The service was friendly and timely. The wine list was short but perfectly fine. The have decent wines by the glass.

Inside has quite fierce air con, which they said couldn't be adjusted so we moved tables.
Outside, if the weather's good, is very pleasant indeed."
Super Delicious Food!,The Bosco Misto was the highlight of the night! Really flavourful and delicious with a nice texture that is sure to suit the palate of many. The pizzas and pastas were good too. Worth it with the Entertainer App!
