Good food but such a rip off!!!!,"We went to long beach on Sunday for a nice family meal. 3 adults, 1 child. I used to come every Sunday to East Coast with my family in the 90s/2000s when it was good hearty local food at a great price. When the bill arrived I was SHOCKED!!! Chili crab at $150. Baby Kai lan for $20. We might as well have been at a smart restaurant. The worst part was we were offered some peanuts and pickled cucumber at the start which they put on our table (we didn’t really need it or want it) and when the bill came we saw that they had CHARGED us for what we thought was complimentary and pushed on to us. And if you’re thinking of going. Take your own towels with you as they charge you to clean your hands too !!!!! Such a shame as it could become a nice Sunday tradition again but sadly won’t be going back at those prices."
"Great Seafood, great views, nice breeze by the seaside","Tried the restaurant all the way from Robertson Quay to this place at East Coast park. I must say, although it’s the same restaurant, we enjoyed it with a different dining experience. This place is almost magical, we got to enjoy Live Seafood so close to the bank of the sea.
The food is delicious, we tried the Black Pepper Crab at Robertson Quay, so this time we ordered their Famous Chili Crab, it is packed with spice. The way I like it ️. Overall a very nice place, with very helpful staff that welcomes us, we were very happy dining here. Must try ✌"
Fresh Seafood Great Ambience By the Sea,"Back in Singapore for a second trip since August 2022. After a great experience at their Dempsey outlet, decided to bring my family to this branch by the seaside and gosh the sunset scenery was so beautiful. The great taste of their fresh seafood fully complement and elevate the dining experience to another level. Went on a busy weekend and it seems that they were having some manpower crunch issues but we were not in a rush so is fine with the wait. Recommendations of dishes were given and appreciated their professional advice and offer to just order half a Alaskan King Crab given the variety of dishes we had wanted to order for just a group of 5. In the end the food ordered was just sufficient for us. Have shortlisted them as a must visit restaurant for future trips to this garden city."
Stay away from this so called seafood restaurant,"It’s ok if I am served late but two tables who arrived later was served the same food item that I ordered”their famous black pepper crabs”. 3 reminders to 3 different wait staff, didn’t elicit a response from them or kitchen. A a reminder to a captain involve her requesting another pepper crab order which meant my order was forgotten or given to another table. I cancelled my crabs and another senior captain’s suddenly appeared in 30seconds with a crab day dish which I suspect was meant for another table. Seafood fried rice was just a dish of rice carrots and chopped prawns which was full of salt and not palatable.
I still cancelled my crabs and left. If the restaurant cannot appreciate my patronage in all their restaurants by giving me substandard food and poor service… please leave the industry before customers leave you stranded with no business"
Good food - Poor service.,"Good food
I am disappointed with the service
Had to ask 3 times to get a response
When calling a staff they respond ok and keep going.
I felt ignored the whole time
When I arrived I asked one of the captain about the crab and I was told to get the black pepper
When the moment to order came the captain said no more crab
Then he said only one at 180 sgd. seemed pushing for sales. And
It seemed take it or leave it
This was not the Longbeach I knew
I had to beg to be served yesterday
How unprofessional and it doesn’t reflect your reputation
I will think twice next time before coming back"
Happy visit,Online reservation was made easy. Glad to have a table at the upper level which is air-conditioned. Enjoyed the black pepper crab. Overall experience was good except that 2 orders were left out and have to request again.
Mixed,"The wasabi prawns were delicious. We also enjoyed the rice with silver fish and the Qing long Cai. However, the pepper crab was outrageously priced- almost $150- very difficult and messy to eat and really not that tasty. Had we known, I would have skipped it and ordered more prawns. Also, if you aren’t going to eat the peanuts or pickled vegetables that are brought when you are seated tell them server to take them away because they are an extra charge."
Horrible Service Long Beach UDMC,"Booked in advance 2 OUTSIDE tables (each of 5 pax) as they said during booking 10 pax table is NOT available. When we went in we found 10 seater table NOT occupied and booked and the staff incharge informed us they can give those tables as its not booked. So we took the table and ordered the items. Half way later it started raining. NONE of the Staff bothered to move us to inside. When we approached the manager Mr.Desmond he is very very very rude and said all the inside tables are booked. (we can see more than 5 tables are free) and he said its all reserved waiting for the customers. But these tables are NOT occupied (atleast 3 of them) for more than 40 minutes or so. (they say they will HOLD table for 10mins during reservation). But Mr.Desmond NOT bottered to provide us the table. He said since you wanted outside table we cannot provide now inside table even its raining. We told them enough is enough and we are not there beggers. We pay for what has been served so far to our table. But Mr.Desmond demanded we need to pay for the items we ordered (which is NOT even prepared / served to us). After few mins of discussion, he provided a 5 seater table (for our 10 pax with 10 chairs to sequece in) still there are 3 tables empty available. Mr.Desmond is RUDE and we strongly DO recommed NOT to entertain LONG BEACH. We had very very good customer satisfaction with JUMBO seafood which is next to it. SO if you want to try out good seafood with customer service, do visit JUMBO and NOT TO LONG BEACH UDMC (by the way we are regular visitor to Long Beach IMM where we get excellent service. IMM Long Beach staff provide 100% customer service). Till Mr.Desmond removed from LONG BEACH UDMC we decided NOT to visit them."
Staff so kind and welcoming,"It was suddenly pouring heavily and we decided to seek shelter outside the restaurant during the downtime. The rain got heavier and heavier but the staff did not chase us away, instead offered us to take a seat in their restaurant and even offered a cup of hot tea to us. I am so impressed and grateful for the manager’s (Manager Chee) kindness and hospitality even when we were a non-paying customer. Excellent service that should be nominated for the Service Excellence award. Great job team!"
Great for a birthday treat,"Visited this restaurant last week for a birthday celebration. Not so many diners as usual unfortunately. Restaurant operates open from or undercover downstairs with fan or air conditioning upstairs.

The food was as good as ever and we had the delightful chilli crab. Deer meat with spring onion and garlic, and sweet and sour chicken also graced our table. The razor clams steamed in garlic were to die for.

A great meal and a great birthday party!"
Seafood in Singapore,"This place requires a taxi to Long Beach. Returning to the city is a problem as there are not as many taxis available.

Nevertheless, this is family-style, get your hands dirty seafood for a cheap price. The food is good but the real selling point is the price and the portions. You come here for a festive meal with all your friends and everyone will leave full.

You have to order the chilli crab and steamed fish. The black pepper is great too."
Nice lunch,"Had lunch back during July. Booked a table and the staff over the phone was very polite. When we reached there, we were warmly greeted and welcomed by staff. It was pretty quiet during lunch hour, I think only 4-5 tables.

Our family enjoyed our lunch and services. Staff were very attentive, friendly and warm. Especially one staff, Ms Margaret.

We loved the chilli Crab and shark fin soup, very rich and tasty. Highly recommended these two dishes."
"Great seafood, great views of the ocean!","Nice to see this restaurant open again. Great views of the sea and great food. Operates air conditioning upstairs and fan in the indoor section below - outdoors also available.

This restaurant is famous for chilli or black pepper crab. Settled for Chilli crab last night and a selection of side dishes. Razor clams in garlic are especially nice and one of my favourites here. We had a good dinner here here albeit it is quite expensive. Best to make a reservation in advance as there less tables presently with social distancing.

No dry ice for the mango pudding dessert which was a little disappointing.

Spectacular views of sunset and ships at sea!"
"Flown 12 hours, Landed 12 hours, Dinner at Long Beach.","We had landed in Singapore at 7:30am, having flown from London. Checked into Raffles, then explored the city, before thinking it was time to eat. Our Singaporean friends had taken us to Long Beach UDMC, East Coast Seafood Centre, the last time we were in town a couple of years ago. Unfortunately they were unable to meet us this time, but we just about remembered where it was, so hailed a taxi. Due to the Corvid-19 virus there were few diners out and about, so luckily we got a table quite easily without having to book. The chilli crab with sweet buns was as good as we remembered, razor clams with minced garlic, salt and pepper prawns and some rice, all washed down with a bottle of chilled white wine and a jug of Tiger made us forget that we had been ""on the go"" for over 24 hours. Also I did not really need the bib around my neck (to save my shirt from chilli sauce splashes) as had been the case last time we were here. The meal was rounded off with the ""steaming"" mango pudding. A good evening with great service. Here's to the next time."
excellent crab and great service!,"we ate here last night and, as usual, had the chilli crab and the black pepper crab accompanied by the prawn noodles. as ever, the food was great. they had an offer on the Canadian crab, so we chose this for the black pepper dish. we finished the black pepper, but had to bring back the rest of the chilli crab and noodles. 2kg 0of crab plus prawn noodles for around $200"
Great meal and service,"Nice spot to go. Service was exceptional, fast and welcoming. Their famos pepper crab was very good, personally I just hate the .ess and effort but that's me. Great prawns and a delicious fried rice. A little expensive is only why not 5 star."
Delicious crab & seafood,My family and I really enjoyed our meal in the Long beach restaurant. They served delicious but quite overpriced crab however it was still a great experience. Great location which was quite relaxing.
The Crab specialists,"Long beach restaurant is a sea food restaurant located in Singapore's East coast area, where there is a big area full of restaurants and walking paths, as well as parks on your way from the city to Changi airport.

When you go to the place, you need to go for the chilli and black pepper crabs, there are out of this world, perfectly cooked and and with good size that can be good for 2 persons, plus the appetizers.

the restaurant is not fancy, nor low class place, you can name it a mid range ambient, yet the prices not cheap there.

we were a group of more than 10 people, and were all served and seated perfectly, we had different dishes, such as fried sea food, shrimps, but the star is the crab.

you can view their collection of provided crabs, shrimps, fish, etc.. and choose from them what to be cooked for you.

if you are into sea food, then this is a good place, don't expect to get chicken or beef there."
Delicious Crab and other seafood!,Black pepper sauce is a must! Canadian Crab of about 1.3kg was fantastic and meaty. Razor clams in Cantonese style and deep fried shrimps were very well done. Poor selection of wines and high priced.
Overpriced ....nothing special.,"One imported Canadian crab, one tofu dish ,oneveg. , and chinese tea for four people set us back almost SG 300 DOLLARS! A rip off for seafood lunch ,consisting of one crab submerged in thick gooey gravy served with some baked buns. Presentation is so lacking that this doesn't help whet up one's appetite. Condiments like peanuts and pickles already on table were added to the bill. And sadly it's not a good seafood experience and avoid coming here if you can find more local or town based restaurants. The name doesn't warrant disappointment ..but sadly it did!"
As always Best Black Pepper Crab 🦀 in Singapore,Back after few years and all remains at same quality and excellent food taste. Black Peper Crabs at 88 sgd quilo are amazing as well as Cereal Prawns and seafood fried rice .. 3 persons spending 220 sgd with drinks..
Love the service and hospitality,"Love the service and hospitality, they are so friendly and provide the necessary options and advice when ordering. The food is good overall"
Legendary crab,"This is a long time overdue, but must admit I prefer the black pepper to the over-rated and much too saucy chili crab.
Excellent location and what a taste sensation that crab has. Overall we were well treated and almost hand fed-I guess it wasn't too busy. Balmy night, sea breeze - perfect meal really.
I way overdue thanks to our hostess with the mostest - Ms Li Zheng Sheng, treated us like royalty and has a load of laughs. If fact all the staff were great."
Great fresh seafood,"Walked all the way from Clarke Quay to this place as I heard that it was a nice walk and that the food was good. Was not dissapointed! Ordered 2 small sized dishes, but were still pretty big for an small dish (which is a positive). Service was very friendly, fast and wanted to help you with your ordering. I ordered some local favourites. Food tasted fresh and was delicious. Scenery was also not bad. A must go if you want some fresh seafood."
Excellent staff service & local seafood,"The staff is so helpful with very good recommendations for food. They are so happy to help customers as well. The seafood is great, very local. Make reservation to have a good table view to the sea...Thanks sever team!"
Delicious food,"It was authentic, scrumptious simply a delight. The portions were generous. Really enjoyed the food."
Early supper,An early supper. Good service. Pleasant service. Great help with the menu. But SG$120 for two with no wine a bit in the pricey side. Beef with dry chilli was outstanding
Great service,"I came here on 2 consecutive days because of the service, food & ambience.
I was crazy with their prawn hor fun that I went back on 2nd day to have a second round. During these 2 days, I’ve also ordered their black pepper crab, fried sweet mini squid, salt cuttlefish. The service was fantastic from all their service staff at all level & this was 1 of the main reason why I went back. Highly recommended! I was lucky that it was windy these 2 days so it’s very pleasant to dine in the open at night."
Go at your own risk!,"Really bad experience on a Saturday night. None of our polite follow-ups worked to get our food served. After 50 minutes of waiting, I had to resort to making a little scene with the manager before finally getting our food. And all that waiting to eat a very average chili crab and mantao? Never again. I would recommend Jumbo which is right beside Long Beach for better service and better food if you really want to eat seafood at East Coast Park. If location isnt a big factor, go for more local chili crab restaurants around the island. There's a bunch of options in Tiong Bahru which is also a cool area to explore for tourists. I like Sin Hoi Sai which locals and tourists frequent. Good service, I never had to wait for a ridiculously long time, and the food is superb."
Hawker seafood delight!,"I know there are other Long Beach locations, but this one is my favourite. It's right on the beach and always bustling with people and a lot of foot traffic.
Check out the stalls with the longest lines, they're probably the ones worth the wait, and come up with a plan with your friends to nab a free table and strategically line up at different stalls.
Chilli crab is a must, as well as salted egg prawns, seafood char kway teow, and carrot cake (I like black!), don't be afraid to ask people in line what they're ordering, or look at the stalls with the awards. They usually have a specialty and they'll excel at it!

Be prepared to get hot and sweaty as there is so much cooking going on around you, as well as so many people crammed into the space.
Hot Tip: Bring wet wipes or a reusable cold towel in a container, to wipe your brow during eating, and hands after your meal!"
Extremely expensive,"Crab is $98/kg. Their service is good. The crab we have is huge, they cut the crab into half and cook different ways"
Crabs,"We had salt & pepper crab here. The best, next door is Jumbo where their chili crab was better. Great appetizers also. Bring your own disposal wash towels as they charge you for theirs. Outstanding."
"The temple of crab, right on the beach","A trip to Singapore just isn’t complete without ruining every white shirt whilst dipping fingers into a plate of chilli crap. Love the spicy and eggy crustacean considering its flavour my number one go-to. We pulled up a seat the beachfront and methodically wrestled with crab claw after crab claw. Considering that its located amid the stretch of eateries specialising in this delicious treat, i nominate this one as best. Great not to hear English spoken. the femme went out on a limb and had the black pepper crab, not complaining once about the hot mess. She would not do a swap with my chilli crab for quids."
Delicious food Good Service,"I specially go there although it's a bit far away from my hotel. But I definitely will visit again when I travel Singapore. I go with my girlfriend, we order a menu for two including shrimp, black pepper crab, fried rice and dessert and additional order a garlic vegetable. The portion is good and all of them are delicious and the seafood is fresh and all of the staffs are very friendly, worth to come. Comparably, everything is better than another brand."
Desination restaurant with a view - pricey but a memory,"Colleagues highly recommended the black pepper crab at Long Beach UDMC. I went with a colleague and ordered the dinner for two, though we swapped the fried rice for sautéed spinach and white rice. The total, including 4 beers was 191.62. I was surprised when I received the check and there was a charge for the peanuts on the table as well as the wet towelettes to clean our hands (.30 each but still)! The razor crab appetizer was delicious. Eating the black pepper crab was a hot mess -- literally (in a good way!). Check out the before and after pix. Something you have to do at least once and the view of the South China Sea was awesome."
Great Chilli Crab,Good location to eat some seafood as it right on the beach. We ordered the Chilli crab and it was fantastic. Service was good and had lot of tables with locals which is always a good sign for me.
Overpriced Mediocre Pepper Crab,"I ordered their famous pepper crab and some stir fried vegetables. The crab was quite bland. My meal cost over 100 USD. It was worth at most 25 USD to me, mostly for the ambience. For reference, I loved Jumbo Seafood's chili crab."
Seafood at the beach,"Amazing seafood restaurant. They have Seats outside, with a sea breeze it is doable. They have aircon in the toilet though. We ordered some crab, shrimp and fried fish, all were excellent prepared. The hofan with shrimp was best ever, you van taste the wok hei."
Excellent black pepper crab,"As we are not satisfied with the crab in Jumbo, we decided to visit Long Beach again. We had been here some years ago and are pleased to find that the black pepper crab is still surprisingly good. We ordered three 1kg crab, all are very fresh and meat are succulent. Even kids can enjoy not so spicy black pepper crab. The waitress is wonderful who gave us hearty advice to adjust portion of food without forcing us to order expensive and excessive seafood. We find this dinner much cheaper but far more fulfilling than the former one."
Best sea food,"Nice, spacious, by the sea. Very courteous staff, deshelled the crab, deboned the fish and served portions of rice and noodles in individual bowls"
Superb Seafood place with good view,Great sea food place. Excellent pepper crab and Sea Bass. Loved it. Nice clean place. Make reservations or you will wait. Very busy. Great service.
"As always, great black pepper crab!","The restaurant is located in the East coast park amongst other seafood places.

Had the black pepper crab which was as always, amazing! Had me licking my fingers an wanting more.

The place is always busy. Not the place if you want to have a fine dining experience. THE place if you want to enjoy crab."
Sub standard seafood,Disappointing with the food quality especially the pepper crab . The crab is overcooked where the meat is dry and the pepper sauce is not the one I used TK eat at the Dempsey branch. The fried baby squid not even close to typical crispy and sweet.. this one here is so chewy! The fried squid tasted as chewy and tasteless. The fried salted egg prawn is so hard ...! The crispy duck is so tasteless and the chili crab as bad. The vegetables probably the best so far. Service is still good that’s why I have only one star! Go visit the Dempsey branch which still the best ... that’s why I can’t be bother to post any picture!
CNY dinner,"Excellent ambience as we got the table closest to the waterfront. All staff efficient, knowledgeable, polite n helpful. I like to esp compliment 2 x Filipino staff (Male). He is v v polite n gave us 5 stars service! V impressed with him. Excellent food esp you tiao, Yu Sheng dish was good too."
Only okay considering its rating,"Considering in general the reviews for this place are very good, we were disappointed with the balance of price (like most things in Singapore it's expensive) and the service and also the food. The famous black pepper mud crab was nice but not mind blowing same went for the prawns and the cuttlefish. Not a fail we just thought it would blow us away in flavor and it didn't"
Excellent pepper crab meal,"After our disappointment with our regular pirates sea food before CNY weekend , we tried long beach sea food UDMC at east coast . It’s a very popular place and we were lucky to get a table on a busy night . The price of Sri Lanka crab is $ 98 per kg and manager Desmond Ten proudly showed us the example of what we will get . He also showed us the Alaskan crab which was much much bigger as double the price . We settled for the known crab and ordered the Kai Lan in garlic as well as spicy prawns with mantou bun.

The endless wait for our crab dinner could have been managed better since it came much later than the Kai Lan and prawns .
As expected the crab was correctly cooked and fleshy 1 kg before cooking of course- the distinct flavour came thru in every morsel . Kai Lan was Prawns were good but sauce could have been better made . Still worth a visit as the ambience is great by the sea ."
Excellent Crab but Pricey/Poor Service,"Four for dinner sitting outside, two of us ordered the 2lb crab, we chose the salted egg, butter crab dish and it was amazing. Rich and creamy with garlic, the best crab dish we ever had. Pricey at $140 but a splurge and was worth the experience. Service not so great, server acted like she was doing us a favor to wait on us. The view was outstanding."
As always great food,But portions smaller and smaller and price going up!! 300 sgd for a couple.. Some original record changed.. but black pepper crab keep being excellent..
diner with colleagues,"My colleagues told me they take me to a good place to eat the chilli crab.
It was the week before Chinese New Year and very busy at the restaurant, but still a smooth and friendly service. We had the famous black pepper crab, the chilli crab, century egg, noodles, toffu and some more dishes, my colleagues ordered don't know what we all had :-)
The food was very good, I really enjoyed my diner at Long Beach."
Way overpriced,Very expensive as the food quality is not up to standard. Veg cost $18 but the veg is old an tough. Fish $86 almost tasteless like was dead for very long time. $15 each of razor clam come with sands and stone. The good things here is the service stuff is very attentive and ready to serve.
Best chili crabs in Singapore,We went to the restaurant to eat chili crabs. We were given a table outside by the sea which was lovely. Apart from the crab which was exceptional we ordered a few vegetables and rice which were delicious. The service was exceptional and we were well looked after by our waitress. Highly recommended restaurant to visit.
"Crabs, Seafood","Yum yum Seafood Speciality 🦀 A must try for seafood galore. Tasty Mouth-watering dishes to your taste. For chilli crabs, can ask them to add less chilli if u prefer."
Fresh and decent seafood; great atmosphere,"The East Coast Seafood Centre is incredibly well known for its seafood. We ordered the toted black pepper crab, razor clams, conch, and other items. All delicious. Do come here, but be aware of the steep prices."
Horrible Service,"This was supposed to be one of the highlights of our trip to Singapore. Every other restaurant we went to in Singapore the staff could not do enough for us (even in the Hawker Centres), but Long Beach was the exception, when i tried to ask questions about the menu I was rudely told that i couldn't order this because it was too much and when i tried to ask more question the female waiter shut me down, the staff then put peanuts on the table and then told me there was a cost for the peanut which i didn't ask for. By this time all the expectations I had about the meal were destroyed. If i ask a question i will not be treated rudely and dismissed. Horrible customer service, the staff are exceptionally rude and a disservice to the restaurant, i plan on travelling back to Singapore but would never to go to a Long Beach establishment again. Horrible Experience"
Seafood dinner,"There were 2 of us. We ordered one chili crab and 2nd black pepper crab. We preferred the chili crab as the sauce was very tasty, spicy and sweet and especially great for dipping with buns. The crabs were very fresh. But the black pepper crab is a bit too dry for us. The crab at SID 88 per kg is a bit expensive though( the prices seemed to be going up year up over year).

The razor clam is average. But the cold durian pudding is highly recommended. It was refreshing and anyone afraid of durian pungent smell may still be able to try this.

The service was excellent and attentive even though the wait for the foods to be served were a bit too long. Our table faced the sea and with the sea breeze blowing, it was very relaxing. Total Sid 300 for the meal but it was overall an enjoyable dinner for both of us."
Changed and not for better,"Been going here over many visits over many years and it is not what it was!

Problem is they are going or are more upmarket with a slightly less good but far more expensive product - 1kg crab now very near £50! Food was at best average and there are far better seafood restaurants in Singapore not have to go here.

Whilst the staff were willing, on a not very busy early evening the service was slow.

I must admit to being a little sick when I noticed as leaving some 60 approx live lobsters stacked three or four deep in a tank for no more that 15/20 particularly where there were empty tanks.

I added a star for old time but will not be back....sorry guys I shall miss my chilli crabs!"
Expensive seafood restaurant not convenient for tourists,"The Long Beach Seafood Restaurant franchise has 5 outlets in Singapore. This is the one least accessible to tourists as it is not near any MRT station and even the closest bus stop requires a fair amount of walking. The easiest way would be to take the MRT to the Bedok station and take a taxi from there to the restaurant. The restaurant occupies a building and is spread out over two floors. The ground floor is open air with no air conditioning. The first floor (the floor above) has air conditioning. We visited on a Friday evening around 6:30 pm and was seated in the first floor which was almost empty. We ordered the chili crab and the black pepper crab plus some other dishes. The crabs are pretty fresh and tasty, but spicy hot and really expensive. Service was good. But watch out for the small dishes of peanuts and pickled vegetables and the sealed napkin packets on the table. They are not complimentary. The waiter did ask us if we want them and take them away when we said no. In summary, good food, good service but over priced for a restaurant not even remotely close to being fine dining."
A Singapore Tradition!,"The East Coast Seafood Center and Long Beach Seafood restaurant is out of the city, about half way to the airport. Be sure and make reservations to sit outside outside, as the inside dining area is brightly lit, and much hotter than outside, even tho many fans are running full speed. The outside area is just off a path where locals are walking/running and enjoying the cooler night air. You can hear the ocean from time to time, and see the lights of the freighters waiting to be unloaded in the distance. The outdoor lighting is a bit on the bright side, but the atmosphere overall is very pleasant.

If you do go inside, you can see tanks of live fish, shrimps and the biggest, most amazing Alaskan king crabs you have ever seen! (See picture)

Service is prompt. Tiger Beer can be purchased by the glass or by the pitcher (4 glasses). The pitchers come with a bucket of ice to keep it cold, and a special Tiger Beer waitress who comes around and keeps your glass full. There are several red and white wines available by the bottle, but only a mediocre Spanish Sauvignon Blanc available by the small bottle for $19 Singapore.

We ordered the set menu for 2 for $138 SD: deep fried shrimp, pepper crab and fried rice. There is a second set menu that is the same, except the shrimp is prepared differently. Our waitress asked us if we wanted “shell on” or “shell off,” and we chose shell off, so our shrimp came already shelled, and no head or legs. There was a sprinkle of something crunchy on the top, which added to the flavor. It was very good. (See picture)

Next came the pepper crab (1 crab), a dish the restaurant claims to have invented. (See picture) We were looking at it, wondering how to break it up, when a server came by, put on gloves, and began to crack it and dig out the meat for us! (See picture) What a wonderful service, especially since, after the claws, the rest of the meat has to be dug out of the crab. It was excellent, and not overly spicy, despite being cooked in pepper. The fried rice dish was served after the crab. It was very light, not like fried rice dishes we were used to in the US. Finally, there was a dessert of a sort of jelly, with small bits of fruit, served in a dish over dry ice, so it would stay cold. Very light and nice, had just s few bites to refresh the palate.

When the bill came, we discovered that we had been charged for the small plate of peanuts ($1.50 SD) and 2 towelettes ($.60 SD) that were on the table when we sat down. We thought that was kind of nickel-and-dime to charge for something you didn’t order (peanuts) and obviously needed (towelettes).

There are a couple other Long Beach restaurants in the city, but the UDMC is the original one and where the locals go. If you are looking for more of an upscale dining experience, you might look at one of the others."
"Fresh seafood, great service but a little pricey","We came in a group of 5. The Restaurant was near the seaside, breeze was great, ambiance was lovely. Service was top notch, all the servers were very attentive and helpful. Food was good overall.

We ordered fried tofu (I would rate 7.5/10).

Their fried grouper was decadent (I’d give it a perfect 10), its meat was springy, the chef special stock was delicious.

Their bamboo clams were very refreshing. Servers very nicely assisted in serving each one to everyone’s plate so we wouldn’t spill the juices. The amount of garlic bits was just right, fragrant enough to do the job but not too much to put you off. This dish is always one which I wish I could eat more off but we always stick to one to each diner. (9/10)

Crabs were expensive. $98/kg. We had one that was 1.5kg so you can do the math yourself how much that dish alone cost us. We had it cooked with black pepper. Whilst the crab doneness was executed perfectly, I felt the dish could do with a little more sauce (I know it’s a dry dish unlike chilli crab) but I’d still prefer a little extra sauce. The black pepper wasn’t pepper enough and I felt the overall flavor was toned down (probably toned down not to cater to tourist taste buds). This was the only dish I felt they could tweak to a more local flavor, ie more peppery, saltier, sweeter.

Overall, I would say this is a pretty close to perfect place for entertaining your client. Great ambiance and view, with an option for alfresco or air conditioned dining spaces. When there was the random sandfly, the servers were equipped with a candle to place on our table to ward it off.

Food is overall good. Price is high, so I’d recommend it for a company or client dinner venue (rather than for a family)."
Fabulous chilli crab 🦀👍🏼,"A short 10min walk from the Shangri-la hotel for dinner. The chilli crab was fantastic, the service was swift and attentive, the wine list had several reasonably priced sellections, there was a discrete private dining room that seared around 25, which we only realised was there when the group left, en mass. . Highly recommended."
Not worth,"Pricey, the package deal is worse than any other crab restaurant. Overall bad experience and over price. The crab is small, was about 800g while the staff saying at least 1.2 Kg...what a joke. go to somewhere else."
And it's a yes!,"Now I can't claim that I've been everywhere in Singapore but I will still say that this place have one of the best outdoor seating in the lion city.
Sitting outside watching the large airplanes coming in over the straits while eating a superb dinner is something you cannot miss.

The food is brilliant, really nice tasting and fast. If you order too much they will tell you (listen to the staff, they know what theyre doing!).

Pepper crab is fantastic, also please try the deep fried squid and whitebait for appetisers.

I always try to make it back here, and it's never let me down.

It's a bit of a drive out of the city but we'll worth the 25sgd cab drive!"
Best crab and friendly staff,Birthday dinner yesterday 3 Oct with family. A yummy clay pot mee hoon and chilli crab is a must order disks when we visited. Excellent and fast service that our family love it very much. Good! Good! Good!
"Go for it, especially the Black Pepper Crab!","Super yummy. We ordered black pepper crab, tom yum soup and calamari, and all were extremely delicious and well presented! The service was also impeccable. The waiters were very attentive, friendly and genuinely keen to help. We had our young toddler with us and the attention that they devoted to us was just exceptional. We were a bit surprised by the bill at the end as it turned out to be more costly than we thought considering the somewhat casual look/ambiance of the place. However, having said that, the experience was incredible and worth it. So we'd definitely go back!"
Seafood dinner,"Always a great place to bring friends from abroad to enjoy the chilli crab, pepper crab, razor clams, and others. After dinner stroll cum chit chat would definitely help ease the bulge at the waist area."
The sea and peppered crab,"Great food but on the costly side. The food was excellent and fully justified the additional cost and in addition a great view over the sea. Supposed origin of pepper crab but even the other dishes are great, Fish was very good as was the chilli crab. Ticks all the boxes - food, views and atmosphere. Service was of a high standard."
Best chilli & peppered crab,"Possibly the best chilli crab and peppered crab I've had in Singapore! About a 20 minute drive from the Marina Bay, it has real live seafood in large tanks! We had the Alaskan King Crabs for our dishes. Prawns the size of baby lobster are to die for. A bit pricier than other places., but the quality of the seafood if crazy good! This place is best enjoyed in a large group just because there is so much to pick from and eat. Small wine selection but nice inexpensive wine. Stick to a pitcher of beer, it goes perfect with the crab! As tourists we were treated exceptionally well."
Standard dropped,Used to be very restaurant . Food standards have dropped badly . Fried rice with no taste and rice was not cooked . Too pricey and food presentation was really not interesting ( adding little flower decoration means nothing ) . Service was average
Simply the best.,"LONG BEACH UDMC. Located at #01-04, East Coast Seafood Centre. I have been coming to this place ever since it’s opening, believe me you cannot go wrong with this place for the black pepper crab, chili crab, and other seafood such as razor clams, lobster and off course variety of fish. This place claims to be the original creator of the black pepper crab, and it sure tasted like it! .It’s the best seafood in town and surprisingly good roast chicken, fried rice and a fruit cocktail dessert. Service is superb and so attentive and helpful. Most of the seating is outside overlooking at the South China Sea, it’s nice to go evening nice and cool! Highly recommended for locals and tourist!"
Singapore Famous Pepper Crab,heard about this place from the locals. it was everything and more. the pepper crab was out of this world. various additional items on the menu are just as good. i Highly recommend this restaurant. :) :)
nice experience for a good pepper crab,"Definitely a nice experience, even if you are in transit in Singapore Airport. Located about 20 mins from Changi Airport, you can get a nice dinner there, facing the ocean. Don't expect high standard in service, the restaurant is always packed and service is quite ""industrial"". But you get nice seafood and that what counts here. I've been there several times and will go again, for sure!!"
The best crabs I have ever eaten,Simply wow ! This seafood restaurant on the Singapore beach serves the best crab preparations we ever had. We tried their signature dish black pepper crab which is outstanding. We also had the chilly crab with bread buns and the sauce there was awesome. As good was the whole sea bass preparation. Ending with the mango pudding. Just be there if you are in Singapore. It has the least prominent shopfront and that’s why celebrities visit this place. A memorable experience !
Nice staff and food,The front man was flexible set up a table for us while we had no reservation and the restaurant already full. The lady staff gave us an umbrella. We will come back in the future.
Memorable and good,Had an amazing meal with colleagues. They ordered the food and I eat as much as I could. There was chilli or black pepper crab. Lots of other dishes. Not sure on the prices but was a good experience.
Good food nice ambience,Enjoyed the sea food dishes and the ambience- on the beach. The service was friendly though rates are on the higher side. With taxi to Clark’s Quey is around 18-20 SDG
Black pepper crabs galore,"Probably one of the best place for black pepper crabs, so good that you might even lick the last few drops of the shells. Fresh crabs are used wonderful"
"Considering how much they charged us, it is only ok","They charged us $88 per kg for their crabs, which is cutthroat. No doubt they were tasty, but I dont think they were worth the price. Service is prompt as they clear your plates often and refill your drinks, but price-wise i really wouldnt pay so much for crabs. The other dishes were priced in line with other seafood resturants. Would i recommend this place? Only for very special occasions if you are willing to splurge. Otherwise, better stay away and save your money."
Amazing Pepper crab,One of the must tries when you are in Singapore if you love sea food. Pepper crab was simply amazing so was their mango fish and baby squid. Service as usual was excellent.
worth for money,great taste especially the black pepper crab. A very nice environment with seaside view friendly staff and presentation of the foods indeed are good
Seafoods,"Love this place of Seafood meal. Friendly fast service all round, lot of choices on the menu. Delicious. Always a visit to long beach when I am home."
A Taxi driver’s strong recommendation for dinner,"Well, I was last in Singapore 20 years ago and the memory etched in my brain was of Black Pepper Crab. So when a local strongly recommends a location, you go.

We had just 3 items, Black Pepper crab, Sambal beans and steamed rice. The last 2 were great, but the crab was over charred and when this happens, the meat dries up and sticks to the shell making it the worst $ 88 food item by far

Crab cooked in a gravy keeps moist, but char-grilled, is definitely not worth it, unless you get your high from licking the black pepper on the outside of the shell.

Waste of a precious dinner opportunity."
Seasonal price for fruits like mango? Like your seafood?,$88 per kg of Sri Lanka crab is the highest I’ve paid in Singapore so far. The quality of the crab is suspect with the meat sticking to the shell. Then they wanted to charge me “seasonal price” like fruits and mangoes?just like their seafood? How about charging me by per 100grams? Haha Are u joking mr management? I believe this is a Singapore first too. Charging seasonal price for mango as a dessert in a seafood restaurant! Outrageous! Never patronising it again ever.
Crabs!,"Food was terrific. Chilli crab and black pepper crab were delicious. Totally worth going. Didn’t care for the fried squid appetiser; tasted like overly deep friend something, but nothing like squid. Everything else was terrific!"
Amazing food,When in singopore this restaurant is a must the Alaskan king crab is a must bit pricey but good. The black pepper crab just amazing coming a just over 2 kelo of crab meat.great servic3 as well
Sunday night delights!,"Great restaurant with plenty locals and tourists alike. You are greeted and looked after beautifully all evening by friendly and attentive staff menu is fantastic and we enjoyed cuttlefish, shark fin soup, prawns and tasty veggie fried drive. Well worth making the trip for - grab a taxi from city and about $12 taxi trip. Will be back - thank you all! ⛩"
Awesome black pepper crabs and excellent service!,Long Beach at IMM serves awesome black pepper crabs and other seafood dishes. March and April are the best months for Sri Lankan crabs—the meat is firm and it is filled with fats. I like Long Beach not only because of the food. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Experience it yourself.
Wow...yummy seafood,"There a bunch of restaurants on the East Coast Seafood Park. Long beach is pretty famous. When you reach the restaurant it looks like a mini Sentosa SEA acquarium. Ha ha. There are so many crabs, lobsters and all other things floating around. Their most famous dish is their crab preparations. They will bring the live crab to your table and you can chose it. Then after cooking, they will help break the shells and make it very easy for you to eat. The prawns are also amazing. These are a bit hot though on the spicy side. Hence keep on sipping the Coke or the ice water. The service is great. Moment you enter you are greeted from all around and similar greetings when you leave. Definitely make it a point to visit this restaurant without fail. :)"
Excellent Foods and Services,"We came to this restaurant for the 4 times in Feb. The foods were really fresh and delicious, the staff was friendly, the service was quick and the view & weather was nice. Will do it again soon."
Doesn't Diasappoint,"Haven't had a restaurant cooked crabs for a while. The 5 of us friends caught up again for a dinner.
We had the set menu for 4 & added the chili crab. Can't really fault any of the dishes we had. The service was fantastic. The staff were attentive & quick to clear any dirty dishes.

Didn't have to wait long for our dishes to arrive."
Incorrect address,The Address listed is incorrect! Only Long Beach udmc exists. Please correct information as this is misleading.
First time experience,"The foods are very good and my recommendation is black pepper crab. Seafoods also nice to eat. But come to service, not so good and slow. The crowd not so much. Still can come but service ñot good. Foods still can eat."
Best black pepper crabs,Here lies the best black pepper crab ever so good you will be licking off the shells. Good sides is a the sambal kangkong and stuffed dough fritters
Impressive crab!,"We're Europeans and we were brought here by a Singaporean friend who know the place.
They were all locals, and the restaurant was full, we got the last table but it's better to book in advance!
He ordered chilli crab, black pepper crab, some beautiful prawns, some noodles with prawns & some beef with veggies. All the food came quite quickly and all was fantastic, tasty and delicious! Pepper crab is quite spicy, be careful! But it's worth a try.
We don't know how much it was the bill as he didn't let us pay, but I think high quality high bill !"
Outrageous price for crab,"Having lived in Singapore for 3 years some time ago, I should have smelled the rat. They very cleverly avoided giving me a price for a small pepper crab -“ seasonal price ” came to a ripoff $80 for max 500 g crab they claimed was 1 kg (!!!) with very little meat, until after the meal. A light meal for two came to $140 - my most expensive meal in Singapore - EVER - and I left hungry and annoyed while they smiled serenely.

These people are sharks - you have been warned"
full of locals eating well,"Definitely worth trying - very good sea food: e.g. deep fried octopus, drunken prawns, grouper etc. Ask for some chilli oil to bring out the flavours (or drown them if over-enthusiastic). Seating outside is very pleasant in the evenings at this time of year (January). Did not find the service pushy (cf another reviewer): just friendly and efficient. And not too efficient."
Always delicious Crab!!,"Amazing food and service. Black pepper Crab just delicious but not only, Cereal Prawns, sea food fried rice are so good! Best location in Singapore.. This is a must.."
Must try in Singapore!,"Historical restaurant in Singapore, the one attributed to the invention of Black Pepper Crab. Location is relatively far away from downtown but the place is definitely worth a visit. Tried both the black pepper and chilly crab together with a few sides. Everything was excellent and in great quantity. Location is comfy and often pretty crowded. Prices are relatively high.
Definitely worth a visit."
"Long Beach - Great Food, Great Atmosphere, A Must Go To Restaurant","Over the last 15 years I've been to Singapore 4 times. Each time I've been fortunate to go to Long Beach. The food is wonderful (Black Pepper Crab, Chilli Crab, Razor Clams, all sorts of lovely fish) and the staff are fantastic. For me, any trip to Singapore is not complete without a visit to Long Beach). Anyone who goes to Singapore should go!"
Decent seafood and sea views but pushy service,I usually go to Long Beach for seafood with overseas visitor because we can enjoy decent quality food with views. The new twist to the most recent visit is the attempt by the restaurant to upsell its crab dishes. The waitress claimed that local Sri Lankan crabs are small and recommended Alaskan crabs. She also tried to push Australian lobsters. A very annoying practice as most of the customers are here to enjoy “local” seafood.
Fantastic Speciality Seafood Restaurant - But Expensive,"Our family came here almost 16 years ago when my son was three years old. Fast forward to November 2017 and we are back here again. My son is 18 years old and nothing has changed. The Restaurant claims that it indeed invented Black Pepper Crabs and boy is it tasty. Memories came flooding back and we ate like no tomorrow. Basically we ordered Singapore Chilli Crab, Black Pepper Crab, Fried Anchovies fried rice, Sambal Sotong and Kang Kong. The crabs we ate are sourced from Negombo, Sri Lanka. Being of Sri Lankan birth I am well aware that the majority of the large mud crabs are exported to Singapore on a massive scale leaving very little to the local population. Singapore pay big bucks for them and this is reflected in the price per kilo we had to pay. We got charged 80 dollars a kilo. That is expensive and is probably indicative of current seafood prices worldwide. Eating seafood is an expensive affair and Long Beach Seafood Restaurant has reflected this in their pricing. Food wise can not fault one dish. Meaty Crabs are a messy eating affair and the Restaurant caters for this providing tea scented finger bowls. All up I love this Restaurant. I just wish it was a little cheaper but having said that it was almost 15 years ago when we were last here. We give it a thumbs up."
