A wonderful dine to remember!,"It was a wonderful day to receive a warm welcome from restaurant staff Mary and Jack. The restaurant was clean and spacious. It’s nice having my food because it was so relaxing. Staff are friendly especially Mary who did an extra mile service I really appreciate the omelette she made for me it was tasty with a lot of cheese as per my request it’s perfect, even she help me how to make noodles. I enjoyed the food a lot. Also Thank you Mary for the map you made for my short tour around famous tourist spots here in Singapore it’s very useful. The restaurant and this Hotel is highly recommended. Surely I’ll stay again. Keep it up guys! Job well done!"
Lunch buffet,"Dish selection very limited and small amount although its top up when finished.
Steam chicken is dry. Chicken rice is placed on a bamboo steamer but not heated so its cold. Laksa soup lukewarm. Hardly any dishes is nice.
Dessert variety limited and unappetizing.
Lunch price $40++
Definitely not worth if paying full price.
Even though we got a 1 for 1 deal its in our opinion not value for money.
Will never go again."
Katong kitchen is the best,"Been here many times. Food is great, ambience is nice, excellent service especially from Kenneth who make us feel welcome every time we come & we feel so at home. Thank you , Kenneth"
Best durian pengat,"Great selection of food, reasonably priced. We keep coming back as it is one of our favourite buffet places. Love the durian pengat especially!"
Good food n nice ambience,"We are a group of 7 friends having buffet lunch here. Food was very good, service was excellent but price was a bit steep."
Delicious peranakan food and kuehs,"Their katong laksa is delicious, their ayam buah keluah hits all the right spot with the rich taste and the generous servings of buah keluah. Their durian pengat and durian salat are to die for. The restaurant is cosy and all the staff are friendly and attentive. in particular, Anthony was very welcoming and delivered impeccable service."
Great Buffet & Friendly Staff,First day in Singapore and Joon at Katong Kitchen made us very welcome and introduced us to many local dishes which was part of an amazing Sunday buffet. Will definitely be eating here again.
ROM night,"Arranged a group of 24 paxs for our ROM dinner. Great experience, restaurant helped us set up a beautiful table for our solmization session. We love it! The whole dinner experience was great too. Great food, great service. Highly recommended."
Good for small gathering,Peranakan style.. Nice embiance... Some DIY stations... Foods taste average.. Their Sambal stingray is yummy
Food Service Excellent!!!,"We are happy to meet Mary at Katong Kitchen and commended for her excellent service and assistance during our week stayed at Village Hotel Katong. The food was tasty and we had good appetite every time we hit on the table. She also offer local cuisne for us to ty, she knows very well how to handle customer service and care... a five star rating for you Mary and hope to see you again in our future travel..."
Birthday celebration,"Was there on 11 Feb noon with my wife to celebrate her birthday. Had a great time there. Wonderful selection of food. We love the durian puree. Very attentive staff with excellent service, especially Amy. Was nice of restaurant to present a surprise - a slice of BD cake."
The best !!!!!,The food was amazing. I would like to commend Mary for assisting us specially for helping with the surprise for my brother. Ambiance is perfect.
Enjoying occasion,"Through out the buffet your staff efficiently and courteous to help my family.
Thank you to all staff concerned"
Birthday celebration,"Came to celebrate my mom's birthday with family. There was an array of salad bar,hot foods, mains, fresh seafood and a noodle station. Food was delicious. Taste great. Dessert station has a good array of cakes,puddings and cendol station. We requested for a birthday cake however as my mom was allergic to the flavour, they were kind enough to get another flavoured cake for her. Kudos to the team,Amy, Jack and Anthony for the cake presentation. Also thanks to the crew for promptly clearing the plates from the tables. Great service, great food and variety. Suits the price too. Shout out to the Durian pengat, creme brule and laksa! Thanks for a memorable evening."
Enjoyable lunch,"Well, took some time to find it as the restaurant is hidden inside the Marine Parade Village Hotel on the 4th. Floor. Lucky we did. There was a buffet but we decided to go for a-la-card. The food was very good and so was the service. When paying time came the staff recommended to use MasterCard which came with a 15% discount. We will definitely go there again when in the area."
Tasty dishes and desserts,"Our friend who's been here 5 times over a few years recommended Katong Kitchen for lunch and got a reservation for 6 of us senior ladies who enjoyed the 50 per cent discount so paid only $24 each for a very wide spread of Peranakan dishes with Western salads and desserts. The stingray fish curry was good and so was the beef rendang, very tender and not over-seasoned. I heard from the others that the buah keluak was too salty so gave that a miss. The turmeric rice was so-so but the laksa was really good, served in small bowls with egg and taupok, shrimp too. Seafood which included steamed prawns and clams were fresh while the fresh salad greens came with a choice of dressings. There was also nasi lemak and fried kwayteow with wok hei.
Desserts were wonderful, the star being the chocolate slices which go well with a choice of ice-cream. Durian pengat came in little glasses, fresh fruit were delightfully varied, grapes, honeydew etc and coffee from the machine strong and aromatic.
Service was courteous and friendly, the environment clean and welcoming. Would love to come again, bringing new friends, especially from abroad here to try the local specialties."
Very enjoyable lunch at Katong Kitchen,"I was invited to a luncheon by a friend for a Christmas gathering. It was a eye opening experience for my fellow diners and myself.

We were greeted by this friendly, cheerful staff, Kenneth who has helped some of us climbing the few steps leading to the restaurant. We were lead to our seats near the hot dishes.

Every now and then, Kenneth will come by our tables to ensure we are being taken care of like offering getting us drinks or asking if we try the infamous Katong laksa or the durian penyat. We feel so welcome and well taken care.

The food spread was good but the service given by Kenneth and other staff is very commendable.

Another good point is the senior discount of 50% given which will definitely make us come back although it is not the main reason as we will come back because of Kenneth and the food spread.

When we were leaving, once again Kenneth helped us again down the steps. He even said see you tomorrow!! We wish we can but our tummy need a rest.

Thank you, Kenneth and Katong Kitchen. See you very soon in 2020"
Our New Year's Eve dinner,"We had our reservation at the last minute on New Year's eve. Ahmed and Mary Jane helped in the reservation of our table. When we arrived in the restaurant, we were immediately ushered to our seats.

The pleasing arrangement of the dishes were enticing. We indulged ourselves in the perfect row of seafood. There's a wide variety of choices of mouth-watering Singaporean food. Desserts were also amazing! I loved their durian dessert and coconut ice cream sprinkled with white chocolates chips and cranberries.

Ahmed who was in the live kitchen did a great job in making us laksa. He also encouraged us to try more dishes.

Mary Jane gave us a very warm welcome and accommodated us with our needs.

We had a great experience and my friends and I are definitely going back to dine again."
Awesome Dininn Experience,"We had such a great New Year's Eve dinner experience at Katong Kitchen! The staff Mary Jane & Ahmed were wonderful! They attended to our every need and provided a 5 Star service to us! The food was very good as well with a wide variety of choices! Authentic Seafood! Overall, cosy place, wonderful staff and delicious food! Amazing experience and I would highly recommend this place to my friends, family and anyone out there who is looking to have a memorable dining experience!"
An Opulent Dinner,It was a nice experience having an opulent dinner with friends. Foods are highly recommended specially the portion of their seafoods. Place is clean and recommendable too. Service are good. Well accomodated by Mary and Ahmed. Definitely will come back with some other friends.
Birthday lunch,"This is the forth time for my uncle and aunt to holding their birthday celebration at katong kitchen.

There are many kinds of food that served for us and our guest such as fresh seafood ( crabs, prawns, scallops etc ), a variety of dimsum, laksa, fried wanton noodles, durian pengat ( MUST TRY ) even nyonya peranakan dishes are also there and many more.

Their service is excellent, especially Mr.ZOEY, with such helpful and friendly manner, so professional.

Thank you for always helping us everytime we hold an event there. We really enjoyed to be there, so as our guests.

Definitely will be returning there again.."
Terrible Overall Experience,"Went with my wife and two children that was intended for a simple Christmas lunch buffet yesterday but ended up with a terrible customer experience.

There is supposed to be a 1-for-1 lunch/dinner buffet promotion with HSBC cards and Entertainer app. We had both, and we called the restaurant a few days before to make a reservation. We confirmed with the waiter at the call if we would be entitled to a 1-for-1 buffet if we had the HSBC card and Entertainer app and he replied yes. On the actual day when we arrived at the restaurant, we again asked the waiter if we need to show our Entertainer app before going in but he said no need and ushered us to our seats.

When it came to paying the bills, we got a huge shock when the app showed we were only entitled to a 1-for-1 dinner instead of lunch buffet. The restaurant claimed they could only process what they saw from our app and proceeded to charge us the full sum. Throughout the entire customer journey from the online channel to our dining, there was no mention that HSBC card owners have preferential treatment over whether they can receive a lunch or dinner buffet. It did not help that it was the first time we downloaded the app and the restaurant did not even advise at any time to check our app to see which buffet type we can get. It is ludicrous that we should only be getting one but not the other. Clearly, the restaurant could have informed customers of this ""hidden fine print"" in the T&C from its online marketing channel or when we made our reservation and before we started our buffet, but it did not, and we felt really cheated by the whole episode. It just ruined our Christmas.

The food was also quite bad. The stingray tasted like it had been bleached in chlorine or sea water (my wife and I can attest to it), which came through so heavily through my nose that I almost felt I was swimming and breathing in some water.

The green curry mutton was very salty and the meat was just plain dry. Same goes for the ayam buah keluak."
Delicious,Love the food and ambience. Very calm when eating as the place was just nice and not crowded. Thank you for the birthday cake!
review,"A lots of variety of spicy n non spicy food, great service, great place. Mum & I enjoy it very much at 19.12.19 lunch."
Birthday Celebration,"Recently my family & I held a mini birthday celebration at Katong Kitchen. The service was great. The staff are helpful & friendly. My group was served by Mary, she was very attentive, friendly and helpful.

As for Food I would consider it to be average. A good variety of Peranakan dishes but many of the items were a little too salty to our liking and a few of the dishes' gravy are a little diluted."
"Excellent food, excellent service","As what the title say, what more can I ask. I hope the standard maintain cause I definitely be coming back again."
Dr,"What an absolutely amazingly wonderful experience to dine at Katong Kitchen. We were celebrating our anniversary and the staff went out of their way to make our anniversary celebration an absolutely wonderful celebration to remember.The seafood buffet that they serve is the best we have ever experienced. Truly WONDERFUL FOOD. Thank you so very much to the staff, especially MARY AND AMY for making our anniversary a truly romantic memorable one. From our hearts, thank you very much"
A little gem in katong,It was a good place for quality food and service was prompt. The dishes were yummy and seafood was fresh. It is really value for money for the buffet with varieties of choices. The durian penget was very food. Would strongly recommend this place.
Great!BUT...,"Been there 5-6 times now,I just wish there are more selection on the seafood corner and where did the sushi/sashimi go?A little disappointed because i was looking forward to eat that but apart from that food were amazing!A big shoutout to the cempedak creme brulee(MUST TRY)!that should stay forever together with the durian pengat!Staffs were superb and efficient,overall a great experience!"
An enjoyable and nice dinner!,"It was a weekday evening and we came by here for dinner. The halal restaurant was surprisingly crowded and it was full house and so we were seated by the ""corridor"" besides the main dinning area of the restaurant, a little dim but still ok.

The ambience was nice though and service staff were friendly, polite and helpful, they were also very efficient in clearing used plates. Kudos to the team!

The spread of the food was good too, comprising of several nonya peranakan dishes as the restaurant is well-known of, together with a handful of Malay and Chinese cooked food. The food were generally nice and yummy, in particular the seafood, which we loved the snow crab legs and prawns. They were very fresh, sweet and yummy!

As for the main cooked food, on the evening of our visit, there were curry chicken, ee-fu noodles, black pepper squids, stew beef, peper crayfish, mongolian stir-fried prawns, teriyaki chicken, dim sum items, salmon fish, rojak, kueh pietie, shepherd's pie and some others. There was also a live cooking station where diners could ask for the famous katong laksa, ngoh hiong noodle soup and stirloin beef cut. The food were nice. There was also old cucumber soup.

They also have quite a good spread of pastries and desserts, cakes and kuehs were nice. In particular the durian pengat and egg tarts were very nice, besides the salad, cut fruits.

They also provided home made iced Lime juice and Bandung syrup, besides coffee and tea, as many restaurants only have iced water in the buffet. And the cold beverages were very nice, icy and refreshing!

Generally, as mentioned the food were nice and yummy and quite a good spread and so no complaint. If I have to really suggest some areas for improvement, then that would be to have another soup. Although there was the old cucumber soup (for Chinese/Asian), there should have a Westernised soup like mushroom soup etc to cater to those diners who do not drink Asian soup. There was also no bread too, good to have some to be perfect. Although food were replenished quite regularly, there was any lemon left at around 9pm! (for dessert and condiments)

It's good value for money over the spread and quality of food provide and besides the on-going credit card promotions, senior citizens above 60 enjoys a 50% discount (both terms and conditions apply).

Overall we enjoyed our meal here and will revisit again soon!"
Nice Peranakan Experience,Nice overall peranakan experience with the ambience & food. Fresh & tasty dishes as well as deserts. Its also value for money under the 1 for 1 lunch promotion. Great!
Birthday Celebration,"We had a private room for a birthday celebration of a family member. The buffet staff was efficient and fast in helping to coordinate with the surprise celebration and clearing off the cutleries.

The buffet from Katong Kitchen were superb, especially the live station Laksa and Prawn Noodle. Food was good, no complaints there."
Could be better,The cut fresh fruit selection was not replenished after most of the items were taken. The cold dish selection could be better. Senior citizens paid half the going rate so for them the food was value for money. Will visit again as a senior citizen.
Good spread of local cuisine,"For those who love paranakan cuisine, this is the perfect place to go especially for big group. My friends and I love their laksa."
superb service,"The staff was very kind and welcoming and seemed to genuinely care. “To be doing good deeds is man’s most glorious task”. This had been the greatest experience that we had in our stay in the hotel. We were able to know someone who is really approachable, kindhearted, passionate, and hardworking staff. She is in the person of Mary. The first time we met her, we really salute her for being dedicated and helpful. As a matter of fact, when we had our first dining experience, she welcomed us with her sweet smile. She greeted us pleasantly. We really felt delighted the first time we saw her. The moment we sat down she then said to us to enjoy the foods. She informed us regarding the kind of foods they serve. She mentioned that if we need something we should not be hesitant to approach her. This statement she lamented truly drew affection and easiness with her. It is undeniably that there are very few staff that would treat us like that. In the midst of our meal my fork fell down. Immediately she picked it up and told me to do not worry and she got another fork for me. It was truly commendable move seeing someone like her doing such simple thing but brought a great impact to a customer.
We will come back again in Village Hotel Katong not only because of its terrific rooms and appetizing foods but with the staff like Mary, a person with superb service, admirable attitude, wonderful smile, and caring heart."
tripadvisor jane,Excellent eating experience from walking in the door and being greeted by amazing staff headed by ms. jane..i truly love her service... meals was served hot and excellent taste..unforgettable place...sumptuous food and excellent staff like jane whose service was undeniably outstanding.. love to visit again!
Even better breakfast than the exec. lounge.,Had breakfast in the club/exec. lounge two mornings in a row and was so not impressed that we tried the Katong Kitchen downstairs on our last day. Thank god we did. Simply so many choices and probably one of the biggest buffet breakfasts we have ever been to. We should have tried it earlier.
dinner,"had the buffet dinner. this restaurant is under the same company as straits cafe. service is good, prompt in clearing used plates. food is decent."
Excellent Service,They have a range of local foods to try and I love their laksa. Their staff Mary did an excellent service with all smiles to their guests. Will surely come back 😊
Awesome spread,"Love the delicious spread of food. We had our iftar @ Katong Kitchen with my parents. My parents enjoyed the food. The laksa, chilli crayfish and variety of kueh were all good. Would come again next time."
Buffet dinner,"Food was topped up regularly, but I wouldn't rate as very good. Quality was good but not really exceptional. Roast beef was a little overdone. Seafood on ice was okay, lobster, crab legs, prawns, scallops, etc. The local dishes - curries, vegetables, noodles, etc were good. They could improve the selection if salads which was limited, and the deserts though. Price range acceptable but could be lower."
Good food good service,Food served fresh. Service staff were prompt and very polite. Ambience great. Not busy and noisy like some buffet restaurants.
Katong Kitchen,"The service crew were excellent! Went there for my wife birthday. We didn't had the buffet so we ordered ala carte. The only problem was, we had to wait about 45 minutes for our food. Other than that, it was a great experience."
What More Can I Say.............,"Great, Enjoyable, Excellent, all the superlatives............ from service, replenishment of food, buffet spread, quality of almost all of the various dishes except 3, mainly the oxtail rendang was a trifle firm & chewy, platter of mixed fruits lacking the basic papaya & nasi ulam was not exactly nasi ulam. 3 sub-par out of almost more than 40 varieties is a standard most hotel buffets here find very hard to match! Kudos to the F & B too!"
Poor value for money with mediocre food,"This restaurant was the only one with availability at the last minute. And when we arrived, we knew why. Food quality was mediocre at best. Grilled chicken was dry, roast beef was flavourless, steamed crab was very salty.
At the price it was charging, it represented a poor value for money.
The only saving grace was that the service staff who were efficient in clearing empty plates."
Mum's Birthday Surprise,"Joey who served us, played along with our plan to surprise our mum of her birthday. Even when our parents are skeptical, he went the extra mile to ensure that the surprise was not ruin. We really appreciate his gesture and the warm service from him. Thank you."
Ordered the most terrible pasta from foodpanda,"Had the misfortune of ordering an aglio olio from here. Was the most terrible pasta I have ever had. For $17+ you expect it to have a hint or a few pieces of garlic, there were none. I had to look for the asparagus with a magnifying glass and found a few. And the quantity, don't get me started. Never ordering from here again if they can't even get a simple pasta right."
Cosy & Relax,Enjoy much of the food & very relaxing. We came on weekday & the plc is not crowded & ww can seat peacefully rnjoying our food. Stadd are very friendly.
Lunch,"Good ambience, wide variety of food spread and excellent service especially from Joey. He was very attentative, friendly and caring. Will visit again!😀"
Excellent Service,Kenneth and Joey provided excellent service and extended their warmth and hospitality throughout dinner. We had a wonderful time celebrating my mum's birthday.
Yummy buffet and Superb Service by Joey..keep it up,"First time i write here in tripadvisor. Last mid of January. I brought my mother and father in Katong kitchen. We was greeted and lead us to the table by the named joey.

During buffet, we enjoyed a lovely variety of food and drinks that were fresh and delicious. Service was attentive throughout the entire lunch service.

Special mentioned to joey who came and interact with us. He was friendly and profeasional and it was lovely highlight of our lunch.

To my suprise joey brought a slice of birthday cake to my father. My mum and i was very happy. Definitely be returning again"
Feedback .....-.-,"Great dine experience with family.
Food 5stars we like it. Beverage 3star only water,tea and coffee. The Service staff 5stars especially Mary very efficient, friendly and helpful. Mr. Joey very accommodating and helpful too. Wide carpark but no free coupons. The ambiance perfect place with good a.c...."
Execellent Service but too expensive,"Went there for the 1st time due to a friend recommendations. was very impressive the moment i saw the restaurant. Mum was on wheelchair, the moment the greeter saw us, he immediately assisted my mum up using the elevator. when i was taking food with dad, a lady name shirley approached my mum to ask what drink would he like. when we are done, another guy came to ask my dad who was taking food earlier what drink would he like. oh ya.. shirley even offered to make laksa for my mum!!! overall service was super excellent!! people was on duty was jack shirley and another tall guy with specs. all staff was super! CONGRATS VILLAGE KATONG for your excellent staff. i might return if the price is reduce.. its really expensive. spread is not that much too."
Good buffet 👍🏾,"Very good spread! I enjoyed the seafood section! The crab, prawns & other seafood were fresh and aplenty! Another dessert you must try is the durian pudding! It was so yummy! The restaurant is huge, clean and has huge sitting capacity! Staffs were prompt and friendly! All food items were quickly replenished as they finish! There’s so much food and you have only 1 tummy, is the only regret ✌! Must try! It’s good for big groups too! Check it out!"
Food,"Not much food variety such as satay, salmon sushi etc. Overall are ok. Very friendly staff. Able to request birthday cake for my Mother upon request that day."
Enjoyable lunch,"Had the buffet lunch in mid January with my good friends. The ambience is classy and colonial , especially when we sat on the tables near the periphery of the restaurant. Food was good, especially the laksa and desserts. Overall, it was a good spread for the Peranakan theme and value for money. Prawns were exceptionally fresh and in abundance, while desserts were scrumptious.
Lastly, would like to commend the staff for their attentive service. The manager was very kind to provide a cake for my friend who was celebrating her birthday. He even managed to give her a pleasant surprise.
We had very pleasant experience dining here and will not hesitate to go back again."
"Perfect Ambiance, Great Food, Exceptional Service, Improvement for Advertisement","I made a reservation for our reunion Lunch in Katong restaurant. I am very surprise with the cosy ambiance the restaurant was very clean. I come early to check our table arrangement and the hostest lady assist me. While having our meal we really enjoy the choices of food. Ayam Buah Keluak is very tender and tasty, Beef Rendang is good too. Even my friend really like the taste of Laksa they tried twice because the gravy was very tasty, while on dessert area we all like the Cheesecake, Ondeh Ondeh cake having a unique taste which is not so sweet, Durian pengat is the Best! I'm also amazed with the exceptional service given by Mary she's very eager to help even she's busy. One of my friend was late and difficult for her to find the restaurant due to lack of direction Mary volunteered to fetch my friend downstair she just ask what color she wear and i just show her the photos of my friend and finally my friend reached the restaurant really appreciate the smart help of her. Even Leo was very friendly and cheerful has a smile on his face while given his service. My group really enjoy our simple reunion Lunch and we surely come back to dine. Hoping that the restaurant will provide a clear direction way to restaurant. Keep up the good work team!"
Ignored special occasion,"I made the booking with the request that it was someone's birthday. This was overlooked. The next table received a cake and a birthday song and our 80 year old birthday boy did not.When I went to make payment I told the Flilippina cashier "" today is the actual day for my father in law's birthday"" and she looked at me blankly and said ""so?"". Since we had already finished, I did not press the issue about the cake. However, they also have birthday offer ( Price - age of birthday person) and she did not mention this, I knew this from the restaurant website and I told her about it and then she grudgingly admitted it.She maintained a sour face throughout and did not even thank me after the bill payment was done!Ambience was OK, Food not bad for the price - there was snow crab and lobsters on ice, but rather tasteless and rubbery so worth it if looking for lots of cheap seafood. We went there mainly for the ayam buah keluak and there was none! The gula melaka in the cendol section was not the real stuff - no fragrance at all. So if you are there for Peranakan food - a disappointment."
"Glad, we came......","Were there for Sunday lunch, it was an impromptu decision. The service was truly FIRST CLASS, FRIENDLY & EFFICIENT, only 2 grouses namely; the ayam buah keluak was only ayam and a tint of watery buah keluak sauce (no actual buah in sight), prawns were super fresh but not replenished until quite some time later and were only served thawed de-shelled prawns(sad!) Other than these 2 dishes, the rest were very tasty and adequate.
Again, I must stressed that their service level puts many 5 star or so called French tyre(Michelin) rating restaurants to shame!
We had in fact booked for a Pre-CNY reunion dinner there."
Very good restaurant,I particularly like the service. The servers are polite and are quick to take away your used dishes. The food spread is not too wide but the food tastes very good.Would not mind coming back here.
Does not take your breath away,Very loud late at night and full of locals (which can be exactly what you are looking for) but the food (chicken rice so pretty basic) did not blow us away.
Exceptional variety,"This Dec bring a buffet spread of xmas items such as turkey and honey baked chicken ham. The honey baked chicken ham was exceptionally tender and juicy. Love the sauce accompanying the turkey and beef. Log cake was wonderful. The usual buffet items were also there such as nyonya DIY kueh pie tee, katong laksa and prawn noodles. The garlic rice was very delicious and goes very well with the lobster otah and sambal belacan. Although I felt the fried kueh teow was average and a tad bit dry. The durian pengat was superb along with the cempedak creme brulee. I simply love the red ruby dessert with the ice shavings - add as you like it. DIY your own gado-gado and rojak to add in only your favourite ingredients."
Dinner mum birthday,"The food is superb very delicious, great place. My mum enjoy her birthday celebration. Thanks for the Birthday cakes and sing from the staff."
A Decent Hala Restaurant,"I was there with my business associates for lunch. The buffet spread has a good mix of fresh seafood, hot station and dessert counter. Is a good place for entertainment if you need to entertain Malay friends. Overall a nice decent place."
Excellent!,Service was good and most importantly the food is awesome! Keep up the good work and we will surely return!
meat too tough,"the red meats in the curry dishes were all too tough. plus there seems to be a lot of elderly patrons, so i wondered how they managed to eat!"
Good Food,Went there as a family of 5. The food was good and worth the price we paid for as the varieties was quite good. Staffs were also pleasant.
Great variety and friendly service!,"We had a great dinner birthday celebration at Katong Kitchen over the weekend! The seafood is fresh and refilled regularly, meats were tender and cooked food was tasty too! The highlight was definitely the dessert section, durian pengat was heavenly and the very unique chempedak creme brulee was interesting. Staff were attentive, but sometimes a bit too eager to clean your plates."
Breakfast buffet,"Great variety of food including dim sum, curry , noodles etc. A refreshing change from the typical western fare in many hotels. I was very happy with this breakfast!"
Exceptional service,"I visited Katong Kitchen twice while my family was staying there. I found the staff friendly and understanding. Especially Mr Leo was exceptional. My 6 month old baby was sleeping and he offered a quiet baby friendly seating. The service was quick and friendly. I visited for breakfast another day and he greeted us with the same smile and cheerfulness. Just little things and thoughtfulness made my visit great! Thanks, will visit again soon."
Perankan Food,Generally most of the dishes were good except for the sambal stingray. It was overcooked and oily. We were disappointed that the chendol is available only during lunch and not dinner.
Birthday celebration,"1st time dine in at Katong Kitchen nice ambience,so much choices of food spread & good,friendly staff and so welcoming will be back again worth the money 😉"
Birthday & Family Celebration,Convenient location with a reasonable spread. The design has Peranakan touch & friendly staff. Dessert was sweet & nice
Lunch Buffet,"The services from both waiters and waitresses was prompt.
Nice and comfy ambience.
I like the most was the fresh seafoods, the main dish.
Only that on the day i came was served Nasi Briyani buffet set.
Was actually looking forward to taste the nyonya cuisine such as the Ayam Buah Keluak."
Not quite worth the price,"The food is only so-so. I mean, there are lots of food options all around the area. This is Joo Chiat / East Coast Road, after all. For the same price, you can get better and cheaper food. The air-conditioning here is also very cold and not very comfortable. The only reasons I can think of for eating would be because it's part of the hotel room package or it's raining and you cannot go anywhere else."
A little Gem in the East,"If looks can be deceiving, this is it! The restaurant looks small but with a vast variety of food. International flauvor with a touch of peranakan food at it's best!! The service was good and prompt; staff were friendly. Hope to return again some day."
Lovely food,"Dinner at Katong Kitchen was an early celebration for Mother’s Day.

Nice and lovely food choices with some Peranakan/nyonya dishes too. Some great food to try include the signature laksa, freshly made sambal, chempedak creme brulee, kuih pie tee amongst others.

What was a put off was that the sashimi was not for us to help ourselves to but a staff had to plate it for us.

Overall the plates were cleared almost immediately. Staff was friendly and helpful.

We were pleasantly surprised when we discovered that those 60 and above were entitled to a 50% discount. This was awesome as 4 out of the 6 of us were entitled to the 50% discount."
Halal-certified peranakan food,"It was my first trip to Katong Kitchen yesterday for lunch with my family. There's a wonderful selection of food even for a non meat eater like me as there's variety for everyone. Most importantly the food is fresh. There's cold seafood selection, oysters, sashimi, tuna, laksa, broccoli soup, Assam Prawns, English beef stew, mutton rending, biryani rice, salad, ice cream (4 local flavours to choose from), ice kacang and nonya kuih including durian pengat. The sambal belacan is lovely so I practically dip the prawn crackers and even the cold seafood into the sambal belacan. I'm glad that this restaurant is also halal-certified. This is one buffet place I will come again. If you are into local dishes, then you should book a table here. Oh, btw, this restaurant is wheelchair friendly too! They have a chair lift to transport a wheelchair bound person to their restaurant. Their staff including their restaurant manager, Leo, are friendly and very accommodating. The buffet spread is along the perimeter of the restaurant so wherever you are seated, food is within reach :)"
Highly recommended!,Mesmerized by the delectable viands we've tasted on Katong Kitchen! Our dining experience had been much better thanks to the kind Katong Kitchen staff. Special thanks to Mary Jane who greatly assisted us when we were choosing our meals. Will definitely recommend Katong Kitchen to my colleagues who are planning to visit Singapore soon.
Good buffet spread and dessert!,Good customer service and fast in clearing the plates. Kids will definitely enjoys the wide spread of desserts.
Lovely ambience,Went there this month for the first time for a group lunch. The restaurant is well setup for that as well as also offering quieter areas on the sides. it is MUIS certified so fits well with our needs. The variety is not overwhelming for lunch buffet but is more than compensated by the selection and quality.
Rating on Katong Kitchen,Not much of selection for buffet dinner and the quality of food is nothing great about it. Lack of good service due to not enough waiter/waitress.
Great gathering place for big groups,"We are a group of 12 ex-classmates. We chose Katong Kitchen because they serve Halal food. We have 3 muslims with us. The variety of the buffet is plentiful. For $48 per pax, it is value for money. Though I do not need to eat Halal food, I will definitely bring my family here. The laksa and Peranakan food are highly recommended!"
2nd visit,Good service and it was my second visit to celebrate my mum's birthday. A little disappointed that the restaurant didn't offer the nonya kuehs as i think they're good! I casually included that it's for my mum's birthday in the reservation and the restaurant actually prepared a slice of cake for her
CNY Dinner,"It was disappointing for the poor value for money. We have visited this restaurant twice last year and food quality and spread had been reasonable. However, the spread and quality was lousy for the $68 charged on CNY. For this price, I might as well go to Feast at East at Roxy Mecure next door."
Disappointed,"I have been to Katong Kitchen for a few times and this is my first time trying out their CNY Buffet with my family. The seafood area, the cooked food area were not promptly refill. It could be they are lack of manpower due to the festive season. Also even it is refilled, only a small portion of oysters, no crab, prawns came later. The cooked food area is the same. Besides that it is not cheap and my family didn't have a satisfied meal."
Average,"The quality of food has dropped. The cracker, you tiao was hard and not chewable. The bread pudding too. The nyonya popiah doesn’t taste good. The food wasn’t topped up immediately and most of the selection were pretty little. The laksa was still good, the dessert such as the mango sticky rice too. And the 1-1 offer made it not too bad."
Enjoyed!,"Overall pleasant experience. Chempedak creme brulee, pie tee, chili crayfish, seafood on ice, lamb chop, bread butter pudding, desserts, pengat durian were all good. The rest of the dishes i didnt try because wasnt that appetizing."
Nice food,Great place n food but some food not topup after finish. Appreciate to have more choices of seafood.
Enviroment & Foods,"Kitchen@Katong can put in my Favourite restaurant on the next visit cause the foods taste very marvellous, clean and good environment."
Good Halal restaurant,"My forth trip to the restaurant . My friends were impressed with the buffet spread .
Planning my next visit this Friday. Very pleasant and attentive staff.
Improvement on the soup and more choices on breads would be great. I like the selection on the main courses good combination. Keep it Up."
Not value for money,58 ++. I rather travel further down south to central MBS and pay additional 20 for quality food. It is not worth the trip and bring family to this restaurant.
Lunch,Satisfying lunch with good service and ambience. Food spread was wide and delicious. My fourth visit to this excellent place
Dinner with Family,"The booking was easily done through CHOPE, There was a wide variety of food. It is value for money and atmosphere quiet and conducive for a family gathering cum birthday dinner. The staff were all very helpful."
Quality food at reasonable price!,"While some buffets might have a larger array of items, Katong Kitchen keeps it simple by offering quality food that matters, such as the signature katong laksa (I slurped up the gravy!), the durian mousse, the chilli crayfish, etc. There is a free flow drinks station with Bandung and house-brewed iced tea. I topped up my dinner with a lovely bowl of red bean soup - just the way I like it. The buffet truly stays true to the location of the hotel - the Katong / Peranakan flavour."
Review,"The food, ambiance, environment, atmosphere was good especially with awesome company! Great for families too!"
Buffet lunch,Nice buffet but location abit far. For seafood section variety can be improved.ambient is ok service is ok.
A good dining experience but price could have been a bit lower for weekday.,"I brought my team there to thank them for the hard work. I chose the place because one team member is a Muslim. They were all pleasantly surprised by the spread and quality of food as well as the service. Service staff is friendly, attentive and willing to go out of their way. My Muslim colleague immediately said she would take her parents there. Overall a good dining experience for us."
New year dinner,"It was normal buffet spread considering it is a new year and the price. Not very spectacular. Liked the steamed and grilled shrimp, creme brulee chempadak"
Best,Wide variety of peranakan food! Beef rendang was the best.. Great staff service as well! Quite expensive though..
