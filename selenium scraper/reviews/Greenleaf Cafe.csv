Wow...Great taste,Traveling from usa for holiday....went to Little India to visit. Looked at TripAdvisor for Authentic Indian vegetable food.The reviews looked good so went.Man wow...never had tofu made like real meat...The taste was unbelievable. Hole in a wall restaurant but excellent food....will definitely return üëå
Really friendly restaurant serving amazing vegetarian Indian food,"Went there for dinner, the owner was really nice and recommended some amazing and healthy dishes for me to try, served with their turmeric water that was so refreshing."
Food is excellent,"The food is really, really, really good. And the atmosphere in the restaurant is cosy and welcoming."
An absolute gem of a place,Wonderful veggie Indian cafe/restaurant in Little India. Was eating alone and made to feel very welcome by the owners. The food was excellent and I can‚Äôt recommend highly enough. Superb!
Unassuming but Wow!,"We found this unassuming restaurant and oh my, we were not disappointed. We both had the Thali and it comprised a lovely mixture of tasty flavours. A value for money experience and we will definitely be back."
tempting delight,The atmosphere was calm and cool. The eatery look gd with clean interior. The meals arrived a bit late but the food was ok.
Hone cooked authentic food,Authentic and just like home cooked South Indian food. Ingredients are fresh and food is also prepared fresh. Has a homely feel to it. Would be back.
Best south Indian thali in SG at the price points on offer!,"I started to order as well as visit this place since 2020 only. Meals were as good as we prepare at home. I love their soups, all kinds of keerai's and herbs! Simple and good for the stomach. The menu spread and options is lovely and how they have given a bit of context to each dish for non native south Indian food connoisseur.

I have tried sapadu, adai, chapathi meal, fried rice, machurian, soups, sweets - millet laddoos, beetroot halwa, some other halwas, tea, coffee, sukku coffee..all were decent. Wish with Adai, they had avial defacto in the menu. Dosas were good. South Indian dishes beats any north Indian dishes at this place, perhaps has been our experience. Thali's/ meal/ sapadu my personal fav for lunch

I dont see too many, if not any one else who does adai in Singapore. Need to still explore further, might find another hidden gem when time permits.

Few improvement areas-
- Most of the menus - physical ones in the restaurant call for perhaps a new reprint
- The gentleman owner, never prints a receipt/ bill of what you ate and ordered. This is something I have observed time and again. Perhaps one need to ask for it, but may be I did not...
- Restaurant Hygiene could improve, but at price points at which they feed Singapore - worth every dollar you spend on their spread!
- Staff - young boys, friendly and prompt. At peak times when they do open in between lockdowns, they do tend to get overwhelmed when customer footfall is higher in evenings or during lunch
- Not consistent in their delivery policies: sometimes they deliver like during CB/ lockdowns, but when they open - at times, the gentleman just wants us to do take aways as he is a one man show running a busy place.

He is lovely and very nice nice guy - someone who was in corporate world and then got in to this business, if I recall vaguely from one of my conversations with him."
A thali that was light!,I am always looking for a new place to try and this was such a pleasant surprise. The food really does taste home-cooked.
"Good food, but slow service","The food is very good, but the service is extremely slow. The servers basically ignore the customers. We were seated outside and served hot water. There are people outside smoking. Overall not a pleasant experience."
Sumptuous and healthy,"My husband and I had the best vegetarian Indian lunch here today. All the dishes we ordered were stellar! The banana flower cake was divine ; we can taste the fresh herbs and good quality ingredients that went into this lovingly deep fried dish. Best part? They weren‚Äôt even the slightest bit oily. My chapatti was fluffy and light. The poori were so delicious and doesn‚Äôt taste of stale oil. The mushroom peppery stir fry was surprisingly delicious and bursting w flavour; I can taste the ginger bay leaves and basil that went into this beautiful dish. And we use our breads to mop up every single morsel in our tomato based paneer. We both agreed the cheese is so fresh, and the best tasting we have ever tried. Our milk ginger tea came w brown sugar; they are so fragrant. The sweet lassi also deserves special mention; it‚Äôs light , slightly sweet and so fresh. All in all, a most sumptuous yet healthy meal. The friendly owner and his lovely wife are so pleasant. We will be back for more!!"
Indian vegetarian dinner,"Found this restaurant on TripAdvisor and was not disappointed. Husband and wife team . Good local vibe. Great food . Poori bread delicious. Mushroom marsala tiptop along with a sweet n sour cauliflower dish. Added a couple of roti to mop up the curry. Dessert very nice almond, some kind of sugar and rose water combo .. very friendly, great food marsala tea...cant wait to return or order out."
Awesome Rava Thosai,"Greenleaf, once again won my heart for serving the one and only Herbal cuisine in Singapore. They are South Indians dishes and very creative in fusing dishes. We had Panner and blackpepper long grain rice.
Awesome and authentic Rava thosai, unlike the commercial type. Homemade ginger tea.
When comes to traditional food, presentation doesn't matter."
Delicious lunchtime trip,"Another one visited on the basis of reviews here. Quiet when I went on monday lunchtime. The man who I assume is the boss was very helpful providing some guidance on what to have, settled for a south indian thali with chappati. It arrived pretty quickly. By default they also serve cumin flavoured warm warter as an accompaniment. Never had that before but very nice.

Food was great, about 10 different little pots, all of which but the sweet one was empty pretty quickly. Definitely deserves its high rating for the food, the service and the attitude. Menu is interesting as it opens with a 'declaration' what it does/doesnt use in its food and why. They are clearly deeply food focused.

only thing to fault?? mmm, the boss is a Liverpool fan :-), but apart from that, he is a really nice chap."
A great find,"Very friendly staff, a wide variety of foods and drinks, good price, delicious. Will recommend to others and will be back."
Deliciously healthy!,"Delicious healthy meals.. Combined with great service. Located in a quiet lane, this is a haven for healthy indian meal lovers. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Very nice food!,"Family runs the business, very down to earth service staff as well. Polite & helpful with recommendations. Will check out what you're really feel like having before recommending off the menu. Wide range of vegetarian selections as well, good to go with my vegetarian friends!"
Seek this place out!,"We ordered a chili paneer, mushroom masala, and a rainbow dosa, and each was flawlessly spiced and seasoned for a taste that had us wanting to order more despite being full. The staff were very friendly and helpful when asked for recommendations. We are looking for more opportunities to eat here this trip!"
Buffet Spread,Great lunch buffet spread at only 15 dollars nett. Many varieties of traditional indian vegetables can be found in this cafe. Buffet only available for lunch and menu changes daily.
"Avoid, disappointing, unwelcoming!","We read the rave reviews, hoped to try authentic South Indian food. Opted to get a taxi from the other side of the city to try the Thali, believing this would encompass a variety of flavours. On arriving my partner smiled at the staff awaiting a table. Despite it being empty, we stood waiting until someone eventually came along and presented as uninterested- perhaps that should have been our warning. After requesting the Thali, we watched as the items were taken from the left over buffet - unknown how long it had sat out for however the rice etc all arrived cold / poppadoms were soggy and we noticed items were missing from what was advertised on the menu. We sat trying to get someone‚Äôs attention, however staff were uninterested/ on phones etc. Eventually I had to get up and enquire to be told they didn‚Äôt have the items left that was on the menu. The staff then added one other left over item from the buffet- again soggy and cold/ stale. The items on the thali were lacking in flavour, cold and we were really disappointed. When it came to pay, again we had to get up and go and ask someone. Overall, no idea why this has the reviews it does as it‚Äôs the worst service / Indian food we have ever encountered."
We had dinner at this wonderful,"We had dinner at this wonderful little cafe. Good selection of very tasty vegetarian southern Indian food. Family run, popular with locals and well worth a visit."
Amazing place to have some authentic Tamil food.Very hygienic and great staff,"Tucked in little India, a very quite place for a dinner with family and friends.Absolutely loved the place"
Healthy delicious food,"The restaurant is located in a very quiet street, not far from the city center. There is a terrace as well. The food is fantastic, well cooked and it feels very good."
Delicious vegetarian food,Fresh flavors and friendly service in Little India. Owners were friendly and provided great menu recommendations for our family.
Great Indian Food,"Clean, yummy, filling and healthy. All you can ask from a great Indian dish. The owner is a great guy that loves to talk with his guests."
Poor Hospitality. Half the things on the menu not available,Understaffed. Items on the menu not available. The offers on the table do not hold for everyone. Poor service all in all.
Feel good food. Especially,"Feel good food. Especially after yoga. Enough variety to make the meal enjoyable, healthy and fresh to make you feel nourished. No frills, just real concern for the food and the people eating it."
Healthier Indian vegetarian food!,"Really happy to have found this cafe which serves healthier Indian vegetarian dishes, even some Ayurvedic ones too. They even have various types of herbal teas. And they serve warm herbal water to all customers. On the day we went, warm cumin water was served. Delicious. Such a rare find in Singapore!

Not sure if there is another of such cafes in Singapore. So if you are looking for a healthier Indian vegetarian experience, highly recommend this cafe!"
One of the best veg Indian food served in Singapore,"What a spread! The selection of vegetables are not your common carrots and cabbage that‚Äôs offered in most other veg Indian places in Singapore. They also did some pretty unique dishes, of which my faves are poricche tomato curry (fried tomato curry), paruppu rasam (a little ‚Äúcreamier‚Äù than a rasam and it‚Äôs YUM) and carrot thovaiyal. The carrot thovaiyal was out of the world! So good.

I‚Äôve just transitioned to a veg lifestyle but have always ate clean, so a no soda restaurant is my go to. The only ‚Äúcheat‚Äù item here (which you don‚Äôt have to take at all if you don‚Äôt want to) will be white rice. Apart from that no sugar is added in any food items.

I had the buffet today."
Excellent!,"I'm so glad I ignored the one scathing review and believed in the majority. Thisl was a great dining experience. The place is clean and modern. I was greeted and seated as I walked in by presumably the wife of the proprietor. Within seconds I had tea, and as soon as I put the menu down she approaches again to take my order. I took someone else's suggestion and asked her what she recommended based on my interests. She brought me the pepper tofu and the rainbow dosa. I had the tofu, hot and freshly prepared, within 7 .inites (you KNOW when tofu is old!). The dosa was right behind. Within 10 minutes of arrival I had all my food, plus my delicious ginger tea. The tofu was fragrant with fennel, garlic and onion. Just slightly too salty for NY tastes, but otherwise great. The dosas were the right mix of firm and flexible and not gritty. They clearly derive their flavor from slices, not fat.

One of the most impressive things was the way the owners treated the customers. Even the foreign travelers were treated like family.

I highly recommend this family restaurant, even for those who are not vegetarian or vegan but just like healthy food (like me)."
Healthy Indian Choice,"Really nice, wholesome and healthy Indian restaurant. Lots of vegetarian options, with a focus on Ayurveda diets. You even get served coriander water. The service and restaurant is quite basic, but cleaner and less hectic than a lot of the alternatives in the area"
Best vegetarian place,"Great place, very cheap. The host was very kind, if you are not familiar with the dishes I recommend that you let him order a variety of meals for you."
healthy and homey,I am vegan and they prepare you meals very gladly. there is so much offer! finally food without MSG or chemical flavours. It is not on the main road and that makes it even better. thumbs up to friendliness and good work!
There are better vegetarian restaurants,"Took a taxi to come here after reading all these glowing reviews but somehow felt disappointed, maybe my expectations were too high.
Food wasn't bad, except the fried rice i ordered for my children as they don't eat spicy food, it was too much black pepper, they could not eat it.
The worst was the service, uninterested at best. I chose the buffet (advertised at $13 on their menu and $15 at the buffet station, when i mentioned this, the gentleman told me that it was the old price, fair enough but update your menu if you increase your prices please.
Nobody ever came to check on us and at one point all staff strarted having their meal just a few tables away from us.
Once again i wouldn't mind but when we were ready to pay the bill and leave, no one even noticed, i had to call them, and felt i was disturbing.
All in all if you pass by not a bad option, but if you come from far as i did you might be disappointed."
Let the food do the talking,"No frills restaurant with tasty food and lovely, honest staff. An array of options on the menu that you‚Äôd have to do two trips to give a fair comment."
Honest Great Food!,"Without any expectations got in fact very impressed by the freshness, taste and fragrance of food. Excellent service, I will come back.. Banana flower cakes and Paneer are awasome.."
Great vegetarian/vegan food!,Great vegetarian/vegan food! We loved our meals which were very fresh and tasted. The owner is extremely nice and makes sure you‚Äôre happy with you meal. Pricing is very reasonable as well. Recommended!
Homely vegetarians restaurant.,Homely vegetarians restaurant. The deco feels like entering into somebody‚Äôs house. The food taste like home cook food. The service feels like being serve by a friend at their house.
Fantastic experience.,"The owner is a very nice guy. He helps you tailoring up the perfect meal for you. All I was served was downright delicious. Plus, I asked for some ginger in my beetroot juice. No problem. The guest is the King.:-) Also, I liked the natural, ""down-to-earth"" atmosphere at the place. Everyone seemed to be having such a great time. Thanks Boss."
"I am not a Vegetarian, but it is the place to eat","After arriving in Litte India we just walked around and found, very small but friendly, this place to relax and have a very fine indian a bit spicy food with a charming crew. Small kitchen, big heart and very fresh food. Cuff Road very local, but authentic."
Tasty!,Super tasty vegetarian (vegan and Jain options available too) and enjoyed reading about all the health benefits from different spices and herbs. The spicy paneer was the best!
Healthy food,"I came across this restaurant via social media and trip advisor ratings, visited this restaurant and got amazed with the food they serve, all healthy options. Tried hibiscus tea, natural taste and very good, planning to visit again with my friends to try other food."
"Fantastic food, authentic","We had a great lunch here. This place really matches its high ranking on Tripadvisor. We received excellent advice from the friendly staff at the restaurant. The food (we took the √† la carte, but there was also a buffet) was delicious, from the Southern India region and very authentic. Do not be taken aback by the somewhat unassuming location, this place is a gem!"
Nice authentic food,"Very good food, nice authentic taste, healthy food, satisfied with the food and taste. Banana flower vada is excellent."
Excellent south Indian food,"I came to Singapore on a short visit, was missing authentic south Indian food. My friend recommended this place, tried lunch, truly homely taste. I really enjoyed."
Healthy vegetarian indian food,"I am regular eater, food they serve is with authentic taste with homely touch. I usually eat lunch most of the days. Every day quite different dishes with good taste."
Uninspiring,"I'm usually not that fond of englishified indian eateries, and they have this ""healthy, no msg, sugar"" etc thing going, which is good i suppose in country without an obvious organic industry. Grass green plates and decor. I suppose i should have noticed that it was not at all busy. Anyway our idli was just a bit dry and the other one soggy and both tasted ok but uninspiring. Idli, being without meat is all about the sambar. And this was nothing like those i had in Chennai. Just a bit bland. On the upside the lime and herbal juices were good."
Great even for non-veggies,Thank you for the nice hospitality. It was great to visit this place and have some nice vegetable foods.
Great vegetarian restaurant,We ate there tonight. Loved the food. Very fresh and tasty. Loved the homemade ice cream simply delicious.
Very tasty south Indian food,"I went with my family yesterday the food is very good and staff is also very food .carrot vada,millet based item are very good"
yummy!,"Amazing! Don‚Äôt miss out on trying out the food at Greenleaf - it‚Äôs just fantastic, healthy and reasonably priced. I went as a solo woman traveller and felt safe and happy. Delicious, will come back!"
Extodinary take on Traditional Food,Some of the best Indian food we have had on our travels. They have some unique flavors of the traditional food we are used to was a bit sceptical at first but really enjoyed trying the new flavors if you like Indian Food specially South Indian food this is a must try. The prices are reasonable and the food quality is top notch.
Good wholesome vegetarian indian food,Vegan/vegetarian indian food. I had the all you can eat buffet so was able to taste a bit of everything. It all tasted really really good. Very happy I stopped by.
Good local restaurant,"We had too much before visiting this restaurant. Despite we order the minimal, the owner was extremely friendly. Appreciate the principles of natural and healthy Indian food üëçüèª"
"Wow, Simply Amazing! Found","Wow, Simply Amazing!
Found this little beauty whilst looking for some tasty Indian food. Back home in the UK we are spoilt for choice, we like it on the spicy side (fresh chillis and herbs).

Normally not too easy to find on our travels, until today. The owner greeted us when we arrived, and explained the menu. We must have looked a little lost so he asked our preference at home we said spicy and normally meat based.

No worries he replied may I suggest (always a good start in my book). 1 starter, 2 mains, 1 side & 2 roots later, I was blown away with the flavours....

This place is a must try!!!"
Kids Friendly and Tasty Food,"Being a south Indian and kids are used to have idli and vada, I was suffering in Singapore for tasty south Indian food. Greenleaf turned to be the right place for us for Breakfast and Dinner as we were roaming out during lunch time.

The special dishes and organic food makes them to stand unique compared to others. Specially the crispy Vazhaipoo vadai is not a commonly available dish and my kids and myself enjoyed it. A must visit for green and organic food lovers. Forgot to mention the Nannari Sarbath also tasty and fantastic"
A little gem,"Popped to the Green Leaf Cafe for lunch; I like the fact that this cafe focus on the health benefits of good food. I ordered the mix veg pulao (mixed veg and rice) which cost $7 so was a good value lunch option. The portion was generous, and the food tasty and filling. Spice level was medium - mostly not that spicy but every now and again you‚Äôd get a very spicy mouthful! The free cumin water was not for me - I had a few sips but not to my taste as I‚Äôve never been a fan of cumin.
All in all, a great little cafe with lots of vegan options and I will hopefully visit here again before I leave Singapore."
Yummy vegetarian food @ Greenleaf cafe,"Bringing us back to nature with natural ingredients, the food at Greenleaf Cafe is a must try..! Especially for veggie lovers.."
Best South Indian Restaurant in Singapore,"I just went to the restaurant checking the reviews online. Menu is quite different than others. I tried Chappathi Noodles, tastes excellent. One of the must visits for a quality food in Singapore. I would really recommend this restaurant for everyone. Good selection of food and good taste I enjoyed it."
Excellent south Indian snacks,"went and had snacks, excellent food with authentic taste. Good menu choices, healthy options. Variety menu."
Different and unique choices,"I am amazed to see the unique menu options like paniyaram, Sunday, banana flower vada here. I tried sweet paniyaram, excellent taste, homely food"
Quality First Class but Quanlity n price not good,Food is like home cooked. Price is too high for the quantity. Very things was served very little in very little tray. They want us to buy buffet to make more money.
Excellent Indian filter coffee,"My friend recommended this place, visited to try snacks. All the food are authentic, especially South Indian filter coffee. Wow, great taste and good flavor"
Good authentic south Indian food,Menu choices are healthy and tastes authentic. This restaurant have their own principles to prepare healthy food. Must recommend to others...
Quality Indian/Vegetarian Cuisine,"Is it good? Yes. Is it worth a trip across town? No If you‚Äôre in Little India this a perfectly suitable spot for a flavourful, vegetarian meal. Lunch $30SGD for 2pax (including tea)."
Authentic homely food,"I am from south india, miss my homely taste food. Came to my friend that this restaurant serve authentic food. Tried paniyaram, adai. Excellent food"

Yummy food :),"Started being a regular visitor of this restaurant. Food is awesome and nevertheless, most of the dishes are unique. Esp I like banana flower vadai and veg lollipop, which are their specialities. The beauty is, cost is nominal and it doesnt burn your pocket. Overall, can have a satisfactory meal if you head there. Thumbs up Greenleaf :)"
Very nice indian vegeterian food,"The staff was very kind. She helped us who are trouble in choosing foods. The foods was very nice and I havn't had food like this before, especially in kor neither in singapore."
Banana Flower Vada,"Highly recommend. Simple and clean place. Delicious food! Service very friendly. Great menu, with many options"
Excellent South Indian food with ‚Äúunique‚Äù touch,"This place serves some excellent South Indian food with some unique dishes available such as different kinds of vadas (banana flower Vada, spinach vada), dosas (fenugreek dosa, pearl millet onion dosa), 5 different kinds of uttapams in one serving, etc. They have some nice herbal drinks available too...

Heard that their lunch thali brunch is amazing too, but this is not available for dinner.

The owner is very friendly and personally advises on which dishes to order.

Must try."

Very good South Indian food,"My friend requested me to try food here, menu shows all the food they serve is with health benefits. Tried jigarthanda, wow great unique taste."
Excellent quality traditional food at reasonable prices - but not all will like it,"The restaurant serves food made from items like thinai, samai etc as well as offers some regular items. It is a small place and service is a bit slow. It cant be compared to the other regular Indian eating places like Komala Vilas because it is a different type of food. Not all items will be available as they possibly cannot make all of it on the same day -but what is available is good.
Those who visited Prem's Grama Bhojanam in Chennai might relate to it to a great extent"
"WORST FOOD IN SINGAPORE AND TERRIBLE, PATHETIC SERVICE","Most disgusting food that I had ever eaten in Singapore and rates are super high for this sub standard fare. Not value for money AT ALL.
I went based on the above reviews on the website. But trust me, they are all wrong and paid reviews. We ordered South Indian thali and poori set. The curries that came along with the rice were all cold and worse was the hotel had a audacity to serve left overs from the buffet menu.
Waiters attending us had no clue what is available or what is not. They point to someone else every time you ask for something.
Based on the so called good reviews, yes the owner would attend customers personally. But that doesn‚Äôt help as he was the one who suggested what is good at his place and that turned out to be all bad dishes.
We ate that crap cold food and at the time of paying our cheque, I complained about the food. That man had the audacity to say that ‚ÄòTHEY CANNOT SATISFY ALL THEIR CUSTOMERS‚Äô.
I highly recommend not to waste your money on this disgusting place!
NOT WORTH A PENNY...."
Best South Indian Restaurant in Singapore,"I visit this restaurant every Saturday, being an Indian I don‚Äôt miss my home food because food in green leaf Cafe is just like my mom cooked food.
I have tried many variety of dishes here and my most favourite is Ragi Puttu, Banana Flower Vadai, all lentil Variety Sundal and can add more items to the list.
You must try this restaurant."
Authentic healthy South Indian restaurant,"I am a regular visitor to this restaurant,food is excellent and it's prepared with homely touch.

Variety south Indian dishes,"After returning from Phuket, had a chance to visit this restaurant. Tried chilli idly, excellent taste, made differently. Saw the menu, they serve other healthy options. Would like to visit again."
India in Singapore,"I've travelled round much of India sampling virtually all the different styles of food, Greenleaf truly brings it to Singapore. The staff are like family (perhaps they are!), extremely welcoming and friendly. They explain the food and help show you how to indulge if you're unsure.

The thali is incredible, tea brilliant and all the side dishes top it all off. It's very cheap for the quality of food and deserves to be sung about. Love this place."
"Healthiest, cheapest and tastiest Indian food in Singapore",The lunch buffet is a steal but the ala carte menu offers a much wider range to try. Recommend that you visit twice so that you can try everything. Definitely deserves its high ranking on tripadvisor.
excellent,"delicious different home-style veg food - tastes so healthy. Staff friendly. Well done, will return for sure"

It is exactly similar to how my mom does this. I must thank this restaurant for their delicious food, superb unique dishes with healthy varieties. Service was great."
Delicious food at bargain prices.,"I expected a good meal based on the ratings on this site. My expectations were exceeded. Superbly spiced foods, multilayered flavours resulting in a gastronomic delight. Portion sizes were adequate if slightly less generous than similar establishments. Certainly did not leave hungry. Highly recommended."
The most delicious vegetarian meal,"Excellent meal. Unique flavours, a healthy meal. Attention staff. A refreshing alternative to regular Indian dining."
Good healthy food options,"Recommended by my friend, visited this restaurant during my visit to Singapore. Surprised to see this restaurant serves millet items. Tried one of the millet based pongal, excellent homely taste."

Glanced through the menu, restaurant serves healthy food options. Planning to visit next time"
Home kitchen away from home,"Tucked inside a small lane near Little India is a nondescript restaurant that had been highly recommended by friends It turned out to be a real gem - much like visiting your good friend‚Äôs mum‚Äôs kitchen back in the good ol‚Äô days. The place has an ‚ÄòA‚Äô cleanliness rating and serves a mean menu of various pure #Indian #vegetarian fare (no ) against a backdrop of classic Tamil songs. They use only fresh ingredients so the menu is not fixed since what comes out from their kitchen depends on what is available at the market on that day. The host walks around throughout the evening to advise and help diners understand the food that we eat (sometimes to helpfully show you the proper way to eat the dishes) We were served jeera-infused (black cumin) water in copper flasks and glasses (copper absorbs toxins from the water). We began the meal with crispy spinach vadai with coconut chutney, followed by pearl millet dosa with an assortment of gravy and paneer butter masala. The dosa finished too quickly so we ordered a set of two fluffy idly to wipe up the remaining gravy. Giddy from too much food, we finished the meal with a steaming cup of sweet, filtered coffee.
Exactly a week later we were back with our friends to try their carrot vadai, rava thosai, and several other items that we wolfed down too quickly.
The place is popular with both locals and tourists so you know this place is for keeps!"
