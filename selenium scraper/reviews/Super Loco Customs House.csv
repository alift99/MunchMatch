Calling it Mexican it‚Äôs an offence,"No even worth of a description but have to hit the 100 typo‚Ä¶..no burrito, quesadilla was a joke, Disgusting and expensive."
Good Mexican food with MBS view,"Dined here last night in a group of 8, Ms Joey personally saw to us and made sure our orders and everything was in order. Ms Joey is an asset to this restaurant Overall good food and lovely view."
Too much disappointment,Booked 3 weeks in advance and requested for outdoor seats for our birthday. We reached the place early and very disappointed to have been given a corner indoor and no-view seat. The food was so so and pricey. Asked the staff to help us get a proper outdoor seat but was told it was reserved 2 weeks back when I got a reservation a whole lot earlier. We planned to stay longer but only took us less than 20mins and left to such disappointment. There are a lot of place nearby thats not as expensive and has a better ambiance and view. Not coming back.
Mixed experience,"For a birthday celebration I booked 1+ weeks ahead of time for an alfresco table with a nice view. One day before arrival I had to confirm via sms, which I did. Once we arrived I was told the table I booked was not available because of something with the government reducing outdoor places. I mentioned why I was not informed of that earlier as I could have made different plans as the view was important to me. After some typing on the ipad the lady told me it was possible, but she also said that that if it were to rain, I would not get another outdoor seat. Before I sat down I was reminded for the 3rd time we only had 2 hrs. Not a great way to make your guests feel special before even sitting down. When I made the reservation I was asked if it was a special occasion, and yes, this was a birthday celebration. Not that it mattered, not even one person said happy birthday or showed any other gesture to the birthday girl we brought. The food was 8/10 and the outdoor service by the staff was really good, so kudos to them. There seemed to be some improvising taking place once it started to rain- so not sure if there is an SOP for that as that could not have been the 1st time. So overall, just OK, would not run back there any time soon, and definitely not for a celebration."
Rude attendant not surprised was sitting with empty tables all evening,"The attendant was too rude
He didn‚Äôt mind sitting with empty tables with his poor language
What a shame, the other staff who must be dealing with this"
Mediocre experience for Mexican Restaurant,"Food was pretty acceptable but not great for its price.However if you like cocktails better select a beer or wine as you will barely taste any alcool. When I asked our waitor which draft beer is lager he did not know and in the menu description it was not clear. Avoid jar of margaritas as it is only juice. Our waitor mentioned to us that the margaritas in the jar are ready and they cannot add alcool ti make it stronger and if we want we can buy shots. View is nice. There are better restaurants for mexican food and drinks in Singapore at the same or even lower prices.
Also although our booking was for outdoor for some weird reason they were trying to convince us to stay indoor saying that they had another bigger group than our group which was 4 people although they had free table outdoor covered in case of rain and that table was for 4people and in no way could accommodate more people.Finally table outdoor was provided. In the same area there are many restaurants to chose from.
Overall overpriced for what it offers."
Family dinner Super Loco Customs House,"The Waiters and Waitresses were all very helpful and attentive. Food is good. Love it. Those who drive, you can park at OUE Bayfront. Just come up to street level and Customs House is just right opposite."
Good Food Good Views,The food was amazing! The staff were really friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend the Lamb Baracoa and beef tacos.
Super Loco Customs House,"We came to Super Loco Customs House for my mother's birthday, and it exceeded our expectations. We ordered queso quesedilla, two beef quesedillas, super grain salad, wine, beer, mocktail and were surprised with free churros for dessert!"
"memorable dinner at superloco, great customer service from Ivy ‚ò∫Ô∏è","here to leave a word of thanks to Ivy for her amazing customer service. my family and I came to Superloco for a Birthday celebration. not only was all the food delicious (p.s. if you‚Äôre looking for Mexican style chicken wings, this may just be the best place), she was able to make the experience particularly memorable because of her friendly and outgoing nature. she was kind enough to lend me a sombrero hat to take photos with and even gave us free ice cream. I am truly grateful for her service and she definitely should be commended for it! and Ivy, if you‚Äôre seeing this, THANK YOU very much from the girl in the green flower dress whose outfit you complimented today ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è we had a great dinner!"
üíô,"As usual, food never disappoints! As a foodie, it‚Äôs really difficult not to over order cos everything looks and tastes amazing. Service is always so warm and I really applaud the team‚Äôs positively effortless try at striking conversations with patrons:) Bobby, Azfar and Angie are just splendidly wonderful"
Good view & good crowd,"This place is always full and hard to get a table so I was looking forward to try it out.
The view was awesome and I like the crowd.
Food comes out in a very good speed.
Drinks come out in a very good speed too.
Service was fine, I even remember a very friendly server and etc.

Prons.
I didn't like the drinks.
Food was okay.
I didn't get the point of why everyone are crazy about that place.
After waiting for quite a bit to get a table and I got something near the entrance.
I couldn't figure out why it all about.
It was an average experience for me and it abit rushing and pushing forward to make us leave in less than an hour duo to we were walk ins and the staff explain us that we have to leave if in short time.
It was quite abit if walk around the place for registration and check in so I got annoyed abit.
Maybe it's just me, I don't like to be rushed out

But yeah, the view and vibes were cool."
Happy chill nite!,"Spectacular view and super friendly service from Raihan, he is cheerful, friendly and attentive. Truly appreciate James‚Äô initiative to remove the lava cake with ice cream from the bill due to the imperfections bake but still turn out pretty yummy. We were be back soonüëç"
Terrible service!! Avoid this place,"The service is the worst I have see so far!
No one to welcome us at the entrance, we have been asked to seat where available (the restaurant was empty). After 2h hours seating and consuming, we have been asked to leave as other clients had a reservation. No one told us there was a reservation whilst serving us, nor there was a clear policy of limited time.
Very bad operations and process!"
Amazing food!,"Had chicken quesadilla, tacos(wagyu, pork belly, fish and octopus). The fish taco was amazing. It was my first time having a fish taco and I knew I had to order a second one. Taste and the crispiness of the fish were so good. Definitely recommend it! Octopus and wagyu beef tacos were delicious as well. Will visit Super Loco again for sure!"
Reservation,The food is ok. The view is brilliant however the reservation sucks. I emphasise the table that i want which is the alfresco table and with the best view which do not have blockage. But I love the staff they are all friendly and accommodating. I think if you just want to have a good view better not this one but for the food it would be ok.
Mexican vibe with exceptional service,Service and hospitality from Rose and James made our evening a memorable one! We will definitely be back. The food is incredible. Setting - one of a kind!
Great food great place,"Super loco was recommended to me by a friend. Food and ambience did not disappoint! Great service by the staff. Plus point, you get to have great ambience while enjoying the delicious tacos."
Excellent!,Thanks Raihan for the great service. All that you recommended was on point! Look forward to coming again and seeing you man!
"Great food, great service.","My first time there and definitely not the last. Great food, great service. great recommendations for the food. Staff are very friendly. An amazing place with a great view."
Excellent Service and great food!,"We asked the waitress to recommend some food, and it's really really awesome! Really excellent service, all the staff are super nice and friendly!"
Great ambiance,"Very hospitable and attentive. Great respect with customer especial mention to Jasmine üòä, very accomodating."
"Amazing service, even better food!","Amazing service by Jasmine, Irish, Ramses, Zul and Riki! Service was very genuine and heartfelt. My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and food was very filling and amazingüòö"
Worst service EVER,"Food‚Äôs very good. That‚Äôs not an issue.

But in all my life (and I‚Äôm in my 40s and I‚Äôve travelled A LOT), I have literally never experienced such awful service. Nothing like the location in Robertson Quay.

We came here to celebrate our birthdays, which are 3 days apart. We had a reservation. We were shown to our table promptly (incidentally without any Covid-19 safety protocols). We were given a menu. The server came to take our order and was helpful.

All good so far.

30 minutes later, we‚Äôre getting super hungry and thirsty. So we flag the server, ask him where our beers were (as in, were they roasting the hops or what ?).
He goes : you ordered beer ?
We go : Yes - remember ? Two Mayan lagers.
No apology, but another server brought us our beers a few minutes later.
15-20 minutes later, we‚Äôre thinking : where‚Äôs the food ?
Totally not exaggerating the delays here, folks.
So we flag down the first server we see cos ours is pretty much just hanging around.
He tells us there‚Äôs no record of a food order for our table.
Wow. Just wow.
So our server didn‚Äôt even submit our order.
So this guy takes our order.
By now it‚Äôs after 9.15 PM, and last order is at 9.30.
The manager comes over tells us our beers are on the house (yeah... cos that totally makes up for this debacle).
We receive our food close to 9.30 and that‚Äôs it. No one asks us if we want more drinks, dessert, coffee, tea, or even water.

AVOID."
Birthday celebration!,Jasmine was an amazing and lovely server. Look for jasmine or rose for good service! The good is really good! Highly recommend the lamb main and their dips are to die for!!! Great place for drinks and amazing view!
Awesome Evening!,"What started out as a frustrating eve, because of the rain which meant my outdoor reservation had to be cancelled, quickly turned wonderful with the attentive, friendly & helpful staff (esp Jewel!). The recommendations for food was excellent, service was quick & with a crew that engages the customers, what is there not to like?! Definitely 2 thumbs up and I‚Äôll be returning for sure!"
So good to find a great place in Singapore......finally!,"We went for dinner last month with a few friends and it was awesome. Food, drinks, service and atmosphere are great. We all really enjoyed and will be back again for sure. Well done!! It's nice to see a place in Singapore that doesn't have awful service!!"
Accommodating,Lovely ambiance. Ikram was very attentive during our visit and made sure we enjoyed the night which we did! Thanks for the great service.
¬°Excelente!,An amazing place with a great view and even greater service. Definitely a top choice for when you feel like Mexican. Bobby and Jermaine are so kind and patient to explain everything and ensure you have a wonderful time!
Fabulous Mexican feast!,"We dined here for a birthday with friends and were not disappointed! The location is perfect, fantastic views with a great vibe. The crowd was a mixture of friends, couples and families.

We were really impressed with our waiter Bobby, he made great recommendations and created a special experience when he learnt it was my husbands birthday (I forgot to mention at booking) Service can really make or ruin a dining experience and credit to Bobby as he was fantastic! Definitely stood out as one of the more friendly wait staff.

The food was consumed so fast I forgot to take photos, however highlight was the crispy fish taco and the BBQ corn for me personally.

We will most certainly be back!"
Birthday Dinner 14 Oct,"Nice place with a good view when u sit outside. Ordered the Nacho Chips with 3 dips. My fave is the pineapple which is the spiciest! Fried Chicken is not bad. Cerviche de mango is average. Didn‚Äôt like the coconut in it. The drink that I had was Passion Fruit Smashito, could only really taste the passion fruit as the vodka was very diluted. The same goes for sister‚Äôs drink. As for taco, we had the Barramundi & cauliflower, both were good! I liked the Quesadilla with Oyster Mushroom Fried potato is delish!
Wasn‚Äôt too happy with one of their service staff. When we asked to change our soiled side plates, he brought a stack to our table & sort of slammed it on the table & walked away immediately, without even asking if we wanted to clear those soiled ones. don‚Äôt work if u r unhappy! A great place to chill & have small plates to share or u could order your own mains too‚úå"
"Great waiter service, poor front of house","We had booked a table for 7.30 but arrived at 6.30 to have some drinks before dinner. There were 4 empty tables in the from outside so we asked if we could have our drinks at one of these. I asked if we could sit there for a few minutes to take in the view. We were told no. The waiter told us they were reserved and people were on their way. We were placed at a table further back. Our drinks and nachos came quickly. I again asked (a different waiter) if we could move just for a little while as there were still 4 empty tables. Again we were told no.

We sat for an hour having our drinks, watching 4 empty tables ‚òπÔ∏è A group from one of the front tables left and I asked if we could take that table. The answer was no, it was booked.

At 7.30 we had finished our drinks and ordered our food. The manager came to see us to say he was sorry we had been unable to move.

The food came quickly and Mr Rahul was a very attentive & friendly waiter.

Our experience could have been so much better had the staff managed to be flexible with empty tables and allow us to sit there just for a while."
Good place to chill,Love this place. Nice Mexican food and drinks are reasonable as well. I like the relaxing vibes here.miss this place.
wonderful smiley service and stunning views over marina bay,"perfect place for networking, relaxed, table service is smiley and quick and they do some great beers on draught at great happy hour prices with stunning views of Marina Bay"
A Singapore Oasis of Mexican Culinary and Cocktail Delights,"I visited the Robertson Quay and Customs House locations of Super Loco with business clients for Happy Hour drinks and was pleasantly surprised at the exceptional service of the bar tenders, whom I asked questions about the brand of liquors used to to make a Pisco Sour and Lime Margarita cocktails.

I asked Ms. Chun, Manager on Duty, to recommend a happy hour cocktail with accompanying snack, which included a lime margarita and corn chips served with roja salsa, which was a delicious and enticing combination. There are other types of salsa available, which I encourage visitors to try.

I also asked Bartender Sham to show me the Arquitecto Tequila which is made from high-altitude grown agave, and the Blanco Tequila of choice for the exceptional lime margaritas served at Super Loco.

Most impressive to me, was Bartender's suggestion that I first order and taste the Arquitecto Tequila, serve with a slice of fresh orange, sprinkled with Tajin spice.

This gesture of exceptional customer experience, is to be commended and I encourage tequila aficionados to enjoy this unique experience.

I also visited Super Loco - Robertson Quay on a Sunday to enjoy their delicious juevos rancheros, which is a perfect selection for Sunday brunch and one of the best in Singapore.

Ms. Henrietta, Manager on Duty at Robertson Quay, was exceptionally helpful with cocktail recommendations."
"Great meal and atmosphere, but pricey for what you get","Very good food, and atmosphere but found it very pricey for what you get. The service was also not the best."
yummy tacos!,Good food and good service. Love the tacos it will really satisfy your cravings for good Mexican food. Good view overlooking marina Bay sands. Good place to eat after a stroll around the bay.
Always delicious,"The staff are always very accommodating. On this trip I turned up slightly early with a baby and despite not being open yet one of the lovely hostesses Lindy, looked after us in a very friendly manner by welcoming us in and arranging a table for us.

Smashable tsp beers and the selection of dips with chips is always a winner. Super flavor-some and they nail it with the perfect amount of chilli...

Jermaine our waiter was perfectly attentive and the bartenders have obviously made a lot of margaritas before as they came out smoothly and were delicious!

The menu is varied and has a great selection of true Mexican classics with tasty vegetarian options and a nod to their sustainable ethos!

They have a solid selection of agave spirits with a good range of tequila, some cracking Mezcal and a couple of Raicilla to boot!

A lovely way to spend the afternoon."
Good food let down by the service,"The food was nice and we enjoyed the sangria but it was let down by the service. After we received our main courses we were ignored for the rest of the evening. We were never asked if we enjoyed the food or if we wanted more drinks, dessert etc. We were considering both and would certainly have ordered more if we were asked. It was also quite tricky to get someones attention to pay the bill and it felt like they weren't particularly interested in us."
Fabulous and delicious menu,"We arrived for evening dinner in torrential rain which was a shame as the location at Customs House is perfect with great views to MBS and there is lovely outside seating.
Excellent menu with appetisers, main course Tacos and Enchiladas and great cocktail choices.
Very friendly and helpful staff and a member of staff even helped with the taxi walking us round to where it would collect us, so helpful particularly as we had only just arrived in Singapore and although we have visited the city a number of times over the years we were not familiar with Collyer Quay.
Would not hesitate to recommend this casual Mexican restaurant."
NYE Countdown Evening,Wow What a fab evening here for the NYE Countdown. The view for the fireworks and the harbour was first class. A great vibe with very good service. The food was canap√©s and tasting dishes and it was devine as well has some cool spots such as the Taco Truck and MYO margaritas. Overall loved our evening here. Definitely recommend it.
NYE Countdown,"Indeed a great place to celebrate New Years Eve. Spectacular view of the fireworks, good food, and unlimited drinks. Also professional staffs (Lindy & Iris) who assists us all through out and make us comfortable & bartenders who make good drinks. Will definitely recommend to my friends. :)"
Amazing NYE event,"Outstanding Service and great food.

My girlfriend and I booked the standing package for new years eve. We had a fantastic view on the Marina Bay Sands. The place was full although it was not uncomfortably packed.

The reservation was smooth and we had all the necessary info to reach the venue considering the road closures.

The staff was professional and took very well care of the guests till the very end of the evening.

Food and drinks were good and never had to wait for anything. There was a wide range of canapes and in good quantity.

We would definitely recommend this restaurant for any occasion.

Thanks Super Loco!"
More than tacos,"The first look at the menu tells that thre is much much more here than tacos. The menu is broad in selection, but also consistent within its style. Very stylistic and much to my surprise the drinks are very reasonably priced. Mu only criticism goes to the fact that almost all items in the menu are based on chili+coriander+lime spice mixtures, so if you are not a fan of therese, you might not have options. The presentaion of the foods was near perfect despite some visible hastiness."
Monday magaritas,"Made a reservation for 9 and was confirmed very promptly. We requested for a outdoor table. Beautiful night with view of mbs.

Magaritas are great and cheaper by the glass due to the promo. There is happy hour for drafts and wine but between 5 to 7.

Nachos and dips were fresh. Food was decent and tasted delicious. We ordered a variety of items to share.

Servers were attentive.Nura was our server but they were all able to assist.

Great place for a night out with friends and family.

I have passed the other branch at Robertson Quay. And that has the river view. Ambience is slightly different but same food.

Overall had a pleasant night."
Mexican,Amazing food and great friendly staff service. Highly recommend visiting super loco when in Singapore.
We had an amazing dinner at Super Loco. The staff are so accommodating and friendly. Even if it was a busy night. Linde welcome,"We had an amazing dinner at Super Loco. The staff are so accommodating and friendly. Even if it was a busy night. Linde welcome us with her lovely smile. Irish recommended some food and drinks that can be shared. She even ask us if we have allergies, its quite rare for any restaurant to ask that. Had the smokey ron and res quessadilla. Nages serve the food and telling the name of the dish. Rodel was amazing as well, he do check on us if hows our dining experience and did a dessert recommendation as well. Thats superb. Credit to all the chefs on duty. Sumptuous and mouth watering. We will defitenily coming back. You ROCK SUPER LOCO CUSTOMS HOUSE.!!!!! KEEP THE BURNING SPIRIT ALIVE.!"
Excellenct service by IRish and Rodel,"As soon as i reach the place i was welcome by Irish and seated at my table. Rodel assisted in the service operations. Irish came in to handover the menu and introduce the specials and made a great recommendations.
Will be back again, coz i love the hospitality I've received from both of them and made my night memorable.
The gem of super loco, great hospitality and service from them."
Nice view,Celebrated one of our friends birthday and the view is magnificent. The food is average but the view made up for it. They also surprised by friend with the loud birthday song. Kudos to them !
Romantic ambience with delicious food,Ordered the tacos and quesadillas it was so deliciously that I did not have any conversation with my gf as we are enjoying our food. The service was above expectation. The drinks were so refreshing and pls choose the outdoor seating to enjoy the most spectacular view around that CBD area.
"nice vibes, nice cocktails",It is a very nice place to sit outside with gorgeous view on Marina Bay. It has good drinks and cocktails (frozen Margarita is excellent) and also food platters as well if you are a little hungry.
Birthday Blast with Friendsü§©,"It was our first time to visit Super Loco and we were impressed with the view.We loved the place,very cozy and overlooking Marina Bay.Most importantly,the staff are amiable esp Irish who also surprised us with a lava cake for this special occasionWe totally enjoyed our dining experience.

Sharing a photo of the lava cake to remind myself to visit and celebrate my birthday here next time‚ù§"
Great place to eat!,"I loved this restaurant! A great location overlooking the Marina Bay, we had a table outside and the breeze was perfect! The waiters were superb, attentive and fun. The food hugely delivered on taste and presentation. The fish tacos were melt in the mouth, the mango ceviche was a brilliant fusion of flavours that woke up the taste buds hugely! We also had the cauliflower taco and the Baja taco, both of which were flavoursome & nicely balanced. The puds were sublime, torta de choc gave you a melt in the middle chocolate torte spilling onto the passionfruit ice-cream..my mouth is watering just thinking about it! The avocado and chocolate mousse was silky smooth and had great depth of flavour.
Everything was demolished in record time!
if you come to Singapore book this in advance so you get an outside table and sit back and enjoy a perfect, relaxed food experience!"
Exceptional Service,Had a fun dinner with my colleagues last weekend. the food was great. good recommendation of Irish for sharing portions. and we love the chicken quesadillas. prompt service. we will come back again.
dinner with a view,"We went there to have a birthday dinner for 2 of our friends. It was a memorable experience. The food was excellent, especially the roasted pork belly and salmon main dishes. The staff were attentive and even remembered the allergies of a friend of ours. Keep it up!"
The location is not enough,"We went there hoping to have a nice Mexican snack and a good margarita. It was disappointing. The margarita was everything but a margarita. The snack we ordered sounded nice but was a few pieces of boiled corn with mayonnaise on top!

As this was disappointing and also not enough we tried to order something else ! They told us that the restaurant was closing earlier and refused to serve us .

We did not care about the price because it is a prime spot in Singapore. However there must be some quality in food and service to earn it .

The location is not enough."
Pick for my birthday dinner,"Mainly picked this restaurant for a birthday dinner with friends because of the amazing views you get here. We were lucky enough to get a table outside so we really had an unobstructed view of Singapore. The weather was also pretty decent, a cool breeze in the evening and not too humid.

We started off with chips and dips to share, which were great. This is always a crowd pleaser. Then we opted to share a few dishes split into vegetarian and non vegetarian. For us vegetarians, we went for the steak, mushroom and cheese quesadilla, and grilled corn with cheese as a side. All were delicious except the steak. We all found it to have a weird texture, not typical for a medium rare steak. The service was good, as food came out pretty quickly after ordering and our waiter had the most patience with us when it came to settling the bill and splitting it various ways.

A great place to come for a drink as well. It's chill and has unbeatable views!"
Jet lag pick up,"Suffering jet lag trying not to give in and go to bed. We are are fans of the restaurants round Collyer Quay each time we stop off in Singapore. Loco is a new one for us. My starter a blood orange and agave margarita yes! The four dips to start heaven, salad Mexican rice chicken tortilla and another margarita, delicious and service with a smile. And yes a nap was next!"
Amazing!,"We arrived midweek without a booking not realizing what a popular venue this was.
We were lucky enough to get a table almost immediately. The staff were terrific and service was fast.
The chefs catered to our requests and the food was out very quickly.
The tacos were incredible and definitely one of our favorite meals of the trip.
The view and atmosphere were also great!"
Excellent food and great view!,"The food is excellent and their staff is amazing! You can tell that they enjoy their job.

This is real Mexican food, with every single flavour and ingredient.

Their tortillas are made with corn and their Fish Tacos are a must.

The view is nice. Definitely not the last time."
"AMAZING HOSPITALITY, FOOD AND VIEW","First and foremost I am so apologetic that this review came so late.

I had the pleasure of dining here on the night of 26th June 2019 with a partner.

I came about half an hour earlier than my planned meeting time of 8pm, hoping to get a good seat, and the moment I stepped into the alfresco area I was warmly greeted by Mr Rodel, the outlet manager. He patiently explained that it would be difficult to get a table of my choice considering how packed the eatery was, and ushered me to a table for two so I could wait in the meantime.

With time to kill, I decided I should ask for his recommendations first so I could make my order without further ado after my partner arrived.

Rodel asked if it was my first time dining here and I said yes.

He suggested Totopos (Corn chips) as a starter, with guacamole salsa as a dip. This was served tout de suite and turned out to be a spot-on recommendation as my partner and I could snack on this while waiting for other dishes.

Next, he highlighted ‚ÄúDe Pescado‚Äù (Grilled snapper) and ‚ÄúDe Conchinita Pibil‚Äù (Pulled pork shoulder), both variations of their tacos which are their house specialty. I was skeptical as to why he did not recommend ‚ÄúDe Baja‚Äù which seemed a popular choice when I did my research online. However, I took my words back when the food came as they were arguably the best tacos I have had in Singapore.

We ended off our meal (or so I thought) with the ‚ÄúPollo‚Äù quesadilla which contained spiced roasted chicken. All this while dining under the stars and the lights of the Central Business District towering above us, with Marina Bay Sands directly across the bay. Every need and request was swiftly attended to by their lovely and attentive staff, e.g clearing of plates and refilling iced water, all with a smile on their face.

As we finished our meal, a rookie waiter brought over 2 scoops of ice cream (one was a very rich chocolate, the other was a refreshing fruit sorbet) to our table and I remarked that we did not order any dessert, to his bewilderment. He said he would check and brought the ice cream back into the indoor dining area where I assumed he would double-check if he had sent the dessert to the correct table with a senior member of the staff.

I was prepared to ask for the bill when our dear Rodel came back out with the dessert and said that it was actually meant for us, explaining that it was on-the-house and a gesture from them as it was my first time dining there. I was so touched and amazed that he paid attention to detail, remembering that it was my first time dining with them.

All-in-all, my partner and I agreed that this easily ranked among the best, if not the best, dining experiences we‚Äôve had in Singapore, no exaggeration. Great food is one thing but to receive such warm and of course, genuine hospitality was the game changer. Last but not least, the ambience and the view was perfect and icing on the cake, be it for couples, friends to chill with tacos and beer after work, or even families on a weekend when there isn‚Äôt so much of an after-work crowd.

We would like to extend our gratitude and regards to Rodel in particular, this man was born for the service and hospitality industry. I am very sure that I will be back at Super Loco extremely soon, not just for the food, not just for the view, but for him and his staff as well. Thank you!"
Brilliant evening,"We found Super Loco while strolling around. We did not feel like a big meal and the idea of tasting plates appealed. The staff were super friendly. Super helpful. Food was super tasty.
A jug of lime margarita and a fireworks show made this a special night. Highly recommended this place."
"Great location, Super vibe",Best place to hangout with friends colleagues Friendly staff great food superb location It‚Äôs a must if one is in cbd area
Super service staff!,"Had a great time at the Customs House outlet on 6 Jun 2019 - Ama, who served our table, was quick on her feet, cheerful and smiled all the time. Other staff were very helpful too - even offering my friend (who has a bad back) a cushion.

We were happy with all the four dishes we chose - corn chips with guacamole, Tacos de Pollo Y Poblano, Quesadillas Pollo and a very special mention for the awesome Cerviche de Mango, which came zesty and refreshing with hints of mint and coconut. The chocolate lava cake with a side of passion fruit ice cream should be a compulsory end to every meal at Super Loco - it's one of those worth breaking your diet for!

Will be returning very soon, with more people in tow - thank you, Super Loco!"
Good food,"Came here for a mini-reunion with a few friends who had relocated post-university. As a previous reviewer has commented, service was slow but when offered was courteous. The food was worth the wait however - the quesadillas were gorgeous.

Portion sizes differ by quite a bit - some plates contained a single piece of food while others had 3-4 pieces so it might be best to check with staff when ordering.Ask in terms of pieces though - one serving staff indicated serving size by the plate size, and we ended up staring bemusedly at several single-serve plates of food before wisening up."
Super indeed!,"We have been coming to the Super Loco group restaurants since they first opened and love them all for their own reasons.

We‚Äôve just had visitors in town for the weekend, who are young, vegetarian and fun. We chose Super Loco Customs House because of the fun vibe, good food and the beautiful setting. We got an outside table as requested, and needless to say our guests were impressed. The staff were all super friendly and efficient... and of course the food was yummy.

Thank you, we will be back for sure!"
Great affordable place,I think the prices are so reasonable for the location. Marina bay sands can be seen with an amazing view from both in and outside the restaurant. Amazing view! Food is so tasty too probably my favourite meal of my holiday and by far the best value. We spent more on tea the night before in a totally average - slightly poor cafe! The tacos are great and you can mix match to try different ones. The snapper taco is epic! Great drinks selection and really warm friendly staff. Gluten free coded menu and plenty choice too which I have struggled to find much of in Singapore so was really great to see.
Great vibe,"Love it here come everytime I'm in the area, great vibe, great view. Food a d service excellent too."
Brunch!,"We had a great Mexican brunch here. All of the food was delicious, and it was in a great location. Fun ambience. The service was a bit slow, but the food was worth it."
Better and better,"My wife and I frequent Singapore and, like most American expats we crave good Mexican food. Superloco is the place in Singapore to satisfy this craving. The food is outstanding and the salsas are amazing. And no good Mexican restaurant can be called good unless the Margaritas are good. This place has Jazz. He makes the best margaritas on the planet. And for an even better drink describe what type of flavors you like and he will pick an amazing tequila to match your taste. He is the best. Rau is an amazing server and took such good care f us. Every time we come we feel like they know us and really want us there. It‚Äôs very obvious these people love working at Superloco and love helping people have a great meal and a great time. So, amazing food, wonderful drinks and great people already make a great restaurant but add in the location and it‚Äôs a place you must see. Well done team. And please ask them to add pork belly to the taco menu choices!"
Flight 505 to Oaxaca,"Came across this busy place after watching the light show. We were informed there was a 1 hour wait for table but were offered a seat at the bar. That usually does not bode well. But the bar staff were great, the tacos arrived quickly and I really enjoyed the Mezcal. The complimentary passion fruit tequila was a nice touch too. Food was good and arrived quickly and the price was reasonable, especially for the drinks. Thanks for looking after the tourists"
"Good view, great food, friendly staff","I always liked the customs house, it is like classy and quiet area. Wanted to try the Kinki Japanese restaurant upstairs but felt that the price was quite high and no Happy Hour. Super Loco is located on level one with unblocked view of Marina Bay area. The best part is the food is reasonably priced and portions just nice. Staff were friendly , even though I had no reservation, they did not reject us and gave us a first seating option. Food wise is really nice mexican stuff with wraps and salads all fresh and tasty. I really love the magaritas going only $11 at Happy hour price( I think its 5pm-7pm). Will definitely be back! Keep up the good work!"
"Good location, good food",This restaurant was in a fantastic location on the bay. Service was excellent and the food was very good. Portions were not generous but sufficient and the quality was very good. The price of the food was on the higher end but the location would drive this. I assume all restaurants in this location would be similarly priced.
Not sure what all the fuss is about,"We had dinner here yesterday and we were really underwhelmed. We each had 1 taco - the pork was incredibly dry and there was no apple, and the chicken was also extremely dry and had no chilli like the menu said. They were also cold when we got them. The dips and corn chips were ok.
The service was friendly, but basically non-existent - no one checked on us or asked how our meal was at any stage of the night."
OMG,"So after nine days in Singapore why oh why did I only find this place on my last night???
I‚Äôm celiac and have had a hard time finding food I‚Äôm able to eat in Singapore.
The service was impeccable, the margaritas superb and the food, well what can I say, but wish I had more nights here to come back for more.
The view was amazing, looking over to the marina bay sands light show.
Just can‚Äôt fault anything with this place."
Good food and ambience! :),Very customer oriented place with good food and ambience for customers of big or small groups. Excellent view - enjoyed the experience.
"great food, great views, great service!","Hosted an 18th birthday party there. the staff were extremely helpful and accommodating, and made the night really special. The food was delicious, and we were provided with a bunch of fun props (sombrero, stick-on moustache etc) that added a fun element. The ambience was fantastic and the views were unparalleled. Would 100% recommend"
Super Loco,"Went there for a farewell dinner for a friend, it‚Äôs unfortunate that it was raining and they could only sit us outside, however the hostess realised there was 10 of us and moved us in. Thank you.

Food was excellent, were all fans of trying new things and we were blown away by the delicious meals and beverages. The staff was excellent and Jenny stood out and ensured we were well taken care off. Thank you so much for providing us with the super service.

I know it‚Äôs not easy to handle a big group of people but she did an excellent job. Their happy hours - $11 for housepours are a serious value. Tacos and Quesadillas are amazing!

We will definitely return!"
Great location,"Beautiful spot opposite the Marina Bay Sands.
The passionfruit mojito was delicious. Chips and dips were good, salad and black beans also tasty.
Cauliflower taco had a horrible flavour, inedible. Was refunded and staff very pleasant.
More vegetarian options please!!"
"Great Service, Awesome Food, Mindblowing Ambience!!",Was there for a work dinner and loved every minute of it! They spoilt us with great hospitality :-).... every one should give it a try while in SG
Stack of items,"Although it was windy, we tried quite a few dishes from the menu. I was quiet surprised by the different Mexican taste at SuperLoco. Really good atmosphere and prompt service"
"Singapore: ""You've Come a Long Way Bambino""","I love Mexican food. I crave Mexican food when I'm away from California, rush to get some when I come back from a trip and am even willing to give it a try when I'm abroad.

About 20 years ago, while in Singapore, the urge (more the curiosity) hit me and gave the lone Mexican outpost a try. Mistake, terrible, got what I deserved.

So, when my colleagues suggested Super Loco for an after work outing, I was hesitant but certainly intrigued. Bottom line: Super Loco is authentic, high-quality and genuinely good.

The location is awesome, overlooking Marina Bay -- and the availability of so much outdoor seating is a plus. We had a decent size group, so we essentially picked much of the menu to share. Beginning with the margaritas (a bit too sweet), to the guacamole, to each of the appetizers (ceviche, quesadillas) to the larger shared plates of lamb tacos and enchiladas -- every single thing we ordered was fresh, well spiced and as authentic as you would expect to find in the better Mexican restaurants in the United States and Mexico.

Singapore has so many options and so much to offer -- so if you have limited time in the country, you'd be better off with a more regional choice. But if the craving hits you, fear not. Super Loco is real, it's excellent and you won't regret your decision."
"Great location, fresh food","Great fresh food that leaves you feeling light! Love the corn, fish tacos and the quinoa/barley salad. The red sangria is an absolute must try. Coconut mojito is also nice.
The location just takes the cake - the light show never gets old..."
"Great view, classic Mexican food, cool atmosphere","We went there for a after work drinks and dinner. We had so much fun. The view is fantastic, the food is well served and of good quality. The staff creates a party atmosphere. Highly recommended for a light hearted colleagues or friends night."
Good ambiance,"Good food, loved the Sangria. But over all a bit over priced. Loved the outdoor seating and the view is beautiful."
Nice view food is fine but expensive,"The location is right on marina bay behind the big water fountain show. It is a fun place to sit, food is quite tasty but portions and costs are mismatched. Drinks are even more costly, so don‚Äôt party there."
"Good location, quality food, great service","One of our fave Mexican restos to go to is Super Loco Customs House. There is another outlet in Robertson Quay but if you‚Äôre looking for a good view of Marina Bay Sands and the adjoining structures, Customs House is the place to be. There is options for indoor and outdoor seating. It‚Äôs a small resto so don‚Äôt forget to make reservations, especially for evening meals. The menu options include vegetarian and gluten-free items.

We simply love the Elotes, which is barbecued corn, chipotle mayo, cotija cheese, and lime. We also had the Cordero Al Horno which is slow roast lamb, ancho & sherry marinade, chargrilled cos, pistachio salsa verde, and tortillas.

Tacos, quesadillas and other menu items all have the same fresh, zesty taste. A bit on the pricey side, but worth every penny!"
Nice Mexican food with Fantastic View of Marina Bay Sands,"If you are looking for a restaurant with unblock view of Marina Bay Sands, this is the place to go. It‚Äôs a small restaurant so must make reservation. Outdoor seats will be closed if it rain. Food is great and reasonable price."
Perfect spot,Probably one of the best spots! Great to see the fireworks. Food is really nice and quite some choice. Even for kids quite some different dishes to choose from.
Serendipity,"After walking the whole length around the marina from the Sands to One Fullerton Place and not finding grub that appealed to us, we sat outdoors of this Mexican restaurant and rested our tired feet.

We opted for the chorizo and beef soft taco and some refreshing drinks.

Great location, very nice servers, awesome laid back atmosphere for a lazy Thursday afternoon."
Great happy hour spot with views!,"If ambiance is your thing, come here for happy hour and sit out on the patio overlooking marina bay sands. Nothing better than watching the sky light up at sunset with a margarita in hand. Happy hour deals on pitchers and fairly good quality Mexican while in Asia."
"Great Mexican influences food, nice mojito","We had the pork and the brisket subs which were great. Best service we had in Singapore, good staff. Good cocktail list and nice spot on the water."
"Awesome Experience, Super Delicious Food","Awesome place for couples. Nice ambience, awesome view of Marina Bay. Super delicious food. Friendly staff, i remembered bartender named,Khai, he recommended us few choices of food and all the food was delicious and also he made cocktails for us. Cocktails were amazing. Husband and i had a wonderful time together. We enjoyed the food, view, ambience. Overall was a awesome experience"
Business Dinner,It is just across Marina Bay. Awesome breeze ! Beautiful and colorful view. Staff was amazing- Veg items were many. Must visit .
Excellent Mexican Restaurant,"Had a brilliant night at Super Loco, great vibe. Waitress suggested we choose the ‚Äúhead honcho‚Äù 7 course meal which was delicious. Essentially a couple of starters, a couple of mains and a dessert. At $60 Singapore dollars great value, along with the celicious cocktails and great friendly wait staff brilliant night."
Great Spot,Came here to waste some time before flying out. Didn't have a reservation but the staff found us a spot. Good variety of beers and some very good cocktails. We decided to snack on the various tacos which were delicious. Staff were attentive and friendly. Great spot to chill out and watch the sun set over the marina. Recommended.
Great atmosphere!,"You guys absolutely rocked the National Day Celebrations yesterday with the unlimited cocktails and beers, food, live music and excellent service all helped in creating a lively energetic atmosphere with panoramic views of the bay and fireworks. We will be back for more!"
"Tidy, Tasty, Tiny, Try","Nice chill Mexican on the riverfront. The food was fresh and feshly prepared. Service was super friendly and attentive.

A bit more on the authentic side than Tex-Mex or American-Mexican. That is ok and nice change.

Drinks are pricy but the alcohol content is more than fair. Great value.

Food is quite small portions but not outside of Singapore prices. I think fair and reasonable.

Just come in for a relaxed atmosphere, great staff, nice atmosphere, fresh food and local value and you shootings leave happy.

I am happy to return...."
Very nice ambiance with good food,"It's a great experience having dinner sitting on river side watching Singapore skyline.
This place have a good variety of cocktails less options for vegetarians but they have a good enchilada which was tasty. They have a pattern of serving small portions so that people can try multiple things. This goes with many folks but few may not like this.

Baja fish Taco is good pick for Non vegetarians. Overall I would say yes it's a very nice place with a good price. Yes sometimes felt bit pricey but when you like the food it's worth paying for that.

The dessert we tried Freshly backed lava cake and I really liked that."
Good ambience and food but pricy and tiny portions,The ambience is really good (overlooking marina bay) and the music is upbeat. Margaritas are good and happy hour prices are reasonable. We had the veg enchiladas to share ($26) which was very fresh and flavorful but overpriced for the portion size (see photo). Overall a nice after work or date place in the cbd with good but overpriced food.
