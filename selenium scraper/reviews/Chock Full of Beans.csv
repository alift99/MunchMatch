Food and service was good!,"The reviews are correct. The food was tasty and the service was efficient. Coffee was good as well. The cafe was cozy and family friendly. The only negative thing is there are no toilets inside the premises. Over-all, we had a great brunch after our hike in Pulau Ubin."
Really good portobello Benedict.,Really good portobello Benedict. Good bread but with mushrooms. Nice lunch before trip to Palau Ubin
Great time,Pasta was delicious and I like coffee 3D is very cute. Excellent service staff very friendly. We will come back again!!! ;)
Cute 3D Latte Art,"Came here cos we're around Changi area, hanging around before heading to Pulau Ubin. You've got to mention to the staff that you'd like a 3D foam art (if not they'd assume you won't) and it's applicable only to ice lattes. Rather pricey for the drink but you've got to give it for the barrista's craftsmanship. Hot latte also came in a flat 2D cute design. There's free Wi-Fi available too. Overall, a good cafe experience."
Really good meal,Looking at the row of restaurants/cafes in Changi village we were spoilt for choice. However we came across Chock Full of Beans and thought we would give it a try. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The food was really good and tasty. We finished with a lovely cup of coffee. Would return.
This cafe was just a couple,This cafe was just a couple of minutes walk from our hotel and what a find! We went for a coffee but having watched some people eating lunch we decided to go back for dinner. We were not disappointed. We had two courses plus wine for $89. The food was simple but well cooked and very good. The service was friendly and quick. If you are in Changi Village it is worth a visit.
Nice coffee,Stop over at this cafe if you are in Changi area. We went there on the way to Pulau ubin. The food is very good and the environment is relaxing. Loved it
Nice little cafe,"We wanted a good cup of coffee with an early snack for lunch and that’s what we received. Very good coffee and the bacon and mango on Turkish was delicious. Friendly, efficient service and a pleasant location. Definitely worth visiting!"
Most famous cafe in this small beach town,"Small cafe with maybe about 10 tables both inside and out. Famous for its 3D foam art with numerous cut characters floating on your coffee. Be prepared to wait quite a while (~20 minutes) for a table, and your coffee especially during weekends. Free flow of iced water to help tolerate the hot Singaporean weather. Food at this really small cafe was surprisingly good - especially the hearty breakfast sets with juicy sausages or the always-satisfying rosti. Breads were good and fresh too, probably because they also run the bakery nearby at the adjoining block. Wanted a non-caffeinated option but a little underwhelmed with their rather forgettable S$8 bottled Chai Latte. Coffees with the cute 3D art it is, next time."
Cosy cafe with cute 3D art coffee,"Whenever visiting Changi Village, be it a weekend staycation at Village Hotel Changi or deliberate trips made, we will definitely spend our lazy afternoon chilling out at this little cosy cafe, enjoying nice coffee with cute 3D art and delicious cheesecakes. Feel very relaxed under the cafe’s laid back ambience. Would definitely visit again."
Small and creative coffee,"This place is in a sleepy beach town and has some the best cappuccino I've tasted anywhere in the world. The place might have 7 tables and offers a light menu that looked good but I was just there for the coffee. I went because other reviews had mentioned a 3-D cappuccino. It turns out that this is only available with flavored coffee, so I settled for a regular black cappuccino. What a surprise! It came out with a drawing of a bear face on the top in 3 colors. It made me smile, all the way through my jet lag. Great coffee, soft music, I read there for an hour and ordered a second cappuccino that came out with a cat face on top. Nice people, easy to get to from the beach or main drag."
Not a pet friendly cafe,Claim to be a pet friendly cafe but isn’t. If you do not welcome pets then please put a sign instead of having owner make their orders before telling us that no pets allowed!!!
great coffee,having spent 8 weeks in europe what a delight to have two cups of Australian flat white made very well.
Great customer service,"Had late lunch there on a Monday.

Although it was past the usual lunch hour the place was having a good crowd with most indoor tables occupied and numerous outdoor tables filled.

Service staff managed to get us a table pretty fast. Set lunch menu was extensive and reasonable. We ordered from the set lunch menu and also from the a la carte as well. Portions were generous and food served was very fresh. Saw many patrons enjoying their beverages which come with impressive latte art.

Staffs were hardworking and attentive with very positive attitude and hospitality. They know the menu well and were able to make good recommendations. Midway through our meal, one of them offered us another spoon without us asking when he saw us trying to share a bowl of the carrot soup.

This may be a small joint in a quiet part of Changi Village but it scores big on delighting the customers."
Sunday coffee aroma 😮,"Wake up your Sunday to a great cuppa coffee at CFOB n a mouth fulfilling decadent lava cake with ice cream.

Just look at my photo a failure of restraint . Eaten a mouthful before able to take the pic.

N look at the cutey marshmallows

Sunday’s a new day with CFOB"
3 D art was a nice touch,"Changi Village can be such a fun place to hang out. A little laid back and nice weekend hang out. Tried this café, not too bad. The 3 D art on the coffee were fun for the kids and the assorted platter were a good choice for sharing, especially when the kids are a little picky and not willing to finish their meal!"
Great for coffee and a chat,"Working in nearby Loyang Industrial Park, this has always been a good place for a good strong coffee and chats or discussions over some thai style chicken wings ..."
Great Western Style Brunch,"So glad we found this little cafe. Although I love the food in Singapore, I struggled to find a western style breakfast other than the expensive hotel one. This fit the bill. Although open more for brunch the menu choices were great. Cute latte art worth seeing. $38.50 fed 2 of us large meals and coffees. Highly recommend if looking for western style breakfast/brunch"
Awesome 3D art,"Went there for lunch and managed to get a seat outside.

Hubby ordered a hazelnut latte with 3D art which was the highlight of our lunch as it was so cute. Was a heartbreak to see it ‘drowning’ as the drink was consumed.

The grilled chicken sandwich came with a lightly toasted multi grain bread which is my favorite. Hubby had the banana pancakes which had bits of walnut and it was just as tasty.

Overall a great lunch and will definitely be back."
cute latte art,"I am not one that appreciates coffee, much less the art of it. But I ignored all that just to get my hands on the ultra cute latte arts that came with lattes here. While I don't know how good the coffee tasted (they all don't taste appetising to me and I really only like to taste the milk in the latte) but the art was really really cute! The first time I went I was treated to a Garfield and the next time it was Hello Kitty. Apart from drinks and desserts, they do have normal brunch, lunch and dinner menus. I had one of the lunch promotion (?) meals and I must say it was quite delicious, worth the money!"
Delicious and no crowd,"Usually when we passed by this Chock of Full Beans restaurant, it was always crowded. And perhaps it was weekends, thus make a reservation through Chope. We got a good seating indoor.
As we ordered and waited for our food to be served, I was worried how good the dinner would be when there were no other people except us.

The worry was lifted after the food served and we had a taste of the dishes. Each of them were delicious.

Pictures speak more words.

While this place is remote but if you are on the way to Changi Airport, do drop by and give this place a try."
VG Flat White!,"Stopped-in for a much needed flat white (27 hours in transit...). Sat outside and was given a menu. It was 9:30am, and I had a look. They have a very expansive brekkie menu. Though I did not order any food, I looked at other tables and it looked very good and generous. I ordered a Flat White coffee not expecting too much. Actually, it was very good, so I ordered another. The prices are very reasonable for SG. A small flat white is $5. That’s what I pay in Canada. There were several tables outside and it drew many families, even with very young children. I highly recommend this place."
Cold Brew Rose Latte - a must try!,"Came here with two friends for a laid-back Sunday brunch. We ordered the Eggs Benedict, and the Guacamole & Poached Eggs Toast (only available on weekends and public holidays). The Guacamole blended well with the poached eggs and feta cheese, and really left us craving for more.

But the star of the morning was the Cold Brew Rose Latte. Smooth, refreshing, with a subtle hint of rose flavour that doesn’t overwhelm your palate - allowing you to savour the rest of your meal without distraction. This drink is subject to availability, so come early to indulge properly!"
Best coffee shop in Changi,"Chock Full of Beans is the best coffee shop in Changi village, with delicious cappuccinos and a nice selection of home made desserts. Very friendly service!"
Bikers hang-out at checkpoint Charlie,"A good chillout place when u r in Changi Village, if u dun want to be in the famed but hot & humid hawker centre.
This corner cafe is a fave hang-out for bikers (not your Harley D groupies...)
Espresso is OK but din really hit the spot, and the breakfast menu is pretty extensive.
Staff are smiley & prompt & food prices are friendly
If you have 30min to spare, try their 3D latte. makes for Kodak moments..."
Good coffee but not enough seats,Coffee and the coffee art were really good but the only problem is that there isn't much seats available. Could improve on the seats.
Best brekkie stop during a bike ride,"This is our to-go place when we do a long bike ride starting at east coast park. They understand how to make a good coffee and the breakfast they serve has never disappointed us. Nice staff, good choice of drinks and food. You don’t need more."
3D latte art,"We visited the cafe for lunch and my girlfriend was very keen to see the 3D latte art. I only went for a long black and a pasta, which both were nice. Perhaps for what I ordered, the price was a little steep, but if you come specifically for the 3D thing then, I guess it is all worth it. Have to say, their cakes looked delicious but we were already quite full at that point."
Disappointed with the coffee,"We came here for desserts and coffee but surprisingly, the coffee was not good. Maybe will try their breakfast or food menu next time."
Very good place for all day lunch,"The coffee is very good - the milk is for reason, extremely smooth. On weekends, you basically have a all-day breakfast menu. We had the trio sausage & eggs and the French toast with banana & chocolate. Both of which are recommended."
Pasta & Dessert,Ordered different pastas. Taste good and the portion is just right. Also had their cheese cake and chocolate cake for dessert. Taste yummy too.
Overall is okay.,"We couldn't choose for the coffee art. It was quite disappointed. Maybe for the complicated design, reservation is needed. But we didn't being told so. The service is nice anyway."
Best sausage!,"Best sausage l have ever eaten in Asia! Service is nice and friendly, all food were just perfect. Those small things like a perfect toast. They were our of stock for Stella Artois.."
Great food and ambience but service needs a face lift,"We went back to Chock Full of Beans after the hype of the coffee art for the iced coffee drinks. We ordered a prawn salad, blueberry bagel, eggs benedict, Banana pancakes for food. Drinks we had iced chocolate, rose latte and iced earl grey latte. Food deserves a thumbs up! Especially the bagel (coz, I love bagels!), could smell the blueberry and the bagel is served hot with smooth cream cheese and fresh fruits with a sprinkle of icing sugar. Rose latte is a good size and is full of flavor.... The coffee art is super! Insta-worthy...Worth a visit even when it is so far out."
Fantastic spot for breakfast,"This café has wonderful service and fantastic food. Eggs of any kind - they have some creative benedicts - muesli, fruits, local dishes. The coffees are lovely and some come with elaborate yummy decorations! Good prices, fast and friendly service."
Great place for Breakfast,I had the portobello mushroom Benedict. Delicious and can out quickly. Of course I had to see what sort of art came with my latte. I got a cute kitty. Definitely a fun stop after jet lag.
Awesome place,The ambiance and the food ia juat perfect for an afternoon tea..will recommend this place and definitely will be going back for more..
Nice lunch after Pulau Ubin morning,We found this place after returning from a morning trip to Pulau Ubin. Was perfect for a bite and drink on a rainy afternoon. Pasta and sandwiches were nice. Free Wifi also handy
Place for a Weekend afternoon coffee,Lazy Sunday afternoon Tea? This will be the nice place to go to. Tucked away in the Eastern corner of Singapore island known as Changi Village. Long black coffee is what they are good for and their cakes are fantastic! Service level is quite high with the all Singapore local crew. Only setback is their small indoor sitting which can only shelter a maximum of 20 persons from the blaring heat of Singapore weather. 想要个地方度过一个懒懒的周日下午？来这你就不会希望。“长黑咖” 和他们的蛋糕很美味。服务周到但他们的室内座位只可以容纳20个人。
amazing 3D latte art,tuck in a quiet corner is a cafe named Chock Full of Beans. its latte art are amazing. one wouldn't mind waiting for 15mins for your cup of coffee.
Best coffee in SIngapore,"We had brunch here one Saturday morning ... the food was nice but the coffee was superb :) Not only did it look good but it tasted beautiful (I like strong coffee, my wife likes weak lattes and we both rated it 10 out of 10)."
The place atmosphere are really chilling & peace. My sisters really love the coffee art done by the staff :),The place atmosphere are really chilling & peace. My sisters really love the coffee art done by the staff :)
good coffee / slow service,"Waiting for a ferry to go to Pulau Ubin can be done while enjoying a nice coffee Designs on the cup are fun and creative, coffee is good, outside seating area is relaxing ... just wish service was more reactive Enjoy!"
Amazing latte art!,"I would recommend visiting just to get a coffee, although the food was good too. The designs are very impressive! Staff were friendly. Service was very prompt."
Bad aglio olio,"Wish their pasta was better, in terms of flavour. The rice set was pretty bad too, coffee though cute wasn't that good."
Chock full of surprise,"We've been to this wonderfully tucked away cafe a couple of times before. Brought the kids to celebrate my daughter's 11th birthday last Friday. Checked out with the cafe staff on the phone during reservations if they had an unicorn cake or rainbow cake as my daughter's currently observed with unicorns. The staff politely responded that they had neither. We went to the cafe regardless and had an awesome carbonara, crab meat tomato cream pasta & portobello benedict. We ordered a slice of Oreo cheesecake for dessert & was wondering what took them so long to serve the cake when all they had to do was to retrieve it from the display cabinet. 5 minutes later, the cake was served with a wonderfully crafted unicorn art on the serving plate along with a candle on top of the slice Oreo cake. The surprise was definitely the icing on the cake for our little birthday celebration!"
Fun place for breakfast,This is basically a coffee store offering a very tasty breakfast. It was particularly comfortable for Westerners. The service was prompt and friendly.
Nice and simple brunch items,Had eggs atlantic and it was decent and satisfying. Also ordered the white choc matcha but wasn't really to my liking.
The coffee here never fails!,"Great coffee and food, with staff accommodating to our requests to the coffee art characters that we wanted. Thank you very much!"
Nice place with good coffee,"I have been there several times for brunch. It is nice and affordable. However, the pasta is not that great."
Looking for something different?,"Coffee lover / Cutie lover/ cute stuff lovers / photo siao / selfie nuts will all love this place.

with its new internal design, just made is scored more points on top of the food and coffee they serve.

tips for new comers, if you want 3D coffee art choose iced coffee flavour other wise 2D coffee art for hot coffee.

food wise is good too, with its wide range of sandwiches and pasta.
Sorry guys non halal spot.

if you are in the extreme east do visit them . perfect for a lazy sunday after a cycle trip to ubin."
Cozy Cafe,Great place for hanging out with friends and family. Food is nicely portion and taste great. Value for money.
Favourite Cafe,Nice cafe in the east. Been here since they opened. Good place to come and chill. Nice food and coffee.
Lunch on weekday,"Their coffees and chocolate drinks are pretty awesome. Mushroom soup was good, pasta and eggs benedict were ok. Was disappointed that desserts were only available after 2:30pm. At noon, the place was quite warm although we sat indoors. Maybe it was just a humid day."
Cute 3D coffee Art.,Nice cosy place. Food are excellent. Been there 4 times and satisfied with all orders.. 3D coffee art is cute too. Must try.
Very unique art on your coffee,I requested for a snorlax as pokemon was in the trend back in August and I got a nice drawing of a 2d snorlax for my drink! The hot chocolate drink was also nice.
Excellent coffee but food was alright,They have interesting coffee art work... Not to mentioned their coffee is really tasty too. But not for the food... not much of choices and not much of a flavour.
Great service friendly and artistic,Loved the food service was efficient I felt welcome and the atmosphere is buzzing always a nice place to stop. Loved the pancakes my kids shared a plate. (Aged 10 and 7) coffee is goooood!
Nice place,Nice place for a cup of cappuccino or other drinks. The barista makes very nice pictures even on the cream. The ssandwiches are perfect nice place to have a Saturday afternoon
Interesting coffee art 😍,Their coffee art is still amazing as ever although mine doesn't really look good this time as compared to my previous visit. Should have told them which art I wanted else you will get random characters 😭
Very nice cafe!,Love the coffee here. The best in singapore. We also had lunch and though the selection is limited but the food is good.
Cute 3d latte!,We headed there specially for the cute 3d pokemon latte that they had! It was adorable! The brunch set we had with poached eggs was not bad as well.
nice resting pit stop for pokemon hunting,"Food was ok,abit pricey,service staff were friendly,3d art was nice,the kids love it. This was my 5th visit"
Wonderful hidden gem,"Wow! This place is amazing and thanks so much to Trip Advisor because with you, we wouldn't have known about it! The lava cake was the best my daughter had ever tasted (and that's ALOT of lava cakes!) and the 3D art on the iced coffees was so brilliant."
Fun latte art and excellent food,Coffee was excellent with really cute latte art. We also ordered the veggie wrap and beef mash which were delicious.
I like the Toast with egg yolks and Smoked Salmon!,"Spent about S$15 for the Salmon Alantic set, -poached eggs,toast,side salad,smoked salmon, with a drink (Lemon tea/Sparkling strawberry -its the one I drank! ) When its about 1pm or so , its much more crowded and I went on a Weekday."
Chock full of.. Food (in my tummy),"Ok i've got to say this:
The main reason I decided to go to this cafe was because I Googled ""3d latte art singapore"". And this place was the first location that came up. Saw a few of the really cool looking latte art designs and thought to myself: hey, how bout I bring that girl I like to the restaurant so she'll have a nice insta worthy cup of coffee?

Guess what.. She agreed!(To go to the cafe obviously)

And so off we went. Carpark was affordable and very near the cafe (so that's good). I had a BLAT sandwich, which was really tasty! I really like how the bacon was crispy.. So if you like your bacon crispy, you know where to go.
She had herself eggs benedict. That was really amazing too. I mean.. When the eggs(they were poached eggs) arrived.. I loved how when I shook the table the eggs would just wobble as if the whites were just a thin layer and ready to burst at any time.

We also ordered some bangers and mash (no banging or mashing for me yet tho, she's not my wife yet) which was basically hot dogs(sausages I mean) and potatoes. I loved the mashed potato, it was fluffy! I have no idea how to review food but I gotta say.. It was good. Definitely value for money! If value for money is cafe pricing (and not coffee shop pricing)

If that girl I brought does become my girlfriend in the future.. I'll be bringing her back here! During that time I'll follow up with a review called: Chock full of... love (in our hearts)"
Go for their latte art!,"Now this place was an instagram find for me...yes I really do look everywhere before going to a place and stumbled upon their 3D coffee video and knew my trip to SIngapore would be incomplete without visiting this cafe. Though I was staying in Orchard and this place is a bit off in Changi Village,it's worth a visit if you have time on your hands. So since I wanted to try the 3D coffee art in particular, they have a selection of coffees that's possible on. I tried an iced hazelnut latte with a hello kitty on top and boy was it good! I'm a sucker for hazelnut and this one had such a nice and distinct flavour of it. They also do a lot of fancy latte art. I didn't really try the food so can't comment on that but with a super cup of coffee, I left this cafe a very happy girl indeed!"
Lunch stop,Chick full of Beans is always a nice place to visit for a Saturday brunch. I was biking and stopped for a lunch break and the Salmon sandwich was very nice. I always enjoy the fun faces on the coffee stings.
"Another popular place, great food","The latte art is unique to this cafe. It accommodates the Pokémon craze in its cuppa. It also captures the heart of the instagrammers with their food palate.

Brunch options were adequate and nothing unique from cafes.

The prices are similar to other cafes, food quality is reasonable but price is on the steep side for simple items like pancakes.

The staff are attentive while trying to get your order, but they are also quick to chase you out when you are done to make room for more business opportunities. Definitely not a place to chill and catch-up."
NEGATIVE 5 STARS,"This is the first and only feedback that owns my negative 5 stars.

We went there for a break after pokemon hunting. Its was crowded with pokemon trainers but we waited.

Within minutes with more than half a dozen of staff walking across our faces, no one answered us even when we called out to them. There isn't a single 'wait a moment' or nodd, just rolled eyes and treated us like invisible and ignored us like plague. My patience partner was fuming over the rolled eyes n #pretendtobedeaf. There's no respect from them at all.

If your a tourist visit this cafe at your own risk, you don't want to stain your holiday with barbarian services. We have other superb places.

If you're local, I salute your humblest for visiting them."
Super cute 3D latte art!,"Very cute 3D latte art designs, and good coffee too! I've always gone for the mocha as its chocolatey, rich and not too milky...Plenty of pokemons to catch for those into Pokemon Go! For those who are not into coffee, they've also got these cute hibiscus drink with a bear shaped jelly floating in it...Very affordable prices, loads cheaper than Starbucks and loads better quality coffee!"
Worst food and service,"Came around 945am, got a table easily. Al fresco tables are set a little too close together. Patrons who came later had trouble going to their tables.
3D lattes only for cold drinks and upon request. Coffee quality is ok, not super fantastic. Then again, with 3D latte they use more foam and it affects the taste probably?
Bagels took 45 minutes to come. The worst part it was cold. I don't mind paying for quality but the food was really bad.
Service - hard to call staff over, gloomy faces, even when you smile at them or greet them you're faced with dole faces. They might not be well trained yet, noticed a few of them looking to a particular staff for instructions.
Would only come back for the novelty of drinks. Service needs to be improved"
Dinner,Made a reservation for 2. Arrived at restaurant and table was given to someone else. It seems like the person also made a reservation with same name. Luckily a table was given to me quite immediate.
My kinda cappuccino,"Located at laid back Changi Village, this area has been a haunt for Poke hunters day and night.

Dine al fresco to get better gps reception and catch your next poke monster whilst you dine. Visited only for breakfast n had cappuccino n eggs benedict.
Opens 9am Saturday n 9.30am Sunday. Came consecutive weekends.

Eggs ben were lovely 1st time around, eggs were just right soft runny- perfect!
2nd time hollandaise sauce was too thick, like squeezed out of a bottle.

Will definitely be coming back for their coffee and desserts.

ps the barista does a nice 3-d foam art with your iced coffee"
Dinner with kids,"Meal was nicely done especially with the 2&3D art on their drinks which my Monster love it! This is my 3rd or 4th visit to the place, will drop by again"
Pokemon Night,Dinner with friends on a Friday night. Food and service was good cum plenty of pokemon to catch while eating.
"Alright food, 3d art standard not consistent",Food was slow & hollandaise sauce was too little for the egg benny. 3d drink was good (mocha and earl grey) but the art was damn bad. my 2nd time here and it has once again disappoint.
Love their 3d latte art,You can customise your 3d latte art for their selected cold latte. Or customise 2d latte art on their hot latte. Can refer to their instagram for ideas~
Little Surprises @ Lunch,CFOB has always been a favourite lunch spot for me & my colleagues. The menu range has improved recently and we're always delighted with the coffee art we receive. CFOB also tries to adhere to our requests for characters.
Cute coffee art,"I specially visited this place just so I can order a cute cup of coffee. The 3D art is only available for the selected iced coffees and they do very pretty coffee art on the hot ones too. While I was there I saw the barista creating a Pikachu coffee art. It's free of charge but during peak hours, you have to wait up to 30 mins. Go during non peak periods, I got mine within 10 mins. Coffee tasted ok."
Be patient to get your order,"This place is famous for its 3D art drinks, but you need 30 minutes before getting the drink. You will get your drink with a very cute animal on the top, probably made of foam. Once you have finished your drink, the 3D art is left.

The French Toast is good. Best if shared because it is a large, thick slice of bread.

This place is packed on weekends. Wait patiently for a seat, then wait patiently for your order."
Good service,"Food nice, exspecially the latte 3D very nice cute and creative . Staffs all are friendly, they provide very good customer service . I will come again ."
Great little coffee shop,Was very impressed with the service and barista art work on my coffee(s) which I had here recently. Very friendly staff
Brunch with a smile!,Late start on our final day in Singapore so missed the hotel breakfast. Had checked Chock Full of Beans on trip advisor so we took a short walk to try it out. We were not disappointed! Coffee latte art is a lovely touch. Mango smoothies are fresh and excellent. We all tried something different from the full breakfast to eggs benedict to pancakes. All were worth the wait. Home made bread to boot! If you are staying at hotel nearby this place is well worth a visit.
3d Latte art,"Great experience with the 3d Latte art which is only available for iced coffee. For the hot variety, unique latte art can also be expected with cute cartoon characters among many others. Food wise, prices are acceptable with decent quality food. The place is perpetually packed during weekends so do head down earlier to grab yourself a seat."
chock full!,"In Changing village on stopover before flying home. Called into this cafe for breakfast. Good choice! Had scrambled eggs and toast, husband had pancakes--- all delicious and beautifully cooked, good coffee too!"
3D iced latte art makes me giggle every time :),Chock full of Beans is our half-way post on our regular weekend 80km bike ride from Tanglin to Changi and back and what keeps me going is wondering what my iced latte will look like! The first time I visited the great little cafe I had not idea what 3D latte art was when they asked if I wanted it - now my weekend wouldn't be complete without it….. makes me giggle every time. Apart from the novelty of foam creations Chock full of Beans gives a really good breakfast/brunch menu and lovely fresh OJ.
The draw of this cafe is definitely the awesomely adorable 3D latte art :),"I visited Chock Full of Beans for breakfast and ordered a decent plate of eggs benedict served on a portobello mushroom and toasted bread (the sesame seeds on the crust was a nice touch), but the draw of this place is definitely the awesome and adorable 3D latte art.

For the 3D art to work you must order a cold drink, so I enjoyed a iced latte with a shot of Baileys topped with a really cute Hello Kitty foam. Make sure to tell your waiter/waitress what personalised 3D art you would like when placing your drinks order.

The only thing that slightly spoiled the mood was to the immediate right of where I was sat (close to the window) there was a small pool of water forming on the seat from water dripping down the air conditioner right above and none of the staff members noticed this happening. Hopefully, that problem is fixed now. I would definitely return here again exclusively for the fantastic 3D latte art :)."
Cute 3D coffee,"Food OK, price a big on the high side Thou air-condition but the spotlights make the place too hot to sit for long"
Cute 3d latte art!,"Saw many negative reviews before heading down and was worried.However, the overall experience we had was fantastic! The food selection was pretty interesting, and the portion size was just right. The hazelnut latte was a tad too sweet, but the latte art was amazing! It was a pity i did not get a choice for the latte art. Service was good and fast! Loved it.. will return again."
Cutie iced coffee n taste good too!,"Loved the coffee! Pretty, cute n taste good.
Unfortunately, can't say the same for the starters (nachos chips n cheese, smoked salmon on toast). These are almost like the stuff we make at home, no finesse.
The salad we had (chicken salsa arrowheads) is good.
The sausage dish is well done. The accompanying mashed potatoes is good. But the sauce is so starchy...it appeared lumpy. So, though tasty, the texture is poor."
Cute place to bring your other half,"They have 3D art for some of their drinks, it's a plus point
The quality of the food and drink will not make you crave for it but definitely edible and will satisfy your stomach for that one visit
Service is good, better than good actually.

Overall, good visit and will come again when we're feeling romantic"
3D coffee art deserves 3 stars!,Perfect 3D coffee art as shown. Don't forget to request for the art! Hello kitty and cartoon characters are common requests to them! Had carrot cake and portobello benediction. Just order the drink and enjoy the attentive service.
Occasional craving,"Chockful is almost an hour's worth of travel from where I live but I do make the effort to travel from time to time. The food there is pretty average, especially for their pasta and other mains. I do like their sandwiches though. What really brings me back is the coffee. It was one of the first to come with 3D art but it tastes better than it looks. Watch out for the weekends though as it tends to get crowded and you may wait up to an hour if you are late!"
Tasty sandwiches,European style cafe ove ring pasta dishes and very tasty sandwiches. Combo so you get a soft drink included. We had excellent BLAT. Good service from friendly staff.
TERRIBLE! !,"Located at Changi. Chock Full of Beans is closed on Mondays. Opening timing 11.30am, we were outside the cafe at 11.15am. There were staffs around us, yet they did not bother to introduce to us what they had in stall. They continued to ignore us until we asked them about the cafe. They told us that they only open at 11.30am and didn't have the initiative to present us with the menu until a guy, which seem like the boss, told us we could sit around and wait first. Reluctantly, they let us in and ignored us.

When the food (Aglio Olio with Shrimps and Squid, Aglio Olio with Wild Mushrooms and Truffle) arrived, the first thing we realised is its oiliness and as we expected, its oil is dripping from the pasta and puddling on the bottom of the plate.

Moreover the pasta is not done al-dente. Nothing on the plate goes well together, felt like they were cooked separately and then mixed together before serving it to us. Minimal effort given to the food. Would rate negative infinity. Coffee wise, not too bad. Cute latte art but the food had ruined it...

Service was absolutely terrible. First of all, sugar was not served with the coffee and tea. When we requested for sugar, a staff was kind enough to pass us 2 sachets of white sugar without asking what type of sugar we wanted. When we ask her for 2 more sachets, she pointed to the counter and told us to take it ourselves even though the place was almost empty other than the couple beside us. Same thing happened to the couple who asked for a toothpick and was referred to OUTSIDE the cafe where he had to get it himself. I mean we would totally understand if the cafe was busy or something but no attention was paid to the customers at all.

Overall, Food= Fail
Service= Fail
Ambience= Passable"
Love it!,"We go there for breakfast on the weekends, and it's fantastic. We stay about 5 mins down the road and this place serves a wonderful breakfast. They have a good variety of breakfast choices and drinks.

It is popular with the locals and especially the cycling enthusiasts who are usually there after their morning workout."
Nice place to chill and catch up with friends,"I was there on a weekday afternoon so it's less crowded. Other than the office lunch crowd, which wasn't much, the place was otherwise nice and quiet. The weekends are a different story altogether though. Overall, good place for a meal and catch up with friends over coffee with a creative twist."
Closed temporarily,"We had passed by on Sunday and noticed quite a number of diners enjoying the brunch sets, so checked out their menus, which was quite interesting, particularly their coffees.

We decided to come back for dinner a few days later. To our surprise, there was scaffolding and tarps all around, and the place was being renovated. We could not find any notice of when that would be completed, but certainly look forward to their new transformation."
