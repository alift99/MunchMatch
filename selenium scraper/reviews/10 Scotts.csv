There are flys,There were flys when I had deserts course. They did offer to change seat for my but it was already my last course
High Tea 10 Scotts,A lovely ambience. Good food. Enjoyed the high tea. There was good balance of savoury and sweet dishes
Enjoyable and filling,"Met up with my girlfriends finally as COVID restrictions eased. Reservation was at 12 and we did not expect the tea to be filling but it was. We could chose two types of beverages during the tea, as well as orange or pineapple juice. The food was non refillable and ranged from savoury to sweet (included ice cream as well!). As each daintily presented batch of offerings came and got consumed, we were quite full by the time the desserts came and two of us have hearty appetites! Parking was unavailable as the hotel was undergoing renovations but redeemable by Hyatt if one parked at Marriott."
Excellent service,Worth every penny. Wish we had more time to enjoy the food as well as the company. Couldn’t be helped I suppose because of the restrictions.
Good service and ambience but dessert was average,"Went to 10 Scott’s upon reading many good reviews. Service was good and ambience were pleasant for gathering. Savory pastries were palatable and well presented, however dessert were average. My first and last visit."
Surroundings / Food / Services,"When we arrived, the tables are not yet ready and this is ok, but we are assigned to a sofa seat area where is super noisy and everyone seems to be shouting.

We requested to change to another seat but no point.

The serving of food is slow as well and most of the time we need to request to top up our drinks and send out food.

Overall is really bad this time (First time experience was good, which is why i choose to go for another)"
Not the same old 10 Scotts anymore!,"10 Scotts used to be one of our family's favourite high tea go to places but today's visit is a great disappointment! While I fully understand we are in the midst of pandemic and we can't do ""self service buffet"" like we did pre covic but the current set menu is curated with limited items but without price reduction at $58++ per adult and restricted to only 1 piece per item (comes in mini size too!!!).  The food was mediocre and we do are not allowed to order again for the food item we like. There are other hotels which allow us to pick and choose the items we like in ""ala carte buffet style"" so I do not see why 10 Scott is not able to offer the same service.   I ordered Americano and mocha and both coffee were not aromatic and tasted like water. Oh and the place is really understaffed, we had to wait for so long for both the food and drinks to be served!  Honestly I do not mind paying $58++ per person but at least this has to be justifiable! What I got today in totally not worth the money and we did not enjoy our afternoon tea and we will not return unless there is improvement in the food quality, quantity (at least let us have repeat order for items we like) and service!!  The management should really look into immediate improvement before losing its shine in this competitive food arena."
High tea,"The worst main course I ever had. I been visiting Grand Hyatt hotel multiple time and always Service excellent. When we asked for more food because it’s so ridiculous and the reply is not enough food for extra portion. This is what I heard from hotel have not enough food for my first time in my life.
Overall I still enjoy and service stuff are so super friendly."
Excellent....but Covid-19 Affects Us All,"The Hyatt's 10 Scotts are always excellent, full marks all around.

But the afternoon tea has been affected by Covid-19. Gone are the sumptuous cakes, chilled & shucked oysters, and fabulous salad selection. All of these are gone with good reason. The Tea is given to you, your choice from a menu of plated select items - all are also great, but what always sparked my joy were the cake selection, fresh loaves of bread, oysters on ice, and the salads. It is my sincerest hope that we can go back to those times."
A Great Place to celebrate a friend's birthday!,"It's a great place to bring your friends especially to celebrate their birthdays with an excellent environment and staff service that's attentive, polite and it never fails to bring a smile on the face of my (birthday) friend/s when the surprise birthday cake is brought to her/him! Thanks for making it special for them birthday gals & guys!!!"
The best high tea quality and Excellent service,They know what they doing. Every dishes created from great food knowledge. They did not use cheap product to mark up the price. Service quality is top notxh
Fabulous - especially Logan!,"While form is temporary, class is permanent and the Hyatt has always been all class - especially this bar which has become a firm favourite. Happy hour is particularly good with sumptuous cocktails and a proper pour of champagne at very reasonable prices. While they don't serve Perrrier Jouet any more, they do serve a decent drop and the service is excellent.

Nothing is too much trouble and Logan was particularly excellent on our last visit - we were celebrating our 23rd Wedding anniversary and he was just brilliant.

The food is excellent, and the atmosphere just right - so gather a group of friends and get yourself down to 10 On Scott's for Happy Hour."
"Amazing food, great value for money","One of the best high tea experiences in Singapore in a cozy living room ambience! Quality starters, good selection of drinks, generous portions. Only wished there was more dessert variety!"
10Scotts,"Tea was great, staff at 10 Scotts very attentive and helpful. However, they did not have my reservation in their system."
Death sentence last order,"The very very decadent and luxurious birthday high tea at my favourite to-go-to posh lounge. If I was on death row and I could order my last wish meal, I would transport the entire 10 Scotts over. Covid times hanky-waved the buffet goodbye. Now you get 4 courses plus unlimited drinks. We gave the oysters a miss and opted for ocean-sized tiger prawns. Succulent, fresh and juicy, the flavours dance around your playground taste buds. Salmon caviar is so good Putin must be salmon-orange with envy. It’s super rich with salmon saltiness. Salad was sauced right. Barramundi was ingeniously rounded up and rounded off in good taste. The sweet highlight were the Ying yang flower pot-esque chocolate and vanilla ice cream. Tart of the day with berries doused with generous sexy raspberry and vanilla sauce. Wow wow wow! If you thought teas were boring, pot the gold moscato oolong which our server swore by. The gold shimmering specks dance in that gold tea jacuzzi of grape and rosehip flavours. It’s hypnotically beautiful to stare at. I had a surprise chocolate cake which is the ultimate apex of an elegant, classic decadent treat. No one, but me, should have a birthday treat this regal."
Lovely high tea for two!,"Love that the quality of food is always improving! Want to say thank you to Rhea as she was so very wonderful and went the extra mile in terms of service. <3

Love the new sandwich and happy to see oysters are back on the menu! The oysters were so fresh! The tart was very beautiful. The ice cream was light and refreshing! The plating here is always beautiful and it is a great place to go to impress friends!

-R"
"Great place! As a regular, I'm totally puzzled by the negative reviews!","I go there on average a few times a week and my experience (and that of my friends) has been consistently positive - can't even recall a single ""off"" day!

The staff is lovely and attentive and the drinks and food are top quality and well priced.

Thank you 10 on Scotts team for your hard work and positive spirit :)

Will continue to be back again and again!"
Very Disappointing Breakfast,"Had a 2-night staycation at the Grand Hyatt Singapore and make a breakfast reservation for 2 at my favourite Straits Kitchen.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic safety measures there’s no buffet. However, a free-flow ala carte menu was available. Customer service, as always was excellent. Nice ambience. But the food quality was bland and considering it cost us $60 for 2 pax - very disappointing."
"Dedicated staff, excellent food - we will keep returning!","Staff were thoughtful, very responsive. We enjoyed the ambience, the service. The food was also wonderful. I’m concocting an excuse to return ASAP."
Bad service bad food,"There was no presentation. Nothing on the plates were worth mentioning. If you want to serve half sliced oysters, you might as well not serve them. Everything was underwhelming ESPECIALLY the service. If you want to hire young adults, please ensure that they could at least present themselves well. Afterall, we would expect good service for the amount we are paying for your high tea."
Disappointing,"The high tea used to be very good. Have not been back for years. Now spread of food is below average, doesn't seem made in house. Scones were removed from the menu, what is high tea without scones? Prefer no paper thin oysters but better quality food."
"I am the member of Hyatt,","I am the member of Hyatt, cos of the benefits (through misleading marking) so tonight me and my hubby ordered food(should be 50% discount of the food) however when we ask for the bill, the manager told us the discount is only 15%!! I am so sure the waiter told Me is 50%
...how ever things happened"
Poor food quality and service was so so,"The last time I had high tea in 10 Scotts was more than 5 years ago. The quality of foods today was only 10% of my last experience. Very disappointed at the food quality:
1. Oysters’ flesh were very small
2. The soup was not hot, ordered three times before my second serving of soup was here
3. The quiche was cold, the foods like pastry etc were put on the plate beforehand and microwave or heat up again, therefore some were not hot/ warm
4. Service from the staffs was not as good too

However, desserts are slightly better than the cold appetizers and savoury items. $55 per person is not worth it, and will never go back again."
Best place for high tea,Food was tasty have variety of food with good selection of tea great service not too noisy recommended 👍🏻
Thanksgiving afternoon,Kumar was impeccably professional and attentive. The food was totally amazing and the ambience just lovely. A great way to spend a Long afternoon - thank you...
Excellent Service,I was there celebrating my wife’s birthday. The food and service are excellent! Will definitely visit again.
Satisfied customer,"We had a great high tea. The place is clean, the food was all good got many varieties to choose from. The staff were friendly and attentive. Highly recommended!"
Nice place to high tea with friends,Nice place to dine with friends... Staff are friendly and nice ... Seafood are fresh But variety of food is quite limited Dessert is nice
Food and ambience were still as great in covid times.,"The food and ambience were excellent, as always. Our third time visiting. No drop in standard, even in such strange and difficult times. The spread is amazing, even though its order and serve, instead of the usual buffet table. The serving staff (a senior lady) was visibly busier, as they needed to take order and serve and followup a few times for each table. While they were always in a rush, we appreciate the efforts she put in.

The manager was a real disappointment to the whole visit. Face to face with him when stepping into the restaurant, he simply ignored and walked past us like we did not exist. There was nobody else behind or in front of us. There was not crowd. On two occasions, we tried getting his attention for help, he saw us waving at him, but once again ignored us. Ok, we were the only table seated at that direction that he was walking towards.

The food and ambience and serving staff who have her best, made up for an unacceptable manager’s performance."
Fantastic Service,Fantastic service by the crew and thank you for the surprise cake for my sister by Mr Yogesh.. He did a great job by taking very good care of my sister who was a pure vegetarian.. He ensured she had a good meal.. Every staff did a great job!! Thank you so much guys!!
There used to be better days,"I had made a reservation for 12.15pm but only turned up 30 min later as my friends were late. I was surprised that I did not receive any call from the restaurant to check if the table was still needed. Upon reaching, we were glad that the reservation was not cancelled. As it was not a buffet spread during this COVID-19 period, we were not briefed on how the ordering will be like, only informed of the menu in the QR code format. We initially thought ordering is done online too, as the staff walked away before we could ask. Probably to reduce interaction, table service was minimal but the staff was swift in clearing the dirty plates. There was no introduction to the food spread too. Although we requested to have everything on the menu served, we realized several dishes were missed out only at the end of the meal. We were not informed of the last order timing, and did not manage to have second servings of the food that we liked. Hopefully this is not the full experience, and expected to have 'reduced service' due to the COVID-19 situation. With the price paid, there are better options elsewhere though. Note: Even the credit card server was down on that day too. Payment had to be made via PayNow."
"Great service, Great atmosphere","Because of Covid, there is no more ""help-yourself"" buffet, everything is served to you. It's still a buffet so you can ask for seconds (and thirds!) of your favourites and you get free-flow hot and cold beverages. You can check out the menu on the Hyatt website.

My friend and I both felt the savouries were better than the desserts. To be fair, we had stuffed our faces in the earlier part of the high tea so we were too full to really enjoy the desserts. Please learn from our mistake and PACE YOURSELF.

Service is attentive and everyone is so friendly. It was almost max capacity when we were there so service could have been a little faster. But you can tell that everyone is trying their best. Hyatt should add 1 more wait staff to the floor methinks.

Overall a great high tea. Will go again."
Ambience was Poor,We had reserved seat through Chope for our Anniversary. Seat was given at the entrance and ambience was very bad. Ended up leaving without eating anything. Neither did Chope nor the restaurant confirm our reservation and request for seating. Bad experience with both Chope and Restaurant.
High Tea at 10 Scotts,It gives a relaxing and layback ambience for the diners to enjoy the food. A great selection of both savoury and sweet.
Decadent High Tea,"What a wonderful experience with friends. Quality and quantity of food amazing. A superb selection of both savoury and sweet. The staff were wonderful when we requested vegetarian options for half our party. Nice selections of teas, but Turkish Apple was our favorite:) There is enough space between tables affording each group enough privacy. This was my best High tea experience in Singapore in the past 2 years, highly recommended. Great value for money was the cherry on top."
High tea at 10 Scotts,Excellent service by Shea and Nicolas - the food arrived promptly and was delicious. Would recommend the rosebuds tea
Not as good as review,"Restaurant ambiance is ok, especially seated near the waterfall view corner.

Due to Covid19 period, the serving style is order as per high tea manu and not like the usual buffet style.
Stuff is not as attentive likely due to under manpower since they have to serve every table now, imagine for new cutlery, they just put aside on our table and told us to change when needed. ‍♂️

In term of food, the Chicken Wellington is the worse, not tasty, chicken seem like cooked from frozen meat, funny that in ""high tea stand"" they include fresh dates (why not berries?)- lack of pastry and cake, other then that, the coconut ice cream is delicious, cheese stick is good with delicious jam, kaya, cheese, the lobster soup is yummy, smoke salmon and prawn is good, coffee and tea is good.

Overall, consider high price for this high tea even though small oyster is serve. Sorry that I won't be coming back again."
Weekend High Tea,I would like to give compliments to Loges and his team for the amazing service. My friends and I have a great time there and thumb up for the great service and recommendation of the food. Keep it up! :)
Excellent Service Uplifts the Spirit,"We would like to compliment Brie (Brigette) from 10 Scotts for great service. Ever since the pandemic this has been the only cheerful place to go in Singapore - 10 Scotts. Brie is especially nice and attentive to her customers. She makes wonderful small talk and is able to make good recommendations on drinks. It is such a wonderful experience to have her at 10 Scotts.
Now that the usual food service offerings are greatly diminished; the only thing that upholds the ambience is great staff like Brie.
As regulars, she makes us feel at home and we are definitely coming to 10 Scotts more often!"
Outstanding service,I went there for a small gathering on behalf of my friend birthday and we where so satisfied by the amazing service of ROSANA and the manager DIANNA they come and check us time to time and feel like at home . We will come back again to see you guys and I will recommend some people to look for these two amazing people . Thank you very kindly .
Will definitely come back!,"Quality over quantity is what I love about the afternoon tea here at 10 Scotts. The food exceeds my expectation especially as I had bad experience from previous hotels’ hightea.

I love the how they prepare each piece like the cherry top on our tart which was not caramelized by lots of sugar but dipped in a jelly so it maintained the freshness and real taste of it.

Their fresh shucked oysters are to die for! And they have wide range of flavoured tea, our personal favorites - Gold Moscato Oolong (reco by our server) and Matcha Vanilla Sencha. Also, don’t forget to get their 10 Scotts high tea stand. The only let down is that they have discontinued serving scones (an afternoon tea is never complete without scones).

Apart from the sumptious and well-thought of selection, the service here is so nice. The staff are attentive to our needs and are well-versed with the menu so it’s good to ask for their recommendations. They are friendly too! Thank you Kristine, Yogesh, Rhea and Nicholas for making our experience extra memorable!"
Great service. Chill location.,Great service. Chill location. Will definitely come back soon! Great service by Rosanna who served us. Cheers!
Excellent service and food,"Diana and Elon helped me with hosting a party for 50 women in the restaurant. They were extremely friendly, custom er service oriented and efficient. I can't say enough good things about them. My party was a super success all my guests had a really good time. They felt pampered, the ambience was great and all the extra touches that were put in certainly added to the charm. All the staff at the restaurant are hard working and everything very easy for me."
Christmas 2019,"From start to finish an excellent experience. Malou and her staff, Karen, Rhea and Nicolas provided attentive service with glasses and cleared with a smile and efficiency. Food and wine pairing exceptional, would highly recommend."
Tasty scones,"A very nice place to spend your afternoon. The food is tasty , not too overwhelming. The scones is very tasty too. Will visit again."
Excellent food and friendly staff,"We highly recommend this restaurant.
Variety of food is not so much but very high quality!
We enjoyed fresh seafoods and seasonal desserts.
All staff are so well trained and thanks to Ms Seon, we had a very good time there!
She is very attentive and care for our table professionally.
We really enjoyed food/Champaign as well as talking to her!
Will come back soon!"
Awesome place to hold private celebrations,"Held my Son birthday party at 10 Scotts and the experience was terrific. The immediate attending staff, Malou and Kristine, were polite, responsive and accommodative.. the service staff during the event were polite, helpful and hardworking, attending to the multiple requests by my guests and helping to clear the plates really fast. The food selection was great and fresh. The ambience was also cosy and comfortable and everyone enjoyed themselves.
Special thanks to Nicholas, Nicholson, Keren, Rebecca, soon, Alison, Kristine and Malou!"
Great food and great service,"We celebrated our friend's birthday today and they serves us very well! We love the food and champagne! We like to thank the following ladies for making our celebration a happy and jolly - Kristine, Keren & Malou! We would love to go back again."
10 Scotts @ Hyatt : cancel reservation 1 day before on a friday morning for saturday high tea,"Extremely displeased with the way they work. I booked 10 Scotts on Tue for Sat high tea thru the app Chope. A lady called me to tell me that there an event for 110 pax and she has to cancel my reservation.
and yes, I obviously couldnt change the dining time to 12noon bcos theres I only end work about 1pm. she asked if i could change date. Nope, how can i change someone's birthday celebration?
And she tried to lied and said she called me before like a few days ago and one day before which is also untrue. (Which also meant she alr knew about the 110pax event, then why didnt u cancel the reservations from the app earlier?) I have no missed calls from 64167118 cos I depend on the phone for work and would always return back calls.
Now i've to rebook another hotel high tea and places like Shangri La and Ritz Carlton are already fully booked.
why not just admit u overlooked reservations from the app Chope? the above were just terrible packaged lies that left a bad taste in my mouth. if u said a billionaire booked the restaurant last min, I wouldnt be this hopping mad."
"Good foods, Great Ambience and Excellent servers special mention Ms. Malou & her team","This was the first time, ERA Prime group is hosting a Christmas Celebration at 10 Scotts. what I experience from my guys & me were the foods, ambience and the excellent service from the servers that make my event a success. Will definitely make a come back to host another event.

Gary Lau"
Amazing birthday high tea,"Amazing birthday high tea at 10 Scott's in grand Hyatt, food is very legit and high quality for a buffet - my guests enjoyed scones, oysters and prawns a lot. The team constantly kept our champagne glasses full without us realizing, great unintrusive service in the background to help us enjoy our time together! I also got a lot of help sorting out a complicated bill, so thanks to Elin, Malou, and Rhea for the amazing professional patient service and a lovely birthday! Ask for the seats by the waterfall, great vibe!"
Worst high tea,"Very limited variety. Can’t spot a single piece of cake for high tea. Food stored in their fridge was never replenished. Dessert rack is terrible. Very insincere, not a piece of cake from buffet table, and also not a single piece of cake give in the desert rack. They only gave us a few pieces of chocolates and not everyone like chocolates. Half of the rack consists of chocolates, the remainder was made up of cookies (which u can get from M&S), rock melon which was alrdy provided for at the buffet table, 2 pcs of tarts, n that’s about all. Damn lousy! Me n my hubby n my 2 year old girl went home feeling hungry ..."
Good place for dinner and high tea,I love this place. Come here often for their buffet dinner ( more than their high tea). I love the ambience. The staff is friendly. And the serving is generous.
Fresh oyster and decent tea time,"I made reservation in Saturday afternoon. I worried to crowded for lots of people in this restaurant, but there quiet mood They provide fresh oyster and other hot and cold foods, and various kinds of tea"
Great quality food and desserts especially,"All their desserts were really great and their moscato tea is a must try! Although the spread is limited, the quality of all the dishes were top notch! Definitely a must try!"
Solid,"My wife and I decided to have lunch/afternoon tea at 10 Scotts on a Sunday - a bit of alone time without the younglings. The high tea had 2 sessions and we booked the 12-2pm sitting.
We ordered a pot of tea each and then helped ourselves to the food, which is of Western fare. There was a small selection of seafood - sushi, prawns, mussels, oysters (which went empty a couple of times) and smoked salmon. There was beef and chicken, which was delicious, sandwiches, savoury pastries and tarts, salads, potatoes, lots of cheeses and juice.
After about 45 minutes, the staff bring a tiered stand filled with sweets and they were very rich and decadent. And if that wasn't enough sweets for you, there was also ice cream and scones with jam and cream also on offer with the meal.
Our plates were cleared promptly every time we finished, probably because we were sitting in a high traffic area.
We also took note of the dress code - no singlets or thongs (flip flops) as the restaurant is located at the Grand Hyatt... Pity a few patrons didn't bother and I'd be guessing that if they're guests of the hotel, they probably wouldn't have be turned away."
A good place for high tea,A quiet place for high tea in the afternoon at 10 Scotts is a good proposition. You could see different walks of people passing you on the corridor while enjoying your cup of tea.
worst afternoon tea ever,"It was my second visit, and this time I went there with my niece who was visiting Singapore for the first time. However everything was under my expectation and I will never come back again. We had to wait for a staff to come for a while in entering to the lounge. Floor staffs were walking around busily and I did not feel relaxed. Grilled beef smelled row, and I could not even swallow it. My niece told that all she could eat was salad, scones and oysters. A lady with a black suits seemed very unfriendly and impolite in clearing used plates and returning my credit card. I cannot believe that it was Grand Hyatt service."
Fabulous meal.,"10Scotts offers an amazing buffet at a very reasonable price. It was a culinary delight. The table service was excellent, unintrusive and the staff was very helpful with extra choices. A must-do for hotel guests."
Ever Good,10 Scott's never fails. The menu is changed regularly. Interesting concept of a buffet. And of course the impeccable service.
Very cozy place for lunch,Good side of small lunch buffet and High tea~. Lovely place for gathering and chatting with friends. Also good service provided.
Memorable afternoon tea in a wonderful waterfall setting.,"I timed my visit to be on a midweek afternoon for the 12pm seating and found the restaurant to be less than half full, so was shown a table by the picturesque waterfall. I was very impressed with the level of service from all staff, both on the floor and behind the servery. The chef was very helpful in explaining each dish and was keen for me to try each one. The selection was very impressive, from the usual afternoon tea spread to extra delicious choices of prawns, oysters and smoked salmon and a great selection of cheeses. There was a delicous spread of hot dishes, including scones you could select straight from the warming oven. I found that the value far exceeded my expectations, as I later discovered when I went to the the best known white Hotel in Singapore, which charged more but offered far less! The $30 Perrier champagne package was especially great value. I would definitely recommend Afternoon Tea at 10 Scotts to all my friends when they visit your lovely city."
Average only,"Interesting to see many good reviews but the food and ambience and service is at most mediocre only.

Went for the weekend high tea.
There are 2 seatings for weekends
1: 12-2.30
2: 3-5

They are extremely strict on the timing. U can only enter strictly after 3pm.

I don’t really understand why because there are many empty tables.

The reason they gave was: the chef is not prepared.

At 2.50pm, the guests from the 1st seating are still inside so I guess you are better off if you take the first seating.

Time passes very quickly for the 2nd seating. Because you only can get seated after 3pm and there’s not much food at the buffet table. I had to ask for their signature tiered stand beacuse I am hungry.

The tiered stand also have limited food selection (see photo)

Selected was very limited. No macaroons or other specials which was on many bloggers review (NEVER TRUST BLOGGERS REVIEW!)

Oysters are small and the scones are just average. Nothing spectacular. Taste just like normal scones from any bakery.

Juices were very diluted. The tea does not taste like TWG.
When asked for a new pot of tea, they only add hot water (see photo).

Service was slow and plates are not cleared promptly.

With the below average food and service, it is definitely not worth paying $60 for high tea here.

Never come again!"
"Pleasant, good for conversations",I come here for catch ups with friends. The tea and food is consistently good and there are many healthy options. A very comfortable space.
10 Scotts at Grand Hyatt,"Nice ambience and obliging staff who changed the tables for us on request. Food selection was good and ingredients were fresh. On the whole, a good place for dining."
Fun high tea with 13-year-old,"After three weeks trekking around Asia, we thought we'd end in style with high tea. So many choices in Singapore! After reading various reviews, we booked 10 Scotts same day. The request I wrote in for seats with view of the waterfall were honored. Lovely spot with couches (although required gymnastics to get up each time for buffet with table pushed right up to couch). We enjoyed both the savory and sweet options. Many choices, ranging from so-so to outstanding. We left barely able to move, even though we had skipped lunch on purpose. As others have mentioned, the service is a bit haphazard and elusive, but once you're settled in with your tea selection, you don't need them all that much. We dressed up a bit for the occasion, but it's probably not the most elegant and traditional setting if that's what you're looking up."
Super Service and Food,"I had an event at 10 Scotts over the weekend for my newborn baby where i booked the entire venue. The experience from the start till the very end was seamless and very professional.

I first enquired and made my booking with Rhea Degenion, she was extremely responsive and accommodating to my various requests. All my emails and answers were very promptly answered and they managed to make some changes to the buffet that was extremely well received by my guest.

On the day itself, all the tables were arranged according to my guest list and they even went all around the hotel searching for more baby chairs. All my guest were extremely impressed with the quality of the food served that day and had nothing but praises for the venue and food. Throughout the entire event, all guests were well looked after and the staff looked after all aspects of the event.

The staff of 10 Scotts has made organising an event so simple and fuss free. I will recommend anyone to have their celebration or event at 10 Scotts."
Great selection of High Tea!!,"Love this place! High Tea in 10 Scott’s, have very good selections of savoury and desserts. Not only desserts and scones like other High Tea, they have Oysters, salmons, cheese platters, salads, finger sandwich singaporean snacks samosa. Selections of fine Tea and fresh brew coffee , cold brew, fresh squished orange, etc. For someone who like small bites and dessert more than big main course like me, this place is prefect!! ( make sure you made reservation in advance)"
Best chef ever ! Best experience ! Very memorable!,"Annie Cheng is the best young chef at 10 Scott’s. She Is very dedicated to her work and is able to interact with us, always making us happy. She is definitely one of our highlights when we dine at 10 Scott’s. She is always sensitive to our needs, taking care of us. She shows such special attention to details and has a caring personality! Always cheerful and delightful. She is such an asset to 10 Scott’s. We hope the management can let her know of her great work. An exceptional lady we must say!"
High tea at Hyatt Singapore,Excellent high tea more than just cucumber sarnies! Roast beef and chicken... loads of seafood... Proper meal! Excellent with free flow champagne if you want... Weekdays only 2 hours. weekends 2.5 hours.. same price which is bit of a swiz... but excellent. After went to the martini bar which was great... Usual Singapore prices but not too silly. 3-5 is the best sitting IMO.
Lovely afternoon escape,"A small but well curated buffet tea (that works well for late lunch or early dinner), high quality food and civilised surroundings. Service unobtrusive but not outstanding. Website stated complimentary parking above $100, but that meant one coupon"
Pleasant evening at 10 Scotts,It was a relaxing evening at 10 Scotts. Food and drinks are good. The manager Malou arranged grapes for my wine was very thoughtful. Nuts are ok for the beer but grapes are much better to enjoy with the wine. Excellent.
Lovely weekend high-tea with friends,"Went there for a birthday celebration with friends. There are 2 seatings 12-2.30pm and 3pm - 5.30pm but when I booked on Chope, I could only get the 3.30pm slot. Around 5, they started clearing away selected food and drinks, hence, we felt that our tea session seemed short towards the end.

Anyway, on to the food - there was a nice array of food, a seafood bar with oysters, prawns and mussels, sandwiches, appetizers (selection from the oven and stove was good). You can download the menu from their website to see what they are serving.

In terms of value, it's not cheap for high-tea, we paid around $65 per pax, but overall, this is not just your sandwiches and tea kind of high-tea.

Service could be improved as there were times when there was no one to call for service. Atmosphere wise, the place didn't seem overly crowded as would be for most buffets which is really nice for an afternoon tea.

Not perfect, but I would recommend the high-tea at 10 Scotts."
Ever good,Service at 10 Scotts is impeccable. The crew never fails to remember Regular customers. Thank you. The spread is great though I missed the oysters.
Alternative to Champagn Brunch,"The Restaurant located on the ground floor of the Grand Hyatt Singapore. The ambience is smart casual and we went for the hitea with free flow of wine. This included red and white wine. Positive was that hitea is served at 12 noon and in the afternoon. The choice of food was decent and the quality too, both commensurate to the price. I'd like to especially mention a young staff member, Ms Elin, who was very friendly, efficient and an asset to any hospitality company."
A business Deal Place,"Good for business meetings. Food is good. Their staffs are very helpful. Easily accessible. Let one use their PC and lets you print documents as well, while your stay at their hotel"
Ever great,"It never fails in her service and quality of food. Although it is a buffet, the range of good is not overbearing."
Fabulous!,I've now attended the champagne afternoon tea three times with different sets of friends as its a great alternative to brunch. I was in two minds whether to leave a review as i'd like to keep this great little find secret. Already looking forward to the next occasion.
High Tea,"Was a very pleasant set up and a decent range of food , some sushi , oysters and shellfish along with freshly cut ham . Service was quite prompt even with us being a large group ."
Sad experience,"Coffee taste bad! ( bitter )
Service is equal to none! The hostess just keep her nose on her pc . No interaction with the guest!
Been over charge and added items on my bills ... no apologies were made! Left the place same way I entered , never been greeted ! Not 5 stars Grand Hyatt experience!"
Price Up 35% Free-Flow Champagne & Wine Down 50% Serving Only from 7-9pm,"We have been going to 10 Scotts for 4 years now, and are extremely disappointed that we will not be returning since they had changed their alcohol package. We appreciate that price increment is necessary sometimes and have no problem paying more for quality. But we understood from our last reservation in December 2018, that there is a 35% price increment, but free flow champagne and wine will only be served for 2 hours, from 7-9pm! We will have to buy our own drinks from 6.30-6.59pm and 9.01-10pm. Now, this very petty You are charging customers 35% more but delivering 50% less, cutting half of the time drinks will be served on the alcohol package.

We spend most festive holidays at 10 Scotts. An evening there with a couple of expat friends used to be the highlight every eve or 1st day of the lunar new year. Unfortunately, it will not happen this year. I am sure there are regulars who are disappointed with this new package but have voted with their feet quietly."
Good to have a small meeting over this cozy place,"having a small meeting with my customer during last October , everything was good , cake was very delicious, service tip top !!"
A little oasis,"10 Scotts is a little oasis from the hustle and bustle of Orchard Road to relax and catch up with friends. Tucked away in the Grand Hyatt Hotel with modern decorations and a nice variety of food (buffet style) and drinks during the afternoon tea session.

We liked the food selection, which was clever, focused, delicious, and tastefully organised, ranging from cold seafood, hot dishes, to the beautiful desserts stand that can be refilled - we thought it was a nice idea to reduce food waste yet being presentable. We didn't need to have dinner that evening.

Staff was friendly and often with a warm smile; it was a chill and relaxing place for an afternoon outing - they also have lunch and pre-dinner sitting. It's nice value if one has the Grand Hyatt card that generally offers 1 for 1 for 2 people during weekdays and 15% off on weekends."
Good experience,Service was pleasant. Although limited food options but the seafood items were very fresh. A little under staff thou but I think it’s overall a good experience!
Relaxed dining,You can come here for their famed high tea or as we did we had a lovely relaxing dinner. It does offer both a small buffet style dining or a la carte which is an alternative choice to the Straits Kitchen buffet also in the Hyatt hotel. The starters and desserts were lovely but we weren't too impressed with their mains which was some sort of casserole
Cosy corners for conversations,"This is a composite space comprising of many cosy corners where groups of people can be interacting around a large table. The Afternoon Tea consists of an interesting buffet spread and a served multi tier carrier of pastries, fruits, and other desserts. The salad spread was good, and included excellent toasted hazelnuts, and pomegranate. The fig tart was interesting. The chicken cutlet and brussel sprouts with roasted pumpkin were good, whilst the lamb shank was hard and tough to eat. The fruits served were excellent, particularly the black berries and raspberries. The free flow of beverages was generous. The scones were disappointedly heavy."
Good high tea,"We were there for birthday celebrations and the restaurant did not disappoint. Nice food, good service. But spread is quite limited."
Excellent service and food quality,Went for their afternoon high te buffet. Service was impeccable. Food variety was well thought out. Coffee and tea were good.Impressed that they keep the scones warm in the oven rather than serving them with the dessert tier. Worth repeated visits.
Fresh food but poor variety,"Went there for high tea to celebrate birthday for my little one (despite telling them it is for a birthday celebration, nothing special was prepared). Well, at least the food was all served hot and fresh. Great tea/coffee and fresh fruit juice were available in the entire high tea. However, the lack of variety is a little disappointing. There was a salad corner, fresh fruits, some cheese & crackers, 1 type of mini croissant sandwich, 1 type of ham, soup and 3 types of savoury pastries. Dessert were served to us by per table, beautiful to look at but the taste was so so, overly sweet. The lack of variety resulted in most of the customers just keep walking over to the spread and having no choice, took the same food again, some just keep ordering various type of tea/coffee, this should not happened in a high tea buffet. Based on the quality of food, variety of spread and price, Goodwood Park definitely has a better variety and price. Or perhaps we should have try the Asian Buffet instead the high tea at Grand Hyatt..."
Amazing Chef at 10 Scotts,"We are writing about an intern chef called Amy at the 10 Scotts dinner service. Chef Amy was alone on this evening and in spite of that she was full of smiles and incredibly service oriented.

I approached her carving station looking around for a suitable plate to enjoy dessert that was served at my table. Amy noticed me and quickly asked if I needed something, I told I am looking for a suitable plate to have my desserts. She offered to go to the kitchen to get someone to get it for me. I told her it’s ok I’ll look for the service staff and walked away. I looked around for the service staff and Amy must have noticed that I was still looking around and she dashed into the kitchen. The next thing you know she appeared in front of me with 2 dessert plates and spoons.

This is an amazing talent. Amy is not only service oriented, she even understands the importance of offering lateral service to her co-workers.

Talents like her are hard to come by and we must spot them and make sure we nurture their them."
Disappointing mains,"The mains were roast pork neck and chicken kiev. Certain border of the roast pork neck was veiny which they could have cut away. And i fedback to the chef that the dish lacks source. A simple drippings sauce would have sufficed but apple sauce would have complimented very well with any roast pork. I ate one piece of The chicken kiev and gave up on it as it was very dry and plain. The salads tonight (we go once a week) wasnt fresh. The lettuce was browning at some boundaries. The salad dressings were named and displayed in a vertical format but the 4 dressings were arranged in a square. It was impossible to know which dressing corresponded with which word display. I identified the caesar dressing but it was very watery and disappointing. We miss the gouda cheese that was there every week but not there this time - i gave the cheeses a pass. The lobster sandwich had a pitiable amount of lobster in the middle of a large bun. There are some weeks they didnt have prosciutto but this time they had it and it was excellently complemented with the sweet ripe orange cantaloupe. The sushi and maki looked pathetic and uninviting as usual - gave those a pass. The oysters ran out and not until i asked to be served oysters did the oysters get refilled. That night was very strange as the open kitchen was often not manned by staff. At one stage the serving staff had to cut the roast pork neck for a guest. This wonderful staff did not know how to cut and tried his best. The ice creams and sorbets were not displayed in the freezer and we had to order them through the servers. The buffet was not attended to, and refilled in time. I think the mains should always be cooked hot. So even the roast pork or chicken kiev should be pan heated before serving. The green pea soup looked scary to me and it was not hot. The scalloped potatos were delicious but it would have been better if the pan of potatoes was kept hot.. overall a disappointing nigh for us at 10 scotts."
Selectively great!,"The open table buffet was great, especially the salad items, cheese and Serrano ham, as was the roast chicken and the Dingley pork with dauphinoise potato. Sadly, lobster roll was more roll than lobster and the crab cakes, arancini and curry puffs in the oven had probably been sitting there too long - hard, dry and oily, quite awful. The dessert tray, served at the table, was generous. For the price at 50++, it was good value, especially if you enjoy the roast items. The quality of free-flow wines at an additional $50++ per head was also good value. Service, of course, was excellent!"
High Tea,No doubt the food is excellent but the service is really something that has to be addressed not that the standard is poor but just understaffed. Very decent spread for high tea which even has oysters and roasts. Decent salad and nice cheese with parma ham. Even though drinks were free flow but it really took way too long just for a cup of latte.
quiet moment,Although other dining venue were quite good crowed but up here seems to be quiet but they got enough display to fill out stomach. Not bad to hang out here
Service need to improve,"Serving staff manning the front desk was too busy to receive customer and pulled a long face. Serving team seems rushing throughout my visit, not a relaxing afternoon tea time after all...."
Hi tea and dinner,"Although the selection displayed is not much, it’s enough to fill your stomach to the brim. It comes with a refillable multi tier tray of cakes and fruits like raspberries, blackberries and strawberries. The main course of salmon is cooked to perfection and you can eat unlimited portions. This week they have lamb instead of beef as the other main course. I prefer the tenderloin beef which is also cooked to perfection."
Excellent service and food,"I had afternoon tea with friend at 10scotts
Food is delicious, especially warm scones are perfect
Elena, Thank you for service and kindness
We enjoyed afternoon tea with 10 scotts"
Weekday Hi-Tea at 10 Scotts,"For the month of Sept, Chef Robert Nieto from California was the chef preparing the hi-tea. Both the savoury food and sweet pastries were awesome! The ambience of the place is nice and quiet."
"not really worth the price, lacking in service","unless you're big fan of oysters. clams or mussels, the spread won't really justify their pricetag. I was greatly disappointed at their buffet line of savouries, which basically had near to nothing that I fancy, apart from their crab cakes (balls?) and seafood pies, which were really good, by the way.
Hot food (there was lamb and duck along with the crab cakes and seafood pies for that day) were served by their staff in ""tapas-style"". So you either have to shamelessly ask for more than 1 serving, or just keep returning for more.
This was also the 1st high tea I've went to, whereby the staff just walked to you your table and dump you there without going through what's to expect (how many drink orders are we entitled to and etc). Their staff also came to ask for our drinks order, without giving us the drinks menu until we asked for it. The dessert tiered stand took more than 1 hour (almost 1.5 hr) after we're all seated to finally be served, and we had to ask the staff if we're going to have it because it wasn't made known to us at the beginning. Oh, and the scones came another half an hour AFTER the tiered stand was served. This tardiness in serving the sweets is really appalling. By the time the sweets were served, two of our friends were already full from the savouries, because they didn't know we're going to get the dessert stand too.
On a side note, their sweets are a lot more impressive (and tastier) than the savoury buffet line.
Another one of their saving grace is that they make really good (dark) mocha, not those coffee-flavoured hot chocolate we're typically served."
10 Scouts,My dinner at 10 Scouts was yummlicious. The oyster was succulent. The main course - rib eye - was tender n juicy. The service was detailed and the staff were friendly. I'll definitely return. Soon.
