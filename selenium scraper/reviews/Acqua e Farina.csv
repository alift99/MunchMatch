worth the visit,"have been to the restaurant a few times before and i can confirm that everything you try is delicious. the chef and staff are very welcoming and it is a lovely place in general. although it is on the pricier side, it is justified by the taste of the food"
"Fantastic food, wonderful service!","The food was lovely! My family and I totally enjoyed our starter of mozzarella salad. The main dishes were amazing and we found all them flavourful! We had the seafood ravioli, beef ragu and clam and cockles pasta and all the dishes fit our palate! My nephew loved the bread so much that we bought a loaf home. The wait staff were patient with us too esp when my nephew was cranky. Props to the female wait staff for making the orange sword balloon to keep him occupied and calm for the rest of our meal. We hope yo be back again!"
Best italian restaurant and classic,"If you want true original and traditional Italian cuisine you are in the right place.
Here there are no little finedining dishes with fake Italian recipes but the real cuisine of Italian homes.
Here you will smell the real Italian scents and in the dining room excellent service."
Amazing,The food was so delicious and definitely worth the price tag. Our third visit and it didn’t disappoint.
Excellent authentic Italian food,"Second visit, and enjoyed it as much as the first. Pastas are very good - still working through the menu! Portions are a good size - not to small, but not too big."
Reminds me of authentic Italian restaurant when I travelled in Italy.. simply love the food it’s was exceptional good,"The breads, pasta n risotto is freshly made n impressively flavourful & tasty. The pistachio gelato is exceptional gd! I will be back to try the pizza!"
Amazing service and food,"I was really impressed with the service of Wong, he carried himself with confidence and poise and made his guests feel comfortable and welcome. His sense of humour was also immaculate. After knowing that I was celebrating my mother’s birthday in advance, he swiftly provided a complimentary dessert and surprised my mother! His service was outstanding and I strongly recommend this restaurant for the experience and the quality food."
"Great service, excellent food!",Most authentic and affordable Italian food in town! The service staff was also attentive and friendly!
A perfect place for authentic Italian Food,"Went to celebrate my hubby's birthday. It was our first time there. The location is fantastic. Their authentic Italian Food really transported us to Italy. Mama Mia! Everything is so yummy there! Even our 7 year old also enjoyed herself. Their services were also quite good, claps to the Italian owner, Wong and the Indian waiter. They even thrown a birthday surprise for my hubby. We will definitely be back again!"
Fantastic !,Wong who served us was very helpful. We ordered all he had recommended. Food & wine was so good. Will visit again.
"Good food, good service","Came for dinner for my wedding anniversary. Food was excellent, waiter (Wong) was helpful and friendly. He was attentive to my pregnant wife's dietary needs and helped us to portion the dishes we were sharing. He also arranged for a beautiful extra dessert plate with the words ""Happy Anniversary"" written, two Italian doughnuts, and a lavender cheese cake."
Great service by Wong!,Thanks Wong and team for the wonderful lunch service and attention to detail! Really great place for any gathering and celebrations as the food is delicious too. Special shout out for Wong for being extremely knowledgeable about the food and recommendations!
"Excellent service, great food","We had Sunday lunch there. The staff were alert and attentive. We didn't need much help, but they were quick to act when other diners did. Our waiter in particular was very conscientious, taking the time to get our order right, asking how the food was, and explaining the dishes where needed. Alas we didn't get his name...

The food was very good too. The chef's preference is for subtler flavours, less salt. Recommend the squid ink pasta with crabmeat in tomato sauce, and the ravioli stuffed with ricotta and spinach, in a butter sauce.

We used to frequent the place often, so perhaps we're biased. But it did feel good to dine there again and the service is better now. We'll be going back :)"
Christmas Eve Dinner,"Made booking for dinner for two. Delicious food, good ambience and great service. Will definitely return for another meal!"
First visit,"The price is definitely on the high side. No ""Wow"" factor on the food but the price.

I had ordered the seafood pasta, chicken pizza and sausage pasta with ham. A bit disappointed if you ask me, but I have not tried all the food in the menu, I give the benefit of doubt."
Overpriced fare,"Home cooked Italian fare. Disappointed with portions particularly the calamari. And my family of 5 aren’t exactly big eaters. Overpriced for the portions given . I think there are better value Italian restaurants out there. Food was good but not exceptional . For the price, I don’t think I will recommend or visit again"
Hidden gem in Bukit Timah,"Our favorite Italian restaurant in Singapore. Wide selection in the menu, great food, as good as it gets."
Excellent Taste,"We enjoyed the ambience, food taste and prompt attention given by the restaurant. The reservation was ease. The desert was very tasty. The waiting time was appropriate."
Delicious Italian Dishes,The dinner was great. The ambiance was nice too. The food came very timely and the service of the staff was excellent
La Famiglia,"Love this local go to. Friendly and attentive wait staff, great food and wine. We always feel like we are with friends we dine at Acqua e Farina."
Great Italian food,"Comforting Italian food, nice place for family dining, serves good dessert platter & offers good variety of antipasti"
Antonio and Robert drive you over the stars,"Great Italian experience in this restaurant and one of the best real italian pizza in Singapore. Antonio is a perfect host with a real western attitude to customers that is missing in Asia. Pizza and Sicilian barchetta are outstanding bring you close to italian experience. Roberto the chef it great even if not so easy to have him at your table ... but good to have him to cook that delicious dishes. Love this place, food and atmosphere. Thanks guys"
Great Italian food and service!,"The food was, as always, excellent while service was prompt and top-notch, despite having a full-house."
Great Osteria Gem in Rail Mall,Ambiance was peaceful and cosy. The service was attentive and I had no problem feeling comfortable almost immediately. Definitely comfort food for the soul.
A poor service experience,"The shop lot in Rail mall is not big and the restaurant cramp too many tables, I think tables are less than 1 m apart. There is this service staff kept banging into my seat. Sweeping droppings brushed against our feet. Spilling chilli flakes shakers all over the table and floor. Restaurant is noisy and we could hardly hear each other. The sea bass is also ordinary but price is not cheap."
Good service,"Made a reservation via Chope for a family member’s birthday dinner celebration. Delivered as per request for a little surprise cake, also came with delicious donuts - must try! Thank you for the hospitality."
Real taste of Italian food,On a pricey side but the food are great. The homemade pasta is a must try. Service are excellent. Kudos to Jhane for your great service
A wonderful find just blocks away from home,I live on Cashew Rd and pass this restaurant every day to & from work. A friend invited me here for dinner and will definitely dine there again. Food & wine was fab and service was superb. A treasure in my 'hood!
Awesome Italian Food !,Our all time favorite Italian restaurant. Superb food & desserts. Best service. Love their weekly specials.
Ottimo,Excellent quality of raw materials and impeccable service. I think I ate the best carbonara in Singapore. I will definitely be back.
Lovely authentic Italian dishes,"Authentic Italian dishes, home-cooked food, freshly made pasta, fresh vegetables, a good selection of wines, deserts to die for and everything is made & served with love.

Do you fancy something not on the menu? Just ask, they will likely make it for you on the spot. Both lunch and dinner at this place has been great for many years. Highly recommended."
Finally what were missing!,"We are a very Italian family, for us the best food is at home; usually we go out to get something that's too complicate to make or to try new stuff.
Usually but not always, as a very Italian family we need an alternative to our place, an alternative to home.
Now we got it! Top food served with smile, a wine selection based on quality not quantity, home desserts.
Pizza Barchetta, ask for bufala with ham and artichokes is definitely my favorite. Even risotto and fresh pastas deserve a round however, the real differentiator is when people become friends and friends are the best part of family.
So far we will keep with our weekly visit as a minimum.
Thank You!"
A Time to Remember,"Superb pizza truffle - heavenly fragrance, light crust, cheese and mushrooms. Beef was exquisite - tender, tasty. Great yummy risotto!"
Fantastic place,"Authentic Italian food from both North and South Italy. The food is amazing the pasta and pizza is hand made here including desserts. Service is excellent.
I had the linguine with the pesto sauce and big prawns and the tiramisù .
The restaurant is very crowded, I suggest to make a reservation.."
Great family restaurant,"Our family loves that place! The staff is super friendly and the food simply delicious. Even on a busy night (and this place is always packed) the owners find time for a friendly chat with their guests. Our kids love the gnocchis, my husband the calzone and since I am gluten intolerant they can even accommodate me with gluten free pasta! Perfect for a cosy family dinner."
Casual dinner,"Excellent authentic Italian cuisine run by owner Antonio n chef Roberto. Service is excellent, especially from this lady Jane. No doubt my all time favorite rest."
Awesome food great service,Possibly the best pasta and pizza in Singapore. Fresh ingredients and the specials in the menu reflect the availability of fresh seasonal produce. Chef Antonio and Chef Roberto are always hospitable and sharing their immense knowledge and passion for italian food. Food always so good that I forget to take pictures. :)
Had a very satisfying dinner 🇮🇹,"Had a very satisfying dinner yesterday night with my friends. We eat the risotto squid ink with scallops and prawns and burratina and calamari ..the food was great and authentic to its Italian name and impeccable service by all the staff.
I suggest to make a reservation, the restaurant was very busy."
Amazing Service with the most Authentic Italian food!,"Amazing and warm service recieved every time we are there. Very accommodating and friendly staff who's attentive to our needs. Authentic Italian food we've had so far in Spore, especially the pizzas! Feel satisfied with every single visit. Will come for more!!"
Amazing Italian food. Best pizza in town,"We've been here at least once a week for last 6months.
That's only place we found in Singapore which is serving real Napolitan pizza. A must eat!!!!
Their pasta, fish & meat is also top.

Been today first time for lunch. Also their lunch menu is top. Really value for money

Owner & staff are super friendly and know how to serve.

Best Italian restaurant we found in Singapore"
One of the best Pizzas in town!,"Super place for Pizza and everything else. Service has always been spot on. We have been there several times and it is now our official family italian go-to restaurant. My wife is gluten-free and this always been attended to. The little extras such as Italian doughnuts are to die for but not available every time. Lobster Linguini is a must have when they have it. They are busy though,.. if you dont have an a booking it will be tough to get a seat. The place reminds me of those typiacl Italian restaurants in Germany in smaller cities. Both owners always have time for a quick personal chat as well. Took local customer there and they enjoyed as well. Love this place!!"
Terrible service,"Experienced the worst service we ever encounter in Singapore. If you could avoid it , it is not worth your time to try this restaurant. There are so many other good restaurants in the whole of Singapore with much better service. Regrettably, this is NOT one of them."
Terrible service,"We had booked a table for 8:15 p.m. on Friday but after we arrived on time there was no table for us, the employees were rude, and the place was packed with no space between tables."
Bad service,Will not recommend to anyone. There are so many other choices of good Italian restaurants with much better service in Singapore.
The best Italian in Singapore.,"It is like been transported to Italy. Service, food and atmosphere is like a traditional trattoria. Worth a trip anytime of the week."
Authentic Italian!,"Very good Italian food, great service and comfortable ambiance.
We took a pizza and truffle tagliatelle, both perfectly done. Pizza is light and delicious, you don't feel stuffed after eating it.
Tiramisù is the best I have ever tried in Singapore so far.
Service is fast and kind.
Recommended!"
Lockdown/SB Mother's Day special was awesome - we miss eating there,"Hi All,
A quick note that we ordered delivery during Lockdown/CB and ordered the full Mothers Day Special. Was such a great idea and such a treat.
We ordered a couple of extras like all of the deserts and we fought over the special cake and tira misu!
Totally miss these guys and cant wait to go back and eat in when we can!"
Value for money,The chef/owner never fails to disappoint me .. True Italian pasta and pizza. Jane is very good in her service and remembering her guests even after my long absence. Will return soon.
Dinner at Acqua e Farina,"We visit this restaurant quite frequently because of its location, it’s fantastic service and friendly atmosphere. We also love the food ... from its starters to desserts. Will continue to eat whenever we can."
Daily Specials,"We loved the Hokkaido scallops pasta on the menu specials last night, topped with fish roe, and delightfully paired with white wine. Excellent service as always, and complimentary dessert again from the manager/owner."
Exceeded expectations,"We dined at Acqua e Farina for my daughter's favourite dish - four cheese gnocchi - and it didn't disappoint, loaded with cheese sauce and the gnocchi delightful. We also enjoyed our favourite goat cheese salad, and enjoyed a new dish, Tagliatelle alla Boscaiola. Finishing off with the light and creamy tiramisu Acqua e Farina exceeded our expectations once again and we were pleased for Chef Roberto his pleasant restaurant was full to capacity."
Cosy restaurant around your neighbourhood,"Staffs are nice and food is great. It's not our first time there but the food is just authentic especially their weekly special. It's hard to find a good traditional Italian restaurants in any of the malls around Bukit Panjang. All their shells are fresh, their pizza is one of the best in Singapore."
Finally a good Italian in SG,The food is good ! Portions are small though 25-30 SGD per dish on AVG The staff is excellent and caring
Good food & Tiramisu 😊,"We had home made ravioli , pizza and the suggestion of the day and everything was very good , no italian restaurant without ending with a Tiramisu which was very good ! They have a little seating area outside also ."
As Good As Italy,"Came back from Italy and thought Oh oh! Cannot as good italian un Singapore but I was wrong. This place is as good and authentic and for a fair value too. Burata with parma ham, cherry tomatoes, olives basil for $30. Squid ink pasta. A good helping of Vongole pasta. 4 cheese pizza 2 bottle sparkling water, 1 tiramisu, and an assortment of desert, all for $172. Whats outstanding was the balance of the ingredients if each dish with the pasts al dente"
Love the dessert platter!,Food was good! Squid ink pasta is nice! Portion just right. The cheese based pizza not that cheesy though.
Found a gem at the west side !!,"Nice ambience for a date night, price a little pricey but food was delicious is worth it!! Thankful for all the staff helping out to make my cousin’s birthday a surprise one :) u guys was awesome!!"
Terrible,"Rissoto was served om a dinner plate looked like it was just thrown onto it from a distance and looked like vomit. Undercooked and tasteless. They seemed not to care at all about presentation of dish.Pizza was ok but also a bit undercooked on the base. Deeply dissapointed for the price we had to pay.They also charged a tax on a tax in regards to service and gst tax. Total bill came to $65 plus gst came to 71.5 then they charged service fee on the 71.5 not the 65 which they should.
Never eat there again nor will i recommend."
excellent food and service,"Acqua e Farina is located at rail mall along Upper Bukit Timah, and run by a passionate service team. We had last come here with a group of 7 in Mar/Apr 2019 and ordered 3 bottles of wine along with our meal; the establishment accidentally overcharged by a bottle, and the team (unsolicited) graciously gave us 2 more bottles in total during our next 2 visits as a service recovery gesture. tonight, we had a quick dinner of pasta (I ordered the seafood pasta, whereas my wife had the Boscaiola pasta), both were amazing, and the owner/manager Antonio even threw in some complimentary dessert while we were finishing our bottle. Would definitely come back again!"
Very good food but pricey,"We had 2 appetizers, a pasta and a boat pizza which cost us $111+ The food was very fresh and felt homemade but too expensive to make it a regular place to eat."
Welcome Italian at Rail Mall,"Do call the restaurant for details as Chope information needs updating. Eg it doesn’t do brunch anymore. And it now has a different promotion for lunch - offering a $34 set inclusive of a glass of wine, beer or juice. For lunch last week, we enjoyed the set of clams starter, ravioli main course and dessert, as well as a truffle mushroom pizza from the ala carts menu. Service is efficient and friendly. We were given a complimentary slice of tiramisu in addition to the set lunch chocolate cake Have been here several times and feel right at home. Ingredients are fresh and taste of food is delicious. Do check with them about free Corkage, I think it’s on except on Friday-Sunday and public holiday."
Italian restaurant in Upper Bukit Timah,"This is our favourite Italian restaurant in the Bukit Timah area. It is a short walk from Hillview MRT station (Downtown Line).

Our favourites are prawn pasta in aglio olio and the ham and mushroom calzone. We have tried the calzones at other restaurants but we still prefer Acqua e Farina for the dough’s texture and the taste of the ingredients.

Staff are friendly and welcoming."
Good service and Good food,Both Chef Roberto and Chef Antonio and team always impress us with their food and service. We became regulars as a result of that. Always feel welcoming whenever we dine there and constantly updated of their weekly specials. Small place but cozy enough.
Cosy Italian Joint,"Walked pass this quaint Italian restaurant a couple of times with my family, and each time we never fail to slow down and check out the plates of pastas, or pizzas of those dining there. So finally, we booked ourselves a table for 6 and promptly ordered from the menu.

2 starters to begin our dinner, we thoroughly enjoyed the Calamari Italiani Fritti (deep fried calamari rings) served with spicy tomato sauce and Capesante con Spinaci, Prosciutto e Zafferano (scallops with parma ham and baby spinach) - both winners for the night ;p

You can tell their pasta(s) are freshly made - I like the texture. I must add though, that the dishes turned cold very quickly after being served. Still the pastas were decent!

Customer service is impeccable. The staff are warm and quick to attend to your requests. THANK YOU! :)

You may find this place a little out of the way if you don't drive, but it's a nice, cosy place to chill the night away."
dinner,had the pizza and dessert platter. was served some bread to start. pizza is really good. easily one of the best i had eaten.
Rustic Italian fare,"Cosy, unassuming restaurant that serves up mean pastas! Seafood stock was rich, amazing; pasta al dente perfect. Service was attentive and friendly. Ambience: quiet and welcoming. Fair number of regulars of various party sizes, speaks to their consistency and popularity. Definitely worth a visit!"
Tender calamari and home-cooked goodness,"It's really hard to find good calamari in Singapore, this is by far the best and most tender calamari we've eaten. The pasta and pizza tasted really home cooked and yummy too. Chocolate lava cake and panacotta and affagato were also delicious way to end the meal."
Small restaurant with great food,"I was given the round table as per request. The food was delicious, especially the truffle pizza which is a must try."
Delicious rib eye and pizza,"The grilled Angus rib eye was very tender and juicy even without any extra sauce added. The speciale pizza was nicely done, crispy at the side and chewy at the centre , went down very well with the smooth Italian beer.
A great dinner at a comfortable environment though the aircon was a bit overwhelmed by the overflowing patrons."
Best steak I ever had!,Have been to Acqua e Farina for years even when they were called Galbiati! They surprise and surpass my expectations everytime!
Satisfied dinner !,"I’m their regular now, the food was so great! I really can’t find the texture of their pasta else where, I just love it! Oh yes, not forgetting their yummy Truffle pizza.."
Weekly Specials....,Last two Saturdays we have ordered 2 of the 3 weekly specials.....truly one week specials but they have been amazing Have been eating through the pizzas.....the spag bol is the best / traditional Ive had in Singapore Have to try if you like traditional italian
Where Good Italian food can be found.,"Food is good, Staffs are friendly. Me and company enjoyed our meals very much. One of my friends in particular enjoys the ambient and feels that he should bring his family for meals in the future. Also, the service was excellent. Thank you."
"Acqua e Farina, it's always a pleasure to dine here!",Friendly staff and good food and wine. Sometimes they have a weekday BYO promotion as well as weekly specials on dishes so call them up to check. Parking is free and it's close to the DT line MRT.Can't go wrong with their pizzas and pastas. Their ribeye as well as baked fish is really nice.
Will be back again!,Was here about 8/9 years back. And this time brought a Thai friend there again. Since was free corkage:) we ordered all the ‘Today’s specials ‘ for sharing and they were kind enough to split the spaghetti into 2 plates when served. Very good service as well!
Awesome,"We’ve been there for more than 7 times, their food as good as before 👍 will definitely recommend to more friends :)"
"Good ambience, food and service!","The staffs are very friendly, food is superb. Nice bruschetta they are having ;) will come back next time."
Good Italian Fare at Rail Mall,"Was looking for a casual dining experience in the Northwest and this name popped up. The ambience was bright and homely, the staff were friendly and engaged the largely family crowd warmly.

We ordered the Spaghetti Aglio olio Gamberi and the Portobello mushroom risotto, and the kids had the lasagne. There was also the Sicilian Barca - a boat shaped folded pizza, like an open Calzone - which we had with Proscuitto ham toppings. The food was simply plated and delicious. The Barca was a nice change from the usual fare at other Italian pizzerias.

Finished the meal with creme brûlée and chocolate profiteroles, the latter of which was light and tasty.

All in all, a satisfying meal that would have us come back for more!"
Best Italian Food!,"After trying many places, So far this is the best Aglio Olio spaghetti, pizza, tiramisu etc .. Now I become their regular customer!"
Doesn't impress,"Too many things wrong with our experience here. The portion of steamed vongole was way too small for the price (S$ 22). They did charge only S$ 16 since that was the price I saw online, but even for that price the portion should have been at least twice the size. The taste of the dish was okay. The eggplant with mozzarella and basil was very bland. It needed a lot of salt to be even remotely tasty. The service is okay and so is the atmosphere, but the food was a big let-down."
Im eating my way through the menu!,"We come by here regularly due to a commitment and the timing is perfect for an early dinner

Regular order always has the margherita pizza in it for one of us

Have ordered some of the other pizzas on the menu as well and I can finish them myself and they remind me of tradition real italian pizzas and understand the pizza chef is from
Naples

A regular other item is the vongole which is really good too

All I can say is you have to try!"
Loved it but only 1 small detail...,"Food was glorious. Place was quaint. Servers were polite and friendly.

Pasta were to die for. Had the squid ink and the other one with bacon... Wahhhh... Instant love.

We had the cheesy eggplant for starters and OMG... Interesting twist. Ok... There is this one dish ( calamari) .... A miserable helping of 4 full squid... No bigger than the size of your fist and I am not referring to each size... but the whole portion, in total, there were literally the 15 slices of squid for which I had to pay $20 for! This was uncool.

The house red. I am telling you... It's good. It's love at first sip as well. The dessert was also good, for some reason the vanilla ice cream with the apple strudel was solid! Wow... Best ice cream in my opinion.

Is it safe to say it's expensive? It is borderline so. The portions were fair but can do with a little more ( only cos it's nice)

So overall will go again for the pizza this time and also more of the pasta. And oh... They have a pre order profiteroles cake that looks too good not to have for my bday end of this month."
Good restaurant,"Thisn restaurant was good! The food a bit cold and creamy, but otherwise nice service and good food. Good moment"
Valentine's,"A nice place to eat at. The service stuff were attentive, the courses for the set menu came promptly and the food was delicious! Only thing is that the seatings are pretty close to one another, so if you need privacy, find it elsewhere."
Overhyped and Chaotic Restaurant,"Was recommended to try out this restaurant for authentic Italian dining, however we were sorely disappointed with the dishes.

We ordered a Margherita pizza, and a Penne alla Siciliana.
The pizza's crust was alright, thin and crispy, however the sauces on the pizza and pasta were definitely questionable. Not only were the cheese and basil missing, but somehow the sauces were watered down?

The ambience of the restaurant was chaotic, waiters and waitresses were running about everywhere, it was noisy and not cozy at all.

The serving time was not too good as well, it took them 40 minutes or so to just serve two dishes. With the waiting time, and prices on the dishes this restaurant is just not worth the time and travel in my opinion."
Thin Crust Pizza,"Combination of north and south of authentic Italian food with casual and relax restaurant
Love their thin crust pizza (freshly, a-la-minute) and burrata cheese (with import cherry tomatoes) and dessert is tiramisu (moist and not too sweet)
Ask the chef any daily special, sometimes they do have."
Cozy Italian restaurant,"Acqua e Farina located at The Rail Mall, 400 Upper Bukit Timah Road, Been of an Italian background, I am always on the watch for good Italian restaurants. The restaurant offers authentic Italian food from across Italy. The environment is relaxed and you feel like you are dining in a friend’s home. Food is very well presented and nice portions too. We tried several dishes that was on offer, all delicious with the real Italian taste, the highlight for me was Fettuccine Nere alla Polpa di Granchio, and it was to die for. Others such as calamari fritti, Sauté di Vongole, and off course pizza and calzone were all outstanding. Unfortunately after all that food we were just too full to try the desserts, which I'm sure they must be delicious, anyway I must confess it was the tastiest Italian food I've had for a while & it didn't break the bank. About the Service and atmosphere also get really high marks! Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night, beautiful ambience and gorgeous food. Would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will be back. I truly recommend this place if you want high quality Italian cuisine."
"Great food, charming service","My husband and I popped in for dinner and really enjoyed ourselves. The food was delicious, unpretentious and the quality of the ingredients, excellent. It was Antonio's birthday and all the staff and customers were served prosecco and cake, after we all sang Happy Birthday to him! A charming end to a lovely evening."
Wonderful Experience,"Ordered my usual favourites when I discovered that the previous focaccio- liked bread has been replaced by overly toasted baguettes! Brought it to the attention of the maitre d's and it was promptly replaced with a flatbread. My guests were really impressed. Made my day
I highly recommend the mushroom and truffle white pizza. Most delectable"
Preferred when it was Galbiati,"Loved the white pizze menu items and pasta but since it had a ownership change. Things were well, not quite like it was. Can't put a finger on it. Still worth a visit once in a while but the ambience is different"
Consistency in the food,"Friendly service crew and felt at home dining here
Casual dining place with authentic Italian cuisine
Cheese and pizza (thin crust) lover, recommend to order truffle pizza, 4 cheese pizza.
If you don't mind to have ""black"" lips, try the black squid ink spaghetti (the sauce is black)
Tiramisu is their popular dessert - no doubt! Not too sweet too."
One of the best Italian places in Singapore!,"A bit hidden of Upper Bukit Timah road at Rail Mall is one of the best Italian places in SG:

Pizzas are delicious, especially the Pizza Boats. Pasta are marvelous, so are various starters.

There's a good wine selection. Do not leave without having the Lava Cake!"
Cosy little place,I enjoyed the compactness of the place and attentive service staff. They are always ready to oblige even if you were to choose something outside the menu. I love the white pizzas especially as you do not find them readily available elsewhere.
Casual italian restaurant,"A casual Italian restaurant whereby you feel easy, feel at home, feel so relax to dine here.
Few dishes to recommend:
1) Prawns wrap with bacon and serve with spinach
2) Truffle white pizza
3) Four cheese pizza (cheese lover will like it so much)
4) Squid ink spaghetti (the sauce is black)
5) Tiramisu

You may check with the chef of daily special.
We had salt bake seabass whereby the fish imported from Italy"
Authentic Italian - Reasonable Prices,"Acqua E Farina is the transmogrification of Roberto Galbiati's well-known Italian cafe at Rail Mall. Roberto started the business as a cafe/traiteur: an ideal place to spend an hour or so with the newspaper, excellent coffee, and a piece of the home-baked lavender cheesecake (sadly, no longer available). On completion, one could buy some takeaway dishes from the selection on offer, to sustain oneself during the week ahead. Over the years, the emphasis became more and more on the dining-in business, and less and less the cafe. Today, Acqua E Farina is a fully fledged restaurant, serving some of the best Italian dishes in town. The pizzas are especially good, and for me, the best in Singapore. The pasta dishes are all authentic, and good. The tonnato, made with pork rather than the traditional veal, is a must-try dish. If you have sufficient space, the desserts are excellent, including of course, very good tiramisu and panna cotta. The list of Italian wines is as extensive as it is moderately priced. The service is prompt and pleasant.
If you are looking for traditional Italian food at reasonable prices - this is one place that will not disappoint."
Nice ambience.,The restaurant serves good food with fantastic service and a cosy ambience. This place is worth a try
A dinner session for Italian Food,"I arranged to try out Italian Food and did a check online for a suitable restaurant. I found this one and ordered 2 different set meals. The atmosphere at the restaurant was really nice and the wall of wines on display really amazed me.

The food served was delicious and decent. The restaurant staff were very attentive to the needs of the dining tables and to come by to help us clear the plates and serve the next dish.

I really enjoyed dining there."
Good authentic italian food with great service,"The food was great and the service was good, although the price is a tad on the high side. Would probably do a takeaway of their pizzas/pastas/desserts in the future"
Outstanding service and food quality,"This is a small restaurant in the middle of Singapore, i.e. Upper Bukit Timah. The italian chefs Roberto and Antonio have set up a superb restaurant with excellent quality and a wonderful service crew. Jhane and Janie read your mind when it comes to your wishes and they always keep a friendly face.
Aqcua e Farina makes you feel like eating with your family and even the place is busy, which is in particular the case on weekends, there is always room and time for a small chat and a few friendly words. The quality of the food and the wines speaks for itself.
Highly recommended to everyone who loves italian cuisine."
Hearty unassuming Italian food.,"Had a wonderful dinner and wine with my friends. Friendly and efficient staff. Both the Owner and Chef are very hospitable. Starters are of good serving size for sharing. The prawn and bacon is a wonderful combo! Good old creme brulee and tiramisu that you will wish to have 2nd serving. Good price point. Very relaxed setting. All in all, a good place to spend an evening with your friends and family. I like the fact that is it located at rail mall away from the crowded town area or Holland V."
