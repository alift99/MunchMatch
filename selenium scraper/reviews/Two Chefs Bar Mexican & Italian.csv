"Highly recommended for food, drinks and views.","Fantastic location with a nice view, excellent service and fabulous food and drinks. A nice variety of starters, mains, desserts and drinks that were all delicious. Thank you to Ash and team and looking forward to revisit."
Delicious Mexican food and great location,Excellent chicken fajita’s. Nice spice without being too spicy. Condiments could have been a little bigger but a really good meal. Goats cheese salad was also very good. Great venue overlooking the Marina. Really relaxing place with quality food
Fun place good food,Extremely friendly staff welcome you and the wide variety of choices ensures that there’s something for everyone. A fun place!
Great food and atmosphere. Friendly staff!,"Went to Two Chefs Bar for our anniversary celebration. Reservation was easy through the website and their friendly staff Vkey responded promptly with a confirmation.

Great food and atmosphere by the quayside. Vkey and his colleagues were friendly and attentive to our needs.

It is a great place for a meal and drink with friends and family!"
Awesome experience,A must visit if u want to have italian and chinese. Specially shiva is very good of staff and beautiful ambience
Very good!,"We went there nov. 26, 2022. The service is very nice, good manners and happy ambience. The food is great. Everyone deserves an applause!!!"
Singapore Sling,"I loved the Penne Alfredo. Food is very good and very tasty! The Singapore Sling is the best drink I've tasted, definitely coming back to this restaurant when I come back to Singapore :)"
Early dinner,"Visited here with my son he had a burger which he really enjoyed , l had the fajitas which were brilliant really nice restaurant"
Brilliant Service,"So happy to be back to restaurant! As always excellent and brilliant service. Ash, Vic, Lea and the rest of the team have such super warm and energetic service."
Perfect dining place for dinner with family,Had a great evening with amazing food couple with fantastic service. Love the ambience and the food is extremely delicious!!!
Best service and pizza in Quayside Isle,"Best service and pizza in Quayside Isle! This is our favorite place for food on the island. They have an extensive menu that caters to your Italian and Mexican cravings. What a great combo!

Loved the new revamped place that added to the good vibes! Kudos to all the Two Chef team esp to Vicky! We miss Lea in the restaurant but glad to see her at The Rock Bar, another great place to chill if you’re around Sentosa Cove"
TOO BAD ITS A LET DOWN,"We dines in with my partner last night and craving for some mexican delights. We were seated right a way and I couldnt say anything bad about the service? but the food? It was a let down. We have ordered Chicken Nachos, Beef Tacos, Truffle Tortellini and Margherita pizza. Anything above said dishes was a dissapionted and below par. Nachos were honestly okay, deprived with avocados but pretty much okay. Beef tacos came in 3 pcs for 26 dollars which was a bit pricey, All along I thought it will give something that I am hoping for a tacos,but it was a strike two. It was damn salty, and to a point it was unedible for me since I am pregnant. I had to ask my partner to finish the half of it but still our pallet cant take the saltiness of it. Truffle Tortellini was okey, Not that fresh, and truffle taste was not that pronounce as I am hoping for. Lastly the pizza, it was a sad pizza. We were confused if it was cheese pizza because no basil and oregano present on top of the pizza. The dough was still raw and starchy and I had to push my self to finish because of the price. Overall it didnt meet my expectation and It did let to dissapiontment. Thiugh service was great, servers were attentive and accommodating. Its just the food itself. Location and service wise were but other that nothing to look forward again."
Great venue great service great food great value !!,"Usually for business dinners we tend towards high-end restaurants, but this month I had a group of 10 visitors from different countries, and was keen to host a more informal event. We chose Two Chefs. The location by the marina, the outlook, the friendly staff, and the great food, made this an outstanding Location for our business dinner, lots of positive comments from my guests. Well done team and thanks."
Good for a leisurely lunch; but no sets offered though (pity),"We had the spicy chicken wings, which were mildly spicy. Above average, I thought.

We also had the pizza, Hawaiian. The crust is thin and lovely. The ham, we suspect, was turkey meat - not nice. Furthermore there were areas on the Pizza where slices were stacked on one another. Not enough pineapple.

The mushroom soup was above average. I could get the same type (maybe even slightly better) from the local supermarket. No bread to go with it. Small quantity in a large bowl.

Juice drinks were bland. The waiter actually suggested we order these instead of the freshly squeezed juices to save one dollar (?!!). Of cos I regretted that."
Nothing great nothing bad just an average resto,Tried it out after seeing all the reviews. Can't complain anything but didnt think the dishes were all that great to get that raved reviews. Simple food.
Great place,"My go to place, will be missed!
Great service and amazing food, big thanks to Vicky.

Great place for family, friends and couples as well. Service is fast and staff are friendly. The food is so delicious i have tried almost everything on their menu. I recommend."
Great service & food,"Really enjoyable meal and great service. New renovations look brilliant. We are regulars at the marina and Two Chefs has become our go to. Pizza, Mexican and Burger consistently good. Nice selection of drinks as well. Thanks Vikey and team."
Dinner with a View,"Stayed at W hotel from the 1st to the 3rd of February and my husband and I were struggling to decide where to bring the kids for dinner due to most restaurants being full booked due to the festive season. The front desk manager, Nishita Lopez recommended Two Chefs for the pizza and quesadillas among other dishes especially for the kids. The food was definitely amazing and the view from our seat was spectacular. My husband managed to relax with a nice glass of cold beer while I enjoyed the margarita! The kids enjoyed themselves! A staycation to remember!"
Best service!,"Great food, service and the recommendations from Bicky were excellent. Very enjoyable meal with outstanding fast service. Thanks! Will come back."
Super good service!,"Wasnt expecting much when we first arrived, but was pleasantly surprised! Although portions are small for the price, the food was really good. Mostly though the service was very very pleasant. Our server Bicky was very warm and friendly and the dishes recommended were, as mentioned, delicious. Will be back!"
excellent service,There are so many times I enjoyed my Lunch and dinner in Two Chef Bar at Sentosa. The service is excellent and food is very nice. Staff is very friendly and always asked me everything ok and give me some surprising on my special day. Recommend this place for everyone and definitely come back again. Keep it up guys!!!
Top shelf margaritas,"Recommend by one of the friends about the pork ribs and their margarita …. Wanted to try one glass of margarita and end up with 3 glass of margarita there. One of the best margarita in sentosa ever… the taste was worth for value $ … $15 for a perfect margarita. Tried their pizza (Italian pork sausage) which is top ever . Service was ok but the margarita frozen and pizza was delicious and damn …

Highly recommended for anyone pizza and margarita frozen"
My experience,"This is my first time I went to Two chef bar but they gave me a very good impression. Everything from the surroundings, the food, the prices, the staff to the service is very good. Although I came for a weekend dinner, it was very crowded, the staff was always busy, but the service quality was very good. The food comes out very quickly, the staff are friendly and they won't keep you waiting long when you need something. Authentic Italian food and my favorite is the pizza. I will definitely come back here many more times and highly recomended for them to dine here"
Excellent Food & Drinks! Great Service❤️,"My husband and I visited Two chefs once more and they never disappoint us.
Service is superb!!!
Pizzas and Pasta are both mouth-wathering and drinks are excellent.
It’s a busy night and full house and order took a bit long than our normal visit but it’s understandable.
Thank you to the friendly staff.

We will sure visit again!!!"
They suck,"These people are outrageous, they serve customers with absolutely no respect, when I asked politely for a menu, the waiter present insensitivity told me to keep quiet and wait and when he finally decided to give us the menu which took a while, I thanked him and he still had the audacity to call me a whining baby. I intended to leave the restaurant but my family told me otherwise. The service is horrible"
Amazing Food,"My family and I were recommended to try the food here by the front desk agent, Nishita Lopez from W Hotel which is right next to Quayside Isle which was extremely convenient as we didn't want to keep driving in and out if Sentosa. The food is very delicious and most definetely kid friendly. My two daughters who are 7 and 9 years old loved the pizza and chips. My husband and i finally managed to unwind with a beer and margarita. Really recommend!"
5 stars service as always,"We had a 1 night stay at Amara Sanctuary & decided to do take aways at our fave Two Chefs restaurant. Thanks to Ash for taking our food orders attentively as we have special diet request, he then sent his staff to fetch us our food by the road where we drove by for self pick-up without having to pay for parking, so thoughtful. The food still fresh & yummy despite packed up and eating an hr later as we were doing errands. Fresh food cooked with good clean oil for sure."
Nice quayside seating area,"I found it an average Mexican food but at a good location, cocktails are nice and usually not very busy. Prices are in higher side and servings are average"
Most popular restaurant in the strip,This restaurant seems to be the most popular in the strip. We have been here twice. Kid friendly. Nice atmosphere Good selection of drinks. Tasty food.
5 stars,"Good service, the food and drink are nice, the staffs are friendly (especially Hazard). Will comeback in the future. The location is perfect to have a date"
Great service,We love coming to two chefs vikki and hazard always look after us and we are never waiting . Food is always good and our two boys love coming across themselves and ordering pizza and cokes and we know they will always be looked after knowing vikki and hazard will be working . Great staff and we choose to come to two chefs most days
Nice food. Great place. Friendly and accommodating staffs!,"The staffs are very accommodating and friendly. They made my friends birthday memorable. The foods are nice! I liked the pizza, carbonara and nachos el especial. The place is very cozy. Will come back here again."
"Average Mexican food, friendly but stretched service, poor cocktails","The location by the marina is very nice.
The staff are friendly but do not appear well trained in the cuisine & are stretched so service becomes sketchy when the restuarant is busy.
The drinks were poor. Specifically the Magerita was weak & flavourless.
The food itself was average at best. I must stress that we only tried the Mexican food so cannot comment on the Italian food."
Authentic Mexican and Italian food with excellent service,"The food is excellent and absolutely delicious. Price is very reasonable. Best of all, the service from the staff team is impeccable. They are very responsive and observant. Highly recommended to dine here."
Birthday surprise,"Amazing wonderful experience here , the staff are very friendly & even gave me a surprise birthday treat, definitely enjoy my moments here 👍🏼"
Great service and varied menu,Delicious calamari and yummy pizza! Prices were reasonable. Service Staff Mohan was attentive to our needs. Food served promptly. Overall we had a wonderful time. Thank you Mohan for this lovely experience !
Our go-to spot in Quayside!,"Our go-to spot in Quayside! Consistently great food and service, Two Chefs never disappoints. Good value for the money and friendly staff."
It was a awesome day with,"It was a awesome day with my friends here. We really loved the food, it was so delicious. The service was extremely good. And we were happy all along🙏🏽"
It’s just a restaurant with everything,It’s just a restaurant with everything that worried me with the quality nice area and service the food was quite good but I’ve had better
"THANK YOU, Two Chefs!!","We celebrated our son’s birthday on 23 Jan, Sat.

We would like to thank the whole team/crew for the wonderful dinner and dining experience. The food and ambiance are great.

We would also like to specially thanks Vicky for his attentive, prompt and friendly service. Two thumbs up.

We will not hesitate to recommend it to our families and friends."
Food and service awesome.,"My wife and I have dined here several times in recent months. We travel quite a distance to get there and it is totally worth it every time.
Food.... We have tried several dishes, both Mexican and Italian, and the food has been great every time.
Service..... Absolutely fantastic service every time. We have predominately been served by Vkey and Ash and their attention to detail has been great. They are a huge reason why we return again and again. The other F&B staff also appear to look after their customers extremely well.
Ambience.... Great place to eat near the marina.
I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone reading this."
Fabulous service and dog friendly restaurant,The views and recommendations about the food made my Mr Rama was excellent and his service was outstanding .Meeting clients needs are important factors which was done by Mr Rama.Lastly one of the best dog friendly restaurant and cosy environment for the pet
I tried some Mexican plate,"I tried some Mexican plate while my wife went for Italian. Everything was ok but ... just ok: portions were small (but priced...) and taste quite plain, in particular the Italian pasta. Service was good and also atmosphere was great..."
"Great food, awesome service","Great food, rich flavours and fantastic personalised service. Ash particularly was outstanding. Had adequate vegetarian options."
Great Food and Exemplary Service,"The recommendations made and the quality of the food were excellent and the serving staff are motivated and driven to provide the best when you are at the restaurant.
Ash, Vicky and Ram are excellent in providing the exemplary service and Ash will ensure that any special food requests and allergies are addressed and ensure that they are strictly adhered to."
"Awesome food, drinks and service at a reasonable price","Have lived locally for a couple of years and this continues to be a favourite - an opinion shared by many friends . Nice location, great casual food(pizzas are the best in the area), excellent friendly service and all at reasonable prices. Highly recommended!"
"great variety, service and great views",Interesting concept and it works. I had lovely vegetarian fajitas and my wife had the Italian side. Both worked. Quick service too which you don't get everywhere on Sentosa Cove . Greta comfort food and nice beers too served with a smile.
Good service and value,"The ambience was great, nice scenic view. Food was good, especially the pizzas and fajitas. The portion was just nice, and price value for money. Service was excellent, thanks Viky. This was our 2nd time and we will definitely return again."
Staycation Dining,"During a staycation at The W Hotel, we popped out for dinner at Two Chefs. It had come recommended, and we hoped it would live up to the great reviews we’d had. We were not disappointed! Super food, lovely menu and terrific service by the attentive and fun house staff. The restaurant was lively, despite being mid-week, but these two guys were well able to look after diners. Nachos are the best we’ve had in SG, Fajitas terrific. If you’re looking for a great dining spot around Sentosa, definitely pay this spot a visit."
Unimpressive,Portions are very small and really overpriced. Taste was very unimpressive. A real letdown given all the somewhat stellar reviews which seem very dubious and fake commenting on the same few staff.
"Superb service, fantastic food and good ambience! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟","Went last weekend and we are very satisfied on the service & food. Overall deserves a 5stars!!!

The best for mexican and italian food in the city! Worth a visit and definitely worth the money!!!!

Service is superb, the staffs are very accommodating, knowledgeable and friendly.
Lea, Dan and Vicky’s service are very commendable!

Kudos to your team and more power to your business!
Will recommend to my family and friends!
We will surely come back!"
Absolutely worst restaurant at Quayside Isle!,"We go to Quayside Isle fairly often, and have always given this place a miss simply because the idea of a restaurant selling BOTH Mexican and Italian food (in Sentosa of all places) just seemed questionable.

Recently we decided to finally give it a try, just because we've tried every other restaurant on the stretch more than once, and when we took a quick look at the TripAdvisor rating it was quite high, with the first few reviews very glowing.

It turned out to be a terrible decision - the food was lacklustre (small portions, bland flavours) and overpriced. Service was basic, nothing at all like what was gushed about in the TripAdvisor reviews.

This is far and away the lousiest restaurant at Quayside Isle!!!"
Excellent Service!,"We all love the food, and the ambiance. I would like to hightlight the outstanding service given by the staffs especially to “Dan” who hosted our entire dinner. Very friendly, informative and cheerful! Kuddos to have him in your team! And to all who’ve been so warmth! Keep it up and we’ll see you all on our next dine in!"
Excellent service from Ash & Lea!!,"Excellent service from Ash & Lea who were so attentive & caring, making sure we enjoyed as much as possible. While staycation at W taking a nearby stroll, we were so happy to have stumbled by the Two Chefs bar. We had a yummy late lunch & were briefed on the happy hour promotions which were too good to pass!! The best spot by far along this strip. Great vibe, breezy fabulous location. Planning our return visit back already :)"
Food here,"Service was good. The food was good as well. Had the pepperoni, wings, fish, pasta and fajitas were delicious as well."
Mahaletchumi,I went in to this restaurant this evening . I enjoyed my dinner with my family . I ordered Italian pork sausage and meat lover pizza . It's really good and I'm so satisfy my dinner tonight. The service of the staffs also extraordinary. Very helpful guys . I will highly recommend this restaurant to my friends and colleagues. Thanks guys for the help
Good job guys,Visiting this restaurant for first time since heard that mexican food are good. A nice enviroment facing to ocean side. Was order their famous chicken fajita. One of best meal in town. Up to standard and great taste. Most of their mexican food are really very good and tasty. Highly recommended for mexican meals. The little devil was extra ordinary. Service was really great. Lea and Dan giving the best service. A MUST try mexican food ever. Variety of wine from different country.
Horrible experience,"Pizza was good but everything else was bad, like really bad.

Horrible service, we were the ONLY customers in the restaurant but we waited for 30 mins for our pastas to be served. And they weren’t even worth the wait.

Was in a hurry to leave so i didn’t check my bill before paying, my bad, but i got home to realise that i was overcharged - for 2 chicken quesadillas that i ABSOLUTELY DID NOT ORDER.

Worst dining experience ever. Would definitely NOT recommend this place to anyone, ever."
Mighty fine food! Try it.,"Highly recommend this restaurant, probably the second best pizza I’ve ever eaten, only surpassed by an incredible place in Venice! Mexican starter and Italian main, both superb, nothing to criticise here, service was friendly and totally on the ball. If you’re on Sentosa, check this out!!!!"
A great find!,"A great find! Loved having two cuisine menu choices. The fajitas are amazing. Our child’s (adult sized) pizza was devoured in minutes! All foods are freshly cooked and so very flavoursome. In our short break in the area, we visited twice. Beautiful setting in the harbour and the staff are very polite and accommodating. Will return when we are next visiting Singapore."
Birthday lunch,"I hosted a birthday lunch for my wife at Two Chefs Bar and everything about the place is excellent. The food, the price, the ambience and above all the service. We were served by Vicky, Dan and Lee and they were really amazing. The Manager (Ash) is highly experienced and gives absolutely correct and relevant suggestions. I would recommend this venue to all friends and readers"
Anniversary Dinner,"We were staying at a nearby hotel and decided to go for dinner to this restaurant. We made an online reservation and they had asked whether it was any special occasion. Since it was our marriage anniversary, I mentioned that during making the reservation. The restaurant specialises in Italian and Mexican cuisines. The place was crowded, perhaps on account of the fact that it was Chinese New Year Eve. We ordered Veg Tacos, chicken fajitas, chicken nachos, mushroom ravioli and some mocktails. We were expecting some delays but surprisingly, the food was quickly served. The food was very delicious, specially the Ravioli. The serving portion was large and the staff were very efficient and eager to serve. We were highly impressed. When we were done and about to leave, they requested us to hang on for a while. They quickly got a small cake with a candle and wished us Happy Marriage Anniversary. All the staff wished us for the anniversary. We felt overwhelmed. What to say! Such a nice gesture. Thank you dears. You made us feel great . Thanks"
Awesome,"Nice Enviroment, Good Food And Reasonable Price. The Pizza Was Very Nice Here. One Of The Best Pizza In Sentosa That I Had. Variety Wines And Good Cocktails. The Service Was Extraordinary. Best Service Ever. Completely Enjoy My Visit. Thankx"
Dinner at Sentosa,"We had dinner at Two chefs as a family, but I have to say it was disappointing. We ordered pizza, lasagna and Fajitas. The taste was nice but it was hugely overpriced and very small portions. Service was ok but a bit slow."
Good place for gathering and,Good place for gathering and food! Staff is Super friendly and gave good recommendations! Good service from Ricky :)
Awesome sunset drinks and,"Awesome sunset drinks and best hospitality from the staff, special mention Leia for making our dining experience a memorable one, strongly recommended ..."
Great staff,Congratulations Ash and his team for excellent service on Christmas dinner. They were very attentive to our family with 2 small kids. Ambience and food was excellent as well
Very nice ambience and friendly services,"Two Chef bar is one of my favourite restaurant in Singapore. The food is good, ambience is excellent, I can bring my 2 little dogs. But most importantly the service is superb!! Especially Lea, Dan, Vicky and Jeff. They have made my Christmas merry and bright :)"
Highly recommended!!,"What a nice place this is! We came for a nightcap after attending another dinner nearby. From the beers (Brewdog Punk IPA on draft!) to the monthly promotion bottle of wine, and the excellent food, our tastebuds were happy! And did I mention the warm and wonderful service? These folks certainly know how to take care of us. Thank you Vkey, Lia, and Chef Raj for making ua feel so welcomed and for letting us linger longer than we should have! You guys are the best! We loved it and will be back!"
Great!!,Fantastic food and service. Dan our waiter was very courteous and obliging. Price very reasonable. Will definitely be back
Great pizza and excellent services,Great food and amazing pizza. Kids loves it. Excellent service. Nice environment for family and romantic for couples
Love the pizza!,"Whilst staying at the W Hotel, we decided to have dinner here. As we had just eaten the complimentary birthday cake given by the hotel, we decided to just order one pizza to share.

Was recommended three pizza choices and we opted for the Meat Lovers Pizza which was a great choice. Yummy filling with great pizza base which we heard is a specially made dough.

Service is awesome. Will definitely be back"
Great restaurant located near W Hotel,We are currently staying at W hotel and have eaten here twice since arriving. The menu provides lots of options to cater for everyone’s different choices. They will do a kids serve of pretty much any of the pasta / pizza options which provides a greater number of options that your usual kids menu’s. The main serving sizes are not overly big which I quite like. The pricing is pretty standard for Singapore - particularly Sentosa which is on the expensive side but expected for this location.
The best Pizza by far!!⭐️⭐️⭐️,"This place is the best from the food, to the cocktails to the magnificent service. Thank you to Anna, Lea and Vicky for your wonderful hospitality. We will definitely be back and in the meantime we will be craving these yummy pizzas and wonderful cocktails. Seriously, if you are after a great meal at a reasonable price, look no further than this amazing place, you won’t regret it. Been in Sentosa for 14 days and have come here 5 times already!! Well done guys, see you when we get come back⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
Mixed experience on 2 visits August 2019,"My family 2 adults and 2 children (12 and 9) visited on 2 occasions in August. The first for my wife's 50th birthday the second a few days later as we had been so impressed on the first visit. We chose the restaurant as one of kids is keen on pizza and the other likes fajitas.

First visit was great the staff were friendly service speedy and food of very good quality pizza and fajitas. Once the staff knew it was my wife's 50th they brought a cake out and sang happy birthday to her with our customers joining in - she was a little mortified but none the less we really appreciated their effort. Would have rated overall experience as a 5 star plus although I think they should provide 4 not 3 wraps for the fajitas given previous experience of other Mexican restaurants, the price here and the overall portion size.

There are no specific children menu and so they had to have adult meals.

We promised to return later in the week on the back of the first visit. My son in particular who could only manage half the pizza on the first visit was looking forward to having another go at eating more of it on the second visit.

The second visit had different staff working, still very friendly and after we ordered and got our drinks the server came over and said the pizza oven had broken 20 minutes ago (before we had ordered) and could we order something else. My son was very upset as he does not like Mexican food and had been really looking forward to the pizza.

I was not impressed this was not made known at the time of ordering as we would have probably gone somewhere else with the drinks delivered and partly drunk it put us in a difficult position.

Eating out is expensive in Singapore even compared to other major cities and ordinarily I would not compromise on an evening meal especially on holiday and only go somewhere we would all enjoy our meal - why would you.

In the end my son agreed to have something else although he was upset and did not enjoy it.

By way of compensation I asked could we get some additional wraps for the fajitas and they duly arrived assuming that they would be complimentary given the pizza situation.
But when the bill came it was not complimentary and the service charge was still added when service was not would it should have been. The food was of good quality and based on that experience alone would have rated it a 2 star visit and probably never returned.

Overall though given the fantastic experience of visit one and the dissapointment of visit 2 we would rate the restaurant visits as a 4 star experience.

In future staff should really make customers aware if half the menu is not available before taking orders and bringing over drinks plus they should review the number of wraps they provide with the fajitas."
Best Mexican/Italian food in SG,"This is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the best place to have delicious Mexican/Italian in Singapore! I went there with my family for lunch, and didn't regret it one bit. There were a wide variety of options at the restaurant. I hate seafood, so I was glad to know that there was a non-seafood section on the menu. My mum is allergic to avocados, so the nice staff obliged to serve her a dish which usually has avocado without avocado. My sister is a very picky eater, but she agreed that the food was great. The staff were really friendly as well; and I was relieved that the prices were low as well. I would give above 5 stars if I could."
Superb Foods and Services,"Our first time to visit the bar and it was the best! The ambiance was so nice, the service and the staffs Lea and Anna was so cool, and most of all the food was fantastic! We had Honey BBQ Wings, Mixed Fajitas, and Chilli Con Carne...and all are so delicious. Highly recommended!"
Superb!,"The food and ambience is superb! A very relaxing restaurant and affordable food. The staffs are friendly especially Leah and Anna, their service is commendable."
Really enjoyed,"Great food, great hospitality. Love the ambience. Chef customized the food as we wanted it. Will be on top of the list to visit whenever I am in Singapore"
Great Little Gem!,"Our 5th visit to this unbelievable restaurant in Sentosa Cove.

As we had 12pax with no reservation it took fast for them to arrange the tables.
Food was great as usual,evidence
by the crowds here,with their neighbors are rather empty.

Had Awesome Beef nachos,fresh calamari,cheesy Burata & their chef platters for starters.
Do your self a favour and order the Mixed Fajita (chicken & beef mix) absolutely the best thing I ever eaten.Get your own and don’t share or you’ll be finding fighting with your friends.
Mexa burrito,pork ribs was very fresh indeed.
I cannot miss their Chorizo & salami pizza.
went so well with all their sauces that provided.

Outdoor seating was great with overseeing the boat & waters,very relaxing ambience and I must say their music was equally great.
Service was impeccable even on Saturday dinner from
Anna,Vicky,Lea & Ivan.

I can’t recommend this restaurant enough honestly with the level of service & great food that been served to us.
Lastly this little Gem is very well worth a visit."
Good food and service,"We went there with our toddler. The restaurant was close to full and only 3 servers.

However they were quick feet, smiling, got all orders right and totally awesome great attitude.

Indeed their pizza taste awesome! We tried both mexican and italian. It was a very pleasant dinner.

Keep up both good food and service!"
Lunch at Sentosa Cove,We had garlic pizza bread to start and then a corleone pizza for main. As nice a pizza as I've tasted anywhere. Along with a couple of beers and cocktails just a lovely lunch with an outlook onto the marina.
Yummilious pizzas... thumbs up!,"Our first time trying at this Italian restaurant. Location was great as it is facing the private yacht at quayside Sentosa. Food was awesome, we ordered pizzas, pasta and some sides. Every dish was super delicious. Staffs were friendly and attend to us very quickly. We will definitely come back again and will also recommend to our friends too."
Awesome Food AND Staff,"We were intrigued by a restaurant offering such differing cuisine, which are two of our favorite types of food so we decided to give it a try. Our family ordered the Truffle Tortellini, a margherita pizza, and prawn gnocchi. We're still talking about the tortellini.
The next day we went back to try the Mexican side of the menu, and what we tried, the fajitas, were equally as good.
On top of that, the staff were extremely nice and did their best to make sure we were taken care of, including bringing toys for our little girl to play with. Anna was the best!
Overall, it was fantastic. We wish we had eaten every meal there while we were in Sentosa."
Excellent,We ate here twice on our recent holiday to Singapore - both meals were excellent in terms of quality backed up with service to match. Looking forward to returning next year!
Great food,We were a party of five and not sure what we wanted to eat. We were looking for a place that everyone like. The food was delicious and the staff was great.
"Great Food, Location & Atmosphere","Good Atmosphere right on the cove, food quality is very good and the menu has a lot of popular Italian & Mexican dishes. Staff is very welcoming & very friendly. We went with a big group but still the service was really good, all the orders were delivered without any delay.

Would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is visiting Sentosa cove."
Good Atmosphere,Only had some pre dinner drinks here but was pleasant and relaxed sitting outside in the late afternoon with a drink.
Very good quality food,Very good quality food and great service. We were pleasantly surprised and convenient for a short stroll afterwards.
Amazing Ossobuco/Great Service,"I had been to many restaurants here in Singapore but never had such amazing ossobuco.
Glad I tried this place after the wait staff explain the menu as we were planning for our dinner with friends at sentosa cove during the yacht show.
Had bucket of mix beer and their margarita which was really strong and taste good.
Will definitely be back for their amazing ossobuco again.
Friendly service from the staff."
Never had a bad meal here!,"Great food, good atmosphere, fantastic location and friendly staff. What more do you need? Love this place"
Family friendly and delicious,"We came for dinner one night and couldn't fault the food or service. Having been in Singapore for 5 nights now, this is definitely out favourite place to eat. Back again today for lunch and the standard is the same. They catered to my kids accordingly and even gave them some toys to play with. The margarita pizza is a must! Absolutely delicious! Also the quesidilas are so yummy!! The best Ive ever had. Must visit if your ever in sentosa"
Brilliant Service,"Popped in for a meal one evening and was blown away by their excellent and brilliant service. It’s become one of my fave places. Edward, Vincent, Ash and Vic have such super warm and energetic service. Not only that, Vic dances when he serves the food, how awesome is that! They work as a team and attention to service excellence is refreshing."
Very empty for lunch during the week. The food is OK!,"I had lunch there with my 10 year old son. We were the only one on a Thursday lunch time during school holidays.
They had Asahi beer on special for $10 for a pint.
The portions were relatively small for the price.
Wasn't the best Mexican we have had!!! It was OK but not memorable.

The service was very good and they gave us a 10% discount which was a pleasant surprise."
Succeeded in both the Mexican and the Italian bit,"Two Chefs is located at Quayside Isle mall that is essentially a kind of upgraded food court with several restaurants side by side, next to the marina. Stayed at the W Hotel right next door and ended up eating here more than once, quite against our holiday policy of one meal per restaurant. More than one kitchen style could spell disaster but the Two Chefs manage to deliver. The food’s nice and unpretentious and the service is friendly."
Great Food & Service,Great food and service. Food portion was huge. My partner and I ordered a platter and pizza to share. Ambience was great. The music played in the restaurant suits the ambience.
Fresh pasta/Great happy hour deal $10/pint,"Went to Two Chefs Bar for Dinner with my family after a friend of mine recommended this place.
We enjoyed the evening with Great fresh food they served.
I must say their fresh pasta is one of the best that we ever tried in any Italian restaurant in Singapore.
They also have happy hour till 7pm on weekdays which is $10 pint for asahi and kronenbourg blanc.
Great food & service by them.
Will definitely go back.
If you are at sentosa cove this place is worth trying."

Best Restaurant with Top-notch Personalized Service,"My husband and I got married in this beautiful restaurant on the 18 of January 2019 and we were all amazed by the level of service that this restaurant has. Despite having a total headcount of just 12 pax, the restaurant went above and beyond to ensure that all our needs were met.

A personalized menu was created by the chef which added a really great sense of personal touch. Nattasha, the lady whom we were contacting via emails was very patient, courteous and professional. Nattasha even kindly decorated and printed a really beautiful personalized menu for our event without asking for any monetary return. This truly shows how passionate they are in delighting their guests.

The in-charge, Ash also allowed us to decorate the place the night before without imposing any charges (this is by the way really rare in Singapore, I have held other events in other restaurants and most would charge for the usage of space for the event decoration). While it can be stressful to plan our big day, Nattasha and Ash were very flexible to our requests and for each request that was made, they sure had delivered it way better than what we had expected.

The day of the solemnization was incredible. Ash and his team were very thoughtful to all our guests. They even offered to take photographs and videos of us during our solemnization, which honestly is beyond their duty. They could have just chill in a corner while waiting for our ceremony to end! But instead, the team assisted us without us asking. And for that thoughtful act of theirs, we brought back many more photographs and videos shot by their team.

The food served was needless to say, incredible and the ambiance was really perfect for the ceremony.

I have tried other restaurants along the the ocean way area and none could compare to their level of service and quality of food served.

This beautiful restaurant definitely is suitable not just for a casual dine-in, but they are also capable of hosting the most important day of your life. Strongly recommend anyone to give this place a try!

PS: Their Tiramisu cake is a must have!"
