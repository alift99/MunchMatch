Look for Sukh,"excellent service and care by Sukh. was there for a business meeting and were well-taken care of by Sukh in terms of the meal plan and drinks pairing.
all partners were able to just focus on the business discussion!
thanks again Sukh appreciate your hospitality.
See you again"
Outstanding service,"We were greeted by Bartender Sukh and he‚Äôve been giving us an outstanding service for our dinner experience. Especially when we brought baby, they diligently changes any dirty & finished dinner plate, making sure everything‚Äôs clean. Thank you very much for a fantastic service, specifically to Sukh"
Great spot for an impromptu bottle of wine,"Great service, Cool vibe and Central location. Waiter was knowledgeable and gave good recommendations for wine. Will come back soon!"
First time,One of the best food and great service Awesome place to meet and chat. Barista Sukh done an awesome job with the latte art thank you
Authentic French cuisine,"My friend and I wanted a nice place for our last supper before going back to Europe. We were thoroughly impressed by the quality of the food. The authenticity of the taste. It brings me right back to France. Our caterer Kelvin was particularly excellent. He was attentive and warm and always had a natural smile. We felt very well cared for. If you look for an authentic European/French taste, look no further."

WOW,Great foods Nice steak Wonderful coffee & desserts with Awesome service team. Thumbs up and well done. (Visited on 22 Dec) ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
Lively yet classy,"Brilliant food, wine, ambience and value for money. Lively trendy crowd with a neighbourhood feel. Best in the evening"
Very nice ambiance and great food,Very lovely place for dinner. Foodies are good seletion. Generous portions. And Staff Mr. Sara given best services we will visit again and surely recommend our friends and families
disappointing food; a wine bar which needs to be told to change glass between white and red wine,"i hope this was a bad day regards service. Sunday evening, young kids, no experience. when one claim to be a wine bistro, it is not acceptable to have to point out to the waiter that we wish to change glass between the white wine and the red wine.
regards food, disappointment, and i doubt this is bad day question. duck rillette and duck parmentier suspiciously seem to have the same base of over cooked shredded duck. overcooked - not enough fat for rillette, possibly ok for duck confit but shredding way too much so that there is no texture anymore. and the pork tenderloin with creamy corn puree and feta crumble: 3 crumbles of feta and lots of POPCORN ? seriously (creamy corn puree ? don't recall, there was an apple sauce for sure...).
sorry guys. you did not score."
Great dinner,"Yummy Mizo glazed Salmon with the potato rosti & Ravioles de Royans, is my first visit here & I found the rosti very soft & tasty, service is great & warm"
Birthday Dinner,Flambe #1 is a must try!!! And the raviole is always a fave. Ambiance is soooooo nice and the staff are so helpful! Will come back for sure!

Great service,"My 1st visit in Merci Marcel at Club street, 3 of us order the set lunch was very efforts price & food quality, Angus beef & chocolate is must, Service on the top side even they are very busy during the lunch but keep checking we are in good experience"

Perfect everytime,"Countless times I‚Äôve visited Merci Marcel Club street and it never fails to satisfy.

The menu reads well but star to the show is the Raviolis and Duck Parmatier and just cannot go wrong. For greens, the Caesar salad with Kale has great earthy flavours.

As for the staff and vibes, the location has chill written all over, and the friendly Mae who hosted us always makes the experience so welcomed."
2nd time visit this month,"Salmon Rillettes‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Ravioles de Royans‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Tarte Flambee#2‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê French Toast‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê The ravioles was so creamy and tasty, and the french toast is a must order everytime I dine hereüòÉ"
Merci to this restaurant,"Visited here for friends birthday staff very friendly, food amazing. Definitely worthy a visit. Good value for money. Relaxed atmosphere."
Oh yeah this is yummy,We went to this quite small restaurant for dinner. We were greeted with friendly smiles and delightful atmosphere. It‚Äôs a cheese place. Lots of amazing cheesy treats. We shared some plates and the highlight was a duck toast and a grape and duck thin pizza. The cheese toppings complimented without overpowering. Just lovely. Finished with cr√®me br√ªl√©e which was super yummy as well. The prices were really reasonable and if I lived here I think I‚Äôd be a regular. Well done guys.
Great place to relax and enjoy life,"Merci Marcel is a great place for a relaxing break fast, great wine or also simple dinner!
The food is of very high quality, the coffee has a great taste and the option of wines are very good.

Specifically to highlight is the above-average staff (in comparison to Singapore-standard). Everyone is highly professional, exceptional well trained and super friendly. We had a great time with Jody - she did a fantastic job.

We would consider Merci Marcel at any time to have a good time in Singapore."
"GREAT FOOD, GREAT SERVICE!","first time here! Had a great time with my friends and great service from Mae, Nora and Jodi. Will definitely come again! üôÇ"
A Nice place with good service,"Had fun with my girlfriends! This is a nice place to chill as the place is so good. Great service from Mae, Nora and Jodi‚ô•Ô∏è The food is great and coffee is amazing!"
Hands down one of the best breakfasts in town,"Mia and her team provided hands down the best service we'd experienced in Singapore. I know that's not really saying much as the service in Singapore is so appalling it's hard to believe you're in one of the world's great cities, but the experience at Merci Marcel was refreshing in contrast. As an important bonus, the food was delicious. My wife and I shared the truffles and aged parmesan scrambled eggs...which were amazing...and a croissant - which was flakey and buttery like a croissant should be. The coffee was very decent (served with a little chocolate on the side which is a surprising and nice little extra) which in combo with the food left us utterly delighted. I'll definitely be back when I'm next in town."
gotta try!!,"Amazing foods with good service and cozy environment to catch up with friends. Definitely will go again!! Chin yee she was awesome, recommended some good foods and perfect wine. Thanks for the beautiful evening. We enjoyed a lot."

1st time here!,"Cosy ambience, attentive staff.. especially Sara the shift manager who kept checking on us to ensure that food and service were up to standard üëç"
Splendid crew,"Sara and the team were so attentive and thoughtful. They were super on the ball when we were being approached by a drunk guest, and they handled it beautifully. Even apologized and followed up with drinks, when it was no fault of theirs. We appreciate it very much, and hope to be back soon!"
Awesome vibe and service,Walked by club st and saw this place bustling with crowd on a sunday. was given a seat indoors and had a couple of drinks and the caesad salad. service by Ash and Mas was fantastic. Will be back !
Nice nice,Always enjoy the food and service. Will come back again. Problem is the parking. Difficult to get a nearby parking due to limited lots available.
Amazing food and service!,"Loved my dinner here. Ravioli was incredible. The food, the ambience and the service was fantastic. Definitely one of my new favorite restaurants!"
Dinner with outside seating,"Absolutely amazing service and dining experience! The food, drinks, atmosphere, music, and most importantly the service was top notch. Su-yin our server was the best!

We were served by su yin who was really bubbly and cheerful! We ordered the ravioles (excellent! Cheese was fresh and white sauce was divine) + crab tartine which was also delicious though small. Good ambience too! Nice place for brunch n a 5min walk from telok ayer mrt
Great Service,Sue-yin was our waiter and she was lovely and striked up a conversation with us! ordered fries and great food too
Relationship marketing,"The waiter and waitress were very friendly, they ensured that my need was met. My friends and I were welcomed warmly, even though we don't look like someone who spends a lot in the restaurant. The food was awesome, seriously good, the beef burger when cooked medium rare just smoothly slips down your throat. They sell seriously nice scented drinks too. Definitely lit and bussin!"
Great ambience and amazing food,Had brunch on the weekend and the Eggs Benedict and Croque Marcel was simply divine. Service staff by the lovely Jody and Su yin were super attentive when my husband I and dined in. Will come back to try their dinner menu! 5 stars. Merci team at club street :)

Definitely a must to come if u enjoy a good pizza and steak!
Review,"The staff were super friendly and service was A+++ 11/10, nice atmosphere, good food recommendations"
great customer service!!!!!,su yin gave us amazing service and served us well and proper! food was good and the service was good! 10/10 would recommend yall to visit!!!!!!
High quality food,"Highly recommended by friends who have tried their food, they didn't disappoint as we came for a team dinner. Ordered a variety of food so that we can all share. Food was pleasing to the palate, a few of them was recommended by the server and they pack a surprise to the taste butt. I'm not doing justice because obviously I've forgotten the names of dishes, but it is definitely worth going and will come back again to try the food. The cocktail is great by the way and the service crew really can make the right recommendations."
Nice cozy French Restaurant,"last night.. nice food and place, it's just that there's no waiters/waitress to attend us in our table, but thank you to Aliyah she's the bartender and she took our orders, good recommendation of raviole partner with white wine."
excellent service with a heart,i was exploring Sg on foot and it started drizzling. Ms Nora at Club steet branch and accommodated me to a table despite the place being packed with some reserved table. She ensure i have a table to enjoy my tea break until the rain stopped. Such service with a genuine heart is a rare find in Sg.
The duck,Great food and service. Would recommend the red snapper and duck confit. Good vibes. Our server Ash was excellent and really made our night!
Totally disappointed,"Even though we had a reservation the manager tried to explain why it is complicated...
I ordered the ceviche 28$++ which is supposed to be a main dish.. but actually very very small even for a starter
My husband ordered coppa that came without bread ( you had to order separately) which is totally wrong from a supposed to be french restaurant.
Won't come again"
really nice place for sharing food,the waiters are amazing and the ravioli is my favorite. lovely food and service. definitely a good place for birthday dinners. Makes sharing food easy.
Excellent service,Thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast. Particularly impressed by the quality of the food and the efficiency of the service crew member named Marissa
Great service,"I was there on tuesday night and had a wonderful dining experience, service was very good, we will come back again for sure."
Lunch and wine,"Had a lovely lunch, goats cheese salad and wine. Really relaxed atmosphere , but the staff / service definitely make this place special and make you feel very comfortable; nothing is too much trouble. 5 stars for service!"
Very delicious food!!!!!!,The ambiance and food are exceptional. I love the ceviche red snapper. One for the books! The staff are friendly and helpful. Definitely coming back. üëçüèº
Dinner,"We get the best service ever even though we didn‚Äôt reserve a table, the host Jena accommodate us at a very nice and cosy corner. Will definitely come back and try the rest of the food and drinks that was recommended by The crew."
"Super nice ambiance, good service and great food","It was full when we first arrived and we hadn't been able to make a reservation earlier but after a few minutes the waiters managed to find a table for us, it was partly in the sun though so later they moved us to a better spot which was very kind. We were a group of four. They served us water which I find a huge plus in this weather and something that is lacking in many other cafes and restaurants. The food and beverages were really tasty and looked super pretty, service was also great. Overall very nice experience."
Simply amazing!!!,"My friends and I didn‚Äôt managed to book a table so we tried to walk in. True enough no table available. The service staff is really nice to let us have an outdoor table which is around 20min waiting time. We were served cold water during the wait and we got an indoor seat in the end. Food is perfect and service is impeccable.

We will be back soon."
Must Visit!,This place has a very french aesthetic as the name of the restaurant suggests and it is located in a cozy little corner close to Chinatown. Their ambience is lovely and the servers too were quite obliging. Everything we ordered on the menu was on point! Keep up the good service :) Do try out their cheeseboard as they're authentically sourced.
