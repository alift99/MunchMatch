good food bad service,"Simply just avoid this place. We made a reservation for a table going out with my wife after some time not being each others. They put us up at he table that facing the bathroom and kitchen. When we asked to be moved to a better place they refused citing that more people are coming. Nobody came. So here we are in an empty restaurant, stuck at a terrible table; paid over 600 dollars for what it was a good food but horrible service, Typical for Singapore dinning. Living in in Singapore form 20 years this is juts typical.
If you come to Singapore for few days go to Hawker centers s and d Food courts, avoid high dining. This is very typical; bad service and highly overpriced food and drinks."
Too pricy for average food,"Average food at expensive price. The food was ok but quite expensive. 43 dollars for a salmon dish is overrated. Service was basic, did not feel welcome. Would not come again"
French Comfort Food,"I love French food, but sometimes I do find that French food looks to be like serious business, with all the formalities and such. I do love formal settings when I’m in the mood to be pampered. But that is more of once in a while thing, which is not enough to satisfy my cravings for French food. And Taratata Brasserie fills in this spot nicely with its affordable French cuisine and cozy, rustic setting. Now I can see enjoy French food often!

Enjoying fresh French Baguette with fluffy centre that is slathered with creamy French butter is a good way to start the meal.

French Onion Soup may look messy, but this is seriously awesome comfort food. Rich, thick and flavourful.

For a bit of indulgence, I ordered Pan-seared Duck Foie Gras with Dark Cherries. Perfectly seared to have thin crispy exterior that wraps around luxurious fatty juicy core. With the dark cherries added for that variety in taste.

Pan-seared Scallops with a Petite Ratatouille & Potato Grenaille. Every component of this dish is delicious. Ratatouille a la cooked veggies in sauce is very flavourful.

Pan-roasted Sea Bass with Mediterranean Vegetables features fresh fish with pliable, moist yet firm flesh. I personally think that it is not easy to roast or pan-sear fish to perfection, but the chef at Taratata manages to nail it just right. Thumbs-up.

Pan-roasted Eggplant with Parmesan Cheese truly surprises me with how good it is. I never like eggplants, but this dish is one exception for me. Hot eggplant soaked with vegetable sauce works so well with the melted cheese drizzled above.

Chocolate Lava Cake with Vanilla Ice-cream. Premium creamy ice-cream and quality chocolate cake with molten centre is pure indulgence.

The interior is classic with hints of nostalgia, exuding a homely feel. I immediately get comfortable and feel super cozy when there. The service is good and friendly. This is really one French restaurant without the frills, aimed at providing authentic and affordable French food at cozy setting. I can truly go back as often as I like without any special reason or occasion, other than the simple decision to enjoy rustic good French food.

Thoughts: C’est Bon!"
What a weird evening......,"When entering a French restaurant on a Saturday evening at 8.30 h in the busy Keong Saik Rd area and encountering that only one table is occupied, all alarm bells should go off. We stayed. To be fair, the food was good but the rest was just awkward. When our main dish was served we were asked if we want dessert since it is ""last order"" (at 9.15 pm!!). When the people from the other table left, we just tried to finish off our bottle of red wine quickly, the atmosphere was simply eerie. The fact that this restaurant charges 2 SGD for a small bottle of tab water completed our impression. It is not the 2 SGD (on a billl of 300 SGD) but the attitude and greediness of the owner is disturbing."
"Good dinner, cosy environment","Nice, cosy dining environment. No pretense, no extravagance, just a nice warm setting for a stress-less dinner. As they market it on their website, it's not fine dining and they want patrons to dine comfortably and that was exactly how it went.

There were only 4 tables on the Wednesday evening, with 2 service crew including the floor manager. Both of them were prompt, always making sure our tables are attended to, but they look rather expressionless most of the evening.

There were 3 of us. We went for the restaurant week degustation menu, but because there was only one dessert option we decided to change 2 other desserts for variety (with added cost of course).

Came the starters. The foie gras was delicious, it was cooked perfectly and went very well with the dark cherry sauce. Tuna Carpaccio was okay, the meat was a little dry but taste wise it is alright.

There were 3 options for the mains we could choose from so we had one of each. We ordered a 4th main - beef tartare served with fries and salad. The risotto with wild mushrooms was the best, flavour was intense and the rice was al dente. Duck Confit and Grilled Angus Beef Tenderloin (we ordered medium rare) paired with truffle mashed potatoes were nice, not overly seasoned but nothing to wow about. The beef tartare, apart from the weird combi of fries and salad instead of toast, was served with bigger chunks of beef instead of the typical minced meat. This adds to the chewy texture and while I personally love it, my wife preferred it minced. So it's a matter of personal preference. The flavours were pretty good.

The chocolate tart was part of the degustation menu, and we changed two other desserts to a Crème Brulée and a Lemon Meringue Tart. We love all of them. Crème Brulée had the thickest sugar crust I ever had, the lemon sorbet that came with the meringue was tangy and refreshing, while the chocolate tart was rich and went well with the vanilla ice cream and caramel.

The only disappointment was the 3 meagre slice of sourdough served as a starter. There were 3 of us so it meant one for us each, and they were not refillable. We can buy them however at $5 for 5 slices.

Otherwise, it was a pleasant evening"
Very disappointing,"Too spicy for French food Low level of service No smile, too quick 25 min waiting for paying - without excuse for r gift to wait…."
A pleasant surprise,"We choose this place as we wanted to visit Keong Saik area as we hadn’t been for a while. Reserved a table but there were only two other diners on mid week evening. We passed on the three course dinner but had escargots and foil gras for starters first. Both were excellent, the foie gras well pan fried and cherries sauce not too over powering. For main course, I had the beef tartare and she had scallops with ratatouille. My beef tartare was good and her scallops were quite ok. we then split cheese for dessert and had three decent selections of excellent cheeses, livarot was my favourite. The food was excellent and good value, the decor and ambience was a bit lacking but it was nice and quiet for us, not so good for the restaurant. We really enjoyed the meal and will visit again."
Average Dining Experience,"The overall dining experience at Taratata was a bit underwhelming for us. Despite being on time and placing our lunch order promptly, our order was not recorded and we had to wait 30minutes or so after I decided to ask the waiter what happened to our food. While we waited for our food, we were not even served bread… if I hadn’t asked for it, perhaps that would have taken another 10 minutes or so. Service staff was a bit all over the place and we had to request for cutlery to be given. Not quite fitting for a supposedly fine dining restaurant. Soup was okay, baked cheese dish was average, steak was okay. Molten lava cake was delicious. Price wise it is quite good but I just with they improve the service standard and the quality of the food in general. The manager was too busy lost in the reservation sheet than to be bothered with us sitting idle for 30 mins without being served any food."
Cosy French venue with good food,Cosy little French restaurant serve classic delicious French food with good service. Thank you for your hospitality & we will be back!!
Tasty food but sadly too many let downs and kiddie portions for the set meal at $69 ++ is not on,"Dinner on a Saturday evening with friends. Four of us opt for the set 3-course dinner meal and one for a la carte.

What we liked - an $88 Pinot Noir was good, the lobster bisque was tasty but 3 portions were small - more on that later, everyone enjoyed their beef tenderloin, except me. The Madeira sauce was my personal highlight and we agreed the set menu chocolate dessert was good although orange segments lacked depth of flavour and sweetness.

The let’s downs - 1) all four of us ordered the lobster bisque but the one portion that was ordered a la carte was what I’d expect portion wise. The 3 of us ordering the set meal were served smaller portions in an unattractive kid size bowl. This is a bad move it made me feel cheap and unappreciated for ordering the set meal. Our friend with the proper size portion was also embarrassed dining with two men who had very small bowls. 2) The free bread basket shown on the menu wasn’t provided until we asked for it, half-way through our baby soups. 3) For the 3 tenderloin orders, my friends both asked for medium and I ordered medium rare. My friend got my medium rare, they got a medium right but mine was well served as medium rare by the waiting staff but was actually well done. ... uugghh ! 4) The gratin potato serving with the steak was small and there were no other vegetables at all. 5) The ice-cream portion served with the (set meal) chocolate dessert was again very small, about the size of a kids marble.
6) The cheese platter was very poor value considering it was a $5 premium for the set meal third course - the 3 pieces of cheese were so small with my plate by far the worst that I doubt there’s even $1.50 worth of cheese on my plate. It was a big let down and we all got different slivers of cheese but not offered a choice or cut at the table. The cheese was overshadowed by much larger pieces of French toast to help cover the plate and about one eighth of one walnut on my plate as a garnish .

My verdict - the food is tasty but don’t go for the set meal if you are hungry or mix and match with guests can be embarrassing all round.

At $69 ++ for the set meal it’s not acceptable to serve such small portions for this price and it definitely feels like you are being served as a second rate diner.
I did not appreciate this experience"
"Great ambience, average food","Made a restaurant week booking for lunch at Taratata. 3 courses with escargot or terrine for starters, sea bass or steak for mains, and a citron tart for dessert.

The good:
- The best part of the meal was the complimentary bread and butter - honestly top notch
- Great ambience - background chatter from the other diners, great music, and the rain outside was a nice touch to the atmosphere
- Service is very efficient
- Sea bass dish with ratatouille was tasty and well plated

The could-be-better:
- Steak was underwhelming - being cooked to a perfect medium rare could not save it from the stringiness of the cut
- Citron tart was on the sweet side - would've been great if the set came with coffee/tea to complement the dessert"
Nice lunch,"Nice atmosphere and great dishes with friendly services by staff. The fragile Wifi access, almost impossible, at the table, makes us enjoy the dishes. Steak and white wine was my favourite."
Christmas Eve with no merriment,"Our family of 4 shared Christmas Eve at the brasserie — a fixed price meal ($95) for 4 courses. We arrived on time for an early 630 reservation. Surprised a bit by the ambience which was dark and a bit less lively than hoped. The service was a bit off — one of us got a drink but no one else was asked what they’d like. Food was okay but not inspired. We poured our own wine as servers seemed a bit overwhelmed, despite the fact the place wasn’t really full. After our tasty desert was finished, we were told the next table was waiting outside. No question as to whether we wanted tea or coffee. Or anything else. Just done in 1:45. Must admit it left a bad taste in my mouth. For the price — and the season — I definitely would have expected more."
Expectations deflated,"We came with quite high expectations and had the executive set lunch. However, the food failed to impress. I topped up to get the rack of lamb and wanted it medium rare, but it came out close to well done. It is also too salty, which is unfortunate because the cut of the meat was good. The other dishes in the set lunch - the steak and salmon was well presented but tasted average. The best dishes were the starters.The sourdough bread served gratis was good while the entrees - escargots and onion soup were delicious. The service was generally good but marred by a mix-up with one of the mains order which was rectified without fuss."
Wonderful Experience,"I chanced upon this place when I was looking for French food, and decided to give it a try. The first thing I really liked about the place was its atmosphere. The ambience made us feel relaxed. Just loved how they had done the whole place.

We tried their set lunch. The steak tartare was really good, and I enjoyed every bite of it. The escargots were also cooked to perfection. Besides the food, I really liked the staff who were very attentive to our needs. It is definitely worth checking out. The prices are a bit steep but very reasonable in terms of their portion and quality.

Will be back for sure."
Dinner menu,Cosy restaurant with friendly staff. Food is great at reasonably priced menu. Easily accessible by public transport. Try the 3 course dinner menu. It's great!
"My regular joint for French food & wine, my choice!","This cozy, yet not overwhelming restaurant has deeply impressed me for sure!

Great selection of wine list to start off with. Pocket-friendly menu but not compromising in terms of quality. My choices: French onion soup, foie gras, steak & frites, last but not least choc lava cake to end the night with.

Good host & impeccable services rendered throughout. Highly recommend this place and give do yourself a favor and visit Taratata."
Good French Food but with room for improvement.,Visited Taratata last weekend. The food is basic French. The ambience of the restaurant is good and you could almost mistake it for being in Paris! As stated the food is basic but tasty. Probably a bit overpriced for such a simple menu. $68++ per person. The main area for improvement is service which was very amateur. And not too attentive. But overall the place is pretty good.
French food in a noisy setting,"We decided to try French food one weekend and stumbled upon the website. Thought we were rather fortunate to be able to secure a booking for a sat nite. Place was very very crowded and I didn’t think there was really any kind of social distancing being practised.

We were told that our table wasn’t ready and we could sit at another table and to be moved when the table is ready. So we started ordering our drinks and meals and then eventually had had to be moved to our table about 10mins or so later.

What was striking about the place is the level of noise! It is a longish sort of dining room with hard wooden furniture and plain wall. There was just not enough furniture with soft fabric or cushions or something to absorb the deafening sound of music, people speaking at the top of their lungs amidst laughter, with the clanging on the cutlery against dishes.

My husband and I could hardly hear ourselves that we gave up speaking and resorted to texting each other across the table. It was meant to be a romantic date night but no, it had turned to dinner by a busy market place. By the time the mains arrived, I had a splitting headache. It was as if someone held a pot and stood beside me drumming it like an Energizer rabbit. Can something be done about the noise? perhaps change the furniture or decor a bit so that the noise doesn’t bounce off the walls so easily.

The food was basic French food and the standout dish was probably the duck confit. The others were foie gras, the French onion soup, salmon, ratatouille and cheese platter along with half a bottle of red. They were all ok. We did not stay for dessert unfortunately as although the noise had already lessened by then (with fewer patrons), we felt that we had had enough. Service was satisfactory although I noticed the waitress kept making mistakes with the food served to the table next to us.

Overall, it’s a place to be if you want a simple French set meal with no fuss provided they can do something about the noise level."
"Bad food, Poor Ambience.","Poor. Food was blah and overpriced. The foie gras was over cooked rubbery. The steak was too chewy and tasted bland. The Lemon tart tasted stale with its crust soggy. The restaurant was old and run down. Super crowded and really noisy. We had a headache after 30mins as its was really noisy. The ventilation was also bad and stuffy. The smell of the kitchen was overflowing into the dinning area. I wanted to throw up second course in.
Not sure what's attracting the crowd here when there is no ambience and the food is poor. But every restaurant along this stretch was full too on the friday night.

This is one of the worse dinning experience we had. Definitely not worth the price of $160+ for 2 set lousy set dinners with no drinks. I would not come back even if its free."
Decent food but a little pricy,Celebrated wife's birthday there with family. Set lunch was generally OK but food could be warmer. The beef was a little overdone.
Meh. French casual at a high price point,"Had the lunch set menu which is 2-3 choices for appetizer, main and dessert. Because of this, it had a sense of mass production rather than personalization. Plates were simply plated, nothing fancy. The French soup and duck confit was good. We also ordered the cheese plates ($5 extra). We got different cheeses with no explanation and there was no jam/fruit to go with it. Definitely brasserie casual style, but not at casual prices.

For the price paid, this is in the range of a ""very nice lunch"" but I think I'd rather pay $10-$20 more and get better service/food elsewhere. Total bill ended up higher than expected, I think it's because they really push the still/sparking water at $10/bottle. Food was very salty so we ended up needing more than 1 bottle for the table. Every table I saw had bottled water, so not sure if they even serve tap water.

It wasn't bad, but we wouldn't return because at that price point, there are better restaurants out there."
Great French Restaurant in SIngapore,"My wife and i had tried a couple of ""french"" restaurants in Singapore only to be disappointed. That was until we tried this restaurant. From the moment we arrived, whilst dealing with the Covid 19 virus and social distancing, we were welcomed into a space that actually resembled a French restaurant. The wait staff were attentive and busy (missing two floor staff that didn't show up) and trying there best. The food was very good and rich with great flavors. This is a great french restaurant and should be explored ."
"Good food, Good service","Due to present circumstances I have not been to this restaurant in a while. We came under the restaurant week promotion so we had the set meal, although we usually take the a la carte menu. All the dishes were well presented and very good, so it was good value. Service was exceptional. The lady manager (Elizabeth) is a consummate professional who ensures you will have a pleasant experience. If you like a nice dining experience you should definitely put this restaurant on your list."
dinner,lovely french restaurant with good service and decent food quality. loved the foie gras with cherries. will be back soon.
Lovely french restaurant.,Lovely french restaurant. Good comfort food and service great despite Covid circumstances. Many thanks.
excellent,"the best duck confit I’ve ever tasted. The onion soup was savory, fragrant and filling without being too salty. The sauce for the duck confit tasted like a lot of labor has gone into making it. I could not stop smelling the aroma as I ate it. It was so good that I had to ask the waitress to pair it with some red wine for fear that I’m missing some great chance of making the duck even more wholesome. The pear tart is also excellent. This restaurant will keep going because of the great dishes it produces. Excellent dishes chef!"
Authentic and soothing french cuisine,"Tried their set dinner during my first visit and fell in love with the place for the lovely service and delicious food. When I came back for their set lunch, the waitress remembered us and we love how welcoming and attentive she was.

As for the food, it is definitely of good value for money. The taste is just right for every dish, not too salty nor bland. Their beef and pork are so tender and soft that it doesn’t even require a knife to cut it apart. The duck confit is nice and crispy without being too oily. The onion soup is a must-order too, with lots of tasty cheese and caramelised onions.

I can’t wait to revisit the restaurant once they update their set lunch/dinner menu after 8th Dec to try their other dishes."
Very average food - but nice staff,"We went during restaurant week. Set menu - very limited - duck or beef. My partner eat neither - so had the vegetarian option. Starter was a bland Tuna Tartar. Too much mayonnaise and tasteless tuna. Main course Duck Confit - not crisp enough, vegetarian goat cheese tart was overly strong in flavour. Desserts awful. Baked cheese watery. Some sort of berry compote - too sweet and again poor consistency. This restaurant been running for over 10 years. There are some wonderful options on Keong Saik - so avoid this place. I think the time has come to call it a day."
"Mains, appetizers, desserts good","Dinner during Restaurant Week. Surprisingly good! Tried the duck confit, beef bourguignon, foie gras, tuna tartare, baked cheese. Wine selection wide too.

And staff was friendly and helpful. Lady in black (in charge?) and waitresses were warm and attentive, without being overwhelming. Will return for another visit."
Authentic French food,Staff was friendly and knows menu well to give recommendations for both wine and food. Great service and ambience. 1 of my favourite place to dine in.
Our favorite french,"We regularly dine at weekends.
This french is one of our most favorite one.

Garçons & garçonetes are friendly, and our recommendations are escargot, beef and cheese.

You will never be disappointed."
Good food with great service,Food was great. Love the premeal bread which left me thinking about it after that meal. Love the scallop dish and foie gras. Service at the restuarent left me a big impression. No rush into meals. I felt like im eating at home.
Not to be missed,"If you like French food or is just starting to try it, this is the place to visit in Singapore.
Great value for the set lunch we had, and a good French wine to add.
The duck confit was superb - crispy on the outside and moist within. A generous portion too. The Scottish salmon was another highlight. You can taste the sweetness of the fish even though it came with a great lobster-based sauce. And these were after the delicate foie gras, and escargot.
Service was very good and quite ambiance for a great lunch. Will definitely visit again."
Fantastic Paris,It starts with French music and you feel it is going to be a great night out. Food is fantastic. This month we were there already twice... and I don't usually return so early to the same place... But it leaves a deep impression when you dine there. It takes you literally to Paris.
Disappointing menu and highly priced for dinner,"The menu is somehow too classical, everything standardized to a point there is nothing you would not find in any other similar brasserie. Wines and food are more expensive than many other brasseries in Singapore. I won't go back."
French food at its finest,"Wonderful food, attentive service. A real pleasure to eat here with friends. Thank you to the staff and chef for a great experience."
"You can wear your Bata’s to Taratata and eat patatas fritas, but no roti prata","Classic bistrot décor (with French music in the background) and classic bistrot food - nothing particularly innovative (so, for instance, no sweetbread or rabbit), just well-executed traditional brasserie dishes. We had the escargots, foie gras poêlé, salade de crabe, entrecôte grillée, confit de canard, and tarte fine aux poires, and they’re all yummy. Reasonable pricing; the set lunch represents great value. Decent wine list, friendly service, so we will certainly go back."
"Authentic French Food, good ambience!","Very authentic French food. The crab bisque taste alike with the fish bisque in Paris. Foie Gras terrine is great too. The bread served was warm and tasty, hard crust with soft dough. Decor is also quite French too.
Service is great too. Attentive and with a
Will go again!"
Really good traditional French food,"Taratata offers your traditional French cuisine, at reasonable prices (by Singapore standards). Food is very enjoyable and the wine is good. Best dish we tried was the river trout in beurre blanc, it was perfect. Definitely coming back fto try out some of the other mains."
First visit recommended by a French friend,"We were very much looking forward to our first visit last night. The restaurant it’s self was very French. Busy, which is always a good sign. Unfortunately a table of 6 French men spoilt the whole evening. Being very loud and disruptive. Unfortunately after 3 of them went outside to try to control the worst one who was banging on parked cars and making rude gestures to a couple sat at the window, the waiters still kept serving them with wine. The food, was mediocre, the service very slow and for the cost, we will not be returning."
Excellent classic French food in Keong Saik,"TaraTata is a good find in Keong Saik, classic French food and a good selection of wines and attentive service."
Great Feast,Sumptuous food and excellent service! Portions of food are just nice. Will recommend to friends and family.
TASTY and cosy !,"So glad to have followed KEVIN the greatest GM to try Taratata! It is a nice, cute and cosy bistro with a large selection of good food and a menu very affordable ! Personally i tried the salad and the ribeye with green beans, great pairing choices, very tasty, amazing ribeye sauce and the salad was the best, it reminded of the real niçoise salad with good olives, and good products ! thanks guys, see you !"
Great experience,Food was really impressive. And reasonable for weekends cause set lunch are still available. Definitely will be back
Nice Valentine's Dinner,"Went there with my wife to celebrate the Valentine's day.

Very nice starter, especially the foie gras, very impressive.
The beef tastes fine but the seasoning could be more generously.
The cod fish is quite nice.
The dessert is a bit too sweet for both of us.

The service is very professional."
Always perfection!,"I always visit Taratata when in need of excellent French food. The chef is incredible with perfect attention to detail - every dish always tastes even better than it looks, which is a challenge! They have an excellent, extensive wine menu that caters for all tastes.

The service is impeccable and the staff always know when you might need something or when you just want some time to chat with your dinner company. In particular, Elizabeth and Kevin are always genuinely welcoming and are such warm hosts. Kevin's not too bad at setting the odd crepe on fire too! ;)

Overall, an amazing French restaurant. You'll forget you're in Singapore and instantly be in a side street of Paris. My favourite restaurant in the country!

Thanks guys!"
Cozy and comfortable bistro with great food!,This place never disappoints me- consistently excellent food at reasonable prices! Love the vibe of this place too!
Slow food and poor service,"Granted we went for dinner during the Chinese New Year period but it took an hour for our starters to come and our sides hadn’t even arrived after we had all finished our mains. No one came to apologise or let us know about the state of our food.

Once all our mains were cleared from the table, our host said to cancel the sides. Just then, I saw the sides come and I heard whispers of complimentary but it went instead to another table on the instruction of the maitre d..

Also when we ordered the Crepe Suzette, the french maitre d who had cooked for all the other tables didn’t cook for us and I could see that he was definitely free.

Left a sour taste for us and feeling of being overlooked and belittled. We won’t be going back anytime soon no matter how the food tasted."
Excellent food and ambiance,"Been coming here for 5 years, never gets old. Food is superb, staff friendly. Value for a Singapore French restaurant, given Singapore is so expensive."
An exceptional Frenchy evening,"All you wish to get from a small upscale intimate French brasserie if you have, as my guest and I have, grown up in Paris and Marseilles and are living in separate places in South East Asia. Two old friends, a Friday night, a business deal in mind, a need for ""home food"" and a couple of decent bottles. We had the set menu with a trou Normand and took our time. Maitre D' Kevin (French despite the name) took exceptionally good care of us, understood winks and catered for a memorable dinner. The foie gras was yummy, the bisque delightful and the Bearnaise excellent. Only suggestion: a couple of choices for a good Calvados to go with the take-me-home espresso. Merci et à bientôt!"
"Good ambience, good service","I like the ambience and the service provided by the staffs.Maybe it's me, the food is good as well but I might be a lil picky."
Hidden Gem,"There are two types of French restaurants- those with pretensions to be haut cuisine, and those that juts want to serve good tasty food. Taratata is the latter. Food like you would get in a bistro in a small town in France. Pate, great duck confit, excellent moules frites. Attentive service from Kevin. This is a place to be a regular at. well done!"
Nice setting and staff. Food not so much,"Our evening started off very well and since this restaurant had decent reviews and awards I thought it would be a solid choice.
ENTREE - The onion soup and Rabbit terrine were lovely
MAIN- My two friends ordered the steak medium rare (obviously not a standard in France) However in international French restaurants they should know. Their steaks were closer to Bleu than even Saignant! and one friend couldn't even chew it. The friendly waiter took them back and promptly returned with them with the chef clearly just re-cooking the originals.
Given the price, a proper chef would not simply slap your steak back on the grill! double cooking a steak just makes it tougher. We were told 'Oh its because the Chef is cooking the French way'...
I had the Beef tartare which was ok, but more like 'fillet Americano' you get in Belgium where its almost a paste with everything mixed in... I miss the hand cut fillet, egg yolk on top and separate condiments, but this international version seems common now.
overall, great entree's and wine. Friendly and attentive service, but I've seen better quality food from restaurants half the price."
not worth the price,"we were disappointed with the food. we read so much good reviews, hence we decided to make our way down to try the food. well, the food was quite ok, not exceptionally delicious specially for the amount paid - the french onion soup had so much cheese that we were eating more cheese than the onions. the shrimp dish was a huge disappointment! just a few shrimp around the bowl. the serving grace was the service. the staff were attentive and friendly. but definitely won't be back again."
Fantastic French,"Small restaurant with a great French Brasserie feel. Our group of 6 got a terrific little table in the corner. The menu is classic French, superbly delivered. We ordered the $75++ set menu (which seemed to cover a significant number of the dishes on the a'la carte menu). Between 6 of us we covered most of the choices: both soups were great; the rabbit and frog leg entrees were enjoyed, the prawn bouquet was good - but seriously old school; the lamb, duck, and beef mains were all enjoyed; as were the crème brulee and chocolate lava.The service was attentive, but not overpowering, nice touch for the chef to come out at the end of the night.The wine list is good, albeit limited - although it is a small restaurant. Like everywhere in Singapore it is pricey. Only a couple of $100(ish) options, and then jumped up into the $200+. We found White and Red in our price range - and all were good wines."
classic french food,"Overall, a great place to eat. Food is excellent. Pointers to make it an excellent rating, is to have a full menu especially on a weekend. This is twice we went and they don't have various dishes on the menu. Another point to improve on is the serving portion of the Rabbit terrine. As this is quite a heavy dish, a smaller/thinner portion would make the dish more appetizing."
Excellent Cheese!,"Came for dinner with my girlfriend to celebrate her birthday. We ordered the 4 course set dinner at $75++ per person. I had French Onion Soup which was significantly more flavourful than my friend's Crab Bisque. I also enjoyed my Foie Gras more than her Smoked Salmon with white asparagus. We ordered 1 serving of 3 kinds of cheese. The camembert was tasty, the Brillat Savarin tasting like yogurt was also nice but our favourite was the Roquefort. It was the best blue cheese I've ever tasted! Not pungent, it was full bodied, creamy and flavourful. I could eat it without the accompanying cracker, savouring it slowly in my mouth. All 3 are French soft cheeses. For mains, we had Tenderloin and Rack of Lamb. We were already pretty full after the cheese so had a hard time finishing the main courses. The beef was better than the lamb. We had Chocolate Lava for dessert. It was good but we would have appreciated it better if we weren't so full. The set was value for money. Wine pairing available at $65 per pax for every dish. It's really hard to find parking here and it's not accessible via train either. But I'll still go back again. The food's satisfying."
Best French Restaurant in Town,It is our second time here and it is even fantastic the second time around. Seafood soup is a good start. The Lamb and frog legs is a worth to try dish. Staff’s are very attentive and friendly.
experience could be improved,I have been a fan of Taratata but not been there for sometime. This occasion of my birthday was less than thrilling. The two classic dishes Coq au Vin and the Lapin had already been sold out by 6.30pm! This was quite surprising since there was only one other couple present. Why bother to put them on the menu if you don't intend to serve them? Service was attentive but the missing menu left a strong air of disappointment
Good French bistro with all the traditional dishes,"Services is attentive without being obtrusive.
Menu is quite wide ranging with all the usual French brasserie fare such as onion soup, escargot, entrecote, coq au vin, boeuf bourguignon, et al.

We had the steak frites and duck confit all well executed. Wine list is good and prices are not exorbitant."
"Great service, average food","Good
- the service. There were only 2 service staff (presumably 1 manager (in jacket) and 1 junior staff (in normal uniform) - but they more than adequately covered the whole restaurant. On that evening, there were 6 tables occupied, but they were attentive without being obtrusive.
- the decor. I felt transported back to the time I was in France - it was like a little bistro in Lyon/Nice.

Can be better
- the food. My table mostly tried the set-dinner, while I ordered ala-carte. In general, we found about half of the dishes were good/tasty, but half were very *average/mediocre.
- the wine. This is based against places like Wine Connection / 1855 / Wine Company that serve ""nice"" wine (to me) at decent prices S$20-40+. We had one that was about S$85 - but again - was what I would call ""average"".

*Please bear in mind the pricing of the food, hence this comment of ""average"". A soup is about S$20-30, warm/cold appetizers S$20-40, and the mains were S$40 and upwards. So, with these prices (in Singapore), you expect the food to really impress you. Sadly, it didn't."
Nice restaurant,"Randomly choose this restaurant because the one we want to try either super long queue or not open for lunch.
We tried their Mother’s day lunch menu. Very quiet place which could be due to lunch time. That place famous with all different restaurants and pubs after office hour.
Mother’s day menu consists of 3 course. It’s nice and portion just right. We tried venison and scallop as appetizer, lobster and angus beef as main and nougat and pear as desserts. Everything is nice. Beef is juice and tender.
Definitely will try their dinner one day"
Nice French Bistro,"Very nice French Bistro located in China Town. Nice music and relaxing atmosphere.
The food is tasty and fresh. We love they home made duck leg confit, cod fish and french onion soup. The desserts are divine, the chocolate cake and raspberry sherbet are well recommended.The service was great! We felt we were warmly welcomed."
Fantastic dinner,Very good french dinner. Enjoyed all the courses. Great selections for the set dinner. Will definitely return. Food portions are fairly large!
Excellent French Bistro,"The food was really amazing, tasty and fresh. I reccommand this place to anyone who are looking for french food! Thank you again for this lunch!"
Lovely place and excellent food,"a lovely time - the food wa perfect. the tartare was fabulous and all was high standard.
wine is extremely expensive, we chose an excellent saint estephe - no regrets but that s a pity they don t have a middle range wine bottle (80/90)...you don’t want to drink all the time an excellent and expensive wine.
service and atmosphère are excellent
i recommande the place."
"Great Food, Great Service","Fantastic food, some of the best French I've had in Singapore. Service was polite, efficient and well trained. The wine list is quite expensive ($98SGD for a 500ml carafe for a mid range Boudreaux), however the quality is excellent and the service of it was fantastic."
Great Food Overpriced Wine,My husband and I had a very enjoyable meal there last week - we went for the set menu - good choices - good portions - and reasonable price for quality food - it all stopped there the wine price was outrageous - we paid 90 SGD for a prosecco (it was the cheapest wine on offer) and not good quality - would we go back? sadly no as we would feel we were being ripped off having to pay around 130 SGD for a bottle of red or white wine - I mean you can’t have a lovely French meal without wine!.
"Cold mains, overpriced French food, disappointing..","What a poor dinner choice this was! For the prices charged, you’re better off eating any of the other restaurants (heaps of good ones) within this vicinity."
Great French resto,"Great food and great service, had the 4 course meal and everything was really good! We will definitely come back!!!!!!!!"
Set Dinner,Attentive friendly service. Good food recommendations by staff. Had the set dinner which was wonderful. Every dish was good. Highly recommend. Wine choices a little pricey though.
"Cozy ambience, Kindly service, Delicious food.","I had for the set dinner menu. They started new dinner menu when I visited at restaurant.
The ambience made me feel to comfortable and there were many new food to choose from. I asked for advice from staff while I was trying to choose the menu. She helped me choose my dinner with kind explanation.

Soup made my appetite and I could feel the fresh and deep taste. I felt like a soup that mom made for me when I was young.
The entrée was a terrine that the chef had made himself, and that flavor made me smile. The most difficult main course to choose. I chose veal and foie gras to feel the texture of various ingredients. As expected, my choice was right and the texture balance was fantastic.
Finally with sweet dessert, I could spend my vacation in a pleasant place with kind service and delicious food.
Thank you for the all of restaurant staffs."
fantastic lunch experience,It was a fantastic lunch for me and my girlfriend. The staff were attentive and friendly. I surely come back to try other dish.
"Nice Steak, OK Ambience","Went to Taratata as I received quite a good review on the food. It was indeed a nice meal (we had steak), but the experience was ordinary. So if you're looking for good food, should give this place a go but perhaps not really recommended for big celebration."
Over-priced for mediocre food and indifferent service,"The kitchen tried to do more than it had the flare or skill for and the result was very mediocre. The only dish that was good was the crab bisque which had an intense flavour. The sauce for the starter and the main course tasted the same, and tinned fruit (clementine) was used in the dish. I took the 4-course menu with wine pairing, but only three drinks were offered, with the ""champagne"" for the dessert being a very tiny glass. Water is charged extra. The quality of the food and the indifferent service was too low to justify the high price of the menu 70++ SGD, and the 70++ SGD wine pairing is certainly not worth it."
Good ambience and service,relaxed and cosy ambience. The food is tasty and delicious. Lastly the price is affordable The service is relatively good
Good Food & Service,"Mainly set menus here for lunch and dinner, with a separate wine pairing add-on should you wish to. Food was good, oysters were fresh, service was good as well. An enjoyable experience."
Great service but food was average,Good place for small groups. Ambience was ok but service was great! Parking can be an issue there and it is not very child or handicapped friendly as the step is too high and restaurant is pretty small.
French food skillfully prepared,The ambiance was great. Not too loud. Set meal was value for money for our wedding anniversary. Their beef was really well prepared with well rounded flavour.
Very very good French food,"Fresh, authentic French cuisine
Good service and classy/cosy ambience
Two suggestions:
1. Service staff should explain the dishes (menu description is really quite brief)- helps better understand what we are eating. For that price I think it helps!
2. Use of wine glasses- different glasses for different wine!"
Excellence in everything,"This restaurant is such a discovery for me and my husband. It's perfect in everything- the location (central area), the ambience, the service and definitly the food.
Cosy atmosphere in warm lights, sexy music will set your mood for perfect dining experience. I would like to thank Grace and other ladies (unfortunately didn't get their names) for providing us extremely friendly service, that complimented our evening.
We had 4 course meal with recommended wine. Every dish is simply a piece of art - amazing taste and beautiful presentation.
Went there on Sunday evening, the place wasn't really busy, I would recommend it for romantic dinner.
This place is a benchmark.
Definitly will come there again."
Disappointing,"I vaguely have rather good impression of this pooplave when i dined here 1.5yrs ago. However, was really disappointed when i came bacck tonight with my gfs. The cod was very very dry, and almost fishy. Despite it was really a tiny piece, none of us took more than a bite. The duck coinfit was dry, suspected it was baked at high temperature and the coq vin was very salty. Spent almost $500 for 4 of us and was quite disappointed. Could think of much better restaurant to go to. Well, at least the complimentary bread was good - crusty on outside and soft inside."
The Tops,Best meal of 5 restaurants we dined at during our stay in Singapore. Excellent cuisine--Le Canard Confit the best I've had. Delicious Strawberry Tart. Crusty bread.Professional and attentive service. Refined ambience.
Enjoyable dinner !,"Choose the set dinner, and a bottle of wine. Overall the food is enjoyable and nicely done. A bottle of their wine is reasonable."
Nice cosy place with relatively good food,"Celebrated my bestie's birthday at this French restaurant. Totally love the soup and the foie gras starters. Absolutely delicious! Dinner set are good value for money, will definitely be back!"
Love the ambience!,"True fine dining, meaning less noise polution which you don't experience in most fine-dine restaurants in Singapore. The food is of decent portion and taste really good, with reasonable price."
Excellent food n value for money,Order the 4 course set n u will never go wrong. Service staff lack experience butThey r polite n can see they are trying. Keep it up!
Excellent Food,"Taratata Bistrot's located at 35A Keong Saik Road It's a classic French restaurant with an excellent ambience. the food here is descent better than most French restaurants that I have visit, and The prices aren't unreasonable ,and The food that we ordered( escargot ,duck confit ,wagyu steak, cod fish, and onion soup) was well cooked, well-presented and nice portions too. Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. Would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will definitely come back."
Set Lunch,Happy with the cosy ambience and great service. The set lunch we had were good. Will definitely come back again.
Farewell Lunch,"At $38 per head, this is value for money. Serves in big portion and quality is good. Staffs was very attentive and food was serve pretty fast it was not slow although there was a comments that food was served being slow.
Love their ambience too. Will definitely recommend to others and visit again."
"Great food, value for money","Had lunch set @$38 which is value for money. Start with foie gras which didn't expect the serving portion was big at the price and the taste was yummy! Ordered duck confit and taste was superb as well- skin is crispy ;).
But when come to dessert the trio was not able to compare to the main n starter which is a little disappointed and rather the restaurant just serve ice cream or maybe end with coffee or tea which is good enough!

The overall experience was quite pleasant given the restaurant is not crowded at all maybe is lunch and a Sunday.
The interior setup is like a bistro at France which is cosy - Nice !"
Dinner set did not disappoint,"At $75 per head, this is wonderful value for the quality and quantity served.

The foie gras is definitely one of the best I have tasted. The pairing with the tart pastry and berries went so well.

The Wagyu beef was ok. I think it has to do more with the cut and quality then the preparation. It was not as flavorful as others I have eaten.

We had a carafe of the Pinot noir and it was just ok. Smooth but lacking in body.

Service was attentive but maybe the staff were not experienced. They walked up and down, past our tables but they didn't top up our wine glasses. We had to do it ourselves except for 1 time. But they topped up the other table regularly. So we will pretty puzzled.

Will definitely visit again.

Tip: pls make a reservation if you are going slightly later (say 8pm). We were there at 7pm and there were ample seats, but they had to turn away and make walk in guest wait after 8pm on a Friday."
"lovely birthday lunch, just a a little rushed","Brought my friend there for her birthday lunch treat. Food, ambience and service was lovely. In my chope booking, I mentioned it was my friend's birthday, and they made the effort to put a candle and a ""happy birthday"" tag on my friend's dessert. That was very kind of them. I definitely think it is great value for the type and quality of food we were served. We felt just a little ""rushed"" occasionally, though I think that is quite understandable as it is lunch service, and we only went at 1.30pm. So take home lesson is that if you want a nice leisurely lunch, start your lunch earlier :)."
The 4Gs in having a great evening,Good friends. Good food. Good service. Good atmosphere. What else can I ask for? We had the 4 course set dinner. Crab soup was a delight with lots of crab (that's what my friends commented). The foie gras was was a hit with a good portion. The wagyu beef and duck confit were simply delicious. Service and atmosphere faultless
"Good food, slow service","They give a pretty good price for lunch set. With that price, the food were definitely worth the value. The downside is the service was a little bit slow."
Great French Dinner,Great service!! A little too fine dining for me considering it should have been a bistrot... but the food was very good and the service staff were VERY attentive.
Stay away,"Ordered main courses only. Waitress said we should order starters because the mains will take 25min to arrive. I looked at the place it was empty, 3 tables. We declined, she insisted twice, almost forcing us.

Then asked still or sparkling water, I asked for tap water. When later the tap water arrived we were told they charge 1$ fee for tap water ! We obviously made a scene and didnt pay.

Many better (much better) french bistrots options in Singapore, don't waste your time here"
"Excellent, do try this French gem!","We have had many many French meals in Singapore, and this would have to be one of the best.
The decoration is very French, and transports you.
The attentive staff were professional and did not hover too much.
Our food was delectable. I enjoyed the Crab Bisque and my partner the Chatcuterie Platter which was generous in size, for starters.
Then I had the Cod and Mussels and my partner the Rabbit. My only gripe would be we were not offered greens with our mains.
Could not resist the Rhubarb Crumble with Strawberry ice cream.
The courses were well spaced, we were not rushed.
The restaurant was full on the night we dined so my advice would be to book to secure a table.
Also, the French red was delectable"
Brilliant small bistrot,"Run by chef owner for 7 years now. Good food, not an average bistrot menu. Onion soup is hearty, a real stuff. Crab salad with fresh tomato and citrus dancing in flavour. Pan seared foie gras on apple tartlette. Rare rump steak with black and green peppercorn rub served with french fries. Braised rabbit leg. Friendly staffs and service."
