Awesome Service Staff,"We had a wonderful time spending our rainy afternoon at this resto bar.
The food was great, the ambiance was warm, made even warmer by the friendliest and the most accomodating staff named Marilyn.

Not only was she accomodating, she welcomed the 3 of us as if we were her long lost sisters!
She managed to introduced us (and taught us too!) of some of the mixes and needless to say, we tried one Merci Gimlet and it was amazing!

We will surely comeback, not just for the food but for the warmth and friendliness Ms Marilyn offerred to us. Trully an awesome exeprience!!!"
Over-Rated,"Personally, this place is over-rated. They ask for bookings and are snobbish about this.

However, they did not have half the items we ordered, so we had to settle.

The cake/dessert was much to sweet.

Good reputation. Poor delivery"

Quick awesome lunch,"We had quick lunch yesterday. This is our first time here but it felt like we‚Äôve been here many times. We just really love how the shift manager maryjane welcomed us when she asked if its our first time. She recommended really good food and was very enthusiastic and explained the menu very well.

"Excellent food, excellent service","Not my first time at Merci Marcel and the food is consistently good. My friends and I especially loved the tarte flamb√©e, chicken breast and ravioli. Must try‚Äôs!

The restaurant staff are also always cheerful and look like they genuinely enjoy interacting with customers.

Reservations are a must! Made a reservation for indoor seating but unfortunately the previous customer exceeded their time there and we had to sit at the outside sofas. Was a little bummed out but excellent service recovery on the restaurant‚Äôs part as we were offered dessert to make up for it, and the dessert was excellent as well!

Will definitely be visiting again soon!"
"Hugely popular, and with good reason","We were shown to a table immediately after we arrived. We ordered eggplant caviar with tomato and Buffalo mozzarella (not outstanding) as a starter with a delicious warm pita bread (outstanding--we even asked for another order of pita bread). We shared small ravioli with spinach and cheese in a cheese sauce (I thought it was delicious). We also shared French fries with Angus steak which was quite tender, juicy and delicious. We shared caramel salty creme Brule for dessert. It was a new creme Brule flavor to me, and I enjoyed it . Prices were reasonable. Our waitress was very personable, helpful, and happy. Social distancing was very good. We felt the location, atmosphere, and service were excellent."
Birthday Dinner,The service provided by Marilyn was superb. She's so accomodating and entertaining. Food is nice specially the ravioles de royans and truffle fries.
Birthday dinner with friends,We had such a blast celebrating our friend's birthday at Merci Marcel! Ms Marilyn was super accomodating and friendly and the food was superb!
Breakfast gem on Orchard road,This is a Cosy & charming restaurant /bar with eclectic French decor. We had breakfast by the window. Great croissants & coffees. Prices are reasonable. The place felt spacious & seating quite well spaced out. Highly recommended
Great food and service!,"The Merci Marcel branch at Palais Renaissance had a fantastic ambience, perfect for dinner with views overlooking the streets of Orchard - better yet with the Christmas lights in full splendour. The experience there was topped off with friendly and attentive staff (thank you Safiah), and a good selection of French food. The Duck Parmentier, Ravioles de Rayon, Tuna Ceviche and Chocolate Triology did not disappoint."
Satisfaction guaranteed,First dine out of the month with family and it was lovely and very well satisfied coming here. I would say it was one of the impeccable service we had. Not to mention the friendly host Maryjane who made sure that everything was ok to our preference. At first she said we only had an hour to dine in as there was a booking but she managed to let us stay longer and enjoy. One of the best beef burger we had and french toast! The ambience? Its awesome! Will definitely be back to try the other food and looking forward to the opposite shop! Excellent job to everyone!
Thumb up!,"Food was amazing delicious. All staff are friendly with excellent service. Marilyn is super engaging. However, I did not get any special for my birthday although I had indicated my reservation to celebrate birthday."
Interesting food and great service!,I would say this is my first time at a French cuisine restaurant. Interesting appetisers from duck rillette to baby potatoes (off menu). Paired with a bottle of rose. They also served a complimentary chocolate cake for my birthday (upon request)!! Thanks Nora and Jasper for the wonderful service Loved it here.

Worth it.,The food was scrumptious.. I recommend the French toast and pizza. The people were also very accommodating. Surely I'll be back very soon.
"Delicious Food, Wonderful Staff and Service, Good Ambiance","Heard great reviews about Merci Marcel from friends, and finally managed to try. Warm welcome from Sherry as soon as you arrive. Was seated at the bar, as it was still winding down from lunch service.

Ordered an espresso, Duck Parmentier, and Ravioles de Royans ¬´ Palais ¬ª. After tasting the duck confit, thought it was best paired with wine. Abiel, knowledgeable bartender that he is, immediately had the best wine suggestion of C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne Villages Visan AOC 2019. Delightfully impressed of how well it went with the shredded duck confit.

Super attentive service from Sherry, MJ and Abiel who would ask how my food was and if I wanted anything else, like desserts or another glass of wine; the latter of which I ordered another glass.

Overall, the restaurant had a great ambiance, plus the staff were cheerful and greeted arriving and departing guests enthusiastically."
