Fun time with kids,"First time there with kids. It was a wholesome experience - games with free flow drinks and snacks is gold. Good selection of drinks and snacks I must say. Oh and popcorn was sweet with a tinge of saltiness, which is perfect. We were welcomed by the crew warmly and that gave a good vibe. The game selection was wide and differentiated by the level of difficulty. The easier levels were kid-friendly. We did Costume Party Assassins and a Tikki game. The crew explained each of the games simply enough for the kids to follow. Will go back!"
